they feel they need to go and um be in in in church but uh we trust that it'll become more as we listen to the word today and realize the the real meaning behind Easter and that it is the actual Foundation of every individual that loves and serves the Lord Jesus amen praise God and so um I trust that some of you had some time yesterday to T tune in uh Pastor Simon out there in Quebec to listen in on some of the service that are happening there they've been a real blessing I know that a lot of the Believers but praise God we've got a good show of people here today amen and a good half of the church almost is there so uh this is wonderful to see all your beautiful faces in the house of the Lord this morning praise God Amen Glory Hallelujah well let's uh go to the word of God this morning we're going to read from the scripture Matthew 28 verse two we've already had lots of prayer lots of worship so we can go straight to the word I just feel his atmosphere and his anointing coming into our midst here in a special way amen and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the Lord descended from Hemet and came and rolled back the Stone from the door and sat upon it his countenance was like lightning and his his rainment white as snow and for fear of him the keepers did shake and became as dead men the Lord add His blessings to the word you may be seated this morning amen happy Easter everybody he is risen he didn't rise today he rose 2,000 years ago Christianity is the foundation of his resurrection amen his resurrection is the foundation of Christian ity it's all Christ no matter how you look at it it's the greatest Victory you know today there's Christian churches all over the world that are worshiping Jesus Christ because it's Resurrection morning many many are are rejoicing around the Victory and the transforming power that comes from the resurrection of Jesus Christ you know what looked like a defeat on Friday turned into Victory as Jesus overcame sin overcame death took all of of your unbelief and everything that that that that was holding you back from being all that you were supposed to be he took it and he nailed it to the Cross he placed it there he said it is finished it's a finished work it's not something that you have to work up anymore it's not something that you need to do listen we're here today to Rejoice over the victory amen praise God everyone loves a good story of Triumph doesn't everybody love a good story of Triumph one where someone overcomes All Odds he overcame every odd he overcame every mock he overcame every nail every scar every every piercing sword that that that was placed into him he was wounded he was scourged he was he he he overcame it all my God think about it Saints it's the greatest Victory story of all time everybody loves a great Victory Story one where there astonishing efforts immortalize them imagine you know where where they do things that that that people remember forever well this is something that goes down Beyond history this started from before the foundations of the world and it never has an ending to them that believe in the great Victory you know um I just want to go back to 1993 in 1993 let's go to the next slide one of the greatest stories in baseball history took place right here in Toronto it was the story of Joe Carter JC in 1993 World Series home run and it was the baseball play that occurred in game seven of the 1993 World Series on October 23rd 1993 it was at the Skydome in Toronto in the bottom of the 9th Inning Joe Carter hit a one out three-run walkoff home run run off Philly uh Philly's closer Mitch Williams to give the Toronto Blue Jays its second consecutive World Series championship this was only the second time in Major League Baseball history that the World Series ended on a walkoff home run the first time was in game 7 of 1960 World Series when Pittsburgh Pirates second baseman Bill m kski hit a home run off New York Yankees pitcher Ralph Terry to win the game by a final score of 10 to9 Carter's home run in 1993 however was the only time in Major League Baseball history that a team hit a walk-off home run while trailing six to5 in the bottom of the ninth you want to talk about Against All Odds and they ended up winning the World Series 8-6 you know back at that back in 1992 93 94 what was happening was what was called the Toronto blessing people people recognized it as the Toronto blessing and you know I was thinking about all that and you know just pondering on this this whole thought and it took me back to those years and in 1992 93 the the trono uh you know Blue Jays won the World Series back to back I believe that God was pouring out his Spirit you think well what's that got to do with baseball it's got nothing to do with baseball it's got to do with the power and the spirit of God coming into the midst of a blessing that was being spread and starting to revive and move through the hearts of people right here in the Toronto area area a lot of us can go back and recognize that it was at that time that that many of us came in I know that it was in 1994 when myself and sister Jennifer received the power of the Holy Ghost because God was moving God was blessing God was pouring out his Spirit not just in Toronto but it was recognized in Toronto listen the Toronto blessing broke and I and I'm going to add was publicly recognized then but it had already been happening in '92 and 93 there was talk about the spirit moving and and Protestant churches you know um just leftwing rightwing just starting to experiencing outpourings of the Holy Spirit crying and weeping there was a great Revival that took place at the Toronto Airport and that's where you know it it really became public and people started to recognize that what's going on here there's there's an outpouring of God's spirit and I believe that the Toronto Blue Jays they reive the benefit of that outpouring because here's a Canadian team in a in a baseball league where it's 98% us baseball players and teams and here's a Canadian team that doesn't do it just one year they do it two years back to back I believe God was pouring out his prosperity and his anointing upon the city of Toronto amen and anybody that was in that atmosphere and and was was was uh you know had some representation within their hearts God was starting to speak to them and I was one of those that God was speaking to and I know there's others here that God was dealing with their lives moving in their hearts and bringing them to a recognition of his spirit and his anointing amen praise God it was back then in 1993 that I was living in Miss Saga and I came home one day and I seen a a man and two children and one of them was my son Michael playing on the front lawn and so I pulled in and I came into the driveway and I walked over and I looked and it was Pat Borders the back catcher for the Toronto Blue Jays playing baseball with my son Michael and his son cuz they were the same Mage and I said hey how you doing he says oh great you know nice to meet you says we just moved in next door and here I you know when when I started to think about all this you think well what are you telling us here brother Danny I'm telling you this because it was at that time that a lot of change was coming into into our lives into our home into our family amen into the in into the ministry you can go back and look at what took place in in Eagles cry Ministry at at the time that's what it was called there was a supernatural Revival that was taking place in the lives of many people at that time and our church literally exploded in 1993 94 95 and many hearts and lives were turned to Jesus Christ I realized by meeting Pat Borders that I was right on the border of a great change coming in my life because it was in January of 1994 that the that the message of the hour was was shared by Brother Gabriel Fetti and I realized that that you know something Supernatural was taking place in my life now that I look back I can only see the supernatural because our lives are not ours they're ordered and ordained of God you might think that you're here here today because you just thought you would just go to church but I know many of you are here today because you have a relationship based on an experience that God gave you personally if it's not a personal relationship then what is it it's just tradition it's just like 98% of the world out there that's in the churches this morning they're there because they feel they have to be there they want to be seen that's not why we're here here we're here because of an experience a reality amen some things are better experienced than explained I believe Joel Carter to this day can still feel the anointing and the atmosphere that that that was around him when he hit that ball out of the park and the and the people went crazy it's an experience that you know I can't explain to you that experience you'd have to experience it yourself you would have had to be there I was not there but I know that his name is now you know it's been it's been named many times over the pulpit even our pastor talks about the great you know uh uh home run that was hit by JC I believe JC hit a great home run when he when he called you when he when he came after you when he when he uh uh did everything he it was beyond odds that he could actually reach you I look back and I said Lord it's a miracle amen that you got a hold of me it's a miracle I'm looking at Miracles all around me here Miracles you want to you know people want to see Miracles they want to see people raised from the dead listen you want to see somebody raised from the dead just see somebody that their life was was lost in sin and now they're living and walking for Christ that is a true Resurrection there's no greater miracle that we could ever witness than to witness an individual that has come into a personal relationship with Jesus Christ and their lives being transformed and now they they they they sing they worship they're not ashamed to to name the name of Jesus Christ the Savior Hallelujah I don't know anybody that lives in this city in this province in this country that doesn't hold a driver license if they hold one and it says that that driver's license has a date on it that they were born and the date that they were born was in direct correlation to the death burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ every single driver's license whether they're Muslim whether they're Christian whether they're Buddhist I don't know whatever they might be but there's only one one individual that rose from the dead and that was Jesus Christ there's no other evidence anywhere showing that anybody else actually resurrected from the dead but Jesus Christ amen Easter is the time of year when we remember the biggest most pivotal moment that changed the world forever praise God let's go to the next slide some things are better experienced amen than explained Luke 1 uh Luke 24: 1 to8 now upon the first day of the week very early in the morning they came unto the supper bringing the spices which they had prepared and certain others with them and they found the stone rolled away from the seler and they entered in and found nothing not the body of the Lord Jesus a lot of people go into churches today a lot of people you know there's a lot of churches today that are preaching their own doctrines their own thoughts their own ideas of what Jesus Christ and who Jesus Christ is they'll put them into a trinity they'll put him into a uh uh you know all kinds of oh he was just a great Master he was just a great man that that reached great levels of consciousness I'll tell you those churches that are preaching those kinds of things are like tombs there's nothing in there you're not going to find Jesus in that tomb you'll only find Jesus if you know that he's resurrected and he's alive now amen amen and it came to pass as there were perplexed thereabout behold two men stood by them in shining garments and as they were afraid and bowed down their faces to the Earth they said unto them why seek ye living among the the dead he is not here but is risen remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee saying the son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise again and they remembered his words amen praise God now the Tomb of Jesus had been sealed by a massive Stone it was a stone that was placed there by the Romans and there was absolutely no way that that uh you know a few people could go there and just move that stone it could have weighed a ton or two that's how big it they would use an army of of soldiers and especially the tomb where they laid Jesus because there was Talk Amongst the people that hey wait a minute here we need to be careful because you know there's talk about this this individual Rising again I mean we've had enough trouble we've had enough trouble with him as it is and so we want to make sure that that somebody doesn't go in there and steal the body and make it look like he was resurrected well guess what in Matthew's account we read that it tells us how the stone was rolled away it shows that it was a mighty angel that God sent down because God had a plan God had a purpose there was no way they were going to change God's purpose and Plan of Redemption God had to God had to prepare everything just exactly right and he knew that they would not believe and so the only way that he could overcome their unbelief was to supernaturally do it himself he sent an angel down there because he said he was going to rise he didn't say that somebody's going to come and roll away the the the stone and and steal my body he said I will rise again I'm gonna do this work and nothing no Gates none the not the gates of hell no individual no Pharisees Sadducees no Romans no no teachings of man is going to change what I'm going to do amen he had the listen the stone of unbelief has been rolled away hallelujah it's been rolled away amen and you don't need to be going and running inside the tomb to see if Jesus is in there look what happened the women quickly they they they they quickly rushed off to go and tell let's read the next scripture let's go to the next slide and returned from the supper verses 9 to2 and told all these things unto the 11 and to all the rest it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and other women that were with them which told these things unto the apostles and their words seemed to them as Idle Tales can you imagine here the apostles had Walk With Jesus they talk with Jesus they had witnessed all the Miracles and all the things that he was doing and yet they couldn't believe what what's going on what is that well I'll tell you we're going to get to that because it's the same thing that's happening today A lot of people are being told that Jesus Christ is Resurrected but to a lot of people that oh yes that's nice yes oh did you oh did did you have an Easter hunt at church did you put up the Easter Bunnies that's not what the resurrection is all about it's not about bunnies and eggs but you see the people unless something Supernatural something real takes place it's only just a traditional event and it and they find it hard to believe people you you'll tell people about miracles you'll tell them about things that have happened we've had Miracles take place right here in this church people completely delivered from cancer people made whole from all kinds of different diseases and and sicknesses and and and and mental sickness and and all kinds of situations where God supernaturally delivers you tell the people about it we had one individual that gave a testimony right from this Pulpit that had actually died and Rose back from a a coma she the doctors had said she's she's not going to make it but her mother said no God never showed me that no sir she's going to rise again and the doctor said well that's fine ma'am you can listen to the testimony it's on YouTube amen you want to hear about it just see one of the deacons they'll tell you they'll tell you about the link and you can listen in it was somebody that was right here in this church for many many years amen praise God and and after about seven days while the doctor was there and the mother was there and they were talking and the doctor was checking on her and she was still in a deep coma saying that she was not going to come out of it she opened her eyes and she told the story that it wasn't the appointed time for her yet that's what she was told and I believe every single one of us has an appointed time and season but they thought it was just idle tales and and they believe them not then arose Peter and ran into the SRE and stooping down he beheld the linen cloths laid by themselves and departed wondering in himself at that which had come to pass he knew that the Lord Jesus said that he would rise again but even then it would take more it would take more for them to recognize that that Jesus Christ was actually really alive amen how would you possibly go to you know think about it here you are you're the witness those sisters they went to the tomb there they talked to those Mighty angels that were standing there they they you know uh how do you go back and you tell the people and expect them to believe you would think that they would believe because to you it happened you know the experience that you had and when you tell somebody about your testimony you know your own experience and you and it's a reality to you but but but to others unless they experience it for themselves you see some things are better experienced than explained that's why when Nathaniel was told you know come see come see a man come see when the woman at the well when when when the Holy Spirit when Jesus Christ had discerned her life and told her all about herself she ran into the city and she literally was screaming and saying come see a man that has told me all about my life and has delivered me and you know that from her testimony many had come many came to Christ the whole town many of them were converted to the word of God and your testimony is what this world needs your testimony is what your workplace needs they need to know that you're a living testimony that you have experienced not by knowledge but an experience of Jesus Christ amen glory to God you know like how can you possibly uh you know tell that kind of a story it's something that you need to experience you know I go back when I was young I was about seven or eight years old and I had an experience that I couldn't quite understand and and I finally did understand that after 30 years coming to the Lord but I was about seven or eight years old and I was in a classroom and I remember it's so clear it'll never leave me and you can you know you can go back and think about experiences that you may have had and I was sitting there at a desk in a in a classroom I was looking out the window and all of a sudden a thought came into my mind and said why am I here what is this all about the thought just came into my mind like that and then all of a sudden a euphoric atmosphere came around me that I could I to this day the only way that I know what it was is because now I realized it was the Lord it was God intervening at a young age you know you can go back and you can think about experiences that you may have had where where you know at that moment I felt such Liberty and such Joy everything was just all right I that's all I can remember and and I and I just felt it and then and then it was gone now nobody can ever take that away from me because I experienced it I can explain it to you all day long unless you have experienced that there's no way for you to really know and this is what Easter is Easter is not an event it's an experience of the event in our day amen and so that experience was something that I could not possibly understand and it was not until 30 years later or you know about 20 some odd years later when I came to the Lord in 1994 and it was maybe you know after about the first 6 months that I was serving God I was coming to the church and they would have prayer meetings and I remember driving to the prayer meeting with a friend from the church and I was telling him you know it was wonderful that God has delivered me from the drug addiction by then God had already delivered me and it was a supernatural event but there was no emotional um uh physical other than the fact that that he had just removed the desire for the drugs it was gone I can't explain that you know it's like somebody that was blind and all of a sudden they can see well they can see there wasn't any kind of you know emotional Supernatural you know lights come down from heaven and all these things and and and and you know uh it was just it just took place and I was telling him you know it's it's wonderful that I'm experiencing this Liberty I'm I'm free from this addiction but I said but I want to know him and feel him and see him and touch him I remember saying that I said I I want more I know I've I I've been delivered it was just like you know you go back and and you know what we just read here and there was people that had experienced Christ they had seen you know the reality of of people that were lame and they would get you know their legs would become whole again there was a dead girl and she rose up again they had witnessed those things they had seen those things but they had not experienced it even when he said he would resurrect they would still not believe what is it something more needs to happen something more in the experience needs to take place and it wasn't until that night I couldn't there was nothing that could prepare me for what I was entering into that night on that prayer meeting all I knew is that I had a desire for him and I wanted to to know him in a greater way and in the midst of that prayer meeting we were all just praying we were in the sanctuary and then all of a sudden something took place the atmosphere changed uh people started standing up screaming crying and I thought oh I feel something changing in the atmosphere but still it was it was it was nothing more than what I was hearing with my ears and and I was just kind of sensing but then all of a sudden a presence and an anointing came over me and engulfed me and all I can tell you is that all I was saying was please don't leave me ple that's all that was coming out of my mouth don't leave don't leave the atmosphere and the love that I experienced in that atmosphere in that presence nobody can ever take it away from me God is a reality I experienced God's love you know they called the Toronto blessing that that it was like an outpour ing of God's love because people were experiencing it so much they were crying they were praising God they were worshiping in ways that that you know it got it got uh you know where where people actually started to get ridiculous because without the spirit without an at an attribute of God inside of you that baptism of the spirit of God when it comes on you you know people were acting like dogs acting like cats that like that's not God though the spirit falls on the just and the unjust you see when the spirit comes down it's going to actually show what kind of seed is actually there and if you're a son or a daughter of God and the spirit of God comes down upon you you melt in his presence you feel his love you yeah you can shout you can Rejoice all those things but you're gon to you're going to show the character of Jesus Christ hallelujah praise God amen it's not something that I could possibly explain to you it's all I could do it to to put it into words but I experienced his love and I know that love and that love is what keeps me and I know it's what's keeping every son and daughter of God it was his love that went to the cross and took all your sin that took everything necessary in order to bring you back to him because this is all about a Redemptive plan it's all about him bringing you back to who you really are you're not that flesh and blood that you think that you are inside of there brother Braham talks about how the how God sent the Holy Spirit and the Sun and the anointing it would come upon you know seed that would that that would be covered with stone you know some fell on good ground some fell on on Stony ground you know but the sun came not to burn the stone it came to give life to the seed that was that that was covering that seed amen a lot of us have got a lot of covering on us we're dealing with this flesh and we're having to overcome the things of this life but the spirit of God is coming on that seed that's in you to bring out who you really are amen glory to God Easter changes everything when you encounter the love of God it's not enough just to hear and read the Easter story or to intellectually understand the Easter story but to experience it fully and and and experience that incredible love of when he comes to you personal I've read it said that Christmas was the promise you know that you know everybody say oh the the Messiah was going to come unto us a son is given but that Easter was the proof when that son grew and went to Calvary and Rose and was resurrected again that was the actual proof that he was the Messiah he was God he is God and he's resurrected here today and now for you amen praise God the Apostle Paul writes a prayer to the early Church in Ephesus with this in mind God's love for us is so unimaginable that that Paul prays for them to experience it in its fullness let's go to the next slide Ephesians chapter 3: 16-19 that he would Grant you now pay attention read the word wake up and read the word that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his Spirit we're talking about the Easter experience that only comes by his Spirit you heard the quote that brother brand uh brother Tim read this morning from brother brandom that it that it that it was the the supernatural anointing that was coming down to bring forth who you really are Sons and Daughters of God by his spirit in the inner man that Christ May dwell in your hearts by Revelation that's what faith is that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend now look at this is how he explains it to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth the length the depth the height and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge listen that's why I said I can't explain it to you if you've experienced God's love if you've come to a place where where where where your experience was to the point where you died completely you you you gave up everything for this word you surrendered everything you said Lord I I remember I remember that drug addiction had such a hold of me and and and I remember I didn't want it anymore I desired it for to for it to be gone but it was too powerful it had a hold of me but there had to be something stronger and when you get to that place of desperation in your life and in your walk where you want change and where you don't want that old life anymore you don't want to be controlled by your emotions and by your memories and by the scars of the past there's only one way that you can achieve that you're going to need to experience the love of God that comes when he calls you he says and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in US listen he's able to do there's nothing there is absolutely nothing that he can't take care of it he can't make it better he listen you you need you need a healing this morning he's the Healer he can do it you just got to accept it you got to you got to know that it was already finished when he went to that day it was paid in full that Good Friday at Calvary it was paid in full it's a finish work amen exceedingly above what we ask more than what you could possibly imagine he can do it unto him be glory in the church by what Jesus Christ throughout all ages World Without End it's according to the power that's within us amen praise God there's no greater love than his love and that's my prayer today that you will experience that kind of love I pray that as we remember the Rugged Cross and the nail scarred hands and we remember what he did for us that as we recall that the that the rolled away Stone and the empty tomb that offer that offer us power over sin and death that we would be able to sense how amazing Christ's love is for you we are the reason why he endured all that he endured Eternal salvation and Redemption is the joy that was set before him listen here in in Hebrews chapter 12:2 Jesus looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for joy that was set before him what was that Joy set before him what was it that gave him that kind of overcoming power as a as an in as a human in a human vessel that he would go to the cross it was the joy of knowing that he would get you back it was the joy of knowing that he would have you back looking unto him and despising before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down right now at the right hand the Throne of God he did that for you he he he had to look beyond all of the pain the shame and the sorrow amen it's God love that changed us the truest thing about you is that you're loved from God I'm telling you that's the truest thing you need to accept that you need to believe that he loves you just the way you are and he loves you too much to leave you that way you might say oh I'm in a condition now how could God love me no no he loves you too to much to leave you that way he wants to change you he knows your shortcomings he knows all your blemishes he knows all your pain he knows all your scars but the Easter Resurrection is here today to say it's finished I'm going to I'm going to redeem you I'm going to claim you you're mine he says all that the father ha given will come amen he is aware of your mistakes and sins and this is the very reason for Easter it's what motivated him it was motivated by love praise God for you and me amen he's calling your name can you recognize it this morning can you hear him calling you through through the cross can you recognize that he he he's not going to he's not going to compromise anything to get you back amen praise God you're blessed let's look at the next slide we're continuing here in Luke 24 and behold two of them went that same day to a village called emus which was from Jerusalem about three score furlongs and they talked together of all these things which had happened and it came to pass that while they con commune together and reasoned Jesus himself Drew near you know you you Fellowship around the word you talk about Jesus you you know you get to talk about Jesus with your family and your friends you know he draws near he wants you to talk about him listen here he says he drew near and went with them but their eyes were Holden that they should not know him you see God knows exactly the right time that he's going to call and and intercede in your particular life you might think well you know I I looked back and I said Lord I was 33 years old why did you wait 33 years to come into my life because he has a purpose with your past he has a purpose with your sin he says I come at that time because I need you to experience what it is to be forgiven you need to know me in the power of my forgiveness and my deliverance and my ability to to do things for you that go beyond what you think is possible and he said unto them verse 17 what manner of communications are these that ye have one to another as ye walk and are sad imagine these were disciples that had been with Jesus Jesus knew that they had been with him yet they were sad you know a lot of people they're they you know I'm a Christian but they're sad Christians they're you know they're they're they're they're you know they're Sunday Christians when you see them on Sunday they're glad if you happen to run into them on Monday or Tuesday they might be mad you know they're getting mad at work they're getting mad at the boss they're getting mad at their friends that's not true Christianity now I'm not saying you've got to be some fairy that oh Jesus saved me Hallelujah going to going to work and and and telling everybody and rebuking everybody and telling them that that they've that you know quit that smoking that smoking you're going to go to hell because of you're smoking they're not going to go to hell because of they're smoking there's only one way that anybody goes to hell and that's rejecting Easter rejecting the resurrected Christ the purpose and the reason that he came to this Earth so that he could give you and impart his life on you amen glory to God Amen let's go to the next slide praise God now as we read on I'm going to read here if you want to follow me in your Bibles that's fine I didn't put up the whole you know the the whole chapter when you go home I want you to go back and read this chapter and read it with the understanding that you that you've now taken from from these thoughts that have been coming forth here because the thought that I'm bringing here is listen the stone is rolled away and Easter changes everything amen in other words going back into the tomb going back to look for the stone and to go inside the tomb to find Jesus that's not going to do anybody any good anymore the tombs are are all the old churches you know they they want to make shrines about Jesus they want to have all kinds of pictures of Jesus in their churches but they've got Jesus the son here they've got Jesus the father over here they got Jesus the Holy Ghost over there they got the mother Mary over here they got St Christopher over there there if there's a Saint Christopher he's right back there because he's still alive sure there's individual those were those were saints that that that that were alive at one time but now that they're dead we don't pray to the dead there's no intercessor between man and God but Jesus Christ that's the word of God there is no other mediator he was the one that went to the Cross who went to the Cross was it Mary or Jesus it was Jesus who died for your sins was it Mary or Jesus Jesus Oh but but Mary can can get you to Jesus no she can't Mary is your sister Mary is is is another individual that was blessed of course we've got to recognize her position in the word of God she was blessed amongst all women to carry the body of Jesus Christ that God would come and dwell in but then she was she came to recognize herself that she needed to be uh filled with the spirit of God Amen because she would weep and cry she didn't want her son to go to Calvary no mother would want their son to go to Calvary as a mother you know in the natural but she was a supernal body that God used to build the body of Jesus Christ in we love Mary she is our sister and we are going to Rejoice with her and she's going to tell us her story just like you're going to tell your story we're going to Rejoice together Sons and Daughters of God rejoicing together around the throne I don't read anywhere in the scripture where it says Sons and Daughters grandchildren grandsons can anybody show me a scripture on that I only see Sons and Daughters period and one father the heavenly father the Lord Jesus the Elohim the beginning and the end the logos the thought of God just was expressed into the form of a son but it was Jesus Christ was God he said I am the father are one if you've seen me Phillip you've seen the father praise God and this here now you know if if if you read on and I'll read a little bit here and behold two of them um let me go on here Verse 18 and the one of them whose name was Copus answering said unto him art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem and has that has has has thou not known the things which are come to pass there in these days and he said unto them what things can you imagine he's asking them what things he wants to know what you know he wants to know your experience because you're complaining you're dealing with things in your life you're you're overcoming circumstances in your life and Jesus was supposed to be the answer well I went to church and Jesus was supposed to be the answer but things have gotten worse my family is rejecting me because I'm now believing God's word and telling them about you know doctrines of man and and and man's teachings and all kinds of you know trinitarian doctrines and everything else and in the Bible it's so clear exactly here and I'm reading it I'm I'm reading it like like it's because God has given you the ability God has opened your eyes he opens and no man shuts he shuts no man opens you need to realize that this is something personal this is something that's to you it's God and you God and you it's not about you and your church and God it's about God becoming a reality to you personal so here he wants to know what things and they said unto him concerning Jesus of Nazareth and they went on and they were talking about the you know the the prophet and the mighty Deeds that he did you know and but uh you know and and he would he was condemned to death and then you know but we trusted that you know that it had been uh uh he which should come and you know he was supposed to redeem us and he was supposed to you know uh you know bring you know Israel back to her her position and he was our king and you know they and they were talking about all of these things why were they saying all those things because they didn't believe they didn't didn't believe they didn't they didn't experience the resurrection yet there was something more that had to take place and there's more to your experience if you're not if you're not experiencing Christ from the point where you know that you know that you know then you need to go further there's something more that God has for you that's going to open your understanding and here now you know they go on and you know and then he goes on to say in verse 22 he says in the third day since these things were done and you know where is he in other words you know here they're here they are they're talking to the Lord Jesus himself they don't know that because he he didn't reveal himself to them yet but he wants them to to experience the reality of being a human and then being awakened by the spirit of God because as we go on and they found and they found not his body they came saying that they had also seen vision of angels they're telling them all these things but it was it was because there was unbelief in their experience and there's a lot of Christians that'll that'll read these stories that'll listen to these stories but they're not really believing the story it hasn't become a reality to them yet and if you go on and as we read on now Jesus he says to them and and then and then he goes on to them and he said unto them oh fools after they had explained everything that had happened and and they were basically saying to him you know we don't believe it because we haven't seen it he turns and says you're a fool and slow to heart not to believe all that the prophets had spoken people need to read their Bibles people need to go back and look Jesus started and and entered into his listen he says ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory question mark and beginning at Moses and all all the prophets he expounded unto them all the scriptures of things concerning himself you see if you don't go back to Genesis and read all the Genesis Moses he says he went back to Moses well Moses is the one that wrote Genesis and he was telling them about all the things concerning himself when the Jews talk about the Passover they're talking about the Passover they're talking about Easter they're talking about the death angel that would that that is taking every individual that has not applied the blood to their lives Jesus Christ is that sacrifice he is the blood that you need to accept the sacrifice that was given to you 2,000 years ago amen he started to expound to them everything about himself in other words he was bringing them back to the word he was trying to get their thinking out of some traditional day called Easter get them out of their traditional way of thinking about Easter it's Easter isn't it we're talking about Easter today but but you're hearing it a little bit different I hope it's not about somay it's about an experience he was trying to get them to look back into the word of God and to recognize that from Genesis all the way to Revelation it's his story it's all about Jesus Christ the Messiah the lord of the Old Testament is Jehovah of the New Testament it's the same God it's always been Jesus Christ amen and he wanted them to recognize it by the word he wanted them to see it through the word and he went on to talk to them and you know then they they they uh they came to a they came to the place where they had to go and then Jesus was going to leave but then they they constrained him and they said Lord no come and stay with us you know they knew that that that that that something different about him because their hearts were burning and when you hear about the word of God if it's just something if this is just another sermon this morning and you're just you know you're feeling sleepy it's because something real is is is needed still there's a resurrection that needs to take place on the inside of you that's going to bring out the reality of Jesus Christ amen and they and and they so so something started that and they invited him in and it was then that you know that he opened up their eyes in verse 31 and their eyes were opened and they knew him because he took some bread which is a type of the word and he started to open the word to them he started to unveil the word to them but it wasn't still enough oh no it wasn't enough though their eyes were open and they could recognize oh no oh now I see him but they were looking at the physical Jesus they were thinking that that now he's going to do what he said he was going to do now he's going to he's going to oh he's back so now he's going to go in he's going to go into into the Roman Kingdom there and he's going to bring his angels with him and he's going to destroy everything no that's not the plan of redemption that's not what the scripture said amen they wanted him to be the same person that he was not realizing that no they needed to Jesus goes on and tells them and and goes on to say to them I'm going to go right down he says here and behold he says now wait verse 47 and that no I'm going to go back to verse 46 and said unto them thus it is written and thus it behooves Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and the repent and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem and ye are my Witnesses of these things and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but te ye in the city of Jerusalem until you are endued with power from on high so you mean he rose he came out of the Tomb he he revealed himself he showed himself uh they saw him they then the word word began to open and their eyes were opened as they as he was breaking the word to them but he says but wait he says you still need to receive power you still need to receive the resurrection power you've heard about the mechanics now you need some of the Dynamics now you need to experience the power behind a real Christian walk something that changes you that you'll never be the same and Easter will not be in the month of March or in the month of April Easter will be right now every single day of your life because there's a power in you that's constantly overcoming the the the the trials of this life and the sin of this life and the situations that you're dealing with and having to face as a human right as a human he says and he led them out as far as Bethany and he lifted up his hands and blessed them and it came to pass while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into heaven and they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy they also returned to Jerusalem with expectation that they were going to receive a power and an anointing that was going to change their lives for good amen amen I remember that day I was listening to Pastor Simon and he was preaching on the Holy Ghost and it was just a few months that I'd been going there maybe two months and I remember and then there was an altar call and I went running to the Altar and I knew that that addiction still had a hold of me and I went to him and I said pastor when I when I went up and I stood before him I said I want the Holy Ghost I said I need the Holy Ghost because I realized that that was the only Power that could deliver me and he looked at me and he says brother you got the Holy Ghost the fact that you are so on fire and your life is being transformed the way it is he says you only need to bury that old life that's all you need to just bury it once and for all put it to death once and for all that's why baptism is only an outward expression it's something that happens that when you come to that reality of the resurrection of Easter in your personal life you will run to the water to leave that old life and you want to bury that old life listen I came out of that water all I knew is that that that I felt completely different I felt clean that's all I can explain to you I just felt clean like I i' had a really good shower amen but and then all of a sudden you know the next day there was just no desire like the thought of drugs you know cocaine was going through my head every single day because it had a hold of me it had me Shackled I couldn't wait to get to the next Service never mind cocaine I I experienced a high that was so much higher than cocaine it was so much greater it it answered all my questions it took away all those desires I couldn't wait to get to the word because it was like it was like a living water it was it was feeding me I just couldn't get enough with the word I'd be at home reading the Bible my wife would look at me thinking what's come over you where are you going I'm going to church it's Tuesday night I said yeah I'm going to church I said do you want to come no took a while took a lot of prayer Friday night Thursday night where you going prayer meeting prayer meeting what's that a lot of people don't know what prayer meetings are Sunday morning where you going I'm not going to work I'm going to church because if I go to church work is going to get taken care of you see when you come into that reality with God the Resurrection becomes a reality through an experience not through somebody explaining it to you not through somebody trying to convince you but an actual reality of Christ it changes everything Easter changes everything when you come to this amen so he tells them now watch go to the next slide now I'm going to go back here and John 7: 3 uh verse 37 to39 sorry that extra 37 shouldn't be there it says in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink that's what he told the woman at the well I'll give you a drink you'll never thirst again and I promise you you drink Christ in the present stage of his ministry which is him now him now where would you have been back in the days of Jesus would you have been following him based on your experience right now would you have been looking for his next place where he was going to preach where you could go and witness and hear him speak would you would you been there with with just 12 that were following him all the crowds were like who is this heretic over here all the high powers and the and the and the governments just like the governments today the World Council of churches they are all coming together so that they can bring together and and control and bring everything Under One Roof you'll never bring Jesus Christ Under One Roof he is one body and the only way you get into that body is he calls you into that body it's not him in being invited into your church it's about you being invited into him into the body of Jesus Christ the reality of God and here he says if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water but this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not given what it wasn't given yet you see they had heard they had they they you know they've been going to church for many years a lot of you been going to church for many years even into this church but there's something that has to take place in your experience where the Holy Ghost awakens you out of your Amnesia because if you're a son or a daughter of God you always were it's just that there is a time and a season for everything and in that time and SE that's why God waited 33 years for me I don't know how many years he's had you know he waited for you brother how many years he waited for you sister I don't know everybody's got a testimony everybody's got a time and a season where God is going to come and he's going to call that attribute he's going to let that that that Dynamic quickening spirit that came forth on that day uh that came walking out of that tomb and never looked back he's looking for those attributes he said all that the father hath given me when he talks about the father he's talking about himself Elohim the one who created everything and he was a part of that plan Jesus was the word made flesh and you are words attributes words that are now coming into manifestation let's read on here he says for the Holy Ghost was not given yet because that Jesus was not yet glorified and even when he came out of the Tomb and he appeared to them he was not yet in his full complete glorified condition until he came down and he revealed himself to the apostles in Matthew 28:19 and he came down and they were all there when he said all power now listen to me he says all power has been given now unto me I'm now in that glorified condition amen praise God go ye into all the world baptizing them in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit praise God they knew the name they understood what he said Peter on the day of Pentecost knew the that it was the Lord Jesus that's why we baptize in that name praise God they recognized but he said now listen here he was not yet glorified but understand here now let's go to the next uh scripture here or not scripture but I got a quote here and I want you to see here the importance of that event that took place in Acts 238 where they where they or in Acts two where they had to go to the upper room to wait for the Holy Ghost they had to wait to receive and there may be some of you that are just you know you've been in a situation and you're just not yet there well I'm telling you there's there's a there's a Next Level there's a Next Level to this and and if it's God's time if it's if it's the season that he wanted me to bring this for individuals that are here or individuals that are out on on on the live stream wherever they may be they might want to hear this he says and when so the Bible is manifesting again like in the early days of Christ see cuz you are a predestinated seed just like Christ was when Christ came to the Earth he was the word when they said a virgin shall conceive Mary was the word being made flesh in her day conceiving the body of Jesus Christ then his name Shall be Called Jesus and he was the word and he was made flesh God was made flesh in Jesus Christ so just like you like Christ was a seed that needed the anointing to come on him in that particular time and season you need the anointing to come on you you need that resurrection power to come on you you take a seed and you leave it on a shelf it'll do nothing but you place it into the right atmosphere and at the right time under the light of God's anointing and it brings forth life whatever is in that seed is going to come forth if there's a son or a daughter of God it's going to come forth if there's children of the disobedient one because the Bible talks about the children of the disobedient Cain's children they're not under the lineage of Christ they did not come through the lineage of Adam we'd have to go like that's a whole different teaching right there but there was two seeds there was serpent seed and then there was God seed seed and so if it's serpent seed that's why you got people that are atheists and they say I don't believe it and I'll never believe it because there's no seed in them to believe it so don't be trying to pull people into church and get the force them into the church listen into the church it's a net the word of God is a net and it brings forth all kinds of different things into the net you're going to get rainbow troat and you're going to get serpents and you're going to get scorpions but God is looking looking for his rainbow trout the rainbow trout will be able to take the light of God's word that predestinated seed and when the rain falls on a seed the life produces itself when the Holy Spirit Falls when it fell on those seed that Jesus said he chose them when be you're chosen not today you were chosen before the foundations of the world your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life it's just an appointed time and season for you to come and all that hear the shepherd's voice my sheep they hear my voice and they will come he said so don't worry you don't have to force anybody I'm not forcing anybody to come to church you're coming because you have an experience or you're leaving because you don't it's as simple as that before the foundations of the world and they were predestinated seed is that right amen then they haul themselves up into the upper room these seeds the word now he's calling those individuals were the word and the Word was laying on there without life in it they needed all of a sudden there came a sound from Heaven as the waters begin to gush down and it actually filled all the house where they were setting and the seeds begin to grow it begin to manifest itself the word of God being manif ested do you do you see now that you're not just a Christian you are the word of God being manifested in your day and that's why you live different that's why your experience is according to the word because the word says that all that are in Christ are going to be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye and we shall be translated out of this dimension into another dimension and the world goes into Great Tribulation and then we come back again for a thousand years but we come back in new brand new bodies kind of like this brother's body right here you see how young he is full of life and full of vigor like just like Samuel over here nice big muscles come back with a brand new body and we're we're going to have to live here for another thousand years but we're going to live different it's going to be a thousand years of Peace amen praise God let's go to the next quote here it is the rising of the Sun and he says and now see now you are already resurrected the day you recognize this word something quickened in you you you you became resurrected when God raised him up which was Christ he raised you the sun is just now on you and now you're growing into a blossom life like he was to be resurrected completely in that last day that's the Rapture that's the body it's it's the body of Christ that goes in the Rapture it's not a whole bunch of individuals that are in all these different churches it's those that come into the body I'm not saying it's this church I'm telling you it's the mystical Supernatural Natural Body of Christ in every church I don't care where they are you've got three kinds of Believers you've got a make believer you've got an unbeliever and you've got a True Believer in every Church the true believers have entered into that relationship they realize he was to be resurrected completely in that last day your potentials you have now what do you know your soul changed didn't it your body come in obedience to it didn't it in obedience to what a church the word which is the life then you are now resurrected from the dead amen we said it earlier we're listen all the churches out there that are you know there's thousand different church denominations they're all places if they're not preaching the unadulterated pure word of God they're just dead places they're just places where people gather you might as well walk into a cemetery because they're leading you to all kinds of man's teachings and doctrines you try to tell them wait you you need to be baptized you don't baptize babies you baptize as an adult knowing that you want that old life gone and you go into the water not that you take an innocent baby that doesn't know that it's born in sin shaped in iniquity by the time it's two years old it's going to be lying its teeth off because you're born under that that that that that character you were born in sin because of the original sin that took place in the garden and that's why you must be born again the word which is the life then you are now resurrected from the dead it is Easter with Jesus and I it's Easter with you and Jesus and it's Easter with you I and Jesus we are all or Jesus you and I we are all resurrected together you see once you come into that Supernatural mystical body you're in Christ next slide it is the rising of the sun because I live ye live also let the musicians come speaking to his wife because I live you live also what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus by God's quickening power amen we've read it over and over over again if the same

away all sin he doesn't differentiate between the sin of smoking or the sin of murder Paul was a murderer and yet he wrote most of the New Testament because he was converted to this word he was he the the the the word that was in him had to come out and it finally broke through the stone it finally broke through all the scars it finally broke through all the teachings and all the the the the the the generational things that had been placed upon him to know and like he said to know him in the power of his resurrection Galatians 2:20 next slide I am crucified with Christ I am identifying right now that that when he died I died I'm identifying with that that because it was my sin that he took nevertheless I live not yet not I but Christ liveth in me you see that's the Revelation now it's not you anymore once you've received Easter in the fullness in the power that that in the Dynamics of his word it's no more you anymore it's not you having to try to overcome things it's him now in you

his body that's what this is all about Saints Easter was about him coming to his body a many membered body Christ is the word we all know the anointing is Christ that comes on the word that makes the word live is that right amen that is the anointing that's the Dynamics that's the supernatural power that that we've been telling you about that it's an experience it's better experienced than
