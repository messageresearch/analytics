TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good sunday morning to everyone with joy we come into the presence of the lord and we are here to draw fresh water from the wells of salvation may the joy of the lord be our strength may the lord bless us as we fellowship with him and with each other as we sit around stand around believing wherever we are in our homes in the street in our cars or in our churches wherever we are may the word of god speak to us and may we respond to him and say yes lord i'll say yes yes yes amen praise god now i shall certainly read from the word of god as i speak on change in the bible matthew chapter 27 verses 51 to 53 and behold the veil of the temple was rent in twin from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks rant and the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept arose and came out of their graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared to many thank god gracious loving heavenly father we thank thee lord for the reading of your word we pray now father that you will now as the soil is prepared may the seed of life find a resting place that it might bring forth fruit in jew season for thy glory and honor bless us each one open the eyes of our hearts lord god we ask this in no other name but in the name of jesus christ i thank god i've been changed my life has been changed by the great holy spirit and i trust that as we speak on this a wonderful subject here today in line with what we have already spoken then you will find god by his grace will be able to bring about a change in your life a total uh transformation or as i may say may god give you an extreme makeover of course we realize friends that the word is now in the bride the word that was from the great mighty angel that went to the seventh angel who gave forth a shout the shout was believed and received within the hearts of believers as a result of the shout being received in the heart of the elected that shout has now become his voice within us thus in the church ages brother branham made it clear the bride is now she has the voice of god and she knows what to do with the word why because she got it by revelation and now she is the final voice in the fine of this final age and we thank god that his voice is in us now we take the lord god the same voice that roared with seven thunders uttering their voices it was really one voice the voices of the seven messengers of the seven church ages combined saying the same thing one adding to the other to the other one great roll of thunder and the voice of god comes forth and now that voice is sundering through the bride of jesus christ that is the voice of the resurrected christ raised from the dead and a lie forevermore praise god and he is speaking through his bride not in the form of jesus christ back there but in the bright form or in the form of a bright church multiplied speaking through them voices voices voices from half of the throne voices from the throne of god that is within their hearts so the voices which is the voice make up the voice all the voices thousands of living voices combined together around the world africa india china wherever the voices are elected are when those voices are combined together in unity it is the roaring voice of the lion of the tribe of judah the voice of jesus christ voice of the second adam speaking his word now you say brother simon the voice is now in the bride yes the spirit is now speaking through the bride hallelujah for the spirit speaks through the prophet hallelujah and now the bride vocalizes hallelujah the word of god listen brother bobby roark a precious brother i know preach a wonderful message giving voice to the word and that uh basically the bible written it's written here but when you take it in your heart and you are anointed by the holy spirit and you speak it to someone or some group or crowd again then you are giving voice to the word the word then has a voice by using you o praise god forevermore may god help me to surrender my all may god help us all to surrender our all to him that we may give his word a mighty voice oh glory to god now in the book of ephesians paul tells us clearly you you in particular had he quickened i thank god that his spirit has quickened us and so we are now already in a condition of experiencing god's quickening power of transformation hallelujah getting us ready or coming into readiness for the rapture and for the resurrection coming in a position of total deliverance where we can have complete deliverance praise god and i tell you friends that as time goes by or as time permits we find out that we will be permitted by god like these disciples and saints in the new testament where the bible tells us in the scripture that we just read that when the word was resurrected or restored back again when the word was restored or resurrected what happened the graves were opened and the saints as i've preached the fourth time that were in satan's prison house they were set free by jesus christ who took the chains and took them captive and brought them out of the prison house and so when he raised they raised and the bible tells us they started to appear in the streets of jerusalem oh and the saints begin to see them and they would appear and they would disappear and for 40 days supernatural happenings of supernatural appearances and disappearances of prophets patriarchs great men of the bible women of the bible appearing and disappearing and listen and the saints the disciples could see them could recognize them of who they really were praise god hallelujah oh brother sister i thank god right now that because this word is being preached around the world by various ministers many are raised many are being raised up out of their dead sleep of death spiritual death and they're being raised up into life to walk with jesus christ and to take their position with him and so hallelujah we see the same thing now taking place spiritually as one by one we gain the portals oh praise god the open door of the portals of god's word opening up and saints are beginning to walk in and recognize their day the message for their day the messenger for their day the one god eternal hallelujah they're recognizing many hidden mysterious truths that were in the bible that they don't want you to know but is now revealed praise god by the great wonderful holy spirit through the messenger amen has brought back the word to us and now the holy spirit is sending forth the word in great power and in revelation that man might come to know him the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah praise god what happened when those saints began to appear those patriarchs began to appear in the streets of jerusalem those disciples were allowed by god or permitted by god to look into the fourth dimension they were able to look into the next dimension and to be able to see hallelujah beyond this curtain of time listen the curtain was tore in the temple and that quentin that closed the people away from god now god tears the curtain of time and is now granting again to his people young men shall see visions old men are going to begin to dream dreams and upon my handmaidens upon the sisters i will pour out of my spirit saith the lord all glory to god god's spirit would be poured out upon his people amen oh praise god to recognize their day their messenger their message their hour their time that this is raptured time now this is not just churchianity this is not just my friends name blasphemous names but this is my friends raptured time this is resurrection time this is the great time when the god of heaven is once more amongst men or praises marvelous name praise god hallelujah amen i'm so happy brother branham made it clear you believe that word we begin to worship in the spirit of the word we begin to glorify him in the spirit of the word he said and then suddenly maybe one day suddenly a sweep will go over you and before you know it you're you're traveling like a thought hallelujah oh praise god and before you know it you're in the presence of the living god we can be here and in another moment we're there absent from the body paul said present with the lord oh glory to god yo oh my brothers let me say this you could be in your living room sitting you can be outside listening watching on your tablet your your computer and all of a sudden your neighbors looking over and one moment you're there and the next moment you're not because don't look for john because he's gone the holy spirit has caught him away just like how he caught philip and moved philip into the desert that was just on earth but now another move is fixing to happen this one will be the move from art to glory amen amen i got to prepare a place for you that where i am you may be also a man praise god and so brother sister the holy spirit is working towards that to fulfill that promise of the word of god that he would not leave us but that he will take us to where he is praise god a sweep go over you all of a sudden the spirit of god drops on you all of a sudden the anointing moves within your soul praise god you're in prayer all of a sudden a sweep rolls over you you're traveling like a thought amen and before you know it you're in the presence of the living god hallelujah amen praise god glory to god amen some many years ago brother branham had a buddy friend a wonderful brother who had the fate for healing and miracles in the midst of the people his name is recognized in christian circles brother fred bosworth brother bosworth a man of faith that god used in a marvelous way and brother branham tells the story of when brother bosworth was old and now bedridden and how that the time had come for him to go and to meet the lord but days before his actual departure from earth to glory they heard him begin to say oh hi uncle and he began speaking to his uncle as if he's right in the room and uh and then he'll come to himself and says where's uncle gone and they say he's not he wasn't here he said yes he was he was right here see brother bosworth while he is yet alive was crossing into that dimension and god was allowing him to see his loved ones he saw his mother his father begin to see his cousins talking with them they could hear him talking with those people oh glory to god amen and as he began to talk with them my friends after a while a few days passed and then he slipped away and went to the presence of the lord with a marvelous smile upon his face may god fill our hearts with joy help praise god that we can go into the presence of god now or whenever he wants to call us with joy and faith and peace within our heart their death has no fear holds no fear for us anymore praise god because absent from the body we're present with the lord when he calls me i will answer and i'll be somewhere listening for my name praise god why was that story or that incident told to us within the message of the prophet pointing to us that the same kind of experience that he had we would be able to experience the same thing maybe not every one of us but god will allow many of us to have glimpses of eternity just like brother branham tells in his wonderful sermon which i hold within my hand beyond the curtain of time and he tells how one morning god spoke to him he said i play i was laying on my bed and i had just a walk from sleep and i placed my hands behind my head and relaxed with my head on the pillow then i began to wonder what it would be like on the other side i realized that i have lived more than half my life if i lived to be as old as my people and i wanted to do more for the lord before i left this life and then i heard a voice saying you are just starting press the battle press the battle keep pressing keep pressing as i lay there pondering those the words i thought i had just imagined hearing a voice and the voice said again press the battle keep going keep going keep going and still unbelieving i thought possibly i have spoken the words myself and i placed my lips between my teeth like that and held my hand over my mouth and i listened listened again and the voice spoke again just keep pressing keep pressing the battle oh if you only knew what whets you at the end of the road amen hallelujah he said i then remembered an old song i'm so homesick and blue i want to see jesus i would like to hear those harbor bells chime it would brighten my path and banish my fears oh lord let me look past the curtain of time then the voice spoke again and said would you like to see just beyond the curtain and i answered it would help me so much what happened i cannot say whether i was in the body or out of my body or whether it was a translation i do not know but it was unlike any vision or anything i had ever had i could see the place to which i was taken i could see my sight self lying back there on the bed and i'm gone somewhere else i said that this is a strange thing and when i looked there were great numbers of people that came running to greet me crying oh our precious brother our precious brother first came young women in their twenties amen oh our precious brother young men of brilliance in the brilliance of their manhood eyes glistening like stars and teeth as white as pearls saying o our precious brother our precious brother then i notice that i had become young again myself oh i looked at myself and turned and looked back at my old body laying on the bed back there but here i was young again oh blessed be god brother sisters we all will be made young again to never grow old oh my as i began to comprehend the place where i was i began to realize in this place there is no yesterday there is no tomorrow no and we never got tired multitudes of them began to say oh our precious brother and greet me with overwhelming love i only discovered that there was only great love no physical attractions there as in the human behavior i notice that the women wore their hair down and their skirts were down to their feet then the voice spoke again this is what you preached that the holy ghost is this is perfect love nothing can enter here without it next i was taken up and seated on a high place all around me were great numbers of men and women shouting crying oh our precious brother we are so happy to see you here and i thought i'm not dreaming how can i see these people how can i look back and see my body lying there and the voice spoke again it is written in the bible that the prophets were gathered with their people and i go oh my yes i remember the voice i asked uh are these all branhams the voice replied these are not branhams hallelujah but these are your converts the ones that you led to the lord some of these young women you think are so young and beautiful were more than 90 years old when you led them to christ oh glory to god hallelujah amen old old women old men when he looked at them he saw them young just 21 years or so oh my and he could not recognize who they were and the holy spirit the angel had to make him know those were your converts that were 90 years old and now they are here they are changed by the power of god hallelujah resurrection power wrap your power change them completely and now here they are past the curtain of time amen glory to god amen oh listen these are your converts ones that you have led to the lord amen no wonder they are crying out my precious brother hallelujah and the multitude cried out together if you had not gone forth with the gospel we would not be here or blessed be the name of the lord or brother sister wouldn't that be a joy within my heart when i go into the presence of god if god will with the people that god has helped me to lead to jesus christ will be able to say brother simon if it was not for you and your preaching of the word we would not be here in the presence of the living god in heaven i asked brother branham speaking now where is jesus i want to see him the voices the people said he's just a little higher someday he'll come to you he you were said to be a leader from there on earth amen and when god comes he'll judge you according to your teaching whatever you're teaching he'll judge you by your teaching oh my then our teaching better be on the word then are teaching me exactly what god says then are teaching up to be straight in line with this bible and with the revelation of the word that god has given and is given giving to us and then brother branham answered and said does pete paul and peter have to stand in the judgment also and the answer was yes and i said i have preached what they preached i did not divert from one side to the other where they're baptized in jesus name i baptized in jesus name hallelujah where they taught baptism in the name of jesus i taught the same thing too amen whatever they're taught i thought because amen oh praise god we know the people said and we know that we are going back to earth with you sometime jesus will come and judge you according to the word you preach to us then you will present us to him and all together we will go back to earth to live forever do i have to go back to earth now and they answered yes but you must keep pressing on as i begin to move from that beautiful joyful place amen you see as far as my eyes could see i saw multitudes of people coming towards me crying oh our precious brother our precious brother and suddenly i found myself on the bed again i said oh god help me never let me compromise with the word not one of us ought to compromise with this word not one of us should swerve this way or that way but stay right with the word and on the word of the living god hallelujah amen let me stay straight on the word lord i don't care what anyone else does lord but let me press on to that beautiful and joyful place i am more convinced more than ever in my life that i will take it will take perfect love to enter that place there was no jealousies there there was not tiredness there there was no sickness there there was no old age there no yesterdays not tomorrow there was no death there there only supreme beauty and joy was there whatsoever you do saints lay aside everything else until you get perfect love within your heart amen get to where you can love everybody even your enemy no matter if the plane is rocking the lightning is flashing or the guns of the enemy the devil is turned upon you these things down here don't matter get perfect love if you are not saved say accept jesus christ as your savior if you're not being baptized in water be baptized in water in the name of the lord jesus christ hallelujah oh my the baptism of the holy spirit may god open your eyes fill you with this person fill you with his word and open up your understanding in this day and in this hour amen press on press on right into perfect love hallelujah which will take you to that beautiful and joyful place beyond the curtain of time amen praise god friends perfect love will take you to that beautiful and joyful place beyond the curtain of time god once again as he did with brother bosworth with brother branham with the saints in matthew 27 god will allow some of us to have glimpses of glory be able to look into eternity whether by vision by dream by translation oh my but the holy spirit is here in this last day to be with his people and to unfold the mightiness of his word and of his presence to us amen praise god paul said behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed glory to god some people paul is saying here but we i show you a mystery we shall not all die we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed change while you're alive and while you're alive god will help you anoint you change your your vision change your hearing change your entire nature your being that you may be able to look past the curtain of time we may we will not not be able to see like the brother branham saw but i'm talking about glimpses of glory i'm talking about glimpses into eternity i'm talking about you god anointing you pulling the scales of this world and of time from off of your eyes that you could look past the curtain of time and recognize what god has done and what god is doing first thessalonians 4 we which are alive and remain shall be caught up and so shall we ever be with the lord how wonderful that while we are alive the holy spirit is starting to catch us up in the mystery in the revelation of his word who praises marvelous and wonderful name may every one of us no matter what problems what trials what situations come our way what sickness what pain what old age the aches that come to us we will be able to hear the same voice saying oh keep pressing the battle keep pressing the battle press your way in or praise god until we enter into that beautiful lovely and joyful place there that god has reserved for us praise god now brother sister we realize that god left some of his creation to adam to continue and when jesus was here his cup this ministry was not completed amen remember the bride is part of him so that part of his ministry it is becoming unto her to fulfill all righteousness all of the word of god amen so the bride has to be the continuation of the earthly ministry of jesus christ but paul tells us that he has committed unto us the ministry of reconciliation amen so here we have the ministry of reconciliation what is that that we would be his voice to call the rest of the elected seed that are out there to come back home to god and to be reconciled back to him to have a uniting time with him and to know him not to know the church not to know theology not to know some form of religious knowledge not to be excited because you've been let into some great religious knowledge but that god himself has let you experience his person and his presence by revealing and making himself known to you and lighting up your life and your understanding so that you could recognize him who he is amen and so here we are with the voice of christ the law resurrected one in us calling the rest of the elected seed from the dust of the earth from amongst humanity we are here to call them amen whether they are up in a river whether they're down in a valley whether they're on the mountain top whether they're in a modern climate whether they're down somewhere in the deep south whether they're in the southern countries whether they're in islands of the sea wherever they are in a desert wherever they are in jungles the spirit of god and the knowledge of the lord is covering the entire earth as the waters cover the sea and god in this hour by the voice oh hallelujah of this resurrected christ is calling he's elected back to himself amen and bringing them to himself by the word of god hallelujah jesus christ revelation 10 1 in spirit form has come to earth again and is now speaking out of the bride with that voice the voice of the mighty angel the voice of seven thunders thundering speaking through the voice through the voice of the bride now you say oh i don't see any shaking i don't no but he said i shake the heavens and shake the earth and i'll shake them again by the power of god the holy spirit is doing a spiritual shaking up the holy spirit is shaking the church world the holy spirit is shaking the normal and natural world you praise god you may not eyes may not be able to see it your ears may not be able to hear it but let me tell you devils are coming to a full stop when they hear this word breaks are screeching oh praise god devils are on the run philistines are on the run and we are on the charge led by our five-star general jesus praise god we are not going to let up we are not going to ease up we're not gonna rest like a lot of people rest along the way but brother sister we're gonna keep running we're gonna keep pressing we're gonna keep pressing the battle hallelujah in every way that we can until the lord calls us home oh what an encouraging word from god that we are given this great thing to do amen hallelujah amen praise god let me tell your friends that same voice of the mighty angel of revelation 10 1 is the same voice that spoke out of jesus when he came to the tomb of lazarus and they said master our brother is dead he's he he's four days dead and behold he is tinkered oh we can't we should not he says no roll the stone away he said lord but he will raise up in the resurrection he said i am the resurrection and the life praise god hallelujah the resurrection the rapture is not something it's not just an event the resurrection and rapture is the person of jesus christ hallelujah oh my and he said i am the resurrection i am the life roll back the stone hallelujah and they rolled back the stone when they rolled back the stone the pharisees are looking on now to criticize they're looking on now to have a good laugh they're looking on now you know they're going to make that preacher look so foolish so let him get up there and raise his voice and preach like that and talk all those things and let's see what's going to happen and the bible tells us jesus lifted up his voice last russ come forth and when he said lazarus come forth in the words of that serpent his voice traveled right through eternities right to where lazarus's spirit was traveling back to god and his voice caught lazarus's attention and brought him back from where he was hallelujah and the bible tells us he walked out of that tomb when they saw him they were amazed they were aghast oh praise god some of some of you wherever you are people may be astonished at the change in your life the transformation on your walk in your talk how you change your friends or your chat your friends stay away from you because they don't want to hear that jesus business that one god business that that baptism in jesus name jesus business that prophet business that message business they don't want to hear about the serpent's seed in the garden they don't want to hear the truth of the word of god and so god's word calls for a total separation from all unbelief and sets you free to worship him and to walk in the light of his way that same voice that cried out lazarus comfort that voice is crying out again today doing it through the bride hallelujah while brother branham was here on earth he demonstrated and manifested the voice in him in the form of the third pull the word of god rey bringing a fish back to life again that word of god stopping a storm that was about to take place that word of god moving and saving the sons of sister heavy right that voice of god speaking through the prophet and now that voice is in the bride hallelujah amen that voice was on the apostles as they walked by there was a beggar at the beautiful gate and he asked them for some money but there were poor preachers they were not like these money hungry preachers that you have today they were not like some of these men that all they are is for filthy luca now matter of fact let me it's in the bible read the book of acts silver and gold we have none peter and john told him we are broke silver and gold we have none you just told them we are broke but such as we have we give unto you what did they have the holy spirit what did they have the word of god revealed to them amen rise take up your bed and walk hallelujah and the bible says straight way the man got up took jumped in the air and began to run around and he was healed by the power of god the miracle power of god struck him because the same voice that spoke through jesus and spoke and called back lazarus that same voice was calling this man to rise and stand up on his feet that voice was in the prophet thousands thousands delivered saved and even the dead rays by the voice of god in these last days and that same voice has returned in this bright class of people in this hour and in this time once again to cry out as god will lead us as god will guide us he will tell you when it's not for us to go around thinking we just was speaking speaking but under his guidance under his leadership on his direct command and then watch my friends the word watch what takes place amen hallelujah i want you to know that voice was in peter and john that voice is in us now the second adam is now thundering through his bride amen and the second eve is catching that revelation that's come from him and she is speaking it back amen hallelujah what am i doing here i'm saying what the prophet said i'm saying exactly what he said you can say oh brother simon oh you caught the prophet brother simon you you're just saying yes i am i'm saying what he said with understanding and with anointing of the revelation of the holy spirit that's why i'm overjoyed i'm excited i'm filled with this spirit oh glory to god my wine skin is just filled and all to bursting point with the power of the holy spirit brother sister trust him put your faith in him amen and now we see here friends this bride a class of people is doing the work of god amen because life always originates in and with the man or the male the male is the carrier of life but the woman is the one that manifests that's life and brings it to pass or brings it to life amen praise god a man can have all the children he want in him but without his wife he can't bring that those children to manifestation amen so god god's true church his true bride amen she produces his life once again by the word of god hallelujah jesus said i am the vine you are the branches the vine doesn't bear fruit but the branches bear the fruit oh glory to god he said but without me you can do nothing glory to god hallelujah revelation 10 7 that angels 10 stood one foot on the land one in the sea and shouted time shall be no more what was he saying not that time is uh that that that the world ended but he's saying the seven church ages are now over amen you are now entering into the eighth day you're entering into the new day hallelujah you know what it is seven days one week and the eighth day is actually the first day again praise god and so is it with the church ages the eighth they were back to edenic conditions of the holy spirit in our soul as adam and eve had in the garden of eden with divine enlightenment and revelation of the word of god being restored back by the holy spirit we have been restored back by the holy spirit brother sister to a birth not by sexual relations but abort by divine revelation amen praise god for we have received the literal spoken word seed of god hallelujah and so like eve we receive the message [Music] the message of god to speak new sons and daughters into existence from among the sons of men and that word is in us now amen by faith by revelation we have become the voices or the voice of the resurrection amen we have become living voices hallelujah we're alive and the voice is speaking through us hallelujah that's why jesus said say not in that hour what you shall say but that's your spirit the fathers will speak through you in that hour when you've come before judges governors and people of high that posit those positions he says you won't have to think about it the father will speak through you lord of god hallelujah friends no more do we have to go and be like the old days but now we can speak to the rock by the word of god we can go now and speak praise god no wonder why the holy spirit said why christ speak and go forward trust in god do the right believe them the word of god will materialize before you if you can believe it speak it and believe it and god's word will come to pass amen hallelujah that word of god is now making itself known amen praise god so all the seeds of god from the earth the graves the bodies where they were buried and didn't recognize who they were amen but we have this his own promise my sheep hear my voice amen and i know my sheep and they know me hallelujah how are they going to know him they never heard the voice on earth before but let me tell you god placed something in you from before the foundation of the world that when you hear that real voice of god in this last day never having heard it naturally but something in here will recognize that voice and know that is god speaking to me now that is god changing my way changing my life changing my trajectory of how my lifestyle it's all being changed right where i am oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah i want you to know friends you are now experiencing ah a revelation of recognition of divine recognition of who you are in this hour for the quickening power is now in the bride but that bride is now empowered to speak it and to believe it amen and we do that by the name we carry hallelujah we we we speak it not by just words that that's part of it by the lives we live our lives are speaking chips our lives are speaking voices for the glory of god amen for we are the voice of god in these last days for the word is in the bride as the church age page 172 tells us clearly and we are the final voice to this final age and to god be all the glory all the praise and all of the honor o praise god amen praise god we shall be changed we have changed we are being changed and we will be changed and that is the time we will all embrace total deliverance total freedom no more cheers no more worldliness no more temptations no more of those things anymore for the former things have passed away and we have traveled like a thought on the holy spirit and entered into the presence of the living god amen may god bless you i trust that you subscribe to this i trust that you believe what you are hearing and if you do then repent turn to god if you're a believer be encouraged if you're a believer stir up your joy stir up your vision and look to heaven and home once again and long for jesus and long for that glorious rapture day long for him with joy within your heart let us keep pressing the battle air my friends darkness would fail the glowing skies we look to him and him alone may god bless us all on this marvelous wonderful sunday may we crown this day with joy with gladness within our hearts and look to heaven and home for his glory god bless you my brothers
