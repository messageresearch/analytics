for the Lord my soul doth wait and in his word do I hope my soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning I say more than they that watch for the morning let Israel hope in the

are we like Israel on our Trek to the promised land amen praise God if you read the rest of the chapter you'll notice a heaviness a t a tenderness a tone of repentance the psalmist cries out from the depths wanting to be heard begging for mercy longing for Redemption in his people all the while hoping and waiting on the Lord waiting on the word amen if you've ever wondered uh how you know um if if

we have sister Amanda is going to come and give a testimony for us this morning you may be seated this morning God bless you Saints I Came To Give the Lord praise and thanks I came to give him glory in the form of testimony and in a form of thanks if I the words don't come out it's because I'm still shaken this morning I had to give sister Sheila and her family a lift this morning I got into my truck and Android the Android would not connect I sat in my driveway for 10 minutes I plugged in my charger cuz that usually connects it kept connecting to my husband and would not allow me to put her address in that was the first challenge this morning I called the sister and I said sister I'm on my way I'm sorry on the drive I called brother Anthony and I let him know Android was giving problems I'm sorry it was not intentional for me to miss this morning's practice but I may miss it because I'm running late Justus then I just looked at the time and it said that I would arrive at at the sister's house at 9:39 and the thought that came after I looked at the time was God could still get me here for 10 o' just as the thought came into my mind and I was getting off King making my way onto the link not going fast my truck drifted and was going towards the GU Garden there was nothing I could do in that split two seconds to stop it it didn't swerve and then you know you have where your vehicles just drive off and then you put it back there was nothing I could do but God took the truck and moved it and put it onto the lane there was no wind there was no feeling I did not steer it I didn't change it just like when you go through the snow they tell you turn your your your wheels in the opposite direction when you you're skidding it was not a skid and the ABS never picked it up I averted that I knew that in my heart I do everything to be here because I am always on duty for God and he stood for me and he put me back where I needed to go and I got there and when I got there sister Sheila had to hold me because I was shaking in that Split Second there was nothing I could do God did that for me at the prayer meeting on Friday brother brother Danny ministered prayer

the Lord will bless us all today uh for his wonderful wonderful person that he is amen that last song is just beautiful not only is he is the Great and Mighty One of Israel but he's our God God Amen he's expanded his Dominion beyond the Israelites right down to the Gentiles and we are a part of the Gentile bride we thank the Lord for that God bless you uh please be seated just for a minute um we thank God this morning um I heard from three of the ministers not heard but they called but I could not answer at the time and so I'll talk to them and I get back but I guess brother uh Desmond was in uh one church and the young Pastor from another church that heard the word and is all excited about it he couldn't sleep all night and he said he was crying all night brother Desmond said just weeping weeping because he's caught the Revelation that he's been in the message all these years following it and leading it and helping to lead a church and just when the older Pastor has just retired when I was there and he's taken over right the Revelation breaks on him and so we thank the Lord for his goodness and for his grace everything happens in God's time right so we are a free people we don't worry about anything it's just because of our flesh that we have these worries and stuff but the but the be being that lives on the inside here has nothing to worry about uh it's Eternal it comes from God it it it's it's part of God himself praise the Lord but I'm getting into the spirit of preaching so let me go to to the word itself and then we'll talk one with the other I I pray that God will I just about to say I didn't see over there I was just saying I'm going to pray for brother Tim that the Lord will help him with his pains and maybe he's praying to the Lord to help me with my pains and both of us are praying for help brother Christopher with his pains praise the Lord I spoke with him this morning um he still has the pain he's a lot better but we thank the Lord God that he's brought him out they have identified it uh very much uh what it was uh broken ribs that are now healing so he's still going to have some pain especially with uh when you take a real deep breath but he says when he doesn't do that the pain is not there as much and it's just subsiding but we pray that God will bring him a perfect healing it'll take time but pray God will help him and bring him out of it well this morning as you know I've returned from Africa and maybe I could talk about that but I won't because just to let you know that um about uh last week about uh this week actually about uh Wednesday uh then the Holy Spirit gave this to me and started building on it so I have to dismiss all of that and just get to the word here uh and it's so it it's just just God and how God deals with things and look at the timing of when he's dealing with it praise the Lord God bless you glad to have brother Danny and sister Jennifer back here with us praise the Lord uh we know they had a short vacation you may not know it but uh three days four days by time you relaxed by time the third or fourth day now you relax and your mind come off of everything you have to turn around and go back so I I don't know if that was really a vacation you need something that's a week or more all right or it's not a real vacation so pray the Lord make a way for your brother break Lord make a way for you amen okay we're going to go to our scripture and the scripture that we're going to use uh today uh let me not read it at this time let me just go uh we're going to get it but it's uh uh 1 Corinthians 15: 51-58 praise the Lord for those who are doing the media in the back and in this scripture you will find that uh Paul talks about uh let's look at the first verse please stand behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep we shall be all be changed I'd like to call this The Mystery of the change see the mystery of the change praise the Lord hallelujah let's continue to read in a moment in the twinkl of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and again he presses and we shall be changed amen praise God for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall put on in corruption and this Mortal shall put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the say that is written death is swallowed up in Victory praise God oh death where is thy sting oh grave where is thy victory The Sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ amen isn't that wonderful amen our gracious father as we enter to this uh miracle moment of receiving the word this Supernatural time when you send upon us your word your spirit and your word for the spirit rides on the word and we thank you Father that as the word Goes Forth the spirit of God will go forth and minister to the people Lord and speak Beyond just lit my literal words and give them the unspoken the unwritten father that they might hear Beyond their natural hearing but to uh see recognize what it is you are saying and what it is you want us to know in this hour and in this day and time that we may be better established in the faith knowing who we are and what we were raised up for to thee we give the glory honor and praise be thou great and worthy one in Jesus name amen God bless you praise the Lord so we are here today to talk about the change praise the Lord and Paul calls this change that we are now ongoing it's ongoing but and Paul calls this ongoing change that we are going through he says behold I show you a mystery so he's saying it's a mystery how we're going to be changed one your soul change your body change and the Rapture your total change total Deliverance that's what the Rapture is going to give you but we are now in the process of a change yes for when when the scripture says we shall be changed and in the twinkling of an eye that's the the ending of the change that is the whole thing winding up at that point in time praise the Lord praise God now we know that in I believe it's taloni he begins to speak about this change and he talks about the change uh in the last part of it coming in the part of the Rapture by saying the change will be brought about not by man not by humans not by anybody else no Theologian no instructor no no supervisor no Bishop but the Lord himself amen shall descend with a shout the voice of the Archangel and the Trump of God Hallelujah so we know that that that is what will bring about this change now we know our first part of our change began when we came out of the world maybe you came out of the world and you just joined a church some church doesn't have to be this one but you were in some church you already started on your change just you you didn't know it God already started that process but you we had no awareness of it and we were going from one Glory one stage to another to another until finally we come here into the message of the hour the fullness of the word which is continually changing us until we come to the uh final stage of that change which we know as the Rapture amen amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah so here we are chains coming out of the world coming into a church atmosphere starting to do good deeds being of good service uh of Good Works doing things that would please God and man and touch the lives around around you praise the Lord so we find out that that's the way it was now later we came moved up into another level of that change when we came in contact with this message right no matter what church you were in when you come in contact with this message it lifts you to another height another Dimension it puts you into an entirely different place than you have ever been before you begin to recognize something has happened something is happening I'm being change from Glory onto Glory Hallelujah and I'm starting to believe that one day I'm going to step right into the glory amen because my change is in progress right now glory to God hallelujah and it all happens as the Rapture happens because the Lord himself shall descend with her shout now if you were we're going to use at this point in time Nathaniel in the New Testament how he was a good church man he was a righteous Jew uh kept every word you couldn't touch his life but still he needed somebody to witness to him about the message he needed somebody to tell him about the word he needed to have somebody tell him about jesusall but thank God that he had a friend who was in the message a friend who knew Jesus and that friend didn't keep Jesus uh to himself Jesus was not a secret in his back pocket but he said first of all he called his own brother Andrew called Peter and tell him come and see the Christ Hallelujah I got the word I seen the word I recognize the word and the things the word is doing is getting my faith growing stronger and stronger every dayen and you know Peter came we W talk about him the scripture is right there where he recognized and said I know Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God but now Andrew didn't stop there and said praise God I done my bit I already witnessed I I just LED one person to Christ and and that's over I can relax now because I've done the part no every one of us have got to be wor working for the Lord every one of us has got to talk about the faith that is in us that's another part of your change I'm talking about there now amen so now here it is that he went and he told his another friend a friend he has for him some of us not even told our own family much less some of us haven't even told our own brother our own sister much less to talk about a friend others of us are ashamed we embarrassed we scared to tell the boss to tell your friends about it it's just how you do it you just wait on the holy spirit let him give you wisdom and guidance amen and you'll see how smoothly that word will slip in on them that's the way how Jesus is he'll just stand right beside you and wait until you ask him a question and then when he the way he answers the question recognize there's something back of that Veil Hallelujah there's something about that message that's different from just reading the Bible and not having any understanding amen so I want to encourage every one of you it's not what you think I don't think he will receive it I don't think she will receive it I don't think my mother will receive it when I went to my own parents at first as a young boy of about 16 and said to them I found the the word the message of the hour the prophet of this day and there's only one God and his name is Jesus Christ my parents said the boy is teaching us now the boy is teaching us now we taught him we were teaching him the Bible now he's teaching us amen but she went to bed and God has gave her that gift that she was one that gets visions and dreams and while she is there early ear in the morning she saw a vision of the Lord standing on a rock and the wind blowing his robes moving and hearing voices in the background singing and it was singing one verse of Jesus Keep Me Near The Cross that was long stricken out from the hymn they don't put it in the himm books when it goes on to say Jesus my God I Know Thy Name the thy name is all my trust she didn't need anything else she came jumping out of that bed woke up the whole house I got it I understand now it's Jesus he is God Jesus Is God he's God the Lord hallelujah praise God Amen I baptized them both in water not waiting for a nice uh baptism day we had a a a let me say and we call that a ditch in my country that's just about 10t across amen we call that a ditch that's not even a river but praise God but water was always flowing from the river in and out and they did not wait they don't want to wait the rap chicken come anytime so I baptized them in water in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and they both lived and followed the word of God till the day they left and went to glory amen praise God but you see how important your testimony is you're telling somebody else ear because that is the command that was given to Adam when they came here God said what is your commission multiply and replenish yourself amen and that is our commission here today that we have to multiply ourselves we are not church goers we're not church pew warmers we are here as Believers we are here as Christians when they hit Jerusalem the Bible said the whole Jerusalem was turned upside down Hallelujah why there were on fire with the word of the Living God and God is asking us if this Revelation has really struck your heart you cannot sit still you've got to share it with somebody else amen and not just because I'm even telling you here today but you should be having that desire within your heart that that that you cannot keep this to yourself I don't care who the person is amen praise God oh my at 14 there was a accountant listening to the word of God hallelujah there were doctors there were all kinds of people high and low that were hearing the word of God Amen because we're caught up with the word and the spirit of Christ was upon us amen let that same Spirit be upon you in the name of Jesus Christ glory to God hallelujah amen yes sir I tell you Nathaniel's life was was changed when he answered the call and he came in contact with the Lord Jesus Christ how many believ that amen when Jesus said oh yeah before philli called you uh Andrew called you I I saw you under the victory Oh my he turned around and he says Lord amen he recognized right away the word broke upon Him amen and that brought about his change he came out of churchianity he came out from under Traditions he came out from under the law and he came right into the word of that hour and God asked for the same thing today that when we have caught this revelation we enter with our whole hearts into the word of this hour we not Church goes as I've said before we are not pure warmers we are not to get into uh the church going as a habit or coming to church because your your sister coming to church it's going to look bad if you don't come and she comes or your brother comes your husband your wife comes you don't come oh my let the spirit of God deal with you individually so that you recognize your purpose and your God's plan for you working within your life amen hallelujah now that we met this message the message itself is thus sayeth the Lord to us sir amen do you know the message is your Messiah when he he met Jesus he said you are the Christ you the Messiah I recognize you the message is your Messiah the message this word of the hour is what's going to take you home praise the Lord Nathaniel heard Nathaniel believed and Nathaniel followed is that right yes sir that's what we have to do we hear we be we say we believe it then follow it we said support it give all you got to support it if you really believe it get behind it use your physical energy use your financial energy use your mental energy all your resources spiritual prayer who has to invite you until you come early be in the church uh come in front or stay in your Pew and and pray praise the Lord and ask God's blessing on the upcoming service who has to tell you that when you are on fire with the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit tells you to do that you you start praying you preparing your heart amen who has to tell you to when to fast who has to tell you when to miss a meal or you're going to service this morning I don't want you to take any breakfast just turn up to the service there so that your spirit will be sharp able to receive the word who tells you to do that the holy spirit amen I maybe even talking to somebody that did that this morning and I don't know but the Holy Ghost knows what he's doing amen hallelujah praise God Amen yes sir oh I tell you that Daniel heard and he believed and he followed he followed why because now he's not following or coming because of Andrew's Faith yeah Andrew invited him but when he seen for himself he caught the Revelation and he following based on his own Revelation his own Revelation that he's following the word of the Living God hallelujah praise the Lord and as he followed the message Jesus Christ he began to change every sermon every message was changing him he didn't realize it but every message was changing him every message when you come into the house of God regardless of who is the minister there's really only one voice now the voice uses many ministers but it's one voice and all it's saying is to to to build us up into his stature that we might walk in the uh in the stature of Jesus Christ in the fullness of the word of God hallelujah so we must follow the message and as we follow the message we are in the process of being changed is that right I've said it through the years I mention it once more again saved being saved and the Rapture is the total of your salvation amen you understand right you're saved from original sin you're being saved from uh your own sin they committing right now uh you being saved from that you're still being saved right from that praise God you have the D payment that in totality you will you will be completely but you are being and you will be completely saved by total Deliverance out of the present dimensional atmosphere right that we are living in amen so we are being changed and I know we are being changed you know really let me let let you know I haven't really got to my message yet so so bear with me and have some patience okay uh um we find out that we are being changed because God sent a prophet with a pillar of fire and I believe whenever I come into this into a a a service like this even when I get with a few individuals I can be just talking and at one point when I start talking I can sense the pillar of fire is Right nearby somewhere here praise the Lord and let me tell you something this is not imagination the pillar of fire is not some story we read in the Bible it's not now talking about brother Brenham and the pillar of fire over brother bram's head let let me tell you the same Pillar of Fire is here with us look I was a young man by that time I was 18 years old and I never seen brother Brandon we read about brother Brandon but we never seen him we we never seen any Pillar of Fire but here we are one night around midnight talking about the message standing on a bridge with some bushes behind us out of that those bushes comes that Pillar of Fire just about this size just a ball of fire whirling around and as it goes like that call out to run over to my relatives and said do you see anything I didn't want him to be influenced but why what I was seeing because what I was seeing I could say the thoughts struck me they could you know they'll say you believe that message about Prophet with pfy that's why you're seeing that but we don't see nothing but when I told them look and tell me what you see they said oh my God what is that the whole house woke up and when it was sure that they could see and know that it was Supernatural it went right up into the heavens right into the heavens and just disappeared let me tell you friends there's a living God we don't serve a dead God he don't appear and disappear at our will or at our Command or when we want him to but he comes when he chooses to amen we and he don't want you to believe him because you can see him he wants you to believe him you believe what you can't even see that's real Faith to recognize praise the Lord Prophet said the one who you believe you you never seen him but you feel him within your heart you sense his presence amen one day when he feels us right he will make himself available to every one of us because the Lord himself will descend with a shout not only in the word form but he'll come and we'll be able to see him and Crown Him king of kings and Lord of of Lords hallelujah praise the Lord thank God I think there's a song that we ought to sing right now from glory to glory brother can you put that up is that is that a song right oh praise God hallelujah amen if you got the words we're going to put it up let's start singing it they'll come be they'll follow us from glory to glory help me along change do you believe it changing me he's changing me perfecting me the love of God shown to the world is change do you believe that changing from Earthly things to the heavenly love of God shown to the world isn't that wonderful these things are written already in these songs we were singing them over and over but all of a sudden the Bible itself and all these old songs start coming to life we start recognizing that God was hiding behind the veil and just watching at us waiting for the time when we will wake up and recognize who he is amen praise the Lord and so God brings us to the place of the change now after you know you're in the process of this change you know um let me say it this way and I preached a message on that years ago I was many times you might have been in restaurants where people get up and after they finish eating they pay their bill and after they paid the bill the uh waitress comes to give them their change and they said no no no keep the change praise the Lord and that's what I want to tell you this morning after you've come and the word of God has gone through your life now you are in a position where you've got to keep the change amen preserve the change the Lord help you to keep that change going and let the Holy Spirit continue to work within your life amen praise the name of the Lord Hallelujah be a good son be a good daughter be a good child stay in the presence of the filler of fire so that he in the words of our Prophet can bake the greenness out of you oh my how long you want to stay green and when you stay green you still got bitterness you're green you're still sour you still got all these emotions you you're green your unforgiving spe Spirit uh you stay green too long and you start to go rotten you you you're green you can become green with an unforgiving spirit amen all these things all these rottenness and all these unforgiving Spirits driven out of the church Why by the pillar of fire itself Shining Light upon the word of God and changing us from glory to glory amen praise God remember when the had the bread uh into the pot uh that pot there in the presence of the pillar of fire oh praise God that bread become showbread because when the light shined upon it that light began to really show praise the Lord that bread and God wants you to become a a part of that show bread to show that he lives in you walks in you talks in you moves within your heart and in your life for his glory and for his honor praise the Lord amen how wonderful it is thank God he paid for our Redemption price aren't you happy about that and now it's Our obligation to keep the change praise the Lord preserve it do everything you can that Holiness all these virtues don't leak out of you but that it stays within because you are sealed by the Holy Spirit onto the day of your your Redemption behold I show you a mystery you shall all be changed we'll be change from Mortal to immortality change what at the last Trump the Lord himself shall descend with the three phases of the Rapture but he says at the last Trump amen praise the Lord don't we understand who is the last Trump what is the last Trump we come right down after a trumpet angel each through the seven Church Angels blowing that gospel trumpet here we come to a prophet in this last day and that voice sounding Out through that Prophet amen hallelujah yes sir oh I believe that's the same voice that sounded like a trumpet that called Lazarus from the dead when he said Lazarus come forth that's voice sounded and call you out of that denominational graveyard that you were in it pulled you out of whatever backl condition you are in and brought you to where you are to not today by the grace of God hallelujah that's the same voice that was in him that is sounding out today Prophet said how long will the voice cry don't you recognize he says this is God's last alter call amen how long this spirit will cry I do not know amen it can happen and end at any time praise the Lord but we've got to keep the change we've got to let the Lord Jesus who paid the price Hallelujah help us help us as we Endeavor to keep the change Satan is trying to take it away from you you know some managers are like that when you give the money to the waitress and the manager is waiting in the back room looking through the glass soon as she goes behind there you got to hand over that change amen the devil wants you to hand over your change some of your friends want you to change back go back to being like them see it's the manager he wants you to change again backwards but we are not going backwards amen oh praise God the World Behind me the cross before me Jesus Jesus before me the Rapture before me no turning back I've gone too far to turn back now amen I passed the point of no return amen I broke through the sun barrier and I'm not hearing the devil in his lies anymore he can say whatever he want but I've seen the word of God I've heard this message y I Heard a Voice like I never heard before and that voice called my name out of those seven Thunders Mysteries of the Seven Seals and I answer the call that's why I'm here today amen praise God hallelujah amen yes sir oh praise God that same voice sounded to us and praise the Lord God we thank God the same voice has been sounding through the Flesh of William Mariam Branham yes many don't remember but one day brother Brenan was speaking and while he was speaking all of a sudden a voice came came out of him this is not William Branham speaking William Branham has only loaned me his body and his voice I am the Lord come down amen praise God hallelujah God was using the man just to be a microphone a vessel that he might project his word to a generation the people might hear him himself not just the messenger but to hear himself speak to them by the word of God hallelujah and thank God the prophet has gone on but thank God that voice hasn't died how many believe it that voice is still alive for the voice is now in the bride and the prophet said it oh the voice of many Waters hallah the voice of many Waters the voice in the people hallelujah now he said what is it doing thundering out thundering out the word of God calling men to repentance oh you you e you sinner that's bound right now for hell you're bound for the Great Falls don't you hear the voice amen crying out calling you to repentance repent back to the word of God God back to Holiness back to the scriptures amen out of your church business and back to the fullness of the word of the Living God hallelujah amen yes sir so the spirit of God warning you of judgment to come a tribulation to come all these things stand before us the burning of the of Babylon the burning down of all these evil systems of man back to the purity of the word of God Heaven home and the millennial Kingdom that is soon to come Hallelujah I want to go to a quot when I really go to what should I say if you want to call that my real message now brother Bram speaking we are Christians by faith through grace of God we are Christians see God in his infinite Mercy called us to be reconciled to him not not what we done but what he did what he did he changed my soul he changed my soul from the things of the world onto the things of our God hallelujah he changed my soul from horse racing from gambling from adultery from lying from stealing he changed my soul he says again he changed my thoughts he even changed he repeats my thoughts until my thoughts have start to become so real in my lips that they are beginning to materialize is that right you believe the Holy Spirit can do that with you you believe that we could be so Anointed with the holy spirit that until God starts making your thoughts and your words begin to materialize even when you are not thinking because it's not you that's going to think that you're going to do this command do that command or uh do this or do that but that the Holy Spirit of the Living God will flow through your entire life are you with me this today am well let's go more into the word of God here I'm talking about the soul change he changed my soul he changed my thoughts then my thoughts become so real till they become words in my lips they materialize now I'm a Christian I'm a different person he spoke that in the word made flesh now listen here again now just the other night how can you make a pig believe is wrong eating slop How could a leopard change his spots no matter how bad he would lick those spots they will only get brighter he lick the dirt off of them and the spots will get brighter you don't want Reformation see you don't want to try to reform yourself or do a little better better you got to be completely changed from the inside to the outside amen now get it right you must get it right inside at the beginning because you begin with a soul that was there there before the world was ever formed you heard what he said there you were there before the world was ever formed if you were an elected seed your soul was there in God before the world was ever formed Hallelujah now you get that right that what has to be born again that's what has got to be born again is that right so that seed that Soul has got to be born again now what he's talking about is that seed that soul that came was sent down here came down here get trapped in flesh and so it's got to be borned again praise the name of the Lord you find later we'll quote from the churches book where he says really only the elect could be born again the non-elect can't be born again there is no seed to be born again right praise the Lord oh my praise the Lord and if you get your Your Heart Right your intellectuals will move right along with it praise the Lord I want to move right along here quickly I'm talking about the soul change now through the years of this message there have been teachings of the Soul change in the form that you'll have two Souls not one but two and one will be the old soul and one will be the new soul I know what I'm saying now uh would sound controversial but when the spirit of God makes the thing clear and makes it right then it straightens everything and everybody amen praise the Lord and in actual fact this is what brother Bram said about the soul being the nature of the spirit he said that in let me give you the message for those who want to look it up you must be born again 1961 right he says that it's now he said it clearly the soul is the nature of the spirit right praise the Lord now and the two Soul Doctrine that's where it came from how many ever heard about the two Soul Doctrine okay if you never heard you're hearing now to be insulated so that you're insulated because he said now he says it's your soul that's been changed that your old soul died and the new Soul was born into you brother brandham was teaching this this is how he was saying it you understand okay but remember what I've told you people don't understand that even brother Bram had to wait for the Seven Seals to break and when the Seven Seals broke then it begins to straighten everything in his own heart and show him yeah yeah you were close to it but that's not it is this is this is this is this and start to open up the scriptures to him and many many teachers pick that up with authority said what the prophet said so a and they were right they were all right because the prophet did say so amen praise the name of the Lord I tell you friends that that that when the Holy Spirit began to show that now this is what I'm telling you now when the Holy Spirit began to show you see they couldn't be right because you you come from in God originally so there's no changing of that nothing isn't changing there that Remains the Same One God one p one believer One Soul one you are not three you're one amen praise the Lord hallelujah with the opening of the word we realize we are Eternal beings that come from eternity and we're going back to Eternity by the grace of God hallelujah oh my yes sir now listen I'm just showing you some things brother bradam used to say he this time he's not straightened out in his own mind fully right I know somebody will think well who do you think you are well it's not me but the Holy Spirit the Bible says amen this is in the he speaking here the Bible says here he says he that is born of God does not commit sin for he cannot commit sin for he is the seed of God the the seed of God remains in him how can he sin when the sinless God is in him when and he is in the sinless God how can he sin no matter whatever he's done the blood done covers it amen praise the Lord in other words it doesn't matter that person might make mistakes they don't want to do it but they make mistakes but the blood already cover that so so so there is no record against you Satan can't bring out a long list of paper and say look I got this black mark I got this other black mark this other black mark you done this you done that you done that and you can now as a son and daughter of God don't have to hide and bow your head and say yes you're right I done those things but Jesus done this for me praise God hallelujah oh praise God hallelujah he's redeemed Me by his Precious Blood that's why I stand here today amen praise God in the amen oh my he's a he's a new creature for the blood covers him amen listen to this now just after he says that listen what he goes around and says oh my because now he's changed from a cockle bar into a wheat do you get that then later on you're going to hear you you can look that up yourself where brother Bram says you can't change from a cockle bird to a wheat you can't change from a pig into a lamb Revelation strike him now it's a different matter all together hallelujah oh my but here before that time he's saying yeah you change from a cockle bir to a wheat amen yes sir praise God now we come down a little further and he's speaking here uh in uh he's speaking here your soul whether good or bad death does not change that soul is that right if that Soul comes from God it comes from Satan amen whatever it is death doesn't change it is that right Hallelujah I'm quoting brother Brandon from the rising of the sun now he's caught the Revelation now he's talking see now you are already resurrected God raised you up the son is now shining on you and now you're growing into a blossom life like he was to be resurrected completely in the last day just what I was telling you in the early stages so you recognize the prophet is saying it here now too he's saying you are already resurrected then he says but be completely resurrected in the last day right oh my the potentials are in you you have them now how do you know that your soul changed didn't it see your body come into obedience see into obedience to what to a church no sir it now comes in obedience to the word which is your life hallelujah amen then you are resurrected from the dead now you have an Easter with Jesus amen it's Jesus and you it's you with him you are in an Easter praise the Lord every day we are alive now we are living in an Easter experience with the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah because we've been raised up from sin we've been raised up from the dirt and the of the devil we've been raised up from the world into the presence of the word of God and of the holy spirit amen yes sir praise the Lord so this great mystery of our change to the Rapture it starts with the genuine Soul change or the changing of your soul amen praise the Lord listen again he's speaking 1965 now he's beginning to realize Rec recognize it oh my remember he says what I said before your old husband must be dead your new husband is the word amen hallelujah praise the Lord your old husband must be dead your new husband is the word we'll speak about that a little bit more later but here it is he says now seven days seven days shall they eat on leav bread seven days what does that typify it tells you of the complete seven Church ages it tells you of the ending of that them seven days why they have to eat it seven days oh my they had to eat it before going out the whole church AG hallelujah oh my like Israel in Egypt they had to eat it and then they could go out so we have got the fullness we are in this last Church age and this last Church age is an accumulation of all that they have in the church Jus before us amen praise God so we are eating on all of them praise God hallelujah amen from the beginning to the end Hallelujah has to live only on the word of God of that age praise the Lord amen now God's family sealed in by the Holy Spirit the Devil Couldn't get you if he had to if he wanted to he couldn't get you is that right because if you come as a seed soul from the presence of God he's going mess around with your flesh but how is he going to get you he can't get you that's why brother Brown said this can't be impersonated you can say you are one of them you can make all kinds of claims but you it can't be impersonated because you either that or you're not amen praise the name of the Lord amen see your old husband part is dead and you are buried and your life is hid in God through Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost amen then uh paragraph 251 then a new creation not a denomination but to the word you see if you were taking uh rituals and traditions and denominational teachings denomination this is what he's trying to say there will produce what denomination amen you will be a minor denomination like we are minor Gods because we took the word and Jesus said you are God's you man so you stay in the denomination fed by the denomination catch that Spirit you go out with a denominational spirit and you represent the denomination but we are not that we represent the word the word for the hour you are the creation of the word because that foundation stone was laid in you since before the foundation of the world Hallelujah the anchor was already in you the devil could do what he likes he can throw any storm he can do everything to shipwreck you but the foundation stone was already laid in you from before the foundation of the world Amen for and then he says predestinated to be the Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah amen praise God not my will but thine be done dear Jesus is that right not what I choose what he chooses for us let the Lord choose for me he let him choose my way and my path of life amen he is our leader he's our guide and since then since that foundation stone was laid in you before the foundation of the world predestinated to be Sons and Daughters of God upon this has come Stone upon stone and you understand upon that is how that's why he could send the Revelation to you is that right you tell them the but unto you it is given what was given that that foundation stone was already laying in them already it just waiting for him to lay out the stones on those Revelation upon Revelation Revelation until it comes out to the fullness of the truth of the word word of God hallelujah and then they will recognize fully and clearly who he is and who he was and who he is Amen in each age to vindicate the word to which is the Capstone of it all in him of course in him already laid every age for he was the fullness of the Kings fullness of the prophets he is the fullness of the church ages godhead bodily resting in him Hallelujah and he come out here to redeem a bride and that bride a masterpiece Hallelujah do you believe the Bride is a masterpiece the bride is the work of greatest work of art the world will ever see because God himself shaped the bride and put her here for his glory and for his honor amen see when the Devil Comes you say get behind me Satan he said what is that that's a bride that's a masterpiece standing there and guarding the word what word you're guarding that stone that's laid in you you guarding that word that is in you that's a masterpiece he says standing there amen and sometime the head of it all will return and receive the bride unto himself amen hallelujah for the woman really was took from that man part of that man praise the name of the Lord do you believe that amen we were in him and the prophet said it so simply and we could not get before when he said don't you understand just like Eve was in Adam she was taken out of Adam God did not go and find a different piece of dirt and form a Eve out of that to make her he says no he took the same material Adam was of and made Eve from that in the same way the real bride of Jesus Christ is not made from church material some other theological material ritual material she has made from the word itself because he is the word she is the word he is eternal she is eternal amen how is he oh praise God praise God hallelujah glory to God Amen oh my see you are a part of God's economy there's no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus Hallelujah because of God there going to be condemnation you are part of him that's not the if anybody that does that is the devil that brought the first accusation against God doing the same thing by accusing you is that right that's what he's doing there oh my you see the word that God God has used them or for ordained them placing their names in his bride book I didn't even I never came across that quat before God has a bridal book and and in that book is the names oh praise God oh thank God I'm in the book aren't you happy you're in the book amen you know a bride's book is made up so nicely with lace and beautiful colors and everything else like that but God has a bridal book amen oh praise God and in that book he says their names are in this bride book amen and so when them Waters those Waters come upon that seed that's already in that heart it has to rise up and be the Bride of Jesus Christ it raises up and becomes the Bride of Jesus Christ amen what is it it's the headstone come crying Grace Grace Grace pass from death and Creeds into a being a Living Word of a living God hallelujah God's only provided plan for his age his sons in the word age quickened by the spirit like a spark that lits off something now they are seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus already made alive but subject to every promise of the word of God being a part of God's Gene part of the word oh praise God and so them and other men and women are part of God's word seated together together they are manifesting now the body of Jesus Christ on the Earth is that right when like Precious faith we come together we fellowshiping with one another we are here in the spirit we identify with Christ the word we identify with each other that he says here is a manifestation it's the manifestation of what the son of man being revealed upon the Earth again hallelujah amen it's the entire body of Christ amen hallelujah oh my come to a place where there is no leav amongst you the leaven there's no hypocrisy of the Pharisees there's no hypocrisy of the Sadducees there's no real Sin praise God that that's going on no none of us here intend to do anything none of us but because you're still in this you will tend to lapse here and there I'm not giving you an excuse to go and say oh it was a lapse no I'm I'm telling you the facts that's the way it is so the devil don't condemn you and you get so guilty that you sneak off in a corner say nobody loves me nobody wants me no you are part of the body doesn't matter if you're a small toe or a small finger or you're a thumb that somebody hit with a hammer you're still a part of the body I don't care what they done what the devil has done with you and with your life back to the word back to Jesus Christ let the Lord have his way within your heart amen praise God hallelujah amen amen oh praise God and when you were like that with no leav among you that brings the fullness of the godhead bodily amongst you see oh my it's the son of man manifested amen revealed brought back the church together with his entire deity amongst these people showing the same signs amen praise the Lord hallelujah oh praise God Amen you know Ezekiel said the soul that sinth it shall die how many knows that praise the Lord and it talks about but the soul that sinth it shall die so there's a soul that don't sin praise God go back and read that scripture what Ezekiel is speaking there so some people come with a soul that don't don't sin it can't sin as the scripture says it cannot sin right you see and the devil plays with your with your mind and with the word because but I know I done this I know I done that yes yes you've done that but You' done that because you were in trapped inside of this that's is why you done that amen but the man inside there that don't want to do that that don't want to live that way don't want to do this do that wants to stay with the word amen you see see but you see you are born okay here the prophet himself is saying it here see you are born in the world with a sinful Soul Hallelujah you're born with a sinful Soul now you understand where I'm saying what I'm talking about out the seed of God but here is one born with a sinful soul and here is one born with the foundation stone laid in them praise God and one with a sinful Soul the nature of your spirit is sinful oh my the nature of your spirit is sinful praise God I'm just jumping over things here here amen praise the Lord 90 all the way through 1961 he was saying some things that were contrary contrary now uh just an know it not 1965 now now this on the outside of you that is the evil one he's on the outside inside of that is a spirit and you get that when you are born on this Earth the Breath of Life is breathed into you and so that Spirit of a worldly nature amen because it was not given from God but it was permitted by God hallelujah praise God oh praise God because every child that's born into this world come to the world speaking lies so in other words that worldly Spirit comes on every single child that's born into this world Amen and one already come with a sinful soul and one comes with what with a soul of God seed of God in them but because they're born in flesh the devil God allowed Satan permission to let that worldly Spirit of that worldly that worldly spirit with that nature to lie still Ste kill and everything else to rest on that soul and it rests there until the light comes the word comes and opens the eye of that believer and they that Soul can break out of that prison that they were in but the other one is a still a soul imprisoned now it can't come out from there because it's the same original one under that sinful nature and it will continue to be under that sinful nature and never be able to come out from it amen oh praise God hallelujah yes sir oh my see the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost how people can live in the spirit dance in the spirit shout in the spirit they go to church in the spirit they can absolutely have the real spirit of God anointed on that spirit now listen close he's talking about that spirit that was permitted by God that worldly Spirit the devil was able to rest on every child born into this world right see see they can have God's spirit resting on that spirit and still be lost still be devil possessed as they can be with that Spirit oh my do you see how clear that is now because in the first place they can't they can't get rid of being imprisoned that spirit is already imprisoned only the elect that come here with a seed soul from God can receive the rising of the sun uh the Waters of the word and and break out of that prison that they were held in for the grace of God you see oh my see for the rain falls and the just and the unjust the same rain that made the grain of wheat grow makes a cocklebur grow the inside of that seed is a nature and the nature displays itself it can stand in the field right there with the weed amen and rejoice oh my but by their fruits you shall know them praise the name of the Lord hallelujah praise God are you willing to give me some more time ah praise the Lord I want you to see here this is the church age book uh page number I don't know but he's speaking here he says now that Bride is a literal spoken word seed bride do you believe that though she is feminine in Des designation she is called the body of Christ see it's apparent she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him see came from the same Source Eternal with him and now manifesting God in a many membered body here see where once God was manifested in one member even our Lord Jesus Christ here we are coming to a conclusion amen praise the Lord I just going to move up a little further now we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed therefore we were reborn Hallelujah in other words this stuff they tell you in the church that that you go and you get born again and then you become a child of God that's when you become a child of God when you go into the church and you repent and you get born again you become a child of God Prophet saying no no no you had to be a child of God from being part of him from before the foundations of the world and it's now open your eyes to recognize who you are where you come from who your father is and where you're going back to where your real home is our home is not on this Earth amen we are not from time we come from eternity we're going back to Eternity Sons and Daughters of the Living God Eternal beings that are now living in time to fulfill God's purpose and God's plan here upon the Earth thank we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed therefore we were reborn for only the elect can be reborn amen because we were seen is the reason why we are quickened in the nonse there is nothing to Quicken amen oh my hold this carefully in your mind redeem means to buy back and you can read the rest for yourself it it begins to tell you there all about that praise God Mr buback only the true seed Eternal so this do that used to be taught of having two Souls because brother Bram talk qu have all those quotes and many of them which I didn't bother to read to you is not immaterial at this point if you choose to and you're a person that has to teach or preach you might want to check that out but we find out that we understand when the angel broke the Revelation to him that you come with one soul and that Soul come from God and that Soul can't die and you you don't get a New Soul it's the same soul that is in you but that Spirit nature that Satan put upon that soul to suppress it when you were born God sends the word and the word takes away the Gloom and the Darkness and rip the veil from off of you rips that evil thing from off of you lifts off that nature from off of you completely amen so that you can blossom and grow praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen oh your soul changed didn't it so some say see it say you are clear your soul changed but the Holy Spirit at least that's what he he showed me he says what that was saying is not that it changed to a different soul but the condition of the Soul changed is that right the condition of the Soul change the CH it Remains the Same Soul not a new one but the condition Amen to another not a new or a different soul not the old man amen not the sinful Soul become a new man no sir that's not what it is the soul that sinth it shall die amen but your Original Seed Soul coming from the presence of God that cannot die amen that was covered up that was suppressed under the influence and nature of that worldly Spirit of Satan amen praise the name of the Lord let me let me I just I I just want to let you have what I wrote wrote here as this was coming to me but your original Eternal being woke up to the revelation of the word amen and was made new or Changed by the water of the word of God your whole outlook your whole uh mental your whole spiritual everything changed but it didn't change in the sense that you become a different being a new being you be it's the same person amen but you're Changed by the word of God in you amen praise the Lord you can look up these quotes where brother Brandon said you were never a pig turned into a lamb he uses terms like every species brings forth after its kind it has to be that way it can't be one kind and and then a cockle bird turn into a wheat yes he did say that in the early days a cockle bird turn into a wheat or or or or or a pig get cleaned up and become a lamb no it doesn't happen that way amen what it was we were if I might put it this way um not me putting it this way this is what was uh given to me you were like dirty Lambs with dirt all over your your your your your your fleece you're covered up with all kind of dirt so the word had to come and wash you so that you could be white as snow amen so he's washed us with the word and made us white as snow sinful messed up Lambs HH amen I was one of them I don't know about you oh my sinful messed up Lambs confused Lambs running around in every way amen but we were made white with the blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah praise the name of the Lord but thanks be to God that at that time that we wake up out of our spiritual Amnesia and I'm going to end this pretty soon um we wake up out of our spiritual Amnesia but you know even after you come out of bed you can say you're awake but you're still groggy is that right you're still kind of groggy yeah you're walking around in a message yeah you got the word and but God still have to come and bring certain things to you to suddenly you make you come really brightly awake amen something will make you come brightly awake Amen brother Desmond this past week went to this church to preach the word of God and when he went to the church where he was invited to go he went there and there was no church anymore more and then he stood in the street wanting to know oh Lord what should I do there was a Sunday morning I should be somewhere where can worship God what should I do and while he's thinking like that all of a sudden in the marketplace he heard a voice saying hello brother hello he turns around oh praise God he says one of the sisters from that old church and I recognized her and somehow in all that crowd she recognized me and I said praise the Lord sister said what happened to the church and she told me and and said where do you worship she said well you know I still believe the word but there's no place I could worship except there is an Apostolic Church they don't know anything else but one God and baptism in jesus' name but I said that's a better than anything so I started going there amen so he said well I go along with you this morning and I'll go worship there when he walked in and I told you about these kinds of things happening when he walked in it's an old preacher the old man got up he he says you you are here he says you're a preacher last night I I had a dream that I saw a stranger come and and and and and I was to let that stranger um preach oh praise God hallelujah you say these are for old days God's spirit is still moving oh praise God so brother Desmond himself shocked he says brother I was so shocked and everything else he says but the supernatural just take over and I got up there and I start preaching the word of God and everything else and in the middle of the preaching the all preacher beside himself he says what you mean to say that's the truth that's the word of God and I never knew that oh my God and that man was beside himself and God took a hold of that church and rock it and shook it praise God and bring them people to the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ another message of this hour but that's not what I'm really that's a testimony that's just to let you know but the old man said oh praise God brother I just want you to come with me and I want you to come pray over the spot we bought the spot and we're going to build our our little church there so he took brother uh Desmond to pray over the spot he says brother Simon when he took me to the spot I started to ball I start to cry he says I start he says because there was the old mango tree that myself and my mother and my brother used to sit under when we did the farming and it was so hot and tired and we sit down on there to take some lunch there was the old mango tree and the spot this man by and brought to show me is the same spot that he bought Hallelujah who know about that only the god of Heaven could know something like that to bring us out of our spiritual Amnesia I said brother Desmond maybe you thought you were fully out of it but God absolutely like the prophet said will bring you back to some familiar places make you meet some familiar people familiar circumstances and all of a sudden your soul wakes sh and you recognize what is happening around you oh what a day we're living in brother sister oh thank God I'm so thankful amen praise the name of the Lord I'm glad friends that we are now passing through our own phase of that Amnesia but when the Rapture comes with all its fullness and I'm going to end this now Brothers could you come with the music I know I said a whole lot here here but when the Rapture comes Paul said then we shall know as we are known cuz right now we still seen through a glass Darkly right we seen through a glass Darkly but then face to face amen you think I'm seeing you face to face no Gabriel no am I seeing you face to face sh yes but you don't no I'm just I I'm just seeing the outward man the prophet said this man here this is Satan that's the one right that's your biggest enemy is this man on the outside right oh my but he said but what a glorious day that will be when we come together in the presence of God and we see each other face to face am amen I'll see you as you are supposed to be praise the name of the Lord I don't know if you're going to see me taller you can always have a wish I don't think so because we shall be known as we are known I trust the Lord bless you amen cuz what I tried to what the Holy Spirit not me but what the Holy Spirit has tried to do here at this time helping me to bring this message because this subject is a very and was a very controversial subject and most and many didn't understand fully what it was about and others were pressuring people that if you see this Revelation you you're not born again and so on all this type of thing and now we understand the opening of the word the holy spirit makes it all clear they were on to something but that wasn't it that was not the fullness of the word the fullness of the word comes now and let us know what it was that we come here as a seed soul of God and then Satan comes with his worldly Natural Spirit and put that spirit that nature of that Spirit on top of your soul because every child brother brandham said well good bad or whatever born because of how they were born in sin shapen and iniquity he God permit him to put that Spirit on every one of them one of us right but one had Redemption plan for them already one set had Redemption planned for them already and their names already on the book already God know know they're going back because he has a plan in progress the other ones Souls imprisoned now can't come out already trapped praise the Lord can't come out of it but one day the word would break and with Redemption we would be bought back and brought back to where we come from and we will recognize who we really are amen that we are not just every human being walking walking around doesn't mean we're all the same some are just Mortals and other ones are Immortals amen because this Mortal if you're elected will put on immortality will put on your real body is that right you put on your real body your word body you put it all on and you walk out of here in the grace of almighty God Amen praise God I hope it made sense to some of you at least and that you recognize what we're trying to say so somebody comes to you and raising up those uh kind of old doctrines that used to be there and raising it up now you know how to address it amen praise the Lord amen how many Souls do you have brother Brian one oh thank God so thank God you only have one praise the Lord so I can't go into too much more but the the old hus usand that he's talking about is that old sinful nature that Satan was allowed to put on Persons when they were born that's the old husband that he's talking about you divorce that when the word reveal itself to you and you are married to the sinless Son of God the revealed word for this hour by an invisible Union through Jesus Christ you see so wonderful these things used to be massive conventions of of uh altercations and Division and fighting and I don't not physical but spiritual fighting and quotations and everything else like that and hearing the other preacher saying sit down man I'll bury you with coats and yeah no no no those days are pass the holy spirit is opening up the word and saying look it's this simple is this simple if they had just waited because as the prophet said they will know when it is time for them to know amen is that right am sometimes we even tell our children that you will know when it's time for you to know it's not the time yet but you will know when it's time for you to know and you sitting here me now many things you may still have in your mind wondering about you will will know but it's time for you to know God bless you all thanks for bearing HJ prise
