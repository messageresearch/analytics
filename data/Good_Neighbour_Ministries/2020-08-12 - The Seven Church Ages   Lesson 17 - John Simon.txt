TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good evening friends i'm happy to be here tonight to share with you the word of god we thank god for sending to us his bread of life may the lord bless you as we engage ourselves in another marvelous lesson in the seven church ages we shall read from ephesians chapter one verse one then we will begin to enter into our study which will be entitled understanding the seven church ages understanding this seven church ages may god bless us all gracious heavenly father may your blessings rest upon us most of all may you move across the face of the deep may the great holy spirit anoint hearts and minds may you apply the word where it needs to be applied and change lines where they need to be changed most of all open up our understanding father and when this season of time is over may you receive all the praise the honor and glory for thine is the kingdom father god bless and anoint as we now proceed in your name amen ephesians 1 verse 1 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in jesus christ verse 2 grace be to you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ amen now so we want to come to a place of a clear understanding of these seven church ages now to fully understand the message of god to these ages we must first of all understand certain principles that god gives to us and we must also uh arrive to a place where we can recognize the names of the messengers okay so that's important we must also be able to understand the lengths of the age or ages and discuss other factors that may uh overlap along with these ages now we know this is a serious study this is a a serious study in which we ought to approach it reverently and not because we may be in our homes and relaxed in our domiciles that we ought to take the word for granted but the word of god is sincere and we ought to accept it soberly our minds and hearts receive the word of god and be blessed by the word of god hallelujah now to understand uh or to come to the understanding of these seven church ages we must clearly uh be in a uh an atmosphere of prayer we must allow ourselves to be in this atmosphere of prayer prayer for what asking god to grant you his wisdom his understanding and that he as he has promised that if we any man lacks understanding lacks wisdom and let him ask of god who giveth liberally god will give you liberally ever present water from the rock and you will thirst no more but you will want to follow that rock revelation on foundational truths of the word of god wherever the word of god and the spirit of god leads you amen the next thing we must do is to study the word as i've often said to you read your bible even if it's five minutes a day read your bible read your bible pray every day pray every day pray every day read your bible pray every day if you follow me if you want to follow the lord jesus christ read your bible and pray every day also take time if you can find anywhere a book on a church histories then read from it study it go to the library find it go to the some christian bookstore and you'll be able to find uh something like that on christian history or you can check out the encyclopedia britannica or other sources where you may be able to confirm that the things i am saying to you are true and they are true not only by the rebel quoting of the scripture and of the word of god but there are also true in normal human uh history compiled by men of course to show the journey of the human race and in there you will find also some wonderful uh gems and jewels of the understanding so you must study some history also it will be helpful to you uh don't just uh confine yourself in oh i'm just going to read my bible i don't want to read any other book i don't want to know anything else no you you need to expand because if you read paul you'll hear paul said well did the christians poets say and he'll quote them or well did the greeks say and he'll quote them it means a solomon said a wise man a wise man gets himself involved with all manner of knowledge so that out of his treasures new and old he may bring forth the truths and lights of god for the glory of god amen so you should study some history and also you should understand certain fundamental principles that are within the word of god and i'm going to deal there but there are four main principles in studying these seven church ages that i would like for you to pay particular attention to for tonight i will deal or attempt to deal with two of those principles the first one being principle one is that our god is unchanging i believe it my god that i serve is unchanging and that is a key principle or actually one or the keystone to understanding not only the seven chord changes it'll help you to understand the seven messengers it will help you to understand the entire bible if you can grasp this truth not just i'm saying it you are hearing it it's english your natural mind understand that when i say god is unchanging but i'm saying ask god by his spirit to give you a deeper understanding and a revelation that you may fully grasp and come to a spiritual realization of what it means to say and believe and understand that our god is unchanging this is a keystone truth and principle of the bible now i use the word keystone now you say well brother simon what is a keystone now i've been to rome several times and while in rome i i visit some of those ancient arches beautiful of built by the romans and what beautiful a work of construction to this day the children their children are masters of storm work and tile work and things of that nature gifted but a keystone my friends on those bridges across the rivers they're they're they're built like a arch and in the middle of that if you were to now take note and go look you'll see that there is a stone that has a pyramid shape it starts like that comes down and of course across and the bricks lay beside it and it's the keystone that holds all the other bricks in their places so what is this truth telling us that this one truth is the keystone of the bible that our god never changes and by this truth all the other things hold together and consist as one and you will find if you if you see this truth and hold to this truth you'll see a consistency of truth of revelation inspiration that goes through the entire bible like a river of life whose trains make glad the city of god yes sirs here it is our god is unchanging and that is indeed the revelation of hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he is unchanging in his ways and this scripture tells us he is on unchanging in his person on changing in his ways and on changing in his persons now if we read from ecclesiastes chapter 3 verses 14 to 15 i know that whatsoever god doeth it shall be forever nothing can be put to it nor anything taken from it and god do it and men should fear before him now just place in your mind along with that revelation chapter 19 and 20 where the bible says you should not add to this book you shall not take away hearing ecclesiastes you are seeing the same truth here that whatsoever god do it is forever nothing can be put to it and nothing can be taken away from it for god with it and men should fear before him that which had been is now and that which is to be had already been and god required that which is past so god we are unhappy and serving an unchanging god who has unchanging ways hallelujah glory to god i'm happy that heaven and earth will pass away but as the bible says my words shall never ever pass away unchanging god on changing ways on changing word we realize that god's word will never change and if god ever does anything one time then god my friends the first time it will have to keep doing the same thing over and over again that is why history has cycles now he has to do that over and over again because he is perfection of perfection of perfection and his first decision or his first act is a perfect act that cannot be improved upon yes sir and that's the kind of god that we are serving so let's apply this truth to the church ages finding that what god did in the very first church age he cannot change from that that has to be what he has to repeat down through the other ages what he did see he has to repeat doing it so praise god so it's in your bible it's in the book of acts thank god the holy spirit allowed it to be recorded in the book of acts there that how the first original church was founded and how god manifested himself through that church remember god's principles of his word are unchanging and we see in the book of acts how the first church was founded we see how god was manifesting himself through that church and the word of god cannot change or be changed for it is the word of god no man no institution none can come along and improve upon or ordain or suggest that they will improve upon the word of god that is not what i read in my bible for you shall not add you shall not take away from the word of god for the word of god is unchanging for it says in john chapter 1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and god amen is unchanging hallelujah and the moment we change one word of god just like eve did in the garden then we bring sin death trial tribulation upon our lives so the word of god is to be uh what he has left it at and not to be meddled and mingled manhandled uh by any geological wisdom or knowledge of man any presumptions of man or any assumptions by man none of that we are to leave the word of god alone for god is his own interpreter and he will make it plain for he will make it known to you and any other what it is time for you to know when it is time for you to understand when it is time for you to catch the revelation then in the fullness god sends forth his son the light of god upon your heart your mind and upon your life amen hallelujah now we then understand through this principle that the church that god birthed at pentecost acts chapter 2 amen the entire book of acts my friends is the pattern it's the original pattern and it is the pattern that we can not should not and must not change for we must not uh my friends mess around with god's word we can't deform the word of god yes sir we need to leave god's word as it is god has a wisdom in the way he has placed every single word conjunction everything within the bible and no matter what scholars may tell you that is the pattern and we are not to change god's pattern for what god did at pentecost he has to keep on doing until the church ages are over now scholars may tell you well we know the days of the apostles as glorious as the days of the apostles were it's now history it's now uh it's now epistles it's not beautiful literature it's good for us to study and develop a clerical uh uh you know a profession uh of clergy through this matter for it's now the days of the apostles are over oh friends i beg to differ because that is wrong particularly on two counts first of all it's wrong to suppose that there aren't any more apostles for the one apostle the word apostle means set one one that is sent and that will be equivalent to us in our day using the word a missionary that's what paul was now we use the word lightly sent i'm not going to go into that it doesn't just mean anyone that is sent out from a church makes that person an apostle but one sent by the hand of almighty god is a genuine god santa boss not a church sent one not a not a mother that sends out her son but god our heavenly father that anoints that empowers and sends forth his son when paul said that what the lord showed to me first corinthians chapter 11 as it was revealed to me by the lord jesus that on the same night he was betrayed amen and then he tells all that was said in that room when they had the last supper not being there he wasn't told it by peter by paul by any of james or any of the other apostles of that day but he said revealed to me by the lord jesus himself it's not that he had a different revelation but god gave him a little more understanding on the original word so that he could put it forth so that they said well brother brother uh peter uh brother paul you're saying some things that uh uh you know it's it's it's so dark deep that even i can hardly understand but god has given each one of us a different kind of ministry he gives us a different kind of as much as we have different personalities he gives us a different kind of ministry and so here it is that pattern cannot be changed and there are still apostles here upon earth do you believe that do you believe god still has apostles i believe it god sent once anointed men by the holy spirit that need no recognition that need no recommendation but because they have the vindication of the god of heaven o praises holy blessed name may his name be praised and lifted up forever oh praise god hallelujah amen yes sir my friends the bible tells us that as long as god is calling men to ministry uh calling men and sending men by the holy spirit then the days of the apostles or the apostolic age is not over if the age of manifested holy ghost power is not over praise god acts chapter 2 verse 38 to certainly then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you those that were right in front of him and to your children and to all that are far off as many as the lord our god shall call as many is god still calling as long as god is still calling this promise is unto you and the age of the apostolic age is not over and can not cease until we are called out of here it will not end it will not cease until god stops calling the pentecostal message vindicated by pentecostal power shall never cease and i'm not talking about the modern day pentecost i'm talking about the holy ghost bible pentecost the original pentecost restored back by the power and presence of god upon his sons and his daughters his chosen ones his hidden ones his elected ones his little flock his bright class of saints his church of the living god the assembly of the firstborn all blessed be the name of the lord they're here they're on the earth they're everywhere there they're within various churches and groups and god is calling from in the book of revelation come out of her mind people if god wanted you in there he'll leave you there but the bible gives the command come out from a monster my people and be not partakers of our plagues or judgments that i'm going to send upon or because of our errors and because of our statements and actions than examples that she has given for so come out from whatever you are in and come into the perfect law of liberty of the word of god given to us by our lord jesus christ now we know that whatever the church had at pentecost is her inalienable right and it is our divine right to have the same thing they had on the day of pentecost hallelujah brothers and sisters that trailed my soul when as a teenager that i uh i heard the scripture read out of acts chapter 2 and spoke to this wonderful man of god i knew at that time of my boyhood and said do you mean that what i'm reading here right now in this bible this is what is supposed to happen to us in our day and that gentleman said yes i said so do you realize that do you mean that if i were to raise my hands up now and begin to praise and thank god by faith for accepting his word his promise of the holy spirit in my life that god will give me exactly the same thing and uh i said how am i supposed to do it like this and the moment i raised my hands the holy spirit of almighty god dropped upon me and for about 15 to 20 minutes i was speaking and speaking speaking praise god hallelujah and when i came to full fullness of consciousness i could hear myself i wasn't unconscious i could hear myself speaking ah but when i became fully aware then immediately the old minister said oh my god uh there is no doubt of what you have to do and what god called you for brother sister the days of the apostles are not over the apostolic age is not over and by saying these things i'm not identifying or trying to imply that i am one of those apostles do i may be but that's for god to make clear i want you to understand god has promised these things in his word and our unchanging god must bring these things to pass if we consciously earnestly believe his word this is not movie making some mythical thing that's written in this bible it's not just a fantasy but it is faith in the word of god that and the right mental attitude that brings it all to pass hallelujah glory to god hallelujah so we know that this age of manifested holy ghost power manifesting through the saints true the true church of the living god is not over but it's here with us now would you claim your part of it and say oh lord send the power just now oh lord send the power just now oh lord send the power just now and baptize everyone wherever you are receive ye the holy ghost may the spirit of almighty god fill you anoint you and use you for his glory and honor for in the days and years to come amen blessed be his holy name amen glory to god listen my brothers and sisters what that church had was their right and it is our right today for the apostolic age is not over now originally when the church started you will agree with me the church had the pure word straight from the mouth of the lord jesus straight to the lips and hearts of those apostles so the church had the pure word also she had the power of the holy spirit manifesting through her with divers signs and wonders being manifested among the saints of god she also had diversities of gifts of the holy spirit that was so proliferated amongst them it was everywhere the deacons had it the ministers had it the the the apostles had it you had the women in the church phillips daughters had it they prophesied there were others that were anointed by the power of the holy spirit because it was the expected saying it was not something that was extraordinary until uh they went about calling themselves uh apostle apostle so and so or or they went around with some spiritual pride saying oh uh deacon soon so or a prophetess so and so no it wasn't a matter of human pride and uh and naming and claiming and and calling one another by these names they're simply recognize the offices the gifts and powers that were working through the individual and they needed no other badge of identification other than god as with abel god bearing witness testimony of the here their gifts and of his presence within their lives they don't need any other man or woman certification ordination of any that nature that sort of thing is just to operate here upon this earth that we are in but the real ordination the real holy spirit is to come father the bible and anoint his beloved and use them for his glory and for his honor hallelujah amen oh praise god hallelujah amen now we also know not only that she had the perfect pure word of god the power and presence of almighty god signs and wonders miracles manifesting a monster just spontaneous combustion of the purifier's presence and the power of god breaking out at any time oh blessed be his holy name it could be that we're in the quietness and things it will be that we're in a meditation and all of a sudden the holy spirit could break forth that's the original way it was we don't need to work ourselves up like bills uh bails profits into a an emotional frenzy so it will put you into an emotional experience but we don't have to work ourselves up into that and drum it down and music it up or or beat it up or beat it down but rest in the grace of god and have faith in the promise of god that he will fulfill his word for god himself is unchanging and his words must come to pass glory to god hallelujah and so the church the original church will always be the pattern every seed after its kind like will beget like so the original church will be what the true church will try to measure itself against no other group no other church no other institution denomination or independent so-called group that man uh may bring up but a measure yourself by the plumb line and the standards and principles of the word of god and see where you stand according to the word of god now this true church will always be the one that will follow in the footsteps of the founders the first messenger paul and the others that were there at the time it's it's just so simple and wonderful that we just follow the messenger for that first age what god used him and by the way men and women are not ashamed to quote from the epistles of paul and said well did paul say so and so but if i were to stand here and say brother branham said so so they'll say oh that that we don't have to pay attention to that well you don't understand the days of the apostles and the prophets are not over but i'm talking not about this the devil has thrown out so many counterfeits until the people have lost sight of who and what is a true prophet they've lost sight of what and who is a genuine god-sent apostle a god sent man of god a godsend pastor teacher evangelist that lost sight of it has now become just a matter of of a modern day marketing and everything else oh god help us and they are in which we are living so we must judge ourselves according to the original true church of the living god because what she was at pentecost and what she was in the apostolic age that is set forth in this word of god in the book of acts we must apply the same rules and then we will see where she was blessed and use of god and we will also be able to understand the pitfalls and the errors and where even that church failed after they began to drift away from the original truths until even paul before he left the scene began to say i'm afraid that there are grievous wolves brethren man and crept in unawares there was a already an invention of error that was taking place at that time now if that was in the planting season of the church what about the harvest time of the church the ripening season of the church whoa when truth and era are in array when the supernatural war is still going on when the greatest battle ever fought from good from eternity back to eternity being fought and raging in this hour oh glory to god my brother sister don't you see we must follow god's pattern clearly in his word because the errors that took place there and started just as a little bug my friends is growing so great on and great upon the earth until we are facing or we are prophesying and we are experiencing a spiritual blackout of the truth on revelation in the word of the living god oh glory to god i thank god for this first key principle what our god is unchanging now we know that the true church will always try to be like this one that was in the book of acts hallelujah we also discovered that the word teaches us as i've just said that there was there and there is and through the ages there has been a an invasion of error a satanic invasion of enticing spirits versus the word of god seed deucing spirits to draw and charm your mind away from the genuine word of god and to make these sweet sounding talks and bible teachers and things of that nature sound so uh organized orderly symmetrical beautiful words like cain's altar that it could just slip into your heart and into your mind and you accept that as truth of not the rough and ready word of god primitive christianity with brimstone and fire and of stretch oh my god rifle barrel strike gospel from the word of god hallelujah don't you realize that the when abel killed his lamb in the bible and offered it up it was not a sharp knife that he had he had a rough rock whether he banged that animal on the neck until the neck came off but he used a rough-hewn knife made out of a rock and so it appears when a genuine man of god picks up the word of god and begins to use it it appears sometimes rough crude untrained not properly put together symmetrical it doesn't seem progressive it doesn't seem palatable not to our taste not dignified enough that's my friends back to the bible back to the original word of god what you went out in a willingness to see not what you went into the cathedral what did you go into the wilderness to see a prophet i'm more than a prophet you didn't go there to see one dressed up with fine robes like in a green palace but men coming out with gold skinned sheepskin camel skins on oh go praise god not that i don't mean to do that today because we will dress for the day in which we live but my friends it will be simple ordinary men anointed by the holy spirit don't be afraid brothers don't be afraid saints of god you heed the word of god and obey the promised word of the hour and do what god tells you to do not to be a rebel but be one that follows the word of god and that will cause you to fellowship with those of like precious faith that is clear within the word of god hallelujah oh friends we are facing this clear blackout of truth in this last day just before jesus appears first time he was about to come upon the earth in the form of a baby the bible said the people that sat in darkness saw great light and yeah a great light has sprung up oh praise god hallelujah all my friends i believe the same thing has happened in our day that a great light has sprung up here upon the earth lord of god but in the midst of this darkness does god forsake his own does he forget his people in a time like this for them to fall into a state of deception the answer is clear matthew chapter 24 jesus said for they shall arise false christs false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders and this and if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect in other words the elect cannot be deceived and i want to thank god for that my friends that the elect cannot be deceived and i'm glad that in the midst of all of this darkness hallelujah i'm sure you might have heard this story of the boy and his sister that were in an elevator and as it was going down it it suddenly stopped and it has happened in the most modern buildings and the lights went out and it was dark and uh you know she began to his sister began to scream she began to scream uh she was so fearful of the dark oh my my my but in those days back then they also had to have an elevator operator and there was a switch that he could turn on and he could turn those lights on so the young boy turned to his sister and oh say oh don't fear little sister don't fear little sister oh oh there is a man here that can turn on the light oh little church of god in this last day i want to say to you as i am closing now there is a man here that can turn on the light and his name is not john simon his name is jesus christ our lord jesus christ the same yesterday to them forever and he is here with us now so put your faith in him trust him repent confess and serve him and if you are believing saint of god consecrate rededicate yourself to god sincerely let the tears flow my friends at the cross at the cross where i first saw the light and the burden of my heart rolled away where i first saw the light amen may god help you to see this light and open the eyes of your heart in the name of our lord jesus christ god bless your friends until we see you on sunday morning to god be the glory great things he had done [Music] amen [Music] you
