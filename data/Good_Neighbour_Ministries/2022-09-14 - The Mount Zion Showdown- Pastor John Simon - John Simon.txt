glad that we are back in the house of the lord to uh go back into our study of the word of god amen and we want to talk about the mount zion showdown the mount zion showdown praise god and we will use uh matthew 24. i'll just take one verse because you can read the entire chapter when you go home jesus talking about the end times but in verse 23 and 24 he says then if any man shall say unto you lo here is christ or there believe it not for there shall arise false christs right and false prophets and shall shew great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they will they shall deceive the elected if it were possible they shall deceive the elected amen wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth behold these in the secret chambers believe it not amen praise the lord may the lord bless the word to our hearts together as we pause in the midst of the week uh in our busy schedules and everything else to um recharge our batteries stir up our hearts keep our minds focused on him the word that he might receive glory from everything within our lives father we thank you for the reading of the word lord we ask that you would bless us together as we place our thoughts upon these things we pray that your life will come upon this quicken the bread this bread of life that is here to us that it may give every one of us life lord jesus we pray let the angel walk once more on the waters and let those that are needy of you step right in lord jesus and may the holy spirit be glorified lord we thank you and praise you for these things in jesus name amen the lord bless you amen please be seated amen hallelujah now now remember these false prophets many people like now after that they had heard listen after that they had heard the word from the true prophet the anointed prophet that was vindicated they fell for coral's lies after they heard the message after they followed it after they walked with it he said they're going to fall for cora's life now you got to go back into the old testament to understand that korah was as we would in type say was as a make-believer he was within the tribe of israel he was walking believing uh the message just as the others were they were all following moses they were all following the message for their hour and their day but he says here i repeat after they had heard the true word from the anointed prophet that was vindicated they still fell for chorus lies oh my korra was not some fellow in egypt on the street cora was not somebody yelling that he's against god or he's against the this or against that but somebody from the back door within the message that will begin to say things that the attempt is to erode credibility error faith in the prophet's message right and they fell for chorus lies when god had given them a god-proven prophet right god had told them distinctly you see horror was not according him was not really a scriptural prophet see but it looked awful good to them people my same as it does now today same as it does today see oh my and then we know my friends you you you would not think that people will fall for it but they did then just as they did to korra they did then and so are they doing again today oh my you see and they do the same thing actually he says right there and they do the same thing now and by that turn away from the true word right turn away from the true word and go back to them denominations right they go back to denominations oh my then that begins to show what seed was in them but thank god all israel did not fall for cora's lies amen some stayed with moses the anointed prophet with the word of god for that day same he repeats same as it is today amen same as it is today with many of god's elected by his word and by his spirit hallelujah amen praise god brothers we are living in a real razor edge time we have come right to the pinnacle of the mountain of god the stature of a perfect man where he said the thing will come to a razor's edge a razor's edge and there except you have your eyes on the word you will not be able to walk the line you can't do it but if you are of him he will cause you to walk the line amen praise god now notice now all scripture has not yet been fulfilled amen but it must it must be fulfilled now remember the gentile dispensation is not finished amen and it is to be finished so all scripture is not yet at his time not yet fulfilled right now see that must happen we know malachi 4 5 has been fulfilled amen the prophet has come and gone also we know the church ages have been fulfilled they have come and they're gone i don't mean when i say gone you will understand this it's not just chopped like that and stops it it phases out right but uh officially uh they they the ages are over time shall be no more the church edges have no more time it's run out time has run out for the church ages because other things have to happen now other things have to be fulfilled by the grace of god amen hallelujah praise god for you see he says now they that anointed messenger uh arrives on the scene and he will be the one that will plant the seed of the entire bible not a seed but this seed we know that's the word that is jesus himself the word he will plant the logos he will plant the seed of the entire bible hallelujah from the serpent seed to right to the messenger of the former reign hallelujah my goodness this is a particular and peculiar man whom we believe has already come has already gone has already fulfilled this ministry we believe it to be brother william marion branham [Applause] amen you see but that one will be rejected by them denominational people right just like their forefathers but remember john was spoken of elijah was also spoken of by the lord hallelujah praise god and i want you to know this will happen again here in this country as this country is a type of israel go read he says jezebel religion just the same our forefathers came right and we pushed out them natives and we just took over so this israel god allowed them to go in go out of egypt go into the land push the people out and took over right oh my but just like them he says speaking to the united states we also have godly man leading us then he names abraham lincoln and washington well men of that stature that were leading them just like israel had godly men like david and so on leading them at that time but when all of that was over then god allowed an ahab to come and sit on the throne oh my i believe we right now in that season and time when an ahab has got to sit on that trail amen well listen close because ahab is only going to be the face or the front but an ahab has got to come sit on the throne amen watch take a bit about it now we find out but when he got on the throne there will be a jezebel behind him can you say man she will be behind him he says to direct him to direct him to who who really is on the throne he's just a figurehead sitting on the troll but jezebel will be behind him to direct him that is prophecy that is telling you about the catholic church funding financing and having influence power and control and domination over whoever is going to be the ruler on the throne over there amen and as such will have influence over the whole world because you know whatever happens there influences the entire world okay okay so here it is now know this so it's at this time we know it's at this time and i say this thus sayeth the lord amen praise god it will there will there has come forth back in israel a mount caramel showdown he's saying at the same thing is going to take place again just like in israel there was a monk caramel showdown under the ministry of the first elijah what was that monk caramel showdown you know it was between the false prophets that were eating from jezebel's table that were getting their salaries and their big this and that and uh dressed up like big prophets with co-horns and all kinds of uh regalia on them while he elijah was just a shabby old man dressed with a camel skin he wasn't even counted as any preacher or anything of that nature but here it was he said that is going to happen here again a mount caramel down now what what was the monk caramel showdown it was a showdown between the message of elijah and the message of what this prophecy these prophets were preaching these prophets were preaching that the church was right jezebel was right and elijah was wrong and usually that's what happened it bothers them so much right oh my when they say oh eli when elijah met a ham in the desert hear what ahab says are you he that trouble at israel no listen to that question and the same thing happens today they accuse preachers even like me that that you you you you putting a curse on the people you making these things happen he likes to turn around and says no i don't trouble israel it's you and your adulterous wicked ungodly wife that's that's the one that brings the trouble on israel it's your own actions that brings the curse on you amen i'm just telling you i see it and that's what's going to happen that's the way it is because god's word already tells you that [Music] and so the showdown was between elijah the true word representing the true word and the prophets of jezebel who are type of false prophets false preachers bringing a hybrid truth of the word of god oh my see and after that then we see john the baptist the messenger comes and he my friends preach the word oh my but then we find a messenger planting the former reign will be rejected by the churches rejected by the denominations we will know that clearly brother brennan's ministry is rejected by all of them they don't want to hear it they don't think it doesn't agree with their teaching it doesn't agree with their uh diagnosis it does not agree with their uh compendium of thoughts when they bring together all their religious thoughts and put in a theological book which should be the wisdom for all churches and that's got to be right what single man is going to step out when there are a thousand ten thousand learned men through centuries that said this this is this this but they don't understand that one man the only man that was given thus saith the lord it doesn't matter what a million men 10 million men said before let every man's big word be a lie and my word be the truth and i believe god's word hallelujah amen see oh my but remember jesus come and he had a monk transfiguration showdown amen with the pharisees and the sadducees they wouldn't accept him as the word but all he did was not argue with them but he went up in the mountain and he was transfigured not to them it was a showdown but he was transfigured to his disciples he was transfigured he showed himself the word amen in a transfigured form to them amen yet when he came back down when the pharisees saw him he was the same jesus but then or what they seen when they were caught up in that revelation they know what they have seen when they were caught up with the brightness of his effulgent glory they know what their spirit had seen hallelujah and they recognize it amen glory to god hallelujah amen now notice amen now this one of the last days will show for the former reign hallelujah praise god so what we are starting to experience now amen and what we will experience hallelujah because we were and are still in the former reign of the ministry of malachi force high right praise god so we understand that oh my then he turns around he says and see jesus will now be the showdown himself hallelujah this is not the messenger uh uh coming now this will be jesus the word hallelujah will be the showdown that will be between denominations and creeds and against that which is his word hallelujah it will be the word versus denominational teachings and creeds so we're in the middle of that showdown right now in other words it's starting to come to its fullness amen where are going to have to face that showdown because they are going to start getting aggressive and coming against what we are teaching because remember they've got to get to the place where they shut you up close down your churches stop you from ministering so they've got to become enraged like it was in the bible when the prophets preached when jesus preached when paul preached when any of the true word flashed through a messenger then what happens they become so enraged but the bible says for their wisdom they cannot withstand the revelation from the word of god and when they find that cat which stand up they become enraged hallelujah amen praise god hallelujah amen now we see then glory to god hallelujah there it will be then that will be the time for the showdown the rapture of the bride that is the mount zion showdown because the last part of her uh displaying to them that all that she has been saying and telling them is the truth is when she is caught out of this place is that right that will be the final part of the showdown amen oh praise god it started already amen but the entire uh show mount zion showdown which is the rapture itself will be the showdown it will show them who she really is praise god hallelujah remember this the first was in mount carmel the second was among transfiguration and the third will be mount zion glory to god the rapture show down that will be the third one and i believe we are in the middle of that right now we're heading to the top of the mountain why we're seeing the fullness of the world making itself known watch just like elijah's behavior back there like moses behavior like john's behavior oh my many of the people don't understand them hallelujah and the reason is because they reject his message see they reject his message oh my yes sir but remember they reject this message but the seed has already been shown in other words he don't care the messenger doesn't care that the seed has already sown that's what you can do about it amen and god is going to bring it up in his own time in his season when he is ready he's going to bring him but i have already sown the seeds and i am one of those seeds hallelujah you are one of those seeds i hope the holy ghost has got a hold of you amen praise god hallelujah oh my remember there there or that man was a sign to the people from god amen that the planting of the seed was over and now judgment is at hand amen oh praise god forevermore hallelujah amen i believe it friends amen i believe at that time the real bride of jesus christ will be forced to stop preaching the word yeah and i believe we are right on the brink of that we're right on the brink of it right now she will be forced to stop preaching the word of god it's not that she's not preaching the bible it's not that she's not preaching from the bible but he's talking about the revelation of the fullness of the word as she understands it and sees it here when she begins to talk that they'll understand the written part she's talking about but the unwritten part that is all in there they have no where do you get that where do you hear that where's that from i don't see it in here and so and she will be branded and persecuted like he was persecuted in that way because we didn't hear moses say that we didn't hear this one says that he says but before moses was i am amen it's he's in me now and i'm speaking to you now praise god hallelujah they're not going to recognize who the bride really is that is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever it's easy when we say it but they will not recognize that they're leaving children say who you bill oh my i know glenn i i know this one i i know that one doesn't care what you know that is your head nor that that's why your eyes see what you think you know but you the one who you should really know is the one that's inside me inside you inside the real believer that's the one you should really know hallelujah that's the one they should be able to recognize amen see they will be forced to preach stop preaching the word of god i believe it and the bible prophesies it also in revelations 3 16 you see it's them denominations that will force it to stop preaching or to take its mark you're going to either have to go and have membership in one of them right or to be able to continue preaching and have all the rights of registrations for marriage officer registration to be chaplain registration to be all of these things like that it will get to that point where they're going to draw a line we still have a certain amount of freedom right now but they're going to draw a sharp line that you will not be able to do those things and she will have to stop preaching see and to take the mark hallelujah oh my but just about that time is when the lamb will take his bride he will not allow her to go through tribulation but he will take his bride away out of that kind of atmosphere and then we find the judge oh the judge will come to judge that harlot amen as mentioned in revelation 13 16 my think of what our real living in you know how many supernatural actions and tremendous fulfillments and words of god are taking place while we go about our simple lies or our work or rest or eating or sleeping or waking or traveling but the supernatural doesn't stop our god is marching on and these events are taking place or fixing to take place amen praise god hallelujah amen oh my remember remember this moses was born for that work at that time now why what i just want to shift your thoughts here he's talking about moses back there but we can type that and show he's talking also of the spirit of moses uh being on the messenger of this last day but then when you go beyond that he's talking now about the spirit of god being on the bride amen see okay so while i'm talking you will understand now moses was born for that work born for that work at that time a prepared vessel in other words prepared ground to go about that work for that time but still he had to wait on god don't act prematurely he had to wait on god for an extra gift to be able to finish the job glory to god they had to become there has to come a surge of the holy spirit on this bride there has got to come a quickening more by god's hand amen praise god brother sister we don't know what day what time what hour but we just make sure that the lord has been soaked in the word of god hallelujah so that he can take complete control and preeminence to fulfill his divine will remember moses was born for the work amen in other words he was born for the work not only that he came prepared but uh moses was born with a whole pile of natural gifts beyond what any person of that age had and he he had wisdom more than all the wise men in egypt and everything else he had those natural gifts but what what is being said here is with all of that he still couldn't do it with all the intellectuals with all the knowledge he could not accomplish anything more than killing an egyptian he could not accomplish anything he still had to wait on god hallelujah he see he had he repeats it he had to go back and wait amen and he had to wait he says for the appointed time there's an appointed time for these things to happen is that right and you saw brother branham in his ministry even when he already seen the vision this and this and this is what's going to happen and he would walk in the room he had to sit there and wait because an old woman is supposed to come and sit in that chair and she's supposed to have a brown shawl all over her shoulder and this is supposed to happen when you see these three things happen now you know it's the time is that right so he just has to sit there and wait or stand and wait amen and that's what god is telling us now not one man on a platform but now a whole bride is waiting amen for a certain season an appointed time when god will display and fulfill all these scriptures the rest of the scriptures that is supposed to be fulfilled we're talking about our season and our time i don't mean of the end all the entire scriptures because the scriptures concerning tribulation this and that we are not in there so but we are to fulfill all the scriptures for our day our time our season that's what i'm talking about amen praise god remember that see he had to wait first for an extra gift he had to wait also and watch for a certain pharaoh to come to the troll hallelujah don't we have to do the same thing don't we have to watch for that new pharaoh that will come to the troll that will have a jezebel behind him that will have something like that influencing him and directing him oh my what a season in a time you don't know what money uh manipulations taking place behind the scenes right now do you know how many trillions of dollars americans will need to borrow where are they going to borrow it from from the jews are they going to borrow it from the catholics but the prophet has prophesied that is what they're going to have to do he says they're going to get all the paper and the bonds and get that from the jews but they got to go and get the gold from the catholics right they'll get the gold there now know this a certain pharaoh has to be on the troll throne and most of it their people must be wanting and hungering for the true bread of life amen they're not hungering yet fully uh some of them start to get little inklings that something is wrong and as little hungering and stirring has taken place in their hearts that they really want the truth many of them who wander from church to church searching for what they think is the truth starting to get tired and they start to get hungry now for something real solid they can't live anymore on in the words of the prophet uh by drinking the soup made from the shadow of a some uh what's it the shadow of a sin chicken no they can't live on that anymore that old woman that live in the shoe put them to bed my goodness give them a cup of soup like that and just want to put them all into a religious sleep but not the real bride the real bride clearly sees the word of god hallelujah amen why so they have to we they have to wait this bride this is what she's doing right now gotta wait when the people are gonna start hungering and thirsting and i'm saying some of them already started amen first they were pushing you away they don't wanna hear nothing they don't wanna hear this they're going to come right and begin to ask you they're going to begin to question you about the faith out of the word of god amen believe it mark it it's the truth hallelujah the people have to be hungering and wanting the bread of life amen and thirsting for that amen now we find when that happens there will also be many sign seekers all across the land now this is the false prophets and spirits jesus was speaking up in matthew 24 around that same time when the people heading to go and and get the real bread and the truth he sends a host of them devils to confuse the issue and to blind the people misdirect the people away from the word of god and let me add one word here to confuse them have their mind confused about what is the truth hallelujah that they are really searching for amen and so we see that a whole generation of sign seekers in this last day has been created created the atmosphere where that's what people are hungering and thirsting for not for the bread of life which without which men can't live but they're hungering for signs and greater signs and greater wonders to take place amen hallelujah but see they they they want that but they know nothing about the true move of god in his word in these last days they know nothing about that amen oh my think of it look just as jesus said in matthew 24 the two spirits will be so close together amen oh my i wonder how close that is amen how can you tell them apart when it says they will deceive the very elected if it was possible that means that thing is so close that if you did not have the journal of god in you the gene of god in you you'll be carried away like everybody else anybody else if god had not tied you to that type post in glory you would have been swept away like everybody else amen but thank god his his gene keeps us his germ holds us my ankle holds beyond the veil praise god we are kept by the power of god through revelation oh blessed be the name of the living god amen oh my how can you begin to know them give them the word test you got to have the word first before you can give somebody a word test you've got to have a real revelation of course this thing is so deceiving that you have people all in the message are saying the same thing i'm saying here give them a word test but they're talking about the just the written word test they're talking about the visible word test they're not talking about the spirit of god in your heart and give you a revelation of that word and you test them by that amen to see where they're at oh how can you know it speak the word hallelujah speak the word that you know that anyway and then when you speak the word he says just see what they're going to say about it amen speak the word sit back and just see what they're going to say about it amen oh my wow oh if they don't believe the word then you will know they have no seed germ in them page 134 of the spoken word is the original seed he said then you will know they have no real seed german them and they are the ones that are of the evil one that will try to deceive you what's what what what what am i really telling you he's telling you they're going to be right in the message that's what he's telling you they're going to be right in the message they're going to claim they have the word just like you have the word they're gonna claim they have the message like you have the message he says but when you're talking to them he says just speak the word and stand back and listen wait and you will see from the answer whether or not they have a real seed germ in them you will know amen see oh my you see now that has to happen for the first bride was the seed amen and the second bride also was the sea amen now i'm i've got to go over i think it is into satan's eden where he said just as the eve met satan in the form of a man whom we call or know as a serpent and spoke to him and was deceived by him face to face he said so will this bride of the last day meet satan face to face and he's going to speak to her and tell lies to her but that doesn't mean there's one man he's talking about all these false prophets and preachers claiming to be you know that they have the truth even in the message they claim they have the fullness of the word and then they'll come to you and they'll say wonderful things and you can't deny it you've got to say amen you gotta praise the lord amen then you see go off a little here hallelujah and you begin to recognize right you you re you realize the psychology that's being taught here you realize the religious knowledge that's been given over here you realize that these little things it's wonderful and you just leave them because they got to play their part you understand to bring it practical the snakes got to play their part uh like i've told it of before they tried to kill off the mosquitoes in the swamps of uh in florida there and found that when they tried to kill that the frogs begin to die because they were living by jumping and catching those mosquitoes and then when they look the fish start to turn belly up in the water because they used to live off of the frogs who would go and sit on those lily pads and wait to jump and catch the mosquitoes so the fish start to die and then they notice alligators starting to die who used to live on the fish you know that's the ecosystem in other words right and they broke the whole thing everything whether it's a reptile whether it's this that they got their part they got to play you don't have to agree with them you don't have to love them you don't have to pick up the snake to prove nothing but the fact is they got their parts to play so god wants you to only recognize it all right it's only after that thing tries to attack you then you have to defend yourself but other than leave it alone it's all right my goodness you think that abel didn't know and that he still would shake the hand of cain and really love him not not hate him because who he was my brother praised god and he was his brother but the fact is he knew what spirit was back there he knew what germ what seed was back there and he knew how to conduct himself under those conditions of what was back there amen see the first bride deceived the second bride deceived there are deceivers now of that third bride deceivers of the third bride how by high breathing the word look in there it's telling you in there there will be some in this message because of the lack of revelation anointed once at the end of time they are going to deceive by hybriding the word mixing the word with this and with that over there mixing it together and by that they're preaching or teaching a hybrid word and every word every seed will bring forth after it's kind they can't happen that's what it's going to produce amen hallelujah oh my these are the ones that is talking about that will be so close to the elected it would deceive them if it were possible but you'll be so close you can't use your eyes to prove the difference because it's so close that lady is a christian that young man is a real believer look their works look their goodness look at the love they're displaying he says you can't even show more love than the christian scientists you you ultimately you can't show that some of them can display it more than you can but that's not it hallelujah christ in you your hope of glory amen he that is in you greater is he than he that is within the world blessed be the name of the living god hallelujah remember all of this for god has never placed signs ahead of his word you know where we are in the message now after they have gone through the cycle of preaching this message over and over and over again then they're going to now be forced to start to produce signs and wonders and miracles and then start to claim that that's the the latter rain and whatnot falling now amen my friends i want you to know that that will urge them now to start producing signs amen and place emphasis on signs amen oh my back here you see because they're placing signs because they want to say that is going to vindicate them that is going to prove that the word they are teaching is the truth later here brother branham says they want to use it as added proof of the word added proof of the word but remember the word was first before them signs the word first amen hallelujah amen never place signs ahead of this word hallelujah because the word is first hallelujah now to prove it jehovah's speaking to elijah what did he say to that woman bake me a cake first hallelujah then you watch and you will see the miracle happen see the word had to come first hallelujah and we know from this a lot of religious seducing spirits is what he's talking about you are to watch for them right within the ranks of this message is that right very intellectual very very knowledgeable in other words they're so intellectual they can memorize they can uh compare scripture quotes everything else like that my goodness they're sharp they're everything else brother sister that's what you have got to be aware of don't look at outward appearance don't look at capabilities don't look at accomplishments just look at the word listen to the word that you are hearing he says and see if that agrees with the word amen and you'll know what spirit is back there that is not to say that a brother that hasn't yet come to a full revelation of the word can't say something that that is not the word by mistake because he doesn't know he doesn't know us yet he doesn't know now but uh those are things i can't teach you the holy spirit that teach you for you to know what you're hearing what you're listening and who is speaking to you for that moment we're down to revelation not for the ages but revelation moment to moment satan hits that it's all right reading the bible i'm supposed to do this so he won't do it he already knows that right but the moment-to-moment instant when the holy spirit is working with you and in you and through you uh when you don't even know what to say and in an instant you know there's the answer comes through you or the action comes through you he has no response timing he you don't know what to do because it just happens it's already happened there's nothing you can do about it hallelujah that's where we're at right now brother sister praise god remember just like elijah the word first then watch the miracle happen and so come to the word and then watch the miracles see hallelujah for it is nothing but the seed word itself that the spirit energizes praise the lord in other words the seed the gene that's been sitting and waiting in you that is what the holy spirit energizes to produce or bring forth the miracles the signs and the wonders in his time when he wants to water it quick energize it to do something that he does it for his glory for his praise and honor hallelujah amen praise god hallelujah now we know the true prophet has come and gone how many knows that amen he's already come and gone he has proclaimed the word and we know as we have said before denominations hate his name they literally hate his name you don't know it you don't realize the extent of it but they really hate his name do you have a church and you go there and you just mention his name like that they uh they'll control themselves but they're so angry and they're against that so much they won't want you coming back or being around their people anywhere like that whatsoever oh my so his name is hated by the by the denominations his message has been misunderstood by the denominations and his message is rejected just as jesus the word in flesh was rejected back then the same cycle if you want to take it again misunderstood hated and then finally rejected it's the same thing but now it's on the revealed war that's why he said if they persecute me and the father that's in me they persecute me don't you think that that if you are my sons and daughters than what they persecute you because it will be in you i and you the father and me and i and you then the cycle goes again and they want to hate you and crucify you again maybe not on a cross but they might do it with words they might do it with words and stuff of that nature right oh my don't you see amen now we know praise god hallelujah the bride then is going to have to come to the place where she can't help it anymore just like elijah just like jesus like john like jesus like the

be so much that has been called god's truth by these fakers this is the message oh there's the message there's a preacher preaching the message that once you use the term message people drop their guard when you say oh he's a preaching message they dropped their defenses right but there will be so many fakers amen saying things which has been called god's truth these will be listen to this many

showdown amen the royal sea praise god the ones that in the roots the ones that are he says here in his words the ones with the faith like him abraham see for they are holding to the word of god regardless for as he was predestinated they were predestinated and they are holding to the word of god just like abraham held to the word of god in a pagan idol worshiping community and society that they were in but they could see nothing else because they heard the voice come out go to your country come out your condition come out of that situation come into the land where i have called you come into this great country where i have called you amen but see it will repeat just like the four sport runner come from the wilderness and cried behold the lamb of god that will repeat amen he didn't say this i am now saying this he's talking about now the ministry of the mighty angel the last the best eternal church age messenger hallelujah that will at this time behold the lamb of god praise god

word amen the thing is becoming personalized to everyone that sees the truth in the word of the living god hallelujah amen behold he will say the lamb of god but what he will be doing is pointing the people to see the world born bride it's right here but we weren't i never seen that before though i read the book many times over i heard the sermon but he says at that time he will be pointing the people to see what not the lamb slain back there it's the same lamb again but now he's come back in a bright form and she is going to be having a short season of display and he will be turning their attention to point in them to begin to see and recognize the bride even though she was hidden for a while even though she was behind the scene behind the veil for a while but there has to be a time she's going to be displayed for all to see and know that this is his beloved bride in that hour amen see he will point the people to the ward-born bride but she the bride of christ will point her to the skies amen lord of god i'm going to close right here he'll point them to us and then he'll point her to the skies praise god all blessed be the name of the lord amen it will be jesus screaming
