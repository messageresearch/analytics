[40:04] seated when we look at um you know the
[40:07] word Mary if you go back into the old uh
[40:10] Testament you look up this you know the
[40:12] the meaning of it it wasn't exactly um
[40:15] like the original uh word you know the
[40:17] way that that it that it was defined as
[40:20] today like joyful and you know sometimes
[40:23] uh happy and hilarious or whatever um uh
[40:27] but it actually meant
[40:29] blessed peaceful Pleasant it was
[40:33] expressing Joy rather than uh you know
[40:36] spiritual Joy rather than Earthly Joy
[40:39] you know like happiness happiness you
[40:41] can get happiness from new things you
[40:44] get a new car you're happy for a couple
[40:45] of weeks you're excited you can't wait
[40:47] to see it in the morning you get in
[40:49] there you're looking at everything you
[40:51] know you feel happy oh you got a nice
[40:53] reliable car or you get a new house or
[40:56] you get new clothes and makes you look
[40:58] slimmer makes you look you know and
[41:00] you're happy temporarily and you know
[41:02] these are temporary that's temporary Joy
[41:05] that's temporary happiness but then
[41:08] there's the joy of the Lord which is
[41:10] something that is that is inner it's
[41:14] something that even when you're going
[41:16] through hard times or you're going
[41:18] through serious Temptation or trial
[41:21] you've still got the anchor of the lord
[41:24] inside of you to know that he's got your
[41:26] future got your back he's got you
[41:29] covered regardless of the circumstances
[41:31] it's irrelevant he's got you covered
[41:34] amen praise God and so um you know let's
[41:38] go to the next here brother brandham
[41:39] speaking
[41:41] here he says you know we read this quote
[41:44] last week we're going to other places
[41:46] for pleasure instead of coming to the
[41:50] house of the Lord for pleasure you're
[41:52] looking outside for for real Joy there's
[41:55] no real Joy outside of Christ amen the
[41:58] house of the Lord is the joy of the Lord
[42:01] and listen the joy of the Lord is the
[42:04] joy of his people he rejoices when we
[42:08] Rejoice he rejoices when we receive his
[42:11] word when we when we make him our
[42:14] absolute when we trust him in everything
[42:17] that we're facing regardless of how it
[42:19] might appear amen he wants you to come
[42:22] to church and worship him and be happy
[42:26] and satis FES giving praise and honor
[42:29] and glory and wisdom and might and the
[42:32] power to God you're not giving the power
[42:36] to your ability your your your own
[42:38] strength you're giving him the glory for
[42:41] the power and the overcoming power in
[42:44] your life amen he wants you to do that
[42:48] amen praise God let's look at the next
[42:51] scripture in Proverbs 1513
[42:57] I want you to notice here he says a
[42:59] merry heart maketh a cheerful
[43:02] countenance you know when you're when
[43:04] you're expressing you know real inner
[43:07] Joy your countenance cannot be
[43:11] always you know frowning and like you
[43:14] know you you come you know what I mean
[43:16] you come around somebody and and and you
[43:18] you're just picking up right off of them
[43:20] that they're not really it's not that
[43:22] they're that they're not happy with you
[43:24] it's that they're not satisfied with
[43:26] themselves
[43:27] there's there's something on the inside
[43:29] and their countenance expresses it but
[43:32] the S but by sorrow of the heart the
[43:35] spirit is broken and that's why the
[43:37] scripture says you know you know a merry
[43:39] heart um you know gives us uh you know
[43:43] the joy but a broken Spirit it dries up
[43:46] the bones it actually you got to be
[43:49] careful that you don't get into a
[43:51] negative uh you know a negative
[43:53] atmosphere and countenance and attitude
[43:57] you want to get away from all of that
[43:58] the heart of him that hath understanding
[44:01] seeketh knowledge but the mouth of fools
[44:03] feedeth on
[44:05] foolishness we want to feed on the word
[44:07] of God we want to understand by the word
[44:11] not by the world we're not interested in
[44:14] knowing you know that you know oh well
[44:16] I'm depressed so I need to go see a
[44:18] counselor you need to go see Christ he's
[44:21] the counselor the Mighty God the Prince
[44:24] of Peace the Everlasting father
[44:27] amen he'll he'll do for you what no
[44:30] counselor can do in this earth in this
[44:33] time and in this season amen praise God
[44:37] all the days of The Afflicted are evil
[44:40] but he that is of a merry heart have a
[44:43] continual
[44:44] Feast the word will never stop blessing
[44:47] you when you come into that relationship
[44:51] with the Lord you've taken him as your
[44:53] absolute you'll have a continual Feast
[44:56] on the word of God Amen better is a
[44:59] little with the fear of the Lord than
[45:01] great treasures and trouble therewith
[45:05] amen praise God you know Solomon he had
[45:08] a he had a revelation because you know
[45:10] all these most of these Proverbs they're
[45:12] they're written by Solomon a lot of them
[45:15] look at the next uh you know the next
[45:18] scripture here he says here in Proverbs
[45:20] 17 verse one better is a dry
[45:23] morsel and quietness therein therewith
[45:27] than a house full of sacrifices with
[45:30] Strife now you need to understand when
[45:33] when Solomon was writing these things
[45:35] first you need to understand who Solomon
[45:37] was Solomon was one of if not the
[45:41] richest you know in his time the richest
[45:44] man on earth the richest king on Earth
[45:48] my God he had he had 700 wives with 300
[45:51] more in the in in in the uh you know as
[45:54] concubines in the waiting so a thousand
[45:57] wives he had so many children being born
[46:00] to him every year you couldn't even
[46:02] count
[46:03] them can you imagine he had more wealth
[46:07] than you could possibly imagine his
[46:09] wealth was greater than than you know
[46:12] Apple Microsoft Amazon and and Tesla put
[46:17] together in what they make in a year he
[46:20] had more than that just coming in
[46:23] probably on a monthly basis he had
[46:26] Cities of Gold
[46:28] old can you
[46:30] imagine he had wives that could go
[46:32] shopping a thousand of them every day
[46:35] and he'd never run out of
[46:36] money we got one wife we got to say
[46:39] honey go
[46:40] [Applause]
[46:43] easy but you can you imagine so here
[46:46] Solomon had he had some wisdom in him
[46:49] when he when he would say better is a
[46:50] dry morsel in other words I'd rather
[46:53] just you know have just enough and in a
[46:55] nice quiet home
[46:57] without you know you go home and and you
[47:00] know right away you know a man he comes
[47:02] home from work and you know maybe the
[47:04] wife's been at home all day and you know
[47:06] she's been having a rough day with the
[47:07] kids and right away boy look out you
[47:10] deal with them now I've had to deal with
[47:12] them all day you know and all of a
[47:14] sudden there goes the fiery trial right
[47:16] you know the Peace of Mind amen but you
[47:19] know we need to understand that truly uh
[47:25] peace and and and Joy doesn't come from
[47:28] the things of the world because Solomon
[47:30] made it very clear here many many times
[47:34] you know through many of his Proverbs
[47:37] you know uh we we need to see that that
[47:40] true Joy will only come when the Lord
[47:44] places it in you because you have
[47:47] surrendered to him amen you've given
[47:50] your your life over to the Lord Jesus
[47:53] Christ amen and you're trusting him in
[47:56] everything amen praise God let's go to
[47:59] the next scripture here we're going to
[48:02] look at a few things in Ezekiel chapter
[48:05] 36 verse 24- 26 now the the thought here
[48:11] is we need to recognize that a joyful
[48:15] heart so there's something about your
[48:17] heart there's something that's where God
[48:20] places himself that's where he places
[48:24] his word he places the things that that
[48:27] that you can ponder on and you can feed
[48:30] on and you can you know rejoice in and
[48:33] you need to protect your heart too at
[48:35] the same time but he says here not to
[48:38] worry you come out of this world with
[48:42] all kinds of baggage you know you've got
[48:45] all you oh brother Danny you don't
[48:48] understand the things that I've got to
[48:49] deal with the the background that I come
[48:51] out of you know the the the family I had
[48:54] an abusive father an abusive mother you
[48:57] know I I come from a broken family and
[49:00] and my heart's been ripped apart it's
[49:03] been torn up but here in Ezekiel he says
[49:06] for I will take you from among the
[49:09] Heathen and gather you out of all
[49:12] countries now we know this is talking
[49:13] about Israel but you are a type of
[49:15] Israel the church is a type of Israel so
[49:19] anything you read in the Old Testament
[49:20] where God is speaking directly to Israel
[49:23] he's also that's him speaking to his
[49:26] wife the bride the true church the
[49:29] Gentile Church of this day and we were
[49:32] all heathens amen every single one of
[49:36] us and he says I'll gather you out of
[49:39] all the countries out of all the
[49:40] denominations out of all the the
[49:42] teachings you know all the different
[49:44] backgrounds that you've come out of and
[49:46] will'll bring you into your own land a
[49:50] place where you can know that this is
[49:53] not somebody else's land this is the
[49:55] land I've given you
[49:57] this is the life I've given you this is
[50:00] the blessings and the joy that I've
[50:02] given you this is not something you've
[50:04] got to work for this is not something
[50:06] that you deserve you didn't work it up
[50:10] no I'm giving it to you this is this is
[50:13] what's so amazing that you know that
[50:16] that when when I came to the Lord 30
[50:18] years ago I realized my God I didn't
[50:21] deserve any of this but he gave it
[50:25] freely because he knew that he had to
[50:29] call you and place you and position you
[50:32] where he needed
[50:34] you and so he says here um I'll gather
[50:38] you bring you into your own land then
[50:41] will I sprinkle clean water upon you and
[50:44] you shall be clean listen when God
[50:47] purges you of your sin it never happened
[50:49] in the first place that's true
[50:52] justification he went to the Cross once
[50:55] amen for for all amen all you got to do
[50:59] is accept it receive it and the water of
[51:01] the word cleanses you washes you amen
[51:04] from all he says then will I sprinkle
[51:07] clean water upon you and ye shall be
[51:09] clean from all your filthiness and from
[51:12] all your Idols will I cleanse you a new
[51:16] heart will I give you and a new spirit
[51:20] will I put in you aren't you glad to
[51:23] know that you don't you don't have to
[51:25] rely upon you know all the broken heart
[51:29] experiences of your past you don't need
[51:31] to carry them anymore because he says
[51:34] I'll going to give you a brand new heart
[51:36] I'm going to place a a heart of Flesh in
[51:39] you go to the next slide here he says he
[51:42] says for and I will take away the Stony
[51:47] heart out of your flesh and I will give
[51:50] you a an heart of
[51:52] Flesh imagine so he's actually going to
[51:55] restore your heart you think oh there's
[51:59] no way I can I can let that trauma that
[52:02] took place in my life no you you no you
[52:06] can't but he can he can replace it he
[52:11] can replace it with a brand new heart he
[52:13] can take it out of you listen until you
[52:16] experience it you'll you'll understand
[52:18] what I'm saying because I remember when
[52:21] I was under a condition that I thought
[52:24] my heart would explode from the drug
[52:25] addiction I thought I would I'd probably
[52:28] die from a heart attack because of all
[52:31] the drugs I was going to do I thought I
[52:33] I must have cut years off of my life
[52:36] because of the condition that I that I
[52:38] put my my body through and the and the
[52:41] and the anxiety and the you know when
[52:43] when you're when you're on on on drugs
[52:46] you know when you're coming down from
[52:47] those drugs you go through serious
[52:50] anxiety and and your heart is just
[52:52] pounding like crazy and you're wondering
[52:55] my God is you know am I going to make it
[52:57] you know and and God God shows that he
[53:01] can remove all of that give you a brand
[53:03] new heart give you a brand new start
[53:06] take out that Spirit of condemnation
[53:09] that's all over your life the spirit
[53:11] that that constantly torments you and
[53:14] and and keeps you bound into a certain
[53:17] condition amen he says a new heart and a
[53:20] new spirit the new spirit is the Holy
[53:24] Spirit and the Holy Spirit will guide
[53:26] you into all truth according to the word
[53:29] of God Amen and it's the truth that set
[53:31] you free amen amen praise God hallelujah
[53:36] oh glory to God and ye shall dwell in
[53:39] your
[53:40] land uh amen and I'll cause you to walk
[53:42] in my statutes and ye shall keep my
[53:45] judgments and do them ye shall dwell in
[53:48] the land that I gave to your fathers and
[53:51] ye shall be my people and I will be your
[53:55] God Amen praise God aren't you glad that
[53:59] he is doing all of this amen you didn't
[54:03] there's nothing you have to do except
[54:05] receive it and accept it and humble
[54:08] yourself and allow the Holy Spirit to
[54:11] deal with your life amen praise God
[54:14] glory to God Amen but you know in order
[54:17] for you to come
[54:19] truly to come into this
[54:21] Joy listen we're not talking about put
[54:24] on Joy here
[54:26] we don't need put on
[54:28] Joy we don't need we don't need uh you
[54:31] know uh psychology
[54:34] Joy you know oh you need to go and and
[54:37] and and sit in front of the mirror and
[54:39] you need to just look at yourself and
[54:41] you need to say to yourself I am happy I
[54:43] am happy I am happy I am like a robot
[54:48] what the heck is
[54:50] that it's when you do that by Revelation
[54:56] change is everything now you're talking
[54:59] to yourself and you're saying you're a
[55:01] Son of God you're a child of the king
[55:05] you didn't deserve this but God gave it
[55:08] to you you can receive it you can have
[55:10] it you just need to accept it you need
[55:12] to walk it you need to you know assemble
[55:15] yourself under a Ministry where you're
[55:17] going to receive the pure word of God
[55:20] Amen you're going to you're going to
[55:22] recognize that the that the word is a
[55:23] reality in your life and especially
[55:26] especially in this day and in this hour
[55:28] you know we can talk about the joy of
[55:30] the Lord but let me tell you what the
[55:32] true joy of the Lord is it's when you
[55:35] receive the Holy Ghost and have the
[55:38] ability to recognize the message that
[55:41] God is bringing in your day amen that's
[55:45] calling you out of the certain condition
[55:49] that you're under because God has a
[55:51] portion of the word that he wants you to
[55:55] manifest and overcome in this day am
[55:59] amen amen and the message of this hour
[56:02] is so important you will not nobody will
[56:05] truly experience the true joy of the
[56:08] Lord a brand new spirit unless they
[56:11] receive the word for their
[56:14] day that's the only way you're going to
[56:16] know the true joy of the Lord so if
[56:19] you're wondering why you keep going over
[56:21] this and you you know you keep doing
[56:23] this and and yet you're still miserable
[56:25] you wake you don't want to wake up in
[56:27] the morning it's because you haven't
[56:29] fully surrendered to the purpose of God
[56:32] in your life amen he's personal right
[56:37] now we're you know we could talk about
[56:39] the message of the hour and we know that
[56:41] listen the opening of The Seven
[56:45] Seals this is something that is that is
[56:48] take that that that that has taken place
[56:51] and you've got people now because
[56:53] remember it's not going to be
[56:55] denomination
[56:56] thinking and and teaching that's going
[56:59] to truly bring you into the joy of the
[57:02] Lord I can read all these scriptures but
[57:05] you it's the Revelation behind the
[57:07] scripture that's coming directly into
[57:10] your heart that's becoming alive and
[57:12] bringing it into the current day that
[57:14] you're living in that makes it live
[57:17] through your life until there's a
[57:19] manifestation of the word through your
[57:22] life it's just word the spirit has to
[57:25] give
[57:27] life and so you've got people that you
[57:29] know within the confines of our message
[57:33] okay which is you know because
[57:36] remember the the word of God is in
[57:40] progression when Luther broke away from
[57:42] the Catholic church God was progressing
[57:45] the word he justification then it went
[57:47] to Wesley sanctification then it went to
[57:51] uh uh the Pentecostals and God sent a
[57:54] prophet to the Pentecostal
[57:56] age amen and so that they could so that
[58:00] they could uh come back to the word the
[58:03] original truth because restoration
[58:06] requires us to go back to the original
[58:09] truth of God's word that's why there's
[58:11] so much confusion out there they still
[58:13] don't even know about the fact that God
[58:15] is one they want to put him into a
[58:17] trinity and they want to explain it by
[58:20] their by their by their understanding
[58:22] while it's three in one three persons in
[58:25] one the Holy Ghost is the power of God
[58:28] Jesus was the son of God and God is the
[58:32] father and they don't realize that it
[58:34] was just God you know changing his
[58:39] his his body changing his his his
[58:44] position from Elohim the self-existent
[58:46] one coming down to join with humans amen
[58:50] and now in this hour to be inside of
[58:53] humans this is the greatest thing that
[58:56] people are are are are confused about
[58:59] and that's why they're rejecting this
[59:01] word amen it's not because they're
[59:03] rejecting you it's because they're
[59:05] rejecting the message that you represent
[59:08] some will say that the seals are not
[59:10] open then you got some that say the
[59:12] seals are open then you got some that
[59:15] are saying Oh but you got to understand
[59:17] all the seals you got to study it you
[59:19] got to you got to know every horse rider
[59:22] you need to understand the history of
[59:23] the church and this and that they're
[59:26] trying to do it by
[59:27] intellectualism and then you got ones
[59:29] say oh no no it's the life it's all
[59:31] about the life you got to live the life

[59:47] have already made a
[59:48] mistake you don't need to actually do it
[59:51] you just need to think
[59:53] it hallelujah praise God so don't be
[59:56] looking for Perfection when Jesus was on
[59:59] the earth in his first coming notice how
[1:00:01] he went to those that were in need he
[1:00:04] didn't go to the righteous he went to
[1:00:06] those that were sick and needed a
[1:00:08] physician amen amen he went to those
[1:00:10] that you would look he goes to a a a
[1:00:13] simple fisherman and calls him and says
[1:00:16] you're going to fish for men now he was
[1:00:18] a hot-tempered
[1:00:20] Peter he goes to a tax collector who was
[1:00:23] all he would think about is money money
[1:00:25] money money I got to collect money every
[1:00:27] time I collect 10 cents I get one for me
[1:00:30] all that was on his mind was money but
[1:00:32] Jesus says follow me and he instantly
[1:00:35] dropped what he was doing and followed
[1:00:37] him and then he goes to see a woman at
[1:00:40] the well oh who was a
[1:00:44] prostitute a lot of people in this
[1:00:46] message they want to take marriage and
[1:00:48] divorce and they want to cut through
[1:00:50] people's lives right away they want to
[1:00:53] oh yeah yeah oh married more than yeah
[1:00:56] oh okay okay they they got no
[1:00:59] Revelation Jesus came to the woman at
[1:01:02] the well and she had
[1:01:04] representation and yet all the priests
[1:01:06] and all the ones that were so righteous
[1:01:08] that followed the letter to the you know
[1:01:11] the letter to a tea and and could quote
[1:01:13] the scriptures and quote brother
[1:01:15] brandham and and quote all these things
[1:01:18] yet they had no character for the Bride
[1:01:21] of Jesus Christ to be the one that he
[1:01:23] was going to dwell in in this hour so
[1:01:25] that he could rule in your life and in
[1:01:29] this
[1:01:31] world people got confused between the
[1:01:34] message and the messenger
[1:01:37] yes let's read the quote here amen amen
[1:01:44] listen from the from the message birth
[1:01:47] pains oh word
[1:01:49] Believers give into my message hear me
[1:01:54] not my message
[1:01:56] amen but his message that he firmly
[1:01:59] declares to be the truth you've got to
[1:02:02] choose from somewhere you can't sit
[1:02:05] still after this you've got to make your
[1:02:08] choice amen don't pay any attention to
[1:02:11] the
[1:02:13] messenger is that is that brother
[1:02:15] brandham saying that don't pay any
[1:02:17] attention to the messenger look at the
[1:02:20] message it is congregation says amen
[1:02:24] that's what it is see
[1:02:26] it isn't that don't notice the the the
[1:02:29] little uh baldheaded you know person cuz
[1:02:32] it's just it's just a human being all
[1:02:36] and we're just all the same but watch
[1:02:39] what's happening that's what declares it
[1:02:42] I was taken go to the next
[1:02:45] slide he says now I know people say all
[1:02:49] kinds of
[1:02:50] things we know that that's lot that a
[1:02:55] lot of it's not right oh brother
[1:02:58] brandham was God you only got to say
[1:03:01] exactly what he said he never made a
[1:03:03] single mistake they only want to quote
[1:03:06] exactly they don't want to say anything
[1:03:07] else if the prophet never said it and
[1:03:10] you don't say it exactly the way he said
[1:03:13] it he's saying don't look at me he says
[1:03:17] it's not right he says I can't answer
[1:03:19] for what other any man says I got to
[1:03:22] answer for what I say I can only say
[1:03:25] whether it's truth or not and I'm the
[1:03:28] one has to be responsible for it not
[1:03:31] what somebody else says I can't judge no
[1:03:34] one I wasn't sent to judge but to preach
[1:03:38] the
[1:03:39] message so we need to recognize that
[1:03:43] Jesus Christ has always been the message
[1:03:47] voice all the way through right from
[1:03:50] Genesis all the way down to
[1:03:54] Revelations and we need to realized that
[1:03:56] the message has never sto it didn't stop
[1:03:59] when brother brandham went off the scene
[1:04:01] no no brother Bram says I must decrease
[1:04:04] so that he can increase amen he came to
[1:04:07] introduce us to the mighty Angel himself
[1:04:10] in
[1:04:11] 1963 yes sir and when the mighty angel
[1:04:14] came on the scene he was now coming to
[1:04:17] take a bride to possess a body that he
[1:04:21] could have full preeminence in so that
[1:04:23] he could live this word and Manifest
[1:04:26] this word and until you come to a place
[1:04:29] where you realize amen that this has
[1:04:32] happened and that now the five-fold
[1:04:35] ministry is where we receive instruction
[1:04:38] by the word of God being preached amen
[1:04:40] Faith cometh by hearing hearing what the
[1:04:43] word amen until we come into that we
[1:04:47] can't even experience the true joy of
[1:04:49] the
[1:04:51] Lord oh Saints amen let us not forget
[1:04:56] what God is doing in our
[1:04:59] day why it is that we are different amen
[1:05:03] we're different because he came and said
[1:05:07] on that day ye shall know that I am in
[1:05:11] you you and me and I and you he gave us
[1:05:14] a revelation that that this would be the
[1:05:17] day where now he would not only just
[1:05:20] take a body to go to Calvary now he
[1:05:23] would take a body to go in the rapture
[1:05:25] amen amen praise God he was going to
[1:05:28] come and take human vessels he was not
[1:05:31] coming to perfect humans there's nobody
[1:05:35] perfect in this place but it's a
[1:05:37] revelation brother Braham says the
[1:05:39] Rapture is a revelation and if the
[1:05:42] Revelation is in your heart you need to
[1:05:45] guard that Revelation don't let the
[1:05:47] enemy come and steal your joy what is
[1:05:50] your joy it's the word it's the
[1:05:52] Revelation it's what God is doing in
[1:05:54] this hour don't let them steal it away
[1:05:57] from you even within the confines of
[1:05:59] this message listen there's people that
[1:06:01] are falling away you know why they're
[1:06:03] falling away is because they can't
[1:06:06] believe that you are actually saying
[1:06:08] that he's in you yes that's what's
[1:06:12] that's what's blowing the people's minds
[1:06:14] that they can't understand Oh you mean
[1:06:16] God is is now coming to a to a church a
[1:06:19] small group of people on the Earth that
[1:06:22] are going to be possessed of The Same
[1:06:25] Spirit and he's going to come in to flaw
[1:06:27] human beings
[1:06:29] yes amen but he's going to give you a
[1:06:31] brand new heart he's going to give you a
[1:06:33] brand new spirit and he's going to take
[1:06:36] absolute control in your life so that
[1:06:38] you will manifest him and no longer
[1:06:42] manifest the life that you've been
[1:06:44] living up until now
[1:06:48] amenes greatest Miracle amen glory to
[1:06:53] God hallelujah recognize
[1:06:56] in your day not by psychology not by
[1:07:00] man's teachings but by the revelation of
[1:07:03] the opening of the word of God in this
[1:07:06] day amen amen The Book of Revelations is
[1:07:09] so misunderstood why because it has to
[1:07:13] be revealed it has to be revealed
[1:07:16] personally amen this is not a world wide
[1:07:20] calling this is god listen the Rapture
[1:07:23] for example people think that listen
[1:07:25] Jesus didn't come to everybody globally
[1:07:29] you know that the the churches out there
[1:07:30] you know what they're waiting for
[1:07:31] they're all waiting for one day they're
[1:07:33] going to the skies are going to open up
[1:07:35] they're going to receive a a an alert on
[1:07:38] their phone look
[1:07:40] up Jesus is coming and they're looking
[1:07:44] for a worldwide Revival that the Lord is
[1:07:47] going to come all at the same time and
[1:07:50] the whole world and all the Christians
[1:07:52] are all just going to float up into the
[1:07:54] air to towards the
[1:07:59] Lord that's not what's going to happen
[1:08:02] Saints the second coming of the Lord has
[1:08:04] already taken place amen and that's why
[1:08:07] they'll say wait a minute you're cuckoo
[1:08:09] what do you mean he's already come he's
[1:08:11] already come and he's in me amen he's
[1:08:14] manifesting his word through my life I'm
[1:08:18] only telling you what he shows me what
[1:08:20] what I see in the word when I when I
[1:08:23] when I talk to somebody about baptism I
[1:08:25] speak by the Holy Ghost because the Holy
[1:08:27] Ghost that's in me can never go against
[1:08:29] the word so I'm going to tell you have
[1:08:31] you been baptized and you say to me I
[1:08:34] got baptized as a baby the scripture
[1:08:36] says he that believeth and is baptized
[1:08:39] shall be saved so if you've got
[1:08:42] representation in you as a son or a
[1:08:45] daughter of God then you cannot deny the
[1:08:48] word you're going to see that you're
[1:08:49] going to say what just like the unic
[1:08:52] when Philip was explaining to him about
[1:08:54] baptism the unic says there's a pool of
[1:08:57] water right away he understood that the
[1:09:00] the see the Revelation instantly brought
[1:09:03] a
[1:09:04] manifestation and that's how you'll know
[1:09:06] if it's a reality to you somebody will
[1:09:09] tell you about the word somebody will
[1:09:11] speak to you about baptism about
[1:09:13] receiving the Holy Ghost and then you'll
[1:09:15] just you know and if and if it
[1:09:18] doesn't have a representation and it
[1:09:22] doesn't bring forth an immediate
[1:09:24] response
[1:09:26] when God does it amen then you know
[1:09:30] there's something
[1:09:33] missing there's no way somebody baptized
[1:09:36] as a baby can read that scripture he
[1:09:39] that believeth how does a baby believe
[1:09:42] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[1:09:45] be
[1:09:46] saved he that says that Jesus Christ Has
[1:09:50] Come In the Flesh he has the spirit of
[1:09:54] Christ amen but the one that
[1:09:57] says no I don't believe it the scripture
[1:10:00] says that is the spirit of antichrist
[1:10:04] that wants to deny the word of
[1:10:06] God so how can you have real Joy how can
[1:10:10] you have a a a a a merry
[1:10:14] heart when you don't even know what you
[1:10:18] believe amen you will bring forth an
[1:10:21] instant manifestation when the word
[1:10:24] strikes your soul and it lights up
[1:10:26] inside of your heart amen praise God
[1:10:29] hallelujah that's the reality amen so we
[1:10:32] don't want to mix up the messenger with
[1:10:35] the message is that clear Amen brother
[1:10:38] Brandon himself says don't look at me
[1:10:40] pay attention to the message amen that's
[1:10:43] why it's called voice of God yes sir you
[1:10:46] cannot take his office as a prophet away
[1:10:50] from him he fulfilled Malachi 4 he
[1:10:53] fulfilled revelation 107 amen there is
[1:10:57] no way you can remove that from the
[1:10:59] scripture in the same way that you are
[1:11:01] now fulfilling Revelations 108 to
[1:11:05] 11 amen you are the manifestation of the
[1:11:09] voice of God in these last days that
[1:11:11] will bring forth the true pure
[1:11:14] unadulterated word amen that's why Jesus
[1:11:17] said my sheep hear my voice amen they
[1:11:21] won't follow a false voice they'll hear
[1:11:24] his voice
[1:11:26] amen praise God glory to God Amen but
[1:11:30] it's the greatest battle for the true
[1:11:32] church to actually believe that Christ
[1:11:34] is here now he's come his second coming
[1:11:39] took place in
[1:11:40] 1963 sir and he's now moving in the
[1:11:44] midst of people and one awakens over
[1:11:47] here another one Awakening over there
[1:11:49] another one's eyes are opening up here
[1:11:52] another one comes into the church and
[1:11:54] all of a sudden wait a minute minute
[1:11:56] what I God sent a prophet and and these
[1:12:00] things have taken place in our time just
[1:12:03] like when Moses came when he came to
[1:12:05] Egypt just like when God sent every
[1:12:08] Prophet when he sent John the Baptist
[1:12:11] and he said a greater he says he says
[1:12:14] I'm not worthy he says Behold the Lamb
[1:12:17] of God who takes away the sins of the
[1:12:18] world he was the Forerunner to his first
[1:12:21] coming well there had to be another
[1:12:24] coming amen the second coming and then
[1:12:27] even Jesus himself said Elijah has come
[1:12:31] and Elijah shall surely come he's
[1:12:34] talking about the spirit of Elijah
[1:12:36] coming into individuals that will be
[1:12:40] identified by the word of God and
[1:12:42] they'll only say what the word says and
[1:12:45] then the holy spirit will vindicate what
[1:12:47] he said amen glory to
[1:12:50] God so he comes in the same way amen
[1:12:55] let's go to the next scripture let's
[1:12:57] move along
[1:12:58] here in Proverbs
[1:13:01] 42-23 says my son we're talking about
[1:13:05] now having the Revelation in your heart
[1:13:08] we need to we need to protect ourselves
[1:13:11] from allowing the enemy to steal away
[1:13:13] the faith that God has placed into our
[1:13:15] hearts and believing this message amen
[1:13:18] praise God attend to my words incline
[1:13:21] thine ear unto my sayings let them not
[1:13:24] depart from Thine Eyes keep them in the
[1:13:27] midst of thine
[1:13:29] heart Oh Glory to God for they are life
[1:13:33] unto those that find them and health to
[1:13:36] all their flesh keep thy heart with all
[1:13:40] diligence for out of it are the issues
[1:13:44] of
[1:13:45] life you mean God will place things into
[1:13:48] your heart that will allow you to
[1:13:51] identify with eternal life that you will
[1:13:55] will recognize that out of you will come
[1:13:57] the issues of life people will be able
[1:14:00] to fellowship with you hear you testify
[1:14:03] of the word of God and recognize that
[1:14:06] God is in their midst the issues of life
[1:14:10] will flow from our lives when we guard
[1:14:12] our heart amen you mean that's exactly
[1:14:16] where he places his
[1:14:18] Spirit right in that empty space they've
[1:14:21] even proven it there's there's a there's
[1:14:24] an empty space in in a human heart and
[1:14:28] there's energy and life that flows from
[1:14:30] there and that is the life of God Amen
[1:14:33] praise God glory to God and so the Lord
[1:14:36] says protect yourself guard yourself
[1:14:40] from the enemy from trying to steal away
[1:14:42] your your your Revelation on on what God
[1:14:45] is doing in your life amen because don't

[1:19:26] experiences you you you you're you're
[1:19:28] like a broken spirit and what does a
[1:19:30] broken Spirit do it dries up the bones
[1:19:34] it dries up your body your blood flow
[1:19:37] isn't the same you start to feel the
[1:19:39] pain of arthritis because your body is
[1:19:41] drying
[1:19:43] up you you you need the oil of the Holy
[1:19:46] Ghost you need to feed on the word more
[1:19:49] you need to to to get into more
[1:19:51] Fellowship around the word amen praise
[1:19:53] God you need to you need to count your
[1:19:56] blessings you need to look back at What
[1:19:59] the Lord Has Done and know that he can
[1:20:01] do it over and over and over again amen
[1:20:05] you don't need to stay in the condition
[1:20:06] that you're in amen you can you can move
[1:20:09] on with life and you can let go of those
[1:20:12] hurts of the past amen glory to God you
[1:20:15] need to guard yourself from Joy Stealers
[1:20:18] you know what Joy Stealers
[1:20:20] are sometimes it's your own friends and
[1:20:22] family y amen you know they're in your
[1:20:26] heart because you love them and their
[1:20:28] family but they can't really be a part
[1:20:30] of your life in Christ because they
[1:20:32] don't
[1:20:34] believe they don't
[1:20:37] receive they put doubting oh you don't
[1:20:39] have to do that why are you always
[1:20:41] wearing a dress you can wear pants why
[1:20:44] is there something wrong with wearing
[1:20:45] pants no listen a woman and a man God
[1:20:49] made them
[1:20:51] different and the scripture says that a
[1:20:54] woman should should dress in a way that
[1:20:56] is you
[1:20:58] know humble not
[1:21:01] exposing not these tight clothes that
[1:21:04] most of women wear these days they're
[1:21:06] they're wearing super tight clothes but
[1:21:08] for to show that they have a beautiful
[1:21:11] body well you know what that does to men
[1:21:14] it causes them to lust after them
[1:21:16] whether you like it or not it happens
[1:21:18] because the man is designed in a certain
[1:21:21] way and the character and the and the
[1:21:23] makeup of a man without the Holy Ghost
[1:21:26] he can get easily pulled into that kind
[1:21:29] of
[1:21:30] stuff that's why you need the Holy Ghost
[1:21:33] to bring real Joy because the worst
[1:21:35] thing is when you you get caught and
[1:21:37] then you you know you get into a a a a a
[1:21:40] wrong relationship and it destroys your
[1:21:43] whole life your whole family your
[1:21:45] children everything else it's happening
[1:21:48] all
[1:21:50] over family destruction is what Satan is
[1:21:53] is is just
[1:21:55] you know moving in such a way and you
[1:21:58] know you think but you mean even in the
[1:22:00] Simplicity of the way that a woman
[1:22:02] dresses or a man dresses or or a man
[1:22:05] presents himself and the kind of
[1:22:07] character that he has can make a
[1:22:09] difference yes it
[1:22:12] can because this is the hour where the
[1:22:14] word will
[1:22:16] manifest and if you are the word you're
[1:22:19] not going to go against the word the
[1:22:22] spirit of Christ in you is going to
[1:22:25] dress you as a woman modestly in a way
[1:22:28] that you're going to express Christ in a
[1:22:32] in a humble
[1:22:35] spirit thank you Jesus amen praise God
[1:22:38] so sometimes we gotta we got to let go
[1:22:41] of those those those people that are Joy
[1:22:44] stealers in our lives unbelief around
[1:22:46] our lives listen we love our family I'm
[1:22:49] not telling you you got to you know you
[1:22:50] got to leave your family and this and
[1:22:52] that no there's a way that you can
[1:22:55] separate by not by understanding that
[1:22:58] that you can't you can't convince them
[1:23:01] of anything and they need to know that
[1:23:03] they can't convince you and you need to
[1:23:06] have the right kind of relationship amen
[1:23:09] instead of them trying to constantly
[1:23:11] turn you away from from what you believe
[1:23:15] amen and so if they're if they're going
[1:23:17] to constantly do that they're going to
[1:23:19] every time you get together there's a
[1:23:20] struggle there's a fight that means you
[1:23:22] need to separate
[1:23:25] yes even Jesus himself said I didn't
[1:23:28] come to bring everybody together I come
[1:23:30] with a sword which is the word and the
[1:23:33] word will separate amen us and if
[1:23:36] there's if there's ever been an hour
[1:23:39] where the true church just like Israel
[1:23:42] just look at Israel remember what we
[1:23:44] said about Israel being a type of the
[1:23:46] Bride of the of the Gentile Church well
[1:23:49] just look at the condition of Israel I
[1:23:51] don't I don't need to say much you can
[1:23:52] just go and research it yourself
[1:23:55] she's hated by most of the world
[1:23:59] now you listen to the news you you know
[1:24:02] I was listening yesterday and they were
[1:24:03] saying and and you know these meetings
[1:24:06] that they're having in in Qatar certain
[1:24:09] individuals are going there and the
[1:24:11] phrase that caught my attention was and
[1:24:15] this way Israel can know how much
[1:24:18] pressure is on
[1:24:19] them they need to know that that there's
[1:24:22] pressure on them to to AG age to a
[1:24:26] ceasefire not the pressure that that
[1:24:28] that that should be on the enemy the
[1:24:31] devil habas all these wicked demons that
[1:24:35] are that are destroying and killing
[1:24:38] innocent
[1:24:39] people they're looking at
[1:24:42] Israel and not recognizing what's really
[1:24:45] going on how the enemy is trying to
[1:24:48] destroy that's why Trump you know one
[1:24:51] thing I can say about Trump and I we'll
[1:24:53] see but you know if it if it comes to
[1:24:55] but he says he says all hell is going to
[1:24:59] break loose on the day that I come into
[1:25:01] office if all of those hostages are not
[1:25:06] released let's see what
[1:25:10] happens because that really you don't
[1:25:13] give into the enemy you don't give into
[1:25:15] the devil no you don't give into his
[1:25:18] attacks you don't let him attack your
[1:25:21] family attack your children attack your
[1:25:23] finan attack your health no sir you go
[1:25:27] back with the word of God and you tell
[1:25:29] them the Lord God of Israel the god of
[1:25:32] Heaven and Earth the the Lord Jehovah
[1:25:35] Gyra he provides my needs the Lord
[1:25:38] Jehovah shama he's my healer he's my
[1:25:41] peace Shalom amen he is the Lord God
[1:25:43] that provides for for me for my home for
[1:25:46] my
[1:25:47] family and you stay
[1:25:50] there and then you can truly experience
[1:25:55] the joy of the Lord amen
[1:25:58] amen let's go to the next
[1:26:01] scripture in John chapter in 1 John
[1:26:04] 5:14-15 it says and this is the
[1:26:07] confidence that we have in him that if
[1:26:10] we ask anything according to his will he
[1:26:13] hears us and if we know that he hears us
[1:26:17] whatsoever we ask we know that we have
[1:26:20] the petitions that we desire of him but
[1:26:23] you know that you can't go to him when
[1:26:25] you've
[1:26:28] got conviction in your heart when you've
[1:26:31] got condemnation in your
[1:26:34] heart the true understanding of a son or
[1:26:38] daughter of God is that there is no
[1:26:41] condemnation to them that are in
[1:26:43] Christ and so when you're approaching
[1:26:46] the Lord if you've come into a real
[1:26:49] relationship with God and you go to him
[1:26:52] in prayer there should be be nothing
[1:26:55] between you and that
[1:26:57] prayer there should be no
[1:27:00] condemnation if there's things that
[1:27:02] you're carrying you if you've got if
[1:27:04] you've got like I said you've got an
[1:27:05] unforgiving Spirit on you it's in your
[1:27:08] heart and if your heart condemns you God
[1:27:10] don't hear
[1:27:12] you you need to you need to make things
[1:27:15] right you need to get rid of those
[1:27:17] things that are holding you back from
[1:27:20] having a Pure Clean Heart before the
[1:27:23] Lord and then allow him to to just pour
[1:27:27] into you everything that you have need
[1:27:30] of Amen every need the scripture says he
[1:27:34] hears us whatsoever we ask we know that
[1:27:37] we have the petitions that we desire of
[1:27:39] him amen asking for the right thing with
[1:27:43] the wrong heart is not God's
[1:27:46] will you got to have the right heart
[1:27:48] when you're praying for a brother or a
[1:27:50] sister amen or you're praying for your
[1:27:52] children
[1:27:54] you want to pray in the right way you
[1:27:56] want to oh Lord let the devil go after
[1:28:03] them what kind of a character is
[1:28:07] that Lord have mercy on them have mercy
[1:28:12] on my brother and sister have mercy on
[1:28:15] my boss have mercy on these situations
[1:28:18] that are that are bringing such you know
[1:28:21] such pain and and and sorrow in my my
[1:28:25] life let those things go so that you can
[1:28:28] come to the Lord the bi listen the Lord
[1:28:30] said if you're not willing to forgive
[1:28:33] God ain't going to forgive
[1:28:35] you he's not going to set you free from
[1:28:37] the things because you can be a son or a
[1:28:40] daughter of God hold an unforgiving
[1:28:43] heart and you can stay in a certain
[1:28:45] condition for
[1:28:47] Years yet you're a son or a daughter of
[1:28:50] God but you're not experiencing the joy
[1:28:52] of the Lord because of your exper erence
[1:28:54] and because you're holding on to the
[1:28:56] enemy's
[1:29:01] lies glory to God so if you're coming to
[1:29:03] God to ask for something and you're
[1:29:06] holding on to an offense against someone
[1:29:09] violating the law of love and lacking
[1:29:11] Joy your prayer likely won't be answered
[1:29:18] yes in
[1:29:19] Matthew 5:8 next slide it says your

[1:33:14] word the more you come to church the
[1:33:16] more you
[1:33:18] want it's it's the same like Addiction
[1:33:20] in this flesh it works the same with the
[1:33:22] Lord the more of him you get the more
[1:33:24] you want am the more experiences you
[1:33:27] have in the Supernatural the more you
[1:33:29] want the more you see him moving in this

[1:33:39] fitness program you don't want those
[1:33:41] Foods anymore you don't want all that

[1:33:46] sudden it just automatically starts
[1:33:48] falling away well the same thing with
[1:33:50] your mind because you you feeding on too
[1:33:53] much garbage you got to be careful what
[1:33:55] you feed on is what you're going to

[1:34:37] lousy there's another way that you can
[1:34:39] deal with
[1:34:40] that say you know what honey I've picked
[1:34:43] up some nice fresh celery and
[1:34:46] strawberries and you know blueberries
[1:34:48] and and uh you know some some uh some
[1:34:51] really you know like look for things

[1:40:40] then but I'm being serious and saying
[1:40:42] that it's good for you to change and and
[1:40:45] and and don't get into a countenance
[1:40:47] where you're always thinking about the
[1:40:49] negativity come out of it and let the

[1:40:57] here just a few minutes but laughter is
[1:40:59] good for your soul and so I'm asking you
[1:41:02] when's the last time you had a good
[1:41:03] Belly Laugh you need to take some time
[1:41:06] to arrange a time where you can get
[1:41:09] together with your friends and your
[1:41:10] family and maybe watch a good Christian
[1:41:13] comedian and get into a good Belly Laugh
[1:41:16] amen one guy that I watch every now and
[1:41:19] then is Michael
[1:41:21] Jr okay look him up on YouTube and watch
[1:41:26] him he's funny he'll get you into a
[1:41:29] belly laugh amen because you know he

[1:41:35] and he's a real Christian too and he you
[1:41:36] know like I mean he loves the Lord amen
[1:41:40] praise God okay so you know but you know
[1:41:44] life can you know get hard sometimes and
[1:41:47] we need to do things just like we need
[1:41:49] to exercise when our bodies get you know
[1:41:51] a little bit out of out of whack right
[1:41:54] amen and you know now I want to just
[1:41:56] bring I looked you know I found some of
[1:41:58] this information on the internet there's
[1:42:00] a renowned
[1:42:01] neurosurgeon his name is Dr Avery
[1:42:04] Jackson and he's done a lot of research
[1:42:07] on the effects of laughter and joy on
[1:42:10] the health of your spirit your soul and
[1:42:13] your body and he shared how recent
[1:42:15] research proves that laughter in
[1:42:18] conjunction with exercise will repair
[1:42:22] your body far faster than any natural
[1:42:28] process it's a proven fact so you know
[1:42:31] how you got to go on the treadmill once
[1:42:33] in a while put on a
[1:42:36] comedian go on the
[1:42:38] treadmill and watch and
[1:42:40] laugh and get into a good laugh you're
[1:42:43] going to burn a lot more calories a lot
[1:42:45] quicker and pain is going to leave your
[1:42:47] body amen glory to God the good news is
[1:42:50] that you can make a decision you can
[1:42:53] decide like I said you can decide that
[1:42:55] you're going to have a fun night that
[1:42:58] you're going to get we've done it Pastor
[1:43:00] Simon there was times where we got
[1:43:02] together and you know the the you know a
[1:43:04] group of us got together and he' put on
[1:43:06] a a comedian and it was a Christian
[1:43:08] comedian and we'd all have a really good
[1:43:10] time and a good laugh together why was
[1:43:12] he doing that because he
[1:43:14] understood that sometimes you know walk
[1:43:17] in this walk it can get pretty hard
[1:43:19] because we're the target we're
[1:43:21] constantly under bombardment
[1:43:23] we're constantly being attacked and so
[1:43:26] we need to know how to apply the word of
[1:43:29] God in our lives amen and this is just
[1:43:31] another way that we can apply the word
[1:43:33] amen amen I'm giving you and showing you
[1:43:36] scriptures that that to show that God
[1:43:39] has done great things in our lives amen
[1:43:42] laughter increases blood
[1:43:44] flow amen these are four things he says
[1:43:48] laughter improves your blood flow which
[1:43:51] in turn reduces your stress hormones
[1:43:54] lowers your blood pressure and activates
[1:43:57] your immune
[1:43:58] system poor blood flow is the root cause
[1:44:02] of many diseases that's why it's good to
[1:44:05] stretch in the morning A friend of mine
[1:44:08] told me this years ago he said I said
[1:44:12] Ray I mean you're looking so good and
[1:44:14] the way you're still moving he's about
[1:44:16] 10 years older than me and he was
[1:44:17] looking really good he says Danny say
[1:44:19] I'm going to tell you something he says
[1:44:21] all I do is I stretch like yoga just get
[1:44:26] on the ground and just stretch as far as
[1:44:28] you can stretch I'm telling you this
[1:44:30] because I know it works because I do it
[1:44:32] every morning that's my
[1:44:34] wife you stretch your arms out as far as
[1:44:37] you can go until you're feeling like
[1:44:39] like it's almost painful that you're
[1:44:41] stretching and then you're tightening
[1:44:43] your hands and and doing like these are
[1:44:45] simple little things and then stretching
[1:44:46] your body and then pulling your legs
[1:44:48] into your chest and stretching your back
[1:44:51] doing these simple stretches and I'm
[1:44:53] telling you you can get up off the floor
[1:44:56] and you will immediately within minutes
[1:44:58] notice the
[1:45:00] difference and it does work praise God
[1:45:03] Amen because why because when you're
[1:45:06] doing that you're forcing your blood to
[1:45:09] go to these areas they're they're
[1:45:10] actually that's it's blood flow moving
[1:45:13] through your body amen and when blood
[1:45:16] flows through your body it eliminates uh
[1:45:19] you know it it decreases inflammation
[1:45:22] amen man uh you know and and uh it and
[1:45:25] it activates the the the hormones uh you
[1:45:29] know to reduce stress hormones and
[1:45:31] lowers your blood pressure activates
[1:45:33] your immune system amen po praise God
[1:45:36] when you exercise and laugh you are
[1:45:38] increasing blood flow to your brain
[1:45:41] facilitating God's healing mechanism and
[1:45:44] preventing
[1:45:46] disease God has ways of of
[1:45:50] naturally keeping our bodies
[1:45:53] healthy while we're here that's why you
[1:45:56] cannot extend your life on Earth I'm
[1:45:59] sorry you think you can you can't the
[1:46:01] Lord gives and the Lord takes the Bible
[1:46:03] says there's a time to be born and
[1:46:05] there's a time to die God knows exactly
[1:46:08] when you're going to leave this earth
[1:46:10] but one thing that you can do is you can
[1:46:12] live happier you can live healthier you
[1:46:16] can you can you can be you know more
[1:46:19] successful by the habits that you
[1:46:20] develop in your life because there's
[1:46:22] there's still the law of sowing and
[1:46:24] reaping amen these are things that we
[1:46:27] need to recognize you know there's
[1:46:29] practical things in the word of God that
[1:46:31] we need to recognize and apply in our
[1:46:34] lives amen praise God you know
[1:46:37] facilitating these things can repair
[1:46:40] prevent neuro uh degenerative disorders
[1:46:43] like Parkinson's disease
[1:46:46] Alzheimer's amen we can by by by by good
[1:46:52] belly laughs and by good fun Fellowship
[1:46:56] in the Lord you can you can you
[1:46:59] can cast out Spirits because the joy of
[1:47:02] the Lord Spirits can't stay there that's
[1:47:06] why you get into an atmosphere in in in
[1:47:08] a church where the word of God is moving
[1:47:11] and the people are rejoicing they're
[1:47:12] praising God while they're singing while
[1:47:14] they're making a Joyful Noise unto the
[1:47:16] Lord while they're rejoicing all of a
[1:47:18] sudden they're healed from all of a
[1:47:20] sudden that back pain is completely gone
[1:47:23] it's gone it's it's gone it's it's left
[1:47:24] my body why because you were in such a
[1:47:27] presence of God you were rejoicing in
[1:47:29] his goodness and his praise and you were
[1:47:32] instantly healed and delivered right
[1:47:34] there and
[1:47:36] then he inhabits the Praises of his
[1:47:41] people you know that young children on
[1:47:45] average they can have like hundreds of
[1:47:47] belly laughs a week hundreds of
[1:47:50] them but you know us as adults we can
[1:47:52] barely get a few
[1:47:56] in you need to take the time to bring
[1:48:00] more joy naturally into your life
[1:48:04] because you are a son of God you have
[1:48:06] the ability to change the atmospheres
[1:48:09] around you you have the ability to know
[1:48:12] that greater is he that is in you it's
[1:48:15] not based on I'm not this is not
[1:48:17] psychology here we're not preaching
[1:48:18] Psychology today we're preaching from a
[1:48:21] from a revelation of knowing god and and
[1:48:25] and enjoying the Lord allowing his
[1:48:28] laughter his Joy praise God to come into
[1:48:31] our lives he goes on to say here he says
[1:48:33] if you start laughing even when you
[1:48:35] don't want
[1:48:36] to it won't be long that you'll be
[1:48:39] laughing at
[1:48:42] yourself we've done it I remember times
[1:48:45] being around the campfire at the youth
[1:48:47] camps and we get into the joy of the
[1:48:49] Lord oh boy look out and all of a sudden
[1:48:52] the laughter starts to pour out and all
[1:48:54] of a sudden everybody's just laughing
[1:48:56] and everybody's
[1:48:58] looking and they go right off into their
[1:49:00] own laughter because they can't believe
[1:49:01] that look at look at him look at her
[1:49:03] look at you can you believe that why
[1:49:05] because that's the joy of the Lord
[1:49:07] that's God moving in the midst of his
[1:49:09] children amen praise God laughter
[1:49:12] reduces
[1:49:13] pain glory to God he goes on to say here
[1:49:17] uh it can be the opposite of what you
[1:49:19] feel like doing when you're in pain but
[1:49:22] if you you focus on getting yourselves
[1:49:24] to exercise and laugh and get into a
[1:49:29] joyful condition things start to happen
[1:49:33] in your body amen speaking the word

[1:50:40] proven fact while laughter is effective
[1:50:42] at preventing disease it's also it also
