son can you lead us in prayer you yes Lord yes Lord yes Lord amen amen thank you thank you all may we take our Bible we going to Genesis chapter 7 verse one we read verse one and verse 5 and later on uh we will go I I'll let you sit down and I'll read Colossians sorry chonicles 2 chapter 6 chapter 2 chapter 2 verse 6 and verse 9 then I'll bring the word which God has laid upon my heart Genesis 7:1 and the Lord said unto Noah Come Thou and all thy house into the ark for in for thee have I see righteousness before me in this generation my title will be for for thee have I see righteousness before me in this generation so brother you put that one there verse 5 and know did according to all that the Lord commanded him okay thank you Jesus Lord God you know me I'm a simple who don't know much I take myself away father let this your word oh God be a blessing to my my brothers and sisters my pastor everyone that even hearing me oh God online let it be a blessing to them according to your way forgive my sins forgive everybody's sins and take full control in Jesus name amen amen amen may the Lord have his Blessing please be seated the scripture that we read Genesis 7:1 the Lord said unto Noah come down God doesn't change God has called us out from you say Egypt modern Egypt or modern denominations your denomination may be in the family because family traditions and cultural hook you up this day the biggest thing hook people is cultural cultur is strong upon the people and through that they don't want to come out they don't want to come out and worship God you go into the even message churches ho Sunday the pews sometimes full up but the rest of if they are having church for a week all the sanctuary is empty it's not just here alone all over the world and God like Noah days God have seen righteousness in Noah God have seen righteousness in his wife this generation so he says come out come out from your culture come out from your denominations come out anything that is holding you come out because for indeed have I seen righteousness before me in the wife of Christ have I seen righteousness before me the whole world is going to go into tribulation but if you don't come out I cannot judge them I cannot bring my judgment upon them so I'm calling you purposely come out if you don't come out when the plague begin to fail it will fall upon you then you will be a foolish virgin I don't want to do that upon you I warn you to come out and take my word because where is my word my word is where the 54 Ministry as our pastor was saying where God God has ordained and the word is coming forth when you come out I polish you I give you my word I give you what it will take you from this Earth for you to meet me in the air amen because if you don't come out it's just like a man uh uh sister Vanessa son Daniel he s his precious wife and he give the invitation to the wife the wife was in Germany Daniel is in Canada and Daniel told her I love you and the sister says oh Daniel I love you but I will stay in Germany you stay in Canada can that be a marriage and this is what happened to so many of us God is saying come out because indeed have I seen righteousness before me I'm calling you I've given you the invitation to come take my word when you come out then it prove to me you love me it proved to me that you love me when the sister came out it proved to that that he L Daniel because he cannot stay in Germany and Tell Daniel I love you that does not go with God way right God don't want that God want us to be in his presence I am not saying every day every God word we have to have balance sometime things may happen job or you know sickness or things that's why you find out that people are in the message but they weak even sickness then they get frustrated they don't have money they get frustrated the a little bit of headache they get frustrated why because they don't fully come out if you you come out and the word that is preaching in the Pulpit whether it's me whether it's our pastor whether is philli whether it's Desmond timia Christopher whoever the Lord choose to stand here it that word will deliver you amen hallelujah that word will deliver you because let me tell you a brother gave a testimony he he came to church why he was here I I I think that day I Minister and I Minister finished and he was there the Lord told him something bothering him some pain go let brother Kofi pray for you he he he's resisting I don't know he was resisting no Lord no this thought can't be God no no no no no he came out in the sanctuary uh the uh what do you call Lobby H after we go out how do we call that place okay he came down there for some reason I know nothing the Holy Spirit led me to him and I started talking with him just we having Fellowship okay he's still resisting n the Lord spoke to him again like brother kofy pray for you nah we talk talk I says okay I'm going you to says he's going he come out to the parking lot brother philli and I were standing right there then the Holy Spirit arrest him says no you got to let the brother pray for you then he confessed started confessing in front of me Philip is sitting here and the brother even has given the testimony already but I don't want to mention names and we lay our hands on him and we pray for him when he confessed I said brother listen do you believe the holy spirit it's not brother Kofi it's not Phillip it's not anybody it's all about Jesus this gospel is all about Christ if you believe Christ he can use any vsel to speak to you at any time he wants we don't look to faces or color or School degree or no degree or big preacher or small preacher or no preacher all those things or sister the Lord can do whatever he wants but you got to obey the voice I have to obey when he speak to me Noah obey the voice right we read it in his generation God spoke to him he obey all those prophets when God spoke to them the reason why the scripture Moses Abraham Elijah Noah William Braham John the Baptist they all obey the voice of God that's speaking to them and through that they were were able to accomplish what the Lord want them to accomplish if not so they wouldn't be able to do it right that's why the scripture tell us that we are the chosen generation from God before the foundations of this world you came here with a seed of God in you that seed if it is a part of God it cannot rest no matter what happen whether sickness whether poverty whether pain whether you lose your business you you are uneducated or educated or whatever happen all your children even die on you or your wife die on you husband die on you you will still obey the voice of God because it's the seed of God and where God is there is Liberty there is freedom that's where your joy will come from do you know you can go through pain so much that that pain doesn't even bother you because you know why when you have surrendered to the almighty God who has chose you and called you you don't see no poty you don't see no pain but that's why the prophet has told us look away to who Jesus because when you look to him everything become perfect but when you don't look to him you have sorrows and pain that's why in this message a lot have pain pain always dragging their feet they try to drag their feet they ignoring the small the little small voice that is speaking to them right the Small Voice God voice that he has placed in their heart you can't even run from the pastor run from the church your fellow brothers and sisters but that voice will continue to speak to you because God didn't chose you because of Good Neighbor he chose you before the foundations of this world before this building was buil he saw it right so you are not just chosen today recognize who you are because in you there is power when you recog recognize that no matter what happened to you you'll be rejoicing you'll be happy you won't forsake God yes you make mistakes mistakes I tell you brother Braham himself what did he say I backslide Thousand Times Daily if the prophet backslide in his time Thousand Times Daily what about us today right God knows that he he have put his trust in you you are the last baton that have to run with the Baton you you are the last batch that have to run with the Baton the trust is passed on to you amen so don't fail Jesus Christ Noah he accomplished what he was called for okay I'm going to turn and read to my second scripture you'll see why I I I say we should read Colossians 2 chapter 6 no colians c o l o s s i a n x is it chonic is it col Colossians yeah okay sorry colians 2 6 listen 6 verse 9 as ye have therefore receive Christ Jesus the Lord so so work ye in him right he has given you the invitation you have accept the king word when he give you the invitation you said you accepted it now the word is telling you walk ye in him in another way don't play with the word don't joke with God word you surrender so that the word will be fulfilled it's like a man married to a woman why a man married to a woman and planted his seed he want that seed that go to the woman W to bring forth after his kind so that the man could see his image but if the man give the seed to the woman like this SoCal mod womens some of them they don't want to take no man's seed they don't want to carry them SE man's seed they they think man's seed is not good for them but if you and I spiritually speaking have taken Jesus seed we should allow the word to fortify our heart so that the word will bring forth after his kind right okay verse 9 for in him dwell all the fullness of the godhead bodily and 10 and ye are complete in him who which is the head of all principality and power God is all the head of everything right he's the head of everything your eye can see what your eye cannot see he is the head he is the one that gave his life went to the Great grave come out from come out from the grave nobody has done that he's the one that says I am he that was dead but I'm alive forever more he's the one that has given you eternal life so walk ye in him allowed him to do what he says he will do with you if we obey him nothing is too high that the people today we know the whole world is doing what falling apart before when we said the world is falling apart it was we were just looking what brother Braham has spoken and speaking it but now what brother Brown spoke we don't have to read it in books it's plain before us the what the Prophet The Prophet was seeing the thing coming and he was speaking because he knew that you and I will be coming but now we are here looking at what the prophet spoke is playing before us Israel and Hamas and all these wars what do you think is heading towards exactly what the Bible said Isaac and ishma when Sarah told Sarah told Abraham cast that ish out they can live with ISAC that wall is still going on as our pastor saying now that is the wall that is going on and you're going to continue going on nobody can stop it nobody can break it what God has spoke will come to pass whether we like it or not it will come to pass but why these things was going on on is a sign to us what was the last sign God did to Abraham last time I told I said it I repeat it again the last sign was God coming in flesh visit Abraham and told Abraham you're going to have a son s even laugh from that time you go in this Bible I cannot not read it proper but let me say I know the last time God visit Abraham the second thing you can see was what Abraham be to beg when he told him what he was going to do to the sodomites then Abraham be to beg for what the sodomites if there's I think 50 or 40 came right down to what I think five or so he couldn't even find one then he he begin to his nephew lot beg for lot we are seeing the same thing because why brother Abraham is gone B grah is gone as our pastor was saying Sunday Roy Robert is gone the Three Angels is gone and now God is in what in flesh in the bright skin the true bride so God is visiting them are you listening to me God is doing what visiting them it's not in Pages no more it's now in the form of God is now in the form of man whether you like it or not listen I may not able able to speak it properly like my pastor but bear with me is the truth God in flesh in skin walking in the bright form talking and the people think oh Pastor Danny is speaking so I won't come to church brother deson is speaking I don't come to church brother Kofi that bheed short brother when he come here and he he don't know even his Bible proper but he tried to say God has call him and he talking about the Bible this that so I will not even be here whether you like it you don't God has chose it's not my chose God chose he chose listen God chose he chose it's not the will of man we woman beings we want everything proper straight up this way that way that's why the culture and the education has brought us but God is God he does not change God doesn't change okay God know why he chose his children is sometime the men may not even read good his sentence may not be proper in the English or in the French or in the language that that country you have to bring the word but God May hide behind that skin so that those that have an eye to see they can see that this is not the man the man may be meming his words not too good but God is hiding in man that's what you must look for because when when God sometime bring a man straight proper the devil can catch everything but if the man don't know his left and right and the man stand there talking like he don't know what is even himself talking what are you going to say when you get oh this is not service this is improper service this is not the way God have to move and meanwhile you missing God because the foolishness of God is even wiser than men and the wiser things of men is foolish unto the Lord because he does that so that Satan can catch what he's doing Noah God told him to build an ark right rain has never been fall rain has never fall God says Noah Bu The Ark then the people in this generation 120 years this man was preaching how does it sound Noah sound all the scholars the intellectuals the Pharisees in that day or the sagy in that day they thought this man was cuckoo the business people in that day ah this man is cuckoo is talking something that has never happen but that was God Amen doing itory and God in this day in our day is doing the same thing that's why the voice is calling calling calling calling telling us come out come out from your comfort zone come out God is visiting with us he's visiting us in the form of wife4 Ministry from the pastor to the lease he's visiting us and he's saying come out come out come out why because I'm going to judge the sodomites don't forget I'm going to judge them but you whom I have chosen if you don't come out I can't judge them so you need to come out come out come out from your comfort zone you think this is a pain you think what you are going through is a disaster in your life you wait and watch and see what is coming wait and see what is coming upon the a you going to know that you were blessed by God you going to know how God God has blessed you that God used to come to you right in this pulpit and speak and tell you things before those things come to pass because this world is going to be chaos am chaos more chaos is coming more chaos I don't care what anybody tells me because when you look what did you see like our pastor when he was preaching last time says whether Trump come or the woman whether he come it doesn't matter right two of them it doesn't matter who coming there's a disaster on the way coming I said there is a disaster coming Run for Cover the only place you can run to is Jesus Christ the only place the only shelter for you and I is Christ the Lord Christ the lord or chaos where are you running to Noah saw it when God spoke to Noah and told Noah indeed have I seen righteousness so is you I have seen righteousness in you so I have called you you may not be a prophet like Noah but type yourself that voice that spoke to Noah and says Noah indeed have I seen righteousness before me God giv Noah Grace God giving you Grace giving me Grace Lord so don't turn that dis uh that Grace to disgrace because we Humanity when there's going to be an earthquake we don't know with all our scientific socalled our scientific achievement sometime the people still sit there till the the disaster strike and Destroy so many why because woman human beings they don't know when disaster is coming but look at the animals the chicken the dog all those animals in the bush when there's an earthquake before the earthquake will strike they will see that the earthquake is coming then they're running for cover because why they obey God just as Noah obey God you and I right now when we look into the world you don't need somebody to tell you going to be a disaster if you don't believe me look at the news and look at what is happening what do you think Satan is not going sleeping he's alive God is not sleeping God is is in his wife and he will take us from here brothers and sisters let me let me tell you I believe God more than anything I believe God this thing is so real to me if this gospel is not so real to me then let me walk away and go to Sodom and live in Sodom life and die because God is so real whatever God has promised us brothers and sisters let us have confidence in the Lord Noah have confidence in the Lord that's why Noah obey God Amen Noah obey God Noah is a type of a true wife of Christ that is obeying the Lord Jesus Christ for this hour our because if we don't obey him then we are not his wife if you are not obeying the Lord then you are not his wife listen the Bible has even given us so much grace it says the righteous falls seven times he rise up what seven times in otherwise you make a mistake just rise up don't stay in the mod and you go in the Bible it says if the same spirit that rais up Christ dwell in you he shall also do what Quicken your mortal Body by his spirit so you want to tell me spirit of God dwell in you and you fall down and you can't get up then that's not spirit of God you need to repent and come to Christ and baptize in the name of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ that those that are in denominations yes they may be good there's good people out there God is not looking for good people he didn't come for good and and righteous people he came for those that will obey his word don't let them fool you sometime people they can live holy than you and me but that is not the word is asking for the word is asking asking you for obedience is better than sacrifice the word tells you like we that are in good neighbor let me turn to us because judgment start from the house of the Lord right before he hit the street it start with me judgment if I can't line up with the word how I'm going to tell somebody on the street to come here and watch worship God you think he going to work if I can't line up on the word you think if I go lay my hands on somebody on the street they're going to get healed right A lot of people want to see leg stretch if he the leg is straight the arms stretch the cancer gone depression gone money riches everything but simple question God asks you and I don't forsake his house don't forsake the house of the Lord how many of us forsake the house of the Lord if we put it in in pen and and check it by God word not legalistic you think God stand here physically and says I'm how many are going to pass that test okay few let the simple question God is giving us Grace he gave Noah Grace Noah obey 120 years the prophet has left the scene some of us were not even I don't think every one of us were born here but we are here how many years 50 something years now right we shouldn't give up we should be faithful to the word that the prophet preach whether rain or Sunshine the prophet William Brown word would be fulfilled what he has spoken it will come to pass I have faith in what the prophet preach if this is not truth then I don't know any gospel that is in my age that is true that's all I can see if it is not true then I don't know any gospel that is true a man that stand there with grade seven education he tell them what I have preed serpent seed if you think I'm telling lies one of you should hold your Bible and come and stand beside me did they came why didn't they came the angel of the Lord was standing right beside him it was real even when you watch the Deep call to the Deep watch how people came to him telling them their your house number telling I never listen his way of doing things was different than any soall this Evangelical thing that you can see on the TV you can see when even you listen to it from your head to your toe I don't know about you but me I get bombs bombs come over me I feel the bombs I know what the man preaches do say the Lord and I know his message still continue through the message if you eat it it becom sweeter in your mouth but better in your bear my brother my sister sometime is like he taking you to grave but don't don't worry Lazarus went to grave while he walked with Jesus Jesus used to go to Lazarus house and Lazarus went to grave the Lord didn't let him stay in the grave he brought him back alive a type of you if this gospel take you to grave Jesus the message will bring you back it it will bring you back because the message have Resurrection in it so you will be resurrected why do you afraid no dead for you absent from this body present with the Lord Joy you supposed to walk with joy because you have listen you are the best doctor on Earth that the people should seek to do you know that's what God has made you all the doctors they looking for this medicine that medicine this medicine God has placed his word is in you and his word is what eternal life right don't you see can't you see early in the morning you just walk here walk check your house place whether you live in apartment you will see the old people or even the trotting what are they doing they don't want to die they young the ladies you see them walking SP I'm not saying doing uh Sports is not good is good but I'm just saying that way for you to see what the Lord has done for you nobody wanted to die they want them the medicine for dead and the medicine for dead is when you have Christ because Christ is eternal life so you are the doctor on the earth if the they come to you right Jesus has placed his word in you his word when they receive they will have eternal life don't you know you have what the doctors don't have it's eternal life Jesus has given to you so why are you afraid of De when Paul recognized that was he says dead where is your Victory absent from this body and present with the Lord I have eternal life it's not something future or is coming why I'm here I know who I am because that power lay in me that power lay in you if you can only believe no matter what happened to you recognize that and says money no money sickness no sickness I will s the Lord you will see from that time let me tell you I visit Pastor Simon I and him met and when we met he look at me he says brother Kofi you are changing okay I said thank you brother I come to church here bar Tim is watching me Tim just come to me right here on the corner you look at me said brovi you are changing then he said brother is the rapture so close like that I didn't say a word what team that said that says brother you are you are really really changed without even opening my mouth okay who is and the only thing I find myself is before I used to get angry things that bother me I don't lie to you and Pastor Danny will tell you because before he was the head of the deacon deson knows me better I used to angry when you say something and it bothers me but now let me tell you even if you can even ask my children my wife they are the closest one I will speak maybe you said something I'll just say it you can say whatever you want I my mind is it doesn't bother me no more and it's not something I I try to put in on it's like it's gone and my heart Mo mostly I find myself praying from the top every single one of us with this true heart not just going burning the like before praying so oh God B no no no but it come from within me like that and I'm seeing that it's taking place even my children if I see mistake on them my mouth is shut I allow them to go through because the Lord allowed me to go through I can look at myself back what the Lord has done he has done a work on me so I should allowed him to do it on my children if I don't then I'm going to be a hindrance to the Lord because God is the one that is doing it we cannot do it all is asking us we should give us our heart the call has come to us what are we going to do are we going to turn him down are we going going to over him and say Lord yes you are God but I won't let you to my secret room God want to go into our secret room is the heart the heart the Lord wants the True Heart when the true heart is pure then God can use you the way he want to use you he can talk to who he want to talk to even I've noticed witnessing it's not you going to witness it's him and you won't be aware of it sometime and God will drag the person to you it's just like any man any man when they are testy nobody go tell them how to go find water the desire D in their heart God has placed in them pushes them towards water to go drink the god seed who are the wife of Christ they are not just chosen today they were chosen before the foundations of this world so if God ordained you that in here in this earth you are the one that have to call him or her when that his time reach let me tell you when my time reach you ask this thism didn't call me that day I call him I was pushing I want to come to church because the taste the desire God God even reveal himself to me why I didn't know what church to go to but he begin to push every time I says oh no my heart be that the seed begin to push I couldn't hold no more I have to call him said brother I want to come and see the church and so is it how God going to bring the people if we surrender and obey God voice God will do the job the tooth is already in US is already God has raised the five4 ministry from the pastor to every single one that stand here don't take it for granted listen you may think it's easy for us it's not this gospel brother BR brought that he keep on open and open Jesus is here open the word if your eye is open let me tell you this is the place last place you want to stand and Minister you're not taking that for joke because you know anytime you make one mistake you thinking about it you can't even see why Lord have I done something wrong did I say something against my brother did I say something against my S you wanted to
