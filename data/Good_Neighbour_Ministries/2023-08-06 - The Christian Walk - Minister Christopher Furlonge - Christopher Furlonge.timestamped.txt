[22:59] from Genesis 17 to when those that you

[23:06] from Genesis 17 and 1 and the other
[23:09] scripture reading is from Hebrews 11
[23:13] to 13.

[23:31] we're going to chop down the enemy and
[23:34] nothing is going to hinder us
[23:36] amen hallelujah
[23:38] reading Genesis 17 and 1. and when
[23:42] Abraham Abraham was 90 years older nine
[23:48] the Lord appeared to Abraham and said
[23:52] unto him
[23:54] I am the almighty God
[23:59] walk before me
[24:02] and be thou perfect
[24:06] hallelujah our next scripture reading
[24:09] we'd like you to turn to Hebrews 11.
[24:14] verse 8 revealing from 8 to 13 amen
[24:20] as we have read the Lord said to Abraham
[24:23] walk before me and be thou perfect
[24:29] did Abraham make mistakes
[24:33] man
[24:34] yes he did but when we look at
[24:38] the next scripture readings Hebrews 11 8
[24:42] by faith
[24:45] which is the key
[24:46] by faith
[24:48] Abraham when he was called to go out
[24:53] into a place which he should after
[24:57] receive for an inheritance
[25:01] Hallelujah obeyed
[25:04] and he went out not knowing whether he
[25:08] went
[25:11] by faith he sojourned in the land of
[25:14] promise
[25:16] as in a strange country
[25:19] dwelling in Tabernacles which Isaac and
[25:23] Jacob and their heirs with him of the
[25:26] same promise
[25:28] for he looked for a city which had
[25:31] foundations
[25:34] whose Builder and maker is God
[25:38] and through faith also Sarah
[25:43] herself receives strength to conceive
[25:46] seed
[25:48] and was delivered of a child when she
[25:51] was past age because
[25:53] she judged him who had promised
[26:00] I just want to take my time every single
[26:03] little phrase could just be expanded so
[26:07] much
[26:08] amen and I can go to so many areas
[26:13] roads that can you know different
[26:16] challenges you can take and the world is
[26:18] just ex expanded
[26:21] just like the Roman Candle you just hit
[26:23] one spot and it just opens up opens up
[26:25] and opens up Hallelujah
[26:29] so she judged him faithful Who had who
[26:34] had made the promise man therefore
[26:37] sprung there even one and him as good as
[26:40] dead so many as the stars of the sky in
[26:44] multitude and as the sand which is by
[26:47] the seashore in Europe innumerable
[26:50] these all died in faith not having
[26:54] received the promise but having seen
[26:57] them afar off and were persuaded of them
[27:01] and embraced them and confess that they
[27:05] were strangers and pilgrims on the Earth
[27:09] Hallelujah let us all pray
[27:13] over kind God eternal
[27:16] Heavenly Father
[27:18] you are the resurrected one
[27:21] the one who died for us and rose again
[27:25] and we come before your throne of grace
[27:27] this morning to give you thanks that we
[27:29] can once more assemble ourselves
[27:32] together Lord

[28:21] my little talk a little
[28:24] subject today is the Christian walk
[28:29] Hallelujah
[28:31] and that walk is not just
[28:35] when you come to church

[28:43] fellowshipping or something like but
[28:45] every day every moment walk
[28:49] Hallelujah
[28:51] and that Christian walk is our walk from

[28:59] from Genesis to Revelations
[29:01] Hallelujah
[29:03] thank you Lord Jesus
[29:05] now as we have read
[29:08] God called Abraham to walk before him
[29:15] Hallelujah
[29:17] did God may call you today
[29:22] and he said to Abraham be thou perfect
[29:26] because God was looking at the German
[29:30] seat that was inside Abraham
[29:34] he's not looking at the outward part
[29:36] he was looking at the part of himself
[29:39] God departed God placed himself in
[29:43] Abraham
[29:44] amen that that part was perfect
[29:48] amen Abraham didn't know that them even
[29:52] though he made mistakes
[29:54] Hallelujah and just as so as you and I
[29:57] we make mistakes along this journey
[30:02] but if the Lord said to us that to be
[30:06] thou perfect as our heavenly father is
[30:10] perfect
[30:11] amen so you know what he's saying to you
[30:13] that there's Perfection that is lying
[30:16] with inside of you
[30:19] man Hallelujah
[30:22] that that has the the German size uh to
[30:26] grow amen and show fruits of perfection
[30:30] man Hallelujah so you might say you're

[30:36] and all these kinds of things that
[30:39] confronts your life and you slip your
[30:42] slide your foot but there is a Jones sea
[30:45] that is lying in you today that is
[30:48] perfect

[31:03] Faith amen hallelujah praise God

[31:12] amen
[31:14] he was called into a place
[31:19] amen
[31:21] that
[31:22] he should receive as an inheritance

[31:33] didn't pass there before
[31:36] amen hallelujah
[31:38] amen
[31:40] and he went out he did not know where he
[31:43] was going
[31:45] amen do you know where you are going
[31:48] today
[31:50] man God called you
[31:53] to be
[31:55] a Christian
[31:57] and a question is to be Christ's like
[32:01] when they ask you out there are you uh
[32:03] what church you will go to
[32:05] you say well I belong to a
[32:08] non-denominational Christian Church they
[32:11] say well is it Pentecostal is it Baptist
[32:14] no it's a Christian Church
[32:17] because if you go to a Pentecostal
[32:21] church and you receive a Pentecostal
[32:22] teaching you will produce Pentecostal
[32:25] fruits
[32:27] amen but if you go to a Christian pure
[32:31] unadulterated word of God where is
[32:34] thought you will bring forth Christ
[32:38] oh my God praise the Lord hallelujah
[32:42] praise God
[32:44] you see by faith he said John in the
[32:47] land of promise as in a strange country
[32:50] dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and
[32:54] Jacob even though
[32:57] the seed that God that promised Abraham
[33:00] wasn't manifested yet yet in Abraham
[33:04] knew that there was a a a people
[33:10] that was coming forth amen hallelujah
[33:14] that was dwelling within him that's how
[33:17] he could have believed God so when God
[33:19] makes a promise to you and I
[33:23] you see once you read from the scripture
[33:27] by faith Sarah amen hallelujah because
[33:31] she judged him faithful not Abraham who
[33:34] made the promise not the priest that
[33:36] made the promise not the church that
[33:38] made the promise but almighty God gave
[33:42] her that promise amen hallelujah and
[33:45] almighty God who gave you a promise
[33:49] today what is that promise that you
[33:51] received today
[33:53] Hallelujah I don't want to jump ahead on
[33:55] my time ahead of what I would like to
[33:58] bring forth to you today but I know you
[34:00] know it's going to be coming
[34:03] Hallelujah
[34:05] thank you Lord Jesus
[34:08] praise God
[34:09] so when we look here
[34:12] first I'd like to take Abraham
[34:15] Abraham forsook all
[34:20] amen
[34:23] if we suck his own land
[34:26] if your circus property he owned
[34:29] I want you to be thinking
[34:31] forsook everything
[34:33] is forsoka's family
[34:35] if for circus friends if we suck all
[34:39] them other relationships he had out
[34:41] there
[34:42] dropped it all out and it followed God
[34:47] but it did not fully Obed
[34:50] I want to show you why
[34:52] amen because this Christian walk
[34:56] calls for Allah a work of total
[34:59] separation
[35:02] and separation from unbelief
[35:06] amen the Lord said do not unequally yoke
[35:09] yourself
[35:10] amen and what he is talking about it's
[35:13] not just it's it's be it's not just
[35:17] talking about your friends and your
[35:19] family and everything like that and but
[35:22] on belief
[35:25] amen which is the number one thing amen
[35:27] hallelujah
[35:30] praise God
[35:31] you see not for one moment
[35:34] amen Hallelujah
[35:37] God will forget you
[35:40] when you forsake all and follow him
[35:43] follow him
[35:45] when the disciples were called
[35:48] amen when they were called Peter James
[35:51] and John they left their Nets behind
[35:53] they left all their professions behind
[35:55] they left everything behind and they
[35:57] followed Jesus
[35:59] amen hallelujah
[36:01] and you know one day
[36:07] Lord you know I forsake all what
[36:11] would you give me what is in return you
[36:14] think Peter was canal

[36:20] this stat and the other and I followed
[36:22] you what it isn't for me
[36:24] amen

[36:30] of you'll get salvation you get eternal
[36:32] life is not enough
[36:34] you want more than that
[36:37] but you know something God is a God that
[36:40] doesn't forget your sacrifice
[36:43] it doesn't forget what to do for him
[36:46] man hallelujah hallelujah amen and he
[36:50] pays big dividends
[36:53] he plays with big interests
[36:55] Hallelujah he said you're going to have
[36:58] lands and houses and everything and this
[37:01] world and even if they want to come
[37:04] but what did he do to Abraham see God
[37:07] promised Abraham a land
[37:09] right the land of King he said look to
[37:12] the East look to the West look to the
[37:13] North and South all this I have given to
[37:16] thee
[37:17] but you know deep down in Abraham when
[37:19] you go all got that you know that didn't
[37:21] satisfy that what was inside of him
[37:24] he was looking
[37:26] for a city
[37:28] whose Builder and maker was God and he
[37:32] count it as he being a stranger dwelling

[54:13] world it shows that you are off the wall
[54:17] and God's love is not in you so
[54:20] something else is driving you but not
[54:22] the love of God
