deliverance and this is where it all just comes together for us every week lord when we can assemble ourselves in your presence knowing that you have an instrument this morning a vessel that you will

praise anoint our pastor may the fire proceed from his mouth burn out every demon power that would try to hinder your people this morning in the name of jesus christ heal the sick and raise the dead open the blinded eyes father grant it we pray may the word for this day in this hour come in jesus name amen and amen amen [Music] you believe the true report hallelujah we're living in the presence of the king this morning hallelujah i believe [Music] [Applause] me [Music] i am oh [Music] is is [Music] [Applause] is [Music] oh is uh i am [Applause] uh is is is i am [Music] hallelujah sister martial has a testimony for us this morning [Music] hallelujah god bless you all saints of the living god it's wonderful always so wonderful to be in the house of the lord amen and um i have two things that i'd like to share today and the first part is i have to say that if it was of myself i would not be standing here right now i you know i'm literally being convicted by the holy spirit to share what i'm about to share and um you know one i'm still being tested i haven't received the money yet as brother christopher would say in order to get them test the money you have to have the test to get the money right but the lord wants me to share my experience and i don't know who will bless i pray to be a blessing to someone and then glory to god for the second one the victory's already won and we can rejoice together but before i do there's a scripture that the lord gave me and i just want to share it with you as well it's from psalm 86 5. it says oh lord you are so good so ready to forgive so full of unfailing love for all who ask for your help amen and i'm asking for his help today once more because for some time i've been struggling with a hearing loss in my right ear and i've been praying just on my own that you know as we just we praying we believe but there wasn't that desperation and then one morning you know in prayer and everything and as i listen to the word and of course brother branham and every time you minister for someone i'm listening and praying that i'll receive my blessing too i receive my healing too and then the thought came to me why don't you ask pastor simon to pray for you so about two wednesday nights ago i was able to share with pastor and express to him that the spirit of the lord asked me to you know let him pray and he was you know ready to receive and we spoke and he said yes sister we'll keep it in our heart but exactly two sundays ago not last week the week before as he was praying just in the middle of the word coming forth and if you listen back on the tape you'll catch it but he just spoke out and he said death spirit i drive you out in jesus name and in that moment i received it for myself and i said thank you lord jesus and i could hear my ear ringing and it's like a pop and it's like oh lord please god i'm like lord you're working on me you're working on me and when i realized when i got home my ear was so much better i could close my left ear and i could hear well in from my right ear and i've been telling the children that children were speaking to me and i could just hear by closing my left ear so i was praising the lord rejoicing and i shared the testimony with my dear sisters on our thursday night small group and then i shared the testimony again on a friday night prayer meeting which i'll encourage you all if you are ever able please the prayer meetings are such a blessing so please try and join but that being said i shared the testimony last friday so then now after the prayer meeting around 10 o'clock in the late in the night i noticed my hearing was off again i wasn't hearing as clearly as before and i realized and i'm like satan you're a liar because i've been witnessing and testifying and speaking that the lord's delivered me now these devils want to come back and come back even worse and then this is where i'm healing for your help as well to keep praying for me because my hearing since then i've continued to pray i've shared with the believers and it's gotten better but it's still not fully delivered so i'm trusting god and i'm sure in this that you could pray for me also because i know and i stand on the word of god that by his stripes i'm already healed and i say thank you lord jesus for healing me right and i stand and i think also the lord has been brought bringing it to my heart that like we think of brother brandon i mean remember he had a stigmatism in his eye and then eventually he had to wear such big glasses but then eventually laura gave him perfect vision and i thought about also the fact that he had to speak about joseph being born before he was born and you know sarah came along of course and then people were making fun of him and saying oh you meant josephine but he was like no joseph will come so the lord is also convicted in my heart that sometimes we have to speak it abraham had to speak it before isaac came so i'm speaking it now that by the name of the lord jesus christ i'm healed my right ear is perfectly healed i will hear in higher octaves as our brother said i will hear and all your octaves as our pastor spoke and i thank the lord jesus for healing me amen praise god praise god now brother just one more one more and i won't be long but the other one is that i don't know if you all experienced an early morning phone call from abroad and i've had that and it was a report of death you're woken up out of your bed you're being told someone died well this time just last month i got an early morning phone call from my mom my uncle in jamaica has been rushed to the hospital well thank god the lord just gave me a spirit of peace and i just said mom we're gonna pray and i went into prayer by bomb and we prayed and we prayed i later found out why he had to go to hospital his gallbladder was detached and he was literally on deathbed but the grace of god we prayed and we prayed they did surgery on him it was very testing it was very difficult but glory to god my uncle uncle's recovering he is well and the lord jesus has delivered him from the brink of death and we thank god for his healing power amen praise [Applause] god amen let's uh bow our hearts before the lord heavenly father lord jesus once again it is time to take up the offering lord you commanded us lord to to give back to you and you only ask for a tenth lord but lord jesus we all you also said that give and it shall be given unto you good measure pressed down and shaken together so we ask you lord to accept the offering today lord god let it be glorious to you in jesus your wonderful name amen [Music] i love you lord for your goodness [Music] i was [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] i love your voice [Music]

said because you have chosen the hardest way a great portion of heaven awaits you thank [Applause] god yes he is [Music] is out of nowhere [Music] foreign oh is yes is [Music] hallelujah amen he

continue to bless her as she faces our future with the lord within her life it's a difference when you have the lord within your life let me thank you for being here may the lord bless you be here brother god bless every one of you that has come through the toils and dangers of the traffic yes yeah oh come do that for me please i thought i had it there you go thank you very much yes but you are

asking for that you guys come ahead and let's have a wonderful time that's what we're here for praise the lord amen i know our pews are set the old-fashioned way doesn't have a beautiful curvature and you know we don't have an orchestra and stuff like that but i don't want you to feel like you're in school oh we are here to praise god and worship his holy and gracious wonderful name and we want to sing that song together praise god hallelujah when the redeemed we are thinking of the rapture amen praise god [Music] of the hallelujah [Music] oh [Applause] is [Music] [Applause] oh render it in [Applause] [Music] let us read our scripture for this day leviticus 25 verses 8 to 10. leviticus 25 we can put that up there to be great eight to ten praise the lord i'm reading okay it's up there and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years onto thee seven times seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years thou shalt cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh in the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and ye shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man onto his possession and you shall return every man unto his family and you amen praise the lord god bless you uh real good hallelujah god bless his word gracious heavenly father once again gathered together in your presence we ask and invite your the blanket of your spirit your presence father your person to be here with us while we talk about these things may you as you did on the road to ms i ask you to draw near we might be comforted knowing that we are not speaking words into the air but that we serve a living god that he lives and moves and walks with us father that we are not caught up in some mythical thing but lord we have come into contact with the unfailing reality of the living god walking him up and down among the candlesticks among his people who will shine their lights into every little dark corner to thee be all the praise the honor and the glory bless us quickness lift us up today prepare us for the journey for we ask it in jesus name amen and amen the lord bless you please be seated we just sang that wonderful song when the redeemed are gathering in praise the lord and we always sing it that way when the redeemed are gathering in wash like the snow but i want to present it this morning not when the redeemed are gathering in i want to say they redeemed our gathering in right now the redeemed are gathering in they're being gathered by the word of god they're being gathered by the same player of fire that gathered the children of israel in the land of goshen before they took their journey but we are not gathering in goshen we're gathering in god we're gathering in his word we're gathering in his presence before the departure to go to glory into his divine presence that is why we are here this morning we are not just a people that are just frivolously traditionally attending church but we are here because something has movement in our hearts i don't know about you but there's something moving within my heart that's real brother sister it's not something that we're making up we're not here to try to persuade or convince you if you are an elected predestinated son or daughter of god then you will have caught the same thing i caught you would have received what i received and together we are what in jesus christ hallelujah [Applause] i want you to know this brother branham's constant emphasis emphasis which i noticed and when the slaves in that year of jubilee when him and his family his kids his wife and all of them wanting to return return back to their homeland where they come from is that your desires here today we know we come from god and we're going back to god amen we come from his mind amen he spoke the word we come through mother and father that we could be physically expressed and then here we are upon the face of the earth trapped in a human body with which we can live and make ourselves manifest the people but now the word has come and he has revealed himself to us telling us you are not born to be creatures of time amen you come from eternity you're going back to eternity you come from god you're going back to god because you are after his kind is that right you come after his kind exactly you don't have to work yourself up into a christianity you don't have to work yourself up into a religious frenzy you don't have to prove that you're more spiritual than the other believer no because you are who you are like paul said i am what i am that's who i am take me as i am because that's that's just what i am uh and i'm being myself i'm not trying to be like brother brother i'm not trying to copy off of this person or that person or the other we don't have any message regimentation or message costume or uh what's the word i want uniform that we all must wear but we are free in jesus christ and we are now on our journey of return where we come from and we are in this stage now that man wants to return because that man heard the trumpet hallelujah have you heard the trumpet of this hour have you heard the trumpet angel sounding out the on the certain sound of the gospel of jesus christ to your heart to my heart and we are certain that we heard now we can drop our whole amen the form of christianity that you were living drop your works stop your striving and your fighting stop all of that drop whatever you were doing look up into that denominational master's face he says task master i bring it up to date in our modern times and he says you can't hit me anymore you can't excommunicate me anymore thank god hallelujah you can't be excommunicated from this because you are born into christ one in him one with his body eternal as he is eternal because you are in his mind you are not a creation amen satan tried to fool you by putting you into a body that he create not create but procreated ceo is a copycat god create he procreate and so on but the point is he's we are not you i've never seen you i've seen your body that you're expressing yourself through but the real you that part didn't come from here they're looking for alien beings from outer space paul paul already told them we are aliens and strangers we are pilgrims we just passing through this land we're going back to god where we come from redeem that gathering in right now and the magnet is the word of god that's gathering the redeemed wherever they are amen yes that man can now go free and walk right home from right there amen you see that that jubilee is when he heard that sound when you heard a certain sound and a message hallelujah look i've been in the message for from so many years many years but then there's a point in the message oh you know you're thinking i mean long in the message i've been in 20 years 30 years but then i heard a certain sound coming out of that message and when i heard that sound it's the same message but i heard a certain sound coming out of it that caught my heart in the air amen i tell you brother sister right away that the seventh thunders was not the thundering to me anymore the seven thunders become a voice began to speak begin to reveal begin to open up the word of god and the bible become a new bible not just to the prophet but to every one of us you open the word the bible you open the message of the prophet and it strikes your soul amen the deep crawls to the deep and the deep has to respond because my father and i are one one in christ one together hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord my topic as i said is the redeemed are gathering in did you get that amen god has dealt with us exactly the same amount of time as he has dealt with the jews he gave abraham the promise until the time of the rejecting of the messiah now he's talking about that repeating again here now amen when they reject the word for this hour the time since the promise or the word was given to when they reject that word amen hallelujah now watch close don't miss it you see when that happens it will be a jubilee at that time that will be the growing up but this time of a gentile bride not not israel coming out but a gentile bride going up into the presence of almighty god hallelujah amen and the return of christ when they go out of bondage see from the world they've gathered there in israel for that day amen see where we're at we don't know what exact time it may happen but we are now standing at the end do you believe it any day now jesus is coming it may be at mourn when the day is breaking hallelujah i don't know when but any moment now we can be gone from here amen praise god oh praise god just stop to think that a man in that jubilee all that man has to do is to stop whatever he is doing and come back return to his inheritance amen so those of you you're in the building but i'm being heard and seen on the internet no matter what you're doing whether you're a believer you're unbeliever you're a message believer a backslidden believer a believer that's faulty in certain parts of your life weak or something the prophet said you have the right of return hallelujah you have a right to come back to your inheritance back to the fullness of the word of god hallelujah oh blessed be his name amen stop whatever you're doing and go right back praise god you see did you believe meant that god has provided a way of grace for every individual to return back to their rightful inheritance no matter what they've done where they're being whatever took place god is giving you the right to return back amen back to your inheritance praise the lord hallelujah i was talking with some believers and they were saying yes you know i i was told that um any jew that wants to go to the back to the land of israel doesn't matter if they're poor they have no money if they've never been there doesn't matter if they're rich if they're this or that the nation of israel already has a stated policy any jew anywhere in the world that wants to return to israel can get on one of their planes and they will take them back to israel free of charge free of charge they don't have to pay one penny but they'll be taken back to israel and i just thought about that and said well praise god we have got what we have without money or without christ and be on our way back to the glorious presence of the living god hallelujah because our way is already paid not with the corruptible things like silver and gold but with the precious priceless blood of jesus christ hallelujah amen praise god what a picture that paints for us here tonight or today i'm quoting the scripture here but we are in day now so i'm saying today of the church speaking of the church in these last days you see man can do and when you see what man can do then look again at what god can do right now the jubilee was god's way of expressing his grace to his people by restoring or bringing them back to their rightful positions in this last day you see back there is returning israel back to the land and you know the land was divided up by joshua type of the holy spirit and each tribe had their peace of the land you know i've been up at the gates of dan where they were protecting that border and the springs and it was the fountain of the fountains that provide the waters for the jordan and they're protecting it to this day up there the tribe of dan and their descendants are still protecting it there oh my and the land is divided up where each tribe knows their position of where they're supposed to be according to what joshua had laid out but what the prophet is talking about that's the jews but they're going back to literal israel but we as gentile bride we are returning back into the glorious presence of the living god and before the journey you are being placed into your rightful spiritual position where god wants you to be in other words you don't have to go around thinking about it you don't have to have teaching and sermons about it or finding your position now god knows your position and he's going to place you in that position you don't need to worry about it just function just live just walk and the spirit of god will lead you right where you're supposed to be you're going to be in your position by his will not by your taking lessons of how to be in your position not by having a bible study about to be in your position by the spirit of god revealing to you he wants you to be a housewife be a house spice and give god with glory you want you to be a doctor be a doctor and give god the glory you want to be a a preacher but praise god what i'm saying is whether that person comes in at midday morning or they come in the evening time no matter what time of day or whatever he said what is it to you i want to give everybody the same pay he was typing that he's going to give everybody salvation amen doesn't matter of course rewards at the judgment seat of christ rewards of one person maybe more than the other is your rewards with the works and the things you might have done in giving glory to god for saving your soul hallelujah amen oh praise god now the sounding of that trip yeah amen it's so important that we hear the sounding of the trumpet do you sir because that means return it means return or return or disperse to your own or if you sold out your inheritance that you are given he repeats again if you even sold that out i am crying out to you saying return back hallelujah wherever you are return because the redeemed are gathering in wash like the snow and free from all sin how we will shout how we will save when the redeemed are gathering in oh praise god whatever you might have done done these things what i am saying to you all i say again oh return back if you went out there join yourself up with some quote and then keep yourself away from fellowship with your other brethren i'm telling you leave that thing behind because what's going on now this is the jubilee oh return return for this is the time of jubilee don't let this pass from you remember i'm saying it don't let it pass but return amen if you're sold out if you went out even into the world out there if you went out there and you ascend you know that once you had that experience but yet you went out you sold out joined up where you can't fellowship with the rest of them anymore you've done all these things but i am here to tell you i don't care what you've done can you say man can you say amen [Applause] [Music] you know all these things are the message where people used to turn up their faces uh if a brother or sister made a mistake amen they've done something wrong in the world you you see you've got to come to a place to recognize you don't agree with what they might have done maybe it's wrong that's wrong right but when it comes to the end of the day it's not for you to stay sitting on the earth here and tell them what you did is wrong and you're this that's not your business your business to pray for them god will do all of that when we come to the end of the way but while we are here we are to express the spirit and stature of jesus christ all the loving kindness broadly kindness mercy grace truth all these things should be flowing out like a ever living something out of your life blessing others enriching the lives of others a man seated and planted by the rivers of living waters hallelujah and bearing fruit sweet fruit for his coming glory amen that the presence and power of god might flow through your life amen hallelujah amen oh yes i'm telling you if you're a son if you're a daughter you have a right to return back right now because it's jubilee time hallelujah if you went out there got yourself settled back into some wall is meaning some belief some some philosophy some denomination you you walled yourself off in that put your name down then got yourself anchored and allowed them to chickenize you i'm quoting brother branham i'm not making that up all right but you they give you so many bible studies and so many this and that and the other they chicken eyes you you lose your talents of an eagle you'll lose all the beak of an eagle that wants raw meat hey man hallelujah you don't want all the nice polished up dishes placed before you nice beautiful portions and you don't realize what is the high price you're paying in your life oh god have mercy he said come back to regular come back to sitting down and eating a nice bowl of soup with a piece of bread praise god and that don't look like gourmet to you but my goodness if you're really hungry for god the plain simple word of god revealed to you that's god's gourmet to your soul i'll tell you you got chicken eyes amen oh my i want you to say uh that i'll walk out of that amen i guess it was all right but i heard this amen oh my conviction you do not and cannot sleep off the word of god hallelujah what is talking about once you've caught the revelation of this last prophet's message you can't shake it off you can't sleep it off you can't take it off like you take off a jacket and go out there you're fooling yourself return all dispersed to your own oh the crying of the spirit of christ amen crying out to every heart every life every soul amen o praise god you can't sleep off the word of god neither can you shake off the word of god because you're an eagle to begin with and you know you caught something nowhere else nobody else could give you that but jesus christ himself amen hallelujah and that's the call of this day i'm giving to you return brother return back you are not chickens your eagles to begin with return back sirs this is all from the message called the return and jubilee return and jubilee 1962 back then god pulled his churches out of them denominations hallelujah now god pulls the remnant out of that amen praise the lord that's the jubilee now remember god took israel a nation from out of a nation and then joshua goes and takes the rest two million hours left over into the promised land and i'm saying we are right at that place now he's saying look we already come out of the denominations and now it's jubilee time going home time returning time crossing the jordan back to the land amen where you come from hallelujah glory to god forgive me if i get so excited praise the lord because i'm excited because of what i'm seeing here in the word of god and if you're a son or a daughter of god and you're in the same spirit hallelujah all i'm doing is preaching the word and waving the wave sheath in front of you so that something will catch your heart grip your heart and you will begin to see amen i praise god hallelujah amen so he pulled the remnant out now and this is the jubilee he's calling again not the call back there but he says now he's calling again or return or return it's jubilee time until today he's here again and he's trying to do it again praise god to give another call nations are breaking how many knows that let's sing that i like i love some of those old songs nations are breaking and israel's awakening signs prophets foretold gentile disnumber with horrors and comer return or disperse to your own for the day of redemption is near so very near men's hearts failing for fear be filled with god's spirit your lamps trimmed and played your redemption [Music] amen hallelujah oh don't you hear it what is he talking about he says return return the holy spirit is crying return i can think of jesus looking over jerusalem and tears began to drip down his cheeks because he loved it but they had rejected him but those who were his own return or dispersed to your own the same spirit of christ hallelujah if a man's filled with a spirit he can look out over the church and see people that ought to be shining with the lights and the glorious power and presence of the living god the holy spirit moving upon them may their hearts be filled with tears of regret what have we done oh my disgraceful bunch amen people go out smoke drink marry three or four times women cutting off their ear paints using shorts wearing moral clothes everything else call themselves pentecostal sisters i have to say call themselves message sisters oh that won't happen in the message that's what you think but my friends the message is not what it used to be when you go far back as i've been and see how trim and how it was tight how our believers were were kept in line with the word of god now everything's got loose it seems like nothing is sacred anymore and people think they can just do whatever they feel like doing and because uh god doesn't want the pastor to be a hoarder of goats he's supposed to be a shepherd is that right and that means that the the shepherd doesn't drive sheep the the goat herd have to drive the goats but the shepherds will drive sheeps the sheep follow him praise the lord so really this is something we need to come back to the word of god right in this message some people are going and saying oh the prophet were preached imagine the war so that you know back in the bible it was uh one one uh dear male dear and uh a thousand uh um female that was one this and so many of that therefore i can marry four wives leave their wife marry somebody else this might not apply to you you may not need it but there may be somebody out there in the digital universe that needs what i'm saying here so while i am preaching you pray amen that god will send the arrows straight to that heart hallelujah and use it for his glory and for his honor that's graceful women of the message wearing their shorts wearing their their bikinis and stuff like that praise the lord hallelujah amen and call themselves pentecostal sisters praise the lord glory to god i'm not going to go off and preach on that so don't get nervous and quiet on me i'm i'm staying on topic here praise the lord you know i won't go off and explain whether circumstances there are conditions where this might be allowed that might be allowed that that is not for me to do that's individually you have to deal with that with the holy spirit now hallelujah amen praise god all people return return oh praise god we are now standing on the threshold where decisions have to be made hallelujah are you going to go the rest of the journey amen are you going to i'll go with him through temptation i'll go with him and then you say all the way can you say that you're going to go with him all the way a lot of people sign that song but what they meant i was going to go with him part of the way i go with him when things get a little hard i'll go with him until i can't take it any longer i'll go with him this brother upset me that sister upset me that what they got to do with your individual salvation and walk with god don't try going to god and blaming somebody else or some circumstance or something like that you're chaining up yourself like the devil was chained by a chain of circumstances don't allow that to happen amen praise god hallelujah amen you see god knows the way and he reveals to the heart of man hallelujah in the proper way but it's meant so that men may see this and return and the only way they can return is to come to the truth of the world amen it's the truth of the world that brings around this gathering in praise god hallelujah oh my do i was out on lake i can't pronounce that too much but uh he said there was such a great gathering of ducks i have never seen so many of them gathering together in my life and my indian friend bert said what do you make of that billy and i said well they're beginning to swarm like that because they're getting ready to go south hallelujah praise the lord rather and and listen but i said some kind of a special instinct that god put in the animal life to know when to move and god is letting them make ready to get ready to move amen praise god hallelujah because what their flying time had come i want to say here our rapture time has come [Music] is that right praise god do you notice them birds robins what is happening they're getting ready they know nothing but winter is beginning to settle in tribulation the tribulation is coming amen when he that hinders will not be here to hinder anymore will be taken out of the way then shall the man of sin be revealed so winter is coming amen praise god all these things are coming and even the deer are getting ready amen oh my that's the way it is with all that quacking and carrying on or like only ducks can do carrying on like that what do you think they're talking about billy now he's talking about ducks talking to one another i said well all they know is that they're having a real time of fellowship before their great flight hallelujah brother sisters let's have a great time of fellowship before our great life hallelujah a great time of fellowship before our great flight hallelujah ducks and geese there's never found a better way for them to find to go south but to come together and begin to swarm with each other first hallelujah talking about the message now the message came forth then it broke up into all kind of groups this one don't believe that this one believes that the other one believe the other and they get into argumentations they get into debate strife and everything else praise god hallelujah but then when you start to really catch the revelation those things even if they continue talking about that it fades away in front of you hallelujah god bless you in such a way now you can deal with anything it doesn't matter what it is praise the name of the lord so there is no better way than for them to swarm first you see you they all get together they'll come themselves because there's an instinct in them drawing them together and they get together on swarm just before they fly out of here oh my yes sir why it is revival time a sentence revival time do you believe it it's revival time it's jubilee time it's rapture time it's the harvest time it's going home in the presence of the living god hallelujah what is it they all get together and they begin to chatter you never heard such chattering and fellowshipping in all your life than to hear them geese get together or them ducks i never heard such and there is no better way for them to do it than that way swarming together first do you get a blueprint there you think the prophet is giving us a blueprint there praise god and remember ducks will never change no matter what age they're in ducks will always be ducks they will swarm each year whatever year that is he's talking about the church ages and so on like that that they swarm you say oh they used to do that back then no he's telling you this is your time now this is the time for the rapture time now it's a uniting time now it's a time for the bride of christ to swarm together under their inspiration instinct and revelation of the world we are not here to bring him down by beating down him with music we are not here with all kinds of programs to bring him on the scene we're not here with food because some people are attracted by food so we always want to be feeding people so they're attracted by the food and they want to come for the food no no no no the real food we want to come for is the word of god the food we want to come for is the bread of life something that will feed your soul amen praise god hallelujah amen and that's the reason they swarm because god knows that and he sends his word at that season amen he sends it so that that word can be made manifested hallelujah you see that's what the swarm is about they clocked the word and the swarming is them manifesting that word each one manifests in the word that's what happened in the upper room they caught the revelation and they were swarming together 120 of them shouting and praising god and giving glory to his mighty name and when they are like that you see i don't care what or how many other things they've seen and whatever else they go on but when they see that word that god really promised being vindicated there is nothing going to stop them at that time nothing will stop them who's going to stop you brother brother bill nothing's going to stop you brother daddy nothing's going to stop any of us nothing is going to stop brother tim beers hallelujah nothing going to stop any of us hallelujah wherever we are the same holy spirit comes upon us and nothing will stop us glory to hallelujah here not long ago that's out of god's provided way for this day this day notice the emphasis this day god's provided way out of here into the rapture for this day now here not long ago a farmer had a cornfield you know he had a church and the crows kept coming by trying to eat up his corn so he caught one of them and tied them by its foot and that all crow hobbled all around and jumped hobbled jumped hubble jumped but he couldn't get away because he was tied up but yet he was starving in there starving to death he couldn't fly or jump up all the crows will come and says johnny let's go south he said i can't i'm tied up i can't go south uh and so look poor johnny crow and there came a good man who caught that old fellow petted him patted him took that latch off his foot and turned him loose and said there you go oh boy you're free now you're free to go he walked away but the old crow kept walking in the same circle hallelujah that he walked before he walked in the same circle he was untied but you see he didn't know he was untied he was still thinking he was tied up the other crows came by and said come on johnny let's go south it's coming winter he said i can't i'm still tired i'm still tired and that's the way it is with men and women today see they don't know their position in jesus christ the devil might have tied you up yes he might have tied you up and some of you may be here today with different things and that will tie you up tie you up in that way physically i'm talking about maybe spiritually you have to know it maybe he tied you up with with uh tuberculosis maybe he tied you up with cancer he's trying to obstruct your usability uh as a servant and daughter of the living god he's trying to obstruct he's trying to undermine everything else he's trying to do that but see praise god forevermore he tried to tie you with circumstances of sickness tried to tie you with circumstances of not having enough money now i believe christians have a right to prosper amen praise god and one day maybe i'll get back to brother branham's preaching on why christians should prosper of course he talks about uh christians some are going to be poor some are going to be this way some are going to be that way talk about the pride an arrogance that comes with too much wealth but his way of bringing it i'll talk about that another time but here he says here the devil may have tied you up amen you may be tied up with any other thing praise god you know you could be in the service here today and the sermon is being preached and you're worrying about your rent your mortgage you see those are the ways he ties you up because your mind is distracted off of the word and on to something else that you legitimately ought to be concerned about you know and but he knows when he creates that condition and that state of worry many conditions that creates that situation where you're thinking about this or that you can't pay attention you can't receive the word of god because you're blocked your own blessing amen oh my christ the good man has already set you free praise god and you and i can now rise in the power of the holy ghost praise the lord look i'm going to just uh kind of shorten this message here today i can't preach all of this here to you praise the lord i'm not paul so i'm not going to keep you until midnight amen praise the lord hallelujah remember during the time of slavery how that they were told the emancipation proclamation would be sounding and one of them would climb on the top of the barn and look watch for the rising of the sun see oh my as soon as the sun came up they hollowed we are free we are free praise god hallelujah you see and we can do the same here praise god out of the message called job he says you too can say you see the s-o-n now oh my you see him in the way of this revelation that god has revealed him to your heart hallelujah and the only way you'll ever know that is when god reveals him to you that's the basis of the scripture that flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you amen but my father in heaven and upon this rock i'll build my church so we see that is where the church is built on spiritual revelation praise god hallelujah i said i was going to pass over this stuff but i can't it's too oh my now he's talking about certain um very prominent preacher whose name i won't call here but he he calls his name out here and said they bought rented the same auditorium and one had the auditorium for this hour to this hour and then brother branham's crowd is going to come after for the same auditorium he says i he he he went there earlier and when he went there earlier that preacher came and met him behind the scenes and says brother branham don't bother come into this auditorium it's too big you can never fill it uh and um you know you don't have advertisements you don't have programs you don't have men to go out there and spread the news that this and that and the other and you say well brother i'll do the best i can you know and i'll just have my meeting and so on he said brother branham i'm telling you i'll give you the money that you paid out for this auditorium that you won't lose a dime i'll give it to you i don't want to see you as my brother in christ losing money because you know nobody came out or a very few came out to your meetings and stuff like that my man said no brother it's fine it's all right it's all to the glory of god praise god so he went on to his meeting he had his meeting thousands of people he had and he says and here they come oh my see they were coming out it's fine women fine men shaken hands oh my there they were see look wonderful oh what a what a big crowd of fine dress people highly educated people and so on oh my then when his crowd went out here comes my crowd in amen there they were in their wheelchairs there they were in their straight jackets there there

everything else hallelujah do you know when that crowd came in there were so many people there oh they filled the auditorium and then a half more the size of the auditorium was on the outside standing up everywhere trying to get in for where the carcass is that's where the eagles were together together hallelujah i believe it even my wife said to me billy where where do all these people come from oh he said well he said well sweetheart they come to hear me preach he says but where are they coming from all of them he says yes they're coming from the east they're coming from the west they're coming from the north they're coming from the south they're coming from the lands of fire to feast with the king and to dying as his guests how blessed those pilgrims are he said they're children of the king they're not here to see me they're the same as the king jesus hallelujah they have to seek jesus oh he said when i said that oh my i just couldn't take it anymore right there in the street i raised my hands and said their dying lamb thy precious blood shall never lose its power till all the ranks of church of god are saved to sin no more amen amen amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise be to our god glory and honor unto his marvelous wonderful name don't you understand amen that we are now feasting on the the feast of tabernacles under the seventh church age amen but now

come out of their graves right and now watch it now brother branham is saying that the dead saints shall arise and unite with those that are now living to go and unite with jesus for eternity and it's what he's saying is scriptural for the dead and christ shall rise for us hallelujah in which we who are alive and remain amen we are going to be caught up together to meet the lord in the air praise

supper of the lamb oh praise god forevermore amen hallelujah glory to god amen hallelujah wonderful wonderful wonderful praise god i'm pausing here just for a minute i'm about to close out he says remember i said before it's time for swarming hallelujah it's time for them to sit down at that table of the wedding supper and they're united together already wed in marriage to him living now as bright and bright groom now to live as that throughout all times and all ages that is to come and throughout all the ceaseless eternity oh my as one together amen yes sir everything is getting ready praise the lord hallelujah now the time is come when this one fellow one time i remember had some ducks and this fellow tried to cut off their wings so that they won't fly out of the pen that he has them in isn't that what these nominations try to do to you cut off your wings so you can't fly out of their pen he see but his other friend had some ducks on the other side in some water and another one some ducks on the other side in some water but then the water began to rise you've heard this before but think it began to rise and the water got so higher amen see i'm emphasizing the water got higher the water of the word amen the revelation of the word the clear crystal clear distilled understanding of the word becomes so clear starts to rise so higher amen that they could literally put up with one another they can put up with me and my ways of doing things why don't i speak scholarly why don't i give appropriate lecture with the proper gestures and why don't i do like they might have taught me in school give you the photogenic side where you can take a proper picture and turn the other way picture and so on why i don't have time for that my time is with him the word is to get the word of god to you praise the name of the lord god bless us god keep us you pray for me and let me pray for you praise the lord pray for brother hutchinson simply we see him he comes here he gets up he talks sometimes you know he told me they had to rush him to the hospital you know got this heart problem he's got that problem that problem they find out he had several problems he had to quit whatever he was doing and slow down right because men of god you want to keep going you want to keep going but the time comes you've got to slow down you know you've got to slow down there's too many so you look good yeah you're looking good it's got nothing to do with it amen we got to pray one for another hallelujah amen see first thing you know that water rose so high they got together i say let the waters keep rising let it keep rising and let them denominational virus be floated out and just get get together and get get in those deep waters hallelujah we got to get in the deep waters hallelujah praise god hallelujah amen and now i'm going to close with this this is my last uh quotation that i'm going to use truly praise the lord just a few days ago i was standing on the street corner and watching the parade going down the street seeing all them old world war tanks leading the way and the big heavy sherman tank behind and the mothers cold start mothers crying wives boys who lost their daddy an old mother lost her son and so on and as they passed the music struck up oh one were christian soldiers they were playing their marches but when they passed that spot i was thinking of the great march that we have to make of that great resurrection day hallelujah when we will be marching all timers will come forth saints patriarchs saints of all ages we which are alive and remain shall not prevent them but will be caught up with them together marching through the skies hallelujah standing waiting for a change and falling in line with the word oh may god make us faithful soldiers what i'm saying to you just like brother branham's crowd came in some of them with crutches some of them with wheelchairs some of them would stretch or whatever god don't care nothing about that amen god doesn't care you make it in to that doorway past the door and your coat get caught in the door because you're the last one coming in you're in don't care about your coat being caught in the door somebody limping to go go in god doesn't care about that as long as you obey the word and get in hallelujah another one comes and says brothers y'all gotta pray for me you gotta help me i gotta get in there praise god and their cross over whether it's being a wheelchair whatever hallelujah praise god when the saints go marching in i want to hear that number let's close in that note hallelujah yes for many have been in the battles of life he's talking about natural life now and you're going in to the rapture time i want to reference the little room when he said they went in amen and they came out they went and crippled they went in blind they went in death he was not talking about natural deafness or natural crippledness he was not talking about those things but a lot of believers have been in this mess and they've gone through all kinds of stresses all kind of strains all kinds of headaches all kinds of heart aches all kind of of troubles and trials in their lives their battle scarred their he says they've been in the battles of life they've been chewed up by the enemy they're fought with the while that wild beast that lion and they got clawed they got scratched they got marked amen but now when the saints go marching in these veterans of faith their faith are the word of god they held the gods of change in hand let musicians come praise the lord amen oh hold to god's unchanging hand hold to god's unchanging hands build your hopes on things eternal hold to god's unchanging him call that not this world's been riches that so rapidly decays seek to gain the heavenly treasures they shall never pass away so let us [Music] unchanging him [Music] oh god we praise the lord when the redeemed [Music] changes [Music] hallelujah when the saints [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] on my way oh [Music] is [Music] if [Music] is [Applause] is [Music] like [Music] oh i am thinking of the rapture [Music] [Music] redemption story is [Music] is is
