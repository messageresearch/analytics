think just think for a moment amen do you know your own future but there's someone here who knows about your future and he says your future is clear amen hallelujah I enjoy the worship today and as a minister you look for little key things during the worship or even before the service that were just saying and vindicate to you that what God has laid on your heart is right in the direction Hallelujah we sang I have decided to follow Jesus have you decided to follow Jesus amen hallelujah and it's not turning back and everything just lining line up with my little thoughts here that I'm gonna bring to you today Hallelujah we have a little ring here I don't know why what Hallelujah thank God he showed you the way amen don't want to keep you all standing too long amen but could you as we go into the word of God we just put on the second slide there for me please don't know if it's up there yet but praise God we still we're still gonna carry on man nothing is going to hinder nothing nothing Hallelujah just greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and I'd like to welcome each and every one of you that are present with us here and those that are out there amen Hallelujah and may God bless you all today amen and we like to turn to our scripture from Genesis 17 to when those that you have your Bibles you can just turn to it from Genesis 17 and 1 and the other scripture reading is from Hebrews 11 to 13. Hallelujah they want to keep you standing too long amen praise God thank you Lord if you got to say Amen amen take out your soul this morning amen hallelujah we're going to chop down the enemy and nothing is going to hinder us amen hallelujah reading Genesis 17 and 1. and when Abraham Abraham was 90 years older nine the Lord appeared to Abraham and said unto him I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect hallelujah our next scripture reading we'd like you to turn to Hebrews 11. verse 8 revealing from 8 to 13 amen as we have read the Lord said to Abraham walk before me and be thou perfect did Abraham make mistakes man yes he did but when we look at the next scripture readings Hebrews 11 8 by faith which is the key by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance Hallelujah obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles which Isaac and Jacob and their heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which had foundations whose Builder and maker is God and through faith also Sarah herself receives strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him who had promised I just want to take my time every single little phrase could just be expanded so much amen and I can go to so many areas roads that can you know different challenges you can take and the world is just ex expanded just like the Roman Candle you just hit one spot and it just opens up opens up and opens up Hallelujah so she judged him faithful Who had who had made the promise man therefore sprung there even one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky in multitude and as the sand which is by the seashore in Europe innumerable these all died in faith not having received the promise but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confess that they were strangers and pilgrims on the Earth Hallelujah let us all pray over kind God eternal Heavenly Father you are the resurrected one the one who died for us and rose again and we come before your throne of grace this morning to give you thanks that we can once more assemble ourselves together Lord to worship to fellowship and to just share your sweet words Lord father Lord we ask your blessing on each and every one today Lord bless the reading of the word Lord bless the hearers Lord anointed that they may receive something Lord that they must be shrinking for this journey that lies ahead Lord father Lord we thank you for your grace and your love oh God for your election in our lives Lord father oh God we commit all into your hands Lord father for your honor and For Your Glory in Jesus name we pray amen amen you all may be seated amen Hallelujah my little talk a little subject today is the Christian walk Hallelujah and that walk is not just when you come to church it's not a walk when your Jazz will be fellowshipping or something like but every day every moment walk Hallelujah and that Christian walk is our walk from Earth to Glory it's from book of from Revelation and from Genesis to Revelations Hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus now as we have read God called Abraham to walk before him Hallelujah did God may call you today and he said to Abraham be thou perfect because God was looking at the German seat that was inside Abraham he's not looking at the outward part he was looking at the part of himself God departed God placed himself in Abraham amen that that part was perfect amen Abraham didn't know that them even though he made mistakes Hallelujah and just as so as you and I we make mistakes along this journey but if the Lord said to us that to be thou perfect as our heavenly father is perfect amen so you know what he's saying to you that there's Perfection that is lying with inside of you man Hallelujah that that has the the German size uh to grow amen and show fruits of perfection man Hallelujah so you might say you're weak you say you know I make mistakes and all these kinds of things that confronts your life and you slip your slide your foot but there is a Jones sea that is lying in you today that is perfect Hallelujah Hallelujah and this walk is a walk by faith amen we look at Abraham as the father of Faith amen hallelujah praise God you see when Abraham was called out amen he was called into a place amen that he should receive as an inheritance Hallelujah he was called into a place that he didn't pass there before amen hallelujah amen and he went out he did not know where he was going amen do you know where you are going today man God called you to be a Christian and a question is to be Christ's like when they ask you out there are you uh what church you will go to you say well I belong to a non-denominational Christian Church they say well is it Pentecostal is it Baptist no it's a Christian Church because if you go to a Pentecostal church and you receive a Pentecostal teaching you will produce Pentecostal fruits amen but if you go to a Christian pure unadulterated word of God where is thought you will bring forth Christ oh my God praise the Lord hallelujah praise God you see by faith he said John in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob even though the seed that God that promised Abraham wasn't manifested yet yet in Abraham knew that there was a a a people that was coming forth amen hallelujah that was dwelling within him that's how he could have believed God so when God makes a promise to you and I you see once you read from the scripture by faith Sarah amen hallelujah because she judged him faithful not Abraham who made the promise not the priest that made the promise not the church that made the promise but almighty God gave her that promise amen hallelujah and almighty God who gave you a promise today what is that promise that you received today Hallelujah I don't want to jump ahead on my time ahead of what I would like to bring forth to you today but I know you know it's going to be coming Hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus praise God so when we look here first I'd like to take Abraham Abraham forsook all amen if we suck his own land if your circus property he owned I want you to be thinking forsook everything is forsoka's family if for circus friends if we suck all them other relationships he had out there dropped it all out and it followed God but it did not fully Obed I want to show you why amen because this Christian walk calls for Allah a work of total separation and separation from unbelief amen the Lord said do not unequally yoke yourself amen and what he is talking about it's not just it's it's be it's not just talking about your friends and your family and everything like that and but on belief amen which is the number one thing amen hallelujah praise God you see not for one moment amen Hallelujah God will forget you when you forsake all and follow him follow him when the disciples were called amen when they were called Peter James and John they left their Nets behind they left all their professions behind they left everything behind and they followed Jesus amen hallelujah and you know one day Lord you know I forsake all what would you give me what is in return you think Peter was canal no Lord I forsake everything I forsake this stat and the other and I followed you what it isn't for me amen and you know the Lord said to them he said he said yes you might think he is kind of you'll get salvation you get eternal life is not enough you want more than that but you know something God is a God that doesn't forget your sacrifice it doesn't forget what to do for him man hallelujah hallelujah amen and he pays big dividends he plays with big interests Hallelujah he said you're going to have lands and houses and everything and this world and even if they want to come but what did he do to Abraham see God promised Abraham a land right the land of King he said look to the East look to the West look to the North and South all this I have given to thee but you know deep down in Abraham when you go all got that you know that didn't satisfy that what was inside of him he was looking for a city whose Builder and maker was God and he count it as he being a stranger dwelling in this land are you being a stranger in this land you see the more the world drops off for you the most strange you look you're going to be a stranger to the world Hallelujah so in this Christian walk amen hallelujah you're looking for a city the architect the designer amen hallelujah the one who makes it man is God himself Hallelujah thank you Lord please thank you praise God you see the question walk is a walk of obedience see the first thing Abraham did you obeyed he obeyed amen you see when you get convicted when the Lord called you amen and you recognize and you realize listen I'm just a sinner I made so much mistakes I got to repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ you went into water baptism by The Obedience of the word amen hallelujah and obedience is better than sacrifice number one step obedience man this Christian walk is a walk of endurance amen Hallelujah it's a walk of patience amen could you give me slide four please thank you brother man I don't know what but thank God for his grace amen the enemy trying to hinder I See the Light start to flicking your background yeah say wow something good is going to happen today amen and the enemy is trying to prevent it but listen we shall prevail amen hallelujah thank you Lord see faith comes by hearing and by hearing of the word of God so you didn't you need to listen amen I'm not listen only with your air but listen with your heart that God will break it to you amen hallelujah reveality because he's the only one who can do it he's the only one who can do it right Revelation is Sovereign and he gives it to whoever he Wills hallelujah praise God it's a walk of endurance of patience as the scripture says the rest is not to the Swift but those that endure and enjoying halfway drop off at the beginning address right onto the end a race of endurance so you got to hold on and it's not you holding on as God holding you Hallelujah Hallelujah and this walk is not a walk by just sight or by the five senses it's a walk by faith amen God gives you a clear understanding of his word and it it's anchored into your heart and when that happens you know something definite happens to you not sensation but you know something is growingly deep down in your heart that a change took place something happened so anytime the enemy comes by and tell me telling you that you're not saving you look back to where the Lord brought you from and the experience you had with the Lord because you Satan cannot give you that never could give you that amen hallelujah and it's gone young people listen hallelujah amen you need to be born again have a change amen have to have a a turnaround in your life and have a personal experience with God himself that you know that you know that you know you might be able to explain it to your friends or family but to know something took place within me amen hallelujah and that's where it lies I mean Hallelujah thank you Lord Mark 13 and 13 says and you shall be hated of all men for my name's sake but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved amen so you've got to go all the way he went all the way you got to go all the way all the way he went to Calvary for you one for me amen honey is encouraging you today to go all the way all the way Hallelujah men this walk you might be tired on your way but sit down a little rest amen he's a shrink amen hallelujah you say I've been walking for 20 years I've been walking for 30 years amen the road the end is near men this life journey is this world is fixing for a big change a big change a big change a big huge big change amen so God says he's encouraging you keep passing on don't give up not now to slack off keep going amen if you see a brother you know kind of struggling lift him up give him my help in hand encourage him don't push him down man Hallelujah encourage one another Hallelujah praise God Thessalonians second Thessalonians one and four so that we ourselves glory in you in the Churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that you endure so testing Gonna Come persecution is going to come but God is telling you you want to enjoy it because he's not going to give you more than you can there amen it's just to pull out the faith and patience that is already in you you don't know what you got in you until God put you to the test man I always say you don't know this the the quality of a material until you test it and you got material and God's gonna put you under some pressure and test to bring out what the sweetness that in you the patience that is in you the love that is in you amen hallelujah the brotherly kindness that is in you amen hallelujah and bring out all them virtues that is in you amen by the trials and the testings that you go through Hallelujah in second Timothy 2 3 says Thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ we're not called to a picnic here the day you decided you say I decided to follow Jesus yeah you maybe you got to make that choice too right but he's the one who chose you amen hallelujah and the day you made that choice enemies on your tracks he's on your tracks he's trying to turn you back in every direction pressure is going to come hardship is going to come trial is going to come the Christian walk is not a bed of roses Hallelujah if I know you don't realize it wake up wake up man that is not an easy walk amen hallelujah praise God no you see it has door that Abraham was following something blindly when God called him he said Abraham just uproot yourself and just go if God tells you to do that what you're going to think you don't know where you're heading to right nothing you leave everything behind no money in your pocket no nothing just go you say what kind of God the world the world manner safe you've got to be insane you following Our God blind and you know many times they tell you that what kind of Christianity who cannot really generally follow him you're going to show three times that we can live in from way of day traveling and look at the price ideas and what you paying tithes to these church people you're gonna be crazy yeah does a Christian walk but you're doing it out of love and obedience it's not hard once the love of God is in your heart you do it with a joy with a passion amen hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus Hallelujah he received that promise calling those things which were not as though they were what Abraham was promised that you're going to have a son what are we promised today we're going to have a body change amen Hallelujah and I'm going to show you from what the Lord is kind of just show me some nice Little Gems that lay inside a deer why it excited me Hallelujah amen praise God no Abraham was called before as Abraham Abraham as he was called before was an idol worshiper of all people they were doing human sexual sacrifice worshiping idols and everything and God love us upon that man according to the priests and the high priests and is there that you're going to choose God why could you choose me I'm the high priest I follow I worship I sing I have all the the rituals and all the pompan ceremony that goes with worship how Communists select me but you see God election is for the humble for the babes and sucklings such as you who would be saved not the wise and a prudent not those up on high places the lordong what's the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ publicans and sinners are prostituted by the wayside amen oh my oh my when you think about the love of God the world God choose us it just tears your heart to bring you down break you inside to know God choose me of all people a sinner and no good and Renegade as myself hmm my and out of that came a nation a people that God is blessing amen hallelujah praise God yet he was the father of Jews he was a Charlie and from the Italian from the city of who and he was called out from among his people to walk in a Strange Land this message you're following the world considered the most strangest thing it's not according to the church creeds they say oh my these things you for I really had to be strange and the way your dress is really stranger it's not the norm it's not acceptable in the world you got to be different man you got to be one in a million and I think it's more than one in a million these days Hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus you see Abraham counted himself as a stranger and as I was saying before the more you'll get rid of yourself and the more that your feet and the word of God and all those things that so easily beset you starts to fall off you're not conforming to the things of the world you're going to be looking they're going to look to you as a stranger you're going to be strangest for them but you know you're going to stand out as a testimony to this world that you're a son or you're a daughter of God amen hallelujah that is your testimony your life is your testimony to them you wouldn't have to say one word to them the way that they see how you live how you talk how your dress how you conduct yourself is going to be a testimony against them amen that here is one who could have lived their life amen here is one an example who could live the life of God and there is others Hallelujah [Music] blessed be his wonderful name Hallelujah you could walk through this world and be not contaminated and you're going to be coming out white Hallelujah you're in this world but you're not off this world at all you're not of this world Hallelujah how beautiful that types the Christian walk today that we have to come out from among the associations of the world all the teachings the Creeds and the doctrines all the religious sex that your sections that you came out from amen from all the different denominations that you will call out from to follow this walk it's a holy walk it's a spiritual walk amen it's a supernatural walk it's not you walk in is God walking with you he will not leave you enough forsake you but he's gonna be in you even to the end at this age amen so you don't have to walk alone Hallelujah blessed be his wonderful name Hallelujah Hallelujah you see when Abraham Hallelujah left amen praise God thank you Lord Jesus praise God the land that we are calling today is to walk in the Christian way to be christ-like Hallelujah walk with Christ separate yourself from the things of the world and what this could just say if you love the world and the things of the world the love of God is Not In You so the more you attach yourself to the world it shows that you are off the wall and God's love is not in you so something else is driving you but not the love of God Hallelujah you see when you first heard the gospel of the good news you begin to feel a pull inside a tongue on your heart amen and something begins to move just go back to your experience when God started when God started to deal with your life there was a pool inside that's what that man was saying is nothing but the truth that is me when you watch yourself in the mirror of God's word amen you said that is me that is me I'm not a child of this world amen hallelujah I have been called to walk as dedicated work a walk that is separated unto God and God himself hallelujah praise God could you give me slide five please and when you gotta pull and talk amen you must have tried everything out there that the world had to offer you try the drinking they call Rose in the party and there's a big bondong tongue happening right now I mean if it's happened already because all the traffic and everything that we are facing coming up this way the caribana they jump up and everything I always say it's gonna be a real jump up in hell for them when the fire take them you'll be real jumping and wheeling and gnashing off teeth yep Hallelujah man nothing couldn't satisfy you think about it the drugs the alcohol the woman the carousing the party the movies everything you try to indulge and try to to fill in and glow with the flow amen hallelujah but it takes a living fish to go Upstream if you go over the fluorescent if you just sweep you away and you have to do nothing it just takes you you don't really have to do anything but if you decided to follow Jesus as we sang today amen follow the Christian way it's a straight and a narrow way man broad is the way that leads to destruction and many on that road life don't you want to be on that road the world to Glory Hallelujah praise God blessed is wonderful name then you heard a voicing come on to until he that labor and a heavy leader you're being burdened with sin oppression depression what a time you living in this world when you talk about oppression and depression amen the world is full of that no the doctors don't know what to do disease sickness pestilence everything economic trouble situation and everything men's hearts are failing for fear they don't know what the next moment is about Hallelujah but we can tell them what it is about man Hallelujah come out from them my people and be not partakers of their plagues come to this walk come to this holy war come to this Christian walk come to a separated walk unto the Lord Jesus Christ and he will give you rest rest not just for the day or for the next moment when you take the drink you can't get up with a hangover worse than before I heard a a drug addict say from the very first time that you take a shot I could never get that same high from the force high when I get because I tried two three times more now and I can't get that so what it is you enjoy the pleasures of sin just for a season Hallelujah praise God come on to me all eat that are labored and heavy laden and I the Lord Jesus Christ will give you rest are not just for a moment Eternal rest a peace a rest that will pass all man's understanding what a thing that is going to be have you experienced that rest yet in your life if not come to this water come to this Fountain come follow this Lord follow this pathway that leads from oath to Glory Hallelujah glory to his wonderful limb see now the gospel Slide Five I believe it is up there now now the gospel commonly believed is the word of God and that is true in one sense but the word of the God is Not gospel alone the word of God is the seed that produces the gospel amen Jesus said A sower went forth and sow seed they say the word of God is like seed planted what is on which ground it falls amen which gong is going to fall on amen and it's the manifestation amen of that seed in the ground that is the good news that is the gospel hallelujah praise God this is something by the wayside some fell on Tony Stony South but some feeling good futile predestinated soil and produce after it's kind a hundredfold a thousandfold amen hallelujah blessed is wonderful name now the seed you people here who are farmers as the prophet was saying every seed will produce if it's in the right kind of ground and every Divine promise of God in the Bible will produce if it's met in the right ground Hallelujah so if you want healing today amen and it's in the right heart receive your healing right now in the name of Jesus if you need salvation today amen hallelujah in the right heart receive it right now in the name of Jesus Hallelujah blessed be his
