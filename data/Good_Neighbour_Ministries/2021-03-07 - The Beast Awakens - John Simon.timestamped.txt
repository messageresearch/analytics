[2:34] scripture this morning thank god the sun

[2:44] genesis chapter 1
[2:48] in the beginning god
[2:51] created the
[2:54] heaven and the earth
[2:58] and the earth was without form
[3:03] and void and darkness
[3:07] was upon the face of the deep
[3:12] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[3:16] face of the waters
[3:20] genesis 3 1 3 and
[3:24] god said let
[3:28] there be light and there was light
[3:33] hallelujah thank god god spoke his word
[3:38] and his word came to pass
[3:41] let us pray as i

[3:57] or heavenly father
[4:01] we ask your blessing upon this
[4:05] thy word grant
[4:08] inspiration direction revelation
[4:12] understanding what speaker and hearer
[4:16] and at the end of this all
[4:19] to thee be all the praise the honor and
[4:22] glory
[4:23] in jesus name amen
[4:26] and amen
[4:30] way back beyond the very
[4:33] mists of time in the dateless
[4:37] past outside of time
[4:43] and before time was
[4:48] two ages are mentioned
[4:52] by various uh theologians
[4:55] bible students and those who search the
[4:59] scriptures diligently
[5:02] first there is the alpha age
[5:07] and the earth's history
[5:11] ends with the omega age or
[5:14] ages
[5:18] the alpha age as mentioned by
[5:22] dr pember and by
[5:26] dr clarence larkin
[5:30] are first of all earth's earliest
[5:36] ages
[5:38] dr larkin says we find out that sin
[5:41] and evil existed
[5:45] before man
[5:49] satan and his angels
[5:53] were in rebellion against god
[5:57] for it seems as if satan was in charge
[6:00] of the earth at that time
[6:04] before our time began
[6:09] now but being in rebellion
[6:14] god kicked him out of heaven
[6:18] he fell to earth whatever judgments
[6:23] god sent to the earth we
[6:26] do not know but in genesis
[6:30] 1 the bible does tell us
[6:34] that in the beginning
[6:37] god created the
[6:40] heaven and the earth
[6:44] now between genesis one and two uh
[6:48] one and three there could have been
[6:51] millions of years and so
[6:55] we find that god
[6:58] judging the earth because of satanic
[7:01] evil
[7:02] and the sin of of the evil one who was
[7:06] once called lucifer
[7:09] cast out satan his name
[7:12] changed and he became satan
[7:16] the evil one the devil
[7:20] the liar who was a liar from the
[7:24] beginning
[7:25] speaking lies to the one-third of those
[7:28] angels
[7:30] and then speaking lies in the
[7:33] ears of eve
[7:36] and then speaking lies through
[7:40] the physical frame that he
[7:43] brought to being true eve
[7:47] by his uh hybriding
[7:52] brought forth a liar when he was
[7:55] asked where is your brother abel
[7:58] he says i don't know well he had already
[8:01] killed him and he very well knew that he
[8:03] killed him
[8:04] and here he was with no respects no
[8:07] regard for god
[8:09] lying to a god who is omnipotent
[8:12] omniscient
[8:13] all-knowing and yet he lied to god
[8:16] and the pharisees are his descendants
[8:20] and the liars of today are his
[8:22] descendants
[8:23] and this is why i said jesus said you
[8:26] are of your
[8:27] father the devil for he was a liar from
[8:30] the beginning
[8:33] whatever judgments god sent upon the
[8:36] earth
[8:37] we do not know but the bible
[8:40] does say and the earth
[8:44] was without form and void now of course
[8:47] we know
[8:48] god did not create a wasteland
[8:51] god did not create chaos
[8:54] god created something what was beautiful
[8:58] wonderful beyond our imagination
[9:02] but because of the sin of satan and his
[9:05] minions
[9:06] the evil angels that followed him
[9:10] his associates god
[9:14] sent judgment upon the earth
[9:17] causing it to be without form
[9:21] and void now this
[9:26] destruction my friends
[9:30] came upon the earth and
[9:33] crossed it as i said before to have
[9:37] no form or formless chaotic
[9:41] and void of life everywhere
[9:44] the light whatever life was there was
[9:48] destroyed now
[9:51] between the alpha ages
[9:55] age and the omega
[9:58] age is what we call time
[10:02] alpha omega
[10:06] and the alpha the beginning
[10:09] before all things upon this earth began
[10:15] there was other life
[10:19] before god set the judgment
[10:22] and the earth became without form and
[10:25] void
[10:27] then god said god created a
[10:31] new creation
[10:34] having birth and no doubt destroyed
[10:39] the old one and out of that
[10:42] came this new one
[10:46] now the omega ages
[10:50] or a mega age right
[10:54] for time is made up of ages
[10:57] the alpha age is made up of epochs
[11:02] and here we are time having its own
[11:05] dispensation and ages and then we have
[11:09] the
[11:10] omega age or ages which we will
[11:15] uh simply let you know that's speaking
[11:18] of
[11:18] eternity but the omega
[11:22] age or ages begins
[11:27] with the ending of the church age
[11:32] ages and the beginning
[11:36] of the eternal church age
[11:40] for the eternal church age
[11:43] is the omega age
[11:48] and the omega age of course means
[11:51] you've broken back into eternity
[11:54] once again here you
[11:58] are statue of a perfect man of course
[12:01] paragraph 31
[12:03] 1962 now between
[12:06] genesis 1 to genesis
[12:11] 1 3 could have been millions
[12:15] and millions of years of time
[12:20] that was i believe the time
[12:24] when the dinosaurs
[12:28] roamed the earth
[12:31] dinosaurs roam the earth
[12:36] i believe there were pterodactyls
[12:40] that's the time uh as we say the raptors
[12:45] roamed the earth
[12:48] all men are flying of beasts and
[12:52] fowl animals flying
[12:56] and i can't imagine them i don't know
[12:59] anything
[12:59] much about them but they have been
[13:02] finding
[13:03] bones relics
[13:07] they have been finding these traces
[13:11] of these various pre-historic
[13:16] beasts let's call that pre-adamic
[13:22] beasts preadamic times
[13:26] and so dinosaurs
[13:30] pterodactyls raptors
[13:33] they walk the earth the bible
[13:37] tells us also giants roamed
[13:40] the earth at that particular time
[13:43] for it will take giants to deal with
[13:46] those kinds of beasts and
[13:48] and animals at that that time
[13:52] whatever else was there
[13:55] we do not know that is why
[13:59] uh if i might drop this in here man
[14:02] talks about
[14:03] inventing electricity and inventing
[14:05] atomic energy and inventing this and
[14:07] inventing that
[14:08] those things no doubt were already
[14:12] there we are now discovering
[14:16] them and we think it's all new
[14:19] but it is not as the wisest
[14:23] man has said there is no
[14:26] new thing under the sun
[14:30] now you know as well as i do
[14:35] they have many books written about this
[14:38] in the
[14:39] various uh libraries
[14:42] of the world of how scientists
[14:46] archaeologists various students
[14:50] in this particular area have
[14:53] been uncovering various
[14:57] traces of these animals bones
[15:01] and so on
[15:04] and many of them are being now
[15:08] exposed or uncovered
[15:12] and we can now recognize their existence
[15:16] this of course has caused the conflict
[15:19] between
[15:19] science and religion because science is
[15:23] saying oh religion
[15:24] is saying that we were just 6 000 years
[15:28] old and we know for a fact these animals
[15:32] are
[15:33] maybe a million years old maybe
[15:36] thousands we don't know
[15:37] 11 700 years old whatever
[15:41] but the fact is there really is no
[15:44] conflict
[15:47] because man only came on the earth
[15:50] after those things took place
[15:54] and so here we are brothers
[15:57] that the earth suffered from its its ice
[16:00] age
[16:01] its natural ice age
[16:04] when god judged it the
[16:08] earth coming to a place without form
[16:12] and with odd void and void
[16:16] so genesis 1 3
[16:19] actually was the beginning man
[16:23] and the enter earth and everything on it
[16:26] was the beginning of a new creation
[16:31] a new creation and
[16:34] mankind being
[16:37] made or installed
[16:41] by god as the
[16:44] kings and queens of the earth
[16:47] adam and eve
[16:51] were king and queen over the
[16:54] entire creation
[16:58] and there were our representative
[17:03] now god in the book of acts
[17:09] birthed or certified
[17:13] and created his church
[17:17] on the foundations of the
[17:21] rock of revelation which in these days
[17:24] have become the rejected stone
[17:28] man prefers reason to revelation
[17:32] man prefers intellectuality
[17:35] rather than inspiration
[17:38] man prefers those things but god said
[17:42] uh upon this rock i'll build my
[17:46] church and the gates of hell
[17:49] shall not prevail against it
[17:53] now the church being built upon
[17:57] the rock of spiritual revelation satan
[18:01] in his rebellion
[18:04] felt came from heaven
[18:07] cast down to earth according to the
[18:09] prophets
[18:12] did not stop his rebellion but continued
[18:16] to pres to create mayhem
[18:20] murder and madness misery
[18:24] everywhere that he could
[18:28] and so he brought about now
[18:32] not just a natural
[18:35] ice age but a spiritual
[18:39] ice age upon the face of the earth
[18:44] and he brought it as you know winter
[18:47] comes not only with cold but darkness
[18:51] and so he brought a a spiritual
[18:54] ice age upon that church
[18:58] that god had birthed by acts 2
[19:02] 4 by the pouring out of the holy spirit
[19:05] of the living god he brought spiritual
[19:08] darkness upon the church and brought
[19:12] freezing cold spiritual
[19:15] atmospheres and weather in the church
[19:19] trying to kill the church by that
[19:22] freezing spiritual atmosphere
[19:26] and to turn the hearts of the children
[19:29] away from the spiritual
[19:32] apostolic fathers that were there
[19:37] how many of you have ever heard of a
[19:39] dead man's walk
[19:41] well when one one is caught
[19:46] out in the wilderness in real
[19:49] freezing cold weather
[19:52] it seems to play tricks with the mind
[19:57] and then a man that's lost
[20:00] will begin to walk thinking he's going
[20:04] in the right direction
[20:07] and even if he walked for 40 years 50
[20:10] years
[20:11] uh sorry for five minutes 10 minutes
[20:14] whatever
[20:15] he will find that he has walked in a
[20:18] circle
[20:18] then he began noticing all the old trees
[20:22] and and marks that he saw before
[20:26] with that he will then realize
[20:31] that he's really really lost
[20:34] and he's walking in a circle and can't
[20:38] help it he may try again he may try two
[20:40] more times
[20:41] and yet he find himself caught
[20:44] up in a vicious dance of death
[20:47] a vicious death walk and then
[20:51] what begins to happen
[20:54] is that man or woman starts to get
[20:58] sleepy
[21:00] now they may be in the church but they
[21:02] get start to get lukewarm and sleepy
[21:05] they must start to lose their fire their
[21:07] fervor
[21:08] the heat of that god and the walk that
[21:11] god
[21:11] gives to your soul with the love power
[21:14] and presence of the holy spirit and
[21:18] they begin to relax and relax and the
[21:21] next thing you know
[21:22] that man will decide well let me stop
[21:25] and take a rest and just lean against
[21:28] the trunk of a tree
[21:30] and you know what that'll be the last
[21:33] time he stops
[21:35] because when he or she stops leans on
[21:37] that tree
[21:39] to take a good rest and then rest
[21:43] and they'll fall into the sleep of death
[21:48] and others will come and find them
[21:51] frozen
[21:53] frozen right where there were
[21:57] in the church but frozen
[22:00] somewhere frozen to death
[22:04] because of their own lukewarmness
[22:08] their disobedience their stubbornness
[22:11] and the same spirit of rebellion instead
[22:15] of saying oh my father
[22:17] a prophet got lost and he says lord
[22:20] lead me and guide me out of here
[22:23] i can't be my own guide i don't know
[22:25] where i'm going
[22:26] you lead me and the spirit of god
[22:30] led him out of the wilderness that
[22:33] same spirit of god can lead us
[22:36] in our lives path out of our
[22:40] spiritual wilderness that we are
[22:43] in but this is what was happening to the
[22:48] church the entire church after 6480
[22:54] after the time of paul the apostles the
[22:57] fire the forward to fight the anointing
[23:00] within their lives within their hearts
[23:04] that fire began to be cooling off
[23:08] and dying out it just did not
[23:12] die like that overnight it took
[23:15] uh ages or centuries for it to die
[23:19] out from under paul and then
[23:23] less than the next age less in the next
[23:25] age
[23:26] until we come to
[23:30] the all time after
[23:34] the freezing cold
[23:37] and contrary winds began to blow
[23:41] upon the old ship of zion
[23:45] and completely put the master sailors
[23:51] all to sleep this
[23:55] in church history is called
[23:58] the time of the dark ages
[24:01] dark spiritually dark
[24:05] and cold as cold could be
[24:10] within the very framework of the church
[24:14] of god
[24:16] it was a time of spiritual chaos
[24:20] a time of uh misunderstanding
[24:24] doubt fear superstition
[24:27] witchcraft every possible
[24:30] evil from satan was released
[24:35] at that particular time under the cover
[24:38] of darkness
[24:40] and the freezing cold atmosphere
[24:44] that was within the then
[24:48] known church it was during these dark
[24:52] ages
[24:54] we come into the time of inquisition
[24:58] millions yes millions
[25:03] killed crucified upside down
[25:07] burnt at the stake many
[25:11] marched into the colosseum of rome
[25:16] and there led to their death
[25:19] under the ferocity of lions
[25:23] tigers and other wild beasts
[25:28] men and women slaughtered
[25:31] as the bible tells us the scriptures and
[25:34] psalms
[25:35] how they eat up my people as if they
[25:38] were eating bread
[25:40] god's people burnt
[25:44] slaughtered destroyed in every
[25:48] possible way why was that happening
[25:52] because the so-called church
[25:56] then church by name only
[26:00] was encased like the
[26:03] all dinosaurs encased
[26:07] in total ice it was a
[26:11] spiritual ice age of the
[26:14] church of the living god
[26:17] for the people in the church
[26:20] bibles locked with a brass lock
[26:24] of which only the priests could unlock
[26:29] that to read out of it
[26:32] made to be so mysterious and fearful and
[26:38] so
[26:39] the people were frozen by the spirit of
[26:43] fear
[26:46] they were frozen
[26:49] by the lady lengthy liturgies
[26:54] and and so-called
[26:57] uh masses that would just
[27:00] put them into a dead man's walk
[27:05] and put them fully asleep
[27:10] my friends for centuries the church
[27:14] was caught up into the
[27:18] freezing winds and
[27:21] atmosphere of the dark ages
[27:26] of this nominal false
[27:30] church contrary to the word of god
[27:34] but thank god then jesus came
[27:38] but thank god he never leaves himself a
[27:41] wit without a witness
[27:44] thank god 1906.
[27:48] the powerful or revival
[27:51] of a souza street began
[27:54] what was it the awakening of the church
[27:59] martin luther the church began to awake
[28:04] hallelujah wesley the
[28:07] church began to rouse herself
[28:12] amen then under pentecost
[28:16] the church stood up on its feet praised
[28:20] god and began to speak and anoint
[28:23] the the lay hands on the sick miracles
[28:27] signs
[28:27] wonders and the power in the presence of
[28:30] god
[28:30] and that age of pentecost
[28:34] until the coming of malachi 4 5
[28:38] the prophet elijah in the spirit of
[28:41] elijah
[28:42] prophesied by malachi chapter 4 verse 5
[28:47] and so the fire of god
[28:50] fell and began to unfreeze
[28:55] warm up the church bring her
[28:58] back to what she was that
[29:01] fire of god set the
[29:05] church free from the deep freeze of
[29:09] all those ice age denominational
[29:13] spirits that were upon them
[29:17] and thank god the springtime of the
[29:21] church
[29:21] came again oh glory to god i love
[29:24] springtime and so
[29:26] we see springtime came in the church no
[29:29] wonder
[29:30] i was blessed to see the ending of the
[29:34] of that original pentecost and i sure
[29:37] tell you
[29:38] the people love springing about running
[29:41] the isles
[29:42] shouting to god dancing in the spirit
[29:45] anointed by the holy ghost many times
[29:49] we'll see the pure of cloud and fire
[29:52] pass through the ceiling literally
[29:56] brother simon did you read this in a
[29:57] book no
[29:59] i'm telling you about what i have
[30:02] seen with my eyes and experienced
[30:05] by the presence and power of god and the
[30:08] holy spirit and the reality of god in
[30:11] these last days
[30:12] i was blessed and allowed to see the
[30:15] mighty hand of god
[30:17] while the real genuine pentecost not
[30:20] this modern day thing
[30:22] called petticos but the genuine
[30:25] pentecost before just as it
[30:29] one was winding down and the age was
[30:32] petering out
[30:33] and coming to its age let me not talk
[30:36] about that
[30:37] but praise god hallelujah brother sister
[30:42] the church came out of her deep freeze
[30:47] the church began to saw out by the fire
[30:51] the holy ghost and the anointing of the
[30:53] holy
[30:53] spirit and just like natural
[30:57] scientists have in the north
[31:01] in alberta in different countries
[31:04] china parts of africa
[31:08] scientists are have uncovered
[31:12] fish now
[31:15] calcified or in rock form
[31:19] that were caught by the freezing of that
[31:22] time
[31:24] they have even have reported that they
[31:27] are found
[31:28] like a dinosaur or a prehistoric beast
[31:33] with grass in its mouth and because of
[31:36] the ice the grass
[31:37] might have still been literally fresh
[31:40] because
[31:41] of the ice that was over it
[31:44] but frozen like that
[31:49] and in case
[31:52] with ice and some of them
[31:56] with some form some prey some other
[31:59] smaller
[31:59] animals within their jaws
[32:04] at the same time the
[32:08] the very tombs of the pharaohs
[32:11] are being uncovered
[32:14] and being discovered everywhere
[32:18] but friends
[32:21] could it be that a lot of the diseases
[32:26] unknown diseases all manner of
[32:30] viruses all manner of evil sicknesses
[32:34] coming up on the fish could it be the
[32:36] open pandora's box
[32:38] and when they open those tombs they say
[32:41] curse of the pharaoh it's the curse of
[32:44] satan
[32:45] and out of there some of those strange
[32:49] unknown diseases and sicknesses
[32:52] came right out and we're loosed upon the
[32:56] earth again
[32:58] and we may claim we're calling it a new
[33:00] discovery
[33:01] we just discovered the virus we just
[33:04] discovered this new disease
[33:05] we just discovered this new thing over
[33:07] here it was already
[33:10] there and it was
[33:13] frozen no doubt buried and then
[33:16] uncovered or thought out and once again
[33:20] loosed upon the earth and exposed
[33:23] in the entire world upon us
[33:26] amen could it be that that's what it is
[33:31] could it be that's what is
[33:34] happening at this particular time
[33:38] just naturally that happened we know
[33:41] that science tells us that
[33:43] the scientists will tell you that
[33:46] emphatically
[33:47] that that happened and i'm saying to you
[33:50] in the same manner parallel
[33:54] spiritually that the beast-like
[33:58] rebellious
[33:59] spirit of satan
[34:04] cast down from heaven from the
[34:07] prehistoric
[34:10] and pre-adamic ages
[34:14] that time my friends genesis
[34:19] the spirit of that hybrid beast
[34:23] came through the serpent
[34:27] spawning satanic evil
[34:31] by using eve to bring it
[34:34] upon the face of the earth
[34:38] and for a time even to this time
[34:43] many are saying oh there is no devil
[34:45] there is no satan
[34:47] there is really no real evil but you
[34:50] don't
[34:50] understand that wild beast is acting as
[34:54] if he can be a nice pet cat
[34:58] that appears like he is sleeping
[35:01] really he is seeing everything that's
[35:04] going on
[35:06] he is watching for that mouse or that
[35:09] prey
[35:10] to get to that place where he can just
[35:14] move upon it grasp it within
[35:17] his evil claws tries to do as if he's
[35:22] you know he's powerless oh he's an
[35:24] illusion there's no such thing
[35:26] as satan but i believe
[35:31] that this spiritual this
[35:34] spiritual beast
[35:37] not natural as the scientists are
[35:40] finding and uncovering the natural
[35:43] i am taking the word of god to uncover
[35:46] this spirit
[35:47] spiritual prehistoric
[35:50] beast and i say prehistoric
[35:53] because satan is older
[35:56] than man this ancient
[36:00] evil being was there
[36:03] and then casts out oh my friends
[36:08] this prehistoric beast
[36:12] spirit rebellious against god
[36:16] it's called satan some say
[36:19] shayatan but whatever his name
[36:23] it changed from lucifer
[36:26] sun in the morning down to the lord of
[36:29] darkness
[36:31] again he's called in the gospels
[36:34] bielsa bob or better known
[36:38] the ultimate meaning lord of the
[36:41] dung heap lord of the flies
[36:45] flies on a carcass and satan
[36:48] means all of that
[36:52] i believe that with the
[36:55] fire and the power and the life that
[36:57] came out
[36:58] of the ministry of malachi 4
[37:01] 5 the ministry of brother william
[37:05] marion branham that he has released a
[37:10] spiritual
[37:11] warmth and fire of god
[37:14] that has awaken and
[37:18] awaken everything that was dead is
[37:21] starting to come to life again
[37:24] i say to you the beast awakens
[37:28] that's that spirit of that
[37:31] prehistoric spiritual raptor
[37:35] or beast is now
[37:38] in its awakening stages
[37:42] one eye is open the other one is
[37:46] following
[37:47] he's watching and he is about to
[37:50] move up on the face of the world and to
[37:54] take charge of its government its
[37:57] churches
[37:58] its money structures its economics
[38:01] its political areas all of it my friends
[38:05] educational social everything he
[38:08] is seeking to move and to
[38:12] take charge and control over it
[38:15] amen yes sir he knows
[38:20] it's time to fulfill scripture
[38:23] amen you say oh satan is going to
[38:26] fulfill scripture
[38:27] yes just as much as one of the high
[38:30] priest said
[38:30] it is not it's not for all the people
[38:34] shouldn't die
[38:35] but it is good for one man to die for
[38:38] the people
[38:39] and the bible said and he knew not that
[38:41] he prophesied
[38:43] hallelujah he actually spoke what was
[38:46] the word of god
[38:47] and so god many times makes satan does
[38:50] things he wants him to do without him
[38:53] knowing
[38:53] and it's time for certain scriptures
[38:57] to be fulfilled and he knows it
[39:01] because the beast is awakening
[39:05] the spirit of rebellion manifested in
[39:08] the world
[39:09] wars rumors of wars rebellions
[39:12] everywhere
[39:13] fightings my friends within and without
[39:17] is taking place now and he knows
[39:20] it that his time has come
[39:24] to fulfill scriptures
[39:27] like as it was in the days of noah
[39:31] so shall it be in the day when the son
[39:34] of man
[39:35] oh god is being revealed
[39:38] days of noah go to your scriptures
[39:42] read it i will not outline all of that
[39:45] violence marion given in marriage
[39:50] man just living with women
[39:53] women living with men without marriage
[39:55] without the sacred
[39:57] unsanctity of the god's approval and
[40:00] god's blessing
[40:01] it may not work the way you want it to
[40:04] be but
[40:05] that's the pattern god has set within
[40:07] his word
[40:08] we must follow god's sacred pattern
[40:12] so he knows he has to fulfill that
[40:16] as it was in the days of lord of lot
[40:20] the days of sodom with this sodomy
[40:25] with its perversion with its evil
[40:29] witness greed oh my friends

[41:22] amen he is right now in the construction
[41:26] direction

[41:33] gross use and fall
[41:37] and final destruction
[41:40] of mystery babylon
[41:43] the mother of harlots
[41:46] we say harlots
[41:50] amen our daughters
[41:54] just as all these modern day uh
[41:56] denominations
[41:58] have come out of the roman
[42:01] church amen
[42:04] they are her daughters and the bible
[42:07] says
[42:08] just like the mother the children are
[42:11] money loving money hungry with the same
[42:14] spirit that is upon them a order for
[42:17] organization
[42:18] trying to make themselves look beautiful
[42:20] with all manner of painted
[42:22] false fronts all beautiful
[42:26] shaped buildings oh my god
[42:30] just to attract the those who have no
[42:33] understanding a solomon said the young
[42:36] man in the streets
[42:38] just goes with his eyes and doesn't go
[42:40] with any spiritual
[42:41] understanding and chases after
[42:44] such a woman in the doom of his of the
[42:47] twilight
[42:48] in the gloom and in the twilight yes sir
[42:51] amen read revelation chapter 17
[42:54] 18 19 and you will
[42:58] see how this evil wicked
[43:01] beast-like spirit that has been
[43:04] loosed upon the face of the earth and
[43:08] is awakening and has awakened
[43:12] this spirit is beginning to take over
[43:17] in every aspect of society
[43:20] taking over with lies
[43:24] with a a storm of lies
[43:27] taking over receptivity
[43:33] with manipulation with evil in
[43:37] all forms and some of the evil
[43:40] that we are yet to see you have
[43:43] never in your life even imagined it
[43:46] or seen it but it will be evil that took
[43:50] place from
[43:51] the dateless past down through the times
[43:54] of noah
[43:55] right through pharaoh right down through
[43:58] nebuchadnezzar
[43:59] and up on hitler and stalin
[44:02] right to this time an accumulation
[44:08] of those evil spirits
[44:12] in an evil manifestation on the
[44:15] direction of this
[44:16] beast like spirit and nature
[44:20] is awakening upon the face of the earth
[44:25] yes now let me pause here
[44:29] i was watching on the television how
[44:31] that the pope has
[44:32] visited iraq
[44:37] now while there
[44:41] he visit or of the chaldeas
[44:46] which was the beginning of our faith
[44:51] the birthplace of abraham
[44:54] the father of the faithful the father
[44:58] of his faith seed
[45:02] now of course the pope
[45:05] in my eyes seems to be personally
[45:09] a good man
[45:12] a man of the people
[45:15] a man of the downtrodden
[45:21] but you see friends
[45:25] he is i believe this is my
[45:28] my looking at the picture
[45:32] this man with his grand hopes
[45:36] and desires is trying to accomplish
[45:40] great things wonderful things
[45:43] but he's trying to do with it within
[45:47] a system an
[45:51] ancient old system
[45:55] that isn't i believe inspired
[45:58] by this dislike
[46:02] spirit working and
[46:05] using that system
[46:09] to bring about its objectives
[46:12] politically financially spiritually
[46:16] but a faith of religion or whatever
[46:20] is working true this means and not just
[46:24] true
[46:24] that but through every one of these
[46:29] so-called denominations which
[46:32] are just extensions
[46:36] or franchises of the same thing
[46:40] on the different names to the new to
[46:42] divide
[46:43] to to uh uh divert
[46:47] people's attention from what he is
[46:49] trying to accomplish
[46:51] and doing in this time oh my friends
[46:57] the beast awakens
[47:00] the body of the beast awakens
[47:04] the church body of the beast awakens
[47:08] remember in the in the in the gospels
[47:11] jesus said there were ten virgins ten
[47:13] were wise and
[47:14] uh five were wise five were foolish but
[47:18] not this carefully
[47:20] i'm just going to pass over this the
[47:23] bible says the cry went out
[47:25] amen hallelujah behold the bridegroom
[47:30] cometh
[47:31] amen when the cry went out which i
[47:34] believe
[47:35] our brother william marion branham was
[47:38] used of god
[47:39] to capture the world's attention that he
[47:42] could announce to the world
[47:44] its rapture time christ is
[47:47] coming second coming of the lord
[47:51] amen the appearance of the supernatural
[47:55] cloud in the form of the face of christ
[47:58] over uh arizona there my friends
[48:03] we see these things however when the
[48:06] virgins not just the wise
[48:10] all of the virgins heard the cry some
[48:13] went back to sleep they heard william
[48:15] branham he was fanciful
[48:17] he was beautiful marvelous wonderful his
[48:20] message was powerful
[48:21] and they would go to the meetings and
[48:23] clap their hands when they saw the
[48:24] miracles the discernment
[48:26] and so on that was marvelous as soon as
[48:29] he left the
[48:30] scene even some of the believers of this
[48:32] his message falling asleep
[48:36] falling back to sleep
[48:39] amen and then
[48:43] saw those foolish virgins fell
[48:46] right back to sleep after the original
[48:50] sounding of the voice of god
[48:53] in these last days that behold the
[48:56] bridegroom cometh
[48:58] so what has happened during this time
[49:01] god has been dealing
[49:03] with his elect amen
[49:06] his hidden ones his sacred ones
[49:11] oh his surrendered ones
[49:14] his ordained predestinated attributes
[49:18] from before the foundation of the world
[49:20] god has been
[49:22] dealing with them but now
[49:26] as they begin to receive the word and
[49:29] unfold the word
[49:31] now there's a thought going on
[49:35] there's a wart coming again
[49:38] there my friends is
[49:41] unfreezing god is starting to
[49:44] lose his spirit the holy spirit
[49:49] upon the world and everything what was
[49:53] frozen
[49:55] starts to be
[49:58] throwing out and spring is here again
[50:03] the rapture is right at hand glory to
[50:07] god
[50:08] my friends
[50:11] the true elected already awakened
[50:16] and we fight now the foolish virgins
[50:21] are now coming back
[50:24] they might have heard william branham
[50:26] the the first time i heard about him
[50:30] but he caught their attention for a
[50:31] short while they go to sleep
[50:33] but now the foolish virgins
[50:38] are starting to awaken just as much as
[50:41] those
[50:42] be obese natural naturally when
[50:45] uh the on time comes a scientist begins
[50:48] to find them
[50:49] and spiritually when pentecost came
[50:53] the spiritual beast-like nature of satan
[50:57] it woke up and it started to make itself
[51:00] slowly slowly gingerly cat-like
[51:03] stealth manifesting itself
[51:06] once again in the world
[51:11] and so we see many pentecostal preachers
[51:17] pastors ministers who once
[51:20] shunned brother william marion branham
[51:24] who once shunned malachi 4
[51:28] 5 who were frozen by fear
[51:31] who would never utter his name or
[51:34] speak about this ministry that was
[51:38] unmatched from the time of christ
[51:41] amen to this hour it was written
[51:45] somewhere in one of the catholic digests
[51:48] the very ground the man walks on is
[51:51] blessed
[51:52] oh my friend here we find
[51:56] that once again now and he himself spoke
[52:00] it
[52:00] he said what i'm telling you is thus
[52:03] saith the lord
[52:05] one day long after he's gone he
[52:08] spoke about it that the pentecostals
[52:12] he said when you see them turn around
[52:15] and start coming back to this message
[52:18] watch it for the rapture is at hand
[52:21] oh glory to god amen friends
[52:25] so these pentecostal churches and
[52:28] evangelists
[52:31] i won't call their names god bless their
[52:34] hearts
[52:35] because at least some of them have
[52:37] enough spirituality and courage
[52:40] to step out and speak their convictions
[52:44] without fear or favor are not waiting
[52:48] for a handout
[52:49] oh but to stand with god's word and with
[52:53] god's despised view
[52:55] amen and bear the shame and reproach by
[52:59] his glorious
[53:00] and wonderful name yes sir
[53:03] and so they're awakening the signs of
[53:07] prophecy
[53:09] being fulfilled what
[53:12] this is not a fairy tale this is not a
[53:15] myth or a story to be told
[53:18] this is actually the real beauty
[53:21] and the beast this is actually
[53:25] my friends the bride versus
[53:29] the be spirit of satan of which she
[53:33] shall overcome and defeat him
[53:36] with the blood of the lamb
[53:40] the word of our testimony and in the
[53:43] name of jesus christ for the glory of
[53:46] god
[53:47] amen after the chaos
[53:51] of the spiritual of this ice age
[53:56] him the creation of man
[54:01] amen to be lords
[54:06] of the natural creation
[54:09] and now here is it again
[54:12] the toying out of the spiritual ice age
[54:17] god is now putting forth a new creation
[54:21] by the same spoken word that he used
[54:24] in genesis 1 3
[54:27] and god said let
[54:30] there be light another prophet said
[54:34] it shall be light about the evening
[54:38] time the path to glory
[54:41] you will surely find in the waterway
[54:45] is the light today buried in the name of
[54:49] jesus
[54:50] oh my friends once again
[54:54] the new creation is to have dominion
[54:58] over all spiritual things
[55:02] as kings and queens upon the face of the
[55:06] earth
[55:07] and to rule with supernatural authority
[55:11] and spiritual power over all things
[55:17] having authority over every situation
[55:22] i hope you are recognizing what's being
[55:24] said here
[55:25] now and that you are willing and ready
[55:28] to accept him within your heart life
[55:30] and to take your position and control
[55:35] by your face in his word
[55:38] let it be and so it is god said
[55:41] let it be and so it is i hope the sons
[55:45] of god will begin to trust him
[55:47] and to imitate their father and to do
[55:50] the very actions of their father
[55:52] and watch the word of god come to pass
[55:56] in every situation of your life
[55:59] sickness authority over sickness
[56:02] they shall lay their hands on the sick
[56:05] and the
[56:06] sick shall recover amen power over
[56:10] suffering
[56:11] amen power over your grief
[56:14] and your depression god will give you
[56:17] the
[56:18] power the comfort the heart to
[56:21] overcome in the midst of terror and
[56:24] torment
[56:25] god will give you all the life and power
[56:28] that you need even in the midst of death
[56:33] god has given us power and authority
[56:36] amen
[56:37] and he's an eternal life in him where he
[56:40] has said
[56:41] even though that you were you are dead
[56:44] yet
[56:44] shall you live amen for in other words
[56:48] yes you may suffer natural death but
[56:50] you're really
[56:51] not dead for the real you on the inside
[56:54] has eternal life
[56:56] and shall have the fullness because you
[56:59] have come to the fullness
[57:02] of the church ages

[57:33] amen oh praise god hallelujah
[57:38] all my friends let us now by
[57:41] faith then walk out
