TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] once again i'm very happy to be here in the presence of the lord and to fellowship with you in the joy of the lord jesus christ may god bless you real good today and pour out his teaching of his word upon us that we may live as true saints of god in his divine presence god bless you i will now read our scripture of this wonderful marvelous lesson our scripture reading is found in revelation chapter 2 verse 9 i know thy works and the tribulation and poverty but thou art rich and i know thy blasphemy of them which say they are jews and are not but are of this synagogue of satan today i thought this uh in this lesson i'd like to speak on the bitterness of smyrna the bitterness of smyrna that is our lesson for today and when we look at a smyrna itself we know that the uh name or word smyrna derives from the word mur mur which was like the gift one of the gifts given to jesus which it was used in the embalming of the dead it was bitter and so smyrna speaks of bitterness it speaks of the bitterness of the persecution of the church at that time it also speaks of the nickelodeonism which invaded the church in its seed form at that particular time it speaks of the hybriding hybridization of the church of the living god also of the bitterness brought upon the flock of god by human leadership and it speaks also of the bitterness of organization who on its surface seems to bring order and systems and sanity uh but in the end it produces nothing but hatred and bitterness and strife may god help us today as we look into his word and as we look what do we see we see israel coming out of egypt and as they came out just in the same way the early church came out for a true uh redemption has to do with coming out and going in we are speaking about the coming out of israel and the coming out of the church of the living god now when israel left egypt egypt of course which was their land of bondage and servitude and now we see the church in a parallel with israel the church leaving the world and its worldliness and dynamic nationalism their place of servitude bondage to habits bondage to sin and self and the servitude to satan so when israel left egypt they left under the supernatural leadership of god god represented by the pillar of fire in the above them and his prophet moses among them but they were under supernatural leadership god was their leader and their sovereign guide also we see friends that he was their king he was there everything that fed them led them protected them took care of them in every possible way and so is it with the early church when they came out from their various phariseesism sadduceeism uh from amongst epicureans the stoics and so on and separated themselves to god there were led by the presence of the holy spirit under the anointing of men with signs wonders and miracles they were under supernatural leadership of the great holy spirit once israel got out of their bondage and began to look around at that time looking at the other nations around them whether it's the philistines more bites amorites whoever they were at that particular time they saw that those nations were under a superintendent a king of some sort some kind of a leader like that that could lead them to war and say so they love the thought of having a visible human leadership rather than trusting and having faith in the supernatural leadership of god through the means of revelation through his prophet then no more wanted to be led by that supernatural leadership they wanted a human leadership one king sitting in a palace somewhere sitting in some in our modern times in some major city with the power and influence to influence thousands yeah even millions taking on a kingship over them and the people love to have it so now little did they know god already had a plan to humanize his leadership and that would be in the form of jesus christ for of course jesus christ is god come down from above them and now to become emmanuel god among them to walk with them god above them god with them to mingle among them and to understand and to know his people in a personal way but of course you know satan knew about this plan of god the plan was given since genesis 3 18 how that the seed of the woman would bruise the serpent's head and satan knew of the humanizing of this leadership but it would be done by god's way and so as evermore he loves to run ahead leap ahead of god and try to pervert the understanding meaning and manifestation of that leadership and so he put it in the hearts of the people he suggested it into the hearts of the people until they thought it was their own thought meanwhile it was his seed that perverted seed that was planted in their hearts to begin to request a human leadership ahead of the plan of god that had already planned to give them a human leadership in the form of jesus christ they approached samuel who uh a prophet later on there they approached samuel and put it to him that they wanted a king samuel was dismayed he was overwhelmed with the thought that they did not have a clear understanding of who was really leading them that it was not him as a human that was leading them but they were led by god the great jehovah spirit leading israel his people from victory onto victory god had gathered them called them out from amongst the nations god pleaded with them to stay with him to follow him he is one god and he does not change nor does not lie he carried his children through the wilderness he prospered them when they came out he blessed them every in every possible way and now they had arrived at this uh conclusion that they wanted to have some kind of a human king of course they said to samuel uh we know and appreciate that you have done your best to keep us lined up with the word and we appreciate it we also appreciate the mighty miracles we appreciate the wisdom the supernatural provision and supply we appreciate god's protection over us in every way and we believe all of it we believe it we believe and we receive it in every way we like it we love it but we still want to have a king to lead us in battle in other words samuel well we will keep all the religious require god's religious requirements uh and uh everything demanded by god's word but we we still love to have a a king like the other nations today the church will say like the other denominations uh we want to have a superintendent we want to have a a chief presbyter or we we want to have you know uh somebody to guide us and lead us uh to be above us we want to have a world leader that will be able to lead us and point us and going before us in war and in peace time oh oh samuel we don't intend to stop any of our a religious uh you know requirements traditions and beliefs that were handed down to us we're going to upkeep that but we are going to we require a king see they were going ahead of god they were stepping out of god's plan they did not come to ask samuel or require of samuel what does god want us to do they did not say well this is what we want but samuel well we we need to hear what is the will of god from you they came to request this but actually they came to tell him what they wanted and put it over or worded it in the way of a request but it was actually telling him what was in their heart and what they really desired and wanted so they wanted that king who could lead them and samuel of course being a true prophet of god realized that they uh were rejecting him little did they know that his sorrow was not over his rejection but because he knew he represented god and that by rejecting him they were rejecting the leadership of god the supernatural leadership now we're talking about invisible leadership and desire for visible leadership and here we see it my friends right before them amen hallelujah god true his word required that his people would be different and he ordained that they would act different and live differently than the world that was on the inside outside because you see real people of god are not of the world they are not of egypt they're not of the denomination they don't look like the world they don't dress like the world they don't act like the world their nature and manner is not like the world in fact the bible tells us they are crucified from the world and their affections are upon the things above and the things of the living god second corinthians 6 17-18 wherefore come out from amongst them and be he separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you and will be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty oh praise god hallelujah so the difference between israel and the other nations was their god that was in the midst of them israel of itself without god the nations had no fear for them but what the nations feared was israel's god who was amongst them so if you put god to the side israel was like every other nation when samson that mighty man as we read in the bible had his hair cut off from him he was like any other man at that time and when the church puts aside the invisible supernatural leadership of the holy spirit bringing revelation to his people teaching his people leading them by the means of supernatural revelation of which jesus said upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it the church without that supernatural leadership is nothing but the world an infestation of worldliness with the label of the name of christian or of god upon it never mind whatever name they want to take on or we would want to take on if we are not uh filled led guided by the supernatural leadership of the holy spirit we are just my friends a gathering of religious people under the day and captivated by worthiness and denominationalism your inaudible but you operate like one your systems are like one you you act like them you move like them and so you you go into the same attitude and that my friend is nothing but a church that is just like every other church where there's a oh i'm in the message oh i believe the message but you act like them systematically organizationally you move like them and then what happens it's nothing but a religious group with the name of of the of god upon it or christian upon it or message upon it but it's nothing my friends but a a bug of worthiness it's a bug of egyptian evil and satanic seductions and evil that has come upon the people and captured their minds and hearts listen to the word of god the world and the church are really of the same lump just as jacob and esau were from the same mother from the same womb same parents amen but the spirit of god made the difference in one of them while in the other even though he looked like a gentleman acted like a gentleman moved like a gentleman yet he was inspired by the devil while the other one that looked as if he was a rascal in the renegade was led by the mighty hand of god and i'm putting it to you that that is what the happened like in heaven when the leadership of god seemed to satan's organized systematic ah a mind looked and saw how the weather how this moves that moved everything moved and uh it didn't seem like there was a proper order organization and systems to it and he felt he could do a better job than the most high god and so god kicked him out my friends it seems the same way in this world nature seems to be set up in such a way that when we look upon it it looks as if it's in disorder it's only with a closer look that we realize that there is order what seems like chaos at pentecost what seems like chaos in a real heaven set godsent revival my friends what seems as if it's ignorant what seems as if it's not wise god is in the midst of it and he provides an order that is above the order and organization of the minds of men we look here friends without the spirit of god we're nothing but reprobates without the spirit of god giving us revelation we cannot be truly born again and we are none of his without that spirit of god upon us for he that had an ear to hear let him hear for faith cometh by hearing and hearing come and hearing comes out of the word of god from the word of god amen hallelujah well most people when asked if they're christian their automatic reflex answer is to say well of course i'm a metadata oh well of course i'm a baptist well of course i'm a roman catholic well of course i'm a pentecostal well of course i am i am this or i am that whatsoever it is they're gonna say but my friends that has nothing to do with the new birth it's the holy ghost and power that is keeping us alive it is the holy ghost in you it's the token in you it's the gene of god in you it's the choosing of god or perish amen praise god christ in you or chaos around you and in you and in every possible way praise god let's go back to the early church and see what they had how they started out with signs wonders and miracles and with the power and presence of god their focus was what not the saints ones and miracles but the multiplication of the word of god and the dispersion of the truth of their word of god and those signs just followed them and took place because they were interested and motivated by the spread of the light of the word of god at that particular time amen and so as the believers of these church ages john had gone on polycarp paul these mighty men and other apostles and disciples that were also there anointed by the holy spirit gone on they became history they became after hundreds of years myths stories that could be tall about their miracles their wonders the truths they espoused it became stories to the other generations told to them by other men but they knew nothing about it except what they were being told and satan then was able to slip over the leadership of the holy spirit and placed it and humanized it in man god of course uses man to express himself but it is god making himself known through those men we will touch on that at another time but here it is they'll say i'll burn a candle every day or i'm this right that all right dudes in her venus that makes me a christian my friends not by works of righteousness which we have done but by his grace by his mercy that he has called us and saved us unto himself now the disciples of the early church hundreds of years down the line began to thinking and reasoning of how they could improve just like satan did you know how they could improve on what god has already done the blueprint the pattern that was set in the early church of accept of the book of acts they began to think how they could improve on what god has done not really realizing that they were now entering into perversion they were now entering into rebellion they were entering into disobedience they were entering into backsliding and wandering away from the original truth of god's holy word oh my then the deeds and of the nickelodeons began to rear up its head as a young serpent just a tiny little serpent doesn't look deadly as yet but it begins to raise its head up then we understand they formed their group and began to drift away from the word pattern or the blueprint as i've said that god had already set in his word in this book of acts my friends that's the way it always is just a little levin livens the entire whole lump now this satan inspired group formed itself together and began to hit and fight the true believers of that day for the contrast of the true believers would was a form of exposure of them it it showed them up it reflected on them so get rid of the competition get rid of these reflectors and you will stand alone and then your lie will begin to be believed as the truth this was their objective and they began to insist that they the nicolaitans these religious aliens these ones who appear to be so sanctimoniously holy these ones who appeared so consecrated and dedicated they began to claim originality and that they were the only true church of god at that time and had the rights to persecute destroy and tear down the people and things of god in that age oh my friends the bitterness of smyrna how bitter it was because as their form themselves organized themselves their organization bred hatred organization breaks fellowship for organization is a separator it separate themselves separate this church with this name from this church with this name until each groups are our people our people this our people that it's separate from one another and creates an atmosphere of spiritual bitterness and fighting and that is what mar means that is what it's all about bitterness the root seed and root of bitterness that defiles the hearts of many and the filement was surely coming in a greater and greater form and every other age from then to now would feel the scars and wounds that came from the bitterness that flowed out of smyrna of course the church at smyrna drifted far away from the original faith of the word of god and it became a hybrid as i said before bitterness a smyrna one of its bitterness nicolasianism another high breeding hybridization of the church of god as it was in the beginning so is it at the end when eve hybridized herself with a beast in the form of the serpent that looked like a man but it was really an animal in nature and brought high breeding which is the crossing of species i'm not talking about different uh nationalities of human beings i'm talking about the crossing of species now here we find france that she hybridized these great that the two species of human and animal human and beast and produce nothing but cain a mongrel a rebel to the word of the living god brought forth a creature in the garden of eden a monster kane a murderer kane a liar kane a hater who hated his brother kane she brought forth a mongrel a bastard born in the garden of eden he was not pure human he was a mingling of the seed of human and beast and the product therefore my friend as the bible tells us in first john king who was of the wicked one who slew or murdered his brother abel that spirit is still alive today it's dressed up it's beautiful like a snake its altars are beautiful prominent oh my friends but it still has the heart and soul of a killer and a murderer of its own brethren called christians oh look to the word notice from the day they were born how different they were came from abel one moved by the revelation of the holy spirit hebrews 11 where it tells you he abel uh presented or provided a better sacrifice than his brother cain why one was by revelation the other one was my guessing presumption and profession professing he did not know what to offer so he did what was right in his own eyes but he did not know what was right in god's eyes but by faith abell offered a better sacrifice different in nature he hated god he would not obey god disobedient to the word rebellious persecuted and killed his righteous brother and always had this attitude that he knew more than god or he could improve on god's altar god's way of worship god's sacrifice and always satan always has that attitude that he is not an originator a creator he has to take something god already has and then pervert it change it a little and then claim ownership of it claim originality claim that he's the one that invented or made it meanwhile that's a spirit his spirit that devilish spirit making such a claim oh my friends the church then devolved debalt into a hybrid state and become as hybrid as hybrid could be where they're comfortable and saying i'm uh i'm this or i'm this church i go to that denomination i go to the other denomination when we know there is only one name given on the heaven whereby we must be saved but now we have three thousand thousands of various names which people marry and attach themselves to and they become adulteress to the word of god now come friends we look to the word the life that is in them brings forth people that they claim to be christians just as cain claimed that cain was of the lord when she knew in our heart he was not he was of his father the devil for he was a liar from the beginning so in the same way they bring forth children from the seed that they have received that is not of god religious but not of god cain was religious but not of god and you'll find that parallel in truth right through the bible and true history religious but not of god and here we find it my friends they act like their particular denomination you can distinguish certain denominational traits within the people for every kind every seed will bring forth after its kind so we see that but not one of them is known for the supernatural revelation of the holy spirit amongst them they're known for their intellectuality they're known for their scholarship they are known and renowned for their schools of higher learning they are known my friends for their great ceremonial worship of god by their church creeds and their laid out dogmas and litanies they are known by that but they are not known for that supernatural ingredient to come in the midst and move things out of their order and into god's order and god's way of doing things to them that will be obscene to them that would be out of order and they'll get you or anyone with that kind of inspiration right out of there as fast as they can because you're disrupting what they as man have set up for so many hundred years and now you have come to bring a disruption talk about eye breathing talk about being a hybrid oh my god friends the most famous animal to be a hybrid is a mule and the mule of course if i might just mention quickly the qualities of a mule the mew can't reproduce himself he has no seed of his own the mule at the same time can outwork a horse or even a donkey he can outwork them you talk about doing church work they'll make you look lame they can outwork you in every way mentally physically they'll outwork you with all kinds of church work and social work and this and that they they're they're able to outwork you but they are an uh contrary to nature contrary and they have a contrary nature that is what they may look normal on the outside but they are of a contrary nature or a nature contrary to the word of god they're also known to be stubborn they hold on to something and they decide they're not going to move the word of god can tell them come out from amongst them my people be not partakers of their sins and their plagues and they say oh no i was born this or that and i'm not going to move and their stubborn spirit and they'll die right there and grow my friends to their destruction or praise god another thing with the mule the qualities of immune you can't trust a mule because the moment you turn your back that mule will bite you that mule will kick you that mule will do anything to get you out of whack whatsoever my friends or if there ever is a truth it's that truth that we are surrounded by hybrid religion the church has been taken over with the high breathing mixing the world into the church mixing satan with his seduction and his charm the appearance of the worship the appearance of the alder the appearance whatsoever they're using all manner of of physical mental olifactory kinds of things using the five senses of the mind and body to attract people rather than letting the great magnet of the holy spirit be the main attraction for it is not by might nor by power but by my spirit said the lord oh yes oh yeah i've got to have the holy spirit but along with the holy spirit we need these programs we need that we have the holy spirit but along with the holy spirit we need robert's rules of order oh yes we need the holy spirit but along with that we need these advertisements we need this you know propaganda and promotions we need this my friends we need god in our hearts we need god leading us and guiding us in every possible way amen praise the name of the lord we should not flirt with the world we should not conform with the world but we should allow ourselves to be transformed by the holy spirit transformed by the power of god i'll speak about this when we continue our study but we must allow ourselves to be molded by the potter's hand guided by the great shepherd of the sheepfold and led by him until we cross over into the promised land may the great holy spirit lead you guide you bless you may he open the eyes of your heart to recognize what i am saying i know while i'm speaking on these topics and subjects many will say oh i've heard that before oh i've read that before i've listened this before oh oh oh my friends others will look and listen and say oh that's nonsense i i don't understand it oh he doesn't sound very slick and smooth and photogenic or uh you know that kind of a systematic presentation uh i can't listen to that all friends don't you understand that god hides himself behind such things hides himself behind men that lived in caves man with rough beards man that going to the wilderness in the desert and appears like they never had a bath in in six months and then they came out saying thus sayeth the lord and the elder man was nothing but a disguise so that god could reflect himself and when we do not recognize that is when my friends we wander away and drift away into the things of the world and the things of churchiness rather than into the things of the revelation revelatory moving of the holy spirit by the opening of the word may god help us may god bless you today my friends and will come together next time around this bread of life to feast our souls upon him whom we love and believe now and forevermore god bless you real good [Music] you
