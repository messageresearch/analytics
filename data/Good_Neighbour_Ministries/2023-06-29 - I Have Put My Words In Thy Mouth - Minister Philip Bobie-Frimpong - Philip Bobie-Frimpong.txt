[Music] did not do it in the first place it's just the flesh but you are Justified when we come to church the only couple reasons that we came that God to help us to overcome things that we make mistakes and to dress closer to him so when we come here we have that confidence that he's here that's what I say where two or three I gathered in your name I'll be in your midst and if you know that we're coming here to commune with God then if who was to be more reverence and also to Cast Away all everything that happened in the daytime because it's a midweek we've been working and some people might have stepped our toes and everything but we have to cast everything out so that God could be a blessing to us because we are not here to listen to see your mind you came here to hear from God Amen so if you have that mentality you'll be blessed amen because if you want to look at there's nothing that I can do I can't do anything but he that makes the difference okay so we can place it now and without wasting much time so I can read my scriptures to have three scriptures yeah and second Corinthians chapter 12 verse 9 and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I write that glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me and therefore I take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in Necessities in persecutions in distress for Christ's sake for when I am weak then I am strong Jeremiah 1 1-9 Jeremiah chapter 1 verse 1 to 9. the words of Jeremiah the son of hilkai of the priests that were anal thought in the land of Benjamin to whom the word of the Lord came in the days of Joseph the son of Amon king of Judah in the 13th year of his reign it came also in the days of Joachim the son of Joseph king of Judah unto the end of the 11th year of zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month then the word of the Lord came unto me saying before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou came as fought out of the womb I Sanctified thee and I or then be a prophet unto the Nations then said die I ah Lord God behold I cannot speak for I Am a Child but the law said unto me say not I'm a child for Thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee and whatsoever I command thee thou shall speak be not afraid of their faces for I am with you to deliver thee said the Lord then the Lord put forth his hand and touched my mouth and the Lord said unto me behold I have put my words in thy mouth that is my my topic or my my title started I have put my words in thy mouth and then in Mark 11 23 24 Mark 11 23 24. for very I told you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he said therefore as soon to you whatsoever things is that when you pray believe that you receive with them and you shall have them let's pray oh I get a Heavenly most gracious Eternal God we are so grateful time for that you have made a way for us to be here tonight Lord search our heart don't leave mine out if you have done anything during the day forgive us oh God may you come once more and speak to your children as you did in the cool of the evening and spoke to Adam the same God we believe you are here because your word cleanse there's way too or throughout guided in your name you will be in our midst so many times we speak that will get help get ourselves out of the way Lord but tonight we mean it from the depth of our heart not just the words that father you take us aside and be able to flow through and bless your children it's just means so real to me father and I I just pray that I don't want to be project myself here but may your spirit project and bless your children tonight you come against any contrary Spirit may the great Holy Ghost have remnants and come and bless your children amen please be seated of his um I'm just gonna read this here perfect strength by Perfect weakness by Reverend William Myron Brown paragraph 56-57 it says the important thing one of the important things that we must master now remember this and especially the young you young preachers and lay members alike there's one thing that we've got to master if we expect to fulfill God's desire in our life if you want to fulfill Gods is there in our life we must fulfill this that is you have to master the thought of human ability if we ever get to a spot where we think that we can do it with our own intelligence and our own abilities we've got to master that in such a way that we can get rid of the thing and made aside so that God can use us that is right and make a complete surrender we cannot use one ability we've got to make a complete surrender and to come to God you've got to surrender to him both so body and spirits everything that you are has to be surrendered to God in order that he can work his will in you and in me amen so what a scripture is trying to tell us that we have to get ourselves out of the way you have to get to the place that we will surrender to God that we ourselves have no ability to do anything that God was the one that gone out flow through us and do whatever he wants to do and if you check the scriptures that we read in the Old Testament the New Testament anyone that God was ever used was the people who took who was able to take their personal ability away and let God control them they got to a place that they know that they cannot do anything then God come on the scene and use the people so unless the bride of Christ will get to a place and fully surrounded and we can say how much you want but if we have any human elements in anything that representing the people is going to be you doing it and God will not be glorified in it so when you read about Jeremiah it says in Jeremiah chapter 1 that he said that Jeremy because what is happening is that if you look at this place nobody's flesh is perfect iniquity so that flesh is always enemy to God so when you look at the flesh you say you cannot do nothing so I believe that happened to Jeremiah and the rest he God said I'm gonna use to he said I am a child he's looking at his position as a child he can't do anything then God has to bring to his memory and tell him that before you were born I knew you I sanctify you and I made you a prophet because Jeremiah got to a place that he realized he cannot do it so once he recognized that God has to come to the sin and use him because it takes those who think they are nothing and somebody gets into them and they make something good out from them but when you think that you know everything you are all you know nobody even can talk to you then God cannot use you amen so when you talk about Prophet it's not those theologians Prophet we always have true prophets and the false prophets and then they have the school of what prophets in the time of Elijah or in the Bible States they are all over there but a true Prophet is born a prophet he doesn't come here before he become a prophet he was he's born a prophet he's different from the spirit of Prophecy so a prophet is born a prophet and when I say that I remember in about I forgot the year maybe 10 15 years ago about 10 years ago a friend of mine at school he was very he's in the UK and it's very um Wordly so one time I was watching something told me to talk to him he's one of God's children so I call him and I began to talk to him through you get connection to the face because at that time all my friends everybody like didn't want to have nothing to do with me because of what I was projecting to them understanding said that I'll give you you got one person and when that thought came I went to Facebook reconnect and it's like hand to the gloves he received everything that I told him then he went to the church got baptized and his life was changed so his uncle in the U.S heard about it talking to him he saw there have been a change in his nephew so he wanted to also know about why he got a change so he told him about me so I said okay U.S is not fair so we're gonna go and visit your uncle in Virginia so I told Brad coffee and you rented a hotel boom you went to Virginia when went there the man wife we didn't know before she was like a pharmacist but her pharmacist that research she goes to China all over the place to make research in pharmaceutical Department and then to cut everything short we began to speak we talk about the word of God and when we finish the lady said that everything we said she believed it Barbara coffee said that our sisters don't wear an earring so she said that part she rejected it is false and try to show her in the Bible she can't get it so instead forget it you are not here to argue with you we came here to help your husband and we are not even telling him to take it out because it's just a question that came in for you to know what we stand for but anything done without faith or Revelation is sin so don't worry about even if you're supposed to come to our church we're not telling you that don't come with it come the way you are let God deal with your heart and God will change you so we spoke like that fashion you forget about it and then around 12 o'clock she prepared coffee and tea for us to drink so like me and coffee sitting like somewhere like here and she was sitting like a place like this whilst we are enjoying our coffee and our tea all that we had she began to scream Queen took that thing off she said now I'm free because I said that there was a pain or I never seen that in my life and then why I'm saying this is that we went back to a hotel we came back the following day and the lady research spent the whole night to read about brother William Aaron Brown and then she testify of her own mouth that brother the prophet is not just ordinary Prophet we're talking about in the world he came with his gift he was born a prophet William was born a true genuine Prophet from the lips of The Sinner was the church people the clergy are denying the prophet I denying the message here we are with a wealthy person haven't heard about it in his life in their lifetime but one night we just experienced that she witnessed she researched and she called it that he was born a prophet so before we have false prophets they have to be a genuine prophet and we are privileged that God that is Grace has let us recognize the prophet for our age because so many people don't have a clue what is going on they try to go by their own intellect they try to interpret their bubble themselves which God has given them the authority to interpret and they are killing their people with their false Doctrine but here we are by the grace of God has led us to the true word for our day and we have the grace elsewhere to live it to believe that word and what's what to live it for present day of his ministry so we are blessed and we are privileged so we shouldn't take it for what granted amen so back to my main topic when God called His prophets call those people if like someone like Moses because I'm talking about the weaknesses of the those people Jeremiah was complaining about being a child when they talk about Moses he was the most uh what do I say the intellectual the highest person in his day even though he was born a prophet but he was in Pharaoh's um he was in pharaohs Pharaoh's home so he was brought up to be the next Pharaoh like the next U.S president over here so to be trained to that they grew me with wedding intellectual so he was full of intellect could train the Egyptians and to everything and Moses thought that with all his military experience he can do the work and when he tried to do it by himself he Faith miserably that shows you and me that not by power or by might but by my spirit says the Lord Moses couldn't achieve anything with all his military his military intelligence and God got rid of everything that Moses have learned when he went to Jethro's place and I believe that God really deal with his prophet he became so down to earth that even after he met God in the form of the pillar of fire he still started talking about his weaknesses instead of complained to God oh he said I I don't have any message to give to them that's the written a richness about seven of them I like Authority I cannot speak eloquently eloquence I cannot be adapted I won't be successful I will not be accepted oh how does what excuses because God has got rid of all his human part all his ability out he has taken everything from him so with his flesh here and he his men might be thinking that even when I have all that military I couldn't do nothing what can I do now I can't do nothing Lord and he began to give excuse by God was angry with him if you read I think that's not 4 14 God was angry with Moses for complaining everything he said who made your mouth who made you this I am sending you I am going to make you a God and here I'm Gonna Be Your Prophet I'll put my rest in your mouth I will talk through you amen and then his confidence that will become towards come back because like in Amnesia God has what say all those things to let him walk and wake up and God used him mightily why because God was yours prisoner the word of God he surrendered his soul his mind everything for the word of God so when Moses is speaking it wasn't Moses anymore it was God in Moses that's why it wasn't Moses who did all the Miracles it was God that did the Miracles it was no brother Abraham that was doing all those things telling you come from me I did this and it was God in the prophet and that same God is here tonight if you are willing to surrender your heart to your soul body mind to this living God he's gonna use you mightily that you even what I wonder you will still have to astonish you what God can do through you when you get to that place that you realize that you truly not just by mouth that you don't have ability to do anything anymore but God come and live your life through me genuinely from your heart you see the power of God in your life that same God is here amen so Moses God used him mightily and then when we come to another um person that we read about Paul another intellectual person he was also used of God but before God who used Paul he has to knock away everything he learned from gamelia he knocked him out from his High house and with all the gift that Paul's had when he said that in the perfect weakness when he had infirmity on him he saw God three times take this thing from me and God will not take it from him he said that my grace is sufficient he said that Lord let me what our Glory my infirmities because God used that the world abandons of Grace to let him work calm down so what I'm saying tonight if you have some issues something that you're dealing with and you prayed and you're not getting an answer or God is telling wait you got to have patience at the right time he will come to the scene and do it don't force God you can't false God's hands shall not the just of the FG right everything that comes to your way has a purpose sometimes because we are in this place we see through US exactly but when you go over there we see it more word clearly so whatever goes in your life you have to Just Surrender it to God he will take care of it and God and Paul got to a place that God knock away everything from him and when it got that place of that weaknesses the people around him Demas Demas and all the rest forsake forsook Him just like bro Abraham come to the end of his ministry they were all forsaking him but that's when God was crowning his ministry amen so when they are forsaken you don't worry if you know you are in line with God's word if you know in your heart you are doing the right thing don't worry about the people forsaking you don't worry about what people are saying you just keep on doing it maybe it's your crowning time and power was so much with God he didn't care about anything even in prison went he was being beaten and were changed and everything he said death where is your stink great where is your Victory he wasn't scared of they wasn't scared of anything that's when God used him mightily because God once surrounded vessel tonight you want people who would take their self out will take away all the abilities that they have and let God have his way in their life and he's gonna flow through you he's gonna do a mighty work through you if you can get to that place deep in your heart not just talking about it and get yourself out of the way God will do Mighty rest through you he causes the same yesterday and forever and Paul who said I had not come to you with what enticing words or what God's wisdom of men because he has the highest form of Education but he took all that as I come to you in the power and demonstration of those who so that you can see Christ to praise Christ he didn't come to preach himself he didn't depend on his education he didn't depends on his knowledge he depends on the revelation of the word of God Amen praise God another person that also God dealt with him was Isaiah Isaiah was looking up to what uziah the way uziah was brought up a king from eight years and he was a perfect King God doesn't want us to have anybody as our Idol if you put anybody in place of you no matter how holy you see that person is no matter how you see how God is using that person God shared not his glory with anybody so when Isaiah began to look to uziah God has to take uziah from the sin and I believe that he shook Isaiah to his bones so he has to go to his knees and cry to God for himself he has to seek God with desperation and when you see God with Desperate Heart he will answer and when he saw god with that desperation he saw seraphims and angels and I believe that Isaiah was so beaten down with his own abilities that when the Angels come said that I'm a man of unclean lips I live among unclean people he didn't glorify anything of the flesh he got to that place that he realized he cannot do nothing he's unclean mother prophet in the presence of the Angels he said I'm an unclean person I live among the cliff people then that angel put a call of fire on his mouth and touched him and then he became clean as clean can be then he was ready for the work amen because at that time all his intellect all everything that as I was not looking at anybody anymore it was Christ Alone it was Jesus alone that he was glorified so the glory blessed was going to God again it wasn't more there was no shifting in his priority there was no shifting to uzal to anybody he was looking straight to Jesus Look Away to Jesus he alone can help you he alone can take your burden nobody on this head can help in one of us only Jesus when you get to a place sometimes all hopes is gone only Jesus can help you don't look at the personalities how big they are how they are it doesn't mean nothing that's God told our pastor gave us an example that one day he was worried and the voice told him who is your boss is that the boss here or I'm your boss he God is your boss he's over robbers he can turn directly bus around and change every situation so don't look to anybody don't look at how Mighty they are don't look at how rich they are not look at everybody look to Jesus respect them give them their their thing that they deserve it your eyes is on Christ because we can't depend on anybody that man here your your time is just a flower it just feels like nothing you just hear like a floor you go you are here today you go tomorrow so our eyes should be on Jesus alone and if you let anything become my idol God will take it away from you if you depend on that's what even when God bless Abraham with Isaac I think maybe Abraham became attached to Isaac and the very thing that he prayed for God told him to deliver to it but because Abraham wasn't looking at looking at the promise and have confidence that God that gave him the Isaac can also raise the map he didn't become a problem for him because where the problem is some people when God blessed them with money or bless them with anything they become attached to the person then they forget about the God who gave it to them so God doesn't want us to become attached to anything if you are his son or daughter if you let your job or anything comes between God will take that thing away from you because he has to begin the priority sacrifice the kingdom of God and his righteousness all other things shall be added unto it when you say pay your thighs you pay it don't look at your conditions don't trust oh man my branches this my this is this how am I gonna make it just have confidence in God because for example my words shall not come out void unless I accomplish what it was sent for he said that bring this side to my house and see test me I will open Windows of heaven and I will bless you if God has spoken and not be saying it God spoke it and he will take care of you it doesn't matter how how sometimes you look dark he will make a way where it seems to be no way so let's stress God if you love God your best Commandments you do whatever he tells you no matter how impossible is steam in your eyes do what God is asking you to do amen praise God Hallelujah so what am I saying back to Isaiah when the call of fire when the Lord touches math then he said that who will go for me who will I send he said here my Lord send me just like the woman in the world when the Lord revealed himself to her citizens keep it to yourself she told others Christianity used to live for others Christian is to do things for others amen and like Philip he told Nathaniel about what he said he said brother Philip he said cleaning time I know it's a cleaning time but we still have to witness because you don't know when the last one is coming who that last one is we have to do our job no I preached for 120 years he did not get anybody but he still preached anyway amen so we have to do our part and witness and just do whatever we can because millions in sin and shame are dying people are dying left and right without God you see the life of the people sometimes you cry in your heart some are deceived by false doctrines you talk to them you cry for them and they've been so blinded and they can't see their way out by the grace of God let's live the life let's share the light the word let's God have remnants in his own time he will do it once we are not dependent on our own abilities he will take care of the business amen Hallelujah and one other individual that will talk to his Gideon Gideon also God told him you are a Mighty Man Of Violence he said me have the least among my my brethren I'm poor how do I became a mighty man of Valor Valor whatever it is God was trying to let him know who he is he's a son of the Living God was not looking at his Earthly condition that's why the word of God is coming forth every day to remind us who we are who I am I am a part of what my savior I'm a part of his word amen he's always constantly letting us to know who we are amen I'm a I'm who I am who am I I can see now who I am I a part of my savior a part of his word it's a revelation amen or glorious victory that day he set me free he made my heart his very Throne my life is no longer what mine just like Paul and Paul and Moses were prisoner of Christ so the true bride of Christ we are prisoner the word of God realize life is no longer always amen we are prisoner of love divine and now we lived what to praise our God Amen on Calvary he died to redeem his last bride we are lost and on time The God Who created the whole universe the mighty of the Mighty the almighty God he left his son above and became like one of his so if you want to be high you have to humble yourself he came left all his glory above to come to this thinking here to be to the redeemers so the highest of all became the lowest of all and the true servant of God you are the servant of the people God came to service so the way up is the way down is that result himself will be brought down who humble himself and raise them up so no don't don't be proud just be simple and love the people don't look down for anyone like John Wesley said he saw that bomb here was I by the grace of God and I recently some people that I know before maybe 10 12 years when I told them I used to drink I used to smoke they said one was no feeling if you have not told me how not I believe it why by the grace of God I will have still be in that thinking life I would have been in that stupid life I would have been move around with no hope but God grace came to me and he has changed me from the inside out that the people cannot even see a Trace of a drunkard that my dust after having to step on me when I got drunk from my friends like they carry me like that by the grace of God has brought me that's far and people cannot even see a trace of that it's my ability no is God that has done it so we have to give him praise and ties and don't look down upon anybody let's have compassion for the people the Lord Jesus Christ look upon them he has compassion on them and like Abraham he intercedes for lot knowing that even Lord has done wrong as wrong can be his thing tested for them let's Interstate for our family interested for our children intercede for our family our friends no matter what they have done let God's love project When Love projects Grace takes over bless intestine let's love the people amen what am I saying God let Gideon know who he was that is not just an ordinary person his eternal being trapped in on this Earth so what is this that he is going back to what eternal life whatever he said Eternal being trapped on this flesh is that right so um the rest is not coming I know what I'm trying to say so um he's it is eternal being that has been trapped on what on this flesh for a season so he has to let him wake up and give all those words of encouragement that's why God always speaking to us the word coming false from the tape from the preaching everywhere for us to recognize exactly who you are when you fully recognize who you are it changes your Dynamics it changes everything about you oh perhaps someone is talking about Queen George when he was going to war he was trying to turn back and that one of his generals said that remember who you are you are King George and then he remembered that he came back and fought and got that Victory so we have to remember who you are you are a son of God you are not ordinary person you have God's DNA in you you have the spirit of Christ in you amen so don't look down upon yourself remember he's in you he has to remind them no wonder Abraham said when that true bride of fry recognize who she is fully she'll be an invisible Army amen is going on now there is no another age this is the time there is no future by the coming of Christ you are the last generation there is not going to be any Generation all the prophecy has been fulfilled and is fulfilling in our eyes we used to say this is coming that is coming that is coming but now can say this is yeah that is yeah this is yeah amen so God is united with his bride that's why Daniel saying it's uniting time as the devil is united with his churches with World Council of churches God is what's United with his with his bride full unification amen he's the same yesterday to them forever he will never lose none of his children said I have done me the palm of my hand no one can plug them out from my head amen no one comes the father except the father calls him first you are Son of God you are a daughter of the Living God the spirit of God dwelleth inside of you amen John looked out for yourself just like the black slave even though he was a slaving you I said say remember who is yours he's the son of the king remember that you are a son of the king not a king the King Jesus amen so walk like that to your chest up no matter what you're going through you have to walk with your Chester because God is in control amen he will never leave you nor forsake you amen praise our God thank you Jesus amen Hallelujah praise our wonderful God Amen Hallelujah what am I saying so when God is saying that he has his word in your mouth if God have that word in your mouth what do you have to do when you are met with the situation and you are in the will of God you got to speak and go for it listen I was pleased with one brother and you are talking about it he said that you said what step up serpents they will not harm you they will not do this if that means that you're gonna be foolishly go and step on steppers or doing that then when you are in the post of Duty you are in line of duty and that thing happened God Will Take Care of Business amen so Moses being a prophet of God did so much through him but when he gets a place he himself said I was bothering him they said that it's better we go back we told you why do you bring us here to destroy us and His prophets I said this Egyptian you see you will see them no more then he began to cry Lord what should I do and God said why cry to me Moses speak and go forward and then when you speak the 10 words divided into two and they walk through and that I don't understand them but they blinded anyway how can this divided and the people are working and you guys you should have ran for your life and they were being so foolish that were still following them but I believe it has to let God's glories be shown and all those listen the word perish in that why because Moses spoke in the line of duty and Joshua I believe that he was the left hand of of Moses the right-hand man of Moses they had he saw everything that happened and Joshua types the Holy Ghost so in the time of Joshua when Joshua made the same situation Joshua didn't cried he recognized that God has given me promise and God have told him as I was with bosses so I will be with you so he know that God of Moses was in charge of his life so when he needed a son he's in Christ oh God I didn't understand he said his son stands too I haven't I haven't I have a work to do wait till I'm done finish then you can come back then you can go and the sun was the son obey him that same God is here tonight if you face with any situation if you are in a line of duty and if you are in the world of God and the enemy comes just speak and go fast your God will come true and deliver you and make a way for you he hasn't changed he's the same yesterday to death forever amen I believe that Peter the red they all have that Revelation on the gate of beautiful gate when you saw that man who was crippled Peter didn't praise hey come fast pick up your thing and walk had a man walk in the time of Jesus Lazarus said last was come forth he came was it I'm saying that it's not sometimes like a a black crap or what I was gonna use it um loose law what believe your life be simple and let God have his own way when a situation arrives and God needs you to speak he will speak through you because it's not you gonna speak remember Abram is the Angel God that spoke to him ask him how many square as you want and he spoke through and he got the exact word he wants in the sahity right house the angel asked him ask her what does she desire and he said the salvation of my children I gave it to you so it's all about him it's not about us he operates at the right time when we need it so we don't have to copycat or do anything is that is that impersonators like a son of Stephen he said that I joining the name of Jesus Christ that demon come to himself Jesus I know Paul I know who are you and there's a cow give me my give me my clothes and just rip him naked why because he was impersonating but when you are working in God there's one thing I'm just going to conclude very soon that it has never left me one time I was outside there with brother Simon Mr Johnson was saying that he wants to go to um Grenada or brother Tim but she doesn't have the money to go and Pastor told her in my presence Mr Johnson first of all find out if it is the will of God for you to go with a brother if God wants you to go he will make a way for you to be there and truly because God wants her to go God made a way for her and I was speaking to batim recently and she said a lot happened on that trip through our sister because she was in the world of God so when you are in the will of God he take care of business so don't go ahead of yourself first find out it is God's will for you to go that's why I brought me said before he goes to Africa he said that demon or evil spiritual Iran but he first find out if God wants him to be there and if God revealed to him that he has to go he doesn't care once you get there he says I take this country under my control in the name of Jesus and all demons have to flee because he is in the will of God so when you are in the will of God nothing can stop you amen so find out and the will of God is in his word recently I've just found out some people they base too much on prophecies based too much on this on that on that and God speaking voice and that but it doesn't matter what voice you hear it doesn't matter what problem it doesn't matter what he has to come back and line up with this word if it doesn't line up for this get away from it don't feed on that feed on the word of God check it back your Revelation it has to line up for this this is an absolute it doesn't matter how um how hundred percent the things look like it has to come back to this word of the Living God amen that's the problems some people have Hallelujah I'm just gonna wrap it up with this here um great just a little portion of that thing that I give to you I think it's in paragraph 287 of this said that now if you say it just presumptuously because the Bible said that if you say to this mountain be thou removed and do not doubt in your heart but believe that what you have said will come to pass you shall have what you say but the problem is saying that now if you say it just presumptuously it won't happen but if something in you that's your anointed for the job and will know that is the will of God to do it and will say it is God to happen so we don't say all those things presumptuously accumulated but if it's the will of God it's what come to pass amen amen so I think that's what I have for tonight and the the musicians can come forth amen Hallelujah that same God is here on Calvary he died for you and me amen praise God so I just wanted to live tonight with one thing if nothing's been gets into your heart let don't do anything with your own abilities let God flow through you let God's perfect will be done in your life amen please [Music] all glorious things [Music] it is very true my life is no longer [Music] how I to praise [Music] part of this place on [Music] here with me nothing of this [Music] is [Music] I can see oh I am a part of myself [Music] oh I am thank you I can see who I am [Music] Nation [Music] [Music] it's a revelation it's a revelation it's predestination is [Music] who I am who I am Hallelujah I like what he said remember who you are you are the specialized [Music]
