[0:05] [Music]
[0:18] good morning friends good Sunday morning
[0:21] to all of you may God richly bless us
[0:26] together here today I'm happy to be in
[0:30] the house of the Lord to praise him and
[0:34] give him Thanksgiving for all of his
[0:38] goodness and all of His mercies to me
[0:42] now last week we explained the meaning
[0:47] of the word quicken we quoted up from a
[0:52] poem called the little plant and spoke
[0:57] of gods that spoke of the fact of God's
[1:02] elected seed for if the seed be planted
[1:06] the water will raise it up again if the
[1:11] seed be planted the word will raise it
[1:15] up again and furthermore we talked about
[1:20] the seed gene of God how it was placed
[1:25] in the believer and for the believer to
[1:30] be conductor a conductor or conductors
[1:35] of the word of God in the age in which
[1:40] they are living in then we close with
[1:44] the thought of mechanics and dynamics
[1:50] that a car may have all the gas but if
[1:54] that spark plug
[1:56] that's not fire and there's no fire on
[1:59] the gas all you have is a piece of junk
[2:02] it may be beautiful
[2:04] it may be expensive it may be a lovely
[2:08] looking church might be a wonderful
[2:11] looking Christian person
[2:13] but whoever they are without that fire
[2:18] of the Holy Spirit that quickening power
[2:22] of the spark of the Living God making
[2:25] himself manifest in the life of that
[2:28] church or that individual it's nothing
[2:32] but a piece of junk but with the fire
[2:36] the motive power of the Holy Spirit is
[2:39] able to empower and motivate and move it
[2:44] to accomplish the perfect will and plan
[2:48] of God no Paul made it clear that his
[2:53] knowledge of Jesus Christ was not from
[2:57] the seminary it was not from the
[3:02] University of Gamaliel
[3:04] but his knowledge was from God he said
[3:10] by revelation he made known unto me the
[3:16] mystery by revelation he not the
[3:21] seminary he not the Malians University
[3:25] but he Jesus Christ who met him on the
[3:30] road to Damascus he revealed to me the
[3:36] mystery he revealed to me all of his
[3:40] hidden secrets all the great secrets of
[3:44] God that were hidden for ages and ages
[3:48] and for generations as it is written in
[3:53] the scriptures he has now made know all
[3:58] of his secrets that were hidden being
[4:01] made known to his people to his living
[4:05] Saints he is revealing himself and his
[4:09] word now let us read from the scripture
[4:15] Ephesians chapter 3 verses 1 to 5 for
[4:22] this cause re Paul the prisoner of jesus
[4:26] christ for you
[4:27] Gentiles if you have heard of the
[4:31] dispensation of the grace of God which
[4:34] is given to me you word how that by
[4:38] revelation he made known unto me the
[4:42] mystery as I wrote afore in a few words
[4:48] whereby when you read you may understand
[4:54] my understanding my knowledge in the
[4:58] mystery of Christ which in other ages
[5:04] was not made known unto the sons of men
[5:09] but as it is now revealed unto his holy
[5:15] apostles and prophets by the spirit that
[5:19] the Gentiles should be fellow heirs of
[5:22] the same body and partakers of his
[5:26] promise in Christ by the gospel how
[5:31] wonderful Paul received revelation for
[5:36] all received hidden knowledge
[5:39] oh we're speaking this morning on the
[5:44] Spirit quickens the word and before we
[5:50] continue speaking let us have a brief
[5:53] word of Prayer
[5:55] dear God we come today in the name of
[6:00] Jesus Christ made a great holy spirit
[6:05] move up on the scene Lord move on the
[6:09] waters of the word let the word of God
[6:13] be stirred up in our soul and let the
[6:17] word live today as it has never been
[6:21] alive let it leap off the pages of the
[6:25] Bible let it Lord God just leap into our
[6:28] hearts and you take all the praise the
[6:32] honor and glory for we ask it in the
[6:35] name of Jesus Christ amen and amen
[6:41] now Paul received God's great secrets by
[6:47] revelation and he received it by
[6:52] revelation how are you going to receive
[6:56] it how do we receive it how we probably
[7:02] receive revelation Ephesians 3 10.0
[7:07] tells us clearly is by revelation
[7:11] Hebrews tells us faith cometh by hearing
[7:14] and hearing by the Word of God it means
[7:20] that as you listen to this sermon faith
[7:25] revelation is knocking on your door may
[7:29] you open your heart may you open your
[7:32] mind your life and let the word of God
[7:36] come in we read in the book of
[7:38] revelation of Jesus knocking on the door
[7:42] asking to be let in and he was left on
[7:46] the outside
[7:47] oh I plead with you my friends my
[7:50] brothers and sisters do not leave him
[7:52] out of your experience do not exclude
[7:56] him from your life do not keep him away
[8:00] from your lifestyle but today I

[8:07] into your life and he will set all
[8:10] things right for his glory and honor how
[8:13] do you receive revelation how do you
[8:15] receive faith you receive it as I staff

[8:35] Bible if you are a child of God he will
[8:39] quickly your understanding to that word
[8:42] of God o listening also to the sermons
[8:48] of the messenger of this seventh church
[8:52] age will quickly
[8:54] your spirit quicken your soul to
[8:57] recognize the Word of God for your day
[9:00] and a message for your day you also may
[9:05] be able to receive revelation by reading
[9:09] the Word of God aloud to yourself a
[9:13] simple as it sounds
[9:16] reading the Word of God faith cometh by

[9:38] you to receive some understanding and
[9:43] revelation from the Word of God you also

[9:52] by having seasons of prayer sweet hour
[9:57] of prayer time for prayer in the
[10:00] presence of the Living God and ask God
[10:04] for wisdom during your time of prayer
[10:07] like Solomon asked God for pray for
[10:11] wisdom give me understanding Lord that I
[10:14] might know what to do and how to do it
[10:18] and he asked God for wisdoms God says
[10:21] you ask something that's far above
[10:23] riches far above just power or you've
[10:28] asked for wisdom which is the most
[10:30] excellent thing it's a great thing when
[10:33] you ask God to open up your
[10:36] understanding may you ask him today and
[10:39] I believe God will answer your prayer
[10:42] and give you the wisdom and the
[10:44] knowledge the leadership that erection
[10:48] that you seek here today you also may be
[10:51] able to receive revelation by times of
[10:57] meditation times of silence Oh
[11:02] blest quietness holy quietness in the
[11:06] presence of
[11:07] living God when God can whisper his
[11:10] secrets into your soul why don't we just
[11:14] in our heart say Lord open the eyes of
[11:18] my heart Lord open the eyes of my heart
[11:21] I want to see thee the the word I want
[11:26] to see the word open up to my soul that
[11:30] I might recognize who you are and who I
[11:34] am o God help us here today oh yes sir
[11:39] also we receive it by meditation for the
[11:45] Bible says these are my people and they
[11:51] are also the Sheep of my pasture God
[11:54] layton's us to sheep now what does she
[11:57] do after they've eaten grass and they go
[12:02] in the quietness under a shaded tree
[12:05] somewhere and they'll begin to chew what
[12:10] we call their cud they'll they'll bring
[12:13] it back up and they'll chew that grass
[12:16] finer than when they first eat it so
[12:20] sometimes we must do that with the Word
[12:22] of God also cows do the same they
[12:26] regurgitate sit under a tree and really
[12:30] begin to chew more finally the things
[12:34] that they had eaten and here you are
[12:37] today listening to the Word of God and I
[12:41] would pray my friends that you will
[12:44] regurgitate that you will take this to
[12:48] heart
[12:48] play it again sit listen and slowly be
[12:53] able to take it in your life inculcated
[12:57] into your character let the Word of God
[13:00] move richly within your soul to open up
[13:05] the gateways of your understanding that
[13:09] well did the messenger say to us long
[13:13] after I am gone just sit or lay there
[13:17] quietly in your room and
[13:20] to these tapes all friends this is
[13:25] advice we all should listen to coming
[13:29] from directly from God's servant and
[13:32] prophet of this hour yes sir
[13:36] believers I will encourage you to play
[13:39] play list these sermons and listen to
[13:44] them over and over and receive it into
[13:49] your soul while you are in the presence
[13:52] of the Living God because thinking of
[13:56] the word of thinking on the Word of God
[13:58] in silence opens up this supernatural
[14:03] portals of the higher dimensions in God
[14:08] and brings you to a place of a deeper
[14:13] walk where you no longer have to think
[14:17] about there about how to live and how to
[14:20] walk and what actions to take but you
[14:23] live in a state of grace you
[14:27] consistently live in a state of
[14:30] unconsciousness when the spirit of a
[14:34] mighty God flows through you without you
[14:37] having to think about any act any word
[14:41] consciously but it flows out of your
[14:44] life as your bless the entire atmosphere
[14:47] and the surroundings all around you
[14:51] absolutely so also you may receive
[14:55] revelation simply by having fellowship
[15:02] fellowshiping with your brothers and
[15:04] sisters around the revelation of the
[15:08] word create such an atmosphere and puts
[15:13] the entire group into heavenly places
[15:17] and set their minds upon things above
[15:21] and god sends down revelation by the
[15:27] bucket loads are by the handfuls on
[15:30] purpose for his glory and for his own
[15:34] and that revelation inspires and anoints
[15:38] the believer as they receive it we know
[15:43] also that you may receive a sudden flash
[15:47] of revelation lightning from the troll
[15:51] of God's tricks your soul sometimes
[15:53] you're sitting in the church and you're
[15:56] listening to the sermon or you're
[15:58] listening to a broadcast like this and
[16:01] in the middle of it a light from heaven
[16:05] heavenly sunshine shines down upon your
[16:08] soul and Witten's the Word of God
[16:11] whenever sons and daughters of God
[16:14] gather to worship God as they did before
[16:18] the foundation of the world creating
[16:22] great noise and praising and worshipping
[16:26] God like the voice of many Sun during
[16:30] waters in the presence of God when they
[16:33] rejoice job 38 verse 7 now here we see
[16:37] the very importance of fellowship
[16:40] fellowship is very important for when we
[16:45] come together he promised with two or
[16:48] three are gathered together in my name
[16:51] there am I in the midst to bless I
[16:56] believe he's here today I believe the
[16:59] Lord is flowing through this media I
[17:02] believe the Holy Spirit is anointing
[17:05] hearts changing lives bringing men and
[17:08] women to Christ and bringing believers
[17:11] closer to Jesus Christ and bringing
[17:15] ministers even to a clearer more
[17:18] powerful understanding of the Word of
[17:21] God not because of me but because it's
[17:24] the Great Holy Spirit Himself making
[17:28] himself known through the opening of the
[17:30] word for one and all that are willing to
[17:33] receive the Word of God in their day and
[17:37] in their time now as we started this
[17:41] talk by giving you various definition
[17:47] of the word quicken we found in those
[17:53] definitions that the word quicken means
[17:57] to stimulate or to excite interest
[18:01] quickly means to give or to restore life
[18:05] as in the quickening of the body of
[18:09] Jesus Christ quicken it restored life to
[18:14] the dead physical body of Jesus I'm
[18:18] applying that to thee o the Holy Spirit
[18:22] quit me the letter that kills the dead
[18:25] word and brings it to life in the alert
[18:28] of the believer also it means the cause
[18:32] of fire to burn it if there's no fire my
[18:40] friends it's no use to sacrifice being
[18:44] on the altar as a wonderful brother
[18:46] priest a wonderful message no sacrifice
[18:51] no fire will fall o blessed be the name
[18:55] of the Lord so we need the fire we need
[18:59] the Holy Spirit we don't want or desire
[19:03] to have a dead church a dead life a dead
[19:08] walk and unexcited existence in the
[19:12] presence of the Living God but we want
[19:15] to walk with God every day and see the
[19:18] vindication of His divine presence
[19:21] working within our lives yes sir
[19:26] well did the old song says burn burn
[19:29] holy spirits burn and me set my soul on
[19:34] fire fill me with the Holy Ghost and
[19:40] God's will desire make me like the
[19:45] Christ of old healing and raising the
[19:48] dead
[19:49] Oh blessed be the name the Lord may God
[19:52] help every one of us here today to enter
[19:55] into the presence of God enter into
[19:59] inheritance of his word that he has sent
[20:03] to us through the Ministry of William
[20:06] Marian bran Hamed a prophet of God for
[20:10] this 20th century read his his biography
[20:14] read his life story written by Gordon
[20:17] Lindsay and man sent from God 20th
[20:21] century prophet written also by Perry
[20:26] green Oh may the Living God bless these
[20:29] words to our hearts here today let the
[20:32] fire of God fall upon this word here
[20:36] today may the fire of God fall upon this
[20:41] altar and anoint the word of God fire
[20:45] fire fire fire fall on me as it was on
[20:49] the day of Pentecost may the fire of God
[20:52] fall on me may the Spirit of God search
[20:55] our hearts and burn out every trace of
[20:58] sin and bring the light and glory in now
[21:03] quicken also means to speed up it means
[21:10] to make something faster or to cause
[21:13] something to accelerate o blessed be the
[21:19] name of the Lord as I think of this I am
[21:23] thinking of a very popular song that we
[21:26] all love these are the days of Elijah
[21:29] these are the days of the Elijah
[21:32] oh praise God and it reminds me of
[21:36] Elijah and am first Kings chapter 17 and
[21:41] 18 is where you will find that story you
[21:44] can read it for yourself how that Elijah
[21:49] had met with behalf and told him after
[21:55] the great drought that they had that he
[22:00] had right on the chariot go back to
[22:05] Jezreel Oh
[22:07] for I hear the sound of the abundance of
[22:10] rain Oh rain is
[22:12] the Holy Spirit's anointing is coming
[22:16] the power of God is coming down to heal
[22:19] you to save you to deliver you to raise
[22:22] you up to vindicate his word the spirit
[22:26] of the Living God
[22:27] the rain is coming and he had said whoa
[22:31] he's like I'm gonna get there before you
[22:35] so he grabbed the home of his reigns and
[22:38] you know a king yes the best chariots he
[22:40] has the best horses and he took off in a
[22:44] cloud of dust heading towards Jezreel
[22:48] but the Bible says but the hand of the
[22:52] Lord the hand of the Lord was upon
[22:55] Elisha and when the Holy Spirit
[23:00] anointing fell upon the Elijah Elisha
[23:03] and all prophet the Bible says that
[23:07] Elijah out when all of a hams chariot
[23:11] and was waiting him at the gate of Jesse
[23:15] just real because Elijah got there
[23:18] before he did think about it this the
[23:22] Spirit of God fell upon an old man and
[23:26] quickened him typing that old man like
[23:29] they the ancient word of God given down
[23:33] to us and we think it's an old word but
[23:36] when the Spirit of God fell on that man
[23:39] as it falls upon the word of God for
[23:43] this day 2000 years five five thousand
[23:47] years later it falls upon that word it

[24:34] and you've asked God to open your eyes

[24:40] already open then you need to ask him to

[30:18] all feel the quickening power I feel as
[30:22] and sense the presence of Almighty God
[30:25] moving within my heart and within my
[30:29] life it's so good to be a Christian it's
[30:32] so good to be a child of God it's so
[30:35] good to be a son or daughter of God
[30:38] being led by the Spirit of God and
[30:41] anointed by the Holy Ghost to perform
[30:45] God's will and the fulfill my purpose
[30:48] here upon the earth think of it the word
[30:53] means to accelerate quicken means to
[30:57] accelerate and Elijah surely accelerated
[31:01] pass a HAP's chariot we also see the
[31:08] start of the quickening power of God in
[31:11] Elijah's bones you will read that
[31:16] incident in 2nd Kings chapter 13 verses
[31:20] 20 to 21 weird the prophet Elijah had
[31:26] died and it came to pass as the
[31:29] Scriptures will say they buried him in a
[31:34] cave and while I was in Israel and
[31:38] passed many little caves on the side of
[31:41] the road and in those caves people were
[31:45] buried because that was the ancient way
[31:48] of burying folks so Elijah's cave was
[31:53] there at the site of the road and so ok
[31:59] the past there was a war and this young
[32:01] man was wounded and dying and no doubt
[32:07] his friends wanted to get him back his
[32:10] family tried to write quickly away from
[32:13] the enemy with this half dying man and a
[32:16] kid to pass he died he died and to save
[32:20] their own lives they're going to lessen
[32:22] the weight they're gonna lessen the Lord
[32:25] that they were carrying they threw him
[32:28] off of the horse and it just so happens
[32:31] he fell right on into the cave on top of
[32:36] Elijah's bones that were laying there
[32:40] now Elijah's bones is a type of the Word
[32:44] of God with the latent power of the Holy
[32:49] Spirit within it amen
[32:53] which my friends it's release just the
[32:58] think after this man is prophet and
[33:02] dying his bones were still vibrating
[33:04] with lights vibrating with resurrection
[33:08] power so that when a dead
[33:10] man came in contact with him as much as
[33:13] when a believers filled with the Holy
[33:16] Spirit and one who is dead and sins and
[33:18] trespasses comes in contact with them
[33:21] that Spirit of God is able to quicken
[33:24] the life of that person that was dead in
[33:26] sins and in trespasses and bring them to
[33:30] a supernatural life so this young man
[33:32] fell upon the bones of Elijah and soon
[33:37] the power of God struck him and the
[33:40] Bible says he punched out he came out of
[33:43] that cave and he was alive again and no
[33:46] doubt running up the road running up the
[33:49] road because the anointing struck him
[33:52] from off of that death prophet print
[33:56] bones that was there praise God
[33:58] hallelujah
[33:59] I know another prophet has gone on and I
[34:01] want to tell you if you think that his
[34:04] messages his words are all dead and it's
[34:08] gone and it's dying and everything else
[34:11] oh you just get around it
[34:13] you just form up on it you just let the
[34:17] Holy Spirit of God straight your soul
[34:20] but this word of God it will bring you
[34:22] to life or if that same spirit will
[34:25] quicken you to life again run a glory of
[34:28] praise of the Living God hallelujah I
[34:31] tell you friends no matter how they
[34:34] track these Deen deepen nations try to
[34:37] bury you in every possible way I'll tell
[34:41] you the Holy Spirit is here to quicken
[34:44] and raise you up hallelujah yo there's
[34:48] still resurrection power here there is
[34:52] still resurrection power in the Word of

[35:00] tell you my friends it's here today for
[35:03] is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today

[35:34] blessed be the name of our Living God
[35:37] hallelujah yes sir power to put you in
[35:41] the rapture
[35:41] I remember the quick link bar struck
[35:44] Samson one train he picked up an old
[35:47] broken jawbone of an ass tight for the
[35:50] word of God again and smoked with that
[35:54] thousand Philistines which is a type of
[35:57] the believer under the anointing picking
[36:00] up the Word of God and as the scripture
[36:02] says one shall chase a thousand and do
[36:06] shall chase ten thousand oh we are more
[36:10] than conquerors through him that loved
[36:12] us praise God for evermore God's Holy
[36:16] Spirit can also quicken you to have a
[36:21] quickened understanding Hebrews 4:12 for

[36:33] discern hallelujah the Holy Spirit can
[36:36] discern between your soul your spirit
[36:39] your body the Spirit of God is here to
[36:43] take that word and but surgical parents
[36:47] kill to deserve hallelujah your heart
[36:50] may the Spirit of God discern us here
[36:54] today that we may recognize what he is
[36:57] trying to say to us no job was quickened
[37:00] to understanding I believe we also need
[37:05] to be quickened in spiritual
[37:07] understanding job was a man filled with
[37:11] questions job was the richest man of his
[37:15] day that has nothing to do with it you
[37:17] can be rich you can be intellectual you
[37:20] can be knowledgeable in things of this
[37:23] world and totally and absolutely
[37:25] ignorant and blindfolded lightning in
[37:30] your mind and in your foxhole to the
[37:33] thing
[37:34] of the Living God you need the spirit of
[37:37] godly the teacher to come and open up
[37:42] your understanding to the Word of God
[37:44] when you ask him to do so would you ask
[37:47] him Lord open up the the gateway of my
[37:52] soul that I might recognize what you are
[37:55] saying to me from your word but I may
[37:58] not just be a reader of the word or a
[38:01] hearer of the word only but one who
[38:05] hears recognizes and acts upon the word
[38:09] and let the word come to life and
[38:11] manifestation through me job had a lot
[38:15] of questions in his life and job was
[38:18] asked can can a man by searching find
[38:22] out God then he asked who can bring a
[38:27] clean City out of an unclean thing then
[38:32] he asked how are the dead raised up
[38:35] these questions are still be amassed and
[38:38] he also asked if a man die shall he live
[38:43] again so he was filled with questions
[38:46] John chapter 19 verses 25 around there
[38:51] the Bible tells us this great incident
[38:54] of job asking the questions and then God
[38:58] turned around and begin to ask job do
[39:02] you know how I place the earth in a
[39:04] circle to hang on nothing
[39:06] do you know how the stars are staying in
[39:10] their places and don't move until I say
[39:12] so
[39:13] how waters the waters are out there and
[39:17] the water is even on the heavens like
[39:19] that God began to ask him some
[39:22] soul-searching questions may you ask
[39:25] yourself some soul-searching questions
[39:28] here today and while job was listening
[39:31] to God speaking the Holy Spirit struck
[39:34] his soul the thunder rolled a lightning
[39:37] flash Joby said I know that my Redeemer
[39:41] liveth and shall stand upon the earth in
[39:44] the
[39:44] time sees their job catches a revelation
[39:47] and that revelation openness
[39:49] understanding from that time when he was
[39:52] a life right to the coming of the Lord
[39:55] where he said I know he knew there was a
[39:58] redeemer coming
[39:59] I read my Redeemer liveth and will stand
[40:03] upon your rapture second coming
[40:06] hallelujah in the latter days God turned
[40:09] him from a nobody
[40:11] into his profit he recognized his
[40:15] position and here he turned from
[40:19] uncertainty he turned from a state of
[40:22] presumption he turned from a state of
[40:26] uncertainty to a place where he could
[40:29] say I know where he was now certain of
[40:33] God and recognized who he was and what
[40:37] he was to do with the rest of his life
[40:39] may God help you today Saints may God
[40:42] help your child of God may God help you
[40:45] sir may God help you man may God help
[40:48] you miss may God help you young people
[40:51] to recognize who you are and allow the
[40:54] Holy Spirit to give your life

[40:59] lead you in the direction of where you
[41:02] should go

[41:25] came upon the apostles and quicken them

[41:31] conductors of the Holy Spirit that when
[41:34] they laid their hands on the sick the
[41:36] sick shall recover to me conductors of
[41:39] the Holy Spirit that when they spoke the
[41:42] Word of God with power and with boldness
[41:45] oh there was deliverance there was
[41:48] healing there was people running to the
[41:50] altars of God crying men and brethren
