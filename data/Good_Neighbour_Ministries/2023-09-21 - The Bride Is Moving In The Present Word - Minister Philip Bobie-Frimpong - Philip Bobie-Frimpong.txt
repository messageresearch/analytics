the scriptures right away Joshua chapter 1 verse 1 to 9 we're gonna be reading a couple of scriptures alongside the rule okay now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord he came to pass that the Lord spoke unto Joshua the son of Dan Moses Minister saying mostly my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all these people on the language I do give to them even the children of Israel every place that the soul of the the feet every every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even on the Great River the river is freeze all the land of Heritage and on the grace he told the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of their life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I'll not fail thee nor forsake me be strong and of a good courage For unto these people shall they divide for an inheritance the language I swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou means observed to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from a to the right hand or to the left that thou means Prosper whatsoever to our goals this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shall meditate there in day and night and thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then shall thou make thy way prosperous and then shall have good success heavenly father bless the reader of the word in Jesus name amen please be seated Hallelujah so I'm only gonna take that Joshua number one and just explain them how God has lived my heart so um the first verse now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord he came to pass that the Lord speak unto Joshua the son of man Moses means I say Moses my servant is dead he's specifying me to claim that Moses my servant is dead and when he said that as by Thomas have taught us Brahm type himself as Dr mooses and and all that type he types of osmosis so God specifically told us that Moses is dead but the message also what go on but the people always don't like a change when there is a change from one situation to other it becomes a war people like to be in their old way of doing things and I was a privilege to be a supervisor for so many years in this in a specific company and what I realized is that when I took the position I have plans I have aims I have things to let the work go perfectly well but because somebody has already planted a seed so the old people it was hard to move them when you teach them to do this they say Moses said this you teach them do they say there are four mother say this this one said this so they were very like Steve but the new ones that I have I was able to train them the way I wanted to be to train them so what I'm saying is that people don't like change and I'm not even surprised because the two million people that came with Moses God did not let all the two million people perish Joshua went with only new generation because I believe that when they went to spy the land and Joshua stood by Moses but God knows that the people are so sick with Moses ideas they all want to say what Moses said so when Joshua move came to the office God will not allow all those people to go Josh and God you're going to give him trouble down the road because people always want to go back and stay with that God's word is still moving on so the true bride of Christ they recognize the move we if that people could have just accepted everything that came to Pentecost plus what God will continue to reveal everything will go on perfectly well they put like to stick to their back God sent us a Vindicated prophet and he has done everything he has finished his work he's gone to his reward so that people want to go and and working back from his sleep they don't want him to have a sleep and relax so that has always been the people and it's not been easy even Paul when he came on the scene we can read from um Acts 21-21 in Acts 21 when Paul was trying to move the people from law to Grace they their Jews were resistant they didn't want to move because Moses said Moses said they want to move from what Paul was trying to tell them so in Acts 2020 I said that and they I formed the dark teachers all the Jews which Amanda that's us to forsake Moses Paul was never told them to forsake Moses but because it becomes something new to them they don't want to accept it but it was still the ways of God saying that they ought not to circumcise their children either to work after the customs because they didn't understand what Paul was trying to say but a few who were chosen have the Revelation they accepted his way and it becomes so bad that um John the Baptist he was the one that introduced the Messiah he said I my secrets he must increase he point them the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world he did that clearly and those disciples that have Revelation in his time they left John and followed the Lamb of Christ but if you go back to Acts Chapter 19 Verse 1 to 3 we still have people who were baptizing in John's baptism still following John even though John has pointed them the Messiah they didn't want to have a change they feel comfortable during their old way things and you can never move forward by staying in your own way when the world is moving we got to move with it if you don't move without gonna be left behind some people are always almost being left behind already because they have been so safe and staying back doesn't want to move through the word of the hour so we have a trouble with people what Ram staying put they never want to move where God is telling us move forward don't stay in your past yes God sent a prophet Vindicated Prophet never happened the life of the world before God used him so much as I said the other time that when God incarnate a man like the prophets like Paul and Brahman do his praise is so much in them that the things that they do and make people seem like God in them and they want to worship them and even Paul and Barnabas one time they have to rent their clothes and put ashes in them that we are men of Life passing like you are worship God and that angel in Revelation 19 wanted to worship that the seven the angel for our age and he's told John I am one of your brethren worship God he didn't allow him to worship Him and the prophet have to live the sins stop preaching for about three and a half years because people wanted to worship Him but God has to reveal to him they did that John the Baptist they did that so he came back and you'll be surprised in this 22nd century people are still trying to worship him some worship him in his picture and doing everything but the bride of Christ are true and some of them also has gone to the other end renouncing the message um saying this is not this this is not that finding false with the message but the true bride walk in the Middle with a balance believe in God and serving God Amen he walked right in the middle of the road amen because he never denied that prophet of God he knew if it's not him he wouldn't have so have so many things and what am I trying to say it wasn't easy even for Jesus Christ in his time because Moses told them that God will raise a prophet unto like me and when that Prophet was raised and he was in the midst of them talking to them they said that Moses said he said if you had believed Moses you have believed in me because Mercy wrote about me by the true bride of Christ in that time they recognize the sun they regret the Son of God their record that he said Messiah on the earth they couldn't miss it it was so clear to them but the people were reading this very Bible and this is my Bible has become manifest in front of them and the rest of denying the weather has been put on flesh because always is the one is in letter form but when you put on the Flesh and it manifests then the people don't have nothing to do with it amen he said yesterday to them forever because the word has come flesh and it's working in the eye people are trying to point the people Jesus Christ on the cross but they forgot that is now sitting in the aisle with you and me and everybody the bride of Christ sitting over here even right now so Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever Our God has never changed you think it was easy for Abraham that change that came when Pentacles came they are formed they have the restoration of their gift first time in the history of men that they were speaking in tongues and all these three manifestation the love of God and the wise and embracing their bloods and everything and God using that black man Simon so supernaturally and they seen the power of God like that and then they formed speaking in tongues as the evidence of the Holy Ghost but when God sent his Prophet because it was changing of this sensation from the restoration of the gift to fulfillment of balaka four five Revelation thanks to all those scriptures when he came on the scene and started telling them that speaking in songs is not the evidence of the Holy Ghost but it is what a gift of the Holy Ghost you think it was easy when he started telling them that true baptism has to be in the name of Jesus when he started telling them that women should not preach woman not to preach out to or stop authority over the man for the woman being deceived fall in transgression however he will be said in chattering if this remaining sobriety you think it was easy at that time the offers took him yet it was in the word of God and that is what is happening right now everything that is happening is written here better people are denying it you think it's easy for a pastor when he has to stand out and say that um have you been received the Holy Ghost since you believe this message they'll tell you what are you talking about but that was the move of God but that people don't want to accept it because his jacket is all in a word talking about eternal churches and they might change and everything they don't want to accept it but it's also written because they don't want to change they have become accustomed that oh when you come out from the Pentecost you have received the Holy Ghost once you have this when the word god revealed himself and he said have you been received since you believe then they didn't want to have nothing to do beg their true Sons and Daughters of God recognize this is that said the Lord and they follow that that voice of God so it's happening in every dispensation people don't want a change and it's not it wasn't easy for Disciples of Jesus Christ even if you check in the scriptures but Peter was telling said why you said the woman has touched you so many people have been touching you because they've been the follower of the word they also having their Spirit they are said their first share of the accusation so Peter has to say oh Lord this is not interested that I could I perceived that virtue has gone out from me so what I'm trying to say that when God gave you a true servant and you follow Christ you follow that seven that's you follow Christ when he gets there Glory you get that Glory when the people attack him in some way or the other you're gonna also feel it but a true Son of God will stand by that man of God like um the David David um that those people who were faithful to David who went to get water for him to drink I remember one time I met a brother and you are going to have a fellowship and I thought that you're going to talk about he's not in our church anyway from different church and I thought you're going to talk about what God has done in our lives and just encourage and be happy with one another we went to Starbucks this man started oh your pastor said this your pastor said that I said my brother didn't come for here the Bible said that the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready it's where does the marriage take place and this man couldn't save him a word he was exposed right there because the thing that we are talking is written here that's why I believe that if you have looked into it this is that talks about me they won't take their time and search the scriptures and pray even if they don't understand they should even keep mood and let God reveal to them when the time comes for them to know as Pastor told us online so that when the light flash on that word it becomes manifest become that manifestation for that work they won't have that patience they won't have that happiness to wait but they will just jump to criticize it and that is death to some people because it's God's word for your day because people want to live in the past but a true daughter or son of God will recognize what God is doing in present tense now what God is doing the scripture pertaining his death because eagles eat fresh food will be the man that God make it simple for the Israelites you cannot go back and keep the manner for yesterday I will send you mercy upon Mercy each and every day as new message every day so look for the new things that God is doing God is doing new things God is moving on their wedding is moving was saying that saying the prophet gone left on the street for so many years with that time we have what I saw uh what as as soon as the people have went to the moon and everything but if you check from State five continent science has gone so far ahead you think God is staying back listen to um the message called um it says contending countdown he talked about John Wesley would house this and that and since 1965 you see advancement of science it has gone so far so God hasn't stayed there God is also on the move he's still moving so you have to recognize what he is doing and move on with the team let that word of God move on with you don't stay in your past amen stay in the move in the presence of God Amen because God said Not His glory with anybody his glory is that himself nobody is only himself he keep it to himself he alone has to be worshiped in in Matthew 17 verse 4 to 4. 17 48 Peter and John and James they wanted to do that he said that then I said Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here amen if that will let us make here straight Tabernacles one for thee run for Moses and one for him yes why did you expect Behold a bright Cloud overshadow them and wrote a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased here ye him and when the established head they fell on their face and were so afraid and Jesus came and touched him and said I Rise and be not afraid and when they had lifted their eyes they saw no man saved Jesus only Jesus only Give Me Jesus only nobody else Jesus only that's all I'm Desiring nothingness to your eyes are to see Jesus is one person of the Lord who said one God one God the godhead he is the only one he said our father of the Alpha and the Omega they bring that and Bright Morning Star he's everything the I see only Jesus gave me only Jesus in the name of Jesus every knee shall bow of things in heaven on Earth amen and every thoughts are confessed that Jesus Christ is God behind him the Estonia that God neither of them after him he's the one true Living God and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ he is the only one that will worship we worship Christ the King he amen he's our savior hallelujah praise our God our God is good Hallelujah amen praise God so what am I trying to say that our focus our everything should be on Christ nothing else if you check you can see it it's all over the place it's everywhere when you check on the um I think on the you check you check on the most of the places in the um one of the sermons why he just type it up with the Millennium that you're trying to say that in Millennium we work because a thousand rain of the bride of Christ the type seven Church ages we're gonna work we're gonna do everything but when it comes to Eighth Day the eighth age the um the new Heavens that I prepare you a new Heavens a new air is God coming to prepare it there were no one can't can touch it it's only him that is doing it so he's sharing all his glory with anybody so now he has come down and what and doing that work himself because when it came to this time he didn't left it in any man's hand he said I will come I will not forsake I'll never leave you I'll come and I'll be with you even in you until the consummation of the time he is the new tonight he's the same yesterday driver where is the god of Elijah Elijah didn't ask for Elijah said where is the god of Elijah the God that was in brother Abraham that's the god that we are serving the same God his name is the Lord Jesus Christ he's the one that we accept he's never going to leave us not forsake us this is the truth is that God that we're crying to amen he hasn't changed he said he will never leave us nor forsake us amen praise God our God is good all the time Hallelujah so what am I trying to say you have the mind of Christ it's you that Christ is inside of you so you recognize that then God is giving you this commandment in Joshua chapter 1 verse five he said that there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of their life as I was with Moses so I will be with you I will not fail thee nor forsake thee amen he promised he will never leave thee nor forsake thee I'll be with you even in you until the consummation of the time so as the brothers sing the song Something keep on holding me since God called us it has not been easy you get to some place some of us were even running live because it gets so tough sometimes a Christian work is not a flowery bread of ease it's a battle it's a fight sometimes you go through some scars but what do you think is keeping you some cannot stand they just run away when the tribe become hot so many we started a race with where are they it's not he who does start the race he that endure to end he is the Wonder World gonna receive the reward never give up it doesn't matter what happened we will never give up We Stand by this word oh as I said if I perish let me perish this is the truth if this is the truth I'm gonna support it with all my heart my mind my soul everything within me will support this word of God Amen if I perish let me perish I am willing to go out away it doesn't matter what happened what comes my way I'm going with the Lord says twice no matter what happened to me I'm going with the Lord Jesus Christ I am not moving on each yes the devil you can attack me you can do whatever you want with me take everything back give me Jesus I will never brought that to you Satan and bow down to Jesus Christ you belong to my feet Satan I step on you you have no parted me I'm a son of the Living God no matter what kind my way I worship Jesus amen because he is the one keeping me I cannot keep myself who can keep himself no one but he has kept us all this far so I encourage you tonight let's keep pressing on let's keep pressing on is that if you can only know what's what's for what's ahead of us you'll never give up we will press on WE press on and Press On A Prayer he has done everything listen God could have given the whole life bear for them to take everything but he said that little by little I will give it to you everywhere your footstep I have given it to you amen so footsteps mean possession you got to put your food there just like that the lepers that we talk about the other time they said that if we stay here we are dead people if we go over the other side they can kill us but you can maybe also be saved so that they say in that place to die they make a move as the pastor also his action brings a reaction so make a move just move forward don't stay in your comfort zone if you don't understand anything just give yourself a time God will make it clear to you you're gonna make it plain don't just challenge don't just fight don't fast lift this alone and God himself will fight our battles for you he will take care of you sometimes you are quick to judge you are quick to this we are quick to do this but God wants us to just relax and you take care of first if you check the Bible says that they established there are men of few words they are full of Holy Ghost amen sometimes you get yourself talk talk talk certain things that are not even supposed to talk you end up talking so sometimes I'm not saying you don't have to talk you have to talk but you have to know what you're talking about don't just get loose and just talk all your secret everywhere there are certain things that doesn't have to go anyway amen our God is good hallelujah praise God amen verse 7. only be thou strong and very courageous that thou Mays observed to do according to all the law which Moses by servant commanded thee turn off from me to the right hand or to the left that directs May prosper with server to our doors verse 8 this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shall meditate daring day and night that thou must observe to do according to all that is written therein for then shall thou make thy wayward prosperous and then shall have what good success amen he said that the book of us are not the path but thou cemented there in day and night in Psalm 1 verse 4 Psalm 1 verse 1 it says that blessed is the man thou work not in the Council of the ungodly not stand in the way of sinners nor seated in the seat of the scaffold but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law do what he meditate day and night you got Psalm 19 brabham which to like to pray with that let the west of my mouth and the meditations in my heart be acceptable unto thee o my king and my word Redeemer in other words that scripture is trying to tell the prophet said that if you are thinking something in your heart whatever you meditating you and you say it's something contrary to what you are saying that make you a hypocrite that's why Jesus Christ if I say to be hypocrite so everywhere that is the way that is coming from your mouth shall have to line up with what's in your heart if that is not happening you cannot even have what you ask them for that the Bible said that if thou can't believe all things are possible to them that belief if you doubt you won't get what you are saying that's why immaculating says if you do not doubt then believe that what you have said will come to pass you shall have what you say so the meditations in our heart is very very important because our thoughts speaks louder in heaven than our words you can deceive the people but you can't deceive God he knows moving right now whatever you thinking he knows everything about us so we have to be playing I'll rather stand by my conviction and be rebuke or be ridiculous than to hide and try to please people because God don't want people who try to please men just be yourself speak the truth if you're gonna be killed let them kill you whatever it is speak the truth and be free that's why God loved David when he saw the Ark of the Covenant coming he put us some moves you know he didn't care about the wife whatever anybody was saying he was so happy with the Lord that his son he danced and everything and the wife was angry he said you despise me I despise you then you show him another move because why he respect God he loved God we don't have to please one another we have to please Jesus and when our heart is right to God and we please God unconscious automatically you'll be pleasing our brothers and sisters because the same God in you in them when you are right with God you'll be right to the people around you if you are not right to God things will fall apart so God wants us to be faithful God wants us to what think and meditate on the right word that's that's why I said that in in Philippians said that whatsoever things that our good report whatsoever things that edifies if there are any virtues think on those things because your thought forms an atmosphere around you if you're thinking negative people don't want to get around you because automatically is going to say negative things around them there's any situation that you complain this this that God don't want people who are complaining you take positive from everything and to when our record good just be positive oriented that's why that every positive and mentality will bring what God presents down it will bring your request to pass if thou can't believe all things are possible to them that believe he's the same yesterday today and forever and one other thing too a lot for people is not as brown explained it's not your thoughts alone as Christian cancels the Christian Science said but let the word of God when you go through the channel of your thoughts then automatically other things was what flow through so you have to sit on the word of God listen to the tips read your Bible pray every day God will do the rest when you fall in love with that with the Lord the word will be revealed to you you know the written part by falling in love with him because if you you're in love with your wife your wife don't have to write everything for you to understand so as if you are truly in love with God you don't have you just have to know all the written words or written part will be will be claimed to us because we are in love with the Lord the maker so let's fall in love with the word of God Let's Fall In Love Like remember our first love when he first called us you are so excited we are so eager to be in the house of God we can't wait to be here we can't wait to be in the premature we can't wait till you understand you can't wait to be every time I run the word of God what happened what happened we have to shake the system away from us doubt your doubt and believe God let's come back to our first love and worship him he's more than able to give us the desires of artists more than able to solve every problem is more than able to take us through it's more than able because listen it's never going to be better it's gonna get worse and worse cold if you're looking for things to better forget it it's going to be worse but if you and if you allow God to live through you he also going to move mightily through you because this is the hour there is no any other time that God wants to manifest himself for through his bride this is the time this is the time we used to say that he's coming this has happened but everything is here now because God is ready to move his bride to another damage to another level amen he's doing that now because the same God is here the same God that was in the prophet he said you is in me as the brother was saying the other time he was saying that um when naturally somebody do something bad to you brother Bill and the person is tormenting you do something wrong oh you're gonna give him like this but with the love of God will let you pray for his soul but those things you cannot do it I cannot do it but God has to do that unconsciously through you and me like example when brah Brahm had that encounter with that maniac he said that when the man was coming to him some love came to him that he can't explain it he wished he's in that condition all the time and that love of God it was it defeated the devil so all that we have to do Just Surrender ourselves when the time comes out God wants us to project that love he'll let us project it if sometimes through some people are so stubborn that he wants us to use King like the Lord said use came in the church to wipe them you're gonna let us wipe because sons and daughters are led by the spirit of God God don't expect to just be only one way because the devil will just know all your trust but one time God will allow you to just be quiet and let somebody go and that time we're gonna let you to discipline that and say no you can't do that here he is God I remember one time in the early 1999 to late 1992 000. I went to the bank to cash a check and the lady was so mean to me normally if I go to bank and somebody I said give my check to me let me go Maria go another place but this time she was so mean to me but something I don't know what happened I started praying my heart for unconsciously I didn't put up to that within a short time everything was changed she came back and she was so happy to do whatever I want for him for her I want from her why the love of God project through me and did that says the other situation you do it differently because it's not God is not the Sons and Daughters of God I led by the spirit of God so they can act as a lion one time it can act as a lamb but God chooses when to do it all that you have to do to heal yourself to him and he will flow through us the way he wants to flow is not by might or power but by my spirit says the Lord it depends on what you give to God that's what God gonna use like something when he got a situation there was nothing for something to use they took a Jawbone that's why he has and God used that job to do their job one time Moses used as a slingshot do their job so it depends on what you give to God he will use whatever tool you give to him if you give him if you give him all of yourself you're gonna use all of yourself it depends on how much because God doesn't force himself on you and on me he's a gentle God he gave us a free moral agency but he being God knows that you were there with him before the foundations of the world so the female regions that he gave us we give it back to him and he said Lord has to you we give you everything take control use this for your own Glory we don't want you to be only our state there by you we want you to be our lordship Lord means that full control full Authority fools control through everything he controls all your move your actions your everything the Lord says Christ controls it that's why much we have given to him the bride of Christ God is the new doing the same thing he hasn't changed he's the same yesterday today and forever our God is marching on brothers and sister let's match with him let's go with the tune of the word don't let's stay behind those that stand behind the way God beat those that stay behind they couldn't make it let's move let's march on the movie song Brothers is that the movie song my sister let's move on brother move on sister this is the moving day there is no other day there's the time to move on let's move on with the scripture let's move on with the word of God he's the same yesterday to them forever as God has never changed amen God loves you he loves me and one more one last thing that I'm gonna just conclude that last week after church service I had a big toothache I couldn't but God has a sense of humor I couldn't sleep on not this standing the Sunday before the whole night I couldn't sleep and then I went to the doctor because he did um put some gold on it and everything about 2014 it cost me a lot of money almost two thousand dollars so this doctor I don't want to take it out and I'm still feeling the pain he said I'll keep it I'll keep it and then I came home on Monday I started having the pain I said please take it away from me he took it I'm still feeling the pain and coming home driving and then I first time maybe I've had it before bed maybe I wasn't conscious of that you know and then I heard Brown talking about that if you go to the doctor and they take your tooth what the doctor has done he has taken that tooth out but the actual healing is done by God there's no medication nothing that can heal the truth but it was so funny that I'm not maybe I have not I've heard it or haven't heard back how come that exact time I'm going through that pain I had that word of God and he just gave me encouragement because that I am the Lord God that he let all thy disease everything you have no God healed at all he's interested in everything about you there's nothing later in God take all your problems to God he's a friend that loves it cares about us every little thing that you think is not important give it to his hand you are so interested even in the life of that little fish what about you God is interested in everything about your life so don't try some people I've realized that their home you call them I have this problem I have this problem why didn't come to church oh I was going through this problem I said why didn't you bring to the Brethren let's all pray to support you because one reaches a thousand two which is ten thousand he said oh this is the letter three I don't want to bother anybody with it but you are still struggling with that little thing couldn't come couldn't make you come to church so it's not a little every little thing that happens sometimes the devil tried to bring this Comfort to you if you don't recognize that he's gonna play with you and just make a mess that will bring little to here this year just to distract you so you've got to cast those things off and if you can't do it by yourself ask for a reinforcement ask for your Deacon ask for someone to support you in prayer and get rid of that and that is bothering because one will chase a thousand two sisters and everything whatever you bind on Earth is bound in heaven whatever you lose is loose in heaven so you have the power in the name of Jesus he is giving us authority over everything he said the words that I do shall you also do greater than this shall he was why because the very member body that same God is in many member body doing so many things he's in you it means the greater West than this shall you also do if you abide in me in my word abide in you ask whatever you want and to be given unto you that same God is here he's the same yesterday to them forever don't worry about it he's in control of your life he loves you cares for you he's here to bless you he's here to give you all the desires of your heart he is there to live and direct everything that you drink if thou can surrender if thou can give him all all you all he's more than able to do it don't let nothing hinder you I'm gonna read this little quote and then wrap up very shortly in the greatest battle ever fought paragraph 104 he said that you have to open the Channel first you've got to get the soldier the Holy Spirit placed at the Battlefront that tells God's word he is the word and he stand there there's nothing going to stop it then there's nothing every one of other trainers is cleared out just like an old boiler with fluent stop up you put a fire in it it will blow your thing up that's what the matter with so many blowed up Christians it's because that they don't clean the channels out they don't go down the inside you've got to clean it conscious memory thought laying aside everything and coming from the inside out with that Arnold dreaded word of God that is the truth let's clean all the China stuff let's get rid of all the malice the hatred all those things that is not true outside people I'm fed up I'm just people just long skirts and nice suit and everything but remember they might have some malice and all those who hiding there God wants all those cockroaches to come up Let the Fire of God burn everything all like Christ for me so that God can have that premise and flow the way he wants to flow oh in the AI what he can saw something and they affected the whole church the whole congregation check your life and see things that you're doing that doesn't come to affect the rest of us okay my reality between myself I got to make things right to God you have to do your part because it's time that God wants to move his children to another level amen because it's Joshua time amen the Holy Ghost is moving on all right it's your life Christ want us to get it from every part so that he can have that preeminence and floatress let's make things right let God not reminisce amen praise God that's what I have for tonight brother Anthony I don't I got a long long speaker so that's it I have praise God [Applause] for the first time I noticed it while the brother was reading the scriptures that says and God's fake unto Joshua the Son of God right and I told him I'm going to speak unto you then I realized that when you go to Exodus you know the radicals Numbers Deuteronomy everywhere is saying and God spake unto Moses saying just us but now God is telling Joshua there's a change here I'm not going to talk to you Moses is now dead so I'm going to talk to you and we want to thank God for this new generation that we have here that Moses is dead and that the Holy Spirit has chosen this generation that he will speak through them and he there will be his voice to all that are around praise the Lord because remember we still have to carry on end time evangelism an end time evangelism is to what to the last of the elect that may still be out there but to souls that are imprisoned now they still have to have a witness praise the Lord so that word comes in this Joshua generation I call it that God is using and will go and is going to use even more and it's going to unfold but let's end it there and let the Lord Jesus have his way thank God for anointing all these brothers using them in various individual ways to express himself for his glory and honor God bless your brother Anthony you're gonna amen the move is on we need
