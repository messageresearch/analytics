[19:30] testifies amen that I'm a part of it
[19:33] Hallelujah not because I come to church
[19:35] not because I'm a good church member or

[19:42] grace amen hallelujah glory to God Amen
[19:48] we want to continue in the series The
[19:49] Power of tradition part three there's
[19:52] going to be another part to
[19:54] this um we um we're going to just be
[19:59] looking
[20:01] tonight uh the the title here is come
[20:04] deeper into the truth my bride the last
[20:07] service we preached was come out of her
[20:09] my bride but now it's come deeper into
[20:12] the truth my bride amen hallelujah glory
[20:17] to God Amen so just recapping a little
[20:20] bit here before we read our
[20:23] scripture in the last two Services Jesus
[20:26] said You shall know the truth and the
[20:29] truth shall make you free Hallelujah and
[20:32] that's what that's the truth that God is
[20:34] revealing to his bride and that's the
[20:37] truth that is calling us to come into
[20:41] Hallelujah see when the spirit of truth
[20:43] comes it will guide you and lead you
[20:46] into all truth that is the evidence we
[20:49] know of the Holy Ghost that you're born
[20:51] again that the spirit of truth comes it
[20:54] guides you it it do say it guides
[20:56] everybody it guides you you into all
[21:00] truth hallelujah amen we can see in the
[21:03] days of Jesus the Pharisees and
[21:06] Sadducees and the scribes created
[21:08] hundreds of traditions and the oral
[21:12] law and covered and made of none effect
[21:17] the Mosaic law and we see that when
[21:20] Jesus came they couldn't even recognize
[21:22] him because of all their Traditions now
[21:26] listen Spirits people die but Spirits
[21:29] don't die amen and like history repeats
[21:33] itself these are all being said here
[21:36] Amen to show you the day that we are
[21:39] living in because if you can't place
[21:42] this word in
[21:44] today in modern events being made clear
[21:48] by the word prophecies coming to pass
[21:51] then what are you doing you're living in
[21:53] a past
[21:55] age you're not living in the bright age
[21:58] and that's what we want to get into
[21:59] tonight passing from the seven Church
[22:02] ages and moving into the bride age amen
[22:07] hallelujah amen so we can see that we
[22:10] can see the Dark Ages the Roman Catholic
[22:13] Church bringing the nickan spirit
[22:17] Traditions Hallelujah dogmas and Creeds
[22:20] again amen bringing it back into the
[22:23] church the Dark Ages came it cut out the
[22:26] truth from the beginning and here we go
[22:28] again again Hallelujah and I emphasize
[22:31] that very importantly that that nicadan
[22:34] Spirit the conquered theity that Jesus
[22:37] himself said in the Book of Revelations
[22:40] I hate that Spirit
[22:43] also amen and we know that the Roman
[22:47] Catholic Church the denominations BR
[22:50] that in what's that have to do brother
[22:52] Tim with right now you're going to see
[22:54] what it has to do
[22:57] hallelujah amen
[23:00] amen then the spirit of God through
[23:02] Wesley Luther Wesley in Pentecost
[23:05] started to restore the word and at the
[23:08] end of the leosan church age remember at
[23:13] the end the prophet always comes at the
[23:16] end of the
[23:19] age all right amen he came at the end of
[23:24] the age to bring the bride into the
[23:27] fullness of the truth again again
[23:29] because the message started at Pentecost
[23:33] it started remember the message started
[23:36] in Pentecostal age that's where it
[23:40] started this message that we are all
[23:43] believe in and claiming to be the truth
[23:45] started in the Pentecostal age and grew
[23:49] and manifested in the Pentecostal
[23:54] age
[23:56] okay until the opening of The Seven
[24:01] Seals oh I did my research I know where
[24:04] I'm talk I know what I'm talking about
[24:06] until the opening of The Seven Seals and
[24:09] then the Pentecostal
[24:11] age died Dead Brother Braham says I am
[24:15] no longer after the seals a
[24:18] Pentecostal and I am no longer in the
[24:21] Pentecostal
[24:22] age done over with
[24:27] Hallelujah
[24:29] Hallelujah and when that changed it went
[24:33] from the seven Church age into eternity
[24:36] or brother bradam says many times the
[24:39] Eternal Church age or the bride
[24:42] age the rapturing age all these
[24:47] things oh
[24:49] Hallelujah and it became amen but people
[24:52] are still feeding off the Pentecostal
[24:56] age message
[24:59] what listening to the tapes listening to
[25:03] things in the message that we call the
[25:06] message of the hour feeding off of a
[25:09] Pentecostal
[25:11] age you know who people don't like this
[25:14] kind of preaching is people who preach
[25:17] and still under the influence in this
[25:19] message
[25:24] Pentecostal
[25:27] Hallelujah but here we got we got the
[25:29] message of the hour to
[25:32] recognize that the age has changed and
[25:36] God has turned a corner brother Bram
[25:39] says You must recognize when God turns
[25:42] the corner amen amen God turns the
[25:46] corner
[25:47] Hallelujah constantly turning the corner
[25:51] amen let us turn in our scriptures now
[25:54] to First
[25:56] Corinthians that was the recap a little
[26:00] let us get into the little bit of the
[26:01] message
[26:03] tonight what I want to do in the next
[26:05] two messages is like I said slowly show
[26:10] you coming out of the leoan age coming
[26:13] into the Rapture age and then the next
[26:16] message I really want to get into it's
[26:17] taken me a lot of studying to do it but
[26:20] really get into the message as whole and
[26:22] show you two parts of the message one
[26:25] part in the message where people are
[26:27] living in the Leo in acting behaving and
[26:30] manifesting the spirit of the of the
[26:33] Pentecostal age and then the ones that
[26:36] is living in the bride Age The Eternal
[26:38] Church age by the doctrines and the
[26:41] teachings that are going around amen 1
[26:45] Corinthians
[26:47] 2:9
[26:50] 29-13 but as it is
[26:53] written eyes have not seen nor ears
[26:57] heard neither has it entered into the
[27:00] heart of man the things which God had
[27:03] prepared for them that love him we use
[27:06] that scripture a lot amen eyes haven't
[27:10] seen ears haven't heard what's it hasn't
[27:13] even enter into the hearts but let's go
[27:16] to verse 10
[27:18] here
[27:20] but
[27:22] but
[27:25] God had revealed unto them unto
[27:31] us by his spirit for the spirit
[27:35] searcheth all things yay the Deep things
[27:38] of God so God is saying
[27:41] but God has revealed those things that
[27:45] eyes haven't seen ears haven't heard in
[27:48] this hour God has revealed it to
[27:52] us
[27:55] hallelujah for what man knoweth the
[27:58] things of man save the spirit of man
[28:01] which is in him even so the things of
[28:04] God knoweth no man but the spirit of God
[28:08] now we have received not the spirit of
[28:11] the world but the spirit which is of god
[28:15] that we might know the things that are
[28:19] freely given to us by God hallelujah
[28:23] that we may
[28:25] know not be in dis deceived or not be uh
[28:30] uh in in uh kept blind but we shall know
[28:34] this is the hour this is the day that we
[28:37] shall know all
[28:40] things which things also we speak not in
[28:44] Words which men's wisdom teaches but
[28:47] which the Holy Ghost teaches comparing
[28:50] spiritual things with
[28:52] spiritual Hebrews
[28:56] 10:19 Hallelujah
[29:01] amen so next time anybody says eyes
[29:05] haven't seen ears haven't heard just say
[29:08] but God has
[29:10] revealed Hallelujah but God has re maybe
[29:14] your eyes don't see your ears don't hear
[29:16] but God has revealed to somebody the
[29:19] bride Hallelujah Hebrews 10 19 having
[29:24] therefore Brethren us boldness to enter
[29:30] into the holiest by the blood of

[52:43] without
[52:44] Revelation
[52:47] Hallelujah every false Doctrine now
[52:50] listen Hallelujah every false Doctrine
[52:53] starts out with a scripture or a quote
[52:55] from Brother bradam
[52:57] that's where it starts from just like
[52:59] Eve in the Garden of Eden he ain't going
[53:02] to start making some kind of you know
[53:03] some somebody out there some stupidness
[53:06] that they're Elijah and this and that
[53:08] they're going to call the heavens and
[53:09] all that you can see through that but no
[53:11] it starts with a scripture and a quote
[53:14] from Brother brandom Hallelujah and then
[53:18] it starts with man interpreting
[53:20] it Hallelujah Satan quoting to Eve
[53:24] Revelations 22:18 we have no new
[53:27] revelation the message we have received
[53:30] is not only brother brandom's message

[53:37] the prophet lived this message and now
[53:40] the bride is living and displaying the
[53:43] same token that the messenger displayed
[53:47] how can it be any different how can God
[53:51] have respect to a

[54:00] being a prophet to the age to restore
[54:03] the word but remember that message the
[54:06] word comes to a prophet he's not just
[54:10] the word the word had to come to the
[54:13] prophet and the same word that came to
[54:16] the prophet and manifested through the
[54:18] prophet that same word was spoken out to

[58:40] meaning of his word is to seriously
[58:44] misinterpret the author's
[58:47] meaning very
[58:49] important God is his own interpreter he
[58:53] will make it plain to you he will reveal
[58:57] it and when he reveals it like brother
[58:59] BR says when Jesus Christ reveals
[59:02] anything any truth of himself you'll be
[59:05] able to see it from Genesis right to
[59:08] Revelations amen it'll line right up
[59:12] there will be no
[59:13] contradiction Hallelujah and you'll know
[59:16] with inside yourself it was a spirit
[59:19] that revealed it not

[59:36] wrong
[59:37] season amen using the very Bible using
[59:41] the very
[59:42] quotes you think about it if most of the

[59:51] seals and I'm no longer a
[59:54] Pentecostal you using those quotes to
[59:57] try to Perfect The Bride of Jesus Christ

[1:00:05] serpent seed is some nuggets the church
[1:00:07] ages are some nuggets they're all the
[1:00:09] true doctrines of Christ but remember

[1:00:16] brother bradam go look it up write these
[1:00:17] things down and and and and she said to

[1:00:29] people go that way and to make people go
[1:00:31] down straight down the road you mean in
[1:00:34] the message of the hour on the tapes on
[1:00:37] the books there are things that are
[1:00:39] deliberately said from God to make
[1:00:41] people go this way that way and the
[1:00:43] bride Knows by The Spirit right down the
[1:00:45] middle because of Revelation brother
[1:00:47] Brandon says yes God deliberately made
[1:00:51] me say things and God did
[1:00:54] it don't get mad at
[1:00:58] me you can go look all the stuff up
[1:01:01] don't get mad at me

[1:01:20] and it it would go on in each and every
[1:01:22] one of us if it wasn't for the spirit of
[1:01:24] God it's the spirit of God that keep
[1:01:25] Keeps Us straight brother Bram said did
[1:01:28] he not say if the angel did not come in
[1:01:30] the room every night when those seals
[1:01:31] were being open I would have preached
[1:01:33] this I would have preached that I didn't
[1:01:34] know what it was I preached love for
[1:01:37] many years that that was the evidence of
[1:01:38] the Holy Ghost until an angel comes and
[1:01:40] tells you that when the spirit of truth
[1:01:42] comes it'll guide you and lead you to
[1:01:44] all truth that is the evidence of the
[1:01:45] Holy Ghost
[1:01:47] hallelujah
[1:01:49] amen the importance of Revelation to a
[1:01:53] True Believer hug
[1:01:56] nice quotes
[1:01:58] amen
[1:01:59] hallelujah glory to God he shows her her
[1:02:03] Word of Life she receives it she never
[1:02:05] doubts it therefore nothing can harm her
[1:02:09] he shows
[1:02:11] her that's why she never doubts it
[1:02:14] that's why she receives it because why
[1:02:16] he shows her he reveals it to her by
[1:02:21] Revelation
[1:02:24] Hallelujah that's why the most important
[1:02:26] thing that we seek for is the spirit of
[1:02:30] Revelation Hallelujah not the gifts
[1:02:34] Hallelujah The Giver of the gifts
[1:02:37] Hallelujah not a possession Hallelujah
[1:02:41] not a an authority or anything we seek
[1:02:45] Him The Giver of the gifts the Holy

[1:02:52] experience I didn't stop Hallelujah and
[1:02:55] till I got him and I knew I got him I
[1:02:59] knew things how did I know how did I
[1:03:03] know I knew what I was seeing was
[1:03:06] different than a lot of people moving
[1:03:08] around the messes moving around the
[1:03:10] churches fellowshipping here and there I
[1:03:12] see people seeing the same thing and I
[1:03:14] see people not seeing the same thing and
[1:03:17] at the beginning you're going am I
[1:03:18] seeing something weird or different or
[1:03:21] you know you go through that when you're
[1:03:23] mature and you're growing up am I seen
[1:03:25] something something different or weird
[1:03:26] like why am I seeing this I still get
[1:03:29] that to this day things are still
[1:03:31] breaking on me to this day that's
[1:03:32] separating me that's what it's doing to
[1:03:35] the Bride of Jesus Christ it's
[1:03:36] constantly separating that's what the
[1:03:38] word does it separates and separates
[1:03:41] Hallelujah and when that Separation by
[1:03:43] Revelation is taken place then the other
[1:03:46] parts of the body of Jesus Christ they
[1:03:48] are being separated and in the Paradox
[1:03:52] in separation for the bride there's
[1:03:55] uniting
[1:03:56] Hallelujah uniting under the same
[1:03:59] Revelation under the same umbrella not
[1:04:02] we're all one big family we're all one

[1:04:07] the Revelation no when you're separated

[1:04:36] what he wants done with the word so she
[1:04:39] doesn't misplace it she doesn't
[1:04:42] dislocate it she doesn't misrepresent it
[1:04:45] she knows what he wants done with the
[1:04:47] word oh by your own intellect no no no

[1:05:24] life it changes you Hallelujah it
[1:05:27] changes you it makes you different it
[1:05:29] makes you live Revelation makes you live
[1:05:32] this word and people don't understand
[1:05:35] that very few in the message understand
[1:05:38] that they think it's knowledge but
[1:05:41] Revelation is not knowledge it's life it
[1:05:45] makes you live this
[1:05:47] word and become part of it
[1:05:51] Hallelujah they took in Jesus teachings
[1:05:54] and made certain doct doin they took uh
[1:05:57] the Apostle Paul's teachings and made
[1:05:59] doctrines out of them they're doing the
[1:06:01] same today they're taking William bram's
[1:06:03] teachings and making their own doctrines
[1:06:05] and traditions the spoken word is the
[1:06:07] Original Seed you can't mix that word
[1:06:10] with dogmas and Creeds the Apostle Paul
[1:06:13] said all that I have learned that people
[1:06:16] hold on to to the past and do not let it
[1:06:20] go but they add it to the new oh there's
[1:06:24] a lot of going on they don't die out
[1:06:29] Paul said I had to die to everything I
[1:06:32] knew I couldn't bring over the Old
[1:06:34] Testament I couldn't bring over the law
[1:06:37] I had to die to that so I can see the
[1:06:40] new the New Testament too many people
[1:06:44] bring
[1:06:45] over hallelujah oh I was in
[1:06:50] Pentecost and maybe Pentecost is still
[1:06:52] in
[1:06:53] you oh I was a cathic
[1:06:56] but I'm no longer Catholic anymore
[1:06:59] there's no Catholic in me now Hallelujah
[1:07:01] I've crossed over the Riven Veil where
[1:07:04] the glories never fail I've passed
[1:07:06] through that Riven Veil I passed through
[1:07:08] the inner Veil Hallelujah into the
[1:07:10] holies of holies I know Hallelujah I
[1:07:14] know my redeemer liveth I know
[1:07:16] Hallelujah and that's like you you shall

[1:07:41] they didn't die out Hallelujah they
[1:07:43] weren't given the grace Hallelujah
[1:07:46] election predestination in this hour to
[1:07:48] die out to let go Hallelujah get rid of
[1:07:52] the old they're
[1:07:54] bursting Hallelujah most of us are aware
[1:07:57] of the Ten Commandments now listen
[1:08:00] Hallelujah that God gave Moses I want to
[1:08:02] point out something here to you all
[1:08:05] those Ten Commandments which you have
[1:08:07] have noticed up there until now if you
[1:08:10] haven't noticed up until now if we
[1:08:12] understand that we see a little bit of
[1:08:14] the reason why God gave the law even
[1:08:17] though he knew that the law could never
[1:08:19] lead people to become spiritual or live
[1:08:22] a Godly life in fact Hebrews 86
[1:08:26] we see very clearly that the old
[1:08:28] Covenant was faulty this is the word
[1:08:32] used in that old Covenant the law was
[1:08:36] faulty God did God give us something
[1:08:39] faulty did he make a mistake he
[1:08:41] certainly didn't he knew the end from
[1:08:44] the beginning he gave it with a purpose
[1:08:46] for our help for help to us to see our
[1:08:50] need the law was given to expose sin we
[1:08:54] could also say that the law was given to
[1:08:56] test
[1:08:57] man to see how many people would be
[1:09:01] satisfied with the
[1:09:04] external oh my my brothers and sisters
[1:09:07] the test man to expose sin to test you
[1:09:13] to test the people that are legalistic
[1:09:15] living by the law in this message that
[1:09:19] want to live by an external not an
[1:09:21] internal but an external life is a test
[1:09:25] my brothers and sisters to see how many
[1:09:28] people would be satisfied with an
[1:09:29] external righteousness that God brought
[1:09:32] honor to man and how man would seek God
[1:09:36] for the inner Purity which alone pleases
[1:09:39] God hallelujah we see that going on
[1:09:42] right now my brothers and sisters people
[1:09:44] living off the
[1:09:46] external Hallelujah and not going for
[1:09:50] the inner the inner Purity now listen in
[1:09:54] the Old Testament time Tabernacle God
[1:09:56] illustrated by putting a thick curtain
[1:09:58] between the holy place and the most holy
[1:10:01] place called The Veil he told the
[1:10:03] Israelites nobody can come into this
[1:10:05] Most Holy place the veil blocks you you
[1:10:08] can come for come so far but no farther
[1:10:12] Beyond the Veil of God himself living in
[1:10:15] that Temple the Old Testament Temple
[1:10:18] nobody could go there even the high
[1:10:20] priest couldn't go only what once a year
[1:10:23] and that was only as a token but nobody
[1:10:26] could ever go there whenever they
[1:10:29] liked but when Jesus died on Calvary the
[1:10:32] veil was rent from torn from top to
[1:10:35] bottom showing that the way of God's
[1:10:38] presence was open so let me ask you now
[1:10:41] that Veil is torn and the way into the
[1:10:44] most holy place in God's presence is
[1:10:46] open should our standard of Life be
[1:10:50] higher or
[1:10:54] lower
[1:10:56] than the people of the Old
[1:10:58] Testament the answer is clear if without
[1:11:02] personal fellowship with god with just
[1:11:05] the law people can come to a certain
[1:11:08] standard of
[1:11:09] life but how much higher of a standard
[1:11:13] should there be once when you come into
[1:11:15] Fellowship behind that veil with God
[1:11:17] himself behind that torn Veil yet many
[1:11:21] and many Christians don't seem to
[1:11:25] understand
[1:11:26] that don't seem to get
[1:11:29] it Matthew 13:11 because it's given to
[1:11:33] you to know the mysteries of the kingdom
[1:11:35] of heaven but it's not given to them to
[1:11:39] know this is our day my brothers and
[1:11:41] sisters Hallelujah this is here I'm not
[1:11:46] preaching denomination out there I'm
[1:11:48] preaching here the only way that we're
[1:11:50] going to be build faith is we got to
[1:11:52] preach it today the day that we are
[1:11:54] living in
[1:11:56] we should never live under our
[1:11:57] privileges as we are today the great
[1:12:00] powers of God lay Within Reach of every
[1:12:02] member of the body of
[1:12:06] Christ things you desire When you pray
[1:12:08] believe you receive them and you shall
[1:12:10] have them and it shall be given unto you
[1:12:13] you remember when Jesus was speaking to
[1:12:16] the Pharisees he told them you people
[1:12:21] who just clean the outward of the cup
[1:12:23] but don't see your hearts
[1:12:25] and he wants the inside of that cup
[1:12:29] cleanse you people will do all the right
[1:12:32] things externally so people are
[1:12:36] impressed but God sees deep within he
[1:12:39] looks into the inner Purity inner
[1:12:42] motives we can see the Pharisees like
[1:12:45] Adam covering with fig leaves do you
[1:12:47] know from the previous study that there
[1:12:50] is a curse upon that you know that there
[1:12:54] is a curse upon cursed is everybody who
[1:12:57] do not live the law but Jesus came and
[1:13:02] took that curse if we don't take what
[1:13:06] Jesus did we don't take his atonement
[1:13:09] and we try to live that law we tried to
[1:13:12] be legalistic we are actually taking on
[1:13:16] that
[1:13:24] curse
[1:13:27] from the previous study y that is that
[1:13:29] is why you find that Jesus was in
[1:13:32] constant conflict with the
[1:13:34] Pharisees the spirit was always in
[1:13:37] constant conflict and a True Believer
[1:13:40] will be always in a constant struggle in
[1:13:43] the spirit with somebody who lives by
[1:13:45] the law somebody who
[1:13:48] outwardly they don't they're they're
[1:13:50] deceived they don't see it outwardly
[1:13:53] live in righteousness but
[1:13:57] inwardly
[1:13:58] Hallelujah there's a constant conflict
[1:14:01] the Pharisees who kept the letter of the
[1:14:04] low down to the Last Detail those
[1:14:07] doctrines were so correct that we read
[1:14:10] that even Jesus now listen told even his
[1:14:13] disciples to follow the teachings of the
[1:14:17] Pharisees Matthew 23 write it down 2 and
[1:14:22] 3 have you noticed that he said because
[1:14:25] whatever they say is right the only
[1:14:29] thing he said is that they do not do
[1:14:33] what they teach they don't follow their
[1:14:35] own example in their life because
[1:14:38] they're teaching things that they don't
[1:14:41] practice so there you are nothing wrong
[1:14:44] with the doctrines of the
[1:14:46] Pharisees but they don't
[1:14:49] live what they
[1:14:51] teach oh there's nothing wrong with the
[1:14:53] doctrines of the message message people
[1:14:56] can take it and take it but they don't
[1:14:59] live what they
[1:15:02] teach
[1:15:04] hallelujah
[1:15:07] amen they didn't have the Holy Spirit in
[1:15:09] the Old Testament times and yet Paul
[1:15:12] could say I have lived now listen I have
[1:15:16] lived with a good conscience before God
[1:15:18] from my childhood up until this day
[1:15:21] think about it no Holy Spirit but I've
[1:15:25] lived with a good
[1:15:26] conscience acts 23:1 Paul's saying that
[1:15:31] the Rich Young Ruler when Jesus pointed
[1:15:34] out these Commandments to him he said I
[1:15:37] have kept all of these from my childhood
[1:15:39] up Mark
[1:15:41] 10:20 I've kept them all Mark Paul says
[1:15:45] I have a good
[1:15:46] conscience that I'm pure that I kept it
[1:15:49] all the laws of God the Ten
[1:15:53] Commandments it was possible for a
[1:15:56] God-fearing person to keep these
[1:15:58] Commandments without the help of the
[1:15:59] Holy Spirit just by his own
[1:16:03] strength what did it mean today people
[1:16:06] talking taking the Law and making their
[1:16:08] own traditions and to make an outward
[1:16:11] man look good but the inward Man is dead
[1:16:15] hiding behind the message of the hour
[1:16:19] hiding behind truth taking the Law same
[1:16:22] as Paul did before this conversion
[1:16:25] the Rich Young Ruler but listen those
[1:16:29] were nine Commandments but the 10th
[1:16:32] commandment we look at the 10th
[1:16:34] commandment and what was the 10th
[1:16:37] commandment it wasn't external it was
[1:16:41] internal it dealt with something
[1:16:44] inward that commandment was you shall
[1:16:48] not lust or Covenant or strongly desire
[1:16:52] all these three words mean the same
[1:16:54] unold unfortunately lust has got an evil
[1:16:56] Association in people's minds but all it
[1:16:59] is means is a strong desire like it says
[1:17:02] in Galatians 5:17 the SP Holy Spirit
[1:17:06] lusts against the flesh what does that
[1:17:09] mean the Holy Spirit does not do
[1:17:12] evil it has got a strong desire against
[1:17:15] the opposite which is the flesh it Wars
[1:17:18] against one another and the flesh has
[1:17:21] got a strong desire against the holy
[1:17:23] spirit so here is think about it my
[1:17:26] brothers and sisters here it
[1:17:29] is Paul the Rich Young Ruler in the
[1:17:33] message you can
[1:17:35] live but at the same time the inward
[1:17:39] there's a struggle with the Holy Spirit
[1:17:42] there's a conflict you mean that there
[1:17:43] are people in conflict in war with the
[1:17:47] Holy Spirit believe in the same message
[1:17:50] of the hour quoting the same quotes
[1:17:53] going to the same message Church
[1:17:55] and living in that constant
[1:18:00] battle oh
[1:18:02] yes Colossians 2:6 beware lest any man
[1:18:06] spoil you through philosophy and vain
[1:18:08] deceit after the traditions of man after
[1:18:11] the ruent of this world not after Christ
[1:18:14] the power of tradition of traditional
[1:18:17] teaching stops you from going deeper in
[1:18:20] revealing of the word in your
[1:18:23] position oh tradition closes the door to
[1:18:26] your heart the Holy Spirit cannot come
[1:18:28] into into your experience when you place
[1:18:32] and believes in something else than the
[1:18:34] revealed
[1:18:36] word what is the revealed word you say
[1:18:38] brother Tim I believe the r you don't
[1:18:41] see and understand the revealed word
[1:18:43] until he reveals it to you that's the
[1:18:47] problem I believe the reveal word I
[1:18:50] believe I see the problem is my brothers
[1:18:52] and sisters where people are dis not
[1:18:55] knowing that they're under this curse
[1:18:57] under this fulfilling this is that they
[1:19:02] think they got to reveal word because
[1:19:05] they can listen to the tapes and they
[1:19:06] can understand what's being said but
[1:19:10] that's not what he's saying here
[1:19:12] Traditions blocks you from receiving the
[1:19:16] revealed
[1:19:17] word it blocks you from staying in a
[1:19:20] position a condition that you're waiting
[1:19:24] upon God God those who wait upon the
[1:19:27] Lord shall renew their strength by what
[1:19:29] by faith it's staying in a place where
[1:19:33] you're waiting on God not following
[1:19:36] Traditions not following the law not
[1:19:39] following the out outward
[1:19:42] appearance but waiting in his
[1:19:45] Spirit a life in his presence waiting
[1:19:49] for the revealed word to come listen the
[1:19:53] revealed word you can say
[1:19:55] in letters that you understand is here
[1:19:57] it's here in the message the seals have
[1:19:59] been open but listen have they been open
[1:20:01] to
[1:20:02] you they might be here but are they
[1:20:05] revealed to you is the revealed word
[1:20:07] being revealed to you or are you
[1:20:10] blocking
[1:20:11] it are you blocking it with Traditions
[1:20:14] are you blocking it with external living
[1:20:17] and
[1:20:18] law believ in the same
[1:20:23] things or are you waiting are you
[1:20:26] waiting in his
[1:20:29] presence do I know everything no I'm
[1:20:33] waiting constantly for that word to be
[1:20:36] constantly being revealed to me over and
[1:20:39] over and I can see when you're in that
[1:20:42] position you can discern when the Devil
[1:20:45] comes and tempts you like he did Eve and
[1:20:47] take the word and try to get you off of
[1:20:50] where you need to be in that place in a
[1:20:53] certain place with
[1:20:56] God so he can reveal what he needs to
[1:20:59] reveal to
[1:21:00] you Satan blocking what God wants to do
[1:21:04] hindering what God wants to do in your
[1:21:06] life what he wants to reveal to you
[1:21:09] that's the battle that's the greatest
[1:21:12] battle that's ever being fought right
[1:21:13] now that's the battle in the
[1:21:16] mind never been an age so deceiving as
[1:21:19] this age never been the opposition the
[1:21:23] distractions of this age like we me and
[1:21:26] you each and every one of us here are
[1:21:28] fighting tonight to be in that place
[1:21:31] with God to wait upon the revealed word
[1:21:35] to be revealed to us as individuals so
[1:21:38] that we know how to walk not walking by
[1:21:41] the law not walking by by the legalist
[1:21:43] of spirits or any other Spirit thinking
[1:21:46] we're righteous thinking we have a good
[1:21:49] conscience like Paul like the like the
[1:21:51] Rich Young Ruler I've kept it all from
[1:21:53] my childhood
[1:21:55] Hood I've obeyed everything in the
[1:21:58] message let me try to wind this down I
[1:22:01] got so much I'm just going to continue
[1:22:03] in the
[1:22:04] next but God wants this to be brought
[1:22:09] out the law is not going to reveal to
[1:22:11] the bride who she is in this
[1:22:14] hour it's going to take the opening of
[1:22:17] those seals those Mysteries being
[1:22:20] revealed to show her who she
[1:22:22] is that's why we go deep Deep In
[1:22:25] Christ that's why the
[1:22:28] treasures that's where the treasures are
[1:22:31] when she recognizes who she is then she
[1:22:35] goes deep and deeper and deeper as God
[1:22:39] is bringing her deeper the open of those
[1:22:42] Seven Seals was the beginning of the
