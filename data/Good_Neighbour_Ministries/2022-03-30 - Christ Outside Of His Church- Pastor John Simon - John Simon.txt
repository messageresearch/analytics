the seventh church age and to its end has come to its end and god is doing a great work in building uh his body and finishing his bride as the harvest ripens for the going home so you must understand that what we had in our minds as this is the way to carry on church or that is the way to carry on church those were cultures religious cultures pictures given to us by the denominations and by the spirit of the system so god is now changing us in our way of thinking and our way of worship and everything so things are going to be totally different not what i am going to do changes i am going to make but god is making changes and what it'll flow into i don't know but it's flowing right now so be conscious of what god is doing and relax don't try to put on makeup or do anything just be who you are right and let the holy spirit have his way praise the lord well do you have a bible close to you although they they project the scriptures up theirs but if you do have a bible wit you will be nice because it'll be great for us i'm glad to see you here in the house of god tonight our topic will be christ outside of his church christ outside his church and our scripture is revelation chapter 3. verses 20 to 22. let's read from god's word it says here behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear me my voice and open the door i will come in to him and i will sup with him and he with me praise god father thank you again for the reading of your word and bless us tonight as we think upon these things we ask it in the name of jesus christ amen and amen the lord bless you please be seated what a picture what a a very tragic and revealing picture of christ outside of his church i don't know if any of you ever seen of course there's artists have painted many pictures like that of jesus standing outside the door and knocking on the door trying to go in well that might not be the correct conception but the idea right that he's knocking on the door to come in just to think that it's tragic especially now that we've got the revelation that we can clearly see the unrecognized presence of god they when we look at that picture to see him outside of his house outside of his church like that we we see another picture here of the rejected king just as david was rejected by his own here he is rejected now while we're talking remember think of christ outside of his church as the word outside of the church the truth outside of the church right this is what we have come to in the laodicean church age for the word of god that they're supposed to be worshipping becomes the fulfillment of the scripture they honor me with their lips but they have no revelation so their hearts are far from me so in actual fact all the worshiping is going on all this stuff is going on but uh the word of god itself is outside of the church it's not there the rejected king and they have him outside also because they're ashamed of him they're ashamed of him the the things we talk about so normally and casually they will be ashamed to speak of such things they wouldn't want to speak about the garden of eden they can't even start from the beginning to start to unveil the word of god they don't want to talk about that they don't want to talk about the godhead it exposes them they don't want you see you go down and it's an exposure so they don't want to talk about those things amen look at this terrible picture of christ outside of his own church now is this a stranger that's why you don't open the door is it someone that you're unfamiliar with or is it some some body that come by to visit your house but you don't want them to come in because they can cause you a whole lot of trouble so you shut the door and pull the blinds and you keep quiet in the house so that they'll go away is this what they have done to him christ jesus the word of god in this hour so is this a stranger knocking on the door or are they afraid that this is a robber that has come in the middle of the night because this is the odyssey and so uh less scared because a robber has come like that but they don't know the real robbers in the house that's why he is outside the house now here it it's the truth amen praise god or is it the good man of the house come to the householder he has come to his own house and he's locked out he is put out he's unwanted my goodness i want you to see friends john chapter 1 where the bible tells us matter of fact why don't we just john 1 10 to 12. can you put that up if you can place it up there brother and we'll read it together if you don't mind hallelujah he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not amen he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he the power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name praise god hallelujah now he came to his own and they received him not you already see where the truth is winding from then to now they received him not so he goes back to the door knocking at the end of the age they received him not they don't want him they don't want to receive the word of god that was sent to them praise god back then of course he was in flesh now he is back in the word form and they don't recognize that change that transformation which means they had no revelation because you recognize the word and whatever form it comes to you once your eyes of your heart has been opened towards him amen and what he is doing you'll see god you'll recognize what god is doing listen to this messenger for our age brother branham now there was a great deal of confusion over this verse because there were so many personal workers who used this in personal evangelism as lord jesus were at the heart's door of every sinner and knocking for admission it would then be said that if the sinner opened the door the lord would come in the whole message has a is a consummation to this age for he was he was not speaking to individual sinners for verse 22 says i'm still quoting he that had an ear to hear let him hear what the spirit saith or is saying on to the churches so it's the church that he's talking to and and saying you've closed your doors against me you don't want to receive me and now at the end of these church ages we'll come to the last one i'll be there still knocking on the door he's been knocking all through the edges but now he'll be knocking on the door giving you a last chance to open the door and to let him in and still they have the door shut and they will not let him in now in this i perceive that there is uh misinterpretations of the word given out because if that saying that this is uh speaking to the individual sinner and not about the church i want you understand that right here you can see the strategy of satan because it's partially true that he's speaking to the individual sinner but that is not the that is not the overall truth of what he's addressing at this point in time he is speaking to his church now what is a lie brother branham made it clear a lie is not a complete falsehood where you can tell someone well uh you know really that plane that's passing is not really a plane do you know that that's a certain kind of bird where i see you laugh because now that that you see nobody will why would they tell a lie like that right but you see brother branham said a lie a relay is always mixed with a little bit of truth just enough to cause you to believe it's always mixed with a tincture of truth that brings an element of doubt that cause you to believe so what satan did is take the literal word of him when he's speaking in this verse if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him will suck with him and he with me amen see he took that and the lie he's telling now is the lie of destruction because he distracted the people's thought processes from thinking about the whole body of christ the whole church to thinking about themselves as individuals and when they do that that's partial truth especially it's not a lie special truth just like he said um you know uh you know you can turn those stones to bread it's the truth isn't it but it was a temptation it said oh if you throw yourself off the mountain the angels will come and be it's the truth but it's only partial truth you know it's not it's just like god says if thou drink us any deadly thing it shall not hurt thee so brother grab a bottle of poison no see when you go deliberately doing that you were not commanded you were not ordered the spirit didn't lead you to do that you're not in a a process of of of work for the lord and then you found that somebody tried to poison you so god defends you that's a different thing so that's always certain strategy from the very beginning of mixing a little truth with error to defile to deceive to distract to cause you to doubt in every possible way is what he normally does so you got a ball of truth a dish of truth and he gives you a dash of misdirection mix that whole thing and you partake of it you're a million miles off because you fail to recognize that little dash of truth that he placed inside of there oh my praise god all he wants to do is put a little bit of theological misinterpretation and he unbalances that person beyond anything but the basic truth is this verse is intended for the body of christ for the church and this picture is showing us a picture of the church in the last day this edition church age has come to the place of apostasy where they have as second first thessalonians says falling away for they shall come of falling away first falling away from what what you're going to fall away from the word amen repent go back to where you you fall from amen praise god where did they fall from the word praise god so god is saying to them that this church as it nears the end praise god don't let satan deceive you that this is just about one individual person this is not about one individual person though it can be applied that way this is for the entire church of god hallelujah now he doesn't you know god doesn't explain nothing he just makes a statement and that's a the holy spirit will then break it to you just say something just say one word amen praise god and the holy spirit then opens it up so in there when you look at that scripture he's already seen you can tell now that he can see the effects of the evil and the poison of of denomination organization and systems of what they're going to do they're going to push out the truth of of god's word completely why because satan is trying to accomplish what he did in heaven he's trying to accomplish here on the earth he tried to undermine god's kingdom up there he's trying to undermine the truth down here he's trying to support the kingdom up there whisper campaign and propaganda among the angels first and then he was ready to move michael just first of all how foolish you're dealing with the creator and you think you're going to do something that he don't know about when he's omniscient omnipresent and everywhere this just shows you how he's so intelligent and smart on one hand like einstein but so dumb he doesn't know how to pull up his socks right so it goes that way now here we come and we understand that this tells you that he is outside of the church hebrews chapter 13 verses 12 and 14. praise god hebrews 13 12 to 14. wherefore jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate outside of the church there's in hebrews already it's telling you he suffered outside the gate now of course you know there's types through the bible right on to calvary outside of jerusalem on golgotha's hill and so on it's always the case but so suffer outside the gate and there it was that he might cleanse his people let us go forth therefore come out the church come out the organization come out the system let us go forth therefore unto him the word praise god without the camp bearing the reproach praise god hallelujah because they already have their systems all set up and then you are going to tell them there is something else out there different from what we have bigger and better and you know it's the truth but who are you you're not a theologian how can you tell us who are trained men that have the knowledge of theologians that have added added books and books and knowledge for hundreds of years and you just come and tell us you got the truth you heard the truth and you believe the truth and you're leaving the church you see it's like a a paradox to them right so think of the scripture telling you here let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp outside the camp bearing his reproach for here we have no continuing city but we seek one to come oh thanks be to god here we have no continuing city all the great cities i was looking online and seeing many many great cities covered in ash covered in sand you call them names they're digging them out now pompeii whether it's over in egypt they're digging out the artifacts and cities that were great mighty cities in those days amen there were metropolises ah when i used to read of those things well a city back then will have maybe five ten thousand people no i stood on a mountain in italy and watched uh pompeii it extended for miles i couldn't even see the end it was like to the horizon so it there's millions of people in that city they already have so we think oh we got new york we got this we got oh they had it already it maybe didn't look like this but they already had it there is nothing new under the sun think about it my goodness i saw they had pipes made of lead or some kind of metal but they had pipes they had indoor toilets they had all those things the romans had that already so we got nothing new under the sun whatsoever so we can trust him this time this thought you can also expand on it so when jesus called the believer where he's calling the people right now peter if you believe me who i say i am step out of that ship that you're in just step out walk on the word walk walk on the water and that's going to show you your real faith do you believe this word you believe the promise do you have a quiet faith in this promise of this prophet amen what a message i'm so happy for this message we don't have to be like baal's prophets we don't have to like the prophet said you don't have to bang and to bring him down you don't have to scream the loudness and jump as high as you can he said you better live as high as you're jumping or live higher than you're jumping amen you see we don't have to do that praise god but when the holy spirit hits your soul you want to rejoice you yourself don't know how you're going to rejoice one time you might rejoice by laughing the next time you might be crying the next night me running might be jumping it might be throwing your hands up suddenly you don't know what your reaction is going to be but you are going to rejoice when you see the word of god hallelujah praise be to god amen yes jesus christ left out of the church amen hallelujah amen why because they took the creed instead of christ is that right they took creeds instead of jesus christ and wrapped themselves up and tangled themselves up in all those lines uh like that and uh uh instead of the holy spirit uh amen there's an there's a saying that said that era lies have taken the throne and they throw uh pushed the truth off i'm not giving the exact quotes but i but i've heard that them saying it in this modern time but that's the very fact that uh the holy spirit has been deposed so that popes can be enthroned is that right the holy spirit they put him out of the leadership of their lives and they brought themselves under the leadership of popes administrators supervisors bishops bishoprics and whatever else systems of organization because the people love the discipline of systems do you know that that's how this world has been acculturated and trained is to accept systems because everything is predictable once you come out the system it's not predictable and they don't like that you find that even now you got the internet they have it all set up you got to go according to these lines if all of a sudden said no i i don't really want uh google because they're looking into all my stuff and you cut through trying to put it off your phone or your your tablet and you see what's going to happen with you how your stuff will start mess up and stuff it doesn't matter whether it's microsoft google or apple or whoever it is then all of a sudden your stuff isn't working the way it's supposed to work right because you are now uh getting outside the system and once you get out the system they don't know what you are doing and they don't know what you can do right and it gets them nervous they want you to remain within the confines of that system so that you can become predictable but sons and daughters of god are not predictable for sons and daughters as the wind lord where it lists them no man knows where it goes so the sons of god and daughters of god that's the way they are and that's how the holy spirit places it in their heart amen remember elijah going to the king and god told him go to him and tell him that um you know make your will make up your will and make things right because you're going to sleep with your fathers and you know the story of hezekiah how he went to god and he prayed and he cried and he called him god god to give him 21 more years and brother branham said he did get it but he messed up all the good things he did for the first part of his reign and minister of his life but anyhow he got it so elijah prophesy you're gonna die so prepare yourself and he started walking home and when he's when the holy spirit said turn back and go back and tell him he's not going to die he's going to live amen praise god hallelujah and the prophet was arguing with god said but how am i going to look because i just tell him he gonna die you send me back to the same man to tell him he's going to live god says it's it's you you worrying about you i am the one telling you go back and tell him he's going to live and that's many times that's how we get ourselves preachers and people we get ourselves or how we are going to look if we say certain things god's interested in how you gonna look and you've got to be willing to die to yourself how you're going to look whether you look like a fool whether you look this is that you only want to stay with the world [Music] and so we see this situation here where they set aside jesus christ the savior and they set him aside uh for works and programs that prefer to have all kinds of church joining and uh church uh uh conformity to the system i was talking about this discipline and this oneness that uh satan regimentation of of of denominations and of systems this is satan's plan this is how he works even in the realm of natural realm of war and warfare which he created because he started up with war in heaven and when he comes to art he got into nimrod and began to teach him as brother vin has preached on this subject big subject the arts of war were what were inspired the evil arts of war nimrod got inspired with how to make weapons and how to make this and make that and make the other and how to discipline men into an army and because he was the first one of course he began to take over all the whole country and that's how come they start to uh want to build bay bell and things like that but watch that always now i'm not telling you to go rebelling against systems because we are in it right now but you need to recognize who you are you work with the system and in the system as far as you can go right and god didn't say you uh are gonna just uh make yourself a rebel or something but the system itself the shock itself is going to push you out because you are you're going to be oddball you're not going to be a fit for the what their their plans are right the the the bride doesn't fit into the plans of the world council of churches she doesn't ah she doesn't have to ask them to put her out you don't she doesn't need to walk out they're going to push you out that's the way it is all right so praise god what more can they do against them over so many centuries they don't understand that uh in the book of genesis it tells us how that noah stood in the ark lord preaching the word after he warned the people do you know that god kept the art door open even after the animal's gone and his family gone in the door is just waiting now to be shut but it's still open for a little while and noah kept preaching in that ark door all the time crying out to them the bible puts it this way and god gave them a space to repent but they did not right and i believe that in our day it wasn't just one day but just that all through these years they get a space to repent turn around change your ways change what you're doing come back to the word the spirit crying out calling out justifying telling preaching through these apostles and men of god trying to bring them back to the original way but they will not come back to the word the way god wants them to do that amen praise god and this is what the bible calls the falling away there shall come of falling away first is that right revelation remember from whence the word fallen and go back to where you felt from hallelujah praise god oh my wow i i really see this brother it's really clear brother branham says here don't you see this is the falling away this is the apostasy of the last day amen and when they do this this is now the open door for the antichrist to come in amen you see you turn away from the the truth of the word you put the word out of your life and you open the door automatically you open the door for the devil the antichrist to come into your life once you put the word aside amen okay praise god for if you reject me when i come in my father's name and was not received then another will come to you in his own name the same principle jesus said it when an evil spirit is cast out from a man it doesn't just go away like that it goes yes of course it's not there on the man but jesus said it circles and keeps coming back to see if that man's fate weakened or that man wants that habit what man wants that sickness that man wants that condition back again and if he opens the door jesus said that devil will come right back and this is the case here when you put away the word amen praise god literally you take off the door from your house don't you think that all kinds of characters are going to start coming in your house even if some of them will only push their head to see well who living in here but some bald ones are going to come in but the timid ones will just put their head to see who's living in there with with no door on the house well just think of people who reject the word that's what they've done they left the door off of the house for jesus as the door the truth the word is the door and you put that out completely praise god matthew 24 mentioned all these signs in the heavens concerning this the last day just before jesus comes but he wasn't pushed out of the church in one day incrementally you know that's how satan works he doesn't make it obvious now i'm pushing you out no but slowly centuries is pushing out the word centuries a little bit here a little bit there a little something there is pushing the word out like that amen praise god because remember um that when uh ephesians the ephesian church age under paul which is the first church age the church was like i don't know how many of you saw it but just about five nights ago you had the full moon anybody here saw it or you were in your bed well i was still up so i was able to look out and see what a beautiful bright you know full moon the moon in his fullness that's a type of how the early church was for the moon types the bride and the sun types christ and the moon actually has no light of its own but it reflects the light from off the sun and sends that light back in the world i would say back into the church age right so you it catches the light from off of the sun on the other side of the world the sun might be over here the moon might be up here but it catches that light and then shines it back down right praise god so actually the stars are the same in the cat they reflect light they are reflectors they are not originators they are not creators but the word itself is the creator the sun sends forth its light so first church is the sun the the church was a full moon now i want you to get this picture if you have ever seen uh the movements of the moon that uh after the full moon then a slight bit of darkness comes on that orb that circle and then more darkness and more darkness more darkness when i looked at uh the tables last night because i want to see it it was just a sliver of light that was left from that bright full moon i saw last week darkness kept coming in coming in and all i was left and i look at it maybe tonight or by tomorrow night it'll go into complete blackness before it swings in this cycle and start getting a little light and then start coming back again of course you know that's because of the ages and the restoration and all that but there it is praise god that is actually what has happened praise god now in the part of the seventh church age it was still growing the light was getting brighter that's on the pentecost he doesn't say it but we know that the light was getting brighter see oh my and for a while and then suddenly it stopped short and from the time it stopped short it began to win back to almost nothingness that's what we are in now we are right now when the original pentecost that was at the southern street that had the original word of god because they were teaching oneness and all that kind of stuff baptism in jesus name amen and then later the devil got in there and then the splits came where trinity mix come in and and then it was no more just a oneness movement become a trinitarian and oneness and the mix just started right from there right and he says and it began to wane to almost nothingness now so instead of light we see blackness of apostasy upon us amen that's what's here the blackness of apostasy upon us at the end of the age this light will cease to shine for the darkness has taken over mine just look out in the natural world brother branham said way back you know he said that that the this deceit the system of this world and the economies of this world is based on a foundation of lies and deceit that based on lies now when i heard one of the reporters saying you can't believe anything this certain uh not just the leader but the nation and the spokesman saying because he says it's just a whole bucket of lies constant lies no truth lie he wasn't preaching by the way he's just talking but i said my that would be good if you can preach that somewhere but it's just lies lies lies that's what the world has come down to and people are getting into that because for them to survive and live in a society that's riddled with lies the devil is constantly prodding and pushing and influencing you me anybody for that matter to tell lies amen but we are not lies we are children of the light and children of the truth praise god hallelujah and now we see in this last day the last eclipse of the moon was a total eclipse speaking of his time it rained to total darkness he's talking about this uh you know this famous picture same time of the moon waning until it went into a total blackout right now in its seventh stage of that moon remember in the seventh stage of the moon it went into total darkness at the same time he didn't say on the earth but i am putting in those words now on the earth the pope of rome paul vi went to palestine to make a holy tour of jerusalem he was the first pope to go to jerusalem now this pope is called paul vi paul was the first church age messenger and this man goes by that name but he is not the first back there he is the sixth which is the number of man this is more than a coincidence and when he went to jerusalem the moon or let me say or the church went into total darkness amen that is it this is the end for i tell you this generation shall not pass away until all things be fulfilled praise god hallelujah amen praise god glory aren't you thankful to god that our eyes will be opened to see these things he's telling you darkness is all around but how come you see how come you could recognize and you're able to walk in the middle of this that's why he said in another part of revelation walk with me in white can you keep your robes clean while you're walking with me amen can you walk with the king and keep your ropes clean in this world a brother harold preached a beautiful message many many years ago and i remember him making this point that you we go up into heaven and he said while we are in heaven um and we asking abraham what about your faith you and sarah how did that change take place and maybe you go over there and say uh ezekiel what did you really see describe it about the wheel in the middle of the wheel and and uh uh michael and then one of them turns up by the way what age you from he says look at this here they all jump back i'm just playing you know portraying how he put it over low this year that's that darkest evil as worst age what we were in was nothing in comparison you you came out of there you got to be an overcomer you got to be and you know he was preaching away praise that was his heyday praise god hallelujah but that's the truth brother you don't realize when you if you come out of this and you go over there and you don't think of yourself you're nothing but god says you're an overcomer amen you think when they have a relay race they're gonna put their worst man at the end nah they put their best man or woman at the end of the race because they know if there's any shortage they can make that up easy they take uh they take a lightning bolt and put them put them at the end of the race because they can make it up and this is what god has done with you and i you were elected to be in this age hallelujah because now we're cleaning up everything praise god we're running away with the prize brother that lord of god you're running away with it because god ordained its soul praise the lord now we see now he's changing the thought it's the same thought but he's going to another realm here and he's saying now can you see where them two vines one through one false abraham having them two sons one after the flesh one after the spirit one after the promise one wanting the promise the other one after things of the flesh now we can see they come from the same parents hallelujah just like we come from the same pattern you come from the same parents right he says there were twins is that right hallelujah years ago i preached a message twins in the beginning twins in the end right but that's the point they're twins that's the reason why a bell could shake kane's hand and my brother he knows the devil back there and then he said my brother and not with any feeling whatsoever i just know we praise god don't don't uh fault me for knowing but uh praise god he's conscious of it but doesn't give him any feeling he's still his brother praise god oh my how wonderful to know that prophet said here now that uh that not uh they are twins and remember when i tell you this that they know they know much of the same truth together they know much of the same message right see but that's not it see remember but they are not of the same spirit they know the same truth but they are not of the same spirit so the moment one with the wrong spirit trying to bring a manifestation or interpretation or understanding of the word it's automatically wrong right and the other one can't help it don't have to think about it it will always be right because they're both coming from the same tree but one is a lemon and one is an orange one is the original and one is not one grafted in there right so here it is so remember cannot persecute elect hallelujah elect cannot harm elect many years ago we used to say oh my goodness um i can't take that guy to court you know because that uh brother or that sister defrauded me of three thousand dollars or five thousand dollars but but according to the scripture i can't take them to court i can't deal with that but you know the bible's telling you here elect can't persecute elect but it's not talking about that right because if one has the revelation and one don't have the revelation brother branham in another place tells you the law is there god put the law actually as a protection against these ungodly men and ungodly people you don't say oh i can't take them to court they're not elect right that's working against the things of the flesh of course that still has the leadership of the holy spirit that will tell you when to and when not to right even in that right i can't detail that but in general don't just be deceived when it comes to a brother or a sister who you really know in your heart there's an elected son daughter of god now that is something i can't even comment on it's between you that person and god that will have to deal with that and that means anything any any problem along that line praise god now remember these reprobates that persecute and destroyed elect remember these reprobates they are religious then he said they are smart they are of the canned line they are serpent seed they build their bay bells today build their cities build their own empires and all the while while they are doing that they are calling on god just like the other one amen they hate the true seed and they will do all they can even in the name of the lord to destroy god's elected ones but remember this with all that they are still needed in the church and i'm quoting here now brother mohammed said they are needed hallelujah but jesus said that he said don't pull it up don't pull it up if you pull up the tears you may pull up some wheat also i only may know the difference between the real beat and tears so you don't go not pulling up let let me do that in the end right the word will do all the pulling up the word will do the separating you you don't have to separate yourself from anybody i don't want this one no no no no the word will do that you just live and let the holy spirit have this wonderful way amen they are needed don't you think the chaff is needed for the wheat no chaff no wheat for the chaff actually protects the wheat he doesn't say that i'm saying this now i've been coding well you said that chaff protects the wheat it surrounds it until it comes to its maturity and then it's the chaff has to fall away because now the wheat can stand on its own praise god hallelujah so it doesn't need to chaff around it to prop it up and and that sort of thing see that's what then when it comes to that state what happens to the chaff then the chaff is now bundled to be burned with unquenchable fire amen and the wheat what happens to it the time comes when it has to be gathered into the garner oh praise god oh elect of god and i'm winding up here now and the prophet gives us some advice he says here beware i talked about this next thing and he said study study closely friends study we must study closely and the holy spirit brought my thoughts into the fact that do you know because a lot of people are hearing speaking about revelation many people are you know denying themselves reading their bible as simple as reading their bible listening to the tapes because they're living off of revelation but faith or revelation cometh by hearing and hearing comet by the word of god back to the word back to the reading your bible hallelujah praise god amen no don't don't just say well you're the pastor you're going to read your bible well i don't read my bible like a regimentation might be late in the night or early in the morning all of a sudden i might think of something and i run and pick up the bible it doesn't matter what i'm doing in the middle of writing something i just run pick up the bible and look up that one verse i'm not going to go and be like a dynamic nationalist i got to prove to everybody i'm spiritual so i need to study here for so many hours until the morning comes and when i see the sun come out then i stop reading no i'll just read the scripture that the holy spirit placed upon my heart and when it's five minutes or ten minutes i read it and i close the bible and then i meditate on what i read amen so study the word go back pick up those books of the and tapes listen to them even when you don't understand the prophet said that too long after i'm gone just lay on your coat sit in your chair play the tapes listen listen listen to it and let it come in this bread that's stored up for your soul amen and take it all in praise god beware study then he says be careful amen work out your salvation with fear and trembling rely upon god not on your wisdom don't lean on your wisdom don't link to your understanding and don't don't start thinking oh i really understand the message now i know the message i'm strong no no no no no you know nothing i don't know anything right you say oh that's not true because you read your bible yes you don't understand the more um one knows is the more they don't know is the more you realize that you really don't know amen hallelujah in all these lodges and things that happen to me talking about that i mention it now but you know that they're blindfolded before they're taken to another stage and that blindfold is just a symbol to say that person doesn't know right you go back to the martial arts and the fellow will start with a white belt and then the numbers the colors will change you know when he gets up to mastery there's no belt he can't what color is he going to put because by then you realized he don't know he realized don't know now he's got to go into creativity uh and allow himself to go to a state where he don't even know how he's going to answer a certain response from the opponent but because of the way he is something will happen something will work out but praise god amen your adversary the devil is even now going around like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour hallelujah can you imagine that the devil is peering peeping looking behind every bush every park everywhere you go he's looking for an opening if we make any opening he'll seize it right like that so he says be careful be watchful amen be watch always watch onto prayer watch unto prayer and be steadfast this is the end time both the true and false vine they're bought coming into maturity before the wheat matures those ripened tears must be bound for the burning they are all joining the world council of churches that is the binding soon the wheat garnering will come but right now the two spirits are at work in these two vines so come out from among the tears start to overcome that you may be considered praised worthy and fit to reign and rule with him praise god hallelujah oh thank god they put him outside the church i believe that the woman at the well was very happy they put him outside the church i believe bartimaeus was very happy that they put him outside the church because aleppo you couldn't even go close to the um to the temple in those days their temple guards they keep people like that away they can't come but it's good he was out beyond the camp he was outside there and you look at all those characters that were outside zacchaeus and this tax collectors and looked upon horribly amen but thank god that i met him outside of the camp and i praise god and glorify him for that may god bless this uh subject to your heart and to your thoughts here tonight praise the lord god bless you real good brother uh would you just sing him say it close him prayer and let us go out and live the way he wants us to live i'm not signaling you a song i just happened to come out of my mouth like that god bless you brothers and sisters okay [Music] [Music] be
