[Music] i'm indeed happy to be here this morning please be seated [Music] after a period of time of about two months i was allowed to rest relaxed and i thank the lord jesus christ for that of course that means [Applause] and i thank god that most of the people kind of left me alone so yes you know what i mean it's not all the calls and this and that i was literally left alone so that i could kind of recuperate remember i'm not 16 now and you start normally to feel the various creakings and achings and the old window goes blowing in the wind and banging on the side of the door and all that sort of thing so and you you wake up and there's certain aches that might be there you got to kind of work out before you can really get moving so it's a different life but i want to thank god that i'm enjoying his life and i want to thank god that he's the same yesterday today and forever and he doesn't change and he does not lie and his word remains the same i want to thank god as i watched the broadcast of of the brothers ministering on afforded days of purpose listening to the reaction of the congregation in response to the preaching of the word and it was just a blessing to see the grain ripening thank god that when the lord jesus comes again he will not go to the tree and find no fruit but there he will find fruit in the words of brother branham fruit ripened for his coming glory thank god so we thank god for this the ministries of the various brothers growing and ripening for his glory and honor of course you know they were they were staying within a certain confine they were not into the message message as such they were dealing with 40 days of purpose so they stuck within that confined to be able to bring those thoughts to you but praise the lord but i'm not here for that they are going to come back but they will be here from a different frame of reference and so i'm here now to come to you from the word of god and i am free to soar and fly in every direction so if i ramble if i roar if i sound like i'm screaming or anything like that it's just friends when this really gets a hold of you i i tell you words can not explain or expound what it is you we are trying to use words to express the eternal and you fail for words even though i know he's gifted me with that but the fact is even it fails you to express god and himself and what it is that he wants to say only when he desires it then he gives us that clarity and we want to take for a subject today inside outside inside outside now first of all let's read from look you can use many scriptures to preach on this subject but i'm just going to start from genesis right take genesis 7 i believe i have here verse 16. and it's all about noah how many knows the story of noah and how in his age violence was all over the place sexuality immorality everything was spread everywhere population explosion pollution nuclear proliferation was already there creating the explosions and the destruction and everything else and uh there that man stood by the command of god in the door of the ark the archetype lord of course and here he was preaching for 120 years 120 years now look i'm only preaching here for what 51 years or whatever and some people are getting tired of that kind of manner all right you know they get tired of that manner you know you begin to sound like all the other preachers because you're saying the same thing but those with the revelation they can hear a ring they can hear a gospel sound they can hear the eagles cry coming out of the word and recognize that it's god speaking from the word amen oh praise god so he was doing that and you know the people got used to his preaching after 120 years here in the same man with the same thing coming back with the same message every day after day you know and god had it that way so they get kind of tired and fed up by hearing him and they don't want to hear they start to shut him down and they start to shut him out and not to listen to what he's saying anymore literally praise god and uh after a while the bible said the time for the flood came and it tells you how god caused him to call the animals uh right there to the ark right now um i'm sure he just called all the animals he didn't know which too but he called all the animals and when they get to the word then they're by election the holy spirit know which two and they start to enter into the ark by election right and the bible tells us here as we read our text verse 16 and they went in onto and the lord shut the rest of them out it just says here and the lord shut him in because god's priority is to get his elected out right he bring them in that he might take them away and by the shutting in automatically shuts out all right the door closes and it shuts somebody in and it shut a whole bunch of people out at the same time what the same door the same door of liberty freedom salvation deliverance when it shuts it shuts the elected in and it shuts out the others on the outside let us pray before we go into the word of god itself heavenly father we thank you for the uh introduction and reading of the word we pray that the holy spirit will minister to us each one and lord god reveal this truth show to us father clearly what it is that you want us to see and say and do in this day and this hour for your glory and honor in jesus name amen praise the lord please be seated of course i just spoke up about noah and telling you how of course noah stood in the ark's door the type of the word preaching to the people warning his generation now noah is a type of the bride preaching to the eternal lost to the souls that are imprisoned now prisoners as the song just said in their own minds prisoners away from the word of god and here is the bride as jesus said as it was in the days of noah so shall it be in the day when the son of man is being revealed that there will be some noise of the word in this end time that are going to stand right in the middle of the word and preach it they're going to say it and when they say it lots of people said man i heard of brandon i heard of this message i heard about this i was even in it and i came out [Laughter] i was in the middle of the whole thing and i can't stand there there's a whole lot of animals in there and all kind of people in there and all kinds of strange the things i've never seen uh taking place and makes me feel funny i can't stand it anymore so i got out to the of the ark and i'm on the outside now listening to this man preaching the same thing which i heard all the time who am i and i'm tired of it you know i can't uh listen to it anymore but you see as i've just said they didn't realize while noah was in they were automatically shut out it did not seem dramatic then because he was simply and they could laugh at the scenery of him a door shut and you're in this little this wooden boat uh claiming there's a flood coming it looked so fantastic and idiotic and here we are uh preaching this word that was left by a god-sent prophet declaring it to a scientific generation a generation that's so full of wisdom and knowledge of man that you can hardly explain expound or say anything to them they don't want to hear it because they feel it's real religion got a hold of you they feel you're you're religious and that's all right if you want to be religious you know you say but i got the truth yeah that's your truth you know your truth and my truth and everybody got the truth so so so so what's what you're talking about you left like that you see so the point is it's you that must know what you gotta hold off but here it is that uh we are in the same situation as noah was i'm speaking on the topic of inside outside and here we are in the same spirit and attitude i want to quickly touch on israel when they that angel came god said get in that house shut the door stay on the inside don't come outside but stay inside because when the angel passes when i see the blood i'll pass over you but you see for him to pass over you you have to be on the inside there were inside with the blood on the door oh praise god i trust that blood is on the door of your hearts this morning i trust that the blood of the cross is stand across your soul today by the grace of god amen hallelujah yes sir i want you to see that while it sealed them in all the egyptians all the unbelieving jews that were there that did not go in that was sealed out they were on the outside so all of this is also a type of a ceiling time stealing some him and sealing some out because you see that ark had to be pitched on the inside on the outside to seal whatever is outside from coming in and seal in those from the inside from going back outside sealed by the word and by the blood in our day sealed by the holy spirit and we'll touch on that praise god as we get closer into the word hallelujah i want you to see they were sealed then then i want you to look at the holy of holies when the high priest went in nobody could follow him in there typing us [Music] kings and priests to god nothing can touch you after you've entered back into the lord as the son said i have passed the inner veil where the glories never fail hallelujah hallelujah amen i'm living in the presence of the king why you're inside the veil but while the priest was on the inside of the veil many others was on the outside of the veil some in the outer court some in the inner court but only the priest was allowed into the holy of holies oh praise god we'll touch on that also that you might understand in this hour what god is doing in our day and in our time i want to point to you also here was jacob and esau on the outside jacob looked as if he was a renegade and a rebel but really on the inside he was the son the seed son of the living god he saw on the outside he looked polished up he looked so gentlemanly he looked like a good son he looked like a real christian matter of fact he looked like a better christian than you appear to be and here he was he looked up he appeared better than jacob was but jacob had something on the inside why esau had something on the outside that appeared to the people that that was enough to give him the inheritance but really we're talking about something that god gives that you have on the inside [Applause] jacob and esau when we go back into the times of jesus we see the priest and the prostitute and the priest was a good old man that helped your grandmother help your father give them food give them charity give them say vincent whatever assistance or whatever and you think oh this kind of priest this good old man he's such a kind man he moves so holy and so wonderful but jesus said of him you're a generation of vipers amen yes your generation of snakes on the outside it says you wash the platter hallelujah make your outside look so good on the inside you're a walking graveyard oh my there it was on the outside one looks so holy while on the inside was a graveyard of dead man's bones and the other one on the outside the prostitute you can look and see that's your natural eyes telling you but when god looks at that person he sees an elected seed living underneath there praise god hallelujah yes my brothers i want to thank god for bringing this wonderful topic and talk to me showing how these disciples were in the upper room in the upper chamber they're in the presence of god hallelujah and but when the holy ghost fell it fell on them and anointed them and filled them with the holy spirit praise god you say but brother simon didn't the people outside even hear them speak with towns and prophesy didn't they have some kind of a blessing to yes they were but only some of them received what the spirit of god was giving and what the spirit of god was giving sealed them in it blessed them hallelujah but it sealed out the entire crowd that was outside that was mocking them and calling them all manner of names hallelujah amen i want to tell you my friends i believe this is a day when the marking angel is again sealing some in and sealing some on the outside while this is going on right now in 10 virgins the mess is called ten virgins 1960. he says you know when a woman makes up her mind she she has a pattern in front of her right and she makes up her mind where she is going to cut in that pattern oh my she she gets what she thinks is the best part of that pattern oh glory to god hallelujah it's all the same goods but let she lays out the goods we all human beings here right we all got a thirst we all got a religious something in us we want to wash up something magnify something right but see she lays it down then she takes her scissors and she cuts out now what is left over is called the remnant we're not teaching on that but this is showing you how the remnant is actually like the ten virgins like the five virgins they're virgins so they're gonna have to come up in the remnant for the tribulation but they're not to be in the bride because they're not in the pattern but i want to thank god this morning that i believe i'm in the factory i believe i was elected and chosen by god to be inside the pattern hallelujah while i'm in many are out one in a million the same day you got saved maybe a million were lost on the outside we take our salvation just a regular thing we just take this coming to church worshiping god being in what we call the message to be something that's ordinary but let me tell you you are on the divine inspiration of the holy spirit because he has got a hold of you and he brought you here by his grace [Applause] look brother david is right there where is he from across the world some of you where you're from you come from the east and the west the north and the south hallelujah their sister julia our daughter they come from way over into new zealand who brought them here who brought them under this ministry why would they have to listen to me they can listen to anybody they want to listen to but there's something about the holy spirit when he ordains you to a ministry a voice that will bring the word of god to you it fits your soul like a hand in a glove oh i don't care what race what religion where you come from when you hear that voice of the living god it inspires your soul amen hallelujah that's why the apostles were so confident even though what they tell the people to even try to drive them away they don't want to go away why because it's not them they're not doing nothing they don't have to do nothing you know i don't have to do a sales job on you to keep you here i don't have to do a job of persuasion or i don't have to do anything like that to be able to convert you or something like that there's somebody here under this word that's speaking to your soul [Applause] there's the holy spirit that takes the word and applies it to your heart amen praise god the days are gone when the sheep got to be kept by the shepherd you are not kept by this shepherd you are kept by the power of god through your revelation of faith [Music] it's your revelation of faith according to your faith your revelation so shall it be unto you it's yours your revelation you have caught that's keeping you to the word that's why it's an individual revelation it's not my revelation it's your revelation hallelujah why because it's like paul said he says it's my gospel now because i hear it i recognize it i see it i caught a revelation of it hallelujah that's my gospel my gospel belongs to me [Applause] oh my mother got it my father got in my brother by god no no no no no it's you and i'm not telling you to see it and even if i tell you you can't see it unless god wants you to see it hallelujah praise god let me continue here so that we can finish the day by the grace of god he says here now wow what is this pattern amen that pattern was there and elected that elected lady she elected to cut from it from it god before the foundations of the world also know his pattern hallelujah of course you know what he's talking about who is the pattern who is the life's pattern jesus christ we want to pattern ourselves after him that's why we think to be like jesus to be like jesus on earth i long to be like him oh praise god he's our pattern brother that's mine he is the statue of a perfect man glory to god and now god cut us from the lord like that pattern amen he cut you from that pattern praise god hallelujah see before the foundation of the world he knew the end from the beginning by foreknowledge and he elected where to cut amen he knew the difference between esau and jacob he knew the difference between sinner and saint he knows the difference of the motives of every single heart so he elected us before the foundation of the world put our names on the lamb's book of life and also the lamb that was slain put our names on before that lamb was even slain think of it praise god my friends god elected you back there to when he was elected back there to be the lamb to be slain we were elected to be the ones that he would be slain for hallelujah amen now many say just because you accepted christ as your personal savior that doesn't mean you're going in any rapture that's for the elect only they go in the rapture there'll be a remnant left here on the earth and they'll have to go through persecution and tribulation hallelujah but the bride will be caught up in the rapture oh my word god's election makes the pattern amen now i have jesus said i have chosen you before the foundation of the world do you believe that jesus told the disciples he was with them they were with him and he had chosen them and that he knew them already from before the foundations of the world was ever laid oh praise god right there the holy spirit speaking on the inside while i'm talking to you saying you see that's how prophecy comes because he already knows you thank you he can tell you anything about yourself because you were there and he already knew you he's not now learning something or not having to read your mind or now no he knew you from before the foundation to the world and so he can tell you everything about yourself and anything that's in your heart because you're thinking that you're now thinking you are thinking that you now thinking but you're actually rehearsing what us praise god that's another thing but you're going back over what was already there before the foundational world and he already knows where you're going what which way your mind your thoughts or your actions and everything is going amen praise god hallelujah my friends there's a there'll be a group of people that will be so good so upright even holy living god save people but they will not be in the rapture they'll come up in the second resurrection see that's the way it is oh my oh praise god now let's go here let's go over and listen to the prophet speaking from why are people so tossed about now he says that priest takes the charger of blood of the lamb and he walks into the inner court into the presence of god and when he went in the veils fell behind him and he was shut in and there when he got shot in he became hidden from the outer world there on the outside to them he was him oh thank god we have a hiding place thank god we have an abiding place that we can walk in the presence of god and be hid from the things of the world remember when you go in right he says behind that veil it's sound proof hallelujah praise god it becomes soundproof praise god because you're on the inside in the presence of the eternal everlasting god while the world on the outside gasping and grasping and looking and searching but you are already on the inside can you say an amen hallelujah oh praise god you're on the inside and eating from the manna that's in there and that the manner will last for years hundreds of years for it can never be contaminated hallelujah it will never run out because that's the manner that you are feeding on while you're on the inside i'm talking about those on the inside of the revelation and those who are on the outside all together but some in the inside and this is what jesus referring to you when he says but unto you it's given to know the mysteries of the kingdom but unto them it is not given why you're in the inside you're on the outs others are on the outside and that is what i'm talking about it's not apparent that you're going to look around and uh no but this is what it is you're talking spiritually understanding revelation wise inside of the revelation outside of the revelation and that's why he said with less than five minutes you're talking with somebody you'll know whether they're in or they're out you're go you're gonna know whether they got the holy spirit or not because you can't help it you'll be you'll be able to recognize it amen you see a man that once walks right into god then a veil drops behind him and when it drops behind him it shuts out the things of the world from him for he is in the presence of the living god and now eating manna no wonder a man a woman like that 10 o'clock 12 o'clock nine o'clock one o'clock don't mean nothing to him amen because they're living in the presence of the king amen he's talking about the changing of times not now we got cold with time we got the aids time we got this time we got that time don't make no difference to that man or that woman they just keep pressing on hallelujah god wants you to stay here and do work you stay here and do work god calls you you answer him whatever god wants we're in his will we're walking in his word we're doing what he says according to the promise of this day and of this hour amen praise god hallelujah amen no wonder every day is a fine day for men and women like that hallelujah what they have found the secret place they are now behind the veil hallelujah the doors close behind him he don't see nothing of the world then doors are sound proof their made soundproof wow by the holy spirit himself makes it sound professional in other words he shuts your ears so what you don't want you to hear a man shuts off your mind from things you don't want you do to get to amen and whatever he wants you to see no matter how rugged crew will no matter how immoral no matter what it is we maybe want you to see it for a purpose you don't go looking for it but if it's there he wants you to see it for a purpose he wants you to learn something know something somebody swearing cursing whatever you might ah well maybe god wants to hear that you're living in this world you're gonna hear all kinds of stuff you're gonna see all kind of you can't run up to everybody and say oh don't do that you shouldn't no that's not our business that's the best of the holy spirit to do that amen oh you're a compromiser well i've slept with fishermen and they're gambling and playing giraffes and the cursing and the swearing and the other preachers are there laughing and mocking at me while these guys are there and these women are coming up to them and putting their arms around them while they're doing that and they're drinking while they're doing and they're talking to me they call me brother brother but before you know it some of those men begin to quietly get brother aside by themselves and begin to tell brother about the problems they have between themselves and the lady they're living with and i live to see many of them married to those women and become strict godly fathers raising up a family for the glory of god i wasn't a fisherman or my name is simon but i god let me there to be with the fishermen and the word of god went forth and reached them and changed their lives for his glory and for his honor hallelujah amen you see the holy spirit hides that man in christ makes him sound proof by the baptism of the holy spirit and then makes them walk daily before him oh what a picture of the believer in the presence of god what a privilege that the believer has you see my friends that sin why are people so tossed about i remember i know that when a plane amen is traveling that's fine but when it gets to a certain level of speed it breaks through a sound barrier how many knows that break through some burial then after that there is no limits no more no limits because they broke through the sun burial and when the holy spirit gets ahold of you you hear the word of god your re your revelation becomes clear listen when you break through that tradition of barrier break through the barrier of tradition amen hallelujah my friends then you realize that he is the same yesterday today and forever and there is no limit to what god can do right there with you and in you hallelujah by feeling you praise god what the world needs today is not a world sphere but the world needs a real world revival hallelujah and baptize it with the presence of the living god and morphing itself and unveil invading itself once again in human flesh he says in veiling there's an invalid and an unveiling but thank god he's unveiling himself going behind flesh again in this last day and we gotta give him praise god hallelujah aren't you glad that you're breaking through the song barrier come on you astronauts it's about time now break through the sun barrier hallelujah oh my you see when that man that astronaut breaks the sound barrier he goes right on through and from then on he don't hear nothing on the outside he just go beyond it all because he's living in the presence of the living god hallelujah praise god you realize what we're talking about there now you break into the presence of the living god you're not hearing other voices what other preachers you're hearing they're preaching that can preach good amen they can preach masterfully their presentations my goodness their presence on the stage their actions their activity their gestures dramatic photogenic oh fantastic brothers oh my goodness they can really make a a tape that makes somebody like me look like a a country boy but my god ain't looking for that god is looking for emotions god is looking for the way of a true prophet hallelujah amen the words may sound broken up but the words are just saith the lord [Applause] god's not looking for people to admire me do you think god looking for people that marry you and that's going to be the attraction the attraction is jesus christ the word god's not attracted by how uh accomplished i appear how i look how i gesture that's wonderful god didn't use or take that and use it for his glory but that's not what it is the attraction is the holy spirit amen one miracle takes place here and you watch the crowds of people start running here why it wouldn't be big because they want to see me they want to see god is that right not because they want to see you they want to see god so the thing about it my friends i always strive to get out of this human culture that's trying to mold me and shape me and pour me into that kind of mold so that i can appear like one of these uh preachers that come off off of the cookie cutters and you know out of the bible schools and stuff like that trained and shaped and formed in such a way no god wants to shape his own man he wants to shape his own women let them see what a real woman should be what a real man should be what a real believer ought to be a true believer the deafness of counterfeit amen and you know what like i've seen since i was a young man god throws one coin and he's gonna throw a big handful and all the counterfeits around it amen let me tell you god's gonna produce everybody claiming they're christian doesn't matter how the mascara streaks dog and running down the tears running down and say i'm a christian no matter how their fingernails are long like a tigress and they're sticking in their eyes by mistake it is still a christian they're still born again you know they're still changed by the power of god they're still speaking towns and all that manual stuff but let me tell you the devil will accomplish his aims by whatever means he has to do it but the real believer their eyes are on the word and that pattern is not here in that word it don't fit amen we stand by the word of god as the songwriter said till the crown we gain glory to god hallelujah amen my god john chapter 30 20 verse 13 to 43 you don't have to find it also in luke 24 verses 33 to 45 this is telling you jesus after he raised up and when he raised up what happened the bible said the disciples he appeared to them when they were in the room amen and you remember thomas was doubting before and saying i got to see him and if i don't stick my finger in his side and i don't touch those wounds that he got in the palm of my hand i am not going to believe amen but see he was a believer he said i'm not going to believe so he was a believer but he wanted some dramatic proof but jesus appeared in the room is that right behind closed doors amen and there when he appeared in the room let me quote brother branham here now when he got them inside closed doors speaking from proof of his resurrection what a difference that makes to those people them see there he was had been with him for a long time but these ones he left them in the room amen then the message for years and years and years and they know him for a long time they know him according to the flesh for a long time they can boast of the 40 years 30 years whatever and here it is but these he met them in the room right oh my what a difference that makes but once christ comes on the inside amen let me tell you what i'm talking about not christ on the outside of it and reading it just like that and then saying yes it is true it is right you're reading out of the same bible i'm reading out and he said they have christ but he's on the outside and they can say yes it's true it's right but i'm talking about christ on the inside speaking and saying through that individual that's right amen you get the difference christ on the inside once inside then the door is closed and when the door closes to that individual on the inside of them he makes himself known to them by the way he's done something he'll break that bread to them amen and the breaking of the bread they'll know him by the breaking of the bread lord of god do you know him do you know him by the breaking of the bread oh praise god forever hallelujah let me tell you every true preacher that preaches this word and this message hallelujah they're going to have a lot of characteristics like their father hallelujah you follow brother brannon's message and you're gonna find you're gonna pick up a lot of things that was with him and on him you'll never be like him but things that were with him you're gonna have some of those characteristics you can help him why you've been listening in his message you've been hearing him you've been passing through all the time and you with your father your own natural father you can't help you don't have to do nothing it's there you don't have to do nothing it's a family trait hallelujah praise god and it'll be right there praise god hallelujah oh my praise god god hasn't planned out that way what a beautiful thing god's eternal plan of salvation for the individual hallelujah are you getting what i'm saying here inside outside inside or outside where are you praise the lord may god help us remember friends on the inside was the mercy seat hallelujah that's what was the inside hallelujah the believer psalms 1 tells you it's like a like a tree hallelujah blessed is the man he's like a tree planted by the rivers of living waters remember trees are never commanded to produce fruit we are not commanded to produce any fruit whatsoever no sir speaking from why can't people keep their victory we were never commanded to produce fruit no sir never said it anywhere we are told to bear fruit but not to produce fruit see and there's quite a difference in people producing and those that are bearing we produce education we produce psychology we produce intellectuals all that comes from the outside form but to bear fruit it must come from him that is on the inside you see they are trying to smear it all on on their outside but the god's church isn't built like that the bride isn't built like that it comes from the inside coming out apple comes from the outside of the tree it comes from the inside of the tree to the outside and the life of the tree shows what it is the believer is like a tree the believer is like sheep too you know remember listen to this you know the sheep is a sensitive odd animal and you know sheep was never asked to manufacture wool he was asked to bare wool and he bears wool not because of anything he does he just bears wool because he is a sheep is that right praise god thank god for the great ministries that went before us and they unveiled to us what we needed to know to draw us closer to god but we can't really add this and add that and add the other look it's written in the bible that way but they misunderstand what the meaning is it's like a child is a human being from the day it's born but it's got to add to its knowledge is that right but even it's got to add to its growth its size and everything but it's all going to happen naturally right they don't have to do nothing it's just gonna it's it's gonna bear it you don't have to go manufacture it or produce it or work yourself up into something to get it it's just there praise god hallelujah oh my oh my see we they're trying to smear it on the outside but it comes from the inside now we're asked to bear fruit not to manufacture fruits these things like long suffering joy peace faith meekness gentleness patience they are not to be manufactured dare to be products that comes from the inside to the outside the outside life that we live proves what is on the inside now we've tried to manufacture this to manufacture fruits of the spirit and what we find out all of that trying to manufacture turns out to be nothing but hypocrisy what did he say trying to manufacture it turns out to be nothing but hypocrisy because you can't manufacture real genuine christianity how many believe that you can't produce it amen for it is an experience by the spirit and the spirit that lives in you he bears the fruit of itself hallelujah the spirit of god in you identifying you by bearing fruit through you for his glory and for his honor blessed be the name of the living god hallelujah amen see you cannot manufacture it in any way that comes my friends to us in this day and hour praise god that comes from the lamb and the dove and here it comes again he says now let's look at the dove now do you know you don't have the dove don't have to worry about going and taking bats here and bats there you don't have to because god made him with the oil on the inside of him that goes through his feathers and keeps him clean all the time praise god and that's the real church amen there got the holy anointing oil of god on the inside and every bit of every believer and that oil keeps him clean from the kings of the world oh praise god the holy ghost inside of the believer is the one that keeps him or her clean not from the outside what he is and her trying to wash off it's not you and me trying to clean up ourselves is that right we're human and we're gonna do that ourselves he knows that you you're gonna try to keep yourself in line but really it's not you the holy ghost in you he is the one that's going to keep you clean when you least expect you'll hear that boy saying no don't do that you shouldn't have said that why you turn here shouldn't turn there should not turn on the next street you pass where you should have gone and that voice just keeps talking to you quite like that and you know when is god talking to you that's not yourself that's the holy spirit trying to guide you and two to you and teach you these things for his glory amen praise god do you think about them old crows we have all crows in this message you know yeah they just tried to paint on some color like a dove amen oh my think about it you might think they tried to paint it on like a dove all over them but let me tell you no matter how much they paint there's still nothing but a stinky wool crow on it on the inside a stinky old buzzard nothing but a scavenger eater of dead things of the earth amen but a dog don't even have to worry about that because there are dove to begin with and the oil keeps them clean all the time it comes from the inside to the outside but do you know some of them buzzards brother bran speaking i hope you catch this and understand what he's really saying will even come to that dove and say to that dove or that believer mine too my feathers put out a lot of holy water so my feathers are all so clean amen it didn't you see but that didn't come from the inside out it come from your outside in amen trying to put some holy water on well bless god i go to church the same like you you go to church and i go to church my church is is just as good as yours so what we all have is just the same that's nothing but a buzzard amen but a dove is oiled from the inside because he was given a certain gland was placed in him to make him not to be like any other bird whatsoever that gland is in him so he could be oiled from the inside to the outside and every believer that's elected been given a lot a sea of god on the inside and that seed of god is to keep you clean it's your anchor to hold you to the rock it's god's word that and oh my friends it stabilizes your praise god hallelujah your flesh is going to try to do all kinds of stuff and it may even do things for a little period but the holy spirit is there to stabilize you to keep you until you're from the inside lord of god hallelujah oh my he don't even have to keep himself clean because there's something inside of him that will keep him clean oh my precious sister hallelujah something inside he mentioned the name of a sister i didn't call her name he just oh my precious sister praise god there's something inside of you that will keep you clean amen oh praise god you don't just come say oh i joined church like to take a drink with you that cigarette you smoke in there smells real good oh my friends oh and just think of it i come in the message now and i got to let my hair grow out like that that's so awful them nice little pretty little dresses i used to wear i i can't wear them no more oh i have to take them off now oh my i joined church last week and now i've got to try and change my behavior listen to the prophet you miserable looking rich all the holy water in the world couldn't clean you up that will take the holy spirit on the inside of the inside to clean you and to make you what he wants you when you got something inside of you it just washes it away all the time it keeps washing washing you just stand still in his presence and it will keep washing washing washing amen don't you know that no matter what you did during the day all the week the moment you go into a time of prayer that's holy spirit starts washing all kinds of stuff start coming back up to your mind things come up before you and you start wash washing oh lord forgive me for that lord i didn't realize oh amen you automatic it just comes out you just want to be right with the living god blessed praise god hallelujah you don't have to tell sheep you got to manufacture some wool to prove to me you are a sheep that's the matter with the pentecostal people today that's the matter with all of christendom today they're trying to manufacture something and a sheep doesn't have to manufacture he bears wool he bears fruit of the spirit you don't say word of god i have to shout till i get black in the face amen and then i know i've got it you you don't go and say i have to do this i have to have a certain sensation go through me before i know i got it or say i have to dance in the spirit oh my if i don't dance i ain't got it but if i dance i know i got it no no no no no just get really truly born again and it actually begins to take place of itself you don't have to say like some will oh brother i have to stay with my bible i have to study all night i have to do this i have to do that i have to join this i'll have to make this i'll have to do this penance no no no no no just die out to yourself and recognize he's on the inside and then he comes with that from the inside and it takes care of all of that on the outside of you oh blessed be the name of the living god hallelujah do you believe it i said do you believe it oh praise god i rely on the holy spirit he is my comforter he is my god he is my stronghold he is my strength praise god hallelujah amen no wonder he called a lot of the pastors in them churches a bunch of snakes quoting from the indictment he called them snakes bunch of whited walls amen you're nothing but a walking graveyard the outsider you polished up with white robes and turned around colors but on the inside you're rotting and stinking under the dead man's bones he pulled no punches that little bit of galilean cop and his son didn't pull no top punches he just told them like it is amen oh my see he was wonderful saying you make the outside of the platter clean but the inside you're nothing but a bunch of handful of snakes and then his prophecy went forth condemning the organization and that's what made them turn against him and make him them want to crucify him but let me tell you today now he's speaking for our day you cannot kill this ministry how many believes that he says you cannot kill this ministry i believe it he said it lives on and it will live on after i'm gone hallelujah why you can put this messenger to sleep but you can't put that message to sleep amen let's just say the lord are you gonna put the message to sleep the messenger may go to sleep william branham may be gone but that that's one that's wonderful in the eyes oh now we got a cantankerous troublemaker out of the way yeah you got the messenger out the way but is the message you have to deal with and the message remains right here praise god the message is multiplied now amen i said the muslims multiply hallelujah you're not dealing with one man anymore hallelujah not one man with a discerning gift or something but you're dealing with a people all through with a turtle preaching to the eternal loss with the word of god on the inside of them amen praise god not my will but time be done lord of god hallelujah see you can't do that you can't put this message to sleep amen praise god how can you put this message to sleep the real believer how can the real believer even in the church right now how can you go to sleep with this message this message can put you to sleep if you really got a revelation he says you know now he doesn't call it the message he says right because he lives on he just made that quick short statement right there and stop because he lives on the message is him and he lives on your messenger can die but the message which is him lives on forevermore is the same yesterday today and forever [Music] remember when the third will come first first it came in the form of healing the sick second it came as rebuking the organizations by prophesying the word what they was what they were and what they were coming to right oh my what is what will come and what what was what is and what will come upon them but the third poll historical was when he preached to the eternal lost that could be saved no more even though they were hearing his word he in person was preaching to them this is not law this is the son of man himself preaching to them and they were eternally lost they couldn't hear his word amen hallelujah think of it in our day when i saw that them them women with them big painted eyes on amen going oh that vision of hell preaching to souls in hell souls that will not accept mercy souls that were eternally separated from the presence of god but yet it must be preached to them for they have to recognize it see what he was because god made him there you know what in other words they have to come to the judgment and god god can easily say didn't you hear you heard it you heard it he said but they must hear it so we got to preach it we don't just assume what all the people lost so we're not going to preach oh redemption over so we're not going to preach no we must preach the word for 120 years or more like noah even though it seemed hopeless even though it looks like it's all over amen we keep preaching the word oh unceasingly praise the name of the living god hallelujah amen but yet they must hear it so they can recognize what he is who he is and no wonder his ministry must come out in the same way in these last days as it was for as the father sends me so send are you and the words i do you shall do also amen the lost could never be saved those ones that reject this mercy that was his third pull this is our third book you believe that prisoners right now lots of people imprisoned now amen oh praise god watch noah i'm gonna i'm coming to winding up noah's ministry and let me say brother brahms speaking here seoul's imprisoned now noah's ministry he says in fact all ministries all ministries will do the same and done the same right he went in the ark he went into the ark and for seven years he kept preaching and nothing seemed to be happening the ministry seemed as if it had just settled down but his testimony was now being preached to the doomed sodom and gomorrah jesus referred to them before the coming of the son of man so shall it be like the days of noah so shall it be in like it was in the days of sodom he referred to noah why was he referring paragraph 285 same thing souls in prison remember noah already also had three poles and his third pull was preaching to the total loss after god shut the door amen it was no i'm not shutting out nobody it wasn't not putting anybody out the message of the church or oh god shut the door and when god shut him in he kept on preaching what he was always preaching he kept preaching the word it seemed ordinary it seemed like every other preacher preaching the same thing that might even sound like they're bridging it better amen but what what's what what it was see here now that as he after the door was shut and he kept printing gods let it set right there right in front of their eyes for them to see it and hear it but nobody could enter in no more or go out of it no more is that right you can't they can't come into this no more because the door shut god shut it and you can't go out anymore where would you rather be brother danny where would you rather be from the old pentecostals some coming to me i used to remember i can't remember all the words but it went like this i'd rather to be on the inside looking out than to be on the outside looking in for when noah preached before the flood amen then it talks about god shutting the door and so on like that but now is the time praise god when the door comes to the point where it's shutting closing fast amen oh my and whoever's shut in shut in with god in a secret place there in the spirit beholding his face hallelujah oh praise god don't you recognize what he's talking about look i'm gonna i'm gonna wind this up but we can keep preaching here look you're shut into the into the little chamber in the inner room the little room that he saw you get shut in with god there amen the word in the chamber speaking to his bride amen making his word known revealing his secrets all the personal things in his heart and in his mind that he wouldn't explain to nobody else explaining it to his bride from the lord hallelujah don't you recognize the day we are living in we're living in the sign of the time we're living right in it now it may be later than you think one of these days let me say as it says in revelation let him that is on the outside let him continue to stay outside and he that is on the inside let him forever be on the inside still for the door will close before you amen you know the scripture let him that is filthy be filthy still him this is this that is what he's in his mind while he's saying this i can see that he's saying let him that is on the outside let him stay outside still and him that is inside may he forever be on the inside still amen may i say that the same to every one of you and to myself i want to stay on the inside hallelujah of this revelation brother simon you're strange where's simon you're funny i don't understand you i'm not asking anybody to understand me i'm not asking for your admiration i'm not asking you for anything or i'm just wanting you to see what i'm pointing you to in this word in this message in this day and in this hour i thank god for this message and i want to point you straight to that for his glory and for his honor when god is silent we'd better be silent and this i'm going to wind this up at this point now let's we'll be silent amen where he has spoken then we must speak he told us the evidence of what would happen after being baptized with the holy ghost and what was that he said when you are truly baptized with the holy ghost you would have a teacher come to teach you all of the truth but that teacher would be just a man the teacher will be an inside teacher hallelujah it will not be an outside teacher even though god ordained fivefold ministry and all of that god will use them continue to use that but your teacher is that inside teacher not just the outside teacher but the spirit of the living god hallelujah for if the inside teacher that spirit of god isn't inside of you you would not be able to hear the truth and receive it by revelation amen you won't be able to hear it you won't be able to receive it if you heard it every moment of your life you will still not be able to hear it that was the sign of the indwelling spirit in the days of paul those who were filled with the holy ghost were able to really hear the word and receive the word then go out and live by the world those who did not have the spirit they heard the same thing but they heard it only as carnal men and women and then put a wrong interpretation on it and went into sin don't mean you're going to do something dirty but went into unbelief wrong interpretation don't mean you preach false doctrine you have a wrong understanding right and then now this happens he says in every age in every age amen for the holy ghost comes for the true believer in every age [Music] and in every age i say to you in every age this evidence remains the same those who had the spirit the teacher on the inside they're the ones they hear the word and that spirit in them took that word that they hear and begins to teach them it amen and then he used the word begins to reveal it to them hallelujah and there was that group that heard that really heard that messenger and the message that he was bringing and they took it and they went out and began to live it i'm i'm finished with that last quote you understand what i'm saying inside outside are you inside or are you outside let us search ourselves to see whether we be as paul said and i'm not no it's just coming up by the holy spirit he said paul said check yourself whether you'll be in the faith hallelujah praise god in the faith praise the lord so we are not here to put anybody out no we're not here to shut nobody out we're not here to the devil telling lies and said brother signs up put me out the church where did this tell me no nobody put you out nobody that has a revelation spirit wants to put anybody out and can't put anybody up the holy spirit puts you out yes the spirit that is in you let me put this inside oh praise god thank you bro hallelujah yes very important praise the lord i was conscious something but i couldn't tell but thank god brother sister god wants you to know that be sure whether you be in the inside or you're on the outside i believe i'm standing like no i was in the ark door on the inside speaking warning to the people all peoples even to those of you who are in here that believes the word but it's you but know if you're really shut in you know you can deceive even me i'm not any no at all you can deceive me i don't even care about that but you can't deceive god he knows our hearts and he will deal with us every single one of us hallelujah i know my faults i can run you know when you're in a car crash you'll be shocked i was in one and in a split second it's like your whole life story passes in front of how is that possible that i could see myself from since i it was a young boy right up to that time it passed like i think just as much god will be able to pass that in front of you in the judgment and you ain't going to be able to open your mouth and say nothing because it's all photographed it's all there it's all right before you my and so it goes right out praise god you see what just happened that brother came and did that god allows even things like that to happen just so you get distracted right i always tell you that the devil will throw you off and say oh look his socks he got the wrong color socks on today but what's the socks got to do with the opening of the word right but that's how the devil does right he'll make your shirt stick out your pants or something twist or this goes on or that happen it don't generally happen but all of a sudden it starts to happen and your attention go on that and you're not listening to what you should be receiving see it was every possible thing you could think about right praise god so be aware of your of the enemy and thank god we have a armor and i'll just throw this in and the armor that we have every soldier has to have armor and they have their armor outside and padded this and that but our weapon is weaponry is from the inside thank you jesus our armor is on the inside you can't see it but we got invisible armor on the inside weird all spiderman and this one and superman and all that they're making up it's us let them fire all the bullets and it bumps right off no weapon formed against you can prosper no evil thing comes against you can prosper not because i am going on repeating the word over and over and over again and make it come into power because i am repeating it but because god already said it in the word and if you believe his promise of his word it cannot and will not hallelujah do you believe it god bless every one of you for being here today and that may be rusty may not be in the in no you you may think different but i feel i'm kind of rusty here i gotta yeah i gotta get into a pace you know uh a rhythm of the holy spirit but recognize brother sister um in this day and in this hour what god is doing i want to the brothers some of the brothers will be going to uh the great island of of uh jamaica uh to minister the word of god there towards the end of december and may the holy spirit go with them i will take some time to spend with them to go with the word because they have to go and teach the word right we're entering we're entering into apostleship now right this is what's going on right apostleship don't make you some big lofty something a word apostle means missionary is that right that's actually what it means it's a missionary a lot of people think there's no more apostles and only epistles but there's a lot of apostles still real ones not talking about the ones who make sure that they have to get the salary coming from headquarters before they go and then they're a registered missionary but i'm talking about missionaries real missionaries like our precious brother maddox that has just passed and gone beyond the veil gone into the presence of god a real missionary a man who was a permanent senior driver for the cn trains and heard the call of the spirit of god took his young wife and his children katherine les the brothers took them all and it's four or five of them and he just the call was so strong he went over to the philippines with his entire family nobody promising him any money there was no promise of salary or anything that's what it means going by faith real faith not when oh i'm going by faith with the organization back of you who i'm going by faith amen with some you know body promising them a whole lot of money no they're going by faith in jesus name amen and that's how he went preached amongst the people live with the people praise god brother edison
