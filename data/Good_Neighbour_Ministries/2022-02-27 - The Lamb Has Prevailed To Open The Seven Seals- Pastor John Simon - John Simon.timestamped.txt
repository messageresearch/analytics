[33:41] have you here amen
[33:43] uh and to let you know
[33:46] that this is a wonderful wonderful day
[33:50] and opportunity for us as believers in
[33:53] christ just please be seated just for a
[33:55] moment
[33:58] uh
[33:59] first of all um i must bring to your
[34:02] attention of course you're aware
[34:04] in the natural world
[34:06] that there is a war that is ongoing
[34:09] right now
[34:10] right well we know the prophet already
[34:13] told us
[34:14] watch russia
[34:17] watch russia
[34:19] king of the north
[34:21] we know the scriptures tell us
[34:24] that gog
[34:25] and magog
[34:28] tubal
[34:29] and meshech
[34:31] when you look those words it tells you
[34:33] plain
[34:34] top lost moscow
[34:37] it's in the bible
[34:38] right it's in hebrew so people don't
[34:41] realize that then the cities were named
[34:43] the countries were named
[34:46] and tells how um um
[34:49] the the beer
[34:51] and the dragon
[34:53] are going to go after the oil in israel
[34:55] which we know the bear is russia
[34:58] and the dragon is china
[35:00] and the bible already tells these things
[35:03] so modern events
[35:05] are now being made clear
[35:08] by the vindication of prophecy
[35:11] [Music]
[35:13] we are
[35:14] seeing it
[35:17] we're experiencing it
[35:19] we're a part of it
[35:22] and we're in the middle of it
[35:24] but we must thank god
[35:27] that we have eyes to see
[35:31] millions are there out there
[35:34] and they have no idea
[35:37] of what is really happening
[35:40] why do you you can sit back and rest
[35:44] because this is the time of ruth waiting
[35:50] waiting for the coming of the kinsmen
[35:52] redeemer
[35:56] to take her out of this world
[35:58] full of human effort and works and and
[36:01] and this and that just to stay alive you
[36:04] rather grasp here and grasp a little
[36:06] there gleam here and clean a little over
[36:08] there and the kinsman redeemer thank god
[36:13] is on his way
[36:15] and i want to praise and give glory to
[36:18] god for this golden hour
[36:22] that we are living in
[36:25] and that he has brought us
[36:27] into a state of perfect realization
[36:32] that we can clearly see and understand
[36:36] the unfolding of prophecy
[36:39] mighty god making himself clear and
[36:42] plain before us
[36:44] oh thanks be to god
[36:46] god bless you brother thinking of you
[36:49] just last night and thinking of all the
[36:52] older believers
[36:54] sorry for calling you older but
[36:58] some of the older believers i'm thinking
[37:01] of the different ones that started out
[37:05] this race way back from the old white
[37:08] church there um
[37:10] some are still here today but myself and
[37:13] wife are remarking most are gone amen
[37:17] some others barely slipped in before we
[37:20] moved from that church amen
[37:22] praise god but we thank god for his
[37:25] grace
[37:26] but see it's not that building is the
[37:28] tent
[37:29] and it's not some tent in some city or
[37:32] some state or someplace like that
[37:35] it's not some tent like brother branham
[37:38] first used to think that he had to get a
[37:40] b tent and have people in it the tent
[37:44] was his message
[37:46] amen
[37:47] just like
[37:49] is
[37:50] called his
[37:52] thing a net
[37:53] right
[37:54] and all the people would be in that and
[37:56] then out of that god is going to now do
[37:59] the separation and division and things
[38:02] of that nature so i thank god
[38:06] that i am here today
[38:08] and it's becoming so real that my thank
[38:11] god
[38:12] is even becoming more real to me
[38:15] amen it's not just
[38:18] this flippant
[38:19] uh
[38:20] without any depth or understanding where
[38:23] christians go around they're saying
[38:24] hallelujah thank you jesus thank you
[38:26] lord
[38:27] no no no no no no no this is with a
[38:30] reality that has struck the soul
[38:34] something that will never die can never
[38:36] leave
[38:37] because if he has got a hold of us
[38:41] it's not like me telling you it's not me
[38:44] telling you oh i got the holy ghost so
[38:47] you got the holy ghost well it's turned
[38:50] the other way
[38:52] he'd better have you
[38:54] hallelujah
[38:56] this is not the child trying to i'm
[38:58] holding on lord i might make it no the
[39:02] child is not now holding on to the
[39:04] parent the parent took his hand and
[39:07] grabbed a hold and said look we're going
[39:10] to cross this river of jordan and i got
[39:13] a hold of you don't worry about to sing
[39:16] because i got you
[39:18] thank god we're in his hands
[39:22] is that right
[39:25] i haven't lost one and i want last one
[39:28] not one
[39:29] every one of joseph's bones coming out
[39:32] of egypt
[39:35] praise god i thank god for his grace on
[39:39] and the overflowing
[39:41] of his holy spirit amen oh my praise god
[39:46] inspiration is starting to strike me i
[39:47] was about just about to say something
[39:50] that is that that little thought alone
[39:54] that just passed by me the whole message
[39:58] so i just leave that i can pick up on it
[40:02] and expand another time praise the lord
[40:06] i want to say though before beginning to
[40:08] preach
[40:09] that um we would like to
[40:12] have you donate
[40:15] towards the ukraine and the people of
[40:17] the ukraine
[40:19] who are suffering we know there are wars
[40:21] all the time
[40:22] but we we certainly feel a
[40:26] an urge to do this you know when i say
[40:28] the people of ukraine we are not going
[40:31] to donate because we have brethren there
[40:35] we literally have a lot of churches
[40:37] there
[40:38] but outside of that we
[40:41] our hearts are open for everybody we
[40:43] don't care because we don't even know
[40:46] amongst the rest who is uh hiding up or
[40:49] who is still hidden waiting to be
[40:52] unveiled we don't know so we want to
[40:55] support them as much as we can let's do
[40:57] the little we can
[40:59] right
[41:01] and
[41:02] our little with somebody else's little
[41:04] and whatever it will come together right
[41:08] and i'm saying that not because uh
[41:11] brothers churches
[41:12] uh you know people sending me uh email
[41:16] and texas and then i'm getting it even
[41:19] from
[41:20] the government like donations centers
[41:23] stuff like that right but other than
[41:26] that we must pay attention to those
[41:28] things amen that doesn't mean we're
[41:30] gonna donate to every war every time we
[41:32] are we're going to be donating but i
[41:35] feel that we ought to do something here
[41:37] now
[41:38] all right so those of you would wish to
[41:40] do that and you're able to do it today
[41:43] fine if not during the week you can
[41:45] always send something
[41:48] to our treasurer uh here and it will be
[41:50] a blessing amen we'll put it together
[41:53] and we'll send it out the government has
[41:55] said they will match whatever so if uh
[41:59] if we give 10 million well bless god
[42:06] i'm correcting myself i'm not saying if
[42:08] you give 10 million
[42:10] but of course if the lord has blessed
[42:12] you quietly and you want to give that
[42:15] that's up to you but i'm just saying
[42:17] whatever we give the government has
[42:19] promised to match it
[42:21] right
[42:22] and to be a blessing to those people
[42:25] don't let the devil get you to become so
[42:28] callous
[42:29] that because you've seen war on tv war
[42:31] and tv killing on tv bombing on tv until
[42:34] there's no more of this
[42:36] it become a picture on the screen
[42:39] and it's not real anymore except for
[42:42] a video game you see he's desensitizing
[42:46] the people and they don't know
[42:48] he's doing that all the time but that's
[42:50] not my subject today but i thought i'd
[42:53] like to mention that before going in to
[42:56] the word praise the lord
[42:59] hallelujah
[43:01] now we're going to um
[43:04] look into the bible but before i give
[43:07] you that let me say this
[43:10] that we will be talking from
[43:13] revelation chapter 5.
[43:17] and uh
[43:19] brothers put this up on the screen
[43:21] because we're going to read the entire
[43:22] chapter
[43:25] revelation chapter 5
[43:27] and we are going to pay
[43:29] um
[43:30] a little more attention to revelation
[43:35] chapter 5 verse 5
[43:39] and 6.
[43:42] and i just want you to know before we
[43:45] start that 5 is really the number of
[43:47] grace
[43:49] and i believe in the mathematics of
[43:52] god's scriptures and in everything god
[43:54] does he is accurate
[43:57] and he has placed this
[43:59] opening of the doorway of grace
[44:02] right in chapter five
[44:05] and then
[44:07] verse five
[44:08] this is when the kinsmen redeemer steps
[44:11] forth
[44:12] five grace again
[44:14] and the last will be our rapture
[44:18] amen
[44:19] so this is not six six six but five five
[44:22] five
[44:24] and we're out of here by the grace of
[44:26] god
[44:27] blessed be his name
[44:30] look
[44:31] let us read god's precious word
[44:37] and i saw in the right hand of him that
[44:40] sat on the throne
[44:42] a book written
[44:44] with in
[44:45] and on the backside sealed with seven
[44:48] seals and i saw a strong angel
[44:53] proclaiming with a loud voice
[44:55] who is worthy
[44:57] to open the book and to loose the seals
[45:00] thereof
[45:02] and no man in heaven
[45:05] nor in earth nor under the earth was
[45:08] able to open the book neither to look
[45:11] there on
[45:13] and i wept much
[45:15] because no man was found worthy to open
[45:19] and to read the book needed to look
[45:21] there on
[45:23] and one of the elders said said unto me
[45:26] weep not
[45:27] behold the lion of the tribe of judah
[45:31] the root of david had prevailed
[45:35] to open the book and to loose the seven
[45:37] seals thereof
[45:39] and i beheld
[45:41] and lo
[45:42] in the midst of the throne
[45:44] and of the four beasts
[45:47] and in the midst of the elders
[45:49] there stood a lamb
[45:52] as it had been slain
[45:54] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[45:57] are the seven spirits of god sent forth
[46:01] into all the earth
[46:03] and he came and took the book out of the
[46:06] right hand of him that sat upon the
[46:08] throne and when he had taken the book
[46:10] the four beasts and four and twenty
[46:12] elders fell down before the lamb
[46:17] having every one of them harps and
[46:19] golden vials full of orders which are
[46:23] the prayers of the saints
[46:26] and this song and new song
[46:29] saying
[46:30] the word worthy to take the book and to
[46:34] open the seals thereof
[46:37] and
[46:38] has redeemed and and i was slain and has
[46:42] redeemed us to god by thy blood out of
[46:46] every kindred
[46:48] and tongue and people and nation
[46:52] and has made us
[46:54] made us unto our god
[46:57] kings and priests
[47:00] and we shall reign on the earth
[47:04] and i beheld
[47:05] and i heard the voice of many angels
[47:09] round about the throne and the beasts
[47:12] and the elders and the number of them
[47:16] was ten thousand times ten thousand and
[47:21] thousands of thousands saying with a
[47:24] loud voice
[47:25] worthy is the lamb
[47:28] that was slain to receive power and
[47:31] riches and wisdom and strength and honor
[47:35] and glory and blessing and every
[47:38] creature which is in heaven and on the
[47:40] earth and under the earth such as are in
[47:43] the sea and all that are in them heard i
[47:48] saying blessing and honor and glory and
[47:52] power be unto him
[47:54] that sitted upon the throne and unto the
[47:57] lamb forever and ever and the four
[48:01] beasts said amen and the four and twenty
[48:05] elders fell down and worshipped him
[48:08] that liveth
[48:10] forever
[48:11] and ever you might say they worship the
[48:13] eternal one
[48:16] him that liveth forever and ever may the
[48:19] lord bless us and bless his word praise
[48:23] the written word amen
[48:26] shall we pray father we thank you for
[48:28] the reading of the word we pray that the
[48:31] holy spirit will help us to express the
[48:34] word and may you
[48:36] bless us and
[48:38] in every possible way in jesus name amen
[48:42] and amen god bless you please be seated
[48:47] today i'm not apparently here to bring
[48:49] something that may sound deep to you
[48:52] but i like i said i just want to be here
[48:56] to give thanks to god amen
[48:58] i want to praise him and thank him
[49:02] because
[49:03] as i understand more of him and what he
[49:06] has done for us
[49:08] my heart reaches out to him to give him
[49:11] all the glory honor and praise
[49:14] now in this chapter the scene is set in
[49:17] heaven
[49:18] i let us read the whole chapter because
[49:21] i wanted everybody to have a a distinct
[49:25] um
[49:26] starting point in their hearts to be
[49:29] able to understand what is happening or
[49:31] what happened
[49:34] and the cry went out
[49:38] for somebody that can take the book
[49:41] the seven seals
[49:44] of the gods mystery
[49:46] of course we know the seven seals have
[49:48] the names of the redeemed
[49:52] they their their names known only to him
[49:56] which he said ah you got a name now on
[49:59] earth but i'll give you a new name
[50:01] right so uh you'll be restored back to
[50:04] that name which you always had it's just
[50:07] that we are not amnesiac condition right
[50:10] now
[50:11] we some of us are slowly coming out of
[50:14] it
[50:14] but uh god is bringing us back to the
[50:17] original
[50:18] of where we come from
[50:21] but he made it
[50:23] made it plain
[50:25] is no man on the earth no matter how
[50:27] holy or reverent he thinks he is
[50:30] that that that could have taken this
[50:32] book
[50:32] for no man was found
[50:35] no man was found
[50:38] so god himself had to become a man
[50:42] so that he could do the the work of
[50:45] redemption
[50:48] and
[50:50] we hear the cry go out who who can take
[50:53] this book
[50:54] and john said when i looked
[50:57] at one of the elders stepped forward
[51:00] you know and and touched me on the
[51:02] shoulder because i was weeping
[51:05] i was crying
[51:07] why because he knows the names of the
[51:11] redeemed of all ages was in that book
[51:16] and not that god made him see his own
[51:18] name
[51:20] and so he began to weep
[51:23] in the presence of god
[51:25] and while he was weeping there
[51:27] one of the elders
[51:30] touched him on the shoulder
[51:32] and said weep not john
[51:35] behold
[51:36] the lion of the tribe of judah has
[51:39] prevailed
[51:42] i want to thank god
[51:44] that that lion of judah
[51:47] has prevailed
[51:48] i want to ask you
[51:50] who is that lion
[51:53] who is that lion
[51:56] praise god what's his name
[51:59] [Laughter]
[52:02] who is this root of david
[52:05] oh my
[52:07] david come from him because he was the
[52:10] root of david
[52:13] then later on physically he come out of
[52:16] david so he's called root and branch
[52:20] so
[52:21] here
[52:22] oh my
[52:23] who is this root of david
[52:26] who is this lion of the tribe of judah
[52:29] see
[52:30] when i look to see the person who was
[52:33] this lion of the tribe of judah
[52:36] when i looked to see this person who was
[52:39] the root of david i looked and all i saw
[52:43] was a lamb
[52:44] amen
[52:45] amen
[52:46] now we asked ourselves brother simon who
[52:49] is this lamb
[52:52] who is this lamb
[52:53] that stood there
[52:55] a lamb looked like it was bloody
[52:59] like it was slain
[53:01] as if it was in a battle
[53:03] as if it was a not just a regular lamb
[53:06] but
[53:08] a ram
[53:09] with two horns all the new testament
[53:13] and
[53:15] it being a battle amen and there to the
[53:19] land
[53:20] praise god hallelujah
[53:22] but this was no ordinary lamb
[53:25] it was a lamb that had seven horns
[53:28] seven horn seven perfection horns power
[53:32] saw person with perfect power
[53:35] amen we know that could only be god
[53:37] himself
[53:39] and he had seven eyes which we know
[53:43] seven again perfection eyes vision
[53:46] perfect vision
[53:48] god himself amen praise the lord and we
[53:52] ask who is this lamb praise god listen
[53:56] to a little old song here
[53:59] i am that speak to moses
[54:02] in a burning bush of fire
[54:05] i am the god of abraham
[54:08] the brighton morning star
[54:11] i am the rose of sharon
[54:14] of whence do you say that i came
[54:17] do you know my father
[54:19] can you tell his name
[54:21] oh
[54:23] who do you say that i am
[54:25] and whence do you say that i came
[54:29] do you know my father
[54:31] can you tell his name
[54:34] i am alpha
[54:36] and omega
[54:39] the beginning
[54:40] from the end
[54:42] i am
[54:43] the whole creation
[54:46] and jesus
[54:47] is his name
[54:49] what is the name of that lion jesus
[54:52] what is the name of that lamb jesus
[54:55] hallelujah so
[54:58] my subject today is really
[55:01] what what john was told by the elder he
[55:04] says the lion of the tribe of judah
[55:09] has prevailed but when he looked he saw
[55:11] a lamb
[55:13] so it's the lamb that has prevailed by
[55:17] the grace of god so i'm thankful today
[55:21] that the lamb of god has prevailed
[55:24] against every work of the devil and has
[55:26] defeated him at every point wherever he
[55:30] raises headache amen
[55:33] thank god
[55:35] the lamb has prevailed to open the seven
[55:38] seals
[55:40] because remember he said the lion has
[55:42] prevailed but he says there's to the
[55:44] lamb and he took the book
[55:47] hallelujah from the hands of the one
[55:50] hallelujah why because he's the one that
[55:53] had died he is the one that paid the
[55:55] price
[55:56] so thank god the lamb prevailed to open
[56:00] the seven seals
[56:02] on the mount of temptation
[56:06] the word
[56:07] was tested
[56:09] as to its truthfulness its veracity and
[56:13] whether it could stand the test of time
[56:16] and every time the devil came to him he
[56:19] came back it is written
[56:22] every time he came to test the word it
[56:26] is written
[56:28] every triumph temp not the lord thy god
[56:32] amen oh my and again he rebuked the
[56:37] devil hallelujah by making that
[56:40] statement to him a lot of people don't
[56:42] even see little things like that that
[56:43] jesus is plainly telling you i am the
[56:45] lord god
[56:47] chap not the lord thy god hallelujah oh
[56:51] my i want to tell you if the devil lost
[56:55] in that battle
[56:57] that battle of temptation
[56:59] which every one of us have to go through
[57:02] if you say you're so holy you are not
[57:05] tempted
[57:07] i've never been tempted in my life well
[57:10] something's certainly wrong with you
[57:12] because the bible tells us he was
[57:14] tempted
[57:15] and he was tempted in everything that
[57:18] you think you're tempted by
[57:20] only that he didn't give him to sin he
[57:22] did not he was not defeated at no point
[57:26] the devil lost the battle hallelujah the
[57:30] lamb prevailed over him
[57:32] praise god and so you must now believe
[57:36] no matter what the devil taps you with
[57:39] no matter what he does no matter how he
[57:41] comes you will prevail over the works of
[57:45] the devil because the ladder has
[57:48] prevailed
[57:48] [Applause]
[57:49] [Music]
[57:50] hallelujah
[57:52] israel
[57:53] was under roman rule
[57:57] the roman
[57:59] uh
[58:00] the roman sandal
[58:03] was upon their necks
[58:05] telling them you're defeated
[58:08] you are under
[58:10] our control in every way
[58:13] hallelujah and i want you to know when
[58:16] jesus the word
[58:18] made flesh
[58:19] came to this earth
[58:21] that listen this is a war i'm talking
[58:24] about really because i use the word
[58:26] prevail
[58:28] and that is a word used when there's a
[58:31] great battle and one side overcome the
[58:34] other side
[58:35] so here it is i want you to see it's a
[58:37] long running battle i didn't want to go
[58:39] back to heaven and michael and the
[58:41] angels and the war and i would come down
[58:43] in the garden and right on down i'm just
[58:45] picking them up at this point where the
[58:48] devil is still
[58:50] warring and fighting against the word
[58:53] god jesus christ
[58:56] and now
[58:57] he comes and meets him there and
[59:01] in
[59:02] israel
[59:04] and
[59:05] he challenged him
[59:07] by always going and hiding
[59:11] and he operates behind the scenes
[59:14] like
[59:16] you see he is glamorized how jesus
[59:19] healed the sick
[59:21] how brother branham healed the sick
[59:24] how this prophet healed the sick
[59:27] he's made a glamorization out of it not
[59:30] the people don't realize that when that
[59:32] sick person was healed that was a war
[59:35] that just took place there between the
[59:37] spiritual forces of darkness of satan
[59:41] against jesus christ the word because
[59:44] every sickness brought before him
[59:46] is satan's attempt to see him fail
[59:52] and if he failed with one of those
[59:56] sicknesses discernments or or whatever
[59:59] came before him he'll say look see the
[1:00:02] word you can't trust the word you can't
[1:00:05] trust him you can't trust jesus more i'm
[1:00:08] trying to let you see this is not wasn't
[1:00:11] just a glamorized thing in the new
[1:00:13] testament when you're reading all those
[1:00:15] things all through the book of acts you
[1:00:17] think it's just funny it's nice the
[1:00:19] devil make it sound they're great man
[1:00:21] they you know they heal the sick they
[1:00:24] raise the dead and so it was a war
[1:00:29] and he brought the height behind the
[1:00:31] sickness
[1:00:33] and come to jesus
[1:00:35] lord my son is sick
[1:00:38] lord
[1:00:41] did not the people said this what do you
[1:00:43] think about it it was a constant war
[1:00:46] going on
[1:00:47] hiding behind all men or sickness
[1:00:51] all manner of blindness
[1:00:54] all venera deafness
[1:00:56] dumbness
[1:00:58] palsies
[1:00:59] strokes this has nothing to do with the
[1:01:02] people who needed the help
[1:01:05] but satan
[1:01:07] just imprisoned them and brought them to
[1:01:10] jesus as a challenge
[1:01:13] those sicknesses and those people and
[1:01:15] those demons that faced him were direct
[1:01:19] challenges of satan
[1:01:22] operating from the supernatural realm
[1:01:25] and he came against jesus the lord
[1:01:28] constantly trying to prove him that he
[1:01:31] is not true
[1:01:33] and you can't trust him whatsoever
[1:01:36] he even challenged jesus
[1:01:40] through a man
[1:01:41] that had legions of demons
[1:01:44] or praise god hallelujah
[1:01:47] and hid behind the man's
[1:01:50] depression
[1:01:51] and mental problems
[1:01:54] to try and say uh help him let me see
[1:01:56] you help him now let me see how you can
[1:01:57] get him uh oh this is not written in the
[1:02:00] bible but this is what actually
[1:02:02] let me see what you're gonna do here now
[1:02:04] since the world began nobody ever
[1:02:06] delivered let me see but jesus spoke the
[1:02:09] word cast out the devil from the man and
[1:02:13] proved that he was the supreme one amen
[1:02:16] hallelujah and we know that the lamb
[1:02:20] prevailed over the devil the devil is
[1:02:23] nothing but a loser
[1:02:25] [Applause]
[1:02:26] i said it for his disgrace and shame
[1:02:29] he's a loser
[1:02:31] and he's a liar and he will never be
[1:02:34] able to come against prevail the word
[1:02:37] against the word of the living god
[1:02:39] hallelujah
[1:02:41] oh my
[1:02:43] he even used jesus's best friend
[1:02:46] lazarus
[1:02:48] and use the little maiden you see those
[1:02:52] are things when you outwardly it will
[1:02:54] give you human sympathy because it's
[1:02:56] your friend
[1:02:58] it's a young girl yes
[1:03:00] but it was satan hiding behind that
[1:03:04] and challenging him with a spirit of
[1:03:07] death because he had tried every other
[1:03:10] trick in the book and the last enemy to
[1:03:12] be defeated was death
[1:03:14] so he brought death before him amen
[1:03:18] since the world began being seen nobody
[1:03:20] raised up from the dead like man raise
[1:03:23] up another man from the dead let me see
[1:03:25] what you're gonna do here but jesus just
[1:03:28] took up the challenge four days late
[1:03:31] deliberately to show him his lord of
[1:03:34] life and everything
[1:03:37] four days late
[1:03:39] amen and then when they're absolutely
[1:03:42] sure the devil can't play on nobody's
[1:03:44] mind and say he really wasn't dead
[1:03:46] because four days passed and he under
[1:03:49] the earth for four days and and then he
[1:03:52] just rolled back the stone amen
[1:03:54] oh my
[1:03:56] lazarus comfort
[1:03:58] hallelujah and it has as it has been
[1:04:01] said that soul that was traveling away
[1:04:04] in the eternities to go in the presence
[1:04:06] of god or the voice calling him back to
[1:04:09] himself praise god and he came right
[1:04:12] back to that body
[1:04:14] lord of god i don't know what kind of
[1:04:18] thing how he hopped out of there
[1:04:20] whatever because he was trapped right up
[1:04:22] like a mummy but thank god he said lose
[1:04:25] him and let him go
[1:04:28] [Applause]
[1:04:29] thank god
[1:04:31] that lamb has prevailed
[1:04:34] the devil is a loser
[1:04:36] hallelujah and while i'm speaking here i
[1:04:39] want you to know if you're sick if
[1:04:42] you're blind if you're deaf if you're
[1:04:44] dumb if you're crippled amen
[1:04:47] whether you're even the spirit of death
[1:04:49] hallelujah the lamb has prevailed and if
[1:04:53] you believe it you can be free right now
[1:04:55] for the glory of god
[1:04:58] and i'm not saying that because of me
[1:05:00] because the day is when these
[1:05:02] evangelists go out and
[1:05:04] and they do things like that because
[1:05:06] they want to become famous or they want
[1:05:08] people to look at them the great man or
[1:05:11] great woman or this that's gone when you
[1:05:15] recognize who is here
[1:05:18] amen
[1:05:20] whenever we come together to worship
[1:05:23] my friends you must be conscious of god
[1:05:28] you must have a real sense that there's
[1:05:31] another being inside of this building
[1:05:35] wherever you are there's another person
[1:05:38] here with us
[1:05:40] oh glory of god may the holy spirit of
[1:05:44] this world amen make his word live again
[1:05:48] and bring the realization
[1:05:50] closer to our hearts
[1:05:53] to re you see he is wanting you to know
[1:05:56] that he is not dead the devil has lied
[1:05:58] to you
[1:06:00] hallelujah but he is alive it's only
[1:06:03] that you can't see him
[1:06:05] but now and again he'll do visible
[1:06:07] things for you to know that he is behind
[1:06:09] the scenes and that he's alive
[1:06:12] that's why your sickness can leave you
[1:06:13] right now if you believe the word of god
[1:06:16] whatever it is it can grow from you if
[1:06:19] you believe the word of god
[1:06:20] [Music]
[1:06:22] hallelujah
[1:06:24] oh my
[1:06:25] thank god

[1:06:30] the devil
[1:06:32] [Music]
[1:06:34] you know the devil he's not one that
[1:06:36] just stops and gives up because you
[1:06:39] defeat him a couple of times
[1:06:41] even jesus said that he said he goes
[1:06:44] around he circles around he's come back
[1:06:47] another way
[1:06:48] and he's going to attack you again
[1:06:50] you see he knew exactly what the devil
[1:06:52] was doing with him so he can easily tell
[1:06:54] you that the devil is going to come back
[1:06:56] so the devil come back now
[1:06:58] and he used natural depth that didn't
[1:07:01] work so he come in with spiritual death
[1:07:03] now all them s worst shimmers that he
[1:07:06] could find he start to throw them at
[1:07:08] jesus send them to him bring in
[1:07:10] spiritual death now let me see what
[1:07:12] you're going gonna do with spiritual
[1:07:14] death and the first one he confronted me

[1:07:18] oh
[1:07:19] my what you gonna do about that now how
[1:07:22] you gonna bring her out but you know the
[1:07:25] story
[1:07:26] how he sat by the well and deliberately
[1:07:29] waited you challenging me
[1:07:32] you think i'm going to run somewhere and
[1:07:34] hide and
[1:07:35] dive and slip slide and try to escape

[1:07:53] because we know who is with us who is in
[1:07:55] us
[1:07:56] hallelujah amen and we know our real
[1:08:00] enemies not these natural things we see
[1:08:02] with our eyes filled with our emotions
[1:08:04] and body and stuff like that but we're
[1:08:06] fighting against spiritual power
[1:08:09] fighting against demons of of death and
[1:08:12] sickness and pain
[1:08:14] lies and everything else that's what
[1:08:16] we're fighting against and we ought to
[1:08:18] recognize what is going on in this day
[1:08:20] and hour bring before him the woman at
[1:08:23] the well and he turned around the whole
[1:08:26] battle and got the devil running in the
[1:08:28] opposite direction woman run back to the
[1:08:30] tongue oh my and you heard my message on
[1:08:33] that and as she run she threw off the
[1:08:35] bangle on her foot she threw off this
[1:08:38] she wiped the
[1:08:39] the
[1:08:40] rouge from her face she wiped off all
[1:08:43] the stuff in her mouth
[1:08:45] oh my why because she's changed
[1:08:48] transformed by the power of almighty god
[1:08:51] amen the lamb had prevailed over her
[1:08:54] life the love of god had prevailed over
[1:08:56] her life amen
[1:08:59] brought to him zacchaeus
[1:09:01] amen brought to him the rich young ruler
[1:09:04] successful businessman doing well making
[1:09:08] tons of money and everything else and
[1:09:11] that desire is upon them and he was able
[1:09:15] to say zacchaeus come down off of that
[1:09:17] high through europe amen the society
[1:09:20] might tell you that you're way up there
[1:09:23] but come down humble yourself amen hear
[1:09:26] the word of god for the day and for this
[1:09:29] hour praise god hallelujah and then the
[1:09:32] last thing he did was throw at him the
[1:09:35] teeth on the cross
[1:09:37] are you going to get out of this
[1:09:39] this man is condemned
[1:09:42] hallelujah and more than that he's
[1:09:44] condemned to die he himself tells you
[1:09:47] that he is guilty
[1:09:50] he said we know we are guilty but this
[1:09:53] just man
[1:09:54] so so in saying that he admits he was
[1:09:57] guilty he was a murderer he he he was a
[1:10:02] robber and everything else amen but the
[1:10:05] moment he turned and he said lord
[1:10:09] when you come to your kingdom remember
[1:10:12] me
[1:10:13] hallelujah
[1:10:15] that one word lord
[1:10:17] he's look a jew doesn't call nobody lord
[1:10:20] except god himself
[1:10:22] so somehow he got a slash of revelation
[1:10:25] oh my he said lord when you come into
[1:10:28] your kingdom remember me because what
[1:10:31] the kingdom was not of this world and he
[1:10:34] sees that his soul is going somewhere
[1:10:37] else and it wants that lord to be king
[1:10:40] over his soul over his life and to be
[1:10:43] right there he says today you'll be with
[1:10:46] me in paradise
[1:10:48] not after you pay indulgences
[1:10:51] not after you do 13 stations of the
[1:10:53] cross not after you go through all kinds
[1:10:56] of general flexions but today thou wilt
[1:10:58] be with me in paradise absent from the
[1:11:01] body present with the lord glory be to
[1:11:05] god that i am prevailed the blood of the
[1:11:08] bleeding lamb hallelujah prevailed over
[1:11:10] all the works of satan praise god
[1:11:13] hallelujah amen he's a loser
[1:11:17] how many knows that
[1:11:20] say it satan is a loser
[1:11:23] say he's a liar
[1:11:25] he's a chief
[1:11:27] and more than that he's nothing but a
[1:11:30] failure
[1:11:32] he's a failure
[1:11:34] and he'll continue to be a failure
[1:11:36] a creature trying to fight against his
[1:11:39] creator
[1:11:40] oh my i used to do sculpting carving and
[1:11:44] when i carved and sculpt something a
[1:11:46] man-like figure
[1:11:48] what is that thing going to do
[1:11:51] i can take it and break it and throw it
[1:11:52] away for a wish but that can't do
[1:11:54] anything to me so it's the same thing
[1:11:57] the devil who is nothing but a creature
[1:12:00] that was creature that was created to be
[1:12:02] good at the time lucifer and the bible
[1:12:06] says but his own heart turned him to
[1:12:08] evil oh my
[1:12:11] i tell you my friends he is losing a
[1:12:15] battle here he will never win
[1:12:17] you know
[1:12:18] because he can't get it in his head
[1:12:21] he thinks he's always smarter than god
[1:12:25] but he's always a loser
[1:12:29] so thinking that he still can win
[1:12:32] he went and tried to hide behind
[1:12:35] the systems
[1:12:38] the religious systems
[1:12:40] using the great teachers of the day
[1:12:44] what school you went to
[1:12:47] see it was a devil hiding behind
[1:12:50] the great rabbis and teachers of that
[1:12:53] day
[1:12:54] challenging jesus
[1:12:56] but hiding behind a religious guard
[1:13:00] and using that so in the public
[1:13:03] not in the spirit
[1:13:05] where they both know each other but in
[1:13:08] the public where the public are
[1:13:09] listening and watching when he's openly
[1:13:11] challenged
[1:13:13] jesus had to be
[1:13:14] the greater than solomon is here so that
[1:13:18] when he answer
[1:13:20] there's nothing to be said
[1:13:23] they challenge him they bring all kinds
[1:13:25] of coins to him
[1:13:27] as if they're innocent and they just
[1:13:29] want help i want to be healed i want to
[1:13:32] be held lord
[1:13:34] should we pay attacks to caesar
[1:13:37] you know
[1:13:38] and jesus just look at them and say
[1:13:40] whose emergency subscription on that
[1:13:43] coin
[1:13:44] say well well caesar he's about to
[1:13:46] render to caesar what is jesus
[1:13:49] in other words what do i have to do with
[1:13:51] that
[1:13:54] it's his so you give it back to him amen
[1:13:57] right but at the same time the devil
[1:13:59] knew he was putting out the truth there
[1:14:01] but my own with my image in it
[1:14:05] the concrete mind image in it it has to
[1:14:08] come back
[1:14:10] just like how that image kind of go back
[1:14:12] to caesar amen
[1:14:14] the lamb prevailed over him amen he used
[1:14:19] even the high priest and i think haifas
[1:14:22] and he used the legal system
[1:14:25] hiding behind pilot
[1:14:28] and try to condemn him
[1:14:31] using that to get him
[1:14:34] uh crucified thinking he's doing a great
[1:14:37] thing
[1:14:39] hallelujah but you know what paul said
[1:14:43] that that if the princes of this world
[1:14:45] knew
[1:14:46] they would not have crucified the lord
[1:14:48] of glory
[1:14:50] is that right
[1:14:51] but there when they thought that he was
[1:14:54] defeated that's when he overcome amen
[1:14:57] amen
[1:14:59] in the garden of gethsemane the devil
[1:15:02] came there with another
[1:15:04] well another warfare against him
[1:15:07] and there he was the disciples can't see
[1:15:10] in that realm so they let's think that
[1:15:12] he
[1:15:13] you know is just like he's just there
[1:15:15] praying uh praying quietly in the garden
[1:15:19] bible says he was in great anguish
[1:15:22] and he was there praying praise the lord
[1:15:26] oh my
[1:15:28] where we went where the garden is they
[1:15:32] have great big cathedrals around it it's
[1:15:34] nice beautiful but i can imagine i tried
[1:15:38] to take myself back when i was there to
[1:15:41] see
[1:15:42] when it was wild and when there was just
[1:15:44] trees and
[1:15:46] of course those some of those trees that
[1:15:48] were there is the original
[1:15:50] trees
[1:15:51] those things don't die like that and my
[1:15:54] brothers he was in anguish praying and
[1:15:58] praying to god the battle was raging
[1:16:01] because remember
[1:16:04] listen it's only when i'm going to this
[1:16:07] that i see that the holy spirit said
[1:16:10] this
[1:16:11] i want you to see what happened to him
[1:16:13] is what what daniel was going through
[1:16:16] when he prayed and he got to have an
[1:16:18] angel come and bring a message to him
[1:16:22] and he could not just answer like that
[1:16:25] he had to fight he had to be in prayer
[1:16:28] amen and he prayed and straightened the
[1:16:30] angel lord of god hallelujah and when he
[1:16:34] did glory to god all the powers of
[1:16:38] darkness all the powers of hell fighting
[1:16:41] against him in every possible way amen
[1:16:46] hallelujah but the devil didn't reckon
[1:16:49] with a fierce counter-attack from jesus
[1:16:52] he thought that he might give up at this
[1:16:55] point
[1:16:56] but no
[1:16:57] when it comes that you yourself don't
[1:16:59] die now
[1:17:01] just know yourself one day you don't
[1:17:03] have to raise nobody it's you yourself
[1:17:06] i'll challenge you now that you yourself
[1:17:08] won't die but he forgot jesus already
[1:17:11] said destroy this temple i'll raise the
[1:17:14] top
[1:17:15] in three days amen hallelujah and so
[1:17:19] he challenges him and so satan lose all
[1:17:23] the powers of hell against him that
[1:17:26] helped you see
[1:17:27] the whole human race and the devil is
[1:17:30] coming you know you know where he took
[1:17:32] the battle
[1:17:34] in the garden of gethsemane
[1:17:37] why why are you going to the garden of
[1:17:39] gethsemane because he knew that's where
[1:17:41] he got man to fall the first time in a
[1:17:44] garden
[1:17:48] so here he comes with his attack
[1:17:50] playing on the mind of playing on
[1:17:53] everything else every power he can use
[1:17:56] to play on him and attack him in the
[1:17:58] garden of gethsemane there where where
[1:18:01] he wants him to remember that's his
[1:18:02] whole your whole race fell right in the
[1:18:04] garden and you're gonna fall here again
[1:18:06] whatever amen but he battled against him
[1:18:10] and the bible says he sweated drops of
[1:18:12] blood
[1:18:13] amen look it's not ordinary
[1:18:17] that was not the ordinary battle of
[1:18:19] prayer that was the lord himself
[1:18:22] battling against the prince of darkness
[1:18:24] this was a great one of the greatest
[1:18:27] battles ever fought hallelujah but i
[1:18:29] want to say thank god the lamb prevailed

[1:23:34] that lamb lives in you and me
[1:23:36] the devil can't prevail against him dead
[1:23:38] and he can't do it now
[1:23:40] where is he that is in you
[1:23:43] then he that is in the world
[1:23:45] praise god hallelujah revelation 1 17
[1:23:49] fear not john
[1:23:52] i am the first and the last
[1:23:56] listen to this
[1:23:57] i am he that liveth and was dead
[1:24:01] listen all other men you're going to
[1:24:03] read and metusa lived for a thousand
[1:24:05] years and he died
[1:24:07] you know read about the next one or he
[1:24:09] lived so many and he died
[1:24:11] and you read them and he died but this
[1:24:13] is one who say this is not that this is
[1:24:15] the opposite now
[1:24:17] i am heath and livid and was dead
[1:24:21] amen i was dead i was under the grip of
[1:24:24] the devil and everything else but here i
[1:24:26] am as proof that the lamb has prevailed
[1:24:29] because i live forevermore praise god
[1:24:32] for he lives forever lord by the grace
[1:24:35] of god hallelujah nothing could hold him
[1:24:39] none could put him in the grave and hold
[1:24:42] him there hallelujah and so his
[1:24:45] resurrection proves that the lamb has
[1:24:49] prevailed oh my
[1:24:51] i tell you friends it must be it's a
[1:24:53] great battle
[1:24:56] this is a great battle has been and is a
[1:24:59] great battle
[1:25:00] because for the great battle now over
[1:25:04] real estate
[1:25:06] over the souls of men
[1:25:08] of course praise god you understand what
[1:25:10] i'm talking about the
[1:25:12] man's heart is the no man's land so it's
[1:25:15] a battle for real estate
[1:25:17] it's a battle
[1:25:18] for the souls of men or uh in there amen
[1:25:22] and that battle rage from the streets of
[1:25:25] bethlehem right onto the hill of gaza
[1:25:29] battling every
[1:25:31] way that he was amen and until the
[1:25:35] battle came down to the end and the
[1:25:37] devils stripped him he had over 500
[1:25:40] disciples known disciples there were
[1:25:42] many other secret ones but he had 500
[1:25:46] known disciples
[1:25:48] uh and by the time he got to the end the
[1:25:52] devil stripped him away of all of them
[1:25:54] and he left with only 120.
[1:25:58] by that time you would say his ministry
[1:25:59] is a failure
[1:26:02] because instead of it growing growing
[1:26:04] growing growing it seemed to let it come
[1:26:06] down to just 120
[1:26:10] amen hallelujah oh my by telling my
[1:26:14] friends he he had forgotten
[1:26:17] that jesus said i'm going away
[1:26:21] but when i go away i'll come again
[1:26:24] oh praise god you remember that general
[1:26:26] over there in germany when he was
[1:26:28] defeated by hitler's forces
[1:26:31] i think it's patton he said i am going
[1:26:34] away but i shall return
[1:26:36] oh and he did and defeated the powers of
[1:26:40] the german amen and took over that area
[1:26:43] for his for the glory for the glory of
[1:26:46] his nation amen hallelujah and the same
[1:26:49] jesus
[1:26:50] said that i'll go where i will return he
[1:26:53] returned on the dinner taking across to
[1:26:56] the power of the holy spirit amen
[1:26:58] and instead of one jesus the devil end
[1:27:01] up with
[1:27:02] 120 of them anointed with the same holy
[1:27:05] ghost for he broke himself up into
[1:27:08] pieces and put himself inside the spirit
[1:27:11] amen hallelujah and now
[1:27:14] hallelujah the devil tried to stomp off
[1:27:17] the fire and instead of that is
[1:27:18] scattered oh
[1:27:20] hallelujah he's end up with a forest
[1:27:23] fire a holy ghost and is keeping us
[1:27:26] alive moving in our hearts moving in our
[1:27:29] experience amen that's what he's facing
[1:27:32] now oh glory to god hallelujah amen
[1:27:36] hallelujah
[1:27:38] and since then
[1:27:39] the ministry of jesus christ has spread
[1:27:43] all around this world
[1:27:46] from that one individual whom garden
[1:27:50] dwelt and used is spread to 120
[1:27:53] and now it's a blossoming flame across
[1:27:57] the face of the entire earth amen and
[1:28:01] it's still spreading
[1:28:03] you believe that
[1:28:04] it's still spreading
[1:28:06] amen he's still searching
[1:28:08] he's still seeking
[1:28:10] amen calling out for his own hallelujah
[1:28:13] and i want to thank god that i can
[1:28:16] praise god that i'm one that he found
[1:28:19] one that was lost that was found that
[1:28:22] was blind but now i can see and i can
[1:28:24] say with all the others that went before
[1:28:27] me the lamb has prevailed
[1:28:31] amen hallelujah
[1:28:34] oh praise god hallelujah i think there's
[1:28:37] a psalm i don't know it but some of you
[1:28:39] may know it it is finished the battle is
[1:28:42] over
[1:28:43] it's finished and jesus has won
[1:28:46] praise god hallelujah it's done the lord
[1:28:50] jesus has taken the glory and the praise
[1:28:54] i'm gonna shift now um from that point
[1:28:57] of view and come to this
[1:28:59] now you know what jesus said in matthew
[1:29:02] uh when he spoke of peter receiving the
[1:29:05] revelation
[1:29:06] flesh and blood hasn't revealed this
[1:29:08] unto you but my father
[1:29:11] in heaven
[1:29:12] has revealed this unto you
[1:29:14] and upon this revelation amen this rock
[1:29:18] of revelation
[1:29:19] amen
[1:29:20] i will build my church
[1:29:23] the church was built on the word of god
[1:29:27] which was given by inspiration
[1:29:29] and should be received by inspiration
[1:29:32] and revelation but now
[1:29:35] they're queasy and they're scared and
[1:29:37] they don't when they hear that word
[1:29:38] revelation
[1:29:39] no they want everything already
[1:29:41] calculated
[1:29:43] uh systematized and already worked out
[1:29:46] by wise men of the earth and document it
[1:29:48] before they can believe
[1:29:51] if it
[1:29:51] prophet had come in them all days and
[1:29:53] said thus said the lord no i don't
[1:29:55] believe that i got to see rabbi jones
[1:29:57] after show me that in the talmud first
[1:29:59] before i believe it no that's where the
[1:30:02] church world has drifted away from the
[1:30:04] original word
[1:30:06] you remember there was no written bible
[1:30:09] when abel believed god
[1:30:13] there was no written pages of a bible
[1:30:15] when abraham believed god noah believed
[1:30:17] god elijah believed god elisha believed
[1:30:20] god no there was nothing like that
[1:30:23] but the people's
[1:30:25] faith now
[1:30:26] has gone from the unseen invisible
[1:30:31] god the invisible spirit of god
[1:30:34] and their faith is now
[1:30:36] just upon the writing of these pages
[1:30:40] and it's true
[1:30:42] it's good and we should believe it
[1:30:44] but there is this powerful being behind
[1:30:48] the scenes
[1:30:50] trying to get people said that's good
[1:30:52] but it's not that it's me
[1:30:55] i'm behind all creation
[1:30:58] i'm behind everything that's going on
[1:31:01] turn your eyes upon jesus
[1:31:04] look full in this wonderful face
[1:31:07] and the things of earth will grow
[1:31:08] strangely there
[1:31:10] in the light of his glory and grace oh
[1:31:14] thanks be unto god who given us the
[1:31:16] victory
[1:31:17] through jesus christ
[1:31:20] and so
[1:31:21] he said
[1:31:23] upon this rock i'll build my church
[1:31:27] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:31:31] against her
[1:31:32] the gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:31:35] against her
[1:31:36] so it's already prophesied
[1:31:39] that the gates of hell will not defeat
[1:31:41] god's church
[1:31:43] he already prophesied that gets ahead
[1:31:46] will come against the elect lady
[1:31:48] the gates of hell will come against the
[1:31:51] bride but let me give you an assurance
[1:31:54] oh they will not prepare against the
[1:31:58] bride of jesus christ
[1:31:59] [Applause]
[1:32:02] with all this lies
[1:32:05] despite
[1:32:06] the seven ages
[1:32:09] of warfare
[1:32:10] against the church
[1:32:13] fighting against every single messenger
[1:32:17] every one of them had a battle with the
[1:32:19] devil
[1:32:20] at their own level they had to battle
[1:32:22] him but every one of them defeated him
[1:32:26] and they established a portion of that
[1:32:29] building that he was building with his
[1:32:31] justification sanctification baptism
[1:32:33] holy ghost now the holy ghost himself is
[1:32:36] on the scene
[1:32:38] hallelujah i don't just want to be
[1:32:40] baptized with him i want him to possess
[1:32:44] me control me i have preeminence over me
[1:32:47] amen hallelujah i want to thank god that
[1:32:51] no matter all these seven church ages of
[1:32:54] blinding god's people
[1:32:57] call grinding them amen doing all the
[1:33:00] works of man and things of that nature
[1:33:03] all of that i want to thank god
[1:33:07] that all seven locks of samson
[1:33:10] has grown back
[1:33:12] all of the word that was lost during the
[1:33:15] dark ages of church history have been
[1:33:18] restored like a word of god and the
[1:33:21] power of the holy spirit and it's
[1:33:23] through that restoration that we are
[1:33:25] here today seeing what you're seeing and
[1:33:28] rejoicing in what we're rejoicing amen
[1:33:31] oh
[1:33:32] what a hour what a day what a time we're
[1:33:34] living in
[1:33:36] whoa
[1:33:37] very few
[1:33:38] can even see and recognize what i am
[1:33:41] talking about
[1:33:43] matter of fact i go into some churches
[1:33:45] and try to preach like this they'll kick
[1:33:46] you out yeah
[1:33:48] i was in detroit preaching there and the
[1:33:50] bishop was so mad
[1:33:52] he lost all his senses
[1:33:55] because instead of walking you know how
[1:33:57] they walk like a real
[1:33:59] real gentleman reverend like that he got
[1:34:02] so mad he was climbing across the views
[1:34:05] he forgot about the people and everybody
[1:34:07] he met to
[1:34:08] tear me limb from limb
[1:34:12] anyway i will tell you that story
[1:34:17] oh my
[1:34:19] praise god hallelujah
[1:34:22] oh my
[1:34:23] thank god
[1:34:25] that he sent an angel to us
[1:34:27] like he did to daniel
[1:34:30] to bring a message to us
[1:34:33] but that angel turned around and said
[1:34:35] daniel you think i got here easy
[1:34:38] i had to fight against the prince of
[1:34:40] persia before i could get here
[1:34:44] oh my and you must imagine that the
[1:34:47] angel to the church of this last day
[1:34:51] what a battle he had
[1:34:54] no we got to enter in and understand he
[1:34:56] didn't just come and bring out a
[1:34:58] chocolate message or some nice
[1:35:00] deliberation to us he paid a price
[1:35:04] he had to fight against the works of the
[1:35:07] devil the works of the flesh temptation
[1:35:10] sin everything else he had to fight and
[1:35:12] to overcome for the glory of god before
[1:35:15] he can deliver that message to us
[1:35:18] hallelujah amen and so this bride
[1:35:22] ultimate thankful
[1:35:25] that god sent a messenger that god sent
[1:35:29] an angel
[1:35:30] and the word has come true to us
[1:35:33] and now we can rise up in the name of
[1:35:36] jesus christ knowing that the word has
[1:35:38] come into our hearts
[1:35:41] amen the lamb has prevailed
[1:35:45] not that the lamb prevailed back then
[1:35:48] but the lamb has prevailed now in our
[1:35:52] day and in our time
[1:35:55] seven church ages
[1:35:57] the devil tried to overcome god's bride
[1:36:01] with all kinds of spiritual blindness
[1:36:04] i was spiritually blind
[1:36:08] i was in uh the
[1:36:11] assembly of god denomination
[1:36:15] and uh
[1:36:17] i spent years in there
[1:36:20] and spiritually blind
[1:36:22] but then when god began to open my eyes
[1:36:26] not from bible school not from bible
[1:36:28] teaching but from
[1:36:30] lots of prayer and and waiting in the
[1:36:33] presence of god read the scripture then
[1:36:36] he begins to show you look at this over
[1:36:38] here
[1:36:39] look at this over here
[1:36:41] then then i told you men are casting out
[1:36:43] of a devil and then the devil starts
[1:36:45] speaking in tongues and right away the
[1:36:47] holy spirit said see
[1:36:49] thomas is not the genuine evidence of
[1:36:51] the holy spirit it's an evidence but
[1:36:54] it's not the
[1:36:56] initial evidence
[1:36:58] so that is a false doctrine it's wrong
[1:37:01] and right then even though i was still
[1:37:03] in the nomination i recognize that so it
[1:37:07] doesn't matter who come to me speak in
[1:37:08] the dumps it didn't matter the spirit of
[1:37:12] god would still discern that thing and
[1:37:14] recognize exactly what it was praise the
[1:37:17] lord amen but the church
[1:37:20] had to go through a period of spiritual
[1:37:23] blindness
[1:37:25] not recognizing the word
[1:37:28] not recognizing who was really their god
[1:37:33] distracted
[1:37:35] by the devil
[1:37:36] clouds of darkness
[1:37:39] and
[1:37:40] the devil put on you times of depression
[1:37:45] you're in the church
[1:37:47] you're reading your bible you're praying
[1:37:49] and still you're mentally confused
[1:37:53] you'll get an oppression
[1:37:55] right in there
[1:37:56] because
[1:37:58] something in you is thirsting and
[1:37:59] longing
[1:38:00] but what they were giving you could not
[1:38:02] bring you to that place
[1:38:05] of satisfaction
[1:38:07] to recognize who you really are
[1:38:10] amen but thank god
[1:38:12] just as in the battle that he had down
[1:38:16] in
[1:38:17] under the earth in the pit of hell let
[1:38:20] me tell you hell is on earth now
[1:38:23] and the holy ghost has come down
[1:38:26] and there's another battle going on
[1:38:29] for the souls of men that are imprisoned
[1:38:31] not then
[1:38:33] now
[1:38:34] oh my
[1:38:36] the same one who preached back there to
[1:38:38] them spirits in prison is preaching the
[1:38:41] word again the ministry of the holy
[1:38:43] spirit continues by the word of god to
[1:38:46] set his people free oh lord god
[1:38:49] hallelujah amen
[1:38:52] imprison you in all kinds of
[1:38:54] denominational systems
[1:38:57] and as i've used the term
[1:38:59] prisons with stained glass windows
[1:39:02] got you in there it's so glamorous it's
[1:39:04] so wonderful you fail to realize you're
[1:39:07] in a prison
[1:39:09] like a nice race horse
[1:39:11] that's right there kept inside of the
[1:39:14] paddock
[1:39:15] and he's allowed to run around as long
[1:39:17] as he stays within the boundaries of
[1:39:20] our teaching
[1:39:21] as long as he stays within the
[1:39:23] boundaries of our paddle he is free
[1:39:26] yeah yeah you're free but only in that
[1:39:29] but you're not free to go wherever god's
[1:39:32] holy spirit will lead you oh my oh
[1:39:35] praise god my brother i tell you i thank
[1:39:39] god the devil use every possible thing
[1:39:42] even knock us over the head and let us
[1:39:44] go deeper into the spiritual amnesia
[1:39:47] amen
[1:39:49] you know praise god
[1:39:51] god bless you because look if he hits
[1:39:53] you so hard you might start seeing stars
[1:39:57] [Music]
[1:40:02] and if you see stars you might start to
[1:40:04] see some light
[1:40:06] once you start getting some light the
[1:40:08] whole thing may open up to you
[1:40:10] and when you see the book open to you
[1:40:12] the bible will become a new bible
[1:40:15] becomes a new bible when the book opens
[1:40:17] up to you and you begin to start seeing
[1:40:20] god amen i want to thank god he's
[1:40:22] brought me out to my depression
[1:40:25] he brought he has brought me and he is
[1:40:28] bringing me day by day out of my
[1:40:30] spiritual amnesia amen
[1:40:33] [Music]
[1:40:36] i'm reading the bible and i pass by a
[1:40:39] familiar place
[1:40:43] it brings me back to myself
[1:40:45] right when i read certain scripture oh
[1:40:49] my it's like i read this before
[1:40:51] how can i know this i never really read
[1:40:54] it naturally but spiritually it's like i
[1:40:56] knew this before how did i know that how
[1:40:59] did you know it you're coming out of
[1:41:00] your amnesia

[1:41:07] school room back to their old house make
[1:41:10] them meet some people that they used to
[1:41:12] know hoping that one day
[1:41:15] they will say oh oh i know you
[1:41:18] oh praise god hallelujah amen that's
[1:41:21] what happened that the word of god was
[1:41:23] preached in front of us oh praise god
[1:41:26] until one day we woke up oh it is jesus
[1:41:29] praise god hallelujah and the lamb
[1:41:32] prevailed over my soul
[1:41:34] and i'm his and he is mine amen thanks
[1:41:37] be to god hallelujah i'll tell you
[1:41:40] friends
[1:41:41] there was a time when i'm going to wind
[1:41:42] this up now
[1:41:44] when israel was on the occupation
[1:41:47] and the devil had his hands upon them
[1:41:50] the more bites and all those people were
[1:41:52] all around them
[1:41:54] and there came forth one by the name of
[1:41:56] goliath
[1:41:58] and goliath was threatening god's people
[1:42:01] behold the threatenings
[1:42:04] oh
[1:42:05] and he started to threaten god's people
[1:42:07] in every possible way there
[1:42:10] but thank god
[1:42:12] there was a little david
[1:42:14] and you know how david rose up against
[1:42:17] goliath
[1:42:18] and what did david have
[1:42:20] that goliath could laugh at him
[1:42:23] because he didn't have nothing
[1:42:25] all he had was
[1:42:27] uh a slim shot
[1:42:30] and some uh stones from inside of
[1:42:34] a brook
[1:42:35] hey man
[1:42:36] he pick up those revelations out of the
[1:42:38] waters of the world
[1:42:40] and uh five of them stones he got there
[1:42:43] and he grabbed one of them put it in a
[1:42:46] slingshot and whipped the slingshot
[1:42:49] right straight and it hit the devil
[1:42:52] right in his forehead
[1:42:54] it didn't hit him in his neck to stop
[1:42:56] him from talking
[1:42:57] it didn't hit him on his shoulder to
[1:42:59] stop him from using his weapon but it
[1:43:02] hit him right in the center of his
[1:43:04] forehead
[1:43:05] amen you realize that david a little boy
[1:43:08] couldn't throw that stone like that
[1:43:10] that far with that kind of force when
[1:43:13] david lose it god's hand took it
[1:43:17] hallelujah it was the hand of god
[1:43:21] he struck the devil because remember
[1:43:24] those philistines and those people where

[1:43:34] after that and it covered them and only
[1:43:36] this part of their faces out so it went
[1:43:39] and it punctured and pushed in that
[1:43:42] metal until it burst his brains when the
[1:43:45] word of god struck him

[1:47:35] together as one
[1:47:38] before we leave this place
[1:47:42] let us together start
[1:47:45] and i saw
[1:47:47] in the right hand of him that sat on the
[1:47:51] throne
[1:47:52] a book written within
[1:47:54] on the backside
[1:47:56] sealed with seven seals
[1:47:59] and i saw a strong angel
[1:48:02] proclaiming with a loud voice
[1:48:04] who is worthy to open the book and to
[1:48:08] loose the seals thereof
[1:48:11] and no man
[1:48:12] in heaven nor in earth
[1:48:15] neither under the earth was able to open
[1:48:18] the box
[1:48:20] neither to look there at all
[1:48:23] and i wept much
[1:48:25] because no man was found worthy to open
[1:48:30] and to read the book needed to look
[1:48:32] there upon
[1:48:35] and one of the elders said unto me
[1:48:38] would not
[1:48:39] be all the lion of the tribe
[1:48:42] of judah
[1:48:44] the root of david
[1:48:46] had prevailed to open the book and to
[1:48:50] loose the seven seals thereof
[1:48:53] and i beheld
[1:48:54] and lo
[1:48:56] in the midst of the troll and of the
[1:48:58] four beasts and in the midst of the
[1:49:01] elders
[1:49:02] stood a lamb as it had been slain
[1:49:05] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[1:49:08] are the seven spirits of god sent forth
[1:49:11] into all the earth
[1:49:13] and he came
[1:49:14] and took the book out of the right hand
[1:49:17] of him that sat upon the troll
[1:49:20] and when he had taken the book
[1:49:23] four beasts and four and twenty elders
[1:49:26] fell down before the lamb having every
[1:49:30] one of them hearts
[1:49:32] golden vials full of orders which are
[1:49:35] the prayers of the saints
[1:49:37] and they sung a new song
[1:49:40] saying the word worthy to take the book
[1:49:44] and to open the seals thereof
[1:49:47] for thou slain
[1:49:49] and has redeemed us to god
[1:49:51] by thy blood
[1:49:53] out of every kindred and town
[1:49:55] and people and nations and has made us
[1:49:58] unto our god
[1:50:00] kings and priests and we shall reign on
[1:50:03] the earth
[1:50:04] and i be hell
[1:50:06] and i heard the voice of many angels
[1:50:09] round about the throne
[1:50:12] and the peace
[1:50:13] and the elders
[1:50:15] and the number of them was ten thousand
[1:50:18] ten thousand and thousands of thousands
[1:50:22] saying with a loud voice worthy as the
[1:50:25] lamb
[1:50:27] that was slain to receive power and
[1:50:29] riches and wisdom and strength and honor
[1:50:33] and glory and blessing
[1:50:36] and every creature which was in heaven
[1:50:39] and on the earth and under the earth and
[1:50:41] such as are in the sea and all that are
[1:50:44] in them heard i saying blessing and
[1:50:47] honor glory and power be unto him that
[1:50:51] sitteth upon the throne
[1:50:52] unto the lamb forever and ever and the
[1:50:56] four be said amen
[1:51:00] and the four and twenty elders fell down
[1:51:03] and worshiped him
[1:51:05] that liveth
[1:51:07] forever
[1:51:08] and ever jesus the eternal one receiving
