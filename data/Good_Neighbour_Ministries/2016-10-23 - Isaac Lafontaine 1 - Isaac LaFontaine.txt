whichever direction he wants to go whatever God's spirit leads him to do it will be entirely in his hands of course under the leadership of the holy spirit amen and we thank the Lord for the great precious Holy Spirit among us when we come like this uh you know that uh we meet each other after the week we're Happ to see one another and all that but really When We Gather like this is because we want to gather into the presence of the Lord and the presence of the Lord is our food that is what we feed on we feed on him Satan feeds on his children but God lets his children feed on him life we're so thankful this morning that we are part of what God is doing in this hour that God is up to something big and that we a part of it I'm glad that I'm a part of what God is doing maybe just a small piece but just let us do our part and fulfill our purpose while we are here on the face of the Earth uh let me give you a few quotations here as a background for this for inspiration uh for Supernatural communication of the Holy Spirit to brother eagles eat Eagles food MH is that right you can't be a chicken and a chicken can't be an eagle because Eagles have a scream but chickens are cheap chap cheap cheap right they always cheap it's one of the cheapest meat you can even R right so we are eagles praise God what the 6 weeks whatever you can have a chicken grown up and ready to to sell go to market it takes a year for one Eagle to even start to grow and to come forth so we ain't cheap God put us here and it cost us the price the precious blood of Christ hallelujah praise the Lord You're a part of the eagle family so it means you're Heavenly minded your spirit came from God who created the Heaven if you're his child then you'll say Amen the prophet said it let's all say it amen praise the lord we say Amen to everything God does and when the Holy Spirit screams over the building screams over the people works Among Us God showing to his people that he's the same yesterday today and forever we all want to shout he amen praise the Lord hallelujah we a part of the family of God hallelujah whever family of St whether it's in Ohio Pennsylvania Africa Peru wherever that family of God is we are a part of that family and we have to give God praise and H because we are a Heavenly people trapped in an Earthly body but one day we we come from God we're going back to God and now we thank the Lord for our brother uh this ministering spirit that God has sent here among us we pray that the great anointing of the holy spirit will rest upon our brother because even the ministry of the word is a supernatural thing even though it's just simple we just stand there and we seems like we're just talking and sharing with you what is in our hearts but at the same time listen for for the voice behind the voice and hear what God is saying to you as an individual sending down spiritual food and Jew season and handfuls of blessing on purpose may the Lord bless you let us stand in respect to the word of God and in respect to the minister the man of God who is going to stand here in the place of the Eternal one who brought the fullness of the word to us our gracious Heavenly Father you have made me pastor of this local Church Father I thank you that you sent our brother and his family our way and we know and have the confidence because of the gene that is in this family that your blessing will flow through him God hiding in Simplicity Hallelujah God Ministry is different but it's the same God granted father that the great holy spirit will bless him and his entire family and today together we'll Fellowship down here like we Fellowship up there and raise our hands and praise God if we have to shout we'll shout father if we have to stop we'll stop lord if we have to sing We have sing father but we are here oh God to give you glory Glory oh as the redeemed have gathered in hallah take praise honor and Glory today in Jesus name amen and amen are you ready for this are you ready for amen well he he said brother Isaac I almost took off running up here that that was a great introduction wasn't it uh I hope you're here to see more than just me we're

years old uh well I tell you what the impact of young people on uh on the Believers worldwide if you get an opportunity to go young people if there's never an opportunity for you to do that it's a lifechanging experience for you but when you get on the ground in another country and they see The Believer from Canada or Believer from the United States came uh a young person like that so encouraging to all of the Saints uh and other places especially third world Nations like the Philippines sister a great blessing and then of course my lovely wife Amanda I'm so uh proud and happy to be here and you're familiar with the rest of the family and all the singing We we don't usually go out by ourselves like this and and sing but uh Pastor Simon said is absolutely correct that there's an anointing that comes from in the family and it come the Lord just seems to bless when we begin to put notes in the air and begin to sing and uh gives us inspiration for songs and and it's just been a blessing to know that here in this part of the country Pastor Simon the church here has always been so support our family and it's been a great blessing I have a little testimony about that but I'll take the time for it right now just sing some songs I amen if you know the song just sing along worship song You Know there's that could ever come close nothing can compare you're our living hopeall

of hisory I know but to me I must be sure that he's alive amen but you see that's not all there is is to know Jesus see there's a light that comes from knowing him as Lord when it comes to knowing Christ it's all or nothing so until I have all I know that I need more that's not all there is to KN Jesus there's a life that comes out of knowing him as Lord Lord so when it comes to knowing Christ
