TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] christian walk carefully christian walk carefully christian walk carefully danger is near yes friends i greet you once again and giving him praise honor and glory i'm glad that we are here together again and this is the final days of the year 2021 but we are here kept by the power of god through these tumultuous and trying times but god has brought us thus far by faith and he is able to take us home may the lord bless our study this evening this will be a brief study on the philadelphian church age speaking on the topic of false believers the judgment on false believers and our scripture for this evening will be found or is found in revelation chapter 3 verse 9. behold i will make them of the synagogue of satan which say they are jews and are not but do lie behold i will make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that i have loved thee let us pray loving wonderful father we love thee we praise you we worship and adore you we bow down before you we lift you up in this world of sin o god may the holy spirit reflect himself through us may he be glorified may the word of god live again oh spirit the vine may the graciousness of the outpouring of your love and redemptive mercy come upon your people by the instrumentality of the quickened world that you may be receive all the glory all the honor and the praise in the name of jesus as you teach us your way father amen and amen now we note here carefully within this worth that the spirit of god is pointing out to us a problem a problem through the ages of church ages of time and that problem is the problem of false believers and they were or have been in existence since the ending of the very first age right on to this time coming through their springtime of growth their springtime of germination and coming on down through their time of growth and now they are in the time of their fall where they're going to their death because it's come to its rightening process and ready to go and to be burnt as tears in the presence of god by his spoken word now these false believers the bible calls them false jews at that time that applied and was spoken of of the jews the application that is being made this evening is towards believers of christian faith but are found false to their core they have not the real the true spirit of christ they're not really truly born again they do not produce or bring forth the true pure doctrine or word of god but they do lie they misrepresent they misplace they dislocate and do everything within their power maybe not consciously but by being tools of satan they are there to infiltrate and disseminate his evil and to destroy the foundations of the bride tree and the body of jesus christ and we are here to raise up a standard in the name of our lord jesus to come against these unseen works of these unseen devils that are operating in the religious realm now we know that the devil is a counterfeit and therefore his false believers had to appear after the genuine apostolic fate was on the scene once that apostolic faith appeared under the ministry of those wonderful man of god as we found and read of uh in the book of acts then he had a pattern from which he could copy and he is a good copycat once somebody else produces something then he is able to copy it and makes his copy seem to be better when in reality it is inferior to the original that was produced by god spoken word now these people falsely call themselves jews uh we found recently even in our newspapers some that were uh projecting themselves as indians as they were north american indians uh born with that genealogy and then under investigation it was found that this was not so however i'm pointing you to the spiritual aspect of this that many claim to be christian many claim to be believers many claim to be message believers many claim to be believers of the prophet and the bible tells us and the spirit speaks in this hour that they lie and this is not so but these these false believers they always appear after the appearance of the original seed the original believers on the scene they they appeared right after the outpouring of the holy spirit on the day of pentecost and when the move of god continued on and satan had enough time to make his molds his cookie cutter molds that he could create or create his so-called christians and place them uh there within christian ranks uh to infiltrate and to disseminate his evil then we understand paul began to see this the apostles began to discern this in their midst and paul began to speak of ravenous wolves men rising up from among your own cells deceivers liars contrary to the word of god for this day and for the hour and their deceivers up to the brethren using the very same word that is being declared now i want you to see they appeared at the ending of the first age they appeared again in the second age they appeared again in the third age you see their appearance like that is no accident it is absolutely a satanic strategy a demonic plan that comes from the perverted twisted and darkened mind of satan and is presented here up on the earth as we are presented by the mind of god they're presented by the mind on thinking of satan we are not uh physically we are creations but spiritually we come from god and we go to god and those who come from satan will return back to their origin where they come from when their task is over now the principle of satan or the strategy of satan is this i want you to listen carefully because this applies down through the ages until this time in every realm natural and spiritual you can make this application and clearly see in the word of god satan's strategy his strategy my friends is always to claim originality after that the original has gone forth after the uh reel has gone forth then he comes with with his copies he comes with his presumptions and his ideas and presents them claiming originality with them and therefore since he claims originality he claims that he should have certain rights and certain privileges along with that amen now back in the smyrna church age those people lied they told so many lies that there were actually jews like people that they in the various churches claiming that they're christians but not everyone that says they're christian means that they are a christian but lie see and when they do that my friends they are not really believers some who claim they're jews they are not really jews even to this day many claim they're jews they are not jews and others who claim they are christian and they are really not christian there are real jews and there are genuine christians amen but there are multitudes of these false believers of either faith oh my they definitely are not because they do not have the truth within them amen now think of it my brothers amen how they come from the synagogue of satan come from the church the temple of satan the place where they worship him and ah they worship him by organization amen and there none other than his satan's organized crowd that he has collected and put together like nimrod did in the book of genesis organizing the first armies to fight against other nations and subdue them and his his main thought was to dominate to be a dominator uh or you may twist the word a denominator and to denominate uh dominate over all the people whether naturally back then but now with spiritual domination sought by this evil cruel subtle uh strategy of satan that worked and is now working within the body of jesus christ so we are presented with this problem of false believers and almost every preacher whether he's true false mid in midway bottom of the pack top of the pack doesn't matter where he is he will become conscious and aware that this is a common problem that is everywhere regardless of how much that preacher tries whatever he does it has nothing to do with him there's another there's a battle going on a backlog great contest between god and satan yes sir between the true and the false wisdom versus faith amen light versus darkness it's here upon us and we are just represented representatives of either side or praise god as we look into the word of god we see satan using his organized crowd placing them even into the ministry not just in the membership but just place them in the ministry do you know that that satan is now dominating most puppets dominating most church leadership do you know he has raised himself to high places dominating from these high places but take god the true believer the elected of god the true saints of god are lifted up into heavenly places of revelation understanding that they might truly know how to use the sword of the spirit to come against the unbelieving works of satan and his works of darkness yes they're in the ministry dominating and denominating everywhere trying to bring everything under their unwarranted on scriptural leadership not given by god and they're doing that even over there they're ministering brethren they want to be bishops want to be cardinals they want to be whatever else but always over over oppressing their own brothers fellow ministers and dominating over them in every way these are some of the fruits of satan's organized crowd now the next thing we saw in the third age that there was definitely a place called satan's seat because you see he was like a raven raven flying around from the ark searching for somewhere to set his feet and he found a place where he could set his feet on the rotten corpse of unbelief and there feast himself the fullness with the stink and the stench of sin and them my friends the bible said he established a certain place which the bible calls satan's seat seat settled he's found a place where he can work out of there as a headquarters as a place from which he can disseminate operate uh all of his evil webs of unbelief and there my friends he had the power of the state behind him he set up his seat and that age gave us a church and state marriage where he could have the state behind him giving him power backing him up and making that church almost physically invincible but god through the ministry of martin luther a mighty fortress is our god a bulwark never failing our helper he emits the flood of mortal ills prevailing oh praise god forevermore and so god broke through my friends and broke their hold with the over the power of the state and the reformation brought light to the eyes of many of those who sat in ecclesiastical darkness all church spiritual ignorance they sat in darkness but god sent the glimmers of light but after a while the lutherans themselves organized and joined with the same state and again we see or saw the synagogue of satan once again manifested in the sixth age there in this sixth age as uh we know it to be oh now in our day of course this synagogue of satan group they wouldn't say they are of the synagogue of satan no by now he has copied this thing so close that it would deceive the elected if it were possible he has copied the the virtues uh the the the actor and the drama of of the virtues and these things fruits of the spirit oh my he can show them he can cause his people to manifest them even better sometimes than the original seed that will deceive you that he has originality and he has certain rights privileges authorities and powers to be able to say and do the things that he says and does and claims however thank god that god sent a prophet oh my no sir they're not of god they are of their father the devil for they are liars and he was and still is a liar from his beginning from the beginning and upon whomever he falls amen king or commoner and he gets on them and anoints them they become a fountain of lies oh yes they become a source of error such evil web that can entrap millions yes millions not with ropes and chains but ropes and chains but they are chained by in prisons of their mind and so the devil gets a hold of them and they're caught in it oh praise god they lie they lie by their dress their lie by their looks they were all the christian garb all the christian talk all the phraseologies all the so-called christian culture created by satan uh and uh there they find themselves perfection within the circumference of that so-called culture and if they can project the perfection of that culture they think they have perfection holiness and all those marvelous things that can't be bought so taught or anything but is only received by the marvelous amazing grace of our lord jesus christ here we find my friends that a christian or a jew is not a jew outwardly not by just outward acts of keeping traditions of keeping the so-called fate lighting candles doing feasts doing fasts or whatever it's not based upon that at all for salvation is of the lord not of works not of righteousness or anything by which we can boast but by the word of god being revealed to the individual one is not a jew outwardly but a jew inwardly one is not a christian outwardly because they were christian uh where uh they're dressed like a christian talk like a christian walk like a christian and stuff like that that doesn't make one a christian that could be such a cunning deceiver shaped patterned by satan for this last age where believers have to have the eagle eyes of the spirit of almighty god to be able to discern the true and the false oh not even what i am just telling you but something in you the bible tells us true believers will have within them you have a witness within you made that witness witness to you right now that what you are hearing is the word of god may the holy spirit witness if you claim you have him may he witness to you what you're hearing that it is the truth out of the word of god hallelujah spoken by the prophet of malachi 4 5 spoken by the voice of the mighty angel thus which is the seventh angel spoken by that instrument of god and now spoken by me and many others as members of that supernatural invisible body called the bride of jesus christ the manifestation of the son of man once again being revealed hallelujah under a different skin under a different badger skin under a different veil but the same voice listen closely my friends he is the same god that uses varieties of men and women children around the world and he will use and whoever whatever he wills to get his message true to speak to his own to call out his bride his original seed bring them to consciousness of himself be conscious of god and recognize the heart that you're living in my friends and the message of this day that you are supposed to receive praise god hallelujah false juice back then they had the problem now we have the problem of false believers that have come in like weeds placed there by the false sewer that came by night and in the darkness of ignorance planted his false seed among the wheat that was planted by the original sower amen but they are false according to jude chapter 9 jude 19 says having not the spirit that don't have the holy spirit but we know true children of god are born of the spirit these have not the spirit and therefore they are not the children of god no matter how fervently they protest no matter how fervently and emotionally they say it and to what lengths they go to prove that they are they are not they claim they are living but they are dead they are absolutely dead to the word of god for their children of the organization not of the word of god and they're not bearing the true fruits of the word of god or what the word of god will produce in them and through them oh my yes sir they built themselves up upon their own creeds dogmas various doctrines and theologies from the seminaries of man think about it friends i'm saying it but only the spirit can take the words i am saying and cause them to explode within your heart within your soul and to give you real true meaning and understanding to what is being said and beyond what is verbally and vocally said or can be heard oh praise god hallelujah they're dead built upon the signs of darkness various false doctrines and the truth is not in them for they have not taken their own counsel or their wisdom from the word of god but they take it from a college of uh so-called cardinals or they take it from the college of presbyteries or the college of this or the university of that but they do not take it from the unfailing or infallible word of the living god look friends what we are saying here is that if you were to clearly look at the church of jesus christ through the ages even to this age and to this time you will see that within the framework of the bri of the body of christ there are two vines with their branches intertwined and tangled together where it's hard for the natural man to separate the two as the bible says don't pluck them up right now you know them it's okay for you to recognize and know them but don't pluck them up right now the time will come out send the angels that will begin to pluck them up identify them and point them out so they can be plucked out and uh and that he can receive his own glory two different vines two different spirits within the framework of the church of god listen this is nothing new this is in your bible this is the scripture this was in the book of genesis there came an abel within eve's body or one of god one of the devil so it is in our day we can track that or trace that separate seed down through the bible right to this time but we are speaking on the present time that there are these two opposing spirits or vines within the framework of what we call the church of god take the example of jesus and judas jesus was the son of god or the body in which jehovah dwelt and here was judas whom the bible calls he was the son of perdition or the body in which satan actually used for him for his evil uh upon the earth at that time god entered into jesus satan entered into judas absolutely jesus was full of the holy ghost for the holy ghost ministry as we find him acts chapter 10 verse 38 how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and with power who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for god was with him amen now it speaks now of judas the bible tells us acts 1 17 for judas he judas was numbered with us and obtained a part of this ministry listen matthew 10 1 but when he had called unto him his 12 disciples he called them gave them power against unclean spirits to cast them out to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease so you see if judas had a holy ghost ministry healing the sick casting out devils doing miracles that is why i have over and over again try to point out to you signs wonders miracles and these things perpetrated by various ones who have no message the word signs and wonders on his to attract the attention that you might listen to the word behold see it means stop listen i have something to tell you signs wonders but they have signs wonders they have no message they have nothing behind it there's nothing to point you to the one true god jesus christ the baptism in his name back to see the original sin that really happened in the garden yet not to tell you of the tracing the serpent seed of evil down through the ages to the present time and right on into the future many other things but they don't have it all they have are these things to attract you for their own purposes of which i will speak to you in a moment yes that spirit that was in judas traveled right along with the spirit that was on christ going together jacob esau crow and the dove now jesus chewed us in the same church amen hallelujah one is a pastor preaching the clearing the word judas back in the back in the behind the scenes operating moving in his own way amen when jesus went and hanged him was hanged upon the cross given his life he gave his life as a ransom for many to save souls and to bring them to to himself he commanded his spirit unto god and his spirit went to god came back and was poured out upon the apostles as the holy spirit judas he wasn't hanged on a cross but he hanged himself on a tree and there his spirit went back to satan and after pentecost that same spirit came down towards the ending of the first church age that's why paul recognized it says from among yourself among your own cells will arise false brethren amen ravening wolves they don't come to feed the sheep but they come to fleece the sheep may god have mercy in our day and in our time yes so judas went and hanged himself and i want to point out to you he hanged himself on three trees the first tree that he hanged himself on is the tree that i will call the money tree he hanged himself on the money tree he hanged himself on the tree of popularity and pride he hanged himself on the tree of knowledge of good and evil natural knowledge carnal knowledge whatever knowledge he hanged himself on that tree and you say oh but the bible tells us it's one tree that is true these three trees that i just spoke of are just signifi signifying one tree the tree of unbelief he hanged himself on the tree of unbelief and there my friends his disbelief of jesus christ as the word of god set for that hour failing to recognize his day and the message for his day absolutely now the spirit of christ came back on the day of pentecost anointed the apostles began to do mighty works good works works that would deliver people help people enlighten people cause people to love one another unite with one another walk together amen oh my but then we find that the spirit of judas went and it came back down and where did it go it went right straight for the bag of gold for that's the lust of gold that was always upon judas you remember jesus even had to pay his taxes the bible takes the time the bible god has a purpose a reason for everything and it takes the time to show you that this spirit was the one that held the money bags the collections that jesus had and when jesus wanted to pay his tax and he didn't even bother to turn to judas and ask him to pay his tax out of that money bag he already knew there wasn't there the money in there that should be used so he turned the bill he says no he says peter go to uh the sea and there will be a fish the coin you know the story will be in its mouth but the fact is the bible takes the time again to identify for judas was a thief and the devil is a thief and a robber absolutely and a liar according to the word of god but this spirit of judas always has a a burning lust and greed for gold and for money he loves money and it still loves money to this day absolutely goes about remember this that he was also healing the sick he was also having ministries he's also doing mighty works going about in the name of jesus claiming that he was also a disciple of jesus and while under the cover the disguise of being a disciple of jesus he was mainly collecting money funds oh my getting money so he can buy as many camels as he wanted as many horses beautiful horses as he wanted and comforts that he wanted and he wasn't living the life of a real servant but now he wants to be a prince of the church now he wants to be uh in such a state of luxury instead of being with an amount the people to know the sufferings and the needs of the people however here we find my friends goes about in the name of jesus the spirit of judas holding great meetings gathering together multitudes of people for profit not for genuine holy ghost prophecy for they're not really out for real holy ghost prophecy they are out for prophets that's why they are not true prophets of the living god may god speak to your heart and soul today they have these great big meetings for what love averages the more people you get into the meetings it's the more money they're going to get so they have bigger meetings so they can have bigger money and collect all the more money and big buildings big churches big education and big everything everything with a material concept back of it everything with the thoughts of profit all behind the scenes amen and that watch that spirit that is upon them talk about denying themselves no they won't do that oh absolutely not they would say go god called me to what deny myself i can't deny myself now no they come so soft amen they got to have everything cushy and cushiony they got to have uh some kind of they're not going to travel in a ship or a boat and be shipwrecked like paul they're not going to ride some donkey or a horse no they got to have something better than that they gotta have the modern day best technology of this that the other oh my i tell your friends we see it clear plane don't you be fooled watch the spirit that is upon them my friends judas went about just as if he was one of the twelve he did miracles too but he did not have the spirit of god upon him whatsoever he never went up to pentecost he hanged himself before he could get to the upper room but yet he's gonna claim amen that he is one of them oh my think of it liars lies and liars will always hang their own cells oh absolutely that spirit was on judah that was on judas has returned that is now back here in our age that spirit of religious deceit religious lies and falsehood but they are saturated and consumed with a love of money while hiding under the disguise of modern day christianity and of in general religion they're hiding behind these cloaks of religion rather than walking in the light as he was in the light had no home in which to put his head not to say you are to live that way but modestly humbly sincerely simply but now these want to be high and lifted up recognized to be seen to be known everything else you don't want to live the hidden life they don't want to go behind the veil where the glory never fails oh hallelujah to the lamb oh my god this has gone from the people no king riding on an ass but now he wants to ride on an armored car on the most expensive uh vehicle you can find while whether flying or driving god have mercy oh friends think of it clearly he devil satan never judas never went to pentecost for he was not a true seed he was not a true child of god no sir whoa but yet he cast out devils yet he was healing the sick you say how could that be how could a man have a a holy ghost ministry and still be a devil all my friends we want we won't talk about that or uh on that but we'll just give you the scripture to fertilize your thought gifts and callings are without repentance in other words that god places the gifts within the individuals amen before they repent before their conscience are aware of anything so having gifts manifesting through that life you got to go right back into the realm of the soul and see what's nature what's influencing that back there and recognize the original seed from the presence of almighty god yes the devil may fully elect some of the time but as one great man said you can fool some of the people some of the time but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time you may the devil may fool some of the elect distract them delude them for a season of time yes but he cannot fool all of god's people all of the time for they are they're going to come back to that original word which their spirit all already recognized and seen oh praise god don't be fooled and you won't be fooled but jesus said the elect will not be deceived they will not be fooled amen yes many of those christians so called claim they're christians match their lives match their walk match their talk match their doctrine their dogmas and so on with the word of god some of them will literally hinder you from reading the word and say oh you don't need to read the word of god the minister reads the word of god so why do you have to read it no every christian reads their bible and prays every day individually for themselves so they can see even what i am saying they can compare and see whether it is true amen and you are obligated to do that by the word of god amen listen to the word of god i will make them come and worship before thy feet and to know that i have loved thee corinthians 6 2 do you not know that this saints shall judge the earth oh i'd love to speak on that some people says oh don't judge don't judge they don't know what they're talking they're thinking carnally the judgment of carnality but not the judgment by the word of god for the bible tells you the saints shall judge the earth listen closely here in the word of god amen not only will the saints judge the earth but the ark will be judged the bible tells us the judgment was set and there was 24 elders amen the great throne god sitting there like a king with his counselors around them 24 elders my 24 elders wow what is that 12 apostles prophets 12 represent the 12 representing israel old testament 12 apostles new testament representing the gentile dispensation and all 24 of them bowed down cast down their crowns and gave glory unto him who sat upon the throne oh praise god forevermore and these saints shall judge the earth the bible says oh glory to god amen that is when those who claim to belong to god and claim that god loves them and when anyone says that it's hard for you to say no it's not so you just leave it alone let god come to the end and he will be able to make it all known and we'll know who is a child of god and who is not a child of god who is truly loved of god and who is hated by the spirit of god oh payday is coming yes that day is coming my friends when all will things things will be made manifested hallelujah these many of these now are now ruling the world but only to a certain measure but during this last age they will absolutely rule the world by building an image unto the beast listen to me my friends they will build an image onto the beast to rule the entire world and there and they will actually rule this world religion christianity will actually rule this world one day because one day a christian combine of churches will rule the world a super organization that they will build a super image and will one day the bible says they will do it but just as god humbled them in the day of luther god will humble her again according to revelation 18 where mystery babylon mother of harlots will be judged and burnt with fire from the presence of almighty god in one hour shall be consumed at the merchants of the earth and all these will weep and howl oh my for all natural their natural wealth and things will have be departed destroyed she will be destroyed as the tower of babel was destroyed so the bible tells us god will humble her humble her humbled by the burning of babylon and she will also be humbled by the coming and the exposure of our lives by the very coming of the truth himself the bible tells us in revelation 19 11-16 how the heavens will open and out of the heavens will come a mighty king riding upon a white horse amen and with him are the armies of heaven clothed in linen clean and white and upon his tie written amen as the word of god king of kings and lord of lords and the armies following him is his wife the bride of christ cleansed by the blood of christ now clothed in green and clean and white here they come riding in upon the power of the word of god to bring judgment justice and truth amen praise god forevermore friends i tell you i i want to close on this note here today oh when the saints go come riding in oh when the saints come riding in oh lord i want to be in that number oh when the saints come riding in i want to ride by his side on this word of god the revelation of the word and drive every wicked thing out of existence for his glory and for his honor god bless you my friends and to him we praise honor and glory for ever and ever amen [Music] do [Music] you
