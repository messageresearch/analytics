[1:16] [Music]
[1:52] some people would say all people
[1:56] Christians they're always talking about
[1:58] deeper you know what happened that
[2:01] someone is all about States it's about
[2:04] recognizing what God is doing we got us
[2:08] planned for sons and daughters and time
[2:12] that are here in this earth I mentioned
[2:15] you know I mean you go to the movies
[2:18] these days you see these movies coming
[2:20] up they're always like you know
[2:22] interdimensional now they're showing all
[2:24] kinds of you know they've taken it to
[2:27] the ridiculous levels you know in horror
[2:30] movies and everything else and they you
[2:33] know they're breaking into all these
[2:34] interdimensional things not realizing
[2:38] that that's you know that there is a
[2:40] reality to that and you know there's
[2:45] there's the worlds of dimensions where
[2:48] there is evil there's no question about
[2:50] it right it actually falls right in this
[2:53] dimension here right here we've got all
[2:56] good
[2:56] right but it's understanding that
[2:59] there's a plan that God had from before
[3:01] the foundations of the world that he
[3:05] planned to redeem sons and daughters
[3:10] children of God and that this is not
[3:12] everything this is not all that we see
[3:16] this is only the drop actually in the
[3:19] whole plan of God praise God bullets
[3:24] Wednesday night and Wednesday night is
[3:26] Bible study gives us an opportunity to
[3:30] look into the areas of the word when we
[3:34] can study in to meditate on it we can
[3:40] fellowship around it you know God loves
[3:44] for us to come and fellowship with him
[3:47] that's what this is churches about
[3:49] fellowship it's about meeting with God
[3:52] amen it started way back in the
[3:55] Dartmouth II wouldn't happen II would
[3:57] have fellowship in the cool of the
[4:00] evening they would get together with the
[4:02] Lord and they would have divine
[4:04] fellowship amen praise God and that's
[4:07] what we're being restored back to so we
[4:10] just want to continue along the lines
[4:12] that we've been ministering on the
[4:14] rapture we Bible I believe that there's
[4:16] a there's a revival that's taking place
[4:18] right now mister and there's there was
[4:22] revivals in every season you know God
[4:25] would stir up an individual will bring
[4:28] forth revelation and that individual
[4:32] would
[4:33] like it'll have an effect on other
[4:36] people because that's God's Way right
[4:38] faith cometh by hearing so he uses the
[4:41] preaching of the word of God to bring
[4:44] forth faith and you know it's always
[4:47] revival his work and God would come and
[4:49] he would use an individual to break a
[4:52] certain pattern or complacency here you
[4:56] know they would take the word and they
[4:58] would try to organize the wording and
[5:00] say well God is with us and God is only
[5:04] with us and you have to do it the way
[5:07] that we say it and then it would put his
[5:10] interpretation of the Word of God and
[5:12] then God would just say foolish and gets
[5:16] his own ideas that starts thinking his
[5:19] own ways and so God has to move on and
[5:22] he stirs another reminder amen
[5:25] and so here we are in the last case
[5:27] we're in the time of the season of the
[5:30] rapture of the church we're going to
[5:32] leave this place but before we do that
[5:35] we're going to need a certain kind of
[5:36] faith in order to translate these bodies
[5:40] amen and so there's a revival now and
[5:43] the land I plead with all my heart that
[5:45] God wants to get his children in place
[5:49] positionally so that they can see their
[5:52] place in the word and when you see your
[5:54] heart in the Word of God that's going to
[5:57] give you such faith to operate in it and
[6:00] then God's gonna love that word because
[6:03] that's what he does he and that's how
[6:05] you know he brings his word about
[6:08] that's how he brings his word vygotsky's
[6:10] his old interpreter does not need men to
[6:14] interpret his work God uses men to
[6:18] interpret his work he God gets inside of
[6:22] that God that transforms man he
[6:26] transforms their lives their ways their
[6:29] thinking their traditions he gets them
[6:32] out of there out of the world traditions
[6:36] and teachings and and he he shows
[6:38] himself he indicates his own word he
[6:42] brings his word to us even hey so we're
[6:45] in the rapture of the Bible because
[6:46] God's going to take the church we're
[6:48] gonna read from the book of Ephesians
[6:50] chapter 4 verse 11 to 16 I'm gonna read
[7:01] it from the amplified version praise God
[7:09] let's pray father we just want to thank
[7:14] you for this opportunity to learn more
[7:16] because we know that it's an opportunity
[7:19] to meet with you in heavenly places Lord
[7:23] where our position is waiting and Lord
[7:28] when we get into that place magic begins
[7:32] to happen in the Bride of Christ the
[7:34] body of Christ miracles start to take
[7:37] place nor the sparks start to move from
[7:41] the park to the park Lords it's just
[7:43] your way of fellowshipping it and a
[7:46] meeting with your children or especially
[7:50] an entire like this order of the world
[7:51] is so caught up in so many different
[7:54] teachings and New Age movements and
[7:57] interpretations of God and the universe
[8:01] and how things are supposed to be in
[8:03] here we are born we can assemble Lourdes
[8:06] as simple people but your presence would
[8:09] come and just take control of this word
[8:12] and anoint it so that we can speak it
[8:15] and so that we can understand it granted
[8:18] tonight father Lord remember our pastor
[8:20] as he prepares for a trip to New Mexico
[8:26] where he will go administer the Word of
[8:28] God over these next four or five days
[8:30] and Lord just anointed especially Lord
[8:36] let your your purpose in your plan be
[8:39] established through this trip and let
[8:42] the people receive what they need to
[8:44] receive and or just use them in a
[8:46] supernatural way to be commitment to
[8:48] your heads place your angels around them
[8:51] in captain with your presence of God
[8:53] inspire the supernatural in Jesus name
[9:01] our pastor over these next four days
[9:06] could be leaving tomorrow for New Mexico
[9:08] he's a big ministry with the scenes down
[9:11] there praise God
[9:14] Ephesians chapter 4 verse 11 and his
[9:18] gifts were varied himself appointed and
[9:22] gave men to us some to be apostles
[9:29] special messengers
[9:34] [Music]
[9:36] some prophets inspired preachers and
[9:40] expounder some evangelists preachers of
[9:43] the gospel traveling missionaries some
[9:47] pastors shepherds of his flock and
[9:50] teachers his intention was the
[9:53] perfecting and the full equipping of the
[9:57] six has come
[10:00] and they should do the work of ministry
[10:05] towards building up Christ's body the
[10:09] church that it might develop until we
[10:14] all attain oneness in the faith and in
[10:17] the comprehension of the folk and
[10:20] accurate knowledge of the Son of God
[10:23] that we may arrive at really mature
[10:28] manhood the completeness of personality
[10:32] which is nothing less than the standard
[10:35] height of Christ's own perfection the
[10:41] measure of the stature of the fullness
[10:43] of Christ and the completeness found in
[10:48] him
[10:50] this is going to take us into her
[10:53] subject in verse 14 so that we may no
[10:57] longer be children tossed like ships to
[11:00] and fro between chats
[11:03] gusts of teaching and wavering with
[11:06] every changing wind of doctrine the prey
[11:10] of the cunning and cleverness of a
[11:14] scrupulous man gamblers engaged in every
[11:18] shifting form of Turkey in inventing
[11:23] errors to mislead rather let our lives
[11:27] lovingly Express truth in all things
[11:31] speaking truly dealing truly living
[11:36] truly and folded in luck let us grow up
[11:42] in every way and in all things up to him
[11:46] who is the head even Christ the Messiah
[11:50] The Anointed One for because of
[11:53] mechanical
[11:54] all on the church in all its various
[11:58] parts closely joined and firmly meant
[12:02] together by the joints and ligaments
[12:06] with which it is supplied when each part
[12:12] with power adapted to its need is
[12:18] working properly in all its functions
[12:22] rules to full maturity building itself
[12:27] up in love praise God the Lord that is
[12:33] bestest the work may be seated
[12:35] our topic tonight what we're going to be
[12:38] looking at is building the body of the
[12:41] love you know this body that you know
[12:47] all we need to do is to go back into the
[12:49] mind of God you know to recognize and to
[12:53] realize that there was a desire being
[12:56] God to express himself so that he could
[13:01] have published now the reason why you
[13:05] know like we can't explain God we can't
[13:09] say this is why know we can only
[13:15] fellowship around the Word of God and
[13:18] come together in in ministry and then it
[13:23] allows him to come in and minister and
[13:26] show us and express his thoughts and my
[13:30] revelation give us some understanding of
[13:33] what it is that he was
[13:34] and why he's doing it believe that
[13:39] because you know if your son or daughter
[13:41] of God you have to have experienced the
[13:43] love of God you know the first thing
[13:47] that I can recall but God intervened you
[13:52] know was that he allowed me to to
[13:57] experience his love and it surpassed
[14:02] every emotional desire or experience or
[14:09] hi because you know I was like you know
[14:16] I was I was in a drug situation where
[14:19] you know when you're doing drugs is
[14:22] because you're trying to an expiry
[14:24] you're trying to experience a euphoria
[14:26] you try to you know get out of whether
[14:29] it's drugs drinking whatever it is
[14:32] you're trying to get out of a certain
[14:35] mental condition to enter into some sort
[14:38] of it at the euphoria that allows you to
[14:41] just experience something beyond
[14:44] anything you know and so you know when
[14:48] God gives you an experience of his love
[14:53] it pulls everything else out of the
[15:01] water that could even come close because
[15:06] you hear on this earth that you're
[15:08] trying to you know you're trying to
[15:10] achieve something you're trying to like
[15:12] find out this ultimate happiness this
[15:16] ultimate you know purpose of being on
[15:20] this earth and and then when God touched
[15:23] you you know all I can remember is that
[15:26] it just didn't compare with anything
[15:29] so it must be that God wanted to express
[15:33] this and a fellowship you know like that
[15:41] euphoria that I could just imagine what
[15:44] Adam and Eve must have experienced when
[15:48] God would come down and fellowship with
[15:51] them we just get a little dew drop every
[15:55] now then you know you get cottages
[15:57] presents whether you're in prayer
[15:58] whether you're in worship and you know
[16:01] you'reyou're you're in the you're in the
[16:03] service and the word is just coming in
[16:05] such a way that you're like you're just
[16:07] feeling this ain't that amazing euphoria
[16:11] of being totally set free that there's
[16:14] nothing to hold you reality and so God
[16:23] was expressing this desire and he wanted
[16:27] to express it so the only way that he
[16:29] could you know express it and have it
[16:32] like expressed back to him was to have a
[16:40] family you know there's nothing that
[16:44] listen you you know as it as individuals
[16:47] right you know like a child when it's a
[16:50] child it only knows the love of the
[16:52] parent it cannot express and Kent it you
[16:57] know quite you know say oh I love her so
[17:00] much on your nose when you look at that
[17:03] child that child looks into the mother's
[17:05] eyes that feeds it and loves it and
[17:10] takes care of that child is focused
[17:12] you're trying to take that child away
[17:13] from that mother and that child was
[17:16] screaming for dear life because it has
[17:20] experienced something that
[17:23] explain it just like we can't really
[17:26] explain it but we know that without
[17:28] God's love in our lives we would not be
[17:33] able to even be here tonight as a church
[17:38] you know like a true church because
[17:41] listen if you're talking to church to
[17:42] just come and you know join and be seen
[17:46] and sing that you belong to a church
[17:49] because we heard there's going to be you
[17:51] know tribulation on the earth and so you
[17:54] want to try to escape that you're really
[17:57] go then 98% of the churches that are out
[18:00] there but if you have experienced God in
[18:04] the power of his resurrection you have
[18:07] experienced his love that goes beyond
[18:10] human you can't explain it
[18:13] there's there's no way you can explain
[18:15] it it's just because you just live with
[18:19] it's in your right hand you cannot live
[18:22] without it without God's presence in my
[18:31] life even a minute how can you if you're
[18:35] a son a daughter of God it's because
[18:37] he's in you yes and you know like what
[18:40] ends up happening you know over time you
[18:42] know like here I am I'm 20
[18:45] 25th year of my awareness as a son of
[18:49] doctor I was always a Seneca you were
[18:52] all these sons and daughters of company
[18:53] but you come into an awareness at some
[18:56] point your life and you realize that it
[19:01] wasn't some you know experience you know
[19:07] because I went to a lot of seminars
[19:09] legal seminar so exciting and so popular
[19:13] health and everything else and then the
[19:15] following week I'd be down at the dosa
[19:19] get people because it was temporary this
[19:24] is not temporary what we have
[19:27] experienced is not temporary God has has
[19:32] has placed in us a portion of himself
[19:35] feed and the deep called to the deep
[19:39] there's a constant fellowship in the
[19:42] body of Christ and so tonight we're
[19:46] looking at the how the body is being
[19:49] built in love because we just read here
[19:51] where it said right in the last you know
[19:54] couple of lines here
[19:56] he said when each part when power
[20:00] adapted to its need is working properly
[20:04] in all its functions grows to full
[20:08] maturity building itself up in love so
[20:13] we're being built up in love with the
[20:15] King James Version and sensing that
[20:18] tongue that which every joint supplieth
[20:21] according to the effectual working in
[20:23] the past
[20:25] of every part maketh increase of the
[20:29] body unto the edifying of itself in love
[20:34] so there's there's something that
[20:36] there's a power in the Word of God when
[20:41] it comes to sons and daughters of God
[20:43] getting into their positions and they
[20:47] have entered into the revelation of
[20:49] God's love God's purpose God's desire
[20:54] you see you can't operate in your
[20:56] position as a son or daughter of God and
[21:00] be doing it by intellectual
[21:02] understanding you know we looked at all
[21:06] the different gifts that are within the
[21:08] body and all those gifts are in you but
[21:11] but you need to recognize that the gift
[21:13] that's been placed in there operates by
[21:17] the Holy Ghost it operates by the Spirit
[21:21] of God and the Spirit of God operates by
[21:24] divine love there's a divine love that
[21:29] operates that gift that activates it
[21:32] when we come to understand how God
[21:36] desires to eat in the church so I'm
[21:43] going to be the food here because you
[21:46] know this whole kind of caught my
[21:48] attention to us like when I was reading
[21:50] it and it'll just kind of you know come
[21:54] together here as we as we study because
[21:56] it's a Bible study right and so you know
[21:59] now he said he made known to us the
[22:02] mystery this is brother brother speaking
[22:06] here this isn't a book of adoption book
[22:08] number four he says now he said he made
[22:12] known to us the mystery he says get the
[22:16] Holy Spirit on you sometime and start
[22:20] running that and just watch how it goes
[22:23] that he's talking about you know where
[22:26] you get into a Bible study or into
[22:31] prayer or into feet
[22:33] word of god right because that's this is
[22:36] what this is we need to realize we're
[22:39] just not here tonight to just join
[22:42] together and Shore selves and you know
[22:45] show up I was there you must have a
[22:48] purpose in being here tonight I hope
[22:50] that you will leave here tonight with
[22:52] something that's going to strengthen you
[22:55] and give you power out there in victory
[23:01] and to have a victorious life amen
[23:03] because your sons and daughters of God
[23:06] we should not live under privilege not
[23:09] lets us to separate ourselves so that he
[23:11] can speak to us and give us what we have
[23:14] be the payment and so here he says you
[23:17] start running that he says just get the
[23:19] Holy Spirit on you sadly the only
[23:21] spirits here thready
[23:22] and he's all over us if he wants to
[23:24] express something else and he says now
[23:27] he says this afternoon I have a little
[23:30] 30 minutes to study just to look over
[23:33] the lesson maybe novices I'll say that
[23:35] half of that maybe 15 minutes between
[23:37] the times and I got to running and I
[23:40] thought the mystery how mysterious and
[23:44] the scripture packed me back into the
[23:47] Old Testament and then back over into
[23:50] the New Testament times something
[23:52] together see the mystery of his coming
[23:55] the mystery of his will the mystery of
[23:59] us sitting together remember it cannot
[24:05] be taught in any seminary it's a mystery
[24:08] this whole plan of God remember this is
[24:13] not something that that can be talked to
[24:16] you this is something you must
[24:18] experience personally by revelation
[24:22] yourself and he says the most
[24:25] of this will the mystery of prostrating
[24:28] together remember it cannot be taught in
[24:30] a seminary it's a mystery
[24:32] you cannot know it by education by
[24:35] theology
[24:36] it's a mystery that's been hidden since
[24:39] the foundation of the world waiting for
[24:42] the manifestation of the sons and so
[24:48] remember he started by saying that God
[24:50] had this plan in the back of his mind
[24:52] that he was going to have fellowship in
[24:55] order to do that he would need to
[24:57] manifest sons and daughters ago because
[25:01] in God was male it be them so all he did
[25:06] was he separated and they wanted to be
[25:09] an earthly expression of himself when he
[25:15] made he created the bottom Adam and took
[25:21] from that body and created Eve but
[25:23] remember they too were what they were
[25:26] one and they were having perfect
[25:28] fellowship in the dark to be it for the
[25:31] perfect target out of I imagine when
[25:34] Adam looked at Eve for the first time he
[25:38] didn't feel he understood but then it
[25:42] was expressed and he saw this
[25:50] beautifully in love with this woman and
[26:03] there was like this this supernatural
[26:06] divine love that they experienced and
[26:10] they would come
[26:12] well that just capped it off it was it
[26:18] was just amazing
[26:20] but God was gonna use out of a need to
[26:25] breathe forth sons and daughters of God
[26:27] because he had given them the big get
[26:30] over the earth and he said no bullet
[26:32] multiply when he said that he had a
[26:35] thought in his mind it was this
[26:38] expression of you know how you
[26:42] fellowship and having more children and
[26:46] that they would be able to come forth
[26:48] just the way that God said let us make
[26:53] man in our image this was all expression
[26:57] so there was a there was a planet there
[27:01] there was a planet of manifestations of
[27:04] the sons and daughters of God God wanted
[27:08] to manifest sons and daughters well this
[27:11] is where we're at now so this is brother
[27:16] Brandi says he says he goes on he says
[27:18] tell me my brother tell me my sister
[27:22] what was the time that the sons of God
[27:24] was ever to be manifested out silent
[27:29] this time now he says when were there
[27:34] wasn't were there ever a time in history
[27:38] that was to manifest the time to deliver
[27:44] all nature nature the nature itself is
[27:47] brutal waiting for the time of the
[27:51] manifestation or in that time women this
[27:56] all has to call me at some point were
[28:00] the sons and daughters of God
[28:02] fully manifest on the earth and what we
[28:05] do will build interaction and there was
[28:11] gonna be coming back after three and a
[28:12] half years to rule and reign on this
[28:16] earth we need to get to the rapture
[28:18] first indeed we need to get out of here
[28:20] for our first and so at that point we
[28:25] need to see where we're at so that we
[28:28] can recognize the season that were
[28:31] living in and nobody is that is expected
[28:34] of us as sons of God and so here brother
[28:38] Graham continues to say why he says why
[28:41] before the involvement was made before
[28:43] the Holy Ghost was ever poured up before
[28:47] all the old testament or down there
[28:50] there couldn't have been manifestations
[28:53] it had to wait until mr. diamond it had
[28:58] to come to this age where he would make
[29:03] build his planet position sons and
[29:07] daughters and let the little that you're
[29:09] coming down into full maturity you're
[29:12] coming into the maturity that you need
[29:15] to come in to in order for you to be
[29:17] translated out of this adventure because
[29:21] that dimensional change is only going to
[29:23] be a revelation that's all that that's
[29:26] going to be it's not like hair like you
[29:31] know you're gonna put on this armor and
[29:33] you know we are putting on our but it's
[29:36] the Word of God it's not something
[29:38] visible it's good to be a revelation and
[29:41] the revelation just continues to
[29:43] progress and so listen Harry says it
[29:46] happened to wait till this time now all
[29:49] things has been brought coming shaping
[29:53] up to a headstone to the manifestations
[29:56] of sons of God coming back and the
[30:00] Spirit of God
[30:02] to these men so perfectly until their
[30:07] ministry would be so close like Christ's
[30:10] to the will join him and this church
[30:13] again now all things has been brought
[30:26] howdy
[30:28] shape it up to a headstone to the
[30:32] manifestations of sons of God coming
[30:36] back and the Spirit of God coming into
[30:39] these men so perfectly until their
[30:43] ministry will be so close like Christ
[30:47] will join him and his church together is
[31:01] that not what God is doing in this out
[31:05] that he's drawing us together giving us
[31:11] to operate in our positions BC God set
[31:21] up a perfect dark in the beginning he
[31:26] put in a perfect atmosphere so that he
[31:29] could have a perfect fellowship yes the
[31:33] one thing that he said was do not eat of
[31:36] that tree of knowledge of good and evil
[31:41] that was the only thing that he placed
[31:44] there because it's all part of the plan
[31:48] you see but he had the places here on
[31:50] free moral agency and you're still on
[31:52] three mornings
[31:54] every one of us we are not robots we are
[31:57] not clothes you're not you know being
[32:01] you know shaped like you every world is
[32:03] exactly the same dress it's exactly the
[32:05] same way it's to an exact you know form
[32:11] of everything else no you are daughters
[32:13] of God and by revelation you serve God
[32:18] by revelation you dress right by
[32:21] revelation you live right by revelation
[32:25] you turn up your children but a
[32:27] revelation it's that's what pleases God
[32:30] and that's what God is looking for he's
[32:34] giving us free world agency to choose
[32:37] between light and darkness he's given us
[32:45] that free porn agency to be sons and
[32:49] daughters of God free liberated three
[32:53] sons and daughters of God not under any
[32:57] kind of law by new personality or spirit
[33:05] or anything like that who just wants you
[33:07] to be who you are that's all we want to
[33:12] be but you see when the Pope took place
[33:17] there was a separation that took place
[33:21] let me be deployed here brother Brent
[33:24] says now fellowship sorry he says now
[33:32] when God made man in the beginning to
[33:34] fellowship with him then this man was in
[33:37] perfect fellowship in the dark
[33:40] he was a perfect fellowship with God and
[33:44] how it must have been on that day when
[33:47] God would come down in the full of the
[33:49] team
[33:50] caught he and Eve would come up
[33:55] God didn't go down as it had a need he
[34:00] would go down there he would he would
[34:02] just happen and I haven't even would
[34:06] just immediately recognize his voice
[34:10] feel his presence love that was fear and
[34:14] would just enjoy and they would worship
[34:18] them they would fellowship and commune
[34:20] with the other
[34:22] maybe that's the very thing that calls
[34:24] us together like this setting together
[34:28] in heavenly places and I think you know
[34:30] both should be in the holy spirit no
[34:34] difference in us we are all one in
[34:37] Christ Jesus
[34:38] in that perfect harmony of fellowship
[34:41] there's nothing like it I've ever found
[34:44] on earth is to come together in heavenly
[34:48] places and have communion fellowship
[34:52] with God and with each other now that's
[34:56] what God intended in the dark meaning
[34:58] then that fellowship from God and man
[35:02] was broken I said by unbelief God made a
[35:08] basis and a ground upon which men could
[35:11] remain or retain his notion and it
[35:15] wasn't through a get-together or
[35:19] organizations or education it was on the
[35:25] basis of the shed blood in other words
[35:28] the Holy Ghost that's what gives us
[35:30] propulsion and that's the only place of
[35:33] fellowship that we have with God
[35:35] and the only meeting places through the
[35:38] blood Jesus Christ that's exactly right
[35:40] see and so that's why when we talk about
[35:45] recognizing your day in its message
[35:47] we're talking about Holy Ghost that
[35:52] experience and that oneness that comes
[35:56] with Christ in you your real true
[36:02] relationship but you see that break
[36:10] about shift takes place when singing
[36:13] deceives us when singing temporarily
[36:18] deceives us because you can never
[36:19] permanently deceive a son or daughter
[36:22] god I just can't happen and you can
[36:26] temporarily be in a condition in
[36:31] contemporary allow yourself to separate
[36:37] from the fellowship of the body of
[36:39] Christ and how does that happen when you
[36:42] get to worldly when you get away from
[36:48] church you know you want assemble like
[36:51] you used to
[36:53] you think it's okay to just come on
[36:56] capitis on Sunday or three times a year
[37:02] or whatever I'm exaggerating a little
[37:05] bit but that's that's I think that's
[37:07] what happens when there isn't a real
[37:10] experience well there's a real
[37:13] experience you can't wait to get into
[37:16] his process that's what we do
[37:18] they're not to assemble yourselves even
[37:22] more so as they approach one day these
[37:28] people this the day of the rapture the
[37:33] season of the rapture because that's
[37:35] what you're receiving when you have
[37:38] eaten this looks like a simple Bible
[37:40] study here tonight you know 50 40 50
[37:44] people join together but there's a lot
[37:46] more happening in this room in sons and
[37:50] daughters who don't recognize that that
[37:52] this is a supernatural meaning this is
[37:54] coming together in heavenly places
[37:56] why don't you see what ends up happening
[37:57] sometimes is we spend too much time in
[38:00] the things of this life you get
[38:03] distracted so much that we start to
[38:07] follow away and lose that that that
[38:10] divine love experience with God that
[38:14] first love you know it'll go back to
[38:18] your first love
[38:19] we've heard that set for and over again
[38:22] but it's the truth and how you do that
[38:24] you get into the word amen you
[38:27] fellowship around the word you assemble
[38:30] yourselves whatever it is there's a
[38:32] service you have a prayer life you have
[38:36] your own personal prayer life you know
[38:39] it's not like you know like where you
[38:42] vote for hours it will closet and you
[38:45] pray and this and that I don't know
[38:48] about you but I'm free and all people I
[38:51] find myself pray tell should be with the
[38:54] Lord all day long say Lord you know this
[38:57] situation here thank you for taking care
[39:00] of that and praise God I forgot all
[39:02] about that lord thank you for bringing
[39:06] that's furthest posted with a man that's
[39:12] what prayer is so soul so yeah there's
[39:15] times where we don't we have prayer
[39:17] meetings there's times when you you do
[39:19] sit with your with your family and
[39:21] prayer with your wife you know that's
[39:24] powerful you need to have that too
[39:26] that's all good but there's a
[39:29] relationship that must be constant and
[39:32] if you're a son of body you've
[39:34] experienced that love you want that
[39:37] constant potion but Satan distracts us
[39:42] he steals our time other you know Adam
[39:48] had a perfect environment that a perfect
[39:50] fellowship with God and singing
[39:52] hated that and found a way to break that
[39:55] the bottom function and city will fight
[39:59] you he paints it when you get into
[40:02] fellowship he hates it when you start to
[40:06] you know recognize who you are that
[40:09] you've been given a position in the body
[40:11] of Christ and then you know if you start
[40:14] to take your position in the church in
[40:16] the body you start to move into your
[40:19] office those people that are moving into
[40:21] certain positions it's just happening
[40:23] it's just naturally taking place and
[40:26] it's wonderful to see that because it's
[40:29] actually them recognizing that they have
[40:32] a part in the bottom and that by
[40:35] activating that part in the body and
[40:37] doing it nothing
[40:39] they have to do it now because they want
[40:42] to be seen not because of you know
[40:45] they're trying to get points with the
[40:48] Baxter or the you know the difference
[40:54] when somebody is in their position and
[40:57] they're doing it because they want to
[40:59] see them the body and the church in the
[41:02] ministry move forward and progress want
[41:09] to see the body
[41:10] strengthen them again and it encouraged
[41:13] it's important for these things to take
[41:15] place but safe what he does is he you
[41:19] know take certain individuals you let
[41:21] knowing them have certain attitudes and
[41:24] to try you know surely like oh you know
[41:27] I need to do that I don't have to do
[41:29] that listen I don't know what you have
[41:32] to do or what you don't have to do even
[41:38] but if you come to that fellowship the
[41:40] God
[41:41] and you get to a place where you pray
[41:44] and you see God and you know this love
[41:46] fill you so much you get into your
[41:50] position you just gravitate to your
[41:54] position because of the normal volume
[41:57] and anointing will be on you you will
[42:01] feel the joy of another sister because
[42:19] please please
[42:23] that you were operating in he's pleased
[42:27] to see that do not do it any other
[42:30] reason but because you've entered into a
[42:32] love affair it's a real experience this
[42:39] is what he wants us the Hospice's
[42:42] because we just read it here in the book
[42:44] of Ephesians an increase of the body
[42:47] unto the edifying of itself because
[42:55] you're in love you're in love with the
[43:00] body of Christ you are purpose listen
[43:03] when we get out of here and we because I
[43:07] hope you may have experienced it you
[43:10] have not experienced it yet but let me
[43:11] tell you what did you do experience that
[43:14] presence of God so much on you you will
[43:18] look at your brothers and sisters and
[43:21] and you will see them like brother
[43:24] brother said nothing but perfect love I
[43:28] cannot explain this you have to
[43:31] experience it
[43:32] brother brother led to the other side
[43:34] and he came back and said nothing a
[43:37] perfect love can enter into that place
[43:40] he experienced that and he said brother
[43:45] sister nothing but perfect love is
[43:48] really get in there he not he came back
[43:52] and he expressed that because he
[43:53] experienced it or did he really did he
[43:56] know only now who had come into this
[44:00] now at the other time were the sons and
[44:02] daughters of Doc would have been effects
[44:04] where we were going to actually
[44:06] experience this Val conduct and another
[44:08] level in a level where it would actually
[44:11] be the process by which we get in the
[44:14] process by which we actually start to
[44:17] with jour in our offices and in our
[44:20] positions in a greater way you know we
[44:25] talk about it we talk about it but do we
[44:28] experience it and this is the thing that
[44:31] you know that that this is the thought
[44:34] this is what came out of the Scriptures
[44:36] while I was studying that I was looking
[44:38] at because there's so much to
[44:41] positioning in the body there's so much
[44:44] that we need to get it brother Bret said
[44:46] that Lyndon you know that sometime one
[44:48] day he says there's going to be such an
[44:50] important thing that's gonna sweep over
[44:52] this product I love the money team
[44:56] that's going to sweep her right out of
[44:57] this image I know that's what it's going
[45:00] to be if you've experienced just a taste
[45:05] of that that you just had you know for
[45:07] sure they can do it and it will do it
[45:11] because that's God's provided way you
[45:16] know I can't fully explain things by
[45:20] revelation but I can't put words to them
[45:23] but all I can tell you is that I know
[45:25] that there's going to be a supernatural
[45:28] love experience that's going to come
[45:30] upon this body and we're going to enter
[45:33] into it God's given us a foretaste
[45:35] doesn't give us a preamble to it saying
[45:39] get ready something is coming there's
[45:42] going to be a sweet that's good that's
[45:44] good
[45:44] place
[45:45] son of God that is going to be something
[45:48] that's gonna take ahold of your life
[45:50] it's going to change your priorities
[45:55] we're not karate but this is God's plan
[46:00] this is the Church of God this is about
[46:03] God having fellowship with his children
[46:06] but city hates it he hates it and he
[46:11] wants to break that fellowship he wants
[46:13] to bring that fellowship that you have
[46:15] seek would watch Anthony go to church
[46:18] everybody to the pool of the evening and
[46:21] he was just sitting there thinking how
[46:25] can I break this motion and don't you
[46:28] think we love it that that same enemy is
[46:31] not looking to hear might be in your
[46:34] situation is in looking for ways to
[46:35] break that but that's why we pray that's
[46:41] why we see the word strengthened I just
[47:03] got more energy to overcome times you
[47:08] know you have such a wonderful service
[47:11] on Sunday you wonder what run that you
[47:13] get blasted from every side and you're
[47:16] wondering why goodness lord help me at
[47:21] this time what is it because you were so
[47:23] blessed and because we were so
[47:25] enlightened and Satan he's trying to
[47:29] prove to God that he can take you down
