[0:00] [Music]
[0:13] thanks be unto
[0:15] god for his marvelous gift
[0:19] of eternal life with joy become
[0:23] to draw water from the well of salvation
[0:28] may the lord jesus christ bless us
[0:31] tonight
[0:32] in a wonderful way as we
[0:36] delve into the seven
[0:39] church ages our particular study
[0:43] for tonight will be
[0:46] the rise of the false church
[0:50] i repeat the rise
[0:53] of the false church and
[0:57] our scripture is found in
[1:01] revelation chapter 2
[1:04] reading from verse 14
[1:08] to 15. together
[1:13] but i have a few things
[1:17] against thee because thou
[1:20] has there them
[1:23] that hold the doctrine
[1:26] of balaam who taught
[1:30] balak to cast a stumbling block
[1:35] before the children of israel
[1:38] to eat things sacrificed
[1:42] onto idols and
[1:45] to commit fornication
[1:49] so hast thou also them
[1:53] that hold the doctrine
[1:56] of the necrolytans
[1:59] which thing i hate
[2:04] let us pray a gracious
[2:07] god our heavenly father once again
[2:11] with the honor and privilege
[2:14] we come with boldness
[2:17] into the presence of
[2:21] god with the
[2:24] blood of jesus christ the righteousness
[2:28] of jesus christ
[2:30] the joy of jesus christ
[2:33] and the humility given unto us by the
[2:36] holy
[2:36] spirit that we may surrender ourselves
[2:41] for the hearing of the word receiving it
[2:46] with hearts that want to obey
[2:50] the word and live for and by the word
[2:54] to thee be all the praise the honor and
[2:57] the glory
[2:58] as we uh humiliate and humble ourselves
[3:02] father
[3:03] we lift you up and glorify your great
[3:07] and mighty name
[3:08] in jesus name we ask it amen
[3:12] and amen
[3:16] the rise of the false church
[3:22] now in this fergamus church age
[3:27] the lord has specifically taken the time
[3:31] to denounce two particular
[3:35] doctrines because those are the two
[3:40] things that he said i am against
[3:44] two things in
[3:48] the age of pergamos that god himself
[3:52] is letting the people of that age
[3:57] know that he hates it and he
[4:00] is against it and so he denounces
[4:06] these two major doctrines
[4:10] that we were being propagated
[4:14] at that particular time
[4:17] first the doctrine of balaam
[4:22] which introduced idolatry
[4:28] sinful excesses into
[4:32] the nation of israel
[4:36] and the doctrine of the
[4:40] nickelodeons which
[4:43] had been deeds in
[4:46] uh the ephesian church age has
[4:50] now that spirit that doctrine
[4:54] has now grown from its infancy
[4:57] and has come to a place where it's now
[5:01] going to change from deeds
[5:04] into a teaching for the word doctor
[5:10] it means teaching so
[5:14] doctrine means the teaching so we say
[5:17] doctrine of the church is the teaching
[5:19] doctrine of the word it's the teaching
[5:22] okay
[5:22] so here it is that god says this
[5:26] teaching of nickelodeonism
[5:29] these teachings of balaamism
[5:33] see now he hates them all
[5:37] and this when they're complained
[5:41] together like this it
[5:44] is emphasizing to us
[5:47] to be to to start be to recognize
[5:51] and to see why god
[5:54] identified pergamos
[5:58] as the seat where satan is
[6:02] because here is a collusion here is a
[6:06] here is a combination of
[6:09] two devilish false
[6:12] doctrines denounced by god
[6:16] himself because it was here
[6:22] at pardon us
[6:26] that the babylonian
[6:30] teachings that were propounded
[6:34] by nimrod
[6:38] who tried to form his own religion
[6:42] his mother uh his wife uh semiramis
[6:47] uh there
[6:51] as the woman in the picture he started
[6:54] to form his own religion
[6:56] with a mother and son with uh
[6:59] with himself to be worshipped
[7:04] as a god in babylon for
[7:08] as you know he was the founder of bay
[7:10] bell
[7:11] later babylon and from that later we got
[7:15] the god bail
[7:16] so on so here it is
[7:20] that the initial stages of it
[7:25] but now that spirit is growing in
[7:28] strength
[7:29] that teaching is growing in strength
[7:33] and now we see now
[7:36] it's trying to intermingle
[7:40] itself with original christianity
[7:45] just like the serpent did
[7:49] with eve in genesis
[7:53] trying to intermingle himself
[7:58] into the human race to pollute it to
[8:01] hybridize it
[8:02] to create confusion and chaos
[8:06] this is his
[8:10] purpose this is his idea
[8:13] this is what he is attempting to do
[8:17] and this is not just merely my
[8:20] assumption
[8:21] this is not merely the assumption
[8:25] scholars but it is also a historical
[8:30] fact that can be proved because when we
[8:34] go
[8:34] back to 36
[8:38] a.d refined friends
[8:42] that that from 3680 actually
[8:46] to 60 uh 325
[8:51] a.d when they
[8:54] had the council of nicaea
[8:59] we found that christians
[9:02] were at that time were mainly
[9:05] jews or jewish by birth
[9:11] and they were scattered from jerusalem
[9:15] because you remember how
[9:18] that james
[9:21] i believe james head was cut off
[9:25] and so the bible says and then were the
[9:27] believers
[9:29] scattered abroad so believers
[9:32] scattered and some
[9:35] ended up in rome but they were
[9:39] mainly jews okay
[9:43] so here they were from jerusalem now
[9:46] they're
[9:46] in in rome and they went everywhere
[9:50] preaching the gospel of the word of god
[9:55] particularly in the synagogues
[10:00] now about three years later
[10:06] we find two dear precious
[10:09] brothers apostles in christ
[10:13] uh preached the word in rome
[10:16] not peter but junius
[10:22] and also andronicious
[10:26] let me spell those names j u n
[10:29] i u s and
[10:33] andronicious a n d
[10:37] r o n i
[10:40] c u s you will find their names in
[10:45] romans chapter 18
[10:48] chapter 16 verse 7
[10:51] romans chapter 16
[10:55] verse 7 where paul writes of them
[10:59] that there were apostles like himself
[11:03] also and so
[11:07] they went to rome and
[11:10] preached the word of god in the power of
[11:13] the holy
[11:14] spirit and there under their
[11:18] preaching the work of god
[11:21] flourished for several years
[11:25] until the constant
[11:28] altercations between
[11:32] the jews among
[11:35] themselves cause
[11:38] emperor claudius of that time
[11:42] to expel all jews
[11:46] from rome remember
[11:49] most of the jews were christians
[11:53] but there were jewish synagogues
[11:57] still teaching moses's
[12:01] faith and the doctrines and teachings
[12:05] of moses of the old testament
[12:09] now here comes this uh other
[12:12] group of jews from jerusalem
[12:15] on the inspiration of the revelation
[12:20] from jesus christ himself
[12:23] and they started preaching that
[12:26] in rome and in particular
[12:30] they went into the synagogues and began
[12:33] to preach it
[12:35] and of course that caused altercations
[12:39] argumentations debates stripes
[12:42] amongst the jews themselves and
[12:45] emperor claudius was very unhappy about
[12:50] this
[12:52] and so he expelled the jews
[12:56] from rome and banished them from the
[13:00] city
[13:01] and so therefore the backbone
[13:04] or the the foundation of faith
[13:08] of that little flock in
[13:12] rome itself was broken
[13:16] because the elders of the church being
[13:19] mainly jewish
[13:20] they were also banished
[13:23] juniors and dranices they were also
[13:27] banished and had to leave
[13:30] the city of rome remember they
[13:34] were the first christians
[13:38] to go into the city of rome and
[13:41] founded this church now
[13:45] they are expelled from
[13:48] that city of rome
[13:52] and remember the little flock
[13:56] that were already members of the
[13:59] synagogues
[14:00] and then got converted they remained in
[14:04] rome
[14:04] where they already lived the other ones
[14:08] had to leave but those ones that were
[14:12] originally there of course there were
[14:15] few
[14:17] and they were left unattended that is to
[14:20] say without an elder
[14:21] without a pastor you see the importance
[14:24] of having a pastor
[14:26] and not just saying you're a christian
[14:28] and having your bible and i can read
[14:30] at home and i can pray at home and i
[14:32] don't need nobody to tell me anything
[14:34] well god said in the church fivefold
[14:38] ministry
[14:39] of past of prophets and apostles and
[14:42] teachers and elders and administrators
[14:45] and so on
[14:46] it's there in the word of god book of
[14:47] ephesians and so
[14:49] it's important that sheep have a
[14:52] shepherd
[14:53] that churches have a leader
[14:56] a pastor or on the shepherd
[15:00] jesus christ above the pastor
[15:03] below and the pastor then has
[15:06] some helpers around him faithful men
[15:11] that will hold to god's word
[15:14] god's unchanging hand
[15:18] now remember
[15:21] the new testament was not yet written
[15:25] paul's letters were not
[15:28] written and put in this
[15:31] form that we read here now today
[15:34] so they had nothing to uh
[15:37] read every day or study every day
[15:41] or be able to as we have now
[15:44] uh digital and computers to listen to
[15:48] every day they had nothing at all
[15:51] and so philosophers of that day
[15:55] there were different kinds of
[15:57] philosophers of various
[15:59] tribes right of course where back in
[16:02] jerusalem and all over the empire there
[16:05] were stoics
[16:06] they were epicureans there were
[16:09] libertines
[16:10] there were many other groups
[16:14] of philosophers that were expounding
[16:18] all manner of ideas and there was
[16:23] pagans pagan priests
[16:26] pagan teachers that were teaching
[16:29] all manner of ungodly and unscriptural
[16:33] things so the grievous
[16:37] wolves were on the prowl
[16:41] they were now trying to encircle the
[16:44] little group the little church of god
[16:47] that was left there in rome
[16:50] trying to survive without any written
[16:53] word
[16:54] without any leadership or pastoral
[16:58] guidance they were left unattended
[17:01] because the leadership and other
[17:05] brothers and sisters were expelled
[17:08] out of the city of rome
[17:12] and so then the spirit of antichrist
[17:18] or the antichrist spirit took that as an
[17:20] opportunity
[17:21] to be released upon the people
[17:25] everywhere and we find out
[17:29] the little church in rome after
[17:31] consistent
[17:32] attacks of the drip and the dribble
[17:36] of this the attacks of the antichrist
[17:39] spirit
[17:41] it became a backslidden church
[17:45] that church became backslidden
[17:49] under the prevailing pressure and the
[17:53] constant knocks and hits and
[17:56] verbal and mental assaults
[17:59] that was made against it
[18:02] and so little by little
[18:06] it began to introduce
[18:10] pagan babylonian pagan
[18:13] ceremonies and rights
[18:17] within the christian church
[18:21] hiding it covering it up
[18:25] under christian titles
[18:30] oh my friends
[18:33] these names changed
[18:37] and hidden under christian titles
[18:40] let me not expand on that but you can
[18:43] take the
[18:44] your thought and take the word of god
[18:47] and think on these things
[18:51] now this period
[18:54] of banishment or expulsion
[18:59] ran for about uh
[19:02] 18 years for about 13 years
[19:07] and then we found that their founders
[19:09] the apostles junius
[19:11] andronicius and andre nishas
[19:15] came back they came back in 54
[19:19] a.d imagine
[19:22] their horror imagine
[19:25] how horrified they were
[19:29] to discover that
[19:32] the christian church that they left that
[19:35] was
[19:36] christian was now woefully
[19:40] unhorribly pagan
[19:44] in its way and its action
[19:48] they found there were altars now in the
[19:51] church
[19:53] upon which altars that place
[19:56] incense was there in the church
[20:01] they found pagan rites were being
[20:05] celebrated and carried on
[20:08] within the church
[20:12] and when they tried to go to the
[20:16] leadership of the church that left
[20:19] behind
[20:21] that had now taken up these paganistic
[20:24] ceremonies
[20:25] rights and doings
[20:28] those leaders would not speak with them
[20:33] they would not have any contact with
[20:36] them
[20:36] they will take no advice nor word
[20:40] of god from them and unite them
[20:43] an audience together for discussion
[20:48] so with the
[20:52] few faithful to the word
[20:56] that remained that would not accept any
[20:59] of that
[21:00] they took those few believers that were
[21:04] still
[21:04] faithful to the word and started
[21:08] a new church so
[21:11] now my topic is the rise of the false
[21:15] church
[21:16] here we see the picture of two sons in
[21:20] the garden
[21:21] two vines two
[21:24] two two churches the false church
[21:30] and the true church for here now
[21:33] these brothers are starting a new church
[21:37] or a second church remember they had
[21:39] started the first one
[21:41] it started under genuine christianity
[21:45] but got hybridized and mixed with
[21:48] babylonian rites and ceremonies
[21:52] and the titles of their gods and
[21:55] goddesses were covered up by using
[21:57] christian
[21:58] names and christian titles upon them
[22:02] which the real believers could not stand
[22:05] and so by separating themselves
[22:09] unwillingly but they had to do it junius
[22:13] and andronicius founded
[22:16] also the second church
[22:19] of rome and
[22:22] god began to work amongst them in
[22:26] a mighty way with
[22:29] various signs and wonders and
[22:32] confirmations and authentications
[22:36] of the truth of the word of god that was
[22:39] being
[22:40] declared displayed and
[22:43] demonstrated by the evidence of the
[22:46] presence of the holy spirit
[22:48] of the living god amongst them and so
[22:53] the church second church was started
[22:57] a third church was also started
[23:01] but let's speak of the first and the
[23:04] second church
[23:08] now this first church
[23:12] was reproached rebuked
[23:15] for being pagan and not christian
[23:19] in its worship and still they would
[23:22] not give up their evil
[23:26] way contrary to the word of god
[23:30] and they refused to give up the title
[23:34] of being the first church of rome
[23:38] you see for their word of first church
[23:41] of rome founded by genuine apostles
[23:45] juniors and andronicious but then
[23:49] after their expulsion the church left by
[23:53] itself
[23:55] backslid it slid backwards
[23:59] it slid into paganism babylonianism
[24:03] philosopher philosophic teachings
[24:07] all manner of
[24:10] esoteric beliefs and were
[24:14] taken off into vain mysteries of the
[24:18] world and of the pagan
[24:21] uh culture of that particular
[24:25] time and so they refused to give up
[24:28] their title
[24:29] of being the first church of
[24:32] rome and
[24:35] remain and still remains
[24:40] to this very day they
[24:44] hold on to that title
[24:48] of first church of rome
[24:53] and of course we know it today in our
[24:55] modern times
[24:57] as the roman catholic church
[25:01] now the majority of us have this
[25:05] mistaken idea
[25:08] that any and all and everybody who just
[25:12] call themselves christians
[25:16] would be the target of the devil but
[25:19] that's not
[25:20] so because you may call yourself a
[25:22] christian
[25:24] but you will you may really be a a
[25:27] servant
[25:28] a slave of the devil
[25:32] and the devil knows his own
[25:35] and the devil will make a way for his
[25:37] own
[25:39] and so we find that
[25:42] government government tyranny
[25:46] persecution and trial
[25:49] my friends
[25:53] we expect to come against the real true
[25:56] church
[25:57] but the false church knows
[26:00] how to ingratiate itself
[26:04] how to insinuate itself
[26:07] intertwine along with the
[26:11] government and its officials
[26:16] and so it began to grow in numbers
[26:20] it began to thrive or
[26:23] succeed it began to grow in every
[26:27] possible way
[26:29] and they began to have
[26:33] influence with the
[26:37] with emperors various officials
[26:40] of the time uh of the government
[26:44] and so emperors and officials began to
[26:48] favor that particular so-called
[26:52] first church of rome let me repeat
[26:56] it was and still is and
[26:59] it is the truth when they make the claim
[27:03] that they are the first church of rome
[27:06] for indeed they are founded not by peter
[27:12] but by junius and andronicious
[27:16] there it is later the backslid
[27:19] from off the word of god right
[27:23] that backslid from the word of god into
[27:26] babylonianism
[27:28] paganism and all manner
[27:31] of false ceremonies and false forms
[27:35] of worship so now they
[27:39] found themselves in favor
[27:42] with the government with the officials
[27:45] of the day
[27:46] they used that as their opportunity
[27:51] to turn the government against the true
[27:55] believers
[27:56] that were holding to the word of god
[28:00] of course the true believers
[28:03] turn to be in little homes little
[28:06] churches
[28:07] uh here there in caves
[28:10] which i have personally visited some
[28:14] in rome itself uh visited there
[28:18] and so believers
[28:21] were scattered and had to even
[28:25] hide to really worship
[28:28] god and so these
[28:33] officials began to favor the first
[28:35] church
[28:36] because they had bigger buildings bigger
[28:40] numbers they had great uh
[28:43] colorful services colorful
[28:47] processions that will captivate the mind
[28:50] the eye the sight the sound the smell
[28:54] all the five senses satan knows how to
[28:57] manipulate it
[28:58] all and he uses the colors the sound
[29:01] the bells the smells and everything else
[29:04] to captivate to capture
[29:08] the minds of the people and
[29:11] be able to slip in
[29:14] all of his false teachings as if
[29:18] it's real in the name of christ
[29:23] untrue to the word of god
[29:26] but doing it in the name of christ while
[29:29] what the the persons or
[29:33] people are really being fed
[29:37] is babylonian religion
[29:41] disguised with christian
[29:44] words christian names and
[29:47] in the name of the christian faith
[29:51] and so here it is they turned the
[29:55] government
[29:57] against the true believers and demanded
[30:01] their persecution
[30:02] i just want to interject something is
[30:04] very careful
[30:06] because we see here whenever a church
[30:09] begins to grow in science
[30:12] whenever the pastor of that church
[30:15] starts to have
[30:17] some influence with
[30:20] hundreds thousands of people
[30:24] that is like a magnet for politicians
[30:30] and politicians in every way will seek
[30:33] some way how they can
[30:37] gain influence with that pastor with
[30:40] that church
[30:41] so when it comes for their election they
[30:45] can now manipulate
[30:48] those people they manipulate the public
[30:51] with various ways uh in in third world
[30:55] countries they'll manipulate the people
[30:56] with drink with drugs with food with
[30:59] chicken in every pot with the bottle for
[31:01] every
[31:02] person and stuff like that oh yes
[31:05] my friends that's what would happen
[31:08] but politicians practically they
[31:11] look at the numbers they analyze it
[31:16] and then they begin to play on it
[31:19] and see how how they can influence it
[31:22] therefore we need to be
[31:23] very careful and very watchful and
[31:26] vigilant
[31:27] about these things now i'm not saying
[31:29] every politician
[31:31] is evil i'm just saying in general
[31:34] when politics begins to introduce itself
[31:37] in the church we must be
[31:39] vigilant and watchful because i know
[31:43] of wonderful christian man
[31:47] and actually as i stand here speaking to
[31:49] you i can say with confidence
[31:52] i know personally and speak
[31:56] just like maybe about two weeks ago
[31:58] speaking with the president
[32:00] of a country of two presidents
[32:03] of two countries and they're christian
[32:06] men and so i'm not saying every
[32:08] politician
[32:10] but politics as a whole it's not
[32:14] really of god it's of the devil
[32:17] now we find out back to my subject here
[32:21] how that once this church gained favor
[32:25] it began to influence the government
[32:29] the government in turn wanting the
[32:32] numbers the
[32:33] influence the beauty
[32:36] and the system of that particular
[32:40] uh so-called christian faith
[32:43] or religion to use it
[32:47] and to have its power behind them
[32:50] they aligned themselves with it and
[32:52] began to
[32:53] persecute the genuine
[32:56] christians now my friends
[33:00] at that time
[33:04] the first bishop of that church of rome
[33:09] his name was anecetus
[33:13] e n i c
[33:16] e t u s and he lived
[33:21] in the second century
[33:25] bishop of the first church of rome
[33:28] and was a contemporary
[33:32] to polycarp the great servant of god
[33:37] no polycarp by this time was
[33:40] old and venerable
[33:44] but he took the time to travel for 1500
[33:48] miles
[33:50] to return to rome to see if he could
[33:54] speak to anesthetists
[33:58] and to convince them or convince him
[34:02] and them that they had wandered away
[34:06] from the word of god
[34:10] he implored with them to change
[34:14] he went to visit the churches i mean the
[34:17] churches of the
[34:18] first church of rome
[34:21] and the one that had backslidden
[34:25] not the first church of christianity as
[34:28] might be suggested or claimed
[34:30] because the first church was already
[34:33] there
[34:34] started by the holy ghost himself on the
[34:36] day of pentecost
[34:38] we're talking about after that time
[34:41] the backsliding took place when
[34:44] the jews were expelled out of
[34:48] rome and the few that remained
[34:52] were under assault by philosophy
[34:56] by babylonian mysteries
[34:59] influenced by pagan theories
[35:03] and teachings and backslid
[35:06] off of the word of god
[35:10] and they are the first
[35:13] church of rome alone
[35:17] amen get that lie out of your mind
[35:23] first church of rome not of christianity
[35:29] yes that is true so
[35:33] polycarp traveled 1500 miles
[35:37] came back to rome tried to speak to
[35:41] anacetus
[35:43] tried to speak to the church
[35:46] he went to the church and what did he
[35:49] see
[35:50] to his surprise he saw them prostrating
[35:53] themselves
[35:55] before images which the book of exodus
[35:59] god tells us you shall not
[36:03] make any graven image
[36:06] thou shalt not bow down to them
[36:10] nor serve them for i the lord thy
[36:14] god am a jealous god
[36:18] nevertheless polycarp witnessed it
[36:21] with his own eyes that these people were
[36:26] claiming to be christians claiming to be
[36:28] believers
[36:31] but yet were bowing down and prostrating
[36:34] themselves
[36:35] to idols idol's
[36:39] named with the name
[36:42] of those apostles
[36:46] named after various christians
[36:51] bowing down to them
[36:55] he saw also
[36:59] them lighting candles in the church
[37:05] he saw them burning incense
[37:10] he saw them celebrating
[37:14] the passover
[37:18] and they changed the name
[37:22] and began to call it easter
[37:25] which we do use this very name today
[37:29] i as a believer no
[37:32] you i use the word easter too but i know
[37:36] really what is behind it and you ought
[37:38] to know also
[37:40] for the word easter really
[37:43] comes from the name of astarte
[37:48] that is the wife of nimrod that's
[37:52] another name
[37:53] for semoramus astarte
[37:56] and out of that easter don't be deceived
[38:00] it doesn't come from
[38:01] esther that is jewish but
[38:04] easter that is pagan
[38:08] it really comes from the name of astarte
[38:13] now watch it now we celeb we do
[38:16] celebrate
[38:17] easter if you want to call it that but
[38:20] we celebrated
[38:22] recognizing the blood of christ what he
[38:25] did for us how he died for us
[38:27] but that's a topic for another day or
[38:30] another time
[38:32] now here it is friends they celebrated
[38:36] that and what do they do
[38:39] they also bring in a cross
[38:44] but with the cross in the church
[38:47] they elevate a round disc
[38:52] which is a symbol of the s-u-n
[38:56] god they elevate the disc
[39:00] claiming that is the bread that must be
[39:04] broken and they even give you that in a
[39:09] wafer
[39:10] on your tongue a round
[39:13] disc like that and
[39:16] cause the people to use that
[39:19] and that is really honoring
[39:23] the sun god uh
[39:26] if you will look behind a lot of these
[39:29] altars
[39:30] somewhere or sometimes they'll have it
[39:32] on a pole
[39:34] the sun burst you'll see the form of a
[39:37] sun with rays
[39:38] going out in every direction that's what
[39:41] that is
[39:42] all about honoring and worshiping
[39:46] this sun god and then
[39:51] they'll pour out some wine
[39:54] claiming communion but the the last of
[39:57] the wine
[39:59] they'll pour it on the ground which was
[40:02] a
[40:02] they were pouring it on the ground which
[40:04] was a libation
[40:07] to those pagan gods
[40:10] of that particular time
[40:14] and polycarp was so distressed
[40:18] he turned to leave and as he was about
[40:21] to leave
[40:22] the voice of god spoke through him
[40:25] with the spirit of prophecy saying
[40:29] ephraim is married to his idols
[40:34] leave him alone let him alone
[40:37] and polycarp left and
[40:40] never returned to rome
[40:45] following an anastasius
[40:49] was a wicked bishop of rome
[40:53] called victor and he
[40:56] introduced into the church even more
[41:00] pagan festivals
[41:03] and ceremonies into that first church
[41:08] and he also made a great effort
[41:13] to go to the real or second
[41:17] christian church of rome to convince
[41:21] them
[41:22] to come back into a unity or oneness
[41:26] with him the false church
[41:31] they refuse and they would not
[41:35] do what he requested
[41:38] and so he went to the government
[41:42] and prevailed upon the government to
[41:45] persecute those believers who would dare
[41:49] to refuse to join themselves
[41:52] along with him oh
[41:56] and so the government started on a
[41:59] campaign
[42:01] where they dragged a lot of them
[42:04] into the courts cast
[42:08] many of them into prisons
[42:12] and even taking many of them
[42:16] to their debts
[42:19] oh vile what examples
[42:24] of his vile deeds can be
[42:27] found by reading history
[42:31] where emperor sekimus
[42:35] severus was prevailed upon
[42:40] by callistus the
[42:43] a friend of victor
[42:47] to kill seven thousand
[42:50] believers true believers
[42:53] at thessalonica there it was
[42:57] thessalonian
[42:59] because the these true believers refused
[43:02] to carry out the passover
[43:04] the way that these pagans did with their
[43:08] with their disc their sun burst of their
[43:11] sun
[43:12] god of course they will not tell you
[43:14] that it's just an emblem
[43:16] oh it's just something we have in the
[43:18] church it doesn't mean that
[43:21] that's it but the believers refused to
[43:24] bow
[43:25] down to it they refused to serve it they
[43:28] refused to recognize it
[43:30] and instead they carried out the lord's
[43:34] supper
[43:34] the way we do with the breaking of the
[43:37] bread
[43:39] the drinking of the wine
[43:42] amen and of prayers together
[43:46] in the name of the lord and not
[43:49] according
[43:51] to the way they wanted them to worship
[43:55] astarte worship the sun
[43:59] and the sun god so already we can see
[44:04] the false vine was killing
[44:08] the true vine turning its anger
[44:13] against the living god
[44:16] by destroying and killing the elect
[44:20] of that particular day even as
[44:23] kane killed a bell
[44:26] notice carefully here i want to make a
[44:29] parallel
[44:29] for here we see this first church
[44:33] founded by junius
[44:37] and adrenacious first church
[44:42] and it turned into a false church
[44:45] even so cain from the same
[44:48] mother with abel but by a different
[44:52] father which was the serpent
[44:56] who stood upright and was
[45:00] like a man but had no soul
[45:04] and she bore these
[45:07] twins cain and abel
[45:12] one of adam one of the serpent
[45:16] just as these apostles bore these two
[45:18] churches
[45:21] one my friends
[45:24] of the devil one of babylonianism
[45:28] and one of the true and the living god
[45:31] and by his
[45:32] word and just as cain
[45:37] was angry against god and killed his own
[45:40] brother
[45:41] the same spirit is now in that same
[45:44] church
[45:46] angry against its brothers
[45:51] and will even stir up the government
[45:56] to kill to hinder to stop
[46:00] his own brother watch watch cain's altar
[46:04] with flowers with fruits with everything
[46:07] else the bible says beautiful
[46:10] look at the contrast with abel simple
[46:12] humble
[46:14] killing a lamb and stressing this talk
[46:17] about the blood of christ
[46:19] the blood of the lamb back there it was
[46:21] in type
[46:22] but now we have the reality and see we
[46:25] i'm trying to show you it's the same
[46:27] spirit
[46:28] down through thousands of years present
[46:31] here today in our time
[46:34] in our day here upon the earth
[46:38] the true church of course tried to get
[46:41] the
[46:42] false church to repent to turn
[46:45] from its wicked ways and it would not do
[46:48] so
[46:48] and it would do so why because it was
[46:52] increasing in size
[46:54] increasing in influence see that's what
[46:56] they call success
[46:58] that's another topic for another time
[47:01] they don't know what real good
[47:02] real success is but then uh they grew in
[47:06] size
[47:08] and they started on the campaign
[47:11] to discredit and to belittle
[47:15] the true church building their great
[47:19] big ostentatious buildings
[47:22] so that when you have a little place to
[47:25] worship in that looks like a barn that
[47:27] looks like a
[47:28] that's nothing as far as they're
[47:29] concerned and that's how they
[47:32] uh belittle the true church and
[47:35] discredit it
[47:36] and belittle a true seed
[47:40] and be began to claim that
[47:43] they were the only true
[47:46] representatives of the lord jesus christ
[47:50] as they're claiming now that they are
[47:54] the only true
[47:55] representative of the lord jesus christ
[47:59] not in rome but here on earth
[48:03] they believe and teach such which is
[48:08] false against the word of god
[48:11] amen and so here's the bitter
[48:15] difference arising
[48:18] amongst them amen
[48:22] because they were they continue to claim
[48:24] to this day
[48:25] that they are the first church and
[48:29] that is undisputed it is the truth
[48:33] they are the first church that was
[48:36] founded in rome that is to say the first
[48:40] pentecostal church the first original
[48:43] church
[48:44] to backslide from the word of god and
[48:48] into evil and sin
[48:51] contrary to the word of god
[48:54] oh my dear friends we see now
[49:00] the churches began to have bitter
[49:03] differences
[49:05] amongst them departing some departing
[49:09] from the truth
[49:10] marrying themselves to idols having no
[49:14] life in them whatsoever hybrid dies
[49:19] taking the wrong seed to produce
[49:22] something half christianity
[49:24] half world half christianity half pagan
[49:27] half christianity half wrapped up with
[49:30] all
[49:31] manner of evil that we can see
[49:34] upon the earth of god amen
[49:37] and here we find out friends powerful in
[49:41] our
[49:41] numbers of her membership
[49:45] powerful in influence she is
[49:48] powerful and favored and
[49:51] loved by the high and mighty
[49:54] of this world and the
[49:58] other group they are persecuted
[50:03] they are counted as sheep
[50:06] to be slaughtered by these evil sayings
[50:09] doings attacks and undercover
[50:13] belittlings and discrediting by
[50:16] this wicked system
[50:19] that will come against the true church
[50:21] of the living
[50:22] god amen but thank god
[50:26] amongst this persecuted group the sick
[50:30] are healed
[50:32] the word is preached hallelujah
[50:36] the holy ghost falls upon the people and
[50:39] is alive
[50:40] with the word of god and demonstrations
[50:45] and interpretation of the word
[50:48] of the living god thank god the people
[50:52] of this
[50:52] group this true church they loved their
[50:56] own lives but not more than the word of
[50:59] god
[51:00] hallelujah and they hold his
[51:03] name and all to his faith
[51:07] and they will the bible says be faithful
[51:10] unto death and i will give you
[51:14] a crown of life may the great holy
[51:17] spirit
[51:18] give to every one of us that holds to
[51:21] god's eternal word and walls to the
[51:25] truth of the promised word of this day
