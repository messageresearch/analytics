[Music] good evening friends it is with great joy i come to you once again on this good friday evening thanking the lord for what he has done for us which has brought us here together to give glory

come before thee with thanksgiving with honor and with praise may the great holy spirit bless this service tonight pour out of yourself upon your people cleanse us straighten us lead us and guide us for thy name's sake amen praise god my friends i i would like to make this clear to you that this is not the regular service uh where i will be preaching uh uh an entire sermon but i will make uh a table talk or a meditation something to inspire our minds as we think about the cross on which our lord jesus died and how he shed his blood for our sins rose again for our justification and one day my friends he ascended up into heaven and is soon to return to catch his waiting right away and so we are here today specifically for this service of the lord's supper also called communion and so we will spend that time or this time in the presence of the lord as we focus upon this in the book of psalms chapter 107 verses 1 and 8. all give thanks unto the lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men and again in psalm chapter 24 verses 3 and 4 who shall ascend into the hill of the lord or who shall stand in his holy place he that had clean hands and a pure heart who had not lifted up his soul onto vanity nor sworn deceitfully let us pray once again our righteous heavenly father be blessed thy glorious name for the gift of redemption through jesus christ our lord we are thanking you also lord for the changes you have brought about in our lives through the holy spirit and what the great work that you are working in us now grant to us now your grace and mercy as we lift our hearts in worship and praise unto your glorious name help us to come with sincere humble and reverent hearts and may we come and meet with you father bless us give us your approval and may we recognize you in the breaking of the bread and the wine as the disciples did in days of all this we ask through jesus christ our lord and savior amen and amen now if you do have a song book by you or if you do know this glorious hymn of the church and of our faith amazing grace we'd like to sing that wonderful song together as we worship the name of our lord jesus christ amazing grace how sweet the sound shall we join together wherever you are around the world in your home by the side of your bed kneeling before an altar sing this song as we worship the lord and sing it together from the bottom of your hearts as we give to him the glory that is due to his wonderful name let us begin again amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved like me i once was lost but now i am found was blind but now i see plus grace that taught my heart to fear towards grace that taught my heart to fear and grief my face relieved how precious did that grace appear the r i first believed through many dangers toils and snares can you say that through many dangers toils and snares i have already come his grace has brought me safe thus far and his grace will lead me home let's sing together as we glorify the name of the lord dangers toils and snares i have already calm this grace had brought me safe thus far and the grace will lead me home when we've been there ten thousand years bright shining us the sun we've no less days to sing god's praise than when we first be gone yes truly amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved the wretch like me truly friends we once were lost but now we're found we once were blind but now we see oh praise be to god glory to your wonderful name heavenly father thank you lord jesus for the opening of our hearts the opening of our eyes the unstopping of our ears thank you for the love we feel and experience within us by the opening of your word truly it's amazing grace lord for you have called us out of this darkened sin curse world that we're living in one in a million out of a million i am one that you have called by your grace and i'm here today giving you thanks and praise o god in jesus marvelous and wonderful name shall we turn in our bibles to exodus chapter 20. exodus chapter 20 and we will commence to read from verses 1 to 17 it reads thus the lord speak these words saying i am the lord thy god which brought thee out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondage thou shalt have no other gods beside me thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any lightness of anything that is in the heavens above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth thou shalt not bow down to them nor serve them for i the lord thy god i am a jealous god visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generations of them that hate me and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain for the lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain remember this sabbath day to keep it holy six days shalt thou label and do all thy work but the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord in it thou shalt do no work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter thy man's servant nor thy maid servant nor thy cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gates for in six days the lord made heaven and earth the sea and all that in them is and rested on the seventh day wherefore the lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it honor thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon the land which the lord thy god giveth thee thou shalt not kill thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house nor his man's servant nor his maidservant nor his ops nor his ass nor anything that is thy neighbors now of course the summary of all of this will be found in the words of the lord jesus christ himself when he spoke in matthew chapter 22 verses 37 to 39. thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbor as thy self thanks be to god we have come through the seventh day week of the seven church ages we are now entering in or have entered into the eighth day or which is back to the first day we will speak on this measure at another time why the all sabbath naturally speaking is not practiced today and show it clearly from the word of god but for now we give god the glory and praise for what he has given to us listen out of galatians chapter 9 if you have your bibles you can find that verses 19 to 23 now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lascaviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance strife emulations wrath seditions heresies envyings drunkenness murders revelings and such light of the which i tell you before as i have told you in times past that they who do these things shall not inherit the kingdom of god but the fruit of the spirit is love and joy and peace long-suffering gentleness goodness and faith meekness temperance against such there is no law oh praise be to god amen hallelujah brothers and sisters how wonderful to know this is the god that we serve now in first corinthians chapter 11. we find these words for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed when he had given thanks took bread and break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had sup saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he comes again wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man let a woman let a young person let a child let them examine themselves and so let them eat of this bread and of this cup shall we sing a wonderful hymn of praise and glory to god while the thankfulness of worship springs up like a well within our heart i believe a fitting song will be on a hill far away stood an old rugged cross the emblem of suffering and shame and i love that old cross where the dearest and best for a world of lost sinners was slain so i'll cherish the old rugged cross till my trophies at last i lay down i will cling to the old rugged cross and exchange it someday for a crown and i promise you lord to the old rugged cross i will ever be true it's shame and reproach gladly bear then he'll call me someday to my home far away where his glory forever i'll share shall we sing this wonderful hymn together lifting our hearts and voices to the lord whether you're alone whether you are in a a group a church whether it's a set of people in a home or you are under a tree oh let us lift our hearts and hands and voices to the lord as we sing this song on a hill far away stood an old rugged cross the emblem of suffering and shame i love that old cross we're the rest and best for a world of laws sinners was slain so i'll cherish the old rugged cross till my trophies at last i lay down i will cling to the old rugged cross and exchange it someday for a crown to the old rugged cross i will ever be true it's shame and reproach gladly bear then he'll call me someday to my home far away where his glory forever share so i'll cherish the old rugged cross till my true fees at lest i lay down i will cling to the old rocket cross and exchange it someday for a crown [Music] mm-hmm [Music] [Music] to my home far away where is glory forever i'll share yes my brothers and sisters one day soon we'll share his glory together with him as his beloved bride we look to that wonderful day we are watching we are waiting faithfully for the coming of the lord to catch his waiting bride away he who promised in his word i go to prepare a place for you that where i am you may be also if it were not so i would have told you in my father's house there are many mansions praise be to god hallelujah i thank god for this marvelous word this marvelous promise and this great sacrifice that he has made just a brief talk about remember his sacrifice just a little meditation that we can take within our hearts now paul was speaking here to the corinthian church and this church had a lot of problems and one of its main problems was that it was compromising and putting up with sin amongst its members or its membership also they have no problem in treating some people better than others whether by position uh whether by wealth or poverty whether by education or lack of education whether black or white or brown or or yellow whatever they were making a difference amongst the brethren and the lord has taught us we are one in the words of a great uh marvelous um troubadour one love one heart one soul one faith one lord one baptism all one holy spirit within our hearts within our lives oh glory be to god but they were making a difference for god has made of all men one blood that's found in the book of acts god is made of all nations of one blood praise god regardless of your outside color inside we are of one blood we are one people in christ and the love of god fills our hearts and our minds that we see jesus only in our brothers and sisters amen another problem in the church is that they had no there was no restraint upon them with holding food and shelter or clothing or any kind of help from those who were less fortunate they had this kind of a mentality and culture well every man or woman for themselves and uh you do your best and i'm going to do whatever i can and if you would help yourself i would help you that was not so with the true people of god for the bible says in the book of acts they had all things common and they helped the brethren in various ways that they could they reached out to one another and shared the love of god and the bounty and the blessing of the lord upon their lives now that church used to have something called a love feast today we will call it uh a barbecue or a church potluck supper but you see certain members held back their potluck their rich wonderful well-prepared food they held it back from some while they gave to others they had partiality amongst them and they did not share equally and freely whatever they had with the love of god within their hearts amen and paul warned them that whenever you did that you were sinning against god and you need to examine yourself you cannot come to the lord's table with sin within the heart that is why the bible tells us let a person man woman young person child examine themselves examine take a counter account of yourself you'll take your account book and you check on your accounts to see if you're owing or if you are you're in the red you check your comic books let us check our lives let us search our hearts let us take a count to see where we stand with god you say well brother simon i can't take the lord's supper uh today because of this or because of that or i know i done this or i said that or i even sought that or when i was coming to church and i had an argument or something whatever it is listen the bible tells us even if we did something wrong one minute ago but if we come and we confess our faults our sins our mistakes we repent of the wrong we have done oh my praise the lord he says he is just and he is able and willing to forgive us of all our sins and cleanse us in his precious blood oh precious is the flow that makes me whiter snow no other fountain i know nothing but the blood of jesus oh thanks be unto god hallelujah amen now what are the proper elements for the lord's supper of course it is the bread and the wine the bread represents of course his broken body broken for us when this suffer he suffered for us i as isaiah told us as matthew mark luke and john tells us they they hit him with the whips with metal pieces on the end ripped the flesh from his body he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by his stripes we are healed oh praise god he who knew no sin became sin for us that we may go free in other words the devil would have kept you in his jailhouse but jesus took your place so that you may come out and walk free and whole and saved by the grace of god the wine represents notice i said wine the bible doesn't tell us juice the bible does not tell us pepsi or coke just because it looks like wine the bible does not tell us crackers because it looks like bread oh no the bread of course should be unleavened bread no yeast in it and the wine should be real wine because the wine has stimulative properties and that stimulation represents the activity of the holy spirit upon the word that is in your heart that the holy spirit will stimulate the word that is within your heart oh praise god hallelujah the holy spirit quickens the word that is within your heart this is what the wine represents representing the blood of jesus which the pentecostals don't understand that it's not speaking of red blood that dropped on the ground in israel when he was when he was killed on the cross but the blood the life is in the blood and the wine is a symbol of his life it's a token of his life hallelujah so you're saying lord i i examine myself i repent i cast off my old life i cast off my old habits i break every curse i cast it all away from myself and i take into a and upon me the life of jesus christ may his life hallelujah fill my heart fill my life fill my being right now because i take his life within me of course the wine which represents the blood also look that looks back to the time when they sacrifice animals lambs goats sheep you know in the time of israel the blood of those animals was accepted by god as a covering for their sins so the wine let us look back to that that christ was and is our covering oh praise god hallelujah but my friends now we take him he bear look he has already shed his blood now not only as a covering but his blood is like bleach that cleanses us bleaches out the dark spots in our lives takes away all the oily evil of satan from us and makes us white as snow our hearts and hands and voices lifted up to him in praise and honor and glory and so let us come with the proper attitude to god forbid the proper attitude of reverence solemnity sincerity a brokenness before the lord hallelujah now as we take the lord's supper as i've said and will repeat let us examine ourselves and we should examine ourselves because sin keeps us from the proper relationship and fellowship with god so let us examine ourselves while i'm yet speaking begin to search your heart and begin to ask god search me o god and know my heart today cleanse me o savior from all my sins i pray see if there be any wicked way in me and cleanse me from every sin lord and set me free hallelujah so we come and examine ourselves that we may have the right relationship between us and god and we also coming examining ourselves because we have blessed assurance from him that if you come you confess your sins confess your faults i will forgive oh praise god there's a little old song i love to sing and the saints of god have heard me sing it before and it goes something like this if i have won that sum for soul today [Music] if i have walked in my own will for way o or if i offend some other true the strain dear lord forgive [Music] forgive the sins that i confess to thee forgive the things i cannot say oh god may god forgive us of our sins cleanse us from our inequities and draw us closer to him and bring us into a right relationship with him and there are others despite what i'm saying that who will not examine themselves who will not search their hearts who will not give up their crimes their evil and their faults their habits that they hold to them the bible tells us they will be judged by the living god for it says for this reason some are weak some are sick and others sleep in other words some are made sick and others even die because they will not repent and they will not take the lord's supper they will not turn away from the sins that are plaguing their lives and therefore they suffer the effects of it within their heart my friends let me give you a few moments right now to examine your heart we'll be bar heads we close our eyes will we ask the lord to cleanse us from our sins let us do self-examination now in the quietness in the presence of the lord lift up your heads look up praise god for this moment of self examination of course it's the lord jesus himself this is not a tradition of man man has taken it and tried to turn it into a tradition but we do not do this by tradition we do this by faith by revelation knowing what we are doing we come believing and we go rejoicing hallelujah for in these simple elements represented here before me we in this we see the spiritual element the profundity of the of these emblems the deep representation of them the wine which represents his blood and the bread which represents his broken body friends we are blessed we have these memorials given to us from his own hands saying do this as a memorial unto me do this in remembrance of me and when we come to this table we come to meet with our savior individually as we talk to him within our hearts expressing our more our innermost thoughts fears unspoken things that none other can hear for we are not told in the bible we ought to confess to a a man a priest or person whoever but we are to confess to the lord jesus christ himself hallelujah for he is the only mediator between god and man jesus christ so we come to this table to meet with our savior to look back upon that's his sacrifice and to ask for the cleansing and forgiveness of our sins we come also to refresh ourselves to renew our walk with god hallelujah and if we have fallen away somewhat to restore our face and restore our cells in the presence of the living god and to restore ourselves as part of this body to renew ourselves in the local church and to my friends feel refreshed with our sense of redemption and forgiveness that comes from the hand of god and to revive our hopes on our faith in the return of our lord jesus and the rapture of his beloved bride it is with joy excitement that i await the coming of the lord my friends in the words of god's servant prophet there is no future but the coming of the lord look ahead all you can see perilous times dark times darkness covers the land oh praise god but the people don't understand what the evening lights have come oh praise god god's prophet has walked the land amen preaching god's word declaring the truth amen that's the at evening time it shall be light and the light is here our eyes have been opened and we give him the praise and the honor and the glory o praise god now as we come to the lord's supper itself the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread as i now do ministering it in his marvelous and wonderful name and when he had given thanks he break it i will now give thanks heavenly father we give thee thanks for this bread which represents your broken body broken for us wounded and bleeding for sinners pleading oh god there you hung you were dying for me you were dying for us lord we thank thee for this bread which represents your body beaten broken and bleeding for us thank you lord for this bread which represents your broken body now let each one of us take a piece of this bread holding it within our hands as we await the serving of the wine by the officers the brethren and the church after the same manner also he took the cup as i now do ministering the wine in his name and when he had stopped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me thank god let us give thanks to god for the precious blood of christ that was shed for us oh precious is the flow that makes me white as snow no other found i know nothing but the blood of jesus nothing can for sin a tone nothing but the blood of jesus not of god that i have done nothing but the blood of jesus oh precious is the flow that makes me white as snow no other found i know nothing but the blood of g zones now as often as you eat this bread as we prepare now to take the bread and wine and as often as you drink this cup you don't show the lord's death till he comes let us all now take the bread and the one and the wine and let us commune with the lord briefly another quiet time as you take the bread take the wine commune with the lord within your heart having another moment of silence thank you lord so do so there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from emmanuel's veins and sinners plunge beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains lose all their guilty stains lose all their guilty stains oh praise god heavenly father may we all lose our guilty stains for that dying thief rejoice to see that fountain in his day and hear me i though vile as he wash all my sins away may we wash all our sins away in the great fountain of your blood oh the cleansing blood i see i see it cleanset me it cleanseth me lord wash me now and make me whole make me holy thine in jesus name i ask it amen and amen now the blessing of god be upon you as it is written in the book of hebrews chapter 13 verses 20 to 21. now the god of peace that brought again from the dead our lord jesus that great
