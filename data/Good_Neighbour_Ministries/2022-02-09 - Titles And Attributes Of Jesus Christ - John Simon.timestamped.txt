[0:36] tonight
[0:38] we want to study
[0:40] concerning the the titles
[0:44] and attributes
[0:45] of jesus christ
[0:47] our lord
[0:49] in relation
[0:51] to this last
[0:54] and seventh church age
[0:57] and why
[0:59] and how
[1:01] he
[1:02] presented himself
[1:04] in such a manner
[1:06] uh to bring out certain truths to us
[1:10] that will straighten us
[1:13] and give us
[1:14] the foundations
[1:17] as we face the fury of satan
[1:20] in these last days
[1:22] may god bless us together
[1:26] as we go into this
[1:29] wonderful study
[1:31] of the titles
[1:33] and attributes
[1:35] of our lord jesus christ
[1:37] our scripture is found
[1:40] in revelation chapter 3
[1:44] verse 14
[1:47] and on to the angel of the church of
[1:51] ledicia
[1:53] of the ledecians
[1:55] right
[1:56] these things said the amen
[2:01] the faithful
[2:03] and true
[2:05] witness
[2:07] the beginning of the creation of god
[2:12] hallelujah
[2:15] loving
[2:18] heavenly father
[2:20] who is watching over us in tender care
[2:26] feed life luck we pray
[2:29] forgive
[2:31] me for any
[2:32] human
[2:34] weaknesses
[2:36] faults or failures in any way
[2:39] were in word thought or deed
[2:43] and let me not stand in your way lord
[2:47] but may your spirit help me and enable
[2:51] me
[2:52] to be able to
[2:55] step away from self
[2:57] and step into christ
[3:00] that you may be
[3:02] glorified
[3:04] this we ask
[3:06] in the name of our
[3:08] blessed lord jesus
[3:11] amen
[3:13] and amen
[3:16] praise god
[3:18] these things
[3:20] said the amen
[3:23] the and the faithful and true witness
[3:27] the beginning
[3:28] of the creation of god what a wonderful
[3:34] description
[3:36] of the
[3:37] attributes
[3:39] of our lovely
[3:41] lord jesus christ
[3:44] when we uh
[3:46] say and read those things
[3:49] it wants to make me shout
[3:52] uh and jump and
[3:55] magnify
[3:56] the name of our blessed lord
[4:00] hallelujah
[4:02] so
[4:03] what do we see here in the word
[4:07] we discover
[4:09] that this is jesus christ himself
[4:12] giving a description
[4:15] of himself
[4:17] in relationship
[4:20] to this last leodison
[4:23] church age
[4:25] and
[4:26] let us remember
[4:29] that the days of grace
[4:32] are winding up
[4:36] much
[4:38] or many
[4:39] persons
[4:41] have been behaving
[4:44] acting
[4:46] in such a way
[4:48] as if to say
[4:50] grace will
[4:52] never come to an end
[4:54] it will always go on
[4:57] the door will be always open
[5:00] for us
[5:02] but nay my friends that is not so
[5:05] the days of grace came to an end in in
[5:08] the times of gnaw
[5:11] when the door was shut
[5:13] amen
[5:15] the days of grace
[5:17] came to an end
[5:19] in the time of lot
[5:22] when the angel said
[5:24] flee quickly
[5:26] run to the mountains amen
[5:29] oh
[5:30] my friends we are here again
[5:33] as it was in the days of noah as it was
[5:37] in the days of lot so is it
[5:41] in these days of the coming of the son
[5:44] of man
[5:45] on the face of the earth here we are
[5:50] living in prophecy
[5:52] living and walking
[5:54] in the midst of supernatural events
[5:58] that are now being made clear to us
[6:01] by the vindication fulfillment
[6:05] of prophecy in our day
[6:07] and in our time glory to god hallelujah
[6:12] so he reveals his characteristics
[6:15] to us
[6:17] in this last church age
[6:20] remember
[6:22] he has done this
[6:24] through every age
[6:27] because the evils
[6:30] committed by every age
[6:34] he had to
[6:36] project one part of his
[6:39] personality one part of his office
[6:43] into that that age
[6:45] to rebuke to correct
[6:49] that
[6:50] spirit of satan
[6:52] that was active in that age
[6:55] so that is how he raised up a standard
[6:59] against the works of satan
[7:02] in his day and time
[7:05] in ephesus
[7:09] he made himself known as he is the one
[7:12] who holds the seven stars within his
[7:16] hands
[7:18] and smyrna
[7:20] he made the people know
[7:22] that he was the one
[7:24] that liveth
[7:26] and was dead
[7:28] making them no no man has been dead and
[7:32] then come back living
[7:34] but now he's projecting himself
[7:36] presenting himself that i am the one i'm
[7:40] the only one
[7:42] that was dead and now living
[7:46] oh praise god
[7:48] in the age of pergamos
[7:51] he presented himself
[7:54] as he that hat the sharp sword the sword
[8:00] of god's word
[8:02] hallelujah sayatira
[8:05] he that hat
[8:07] eyes like a flame of fire he sees
[8:10] everything
[8:12] he knows everything
[8:14] for he is our great eternal god
[8:18] in sardis
[8:21] the god of the seven spirits now not
[8:24] seven stars
[8:26] but the seven spirits praise god
[8:29] hallelujah same seven spirits of god
[8:32] around the throne of god same seven
[8:35] spirits now he is showing that he is the
[8:39] one he is the one that was and is
[8:42] sitting on the throne who has sovereign
[8:46] control
[8:47] over the seven spirits of god
[8:51] in the age of philadelphia
[8:54] he presents and has presented and is
[8:57] presenting himself
[8:59] i am he that holds the key of david amen
[9:04] that just doesn't mean the key to
[9:07] natural david's treasure house
[9:10] but he holds the key to all revelation
[9:14] of the riches of the grace the mercies
[9:17] the pearl of great price the mysteries
[9:20] of god the revelation of himself
[9:22] hallelujah amen praise god and now in
[9:27] the age of leodisia
[9:30] now in this age
[9:33] where
[9:34] we come to the consummation of the ages
[9:38] when the world is dying
[9:41] amen truth it seems to be dying
[9:45] everything coming to its end
[9:47] but now he presents himself
[9:51] in this distinct
[9:54] oh praise god
[9:57] presentation of himself
[9:59] saying i am the amen
[10:02] i am
[10:04] the amen
[10:06] hallelujah
[10:07] now we're giving a final look
[10:10] at our glorious lord hallelujah
[10:14] and seeing him in his
[10:16] glorious and gracious
[10:19] supreme deity to all of these seven ages
[10:25] amen
[10:26] he is the in other words he is the
[10:30] capstone
[10:31] revelation
[10:33] amen
[10:35] passion revelation done through the ages
[10:37] right on down
[10:40] come to the seventh church age
[10:43] gr more revelation but still partial
[10:47] but we now walk into the perfect day
[10:51] we walk into the dawning
[10:54] of the great day star
[10:57] hallelujah
[10:59] rising upon us
[11:01] shining his glorious light upon us
[11:05] and our eyes
[11:07] being opened
[11:08] are beginning to see
[11:11] the things of god
[11:13] making themselves clear
[11:15] and manifest thus saith the amen
[11:20] jesus christ the amen of the living god
[11:25] he is the law so let it be
[11:28] of the living god
[11:30] for the word amen and they
[11:33] that uh
[11:35] title of amen
[11:37] means i am the finality
[11:42] this is the final revelation
[11:46] of himself
[11:48] it stands for approval
[11:52] just as if your boss came and said
[11:54] amen in other words that's a good job
[11:57] it's a perfect job it's final amen
[12:02] hallelujah it stands for prevailing
[12:05] promise
[12:07] and it stands for his unchanging promise
[12:12] and it stands for
[12:14] the seal of god upon it amen hallelujah
[12:19] in other words god stamps it
[12:22] puts his seal upon it and says he
[12:25] approves
[12:26] of the
[12:27] manifestation
[12:30] of jesus christ upon the earth every
[12:33] step every word fulfill the promise of
[12:36] god
[12:37] and god sets his seal upon it perfection
[12:41] of all perfection hallelujah
[12:44] oh how sweet how beautiful to see this
[12:48] hallelujah and so this is the end time
[12:52] revelation
[12:54] of himself
[12:56] for the day of grace
[12:58] is closing
[13:00] hallelujah
[13:01] the door
[13:04] may still be open
[13:08] hallelujah
[13:09] but the spirit of noah
[13:12] in the bride
[13:14] stands in the gap
[13:16] stands in the doorway
[13:19] she's still declaring the word of god
[13:22] for the hour
[13:24] still giving an opportunity
[13:26] still giving a space
[13:29] to repent
[13:30] but now we find
[13:33] that spirit of repentance is nowhere
[13:36] upon the people
[13:37] except for the
[13:39] faithful individual few that may still
[13:43] be here on the face of the earth that
[13:46] are waiting on the coming of the living
[13:49] god in the form of the rapture
[13:52] and resurrection before we go into
[13:55] tribulation oh thanks be to god for this
[13:59] marvelous hour and day in which we are
[14:03] living in indeed he is the jehovah of
[14:07] the old testament the god
[14:11] of the amen
[14:13] he is jesus
[14:15] of the new testament
[14:17] and he is telling you i am that same
[14:19] jehovah
[14:22] i am the amen
[14:24] hallelujah
[14:26] hero israel
[14:28] the lord thy god
[14:30] is one god
[14:33] there it is
[14:34] the jehovah of the old testament
[14:38] is the same jesus
[14:40] of the new testament hallelujah one and
[14:44] the same
[14:46] you see
[14:47] the new testament
[14:50] is not
[14:52] jesus here revealing another god
[14:57] but he is the further
[15:00] revelation
[15:02] of that god
[15:04] that was in the old testament
[15:08] making himself
[15:10] a further unveiling of himself
[15:13] a further revelation of himself
[15:17] casting light upon his person
[15:20] amen and the unfolding
[15:23] revelation
[15:25] of himself glory to glory to glory then
[15:29] back to the glory but now he is making
[15:32] himself known to us as the mighty
[15:36] children amen of god hallelujah amen
[15:40] rep the further revelation
[15:43] not of two gods
[15:45] but of one and the same god hallelujah
[15:51] because
[15:52] jesus christ christ
[15:54] did not come down here to just make
[15:58] himself known
[16:00] he always pointed to the father
[16:03] so he came to make us know
[16:07] the father
[16:08] not just to know him the flesh
[16:11] but to know
[16:13] the spirit that lived in him the father
[16:16] that indwelt him for it's the father
[16:19] that living in me
[16:21] that doeth the works and he wanted us
[16:25] to know the father
[16:28] by the witness of his life that he was
[16:31] bearing to the father or praise god
[16:34] forevermore hallelujah
[16:37] amen yes sir he never talked about no
[16:41] two gods
[16:42] he only spoke of one god
[16:45] hallelujah amen and now in these last
[16:49] days he is
[16:52] re-emphasizing that to us for many
[16:57] most have traveled away
[16:59] from that original
[17:02] revelation of god
[17:05] who he is
[17:07] and are believing
[17:09] the tales
[17:11] the lies
[17:13] all the f
[17:15] fanciful
[17:16] makeups of satan
[17:19] that's here on the face of the earth
[17:21] but he has returned to make himself
[17:24] known
[17:25] himself known
[17:28] by the opening of the word of god
[17:32] hallelujah so we have come right back to
[17:35] the capstone revelation
[17:39] hallelujah
[17:40] and the most important
[17:42] revelation
[17:44] of who is the godhead
[17:47] not three persons
[17:49] in the godhead
[17:51] but one
[17:53] person
[17:54] of that godhead and that one person
[17:58] carries many offices
[18:01] but he chose to emphasize three
[18:04] father son and holy spirit
[18:07] same god
[18:09] hallelujah
[18:10] just
[18:12] characteristics
[18:14] manifestations
[18:16] that he had to perform
[18:19] to fulfill his purpose and will
[18:22] upon the face
[18:23] of the earth hallelujah did not jesus
[18:27] say i and my father are one one and the
[18:32] same person
[18:34] one
[18:34] somebody says uh
[18:37] they're one in unity they're one in
[18:40] cooperation
[18:41] and
[18:42] john taught the same thing and he said
[18:45] lord show us the father
[18:47] listen to the answer
[18:49] have i not been long with you philip
[18:52] thus does not know me
[18:56] for it he was the father
[18:59] and the father was living in the son
[19:03] which is the body
[19:04] named jesus
[19:06] the father jehovah was living in the sun
[19:11] hallelujah who was given an earthly name
[19:14] called jesus but it was the same god
[19:18] one not two not three not four not many
[19:23] amen
[19:24] there's only one god
[19:26] and his name is the lord jesus christ
[19:30] amen we know in our day which we will
[19:33] just pass that over we we are surrounded
[19:37] by many false gods
[19:40] they're even making women into gods
[19:44] elevating them
[19:46] and talking about ascensions
[19:49] and all these things contrary to the
[19:53] word of god not even found within the
[19:56] economy of the living god hallelujah
[20:00] and to
[20:01] put down what i am saying
[20:04] they will first try to dismiss a person
[20:07] like me
[20:08] or many others like me
[20:11] uh either by oh
[20:14] he doesn't have degrees he he never went
[20:17] to the seminary he never uh or she or
[20:20] whoever it is
[20:22] they will try to destroy your
[20:24] credibility not realizing you're not
[20:27] worried about things like that you're
[20:29] just here to tell the truth
[20:32] then god will establish it whether it be
[20:35] the truth or expose it if it's not the
[20:38] truth
[20:39] i am only here as many others like
[20:42] myself is to speak god's truth
[20:46] regardless of whatever effects it may
[20:50] have hallelujah we care not for the
[20:54] things of this world whether we eat have
[20:57] to eat dry bread whether we are put on
[21:00] an island all by ourselves
[21:02] oh praise god even there on the isle of
[21:05] pacques we'll write another story of
[21:09] jesus christ our lord who came from
[21:12] glory and gave his life for us and place
[21:16] his spirit in us that we might testify
[21:19] that there is only one god and his name
[21:23] is jesus christ hallelujah he is the god
[21:27] of the amen he is the god that never
[21:30] changes
[21:31] whatever he does never changes whatever
[21:35] he says
[21:36] never changes ever amen
[21:40] so let it be he is the amen i'm so glad
[21:45] i serve a god like that who never
[21:48] changes never lies is a always true to
[21:52] his word praise god hallelujah amen
[21:57] amen hallelujah amen he is saying i am
[22:01] the amen
[22:04] because we live in a changing world
[22:08] people change their words
[22:12] break their contracts
[22:14] change their promises
[22:17] amen
[22:19] change their doctrines
[22:23] that change
[22:25] medical science varying sciences
[22:29] they're improving all the time
[22:33] and they're changing their books their
[22:36] thoughts their teachings
[22:38] but this one
[22:40] he is saying i am the amen i am the
[22:44] sovereign god i do not change i do not
[22:48] lie
[22:50] my heavens and earth will pass away but
[22:53] my words and promises will never pass
[22:57] away
[22:58] hallelujah he is saying all you have
[23:01] read in the bible all i have said to you
[23:05] will never change regardless of what
[23:08] lies satan tells you or suggests in your
[23:13] thoughts in your mind or in your
[23:15] teachings or doctrines telling you this
[23:18] or that i
[23:20] am the god that change at not he is
[23:24] saying i am the amen
[23:27] hallelujah and again
[23:31] he is saying
[23:32] on the other side
[23:34] concerning the condemnations
[23:38] the convictions
[23:40] the pronunciations
[23:43] about satan
[23:44] about the false vine
[23:47] trail of the serpent
[23:49] the sins in the garden of eden
[23:52] all of these things
[23:54] his trail his end in the burning lake of
[23:58] fire
[23:59] all these things i am god are chains not
[24:03] i am the amen what he says he is saying
[24:07] the evil that i've revealed to you
[24:10] started way back in heaven
[24:13] down in the garden of eden
[24:15] and traveled down through the ages
[24:18] that evil is still with us and working
[24:20] its way
[24:22] but it will come to an end
[24:26] at the lake of fire and death and hell
[24:30] are cast
[24:31] into the lake of fire
[24:34] but they
[24:36] what i'm saying about the
[24:39] evil
[24:40] of the two vines
[24:42] the two the twins in the beginning twins
[24:45] in the end
[24:47] two vines with their branches
[24:49] intertwined
[24:50] in genesis
[24:53] religion and carnality
[24:55] true faith
[24:57] and false
[24:59] faith
[25:00] god versus satan
[25:04] lie versus the truth
[25:06] branch is intertwined
[25:08] oh
[25:09] but here we come to an ending
[25:12] where it must come to a finality and he
[25:15] says i am the amen
[25:17] i'll put an end to it
[25:20] but what i've told you
[25:23] about this invasion
[25:26] of demonic spirits
[25:29] seducing spirits
[25:31] religious spirits
[25:33] doctrines of devils
[25:36] and demons
[25:38] seated in the very branches of the tree
[25:41] of religion
[25:43] unclean spirits spirit of devils
[25:47] the spirit of the evil
[25:50] torb spirits
[25:53] frog-like spirits looking backwards
[25:55] trying to go forwards
[25:58] all of it is that just saith the lord
[26:01] for i am the amen
[26:04] hallelujah
[26:06] praise god
[26:08] saying whatever is said to you in the
[26:10] first church age it stands true forever
[26:13] through all ages
[26:16] amen praise god
[26:18] hallelujah
[26:20] finishing up in revelation
[26:22] i am the great amen
[26:26] now you can see
[26:29] why satan hates the book of genesis
[26:33] and the book of revelation
[26:35] because he can run
[26:37] but he can't hide
[26:39] he can run from the eyes
[26:42] and minds of mortals
[26:44] but the amen
[26:46] shines the brightness of the light of
[26:49] his effulgent glory upon the face of the
[26:52] earth and upon satan and his actions and
[26:55] activities
[26:56] that he is still active on this earth
[26:59] moving deceiving lying cheating charming
[27:03] doing everything that he can to distract
[27:06] this destroy deny people away from the
[27:10] truth of god and his word and his
[27:13] redemptive power amen
[27:16] hallelujah so he hates
[27:19] this book of revelation
[27:21] this book of genesis
[27:24] then he hates
[27:26] revelation in the lives

[28:59] it that's why we can go forth with
[29:01] boldness

[29:28] even if we look like we lose a skirmish
[29:31] here or a little skirmish there we know
[29:35] when we come to the end game
[29:38] we are on the winning sides and we will
[29:42] be the winner for it's already foretold
[29:46] in the very
[29:47] word of god or believer don't go by your
[29:51] feelings how you feel now or what you

[30:41] voice will hear the word but only the
[30:45] elected hallelujah
[30:48] are caught into the upper room the
[30:52] king's chamber only they with that
[30:55] revelation bathing down their soul
[30:59] hallelujah or in the amen side in other
[31:02] words he is trying to reassure us
[31:06] you're on the winning side
[31:08] no matter how dark it looks around you
[31:11] no matter how evil it seems around you
[31:15] no matter how many distractions
[31:17] around you
[31:19] remember you're on the winning side and
[31:23] i am the quarterback or the general of
[31:27] the entire team and there's none is
[31:30] going to win a battle against me who
[31:34] purpose all of this myself i who am the
[31:38] five-star general
[31:41] j-e-s-u-s
[31:44] and he's on the charge he's on the move
[31:47] he's about to wind up this battle
[31:49] hallelujah all the little scrimmages
[31:52] where some of us may be cut we may have
[31:55] been shot we may have been damaged in
[31:57] some way your credibility your person
[32:00] your life oh he is saying bear it all
[32:04] we're coming to the end of it and soon
[32:07] will be caught away into his everlasting
[32:10] eternal presence by the power of the
[32:13] living god hallelujah
[32:16] this thing said he not only the amen
[32:21] but these things said
[32:24] amen he that is faithful and true amen
[32:29] remember
[32:30] he's not only the unchanging god we have
[32:33] spoken of
[32:35] but i want you
[32:37] to understand friends
[32:41] that don't let satan
[32:44] blind you distract you or slow you down
[32:49] he's trying to give the suggestion or
[32:51] the impression
[32:53] that god was active in the days of the
[32:55] apostles and some of them back there
[32:58] but now we're coming to the end of the
[33:00] way the god who create the universe who
[33:03] saved your soul is starting to become
[33:06] impersonal
[33:08] he's starting to become
[33:10] unconcerned because after all it's
[33:13] coming to an end now so he's not paying
[33:16] attention
[33:17] to his great creation amen but god is
[33:22] not unconcerned
[33:24] god is not impersonal
[33:27] amen
[33:29] and the god we serve is not
[33:32] disinterested
[33:33] because he promised
[33:36] i will not leave you
[33:38] comfortless
[33:40] but i'll be with you
[33:42] i'll be even in you
[33:45] to the very end i'll be with you so you
[33:49] are never alone
[33:51] hallelujah and this god of the bible
[33:56] is not
[33:57] imprisoned
[33:59] in the bible pages
[34:02] and have to be freed
[34:04] or let out of the cage
[34:07] of the bible
[34:09] by theologians
[34:11] he is the word
[34:13] none can cage him
[34:15] none can keep him in a box of theology
[34:18] or teaching oh
[34:21] my the human mind so miniscule
[34:24] to the eternal god
[34:27] hallelujah who can hold him
[34:30] who can restrain him he said i have
[34:33] purpose who will withstand he will bring
[34:36] to pass every word that he has spoken
[34:40] and he never changes and he never never
[34:43] lies hallelujah friends
[34:46] we serve this great eternal spirit being
[34:51] this great jehovah god
[34:54] hallelujah
[34:56] we have never seen him with arise
[34:59] hallelujah
[35:01] but as much
[35:03] as our limited senses
[35:06] can get to know him
[35:08] from time to time we feel him
[35:11] we sense him
[35:13] his power his presence rests upon us
[35:17] and we recognize he is here with us
[35:20] every step of the way oh
[35:24] god standing in the shadows is always
[35:28] watching over his own praise god
[35:31] hallelujah as brother billy paul said
[35:36] that when the great angel of god came
[35:39] down
[35:40] and stepped into that hotel room and
[35:44] brother branham said billy
[35:47] uh just stay where you are
[35:50] don't move i'll ask him
[35:54] if he will allow you
[35:56] to see him
[35:58] and
[35:59] he went over
[36:01] spoke to the angel
[36:03] and the angel of god says yes
[36:07] amen
[36:08] and billy paul
[36:10] branham himself will testify
[36:13] that when he looked
[36:15] all he saw
[36:17] was a man standing there
[36:21] by the drapes that were in the room
[36:24] all blessed be the name of the living
[36:28] god whom we serve
[36:30] god is concerned over us
[36:33] he may be standing near the drapes he
[36:35] may be standing in the shadows but
[36:38] remember
[36:39] there's a great eye
[36:42] always watching over us
[36:45] and seeing everything that is taking
[36:48] place for he remains the eternal god
[36:53] hallelujah
[36:54] one day
[36:55] we will see him face to face
[36:59] and tell the story saved by grace
[37:02] we'll see him in the flesh
[37:05] making himself known to us
[37:08] that is for this age
[37:12] this seventh
[37:14] age of the edition
[37:17] that we are coming to an end of
[37:21] and it has ended
[37:24] and we know at the end of this age
[37:28] he makes himself known
[37:31] hallelujah
[37:32] in the brightness of his unfolding word
[37:36] and we know him
[37:38] and then he comes
[37:40] personally
[37:42] on the scenes
[37:44] oh
[37:45] then partial revelation
[37:47] this way
[37:48] to perfect
[37:50] realization
[37:52] glory to god complete
[37:55] realization amen hallelujah then we
[37:59] begin to understand
[38:01] that we have been looking through the
[38:04] glass of the word
[38:06] darkly amen
[38:08] seeing things but not seeing them
[38:11] clearly
[38:13] through seven church ages
[38:15] of presuming of wondering about this or
[38:19] that
[38:19] but now as we come to the closing of the
[38:23] doors of grace
[38:25] amen he is making himself clear to his
[38:29] beloved his one bride his people his
[38:33] children his many member body he is
[38:36] making himself clear and plain to her
[38:40] amen i'm so glad
[38:43] that we stand here in the glory of his
[38:46] word but we will see him in his great
[38:50] eternal
[38:51] wondrous glory and we shall be like him
[38:56] when we begin to see
[38:59] as he is this wonderful jesus our savior
[39:04] divine the mighty everlasting one that
[39:08] lives and reigns supreme and have some
[39:12] preeminence over his own house
[39:15] for he lives in us
[39:18] and he is he's the great son
[39:21] over his own house
[39:23] making himself manifest for the glory of
[39:26] god and we are complete in him and one
[39:30] day
[39:32] he will change the atoms of our bodies
[39:36] hallelujah
[39:37] amen and we will
[39:40] change or be transformed
[39:42] from mortal to immortality
[39:46] praise his name and be swallowed up
[39:50] in his life by his life followed up
[39:53] by the very revelation you have been
[39:56] being you have been believing
[40:00] hallelujah
[40:01] oh my then shall we as paul said then

[40:09] words you'll enter into perfect
[40:12] realization perfection of perfection of
[40:15] perfection hallelujah he is the faithful
[40:21] but listen the emphasis and true
[40:24] witness

[40:28] us
[40:30] are true
[40:33] you know the word witness and the word
[40:35] martyr

[40:46] were martyrs

[40:57] person a martyr they don't know who or
[41:00] what a true martyr is
[41:02] but this true martyr jesus christ he
[41:06] bore witness in his walk
[41:09] he bore witness
[41:11] by laying down his life
[41:14] and the very life he lived
[41:17] is the witness
[41:19] and proof
[41:21] of the truth
[41:22] and the fact that the holy spirit
[41:26] has returned upon the face of the earth
[41:29] is the very proof
[41:31] that his
[41:33] his the lamb of god jesus christ
[41:36] that sacrifice of the lamb
[41:39] was acceptable to god
[41:41] that is the reason why his life could
[41:45] come back on the sinner that's on the
[41:47] face of the earth come his life can come
[41:50] back in the form of the holy spirit on
[41:52] the sinner that's on the face of the
