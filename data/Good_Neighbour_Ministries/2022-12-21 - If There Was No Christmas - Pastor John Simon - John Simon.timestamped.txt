[18:51] to you tonight
[18:53] on the subject of if there was no
[18:57] Christmas
[18:59] and uh if we are to look into Matthew
[19:03] chapter 2
[19:05] verses 13 to 15 we may read that

[19:22] uh into next week
[19:28] let's read this together
[19:32] and when they were Departed
[19:36] behold the angel of the Lord appeared to
[19:42] Joseph in a dream
[19:44] saying arise
[19:47] and take the young child and his mother
[19:51] and flee into Egypt
[19:54] and be thou there until I bring thee
[19:59] word for Herod
[20:02] will seek the young child to destroy him
[20:08] when he arose he took the young child
[20:11] and his mother by night
[20:14] and departed into Egypt
[20:17] and was there until the death of Herod
[20:22] that it might be fulfilled which was
[20:25] spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying
[20:29] out of Egypt have I called my son praise
[20:35] God let us pray and we'll just talk for
[20:40] a little while and commune with each
[20:43] other and with God our gracious Heavenly
[20:46] Father we are a wonderful blessed people

[20:56] presence
[20:58] we are receptacles of your grace
[21:03] I know I I stand here not by chance
[21:08] but I stand Here by the will and plan
[21:11] and purpose of God
[21:13] for somebody somewhere either locally
[21:18] here or across they they wins The Winds
[21:23] of God out there in the internet
[21:26] to hear what's going to be said
[21:30] and father you will bear witness of it
[21:33] you will strike the cords that are
[21:36] necessary you will pull the strings of
[21:40] great one that will speak to us tonight
[21:44] Lord and may the spirit of Christ Lord
[21:48] break the shackles across our hearts and
[21:51] Minds take away weary take away
[21:55] stuffiness take away every devil no
[21:59] praise Spirit no praise devil that will
[22:04] block the minds the hearts the thoughts
[22:06] and the voices of your people father
[22:09] Lift us up father May the Holy Spirit
[22:12] father minister to us everyone and may
[22:16] you receive the glory and the honor of
[22:19] this blessed Christmas Time To Thee be
[22:23] the glory in Jesus name hallelujah
[22:26] praise God please be seated
[22:31] today
[22:34] now uh do you know that Christmas is a
[22:38] wonderful time how many knows that
[22:40] but mainly uh in this modern time
[22:45] Christianity a Satan has made them do
[22:48] that actually has tried his project
[22:51] Christian uh Christmas as a time for
[22:56] children
[22:58] and forgiving gifts to Children you
[23:01] might not have really noticed it but
[23:03] that's how he switched it that people's
[23:06] thoughts should go to the children and
[23:09] loving the children making sure the
[23:11] children have gifts and stuff like that
[23:15] and while doing that is blinding the
[23:19] people to the fact that Christmas is
[23:23] really for adults
[23:26] it's really for uh mature people
[23:31] just like with baptism sometimes a child
[23:35] uh may be too small
[23:38] without understanding they don't know
[23:42] what they're doing before you go baptize
[23:45] them
[23:46] of course some are exceptional where God
[23:49] will reveal to them even while they're
[23:51] tiny like Jesus or even younger amen but
[23:55] the fact is he has switched the price
[23:58] tags
[23:59] and cause people to believe that
[24:03] Christmas is for adults it's for
[24:05] children sorry amen yes but you see
[24:11] really it's for adults to be able to
[24:14] teach their children about what real
[24:17] Christmas is
[24:19] and that's what it is but he's taken
[24:23] them away from that towards giving up
[24:26] Gibson and and focusing on the children
[24:29] and and stuff of that nature which I'm
[24:32] not saying that that is bad I'm just
[24:35] using that to show you how we switch the
[24:38] thoughts and switch the focus on the
[24:42] children and the guests they can receive
[24:45] and be given
[24:46] rather than upon the adults
[24:50] and that they should be teaching their
[24:53] children what real Christmas is
[24:56] but how can they when most of the people
[24:59] in the world today don't really know
[25:03] what really a Christmas is about you see
[25:08] you see now we understand that real
[25:11] Christmas is simply put is the birthday
[25:15] of the s o n of God
[25:19] when God became flesh
[25:22] when God created the body for himself to
[25:25] inhabit
[25:26] when God and morphed himself from
[25:29] Melchizedek to a man
[25:32] when God was able to make that body it
[25:36] was his only begotten son
[25:40] it was the only body that he made like
[25:43] that to fully Express and unveil himself
[25:47] to the human race
[25:49] and so God and Christ amen expressing
[25:54] all the virtues you see behind us
[25:56] letting the world understand what these
[26:00] virtues are all about
[26:03] no none knew what real love was none
[26:07] knew what real brotherly kindness was
[26:10] they didn't know what these things were
[26:13] but Jesus came and expressed them God
[26:18] expressed them through him to the world
[26:20] that they might recognize what was
[26:23] happening amen now we know that Jesus if
[26:29] adults were to teach their children
[26:32] was not born on the 25th of December
[26:37] of course it wasn't even December we
[26:41] were on the hills and the mountains and
[26:45] it was cold
[26:46] but there was no snow but it was cold
[26:49] and they say you'll get snow but you'll
[26:51] get it on the top of Mount Hermon which
[26:54] is one of their highest mountains but
[26:58] other than that there is none of this
[27:00] fictitious stuff that they tell the
[27:02] people the snow lying on the ground and
[27:05] and the angel and the the Shepherds
[27:08] there with their sheep no such a thing
[27:11] that wasn't like that absolutely not and
[27:15] so we know he was not born in December
[27:21] he was not because he was God's lamb
[27:26] and he was to be the Lamb of God to take
[27:30] away the sins of the world
[27:33] and as such we know Lambs are not born
[27:36] in the middle of winter
[27:38] Lambs are usually born in the spring
[27:41] that is to say they are born
[27:45] let me see April May April you know
[27:49] around that time March April May around
[27:53] that time is when Lambs are usually born
[27:56] amen so we know that he was born in that
[27:59] time then we also found that he was not
[28:03] born in a house
[28:05] but he was born in a rotten stinking
[28:09] Barn
[28:10] that had swaddling clothes
[28:13] oh my god when we think of it that we
[28:17] are the born today and once again he is
[28:20] born again in US
[28:22] we who are covered with the filth of sin
[28:25] the corruption of the world and the
[28:27] systems of the world but thank God by
[28:30] his grace he has cleansed their soul he
[28:34] has washed Us in the blood he has
[28:36] brought us back to himself and we are
[28:39] here thanking God for a wonderful real
[28:42] Christmas because we understand and know
[28:45] what it is
[28:47] yes
[28:49] he was not born in a house
[28:52] but he was born in a barn
[28:55] like most Lambs would be
[28:59] and like most Lambs they'll take them to
[29:04] the slaughterhouse
[29:05] and uh I read somewhere brother Branham
[29:09] said usually in the old days they will
[29:12] take a goat
[29:14] to lead that lamb
[29:16] the Lambs or the Sheep to the slaughter
[29:20] but they go usually have a lot of
[29:23] intellectuals
[29:25] so when he gets to the slaughter he
[29:29] leads them in then he runs back out
[29:31] yeah or he says oh he jumps over the
[29:34] wall and leave them in there all to be
[29:37] slaughtered right well even so we see
[29:40] the goat in the Bible Judas brought him
[29:44] and gave him right over to the
[29:46] authorities so that he could be like a
[29:50] lamb's led to slaughter
[29:53] and the Bible says as a lamb he opened
[29:57] not his mouth
[29:58] and you know lambs and sheep even though
[30:01] you're taking them to the slaughterhouse
[30:03] they're not like goats they don't scream
[30:07] and jump and kick and fight them no
[30:10] they're just quietly go to the slaughter
[30:14] amen and like a lamb he was led to the
[30:19] slaughter amen praise God so there he
[30:24] was as one old song says they were
[30:28] walking my Lord up calvary's hill then
[30:32] led him brother to God
[30:34] and there they slayed him it's fresh to
[30:38] me because we were there oh praise God
[30:42] and it's not like the show on a hill
[30:45] where there's no body but it was the the
[30:48] Romans deliberately crucified people at
[30:53] a busy intersection where they want to
[30:56] make that Criminal an example so that
[31:00] others would fear them and what they
[31:04] were doing so that God got this hill is
[31:08] a intersection where even now it is
[31:11] where there are lots of people passing
[31:13] all the time right and they let him up
[31:16] that rugged Hill to die up there amen
[31:22] now we won't go through the entire
[31:24] history
[31:25] but later
[31:33] oh I just heard the music some music
[31:36] play now uh they later we know that
[31:42] Christianity
[31:44] got married
[31:46] it got married into paganism
[31:50] married right into romanism
[31:54] right at the nician council
[31:57] and there we find out
[32:01] that
[32:03] Christians who married who served and
[32:06] worshiped the true and living God
[32:11] got married to romanism
[32:15] we will worship idols
[32:18] they were ranked pagans
[32:21] they were rank worshipers of idols
[32:26] and they worshiped the sun god
[32:30] as I've said before even to this day in
[32:34] their major Cathedrals and places of
[32:37] worship back of the altars is a big
[32:42] circular uh uh sunburst
[32:46] that is uh evidence of the ancient Pagan
[32:52] beliefs mingled mixed and fused into
[32:56] Christianity and brought down through
[32:59] hundreds of years until the present time
[33:03] and they say nothing about it but it's
[33:07] there impacting the people's minds and
[33:10] hearts and they are worshiping you know
[33:13] the devil not knowing what they worship
[33:18] amen yes sir and so we find out this is
[33:24] where they came to the time in the
[33:28] historical records if you want to seek
[33:31] and search to find them really that the
[33:34] Romans before Christianity were
[33:37] worshiping the sun god
[33:39] they were celebrating the birthday of
[33:43] the s-u-n god
[33:46] bowing down to him and worshiping him in
[33:51] every uh way possible
[33:54] and they did that usually from the 21st
[33:59] of December
[34:00] to the 25th of December described by
[34:04] them as the winter solstice
[34:07] and that's the time when they worship
[34:10] the sun god
[34:12] because after the 25th the the length of
[34:16] days begin to change because the sun is
[34:19] coming back and uh and they look at that
[34:23] like their God uh died in the winter and
[34:27] is resurrecting now and so they worship
[34:30] Him and they have a great time of
[34:34] rejoicing rejoicing amen now when this
[34:40] time came for the worship
[34:44] the Christians now
[34:46] who were there at the time now I
[34:49] remember I tell you that the two got
[34:52] fused together until you kept hardly
[34:56] let's say they fuse together they marry
[34:58] together whatever term but the the uh
[35:02] implication is that you can't hardly
[35:04] discern the difference between because
[35:08] it's got so mixed in and mixed up to
[35:11] this very day
[35:13] right to this very day and while the
[35:16] Christians were worshiping God they s o
[35:21] n of God and given glory to his name
[35:26] the Romans were worshiping the s-u-n of
[35:32] God on the same day and the same time
[35:36] amen now while there were one worship
[35:41] by having a Roman bacchanal
[35:44] and that is a real word that is not
[35:47] something made up by somebody you can
[35:50] look in any one of the dictionaries or
[35:53] as like a pictures that will bring up
[35:55] the word and tell you you say well
[35:57] brother Simon they will have in the back
[35:58] and all what you mean it means at the
[36:01] time when they are worshiping this God
[36:06] they were having a moon riotous drunken
[36:12] uh a party Anything Goes
[36:16] everything it was just a rotten mess
[36:19] that they were having together there at
[36:23] that time
[36:24] and contrary to them the Christians
[36:28] there were worshiping the s o n of God
[36:33] and it was a sacred time for them
[36:36] there were worshiping and giving glory
[36:39] to God while the other side was
[36:43] worshiping the Sun God and using Bacchus
[36:47] wine women music singing Harps flutes
[36:52] everything else jumping around pulling
[36:56] at each other's clothing
[36:58] falling drunk all night together mingled
[37:03] together or it was just one rotten mess
[37:06] and that's what was there so-called
[37:09] Christmas or worship of their s-u-m God
[37:13] but the Christians were worshiping the
[37:16] Son of God and for them Christmas was a
[37:20] sacred time
[37:22] Christmas was a time of Thanksgiving to
[37:25] God
[37:26] because they knew what he did for them
[37:28] blessed be the name of the Lord God
[37:31] hallelujah oh my friends
[37:34] right now while I'm speaking on this
[37:38] subject the whole world is in
[37:42] preparation they don't know that that's
[37:45] what it is but it's an another Roman
[37:49] back and all that has now gone worldwide
[37:53] Universal it's no more just in one
[37:56] little area but it's now all over the
[37:59] world that their uh view of what
[38:04] Christmas is has dominated the hearts
[38:08] and minds of the people
[38:10] oh my and what can we look out there
[38:13] without Christ
[38:16] without god without his knowledge what
[38:20] nominal Christianity with all of that
[38:23] all it is is a swill a pig swell of wine
[38:28] women sung and all manner of corruption
[38:33] on every hand from Office parties write
[38:36] down my friends it's there everywhere
[38:40] but in the middle of that we are asked
[38:42] to hold to God's unchanging hands
[38:46] we are asked to hold for our original
[38:49] faith Faith of Our Father's living still
[38:53] in spite of dungeon fire and sword they
[38:57] can't take it out of us they can't boil
[38:59] it out of us they can't burn it out of
[39:02] us we will not Bend we will not bow we
[39:04] will not burn but we'll stand for Jesus
[39:07] Christ by the word of God hallelujah
[39:10] amen yes sir praise God I tell you while
[39:15] the world is preparing for this back and
[39:18] all that they call Christmas amen right
[39:22] now I want to tell you that to us real
[39:25] the real Christmas is not a pagan
[39:28] celebration
[39:30] the real Christmas is not a pagan
[39:33] celebration to us it's a sacred time
[39:37] it's a sacred hour yes
[39:40] we eat we drink we Rejoice but our
[39:45] reason for that is totally opposite to
[39:49] what they're doing
[39:51] absolutely totally different praise the
[39:55] Lord because we ought to be glad that
[39:57] Jesus was born
[39:58] we have to be glad that he came for us
[40:01] praise God hallelujah oh my so we
[40:05] worshiped him at Christmas time with
[40:09] thankfulness in our hearts and taking it
[40:12] as a sacred hour because if there was no
[40:17] Christmas just think of it if there was
[40:21] no real
[40:23] Christmas of Christ on this face of this
[40:27] Earth it will be one great big Devil's
[40:31] back and all going on that's why Jesus
[40:34] said you are the salt of the earth
[40:37] you are the ones that calling back the
[40:40] words of sin
[40:42] when he that let it will let you know
[40:45] the Greeks as when he who is now here in
[40:48] the ring stops in the ring
[40:51] then we are taken out of the way then
[40:54] will the man of sin be revealed then the
[40:58] evil will come right open and expose and
[41:01] manifest to the people amen yes sir but
[41:05] if there was no Christmas
[41:07] no sacrificial lamb named Jesus could
[41:11] have been born
[41:13] but thank God
[41:15] there is real Christmas
[41:17] where Jesus Christ the sacrificial lamb
[41:21] was able to be born
[41:22] Jesus Christ The Substitute lamb now
[41:27] they right now in Israel they're looking
[41:29] for the red heifer as you find in uh
[41:33] Exodus and Deuteronomy and those books
[41:36] you will find there looking for the
[41:38] coming of the red heifer so they can
[41:41] have their sacrifice but we have
[41:43] received our substitute already
[41:46] and his name is Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[41:50] he took my place at Calvary he took your
[41:54] place at Calvary and when he was on the
[41:57] cross we were on his mind oh praise God
[42:00] hallelujah I'm so thankful here today
[42:03] tonight while I'm speaking with you amen
[42:07] if he was not born then we would have no
[42:11] sacrificial lamb also we would have
[42:15] never known what is Grace
[42:19] we would not know anything about Grace
[42:22] because the age of Grace only came in
[42:25] when he came and died then Grace began
[42:30] Hallelujah that is to receive a gift
[42:33] that is unmerited you're not you you
[42:37] want something you did to receive it
[42:40] it's not money you're paying to get it
[42:42] but there's a gift that was given to you
[42:45] amen and I thank God the gift he gave to
[42:49] us is the seed of life with the gift of
[42:52] God is eternal life through Jesus Christ
[42:55] Our Lord that's the gift that we have
[42:57] all received all praise God forevermore
[43:00] glory to God we will never known what is
[43:03] Grace
[43:04] Hallelujah even to this day many people
[43:07] don't know what is Grace you try to give
[43:09] them something why are you giving me
[43:11] what's the reason for that and they're
[43:14] getting because they don't know what
[43:16] Grace is that somebody can give
[43:19] something without a motive of getting
[43:22] back anything you just give it from the
[43:25] fullness of your heart and he did it
[43:27] because he loved us
[43:29] and gave his life for us praise God we
[43:33] would not if there was no real Christmas
[43:36] we would not know what is love what is
[43:40] redeeming love we would have no idea of
[43:43] it there was no such a thing before
[43:45] Jesus came on the earth it was just
[43:48] killing lambs and Rams and Bullocks and
[43:51] goats and burning up words and and stuff
[43:54] of that nature oh my but he the word
[43:57] came on the scene and made sense of all
[44:01] of it praise God and presented himself
[44:03] and died for our sins and let us know
[44:07] what the love of God is amen who praise
[44:10] God if there is was no Christmas
[44:15] if there was no lamb born there would be
[44:18] no Calvary
[44:20] there would be no man that could go
[44:23] with such perfection without spot
[44:27] without blemish to climb doubt God God
[44:31] is healed to die for our sins and to
[44:35] take on the accumulation of the sins of
[44:39] the world but the Bible says he took our
[44:43] sins upon us and he became poor that we
[44:47] might become rich
[44:48] oh praise God I'm so thankful in my
[44:52] heart today amen I give him glory every
[44:55] day of life without this real Christmas
[45:00] there could be no crucifixion
[45:03] because there will be nothing to crucify
[45:06] but thank God there's a real Chris
[45:09] Christmas whenever you know that you see
[45:12] a false or a counterfeit there's a real
[45:15] somewhere amen and there's a real
[45:19] Christmas that one that they are
[45:21] celebrating out there is it's the
[45:24] intention of the master Puppeteer behind
[45:28] all of that is the blind to distract and
[45:33] delude the people away from the reality
[45:37] of the word of God and the power of the
[45:40] holy spirit amen to save them from their
[45:43] sins glory be to God Amen oh my imaginal
[45:49] world
[45:50] with no real Christmas
[45:52] amen no real Christmas having no hope of
[45:59] peace on Earth and Good Will towards man
[46:02] you say well what are you talking about
[46:04] we don't have peace on Earth now and we
[46:06] don't have a good will towards men but
[46:09] the Bible tells us that one day
[46:12] when all whether Brandon made it plain
[46:15] he says every one of the isms are going
[46:18] to pass whether this socialism fascism
[46:21] whatever they're all gonna pass away and
[46:23] die even capitalism will pass amen he
[46:27] said they'll try every form of
[46:28] government from this to that to the
[46:31] other and it'll pass away and everyone
[46:34] he said will fail
[46:37] amen but Jesus is coming the Prince of
[46:41] Peace is coming he is the is the only
[46:44] one can bring peace on the face of the
[46:47] earth oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[46:49] just the other night I gave you the
[46:52] quotation where the Prophet said the
[46:55] reason why we are having all this
[46:57] destruction on the Earth all of this
[47:00] murder killing War he said because the
[47:04] destroying Angel is now loosed
[47:09] and he is inspiring these men to make
[47:12] these weapons a war and to use them to
[47:16] be able to kill not one not two not ten
[47:19] not a hundred not a thousand millions of
[47:22] people being killed like that because
[47:26] the destroying Angel but the Prince of
[47:29] Peace is coming Hallelujah and he has to
[47:33] say peace be still amen and calm the
[47:36] storms of life and everything will come
[47:39] back into his will for the Bible said
[47:42] he'll rule with a rod of iron amen have
[47:45] complete control but now it's a king
[47:49] with love it's a king with not
[47:52] corruption a king with love with honesty
[47:55] with every quality and character that
[47:59] you think a leader and a king should
[48:01] have amen praise God and that's what we
[48:04] are looking for and we have this hope in
[48:07] us that we will have the peace of God in
[48:11] our hearts and in our lives I took that
[48:13] tonight
[48:15] amen oh my
[48:18] if there was no Christmas there would be
[48:21] no hereafter
[48:23] we will all die and stay right here and
[48:26] that would be the end
[48:27] because there would be no none to save
[48:30] us out of Satan's prison
[48:34] but thank God one came and went down
[48:37] into Satan's pits and preached to the
[48:40] spirits that were imprisoned there amen
[48:43] and uh loose them freed them out of
[48:46] there praise God and I'm glad he freed
[48:49] me out of the systems
[48:51] all the iron bars of the beliefs you had
[48:55] in your mind contrary to the word of God
[48:57] the spirit of Christ by the word tore
[49:00] them away amen I'm glad we have a Samson
[49:03] today nothing can stand before him he
[49:06] said there in my hand and none can take
[49:09] them out of the palm of my head and
[49:11] you'll tear that roaring lion apart just
[49:14] like he did back there he'll tear the
[49:17] devil into pieces to bring out his bride
[49:19] bring out his children in the freedom
[49:22] the liberty of the Sons and Daughters of
[49:24] the Living God hallelujah amen so we
[49:28] have faith Paul said if the if Christ
[49:31] did not die if he didn't die for our
[49:34] sins then we are of men or most
[49:37] miserable we got nothing to stand on we
[49:41] got no heaven we got no hope we got
[49:43] nothing but thank God he he was born

[51:01] they're light to lit up everywhere and
[51:04] everything else like that thank God but
[51:07] they don't know just by putting up the
[51:09] Christmas lights they are proving
[51:12] without us preaching that uh there can
[51:15] be light in the midst of Darkness

[55:31] and got warmer I'm warm on warmer
[55:36] and the man took off his coat of his own
[55:40] self right and the son did not that not
[55:44] with a lot of noise and caring on but
[55:47] with the Quiet heat of the fire of God

[55:57] of God that the people cast off all
[56:00] their you you when you read of bartim

[56:17] mine I hope you've thrown away yours and

[1:03:58] thing together until saying things like
[1:04:02] this say what are you really talking
[1:04:04] about we are happy that Jesus died but
[1:04:07] it's no Revelation back of that it's

[1:05:02] and we was born in Bethlehem praise the
[1:05:06] Lord and that's so fresh that he was
[1:05:09] born there and that says in the Book of
[1:05:12] Psalms this man it shall be said this
[1:05:15] man was born there oh my thanks be to
[1:05:19] God he was born there but two thousand
[1:05:22] years ago but thanks be to God we can
[1:05:26] see him alive once more in our midst
[1:05:29] rejected
[1:05:32] he was despised
[1:05:35] and then as you know they killed him
[1:05:38] but the grave could not hold him it
[1:05:41] could not hold him and now he's coming
[1:05:44] again to have with us
[1:05:46] the real Christmas celebration
[1:05:50] and that celebration is going to be in
[1:05:53] our home beyond the skies

[1:05:59] and if the right use this thought
[1:06:02] at Christmas time
[1:06:04] is a time where of uniting family
[1:06:09] and friends and Neighbors
[1:06:12] I've known where neighbors have been at
[1:06:15] the you know fighting all year and when
[1:06:19] it comes down to Christmas time there is
[1:06:21] just a spirit of atmosphere that comes
[1:06:24] that causes people to want to make up
[1:06:28] to make things right uh to confess me
[1:06:33] wrong
[1:06:35] um to give in right like that to bring
[1:06:38] about some kind of unity and you know
[1:06:43] Christmas time is a time when families
[1:06:47] no matter how far they're scattered
[1:06:49] across the world right now the airlines
[1:06:53] are overburdened with Travelers
[1:06:57] and as Christmas Day becomes closer they
[1:07:00] won't be able to carry all those people
[1:07:02] because people wanting to get back with
[1:07:06] their family and to your night together
[1:07:08] and to Rejoice together because it's
[1:07:11] Christmas time going on like that but
[1:07:15] you see they have that feeling because
[1:07:18] it was God's family that was scattered
[1:07:22] it was God's genes that were scattered
[1:07:26] through the times and the ages
[1:07:30] amen and the Nations that scattered
[1:07:34] through every time and age coming down
[1:07:37] from the beginning to now amen and you

[1:07:45] whole thing is about to be winding up
[1:07:48] ready for the scattered children to
[1:07:52] start having that feeling that desire to
[1:07:54] travel back home to come back together
[1:07:57] come in unity and walk in the word of
[1:08:01] the Living God hallelujah amen praise
[1:08:04] God look people right now are trying to
[1:08:07] get back home with their natural family
[1:08:10] and then don't care what the cost they
[1:08:13] have to pay they don't care what price
[1:08:15] they have to pay they don't care what
[1:08:18] distance they have to go they don't care
[1:08:20] about the trials they have to go through
[1:08:23] they don't care about the patience and
[1:08:26] waiting for to get an explained they
[1:08:28] don't care about that they want to get
[1:08:31] home to celebrate Christmas with their
[1:08:35] family and thanks be to God we want to
[1:08:39] celebrate the real Christmas when
[1:08:41] together we are united together and won
