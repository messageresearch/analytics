[0:03] [Music]
[0:17] welcome to the house of god
[0:20] it's good to be here this evening
[0:24] as we looked into god's
[0:27] unchanging and invaluable word
[0:32] found in the book of revelation
[0:35] chapter 1. i'm reading from
[0:39] revelation 1 verses 10 to 12.
[0:46] i was in the spirit on the lord's day
[0:51] and i heard a voice behind me
[0:55] a great voice as of a trumpet
[1:00] saying i am alpha
[1:03] and omega the first and the last
[1:08] and what thou seest write
[1:11] in a book and send it
[1:15] unto the seven churches which
[1:18] are in asia onto ephesus
[1:22] onto smyrna and onto pergamos
[1:26] and onto thyatira and onto sardis
[1:30] and on to philadelphia and onto
[1:34] laodicea and i
[1:37] turned to see the voice that spake with
[1:41] me
[1:42] and being turned i saw
[1:46] seven golden candle sticks
[1:51] our gracious heavenly father
[1:54] we thank you so much that you
[1:58] gave us your unchanging word
[2:02] may the great holy spirit now bring the
[2:06] word to life
[2:08] as we look into this perfect law
[2:11] of liberty and out of it may you receive
[2:15] all your glory and all your praise for
[2:18] we surrender ourselves to thee
[2:20] for service in the name of our lord
[2:24] jesus christ
[2:26] amen and amen
[2:29] the topic tonight is
[2:32] the voice like a trumpet
[2:37] john heard behind him
[2:40] in the vision a voice
[2:44] behind him sounding like
[2:47] a trumpet us astentorian
[2:50] voice for he was in the spirit
[2:54] and when you start in the spirit you
[2:57] hear
[2:57] the things of god you see the things of
[3:01] god
[3:02] and what a an experience it is
[3:05] also for he was transported
[3:09] into that wonderful great day of the
[3:13] lord
[3:14] and there he was in the presence of god
[3:18] with the future uh about to
[3:21] unfold before his very
[3:25] eyes now god while he was in the spirit
[3:30] and that's the place
[3:31] all of us should be is in the spirit
[3:35] and then god was able
[3:38] to teach john teach him
[3:42] thanks be to god isn't that the place we
[3:46] all
[3:47] should be in what a place how
[3:50] we need in this hour the
[3:53] teaching of the holy spirit himself
[3:58] god himself coming to interpret
[4:01] his own word to the believer oh
[4:04] what a comfort what a strength what an
[4:08] encouragement when we we know that the
[4:11] children of
[4:12] god in that day will be taught
[4:15] of the lord himself and are being taught
[4:19] of the lord now it says that
[4:22] john heard a voice
[4:27] did not say it was a trumpet
[4:30] but that voice sounded like
[4:34] a trumpet now if
[4:37] it was like a trumpet we know
[4:40] that when ever a trumpet is blown
[4:44] it denotes urgency
[4:47] it's a call to attention
[4:51] it's heraldry like a
[4:54] herald goes before the coming
[4:57] of the king and says clear the way
[5:01] make his path straight the king is
[5:04] coming
[5:05] the king is coming let everyone pay
[5:09] attention
[5:10] because the king is coming i'm so
[5:13] happy that in our day god has sent
[5:16] a herald according to malachi chapter 4
[5:20] verse 5 to clear the way
[5:23] all the uh the baggages out clear the
[5:27] high places out make the low places
[5:30] plain and straight carry away all the
[5:34] things that were contrary to god
[5:37] that our eyes may be open that we may
[5:40] welcome the coming of our beloved the
[5:43] coming of the lord
[5:45] jesus christ how happy we ought to be
[5:48] at the return of this blessed king so
[5:52] the trumpet sounds
[5:53] urgency the trumpet sounds the
[5:56] heraldry of the worst messenger
[6:00] and the word of god and also
[6:03] i want to make note of israel the nation
[6:07] of israel
[6:09] their affinity to trumpets
[6:13] for in the bible we know they are they
[6:15] have
[6:16] their silver trumpets blown by the
[6:19] prince
[6:20] we know brother sister that in the last
[6:23] day
[6:24] as time begins to blend back into
[6:27] eternity
[6:28] that they will be partaking fully
[6:32] of the feasts of the trumpet feast of
[6:35] atonement
[6:36] oh what a great time when they will be
[6:40] come
[6:40] back to a place to recognize their
[6:43] messiah
[6:44] and enter into their atonement
[6:48] by the very word of god that
[6:52] renewed and brought us to our atonement
[6:55] that very word which to us
[6:59] takes us to the wedding supper of the
[7:02] lamb
[7:03] and we are feasting upon that word
[7:06] now a seven course meal
[7:09] served by the hand of jesus christ
[7:12] himself through the ministry of his
[7:15] messenger
[7:16] all glory be to god hallelujah
[7:19] but to us it's the seventh seals reveal
[7:23] revealing what christ is the mystery
[7:26] of god revealed now to them it
[7:30] will be the feast of the of the trumpets
[7:34] out of the feast of the trumpets will
[7:37] unfold to them the marvelous
[7:40] revelation of jesus christ the
[7:43] jehovahness
[7:45] of jesus that the jesus
[7:48] the jehovah of the old testament
[7:51] is that jesus of the new testament
[7:56] and it will place their faith
[7:59] in this messiah whom a fourth time
[8:02] they had rejected but now because
[8:06] god says there's a time for everything
[8:09] there is a
[8:10] season for everything and in the
[8:12] fullness of time
[8:14] god sends both his son so in the
[8:17] fullness
[8:18] of their time god will break
[8:21] the scales from off their eyes
[8:24] as he did in typical form on paul
[8:28] a song and take the scale off of their
[8:31] eyes
[8:32] the veil will be lifted and they will be
[8:35] able to say i can see clearly now the
[8:38] gloom is gone
[8:39] the clouds are gone the fog is gone
[8:42] all of the distractions are gone and
[8:45] when they look
[8:46] they will see only jesus only
[8:50] jesus why for only jesus
[8:53] can satisfy their longing
[8:56] and their expectations and their
[8:59] waiting and their suffering right
[9:02] through the holocaust and many
[9:05] other tragedies and trials and
[9:08] tribulations
[9:09] through which they have come as a nation
[9:13] but there will that will all come to its
[9:16] culmination when they enter
[9:19] into the great revelation of jesus
[9:23] christ their messiah their lord
[9:26] their master and their soon-coming
[9:30] king who is also the king of
[9:33] all kings and the lord of lords for the
[9:36] kingdom of this
[9:37] war kingdoms of this world will become
[9:40] the kingdom
[9:41] of all lord and of his christ thanks be
[9:44] to god hallelujah
[9:46] amen amen so hearing this voice
[9:50] behind him this voice of
[9:54] urgency this voice proclaiming
[9:58] the coming of the king amen
[10:01] trumpets also symbolize
[10:05] when israel heard a trumpet it means
[10:08] it's time to assemble
[10:10] it's time for the the tribes to assemble
[10:13] whether it's around the tabernacle or
[10:15] whether it was around
[10:17] moses or the high priest when those
[10:20] trumpets
[10:21] sounded it was a sign for them to
[10:24] assemble
[10:25] and when the gentiles hear the trumpet
[10:28] voice
[10:28] of the holy spirit speaking through a
[10:31] prophetic ministry in this hour
[10:34] it's a time to assemble it's the time
[10:37] for
[10:37] oneness it's a time to return back
[10:41] for it's the jubilee trumpet for the
[10:43] gentiles
[10:44] and they hear the blowing of the
[10:47] trumpets of liberty
[10:48] they hear the blowing of the trumpets
[10:51] and
[10:52] knowing their hearts that even though
[10:54] the devil held them
[10:56] captive made them prisoners to himself
[11:00] it is time for them to walk out of their
[11:03] prison doors
[11:04] and walk out of their habits walk out of
[11:06] their sins trials and tribulations
[11:09] and walk into the glorious freedom of
[11:12] the lord
[11:12] and savior jesus christ hallelujah
[11:16] the voice like a trumpet is also a
[11:19] call to worship oh praise god for this
[11:23] last day called to worship to worship
[11:27] him in
[11:28] spirit and in truth not a one-sided
[11:32] worship
[11:32] not an unbalanced worship not fleshly
[11:36] worship with strange fire but my
[11:39] friends genuine worship where jesus
[11:43] said that we must worship him
[11:46] and the father seeks those to worship
[11:48] him
[11:49] that will worship him in spirit
[11:52] and also in the truth there's a
[11:56] lot of worshiping in the spirit a lot of
[11:59] emotions
[12:00] a lot of running around a lot of
[12:02] speaking in towns
[12:03] worshiping in the spirit but also
[12:06] friends
[12:07] we need to worship him in
[12:10] the truth then on the other hand there
[12:13] are many
[12:14] that have received the message of the
[12:16] messenger
[12:17] and they are worshiping in the truth
[12:20] but with a hardly any spirit hardly any
[12:24] spirit any kind of life to them
[12:27] but just an emotionless uh
[12:30] one that has no real revelation upon it
[12:34] no
[12:34] fire has fallen upon that truth no
[12:37] fire has fallen upon the altar and
[12:40] therefore
[12:41] they worshipping me in the truth but
[12:43] without the spirit
[12:45] but a real genuine balance worship
[12:48] is to worship god in spirit
[12:52] and in truth thanks be to god hallelujah
[12:55] also the voice like a trumpet
[12:58] a trumpet sound is also
[13:02] a call to arms it's a call to let you
[13:06] know we are about to be engaged in a war
[13:11] i have heard that voice i hope you have
[13:14] and we know that we are not called to a
[13:18] picnic or to a barbecue
[13:20] or to a church potluck sapa but we are
[13:23] called to fight against not against
[13:26] flesh and blood
[13:28] but against principalities powers
[13:31] spiritual wickedness
[13:32] in high places and thanks be to
[13:36] god we have the victory before
[13:39] we have already before the war is even
[13:41] over
[13:42] we are assured we have the victory for
[13:45] we are more than conquerors
[13:48] through him that loved us praise be to
[13:52] god hallelujah
[13:53] now i'd like to make an observation
[13:55] [Music]
[13:57] that if john was in the spirit
[14:00] or when john was in the spirit
[14:03] and he was transported into the future
[14:08] and john city heard a voice behind him
[14:12] now if he heard the voice behind
[14:15] speaking then the voice that john
[14:19] heard was the voice
[14:22] of the lord jesus christ speaking
[14:26] to all of the church ages
[14:29] all of the ages of the church
[14:33] and giving to each messenger his message
[14:37] for each church age so john
[14:41] being in the future but hearing the
[14:44] voice behind
[14:45] him could hear the voice of jesus christ
[14:50] speaking to the church ages
[14:53] speaking first of all to the patriarchs
[14:58] way back in the old testament
[15:02] he heard the voice this same voice
[15:05] this voice of melchizedek that spoke to
[15:09] abraham the voice that spoke to
[15:12] job all of the patriots that same voice
[15:16] he heard it speaking to the prophets
[15:19] and through the prophets and then
[15:22] that voice we began to hear it
[15:26] speaking in the new cup under the new
[15:29] covenant
[15:30] to the seven messengers
[15:33] of the seven church ages hearing that
[15:36] trumpet voice behind
[15:38] him through all of these ages
[15:42] so i can say he heard the voice of
[15:45] history
[15:47] he heard the voice of experience praise
[15:50] god hallelujah oh glory to god
[15:54] and then he must have heard the voice
[15:58] voice in revelation 19 i believe
[16:01] where he said and i heard the voice
[16:05] amen after the voices in heaven had said
[16:09] for the marriage of the lamb is come
[16:11] and the wife was made herself ready he
[16:14] said he heard the voices saying
[16:17] amen hallelujah and then
[16:20] voices like thundering waters
[16:23] oh glory to god hallelujah it's the
[16:26] voice of
[16:27] god the very voice of god with the bible
[16:31] says break at the cedars in lebanon
[16:33] the voice of god hallelujah that
[16:37] roars like a lion the voice of god the
[16:40] bible says psalm 44
[16:42] 6 that he spoke and the earth moved
[16:46] it trembled at the voice of the living
[16:48] god hallelujah
[16:50] and john was hearing this voice
[16:53] behind them this very voice that
[16:56] made the earth heave and move and
[16:59] tremble
[17:00] at the voice of god and it will in the
[17:03] future
[17:04] at the time of the judgment the voice of
[17:07] god
[17:07] will cause the rocks to break and try to
[17:11] hide themselves but
[17:13] none can hide from the trumpet voice
[17:16] of jesus christ this is the same voice
[17:19] that said to the deaf the blind the
[17:22] lame the dead speak to them
[17:26] rise take up your bed and walk that same
[17:29] voice that trumpet voice
[17:31] which the bible said he lifted up his
[17:34] voice and said
[17:35] lazarus come forth that very voice is
[17:39] the voice
[17:40] that will be heard at the day of the
[17:43] resurrection
[17:44] when he said the lazarus is as much as
[17:47] if he
[17:47] will say to us come forth hallelujah
[17:51] and all the dead that died in the lord
[17:55] will come forth he was just
[17:58] demonstrating
[17:59] that he is the resurrection and the life
[18:03] and at the sound of his voice it gives
[18:06] life to even dead things and bring
[18:09] things to life and so the dead
[18:12] will come back to life in the
[18:15] resurrection
[18:16] by the trumpet voice of jesus christ
[18:20] the living god hallelujah i want to say
[18:24] yet also he heard that voice of many
[18:28] waters
[18:30] and that was the voice of the people of
[18:32] god
[18:33] in other words it was living voices
[18:36] but we will speak of that praise god
[18:39] hallelujah
[18:40] it calls you to attention something
[18:43] important
[18:44] is about to comfort pay attention
[18:47] pay attention to the word of god shake
[18:49] yourself
[18:50] out of your stupor and come to yourself
[18:53] and
[18:54] recognize that it's god speaking
[18:57] by his word it's an urgent call
[19:00] to pay attention to god's word god's
[19:03] word
[19:04] comes sometimes startlingly to shake us
[19:07] to awareness
[19:08] and to awaken us to his presence to
[19:12] recognize him in our day and in our time
[19:15] praise
[19:16] god hallelujah then if the trumpet voice
[19:20] was something forth like that to john
[19:23] and
[19:24] john was in the future when he
[19:27] was hearing that voice then he was
[19:30] hearing the voice of prophecy
[19:33] it was prophecy and he was hearing
[19:36] this voice which was not only the voice
[19:39] of the resurrection
[19:41] but the voice of prophecy the
[19:44] word of prophecy and by being
[19:47] having that prophecy being told
[19:51] to john who is a type of the bride
[19:55] or of the wife of christ it was
[19:58] god allowing john to be
[20:01] come or john a type of the bride to be
[20:05] aware
[20:06] of what is to come and by being aware
[20:10] of what is to come in the future
[20:13] john could be prepared also
[20:17] for what is to come thanks me the god
[20:20] that god never leaves his people without
[20:24] a witness
[20:25] god never takes anyone to judgment
[20:28] without first giving them a warning
[20:31] and thanks be to god it's written
[20:34] in the book hallelujah and blessed are
[20:38] your
[20:38] eyes that's it blessed are your ears
[20:42] that hear the word of god and the voice
[20:45] of god
[20:46] in these last days listen revelation
[20:49] chapter 1 verse 11
[20:52] i am alpha and omega
[20:56] the first and the last what thou seest
[21:00] write in a book and send it
[21:04] onto the seven churches which
[21:07] are in asia on the ephesus on the smyrna
[21:11] on the bergamos onto tyra onto sardis
[21:15] onto philadelphia and antolio di
[21:18] praise god he is the first and he is the
[21:22] last
[21:23] he is same on the beginning of all
[21:25] things
[21:26] and i am the finality of all things
[21:29] i am the author and i
[21:32] am the finisher after all everything
[21:35] else has
[21:36] passed away back into nothingness
[21:39] he remains standing firm for he is our
[21:43] god who changeth not the author
[21:46] and the finisher of our faith glory to
[21:50] god hallelujah
[21:51] the one true god the one true and only
[21:55] god
[21:55] whose name is jesus christ for the word
[21:59] god only means object of worship
[22:02] and lots of people like to say oh god
[22:05] said this god told me that which god
[22:07] there are many gods many lords but there
[22:10] is only
[22:11] one true god and his name is
[22:14] the lord jesus christ hallelujah
[22:18] so the voice of the word of god
[22:22] speaking to john hallelujah meaning to
[22:25] let him know
[22:26] not just prophecies at hand but truth is
[22:29] at hand
[22:30] reality is at hand the unfailing reality
[22:33] of the living god is at hand so pay
[22:36] attention
[22:37] to the word of god what a thing what an
[22:40] experience
[22:41] to be in the spirit caught up by the
[22:44] spirit of god
[22:45] and to be in the presence of the lord
[22:49] under the anointing waiting in his
[22:51] presence
[22:52] and to hear from the lord himself
[22:55] listen listen to the instructions to
[22:58] john
[22:59] three full instruction
[23:03] what thou seest
[23:06] first of all john was to see
[23:09] these things were done for him to see
[23:12] not only meaning that john should be to
[23:15] be there to observe
[23:17] or to spectate but he was to
[23:20] understand he was to visibly see
[23:24] and inwardly to understand
[23:27] what god was saying to him and
[23:30] in type what god was saying to the
[23:33] entire
[23:34] church of all ages first he had to see
[23:39] and secondly god said what thou see us
[23:42] right john was supposed to write
[23:46] right in this marvelous book of
[23:50] revelation
[23:51] hallelujah that's the second command
[23:54] what does yes cs write and then he said
[23:58] send it
[23:59] unto the churches praise god well some
[24:02] of those
[24:03] churches not just the the
[24:06] uh churches that were there at the time
[24:11] that uh held the character of the
[24:14] ages that were to come but that
[24:18] also has a double meaning of going to
[24:21] those
[24:21] churches at that time yeah around the
[24:25] asia
[24:25] minor of praise god and thus
[24:29] it also means that that letter that john
[24:33] wrote which is this book of revelation
[24:36] is supposed to go to the
[24:39] churches even in history or the future
[24:44] at the time when john was there which
[24:46] means to
[24:47] us and here we are reading
[24:50] out of the book of revelation those
[24:53] very things that john was commanded by
[24:57] the divine
[24:58] inspiration and anointing to write
[25:01] within the book oh blessed be the name
[25:04] of the lord
[25:05] glory to his holy name my friends how
[25:07] marvel it is to know
[25:09] that that great voice of god that
[25:12] sounded
[25:13] off the word of god in the garden of
[25:16] eden to adam and eve glory to god
[25:20] when they came down and had a gospel
[25:24] meeting
[25:25] fellowship with god sitting down and
[25:28] god speaking to his children in the
[25:32] evening
[25:32] time that voice will once more
[25:35] be heard in the land the voice of the
[25:38] turtle dove
[25:39] heard in the land once again the queen
[25:44] of the great dove of peace oh
[25:47] the wings of a snow white dove
[25:50] god sent down this pure sweet love
[25:54] a sign from above oh praise god
[25:57] on the wings of a dove oh glory to his
[26:00] god
[26:01] what a what a place of rest to be what a
[26:04] place of peace to be
[26:06] under the wings of the great snow white
[26:08] dove of god hallelujah
[26:10] that voice that spoke peace that voice
[26:14] that spoke
[26:15] fellowship that spoils that spoke
[26:18] redemption to them
[26:19] in the garden of eden that same voice
[26:23] roared
[26:24] upon the mountain of sinai speaking with
[26:27] thunders and thundering on lightnings
[26:30] and judgments of the living god
[26:32] and commandments oh my god that voice
[26:36] the same voice
[26:37] it spoke there oh glory to god but
[26:40] thanks be to god
[26:42] there was an age of grace coming and we
[26:45] heard the same voice again upon the
[26:48] mount transfiguration speaking grace
[26:52] grace grace that hip stone
[26:55] which is jesus christ crying out
[26:58] grace grace grace
[27:01] mercy pardon hallelujah for he
[27:05] was the fulfillment of that headstone
[27:08] that that that cornerstone that would
[27:11] come forth in zion
[27:13] crying of grace grace grace
[27:16] and that great that great stone
[27:21] this great person jesus christ upon the
[27:24] monk transfiguration
[27:26] was conformed by the voice saying this
[27:29] is my beloved son hear
[27:33] ye him why he is the word so
[27:36] hear what the word of god is saying and
[27:39] the word
[27:40] speaks not judgment but us back there
[27:43] and commandments
[27:44] but grace mercy pardon
[27:48] freedom liberty redemption
[27:51] oh praise god unto him who
[27:54] washed us and loosed us from from our
[27:58] sins
[27:58] in his own blood unto him with praise
[28:02] and honor and glory forever
[28:05] and forever blessed be the name of the
[28:08] lord god
[28:09] oh that voice that was heard in the
[28:12] excellent
[28:13] glory in the presence of god is again
[28:17] sending forth praise god but it's
[28:19] sounding forth
[28:21] within this seven church
[28:24] ages at that time oh praise god
[28:27] hallelujah
[28:29] and uh and from that time and you know
[28:32] the seven church ages if you do not know
[28:36] came from john's time paul's time
[28:39] when paul was as the main messenger
[28:42] of the ephesians church age which later
[28:46] on
[28:46] we will take them individually and begin
[28:50] to
[28:50] teach upon them their implications
[28:53] what their confirmations their
[28:55] vindications
[28:57] whatever it is that they are expressing
[28:59] and type
[29:00] and in reality we will try to make it
[29:04] clear
[29:05] as taught by the holy spirit through the
[29:08] prophet of god in this end time praise
[29:11] god hallelujah
[29:13] and we know we're at the final part of
[29:16] these church ages
[29:17] for we are now living in the age of
[29:20] laodicea
[29:21] we are now living in the last church
[29:26] age there are no more church ages
[29:29] for the gentiles after this as i have
[29:33] said before
[29:34] after the gentile seasons of time
[29:38] and dispensations are over
[29:41] it all is now beginning to return
[29:44] back to our jewish brethren to welcome
[29:48] the
[29:48] coming of their king hallelujah
[29:52] so that voice is sending forth again to
[29:55] these seven
[29:56] churches well praise god and the seven
[29:59] churches as some of you will know
[30:03] in the form of the pyramid it expresses
[30:06] and types and shows the
[30:09] fullness and finality of the
[30:13] person of the lord jesus christ
[30:17] himself and it gives us an
[30:20] insight into the final the full and
[30:24] final revelation of jesus christ
[30:27] to his church in these last days
[30:31] praise be to god listen to god
[30:34] write the visions john write divisions
[30:38] make a record of them
[30:42] make this record for the ages that are
[30:45] to follow
[30:46] for john was in the spirit spiritually
[30:51] physically john was in the ephesian
[30:54] church age john was in the ephesian
[30:57] church age
[30:59] and so god is saying right john
[31:03] for the ages not only for your age
[31:06] but for all the other church ages
[31:10] that are to come for these
[31:13] are true prophecies and they will
[31:16] surely come to pass we know god's word
[31:20] must surely come to pass for heaven and
[31:23] earth will pass away
[31:25] but my word will never pass away
[31:28] so john write them first of all see what
[31:31] i'm
[31:32] saying write them and send them
[31:35] making them known to the people praise
[31:39] god
[31:39] hallelujah so that they can know
[31:42] and be prepared and be aware of what is
[31:46] to happen
[31:47] what is to take place in their day and
[31:50] in
[31:50] their time that they will have at least
[31:53] a general awareness
[31:55] of the nature of their age of some of
[31:58] the activities
[31:59] that will be taking place in their age
[32:02] and so on so that the church of god
[32:05] is left with awareness prophecy
[32:09] modern events being made clear
[32:12] by the fulfillment and the vindication
[32:16] of prophecy in our day so that we may
[32:19] recognize our day and the message
[32:22] that god sent for our day praise
[32:25] be to god and just as much as the bible
[32:29] tells us john
[32:30] recognize the voice oh praise god
[32:34] if you are a son a daughter a child of
[32:37] god you will also recognize that voice
[32:41] for as you know in the book of john i
[32:44] believe it's chapter
[32:45] 15 he says my sheep hear my voice
[32:49] my sheep know my voice that oh praise
[32:53] god if you are a seed son oh
[32:56] a certified seed son and daughter and
[32:59] child of god
[33:01] then my brother sister you will know
[33:05] the voice of god you will recognize that
[33:08] voice
[33:08] and in closing you may say brother simon
[33:11] how am i going to
[33:12] recognize a voice like that oh will you
[33:16] ask a baby how will it recognize
[33:20] its mother's voice does the baby need
[33:23] theology
[33:24] does the baby need to have an education
[33:27] before it knows how to recognize it
[33:30] its parents voice it does so
[33:34] by what god already placed in it the
[33:36] ability
[33:37] god placed an ability in that child
[33:40] before it was even born to recognize the
[33:44] voice of its parent and even so within
[33:48] the heart of a believer
[33:50] before the foundation of the world god
[33:53] placed that innate ability that
[33:57] inspiration to recognize the voice
[34:00] of your heavenly parent praise
[34:04] god hallelujah so here we are
[34:07] being called upon to recognize that
[34:09] trumpet voice

[34:14] call to duty
