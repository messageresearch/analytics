Father's Day Sermon 2020
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good morning friends let us come in to his house with Thanksgiving and enter his courts with praise may the Lord bless us all this wonderful Sunday morning today we come to speak about fathers may the Lord richly bless every father here today may we read our scripture out of Malachi chapter 4 verse 5 behold I will send you Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the Great and dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the father's to the children and their heart of the children to the father's to their fathers lest I come and smite the earth with a curse our gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for these wonderful words here today we ask your divine blessing may your great Holy Spirit anoint the written word to our hearts and knowing those who are in their homes or places watching or listening to receive the word Lord may the great Holy Spirit now spread out his great shining wings everywhere father to overshadow the elected seed and people everywhere that they may hear your voice hear your word and they attend Shannon take you take the glory father and all the praise father Amen god bless you this morning of course today we are not here to do an exposition of Malachi 4:5 6 we will not do any explaining about the coming of Elijah instead we are here to have a topical approach to this text today we are here to commemorate and to celebrate father's on this Father's Day 2020 I want to say to all fathers everywhere happy Father's Day but in saying happy Father's Day what does it mean to be a father of course it doesn't just mean being male because that only means that one has the capacity or the physical ability to produce a child but I do believe that a real responsible father believes God with all his heart and serves God a real father is one who is a man of faith and also recognizes he is the pastor priest or Shepherd of his own little home I also believe and the Bible teaches that a real father loves wife and love his children's mother with all his heart a real father also loves his children a real father is an example to his children and he's an example by modeling behavior positive behaviors in their presence around them and with them something that they can that can provide them an image that they can draw from a frame of reference that they may be able to live by of course I believe that a real father provides for his family I also believe that a real father protects his family he does everything in his power to protect his family and watch over them in love like a lion like an eagle or a beer watching over his phone I also believe that a real father will discipline his family he will restrain his family from certain things that are not good not proper he will restrain them he will speak act and do in ways that will place limits standards guidelines upon them now I'm here to apply this text to these perilous times in which we live for we are now live in as I've said the pre-tribulation period of the seventh church age the little dision church age which is loose lacks lazy and lukewarm in its ways my friends this is the age this is the end of the Gentiles age and this is the time when all the great wonderful standards that have been set of being swept aside by the rising tide of sin it seems as if we have a right to the time when nothing is sacred in the eyes of men and women everywhere the modern church finds itself in a time of modern spiritual blackout finds herself blindfolded or in blindness many unsaved backslidden preachers now lead God's people and they may be insincere sincere as they are and some are filled with anointing and fire upon them my friends but as the Scriptures have said they come into the presence of God with a strange fire taik about it they have Lord God standards of God's Word they have Lord God standards for holiness in the churches in the houses of worship places considered sacred it's no more the way it was in from Bible days or even in the days of our forefathers they have let down the bars and the goats have come in the standards for holiness have gone down and in some places outside of the door while it was in Israel some time ago point of view the inside of one of those beautiful ancient churches on the gates and on the wall outside was a same thing let not enter here with sharts let not enter here with just bikinis or half-dressed for we have provided here gowns that you must put on or you are not allowed in to the house of God my friends the standards have been let down but there are a few churches few preachers and men of God who will not compromise and will stand by the Word of God and by the truth of God's Word until the crowning Cain may God bless them whoever they are wherever they are everywhere in the Spirit of God continue to open their wisdom their understanding their anoint their utterance and give them all that they need to perform the purpose and the will of God for everywhere else the the standards of God's holiness has been lowered Christian conduct has been diluted it's just brushed aside lowering the bars as I've said you've diluted the doctrines the teachings of the Bible to make it acceptable the certain money class of people or kinds of people or cultured people are educated people oh whatever they have just left down the bars and let all kinds of spiders and frogs and snakes and and goats and wolves ravening wolves and everything else has entered the house of the Living God hucksters and everything else in the presence of Almighty God and let down the the bars of the standards of the doctrines and teachings of the Bible their perverted apostolic order of how the God's church should behave and be ordered and performed and have replaced them with what man-made denominational systems of church governments and administrations writing up their own books and fundamentals and and order and everything else quite dreary to the Word of the Living God and as a result our Lord Jesus himself has said if the blind lead the blind Zenda they were both fall into the ditch I believe as a result of this as a result of the misdirection of the Church of the Living God many families many fathers are fallen into that niche at the present time in which we live statistically many fathers have turned away from their children literally forsaken them abuse them and left them behind lift them to grow up by themselves fathers leaving their children just having children and leaving them oh my friends this has nothing to do with class color wealth or anything else it's just the spirit of the age that made the god of this evil age has blinded the minds and the hearts of men and women and caused them to act in such ways that they reflect the beastly nature of the serpent that was in the garden here my friends these many fathers leaving their children to group by themselves with no guidance with no leadership in their lives leave them with no proper example yes I know many women and God bless them have raised and are raising their children fight themselves and many are doing a great and marvelous wonderful job but the role of male and female are totally different and each one has its place and one cannot really take the place of the other and so that is why the male presence in the home in a family unit is so important as as a male without the wife's presence leaves him disarmed and when the male is not in the home that woman is left disarmed those children are left unprotected they left forsaken and forlorn all my friends left with no discipline to become rebellious in the home in the schools in the streets everywhere but really it's a cry for help within the coverings of their soul you can hear the echoes of their crying crying out somebody help me please somebody help me Oh somebody love me somebody talk to me somebody advise me it's just that these young people and children are crying up for help and as it's written in the scriptures these fathers have turned away from the children the hearts of the fathers have turned away from their own children walked away from them lift them to fend for themselves and when they do that along comes a gang leader along comes some kind of a pimp or trafficker or and the damn my friends what's at times we live in when these young people these kids are never straight brought into some kind of an escort service or told they will be come a model and then they're defrauded oh and they are just debauched god help us in the age in which we live left with no guidance no leadership homeless helpless aimless unloved confused but longing for love left with no no parameters no guidelines more restraint within their lives no one to set something some system or some way by which they should live and so they live the way they would to live and so there is no enforcement of discipline no authority figures in their lives and so when they are left like that they name their searching for some authority figure in their life it may be that a school principal their teacher their pastor a priest some leader will fill that void may God help us it was the wrong kind of leadership that will distort and convert that pliable image in the heart of a child or in the heart of a young people person left your children the heart of the father's turn away from his own children that he brought into this world and left them and walked away from them no support no provision no protection no example no idea what laughs to go into the home or in the street to become long as rebels and juvenile delinquents as it's been said the juvenile delinquency mainly did not start with the pig but the children most of the times if you were to trace it back the juvenile delinquency started with the parent the heart of the father's turned away from their old children and lift them in the state and which they're in all my friends if we as father's parents do not provide them the modeled example the advice they the nurture the care the love that they need the testing for it they are going to seek it out somewhere else and they'll find it in the arms of illicit love affair they'll find them in the in the model of a a movie star the image of a movie star they'll dress like are they're like him they'll walk like her or walk like him they'll talk like that person because in the depths and core of their being they are searching and seeking to find an example a model a great line something by which they can set their life trajectory upward or downwards friends children do not know what real love is and when they're left by themselves and do not know what real love is then they end up being targets for perverted forms of love and then comes along a slick good-looking men are a smooth-talking woman and tell them that they love them that they care about them that they'll provide their needs they can give them whatever they want and so they go with them and they become entangled and fornication in adultery and various forms of alternative lifestyles caught up in the sea of sexual promiscuity all friends what a sad iron a sad day in which we live first of all the social and spiritual acclaim in society is one of the main thoughts for this the spiritual decline within the church is a great fault for this for the church itself was lost her first love I believe it's time for the church to repent and remember from when she has fallen and go back to where she started in the presence of Almighty God with the power of the Holy Spirit and the leadership of the teaching of the holy smokes and the comforter to come and comfort and guidance with Ness warn exhort and lead by His divine presence in the house of the Living God secondly I believe it's also it's the fault of the modern-day farmers who have turned their hearts away from their own children that they brought into this world and have this certain them brought them into the world but we'll take no responsibility for them there are also fathers but many of them are right in the home but they might as well not even be in the house or in that home because they're in the home bodily but their hearts are turned away from their own children from their own young ones they're teenagers their hearts are turned away from them they look upon them as burdens they look upon them as hindrances many of them look upon them as like mill stones around their necks they themselves of that come to estate to realize the treasures that they have in those children those young people the potential the greatness the legacy that they have the ability to live for them they are not aware of it and as a result of that their hearts are turned away from their own children in spirit my friends I tell you many times they themselves have no real love so they don't know how to love they had no real empathetic relationship with their parents and so they come up consciousness with no conscience they come up with a conscience ear as a hot iron no feeling you know they just have no idea what real love is it's just like an animal and even the animals love and will protect their own and reach out further Oh they have no example no proper example of it in their lives maybe a brought up in an environment of cloying fussing fightin fretting like that brought up in with a behavior pattern that was negative cursing swearing lying smoking drinking every example of alcoholic environment that turned them away from God and God's Word and presence for they had no other example and that's what they saw an experience and drop with that pattern and that pattern in which they grew up they are now passing that on down to their children because they have no proper bility or capacity to be able to do that however thank God their repentance turn into God giving your life to Jesus Christ committing your life to the leadership of a proper ministry or men of God that God will use to shape you form you and guide you in your living for him it will change your life completely and put you on another level my friend even if you do not become huh let's say a dyed-in-the-wool Christian you kill it will at least make you a better person a better citizen it will bring you a a better state and status walk in society just commit your life to Christ just commit your heart to him ask him to come into your life ask him to open up his word to you ask him to give you a taste of this Word of God that will excite you and show you better how to live how to walk and how to treat those around you it's not a Bible in your hand that's when the Bible gets into your heart that is what changes you completely but the power and presence of the Living God we can spot we can talk the Bible we can even Colton doesn't make you a Christian we can take the sheep's wool and cover ourselves and that will still you'll still have the nature of a wolf but may the great Holy Spirit bring about a genuine transformation they're genuine change hallelujah no one is beyond the grass for the hand of Almighty God I pray God that God laid his hand upon you this hand upon father's everywhere save them Lord in the name of Jesus Christ open their eyes of their understanding father may the skins fall off and may they come to a genuine relationship with you Lord which will affect their entire life and family and blessed be a blessing to their children I want to say thanks me to God as it is written in our scriptures but I will turn the hearts of the children the fathers to their children oh praise God God promised it that though the fathers have turned away their hearts from their children he will by His Holy Spirit turn their hearts back to their children again I believe there's hope for you sir I believe there's hope for us all that he will turn our hearts back to our children glory to God hallelujah oh my friend remember your children provide for your children I urge and encourage you give guidance to your children discipline your children protect your children comfort and love your children that God has given you I would like to encourage you today to provide a positive image for your children the best and the greatest way for you to do that is to come become a real Christian that can say I'm born again free from sin I am a happy night and day thank God I'm free at last I'm free from my habits I'm free from my old ways and free from my old life and now I walk into the glorious liberty of a son and a child of God hallelujah tell your friends I say I've become a real Christian because many cloak themselves with the trappings of real Christianity but they're worse sometimes than the sinners unbelievers ungodly that are outside God's wonderful church you see men that claim to be Christians and are in the church yes abusing their wives abusing their children dominating domineering all my friends their own flesh and blood the God gave them and witness shower upon them they love God that he has shed abroad in their hearts may God help us all that we may be genuine true Christians and let the love of God flow out of our lives and be a blessing up there abusing their own family using them physically by hitting them brutalizing them depriving them of nurture of care end of love listen friends let me pause here you see brother Simon why don't you use better words why don't you make it a little smoother and easier to take then this is another time for us to be playing games from the pulpit my friends you've got to be like a tiger with the Word of God and let the world know that Jesus Christ lives and saves and he delivers and he can become the pilot of their lives by surrendering their hearts and the lives to him amen friends men claiming to be Christians and under the cover and cloak of their Christianity at many times mentally harassing their own children ways young people calling them all kinds of names cursing in the home swearing in the home user Christians I'm talking about so-called Christians behind the dark curtains behind the walls of the home all of the old preachers at all if walls could talk my friends I tell you our Italy something else if the walls could talk but harassing their own mental harassment mental abuse mental mocking mental provocation as the Bible's that father's provoke not your children - and are unto wrath it's something that God Himself is against God does not want you to push your child or your children into a corner and provoke them to anger in any way many fathers also spiritually by their actions and by their ungodly example effect the future the life the personality of their children cause it cause their children's personality instead of blooming and blossoming and going to their highest potential and abilities they have perverted and stunted their spiritual growth and even sometimes their natural and mental growth in every way and suppress them and turn away their children from God from God's church keep them away from God's people keep them away from me they this book my friends sin will keep you away from this book or this book will keep you away from sin back to the Bible back took a Word of God back to church back in the house of the Lord back to the way maybe your mother brought you up and your wonderful way far in the sin come back to God come back to the Bible back to the word have a whole healthy happy family by God's grace today may the Holy Spirit speak to you out of this simple pamba rough maybe crude words but if the truth nevertheless my friends I tell you so many do what I'm speaking about my prayer today is that farmers everywhere we repent for sins committed against their children may God today turn the hearts of fathers back to words their children think about them wherever you are go look for them find them love them right where they are oh praise God attend new friends fathers brothers wherever you are God is a just God and when you love you will be loved when you are friendly you will have friends when you reach out to your young ones your teenagers your young people your children with friendliness with family nest with love and kindness you will receive it back you will receive it back gardening that only say anyway that he will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children but in this scripture it says at the same time that he will turn the hearts of the children back towards their fathers so that if their fathers in the past and abuse has misuse as has suppressed oppressed them in any way God said he can turn the hearts of those children back to their fathers if those fathers will only say I am sorry at the time I had not grown or mature the way I should have I was confused or I was in a terrible state I was in a mess I needed help oh my friend come let these children I'm speaking now to the children whose hearts God said and I will turn the hearts of the children back to the father's so the hearts of the fathers a turn back to the children and a loving God turns the hearts of the children back to the father's so that there could be a uniting time there could be a oneness of this family there could be love and peace fit in the home God can have them in such a blissful state again my friends but when the father loves cares and carries out his rose his rightful rose and takes up again his responsibilities of a real father when he does that then God said I will turn the heart of the children back to their fathers God is saying by that scripture and phraseology I will repair the breach I will repair broken relationship I will knit again strained relationships he promised to turn the hearts of these estranged lonely unloved rebellious and confused children back to their fathers oh god help us as God turned the heart of that prodigal son back to his daddy again and said I don't care what state I'm in I know I can have a better life and a better relationship if I turn my heart my life back over into my father's care may God help you to be worthy of that and to live that kind of a life where the parts of your children maybe turn right back to you as a father and I believe that if a father will sincerely repent and us begin to pray oh god I've been separated strained for my children regardless of what caused that estrangement Oh God turn the hearts of my children back to me back to me as a father Lord that I might be able to perform my role by Myron and take up my responsibilities within their lines old friend Oh may you ask God Lord I will provide for them I will provide the clothing the food the succored and nurture place for them to live to give them of my time look you may be poor you may be rich you may be high you may be low but but you are robbing your children of your time and of your attention and I'm calling and challenging you today then you might ask God to give you strength to be able to change your you're weighing your lifestyle you're rushing about your your rat race that you're caught up in your back then that calls you to the lowest form of life for your shipping parties that takes you away from them that you would ask not to give you the desire to have time with them play with them in the park talk to them today come with you go fishing or walking or hiking something but they need your love they need your attention they need your care especially in the formative years and even when they're older than need your wisdom your experience or advice and God place you there with that raw responsibly to take it upon your shoulders my friends it is very important pray for them most of all love them from your heart and not only from your heart oh they're ready no no you must firmly tell him I love you Tom I love you Jane I love you Jim your dad loves you let them know you're you as a father really do love them tell them verbally and most of all determine that from today you prefer your plans to provide a good godly example for your children oh praise God and I tell you friends if you pledge and pray that God will give you that godly example then I would encourage you to pray like this Lord today in obedience to your plan for the family I pledge to provide a good and godly example of a Father's love and here I'll try with all that is within me Lord to be the best father that I can be and to you young people in children I'm going to encourage you on this Father's Day and every day ought to be Father's Day to go to your father your daddy wherever he is if you can get to him give him a hug and tell him that I love you I love you dad and I listen to you I learned from you I trust you you are my hero say it and go into it and may god bless all of you I'm thinking of the words of a beautiful song written by Roger Hoffman under certain conditions it's called consider the lilies and here are some of the words we have a Heavenly Father up above with eyes full of mercy on a heart full of love he really cares when your head is bowed low consider the lilies and then you will know may God bless us all happy fathers day 2020 God richly bless you until we come together again to worship God Bible study lesson 10
