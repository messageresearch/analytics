crowd they testified my redeemers no longer dead he's risen and he's coming back for you and me oh my redeemers amen [Music] that was wonderful praise the Lord God bless you thank God for you being here on this one this wonderful night amen it's a night of uh fog on the outside that's what led you see us anyway and we are here tonight to worship and praise the name of the Lord God bless you all thank you so much sister God bless you praise God we are it's just a joy in my heart to be here gathered together with you in the presence of the Lord you see we had just caught in these dimensions of time we say heaven but it's almost like uh you know there's just we are just here and the other level is up here oh praise God one step amen and you can cross over you can cross over alive look around like brother Branham did and God says well you got to go back you have more work to do praise the Lord than he did praise God and he told us what happened when he was over there so we know that what we have received is not uh the thoughts of a man it's not something man-made and the Vindication of it Supernatural Vindication of it independent of the Prophet or the presence of the prophet in certain situations and things that took place he was he's not even around and the supernatural events are still following this message so then we know that this is beyond the prophet it's more than the prophet it's God almighty he's just using his word as a means of of the white horse rider is traveling on the word and we come because we love him and we worship Him he tried to get people to believe that he is in this upper Dimension that they can't see feel hair taste or whatever Hallelujah under rejected they reject him because they can't see him they can't hear his voice because he can speak as loud over there and we can't hear over here unless we've been given receptors to hear and to pick that up and so the mass of human being living on this realm they reject the fact that there's this real person and to others they believe it temporarily then it starts to become like fiction and blacks come like ordinary and they get you know used to it but we continue with a firm faith not because we're trying to work ourselves up in a faith but I'm just talking because this is how I feel this is what I see the fact is brother sister that uh this has always been real to me maybe to you uh it's real it wasn't a guess praise God hallelujah uh sometimes you believe it almost as you want to say uh to the extreme as Solomon said be not over much righteous that you've gone you know you're falling on the other side but keep your balance and walk in line with the word of God but the main thing is that you always are something strange you knew it was strange strange about you strange about certain people you might meet but you know you were different you you can't explain it you don't know what it was or if something following you all the time praise the Lord feeling even if you're alone that there's another presence with you praise God brother sister when you begin to recognize the reality of the other world and the other worldliness of this world the reality of it praise God it gives you such a courage such a faith praise God waiting to serve God's purpose glorify him amen so let's work till Jesus comes let's work till Jesus comes because he has come and physically he's coming again praise God so let's trust in him and believe is the promise of his word Isaiah chapter 53 verses 1 to 5 and tonight uh being in church I know this may sound funny strange to some simplistic to others but I just like to tell you a story and I trust that God will uh bless it to your heart and to your life praise the Lord if you have Isaiah 53 up there we will read it together and then beloved short brief prayer and then we'll go into the word of God praise the Lord Hallelujah who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord reveal your arm is what you use to move things of course that's the word Jesus amen praise the Lord for he all of a sudden it changes to a person for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant tree by the river and as a root out of dry ground he had no form nor comeliness when we shall see him when we shall see him when the human breathes sees him he has no form no comliness and when we shall see him there is no Beauty that we should desire nothing attractive nothing to attract your senses uh you know see touch peace you know those things he is despised and rejected of man a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not we didn't see any value in him nothing valuable about this and I thought so at one time right you have the feeling there is something but it wasn't of any real big value praise the Lord surely he had borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed thanks be to God hallelujah gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for the reading of Thy word now we pray you'll grant us faith by your hearing of the word and you receive all the glory and all the praise in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you please be seated foreign if this should have a topic we'll just call it a Christmas parable a Christmas spiral you know of course that Jesus spoke in parables matter of fact the Bible says and without the parably spoke not right he always spoke in Parables uh in a simple words we see uh brother Branham came on the scene and he himself said unveiling of the Mighty God 's appropriate gifts and a few other places where he also a lot of people don't think so but he spoke in parables now uh you'll say well brother Simon what is a parable and I checked the Oxford Dictionary a parable is a story that points to some moral some Morrow back there according to Dr FM Club a parable is a short narrative or story right under which some important truths is veiled or hidden and to be unveiled I'm just putting that is to be unveiled but there is a truth hidden in that what appears to be a Simple Story there is a truth in there to be unveiled so here we find brother Branham saying now he says I have to speak in a parable here today I have to speak in a parable right you see because this is Leo this year and it is a fitting time Hallelujah for him to speak in a parable you see why it's coming down to the time now when things are going to come where the opening of the word will come to go to the elect Hallelujah and uh the rest will not understand they'll be blinded or they won't hear it they won't understand it the same pattern with Jesus a certain time of his ministry he's preaching he's preaching he's preaching then he gets to this point and he tells them a simple story and he said Master how is it we understand but they don't understand what we're saying amen he says because unto you it's given to know the mystery of the Kingdom you see he says I spoke to them in parables deliberately as the prophet said again uh in unveiling of God he says uh I I spoke in Parables deliberately he says what God do a thing like that he has done it he is doing it and he will do it yet right because it's it's geared for some to go out some to come in others to be left wondering what's going on see but that's the reason why he spoke in Parables because the elect will pierce through all of that and go Beyond the Veil and they will receive what God has transmitted to them without it going out to Satan and his crowd so we are thankful to God that he has brought us to this place where he is able to hide himself in simplicity and every day it seems to be growing simpler and simpler and simpler and then after a while it appears like it's nothing what is he talking about when I say he what's the prophet talking about and it'll come right down to me then it'll come right down to you what are you really talking about because it goes into simplicity but God is doing that that he might protect his gifts is that right at that point I don't know he was looking through time but at that point he was talking about that gift that was in him that was to be used for the glory of God and saying that God was protecting that gift all the time but at the same time we know it also reflects that every true gift of God God's giving you gift uh praise God I'm not talking about just the nine gifts of the Spirit uh there but I'm talking about the gift of eternal life I'm talking about God's gift to you and me praise God and God wants to protect that Hallelujah and many times through our youths through our childhood we were protected but we didn't know it amen and often time when he takes us back down memory lane or we realize that there was something Supernatural there or I would have been dead I would have been in an accident uh this would have happened that would have happened but thank God he brought me out and I'm here today by the grace of God hallelujah and I believe his word praise God Amen praise His Wonderful Name Hallelujah so you see he he protect his gift because it's true that he was to identify himself Hallelujah why God protect his gifts because he's going to use those gifts to identify him [Music] just as much as John the gift of John the Baptist was used to identify the word him praise God and at the same time while John was identifying him it was vindicating and John and also personally giving John an assurance that you are who you realize you are but I'm letting you know for sure you are exactly that what you are Hallelujah because that's the reason why you saw the word that's the reason why you could identify that that's the word and now the word is turning around to identify you hallelujah praise be to God we are thankful that we are one with the father so he protects the gifts that it might you see and uh he deliberately do it that way and put this I know he's talking in a way but I clearly understand what he's saying but he allowed he's put this speaking in Parables as a stumbling block in their way see put it as a stumbling locked in their way but let me tell you in this lab this year it's the fitting time he repeats it remember that is right it is fitting for this day Hallelujah that God spoke in Parables and he's letting him now also speak in Parables amen hallelujah and that's the reason God has protected it he will protect it I tell you until his purpose is served amen praise God hallelujah he'll do that with any gift protect it until their Earthly Service uh to him for him is serve for his glory and honor he says now let me tell you a story praise God amen and I'm going to retell that story the best I can for the glory of God not long ago there in the great city of New York it was on a Christmas Eve and that's why I called this a Christmas Parable right amen and there was a very poor family the daddy had TB and the wife also had tuberculosis they had been underprivileged and he was so weakly but being a man he still went out looking for work God help those able-bodied men that give up and don't go out and look for a job and sit down and cry about it no matter what the situation is we found out this man knew he was a man and he had to work to maintain his family amen just I mean just like Jesus knew he had to go to the Cross even though you were going to die because there's a bride has to be taken care of Amen see now he was so weekly and so nobody would hire him he had no education none whatsoever and the people didn't want him so was Jesus Isaiah 53 despised rejected of men nobody wanted him whatsoever listened remember he was just an outcast so was Jesus and he become a in the street amen and so was Jesus you know what a is today we call them by different names homeless we call them bad people we got different terminologies for for a but you know back then when they talk about a is somebody that you just went around the city slept in the streets or did jump on a train and end up in another city and somehow try to live right and today uh as it was you know in a day when Jesus was there we have a lot of tramps beggars in the streets if you haven't noticed it I notice it all over the city they're everywhere everywhere now but there are real tramps and there are a lot of fake tramps and I'm telling you because I I actually know of somebody that was living that kind of a life and and they got out of it but they were saying that it's it's it's very like a narcotic because they can make so many hundred dollars a day uh without going to a regular job and in a week they can make uh over a thousand two thousand depends and so therefore uh and that time that part they're not in the church here so don't look around thinking it's somebody I'm talking about here now there's no Trump here praise the Lord anyway um God changed that person's life but the point is they're saying it's easy for somebody to fall into that trap right and so be aware of it and I am aware of it when I'm out there there's fake traps and there's real traps how are you going to know the real well God and you will have to make a judgment of your own at that time and you decide for yourself it don't make any difference if they think you they're deceiving you and that sort of thing they'll have to answer to the Lord if God had put it in your heart to give and that person happened to be fake don't worry about that don't even go back looking for them leave them alone God will work it out if it's a true and you give him the person that be really in need amen now you know how what Trump will do this is a real one it'll pick up something pedal it sell it get what he can see try to make a little profit on it uh he says royalty here but I'm just uh bringing it up for you to have Clarity all right amen see to make it he's just trying to live and to get by now this trip or if you want to call him this little Peddler living on living out there on the street now you may buy some pins some needles and symbols whatever you can and maybe buy for a buy for a buck so much for a pack and sell them for a higher amount amen and maybe uh in one day he'll make a Great Commission just think of it all he'd sell in a day amen and when he ended up might be 20 30 but ever since now it's dollars but he had a family and he had to do it by the way I know of a man like that actually that used to just go around picking up uh you know uh picking up first of all he started picking up sticks and selling them as firewood um and then he bought tread and he bought timbals needles he starts selling them selling them I'll make it short the man is now a multi-millionaire his sons have studied in England and in America and their doctors and their lawyers and everything else and uh he's actually moved he died and most of the family moved over here in the Canada some are in Toronto one brother is back home holding the Holdings that are uh back there because they ended up or he ended up owning a trucking industry that spanned the entire country and I am a witness to that because he was living right next door right next door and I'm a witness to that so this is a story but yet it's not just a story it's the reality of the lives of people who are ready to get up and go and to believe what God can do for them Hallelujah no that little wife was at home and she also was weekly and being weak one day she up and died and he was left with their little girl well it was coming on to Christmas time and the little girl because of their poverty and their situation she had developed malnutrition you know that's easy malnutrition not having the right Foods at home she developed malnutrition and she also took TB also well you know that's what happened to the true elect of God within the household of the Church of God that because they couldn't be fed with the right food and they couldn't take in or what they're supposed to properly eat stacked filled with vitamins and filled with the uh the the truths that they're supposed to receive all they receive is grilled and and little soups as the prophet said made from the shadow of a skinny chicken and they had to live on that so they also grow weekly week and start to suffer from tuberculosis in other words we were all dead and sins and trespasses we all were in that state like that and that little girl just ate or nine eight or nine years old and she had never had a doll for Christmas and that's what she wanted for a gift was a doll and the father not being able to give her medical attention and so forth he is seen that his little girl was also going fast away from him the wife already died he's struggling trying to keep the family to feed them and then he sees his little girl also about to leave the scene he tried his best to get enough money to get her a doll for Christmas he could not just get enough to buy her that doll and so Christmas time was coming on and the snowy bad weather set in and a little girl developed and pneumonia maybe just a few weeks Before Christmas and of course the father you can imagine he he was broken-hearted with that situation his morning from the wife then the daughter Upson she's ready to go he's working as hard as he can begging working doing whatever it can but being an outcast being weak as today some people don't know I won't hire that guy he might die on the job oh I wouldn't hire that guy maybe he's got a back problem I wouldn't hire this woman because she might get this or that or whatever you see it's like that and so many of those people they are trapped within a cycle right just just a evil vicious Wicked cycle and it can't and they are genuinely some people like that right oh my friends so here it is hallelujah amen and he thought of his little girl and she wanted a doll like little girls because in her is that to be a mother praise God is that right my God in us was always a desire to be a part of that brain amen we wanted to be sure we are part of that bride hallelujah amen and we want to be able to at least have the stature of a perfect man so there she is you see because that's the nature that's the nature of her thinking like that that one day she may become a mother Hallelujah and being motherly someday if she lives by her nature she will want to have something like that amen no matter where we were in our nature we wanted the truth we wanted the word we wanted a revelation for our day we wanted the stature of a perfect man Hallelujah we wanted to recognize it amen look at it and see it amen by God's word hallelujah amen so God is saved everything he could to get her a little doll but no matter what he did she died and because of her death that father begins to have a lapse of mind in other words you start having mental problems like that his wife had been taken and now his little girl had been taken and his mind got out of place see and he thought he'd go to bed every night and talk to his little girl though she was already buried he talked to her when he'd go to bed telling her honey it wouldn't be long now and that is going to get you this doll for Christmas because Daddy's promise you this doll and I'm gonna do all I can and I'll get this doll for you for Christmas well finally Christmas arrived and of course the rich had their big parties they were worrying about their big parties were worrying about the how many candles they could have burning in their windows they were caught up with their great High masses in their churches and talking about Jesus and so forth and going through all kinds of religious routines and mass and singing and carols and everything little did they know that in a back alley right there Hallelujah behind all of this was that there out of his mind talking to his daughter you know we've been reminded that in the midst of all that's going on not just to remember the poor the Fallen the needy but they don't see behind the facade of things that back there there is a living reality of lives being going on Hallelujah that little that fellow got beside himself he wanted that little girl to have the doll so bad cause she had begged for this little doll so he went out in that weather and bought her a little rag doll just a dirty little use something he had bought down on the side of a street and was was a real cold night The Winds of the blizzards were howling and blowing snow was falling hard there in New York City and right along the coast the streets were filling up the people in their great limousine cars were driving by the jumping parties were taking place people were out in masses drinking all claiming to celebrate the birth of Christ and of these things that we speak of here tonight oh but right away there were many also trying to drink off their old sorrows and them things the way many of them do some drinking off their sorrow some drinking off their guilt and you can you see the the drink is just to mask their mind to deafen their senses so that when you hear the voice of God's spirit speaking inside to them turn around turn around oh praise God God is calling amen oh praise God so God's speaking to them yes sir hallelujah amen oh my so we find out that this man wandered a long knowing in his heart the girl was gone but he still went and bought that doll anyhow because he had made a promise to her that he had buy her a little doll so he didn't have anywhere to go no one was home waiting for him so he just started walking in the snowy blizzard he couldn't fool himself she wasn't back in a little shanty and in that little sleeping in that little ragged dirty bed that they had for her because she was already buried he knew but he thought he'd find her from his mind he thought he'd find her somewhere on the street so he just said I'll just keep walking maybe I'll find her oh my and while he was going down them alleys he could hear many singing carols to the Lord and going down the alley packing in his hand that little dirty doll holding on to his coat amen his heart only thinking of his little girl finally a policeman happened to see him and the policeman had a few drinks himself and he ran into the alley and grabbed the old man turned him around and said what are you hanging around this alley here for uh you see he says now he told him where he lived where do you live um oh I live such and such he says uh what is that in your hand I have a little doll here sir what is it for he says I I have it for my little girl sir he says all right well you're going away from the place where you're supposed to be going that address you're you're drunk go back the other way then he said no sir I'm not drunk but I promised my little girl I'd get her a gift for Christmas and he said I'll get her this little I get her this little girl for this little girl I'll get her this doll the cop said let me see it he showed him a little dirty rag doll he was holding the policeman half drunk himself just shook them and said I'll get away from me and he started on his way and so the old man went down the alley snow falling fast all around him well the midnight parties broke up and I think about time the parties that these churches been having in this age of Leo this year I believe it's breaking up now uh everywhere it's breaking up now it's all falling apart amen praise God the next morning the snow had let up the sun come out and all the people from the gay parties with their snacks in their hands and sucks sorry on their uh in on in their hands and on their heads too much drinking celebration remember they're claiming to celebrate the birth of Christ oh my horse many of them from carrying on oh but way down in the alley they found the old man and when they turned him over he had that little doll right next held right next to his heart I suppose that's the way he was able to take his gift to his daughter but he kept his promise he took his gift to that girl Prophet says I suppose he found her he found her in a better land not here but in that land beyond the river oh thank God there's a land beyond the river Hallelujah that we call the sweet forever amen we shall meet again brother sisters we shall meet again praise the Lord amen glory to God hallelujah think of it he brought that gift and he took that gift and no doubt thunder in that land not here but over there Hallelujah yet by taking bringing that gift to her it cost him his death and if we make no point there tonight it cost the Lord Jesus Christ his death he was despised rejected Compton as a in the street that he might bring to us the gift of eternal life Hallelujah and that's why we are here tonight rejoicing in the Lord because we received the greatest gift what appeared to them to be a dirty rag doll what appeared to them to just be a religious thinking and religious thought and religious ideas and Fantasies and affection and justice story it's reality to us who are True Believers of this word of the Living God hallelujah amen oh my think of it you see oh what you see understand here a doll didn't mean much to them um some dirty face doll what why did he do it it fulfilled the promise that he made why did the Lord have to do it because it fulfilled the promise that he he made a lamb without spot or wrinkle that he would let down his life for all of his children all of our sins that he might forgive us of our eliquities as the scripture says praise the name of the Lord hallelujah no matter what the people thought about it no matter what they thought he died to fulfill his promise to his girl Amen to his child to his children he died to fulfill his promise glory to God and that's the way it is and I'm going to be closing this out praise God hallelujah sometimes they'll look upon the gospel that's just a wonderful time for singing a wonderful time for playing right there is there they don't really want it see oh my it's gone into just music and singing and wonderful religious but out of line with the word of God we supposed to Rejoice we're supposed to have music we should have a wonderful time but we should know what we are doing what we are singing about what we're praising God for and I thank God for those people and groups amen that know what they're doing hallelujah praise God Paul said if you say Psalm say it with understanding you're singing sing with your understanding praise God do it with your understanding glory to God hallelujah amen but it fulfilled you see God did the same thing amen when God brought it it fulfilled him a promise that he had made that he would give to us his only begotten son Hallelujah that they would put him and beat him to a rag doll on a cross by his stripes we are healed praise God they beat him their blood in him until he was like a ragdoll on that cross but God proved to us that he loves us so much that he would die for our sins Glory God hallelujah amen you know what they left him to die on that cross just like that on the street you left him to die like that on the street and today they treat him his word like a on the street outcasts too simple it looks like nothing like a you know what's that about and if but he fulfilled what he was supposed to do on this word this revealed word will fulfill what it's supposed to do it's not us we're not trying to work something up make a movement make some church or grow some denomination or grow a church or make a name or make riches or fame or no sorry we are just letting one let God have his wonderful way and let this word work out its Divine Purpose for his glory and honor hallelujah amen see oh they treat him today like a on the street but he fulfills what he is supposed to do for he was the gift that God promised to the world and God gave him to us tonight let us take him as our savior praise God let us take him all you who may be hearing me in the lands of the internet take him really take him Embrace him accept him as your lord and savior amen into your heart amen and you can then walk in the face of death and say Lord I promise my life to you amen it goes the other way now we promise our life to you we let our life for you we stand upon your word amen and I am going to take this life to him praise God I'll take it to him no matter what I have to go through what I have to pass through even if I have to go through death I'm taking this life to him will you take your life to him even if I have to be shot if I have to be laughed at I have to be called crazy even if they have to excommunicate you from your from your church whatever it is if you are to be excommunicated from the rest of them Christian churches let me tell you for you to receive this it's the gift of God and you hold it within your heart and I want to take back that gift to him praise God that's what we are here for and tonight let us pray as we bring this service to a close with this simple wonderful Christmas Parable may it be a blessing to your heart and to
