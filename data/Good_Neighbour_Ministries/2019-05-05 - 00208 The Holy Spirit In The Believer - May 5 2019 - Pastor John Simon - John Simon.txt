TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] on the lord state - given brains and on HBC them you are welcome here - a good paper of ministries here happy let me love you me in the house of God before we continue with the rest of the service we have the education of baby Jesus Christ and we do have the dedication of this wonderful wonderful me Rebecca and Orin we invite them to come to the front and all friends family members those who wish to identify themselves fit them we certainly welcome you here to take God's grace [Music] we are in the life of the friends family grandparents we know very well brother Desmond and sister Elizabeth we have did all of you here in house of God I see other team player at the night here also to see every one of you anyway we are happy certainly happy and rejoicing to be here in the house of the Lord and we are we are inspired and encouraged that they are still people that will bring their child into for a blessing and to start their life right maybe or roughly run off track and everything else but the Bible says if you start to write even if a strain they'll come right back on track after one and right so I would make that clear here to be that every parent has a part to play we're not here to just print children adopt them to the world and leave them and war ways but we have a part to play with in their life and education or christening is not an epochal event or a bottling the child to the church or to anybody you will have your position as parents once you were just a young man she was just a young woman but with the birth of children you become a father and she becomes a their rule changes these are the changing seasons of life that we all experience now you must recognize that and I throw back your instrument of God for us to bring forth each other and now your instrument of God to raise this child in the fear of God to protect to provide and to train this channel we have our part negatively so you are coach this is not basketball this is not a game it's not a good life that you have in your hand and God has called you all of all the people who were really chose you to be the trainer of this job and the Bible is treatment the child one day young so that when they get older she's paying attention to be here right they were not from the way so really happy for this position I trust that you voluntarily accepted by proportion or because you feel that you have to do it but because it's in your heart amen now the script right coaches in proverbs 22:6 train up a child in the way they should go and when they are old they will not depart from it but if you have a trainer a child the way they should go that means you go away it assumes the fact that you know the way because that's the way you will be able to train the child remember when Jesus was Miss young and and Mary came and said said to him but we were seeking you I had the father was seeking you and turtley was he was a challenge discipline it was God in flesh he said woman not senior who was speaking to us from the chatter speaking how does God speak with truth and same woman so to know I must be about my father's business I've gotta carry out God's business right so you've got to carry on God's business you know and you see Lamberton son's business simplified so this is God in sight and God chose you to be one of his to be able to raise this child for his glory and for his honor now it's a full-time job it's not a part-time job and sometimes going to tax you emotionally and apart because raising a child properly is not cheap it starts from sister baby right up to college and university and I'll tell you right now because have some experience with that it costs a lot of money maybe the Knights wind up the mother and I tried to land there and voila sleep pandemonium child is out there somewhere with their friends they say bye you still wondering what they're sleeping the mother's heart was still tearing and thinking about their child and so the flop think about this job and protect this child in every possible way right that's very important in training the child might be jealous foolishness is bound in the heart of a child but the rod of Correction generated far from him now this is not about time to get to child abuse but we know that we have some direction from our parents and Jews five in middle school and that doctor what is his name is doctor [Music] okay jack some person sees you and this I'm gonna tell you bobak oh my goodness you give me at that school and this good is you call and tell your father that boy that girl does not help you get into school if you only get it again a bunch of wild [Music] training or giving them an outline to live by and yes sir dedication I want to ask you today Orin but if you mess the rapists child is here come good but you remember we best to raise this challenge in the fair job you don't have to know as much as me already got that but you need to know the right way that means that you need to be in some of this book here right praise the Lord very important for you to do that amen hallelujah don't listen to what is that one thing one prophet a number like this up before I formed thee even in your mother's belly I knew and before we came out of the womb I sanctified thee and I ordained thee to be a prophet to the nation's listen to Paul but when please God separated me from my mother's womb and called me by His grace amen hallelujah so God has intentions towards you and towards this child person for you to do your death and the Rays you tell the way he wants you to and the greatness legacy of any child is the memory that they will carry with them throughout life of their models bacon they found out that when they're near hold up in their hands and talking to them I have some of those memories and you say oh the character they can't talk but they did accomplish is there some people like myself that I can remember as far back as when I was treated and when I tell my mother things that when I couldn't hardly talk that I saw and because to me I that's right well I heard you say this is open you know that because even though I couldn't speak they are the tough sponge they start picking the plates in front about the same from them okay Treach what about in front of them all that is very very important but I thought there's a reward for that amen when you do that in the report is regardless at that that when to do that that people reward you in every possible way because when it comes down you say well done thou good thank you sir enter into the joy of your Lord praise the Lord god bless you just leave my hands of the child pray for the charter and then we have a beautiful certificate that we would like to present to you hoping that you will frame it or keep it somewhere so the men inside is older they're not the way she's our fully aware what's happening now but later on you can explain to them that you have been blessed dedicated in the house of God so they are blessed child dedicated for God's honor and interesting I believe it was sure it would be but her eyes are just upon me so I take the Lord for that gracious Heavenly Father yes it will begin tonight worthless I send him the Prophet laid his hands upon Jesus I'd leave my hands upon this chapter Orion and I'm free in the name of Jesus Christ follow her for all the days of her life and at the end of this journey Leaguers safely yes this is the name of Jesus Christ we pray for these two parents father yes that your hand will be upon your life you know you will lead them home so that they may lead the child and I pray that they will go ahead to this country as you bring them for full revelation of understanding of who you are and who they are in their position we ask this blessing as we dedicate this child in Jesus [Music] [Applause] god bless you sir ulcer I have to stab them here [Music] we're here [Music] the rest of the surface they're believers that are away from the church now this brand gotta keep them safe random signal to pass to us for his glory of God now let's turn in our Bibles chapter 1416 oh dear God our gracious Heavenly Father we come to thee by the way of Prayer we come to the saints of God washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and we may abide with you forever the world cannot receive because it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the receivables [Music] revelation he says you want revelation where the Texan then watch at Brighton see there you are that's the thing you ought to look for right
