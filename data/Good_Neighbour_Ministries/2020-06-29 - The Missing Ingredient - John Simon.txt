========================================
[Music] good morning friends it's good to be in the house of God and on another beautiful Sunday morning giving praise honor and worship to his glorious and marvelous name today I would like to speak on the subject the missing ingredient now some years ago I read in a book where this woman made a beautiful cake a lovely cake for her husband mixed it lovingly and prepared it baked it and then brought that cake after hit a cooled to her husband giving him a healthy slice of that cake and so he sat down to enjoy that cake but with his first bite and began to chew it his face changed color and as sensitive as she was she said what's wrong honey what's wrong is something wrong he said well it it's a beautiful cake it's it's just lovely no faulting that that is just great but the taste there there's something missing there's something missing from it it's you know a cake is supposed to have to be sweetened this has no taste whatsoever she said oh my god I forgot to put in sugar oh my and so the sugar was that missing ingredient I would like to speak about that today let us pray and read from the book of Judges our gracious God and Heavenly Father we ask for help from heaven may the great holy spirit empower us to speak your word Lord anoint your word to you to the hearts and minds of the people that you and persons you have prepared to hear and to receive this send forth thy light on thy truth in this hour in the midst of the darkness Lord and lighten and brighten every corner of every heart in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord who may love and serve amen and amen blessed be his holy name now I want to show the importance of having this person of the Blessed Holy Spirit in our lives in our homes and in our churches and also in and across our nation praise be to God hallelujah now we know my friends that the story of Samson is found in the book of Judges chapters 13 to 16 there you'll find the story of Samson now in Samson we see a tape a picture are a representation of Israel a backslidden nation he is also a type for us sad picture of our backs modern church world and also a picture of a backslidden believer that has wandered off from the Word of God Samson was born in or around 1004 DC he was the son of man or a tenant and his wife they hadn't in the visitation and also instruction from the angel of God who had appeared to them and instructed them about Samson's birth his growth and instructions of his eating habits and social habits all about his upbringing he was to be a Nazarite that does that does not mean he has to be born in Nazareth but the Nazarite meaning to be a separated one one separated holy unto God and under God's service now while Samson was young he lived and what obediently by the word of God's angel messenger for his time but as he became older as many people do when they're in the church in the message in the word as they become older in the years go by many began to wonder away from God's Word now here in our text which I will read at this particular time found in the book of Judges chapter 16 a belief it's verse 20 verse 18 and when Delilah's saw that he had told her all his heart she sent and called for the Lords of the Philistines saying come up this once for he had showed me all his heart then the Lords of the Philistines came unto her and brought money in their hand she may be and she made him sleep upon her knees and she called for a man and she caused him to shave off this seven lots of his head and she began to afflict him and his strength went from him and she said the Philistines be upon thee Samson and he awoke out of his sleep and said I will go out as at other times before and shake myself and he was not that the Lord was departed from him I'm going to use the last part of that text and he was not that the Lord had departed from him the missing ingredient now in this picture that we read we find Samson in the seductive arms of a harlot of Surak named Delilah whose name is inscribed in history's Hall of Shame she's a type of revelation 17 Mystery Babylon the then the mother of harlots and she also my friends is a description of the daughters of the harlot the harlot herself a symbol of this great pagan Roman ISM and the Protestants the daughters of and products of that Romanism even though they make themselves or call themselves Protestants now my friends four times in the scripture she enticed Samson and diced him to reveal the secret of his strength on three of these occasions she was absolutely unsuccessful but on the fourth occasion she became successful she succeeded and the scripture says chapter 16 verse 18 and she made him sleep upon her knees she loved him to sleep this harlot this organization this Mystery Babylon this denominational spirit learn loved him to sleep maybe sang and low voice lullaby and not to startle him but to have him just fade slowly going off into sleep and while he fell into a deeper and deeper sleep as the Satan has done to the modern church world today though the church to sleep giving her a self a sense of satisfaction a sense of having religious pleasure at God's expense but there she was with his head of all her knees and she loved them to sleep awake let's sleep us and come to the light on Christ will give you life nevertheless the Bible says when he was fast asleep she called for a man called for a preacher confrim man to shave off all of the the seven locks that were upon his head of course we know those seven locks are representative but we will not speak about that at this time those Lots represented his straight they represented the perfect Word of God that God had given to him and that represents the perfect Word of God for our day and our time that has come down to us through seven Church ages and open to us by the opening of the seven seals the fullness of the word of God is made known to his elect to his hidden ones to his chosen ones the word of God has been made known and we feel to them now she felt at that particular time when she had him lulled to sleep and his lots shaven off that him being defenseless now she could make a mock of him now she could attack him now she can pull him and bring him down to shame and she cried out the Philistines me upon this answer and the Bible recourse let I will go out as at other times he woke up briefly and he rose up my god and I said I go out as I did in the past in other words just like how I told that lion just the way and you know I I defeated thousands of these Philistines I will out again as in days of old and there you'll find that these things recorded in judges chapter 14 verse 6 verse 19 chapter 15 verse 14 you will find this phrase or similar and the Spirit of the Lord came upon Samson and Samson toward the lion as if it were a kid you've framed it that he picked up a jawbone of an ass and the Spirit of the Lord came upon Samson and he defeated every one of them my friends here in the scriptures three times we are finding this phrase and similar that it was the Spirit of the Lord that came upon Sansa that made him what he was in the eyes of the world at that particular time no doubt being loved to sleep with self-satisfaction and difference to God's work God's will and God's Way as the mother church he began to feel that he doesn't need to wait on the spirit but all he has to do is to shake himself and the world and the Spirit of the Lord will once again come upon him and use him but the Bible makes an arresting statement but he wished not the scripture says but he was not which means but he knew not but he did not recognize he was in other words unaware that the Spirit of God have already took its light the Spirit of God the dove of peace had left him took its flight and gone away from him and he was left to his own devices Sampson unaware of the departure of the holy spirit so what's the nation of Israel unaware of the Parcher of the Holy Spirit for the Bible tells us in those days there no Kings rule there was no king and every man did that which was right in his own sight I believe we're back to that again my friends where people are just doing what they feel what they think or what they like with their own series their own platitudes precepts their own thoughts and uh and just push aside the old family Bible get rid of the scriptures would listen to the Bible except to hear it as glorious literature poetry or great books of architecture zoology science whatever in whatever approach they would like to take to the Bible that's the approach they will take and see it in that light not recognizing it in it the pure infallible word of the Living God that's been given to us his people at this thing unaware think of it now here is stands with one ingredient one important and essential ingredient missing from his life the presence of the person of the Holy Spirit my friends I tell you in the name of Jesus Christ without the Holy Spirit a bother lies his personal presence his leadership his teaching and his control we are lost without him for he is our guide to guide us from earth to glory my friend praise God hallelujah no looking up on Samson Samson looked just the same as he was the day before he came to that harlots tent he have the same muscles the same physique and stature but there was something missing it was the presence of the power and person of the Holy Spirit the action and activity of the Holy Spirit in his life to empower him to anoint him to lead him to guide him and to point in the right way he turned away and the Spirit of God come on the glory is departed the Holy Spirit had left him at that time but despite the absence of the Holy Spirit like many of our churches today oh they're not those miracles we saw what we used to see with Gordon Winston and William Brennan man Velma Gardner and that not be granted on Robertson many of the old-timers Kathryn Kuhlman many others we don't see the power of God Aimee Semple McPherson many many honors John Seely we don't see those things anymore we don't see the leadership and guidance of the Holy Spirit as in Smith Wigglesworth anymore oh my friends but now what it takes is for them in this modern day the modern church takes that you kid it can shake itself it has numbers it has great big machinery of muscles it it has organization it has money so we'll go out this as we did before so my friends the Church of today believes that again in the absence of the presence and power and activity of the Holy Spirit in her lips she believes that she can fight against Satan sin and human suffering and the leads that all she has to do it do is to shake self and say who I'm under that the baptism of the Holy Spirit I'm under the anointing and that's all she has to do and speak in towns and dance the floor and run around them beliefs that she has the victory like that and she can go out as in the days of old of Sousa Street revivals she believes that that's all she has to do but something is missing something is missing me honest be true to yourself recognize the day that we are living in the atmosphere that we are worshiping in and the things that we are doing and we can recognize something is happening something is missing and everyone is competing with the other to shake itself find some new system or some new way to be able to shake itself and believes it can go out and have a local church revival that when there was real Holy Ghost revivals the revival will be miles away people were persons will come in on the train to attend the revival they would get off the river off of the train and many would start falling on the platform many will be Laughing crane repenting getting here turning of God I'm talking none of a church driven up revival I'm talking about a heaven-sent revival and the break the sentence power not just on one life but across the entire nation across the that a town across a city and take that city innocence in his grip and rip it apart Samson did and that the power of God and the reigns of the Holy Spirit fall upon the people and change their lives forever for the glory God hallelujah how wonderful to know that he is the same yesterday today and forever I'm happy to recognize this truth in the word of God in him and so my friends I want to say you can't warm yourself at a painted fire many of our modern-day churches a train to sail their ship their gospel ship on yesterday's wind or breeze it would work my friends there's something missing and it's that genuine true Holy Ghost amen they're praying for it they're asking for it they want to have it and when he comes up on the scene that they refuse the Holy Spirit for this age and for this hour as was thought manifested without a doubt manifested and vindicated 100% by God's messenger and prophet William Aaron Brabham and they rejected the Holy Spirit and the Word of God for the hour that was with him and in him and turned it down and still believes all they have to do is pause and shake themselves looking back to their past looking back back to their fundings and of the tale of their great history and tenth of their great stories of what happened when their organization or denominational the other nations began all my friends it's not what happened back then that's den and this is now and my friends we must realize and ask God for what years do it now lost into the in the past are wonderful we enjoy hearing listening and receiving them but our focus should be even what is God doing now in US and through us for his glory and for his honor no amount of shaking of yourself of dreaming of revivals church sponsored revivals will bring back another Pentecost another move of God that will shake the devil from the front his truck right down to the soles of his feet and cast him out from the house of God out of the temple of the Living God my friends I tell you we fight here today the picture of this modern church like that drunken man that just woke up from his sleep and is trying to shake himself so that he might come to his true senses he is not in a sense as he has some senses but he hasn't come to his full senses and so he's shaking himself trato you know come to his senses my friends that will not work you may need the presence and power of the genuine Holy Spirit not some man-made made-up only spirit the disciples asked for help when their ship was sinking Lord save us with perish but they want the Holy Spirit to come according to their desire and their quantification whatever they believe he should do for them not to tell them anything that will make them uneasy not to be able to really tell them the truth but to tickle their ears and to make them feel wonderful but instead the Bible tells us in the darkness while upon their ship the Spirit of God Jesus came walking water and the answers to their prayer the desired photo for the parable Jesus Christ to deliver them from the storm that was coming against them and when they saw him coming it is oh it's a ghost and the Bible said they were sore afraid of the very thing that could save them I believe that has happened in our age and one day you come to realize that the ministry of wisdom Marian Burnham wants them angel messenger knocked on the door and his wife back there but to the church world here to call out his bride his chosen wants his elected and separated ones to call them to attention of his word one day you'll come back around and realize that he was right he is right and will always be great for what he said was not his words it was thus saith the Lord in other words it was God speaking through that man and saying listen this is not william branham speaking this is the lord speaking through him for the Spirit of God speaks true the prophet of the Living God so here we see Samson's same muscles same machinery same physique modern dead church great organization huge buildings great things trying to shake itself and to live by yesterday's fire I tell you if some of those founders of these various churches and denominations were to come back and to see what was taking place in these groups and churches and organizations that they founded their will they'll scream and cry as we used to attend there there may be in their graves if there's such a thing but my friends not there will not stand for what is happening in the various denominations regardless of its strength regardless of its name regardless of who it is and what it is not even being true to their own faith to their own founders their own funding to their own foundations they have shifted off their foundation and are walking contrary to the Word of God and a servant of the Living God she commanded back to the word back to the Bible after the original faith God is calling his people and his church back to the faith of our fathers living still in spite of all the fire on the sword all of the persecution him had prayed friends Samson behold the Philistines are upon the Church of the Living God wake up worldliness is upon you my role Samson tried to shake himself to get the mini man-made revival by shaking himself but it didn't work he wanted the world and do battle with dog demons thus Philistine spirits lost man at that time but we fight not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and spiritual wickedness and the rulers of darkness of this world and that modern date church is going out in equipped missing the presence and power of the great Holy Spirit yes they'll say we have it but the evidence is not their numbers money organization Business Administration marketing public relations that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about the power of the presence of the Holy Spirit coming down upon village a town a city or a nation and man will have to subject what is this what's going on what does this mean and the Apostle Hester said this is that spoken by the prophet of Malachi 4:5 that God promised that he will pour out his spirit bought former and latter rain coming together the teaching rain and the harvest rain combined together forming upon the Church of God and the glory of the latter house all my friends greater than that of the former what a season what a time back to your original faith back to the Word of God listen to the message of this hour go back and read the writing sir hear the tapes of William Frantz him and it will shape you to your roots under your foundation and you will realize and recognize that man was speaking nothing but the truth amen yes sir here we are trained to work to do battle trying to come against the Philistines in his own strength he had the physical night and the machinery main us the missing ingredient of the Spirit of God doesn't this not bring to mind Zechariah chapter 4 verse 6 not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord yes the church today trying to battle against Satan using human knowledge using psychology psychiatry using all the various ologies whether it's tea ology humor Harmon eunuch sir another technology technology in and all these things trying to fight Satan with Trentham but greek interpretations and and and ira make and hebrew and and and debates over these matters and trying to find satan with that you are defeated before you you have you started you cannot fight and defeat satan upon those grounds because satan is a being or spirit that is over six thousand years old in ancient evil wisdom and do you believe that you will compete with him but your puny human wisdom against him you cannot do it but with God's help you can with God's power you can with the Holy Spirit in you you can the genuine Holy Spirit for he has said in my name they are cast out devils and casting out Devils is casting out the unbelief out of the heart of that person first of all before any other thing praise God hallelujah think of it Samson was laid up captive he found himself in a bind and being in a bind he was made blind and be made blind and in a bind the Philistines made him to grind he had a hard life trying to go back to that anointing that power and presence of God that was upon his life and so the Philistines had a great feast a feast of celebration to celebrate their capture of Samson I believe even now with the behavior of a modern church Satan is having a celebration in the pits of hell demons are dancing salomi is dancing the lion is dancing the members of mystery and then I'm having a brick party time all them great performers that did not heed the Word of God and maybe was famous upon the earth where are they now maybe they're dancing but it's where they're dancing they're dancing because it may be too hot furred like a Cat on a Hot Tin Roof they can't stop now because the heat is on oh brother sister he's the voice of God the Word of God for this hour rip come to God if you're backslidden turn back turn back and come to God he'd receive you with open arms he loved you and open up his word and reveal it to you and your strength will return your street will come again your life will be renew your walk will be led by him guided by him and ordered your footsteps will be ordered by the Lord Himself and so they have the great celebration the party was in swing and so here comes Samson let bhaiyya allowed a young boy until a young telogen a page here he was the leader of Samson imagine a great warrior Church a brain anointed Church that defeated every devil and every demon and every power that comes its way and always took it stand upon the old fashioned Word of God now has to be led by some theological dandy on the floor of celebration mockery jesting and called upon to do all kinds of tricks oh just as they did with Jesus when he was on the cross tell us who hit you we know you have the gift of discernment why don't you tell us who hit you know your platform and why don't you tell so hit you but God it's Paris doesn't show off God is not a performance he's not there to show off his power but the shines love for his people to deliver his people Oh to put his arms around his people and for them to know he's real so he they're dopes could be settled as the song said and they can say I know I know this is real no matter what they that the priest told me no matter what the bishop told me no matter what this great authority figure told me I'm known for myself in my heart it's real for it's been revealed to me and I see the presence and the hand of God making himself known to me this great warrior they live like that here we see the picture of a bound and blinded and defeated church of the last day a modern day Church kept you captivated by and focused on religious performances religious entertainment for pleasing the audience and with a motive of filling every seat within the building focus on bringing them back wanting them to come back again to church to receive more not realizing than in the Bible sometimes God allows blessed subtractions because when his perilous presence countless parts displayed many times it's not only in healing but many Liars are sometimes struck down dead many had their sight and will try to blaspheme in the presence of God one dead blind even for a season yes sir and great the Bible tells us in the book of Acts and great fear came upon the people yes sir and many of them never came back why this was real this was not a job this was not a musical entertainment this was not something that made you feel nice you were on day on the edge of your pew my friends I have literally seen nah not just in my preaching but I've seen it in other preachers other places me reminded of God where the devil moving up on the middle cut knots tender peasants of Almighty God and just ran out they could not take the Word of God in the presence on an atmosphere of that blessed Holy Spirit it's real friends it's real the days of miracles are not past the days of Acts is not pass the Holy Spirit now wants to write another book of Acts acting true you acting through anyone that will surrender themselves completely and fully into hand humble ourselves be reverent be faithful and God will bless you will lead you and guide you and bring you to the fullness of what you have read within this Bible many of our churches have lowered themselves - pandering and and preaching a simpering gospel in a party light atmosphere flashing lights of multicolored lights jazzy Christian rock music backed up by this multicolored smoke and mirrors and that all day religious tinsel and religious razzle-dazzle and then turn around and call that the Holy Spirit and when that happens there is hardly any difference between the world and its worthiness and with a church that's trained to display the supernatural Pauline s sanctification of the presence of God in her nest and in the life of those believers and when there is that kind of atmosphere the only difference between a rock band and a rough party in a rut entertainment is that one is singing the word his sons with worldly lyrics and the other one is doing similarly the same thing with religious words religious lyrics religious sounds upon it and that's all it's this guy's on the jazzy stuff all the rock stuff all this guy's under the clothing of Christian lyrics and religious terminology and so proud the same worldly music I'm not saying that you cannot have music in the church that has some life to it that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about that you know it I don't have to explain it you'll know the difference if you're filled with the Holy Spirit my friends they wanna use religious lyrics to make it acceptable to people and palatable to to those of some of the old-fashioned believers that wants to hold on to God's unchanging hand for God's Word does not change inviting so-called Christians and truthless Christian comedians Christian magicians into the house of God the devil mocking the church through these various kinds of activities performing within these churches improperly dressed men half-dressed women in every part and every aspect of church some church sex sin and seduction a script in to the presence of God in the atmosphere of the Church of the Living God as the scripture has said sin Crouch at your door sin is waiting at your door to pounce upon you o friend what are our what a team that we are living in what's taking place here upon the face of the earth now that unsaved unbelieving bonsaint celebrities are now allowed to step into the puppets the stand behind God's sacred desk all with the motive of enhancing Church profile the church profile in the community for everyone to know that this is a high-class church to which celebrities dignitaries jeweled ladies and and you know marvellous successful powerful money men come to and create that atmosphere and reputation increasing their numbers and with them focus of amassing great fortunes and great wealth the Philistines be upon thee Samson you left your first love remember from whence you are fallen remember your beginnings remember your origins return go back to where you started recapturing Kindle that heat the passion the zeal of your first life back to God back to the Bible back to the original thing your fingers your the old men of God whether it be William Booth or or or this one or that one I call all the names of wasps man godly man anointed by the Holy Spirit would be ashamed if they came back to see what was taking place within these groups that they started some of them never even intended for the groups to become denominations but they turn them into denominations which is to make themselves a defender of the faith to build walls around themselves we've become Christian fortifications and they're holding the fort for jesus is coming we'll hold the fort for I am coming this we called the home before we're called to break down the walls we are called to come to him and know him to know pinta is the no life eternal and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery when that revelation of the word of God through his tricks you all the Watchmen on the walls of Zion will see eye to eye not by debate and strife not by fending and proving not by debate or an argument tension not my logic didactic or what otherwise but by my friends the union of the holy spirit and harmony of the Holy Ghost in the life of the true believer that walks with him and talks with him every day of their life and no because of this the modern church has left off from the principles of the word of God and Satan has invaded the church where it's now filled with hot stirs and religious conman marketers selling in the temple all manner of religious products and puffin elia being sold in the name of Christ on the cross and going for making men and women to fall more a child of hell I tell you wake up Samson the Philistines be upon you come to yourself recognize who you are come back to the Word of God made a deep call to the deep and may the deep respond here that they con men tricksters and I must say it outright fraud artists playing God's people forgetting and fame at any cost also many false prophets have gone out into Matthew 24 Jesus prophesied these false prophets will be here in the land deceiving and being deceived preaching preaching popularity Fame but not blood not preaching about the blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin not even preaching about shame they'll talk about bad habits they'll talk about don't do those bad things that was evil things are cultured in such palatable soft acceptable terms not true not with the words of a true son or daughter of God not being irresponsible either but speaking the truth in love that the Word of God may go forth here we find that friends that they want and many of these would even use the word hell they would preach about health oh the preach about health lose my ministry the people will leave the church the offerings will go down headquarters are going to get me out of here I can't use that word that's an old-fashioned word I can only say that you will be sent to a bad place or order leave them say well hell is living a bad life while you're here alert I'll tell you you get your deathbed and feel death rattling and your Trump and there's not time for you saying or doing anything you'll know that you'll be too late then my friend give your life to Christ now while there is yet time to give your life to him and know him in the power of his resurrection these have diluted and perverted and subversive the true fate of the Word of God these beautiful whited warm churches have become infested with demons let you 13:31 the 32 the Bible says God's tree has become a nesting birds revelation the tree in its maturity revelation 18 1 2 4 describe that tree as a habitation Mystery Babylon and on habitation of unclean spirits and fowl Birds and so late Samson the church has become a prisoner of the world and now has to perform a bunch of religious tricks and making religious seals to entertain them and now the churches are trying to outdo each other with that trying to get the attention in the world trying to get the praise of men and praise of the world and anything to get themselves in the newspapers on TV or in the seat of government occupied with an insatiable desire for wanting to be seen and praised of men but the true church was not called to be successful not in the worldly sense but the church was called by God to be faithful be thou faithful unto death and I will give you a crown of life if that feed that not away my friends here we find you say brother Simon you seem to have a dark world view of this modern church yes I do because I read and fully understood and was properly taught about Laodicea and Revelation chapter 3 how she will become a different self-satisfied lukewarm and must don't increase with God God's reach and must now not your wretched naked blind and like Sam some other where and not not not aware of what has really happened and is happening in the Church of the Living God the Bible crazy when the dark comes come to me and by I saw so that your eyes will be opened that you can recognize not just sing the song open the eyes of my heart Lord ins has a nice religious but actually really cry out to God and ask him to open the eyes of your heart not the church not to your church fundamentals not to your church doctrines don't worry binders on your eyes but to the full word of God whatever God wants to reveal to you that you will see it through the eyes of your heart in the fullness of the Holy Spirit and so the mother church has become a stumbling block to many outside like Samson housing all having on the physical muscles powers machinery might numbers money but the genuine Holy Spirit is gone that glory of God has departed he was not by the Spirit of God had departed from from him the church appealing for more and more money instead of more honey when Jacob sons were going into Egypt to meet with their brother Joseph their father gave them some money and they were rushing up the door to start their journey and had to he had tell them no you also need to take some honey and some other spices we need to have the full fruits of the spirit we need to have the virtues of the Holy Spirit and the Word of God in its fullness pouring out and living in the Church of God for this last name all friends attend new friends what must the church do together to this bind the churches in the church needs to repent sincerely repent I know the work repent is used over and over until it's become the devil of literally like normal eyes if it doesn't meet much the people but a genuine repentance not betray eyes but wear those blended eye-sockets but pour down tears of sorrow and repentance and say Lord I'm coming home I'm coming home never more to Rome oh Jesus the entire church and the individuals preachers also come fullness and cast themselves at the feet of the Lord Jesus Christ my friends no matter how dirty it becomes God never leaves himself without a witness he always has a faithful few he always has a little flock he always has his hidden wants they're hidden and yet they're everywhere they're in this message there in the denominations they're eating from Jezebel steagle but yet they're hid from the from the from the world some are still in Mystery Babylon and the organizations and the crying must all come out of her my people and be not partakers of our sins back to the Bible may God bring us back to the old time Holy Spirit the parent God the manifestations of the word of God in our lives and bring that missing ingredient back in the house of God and in the Church of God we need supernatural activity of the Holy Spirit in God's church where liars are struck down where many who are unqualified step up to take the Lord's Supper and are shut down by the presence of God except they examine themselves then great fear will come upon the church that this is not some story to be told this is not fun this is not a joke this is a real living God who lives and moves and reigns now and forevermore we have serve our God bring the church back that when the church praise was present doors open lay men walk praise God and the Word of God began to spread and multiply not dependency and marketing systems and assimilation and psychological systems and the teaching of psychology and that sort of stuff my friends in a book of of Acts where the Holy Ghost fell they didn't need any of those things in one day three thousand came to Christ and over you will read it in various chapters all the talk was God deciding to come on the scene by the cries and the prayers and repentance of his people which are called by his name and to come on the scene and that he is the answer for Jesus is the answer to all our warnings he is the answer to all that needs my friends may God help us in these closing days of time as the old song says it's the all time Holy Spirit and that devil will go near it that's the reason people fear it but it's goodie enough for me oh give me that old-time religion get me of that old-time religion god bless you my friends let us pray Oh gracious help me father we thank you for your word we take you for the great Holy Spirit taking all the show ship all the tricks all the Hollywood tinsel and their religious razzle-dazzle over the church and bring your church back to the fullness of the Word of God Oh God bring us back to the Holy Ghost and power and a manifestation of the word Lord God once more let us see the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ walking up and down through the church
