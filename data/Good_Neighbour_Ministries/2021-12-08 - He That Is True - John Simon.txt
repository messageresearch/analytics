TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] welcome friends it's so good to be back in the presence of the lord and to share with you the wonderful things of god certainly with joy let us together draw water fresh water from the wells of salvation may the holy spirit be with us and bless us in every possible way our scripture for today is found in the book of revelation chapter 3 reading verse 7 and to the angel of the church in philadelphia write these things saith he that is holy that is true he that had the key of david he that opened it and no man shut it and shut it and no man open it thank god for his wonderful words of life let us pray our gracious loving and eternal heavenly father thou great eternal being that inhabits all eternity and every living thing we praise and magnify your great and holy name may the spirit of almighty god from you so anoint me that i may speak thy word lord freely with the great oils of the holy spirit to thee be the praise the honor and the glory we are here to glorify your name and to magnify it together both speaker and hearers oh god grant those who have faith that their faith may grow and increase and to those father who are not aware that they have this faith may you stir up the seed of life that is within them pour upon it the waters of life bring it into germination and into manifestation for your glory and honor this day we ask it in the name of jesus christ with thankful hearts amen and amen here we are today and this is another study in the church age series we are now at the sixth church age better known as the philadelphian church age how beautiful were the words of our text that we just read how majestic are the declarations of scripture it speaks of several attributes he that is holy he that is true he that had the key of david think of it all these wonderful attributes are applied to one person hallelujah my friends one person and we know that one person is jesus christ our lord jesus christ the lord of glory the one who came to earth this one with an ever living story to yesterday today and forever glory to his name now the key to interpreting these wonderful descriptive phrases that speaks of jesus christ himself will find some help in verse 9 of revelation chapter 3 says here behold i will make them of the synagogue of satan which or who say they are jews and are not but do lie behold i will make them come and worship before thy feet and to know that i have loved thee of course this refers uh particularly to jesus christ and all the believers that are a part of him also that are mock that are scuffed at in our day and in our time god says at the end of this all i will make them to fall down before thee and to wash it before thy feet i will not touch on that because to worship means you're a part of him that's the reason why they'll have to fall down before you and recognize your bridehood part of you in christ hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord amen now this is speaking about how the jews look upon themselves and call themselves children of god but when they do that they do that in exclusion to everybody else yep they're the ones that crucified and killed the lord jesus christ the this terrible deed brought their own blood upon their own heads for centuries all because they refused and still refuse jesus christ as their messiah the jehovah of the old testament manifested in flesh given an earthly name jesus that he might become familiar and unknown of men my friends here it is to them they called him beelzebub in other words they called them someone unrighteous unfit to fill this marvelous role that they had in their hearts but indeed the scriptures declared to us he was emmanuel he was the word made flesh he was their messiah that they were waiting for but they did not recognize their day nor the fulfillment of scripture in their day and in their hour he was god manifested in the flesh he was the messiah come to earth jesus christ the mighty ever living one amen and now here he is this same jesus and he jesus the great holy one that walked around the left stands of revelation 1 manifesting his divine glory through all the ages showing himself walking up and down with the seven stars in his hand oh praise god forevermore here he is the same one who walked the great shores of the blue galilee the one who walk with your pressed up and the possessed and heal the sick and raise the dead amongst them the one who in spite of all the uh irrefutable proof that flowed through his life yet was crucified and killed but the proof of himself he raised up in the resurrection and is seated at the right hand of power as messiah on high the jewish people did not call him holy then and they don't call him holy now but he is the holy one he is god's holy one psalm 16 10 says for thou wilt not leave my soul in hell neither will thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption the scripture is right the scriptures are true the scriptures describes him and calls him their holy one now they sought my friend to thought their righteousness were seeking to achieve righteousness by following the law and it failed they thought that by their various works of the law their scrupulous keeping of the law their adherence to the traditions of the law they felt that they would achieve holiness but by the law no man can be made holy for holiness is of the lord first corinthians 1 30 says but of him are ye in christ jesus who of god is made unto us wisdom and holiness or righteousness and sanctification and redemption second corinthians 5 21 that we might be made the righteousness or holiness of god in him my friends it's christ our parish and they refused him so they perished now the men of the age even today are making the same mistake you see those jews back there took refuge in their synagogue form of worship as they take refuge behind their denominational forms of worship their traditional religious frames and forms of worship so here in this philadelphia church age they were taking refuge in the church but it is not joining a church that comes for the life is not in the church the life is in christ life in the sun life in this ever-living one hallelujah this is the record that god has given us eternal life and this life is in his son he that at the sun life and he that had not the son had not life man human being or or any human being any mortal can only be made holy by the spirit of god any mortal my friends for is the spirit of holiness that raised christ from the dead that same spirit of holiness will raise the true believer from the dead glory to god hallelujah and thank god now he indwells us he lives in me he lives in me oh praise the god of heaven and earth that he lives in me and has made us holy with his holiness we have no holiness of our own we have no perfections of our own we have no virtues of our own he is the one who indwells us and by indwelling us he produces his holiness he bears his own fruit and manifests his own virtues and life through us for his glory proving that he is the one that lives behind this veil the any true believing veil for his glory here he stands jesus christ the holy one amen glory to god he we will stand with him in that day clothed in white leaning amen for we walk with him through this world in white and now we are clothed with the purity of righteousness holiness of the living god as we have identified with him and as the bride has returned to his side to her rightful position in christ we stand with him we stand with him now we stand with him when he comes again will stand with him when he stands there in his greatness of his power glory to god hallelujah amen this six age in the eyes of god it was coming to a close the doors of time are closing fast the book of time is closing fast yes he's coming back jesus is coming back our lord has returned to earth again the word has returned to earth again and soon the cry goes forth here he comes the mighty one hallelujah for the lord himself shall descend with a shout has descended will descend with a shout glory to god a message that will raise you up in the latter day your faith in the word of god is what raises you up that token fate that small teeny weeny bit of faith even if it's a mustard seed revelation within your soul god will use that my friends as a great mighty fulcrum to lift you up raise you up into his divine presence that he might receive his praise and his glory from these vessels that he has prepared a four time and set them upon the earth to use us honorable vessels for his glory amen yes sir the cry is in the book of revelation he which is filthy let him be filthy still he that is righteous let hump him be or her be righteous still he that is holy let him be holy still revelation chapter 22 verse 11 he that is inside let him remain sealed in on the inside and he that is outside let him remain outside for when god shut the door it wasn't law that shut the door or shut the people out of the church out of the word out of the revelation it was god that shut them out and shut noah in that even if he wanted to come back out he could not come out for he was sealed unto the day of his redemption as we are in this hour god blinding the eyes of the heart of some and opening the eyes of the heart of others hallelujah and sealing us in he seals us in unto until and until the day of our redemption oh praise god forevermore so we are not kept by ourselves or our works we are kept by the power of god true faith amen hallelujah i'm so glad that my holiness the holiness that god speaks of in his word is not of my holiness my makings my workings or my doings not of myself but i'm glad that i was elected to be in christ inside of the great pattern work of god hallelujah i'm glad that i'm in here with him and with all of his other wonderful attributes that are within him attributes that were imparted to us and we receive it with grateful and thankful heart for what he has imparted to us blessed be our god forever blessed be his holy name heaven and earth adores you my heart praises and magnifies the name of the lord our god we praise him in this great day in an hour now the bible tells us in this verse 7 these things said he that is true now this word true is really a wonderful word true because it does not mean true in the sense of being the contrast or the opposite of false we usually say true and false and so it's used as the opposite of false but it i'm not speaking on this from that point of view now look at it from this point of view as given by god's servant and prophet in this day and in this hour praise god true in other words perfect realization you have come to a perfect understanding hallelujah of an idea true meaning coming to a place of perfect realization of an idea in contrast to one who has only a partial understanding or partial revelation of an idea praise god oh my god's logos god's idea god's thoughts that were poured out before the foundation of the world your god either brings you into a perfect realization of it or you are left in the twilight zone of the shadows of understanding of a partial realization that is why many can be christians many can be so-called believers of this very message and their virgins but only having partial realization partial understanding of what god is speaking and saying from his wonderful words now for example in the gospel of john chapter 6 verse 32 jesus said moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father give it you the true bread from heaven let me repeat that my father gave it you the true bread from heaven and you know he went on to say i am the bread of life hallelujah praise god then john 15 1 i am the true vine hallelujah now realize the word true also means real so when he says i am the true vine i am the real vine i am the true bread i am the real bread amen hebrews 9 24 for christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands which are figures of the true amen but into heaven itself to appear in the presence of god for us first john chapter 2 verse 8 now the darkness is past and the true light or real light now shines hallelujah i thank god that the real spirit light that will light up the city has lit up my life and the revelation light of the word of god the deer star from on high has risen within my heart and the light of god is shining brightly within this heart of mind praise god amen in revelation 3 7 this word true is expressing perfect realization against the idea of partial realization in other words my friends just as he presented himself and contrast at the true he that is true to these false jews he presented himself as the reality instead of just being another type he presents himself as this substance not another shadow type or substitution but the reality of the word of god in the words of god's prophet the unfailing reality of the living god here we see him presenting himself as being the ultimate fulfillment of all the types all the shadows all the substitutes he was saying in other words he that is true i am the true i am the fulfillment i am the fullness of all these types shadows and substitutes i am the one they were pointing to oh please god hallelujah amen these were only pointing to him but he is the ultimate reality he that is true or in other words he that is real thank god we don't have to deal with just shadows and live in the shadows of the evening time or the twilight but to walk in the light as he is in the light to walk in the brightness of the shining light of the word of god the effulgence of his glory has come upon us and we are here to glorify and magnify the name of our lord oh glory to god hallelujah now listen friends the antitype contrasted with type we are looking now at him separating himself from the shadows and saying i'm no longer in the shadows i think it's somewhere i'm just remembering the scripture when he tells his disciples i think it's somewhere in john 17 when he said no longer will i speak to you in parables no more in shadows but now i will speak to you plainly i will speak to you in reality and bring to you the fullness of the word of god thank god my sins are gone thank god the light has come the sun is risen up and the gloomy shadows have drifted away praise god hallelujah amen praise god take for example in the bible speaks of the manna from heaven how that god set down angels bread from heaven to the children of israel and even though they at angel's bread type of the angel to each church age they ate angels bread but it did not satisfy them it could not satisfy them for that bread was only good for one day back then in the old testament and it was only good for one church edge to which it was sent it could not be kept because if they added they would become hungry again hallelujah if they held it around not only will they be hungry but it would become contaminated now think of that that in itself to take the looter bringing the pure word and wesley bringing the pure word and each one of those messengers and shortly therein it began to become contaminated even the messenger to the seventh church age his message given out left the scene and his message becoming contaminated with every manner of false teaching doctrine conception idea and personal thoughts that man has injected within the word of god my friends the only thing or person that will keep you balanced dead online front sight and backside lined up is the great holy spirit himself he'll take the author of the book himself to be with you and in you to cause the book to reveal that you might know the path you must take jesus is saying your fathers had bread in the wilderness but they're all dead why that was not the reality that was only a substitute and a shadow but here i am the true or the real bread come to you amen and you're rejecting me the real bread that will feed your soul for men shall not live by these earthly mortal bread but live forever by the bread of life the fullness of the word of god man it was just the type hallelujah the momentum man takes the bread of life jesus christ truly believes that receives it lives by it amen he has eternal life and when he does here is indeed reality for except a man be born again he shall not see he shall not enter the kingdom of god oh my for the reality of the word opens his heart the eyes of his heart brings his soul into his invisible union with christ brings him back to his oneness with god and recognizing who he is where he came from and where he is going praise god hallelujah oh amen amen yes sir here indeed my friends we no longer have to accept partial salvation from partial revelations which we may have received but we can enter into perfect realization by perfect revelation through the word of god and enter into the fullness of our redemption by the spirit of almighty god oh here is the whole of it amen jesus isn't part of god but he is god he is the fullness of god made manifest in this hour no one could deny that when israel was down there uh in egypt they had light yes the amen they had light they passed through the passover night and there was darkness everywhere as the dark age we are passing through now darkness that can be felt evil that can be sensed and felt surrounded them everywhere but yet they had light in the midst of that amen and i believe they're having a celebration soon coming up speaking of this these great lights of which god gave to his people israel they were the only nation and the only people at that time that had the spiritual light of god in their very myths amen whoa when egypt was in darkness egypt's land was in gross darkness but in their homes in their individual lives in their individual homes amen they had lamps they had lights that were shining amen praise god and there was light back then but now the true light has come and is now shining when we are in a spiritual egypt and we have entered into our true house the house of david the house of christ the house of god entering into christ himself and in him is all the light life and power that we may ever need now notice let me illustrate here again how israel had not only natural light as they did in egypt but they had spiritual light when all the other nations walked in darkness for israel had their prophets true prophets of god that prophesied that fort told and told forth what god placed in their hearts and earned their mouths amen and so you had moses and you had the prophets and they brought spiritual light or the light of god by the means of scripture and prophecy amen relative or in other words all they were prophesying was true but it was only pointing to the coming reality of the coming messiah who was to come they were pointing to the cross now we are behind that and we are pointing back to the cross they were pointing to his coming we are pointing back to say he has already come and we are now the beneficiaries of his reaction resurrection by divine revelation from the word of god hallelujah amen now the prophets brought partial realization to them but when jesus come not being a prophet of god but the god of all the prophets and god being his own prophet making himself manifested the reality of what they were believing for abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it and was glad oh praise god my friends any true believer through the ages god count their partial realization he counted righteousness he imputed to them righteousness just as if they were back here and it was already done they already believed to the coming of the messiah and the word of god hallelujah and so they have the same pay or same salvation whether they worked in the morning or their work midday or their work in the late evening hour it was the same salvation same reality came to them by the word of the living god now the fulfillment of the light has come jesus christ the messiah amen amen that glowing word of god that was just glowing points of light through the history and time has now broken forth in the morning light of the day star shining bright as an art wilder's act light shining so bright shining upon us oh praise god bringing to us the clarity the distilled clarity of the word of god through the ages amen through the filter of the of a prophet's mind being used and the word of god hallelujah filtered out to us placed in a storehouse and now we are partakers of that unfailing reality of the living god oh thank god forevermore hallelujah that glowing word has grown into its brightness and shining splendor god manifested among his people emmanuel amen god in flesh appearing praise god now light and life combined and manifested in the fullness of the godhead bodily the godhead in a body jesus christ hallelujah amen glory to god now remember how israel used to take their red heifer and today they're still looking for a red heifer and they will sacrifice her upon the altar for the remission of sins and using the ashes and so on then then we find my friends each year a man would come and do a sacrifice wash and go back but he was only covered his sins were only covered and he had to come back and next year for him to continue being forgiven of his sins but it was not a perfect offering because he had to return back and forth you can read these things in the book of hebrews paul speaks about it how the sinner had to be coming back every year amen and this is what this is what jesus meant when he said if you eat of this bread you'll live forever amen you come and get washed by this blood of christ not the heifer's blood but the blood of christ you if you're washed you don't need to be washed again hallelujah oh praise god hallelujah amen yes sir so here we are crucified jesus christ the perfect one sacrifice for our sins once for all time for all men that will believe hallelujah one sacrifice and it was done certified sealed by the living god for he sat down in finality praise god we receive him in our hearts we thank god for this my friends that we are walking in his righteousness and reality of his word romans 8 2 says for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus had made us free from the law of death and sin you see the shed the shed blood of a heifer or any other animal that was used back then whether pigeon sheep goat women the god that was left to go into the wilderness we use the term today uh scapegoat which is just a short term referring back to that many don't realize it but it was the escaped goat the one that the high priest killed the male and set the female free to escape into the wilderness where she will find her way it's the same way my friends escaped thank god but now my friends jesus christ has died in our place took our place at calvary and we are escaped hallelujah once for all time for all eternity to the glory and praise of the living gods hallelujah amen the jews back then did not want to accept the sacrifice of jesus christ the blood of bulls and goats made nothing perfect amen and to this day we watch i watch with wonder and amazement a jewish attachment the tapes shadows substitutes instead of jesus their real messiah their real sacrifice their real atonement i watch with amazement at these denominational forms not only of synagogue worship cathedral worship denominational worship traditional worship organizational worship trained worship my friends i look with amazement where with a certain amount of religious comfort they seem to accept all these things because it's all coached in religious terms any religious persuasions and religious emotions that seem to draw them into a a spirit a sense of spirituality yet they have not come to the fullness of the real word of god and the manifestation of the truth my friends what they had was once indeed god's ordained method but the whole thing has changed from law to grace it's changed from substitute to substance it's changed from types and shadows to jesus christ he that is true he that is real it's changed to the unfailing reality of the living god in our day in our time jesus christ by the shedding of his own blood put away all sin by offering himself hallelujah praise god and his name his sacrifice his shedding of his blood has made us perfect no animal blood could make us perfect it could only cover for a time but jesus christ his blood once for all set us free from the laws of sin and death glory be to god o praise god hallelujah what about this philadelphia church age what about these are the church ages that have passed did they accept the fullness reality in christ no sir no sir for they were only they only were allowed to see remember shadows types were god's ordained metal method until the reality and the fullness came thus luther and all the other messengers were allowed to bring partial truth through the ages he brought the truth of justification but that was only a part of the truth as god started on his great program of the fullness to the fullness of all restoration of his word which was eaten away from his church from his people from his beloved bride of christ amen amen and when luther brought justification the romans church and their eastern counterpart or the orthodox church still hugged and clung onto their works religious works religious acts religious forms traditional forms they held onto it with everything else doing religious charitable good deeds and charitable works of everything else and let me say works are fine but they don't save you and they cannot save you they do not make you perfect no matter how much candles you burn no matter how much you flagellate yourself no matter how much you sacrifice it is not your sacrifice your works your flagellations it is he jesus christ has suffered once for all isaiah 53 he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by his stripes we are healed we are saved we are forgiven we are redeemed we are sealed by the power of god true faith in him lord of god hallelujah amen but do they accept god's reality in christ amen all my friends it's christ our parish it's the reality of the word or perish it is not even christ and my good works it's jesus christ jesus and jesus christ and christ alone for salvation is of the lord not salvation and good works or salvation by good works this is not salvation plus good works no sir amen even the armenians do not believe in christ as the full reality because they don't sing nothing but the blood but when they do sing that song it should they sing it in a way i don't mean in reality but in fact this is their way of thinking of it nothing but the blood plus my good conduct but now friends salvation is of the lord it is not his works plus your good conduct because by adding your work so you could conduct you are giving the picture that he did not do a perfect work at the cross and you are now going to finish his work by adding on your good works and your good conducts to bring perfection to your salvation but our bible tells us he did a perfect work he is perfection of perfection he is the perfect one he is the perfect everything jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah you are if you're really truly saved you will do righteously like any sheep will bear will automatically if you're really a real christian you don't have to i don't have to do this that i don't no there's not don't listen don't do this and don't do that the holy spirit in you the spirit of christ in you the perfect one in you he will keep you he will produce his own works he will bear the world of virtues the life the holiness the purity amen he will bear it through you amen praise be to god hallelujah amen so these church ages only had partial realization but now at the end of the church ages the fullness of the word of god has come to bring us into a perfect realization of what he was saying down through the ages amen i believe i'll have to speak on sunday i will be speaking again and i trust the holy spirit will help us and speak to us in every possible way praise god hallelujah my friends let me say this what i'm saying salvation is not jesus plus your good works it is jesus alone salvation is of the lord from start to finish it is all of the god and all of the lord so let his life live in me let him live through me let him teach me how to surrender let him teach me how to let go let him teach me how to rest upon his unfailing word that he might live through me let it be his blood that cleanses me not my good works let it be his spirit that fills me let it be his word in my heart and mouth that cleanses me that inspires me and speaks and manifests through me let his let it be that by his stripes we are healed let it be jesus and jesus alone not by works of righteousness which i have done but by his grace and mercy he has saved us for he christ is our life and one day as the scriptures have said when he christ jesus our life shall appear oh praise god i thank god for this amen my friends listen to a b simpson the founder of the alliance church a great man of god an anointed servant of the most high god he penned these memorable words once it was the blessing once i sought the blessing now it is the lord once i wanted feeling but now it is the word once his gift i wanted now the giver i own once i sought for healing now himself alone all in all forever jesus will i sing everything in jesus and jesus perfect everything praise god my friends i tell you jesus you will find the sum total of all perfection the culmination the confluence of all perfection this finds itself in jesus christ because it comes to him and it points to him and everything else fades in significance in insignificant beside the lord jesus christ the rising of the sun the fading away of the light of the stars fading of the light of the seven stars in the light of the sunshine shining so bright in your heart's light eyes may god bless you remember the old hymn if you can't remember it fully go to your songbook and look for it what can wash away my sin nothing but the blood of jesus what can make me whole again nothing but the blood of jesus oh precious is the flow that makes me whiter snow no other fount i know nothing but the blood of jesus go look at the hymn for there is lot more inspiration in that hymn that will speak to your heart if you will go do that right now after you have come off the broadcast look at the hymn and peruse and meditate and think upon these things god bless you as we think upon him that is true god bless you [Music] you
