[45:59] the law of love and kindness is written
[46:02] in her heart
[46:04] she shall rejoice in the world to come
[46:09] my my
[46:11] Hallelujah
[46:12] what a what a what a what a treasure
[46:15] amen
[46:17] she overcomes disappointments
[46:20] she Comforts others as she grows old
[46:24] and in her work
[46:26] she's praise Wherever She Goes
[46:29] her children and her husband call her
[46:31] praised and blessed
[46:34] have you ever thought of Rahab being a
[46:38] virtuous woman
[46:40] she was saved because of her
[46:43] faithfulness
[46:44] was she perfect no but in the middle of
[46:48] Crisis she found her call
[46:52] make this clear distinction in your
[46:55] heart
[46:56] my faith is in Jesus the son of God the
[46:59] savior of the world my faith isn't in my
[47:02] ability to believe in Jesus because
[47:05] sometimes I won't be able to perceive
[47:08] him sometimes I won't be able to feel
[47:10] him sometimes I will have doubts
[47:13] but Faith isn't in any of that
[47:17] my faith is in his faithfulness
[47:21] we're talking about mothers here
[47:24] a virtuous woman
[47:27] has a gentle and quiet spirit
[47:30] which is precious in God's sight she is
[47:33] humble not aggressive her emotions
[47:37] are Spirit controlled
[47:39] she understands that being peaceful is
[47:42] not a weakness rather it's putting into
[47:45] use the female power that God is Pursuit
[47:49] upon her at creation
[47:54] my
[47:57] when I acknowledge Mother's Day I
[48:00] acknowledge of course my by God's grace
[48:02] I still have my mother
[48:04] she's still alive
[48:06] and uh
[48:07] you know I I see a lot of these
[48:10] qualities and I got another mother too
[48:12] which is my wife she's the mother of my
[48:14] children
[48:16] and then I have a a spiritual mother
[48:19] which is Sister Pam
[48:22] we only have one spiritual natural
[48:24] mother and father
[48:26] right
[48:27] my wife being the mother of my children
[48:30] and our spiritual father and mother
[48:35] and I look at them and I I see without
[48:39] them
[48:40] let me put it this way without them it
[48:42] would be impossible
[48:43] for me to be complete
[48:46] they are powerhouses
[48:49] they have abilities and characteristics
[48:51] that I and you men can never produce
[48:56] even in all the weaknesses and all the
[48:59] the things they produce that and I thank
[49:03] God for real mothers and those who want
[49:06] to be a real mother in this world
[49:08] because this world is so against
[49:10] a family unit from a man being a man and
[49:14] a woman being a woman
[49:16] and being a lady
[49:18] so I want to thank God for the three
[49:21] mothers in my life
[49:22] amen and I want to thank God for each
[49:25] and every one of you and all the mothers
[49:27] that have gone on that are gone that I I
[49:30] can acknowledge and remember we want to
[49:33] thank God for them amen
[49:36] so let us turn to the word today

[51:52] over Judas
[51:54] in his soul
[51:55] he was always rejoicing all is well in
[51:59] the soul

[53:12] not Mysteries
[53:14] The Mystery of the kingdom of God
[53:17] but unto them that are without all these
[53:21] things are done in parables
[53:23] that sin they may see and not perceive
[53:28] and herein they may hear and not
[53:31] understand
[53:32] lest at any time they should be
[53:35] converted and their sins should be
[53:38] forgiven them
[53:39] let us pray father
[53:42] thank you Lord
[53:44] that we're together

[53:57] and and our thoughts to be on you father
[54:00] to be on the word
[54:03] we come seeking we come thirsting and
[54:05] hungering
[54:06] for you to speak to us Lord
[54:09] because we know that man cannot reveal
[54:11] anything or do anything
[54:14] it's not by might it's not by power but
[54:17] by my spirit I'll reveal these things
[54:19] let the spirit of Revelation come upon
[54:22] us this morning Lord Let the Rain Fall
[54:25] let the Angels encamp let the
[54:27] supernatural be here with us today
[54:30] Lord take me aside father
[54:33] and just use me as an instrument but
[54:36] Quicken the word as it goes forth into
[54:38] the hearts of your people reveal this
[54:41] mystery in a deeper clearer way this
[54:44] morning we ask in Jesus name
[54:47] God bless you as you seated
[54:50] Hallelujah
[54:54] amen
[54:57] thank you Lord
[55:01] thank you
[55:03] amen
[55:06] The Mystery of the Kingdom Jesus said
[55:09] the kingdom of God has come within man
[55:13] there are many many Mysteries many many
[55:18] uh principles in the word of God
[55:21] many things God
[55:24] can and does reveal to us
[55:27] but there's only one mystery
[55:31] and that takes priority over everything
[55:34] in our lives and our walk
[55:37] to God
[55:39] he's determined
[55:41] and he said it in his word in many ways
[55:43] he said my word is re has gone forth and
[55:46] it will not return to me void but it
[55:48] will accomplish what is set forth to do
[55:52] it all is this is simple my brothers and
[55:55] sisters this is not complicated the
[55:59] prophet's message
[56:00] Jesus's teachings and who we are is very
[56:04] very simple
[56:07] when God reveals it to you and he and he
[56:11] shows you
[56:13] you are that mystery
[56:16] that God is trying to get you
[56:19] to understand and to recognize
[56:22] because the great statement that the
[56:26] prophet has spoken
[56:27] in this hour is when she recognizes who
[56:31] she is
[56:32] she'll be invincible
[56:35] that is the plan of God that's God's
[56:37] determination
[56:39] and his will to preach the gospel
[56:43] not to glorify man or personalities or
[56:46] any gift
[56:48] but is the bring the word to you that he
[56:52] could open up the mystery of Who You Are
[56:57] because that changes everything
[57:00] when you break that Veil and you go
[57:03] behind the inner Veil and you recognize
[57:06] that mystery is a part of you and you
[57:10] and God are one in the same
[57:13] that's what takes place
[57:16] in the Shekinah Glory
[57:19] you don't need man that's why the Bible
[57:21] says you don't need man to teach you but
[57:24] the Holy Ghost will teach you
[57:27] the Holy Ghost uses man
[57:30] amen
[57:31] but when man teaches people and people
[57:35] gets takes the teachings of man where
[57:38] does it leave them with a bunch of
[57:40] knowledge
[57:41] emptiness but when the Holy Ghost
[57:44] teaches you
[57:46] you never forget you learn
[57:48] you grow
[57:50] and you become
[57:52] who you're made to be
[57:54] Hallelujah
[57:57] proverbs 3.
[57:59] 3
[58:01] let not mercy and Truth for safety
[58:05] bind them above thy neck write them on
[58:09] the tables of thy heart
[58:10] so shall thou find favor and good
[58:13] understanding in the sight of God and
[58:15] Men
[58:17] trust in the Lord with all thy heart
[58:22] and lean not to thy own understanding
[58:25] but in all thy ways acknowledge Him and
[58:29] He Shall direct thy path
[58:32] Hallelujah
[58:35] you know since the Garden of Eden since
[58:37] sin come in
[58:39] since the black curtain came over the
[58:43] Earth and over the human race
[58:46] they failed at that time
[58:49] and and the Blackness came out where
[58:54] recognizing who they are and knowing who
[58:56] they are disappeared at that time as
[58:59] what we call Sin unbelief came in
[59:04] back in that day and ever since that
[59:06] time that God kicked him out of the
[59:09] Garden of Eden he's trying to bring them
[59:12] back into that Eden again that Eden was
[59:16] not just a a a place
[59:19] but it was a Eden was a relationship
[59:21] that God had with man that God and man
[59:25] were one
[59:27] when Adam spoke I was somebody was
[59:31] saying oh you're you're like uh you know
[59:33] you can name this and name that like and
[59:36] I said yeah yeah Adam name the animals
[59:40] because God and Adam were one in the
[59:42] same so when he looked at the character
[59:44] of the animal amen the Revelation came
[59:48] and name that animal
[59:51] that's when you're walking with God in
[59:54] the spirit of God
[59:56] Hallelujah
[59:57] amen
[1:00:02] what does mystery mean
[1:00:05] something that is difficult or
[1:00:08] impossible to understand or explain
[1:00:12] absolutely
[1:00:14] you could never in yourself
[1:00:17] understand it that's why he says lean
[1:00:19] not to your own understandings
[1:00:21] but acknowledge Him
[1:00:23] know him
[1:00:25] give him the preamments and he shall
[1:00:28] direct your path
[1:00:29] you cannot understand this you cannot
[1:00:31] put this together only the Holy Ghost
[1:00:33] can reveal this to you

[1:03:37] it's the father trying to reveal this
[1:03:40] hidden secret to you
[1:03:43] but you let so many things
[1:03:46] get in the way of it
[1:03:49] Paul said Satan hindered us he's a
[1:03:54] Hinderer
[1:03:56] but sometimes we allow things to get in
[1:03:59] the way of this

[1:04:07] you let your job
[1:04:12] you let your wife you let your husband
[1:04:14] you let your children yet the cares of
[1:04:17] this world
[1:04:18] you let some preacher you let somebody
[1:04:21] else get it out of you
[1:04:23] when you know way deep down in your
[1:04:27] heart you're hungering and thirsting for
[1:04:29] God

[1:04:34] you know what's inside of you

[1:04:44] and your position is what's hungering
[1:04:46] and thirsted inside of you
[1:04:49] but your faith needs to rise above your
[1:04:52] condition
[1:04:54] God will raise a standard when the enemy
[1:04:57] comes in as a flood he'll make that word
[1:04:59] more real to you

[1:05:19] the ones who have come into this
[1:05:21] understanding and recognizes this Who We
[1:05:25] Are
[1:05:26] before any one of us here I know I can
[1:05:29] speak for myself recognized to anything
[1:05:31] we had a pastor here that had a vision
[1:05:33] that recognized amen this mystery
[1:05:38] amen and he had to get this mystery out
[1:05:42] that was his calling that was the hunger
[1:05:45] of thirst in his heart
[1:05:47] and is here today
[1:05:49] again
[1:05:51] this thing has got to go this race has
[1:05:54] got to be run right to the end
[1:05:58] we got a battle we gotta fight
[1:06:01] to the end
[1:06:04] but you know what
[1:06:05] we're winners
[1:06:07] we're Overcomers
[1:06:10] it's been promised to us we cannot fail
[1:06:13] we cannot lose
[1:06:16] you got it you got the victory handed to
[1:06:18] you
[1:06:19] Into Your Hands by the cross
[1:06:22] by the Life by the token in this hour
[1:06:25] it's been given to us
[1:06:27] that should give you enough Faith to say
[1:06:29] Lord whatever challenge I meet whatever
[1:06:32] thing I go through in my life it doesn't
[1:06:34] matter what place I'm in what place I
[1:06:37] need to be in you're going to bring me
[1:06:40] there
[1:06:42] I can face all my fears yeah we got
[1:06:45] fears
[1:06:46] I can doubt all my doubts yes we had
[1:06:48] doubts at times
[1:06:50] because we don't understand
[1:06:52] but we can face them all
[1:06:55] Hallelujah
[1:06:57] amen
[1:07:02] that's why
[1:07:04] you hunger and you thirst
[1:07:07] see is God trying to reveal it to you
[1:07:11] see the Revelation in the last days is
[1:07:14] here
[1:07:15] now
[1:07:17] it's recognizing who you are and your
[1:07:20] position in Christ
[1:07:22] is the mystery of God revealed
[1:07:26] now look the Webster dictionary defines
[1:07:29] acknowledge
[1:07:30] as recognizing the rights and
[1:07:33] authorities and status of someone or
[1:07:36] something
[1:07:37] which is certainly more intense than the
[1:07:40] way we typically think of acknowledgment
[1:07:43] if you acknowledging someone's Authority
[1:07:45] you're acknowledging that they have
[1:07:48] power over you
[1:07:52] oh my
[1:07:55] how can we die out to ourselves
[1:07:58] how can we let everything go how can we
[1:08:00] let all our understanding goals the
[1:08:01] scripture says
[1:08:03] the Bible says bring every thought under
[1:08:06] captivity to the mind of Christ to the
[1:08:08] thoughts of God how can we do that
[1:08:11] you can never understand that that's
[1:08:14] what a mystery is you can never
[1:08:15] understand it you could never figure it
[1:08:17] out
[1:08:18] we're not here to do that we're not here
[1:08:21] to apply a bunch of principles and and a
[1:08:24] bunch of rules and standards that you
[1:08:27] got to live by you've got to live better
[1:08:29] you got to live Holier this is not what
[1:08:32] this is about my brothers and sisters
[1:08:34] this isn't about getting a holy ghost
[1:08:37] surrendering your life doing what you
[1:08:40] have to do in your heart to open it up
[1:08:43] to allow the Holy Ghost to come in
[1:08:46] it's not about the law you can't live
[1:08:48] the law
[1:08:49] the law is dead
[1:08:52] without him all was fulfilled in Christ
[1:08:56] I come not to destroy the law but I
[1:08:59] fulfilled the law now you need my life
[1:09:02] inside of you
[1:09:06] Hallelujah
[1:09:08] works is good but without faith it's
[1:09:11] dead
[1:09:13] it's no good
[1:09:15] we eat the faith of who we are the faith
[1:09:19] of this mystery
[1:09:21] God is raising up not church members
[1:09:26] but he's raising up Sons and Daughters
[1:09:28] of the Living God
[1:09:30] people who will move
[1:09:32] and operate like they did in the Bible
[1:09:34] days
[1:09:35] the book of Acts
[1:09:37] we had a wave sheet in this hour
[1:09:40] amen waving over the Bride of Jesus
[1:09:43] Christ now it's time for the bride to
[1:09:46] wave Jesus Christ over the people again
[1:09:51] and I believe it's here
[1:09:53] I believe it's here I believe it's
[1:09:56] manifesting
[1:09:58] this is manifesting time
[1:10:00] for the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:10:04] it's here
[1:10:06] he's here
[1:10:09] Hallelujah
[1:10:13] acknowledging that the word acknowledged
[1:10:16] has root in the 15th and 16th centuries
[1:10:20] is a combination of roots meaning Accord
[1:10:23] recognize and understand
[1:10:26] whereas knowledge is what you know
[1:10:30] but acknowledging is showing that you
[1:10:34] know
[1:10:35] it's not what you know but it's not you
[1:10:38] know
[1:10:40] God wants to get you from knowing what
[1:10:43] you know to know in him
[1:10:45] there's a difference
[1:10:47] Paul says I want to know him
[1:10:50] not know about him
[1:10:52] I knew about him when I was a Pharisee I
[1:10:55] knew about the Old Testament I knew
[1:10:58] about all of them rituals and their
[1:11:00] routines and the traditions
[1:11:02] and the Tabernacle everything
[1:11:05] but I want the Tabernacle I want to move
[1:11:08] in that Tabernacle I want to know him
[1:11:11] Hallelujah
[1:11:14] oh the veil was rent from top to bottom
[1:11:18] Christ came on the scene and displayed
[1:11:22] himself
[1:11:23] oh my
[1:11:25] God thank you Lord
[1:11:28] Jesus
[1:11:30] thank you Lord
[1:11:32] amen
[1:11:34] The Book of Revelation
[1:11:37] shows
[1:11:38] how that the Antichrist Spirit would
[1:11:40] come into the world
[1:11:42] come into the church and defile it
[1:11:45] make it lukewarm formal and Powerless
[1:11:49] it exposes Satan's revealing works
[1:11:52] his attempt destruction
[1:11:54] of God's people
[1:11:56] and discrediting
[1:11:58] God's word
[1:12:00] that's what's taking place
[1:12:02] and you got a choice this morning
[1:12:05] we have three more agency
[1:12:07] and you got a choice this morning
[1:12:10] to allow Satan to do this in your life
[1:12:13] or to kick him out
[1:12:16] that's your choice
[1:12:18] no matter how much the word is preached
[1:12:20] to you unless you take a stand and make
[1:12:24] a choice and agree with the word and
[1:12:27] apply the word to your life
[1:12:31] Satan is not after you he's got you
[1:12:35] my life is good my life is perfect I'm a
[1:12:37] good message believer good Christian
[1:12:40] watch out
[1:12:43] watch out
[1:12:44] you might have the claws in your back
[1:12:47] holding you
[1:12:51] right down to the time he's cast in to
[1:12:55] the Lake of Fire
[1:12:58] so
[1:12:59] the time you get a revelation of Who You
[1:13:02] Are
[1:13:03] and you start understanding the mystery
[1:13:05] that you're part of that mystery
[1:13:07] is it over
[1:13:08] It's Not Over
[1:13:10] it's never over
[1:13:13] when you leave this body when you leave
[1:13:15] this world whether by death sleep or
[1:13:18] translation Rapture It's Not Over
[1:13:23] he'll fight you right there
[1:13:25] right to the end
[1:13:27] you see he fights that
[1:13:31] he cannot stand it
[1:13:34] he knows that if the people get a true
[1:13:36] revelation of the true church and what
[1:13:39] she is and what she stands for and she
[1:13:42] can do the Greater Works
[1:13:44] Hallelujah
[1:13:47] the Greater Works she can do the Greater
[1:13:50] Works
[1:13:54] she will be an invincible Army
[1:13:59] there's an army raising up
[1:14:02] there's a mighty Army raising up
[1:14:06] with the confidence
[1:14:08] the power
[1:14:09] the authority
[1:14:12] amen
[1:14:14] of the Revelation that's behind her in
[1:14:16] her life
[1:14:19] oh God hallelujah if they get a true
[1:14:23] revelation of the two Spirits within the
[1:14:25] framework of the Christian church and by
[1:14:28] God's spirit discern and withstand the
[1:14:30] Antichrist spirit
[1:14:32] will be powerless before her what does
[1:14:34] that mean my brothers and sisters
[1:14:35] there's people that are not preaching
[1:14:38] God is coming flesh again today that God
[1:14:42] and his bride are one and the same
[1:14:45] that the son of man is being revealed in
[1:14:49] Bride form in this hour
[1:14:52] just like the godhead you can't if you
[1:14:55] preach three different people in the
[1:14:57] godhead how can you understand
[1:15:00] amen the dissension of God in flesh and
[1:15:04] how can you wonder if you don't
[1:15:05] understand how God became flesh and
[1:15:08] became man and dwelt in man the fullness
[1:15:11] of God how are you going to understand
[1:15:14] that God
[1:15:16] all the scriptures all the prophecies
[1:15:20] that are pertaining to the Bride of
[1:15:21] Jesus Christ in this hour how are you
[1:15:23] going to understand how God will become
[1:15:25] one with you in your flesh
[1:15:32] you see
[1:15:35] how important it is
[1:15:37] but Satan
[1:15:39] in the framework of the Church of the
[1:15:41] message
[1:15:42] two Spirits operating and we've been
[1:15:44] well taught over the years
[1:15:47] Jacob and Esau
[1:15:50] Abel and Cain all down through the line
[1:15:55] all down through the generations
[1:15:58] the seed going all the way down and
[1:16:01] Satan fighting that seed all the way
[1:16:04] down why because there's life in the
[1:16:07] seed there's God's life in the seed
[1:16:10] fighting it trying to deceive it trying
[1:16:13] to to distract it hinder it do
[1:16:17] everything he can
[1:16:19] listen if you become a mighty warrior a
[1:16:23] mighty uh uh soldier in the army of God
[1:16:26] Amen is a man who Rises up and a woman
[1:16:29] who Rises up and recognizes this
[1:16:32] and takes a stand
[1:16:34] every day
[1:16:36] that's why it's an individual affair
[1:16:40] that's why there's a great uniting time
[1:16:43] of the Bride of Jesus Christ in the
[1:16:45] spirit but there's also a great
[1:16:47] separating time
[1:16:50] I love both of them
[1:16:52] I love the uniting and I meet my
[1:16:55] brothers and sisters but I love the
[1:16:57] separation too because that separation
[1:16:59] is private
[1:17:01] between me and my Lord
[1:17:03] he reveals secrets to me he shows me
[1:17:07] things that I don't tell nobody
[1:17:10] I don't have to tell anybody with my
[1:17:13] lips
[1:17:14] but I let the life
[1:17:16] I let the faith when the things of
[1:17:19] situations and circumstances of Life
[1:17:22] come upon me I let my faith speak for
[1:17:25] itself my faith in him and my trust in
[1:17:29] him and me knowing him
[1:17:32] that he's able to take me through
[1:17:33] everything
[1:17:36] oh God
[1:17:38] thank you Lord
[1:17:41] see Satan hates it because he knows he
[1:17:43] will be defeated
[1:17:45] just like Christ withstood his ever
[1:17:48] efforts to gain power over him in the
[1:17:51] desert
[1:17:53] you see he's doing all his efforts to
[1:17:56] gain power over you
[1:17:59] oh yeah he's after you
[1:18:01] he wants the power over you he wants to
[1:18:03] control over you
[1:18:05] but Jesus which stood every one of his
[1:18:09] Temptations every one of his efforts
[1:18:12] he could not gain power over Jesus
[1:18:16] he come to Jesus and he couldn't find
[1:18:18] nothing to pull on him brother Branham
[1:18:21] came down to the end of his life we know
[1:18:23] we have a sticky flesh but he came down
[1:18:25] to I'm not going to interpret that
[1:18:27] because you know you interpret that and
[1:18:29] people make excuses for themselves make
[1:18:31] excuses for sin in their life I'm not
[1:18:34] going to put any interpretation on that
[1:18:35] all I know is brother Brandon came down
[1:18:37] to the end of his life
[1:18:39] and he has Satan's number
[1:18:43] Satan did not control him cannot control
[1:18:46] his emotions his feelings
[1:18:48] his attitude his behavior his faith
[1:18:52] nothing
[1:18:54] God was in total possession of all that
[1:18:56] why because a man was standing there
[1:18:59] recognized in the scriptures the mystery
[1:19:03] that he was
[1:19:07] Hallelujah
[1:19:09] amen
[1:19:11] thank you Lord
[1:19:13] it is to recognize that God
[1:19:16] is one who works in our lives
[1:19:19] Empower wisdom and godliness and Justice
[1:19:21] see Ephesians 3 20.
[1:19:24] and to know
[1:19:26] the love of Christ which passeth
[1:19:28] knowledge
[1:19:30] and that ye might be filled with the
[1:19:32] fullness of God
[1:19:34] now unto him that is able to do
[1:19:37] exceedingly abundantly above all
[1:19:41] that we can ask or think
[1:19:45] according to the power that worketh in
[1:19:48] US
[1:19:49] see it's not about all you're asking
[1:19:52] it's not about all you're believing
[1:19:55] it ain't nothing about you
[1:19:58] nothing what you can work up or what you
[1:20:01] can believe you know if I believe more
[1:20:03] and if I do this morning it's not about
[1:20:06] that
[1:20:10] it's so simple
[1:20:13] this thing is simple you young people
[1:20:15] this thing is simple
[1:20:17] let them in
[1:20:19] let him in
[1:20:21] Lord of your life let him in
[1:20:25] you let the master in
[1:20:28] and watch him do what is said
[1:20:31] he'll do what is said brother Brown says
[1:20:33] I'm standing here and I'm watching while
[1:20:36] he's doing all these great things let me
[1:20:38] tell you everything has a compound
[1:20:40] Revelation that has been spoken and
[1:20:43] manifested listen I'm standing here in
[1:20:46] my life you're standing in your life
[1:20:48] every day watching him do these things
[1:20:52] how can I overcome distress how can I
[1:20:55] over overcome this disappointment
[1:20:58] how can I overcome this this uh trauma
[1:21:01] in my life because I'm watching him
[1:21:03] come in and do it all
[1:21:06] I'm giving him come Lord Jesus you know
[1:21:10] I can't handle this in the flesh you
[1:21:12] know I can't do nothing in the flesh
[1:21:13] come Lord Jesus and handle the situation
[1:21:19] so we don't get in self-pity amen we
[1:21:23] don't get sold down on ourselves
[1:21:25] so sad about things disappointments come
[1:21:29] Lord Jesus all things work together for
[1:21:32] good for me they'll work for my good I
[1:21:35] don't know how but they're going to work
[1:21:37] for my good
[1:21:39] oh my
[1:21:41] because it's him
[1:21:43] Hallelujah
[1:21:46] hey
[1:21:48] he's revealing the mystery this morning
[1:21:51] oh yeah
[1:21:55] thank you Lord
[1:21:57] we will begin to acknowledge God in all
[1:21:59] our ways when we realize just how
[1:22:01] complete God is
[1:22:03] completely God has forgiven us
[1:22:05] the lord loves you so much he's forgiven
[1:22:08] you totally completely
[1:22:12] that's very important
[1:22:15] all these things are very important for
[1:22:17] us to see and understand and believe in
[1:22:20] our hearts because that's why Paul says
[1:22:23] there is no condemnation to them that
[1:22:25] are in Christ people are still walking
[1:22:28] around believe in the word of God and
[1:22:31] Satan is still putting them under
[1:22:33] condemnation because why you might sin
[1:22:37] you might have a habit you might have a
[1:22:39] weakness in your life you might fall
[1:22:42] and he puts condemnation on you
[1:22:45] you see but God is working
[1:22:48] what does he do that's why he doesn't
[1:22:50] come and condemn you that's why he
[1:22:53] doesn't come and beat you down but he
[1:22:55] comes and shows you who you are
[1:22:58] he shows you who you are you know you're
[1:23:00] my son you know that the seed of God
[1:23:03] that I place inside of you cannot sin
[1:23:05] that's who you are there is no sin and I
[1:23:09] don't impute no iniquity to you that's
[1:23:11] who you are
[1:23:13] that's your flesh that's the first birth
[1:23:19] that don't even belong to you
[1:23:25] don't even belong to you
[1:23:28] but you see
[1:23:30] when you recognize that
[1:23:33] it's totally different
[1:23:35] oh yeah I you know I'm not saying that
[1:23:38] you I confess my faults that's what the
[1:23:40] Bible says When I See This Flynn this
[1:23:43] this Flynn this flesh
[1:23:46] sin
[1:23:48] maybe I'm going to speak in tongues I
[1:23:50] don't know
[1:23:54] when I see it sin when I see it you know
[1:23:57] make mistakes get weak yes Lord
[1:24:01] father
[1:24:02] help me
[1:24:04] I know you're in me
[1:24:06] just like Jesus father
[1:24:09] the cross
[1:24:10] the beating he's seen everything
[1:24:13] he's seen everything brother my brothers
[1:24:15] and sisters
[1:24:16] and if you think that Jesus suffered
[1:24:19] like you see out there in the churches
[1:24:21] with him hanging on the cross with a
[1:24:23] couple little stripes
[1:24:24] you better go look into the crucifixion
[1:24:27] a little deeper he suffered in agony
[1:24:29] where his blood and his water separated
[1:24:31] in the Garden of Gethsemane but he said
[1:24:34] father nevertheless not in my will but
[1:24:38] thy will be done
[1:24:40] Hallelujah
[1:24:41] glory to God thy will be done Lord
[1:24:45] sometimes we're going to suffer
[1:24:47] sometimes God has to break us whatever
[1:24:49] we have to go through suffer loss in our
[1:24:52] lives
[1:24:53] God knows because there's a greater plan
[1:24:56] here a greater economy than out there
[1:24:59] and the politicians the greater economy
[1:25:03] is God's economy
[1:25:04] the mystery that he's trying to get us
[1:25:07] to recognize
[1:25:08] that's what he's determined to do
[1:25:11] and when you come in focus with that
[1:25:12] instead of saying oh God
[1:25:15] we should not be praying
[1:25:18] most of our prayers God forgive me
[1:25:20] forgive me forgive me help me help me
[1:25:23] but we should be praying in faith
[1:25:25] recognizing Who We Are
[1:25:27] you know a manager or a president of a
[1:25:29] company don't keep going and asking the
[1:25:32] employees and the other supervisors how
[1:25:34] to run that company
[1:25:35] if he does he should be getting out of
[1:25:37] there that company's going to go down
[1:25:40] but he stands there and he runs the
[1:25:42] company he makes choices and decisions
[1:25:44] and that's what God wants us to do with
[1:25:46] his word that's within us
[1:25:49] apply the token apply the word
[1:25:54] amen
[1:25:56] we learn to acknowledge God in all his
[1:25:58] ways
[1:25:59] when we read the word of God it's your
[1:26:03] guidebook to know God and grow in wisdom
[1:26:06] we know that faith comes by hearing and
[1:26:10] here and by the word of God
[1:26:12] so read your Bible read the word amen
[1:26:17] love it
[1:26:20] study it
[1:26:22] memorize it there's nothing wrong with
[1:26:25] that there's nothing contradicting of of
[1:26:28] what I'm speaking here to do that
[1:26:31] because when you do that it opens up the
[1:26:34] Chen channels of Entry to your spirit
[1:26:38] and to your soul so God can take
[1:26:41] something give him a tool if I tell you
[1:26:44] to go do the gardening outside just go
[1:26:46] do it clean up do it cut the grass and
[1:26:49] all that and I don't give you the tools
[1:26:51] the equipment to do it
[1:26:54] I don't know what it's going to look
[1:26:55] like
[1:26:57] these are the tools and equipment
[1:27:00] amen the more you desire the word of God
[1:27:03] the more you feed on the word of God the
[1:27:05] more you hunger and thirst for the word
[1:27:07] of God the more God will come draw near
[1:27:11] to me and I will draw near to you
[1:27:14] amen you young people
[1:27:17] what is out there for you
[1:27:21] I believe we got young people in here
[1:27:22] today
[1:27:24] and I don't I don't just say that to
[1:27:25] make them feel good here
[1:27:28] I don't do that
[1:27:30] I'm a straight shooter
[1:27:32] if I if I say that yeah you know
[1:27:35] you're this you're this I you know me I
[1:27:37] get in trouble sometimes
[1:27:39] but there's young people in here today
[1:27:41] that are hungering and thirsting for God
[1:27:45] what I what I say to you is what I what
[1:27:48] I went through
[1:27:50] keep searching keep seeking keep
[1:27:53] knocking
[1:27:54] don't stop night and day no matter what
[1:27:57] it takes
[1:27:58] God just like Jacob wrestling with the
[1:28:01] angel God I'm gonna sit here I'm going
[1:28:05] to sit right in my experience in this
[1:28:07] stage of life until you reveal something
[1:28:10] to me
[1:28:11] show me that I'm a part of that mystery
[1:28:15] oh my
[1:28:17] glory to God
[1:28:19] there's going to be young people that
[1:28:21] are going to have that hunger and thirst
[1:28:22] I was young
[1:28:25] I was what 22 23 years old
[1:28:30] hunger and thirst of for God people
[1:28:32] thought I was crazy all my friends and
[1:28:34] all that thought I was crazy
[1:28:37] but I was I want nothing but the Living
[1:28:39] God
[1:28:41] I don't know what I understand now but
[1:28:43] back then I don't know what I said I
[1:28:45] said to my wife I don't know what's
[1:28:46] happening I don't know if I lost my mind
[1:28:48] I thought I lost my mind but I thought I
[1:28:49] got my mind back when I came here now
[1:28:52] the devil's saying no no you really lost
[1:28:54] your mind even more than you lost it
[1:28:55] before look at the Way You Are
[1:28:58] when I thank God 32 years later
[1:29:00] Hallelujah if I'm crazy I'm crazy for
[1:29:03] the Lord
[1:29:04] Hallelujah
[1:29:08] Hallelujah
[1:29:10] you know I preached the gospel with
[1:29:12] passion is the only way I can preach it
[1:29:14] it kills me sometimes it burns me out
[1:29:17] right but I'm going to stand up here and
[1:29:19] I'm going to preach it like it's my last
[1:29:21] sermon
[1:29:22] I'm going to do everything and that's
[1:29:24] the way the love of God because he did
[1:29:26] everything for me and I'm going to stand
[1:29:29] up here and do everything I can
[1:29:32] so that God the spirit can speak to your
[1:29:36] heart and stir your life up and maybe
[1:29:38] like brother Desmond said on one word
[1:29:41] just one word that's all it takes one
[1:29:44] Revelation and breaks you into that

[1:32:53] we have to be awakened to more faith
[1:32:56] Romans 1 16 from Faith unto Faith the
[1:33:00] perfect faith that was given to the
[1:33:01] bride by the opening of the word the
[1:33:03] Seven Seals are open to the bride to
[1:33:06] know who she is in this hour this is the
[1:33:09] hour of perfect Faith you see more faith
[1:33:12] is needed to overcome the Flesh in this
[1:33:15] world modern events Hallelujah we are
[1:33:19] awakened we have been ordained to be
[1:33:22] awake in this hour of deception and lies
[1:33:25] to recognize the revealed truth to be
[1:33:29] awakened to our calling and our position
[1:33:32] Awakening to our true identity in Christ
[1:33:35] This Is The Awakening time and the
[1:33:38] mature in time of the seed of God

[1:33:51] Ephesians 1
[1:33:53] 17.
[1:33:55] and Proverbs 23
[1:33:58] .
[1:34:00] look
[1:34:02] to his understanding for our path of
[1:34:04] life
[1:34:06] the first thing that comes with a Great
[1:34:08] Awakening comes faith
[1:34:11] without faith is impossible to please
[1:34:12] God
[1:34:14] without faith we cannot see
[1:34:16] or enter into the kingdom of God then
[1:34:19] Jesus say that
[1:34:22] you cannot see or enter in
[1:34:26] the mystery
[1:34:30] you look right down from Cain and Abel
[1:34:34] Abel by faith had the ability to see the
[1:34:38] original sin
[1:34:40] just like the godhead my brothers and
[1:34:42] sisters
[1:34:44] just like the godhead if you don't see
[1:34:46] that original sin
[1:34:49] you're going to mess up the program and
[1:34:52] plan of God and the Order of God and how
[1:34:54] he brings the word and delivers you in
[1:34:56] your life
[1:34:58] because you need to recognize
[1:35:01] that that sin that happened
[1:35:04] produce death
[1:35:06] in US
[1:35:09] all truth
[1:35:11] all Mysteries
[1:35:13] all hidden things have come to the Bride
[1:35:16] of Jesus Christ
[1:35:18] for what
[1:35:20] the puff up her head
[1:35:22] the puff up herself but no
[1:35:25] there's a plan and a purpose and a
[1:35:28] design of God that all these things and
[1:35:30] the seals being opened
[1:35:33] is all combinated
[1:35:37] to let her recognize
[1:35:40] in her life
[1:35:41] how that word is going to become flesh
[1:35:43] and hurt
[1:35:44] amen
[1:35:46] is going to make her recognize the
[1:35:48] mystery when you understand the godhead
[1:35:51] when you understand the serpent seed
[1:35:53] when you understand the original sin
[1:35:55] when you understand all these things it
[1:35:58] starts placing you in your position as a
[1:36:03] son and daughter of God because it's
[1:36:06] revealing truth unto you it's shown you
[1:36:08] truth
[1:36:10] oh yes
[1:36:12] it's all part of the design of God
[1:36:15] that's why all these false doctrines and
[1:36:18] false teachings that I've even come in
[1:36:20] the message it's shaked in fighting
[1:36:23] against this truth
[1:36:25] this mystery that God is trying to get
[1:36:29] to you
[1:36:30] oh it's going to come down to it my
[1:36:32] brothers and sisters that there's going
[1:36:34] to be a great Warfare and that Warfare
[1:36:37] is going to start exploding in the
[1:36:38] message
[1:36:40] oh yes
[1:36:42] oh yes the faults against the truth are
[1:36:46] going to start clashing
[1:36:48] clashing and you know what the intellect
[1:36:51] of the Mind the knowledge of the mind
[1:36:53] just like it was in the days of Jesus
[1:36:55] when Jesus met those challenges when the
[1:36:59] prophet met those challenges the bride
[1:37:02] is going to meet those challenges
[1:37:05] the same way by Faith by Revelation by
[1:37:08] the spirit of God inside of her
[1:37:11] Hallelujah
[1:37:14] amen
[1:37:17] Ephesians 1 17 that the god of our Lord
[1:37:21] Jesus Christ the father of Glory may
[1:37:22] give unto you the spirit of wisdom and
[1:37:25] Revelation in the knowledge of him
[1:37:28] you see how important to know how God
[1:37:31] became man
[1:37:32] in flesh you see God spoke himself
[1:37:38] through the prophets
[1:37:42] into existence
[1:37:47] and he came on the scene
[1:37:51] and God spoke
[1:37:53] the bride into existence in his last
[1:37:56] days
[1:37:57] and now she's on the scene
[1:38:01] there's no other way it can come
[1:38:04] no other way can come all man's ways
[1:38:06] your ways everything
[1:38:08] in all your ways and thoughts
[1:38:10] acknowledge Him He said my thoughts are
[1:38:13] hired in your thoughts my ways are
[1:38:14] higher than your ways
[1:38:16] Paul says I have to Die daily to all
[1:38:18] those things
[1:38:20] Hallelujah
[1:38:22] amen
[1:38:24] you see John recognized Jesus was the
[1:38:27] Lamb of God
[1:38:28] he saw the Holy Spirit coming down as a
[1:38:31] dove he knew he was in the presence of
[1:38:33] God he's seen the word coming to fulfill
[1:38:38] that's why he can say this is the Lamb
[1:38:41] of God who takes away the sins of the
[1:38:43] world you know we look at that scripture
[1:38:44] and we say oh you know what because of
[1:38:46] tradition because we've been hearing it
[1:38:48] all our lives at Christmas time
[1:38:50] or or or Easter time but remember John
[1:38:53] was a cousin of Jesus
[1:38:56] remember they they they they they they
[1:38:58] in the flesh
[1:39:00] I mean Jesus was his flesh didn't belong
[1:39:04] to nobody
[1:39:05] right we understand that
[1:39:07] but they took him as cousins Step
[1:39:10] Brothers In the Flesh they grew up with
[1:39:12] him he was common he spoke to Common
[1:39:15] Language he was a carpenter he did
[1:39:18] common things he worked with his hands
[1:39:21] and think John gets anointed
[1:39:24] and comes out with a great ministry that
[1:39:27] he had Elijah
[1:39:30] and then he sees his cousin coming down
[1:39:33] the road
[1:39:35] but if he only seen his cousins he would
[1:39:38] not recognize that he would not have
[1:39:40] spoken the things that he spoke
[1:39:42] he recognized something greater than his
[1:39:45] cousin coming down the road
[1:39:46] because he said I seen the spirit of God
[1:39:51] descending upon this man like a dove
[1:39:54] he caught a revelation of who this man
[1:39:58] was
[1:39:59] and that's why he can say Jesus didn't
[1:40:02] tell him to say this is the Lamb of God
[1:40:04] who takes away the sins of the world
[1:40:08] revelation
[1:40:10] God
[1:40:11] reveal in himself
[1:40:13] to John
[1:40:15] this is my beloved Son in whom I well
[1:40:18] pleased in that's the way it's always
[1:40:21] been and always will be
[1:40:25] Hallelujah
[1:40:28] amen
[1:40:33] and what is the mystery
[1:40:37] what is God trying to reveal to us and
[1:40:40] get to us to recognize
[1:40:44] we can see
[1:40:46] that we could
[1:40:48] recognize many things
[1:40:51] in this world
[1:40:53] many things to recognize the political
[1:40:55] the social the religious Realm
[1:40:57] even in the messes of the hour
[1:40:59] many many preachers
[1:41:01] many many sermons many different gifts
[1:41:05] but what is God
[1:41:08] through it all trying to get you to
[1:41:11] recognize
[1:41:13] all those things are good
[1:41:15] and all those things could be used of
[1:41:17] God
[1:41:19] but there's a place
[1:41:21] there's a secret place between only you
[1:41:24] and God
[1:41:26] you know
[1:41:27] a husband and wife
[1:41:30] when they get married
[1:41:32] they don't really know each other until
[1:41:34] they get married
[1:41:36] and they go into that secret chamber
[1:41:39] then they know each other
[1:41:42] that's just the Natural Things of life
[1:41:46] and you don't know him
[1:41:48] until you've been into the chamber with
[1:41:49] him
[1:41:51] till you've been with the at the cross
[1:41:54] with him
[1:41:56] till you know that you have died
[1:42:00] to yourself
[1:42:03] as much as you can at that moment in
[1:42:05] that time and he come to you
[1:42:08] and you've been with him and you know
[1:42:11] no preacher can tell you
[1:42:13] whether it's right or it's wrong whether
[1:42:15] you've been there you've been you've not
[1:42:16] been there
[1:42:17] no it's a secret between you and him
[1:42:20] just like it is between a husband and
[1:42:22] wife it's a secret
[1:42:24] there's something that takes place there
[1:42:26] there's a union a bonding that takes
[1:42:29] place there
[1:42:30] and that never stops he says I started
[1:42:33] to work inside of you he says I will
[1:42:35] finish it he said I will never ever
[1:42:38] leave you
[1:42:39] I will never ever forsake you
[1:42:43] but not only that
[1:42:45] but I will be with you and I will be in
[1:42:48] you
[1:42:49] to the end of time
[1:42:51] to the end of your time I will be in you

[1:43:16] bride the word is in the bride like it
[1:43:18] was Mary

[1:43:21] a mystery was revealed to her
[1:43:23] and when the angel came and spoke to her
[1:43:26] she didn't understand how it was going
[1:43:27] to take place how is this going to be
[1:43:30] amen but the Holy Ghost

[1:43:35] this mystery come on preacher tell me
[1:43:38] what is this mystery
[1:43:40] but the angel said the Holy Ghost will
[1:43:42] overshadow you
[1:43:44] and do this inside of you
[1:43:46] and that's all the preacher can do is
[1:43:48] say the Holy Ghost will overshadow you
[1:43:51] and do this inside of you and bring
[1:43:53] forth this word of God
[1:43:55] Hallelujah

[1:44:01] you see God revealing to us the one
[1:44:05] thing the father is trying to get us the
[1:44:08] mystery of the Kingdom the hidden secret
[1:44:11] to us it is given to us to know it and
[1:44:15] recognize the word like it was in Mary
[1:44:18] living in the Shekinah Glory behind the
[1:44:21] Intervale is the only place that that
[1:44:24] mystery
[1:44:25] can be revealed to you
[1:44:28] that mystery
[1:44:30] is an overcoming
[1:44:32] life
[1:44:34] an overcoming life with God
[1:44:37] remember
[1:44:39] in the seventh seal
[1:44:42] Satan will try to impersonate it
[1:44:46] he'll try to impersonate everything that
[1:44:49] the church will do
[1:44:50] we notice it
[1:44:52] through the Antichrist spirit
[1:44:55] but this is one thing he cannot
[1:44:57] impersonate
[1:44:58] what I'm talking about this morning
[1:45:01] he can't touch this
[1:45:03] he says it right here
[1:45:05] there is no mimics to this
[1:45:09] there's no games there's no workup
[1:45:13] there's no plane around to this
[1:45:17] it's the life of God it's the token
[1:45:21] Hallelujah
[1:45:24] there's no way for him to know it
[1:45:27] no way
[1:45:28] it's the third poll the revealing of the
[1:45:30] word he just knows nothing about it see
[1:45:34] he doesn't understand it
[1:45:41] he doesn't know anything about this
[1:45:45] what am I trying to say here what's that
[1:45:46] mean
[1:45:48] how do you break that down
[1:45:52] that's how the bride
[1:45:54] is going to stand out in this last days
[1:45:56] that's how God is going to show her off
[1:46:03] when it's coming down to the squeeze
[1:46:05] time
[1:46:06] because Satan
[1:46:09] where he's hiding
[1:46:12] where he's trying to impersonate this
[1:46:16] that the the word of God that the
[1:46:18] prophet brung to speak to the Bride of
[1:46:20] Jesus Christ
[1:46:21] he's going to be exposed
[1:46:23] because it's going to come a time my
[1:46:25] brothers and sisters amen
[1:46:28] he cannot
[1:46:29] go just like Judas could not go to
[1:46:32] Pentecost
[1:46:34] he cannot go
[1:46:36] any farther
[1:46:39] and I believe we're at that stage
[1:46:42] and not time of maturity right now
[1:46:46] I'm talking about the Bride of Jesus
[1:46:48] Christ
[1:46:49] where she's at
[1:46:52] Hallelujah
[1:46:55] thank you Lord
[1:46:57] you look at Exodus 19. it talks about
[1:47:00] how God destroyed the Egyptians in the
[1:47:02] water
[1:47:03] and how he brought the children of
[1:47:05] Israel out of the water
[1:47:07] a type when we look back at our habits
[1:47:09] and the things that used to control our
[1:47:11] minds and our flesh we can see them
[1:47:13] drowning in the sea of God's
[1:47:17] forgetfulness
[1:47:19] I can see it my brothers and sisters
[1:47:22] I can see things that was holding me
[1:47:24] back
[1:47:25] control of me and binding me
[1:47:29] being drowned I can see them looking
[1:47:31] back I can see them my brothers and
[1:47:33] sisters
[1:47:34] and God see a forgetfulness
[1:47:39] forget those things
[1:47:42] which are behind
[1:47:43] and I'm pressing towards the mark of the
[1:47:46] high calling in Christ Jesus
[1:47:49] press it on
[1:47:51] press it in
[1:47:53] to the kingdom of God
[1:47:55] amen take it by violence take it by
[1:47:59] force
[1:48:00] Hallelujah
[1:48:02] amen listen Paul expressing his concerns
[1:48:06] of faith in the Thessalonians
[1:48:08] I learn of your faith for fear that
[1:48:10] somehow the tempter has tempted you and
[1:48:13] our labor be in vain
[1:48:15] Paul knew that sings design was to choke
[1:48:18] off Faith from the people who would hear
[1:48:20] the word of God
[1:48:22] Hallelujah
[1:48:23] people coming you know what if God has
[1:48:26] led you here
[1:48:28] it's not because of brother Simon it's
[1:48:30] not because of brother Tim or anybody
[1:48:31] but if the spirit of God has led you
[1:48:34] here
[1:48:37] is because he wants to meet you here he
[1:48:41] wants to feed you here
[1:48:42] I could have went to any other church
[1:48:44] but God led me to a Ministry amen and I
[1:48:48] stayed with that Ministry
[1:48:51] oh yeah a lot of other Methodist
[1:48:53] churches wanted to pull me this way pull
[1:48:55] me that way but no I recognize where the
[1:48:58] spirit of God led me and that's why I
[1:49:00] stand the way I stand today and if the
[1:49:02] spirit of God has led you here
[1:49:06] then you stay here because he's going to
[1:49:09] feed you here
[1:49:10] don't let Satan pull you away
[1:49:13] and persuade you and tempt you
[1:49:17] you think God knows what he's doing when
[1:49:18] he led you here
[1:49:20] and you're happy I've seen people come
[1:49:22] and they're blessed they're happy
[1:49:24] they're growing and they listen to the
[1:49:26] devil and they go out
[1:49:29] and then their life falls down
[1:49:31] when they were happy
[1:49:34] don't you know where you're happy
[1:49:36] don't you know where you're being fat
[1:49:38] and you're satisfied
[1:49:41] because of the spirit of God
[1:49:43] why go anywhere else
[1:49:46] why go out in the desert when you're
[1:49:47] standing right here with an oasis
[1:49:50] it's not man
[1:49:52] it's a spirit of God
[1:49:54] that's feeding you let me wind this
[1:49:57] right down now
[1:49:59] Hallelujah
[1:50:01] glory to God my brothers and sisters
[1:50:04] thank you Lord
[1:50:06] Hallelujah
[1:50:09] amen
[1:50:12] thank you Lord I'll just leave some of
[1:50:13] this off and continue on this series
[1:50:17] brother Brad's speaking here
[1:50:20] in recognize your day in this message
[1:50:23] if you want to go listen to that message
[1:50:25] this week it'll be a good message for
[1:50:27] you to listen to
[1:50:29] death doesn't do nothing to a man
[1:50:33] but change has dwell in place
[1:50:36] doesn't change your nature
[1:50:38] doesn't change your faith
[1:50:41] doesn't change nothing in you but your
[1:50:43] dwell in place
[1:50:45] so which way your nature is this morning
[1:50:49] if you are a doubter of God's word
[1:50:53] you will be a doubter over there
[1:50:55] I don't care how holy you are or how you
[1:50:59] live
[1:50:59] by your own works
[1:51:03] it wouldn't change you one bit to die
[1:51:06] just your dwell in place
[1:51:09] and if you can't accept the whole word
[1:51:11] of God the way it's written you won't do
[1:51:15] it there
[1:51:17] so don't worry
[1:51:19] you won't be there
[1:51:21] you've got to accept it in his fullness
[1:51:27] this fullness
[1:51:30] no leaving nothing out
[1:51:33] no leaving not even one word out
[1:51:36] is fullness
[1:51:38] in the power of His Vindication and the
[1:51:41] revelation of what it is and what you
[1:51:45] are and what it says you are you can't
[1:51:48] leave anything else
[1:51:52] then you become a part of it you see
[1:52:00] second Timothy 3 5.
[1:52:04] people having a form of God in this but
[1:52:06] denying the power thereof from such turn
[1:52:08] away
[1:52:10] people that deny
[1:52:14] the power to live this gospel
[1:52:17] that's what I've been trying to say this
[1:52:20] mystery
[1:52:21] is this gospel the power of it to live
[1:52:24] this gospel
[1:52:27] and I'm not in a position to place
[1:52:30] anybody in any category
[1:52:34] well let me tell you I can speak about
[1:52:35] one position which is the Bride of Jesus
[1:52:38] Christ
[1:52:41] she
[1:52:43] wants this word
[1:52:45] in his fullness
[1:52:47] she wants this power
[1:52:50] to live this word
[1:52:52] this is what she wants
[1:52:54] and she'll do everything like the pearl
[1:52:57] of great price
[1:52:59] she'll turn her house her life upside
[1:53:02] down she don't care
[1:53:05] about anything
[1:53:08] but this pearl of great price
[1:53:11] Hallelujah
[1:53:20] last quote then I'll invite our pastor
[1:53:23] up
[1:53:24] the Rapture is here now in the bride
[1:53:27] the overcoming Powers here now in the
[1:53:29] bride
[1:53:30] the third pull is here now operating in
[1:53:34] her little fashions
[1:53:35] as she prays as she speaks the word of
[1:53:38] God it manifestes in her life she sees
[1:53:41] that word coming to pass
[1:53:44] when that squeeze comes to its full
[1:53:46] maturity
[1:53:47] that Mark of the Beast comes to its
[1:53:50] maturity then you'll see that third pull
[1:53:52] that spoken word be manifest in his
[1:53:55] fullness in her
[1:53:57] then she will be called an overcomer the
[1:54:02] Rapture the event will take place
[1:54:05] we are now
[1:54:07] Sons and Daughters of God
[1:54:12] what can we do now
[1:54:18] while this has taken place
[1:54:22] seek
[1:54:24] the kingdom of God
[1:54:28] first
[1:54:29] and his righteousness
[1:54:32] and all these things will be added on to
[1:54:34] you
[1:54:36] knock
[1:54:38] keep knocking
[1:54:40] the unjust judge knock
[1:54:44] Jacob
[1:54:45] I don't know why God is constantly
[1:54:48] bringing these things
[1:54:50] because you need it in your experience
[1:54:52] you needed to become a reality into your
[1:54:55] life and your walk with God keep
[1:54:58] knocking keep seeking
[1:55:01] this is the most evil darkest Ace most
[1:55:04] deception age that there is the spirit
[1:55:06] of the Antichrist is not his fullness
[1:55:09] and strongness it's gross Darkness
[1:55:11] that's why we gotta press with violence
[1:55:14] and blood into the kingdom of God
[1:55:18] don't let nothing cool you down don't
[1:55:21] let nothing don't let this devil come in
[1:55:24] and make you lukewarm and lazy and lock
[1:55:28] seek this word get all hindrance out of
[1:55:31] your life
[1:55:33] remove every sin that besets you
[1:55:38] the coming of the Lord the coming of the
[1:55:40] Rapture is at hand
[1:55:44] the bride
[1:55:45] is almost ready
[1:55:48] to take your flight
[1:55:51] get in
[1:55:54] be like the thief on the cross
[1:55:57] the Ministers of God are trying to
[1:55:59] snatch the last one out of the fire at
[1:56:01] the last minute get in
[1:56:04] it's simple my brothers and sisters
[1:56:08] I didn't I myself did not try to make
[1:56:11] this complicated this morning
[1:56:13] this mystery it's simple
[1:56:18] it's not everything that people are
[1:56:20] proclaiming it to be
[1:56:22] I'm making it out to be this thing is
[1:56:25] simple
[1:56:27] when you love your wife and your wife
[1:56:29] loves you it's simple
[1:56:32] it's not complicated
[1:56:34] you love each other
[1:56:37] and that's the way God is to us
[1:56:40] he loves us more than we can ever
[1:56:42] imagine
[1:56:45] God bless you
[1:56:49] God bless you
[1:57:03] thank you brother amen so it's wonderful
[1:57:06] that God used her brother to be such a
[1:57:09] blessing to every one of us here today
[1:57:12] were you blessed
[1:57:14] I was blessed
[1:57:17] and there are still things out of what
[1:57:19] he said that I have to keep thinking on
[1:57:22] Amen so let's remember to pray one for
[1:57:26] the other pray for the ministers that
[1:57:28] God will bless them and God will cause
[1:57:31] them to grow in their Ministry we give
[1:57:35] God all the honor and the glory here
[1:57:37] today well today is Mother's Day
[1:57:41] it's a wonderful day where we celebrate
[1:57:44] mothers
[1:57:46] unrecognized mothers actually they
[1:57:49] should be
[1:57:51] recognized every day of the year not
[1:57:55] just this one special day but thank you
[1:57:58] but every single day of the year you
[1:58:02] know throughout history and time that
[1:58:06] women have been
[1:58:09] placed as second-class Citizens
[1:58:14] is that the truth
[1:58:16] yeah okay so I want you to acknowledge
[1:58:18] it that's a fact they have been actually
[1:58:21] they were sold
[1:58:23] they were given away like like pieces of
[1:58:27] chattel
[1:58:29] um parents would um sell marry off their
[1:58:34] daughters
[1:58:35] and I ask them don't ask them whether
[1:58:37] they like the the old man or the young
[1:58:41] man or whoever he is and sell them when
[1:58:46] they're from 13 14 years upwards they
[1:58:50] sell them off or give them away to get
[1:58:53] out of debt or something else I'm
[1:58:56] telling it like it is right
[1:58:58] uh this is history and this these are
[1:59:02] facts that uh it's just like even in the
[1:59:06] so-called cultured Society
[1:59:08] women were like chattel they were like
[1:59:12] some some thing that the man owned
[1:59:17] right they didn't have control over
[1:59:20] their own lives or anything whatsoever
[1:59:23] but you know over time God brought them
[1:59:28] as he's bringing the bride into an
[1:59:31] understanding of who they really are
[1:59:34] that they would recognize themselves and
[1:59:37] they would recognize their usefulness
[1:59:39] and that they are not second class
[1:59:42] as I've always used the scriptures to
[1:59:45] say God took the woman out of the man's
[1:59:49] side is that right
[1:59:51] he did not the Bible doesn't say that he
[1:59:55] took her out from under his feet
[1:59:58] no
[1:59:59] uh God did not say that uh he took her
[2:00:05] um you know
[2:00:07] out from under his hand or something
[2:00:09] like that no but God took her from his
[2:00:14] side so I signifying she should walk
[2:00:19] beside him as a help meet a partner an
[2:00:24] assistance somebody it's as if if one
[2:00:28] walk alone and he falls will there be
[2:00:31] not no one there to help him
[2:00:35] but if to walk together
[2:00:38] if one Falls the other was able to help
[2:00:41] him or lift them up he said and again
[2:00:45] the scripture says a two-fold chord is
[2:00:49] not easily broken
[2:00:51] if there are a couple or or a man and a
[2:00:56] woman are united and walking in harmony
[2:01:00] you can't get a razor blade to go
[2:01:04] between the cracks
[2:01:06] you see you can't do it because they are
[2:01:10] one in Christ so I thank God I know the
[2:01:15] the people the young children from the
[2:01:18] Sunday school and the young people also
[2:01:20] have a presentation is that right
[2:01:23] amen okay are they ready
[2:01:29] start getting them ready
[2:01:36] they'll do a program for you and let's
[2:01:38] just sit back and appreciate it
[2:01:41] but I want you to know that I certainly
[2:01:44] appreciate mothers and I appreciate
[2:01:48] Mother's Day and I appreciate my wife
[2:01:52] over there uh just the other day
[2:01:55] somebody was asking me about my sister
[2:01:59] and I said no it's not my sister
[2:02:03] uh
[2:02:05] praise God it's my wife
[2:02:09] praise God hallelujah
[2:02:12] it go exactly it goes I was just about
[2:02:16] to say that sometime it goes the other
[2:02:18] way then they asked me if this is my
[2:02:20] oldest daughter
[2:02:25] and I'm not embarrassed about that I
[2:02:28] feel proud
[2:02:29] that I have such a young wife so I
[2:02:32] praise God for that amen and I pray that
[2:02:35] every one of you men young men in here
[2:02:39] will walk with your wife treat your
[2:02:42] wives as royalty for they are actually
[2:02:46] queens that God has given to you amen he
[2:02:51] types the woman as his queen as his
[2:02:53] bride and we ought to have that same
[2:02:55] thing within our lives oh praise God
[2:02:58] here comes our young people and we pray
[2:03:01] God will bless them and use them here
[2:03:04] today is that okay
[2:03:07] you pray God will use them
[2:03:09] amen let's encourage them

[2:03:13] we're not just here to be Spectators we
[2:03:17] are here to be participators and to
[2:03:20] encourage them we can sit back and just
[2:03:22] look and listen like that but remember
[2:03:25] they their life's got to be watered by
[2:03:28] your uh your thankfulness your gratitude
[2:03:32] and your response to them it's very
[2:03:35] important when you're at that age
[2:03:36] because I remember teachers I remember
[2:03:39] older folks and myself that will even
[2:03:42] turn and even make a small remark and
[2:03:44] say oh that's good
[2:03:46] and that remains with young people so
[2:03:50] don't uh it's a great opportunity
[2:03:52] between when they're young until they
[2:03:55] become adult for you to be a blessing to
[2:03:57] them let's be a blessing to them in
[2:04:00] every way
[2:04:01] when they think they are just being a
[2:04:04] blessing to us we let's be a blessing

[2:14:43] so when God said to Mary bless the
[2:14:45] angels and blessed art thou amongst
[2:14:49] women
[2:14:50] amen now I'm talking to believers
[2:14:53] I'm talking to actual women and I'm
[2:14:55] talking to believers who in relationship
[2:14:58] to God is as a woman as a wife as a
[2:15:01] bride blessed art thou amongst all the
[2:15:06] churchgoers
[2:15:07] blessed are you among all the churches
[2:15:10] blessed are you amongst women amen
[2:15:13] because God elected you to bring forth
[2:15:17] the word amen I thank God for my own
[2:15:21] darling mother who has gone on to be
[2:15:25] with the Lord and God help every one of
[2:15:29] us
[2:15:29] because we are here because we have
[2:15:32] mothers and some of us may not want to
[2:15:36] acknowledge them if you are here today
[2:15:38] and you something between you and your
[2:15:40] mother
[2:15:41] you can make it right you can talk to
[2:15:45] her you can talk to God you can let God
[2:15:48] settle it and let this marvelous
[2:15:50] wonderful warming comforting love of a
[2:15:54] God that we love with our hearts settle
[2:15:56] down upon you and cause you to turn your
[2:16:00] entire life around you know for many
[2:16:03] years I've kept this wonderful poem
[2:16:07] and I've given it to the church here a
[2:16:10] couple of times
[2:16:12] but I'd like to do it here again because
[2:16:15] I always remember my mother uh more so
[2:16:20] Not only was she a mother but she was a
[2:16:23] believing mother
[2:16:25] and then when I received a message and
[2:16:29] brought the word to her and at first she
[2:16:33] wouldn't uh accept or take it but then
[2:16:36] she was a person given to dreams and
[2:16:40] Revelations and stuff like that uh and
[2:16:43] so she slept and then she saw in a
[2:16:48] vision the Lord uh standing on a rock
[2:16:52] and heard voices singing in the
[2:16:56] background
[2:16:57] and they were singing about Jesus my God
[2:17:03] I Know Thy Name
[2:17:05] thy name is all my trust amen and when
[2:17:10] she heard that she jumped out of the bed
[2:17:12] screaming because that's a verse that
[2:17:16] was that's left out in these modern
[2:17:18] times about Jesus being God and so when
[2:17:22] I was telling her Jesus God she was
[2:17:24] telling me of the Trinity and that night
[2:17:26] that's God revealed to her the Oneness
[2:17:29] of God and that the Jesus of the New
[2:17:33] Testament is the same Jehovah of the Old
[2:17:37] Testament one God God the father in The
[2:17:42] Son making himself manifest and so she
[2:17:46] came to believe and that hour of the
[2:17:48] night I can't remember if it was one two
[2:17:50] o'clock but I had to baptize her she
[2:17:53] will not wait
[2:17:56] and we call it a little Trench
[2:18:01] by the side of the house she did not
[2:18:04] care how muddy or whatever she wasn't
[2:18:07] going to be left out of no Rapture or
[2:18:10] nothing of that sort she had to be
[2:18:12] baptized and so I baptized her in the
[2:18:15] name of the Lord my father followed
[2:18:17] after work but thank God for that and
[2:18:20] always kept faithful and true and I give
[2:18:24] God glory for her so I'd like to recite
[2:18:27] this poem here and I want you to think
[2:18:31] of it and applying it to your own mother
[2:18:34] mother
[2:18:37] M is for the million things she gave me
[2:18:42] all means only that she is growing old
[2:18:48] T is for the tears she said shed to save
[2:18:52] me
[2:18:54] each is for her heart
[2:18:57] of purest gold
[2:18:59] e is for her eyes with love like Shining
[2:19:04] have you you you don't know what that is
[2:19:07] when a mother looks at her child she
[2:19:10] doesn't have to put it on or think about
[2:19:12] it the love is just shining true
[2:19:15] right
[2:19:17] e is for her eyes with love light
[2:19:20] shining
[2:19:21] R means right and right she'll always be
[2:19:28] put them all together and they spell
[2:19:31] mother
[2:19:32] a word that means the world to me thank
[2:19:37] God for our darling mothers
