[Music] uh excuse because the pastor himself has set you free to not have to worry about uh anything because what he's saying I I see I see it standing here too. I get all excited and all of a sudden something strikes me and I look back and I see and I think something must be wrong with me back. Yeah. So, uh, anyway, uh, but you're free to worship the Lord. And to me, you know what? I was just thinking that if I, uh, go to a ball game and I pay money to go to that ball game, I'm going to I'm going to get everything I can out. So, I want to leave early. No, I'm not leaving early to the end. I want to get everything I can. And the way that I have to fight to get into here in the house of the Lord, I don't want to be fallen asleep. That's right. I don't want to be if if the spirit touches me, I want to be free. I want to get everything I can before I walk out the door. I don't welcome Holy [Music] Spirit. We are in your [Music] presence.

You know, we we were last week we had some fellowship there and uh actually Sister Carling here was all of a sudden she started giving a testimony and there it was so quiet you would hear. Nobody said a word, but just expressing how what God had done and how he had brought her along. And everything if she were to jump all around praise the Lord right now, I would say bless the Lord. It wouldn't bother me either, but that's the way it ought to be with each one of us. You've been around a long time, brother. You got some moss back spirit. Forget it. You should be praising the Lord. Anyway, this message found me. I was blind and I could not see. down. I was blind and I could not see and something supernatural took place and allowed me to see the the grace of God. Praise him. Praise God. Praise God. If I feel happy again, why shouldn't I praise the Lord? He's been so good to me. [Music] Amen. Praise God. Praise God. You may be seated. As you know, um we will be uh giving announce
