[19:03] do that with one hand and surrender to
[19:06] God all those six Rangers had right now
[19:09] the books of the backlog understand is
[19:11] the same advantage
[19:21] [Music]
[19:29] [Music]
[19:33] the truth was breaking through those

[21:55] premises
[21:56] I was talking to zoom with my good
[21:57] friend Greta baby who spread
[21:59] he's quite a load we usually have some
[22:03] pretty good discussion about scripture
[22:05] very smart he asked one time what I
[22:08] thought was the initial
[22:35] [Music]
[22:42] right
[22:46] [Music]
[23:03] [Music]
[23:15] [Music]

[26:15] greatness of the mothers here amen
[26:18] speaking after the seals not to say the
[26:21] palaces before the seasons it was stuff
[26:24] that they inspire that was leading up to
[26:27] the wonders of the word because between
[26:30] Norma what I'm saying about putting upon
[26:33] to his spirit that you would have to
[26:35] desert to be able to recognize between
[26:39] the man the flesh and the spirit that
