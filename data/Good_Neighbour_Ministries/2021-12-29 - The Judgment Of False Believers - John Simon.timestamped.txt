[0:45] of the year 2021
[0:48] but we are here kept by the power of god
[0:51] through these tumultuous
[0:53] and trying times
[0:56] but god has brought us thus far by faith
[1:00] and he is able to take us home
[1:03] may the lord bless our study
[1:05] this evening this will be a brief study
[1:09] on the philadelphian church age
[1:13] speaking on the topic of
[1:15] false believers
[1:18] the judgment on false
[1:21] believers
[1:23] and
[1:24] our scripture for this evening
[1:27] will be found or is found
[1:30] in revelation
[1:32] chapter 3
[1:34] verse 9.
[1:38] behold
[1:42] i will make them of the synagogue of
[1:46] satan
[1:48] which say they are jews
[1:52] and are not
[1:55] but do lie
[1:57] behold i will make them to come
[2:02] and worship
[2:03] before
[2:05] thy feet
[2:07] and to know
[2:09] that i
[2:10] have loved thee
[2:13] let us pray
[2:16] loving
[2:18] wonderful
[2:20] father
[2:22] we love thee we praise you we worship
[2:26] and adore you
[2:28] we bow down before you
[2:31] we lift you up in this world of sin
[2:35] o god may the holy spirit
[2:39] reflect himself through us
[2:42] may he be glorified
[2:46] may the word of god live again oh spirit
[2:51] the vine
[2:52] may the graciousness
[2:55] of the outpouring
[2:57] of your love and
[3:00] redemptive mercy
[3:02] come upon your people by the
[3:06] instrumentality
[3:08] of the quickened world
[3:10] that you may be receive all the glory
[3:13] all the honor and the praise in the name
[3:16] of jesus as you teach us your way
[3:20] father amen
[3:23] and amen
[3:26] now
[3:27] we note here carefully within this worth
[3:32] that the spirit of god
[3:35] is pointing out to us
[3:38] a problem
[3:40] a problem through the ages
[3:45] of church ages of time
[3:49] and that problem is the problem of false
[3:54] believers
[3:57] and they were
[3:59] or have been in existence
[4:02] since the ending of the very first age
[4:05] right on to this time
[4:08] coming through their springtime of
[4:10] growth
[4:11] their springtime of germination
[4:15] and coming on down through their time of
[4:17] growth
[4:19] and now they are in the time of their
[4:22] fall
[4:23] where they're going to their death
[4:26] because it's come to its rightening
[4:28] process
[4:29] and ready to go and to be burnt as tears
[4:34] in the
[4:35] presence of god
[4:37] by his spoken word
[4:41] now
[4:42] these
[4:44] false believers
[4:46] the bible calls them false jews
[4:50] at that time
[4:52] that applied and was spoken of
[4:56] of the jews
[4:58] the application that is being made this
[5:00] evening
[5:02] is towards
[5:04] believers of
[5:06] christian faith
[5:10] but are found false to their core
[5:15] they have not the real the true spirit
[5:17] of christ
[5:20] they're not really truly born again
[5:25] they do not produce or bring forth the
[5:29] true pure doctrine or word of god
[5:34] but they do lie
[5:36] they misrepresent
[5:38] they misplace
[5:41] they dislocate
[5:43] and do everything within their power
[5:47] maybe not consciously
[5:50] but by being tools
[5:53] of satan
[5:55] they are there to
[5:57] infiltrate
[5:59] and
[6:00] disseminate his evil
[6:03] and to destroy
[6:05] the foundations of the bride tree and
[6:08] the body of jesus christ
[6:11] and we are here to raise up a standard
[6:15] in the name of our lord jesus
[6:18] to come against these
[6:20] unseen works of these unseen devils that
[6:24] are operating in the religious realm
[6:29] now we know
[6:31] that the devil is a counterfeit
[6:35] and therefore his false believers
[6:39] had to appear
[6:41] after the genuine apostolic fate was on
[6:45] the scene
[6:47] once that apostolic faith
[6:50] appeared under the ministry of those
[6:54] wonderful man of god as we found
[6:58] and read of
[7:00] uh in the book of acts
[7:02] then he had a pattern
[7:05] from which he could copy
[7:08] and he is a good copycat
[7:12] once somebody else produces something
[7:16] then he is able to copy it
[7:18] and
[7:19] makes his copy seem
[7:22] to be better
[7:24] when in reality
[7:26] it is inferior
[7:28] to the original
[7:30] that was produced by god spoken word
[7:35] now
[7:36] these people
[7:39] falsely call themselves jews
[7:44] uh we found recently even in our
[7:46] newspapers some that were uh projecting
[7:50] themselves as
[7:52] indians
[7:53] as they were north american indians
[7:57] uh born with that genealogy
[8:01] and then under investigation
[8:05] it was found that this was not so
[8:09] however
[8:10] i'm pointing you to the spiritual aspect
[8:13] of this
[8:15] that many claim to be christian
[8:18] many claim to be believers
[8:21] many claim to be message believers many
[8:26] claim to be believers of the prophet and
[8:30] the bible tells us and the spirit speaks
[8:33] in this hour
[8:35] that they lie
[8:37] and this is not so but these these false
[8:41] believers
[8:43] they always appear
[8:46] after
[8:48] the appearance of the original seed the
[8:51] original believers on the scene
[8:56] they they appeared
[8:59] right after
[9:01] the outpouring of the holy spirit
[9:05] on the day of pentecost
[9:08] and when the move of god continued on
[9:12] and satan had enough time
[9:15] to make his molds his cookie cutter
[9:19] molds
[9:20] that he could create or create his
[9:23] so-called christians
[9:27] and place them
[9:29] uh there within
[9:31] christian ranks
[9:34] uh to infiltrate
[9:36] and to disseminate his evil
[9:39] then we understand paul
[9:43] began to see this the apostles began to
[9:46] discern this in their midst
[9:50] and paul began to speak of
[9:53] ravenous wolves
[9:56] men rising up
[9:58] from among your own cells
[10:01] deceivers
[10:02] liars contrary to the word of god for
[10:06] this day and for the hour
[10:08] and their deceivers up to the brethren
[10:13] using the very same word
[10:16] that is being declared
[10:18] now i want you to see
[10:21] they appeared at the ending of the first
[10:24] age
[10:25] they appeared again in the second age
[10:29] they appeared again
[10:31] in
[10:32] the third age
[10:34] you see
[10:36] their appearance like that is no
[10:38] accident
[10:40] it is absolutely a satanic strategy
[10:44] a demonic plan
[10:46] that comes from the perverted twisted
[10:49] and darkened mind of satan
[10:52] and is presented here up on the earth
[10:56] as we are presented by the mind of god
[10:58] they're presented by the mind on
[11:01] thinking of satan
[11:03] we are not uh physically we are
[11:07] creations but spiritually we come from
[11:11] god and we go to god
[11:13] and those who come from satan will
[11:16] return back to their origin where they
[11:19] come from
[11:21] when their task is over
[11:24] now the principle of satan
[11:27] or the strategy of satan is this
[11:31] i want you to listen carefully
[11:33] because this
[11:35] applies
[11:36] down through the ages
[11:38] until this time in every realm
[11:43] natural
[11:44] and spiritual
[11:46] you can make this application
[11:49] and clearly see
[11:51] in the word of god satan's
[11:54] strategy
[11:56] his strategy
[11:58] my friends
[11:59] is always to claim
[12:02] originality
[12:04] after
[12:05] that the original has gone forth
[12:08] after
[12:10] the
[12:10] uh reel has gone forth
[12:13] then he comes with with his copies
[12:18] he comes with his presumptions
[12:20] and his ideas
[12:23] and presents them
[12:25] claiming
[12:27] originality with them
[12:30] and therefore since he claims
[12:32] originality he claims that he should
[12:36] have certain rights and certain
[12:39] privileges along with
[12:42] that
[12:43] amen
[12:44] now back in the smyrna church age
[12:47] those people lied
[12:50] they told so many lies
[12:52] that there were actually jews
[12:55] like people that they
[12:57] in the various churches claiming that
[13:00] they're christians but not everyone that
[13:03] says
[13:05] they're christian
[13:06] means that they are a christian
[13:09] but lie
[13:10] see
[13:11] and when they do that my friends
[13:15] they are not really believers
[13:18] some who claim they're jews
[13:20] they are not really jews even to this
[13:23] day
[13:25] many claim they're jews they are not
[13:27] jews and others who claim they are
[13:30] christian and they are really not
[13:32] christian there are real jews and there
[13:35] are genuine christians
[13:38] amen but there are
[13:40] multitudes
[13:42] of these false believers
[13:45] of either faith
[13:47] oh my
[13:49] they definitely are not because they do
[13:53] not have the truth within them
[13:57] amen
[13:58] now think of it my brothers
[14:01] amen
[14:02] how they
[14:04] come from the synagogue
[14:07] of satan
[14:08] come from the church the temple
[14:11] of satan
[14:13] the place where they worship him
[14:17] and ah they worship him by organization
[14:21] amen and there none other than his
[14:24] satan's organized crowd that he has
[14:28] collected and put together like nimrod
[14:31] did in the book of genesis organizing
[14:35] the first armies to fight against other
[14:40] nations and subdue them and his
[14:43] his main thought was to dominate
[14:47] to be a dominator
[14:50] uh or you may twist the word a
[14:53] denominator
[14:55] and to denominate uh dominate over all
[15:00] the people
[15:01] whether naturally back then but now with
[15:04] spiritual domination sought by this evil
[15:09] cruel
[15:10] subtle uh strategy of satan that
[15:14] worked
[15:16] and is now working
[15:18] within
[15:19] the body
[15:21] of jesus christ
[15:23] so we are presented with this problem
[15:28] of false believers
[15:32] and almost every preacher whether he's
[15:35] true false mid in midway
[15:38] bottom of the pack top of the pack
[15:40] doesn't matter where he is he will
[15:43] become conscious and aware
[15:46] that this is a common problem that is
[15:50] everywhere regardless of how much that
[15:54] preacher tries whatever he does it has
[15:56] nothing to do with him
[15:58] there's another there's a battle going
[16:01] on
[16:02] a backlog great contest between god and
[16:06] satan
[16:07] yes sir between the true and the false
[16:10] wisdom versus faith amen
[16:14] light versus darkness
[16:16] it's here upon us
[16:18] and we are just represented
[16:21] representatives
[16:23] of either side or praise god as we look
[16:27] into the word of god
[16:30] we see satan using his organized
[16:34] crowd
[16:36] placing them even into the ministry
[16:39] not just in the membership
[16:42] but just place them in the ministry
[16:45] do you know that that satan is now
[16:49] dominating
[16:50] most puppets
[16:53] dominating most church leadership
[16:57] do you know
[16:58] he has raised himself
[17:00] to high
[17:02] places dominating from
[17:06] these high places
[17:08] but take god the true believer
[17:11] the elected of god
[17:13] the true saints of god
[17:16] are lifted up into
[17:18] heavenly places
[17:20] of revelation understanding
[17:23] that they might truly know
[17:25] how to use the sword of the spirit
[17:28] to come against the unbelieving works of
[17:32] satan
[17:33] and his works of darkness
[17:36] yes
[17:38] they're in the ministry
[17:40] dominating and denominating everywhere
[17:44] trying to bring everything
[17:48] under their unwarranted
[17:51] on scriptural
[17:53] leadership
[17:55] not given by god
[17:58] and they're doing that even over there
[18:02] they're ministering brethren they want
[18:04] to be bishops
[18:07] want to be cardinals they want to be
[18:10] whatever else but always over over
[18:14] oppressing
[18:17] their own
[18:19] brothers
[18:21] fellow ministers
[18:23] and
[18:24] dominating
[18:26] over them
[18:27] in every way these are some of the
[18:30] fruits of satan's organized
[18:32] crowd
[18:34] now
[18:35] the next thing we saw
[18:38] in the third age
[18:41] that there was definitely a place called
[18:44] satan's seat
[18:46] because you see he was like a raven
[18:50] raven
[18:51] flying around from the ark
[18:54] searching for somewhere
[18:56] to set his feet
[18:58] and he found a place
[19:01] where he could set his feet on the
[19:04] rotten corpse of unbelief
[19:08] and there feast himself
[19:10] the fullness
[19:11] with the stink
[19:13] and the stench of sin
[19:15] and them my friends the bible said he
[19:19] established a certain place
[19:22] which the bible calls
[19:25] satan's seat seat settled
[19:29] he's found a place where he can work out
[19:32] of there as a headquarters
[19:34] as a place from which he can disseminate
[19:37] operate uh all of his evil webs of
[19:42] unbelief
[19:43] and there my friends
[19:46] he had the power of the state behind him
[19:50] he set up his seat
[19:52] and that age
[19:54] gave us
[19:55] a church and state marriage
[19:59] where he could have the state
[20:01] behind him
[20:02] giving him power
[20:04] backing him up and making that church
[20:09] almost physically invincible
[20:12] but god
[20:14] through the ministry
[20:16] of martin luther a mighty fortress is
[20:20] our god a bulwark never failing
[20:24] our helper he emits the flood
[20:27] of mortal ills prevailing oh praise god
[20:32] forevermore and so god broke through my
[20:36] friends
[20:37] and broke their hold
[20:40] with the over the power of the state
[20:42] and the reformation
[20:44] brought light to the eyes of many of
[20:48] those who sat in ecclesiastical darkness
[20:52] all church spiritual ignorance
[20:56] they sat in darkness but god sent the
[21:00] glimmers of light but after a while
[21:04] the lutherans themselves organized and
[21:08] joined with the same state
[21:10] and again
[21:12] we see or saw
[21:15] the
[21:16] synagogue of satan
[21:18] once again
[21:19] manifested in the sixth age
[21:23] there in this sixth age
[21:26] as uh we know it to be
[21:29] oh now in our day of course
[21:33] this synagogue of satan group
[21:35] they wouldn't say they are of the
[21:37] synagogue of satan no
[21:40] by now he has copied this thing so close
[21:43] that it would deceive the elected if it
[21:45] were possible he has copied the the
[21:49] virtues uh the the the actor and the
[21:53] drama of of the virtues and
[21:56] these things fruits of the spirit oh my
[22:00] he can show them he can cause his people
[22:03] to manifest them even better sometimes
[22:07] than the original seed that will deceive
[22:11] you that he has originality and he has
[22:14] certain rights privileges authorities
[22:17] and powers to be able to say and do the
[22:21] things that he says and does and claims
[22:26] however thank god that god sent a
[22:29] prophet
[22:31] oh my
[22:33] no sir
[22:34] they're not of god
[22:36] they are of their father the devil for
[22:39] they are liars and he was and still is a
[22:44] liar from his beginning from the
[22:46] beginning and upon whomever he falls
[22:50] amen king or commoner and he gets on
[22:55] them and anoints them they become a
[22:59] fountain of lies
[23:02] oh yes
[23:04] they become a source of error
[23:07] such evil web that can entrap millions
[23:12] yes
[23:13] millions not with ropes and chains but
[23:16] ropes and chains but they are chained
[23:20] by in prisons of their mind and so the
[23:24] devil gets a hold of them
[23:27] and they're caught in it
[23:30] oh praise god
[23:32] they lie
[23:34] they lie by their dress
[23:37] their lie by their looks
[23:40] they were all the christian garb
[23:43] all the christian talk
[23:45] all the phraseologies
[23:48] all the
[23:50] so-called christian culture created by
[23:54] satan
[23:55] uh and uh there they find themselves
[23:58] perfection within the circumference of
[24:01] that
[24:02] so-called culture and if they can
[24:05] project the perfection of that culture
[24:08] they think they have perfection holiness
[24:11] and all those marvelous things that
[24:15] can't be bought so taught or anything
[24:18] but is only received by the marvelous
[24:22] amazing grace of our lord jesus christ
[24:26] here we find my friends that a christian
[24:30] or a jew
[24:31] is not a jew outwardly
[24:34] not by just outward acts of keeping
[24:37] traditions
[24:38] of keeping the so-called fate lighting
[24:42] candles doing feasts doing fasts or
[24:45] whatever it's not based upon that at all
[24:49] for salvation is of the lord
[24:52] not of works not of righteousness or
[24:55] anything by which we can boast but by
[24:59] the word of god being revealed to the
[25:03] individual
[25:04] one is not a jew outwardly
[25:07] but a jew inwardly
[25:10] one
[25:11] is not a christian
[25:13] outwardly
[25:14] because they were christian uh where
[25:18] uh they're dressed like a christian talk
[25:20] like a christian walk like a christian
[25:23] and stuff like that that doesn't make
[25:26] one a christian
[25:27] that could be such a cunning deceiver
[25:32] shaped patterned
[25:34] by satan
[25:36] for this last age
[25:39] where believers
[25:41] have to have the
[25:43] eagle eyes
[25:45] of the spirit of almighty god
[25:48] to be able to discern the true and the
[25:51] false
[25:53] oh
[25:54] not even what i am just telling you
[25:56] but something in you the bible tells us
[26:00] true believers will have within them you
[26:03] have a witness within you
[26:05] made that witness witness to you right
[26:08] now that what you are hearing is the
[26:11] word of god may the holy spirit witness
[26:15] if you claim you have him may he witness
[26:18] to you what you're hearing that it is
[26:20] the truth out of the word of god
[26:24] hallelujah spoken by the prophet of
[26:27] malachi 4 5
[26:30] spoken by the voice
[26:34] of the mighty angel thus which is the
[26:37] seventh angel
[26:40] spoken by that
[26:43] instrument of god
[26:45] and now spoken
[26:48] by me
[26:49] and many others
[26:51] as members of that supernatural
[26:54] invisible body
[26:56] called the bride of jesus christ
[27:00] the manifestation of the son of man once
[27:03] again
[27:04] being revealed
[27:06] hallelujah
[27:08] under a different
[27:10] skin
[27:12] under a different badger skin
[27:15] under a different veil
[27:18] but the same voice
[27:20] listen closely my friends he is the same
[27:23] god
[27:24] that uses varieties
[27:28] of men and women children around the
[27:31] world
[27:32] and he will use and whoever whatever he
[27:35] wills to get his message true to speak
[27:38] to his own to call out his bride his
[27:41] original seed bring them to
[27:44] consciousness of himself be conscious of
[27:47] god
[27:48] and recognize the heart that you're
[27:50] living in my friends and the message of
[27:53] this day that you are supposed to
[27:55] receive praise god hallelujah
[27:59] false
[28:00] juice back then they had the problem
[28:05] now we have the problem
[28:07] of false believers
[28:10] that have come in
[28:12] like weeds
[28:14] placed there
[28:16] by the
[28:18] false sewer that came by night
[28:22] and in the darkness of ignorance
[28:25] planted his false seed
[28:27] among the wheat that was planted by the
[28:31] original sower
[28:33] amen
[28:35] but they are false
[28:37] according to jude chapter 9
[28:40] jude 19
[28:41] says
[28:42] having not the spirit
[28:45] that don't have the holy spirit
[28:48] but we know true children of god
[28:51] are born
[28:52] of the spirit
[28:55] these have not the spirit
[28:57] and therefore
[28:58] they are not the children of god
[29:01] no matter how fervently they protest no
[29:04] matter how fervently and emotionally
[29:07] they say it and to what lengths they go
[29:10] to prove that they are
[29:12] they are not they claim they are living
[29:15] but they are dead
[29:17] they are absolutely dead to the word of
[29:20] god for their children
[29:23] of the organization
[29:26] not of the word of god and they're not
[29:30] bearing the true fruits
[29:33] of the
[29:34] word of god or what the word of god will
[29:37] produce in them and through them oh my
[29:42] yes sir they built themselves up
[29:45] upon their own creeds
[29:48] dogmas
[29:50] various doctrines and theologies from
[29:53] the seminaries of man
[29:56] think about it friends
[29:58] i'm saying it but only the spirit can
[30:01] take the words i am saying
[30:04] and cause them to explode within your
[30:07] heart within your soul and to give you
[30:10] real true meaning and understanding to
[30:14] what is being said and beyond what is
[30:18] verbally and vocally said or can be
[30:21] heard oh praise god hallelujah they're
[30:25] dead
[30:27] built
[30:28] upon the signs of darkness
[30:31] various false doctrines
[30:34] and the truth is not in them
[30:36] for they have not taken their own
[30:39] counsel or their wisdom from the word of
[30:41] god
[30:42] but they take it from a college of uh
[30:45] so-called cardinals or they take it from
[30:48] the college of presbyteries or the
[30:51] college of this or the university of
[30:53] that but they do not take it from the
[30:56] unfailing or infallible word of the
[31:00] living god
[31:02] look
[31:03] friends
[31:05] what we are saying here
[31:07] is that if you were to clearly look
[31:11] at the church of jesus christ through
[31:14] the ages
[31:16] even to this age
[31:19] and to this time
[31:20] you will see
[31:22] that within the framework of the bri of
[31:27] the body of christ
[31:29] there are two
[31:31] vines
[31:32] with their
[31:34] branches intertwined and tangled
[31:36] together where it's hard for the natural
[31:39] man
[31:40] to separate the two
[31:43] as the bible says don't pluck them up
[31:45] right now
[31:47] you know them it's okay for you to
[31:49] recognize and know them
[31:51] but don't pluck them up right now
[31:54] the time will come out send the angels
[31:57] that will begin to pluck them up
[31:59] identify them and point them out so they
[32:02] can be plucked out and uh and that he
[32:05] can receive his own glory
[32:09] two different vines
[32:12] two different spirits
[32:15] within
[32:16] the framework
[32:18] of the church of god
[32:21] listen this is nothing new
[32:24] this is in your bible
[32:26] this is the scripture
[32:29] this was in the book of genesis
[32:32] there came an abel
[32:34] within eve's
[32:36] body
[32:38] or one of god
[32:41] one of the devil
[32:42] so it is in our day
[32:45] we can track that or trace that separate
[32:48] seed down through the bible right to
[32:51] this time but we are speaking on the
[32:53] present time that there are these two
[32:56] opposing spirits
[32:59] or vines
[33:01] within the framework of what we call
[33:06] the church of god
[33:08] take the example
[33:10] of jesus and judas
[33:14] jesus
[33:15] was the son of god
[33:17] or the body in which jehovah dwelt
[33:21] and
[33:22] here was judas
[33:24] whom the bible calls he was the son
[33:28] of perdition or the body in which satan
[33:31] actually used for him for his evil uh
[33:35] upon the earth at that time
[33:38] god entered into jesus
[33:42] satan
[33:43] entered into judas
[33:46] absolutely
[33:48] jesus was full of the holy ghost
[33:52] for the holy ghost ministry
[33:55] as we find him acts chapter 10 verse 38
[33:59] how god anointed jesus of nazareth
[34:04] with the holy ghost and with power
[34:08] who went about doing good
[34:11] and healing all that were oppressed of
[34:13] the devil for god was with him
[34:18] amen now it speaks now of judas
[34:23] the bible tells us acts 1 17
[34:26] for judas he judas was numbered with us
[34:32] and obtained a part
[34:35] of this ministry
[34:37] listen
[34:39] matthew 10 1
[34:41] but when he had called unto him his 12
[34:44] disciples
[34:46] he called them gave them power
[34:50] against unclean spirits
[34:53] to cast them out
[34:56] to heal all manner of sickness
[35:00] and all manner of disease
[35:05] so you see if judas had
[35:09] a holy ghost ministry
[35:12] healing the sick
[35:14] casting out devils
[35:17] doing miracles
[35:19] that is why
[35:21] i have over and over again try to point
[35:25] out to you
[35:26] signs wonders miracles and these things
[35:30] perpetrated by various ones who have no
[35:35] message
[35:36] the word
[35:39] signs and wonders on his to attract the
[35:42] attention that you might listen to the
[35:45] word
[35:46] behold see it means stop
[35:49] listen
[35:50] i have something to tell you
[35:52] signs wonders but they have signs
[35:55] wonders they have no message they have
[35:57] nothing behind it
[35:58] there's nothing to point you to the one
[36:01] true god jesus christ the baptism in his
[36:04] name back to see the original sin that
[36:08] really happened in the garden yet not to
[36:11] tell you of the tracing the serpent seed
[36:14] of evil down through the ages to the
[36:17] present time and right on into the
[36:19] future many other things but they don't
[36:22] have it
[36:24] all they have are these things to
[36:26] attract you for their own purposes of
[36:30] which i will speak to you in a moment
[36:34] yes
[36:35] that spirit that was in judas
[36:38] traveled right along with the spirit
[36:41] that was on christ
[36:44] going together
[36:46] jacob esau crow and the dove
[36:50] now jesus chewed us
[36:52] in the same church
[36:54] amen hallelujah one is a pastor
[36:58] preaching the clearing the word judas
[37:01] back in the back
[37:03] in the
[37:04] behind the scenes
[37:06] operating moving in his own way
[37:10] amen
[37:11] when jesus
[37:13] went and hanged him was hanged upon the
[37:16] cross
[37:18] given his life he gave his life as a
[37:21] ransom for many
[37:23] to save souls
[37:25] and to
[37:26] bring them to
[37:27] to himself
[37:29] he commanded
[37:31] his spirit unto god
[37:34] and his spirit went to god
[37:37] came back and was poured out upon the
[37:40] apostles
[37:41] as the holy spirit
[37:44] judas
[37:45] he
[37:46] wasn't hanged on a cross
[37:48] but he hanged himself on a tree
[37:53] and there his spirit
[37:55] went back to satan
[37:57] and after pentecost
[38:00] that same spirit
[38:02] came down
[38:04] towards the ending of the first church
[38:06] age
[38:08] that's why paul recognized it says from
[38:11] among yourself among your own cells
[38:14] will arise
[38:16] false brethren
[38:18] amen ravening wolves
[38:21] they don't come to feed the sheep but
[38:24] they come to fleece the sheep may god
[38:27] have mercy in our day and in our time
[38:32] yes
[38:33] so judas went and hanged himself
[38:36] and i want to point out to you he hanged
[38:38] himself
[38:39] on three trees
[38:43] the first tree
[38:45] that he hanged himself on
[38:48] is
[38:49] the tree
[38:52] that i will call the money tree
[38:55] he hanged himself
[38:57] on the money
[38:58] tree
[39:00] he hanged himself
[39:02] on the tree of
[39:04] popularity and pride
[39:07] he hanged himself
[39:10] on the tree of knowledge of good and
[39:14] evil
[39:15] natural knowledge carnal knowledge
[39:17] whatever knowledge he hanged himself on
[39:20] that tree
[39:22] and you say oh but the bible tells us
[39:24] it's one tree that is true
[39:27] these three trees that i just spoke of
[39:30] are just
[39:32] signifi signifying
[39:35] one tree the tree of unbelief
[39:40] he hanged himself on the tree
[39:43] of
[39:44] unbelief
[39:46] and there my friends
[39:49] his disbelief
[39:51] of jesus christ
[39:53] as the word of god set for that hour
[39:57] failing to recognize his day
[40:00] and the message for his day
[40:03] absolutely
[40:04] now
[40:05] the spirit of christ came back on the
[40:08] day of pentecost anointed the apostles
[40:11] began to do mighty works good works
[40:14] works that would deliver people help
[40:16] people enlighten people
[40:19] cause people to love one another unite
[40:22] with one another walk together
[40:24] amen oh my but then we find that the
[40:30] spirit of judas
[40:31] went
[40:33] and it came back down
[40:35] and where did it go it went right
[40:38] straight for the bag of gold
[40:41] for that's the lust of gold that was
[40:44] always upon judas
[40:47] you remember jesus even had to pay his
[40:50] taxes
[40:51] the bible takes the time
[40:54] the bible god has a purpose a reason for
[40:57] everything and it takes the time to show
[40:59] you that this spirit
[41:02] was the one that held the money bags the
[41:06] collections that jesus had
[41:09] and when jesus wanted to pay his tax
[41:13] and
[41:14] he didn't even bother to turn to judas
[41:18] and ask him to pay his tax out of that
[41:21] money bag he already knew there wasn't
[41:24] there the money in there that should be
[41:26] used so he turned the bill he says no he
[41:28] says peter go to uh the sea and there
[41:32] will be a fish the coin you know the
[41:34] story will be in its mouth but the fact
[41:36] is the bible takes the time again to
[41:39] identify for judas was a thief
[41:43] and the devil is a thief and a robber
[41:46] absolutely and a liar according to the
[41:49] word of god but this spirit of judas
[41:54] always has a a burning lust and greed
[41:58] for gold and for money
[42:02] he loves money
[42:04] and it still loves money to this day
[42:09] absolutely
[42:10] goes about
[42:12] remember this that he was also healing
[42:15] the sick he was also having ministries
[42:18] he's also doing mighty works
[42:21] going about
[42:23] in the name of jesus claiming that he
[42:25] was also a disciple of jesus
[42:29] and while under the cover the disguise
[42:33] of being a disciple of jesus
[42:36] he was
[42:38] mainly collecting money
[42:41] funds
[42:42] oh my getting money so he can buy as
[42:46] many camels as he wanted as many horses
[42:50] beautiful horses as he wanted
[42:53] and comforts that he wanted and
[42:56] he wasn't living the life of a real
[42:59] servant but now he wants to be a prince
[43:02] of the church now he wants to be uh in
[43:06] such a state of luxury instead of being
[43:10] with an amount the people
[43:12] to know the sufferings and the needs of
[43:14] the people however here we find my
[43:17] friends
[43:20] goes about
[43:21] in the name of jesus
[43:24] the spirit of judas
[43:26] holding great meetings
[43:29] gathering together
[43:31] multitudes of people
[43:33] for profit
[43:35] not for genuine holy ghost
[43:38] prophecy
[43:40] for they're not really out
[43:42] for real holy ghost prophecy they are
[43:46] out for prophets that's why they are not
[43:50] true
[43:51] prophets of the living god may god speak
[43:55] to your heart and soul today
[43:58] they have these great big meetings for
[44:00] what
[44:01] love averages the more
[44:04] people you get into the meetings it's
[44:06] the more money they're going to get so
[44:09] they have bigger meetings so they can
[44:11] have bigger money and collect all the
[44:16] more money and
[44:18] big buildings big churches
[44:21] big
[44:22] education
[44:24] and big everything everything with a
[44:26] material concept
[44:29] back of it everything with the thoughts
[44:32] of profit
[44:34] all behind
[44:36] the scenes
[44:38] amen
[44:39] and that watch that spirit
[44:42] that is upon them
[44:43] talk about denying themselves no they
[44:46] won't do that
[44:48] oh absolutely not they would say go god
[44:52] called me to what deny myself
[44:56] i can't deny myself now no they come so
[44:59] soft
[45:00] amen they got to have everything cushy
[45:03] and cushiony
[45:05] they got to have uh
[45:07] some kind of they're not going to travel
[45:08] in a ship or a boat and be shipwrecked
[45:11] like paul they're not going to ride some
[45:14] donkey or a horse no they got to have
[45:17] something better than that they gotta
[45:19] have the modern day
[45:21] best technology of this that the other
[45:25] oh my i tell your friends we see it
[45:29] clear plane don't you be fooled watch
[45:32] the spirit that is upon them my friends
[45:35] judas went about just as if he was one
[45:38] of the twelve
[45:41] he did miracles too
[45:43] but he did not have the spirit of god
[45:46] upon him
[45:47] whatsoever
[45:49] he never went up to pentecost
[45:53] he hanged himself before he could get to
[45:55] the upper room
[45:57] but yet he's gonna claim
[45:59] amen
[46:00] that he is one of them
[46:03] oh my think of it
[46:06] liars
[46:08] lies
[46:09] and liars
[46:10] will always hang their own cells
[46:14] oh
[46:15] absolutely
[46:17] that spirit
[46:18] was on judah that was on judas has
[46:21] returned that is now back here in our
[46:24] age
[46:27] that spirit of religious deceit
[46:30] religious lies
[46:33] and falsehood
[46:34] but they are saturated and consumed with
[46:38] a love
[46:39] of money
[46:41] while hiding under the disguise
[46:44] of modern day christianity
[46:47] and of
[46:48] in general religion they're hiding
[46:51] behind these cloaks
[46:53] of religion rather than walking in the
[46:56] light as he was in the light had no home
[47:00] in which to put his head not to say you
[47:02] are to live that way
[47:04] but modestly
[47:07] humbly
[47:08] sincerely simply
[47:10] but now
[47:11] these want to be high and lifted up
[47:15] recognized to be seen
[47:18] to be known
[47:19] everything else you don't want to live
[47:22] the hidden life
[47:23] they don't want to go behind the veil
[47:26] where the glory never fails oh
[47:29] hallelujah to the lamb oh my god this
[47:33] has gone from the people
[47:35] no king riding on an ass but now he
[47:39] wants to ride on an armored car
[47:42] on the most expensive uh
[47:45] vehicle you can find while whether
[47:48] flying or driving god have mercy oh
[47:52] friends think of it clearly
[47:54] he devil satan never judas never went to
[47:58] pentecost
[48:00] for he was not a true seed
[48:03] he was not a true child of god no sir
[48:07] whoa
[48:08] but yet he cast out devils yet he was
[48:10] healing the sick you say how could that
[48:12] be how could a man have a a holy ghost
[48:15] ministry and still be a devil all my
[48:18] friends we want we won't talk about that
[48:21] or uh on that but we'll just give you
[48:24] the scripture to fertilize your thought
[48:27] gifts
[48:28] and callings
[48:30] are without repentance
[48:33] in other words that god places the gifts
[48:37] within the individuals
[48:41] amen before they repent
[48:44] before their conscience are aware of
[48:46] anything so having gifts manifesting
[48:50] through that
[48:52] life
[48:53] you got to go right back into the realm
[48:56] of the soul
[48:58] and see what's
[48:59] nature what's influencing that back
[49:02] there
[49:03] and recognize the original seed from the
[49:06] presence of almighty god
[49:10] yes
[49:12] the devil may fully elect
[49:15] some of the time
[49:17] but as one great man said
[49:19] you can fool some of the people some of
[49:22] the time
[49:23] but you cannot fool all of the people
[49:26] all of the time
[49:28] you may the devil may fool some of the
[49:30] elect
[49:32] distract them delude them for a season
[49:35] of time
[49:36] yes but he cannot fool all of god's
[49:40] people all of the time for they are
[49:44] they're going to come back to that
[49:46] original word which their spirit all
[49:49] already recognized and seen oh praise
[49:52] god don't be fooled
[49:54] and you won't be fooled
[49:57] but jesus said the elect will not be
[49:59] deceived they will not be fooled amen
[50:03] yes
[50:04] many of those christians
[50:07] so called claim they're christians
[50:10] match their lives match their walk match
[50:13] their talk match their doctrine their
[50:15] dogmas
[50:16] and so on with the word of god
[50:20] some of them will literally hinder you
[50:22] from reading the word and say oh you
[50:24] don't need to read the word of god the
[50:26] minister reads the word of god so why do
[50:28] you have to read it no
[50:30] every christian reads their bible and
[50:33] prays every day individually for
[50:36] themselves
[50:38] so they can see
[50:40] even what i am saying
[50:42] they can compare and see whether it is
[50:45] true
[50:46] amen and you are obligated to do that by
[50:50] the word of god
[50:51] amen
[50:52] listen to the word of god
[50:55] i will make them come
[50:58] and worship before thy feet
[51:02] and to know that i have loved thee
[51:07] corinthians 6 2
[51:09] do you not know that this saints
[51:12] shall judge the earth
[51:14] oh i'd love to speak on that some people
[51:16] says oh don't judge
[51:18] don't judge they don't know what they're
[51:21] talking they're thinking carnally the
[51:23] judgment of carnality but not the
[51:26] judgment by the word of god for the
[51:28] bible tells you the saints
[51:30] shall judge the earth listen closely
[51:33] here in the word of god
[51:35] amen
[51:36] not
[51:37] only will the saints judge the earth
[51:41] but the ark will be judged
[51:44] the bible tells us the judgment was set
[51:46] and there was 24
[51:48] elders amen
[51:51] the great throne god sitting there
[51:54] like a king with his counselors around
[51:56] them 24 elders
[51:59] my
[52:00] 24 elders
[52:02] wow what is that
[52:04] 12 apostles prophets
[52:07] 12
[52:08] represent the 12 representing israel old
[52:12] testament
[52:13] 12 apostles
[52:15] new testament
[52:16] representing the gentile dispensation

[52:48] that god loves them
[52:50] and when anyone says that it's hard for
[52:52] you to say no it's not so you just leave
[52:55] it alone

[52:59] and he will be able to make it all known
[53:03] and we'll know who is a child of god
