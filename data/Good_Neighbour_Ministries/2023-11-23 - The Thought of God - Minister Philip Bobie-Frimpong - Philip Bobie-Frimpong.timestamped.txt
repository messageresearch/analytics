[31:21] him there was no any other reason you
[31:23] were created to Worship the Lord Jesus
[31:25] Christ amen I'm going to read just
[31:28] little quote here and go ahead with it
[31:30] in
[31:31] um 59
[31:35] 11:21 it says
[31:38] that do I love
[31:42] him is my is my love
[31:45] sufficient for
[31:48] him have I
[31:50] loved and put him
[31:53] first when I wake up at morning do I
[31:58] first thing do the first thing I do
[32:01] praise him in other words when you wake
[32:03] up in the morning do you rejoice in the
[32:04] Lord you praise God for give you another
[32:08] day that's what he asking all through
[32:11] the day do I praise him in my decisions
[32:17] do I ask
[32:18] myself is it your will
[32:21] Lord
[32:23] do do I really put him first in
[32:28] everything does he come first if he does
[32:33] let's just sing again and think of it in
[32:35] other words let's put God first let's
[32:39] give him praise let him glory and the
[32:42] honor let's worship Our God he deserves
[32:44] to be worshiped it doesn't matter what
[32:47] you go through you got to worship God
[32:50] the greatest thing that could happen to
[32:52] anyone of us is the Salvation of our
[32:55] souls money cannot buy money is good
[32:59] money can do all things but it cannot
[33:01] give life money cannot give you Joy
[33:04] cannot give you happiness cannot give
[33:05] you peace of Peace but God himself the
[33:08] Lord Jesus Christ the peace of God it
[33:11] passes all understanding so God has
[33:14] given us the most things that money
[33:17] cannot buy so we have to be most
[33:20] happiest people on the face of this
[33:23] Earth it doesn't matter what you go
[33:26] through
[33:27] we should go with happiness and joy in
[33:30] our hearts in Proverbs it says that um I
[33:33] think Proverbs
[33:35] 1513 let I just want to say exactly how
[33:38] it says over
[33:40] there Pro Proverbs
[33:48] 153 a mer heart make a cheerful
[33:52] continence but by sorrow of the heart
[33:54] the spirit is broken that means that you
[33:57] are marrying your heart your countenance
[33:59] will change people will see how can it
[34:02] be happying you how can how those will
[34:04] hear because it begins from your heart
[34:06] it begins in the morning when you wake
[34:08] up you got to praise God no matter what
[34:11] how late you are say thank you Jesus I
[34:14] praise your name I'm blessed I'm blessed
[34:17] I'm blessed I'm blessed every day that I
[34:19] live I'm blessed when I wake up in the
[34:21] morning till I Lay My Heart to rest and
[34:24] blessed this shouldn't be just a song to
[34:27] it should be a life that we are living
[34:29] as Christians that we are blessed by the
[34:32] Lord Jesus Christ he's given us our
[34:34] health he's given us a place to lay
[34:36] ahead he's given us our family he's
[34:38] given us so many things we deserve to
[34:40] worship him we deserve to glorify thy
[34:43] name oh man he deserve to be praised you
[34:46] know people pay money to go to
[34:49] psychiatrists just to scream but you are
[34:51] privileged just praise God and thank God
[34:55] praise Him 24 hours Worship the Lord
[34:58] with all your heart the thing of it is
[35:01] listen God does not share his office of
[35:05] worship with anyone he alone deserve to
[35:08] be worshiped that's why he cast Satan
[35:11] from Heaven because he being a creation
[35:14] of God wanted to receive worship and God
[35:17] hated that so he cast him out and anyone
[35:20] who says a man of God whatever it is and
[35:23] try to take worship something is wrong
[35:27] somewhere amen because God deserves her
[35:29] to be worshiped I don't care how much
[35:32] Miracles how much that person said he's
[35:34] a man of God if you allow people to bow
[35:37] down to him if you allow to receive
[35:39] worship something is wrong because in
[35:41] the Bible nobody receive worship only
[35:44] Jesus Christ only God here is your Lord
[35:47] God is one God he alone deserves to be
[35:51] worshiped and the thing of it is if you
[35:53] worship God in heaven you worship him

[36:21] Daughters of God shout for joy that was
[36:23] in heaven that's what you were doing

[37:10] glorified we deserve to be Praise on
[37:13] Earth here because we did it back then
[37:16] if you worship him as he tried to let
[37:19] job recognize that that when job was out
[37:22] there he was worshiping God so he tell
[37:24] me where were you where s God Sons and
[37:27] Daughters of God worship God sing praise
[37:29] onto God I was there amen you were there
[37:33] amen when you sing and shout for Joy so
[37:36] a son or daughter of God that's a Seed
[37:38] of Abraham the Bible said that Abraham
[37:40] never staggered at the promise of God
[37:43] but he was constantly praising God
[37:45] giving glory to God so it doesn't matter
[37:47] what condition you are in tonight it
[37:49] doesn't matter what situation you face
[37:51] as a Seed of Abraham you have to give
[37:54] praise to God you have to glorify we
[37:56] have to exalt him because he deserves
[37:59] our worship he deserves to be glorified
[38:01] don't look at your
[38:03] conditions and don't look at because
[38:05] your conditions does not change your
[38:07] position your position is a son or
[38:10] daughter of the Living God it those
[38:13] things are temporary it all came to pass
[38:17] none of them came to say so a Seed of
[38:20] Abraham a true bride of Christ will
[38:23] worship God no matter what situation
[38:25] they go through no matter what they are
[38:27] feeling no matter what their eyes are
[38:29] seeing no matter what condition they
[38:31] find themselves in they will worship the
[38:34] true Living God they'll give him praise
[38:36] they'll give him the glory they'll lift
[38:38] up your hands and say thank you Jesus

[38:54] Savior Jesus Christ he had never lost a
[38:57] battle he's a physician that never lose
[39:00] a patient he's oh a lawyer that never
[39:02] lost a case his name is Dr Jesus Christ
[39:06] he's my king he's my Lord he's my
[39:08] everything so I'm here to worship God
[39:11] let no one that disturb you let no one
[39:13] take it away from you either you the
[39:15] devil like I'll worship God Amen I'll
[39:18] worship him in the night in the morning
[39:20] in the evening every time I worship my
[39:22] King Jesus because he deserves to be
[39:24] worshiped he deserves to be glor
[39:26] glorified Hallelujah he doesn't share
[39:28] his glory with anyone only him deserve
[39:31] to be worshiped Hallelujah that's why
[39:34] you could check in the
[39:37] Bible
[39:39] um Peter and Barnabas when God used them
[39:45] to heal those people to heal that sick
[39:48] woman whoever that insane person was
[39:51] they wanted to worship them they did
[39:54] everything they called him God of
[39:55] Jupiter God of this and they cast
[39:57] themselves and they refuse it bluntly
[40:01] because they are human being they are
[40:04] they are Saints children of God saved by
[40:07] the grace of God they are creation of
[40:09] God so they won't accept the worship and
[40:13] none of them nobody no man of God
[40:16] receive worship even in Revelation
[40:19] Chapter 19
[40:22] Verse the Bible stud this we're going to
[40:24] talk a lot 1910
[40:26] and he said I fell at his
[40:29] feet to worship
[40:32] him and he said unto me see thou do it
[40:37] not I am thy fellow servant and of thy
[40:42] breing they have the testimony of Jesus
[40:46] worship God for the testimony of Jesus
[40:50] is a spirit of Prophecy so
[40:54] nobody God res
[40:56] his office of
[40:58] worship for
[41:01] himself not for anybody
[41:04] else so no matter what you go through no
[41:08] matter what situation you are in you got
[41:11] to worship God you have to love God so
[41:14] much that when he asked him for
[41:17] something and he said yes we worship you
[41:21] you going to praise him even if he said
[41:23] no there shouldn't be a difference
[41:25] because he knows why he said no and if
[41:28] you are a season son or daughter of God
[41:31] you recognize that even though he know
[41:34] is good because all things work together
[41:37] for good to them that love God so all
[41:41] those things in the end will come and
[41:43] work for your good so you have to
[41:45] worship God regardless the problem of it
[41:48] that's why he said that count your
[41:49] blessings and name them one by one it
[41:52] will surprise you what the Lord has done
[41:55] for you the children of Israel they made
[41:58] a big mistake that's why only Joshua and
[42:01] Caleb was able to go to the promised
[42:04] land out of millions why those people
[42:06] did not forget what God did for them God
[42:11] by his grace and mercy he had told them
[42:13] to apply the blood when I see the blood
[42:17] I'll pass over you that types a token
[42:20] and all those who did not apply the
[42:23] blood their first born even doesn't
[42:25] matter if you are children of Israel you
[42:28] are Israelite and you killed that lamb
[42:30] you did everything if you not apply it
[42:33] on your Lamb on the on the door poost
[42:35] that angel of death will kill your
[42:37] firstborn son and God delivered them out
[42:40] of that all the Egyptian first born and
[42:43] they died but the children of Israel God
[42:46] preserved them but you remember when
[42:49] they got into the Red Sea they forgot
[42:53] what God has done for them because they
[42:55] saw all that their eyes was seen by cor
[42:58] was the Egyptians Army coming and the
[43:00] rest in front of them and they were
[43:03] stopped in the middle so they thought we
[43:05] are dead Moses why do you bring us here
[43:07] why didn't leave us to go go back and Le
[43:10] our garlic you see God said I'm bringing
[43:13] you to what a Promised Land a land full
[43:16] of honey and milk but when they got into
[43:19] that situation they forgot what God has
[43:23] done for
[43:24] them but the TR true seed of God Joshua
[43:28] and Caleb among them they remember what
[43:30] God has done and Jose and Moses told the
[43:33] the the the crowd he said be still and
[43:37] know the salvation of God for this
[43:39] Egyptians that you see them you will see
[43:42] them no
[43:44] more God is
[43:47] great he delivered them and let them
[43:51] walk on the bare food in between the Red
[43:53] Sea How great is our God
[43:56] how great is his worth how great is he
[44:00] amen How Great Is Our God how great is
[44:03] his worth he's the greatest one that
[44:05] ever lived he rode back the mighty Red
[44:09] Sea and said follow and on I will lead
[44:12] you he R back the Red Sea and they
[44:14] passed
[44:16] through what an
[44:18] experience what an experience some of us
[44:21] had in our lives see God call us God has
[44:24] done take so much mountains delivered us
[44:27] from so many things some from droughts
[44:29] some from humanizing some from this some
[44:32] from so many things that God has brought
[44:35] us
[44:36] out some of us on the best on the best
[44:39] on the death on on B death God came and
[44:43] rescue us delivered us from accidents do
[44:46] so mighty work to us and when a little
[44:49] problem comes you begin to bow down you
[44:52] begin to cry begin to forget what God
[44:55] has done for us in the the past go back
[44:57] to your experience remember what God has
[45:00] done for you in the past some
[45:02] experiences that nobody can take it from
[45:05] you if you a true bride of Christ God
[45:07] gave you some some points some points
[45:10] certain things happen in your life that
[45:12] you know that you know that it was God
[45:15] that came in that situation and if you
[45:18] have that experience just think on those
[45:21] think on those don't think about the bad
[45:24] stuff don't think about your your
[45:26] downside don't think about when you are
[45:27] down don't think about when you lost the
[45:30] battles think about when you won the
[45:32] battles let us Samson did when he was in
[45:36] a when Samson was in that
[45:39] situation and things were so bad to him
[45:43] he
[45:43] remembered what God has done to him and
[45:47] he think on those
[45:48] things and so God you've done this
[45:51] you've done this for
[45:53] me we repented
[45:56] and when he repented he got a victory is
[46:00] that right so that same God is here
[46:02] tonight count your blessings name them
[46:07] one by one it will surprise you What the
[46:11] Lord Has Done For You amen so what am I
[46:16] saying that we should
[46:20] always think on the positive things the
[46:25] good things things that the Lord has
[46:27] done for us amen praise our God our God
[46:32] is good okay I'm going back to the next
[46:37] verse
[46:40] verse
[46:42] five it said Philippians
[46:46] 45 be
[46:50] careful with vers 5 let your moderation
[46:54] be known unto all men the Lord is at
[47:00] hand be careful for
[47:04] nothing but in everything by
[47:08] prayer and
[47:10] supplication with
[47:13] Thanksgiving let your
[47:15] request be made unto God that means that
[47:20] we have to give God thanks and bring our
[47:24] request to him
[47:26] Our God has never changed he's the same
[47:31] yesterday today and
[47:34] forever he will never leave us nor
[47:38] forsake us if prayer will bring God down
[47:42] why don't you pray pray
[47:46] pray
[47:48] Daniel did prayer and supplication in
[47:51] other words sometimes you become self
[47:54] centered
[47:56] sometimes we become we think only of
[47:59] ourselves Lord give me this Lord give me
[48:02] that Lord give me that it's good but
[48:05] let's go to God with supplication let's
[48:08] go and give him thanks let's go and
[48:10] worship god let's give him praise let's
[48:13] repent of our sins let's put things
[48:15] together and when you've done all that
[48:18] let's put other people first pray for
[48:21] one another pray for your brethren pray
[48:23] for the needs of others Abraham
[48:26] interceded for his cousin Lord let's
[48:30] intercede for one another once sometime
[48:32] you don't know even what people are
[48:34] going through but just pray for them
[48:35] anyhow pray for one another and as you
[48:38] pray for one another and you think on
[48:41] other people it comes back to you
[48:44] unconsciously your needs are even met
[48:47] without even mentioning anything because
[48:49] why you have put others
[48:52] first Jesus Christ came to live for you
[48:55] you and me he never live for himself
[48:59] because of you and me he came to shed
[49:02] his blood for you and me so he came to
[49:06] live for you let's live for others
[49:08] Christianity is not living for yourself
[49:12] it's all based on living for others
[49:16] amen I'm going to read this quote about
[49:20] prayer then I
[49:23] continue okay in uh be certain of God
[49:28] paragraph
[49:29] 21 it said that what we need
[49:33] today is not a lot of material things we
[49:37] have
[49:38] that we don't need greater
[49:42] churches we don't need greater
[49:45] congregations we don't need more on
[49:47] Radio and on
[49:50] television we don't need so many more of
[49:54] these things
[49:56] but what we need
[49:58] today to be
[50:00] spiritual is a person that will humble
[50:04] themselves before God if they don't have
[50:09] if they haven't got a penny and will
[50:13] pray till that Spirit within them is
[50:17] satisfied with the goodness of God and a
[50:21] Revival takes place on the inside of
[50:24] your heart that changes their attitudes
[50:28] and atmosphere that they live in you
[50:31] might not have a pair of shoes on on
[50:34] your feet you might be dressed in racks
[50:36] but something in your heart singing The
[50:39] Melodies of God are rather have it than
[50:43] all the man in the world be setting of
[50:47] God you got to beetled of God it doesn't
[50:52] mean that there's anything bad with me
[50:55] money money is good if you know how to
[50:59] use it if you have the character to
[51:02] manage it because now you have the
[51:04] character you can use money wisely but
[51:07] the emphasize is not on money the
[51:09] emphasize is how the only way you can
[51:13] communicate with God is through
[51:15] prayer so that's the only way you can
[51:18] have that relationship with God pray
[51:21] pray pray pray there's one thing you can
[51:24] sing too much you can preach too much
[51:26] you can do but you can never pray too
[51:29] much I wish I therefore a man pray
[51:33] everywhere lifting up holy hands and
[51:36] giving thanks to God Amen so we have to
[51:39] pray we have to set time aside and pray
[51:44] because remember when you set time aside
[51:47] to prayah said before you even go there
[51:51] that angel of God is meeting you over
[51:53] there as you have set time to be he here
[51:56] to preach the gospel to be here 7:30
[51:58] before we get here God is there already
[52:02] it's up to how much you can believe all
[52:05] things are possible to them that believe
[52:07] it's not about me it's about you making
[52:10] your heart right to receive your need so
[52:13] God is here already so when you set some
[52:16] time apart to pray God will meet you
[52:20] there I know a prayer a Christian pray
[52:24] every everywhere lifting up holy hands
[52:28] praising God as he said in the beginning
[52:30] we pray all the time but we have also to
[52:34] have a quiet time with the Lord after
[52:38] all the days job when we are
[52:41] tired so many busy you need to calm down
[52:46] find some quiet place some quiet place
[52:49] and pray and put your burdens onto God
[52:53] the problem you have is that we try to
[52:56] do it by
[52:58] ourself God is interested in everything
[53:01] about
[53:03] us there's nothing too small for
[53:07] God as we read over here before do you
[53:11] consider God in all your decisions
[53:14] making during the day do you commit
[53:16] yourself to the Lord Jesus Christ do you
[53:19] allow him to take control over your
[53:21] life you have to commit everything
[53:25] into God's hands he's interested in
[53:29] everything said that that the song said
[53:32] that um it says the song said that um
[53:38] there's a song that said that what a
[53:41] privilege is to carry Everything To God
[53:44] In
[53:45] Prayer what a friend we have in
[53:48] Jesus what a privilege to carry
[53:51] everything not something Everything To
[53:54] God In Prayer prayer and leave it there
[53:57] prayer is important prayer is the things
[54:02] that connect us with God but the problem
[54:04] of Fai is sometimes some of us when we
[54:07] pray it become
[54:09] onesided we have to commune with God
[54:13] communion is two people talking and
[54:15] talking back when you cry to God quiet
[54:19] down and let him speak back to you
[54:22] because like you having Fellowship that
[54:25] and I'm the only one talking then that
[54:27] Fellowship will not go because one sided
[54:29] when I talk I'll need you to talk back
[54:31] to me so that's what God expects let's
[54:35] pray to him and let's hear him what he
[54:38] wants us to do he will speak to you one
[54:40] way or the other so let's commun with
[54:42] our maker let's give him an opportunity
[54:45] let him have preeminence pray pray pray
[54:49] prayer is the engine the source of The
[54:51] Engine House engine room for the house
[54:54] for the church let let's pray for the
[54:55] service let's spend time as B said don't
[54:59] just come to church before you can pray
[55:01] up and if you pray that will receive
[55:03] your need because Jesus Christ is here
[55:06] to speak your needs into existence you
[55:09] pray you prayed and you are fire up and
[55:12] I pray that I'm fire up you don't need
[55:15] the s that we don't have to hustle
[55:17] because we already in the
[55:19] spirit and everything will flow nobody
[55:22] has to struggle because everything is in
[55:24] place
[55:26] our God is an awesome God let's go back
[55:29] to the basics pray every day read your
[55:32] Bible and listen to the
[55:35] tapes as brother Jo Smith said one time
[55:38] even 20 minutes a day on the tapes will

[55:43] that let's listen to the Tes let's read
[55:45] our Bible let's pray every day God will

[58:19] many we can't pay him back we are here
[58:22] to worship him for what he has done for
[58:24] us
[58:25] we have to give him praise and the honor
[58:27] because the reason why he created us is
[58:29] to worship him nothing
[58:33] else no wonder that slave man he said
[58:37] that I don't want any crowns I just want
[58:41] to see his face and worship Him

[59:01] lost he knows where he has been when we
[59:04] give God praise even the angels cannot
[59:05] be understand because go what we have
[59:08] gone through and God bring us back we
[59:11] appreciate him more we give him more
[59:13] thanks and praise and the angels who
[59:16] have never sin they worship God 24 hours
[59:19] the chobs and the sarapin when Isaiah
[59:23] was in the presence of God he saw them
[59:26] holy holy God Almighty they worship what
[59:29] about this if you worship him about them
[59:32] you have to worship him here amen 24
[59:35] hours doesn't matter what our God is
[59:38] good amen praise God
[59:42] hallelujah thank you
[59:45] Jesus Hallelujah and the problem of
[59:47] faith
[59:49] is
[59:50] sometimes is our approach to
[59:53] prayer
[59:55] because God never
[59:58] changed he will never give someone ice
[1:00:01] cream and when you come he'll give you
[1:00:03] different if you come the same way the
[1:00:05] scripture said that Elijah was a man
[1:00:07] subject to like passion like you and I
[1:00:11] he made mistake he has his temper he has
[1:00:13] that but the Bible said he prayed
[1:00:16] earnestly that should not rain in the
[1:00:19] span of three and a half years it never
[1:00:22] rain he prayed again and and Rain came
[1:00:25] earnestly means that he prayed
[1:00:28] sincerely if we go to God and prayed
[1:00:32] sincerely I believe whatever you have
[1:00:36] need of he will grant it to us he will
[1:00:39] surprise you he will do things that you
[1:00:43] never even thought of our God is
[1:00:46] wonderful amen he's the same God who has
[1:00:49] never changed
[1:00:52] hallelujah praise God and I I used to
[1:00:54] call this the verse eight braam
[1:00:59] said those are the thoughts of
[1:01:02] God in the
[1:01:05] Philippians chapter 4:
[1:01:12] 8 because remember that any thought that
[1:01:17] pass through your mind that is contrite
[1:01:19] the word of God is from Satan and if
[1:01:22] it's in the line of God's word
[1:01:25] is God those are God's thoughts and the
[1:01:28] devil's thought but the greatest battle
[1:01:31] ever forth is going on even right
[1:01:35] now even is the mind yes it's going the
[1:01:39] mind even as the word is going forth
[1:01:42] it's up to you you have that ability to
[1:01:47] accept or reject God gave us Choice he
[1:01:52] never create us and make us like a Dy he
[1:01:55] gave us a choice so your choices will
[1:01:58] lead you to your final destination so
[1:02:01] even right now you can choose to accept
[1:02:03] the word of God and have your freedom
[1:02:06] and have your deliverance or you can
[1:02:08] choose to reject it and stay in your
[1:02:10] condition it's your choices Jesus Christ
[1:02:13] was to be here he cannot heal you
[1:02:16] because he di he done away in know 2,000
[1:02:20] years ago when he died on Calvary he was
[1:02:22] wounded for your trans he was bruised
[1:02:26] for your iniquity the chastisement of
[1:02:27] his peace was upon you and with stripes
[1:02:30] you were healed is done
[1:02:33] deal it's up to you to accept or
[1:02:39] reject so your acceptance will bring
[1:02:42] your healing your acceptance will bring
[1:02:45] your financial Deliverance your
[1:02:48] acceptance will bring whatever you have
[1:02:50] in of
[1:02:51] tonight if you reject it you can't get
[1:02:54] it so it is somebody was asking me oh
[1:02:56] some you can't think the way he wants to
[1:02:59] think those are not your
[1:03:01] thoughts if you accept them that it
[1:03:04] becomes yours one brother was saying
[1:03:07] that he said Satan I send it back to
[1:03:09] Jehovah Witness where he came from that
[1:03:11] is not my thought I a son of the Living
[1:03:13] God God created me and God is my father
[1:03:17] so I accept God's s so that's why I said
[1:03:20] whatsoever things that are of good
[1:03:23] report
[1:03:25] whatsoever things that are
[1:03:28] true whatsoever things that are
[1:03:31] honest whatsoever things that are just
[1:03:35] whatsoever things that are pure
[1:03:38] whatsoever things that are lovely
[1:03:41] whatsoever things are of good
[1:03:44] report if there be any
[1:03:47] virtue think on these things amen and
[1:03:53] bra brah said over here
[1:03:57] see um paragraph 111 greatest battle
[1:04:00] ever fought see it's your
[1:04:04] mind that opens the
[1:04:07] door or closes the
[1:04:09] door and listen to your conscience
[1:04:13] listen to your memory listen to your
[1:04:16] affections but when your mind closes
[1:04:19] itself to these things and let God
[1:04:23] Spirit of his word come in it blows the
[1:04:27] rest of the staff out every doubt is
[1:04:31] gone every fear is gone every sensation
[1:04:36] of Doubt is gone every feeling is gone
[1:04:39] there is
[1:04:41] nothing standing there but the word of
[1:04:45] God and Satan cannot battle against that
[1:04:50] no say he cannot battle against it now
[1:04:54] we know his truth in other words when
[1:04:56] you place the word of God in your heart
[1:04:59] no devil can battle against that
[1:05:02] Christians cancel is not the matter of
[1:05:04] matter not your thought that bring but
[1:05:06] the word of God goes through the channel
[1:05:09] of your thought and create everything
[1:05:11] let you have your what Deliverance so
[1:05:14] place that word of God by listening the
[1:05:16] T by praying every day and let God have
[1:05:19] the preeminence and brother that a man
[1:05:22] cannot even sin unless he get himself
[1:05:25] out of the presence of God when you take
[1:05:27] yourself from the presence of God when
[1:05:29] you are not conscious that's why David
[1:05:31] said I always Place God in front of me
[1:05:34] in psalm 16 he's always conscious of God
[1:05:38] when you are conscious of the Living God
[1:05:41] nothing nothing can penetrate through so
[1:05:45] let's place the word of God and think on
[1:05:49] the things that are true those good
[1:05:51] reports think on them give God thanks
[1:05:55] count your blessings name them one by
[1:05:57] one it will surprise you what the Lord
[1:06:00] has done for you if there's anything
[1:06:02] that I wanted to Grant here tonight that
[1:06:05] let's remember what God has done for us
[1:06:09] he has done so much for us you are
[1:06:11] privileged I was just thinking about it
[1:06:13] today myself that by the grace of God
[1:06:17] when this word of God was presented to
[1:06:19] me in the midnight around 12:1 when I
[1:06:22] saw the way the God was using the
[1:06:25] prophet to heal the people something I
[1:06:27] unor in my heart if Jesus Christ was to
[1:06:30] here that's the way you'll be healing
[1:06:32] the people it was a grace of God that
[1:06:35] came to your door it's grace of God
[1:06:37] millions are
[1:06:39] perishing they don't have a clue what is
[1:06:42] going
[1:06:43] on but you by the grace of when Christ
[1:06:46] was here in that time when those he was
[1:06:50] on the donkey people were worshiping him
[1:06:53] they were asking who is this majority of
[1:06:56] the people missed that that time and
[1:06:58] majority are missing it even this time
[1:07:01] but you and me by the grace of God when
[1:07:05] this word was presented to you something
[1:07:07] in you which is God himself accepted it
[1:07:12] and is that said the Lord so you should
[1:07:16] be the most happiest people on the face
[1:07:19] of this Earth regardless of any
[1:07:21] circumstances regardless of any anything
[1:07:24] that comes your way our God is matching
[1:07:27] on let's match on the word of God let's
[1:07:30] give him thanks let's give him praise
[1:07:31] let give him the honor and the glory
[1:07:33] because he deserve to be worshiped he
[1:07:35] deserves our worship he deserves Our
[1:07:37] Praise he has done so much for you and
[1:07:40] me so let's not
[1:07:43] forget what God has done for us like the
[1:07:47] children of Israel they didn't have a
[1:07:50] short memory they couldn't make it
[1:07:54] but it's getting to a time it's not
[1:07:58] about you or me he himself has done it
[1:08:01] already because all that the father has
[1:08:03] given me will come to me all that you
[1:08:06] have to do is be simple and leave a
[1:08:10] simple Christian Life and God will make
[1:08:16] the difference God will take control
[1:08:19] over the situation because he take care
[1:08:22] of every situation
[1:08:24] don't worry don't get flustered don't
[1:08:27] look at the condition don't look at the
[1:08:29] economic condition don't look at
[1:08:30] anything else look to Calvary look to
[1:08:33] Jesus look at him he came he didn't have
[1:08:37] to go through that they smack him they
[1:08:40] spit on his face they did all kind of
[1:08:43] things for him but he said father
[1:08:45] forgive them they didn't know what they
[1:08:48] are doing that was for you and me they
[1:08:51] were
[1:08:52] blinded so that you and I can get in
[1:08:58] what a privilege what God has done for
[1:09:01] us is beyond any human compar let us
[1:09:05] remember that and worship him every day
[1:09:08] and give him thanks no matter what you
[1:09:10] go through in life remember none of them
[1:09:15] came to pass none of them came to stay
[1:09:18] it will pass it came to pass it will
[1:09:21] come to pass it's never going to stay so
[1:09:25] no matter what you find yourself in
[1:09:27] tonight on the Streamline in here
[1:09:30] remember God what he has done for you
[1:09:33] and he's still doing the same thing he's
[1:09:36] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:09:39] amen praise God
[1:09:41] then um
[1:09:44] verse Philippians I'm still on the
[1:09:47] Philippians
[1:09:51] verse 11
[1:09:54] okay verse 10 but I rejoice in the Lord
[1:09:57] greatly that now at last your care your
[1:10:01] care of me had flourished again wherein
[1:10:04] you were also careful but you la
[1:10:06] opportunity now that I speak in respect
[1:10:09] of one for have learned in whatsoever
[1:10:13] State I am there with to be content I
[1:10:17] know both how to be AB
[1:10:20] based and I know how to abound
[1:10:25] everywhere and in all things I'm
[1:10:27] instructed both to be
[1:10:30] full and to be
[1:10:33] hungry both to abound and both to suffer
[1:10:38] need in other words Paul was trying to
[1:10:41] say that no matter what condition comes
[1:10:45] his way he is not worried he's content
[1:10:50] whatever comes his way he believe God
[1:10:53] will take take care of the situation he
[1:10:55] knows how to be high how to be low he
[1:10:58] has gone through all that because
[1:11:00] remember every life
[1:11:03] experience there's nobody that have his
[1:11:06] life all straight forward all like that
[1:11:08] all the time it's like a stock market
[1:11:11] it's like you go up you go down like
[1:11:14] that that's all life is nobody can have
[1:11:16] it 100% like that we all go through our
[1:11:19] down times you go through our High Times
[1:11:23] you go through are good times there a
[1:11:25] god of the good times and God of the bad
[1:11:28] times every time God is good so when you
[1:11:31] are in the bad times or you good times
[1:11:34] you have to be
[1:11:35] content because God will bring you out
[1:11:38] he will let all things work together for
[1:11:42] good to them that love God that's the
[1:11:45] God that you are you are serving he's a
[1:11:47] living God he's only wise God he's
[1:11:50] Eternal the Prince of Peace Mighty God
[1:11:52] Everlasting father
[1:11:54] before him there is no other God neither
[1:11:57] will there be any other God after him he
[1:11:59] is God that never lose a battle amen so
[1:12:03] whatever situation you find yourself in
[1:12:06] you got to be content you have to be
[1:12:08] happy because God is going to bring you
[1:12:11] out it's it didn't not going to be for
[1:12:14] forever amen praise God hallelujah
[1:12:21] and one more thing
[1:12:24] he said that it said over
[1:12:28] here
[1:12:31] verse verse 13 He said that I can do all
[1:12:38] things through Christ which strengthen
[1:12:41] me that means that it's not by power by
[1:12:46] might but by my spirit says the Lord we
[1:12:51] can do all things through Christ
[1:12:54] yesterday I was telling some girl that I
[1:12:56] met in a place we went to buy something
[1:12:59] and she has a tattoo on her he said that
[1:13:02] she can do all things I said it's good
[1:13:04] that you have that positive thing you
[1:13:06] can do all things is good because you
[1:13:08] you are what you speak of or you become
[1:13:10] what you eat or whatever that positive
[1:13:12] is very good thing but I told her the
[1:13:15] difference between what I believe is
[1:13:17] that in Philippians I can do all things
[1:13:21] through Christ who what strength in
[1:13:23] other words we have come to a
[1:13:26] place and realize it's not by our own
[1:13:30] power it's not by our own might it's not
[1:13:34] how much we have studied it's not how
[1:13:36] much we know it's not how much we have
[1:13:38] done all those things it's all about him
[1:13:42] who strengthen us without God we are
[1:13:44] nothing without him our worship in vain
[1:13:48] without him coming to vindicate
[1:13:50] everything we doing is in vain he is the
[1:13:53] center of our life he's our everything
[1:13:56] him in our life make the difference him
[1:13:59] in your life make the difference when
[1:14:01] Christ coming it takes it makes a
[1:14:04] difference of everything because we are
[1:14:07] nothing without him he can do without us
[1:14:11] we cannot do without him that's why I
[1:14:14] said that God is able to what raise
[1:14:17] souls for Abraham to worship him if you
[1:14:21] try to think that you are too much or
[1:14:22] whatever that you think that you have
[1:14:24] done things then you're going to take
[1:14:26] himself out and tell you do it let me
[1:14:29] see so in everything we do we cannot do
[1:14:33] it without him without him I cannot do
[1:14:36] nothing without him I'll be drifting
[1:14:39] like a ship without a seal but with him
[1:14:43] I can do all things just say to I can do
[1:14:46] all things through Christ who strengthen
[1:14:48] me say say back to
[1:14:52] me
[1:14:53] Str I can do all things through Christ
[1:14:57] who strengthen
[1:15:00] me I can do all things through Christ
[1:15:03] who strengthened
[1:15:07] me amen let's keep that in our heart
[1:15:10] throughout the week and know that no
[1:15:13] matter what situation we are facing we
[1:15:15] can do it through Christ not by might
[1:15:18] not by power but by my spirit says the
[1:15:22] Lord remember it was not Moses who was
[1:15:25] do it was God in Moses it was never
[1:15:28] Samson but it was God in Samson it
[1:15:31] wasn't even brother abrah how can
[1:15:34] he uneducated seven years do all these
[1:15:38] things can know the people can know this
[1:15:40] and all that it wasn't him it was God
[1:15:44] it's Christ he said Willam Braham have
[1:15:46] loan me his body his mouth his mind
[1:15:49] everything and I come to do the things
[1:15:52] it's not not him it's I doing it so is
[1:15:55] you and me if we are so too much
[1:15:58] surrounded and give our mind our soul
[1:16:02] conscious everything the Living God he
[1:16:05] will come in us and do Mighty Works in
[1:16:08] our lives he's the same yesterday today
[1:16:11] and forever all those who became
[1:16:14] prisoner of Christ and gave God their
[1:16:17] conscience gave him their heart gave him
[1:16:20] everything he came in and surrendered
[1:16:22] and live through them and do Mighty
[1:16:25] Works through them he's doing the same
[1:16:27] time he's the same thing the same God
[1:16:31] that was in Moses that was in the
[1:16:33] prophet is in you and in
[1:16:36] me and it it's all up to
[1:16:39] you how you make the step because he
[1:16:44] said that everywhere Jack that your
[1:16:46] footsteps I have given it to you the
[1:16:50] Lord has given everything footsteps
[1:16:53] mean
[1:16:54] possession because God is with you even
[1:16:58] in you until what the consumation of the
[1:17:02] time he's in your heart he's in my heart
[1:17:05] he lives in me he lives in you he's the
[1:17:09] same God by all things work together for
[1:17:15] good to them that love God no matter
[1:17:18] what God is in control amen he is in
[1:17:22] control of my life life how God is so
[1:17:25] great I feel so good I feel the pole
[1:17:29] Hallelujah my God is good my God is
[1:17:32] awesome
[1:17:34] hallelujah amen hallelujah you can do
[1:17:38] all things through Christ who strengthen
[1:17:42] us what am I
[1:17:44] saying when you are in the post of
[1:17:50] Duty when you are doing
[1:17:55] something and you know that your motive
[1:17:59] is right and your objectiv is right just
[1:18:03] go on and do it God will make a way for
[1:18:06] you but he the same God you see when
[1:18:11] Joshua was in the post of
[1:18:14] Duty and he needed
[1:18:16] stand he said stand stand still and
[1:18:20] stand too still Joshua is not better
[1:18:23] than you he's a Son of God like you are
[1:18:27] so what am I trying to say when you are
[1:18:30] in the post of
[1:18:33] Duty you needed something just speak to
[1:18:36] the Rock and go
[1:18:38] forward Moses did it he
[1:18:43] said he lift up his th his rod and the
[1:18:47] rest SE
[1:18:48] departed and he obey him Elijah prayed
[1:18:52] and ly and reain did not came for three
[1:18:56] and a half years he prayed again rain
[1:18:59] came
[1:19:01] Daniel when he and the post of
[1:19:07] Duty in the Lion's then braam said that
[1:19:11] God send that Pillar of Fire around him
[1:19:16] so that the Lions could not get close to
[1:19:18] him and God protected him the Hebrew
[1:19:21] children what happened to them they said
[1:19:25] that our
[1:19:26] God is able to deliver us but even if
[1:19:30] you chose not to we're not going to bow
[1:19:34] down to this thos so it's you and me we
[1:19:39] have confidence we have seen God so much
[1:19:43] and we know he can do so many true thre
[1:19:47] but even if you chose not to we are not
[1:19:49] going to bow down to the devil we are
[1:19:51] not going to bow down to the situation
[1:19:53] you're going to stand in and see the
[1:19:55] salvation of God so I encourage you
[1:19:58] tonight don't give
[1:20:01] up no matter what trust
[1:20:05] God once you are in the post of Duty
[1:20:08] once your motive is right that's why
[1:20:11] you're not going to be stupid like to go
[1:20:13] and take poisons to drink or somebody
[1:20:15] who just went to um Lions then to prove
[1:20:18] that he can we we don't tempt God but if
[1:20:24] you go to some place you pray over the
[1:20:27] food and you eat even there's poison it
[1:20:29] to not poison you because the Bible said
[1:20:32] in my name they shall cast out Devils
[1:20:35] they shall lay their hands on the sick
[1:20:37] they shall recover they will eat poisons
[1:20:40] and what it will not harm
[1:20:43] them so you on the post of Duty you eat
[1:20:48] and go forth because remember it's not
[1:20:51] what goes into your mouth that defil a
[1:20:54] man is what comes out from the
[1:20:59] man yes come from the mouth or the man
[1:21:02] so you don't have to be scared of
[1:21:06] anything you bless the food and you
[1:21:09] go so once you are on the post of
[1:21:15] Duty don't be
[1:21:17] scared it doesn't matter what the
[1:21:20] situation just move forward because
[1:21:22] because God is with you even in you
[1:21:26] until the consumation of the time he'll
[1:21:29] be there for you he will make a way
[1:21:31] where it seems to be no way he's the
[1:21:33] same God you you you tell
[1:21:36] me when Elijah went to that woman's
[1:21:40] house who did not have
[1:21:43] oil every day since Elijah left the oil
[1:21:47] was being filled who was filling that
[1:21:48] oil where did he get that oil from you
[1:21:51] tell me
[1:21:55] how the Ravens able to get food and feed
[1:22:02] him you can't explain so many
[1:22:05] things but God did
[1:22:08] it how did those face
[1:22:12] multiply how did this how did all those
[1:22:15] things
[1:22:16] happen our God is a living
[1:22:20] God and God is marching on so God can do
[1:22:25] all
[1:22:27] things sometime you look to ourself too
[1:22:31] much we look to our own
[1:22:35] abilities what I can do but if you can
[1:22:38] get to that place that we take our own
[1:22:42] self out our own abilities out what we
[1:22:47] can do out and concentrate and Believe
[1:22:51] on what God can can do Miracles so many
[1:22:55] things will happen in our lives one time
[1:22:59] I remember I came to
[1:23:00] service and Pastor preach on one
[1:23:05] Wednesday I was so carried in the spirit
[1:23:08] so blessed I can't explain it I went
[1:23:10] downstairs Johnson told me he has a
[1:23:13] problem with his leg I put my hands I
[1:23:15] prayed he she came and gave a testimony
[1:23:19] that the pain everything just left I
[1:23:22] went the following day I went to meet a
[1:23:24] client a
[1:23:25] builder and he's a denomination guy we
[1:23:29] spoke and the spirit of the Living God
[1:23:31] anointing filled the whole place and and
[1:23:34] that
[1:23:36] inspiration I went to square one then I
[1:23:41] saw a lady the
[1:23:43] escalator that time they put a stop on
[1:23:47] it a lady was sitting there she said she
[1:23:49] can't walk and they calling ambulance
[1:23:52] they security commotion was going on
[1:23:54] there there was one brother that goes to
[1:23:56] BR Michael as he was there didn't then
[1:23:59] he took the woman's H purse then I asked
[1:24:04] her do you believe in God she said yes
[1:24:07] do you believe God can heal you she said
[1:24:09] yes and we prayed and with a plate of
[1:24:13] second one two she just woke up and
[1:24:18] didn't need ambulance who did that the
[1:24:20] same God is here tonight
[1:24:22] so whatever you have need of just get
[1:24:25] into his presence remember that the
[1:24:28] letter kill it but the spirit giveth
[1:24:31] life we need both the mechanics and the
[1:24:34] Dynamics the scriptures when the spirit
[1:24:37] of truth comes he he will lead you to
[1:24:40] all truth and show you things to come so
[1:24:45] we need both the word and the spirit but
[1:24:50] the Pentecostals have just spr spr spr
[1:24:53] spr Spirit and the message people have
[1:24:55] beening the word word word word but it's
[1:24:58] the spirit that quickens so you need
[1:25:00] both both mechanics and Dynamics and
[1:25:04] move on because without the Dynamics it
[1:25:09] will not work but when the spirit
[1:25:11] quickened that letter becames
[1:25:15] life it gives
[1:25:18] life the life comes out of it because
[1:25:21] remember you need the revelation of the
[1:25:25] word not just the
[1:25:27] letter the revealed
[1:25:30] world that's what the devil cannot fight
[1:25:33] against it when that word is become
[1:25:37] revealed in your heart and then you put
[1:25:40] it to PL because remember the evidence
[1:25:42] of the Holy Ghost is to be able to
[1:25:45] ability to receive the word for your day
[1:25:47] and what go leave
[1:25:50] it so it's not just the mechanics it's
[1:25:54] not just the knowledge it's not just
[1:25:57] recognizing it it's
[1:26:00] acting living on what you are because I
[1:26:02] us tell people I was telling somebody
[1:26:04] last week it's not how much you know of
[1:26:09] the letter that's
[1:26:10] important but even if one word that has
[1:26:14] been revealed to you and you able to
[1:26:16] leave it that's most important thing
[1:26:19] because he who that knows much much is
[1:26:22] required of him so whatever that you
[1:26:25] know God expects you to leave what you
[1:26:31] have
[1:26:33] received so it's not the accumulation of
[1:26:37] all the
[1:26:39] knowledge but just the PA that has been
[1:26:43] revealed to you you're going to give
[1:26:45] account to
[1:26:47] it and the whole thing is it comes back
[1:26:51] to the grace of god let's stand for him
[1:26:55] and he will stand for us just like after
[1:26:58] m
[1:27:00] one the
[1:27:01] Evangelist that went into the presence
[1:27:04] of God one right time and then they
[1:27:06] asked him after my did you ever steal
[1:27:11] was on Earth he said in the presence on
[1:27:15] Earth I thought I never steal but the
[1:27:18] presence of that light little things
[1:27:21] that I do it magnified did you lie he
[1:27:25] thought I never lied but in the presence
[1:27:28] of that it all shows up and then he said
[1:27:32] oh I'm a v i leave Millions then I'll
[1:27:36] I'll I I try my case in the white Throne
[1:27:38] of judgment if I have no choice then he
[1:27:41] said he heard the sweetest voice the
[1:27:44] sweetest name he said father he stood
[1:27:47] for me on Earth I'm also standing for
[1:27:51] him
[1:27:52] so let's stand for Christ let's stand
[1:27:55] for him he will stand for us it's not
[1:27:59] the law so how much you obey the Lord
[1:28:01] not how
[1:28:02] much but God is looking to Your Heart
[1:28:06] The Desires in your heart what you want
[1:28:09] to do what's hiding
[1:28:12] there what you are
[1:28:14] Desiring he know we make
[1:28:18] mistakes he knows this flesh
[1:28:22] can never be perfect but he's looking
[1:28:25] into your heart he's looking to your
[1:28:27] stand for him that's why the Bible said
[1:28:29] that even said if your heart condemns
[1:28:33] you God is greater than your heart and
[1:28:37] if your heart condemns you not whatever
[1:28:40] you ask God he'll Grant it to you once
[1:28:44] there's a comination you can't go back
[1:28:45] even if your heart condemns you God is
[1:28:49] greater than your heart and it goes say
[1:28:52] said that the seed of God cannot
[1:28:55] sin because what he has the seed of God
[1:28:59] in him a child of God cannot because he
[1:29:02] has what the seed of God in him so you
[1:29:05] cannot s and some David said that
[1:29:08] blessed is the man whom I will not
[1:29:10] impute sin whose iniquity is Forgiven if
[1:29:15] you read that Isaiah chapter uh 5 said
[1:29:19] he was wounded for what your
[1:29:21] transgression in transgressing the law
[1:29:23] he knows you cannot obey the law you
[1:29:25] cannot follow the law but all that he
[1:29:28] wants is that let's give him the heart
[1:29:29] Let Him Live his life through US BEC
[1:29:32] simple don't want to walk with any guilt
[1:29:35] around you because he died on Calvary
[1:29:38] your sins were put in God's sea of
[1:29:40] forgetful you have
[1:29:42] Justified as if you have never even done
[1:29:46] it that's how Grace God has given it to
[1:29:50] us so let's work with
[1:29:54] confidence relying on God's
[1:29:58] ability not your own works of
[1:30:00] righteousness by his works of
[1:30:02] righteousness there's no one perfect but
[1:30:06] the perfect God lives in you that makes
[1:30:09] you
[1:30:10] perfect because he alone is perfect when
[1:30:13] the cry went out who is worthy to take
[1:30:18] the seals and break it off there was no
[1:30:20] one Worthy holy Christ the Lamb of God
