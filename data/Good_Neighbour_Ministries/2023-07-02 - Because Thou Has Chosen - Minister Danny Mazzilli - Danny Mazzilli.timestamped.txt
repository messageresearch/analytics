[39:55] his grace just keeps coming over and
[39:57] over and over again and there's nothing

[41:43] familiar scripture

[41:49] title is because thou has chosen
[41:52] and you can you know there's going to be
[41:54] a compound meaning behind that title
[41:57] because God has chosen you
[42:01] and God knew that you would choose him
[42:04] and so there's there's a wonderful Union
[42:08] that takes place when we come into that
[42:11] realization that the day star has shined

[44:16] of Moses the servant of the Lord it came
[44:20] to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua
[44:22] the son of none Moses Minister saying
[44:26] Moses my servant is dead
[44:30] now we need to understand that
[44:33] we need to know that God sent us a Moses
[44:35] but that Moses that God sent us William
[44:38] Mary and Branham he is no longer with us
[44:41] he is no longer here on Earth we are
[44:45] under a different commission just like
[44:47] God said Moses is dead now therefore
[44:50] arise
[44:51] he said you need to rise up and
[44:53] recognize who you are you need to
[44:56] recognize your part you need to
[44:58] recognize that that there's things that
[45:00] I'm going to promise to you and if you
[45:02] can accept those promises and believe
[45:04] those promises then you can be
[45:06] victorious amen listen what he says now
[45:09] therefore arise go over this Jordan thou
[45:12] and all this people unto the land which
[45:15] I do give to them even to the children
[45:19] of Israel listen what he says every
[45:22] place that the soul of your foot shall
[45:25] tread upon that have I given unto you as
[45:30] I said unto Moses from the Wilderness
[45:32] and this Lebanon even unto the Great
[45:35] River the river Euphrates all the land
[45:39] the Hittites and unto the great sea
[45:42] towards the going down of the sun shall
[45:45] be your Coast there shall listen there
[45:49] shall not any man be able able to stand
[45:52] before thee all the days of thy life
[45:57] Hallelujah
[45:59] he's still the same God and as I was
[46:03] with Moses as I was with William Branham
[46:06] as I was in this land here in the 20th
[46:10] century moving and revealing and making
[46:13] myself known he says so I will be with
[46:17] thee
[46:19] I will not fail thee nor forsake thee
[46:24] but listen he says be strong
[46:27] Hallelujah he says be of good courage
[46:31] For unto this people shall thou divide
[46:33] for an inheritance the land which I
[46:36] swear unto their fathers to give them
[46:38] only be thou and only be thou strong and
[46:44] very courageous he's he he says be
[46:47] courageous then he says be very
[46:49] courageous oh my very For unto this
[46:53] people shall thou divide only be thou
[46:56] very courageous that thou mayest observe
[46:59] to do according to all the law which
[47:03] Moses my servant commanded thee turn not
[47:06] from it to the right hand or to the left
[47:10] that thou mayest prosper
[47:13] Hallelujah what's withersoever thou
[47:16] goeth this book of the law shall not
[47:19] depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt
[47:22] meditate therein day and night and thou
[47:25] that thou mayest observe to do according
[47:29] to all that is written therein for then
[47:32] Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and
[47:36] then Thou shalt have good success
[47:40] amen the Lord add His blessings to the
[47:42] word of God glory to God you may be
[47:45] seated
[47:47] amen bless the name of the Lord you know
[47:50] um we need to also read a scripture here
[47:53] from Revelations chapter 3 verses 21 to
[47:56] 22. to him that overcometh will I grant
[48:00] to sit with me in my throne
[48:03] even as I also overcame and am set down
[48:07] with my father in his throne he that
[48:10] hath an ear let him hear what the spirit
[48:13] saith unto the churches
[48:16] now we need to realize here that you
[48:19] know we we receive very clear
[48:21] instruction
[48:22] that we were to be courageous to be
[48:26] strong to recognize that the Lord God
[48:28] was with us that if we would not turn to
[48:32] the left or turn to the right or look to
[48:34] anything else that the Lord would
[48:36] provide for us
[48:38] you know brother Branham was here on
[48:40] this Earth and he he had the ministry of
[48:43] Malachi 4 5. he had the ministry of
[48:46] Revelations 10 7. he had the ministry to
[48:49] come and to deliver the word of God he
[48:52] he was the anointed word in his day he
[48:55] was the manifestation of God in his day
[48:58] but let me tell you it was not easy for
[49:01] him
[49:03] he had to meet challenges that you and I
[49:06] would would couldn't even imagine having
[49:09] to deal with death of his loved ones his
[49:11] child his wife all the things that he
[49:14] had to go through but yet there was
[49:16] something in him
[49:19] something was placed in him from before
[49:21] the foundations of the world and I say
[49:24] to you this morning there's something in
[49:26] you
[49:27] as a son or a daughter of God I don't
[49:30] care how old you are I don't care how
[49:33] young you are this has got nothing to do
[49:35] with your age this has nothing to do
[49:38] with your ability this has nothing to do
[49:41] with your upbringing oh all your all
[49:44] your generational upbringing and all
[49:47] your atmospheres that you grew up under
[49:49] it has nothing to do with that this has
[49:51] to do with one thing
[49:53] God's election
[49:56] God's purpose
[49:58] God's desire to express himself in the
[50:02] form of attributes God wanted to express
[50:06] listen to Listen to The Prophet here
[50:09] he says here in the in the ministry
[50:12] um identification
[50:14] in the beginning was God he wasn't even
[50:17] God then
[50:19] God is just an object of worship
[50:22] he wasn't even God then no God is an
[50:25] object of worship only thing he was was
[50:29] the Eternal and in him was attributes
[50:33] and those attributes were thoughts
[50:37] simplify this we want to keep this
[50:39] really simple today we're not bringing
[50:40] some mysterious message here today
[50:43] that's going to leave you thinking and
[50:45] wondering no no you're going to
[50:46] recognize when you listen to this
[50:48] message today I want you to just sit
[50:51] back and relax
[50:52] let the Holy Spirit fellowship with us
[50:54] here today
[50:56] that's what I was doing I was having
[50:57] fellowship with the Holy Ghost as I was
[50:59] going through all of this and it was
[51:01] wonderful he was just unveiling such
[51:04] simple truths but it brought such
[51:06] confidence such a encouragement through
[51:10] the word of God and and it's available
[51:12] to you this morning so relax just relax
[51:14] enjoy this atmosphere because we've got
[51:17] him with us here this morning and he
[51:19] says and those attributes were thoughts
[51:22] and those thoughts was expressed to
[51:25] words and word was made manifest
[51:29] so what is it it's all God
[51:32] becoming tangible you are a part of God
[51:38] and Jesus come to redeem those that was
[51:42] put on the Lamb's Book of Life before
[51:45] the foundations of the world
[51:47] you need to realize that there's a book
[51:50] of life everything started not when you
[51:53] were born here and it didn't even start
[51:55] back in the Book of Genesis when Adam
[51:58] was manifested into the Earth and made
[52:00] into the image of God it all started
[52:03] before all of that
[52:05] God had a plan all before that you know
[52:08] people talk about you know the world is
[52:10] millions of years old it it sure it is
[52:13] there's no beginning and no end with God
[52:16] God could have started programs and had
[52:18] generations and worlds before this one
[52:21] but we're concerned about this one
[52:23] is this the one that you're in
[52:25] this the one that you were born into
[52:27] this is your time this is your season to
[52:30] manifest what it is that you are who you
[52:33] are this is that's why you need to be
[52:35] concerned about that don't get caught up
[52:37] into Evolution that's not going to do
[52:39] you any good
[52:40] Hallelujah you need to know who you are
[52:42] you need to recognize that that you have
[52:44] a part to play in this time this
[52:47] generation this part of his story his
[52:50] story his story is being made right now
[52:53] in your life
[52:55] because of your part in the word of God
[52:58] and he says here he came to redeem those
[53:00] that was put
[53:02] on the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[53:04] founding it was in God's thoughts
[53:07] and that's what he come to redeem
[53:12] and them as soon as it strikes to them
[53:15] they see it because the life is in there
[53:19] you're not going to know why it is that
[53:22] this just makes sense to you I cannot
[53:25] explain revelation
[53:27] Revelation is something that you can
[53:30] never explain you cannot give it to
[53:32] somebody all you can do is put a
[53:35] definition on it and the closest
[53:36] definition that I can give according to
[53:39] the way that I see it is that God's
[53:41] thoughts
[53:43] become real in my thoughts
[53:47] and they manifest
[53:49] in the way of divine revelation in my
[53:53] heart
[53:54] I can't explain it but I believe it
[53:57] that's why Jesus said I'll build my
[54:00] church that way so you young people
[54:02] you're wondering how it is that you're
[54:04] gonna you're you're gonna overcome how
[54:07] it is that you're gonna deal with this
[54:08] life and and the situations that you're
[54:11] facing right now as a young person I'm
[54:13] going to tell you something
[54:15] God is going to do it
[54:19] the Lord is going to give you Revelation
[54:21] and at that moment in that time and that
[54:24] season when it's time for you to receive
[54:27] it you're going to receive it and you're
[54:29] just gonna know it
[54:30] you're gonna know who you are you're
[54:32] going to understand why all the things
[54:34] that have been happening in your life
[54:36] are happening Hallelujah but if the
[54:39] light now he says because the life is in
[54:41] there now watch this is what he says but
[54:44] if the life is INT in there is not in
[54:49] there
[54:51] hey we're living in a world
[54:54] there's a lot other church services
[54:56] going on right now this morning all over
[54:58] the world
[55:00] there's people that are believing God
[55:02] all over the world
[55:05] but there's something that we need to
[55:07] understand
[55:09] this is what separates us
[55:12] and and and and gives us the difference
[55:17] we know the attributes of God are being
[55:22] expressed in this time and season
[55:25] we realize that God is his own
[55:27] interpreter God opens the understanding
[55:30] not man
[55:32] I could never open your understanding no
[55:34] Minister could ever open your
[55:35] understanding God opens your
[55:38] understanding by divine revelation and
[55:41] the reason you can say Amen is because
[55:43] there's a representation there from
[55:46] before the foundations of the world
[55:48] halleluia glory to God but if it isn't
[55:51] there then what can they do see they
[55:55] don't see it they never see it see
[56:00] but listen and the whole and the whole
[56:02] thing as Jesus said at that day you'll
[56:06] know that I am in the Father the father
[56:09] in me and I in you and you in me the
[56:13] whole thing is God becoming material
[56:17] like a husband and a wife becoming one
[56:21] together God and his church becoming one
[56:27] Alleluia praise our God forevermore
[56:30] but
[56:32] brother Branham went through a tough
[56:33] time
[56:35] he had to make choices
[56:37] I'm going to read you a quote and this
[56:39] is where the thought came from and
[56:41] there's no way that we're going to be
[56:42] able to get through this this is going
[56:43] to be a couple of parts for sure okay
[56:45] but this is the the the thought that
[56:49] became strong in my heart
[56:52] and when I read this quote when brother
[56:55] Branham you know gave the testimony of
[56:58] the of the the the three individuals
[57:00] that spoke in tongues and the
[57:02] interpretation of it this is what it
[57:04] read on the wings of a snow white dove
[57:06] 1965. he says and this three people
[57:09] three French people a French woman big
[57:12] heavyset woman dark complected from
[57:15] Louisiana she may be sitting here
[57:17] tonight wrote it down on a piece of
[57:20] paper what he said then Victor Ledoux a
[57:23] minister wrote down the same thing and
[57:26] they were comparing notes or going to a
[57:30] lightheaded man kind of a blonde hair
[57:32] standing way back packed back as far as
[57:35] he could come walking up wanted to see
[57:38] those notes he was The Interpreter of
[57:42] French at the U.N and all three notes
[57:45] was the same it was God sending a
[57:49] message it was God sending something to
[57:52] his Prophet to encourage him amen praise
[57:56] God and and he said and all three notes
[57:59] was the same and it said this
[58:00] because thou has chosen this harder way
[58:06] you've chosen
[58:10] you've chose it you have took chose it
[58:14] by your own choosing
[58:18] course we know that Moses had to make
[58:22] his choice said this is the precise and
[58:26] correct way because it is my way
[58:29] my God thank you Jesus glory to God once
[58:34] you understand God's way his way you're
[58:37] you're you're going to be set free
[58:39] Saints you're going to be set free and
[58:41] what and what a what a glorious listen
[58:43] what he says what a glorious decision
[58:46] you've made said because of this a large
[58:49] portion of Heaven awaits you
[58:52] and this in itself is that which will
[58:56] make and bring to pass the tremendous
[59:00] victory in the love divine
[59:03] I believe there's going to be a meeting
[59:05] in the air in the sweet sweet by and by
[59:08] oh it'll bring such a glorious Liberty
[59:11] to the sons of God it'll be such a love
[59:14] divine Saints we will be in Heavenly
[59:17] places we will get caught up in the
[59:19] moment in the twinkling of an eye
[59:20] because God said so because God said
[59:23] that he promised that it would be so
[59:25] that because because thou has chosen
[59:29] Alleluia glory to God Amen blessed be
[59:32] the name of the Lord so here now we're
[59:34] going to look at
[59:37] partnering with God
[59:39] you know God chose you you chose him you
[59:42] know in the world I'm a businessman I
[59:45] chose my partners and they chose to be
[59:48] with me there's a there's a there's a a
[59:51] connection where both sides have to
[59:53] agree
[59:54] the moment god listen you think God's
[59:56] going to choose you and you're going to
[59:58] turn around and reject him
[1:00:01] God chose you by election he knew that
[1:00:04] you would accept
[1:00:05] he knew that there was an attribute in
[1:00:08] you not because I'll choose this one and
[1:00:10] I won't choose that one no no he placed
[1:00:12] you here on free moral agency you are a
[1:00:16] free human being in here this morning
[1:00:17] when you're hearing this message this
[1:00:19] morning you've got the choice to accept
[1:00:21] it or reject it
[1:00:23] you'll either leave better or you're
[1:00:25] going to leave in a battle
[1:00:27] it's as simple as that because this is
[1:00:29] the hour where God is calling God is
[1:00:32] placing God is anointing God is
[1:00:35] manifesting God is interpreting his word
[1:00:38] we don't need to try to interpret his
[1:00:40] word he's going to do it all by himself
[1:00:42] we can relax we can sit back and let the
[1:00:45] Holy Spirit have his way amen praise God
[1:00:48] but it's going to take us to have that
[1:00:51] that connection where we agree where we
[1:00:54] say Amen where we say yes Lord
[1:00:57] hallelujah glory to God you know in
[1:01:00] Daniel 11 32 it says in the King James
[1:01:03] version it says the people who know
[1:01:06] their God shall be strong
[1:01:09] and shall carry out great exploits
[1:01:13] you can expect Supernatural things to
[1:01:15] happen in your life
[1:01:17] you can expect Deliverance you can
[1:01:20] expect Financial blessings you can

[1:04:42] partnered with God and when situations
[1:04:44] come up in your life that it's going to
[1:04:47] take all like you might be facing
[1:04:49] situations right now and you know
[1:04:50] there's just
[1:04:53] no matter where you look Left Right
[1:04:55] Center you can't find a solution
[1:04:59] Joshua had all kinds of situations like
[1:05:01] that
[1:05:02] but God was with Joshua
[1:05:06] you see that's the kind of Revelation
[1:05:08] you need to have you need to know that
[1:05:10] you're with the Living God and he's with
[1:05:13] you he desires to partnership with you
[1:05:16] and can you imagine what can happen now
[1:05:18] I'm telling you things will happen I've
[1:05:21] experienced it Saints I've seen things
[1:05:24] happen in my life I could sit here and
[1:05:26] give you testimony after testimony after
[1:05:28] testimony of the things that God did
[1:05:31] that I cannot mentally physically
[1:05:34] explain
[1:05:37] he did it that's all I can tell you he
[1:05:40] did it and I know there's a lot of
[1:05:42] people in here that can say the same
[1:05:43] thing
[1:05:44] because we serve a supernatural God
[1:05:47] that's why after 30 years some of you 35
[1:05:50] years some of you whatever time you're
[1:05:53] here because you know you've come into
[1:05:55] contact with the Living God
[1:05:57] Hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:06:00] Lord hallelujah God does nothing listen
[1:06:04] God chose you why because God can't do
[1:06:07] it any other way
[1:06:09] God has attributes but he placed those
[1:06:11] attributes in man
[1:06:13] listen to brother Brown I'm here
[1:06:15] at the identified Christ of all ages
[1:06:19] 1964. he says so therefore he could tell
[1:06:23] the end from the beginning
[1:06:25] and in each age he lauded so much of his
[1:06:29] word
[1:06:30] Hallelujah in each age and then usually
[1:06:34] man gets it so twisted up and the world
[1:06:37] gets in such a shape until he has to
[1:06:41] send some man anointed all ages has been
[1:06:45] the same he identifies himself upon the
[1:06:49] Earth in man
[1:06:51] [Music]
[1:06:52] in man so don't be looking anywhere else
[1:06:56] you know sometimes you can get so
[1:06:57] spiritually minded that you're no
[1:06:59] earthly good
[1:07:03] your pastor and those ministers that
[1:07:05] stand here are ministering instruction
[1:07:08] by the by the anointing and by the by by
[1:07:10] the supernatural inspiration of the Holy
[1:07:13] Ghost and if you can accept it and say
[1:07:15] amen I receive that
[1:07:18] it becomes a part of you
[1:07:21] and sometimes we we just don't you know
[1:07:23] we look at man
[1:07:25] you might look at brother Danny you
[1:07:27] might see some of my flaws I got lots of
[1:07:29] them
[1:07:30] okay and I see a lot of yours
[1:07:33] we all got them
[1:07:35] but before we were flawed humans we were
[1:07:38] Sons and Daughters of the Living God
[1:07:41] and I'm looking at that I'm not looking
[1:07:44] at you anymore I'm not looking at your
[1:07:46] flaws I'm not interested in your flaws
[1:07:48] I'm interested in God's program God
[1:07:51] wants to take this church he wants to
[1:07:53] change this this body ain't going in the
[1:07:55] rapture so don't get used to looking at
[1:07:58] this ugly body this bald head over here
[1:08:00] okay
[1:08:01] when you see me on the other side you're
[1:08:03] going to see something completely
[1:08:04] different when I see you on the other
[1:08:07] side you're going to be something that
[1:08:09] eyes have not seen ears have not heard
[1:08:11] neither has it even entered into the
[1:08:13] heart of man what God has in store
[1:08:17] oh my goodness glory to God I'm not
[1:08:20] going to see that that old you know
[1:08:23] weary body I'm not going to feel the old
[1:08:25] weary Pains of this body anymore
[1:08:28] we're going to be changed in a moment
[1:08:30] glory to God Amen he says God does
[1:08:33] nothing without man
[1:08:36] the Bible said so you you know see he
[1:08:39] always takes man because it was man he
[1:08:43] had to use and let the man put him on
[1:08:47] free moral agency here it is
[1:08:50] he put us on free moral agency God is
[1:08:53] not you know creating clones God isn't
[1:08:56] programming you a certain way and
[1:08:58] programming him another way and
[1:09:00] programming her in a certain way no no
[1:09:02] God puts you on free moral agency
[1:09:06] Hallelujah and knowing that he would
[1:09:10] fall
[1:09:11] oh my goodness
[1:09:13] how many times did you fall this week
[1:09:15] how many fell this week
[1:09:19] oh yeah oh yeah you're gonna fall you're
[1:09:22] gonna you're gonna make mistakes
[1:09:24] you're gonna do all those things but
[1:09:25] guess what he's not looking at that
[1:09:28] hallelujah it's it he said that he knew
[1:09:32] that you would fall in order to display
[1:09:33] his attributes as a savior
[1:09:37] how can he be a savior if there's
[1:09:39] nothing to save
[1:09:40] how can he be a Healer if you don't get
[1:09:42] that backache and you lay hands you say
[1:09:45] honey can you please lay your hands on
[1:09:47] my back I've done it many times
[1:09:49] I said lay hands on me
[1:09:51] and I walk out of the room and I forget
[1:09:54] about it
[1:09:55] because I believe the word I got things
[1:09:58] I got to do I can't stand I can't be
[1:10:01] held back because Satan wants to throw
[1:10:03] something on me wants to mess up my back
[1:10:06] wants to mess up this mess up that God
[1:10:08] has a an antidote for that
[1:10:12] you believe that
[1:10:13] you either Believe it or you don't
[1:10:15] believe it if you believe it I don't
[1:10:17] care what the sickness is I don't care
[1:10:18] what where the healing is required you
[1:10:21] just accept it because you got you got
[1:10:22] work to do
[1:10:24] you got a part in God's word you got a
[1:10:26] part in the economy of God nothing can
[1:10:29] keep you down because God's got a job
[1:10:31] for you to do
[1:10:33] hallelujah praise God he says in order
[1:10:36] to display his attributes as a savior
[1:10:38] for there was nothing lost and therefore
[1:10:41] therefore he chose man he could have
[1:10:44] chosen the Stars
[1:10:45] he could have chosen the trees but he
[1:10:49] chose man
[1:10:51] he chose you and he chose me
[1:10:54] Hallelujah because he's got a work to do
[1:10:57] and so
[1:11:00] you know we look into this we realize
[1:11:03] God has chosen us but we need to look
[1:11:05] deeper into it
[1:11:07] I you know when I started to look deeper
[1:11:09] into this I was getting so encouraged
[1:11:11] because God you know like when he wants
[1:11:14] to reveal how he chose you and why he
[1:11:18] chose you and how and how that his
[1:11:21] choosing there was no not even an
[1:11:24] inkling of a mistake there
[1:11:26] Hallelujah in Romans 9 listen I want you
[1:11:29] to recognize here in Romans 9 11 for the
[1:11:32] children being not yet born neither
[1:11:35] having done any good or evil
[1:11:38] that the purpose of God according to
[1:11:42] election might stand
[1:11:44] not of works
[1:11:46] but of him that calleth
[1:11:49] he's calling you this morning Saints
[1:11:52] he's calling you to a walk with him that
[1:11:55] overrides where you've been
[1:11:57] overrides the circumstances that have
[1:11:59] held you overrides any change of
[1:12:02] circumstance they're going to get broken
[1:12:04] here this morning because we're moving
[1:12:05] on Hallelujah you're not going to stay
[1:12:07] the same this is God's choosing amen
[1:12:10] hallelujah you know when when like you
[1:12:13] when we look at this scripture here we
[1:12:15] know that it's talking about uh
[1:12:18] Jacob and Esau you know Jacob and Esau
[1:12:21] when you think about that whole
[1:12:23] story and how it took place and
[1:12:26] everything that that happened you you
[1:12:28] can't help but see the the power of God
[1:12:31] first of all you need to recognize God
[1:12:34] said before while they were in the womb
[1:12:37] Rebecca was wondering
[1:12:40] why are these two fighting in my womb
[1:12:43] why why is there a battle going on and
[1:12:46] when the Lord said one I love the other
[1:12:48] one I hate
[1:12:49] can you imagine before they were even
[1:12:51] born God knew it
[1:12:53] God knew that they would be what they
[1:12:55] were going to be and God knew that Jacob
[1:12:57] regardless of his condition regardless
[1:13:00] of the way he was Hallelujah here let me
[1:13:03] read a few things here
[1:13:06] glory to God
[1:13:08] now listen
[1:13:11] uh
[1:13:13] here I'm just going to read this because
[1:13:15] it's just information that I that I got
[1:13:17] when Rebecca felt that prenatal
[1:13:20] disturbance she asked God what was
[1:13:22] happening
[1:13:23] she she told she God told her that there
[1:13:26] was two Nations struggling inside of her
[1:13:30] you know you're going to have struggles
[1:13:32] you can even have struggles with your
[1:13:33] brothers and sisters
[1:13:36] you're gonna have struggles you're gonna
[1:13:38] you're gonna deal with situations right
[1:13:39] in your own family your own children
[1:13:41] your brothers and your sisters your mama
[1:13:44] your papa your your boss at work there's
[1:13:46] going to be struggles constantly in your
[1:13:48] life
[1:13:49] but I want you to see something this
[1:13:51] there's something that goes beyond that
[1:13:53] there's something that overrides it it
[1:13:56] sets it into the sea of God's
[1:13:58] forgetfulness it'll have no power
[1:14:00] anymore over you but there was two
[1:14:03] Nations struggling inside of her and the
[1:14:05] younger would rule over the older God
[1:14:07] foreknowledge observed Esau's uh you
[1:14:10] know uh disdain for his Birthright and
[1:14:13] predetermined it for Jacob the man of
[1:14:16] faith
[1:14:17] Hallelujah God knew that Esau was gonna
[1:14:19] was gonna sell out
[1:14:21] God knows if you're going to sell out
[1:14:24] did you know that
[1:14:26] because you're here on free moral agency
[1:14:28] you might be going through a battle and
[1:14:30] you know if you're a human like me yeah
[1:14:33] those thoughts have come give up
[1:14:36] leave this
[1:14:39] They Don't Love You
[1:14:42] nobody loves you
[1:14:45] I might as well just be with strangers
[1:14:49] when I'm around my family I feel strange
[1:14:51] I feel I feel alienated all those
[1:14:54] thoughts that's Satan lying to you
[1:14:57] that's Satan lying to you and telling
[1:15:00] you that because Satan wants to pull you
[1:15:02] aside like a lamb when when when a lamb
[1:15:05] gets off on its own somewhere those
[1:15:07] wolves are watching they're waiting so
[1:15:10] that they can pounce and and take a hold
[1:15:12] of that lamb because it's gone off it's
[1:15:14] alienated itself don't you do that you
[1:15:18] stay under the protection of the spirit
[1:15:20] of God God has placed you into this
[1:15:22] ministry I I say it all the time you
[1:15:25] know the people that are having problems
[1:15:27] and I say where's your absolute
[1:15:29] where do you feed on your absolute where
[1:15:32] do you get strength from
[1:15:34] some people it's in it's in positive
[1:15:37] mental attitude it's in you know in in
[1:15:39] Reading you know motivational books
[1:15:41] things like that that's all fine
[1:15:44] but for you as an attribute and a son of
[1:15:46] God there's only one thing that's going
[1:15:48] to satisfy you that's the word of God
[1:15:51] because it's the word that God said
[1:15:54] would overcome
[1:15:55] it's the word that's going to prevail
[1:15:58] and if the word is in you you Prevail
[1:16:00] it's as simple as that and amen so so
[1:16:03] here now when Esau maturity became an
[1:16:06] outdoor he became a hunter and one day
[1:16:08] he returns home he's all famished he you
[1:16:12] know he's been hunting all day and he's
[1:16:14] hungry
[1:16:15] you know sometimes we just give up you
[1:16:19] know so easy because you know we get
[1:16:21] faced with a little bit of a trial and I
[1:16:23] don't want this trial I'm not going to
[1:16:25] go to church
[1:16:26] I don't want to go to church this person
[1:16:29] didn't say hi to me last week
[1:16:31] this person looked at me the wrong way
[1:16:33] I'm not going to church they don't like
[1:16:36] me the pastor when he was preaching he
[1:16:38] was talking all about me
[1:16:43] that's good
[1:16:44] if the spirit of God is interested in
[1:16:47] you that's good
[1:16:48] and if it's correction that's good if
[1:16:51] God wants to deliver you from certain
[1:16:53] things that's good because God has a
[1:16:55] purpose in calling you Hallelujah and
[1:16:58] you know and so no doubt God had
[1:17:01] orchestrated Esau's vain attempts just
[1:17:04] to test his character God was take God
[1:17:07] was was going to show what was really an
[1:17:09] Esau
[1:17:10] you know God's going to test you and see
[1:17:12] and you're going to see what's really in
[1:17:14] you
[1:17:14] you're going to get tested sometimes to
[1:17:17] see what's really there are you really
[1:17:18] going to stand are you going to really
[1:17:21] stand are you going to put aside
[1:17:23] everybody's opinions and everybody's
[1:17:25] thoughts and Satan's thoughts about you
[1:17:28] and be still and know that he's God
[1:17:31] You Don't Have To Fear
[1:17:33] not if you believe God hallelujah but
[1:17:36] here now Jacob he was smart he wanted
[1:17:39] that Birthright he would do anything to
[1:17:42] get that birth right he was a conniver
[1:17:44] God is just showing the characters God
[1:17:47] is showing the human side of us as human
[1:17:50] beings that we can be flawed we can make
[1:17:53] mistakes we can do things that we don't
[1:17:56] want to do that we can we can be
[1:17:58] connivers at times too that because
[1:18:00] Satan will try and do anything to get
[1:18:02] you to to just get off the word and and
[1:18:05] to separate yourself from God but here
[1:18:08] now he he Esau comes in he smells that
[1:18:11] food and he was starving and and and
[1:18:13] Jacob says you want some of this he says
[1:18:16] give me your Birthright and Esau turns
[1:18:18] around and showed his real character
[1:18:20] when he says what good is this is a
[1:18:23] Birthright when I'm gonna die from
[1:18:25] starvation how many people do you know
[1:18:27] die if they don't eat for one day
[1:18:31] not many you don't die from missing a
[1:18:34] meal one day
[1:18:36] but he sold out for a meal
[1:18:41] what's in you
[1:18:42] how quickly are you bruised and right
[1:18:45] away you just give up
[1:18:47] God's not looking for that
[1:18:49] God wants you to know I'll be with you
[1:18:53] I'll be in you
[1:18:55] I chose you Hallelujah glory to God it
[1:18:59] showed his true colors Satan attempted
[1:19:03] him pushed him but Jacob showed his true
[1:19:06] colors Jacob wasn't willing to give up
[1:19:08] he went and fought with the angel of the
[1:19:10] Lord he says I don't care what it's
[1:19:12] going to take I know I make mistakes I
[1:19:15] know I fall but I'm getting back up
[1:19:17] again
[1:19:17] that's the kind of attitude God is
[1:19:20] looking in his sons and daughters he's
[1:19:22] not looking at a giver rapper
[1:19:24] you should not be a giver upper because
[1:19:26] God is with you
[1:19:29] you're going to be we're going to be
[1:19:30] looking at things here that that you're
[1:19:32] going to realize that God chose you amen
[1:19:34] hallelujah listen uh
[1:19:38] God's proof of his love
[1:19:41] and his election
[1:19:43] is in that he elected you

[1:19:48] he didn't love you
[1:19:51] do you think God doesn't love you and
[1:19:54] yet he elects you
[1:19:56] no no no they go they go hand in hand
[1:19:59] before you were lost in sin God loved

[1:20:13] of that situation he wants you to know
[1:20:15] that if if that love comes upon you and
[1:20:19] you'll know you'll know when God loves
[1:20:21] you you'll know when he expresses it
[1:20:23] upon you when he when he fills you with
[1:20:26] his Spirit when he anoints you when he
[1:20:28] does things around you not emotion I'm
[1:20:30] not talking about emotion here we're not
[1:20:32] looking for emotion here we're looking
[1:20:35] for a reality in the word of God that

[1:20:57] being manifested and the proof is in who
[1:21:00] he is calling
[1:21:04] he's calling you
[1:21:06] if you're hearing his voice this morning
[1:21:08] and he's calling you it's because you're
[1:21:09] elected
[1:21:10] it's because you were there from before
[1:21:12] the foundations of the world that's the
[1:21:14] proof of his election
[1:21:16] Hallelujah glory to God he's calling and
[1:21:20] he's calling because he needs to
[1:21:22] manifest and interpret his word for this
[1:21:25] hour

[1:21:30] finished with Revelations 10.

[1:21:59] love that God has for you

[1:22:14] in Romans
[1:22:20] 8 35 thank you brother
[1:22:22] he says who shall separate us from the
[1:22:26] love of Christ I want you to listen
[1:22:28] carefully here these are simple
[1:22:30] scriptures we've read them all the time
[1:22:32] but put it in the context of what we're
[1:22:34] saying here today
[1:22:36] shall tribulation
[1:22:38] or distress
[1:22:40] or persecution
[1:22:42] or famine

[1:22:59] into the same boat Hallelujah because
[1:23:01] he's going to call the winds he's going
[1:23:03] to calm the storms whatever it is that
[1:23:05] you have need of amen he says for as it
[1:23:07] is written for thy sake we are killed
[1:23:10] all the day long we are accounted as
[1:23:12] sleep as sheep for the slaughter
[1:23:15] we are under many trials many
[1:23:20] persecutions many circumstances and
[1:23:22] situations like sheep to the slaughter
[1:23:25] but it does not separate us from the
[1:23:27] love of God it does not nay all these
[1:23:31] things we are more in all these things
[1:23:35] we are more than conquerors through him
[1:23:37] that loved us
[1:23:39] Hallelujah for I am persuaded that
[1:23:43] neither death nor life nor angels nor
[1:23:46] principalities I don't care how many
[1:23:48] demon powers and principalities and
[1:23:51] dominions come down upon our situations
[1:23:54] Upon Our lives our circumstances our
[1:23:57] homes our finance our health and our
[1:23:59] wealth whatever it is I don't care nor
[1:24:01] powers nor things present
[1:24:05] nor things
[1:24:07] to come
[1:24:09] so God knows even what's coming into
[1:24:11] your life and he's made a way for you
[1:24:13] he's made a way for you praise God he's
[1:24:17] opened the door for you God bless you
[1:24:19] brother Tim
[1:24:20] good to see you brother hallelujah amen
[1:24:23] God is already nor height nor depth nor
[1:24:27] any creature shall be able to separate
[1:24:30] us from the love of God which is in
[1:24:34] Christ Jesus our lord
[1:24:36] and as long as you're in Christ then you
[1:24:39] are loved
[1:24:40] you are loved beyond what you could
[1:24:42] possibly imagine and we don't serve God
[1:24:45] because he loved us
[1:24:48] we served we serve him because he loved
[1:24:50] us and we love him
[1:24:53] because God so loved the world that he
[1:24:55] gave his only begotten son you can go
[1:24:57] and tell somebody God loves you and they
[1:25:00] could turn around and say no he doesn't
[1:25:01] and keep walking
[1:25:04] but if you turn around and say
[1:25:06] amen
[1:25:07] and fall in love and he anoints you with
[1:25:10] his word then you are going to love him
[1:25:13] beyond your own understanding
[1:25:16] you're going to experience a love that
[1:25:19] goes beyond even the love that you have
[1:25:21] for your brothers your sisters your wife
[1:25:23] your husband your children this is a
[1:25:25] love that goes beyond all of that we
[1:25:28] call it love we give it a word and we we
[1:25:32] spell it l-o-v-e but it's it's God's
[1:25:36] understanding of his fellowship with
[1:25:39] himself with his attributes with you and
[1:25:43] me as attributes of God there's no
[1:25:45] there's no um
[1:25:48] you know definition of God's love he
[1:25:51] just expresses it and it manifests in
[1:25:54] our lives I know if you're in love with
[1:25:56] the Lord
[1:25:58] I can tell if you're really in love with
[1:25:59] the Lord You're not miserable all the
[1:26:01] time
[1:26:05] there's something there that expresses
[1:26:08] itself in the love of God that it shows
[1:26:11] it it can't it can't help it Hallelujah
[1:26:15] glory to God we serve we serve God
[1:26:17] because he loved us and we love him
[1:26:19] sincerely we have a sincerity to serve
[1:26:23] God not out of fear you know legalism is
[1:26:26] the opposite of Love Did you know that
[1:26:28] if you serve God because of legalism
[1:26:30] it's because you're serving because
[1:26:32] you're expecting something in return
[1:26:35] You're Expecting so the end you could be
[1:26:37] doing it because of fear you know legal
[1:26:39] if I don't do this I'm done if I don't
[1:26:42] pay my tithes I'm gonna go broke
[1:26:46] that's possible
[1:26:48] but that's not always true
[1:26:50] because there's a lot of people that
[1:26:52] don't pay tithes that are very wealthy
[1:26:55] okay so it's got nothing to do with
[1:26:58] paying tithes
[1:27:00] but let me tell you that when it is by a
[1:27:02] revelation
[1:27:04] and you pay your tithes by revelation
[1:27:07] then it places you into the supernatural
[1:27:10] body of Jesus Christ it places you under
[1:27:13] the word of God that he said that my
[1:27:16] word shall not return unto me void
[1:27:20] it places you into a into a a
[1:27:22] relationship with God that where your
[1:27:25] tithing doesn't become just money sent
[1:27:28] by e-transfer it's an investment into
[1:27:31] the kingdom of God
[1:27:33] and there's a there's a deep call to the
[1:27:36] deep as a result of that tithe being
[1:27:38] given there's an understanding behind it
[1:27:41] that becomes Supernatural and then all
[1:27:44] of a sudden Supernatural things start to
[1:27:46] happen around your life
[1:27:48] and all of a sudden your financial needs
[1:27:50] just suddenly something changed a job
[1:27:52] arises a a blessing comes there's an
[1:27:55] inheritance over here there's listen
[1:27:58] don't don't put an interpretation on how
[1:28:01] God will bless you for paying your
[1:28:03] tithes
[1:28:04] or giving your offerings do not in don't
[1:28:06] put an interpretation on that don't try
[1:28:09] to do it because then you limit God
[1:28:12] I'm telling you that God can drop a
[1:28:14] hundred million dollars anywhere he
[1:28:16] wants whenever he wants
[1:28:18] and he can also take it away any time he
[1:28:21] wants whenever he wants Hallelujah so
[1:28:24] don't be looking at that don't be
[1:28:25] looking at you know that it's got to be
[1:28:27] this if I give that oh well if I give it
[1:28:30] you know the Lord said I'll pour out a
[1:28:32] hundredfold so if I give ten dollars
[1:28:34] then I should be getting ten thousand
[1:28:36] I didn't get it last month
[1:28:38] I'm not paying my tithes
[1:28:40] God's word's not true no no no no
[1:28:43] you see that is so carnal
[1:28:46] it's just as carnal as somebody that
[1:28:48] doesn't want to pay it
[1:28:49] you might as well not pay it
[1:28:52] you might as well not bless the kingdom
[1:28:54] of God
[1:28:55] because you are not by Revelation Living
[1:28:58] the Life of Christ that's in you glory
[1:29:02] to God Amen we don't want to do things
[1:29:04] by legalism it's the opposite of love
[1:29:06] it's serving because we expect something
[1:29:09] back or because we're in fear that we're
[1:29:13] going to get it that we're not going to
[1:29:15] get it God's love is unconditional
[1:29:18] God loved you before you were even a
[1:29:22] human before you were even expressed on
[1:29:26] this Earth God loved you because he had
[1:29:28] a plan from before the foundations of
[1:29:30] the world he's bringing you into that
[1:29:33] plan
[1:29:34] that's the Glorious Victory brother
[1:29:36] Philip this is the thing that sets us
[1:29:39] and liberates us from the bondage of
[1:29:41] this world this this it's chaos out
[1:29:44] there this world is falling apart
[1:29:46] there's you know yesterday it was Canada
[1:29:48] Day happy Canada Day listen I was very
[1:29:52] grateful for Canada
[1:29:55] I'm just going to tell you the way it is
[1:29:56] I was sitting with some people yesterday
[1:29:59] and we were talking about it and these
[1:30:01] are people that you know that have lived
[1:30:03] in in this country they're in their 80s
[1:30:05] 90s and they were saying good country
[1:30:09] Canada has been good to us they came
[1:30:11] from the old they came from Europe from
[1:30:13] Italy Portugal different places they
[1:30:15] were saying this country is a good
[1:30:18] country
[1:30:19] we've been we've been blessed in this
[1:30:21] country we've done well in this country
[1:30:23] our families have grown in this country
[1:30:24] and I was saying you know you're right I
[1:30:27] said look we don't have any wars
[1:30:30] we don't have any wars we don't have any
[1:30:32] situations where like I know there's
[1:30:34] countries right now that are completely
[1:30:36] in total chaos people don't even know
[1:30:38] where their next meal is going to come
[1:30:39] from
[1:30:41] but here we are in the land of milk and
[1:30:43] honey God has blessed us by placing Us
[1:30:46] in Canada and we need to be grateful for
[1:30:48] that
[1:30:49] Hallelujah
[1:30:52] it doesn't change the fact that the
[1:30:54] world is going into chaos that's just
[1:30:57] prophecy that's all part of the word of
[1:31:00] God we cannot change that amen praise
[1:31:03] God but God's love is unconditional
[1:31:05] legal is liberalism that's another thing
[1:31:09] you can be you see you got to find the
[1:31:11] balance in life
[1:31:12] you can be told in legalism or you can
[1:31:15] be total liberalism and if you're either
[1:31:18] side they're both wrong and they're both
[1:31:20] against God it's not going to give you
[1:31:23] what you
[1:31:24] what you really need and who you really
[1:31:27] are and allow the Holy Spirit to express
[1:31:29] himself through you because if you think
[1:31:32] I can do anything I want I'm totally
[1:31:34] free I'm liberated I'm a son or daughter
[1:31:37] of God I can do anything I want I can no
[1:31:40] that's not you gotta come subject to the
[1:31:42] word of God
[1:31:43] you've got to let the Holy Spirit deal
[1:31:45] with your life you got to let the holy
[1:31:47] spirit guide you and direct you Sons and
[1:31:50] Daughters of God are led by the spirit
[1:31:53] of God
[1:31:55] they're not led by other Spirits they're
[1:31:57] not led by dominating Spirits they're
[1:32:00] not led by a dominating husband or a
[1:32:03] dominating wife they're led by the
[1:32:05] spirit of God
[1:32:07] there's a difference
[1:32:09] you see it's not liberalism Pure Love is
[1:32:12] pure both ways
[1:32:13] my wife serves me because she loves me I
[1:32:18] know she sincerely loves me and she
[1:32:20] knows that I sincerely love her
[1:32:23] I know that she sees the mistakes in my
[1:32:26] life she knows that I see the mistakes
[1:32:28] in her life we all have the flaws but
[1:32:31] the spirit of God has given us
[1:32:33] revelation of who we really are
[1:32:35] who we really are and we need to we need
[1:32:38] to be respectful to the Sons and
[1:32:41] Daughters of God we need to respect
[1:32:44] their position we need to respect their
[1:32:46] callings we need to respect where God is
[1:32:49] placing them according to his plan and
[1:32:51] his purpose because that's God's plan
[1:32:54] halleluia
[1:32:56] we show love with a motive
[1:32:59] for something else that's not pure love
[1:33:02] if I go to my wife and I say oh honey
[1:33:04] you know praise God you know you this
[1:33:06] meal was absolutely incredible the house
[1:33:08] looks so amazing my God you're so busy
[1:33:11] everything looks so wonderful man you've
[1:33:13] been so busy today you just you've done
[1:33:15] such a beautiful job keeping the house
[1:33:17] and you know I just love and appreciate
[1:33:19] you you know and the guys are going
[1:33:21] golfing next Friday
[1:33:24] would it be okay
[1:33:25] if I go
[1:33:28] you see where's the motive
[1:33:30] he immediately knows that whatever I
[1:33:33] said
[1:33:34] there was a motive behind it
[1:33:37] because I want to go golfing
[1:33:41] that's not the way it works with God
[1:33:44] God doesn't want that kind of motive God
[1:33:46] doesn't want that kind of attitude that
[1:33:48] he doesn't want that kind of a
[1:33:49] relationship
[1:33:50] he wants that pure relationship between
[1:33:54] you and him he wants you to be right he
[1:33:57] just wants you to be straight up with
[1:33:59] him he wants you to be straight honest
[1:34:00] when you're down and out be down and out
[1:34:02] when you need to confess confess when
[1:34:05] you made when when Whatever It Is God
[1:34:07] wants to bless you he's letting you know
[1:34:10] that those things do not change how he
[1:34:13] feels about you they do not change his
[1:34:15] love for you
[1:34:17] he still loves you he still do
[1:34:19] everything that he can for you the true
[1:34:21] revelation of this hour to you
[1:34:24] personally takes you away from
[1:34:26] insecurity
[1:34:28] when you have a revelation you you come
[1:34:30] out of that insecurity you come out of
[1:34:33] that thing where where you're fearful
[1:34:36] the Revelation when it calls you into
[1:34:39] this glorious relationship and
[1:34:41] partnership with God it should break the
[1:34:43] insecurity if I get into partnership
[1:34:46] with somebody that I know is capable
[1:34:48] I've seen it they've proved it over and
[1:34:51] over and over again that they can do
[1:34:52] what they said they can do I lose the
[1:34:55] insecurity of investing my money
[1:34:58] I now invest it with with a with a
[1:35:01] surety with a security with a a
[1:35:03] confidence to know that I've partnered
[1:35:05] with the right person
[1:35:07] well you can have that kind of security
[1:35:09] with God
[1:35:11] if God has called you all your
[1:35:13] insecurities should just vanish
[1:35:16] you should be confident to know that God
[1:35:18] is going to do what he said he's going
[1:35:20] to do it'll take away all insecurity
[1:35:22] about your salvation
[1:35:24] we are free in Christ no fear not not
[1:35:27] fearful but secure in Christ all the
[1:35:31] doubts have been dissolved
[1:35:35] listen I'm going to read Romans chapter
[1:35:37] 4 here
[1:35:42] Hallelujah
[1:35:44] praise God let me take a little drink
[1:35:47] here quickly
[1:35:49] we're going to wind down shoot soon
[1:35:57] Romans 4 verse 4.
[1:36:00] listen here
[1:36:02] now to him that worketh
[1:36:04] is the reward not reckoned of Grace but
[1:36:07] of debt
[1:36:09] you see we don't want to have this kind
[1:36:10] of attitude that that if we do something
[1:36:13] then we get
[1:36:16] there's a law which is called the law of
[1:36:19] sowing and reaping you cannot change
[1:36:21] that
[1:36:22] it's it governs this whole world
[1:36:25] it's called The Law of sowing and
[1:36:26] reaping but when you are adopted
[1:36:30] as a son or a daughter of God into the
[1:36:33] body of Jesus Christ
[1:36:34] and you become partnered with the Holy
[1:36:38] Spirit in your life
[1:36:40] this is what happens
[1:36:42] but to him that worketh not but
[1:36:44] believeth on him that justifieth the
[1:36:47] ungodly his faith is counted for
[1:36:51] righteousness
[1:36:53] even as David also described the
[1:36:56] blessedness of the man unto whom God
[1:36:59] imputeth righteousness without works
[1:37:03] Hallelujah there's nothing that you can
[1:37:06] do
[1:37:07] except say Amen to the word of God
[1:37:09] there's nothing that you can do to
[1:37:11] deserve God's blessing salvation
[1:37:13] protection blessings anointings
[1:37:16] everything that comes with being in the
[1:37:18] body of Christ you can't there's nothing
[1:37:20] that you can do you just need to accept
[1:37:22] it and re and receive it
[1:37:25] God imputed righteousness without work
[1:37:28] saying blessed are they whose iniquities
[1:37:31] are forgiven and whose sins are covered
[1:37:35] you know what iniquity is is when you do
[1:37:38] things and you know it's wrong
[1:37:40] and you can fall into those traps and
[1:37:43] you can do those things but let me tell
[1:37:45] you God has made a way for you
[1:37:48] God has made a way for you God is God
[1:37:51] has made a way for you that from today
[1:37:53] on from right now
[1:37:54] [Applause]
[1:37:55] it can be placed into the sea of God's
[1:37:58] forgetfulness and you can start a new
[1:38:00] life a new walk with God and you can
[1:38:03] change all the circumstances that are
[1:38:05] that are holding you back and keeping
[1:38:07] you in a in a defeated condition and
[1:38:10] under condemnation there's no
[1:38:12] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:38:15] you're not to fall under condemnation
[1:38:17] and you're not and you're not to let
[1:38:19] anybody put you under condemnation
[1:38:22] Hallelujah your opinion of me does not
[1:38:25] change God's opinion of me
[1:38:27] I don't care what you think about me or
[1:38:30] what you expect or or or or how you see
[1:38:34] me or uh you know or or how I see you
[1:38:36] it's it's irrelevant God sees me a
[1:38:38] certain way
[1:38:40] God believes and and knows exactly what
[1:38:43] I'm to fulfill in the word of God and
[1:38:45] you can't stop it and I can't stop it
[1:38:48] we need to accept God the way that he
[1:38:51] sees us not the way that others see us
[1:38:54] oh they're looking at our children and
[1:38:56] they see our children are in the world
[1:38:57] and they're not serving the lord yeah
[1:39:01] do they not need the birth just like you
[1:39:03] need the birth
[1:39:05] we don't want children that we're going
[1:39:06] to conform to the message we're going to
[1:39:08] dress them up make them look like
[1:39:10] they're message Believers and yet they
[1:39:12] don't believe anything they can't wait
[1:39:14] to get out
[1:39:17] you put them into a state of rebellion
[1:39:19] instead of putting them into an
[1:39:21] atmosphere of love
[1:39:23] to know that God's love wants it it's
[1:39:26] expresses on them it'll change them
[1:39:29] let God do the work let God not conform
[1:39:32] them but transform them that's what God
[1:39:36] did for us look at your walk look at
[1:39:39] yours where you came from God he
[1:39:42] transformed you you're not the same
[1:39:43] person that you were and you know it
[1:39:46] [Music]
[1:39:48] Hallelujah glory to God Amen
[1:39:51] thank you Lord
[1:39:53] blessed are those are they whose
[1:39:56] iniquities are forgiven and whose sins
[1:39:57] are covered blessed is the man to whom
[1:39:59] the Lord will not impute sin
[1:40:03] glory to God hallelujah blessed be his
[1:40:06] wonderful name the message of the hour
[1:40:08] should bring us into a greater
[1:40:11] relationship with God and one another
[1:40:15] you know this is all part of the Rapture
[1:40:17] and Faith series that I've been
[1:40:19] ministering on until we can properly
[1:40:22] unite and love one another
[1:40:25] and come into a greater relationship
[1:40:28] with one another the invisible Union of
[1:40:31] the Bride of Jesus Christ is bringing a
[1:40:35] unified revelation of the rapture
[1:40:38] it's it's not a different Revelation for
[1:40:41] you as it is for him as it is for him or
[1:40:45] her it is not a different Revelation
[1:40:48] it's the same Revelation and God is
[1:40:51] going to give you the same Revelation
[1:40:53] that he's given the other person if
[1:40:56] they're in the Rapture and therefore
[1:40:59] they cannot fight
[1:41:01] they can disagree on the things of this
[1:41:04] world I give every right listen I tell
[1:41:08] people all the time you have an opinion
[1:41:10] I respect your opinion amen
[1:41:14] I need you to respect my opinion
[1:41:17] okay
[1:41:18] your opinion is your opinion
[1:41:21] but when it comes to the word of God
[1:41:24] when two sons of God come together
[1:41:27] if one of them denies that word
[1:41:30] there's no True Fellowship there could
[1:41:33] be a
[1:41:34] could be a Jacob and Esau situation
[1:41:37] okay call it what you want but when they
[1:41:40] see the word and they can say Amen to
[1:41:43] that word and they're unified by the
[1:41:45] revelation of that word and it's as
[1:41:48] clear as a bell there's a supernatural
[1:41:50] that's going to wash away all the all
[1:41:53] the the the the the the the the the the
[1:41:55] the the funny things that that are all
[1:41:58] those funny spirits that that hinder
[1:42:00] your relationship as a human being
[1:42:02] because you know you're in this world
[1:42:04] you're you're going to be like strange
[1:42:06] sometimes you got certain quirks about
[1:42:08] you you know you got certain ways about
[1:42:10] you that's normal that's fine
[1:42:11] everybody's got certain quirks certain
[1:42:13] ways attitudes towards certain things
[1:42:16] but when it comes to the word of God
[1:42:17] it's like amen Hallelujah brother praise
[1:42:21] God that's nothing but the truth glory
[1:42:24] to God that Revelation is as clear as
[1:42:26] clear can be and there's no way that you
[1:42:28] can deny the word of God Amen praise God
[1:42:31] forevermore it brings us into a greater
[1:42:34] relationship with one another and we
[1:42:37] need to deal with all things through a
[1:42:40] security relationship
[1:42:43] so if you've got a good solid
[1:42:45] relationship with God
[1:42:47] and you're going to come to your deacon
[1:42:50] and you've got a good relationship with
[1:42:52] God and you're trusting in that office
[1:42:54] as a deacon or your pastor or your
[1:42:57] trustee or whatever and you're and
[1:43:00] you're coming in with the with with a
[1:43:02] relationship that's secure in Christ
[1:43:05] then I'm telling you there's going to be
[1:43:07] Supernatural benefits and answers and
[1:43:12] and and uh solutions to whatever it is
[1:43:16] that you're dealing with
[1:43:17] God is going to give you the right
[1:43:19] solution because you're entering into it
[1:43:21] from a perspective of being secure about
[1:43:25] God and who you are
[1:43:27] if you're insecure
[1:43:29] as a boss and you're insecure and you're
[1:43:32] telling your employees
[1:43:34] do it this way and then the next minute
[1:43:36] no wait wait a minute do it that way no
[1:43:38] hang on no no maybe we should do it no
[1:43:41] you don't know what you're doing
[1:43:43] you're gonna you're gonna train people
[1:43:46] that are going to be like uh you know
[1:43:48] chickens with their heads cut off
[1:43:49] they're going to be going in every
[1:43:50] direction not knowing what they're doing
[1:43:52] but when you come into a relationship
[1:43:54] from a perspective of security in Christ
[1:43:57] knowing where you stand knowing you're
[1:44:00] standing on the rock
[1:44:02] then God will do the rest God will give
[1:44:05] you the wisdom that you need God will
[1:44:07] give you the the the instruction that
[1:44:09] you need from your pastor from your
[1:44:11] Deacon from your brother your sister
[1:44:13] Hallelujah showing the the grace of God
[1:44:17] for one another amen hallelujah my
[1:44:20] position
[1:44:22] my character
[1:44:24] my ideas
[1:44:26] those are human things
[1:44:29] we need to understand their
[1:44:32] our human
[1:44:35] elements but we're not to impress them
[1:44:38] on other people and say no that's the
[1:44:40] way it is
[1:44:41] that's not the way it is you're not
[1:44:43] always right
[1:44:44] I'm going to tell you right now
[1:44:46] I'm not always right and you're not
[1:44:49] always right
[1:44:50] you're going to be wrong
[1:44:53] and when you're wrong you need to admit
[1:44:55] it you need to accept it you need to you
[1:44:58] need to allow the spirit of God because
[1:45:00] the minute you release that thing you're
[1:45:02] free
[1:45:03] you become free now and God can move you
[1:45:06] to the next step saying that's the kind
[1:45:07] of character I'm looking for
[1:45:09] that's the kind of character that I'm
[1:45:11] thinking about the message of this hour
[1:45:13] should take away all the fear of this
[1:45:16] dimension
[1:45:18] we're coming into maturity now we're
[1:45:20] coming into a place where we where we
[1:45:23] know who we are we we we're strong in
[1:45:26] the Lord we should not have fear of of
[1:45:29] what this world can do to us
[1:45:32] we have confidence in the Lord it brings
[1:45:35] you back into your genuine position as
[1:45:38] an attribute of God when you place
[1:45:40] yourself right there where God wants you
[1:45:44] you become a genuine part there's
[1:45:47] nothing like a genuine part
[1:45:49] when you replace it in a vehicle
[1:45:52] Hallelujah
[1:45:54] our children need to have the same
[1:45:57] transformation
[1:45:59] as we did
[1:46:03] and let me just read
[1:46:04] as we close here now I'm going to read
[1:46:06] Colossians
[1:46:11] yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna end
[1:46:13] it here Colossians
[1:46:16] 1.
[1:46:21] let the musicians come
[1:46:32] from verse 19
[1:46:35] for it please the father that in him
[1:46:37] should all fullness dwell
[1:46:40] and having made peace through the blood
[1:46:44] of his cross by him to reconcile all
[1:46:47] things unto himself
[1:46:51] he paid the price
[1:46:53] for whatever it is that's holding you
[1:46:55] back
[1:46:56] from giving yourself completely
[1:46:59] over to God
[1:47:02] you say oh but I did this or oh but I'm
[1:47:05] carrying that or oh but this situation
[1:47:07] no no
[1:47:08] listen what it says here and having made
[1:47:11] peace through the blood of his cross
[1:47:13] by him to reconcile all things
[1:47:16] everything's coming back exactly to the
[1:47:19] original genuine attribute that you are
[1:47:24] it's going to surface in your life
[1:47:26] and when it fully fully manifests you're
[1:47:29] going to be changed in a moment you are
[1:47:31] sealed until the day of your Redemption
[1:47:34] but on the day that you are redeemed the
[1:47:37] seal comes off
[1:47:39] Hallelujah the seal comes off because
[1:47:42] then you are what you always were
[1:47:45] glory to God Amen but he says here he
[1:47:49] says reconcile all things by him I say
[1:47:51] whether they be things in Earth or
[1:47:54] things in heaven and you that were
[1:47:57] sometime alienated and enemies in your
[1:48:00] own mind by Wicked Works yet now hath he
[1:48:04] reconciled he has brought you out of
[1:48:07] that situation
[1:48:08] I don't care what your mind has been
[1:48:10] that battle that goes on between your
[1:48:12] your you know the the the good and the
[1:48:14] and that good Angel and that that evil
[1:48:16] angel that that bottled you and tells
[1:48:19] you every day that you're this you're
[1:48:20] that no no no he's he's he's taken that
[1:48:24] and he's taken that enemy and he's wiped
[1:48:26] it out
[1:48:27] he's reconciled you in the body of his
[1:48:29] flesh through death to present you holy
[1:48:33] and unblameable and unreprovable in his
[1:48:36] sight if ye continue like now watch if
[1:48:40] you continue in the faith grounded and
[1:48:43] settled and be not moved away from the
[1:48:46] hope of the Gospel which you have heard
[1:48:49] and which was preached to every creature
[1:48:51] which is under heaven
[1:48:53] whereof I Paul am a minister
[1:48:57] of this word

[1:49:13] different you will you will face
[1:49:16] situations differently you will face
[1:49:17] them because of a security and a
[1:49:21] relationship that you have with God that
[1:49:23] gives you confidence to know that that
[1:49:25] God is able to overcome that he's
[1:49:28] already made a way for me to overcome
[1:49:30] that
