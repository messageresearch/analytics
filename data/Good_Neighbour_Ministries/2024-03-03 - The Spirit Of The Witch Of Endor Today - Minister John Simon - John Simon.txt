hallelujah thank praise God thank you very much God bless all of you God bless everyone here happy to have you in the presence of the Lord God bless you real good we'll turn in our scripture to our scripture first Samuel uh 28 and we'll read just from the 3D verse to the 7th just to give a background but in your own time you can read the entire chapter which will give you a better idea oh praise God let us pray our gracious and eternal Heavenly Father not just that I'm standing here but father uh for the people to have confidence and faith that you an unseen being envelops us into your divine presence and that you by the instrumentality of the word of God can speak not to our flesh but to speak to our hearts and that with the opening of the eyes of the heart we may recognize you we may give you praise and honor and Glory father for you have not changed but the devil has blinded the eyes of man and took them away in darkness so they can't recognize you because you being invisible but we recognize you we know you by the word we pray that once again you'll speak to us by the word that we might be in the correct time and season and the application of the word will be for the day and the moment that we're living in we give you glory and praise with all thanks in Jesus name amen God bless you and our scripture reads now Samuel was dead and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in his own town of Rama Saul expelled the mediums and spiritist uh had expelled the mediums and spiritists from the land the Philistines assembled and came and set up a camp at shim while Saul gathered all the Israelites and set up a camp at gilboa when Saul saw the Philistine Army he was afraid Terror filled his heart he inquired of the Lord but the Lord did not answer him by dreams or ur ur or prophets Saul then said to his attendants find me a woman who is a medium that I may go and inquire of her and there is one in Endor they said amen praise the Lord God bless you all please be seated if I seem to um weave bob and weave and move around it's because I'm I just uh uh printed some of the quotes from brother brandham and the rest is just the scribbles in my own handwriting cuz I had a sermon to bring but around close to midnight all of a sudden that went away and then I just had to uh hand write everything here scribble right I should say um I'll be ashamed to show you uh anyway we're glad to be here in the house of God are you happy to be here amen I am too what I want to talk about is something that I didn't think about but I'd like to talk about the spirit of the witch of En or today now uh we realize that everywhere around the world there is a rise in in spiritism how many of us does don't know about psychics I uh on television they were advertising to hire people that will go and work for a certain company as psychics we know that King presidents are seeking psychics and witches um they're searching to know what is happening in the Unseen everywhere there is this stigma that it's okay to be a witch or a wizard but oh my God over in India and China they got Witch Doctors it's no different amen no different they're all the same they all going into that same realm mediums everywhere they're everywhere in the land they're everywhere in the society now why I'm saying that is because when uh the spirit of God caught a hold of me as a child I would say before I come to a full consciousness of what it was at about 14 years old then uh the spirit of God began to move in such an awesome way which we didn't know because we believe that's the way a real Christian ought to be and that's how it was in the Bible and I'm trying to make this as short as possible but with that uh with that uh inner sense and that childlike fa faith in the word of God a Revival broke out in the city and it broke out in so much that they were filling buses and bringing people from other cities and uh I've told you before there's a church there with over 3,000 people now that's it's in Pentecost because I was on the Pentecost at that time and it's still there now the the see what was happening is that we get on a bus and and and Devils will start screaming out uh people will start speaking in tongues getting the Holy Ghost and uh the sick would be healed blind deaf dumb crippled all kinds it was happening because it was the spirit of God and a work of God going for his glory and honor amen and we would be approached by these Wizards and witches several times and we would have to let them know there's a difference between us we want nothing to do with you but they're always like a moth attracted to Flame like insects attracted to light they always were attracted to light all right and they're coming and saying different things and that's the way it was but and then would shake some of their hands and just say Hi how are you oops up in the air down on the ground devil screaming coming out and um in the presence of some of the missionaries from America they were there they saw some of those things and so uh the idea is that devils and demons and witches and wizards are only people that look wearing feathers wearing bones wearing certain colors and they look weird then that's a real witch that's a real wizard no no no not at all I I've seen real principals of universities come in the meeting and the next thing you know we're casting out the devil yeah I was just a young man oh thank you brother that's all right uh you see this uh I'm trying to show you that the devil has gone on the cover right from those days when he was wide open and making himself uh manifested where you could see uh the demons come on a man and he he'd rush over to a a big massive tree and go bang bang bang and a tree would Shake no blood nothing happened then he come to himself and he's just normal now the devil's smart he's cunning he he he moved away from that and mov it into gentility he moved moved it into refinement and into society he moved me to a place of acceptability where we can look and say oh that can't be a devil why you see uh now here comes a great opera singer from England to sing in South America and my thousands of people turn out singing and everything else like that and well he had heard about those meetings and those things so he came and saw myself and brother Patterson uh privately and we talking to him Devils manifest we wouldn't go out and tell the rest of people to embarrass the guy and also to break whatever he's doing because God didn't tell us to do that he just wanted us to know these things hide anywhere and you don't look at a queen a king you don't look at a prime minister a president and just say oh oh no it can't no the devil can work anywhere amen and so uh brother sister I'm letting you know that that you would be aware of it I spoke that some weeks ago how I was just going into a a dollar store and right at the door the guy was there sitting to you know get some coins and next thing you know his eyes start turning over his head he fall to the ground oh my I I I just have to move away quickly right now is it me no but God is doing something and the same like he did when the shadow of those Apostles and the presence of those prophets not saying I'm one of them but the Holy Spirit he is the one that's doing these things and letting us know that he is coming again thank you Jesus he's coming again and this coming that I'm talking about precedes his physical personal coming on the sins but he doesn't just appear it starts coming in the spirit the anointing the presence of the Living God starts coming in and back to the church I believe the spirit of God is coming back to the church in a mighty way I believe that God once again is causing his word to live again which was buried in the ement of the seven Church ages and now by the rising of the Sun by the word of God through God's Prophet the spirit of God is bringing the word of God once again into prominence amen I believe it praise God so uh demons have not become extinct they have not disappeared and if you start to wake yourself up and receive and recognize every believer has a certain element of discernment every believer now you may not have at certain levels it might be just on a lower level but God will give you a certain sense of discernment you're talking with somebody they're fighting with you and then all of a sudden the Holy Spirit say what why are they fighting I haven't said anything I haven't done anything what's that see you'll start to recognize it's Devils recognizing the word in you and the life that is in you and they start fighting against that it's not a personal thing you as the human individual that they're really fighting against but it's the same as the prophet said the greatest battle Lev fought the longest running War it's the same battle going on all the time and we are like no man's land caught in the middle of it amen because you know the devil is trying to get control God has control he's trying to take that away amen but here we understand that battle is going on and we're caught in the middle of it amen yes sir so hidden under the veneer of human society the these demonic powers are still still at work yes oh they're working today and they're wearing beautiful suits lovely dresses magnificent appearance now we won't be going off on these side tangents but you understand the devil was the most beautiful creature that God made at that time the Bible says so he was beautiful uh absolutely Splendid and the and Prophet said it the devil Works through Beauty but God works through faith and his word he works through character it doesn't work by that that has its place but it doesn't work by like that but so so that's how the demon work demons work and they're under this veneer of society they're even try to D dominate you by by by their imposing uh manners and culture and uh ways that they have they'll try to dominate the spirit that is in you and uh they work through bringing the spirit of fear upon people upon Believers if they can get you to become fearful and Afraid then they are going to start having the upper hand not that we are to be a aggressive not that we are be just in humility and in Simplicity know who we are we are certain of God Amen we are conscious of his divine presence and when we walk we walk with him and in Him Praise the Lord and they recognize you and they recognize what is in you praise God and they don't want to deal with that amen they're underneath all this modern f fashion modern fashion is just Satan stripping the people like he did even in the garden they're making the dresses uh you can't even find a good dress in the store you you can't find it anymore because uh he's just leaving it up to the point where the Prophet said they're going to walk the streets in bikinis right he saw in the vision just having a leaf in front of them and that's not he's talking about the women but it's the whole society he's telling you the degression of the entire Society it's going to go down and that's what is we are engaged in right now I'm talking about what's happening right now with the message right praise God hallelujah now so they're operating still in this Mortal realm go read or listen to the message uh seducing Spirits operating in the religion realm and that mainly is what I want to touch on here to show that that same spirit that was on the witch of Ender has now come into the religious realm and it's now working in this message it's working in this message at this particular time like that it's invaded the entire church world and it's right in the message that has backslid like Saul was from the message of the Prophet right now if you will look at the scripture we just read and it came to pass that Samuel was dead the prophet was theread and while the prophet was a li the Bible says that Saul put to death wishes Wizards spirs he put them to death and even passed a law that they should not be allowed to live but after Samuel died the Bible tells us he went to seek the Lord and when he went to seek the Lord he tried to get the Lord to give him a dream and he couldn't get dreams now he went and uh went before various prophets that were there remember there's always a major prophet but beneath there the names never mentioned by a certain man of God a certain Prophet a certain and their names never mentioned Bible but there was a lot of them under that level of that Prophet main Prophet that was there and he went to seek the those other ones and when he talked to them the Bible says God would not speak to him through those prophets neither he would't speak to him no he would't do it yes so why would he do it he wouldn't do it at all and then he said he went to the priest the high priest and trying to get him to get the U and Tom him to reflect the lights of God flashing on it will tell you what to do but the to him would not work no voice was heard no lights came on God didn't reveal himself he forgot he had killed the priest and then now he comes back and he's seeking uh to get the connection through the urum by a priest he forgot about that right so all this was going on so Saul was backslid he was still a Jew he was still in the message he was still a Christian but he was backslid backslid from off of the real true word of God and didn't know really what uh it was and what was really happening at this particular time praise God now let me go to our Prophet speaking when the witch of Endor called called up the spirit of Samuel and Saul looked at him he recognized him to be Samuel and Samuel also recognized Saul for he said why did you call me out of my rest seeing that you become an enemy of God see he's backslid he he wasn't lost but he was backslid he became an enemy of God he was was fighting the will of God he was a rebellious child he would not let the spirit have preeminence in his entire life amen now when the witch seen him the witch saw him and you'll see why I put emphasis on that and uh she fell on the ground now well Saul said I want to know how is the battle going to go Samuel said to him tomorrow you'll die in the battle you and your sons and by this time tomorrow night you are going to be here with me now I'm saying that because you might read some theologians and different teachers saying that Saul committed suicide and died from suicide we know Saul did not commit suicide because it's right in the Bible where it says Samuel told him you're going to die in the battle and you're going to be here with me which means to say that even though he get killed in the battle even though he was backsliding they're going to be in Paradise together he say you're going to be here with me tomorrow not next week not after the priest prayed for you not after you had uh uh all your various prayers and candles burning then you're going to be with me no when you die you and your sons are going to be here with me tomorrow thank you Jesus he did not Comm commit suicide but he was backslid but he was still a Son of God Amen do you believe that I believe in eternal security I believe once God Saves you you're always saved I'm talking about real salvation I'm not talking about crybaby salvation praise praise the Lord just let me preach praise the Lord yes I'm I'm not talking about a little wipe of mascara off of your eyelashes and and then oh Jesus I'm saved oh I'm born again no no no I'm not talking about that I'm talking about when the spirit the Deep calls to the deep that Spirit In God calls back to the depths of your heart and grabs a hold of your soul you I can't explain it you can't explain it but you know something supernatural has taken place in your life and you'll never be the same again you recognize something because something struck your soul you recognize God working by his spirit amen hallelujah we got a lot of those cry baby cry eyes Hot Tomato uh uh Born Again experience but we're not talking about that we're talking about when a true son a true daughter recognizes who they really are that you wonder through this world like another person trying to live like a ordinary person like that ordinary human being and have the same taste the same fashion live the same way enjoy the same things but then you recognize always something in you you feel different you you don't know why you're different you don't know why you have a you you act this way but the spirit of God comes and causes you to recognize you are not a creature of time you are a creature of Eternity you come from the presence of almighty God you've been confined or imprisoned now in a human body but the spirit of God by the blood of Christ Hallelujah has come to you to set you free and to bring you back where you come from amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen now we know there are dimensions there are secrets he says there between me and God but let me tell you a little bit you Jesus said you are a light that sets on a hill amen see that's Christians they lights you believe that amen why you think the Bible calls you the morning Stars your lights you can't see it I've had them come up to me and so what is it about you I I see I look at you I see a light I'm not saying that to compare self with brother brandham I'm trying to tell you the truth right exactly I've seen a light not over me but I see a light in you right and uh and of course he goes on and said they sent me to you to say I said no you don't tell me what they sent you for let me tell you your future I have the part to tell you your future of course when I start telling him he runs runs like if uh you know fire is after him anyway he says Christians in this conglomeration of this dimension of Mortals oh well going this way you'll go downwards the next Dimension is The Souls of the unjust who have died not knowing god below that is the dimension of demons and then we find out uh unjust Souls demons hell you see there's a trinity there see oh my think about it mortal then are influenced from down there or they influenced from up there see there it is now what happened with that Witch of Endor she BR into the into this Dimension see and called up the spirit of Samuel in other words her spirit broke into that Dimension amen where demons the unjust dead and stuff like that are and was able to call up the spirit of Samuel later on I'll explain to you when he says Samuel was not yet into the heavenlies because all the prophets Patriarchs and all them were believing unto the coming of the Messiah and they were only covered by the blood of bulls and goats which was not capable of redeeming them and bringing them back to God Amen so so they they were still there so she could break into that realm and call Samuel right and she called the spirit of Samuel amen praise God it some it wasn't somebody impersonating Samuel it was Samuel amen praise God now Saul went to the prophet he asked and and when he went to the prophets he didn't see no they didn't see no Visions for him he went and asked the Lord for a dream and the lord gave him no dream you see when you in backsliding you in a real problem problem say God and answered my prayers God this happened you know I pray for this and this happened and well you don't want to keep your relationship with him good you don't want to keep in fellowship with him right uh you don't want to walk with him but yet you're looking for these things it doesn't work that way Amen Let Me continue see now the prophet he went there then to speak to the you uran tum him and he killed the priest so the uran tum W flash for him it wouldn't flash so all he was left with brother Brandman said he disguised himself themselves and crawled up to go see a witch of Endor and saying call me the spirit of Samuel now think about this man that was left over the kingdom he passed the law to kill all witches and wizard when the prophet was alive now the prophet is dead he is going on Consulting with these same witches and wizards a to them to ask wisdom instead of getting to go to God so he the spirit of can on him now you w't listen to me you w't talk to me and no I'm going to go and talk to these witches and some I'm going to get an answer whether you talk to me or not is in Rebellion against God he's fighting the spirit of the Living God Amen yes sir praise God now see that's the way it is Saul was not lost for a grain of wheat cannot produce nothing else but a weat no matter how it behaves amen see the man was only backslid did but he was not lost right he had only become an enemy of God fighting against God but he was not lost so can you so can anybody you fight against God and then you get the recompense of it and there season in your life when you kind of drift away from God and then everything seems to be going wrong and this and and if you're a Believer you recognize it and you kind of back pedal as we say you know as if you were always there with with him and take your position is that right Amen Let the Holy Spirit have his way praise God hallelujah you see we understand uh to and I'm putting this in so you might have this knowledge Saul never committed suicide like some of them teachers say a Philistine Killed him and you know it's in the Bible how David killed the Philistine for killing the Lord's anointed is that right so he did not commit suicide but this man was killed by David for taking the life of God's anointed from him praise God now we were just talking about the witch of Endor we're talking about how the church started to concert with her we talking about how some of these preachers in type uh starting to seek her out and uh uh uh wanting to get answers from her because the real prophet of the hour is now dead they're not seeing all the big signs and wonders and miracles and they're not hearing the dust say the Lord anymore they're not seeing all the crowds of tens of thousands of people and they're not getting all the victories like they used to have and uh they they tried every possible thing and still trying they'll try to do it by music they'll try to do it by singing they'll try to do it by uh camp meetings conventions they'll try to do it by this or that whatever oh my it doesn't work that way the prophet Samuel was dead and Samuel and Saul was at a loss to know what to do see if he had broke into that same spirit that Samuel was in he would have known what to do but the spirit of God would have let him many of them don't realize that when that is the spirit that Joshua broke in when Moses was here what what happened before Moses died the spirit that was on him went and uh went there on 70 other men they're not even mentioned in the bible but it's there the spirit went on 70 other men partially not the same way but in little pieces pieces like on the day of Pentecost the spirit of Christ came down on the apostles just little tongues little tongues here tongues there praise God begin to anoint them now we see my friends this is where we're at where now uh you can find these quotes I don't need to give you that brother brenus often time called the Catholic Church a witch he says the Catholic church is a witch the spirit of this Witch of Endor is not just on the Catholic church but it's all in the Protestant churches right now amen and it's gone even deeper the message came and the devil leap over there to copycat everything that was done by the prophet and that Spirit of the witch of Endor is in this message here today as I'm standing here and it's working amongst the people now notice see that Catholic Church believes in into communion of Saints or in other words tacting dead people Same Spirit now am I speak saying what is the word Same Spirit contacting dead people just like the witch of Endor all right and a people who have gone on and let me tell you in the name of the Lord It's purely spiritualism and you say oh the Protestant Church don't do that oh right they got their own homemade Apostles Creed passed down to them from their mother believing in the Holy Catholic Church believing in the father son Holy Ghost right believing in the communion of saints they they they they repeated they say the same thing we believe in the communion of saints right like that it's all in there Apostles Creeds see so right there from the Catholic Church they believe in that same communion of saints and it brings them Protestants right into spiritualism like their mother it brings them into spiritualism like their mother then when they see the spirit of God moving in a person they want to claim that person to be a devil and to put them down see that's what they're trying to do amen oh praise God forever more let me tell you friends if you are interceding with any kind of a spirit that's gone on a spirit of someone gone on outside of God now and he mentioned here I wouldn't give you the whole quote but he said he said some people sometimes see the spirit of their mother or or they'll see their old Daddy come back or they'll see an uncle or a friend or somebody telling them something and a few times that devil will speak and the thing seems to be right and so now they start expecting to see their daddy you're expecting and that devil now has the control to be able to lead them up with lies okay see and deceive them now so we see if you are ince proing with any kind of a spirit like that from someone that is gone on outside of God Christ is the only mediator between God and man then you will find yourself that you are in spiritualism in religion right he says it right here in religion spiritualism in religion oh God have mercy brother sister this is it what's going on now now we know the Holy Spirit can fall in a group of people they'll speak in tongues they'll make it exactly everything like that but and see and you can then they can prophesy and then you can go to a witch or a medium or something like the witch of Endor see and many times they will say things that will be exactly true do you know that he says they can say things that will be exactly true right we won't go to tell you the times like the woman came and say you you're not ordinary you you got a gift you come God you're sent from God you and she was telling him exactly the truth he says but he didn't listen to her cuz somewhere the line that thing is going to swerve and gone into a lie so you didn't want to listen in the first place and put it away right now so you see then that the Witch and that Spirit of that Witch of Endor it could be exactly true but still it isn't there are witches speaking in tongues I've seen Devils speak in tongues youve heard me tell you about that right or my own uh schoolmate we praying for what praying and praying for him and next thing you know he's speaking in fluent towns and he became a diplomat and a linguist for the foreign Ministry and all that brilliant but it was Devils right gave him that ability to do that right so there it goes that don't mean anything but the real thing is the word of God you must take everything back to the word amen amen you can do some of these things without the word but when you get to the word it doesn't and it begins doing it then watch it exactly come to pass exactly the right way and the right thing see see but God himself chooses people and uses them as he has appointed them for his own Divine wisdom you believe that am do you know in another quotation you can search it where he says do you know the gift that them witches and wizards have is almost like the same thing that I have but they have surrendered that over to the devil they hand it and they put it to the devil but this life is surrendered over to God and God uses it for his for his glory and for his honor now you can go off and start to see why he tells you in Pentecost not that speaking in tongues is unscriptural but don't accept that as the infallible evidence of the Holy Ghost because the devil is in a state of infiltration subversion and he is working he is working in that way yes sir and they can speak in fluent wonderful tongues and everything else and the next thing you know when they're on covered which I've seen it they switch from Tong to cursing wow they switch from Tong to lying right my goodness my friends some of you are old enough that has been with me for many years you have seen it a devil fall on the ground and the person is moving like a snake in the middle of the church like that there is not imagination it happens now this is the day that we're living in amen it's not about me no no not Big Miracle Mira no no no you want to hide you want to live a hidden life let the spirit of God receive the glory let him manifest let him show forth his presence and his power by this word because it's the word that does it all amen the devil don't want to tangle with the word amen but you start thinking of yourself as something that don't mean nothing to him yes sir amen now he says there you know there was this great woman medium in the readers's digest see they gave they took her over to Egypt there and brought some French men down and he asked her to call for a certain person and she actually pulled up that dead person and the tone of her voice changed she began to talk with the same voice like that dead person had right and everything like the dead person did how they acted and went on and but you see that was that and so brother Bram is saying there are some of these people are still out there that can do do these things and it's real what they're doing it is not of God but it's real you can't deny it it's out there okay he says but do you know even in their realm there is a lot of bogus lot of make belief mediums spiritualists and psychics make believe why he said and look what it is the Bible teaches such someone said to me brother Bram do you believe that yes I do yes sir the Bible teaches that there is such things like the witch of Endor it is a devil let me tell you it is a devil you believe that it is a devil but she's got to have a lot of impersonators oh my think of it they the police caught some of them the other day where's a great judge supposedly gone to the Seance and felt the touch of his ghostly mother's hands upon him and the next morning when the police investigated they found it was a fake piece of cheese cloth used to brush against his hand causing to believe it was the soft and tender hands of his loving dead mother you see he didn't touch her hand but what is that it's under this it's nothing but Bunches of money making schemes you want me to read that again he says beneath that is nothing but moneymaking schemes there psychics everywhere mother this mother that sister that you can go have a reading over here you can see that yourself in the tea leaves you don't have to see it in the Bible leaves you can see it in in the tea leaves you can go out there and see it everywhere you can see it in the bones you can see it in the dice throw that Dice and you can see it over there no I'm not saying these things to educate you how to go about it I'm just telling you so you know what to avoid and walk away from right oh praise God yes sir so there it is it's moneymaking schemes trying to impersonate the real spiritualists that are out there so they have that but over here we have on this side they are now trying to impersonate a real Christian amen by becoming make Believers and not real Believers trying to impersonate the spirit of the Living God hallelujah amen do you believe this thank you Jesus amen I know the regular preacher doesn't preach on these things and talk along these lines but let me tell you even even if I'm not around later on it's going to come up just the same way when I first preached many years ago that you know when it says there in page seven of of uh the uh stature of a perfect man that man the seal he says come to a close and now that man that woman that will be in the Eternal Church age that will begin after the seals oh you were crazy you're mad you're this you're that but now they're all preaching it they're all preaching it they're all jumping at it anyway uh praise God now you see that's the devil and I want you to know that uh even preachers have called me a spiritual and I've read a few books where they call him that call him an occultist and everything else like that he said but that's what always happens when Jesus himself was here they called him be elub see because he told Nathaniel on the three under that before you were under that Victory I saw you right they call him a a spiritualist and everything else because you see there's a lot of devil Powers working against what he was doing just that which of Endor Spirit see there wasn't spiritual and some of these preaches are not spiritual enough to discern between right and wrong the spirit of God and the spirit of the devil and that is the way it is today and that is why it said the spirit of the witch of Endor today right oh my now Jesus said says it's not only that way but he you call me Master of the House of beab how much more are they going to call you you see now he's talking about the end of the world he's talking about this time now where after he's gone towards the end that they're going to start calling you the same thing because when the spirit of God start making itself manifest through you amen I'm not talking about me I'm saying the least of you sitting down here today if you keep faithful to God the same music that was back there acts to acts working and sounding through the lives of the Apostles can't you hear it that same music he heard when he saw them churches marching once again that music is coming again the great Symphony the great director directing that music the music is coming again I can hear it amen I don't know about you but I'm hearing it praise the lord it's coming again brother sister and we're not walking to the edge of a cliff to go down we are going up with the first resurrection we're going up under this inspiration of this message of this day praise God hallelujah amen praise God glory to God now let me bring to you what I am trying to tell you here this application praise God hallelujah amen the application I'm bringing to you is that same Catholic church with that same Spirit of a witch right burning of incense burning of all kinds of smells you go into uh some of these Cathedrals and you almost drunk I've gone we gone to Israel and some of the sisters come out there there and they can't hardly walk because the incense got them staggering they they their head just filled with the smoke and the smells of the incense and uh they craftily uh they craftily uh uh F fashion the entire um Services if I will call it that right with the sounds of bells it's the five senses that's another service but they're appealing to the five senses heightened five senses because that's what the incense does is heightens your your your your senses and deadens other senses and then the The Sounds catches your auditory uh abilities and then the colors they they're really into various colors that are out there like Jacob with the colors there how it changed the shape they're using the same kinds of strategies that's why they always have all kinds of colored things on their walls and glass windows and whatnot like that now we see that this is in effect right now and people are unaware they're absolutely blind to it oh it's beautiful oh it's lovely you think you had a service that's not a service you think that's a church that's a Barn what we have here is a cathedral it's it's beautiful look at the artistic structure look at this and that it's and it's wonderful I love to go visit them see them I love to go to those things and tour them and everything else like that but friends we find out that the message has now come to a state where brother brandham is dead how many knows that he's dead you said well why would you ask that because there are some people that believe he's still not dead and the spirit of the witch of Endor is now on some people that are going and calling for the prophet to come back from the dead they're calling for him to come up so they can ask him some of their questions and answers once again they want to see these Mighty miracles of how they can have victory in in certain meetings and uh claiming making all manner of claims absolutely in that way yes sir praise God let me tell you friends it's simple without this revelation of the word any church any group any preacher that doesn't have an inkling of the revelation of the word amen yes sir is absolutely caught in witchcraft they're under the Dominion of this Same Spirit you know there are principalities Powers dominions that control cities control neighborhoods control men control a home control Nations why the prophet said we are not Americans if you realize where you're born from where you're really born from where you come from my flesh come from South America but me the person that here I come from God and I'm going back to God Amen I'm set free by the spirit of almighty God recognize who you are and who God is amen yes sir praise God he says my I am not just the child of Charles and Ella branam oh my father Jehovah God hallelujah I come from you praise God that that's what all of us have got to recognize amen that we are we are the real EES and we didn't come from some alien planet in outer space but uh we are already as Paul said we are strangers pilgrims and Aliens it's in your Bible you you don't notice those things but it's right there Paul said we are aliens to them they you right they won't call you a martian but they'll they'll just look at you and say mhm yeah I see just like the lawyer told me when he says well how did that happen I said well it's God he says yes God see see that's how they look at it you you you just use God as an excuse to get out of a certain situation amen so right now you you must know there are believers that go and they pray at brother bram's grave in jonville Indiana do you know that and when they go praying by the grave of brother Braham some of them lights or sometimes and next when take a picture and there's like a white dove and there you know all these things and it looks upon a spiritual is it makes it no difference than them going to Lords and seeing a vision of Mary they're starting to set up shrines to the prophet they don't call it a shrine you understand but that's what it is they expect if they go back to Arizona on Sunset Mountain to that big rock where uh the prophet was and the angel came down there they might see something they believe if they find find the cave and I know preachers that that that that that spent thousands and thousands of dollars to find the cave that brother Bram used to go praying secretly and all these things and then they make that place like a holy place it's a sacred place because the prophet prayed here or did this or did that oh my brother sister amen do you know they've gone so far that uh go back to when Prophet saw the vision of that Serpent and when he should have cut off the head of it completely he didn't and he realized that now this this belief that he could be maybe the Messiah or that he was Christ and then he said no no no you're making me an antichrist by calling me that or by thinking of me like that amen and that same Spirit after he died that same Spirit has been coming on people right down to this time is that right until you know that there are some others that are praying in his name how many of you know that there are few people that have are well aware of it it's not just me saying it here people are using Brother bram's name to pray instead of of the Lord Jesus Christ just stop to think about it and then we find out some of them are not only uh uh praying in his name they're baptizing in his name they're baptizing in his name because he is the present tense Jesus Christ back there when the spirit of God was back there was in a man named Jesus that's why they baptized in his name now it is in a man name Branham so we baptize in his name right that's how they look at it now you've got to know and hear these things so that you are fortified thank youus because people are going to come up and throw some of the stuff in your face but you already been forewarned you been fortified by the word and you were able to meet the devil and pull the sword and be able to chop his head off is that right is that right I said chop his head off praise God hallelujah amen praise God yes sir they're praying in his name they're baptizing in his name and they are waiting to him to come back from the dead they're just waiting for his appearance like this Witch of Endor they're waiting for his appearance for him to come back from the dead they wanted Samuel to come back from the dead now they're waiting for this Prophet to come back from the dead de and then they're going to use quotations to prove that he's going to come back from the dead I prove to you from the word of God I prove from you the quotes that he coming back from the dead they say remember when the prophet spoke about the 10th vision and he spoke about preaching in the tent and in the and when he said other words like I'll ride the Trail once more and he tell them I'm just resting but if you wait then I'll be you see they did not understand that the tent was only a symbol of the entire message right that's what he was speaking to in those days was a lot of people but it's not a lot of those thousands even got a revelation of what he was talking about but he could foresee that the tent of the message will be so wide and if we were to speak one day on the T Vision you'll see he said so when he continue preaching and preaching as his preaching went on went on he says most of them that were following and listening to him he said they went away searching for biscuits looking for biscuits and crackers and the others stayed right there while it's bringing the word of God I believe you amongst that family Hallelujah many that start running together with us in this race many but where are they now where are they now but you see we don't contr we don't control where God plants a seed where God doesn't plant a seed where a person is backslid where they're not really saved that's not for us we don't have nothing to do with that all we know is that they wandered away from the word of God Amen and this is where we're at now they're waiting for him to come back from the dead and to come back and preach in the tent but he's preaching in the tent but they don't understand that he's preaching in the tent it's not brother William brandham preaching in the tent it's the holy ghost preaching through William brandham that is preaching in the tent it's the voice of the sign amen it's the great voice of the Living God hallelujah that voice has now become voices and those voices are the Thundering Waters amen which The Sinner which the unbeliever can't recognize it's the voice of God in these last days and it's working through the Believers through the individuals God hiding again in Simplicity is that right I'm just getting emotional praise the Lord but God's hid in Simplicity really for the spirit of God to work it doesn't matter if the man shouts whether he speaks loud uh you don't judge the person by their way of of how they express the spirit of God through them because God works in his own way sometimes he deliberately does things to drive your away God sometimes God i' I've seen it happen in my own life I'm preaching I'm preaching and in the middle of preaching I turn around and said they know the Lord and I say something and I'm pointing to the person and they leave in a huff because I knew something and I go and tell them in front of all the people get up from there pews there and my here with this kind of thing going on I said brother you you say you want the spirit of God and when the spirit of God really begins to move you say it's not the spirit of God you know oh my one preacher came by he says brother you better pray to God that you all have the spirit of God come in this church you need the spirit of God working in the people all in the spirit came comes back another time he says oh my God he says the spirit of God is so much in this church but brother I got to tell you you don't have the real deep teaching of the word now I said brother make up your mind we just have the Deep we have the teaching of the word or do we have the spirit of God Amen he doesn't know what to do with himself because that's the way God works the wind blows where list today it's just a soft Breeze tomorrow it's a storm the next day it's something else no there's no one way God has his own choosing in his own way work amen I can't be brother Tim brother Tim can't be me I can't be brother Danny I can't be brother Desmond and who can be like brother coffee oh my God I'm Ministry of its own praise the Lord hallelujah praise God what I'm saying you every every one is original everyone is what God made them and how God choose to use them for his glory and honor amen praise the Lord so I want you to see anyway I'm placing the spirit of Endor and letting you know it's right here in the message I'm going to be winding this up now praise God because made the point amen now they come back and in the spirit we find out they want brother Bram to raise up from the dead and to come back like that you know that's a deception do you remember brother bradam he says watch it remember when Martin was here and uh Martin was in prayer and suddenly right before him stands the Lord Jesus Christ he says do you know how many people would be deceived by that in this hour he says but Martin thoughts on the word and being a part of the word he look at this person standing before him he notice he doesn't have any Crown he notice the way he's talking and he says you claim to be Jesus Christ and ask me to Bow Down and Worship You why should I do that the scripture says we will worship we will crown him at the end of these ages and you already have a crown on your head all of a sudden it's gone disappeared why it was the devil with an impersonation all right so so now we see that same Spirit of the devil is coming to that place where they're you're going to hear them start talking about it they're starting to see this and they're starting to see that because they've entered into wishcraft what they're going to get what they're wishing for right so now uh they wish to see the Prophet come back you wish to see it oh the devil can provide you with that kind of a thing too if you want to see that amen my goodness you might even see him walking in some of their meetings my that would be a real sensation even a prophet endorsing me oh my they seen the prophet in that brother's meeting absolutely yeah but you watch carefully and let the Holy Spirit give you some discernment by the word of God amen amen yes sir and there are many that are encouraging people to go this way right they're encouraging people to actually get into that stuff where they worship the prophet where they baptizing his name where they pray in his name and and they hold brother brandham almost not almost in many cases higher than they hold the Lord Jesus that's true absolutely many of them do that right praise God devil says devil will turn to your mind now and says see you in a cult this messages because that's what he's trying to do he wants to mess up the message the real message but the real believer that's why the prophet said when you get the real Revelation no matter what the devil throws what muck what mud what unbelief whatever you are going right down the center with that back sight lined up with the front sight amen and you're hit the target every time for the glory of God Old Testament New Testament the words of sermon as a prophet and Bible backs it up praise God you're right on target with the word of God hallelujah amen yes sir praise God hallelujah so let's let let's pray for these kind of people right when you meet them don't let that discourage you but recognize the word already identified that they're going to be here all kinds of people's going to be inside of it you're going to meet all kinds of things you're going to hear all kinds of things but is you see most people don't understand that God is not watching so much what the other person did to you what the other person said or how they said it God is sitting back and watching your reaction amen Prophet said action for reaction is that right he said they're going to pay Prophet said they're going to pay for what they did but you better watch right watch how you act what you say Amen praise God so let's pray for them right amen that's always the answer is best to pray don't say pray right praise God now if you notice I'm ending this now if you not notice that woman was not punished because Saul had had a law saying any witch she should be killed right but in this case the woman was not killed we don't know her story we don't know if later on she now come to believe yes there is a real prophet and uh this is different than what is happened with me and now this is a real prophet and commit her life to God we don't know but clearly praise the Lord Jesus amen amen hallelujah my and let me let me just quote here this woman was not punished for being doing the work of a witch because she was deceived by the preacher Saul right she was deceived by the preacher Saul who told her like the serpent told Eve you shall not surely die that same Spirit of Deceit came down and work with her now you say why did you preach this sermon uh here today uh brother Simon why did you speak on this amen I I spoke on it to show how that Spirit has now invaded the message we know it's invaded the church world and everything else but I'm particularly focused it's invaded this message and you are supposed to watch for it right amen recognize it whether it's in sermons you see on the internet or your voices you hear uh coming from great uh leaders in the in the message soal you just always test everything by the word don't just say oh this brother has a big reputation in the message and you just swallow every message that he preached no doesn't work that way individually you got to taste and see right for yourself in every way God bless them all in the great work they're doing and everything else that spirit is now in the message and most of the times you find that a lot of the preachers are scrambling now to manufacture something because the prophet isn't here now to give them revelation he's not to give them musicians you can come along he's not here to give them inspiration and we all got inspiration off of his message and still are getting inspiration off of his messages but once you start getting a direct communication between you and God something goes on that's totally different it it it comes with direct communication that brings you back and show you this is what he was thinking about when he was preaching this message this is what he he was going to say you sometimes you know it before you even read it right because the holy spirit is now here revealing his word to his own people praise the name of the Lord hallelujah it's wonderful isn't it thank you it's always nice to come and talk with you because you are willing to hear this I don't want to be beaten up yeah because there places I've been where people even the preacher gets so mad just crawling across the pews running down the aisle to bring down the hammer and everything else like that and the spirit of God has to step in so God is God and it's not easy especially when sometimes God uses you to say things that have not been said have not yet been said and they don't want to see it or believe it and then when they do believe it they s burst in asham they wouldn't come back and say brother you were right they just go out and they preach it and like as if they always had that none of us have anything anyway cuz I don't have no particular Revelation It All Belongs to him am it's only when you come to Mortal realm people want to patent this and patent that put their name on it and they didn't make anything because I mean they just sit there and all of a sudden they get an idea they don't even ask where it come from and then they draw and put it out there oh I I invented this this yeah right see so pray praise God I'm going to stop now because now um if I continue talking like that I go off into all kinds of things that's no more in the message praise God then you're going to say oh yeah I see he's getting old now so he's drifting off God bless you all take care this is the evening time it's later than you take the bride is prepared for the all things are ready right
