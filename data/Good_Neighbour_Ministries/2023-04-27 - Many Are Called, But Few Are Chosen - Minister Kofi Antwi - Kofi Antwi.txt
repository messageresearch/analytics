our God is good if God is good to you then you have to praise him your mouth don't have to be zipped you have to praise the Lord you know how many people didn't wake up this morning even in balancing here do you know how many people could not even lift off their hands they couldn't even open their mouth they have maybe millions of dollars but the amount can open and if God has opened your mouth if God has brought you here and he says praise the Lord then you want to put a zip on your mouth what's the matter with you praise Jesus I am a man that I when I come here let me tell you you have to Praise Jesus because let me tell you if you don't know him look what he have done for you he has done so much in your life my life if it was not for Jesus where would I be if it is not for him where would you be somewhere else could have been drug added as a sister some prostitutes some whatever thiefs some will be killed and all kinds of things could have because the grace of God has watch over race so when you come here you will pray that gift don't look at me Look Away to Jesus when you look away to Jesus you pull the gift God will do as Pride to you for you to know that he's alive some of us sometimes we don't get blessings because God when we come to his presence the culture has bound us and we don't want to praise him but God wants us to get loose this is the hour God need your praise this is the hour God need your worship this is the hour you have to shout and praise him because he's he is his spirit is moving he's moving if you have spiritual eye to know him you can see that his spirit is moving moving in Good Neighbor moving around the world so you want to do things in your life all the cultural things that the world has put families the system has put on us God wants to Shake it up Shake It Out up rip all of it so that when we come here we could lift up our hearts and praise him Praise Jesus because he is good the Lord is good the Lord is good blessed be the name of the Lord that's the appetite please be a okay I'm sorry let us get into the word straight uh I forgot to give you the title but I'm gonna speak on many a call but few are chosen so you can use that as a background of what I'm going to speak and we will tend to Matthew 22 Matthew 22 14. and we'll read Romans chapter 9 Romans 9 verse 9 to 18. that will be the scripture but my background will be many are called few are chosen uh brother can you come here and pray pray leaders in prayer before we open the way whatever just stand there and pray amen yes Lord hear me amen amen God is good okay Matthew chapter 22 14 many are called but few are chosen then we turn to Romans 9 verse 9 okay for this is the way of promise at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son and not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one you see the Lord when Jacob and Esau were in the womb they were twins right but the Lord only looked by what one because he seed even by sorry okay by one even by Our Father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither have done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election Must Die not of works but of him that calling it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I love but Esau have I hated what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God God forbid for he said unto Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion so then it is not of him that Willy nor of him that run it but of God that show Mercy for that for the scripture said unto pharaoh even for this same purpose have I raised thee up that I my show my power indeed and that my name might be declared throughout all the Earth therefore had he Mercy on whom he will have mercy and he whom he will he hide in it may the Lord add his Blessing please everyone be seated thanks be to the Lord our God is good because God knows his children that he has chose even when we came to this world we came with the seed of godliness because anything that the Lord does is not just now that we are here that is going to do it he has it's a finished work that salvation is what a Finnish work if you have it you have it before you came to this world God knew that while we are here the enemy will be here because he was cast down to the Earth this so he will be here and because we are born into as I was saying cultural the family they teach us how to behave how to do things according to the world that we are in but God knows all that and most of the things they teach us is contrary to his word is contrary to God's word so God don't wait for us to be here before he says I choose Danny I choose uh brother Brian and I live Philip no God has already chooses he has already chosen us predestinated as and he knows when we were up there Lucifer took one third of the Angels down to the air and we that stood for him he has already chosen us and sent us here and he know who will come to him and who wouldn't come to him he don't wait for us to be here before he make that decision the decision has already been made that's why salvation we can never give it to anybody I'm not here to bring a new message I'm just repeating what God has used our beloved Pastor to preach to us God is repeating to us so that it will sink down into our heart because the Bible says every seed must bring forth his kind so it's a repeating like when you have a children the child when you tell them oh don't go here they always go here they'll always go the place you said they shouldn't go but you have to keep on repeating repeating repeating even when you get old and die one day the things you have said to them they will remember it will come back to them so you see God the scripture said we shouldn't forsake the assemblies in the presence of God we shouldn't forsake but how many people are forsaking right how many people forsake the house of God so God sometimes go back repeating to us repeating to us repeating to us because you know what the culture has hooked us and the world has spook us that we are so attached to the world but God wants us to be attached to him God wants us to be attached to him more than the world because the world can never give you anything anything that have beginning have an ending so let me tell you if you are living with anything that I have beginning one of these days you're gonna have an end when you were coming here the only thing you brought was the seed if you are one of his bride the seed of God that you brought here apart from that that's the thing you are going with everything your I see have beginning have an end so trust in God because he has already prophesied it he says many are called but few are chosen if you are chosen and even you don't have one cent in your pocket you have to rejoice you have to praise him you have to thank him you have to worship him you have to honor him because look at the world right now we are about eight billion eight billions of humanity Naturally Speaking and you God looked down that eight billion and choose you he saw that 8 billion before we were in Ed reaching 8 billion he have already seen it God is not man that or he waits until the 8 billion he knows all people that will come to the Earth he knows at the end everything and yet God has chose you God has chose you it's not by words he saw he was before even Jacob was in his mother womb God said I love Jacob I hate Esau even he told pharaoh anything Pharaoh was going to do he thought he was smart you're gonna chase the Israelites with them slave them do all kinds of things but God said for this purpose that I might I have raised you up Pharaoh even what Pharaoh was fulfilling was fulfilling God's purpose so you you came here for a purpose what purpose are you gonna fulfill because the scriptures said many are called few are chosen are you one of the chosen one this is the hour when Christ is displaying himself in the 5-4 ministry around the world on Gentile Nations because the time has come whether we like it or not even natural economy and the way the world is is telling you that everything is winding up to fulfill we've seen it it's playing before our own eye is playing before you don't need a computer or anything to know just watch your news let's turn the news is playing before you the scriptures are fulfilling right what side are you playing what side are you gonna stand are you gonna stand with Jesus or are you gonna attach to the world because the things of Sodom is the things of the world which people will act are attaching themselves at this hour into I am not saying we shouldn't work we should not uh I mean drive car or buy house or eat or wear clothes yes you need all those things but anything that will take you away from Jesus Christ is of the devil and you have to let it go straightforward you have to let that thing go so that Christ may have preeminence over your body over your soul over your mind over your heart so that he will project himself in you because this our Christ is serious he wanted to possess his own that bride he wanted to possess us so that the world may know that this Bible is not just written pen and ink only or just what brother Brahm spoke gonna be in the books and we're gonna cut it back and forth and slap us with our face or with our uh all that we know and we call it the word of God no God wants you to fulfill that word God wants that word to be alive when Pastor Simon got two books two books he had two books he's sitting here two books that two books if he couldn't have eaten it became his his heart bitteness but he hold up and says no matter what is the truth I'm gonna let this word of God project possess me that's our God is calling us I want her to possess you I wanted to demonstrate my my wedding you it's not just gonna be in a book form no sir no sir Simon since he's here we that I repeat has been here long no the power of God we have seen it we are eyewitness that God was using him mightily we that's why we are here otherwise none of us will be sitting here all of us we used to go to some of us churches or parties or or oh my all kinds of places but the grace of God has come to you he has paid the price the Baton is now on your hands the Baton is now on your head because Eagles let me tell you when your your father feed you feel you feel you and you'll be coming so puffy like that a time will come that your father will say no son no it's your time to eat go and look for your own food otherwise you are born bastard bastard son no sir Eagles you eat what you eat a Time come you're projected you let it come alive you let the people see that yes this is what you have been eating all the time for 30 years I've been under Pastor Simon 31 years or so going almost 32 if let's say naturally if I was going to school from grade one to get PhD let me tell you didn't I appeared PhD already so how long are you gonna train me to know the word of God how long does some of us God have to beg us drag us before we come to his presence how long we still going to be babies 30 years people want to be babies they won't make they don't want to eat the meat because when you either make you become bitterness in your heart but in your lips it becomes thicker yes sir the word of God is real it's not he just wanted to be a book he wanted to be you you the word one take you to become the word in flesh so that the people when they see you they are seeing your father who is your father the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ because when he was here he has told us in the word he said I am he that was dead end of my life forever more how would the people know Jesus is Alive by your testimony by Your Word by your manifestation on the word of God the people who know that Christ is alive Christ is resurrected because to the world Jesus Is Dead even to the denomination they just talk about Jesus Jesus they don't they never seen the power of God so many people in the message they know the cause but they never seen the power of God one time in their life Christ said no if I'm in you if the Same Spirit that raise up Jesus Christ from the dead dwell in you he shall also Quicken your mortal body he will do the same thing let me tell you our Christ is not a dead God One Pastor someone demonstrate the word of God he don't demonstrate the word of look at his age when he's Tanya preaching don't you see the power of God he looked like 16 years God boy with a word of God I tell you if you put me in the grip and put oxygen for me and he is preaching I will and I hear his voice I will know that that voice comes from heaven it doesn't come from man let me tell you God has used him mightily but I'm afraid so many of us we are playing with jokes yes sir I'll tell us it is uh listen when it comes to the word of God listen me I'm not scared of no man because Jesus let me tell you the places he has taken me only him alone know only him sometime even government I remember Gaddafi signature have to come and move to get me out from jail in Libya I I don't know how I like I will come out but God the Mighty God the God that I know now it was him that brought me out one time I was deep deep sleep I have no money God wake me up midnight I was sleeping at 12 flip and Desmond that house Stone was all around very dark in African area and the spirit of God I didn't know wake me up walk I'm walking hello I don't know nobody in that place I walk that voice led me straight to a man who was a soldier that I used to punish his shoe and he gave me money to go back to Nigeria a lot of money and during that time within three months I was in Germany let me tell you I'm not scared of nothing me God no I'm telling you this I'm not scared of nothing only him only him it will lead me only Jesus Will Lead Me no man will lead me I respect I respect my pastor respected because I respect every single one of you but let us shake off the dust and worship Christ the Mighty God let us come face to face in reality because if Pastor someone didn't come face to face let me tell you what I came to the church I count the numbers 17. the congregation was 17 I counted it that time I've been here long and I know I've seen what God has done I see what God I may not able to quote the prophet message this that that backwards forward like as my brothers called blessed be the name of the Lord as they call it I love it I love you Brothers but let me tell you a greater than Solomon he's the only one we have to praise he's the only one we have to worship he's the only one we have to lift him up Pastor Simon has demonstrated the gospel to my soul and it has become so real to me that even if he's not here today brother I give God all the praise for what you are free to me let me tell you I am so setting what is in me will lead me back to Jesus Christ I am so certain if he's not here wherever you put me whether perfect weather streak where the corner is able to do the job the word of God that he has placed in my heart it will do the job I have confidence my confidence is not in a man our confidence shouldn't be in a man we have to respect we have to honor where God is hiding where God is moving and be serious and get the word out so that God will have preeminence in our life that even when we we go our children if the Lord is telling not coming then we said my father my mother was a true Christian you think Pastor someone children who know they know Grace Mike Michelle they know that your father wasn't drunk with the gospel look at brother babe who witnessed to him Pastor someone sang Mike saw him says come to my father why even though he doesn't see him here he have he know what was in his father let me tell you but someone is our father and let me say this not because he's sitting here every time I'm going to Africa he's sitting here question I said brother I'm going sometimes he tell me and I tell him where I'm going he says you go and take the word and slap the people the intellectual doors that God wanted to speak to and exactly you tell me happy I know this message is real this message is real it's not joke it's reality but people we want to pray jokes jokes won't do it because we think we can cut that message we know the prophet Message In and Out by letter form quoting is that no say his time will get serious we got serious on the word when we get serious let me tell you God will move Hillary will take place in the Bible check the Lord says his children they'll be going to streets and begging bread get on back God's children does not dead God may bring you out poor but let me tell you if you surrender it may take yes it may take a month but the time God has set for you you make a way you make a way let me tell you he will make a way if you are not seeing him making a way that means you are short of something or he is trying you let me tell you sometimes stubbornness whole less backwards but God is saying my sin will never return unto me void my seed will accomplish what I send for when brother Brown was here the word saw the power of God this day the churches must say churches a lot of them are not seeing the power of God no more because they have pushed the word out they put the Holy Spirit out even in the message they've put a great Holy Spirit out Christ himself is out all they have is called back and forth God by where is the word that have to open to the people the word that was set the people free the word that will let the people know that Jesus is alive he's real he's not dead He's Alive let me call you when the world is in you you don't fear nothing the church even can put you out because they did to Jesus they don't want Jesus they don't want Jesus the storm that the building refusing became the head of the corner right that was Christ that was Christ and it's the same thing going through the messages in the prophet is here you think they were accepting so many churches who are accepting because of what they want to be big trust listen me I don't care even if my pastor tell me coffee step down Don't Preach I will obey I don't care I'm not here for popularity me popularity is helped out of my life because the Bible tells me playing Jesus there was no Beauty he was the most ugly person that have ever been on Earth but inside him was the beauty in the world have never seen when he speak and that's the way our life supposed to be that's the way we have to be so that God can get the glory he came like that by disguising himself so that he could come to you he could let you know look at what he have done for us the same voice was speaking to Moses the same voice was in William Abraham the same voice is speaking to you even in the message how many you think are receiving what we are receiving here they know the cause I've met so many people even preachers Philip know one friend one time I was telling him I said when you eat this message it becomes bitter in your belly but it's sweeter in your mouth the brother says if you hear the bitters then you can be a child of God you'll be a bastard son I said you are right then why continue fellowshipping access to him for me I love my pastor I'd love to be under my pastor Ministry oh brother I don't want nobody to control me you see you see the spirit how he has projected himself he don't want to be subject lot of people think they stay home they listen to the tape they don't want leadership even you but they will go to work and the work they have for my they are managers they have sometimes they have CEO if they are educated all kinds of levels and they control their life they tell them today you can't go home because we are busy I'm not saying we shouldn't work take it spiritually okay and they will stay and work but when they come to the house of God when the pillow fire is moving God is making his way to know and they do something audio like God want to ship it they don't want it they don't want it but because of the ability I call them ballet Christian like it's all like uh Judas because of his belly what you eat and just two minutes go to the washroom and all gone he loved that he loved that more than the word of God the word of God should be our priority the word of God should be our absolute the word of God should be the one we love more than anything if not so then get out and go and do what you want to do but if God be God serving if the Lord be Lord you that are watching me on the uh on on the program let me tell you if you are staying home not because you are you came late from work or you are sick or maybe you are too old you and you can't be here I'll say to you shame unto you come to the house of God don't sleep come to the presence of God why are you gonna be fat by staying home let me tell you God wants you to be in his presence when he created Adam and took one of Adam's ribs and made Eve he used to come and talk to them the cooling of the day God himself used to preach to them but when sin became in their heart they took leave to cover themselves they don't want to be in the presence of God no more that is what is happening and Lord don't want to be in the presence of God no more because what they have least covering themselves but God is saying Shake It Off as a child of God check it out this is not legalistic preaching let me tell you I'm not a legalistic preacher but I tell you what God placed in my heart I will speak I'll speak I don't care all I care that Jesus gathered Glory only Jesus because I don't know when my time on Earth I'm gonna be finished and the seed in me is the only thing I came to this welfare and when I'm coming I the Lord brought me along he didn't brought me with so many people he brought me along on Earth I come alone I'll go back hello and as as matter of fact what did Jesus say told me in the bed I'll take one and leave one right he says junk as we are individuals we are not bodies or Nation like he's right where you call tribe together like that we are individuals so I have only my taking a long going the word in me is my talking I'm going with that Holy everything I'm living it here and this is the hour God is saying pull yourself into his presence because the time has come can't you see he's moving in the Firefall Ministry through the word he's coming moving that's one preached Christ Donnie preached Christ Temple preached Christ flip preach Christ Christopher preach Christ in different form of himself going out past the salmon and talk about it because it's through him the cake was given to him at the age of 12 years he started seeing the cake and that cake he has divided it for us and I have my passion that portion is coming out Danny's of his portion I may be the least in the king of all the brothers that preach you see my preaching is different my preaching is not like Danny like Philip like Christopher like Desmond all like even Glory but let me tell you if you check inside you'll get nuggets there's nuggets inside for you to eat if you eat that nuggets you'll never be get angry you'll never be hungry because the power of God is inside because it's portion of the fivefold ministry I've gone to places and I said it even here in Toronto one time I was at work and my boss came doing something which was not right and God let me spoke something just came out from my lips and he was his pulse I didn't mean to do that it just came out even I wanted to say something and all of a sudden the word just come come out and he himself what was hidden in him was exposed one of the guy that was working there that time he was a Pentecostal like brother Danny let's say brother and that Pastor Simon call Pastor still here and he says coffee when one day I become I have my own church I'm gonna call you to preach I says get away from me do you know that thing came to pass God let that thing came to pass he was so entrusted for what he saw God did that let me tell you when he became a preacher in a church he even wanted to ask me he says if the congregation wouldn't mind you I have a friend on television who preach I'm gonna take you there because what he saw the power of God made manifest let me tell you the word that Pastor Samuel has been preaching to us I am eyewitness he does the job I said he does the job for me he does the job I'm not scared not because I'm praising him all this if you think I'm praising him that's all right I'm praising Jesus because God hid in that skin God hid in that skin well listen do you know it's hard even in the message to find solid preacher people are thinking it's Pentecostal no moving through the message the message has become message out of the message the life is coming up so you need that life that is coming out from the message and that is what God has given to us and people are playing with it you play with the fire the fire will burn you that fire that is in Pastor John Simon has transformed himself into five four ministry right here right here and moving and is projecting himself to the congregation it's not because Dan is so powerful tembia is so powerful there's no power for your Christopher or Desmond or me coffee or Philip or even call it no is God I said is Jesus is Jesus because he has chosen many are called few are chosen because the children not yet born the Lord says I love Jacob I hate Israel and yet when Jacob came to the world don't you know you are Jacobs you're not sitting here don't you know check your life is Jacob if you are a seed of God is Jacob if you are not see then you are like the certainty then that's all right because every check there's three class of people but I'm preaching to the seed of God the seed that type Jacob Jacob see is the Original Seed it comes Faith he came from Christ he's going back to where Christ you came from Christ you're going back to Christ so love the word of God more than anything read the prophet message you that can read read it eat it let me tell you this one is sitting here that's more lawful more than any natural food that's more love Fufu more than any natural food why and I know him I live with him for a long time he will make his food with all kinds of soup you know how to cook our food let me tell you even Sometimes women eat their crying because they says wow this brother know how to cook good let me tell you as you eat natural food so must you eat the spiritual food as you eat Natural Food Eat the spiritual food the Third if you can't read better like me put it on on your car put it on when you are sleeping brother Brown paid put it on the day that you don't get a chance to be in the service it doesn't matter the brother preaching pour that uh go into that website Good Neighbor Ministry listen to that message okay listen to it as you eat so you become let's say when you born and your father and mother didn't give you food you think like you will grow and be what you are being and be a natural person some of us grow like me like this no I will die menstruation will kill you as a matter of fact you go on the TV you will see some African countries Wars and problems so many are dying with menstruations because they can't get food to eat you understand you want to stab yourself God kitchen there's no shortage of food God's teaching always have all kinds you have Italian food Ghana food Greek food India food all kinds of food that we eat in the world is in God's kitchen is in this way it's it is wet so whatever is good for you pick it and eat it but I tell you the truth when you eat it it will be sweeter in your mouth better in your belly that's why brother some people don't want to come to church they want to play half-hearted because it's so better sometimes let me tell you as I stand here talking is so sweet sometimes it's so bitter in my mouth and I said what is this but at the end it do me good and it will do you good don't be afraid don't be afraid do you know when you eat this message so much sometimes it bring quora between you and your wife and kids because they are young they want their way and you are telling them by Grace not legalistics the old days are gone the old days of legalistics are gone you are telling them as God is showing you because the time where babe we used to speak like babes but this time we have grown up we speak like growing up person so we we give them a little bit of God's word then it's like you are at war with them Oh Daddy you talk so much ah you are too religious all this that we all go through they want their way but sometimes like me God will say shut up let me do the work or even talk just keep yourself away you watch me I'll do the job it's not your job let me do it for you just worship me just give me praise don't compromise stay with the word and I will do the job and let me tell you if you do like that God will let the word manifest in your life that today or tomorrow when let's say the Lord has taken you they will talk about you did your children gonna talk about you they're gonna talk you'll think Pastor someone sitting there his children is not here if I'm not saying no God forbid that won't happen if it's gone tomorrow his case gonna talk about him a lot they're gonna talk they are seeing the power of God in that house so much all those memories gonna come back to them gonna come back to them let me tell you one time I used to drive what they see I didn't have money we're coming to church man cow or smoke in on the back we have to stop on the highway and above my head I say Lord I need a car that umbrella Christopher was driving the Odyssey and I know that I need a van and I says Lord I need a van and right away my sample says Ah that you two you told him too much because he knows it's hard for us that time and I said to him Paul let me tell you the god I said there's nothing short in him my God gonna give me the advance too much I just keep my mouth short the next day I said it's Sunday Monday the same car I call him I says Paul I'm bringing the car home and you know I have no money when I went to buy the car that's where you buy his car I led Eugene to that man I I'm walking and the Holy Spirit was leading me just moving me from the street to the car I have no money in my pocket and my wife says where are you going I says just quiet follow me and he follow because I don't want interference and why I was going there the man came out he says sir do you do you like the car I say yes you want to buy it I say yes says come on in I my wife says but we don't have the money I said keep your mouth shut let's go inside and it was quiet because when holy spirit is moving like that you give a little Gap Satan will move I was not trying to tell her to I'm saying like that to her but I want the Holy Spirit to do his work and we went in the guy says how much you gonna put down believe me my credit card has run out I didn't know I said I pay 1 000. I don't have even that thousand in my pocket but it just came from my mouth one thousand that guy says okay the car was almost 12 000 that time it says okay bring your credit card I bring my cardiac credit you check he says he doesn't qualify I says that car is mine that car is mine I'm going home with that car the guy look at me what kind of talk is this he looked at me he says do you know anybody that can help you sign for you I says I don't know anybody he says you sure he says you have a wife and says my wife is sitting here he says okay bring your card he bring my wife God he run it he says remain two thousand with a thousand you put on two thousand then you guys cover that car I says you are now talking because that car is mine do you know he says you can't find nobody to give

car the guy believed me speaking like that the guy that was selling the car put his own two thousand dollars and give me the car that's why UJ has bought car from him his father has bought car from him I took Yuji to him Eugene older man and I got that car what is that by faith if we are surrendered to unto the Lord we are not going to be shocked of anything nothing we're going to be fed as the Lord wants he gonna Prosper us as we follow him God's children doesn't beg they don't go and beg okay we are number one in his eye we are number one in his heart all God desire is his children should worship Him if we worship Him whatever we need he will give it to us according to his word but many a times we let Tommy blocks come in front of us and the road becomes so hard by worshiping God by praising him by putting him first but let me tell you God if you worship God you have to go through prosecution if you scared of prosecution don't worship God and go your way because look into the Bible all the prophet the sons of Gods that went before us they all suffer prosecution and you are not obligated to go out you are going to face prosecution if you scared of that let me tell you just look at Africa Libya go watch the news there's some people crossing to brother down in your old country Italy you know how many die last year over 400 and something died but still that doesn't stop people to go because they determine to go there to change their life their natural life some of them when they are going there says if I perish let me perish and they really perish underwater some make it and your life change the gospel that the Lord has given to us you have to make up your mind if I perish let me perish with the gospel let me perish I'm not just talking listen this gospel Let Me Tell You Only God know me better than anybody here it has gripped my heart and they're not able to cut cut it of bringing the way proper way no no no no listen God give me one stone that's all right I'm gonna stay with that stone that word he has given me if it is five words that will slay Goliath I'm Gonna Keep It like I was preaching in Jungle and one nine years girl came to me I never forget he says brother when you were preaching you said Jesus Christ is God and Heaven on that there's no name whereby we will be saved only Jesus name when I go he says that that's what I come to you to baptize me When Heaven though is hoping Jesus name is on me and I'm going there with that name says I can't read and write but I'm going there I'm keeping that name in my heart and I'm going there when Heaven door is open nine years girl God is my witness he told to me like this in prison of people says I'm going there with that name what about you and I God by his grace has poured himself so much so much that we take it for granted everything we don't want to come to the house of God but we are chosen if you are charging you better come and take your medicine there's a medicine for you that medicine is not sweet it's better but come and take it some people they want sweet sweet honey you know children they want to be children always they love candy they sweet candy the chocolate that is bitter there's some chocolates they are so bitter you don't want to even eat it but that chocolate is good for the kids that bitter chocolate is good that bitter word of God is good for your soul because when you eat it it won't be easy sometimes we bring tears it bring pain and it will bring joy to it will bring prosperity to it will bring the word in your life to let the word manifest then you yourself let me tell you you'll be standing someplace God sometimes even he loved to do that it will take you not even in the church in a corner quiet place or somewhere and display himself when you go out from that place you will save my God lord it will bring tears to you we'll say I can but I can do this I saw this I see this I saw God move and it shocked you you know you don't have that knowledge and God is a yes you see because you take every bitterness every bitterness medicine I gave you you take it so I'm displaying to you that bitterness medicine what it has produced for you a lot of people want to see dead race walk blind scene I'm not blessing my preaching on that that is the the absolute no the absolute is when you have Christ but why we are here we need that it's part of the Gospel like the Lord won't put it in healing is part of the Gospel is part of the Gospel casting out devil is part of the Gospel all those things are good speaking in tongues prophecies all those things are good right but the main focus is on Christ you understand the Bible says this son shall follow that that belief in my name they will cast out what devils and if they eat any deadly thing it shall not add them somebody tried to poison you you didn't know don't hurt you because you know why the spirit of God is light it will cast that devil out many are called few are chosen at the day of Pentecost when the pillar of fire came down did you saw Judas was part of it on the pillow fire setting on their head no because even though he had all the calls like a lot of people they know all the prophet quotes they know all the Bible quotes but if they are not chosen they won't go in the rapture because the Rapture will vindicate the true bride the few that are chosen before we live here God will come and make himself manifest through us and show us and declares to the people and let them know he's with us the Lord does not hide because anything when they make a car when the car is finished it goes showroom right for everybody to see that car they look at it before they buy when they build a house their brother in the cell house the real estate people they're going with their customers and let me tell you Brian is sitting here when I was buying house the way even he checked the house I was my God is that how the brother looked the house even I would say oh brother it's okay let's he says no no no no no brother we eat check and Shake everything is good and you understand that is the way it is the gospel we are coming to an end that God will declare the chosen ones the few in the hidden in the message he's starting to prove himself he's starting it showing us even myself look at me I never thought I'll be standing here preaching I'll never talk I'll be standing in the congregation but listen it doesn't matter God said so now 24 hours I'm not afraid you put me to preach all our gold corner for a few minutes seconds I say Lord you know I don't know I don't know what to say I don't know how to do things my Lord take control whatever West you come in my mouth I am so excited as him I am going to end I know it's five minutes to nine I'll end up exactly three minutes tonight so don't be quiet the Lord is good thank you Pastor Simon for the job you have done in me God has used you I appreciate it I thank you so much from the bottom of my heart let me tell you your preaching if it was not the way you surrender your life to God for God to use you for me I I would love to be in the grave God knows my heart many times I wanted to commit suicide nobody know like my wife won't know but God use pastor to raise me up bit by bit Lift Me Up things that was on my heart no man could answer me nobody could answer me but this brother who is our beloved pastor but I thank you from the bottom of my heart thank you God has used you for me if not anybody in the world for me I thank you because you have done the work for my life a man who can read and write who born in Africa jungle that God's grace has brought me up to here and I thank the Lord that's my end of preaching brother come and lead a song whatever God placed in your heart many are called but few are chosen the way the Lord placed in my life that's what I says forgive me for my broken rest but that's the way God wanted amen thank the Lord for his word tonight amen I'm an
