giving god all the praise the honor and the glory uh i i heard you had a wonderful service uh on sunday and we give god thanks and praise and we honor his great name for what he is doing here in the church remember god always hides in simplicity praise the lord and the simpler it seems it's the more you ought to recognize what brother branham said he said god moved so simply he said that if you're not watching it'll pass right by you and you won't even recognize it amen so we want to thank god for his great and wonderful works that he's doing here among us to him we all praise and honor and glory hallelujah god bless you real good i want to thank god for every one of you represented here and i trust god will just bless us all as we get together like this tonight we will read two scriptures and genesis chapter 3 verses 6 to 7. then we will read zechariah chapter 4 verses 1 to 7 genesis 3 6-7 and then zechariah 4 1 to 7 praise the lord let us pray and let us look into the word of god our gracious heavenly father we are together again i'm so happy to be here with the children of god god's family we ask lord god your blessing upon us and father you know why i'm standing here to teach the word to bring forth more understanding of what you are doing in this hour and in this time may the great holy spirit lord sweep across our soul by the opening of the inspired word of god bless us we pray tonight father and may the word of god make itself clear to us in jesus name we ask it amen and amen genesis 3 and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also hunter husband with her and he did eat amen and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sowed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons zechariah now four one to seven and the angel the talk with me came again and waked me as a man that is awakened out of his sleep and said unto me what thou see what's his thou and i said i have looked and behold a candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps they're on and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and two olive trees by it one up on the right side of the bowl and the other up on the left side thereof so i answered and spake to the angel that talk with me saying what are these my lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knows thou not what these be and i said no my lord and he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the lord unto zero bells saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts who art thou o great mountain before the rubber bell thou shalt become a plane and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying grace grace grace unto it praise god hallelujah may god bless our hearts please be seated as far as the reading of his word and i i just want to take uh a topic is uh of don't act prematurely let us not act prematurely uh don't act before the time that something is supposed to happen and allow god to do his work in his time not in our time or in our feelings or because we get enthused or inspired but allow god to do his work and to move by his spirit like that now i'm saying that because we have come through the years of hearing the word uh recognizing the word we heard the word and we didn't even really understand what we were hearing but something in in our hearts was bearing record that that was thus said the lord we we know it's the truth down in the man on the inside but this up here it was not connected and we could not recognize what we were hearing but as the years as time passed then in god's season when he was ready for us to know when it is time for us to know then we suddenly start to recognize some things in the message in the word in the bible even though we read it so many times but then when the r has come for god's day star to shine upon us then we begin to recognize certain things not that we didn't hear them before not that we didn't hear them preached or said or anything like that but all of a sudden they start to take on a different dimension they start to take on a different presence and power because god's time for that activity had now come on the scene and so the word began to break the day began to dawn the rising of the sun began to take place and the word of god began to make itself clear to the people as the clouds of fog and doubt and fear begin to move away we had to go through years of delusions and illusions and fantasies and all kinds of things because right within the message they're all kinds of religious spirits all kinds of devils of all kinds of doctrines [Music] under the guise of men of god and jesus spoke of this christ all anointed man will arise and say here is christ this is the word here is christ there is the word over there you'll find him there is the word that's what it is and begin to say these three to you but don't you get moved by that stay right in the middle and let the holy spirit lead you and guide you to the perfect light so we come through hearing then we come to the years of recognition a connection began to come between what we her had heard and what we are hearing something begin to register about recognizing what we heard and what we were hearing praise the lord oh my you begin to be able to discern uh between right and wrong between good and evil you begin to discern big what god wants even though it may be true but is that what god wants for this hour you begin to recognize present truth the word of god has applied to this time until this hour praise the lord just as it was with uh luther wesley any class you can't go back and take those words or those things that they had and try to apply it now not that they were false not that it wasn't true but that was for that time it's not to apply to this time hallelujah and even if we use it we use it in its rightful place like apples of silver and pinches of gold amen uh apples of gold and pitches of silver we know how to apply the word we know when to apply the word and so we have come to our as our brother preached to a maturity of the word where we know what to eat and what to spit out what meat to eat and what cherry seeds to just spit it out we know exactly what to invite take in hallelujah and no contaminated food is acceptable to the bride of jesus christ hallelujah now i'm just going to begin now to really uh talk to you praise the lord now uh the time has come now when we are we have arrived where if you're spiritual you know it's the time for acting it's time for the word to come alive it's time for the living word to carry out the acts of the spirit amen hallelujah now the the body has to do that the body of christ has to do that fulfill the word it's alpha it's omega is that right it just what paul had is what the prophet preached and what was back there comes here again because the church edge is coming between and just like that praise god but one is here and the other is here these two olive trees are right there alpha and omega and a one has to come back to the other one amen the word has got to be restored which it has been and the bright tree restored back to its fullness as it was and we know that it is praise the lord so we are here in the time of acting but you see what i'm talking about tonight not because we know we ought to manifest the word or act on the word that we should act prematurely or we should run ahead of the world because that will be you and i trying to do it it's you and i trying to do god a service but not doing his perfect will you see we now as the bride of jesus christ as in the if i use a figure or illustration from the bible it's like ruth who is already in the field amen she was harvesting but the time came we where she's harvesting but that harvesting is going on but she's really now in a state of waiting right ruth was waiting waiting so here she is waiting praise god and she couldn't do anything until boaz comes on the scene and boaz as the head ship when he came on the scene all the other things just kicked in and began to take place because of him and his presence hallelujah that's what i'm talking about that we are not to act prematurely on the word of god but let the holy spirit bring in these things in his time and in his season for his glory don't let's run ahead of god you know there's people love to run ahead and then they act and think that they know what they're doing then when they don't know what they're doing they turn back and start asking you or or or something like that but don't run ahead just wait and let god have his way now let's come to scripture cast some more light on this what are you trying to talk about here praise the lord now uh in genesis as we read and as you know god wanted to manifest his word from way back then he wanted to bring the word into flesh on the earth and in his time not in anybody's time or ease time or adam's time but when he was ready he would want he wanted to bring his word into flesh now it's brought into flesh now but a huge long drawn-out process had to take place uh for us to come here and manifest the word of god not through uh a virgin birth but by a redeemed birth we're able to manifest the word of the living god but now eve had the spoken word of god and god and she understood that god wanted to make his word manifest through her but what the serpent did in the garden he came to her and tried to tell her of another way of how she can manifest the lord or bring the word manifest right bring the word in the flesh praise god but you see he tried to actually what he was doing is try to make a creation or make something before god actually did it he was trying to run ahead of god's plan and he used her by convincing her to accept his wisdom rather than to have faith in the spoken word of the living god and so there she was going ahead of god and he was there uh encouraging her to act on the word prematurely uh before god's time right and promising her all manner of promises amen hallelujah now we know and the bible teaches us that eve was actually illegally seeking wisdom or let me put it so that comes now to our time higher learning she was looking for higher learning and thought higher learning would give her another doorway into the wisdom and the knowledge of god of how to manifest the word and we know my friends that she i don't think she understood fully that that was an act of rebellion against the word it was an act of rejection of the word that god had spoken to her absolutely see and by seeking after satan's so-called higher learning or higher wisdom she was an absolute making herself an enemy of god and rejection of his divine word instead of simply accepting the word and that is very much the same thing happens today when you begin to tell somebody about this word it's too simple to them they got to hear something sounds convoluted and really as they think so learn it and so you know you know it's got to be testified to confirm by this person of note or that person and really all satan is doing is making them move their faith around putting it in some learned man some hero some so-called wise man as long as they don't go into the word of god keep them away and keep their minds on men on higher institutions keep their mind on this this is not to say that to have natural wisdom knowledge and learning for natural um survival that we are not to have that that's not what i'm talking about because because we are caught in this we need that to be able to live in the midst of this all these devils and all these things around us we need a lot of that to be able to deal with it is that right so get that in your minds clearly we're not talking about those things paul even knew about that and he was one of the wisest and most learned men of his day said yes that's good i have all that but i still come to dong and ash that i might win christ hallelujah amen because this one you got to spend a lifetime of learning and knowledge and learning and memorization and this and that and this other one i don't have to have nothing except faith in god and his word and all of a sudden the lightning flashes the thunder roll and god's voice can speak through that instrument that predestinated vessel that he had placed there for that purpose and for his glory amen hallelujah so we find out she was prematurely trying to manifest the word without the holy spirit without the holy spirit manifesting that word she want to find another means to manifest that word and satan presented her with the realm of higher learning and wisdom of man amen praise god so there we see it friends that um a natural woman can certainly do that she can certainly bring forth children but we know that all uh of the human race being born of a woman because of genesis 3 and the curse that god placed upon both adam eve and the earth sorry upon eve the serpent and the earth my friends that all born of women will die the bible says that all will die because that's just the natural birth god wanted her to come and give birth to predestinated that will already come with eternal life hallelujah that will live forever but she ran ahead prematurely just to uh let me see if i can manifest this let me see if i could uh do this you know and and god was not in that amen because god already spoke his word praise the lord amen amen so if the natural what's the types now anything the natural woman brings forth naturally will die it's going to get old it's going to get gray-headed it's going to get weak and it's going to die it doesn't matter how many orbs of theology you give it doesn't matter how many higher learning you give it it's going to die amen in the same way denominations which you know the national church church types of women doesn't matter how many are what healthy looking children they bring forth everyone doomed to die because that's not the word of god hallelujah that is not the word of god the word of god is given to the true born-again believer the body of christ the brain for this hour the word comes to her and through her to manifest the word and to bring it to life for the glory of god twins in the beginning twins again in the end we got modern-day twins here upon us children of the denomination and children of the revealed world they're right here with us oh later we will see how isaiah prophesied in that day the womb the the children of the bond woman will desolate woman will be more many times more amen than the married wife amen hallelujah oh my friends you'll see them growing in thousands and thousands it seems so easy for them to set up a church just build a building before united is filled oh it's just taken over like that amen yes sir we see then we must understand or praise god that the rain falls on the just and on the unjust it falls on the denominations and it falls on the people of the revealed world hallelujah i just want you to know that and they are just as happy as you are happy you see like how we come in here and we are seeing the word and we are getting blessed by the word and we want to praise god we want to shout we want to sing hallelujah amen give glory they are just as happy as you are happy because they are certain that what they are hearing is the truth as much as you believe what you are hearing and seeing is the truth so it caused you to rejoice and to praise the living god hallelujah amen but watch no matter what they do they can't change the god's calculations god's pattern hallelujah every seed must bring forth after its kind and therefore no matter of jumping like the ahab's prophets no matter of singing no matter of musical instrument playing no matter what programs they come up with no matter how big they can grow it remains nothing in the eyes of god hallelujah amen yes sir because why because when you go right back to the origin of it they're coming from the wrong seed and as long as it comes from the wrong seed that seed will only continue on and every other seed it produces is the wrong seed every other seed every thousand seeds is still the wrong seed it'll be written burning forth wrong seed forever until the whole thing goes into the lake of fire and that's why the the scripture tells us that if there's any true seed of god inside of their ranks come out of her my people and be not partakers of her plagues it's her sins it's her plagues it's her evil amen don't drink of the cup of the filthiness of a fornication that is what the filthiness of our fornication is our doctrines it's her teaching amen yes sir oh my oh praise god hallelujah so no matter how they're multiplied amen we see whose kind of seed they're after praise god because the seed in them is wrong to begin with quoting brother branham so then we see that all their fleshly demonstration don't mean nothing to god though i speak with the tongue of men and angels great speakers oh and have not charity you don't have the capstone inside of you it profited me nothing though i give all my goods to feed the poor amen though i start a big charitable institution that's feeding thousands every day hundreds of thousands though i can send ships of mercy i can do this i can do that he said that will profit you nothing when you come to the end of the way for you start from the wrong seat to begin with and though i have faith to move mountains and have not cherry it profited me nothing it comes right back to the gene it comes right back to the capstone it comes right back if that's not laid in you my friends no matter how you can have all the faith like brother branham said yeah you can have the holy spirit and still go to hell because the holy spirit is there's anointing your spirit and your flesh but but that's that gene that soul that is inside of there that is not the taking the word of god at all and the word is just running right off of it amen oh my yes sir and if i speak with even i speak with tongues like man and angels it becomes sounding brass in the ears of god and tinkling symbols oh pentecostals that's nothing but a hybrid seed and it can't come to the word of god now of course when i speak like that we're speaking generally that doesn't condemn every pentecostal because we don't know which of god children is still in the pentecostal church we don't know which of god's children are still in the catholic church we don't know who is where that's why we have to throw out the lifeline that's why we have to preach the word that's why we have to testify that's why we have to tell of his goodness and of his mercy that they will recognize who they are and their position for the glory of god hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord now remember this only the body gives birth to christ's body amen and that comes from a virgin womb hallelujah now i won't take up time with that but amen you see the pentecostal denominations could not give spiritual birth to bring forth the manifestations amen i see and the christ also because it was only a sowing rain that they received and so what they brought forth was a denominational church but not the body of christ they did not bring forth him so she consolidated herself with all them other things and evangelicals and so on and now she's gone in the way of cora amen the gain saying of quora praise god so that's what happened without the teaching reign of the prophet's message and ministry all they can do is gain say the word or counteract or contradict the word of god and they contradict the word continuously speaking contrary to the very word that she claims to believe but she's speaking contrary to the word hallelujah oh my friends i tell you i am so happy that uh though god opened up his word and caused me to be able to see believe understand and walk in the light for this day and for this hour hallelujah amen you see eve went out and bore fruit she got a son but it was strange fruit it was strange to the word of god it just could not fulfill the word no matter how he tried he couldn't fulfill the word because this gene the seed was not in him and he couldn't do it no matter how he tried but we still have to test give the word test to know what's hiding where and what is here what is over there but if we don't give the word test out we won't get back any action for reaction to know what is going on around us hallelujah so we constantly have to do that amen hallelujah because when you look at that fruit from off of that tree it's not a word fruit that will bring forth a word seed and you know that that's wrong to begin with absolutely wrong to begin with oh my praise god let me jump over some things here now he's gone over here to you know adam and eve points to christ and to the church and you know the u.s dollar he's going to talk about the pyramid now and the u.s dollar and it's called the great seal see even the money has to testify of god's seal the great seal the pyramid oh my and the pyramid never had a capstone on top of it see but you see that capstone was rejected and that capstone is the cornerstone and that cornerstone was rejected see and you see that cornerstone that held up the building that keystone okay we can stop there he is saying the foundation stone the capstone the keystone is the same stone it's all jesus christ that's why he said i am alpha and i am omega he is the beginning and he is the end he is the first and he is the last and we praise god for that hallelujah that is the same yesterday today and forever oh my and they don't understand what it represents for enoch built it amen no matter what you hear what books you read and what they tell you that's one thing but this prophet on the inspiration said he not built the pyramid and that's why they don't understand what it stands for and what they're doing whatsoever amen now we see the temple being built again we see the pyramid was one of uh mortar and rocks and you couldn't even run a blade of razor a razor blade between them rocks the way they were set and fitly put together like solomon's temple see but now god is calling a church that is elected by him praise god in other words those rocks those those uh blocks were cut out by him they were predestinated by him each one with a purpose each one to find their rightful place in the building of the body the temple of the living god and when they come together in god's spirit their lives fit together so close amen that the devil can't pass a razor in between them because they are one in jesus christ hallelujah oh praise god we don't have to put that on the holy spirit is doing that the holy spirit is the one that does that amen lord of god hallelujah amen see he is pulling his elect out of the pentecostal church that hybrid thing but he's pulling them out of that he's already saying in other words some of them are still in there but the word is pulling them out and he uses the word i just said pulling them out what he is now ready to finish up the word the seven church is over and now he's ready to finish up the word this this great artist working on this body it's about done amen hallelujah it come right up as we preach but last the sunday before it come right up through the foot and right up through gone up to the lips and then the seeing age with the prophet recognizing that it gone into the intelligence praise god of breaking the word began to break we begin to understand but now the life has come back to the body for the glory and praise of god so it can move and live amen under the inspiration of the holy spirit amen because you see it's so close now when that war that word itself will blend in with this word here you understand oh glory to god that revealed word god the lord god himself in word form is ready to detail like the chinese receipt the holy spirit coming down meeting that part of god that portion that you have in you the gene of god place in you deep calling to deep that to blend together hallelujah praise god brother donnie reagan is speaking about the blending of that he spoke and said he says you know when you blend something in a blender you can't separate the water from the juice from the fruit from the this it's all one hallelujah that's why we can say today by recognizing the hour that we're in i and my father are one i'm not only in agreement with the word but my nature is the same lord it's one hallelujah and therefore unconsciously it acts just like that one acted uh this one acts the same way hallelujah not some kind of put on but it's just a natural thing that it flows out of you when god needs it to be that way glory to god hallelujah oh don't you see what this is it's getting closer closer closer closer now oh my come down already through luther and wesley and and so on and now here come them pentecostals restoration of the gifts hallelujah and now god is taken out from there from all of them and holding out a bunch to make a ministry just like that word here because it's got to fit with this word amen because it's got to be that bride that he takes up with him praise god so it's got to be the same word same nature same everything for the glory of god hallelujah and christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil amen and his body is to do the same because the body this body now is the head of the body coming together amen hallelujah christ is the head the word the body has to be the same thing as the head the church of the word the virgin born from the word the virgin born church of the world hallelujah glory to god hallelujah and that's the way the body operates it operates by the head my body can't move until my head tells it to move then he says this and i'm going to listen to this close he says now well if my body is made of flesh says listen closely my body is made of fla my head is made of flesh but the rest of my body was made out of concrete i'm quoting him here he said it can't move because even though the head may be speaking words amen and can say move move move body move move you see there is nothing in that kind of a body to send that message to hallelujah praise god because it's all concrete hallelujah oh my oh my goodness well but if my head is christ and see if my head is christ and my body happens to be denomination how is that going to be able to send that message to that it can't do it because it's nothing but denomination nothing but concrete it can receive the word of god it's how's that going to work it will not do it because the body always obeys and operates from the head amen and then you see it again when a good sainted anointed man of god preaching the true word go straight uh as straight as the bible as he with the bible as he can them denominations will just look up at him and say oh no sir no sir get that man out of here right now amen because it doesn't fit with what they have in them it just does not fit but when this word goes out uh as i am preaching or any other real anointed sermon or god is preaching it fits something in your heart it's not a man putting it there it's not a man trying to convince or convert you it's the word of god calling and pulling it's the word of god inspiring revealing making itself known hallelujah and trusting that you would recognize it amen the body does the works that the head commands it to do but the body is the one that does the works amen see that's the way it is and he stops now he pauses here and he said see now now i have been so zealous of the kind of seed that i have been used to plant for this body and the rain is going to fall here real rain will come amen and it's got to have seed already in there to follow on i hope i'm still around and alive to see that amen when them seeds begin to come up praise god hallelujah do you understand what i'm saying now when them seeds come up it will be nothing less than the living word of god as it was in the beginning hallelujah oh my yes sir oh praise god it's the spoken word of god has god's power in it hallelujah it is then him in his own people in his own body working his own way and working through it for his glory that's what i'm saying don't let's act prematurely but let the head begin to work through his body we don't even know what next he wants to do what next he wants to do but all of a sudden in the quietness when you think oh it's just another surface all sudden something breaks out and nothing you had to do with it it's god did it amen it's the holy spirit just broke out with the word of god when he chooses to oh praise god forevermore hallelujah don't you understand we are all now coming to that great mount zion showdown now amen hallelujah praise god then my friends he says then we see john twentieth chapter fulfilled oh my whosoever sins your remit oh to them they are remitted unto them and so whosoever sins you retain they are retained was he talking about the bride having power to forgive sins then he says now look at matthew 16 19 also see now i also will give unto you the keys of the kingdom of heaven that whosoever use whatsoever you shall bind an heart amen shall be bound in heaven whatsoever you loosen heart loose in heaven amen praise god forevermore hallelujah oh my do you know the power of this understanding of the revelation or the message you've received amen the power to bind and loose uh solomon said leave one fool in his foolishness and and this other fool here he can learn so you can give him hey man it's two fools but one fool is taking it and the other one don't want it right away oh my see so brother bram talks about the about the mule and the ass he says you see the mule is a hybrid and no matter what you do he's going to remain immune and he's going to die a mule he says but an ass in the bible has a chance of redemption because it's original never mind that he was made to be that but god made him an original hallelujah praise god so he can be redeemed no matter who it is you share the word of god to them these subjects of course i'm not expanding on them i'm just passing right over them like this praise god but see instead of the bride that harlot church claims their remit sins satan always trying to copy god and trying to run ahead and trying to do what god's people supposed to do he runs and tries to do it that way and say he has the power to remit sins by by but remitting sins by what not the not the power of the blood by but by denominational power is that right by denominational power now uh years ago i said it and let me repeat it so you might just get a hint denominational power and demon power is not far apart right so it's not far apart at all so recognize what he's saying here clearly look they are saying that when and look at their fruit look at their children they allow them to go to every dance hall cut off their hair paint up themselves like clones living with other man's wives
