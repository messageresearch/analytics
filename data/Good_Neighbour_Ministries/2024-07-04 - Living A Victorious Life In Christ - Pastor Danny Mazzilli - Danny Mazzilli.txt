Jesus praise God welcome into the house of the Lord it's Wednesday night amen I know that it's always a bit of a sacrifice to get in here on Wednesday night a lot of us working and and uh toiling and uh dealing with so many things and situations but I'll tell you when you get here on Wednesday nights you you strengthen yourself for the remainder of the week it's as simple as that amen so when you can get here you want to be here because it gives you the strength um it's a supernatural strength when the word of God is being preached and you're in that atmosphere and you're receiving it it does it does something and it does you good amen praise God so tonight um we're here it's Bible study so we're going to start a little bit of a study on um living a Victorious Life In Christ amen how many wants to be victorious how many wants to live for Christ but at the same time have victory in your lives amen We Are The Most Blessed people here on the planet because we have we have something within us that overrides and and is in control of and emanates and permeates every single atom and molecule on this Earth and if you're connected to that and you're one with that and you're aware of that you become Victorious amen praise God so let us um let us pray and then we'll go to the scriptures and um we won't keep you long tonight we want to get done on Wednesday nights we'd like to be done by around 8:30 to 8:45 this way everybody's you know home um early enough so that they can um prepare for next day I know I got to get up tomorrow morning at like 4:30 in the morning and um that extra sleep is important when you get over 50 praise God father we're so grateful tonight Lord that we can be here and be in your presence and allow your word to just come and have the preeminence oh God and just speak to our hearts and our lives give us what we need Lord tonight each and every one of us are at different uh places in our walk and Lord we're just trusting we're believing this message this call on our lives is not just some ordinary um thing we're not just church members but we are members of the mystical body of Jesus Christ you're a living God and you're in the midst of your people and if we're aware of that we can live Victorious and so tonight Lord as we approach your word we just ask your anointing to come bless your people Grant it we pray and bless those that are online that would listen in tonight Lord May the word have an effect on each and everyone in Jesus name amen praise God God bless you Saints let's read our scripture tonight A a very familiar scripture from The Book of Romans chapter 7 vers 14 for we know that the law is spiritual but I am carnal sold under sin for that which I do I allow not for that for what I would that do I not but what I hate that do I if then I do that which I would not I consent under unto the law that it is good now then it is no more I that doeth but sin that dwelleth in me so we need to realize that you know the fall back in the Garden of Eden allowed sin into our flesh and sin began to take control contr and became part of our characteristic as human beings and that's why the Bible says you're born in sin so until you recognize who you are in this flesh as a human you can't really overcome amen for now then it is no more I that do it but sin for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not for the good that I would I do not but the evil which I would not that I do now if I do that I would not it is no more I that doeth it but sin that dwelleth in me you see you got to understanding justification is very important important because the the the sin that that so easily besets you from time to time and the sin that you as you you know with your memory can look back and you can see the things that you did wrong all those things you need to realize that was not really you if you've truly been awakened in this hour I find then a law that when I would do good evil is present with me for I Delight in the law of God after the inward man but I see another law in my members Waring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of sin let us pray father add your blessings to the word now we pray in Jesus name you may be seated glory to God you know it's it's it's a paradox Saints it is a paradox that we have to um have this tremendous Revelation that God has given us when he when he when he woke us up out of our Amnesia he woke up the attribute that was in us that he placed within our hearts but that attribute like the like the scripture says uh the the the carnal mind is at emnity with God because you know there there's there's there's a Waring constantly within us to overcome and you know the devil loves to just you know hit us over the head with all of our past you know memories and past sin that he wants to you know he wants to apply it to to to us but knowing who we are as attributes of God you should be able to resist the devil by Revelation and tell him that was not me you were deceiving this flesh because it says very clearly that it is that that for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing there was nothing good in your human nature and your human ability it was all carnality it was all man it was all you thinking that that you could do things that you could overcome that you you know that with your own ability you could serve God you can't serve god with your own ability you can only serve God by faith amen amen praise God and you know I want to look at a scripture here back in the Old Testament um let's go to the next scripture it's from numbers 13:30 listen careful Caleb stilled the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it amen and that's what we want to talk about that's what we want to look at if we want to live a Victorious Life In Christ then we need to know that we need to overcome that we are Overcomers Hallelujah listen to brother Bram here he says or wait before we go to that the Greek word Nik is translated as Overcomer conqueror or Victor and we know from the seven Church ages the nians they were conquering Christ they were trying to conquer the word when the Holy Spirit would get into the church and the people would come under the leadership of God and the anointing of the Holy Spirit the enemy would try to conquer the church well it's now the other way around we're going to conquer the enemy because if you go on the verb means to have Victory we are victorious and we have Victory and the Victory is Christ in you amen that's where the victory lies to have superiority you can't have superiority over the things of this world or the enemy of this world the God of this evil age is more smarter more powerful he's had thousand thousands of years of dealing with human beings tricking human beings trapping human beings and that's why that the Bible says all in the in the end time in the last days all would be deceived except those whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life thanes so there's a people that cannot be deceived and it's it's because they're Overcomers and it's because the Overcomer lives in them it also means to defeat an enemy and when you overcome the little things in your life you're defeating an enemy it's War Warfare is is you know one little bit of ground at a time you know when when you go back and you you research War you know uh Hitler wanted to conquer all the nations and the way that he would do it he would go to one you know border and then he would conquer that border and then he'd go to the next one and he would conquer the next one well it's the same thing for you the enemy works that way trying to conquer your lives by starting with little things that's why the little foxes that spoil the vine you got to be aware of the things that that you're letting into your life he'll he'll work on you little by little until he's finally got you but the Holy Spirit also in you is an overcomer and little by little you'll overcome this that is your greatest enemy listen to brother brandham here he says next slide you know Israel started out and I could say the same thing and bring it in here brother Bram says they started out two million strong and ended up with two men right they saw the works of God they saw the manifestation of the spirit they saw Great Mighty Miracles being done there in Egypt and everything and started out but it wasn't in their heart they didn't overcome a lot of people they they Christ calls them you know and they they have that honeymoon stage where they come to the Lord and you know they'll join a church and you know they'll get uh you know excited about the things that they're hearing but then they they they need to realize that they need to overcome now in order to truly have victory in their walk with God because the enemy is not going to let you go that easy he is not going to let you just join the church and just immediately walk right in and start disrupting his kingdom no sir you got to overcome they just come out and Jesus said and they perished in the wilderness and are eternally dead every one of them is dead that means Eternal separation having no more the ability to be in the presence of God that's what it means to die and to be dead in this understanding every one of them is dead that means Eternal separation every one of them rotted in the wilderness but there was two men Joshua and Caleb and when it come to The Showdown the obstacles was so great till they looked like grasshoppers side of them Joshua screamed out with Caleb and said we are more than able to do it why God said so see until you get to a place where you believe what God said about you yes well God said about your ability to overcome that you are more than a conqueror until you come to that place where you've got confidence in the word of God and you've you've taken God at his word you're not looking at circumstance anymore they looked at those at those giants that were in there and they many of them their hearts melted because they figured there's just no way I can overcome and you might have situations in your life and you might think there's just no way that I can overcome this but don't rely on your ability amen we are more than able to do it why God said so and there and they were Overcomers they overcome they was the ones that was privileged out of the whole great organization of people people to take the real elected bride into the promised land and God has a people in this hour that have recognized that there is a true promise in the word of God and that promise is the rapture of the body of Jesus Christ and there are individuals that have been anointed by the word of God that have received the word of God that believe the word of God that don't look at circumstances anymore they're not looking at the Giants out there big churches big organizations like we were saying on Sunday I got a church you know people got churches with 20,000 30,000 40,000 but yet they have not overcome to believe God's word all of it because it's the word that's going to overcome it's not going to be you that overcomes but it'll be you recognizing that the word is in you and has already overcome what an hour Saints glory to God the bride into the pro Joshua and Caleb in the front lines out there as the two generals amen LED them right down to the river and cross the river over into the promised land why they believed the word no matter what from the message how can I overcome come praise God let's look at the next scripture Jesus used the word in John 16:33 where he said I have overcome the world you believe that amen glory to God why do you think he had to come here why do you think that he had to become that the word had to become flesh the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us you know we always talk about it but people don't realize it's only through Jesus Christ that true salvation can be achieved because there's no way that human beings can overcome this world that's why they're going into Great Tribulation and that's why the the the prophecies that are written about the world and the end time and what is next to come you know the Bible has a 7,000 year plan did you know that the Bible has 4,000 years before Christ and 3,000 years after Christ 2,000 have already gone by and the last Thousand Years according to the Bible for this Earth is the Millennium and it's 1,000 years of Peace there'll be no more overcoming then not for the Sons and Daughters of God no sir they will rule and reign with Christ in that new government there'll be no more overcoming but he had to come as the wave sheath as the Overcomer so that he could give up his Spirit to come into us so that we could overcome amen that's why he said and he made it plain to them to to the disciples and to the to the world then I have overcome the world this Dimension this Plan of Redemption this plan that I have to redeem my own he's come to take back what was rightfully his from before the foundations of this world Amen and he made it clear that listen I've overcome the world you don't have to worry about World War I World War II or World War I that's coming I've overcome it but you need to be in me you need to know that you are my people and that I am your God go to the next slide in short he meant I have conquered Satan's system because remember Satan's got a plan too God allowed him to have that plan because it's all part of the Redemption it's all part of being a savior how can you be a savior if there's nothing to save how can you be a father if you don't have children you see God wanted to express himself and he wanted to be a conqueror he wanted to be a savior and the only way he could do that was to know the end from the beginning and place individuals here on the earth on free moral agency and give them the ability to accept him that's the only thing that is required you must accept when he reveals himself to you you can't reject go on Revelations 1:18 I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forever more amen and have the keys of hell and of death see he was he was making it very plain here that he was the one that came to conquer I got the keys he says Satan doesn't have the keys you don't have to fear death the enemy can't death can't take you that's why Paul said death where's your sting death has no sting to a son or a daughter of God because the con conqueror lives in them the one who overcame the world the one who came to to conquer Satan's system now lives in you we are partakers of his victory the Christian next Slide the Christian as a member of the body of Christ is a partaker of his victory we need to realize the the the awesomeness of these truths we are partakers of his victory it's not your Victory don't be looking for you to be the great Victor he's the one that gives you Victory amen next a Christian partakes of everything that Christ is and has including his righteousness you want to put on righteous people want to oh I'm more righteous than you I I go to church more I pray more I do it's not by works it's not by your own righteousness I give more I I I do more good I I go onto the street and I I I preach to the poor and I go three days a week four days a week listen those are great things but it's not based on your own righteousness it's his righteousness his death it was his death that gave you life am it's not you dying that's going to give you life it's his death in you gives you eternal life amen it was his resurrection it wasn't Muhammad raising from a cave on a white horse it was Jesus Christ raising from the dead amen after three days exactly the way he said he was going to do it he's the only one that proved his word and people have a driver's license a birth certificate that proves that Jesus Christ was here on this Earth his Spirit his divine nature and his inheritance is what we gain go on since Christ is a Victor Christians partake of his victory the believer then is a Victor all that was in Christ he poured upon the church church so his victory his overcoming ability his spirit all the things that he conquered he pour it into you so that you could realize and recognize that you are now more than a conqueror those who have been born of God are true Overcomers but you got to be born let's look at some scriptures on overcoming Romans 8:37 nay in all these things we are more than conquerors there it is Allelujah aren't you happy aren't you glad that you are actually more than conquerors but how through him why because he loved us amen because he loves you amen praise God hallelujah next scripture 1 Corinthians 15:57 says but thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah praise God Amen and the next one says in Romans 81 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ if you're in Christ that devil can't condemn you anymore he can bring up your past he can bring up your mistakes he can he can show them to you and and you actually really did those things but it wasn't you it was the it was the sin that dwell in your flesh you were you you were unaware that God was a part of your life you were just subject to this this carnal uh uh realm here and and and you were governed by your emotions you were governed by the lust of the flesh you were governed by the pride of life you were governed by the by the uh uh all the unbeliever belief that that you were brought up you know around people people know listen there's a lot of generational things that were in your life surrounded your life could have been in your parents in your grandparents in your great grandparents it's totally irrelevant now you need to come to a place this bride is coming into a level of maturity where she realizes who she is amen that she is not of this world we're in the world but we're not of the world we are attributes of God we are actually a part of God that has already overcome this world and you've come out of your Amnesia you've come out of that sleep state where where you're you're constantly under control of the things of this where we who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit we're listening for the Holy Spirit to speak to us here tonight it's a Bible study we're looking at a lot of scripture but I I trust that these scriptures in some area of your life one of them will will strike you and wake you up you know you could have read these scriptures a thousand times but if God wants to speak to you about one particular situation where the enemy has got you bound up got you chained up under the circumstances of of of your flesh and constantly holding you in a state of condemnation you can be set free tonight by resisting the enemy amen praise God let's go on expectations from a Believer we're called Christians why because we're Christlike we have Christ in our lives we live for Christ now we don't live for the world anymore we live for Christ Christ who is the word we are called children of light Ephesians 5:8 and Children of the day 1 Thessalonians 55 we've been brought from the darkness of this world of the traditions of man of the teachings of man into the Glorious light of the liberty of Christ Jesus the word revealed to you personally amen we are called the children of obedience you know a lot of people want to hang on to a stubborn Spirit of rebellion it's just a spirit of disobedience is what it is remember that Spirit of Disobedience it started right back in the Garden of Eden and it's a part of of the nature of this flesh but the word says that we are called children of obedience why because obedience to the word of God because Christ obeyed and did all that the father had shown him and because of his obedience now we become the children of obedience because we are Sons and Daughters of God by accepting Christ as our absolute do you see like you you know like when when when Disobedience uh tries to control you replace it by saying that Christ obeyed you know there's scripture that says that that he had to come under obedience in order for him to overcome this world Imagine God having to come under obedience because he knew that you would have to be in this human flesh and so he had to overcome and become obedient in flesh so that when the Revelation comes to you and you're in flesh you can understand that you can now be children of obedience and not Disobedience because he overcame thank we are also called the children of God now if you're a child of God then you're actually a mini God don't get me wrong here don't don't oh I'm God by maturity and by Revelation you'll come to recognize that you are a part of God that you are expressed part of God he expressed you in the form of an attribute but that attribute is God that's why he said on that day ye shall know that I am in the father ye in me and I in you he was talking talking about this body of Christ that we are a part of that gives us the ability to say that we are children of God a child of God walks with power walks with authority let's move on I don't want to get ahead of myself but most of all we are called in the title of Overcomers we are called in the title of Overcomers 1 John 5:4 says whatever is born of God overcometh the world there's a promise right there in the word of God whatever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world our Revelation that we are Overcomers our re Revelation that we are children of God our Revelation that greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world having a revelation of that gives us the ability to overcome any circumstance whatsoever but you must be born of god let's go on the way to be an overcomer Jesus says here in John 3 3 he says Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot even see the kingdom of God so here now we need to realize you know a lot of people you know uh talk about Christ and they they they mention being born again what is it to be born again literally your old life dies Y when you go into that water and you're buried in that water your old life literally gets left behind you need to have a revelation on that baptism a lot of people go in a wet a dry Sinner and they come out a wet sinner because they have not accepted the spirit of the word of God and have truly had the new birth which is the Awakening it's not that you all of a sudden you you you come to an altar call and and and you oh I went to The Altar and I gave my life to Jesus Christ and now I'm born again no the true birth is that you come to realize that you were always a son or a daughter of God and that you were in a state of total Amnesia not knowing who you were you thought you were born into this world you were told that when you get old you're going to die you're going to be buried six feet under and then if you were brought up in Catholic then they were told you go to a Purgatory if you're you know a Buddhist then you become a part of nature or some animal or or if you're a Hindu or whatever all these different teachings or if you're a Muslim you go and you get 21 new wives all kinds of rubbish the true birth allows you to recognize and bring you back to the word of God Amen and it gives you the ability to see the kingdom to see the Plan of Redemption to see what it is that you are actually going to be saved from and what it is that that that has a hold on your life right now that you've been that you're being set free from and that you you're now open to the understanding of the true kingdom of God but it requires you to submit to the word of God next slide says in James 47 and 8 it says submit yourselves therefore to the word you've got to believe God's word you've got to submit to the word and you've got to resist evil because when you resist it flees from you we're told that all we need to do is resist the enemy it's not an easy thing to resist the enemy you know a lot of people think that the enemy is just you know a person out there or some system out there sometimes you'll be talking to one of your own brothers and sisters and that enemy will pop right up and speak through your brother or your sister and you don't want to resist you want to fight because pride is a devil and it takes a hold of you and all of a sudden you got to prove that you're right and that he's wrong or she's right and you're wrong you see all these things where we have to resist sometimes we we think that it's resisting oh I'm going to resist that system there I'm not going to go to that church I'm not going to go into those places where where the enemy is you know uh they got all kinds of you know uh metal music and satanic worship and all those things and meanwhile you you're right in church and you can't even resist when when the enemy comes and sits right there with you with your brother or your sister in the midst of a fellowship and you've got to you've got to pop off and show that you know you can't resist the enemy that's when you need to be quiet you need to be still you need to allow the Holy Ghost to deliver you and to deliver them next slide draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh unto you cleanse your hands ye Sinners and purify your hearts you double-minded you know here he is he's talking about submitting to God resisting the enemy and he gets into the little nitty pritty things about cleaning your hands you know doing certain things that you know you shouldn't be doing purifying your hearts keeping unforgiveness what a devil that is that is one terrible demon from the pits of hell and it and it it it holds more Sons and Daughters of God than anything else did you know that oh they did did this to me when did they do that 20 years ago 20 years ago my God and you wonder 20 years later and that thing is still in your heart that's a dangerous thing you see overcoming and drawing near to God requires us to purify our hearts and know remember that flesh did that thing it wasn't the attribute of God because the attribute of God could never ever come against itself no it couldn't do it it could never come and strike itself how can the kingdom of God strike itself no the enemy the devil will strike other Devils to bring war and to bring confusion and to bring uh enity but no way attributes of God can hold on to unforgiveness and allow it to sit there in their heart when when the word of God says you need to purify your heart because you're double-minded and you don't know it you show yourself one way but yet you don't trust God in this area I know this flesh will be sticky I know that it's hard to trust the Flesh and you can't trust the flesh it's one of the things that that that you know it's that emnity with God remember that part of the flesh is your carnal mind remember that okay your carnal mind is going to tell you no no this actually happened they did this or he did that or she did this yes but that doesn't put you in that should never put you in a place where you are now in that condition where your heart is not pure and your mind is is not settled you should be able to forgive and forget amen that's the way God forgives he forgives he forgets he doesn't bring it up anymore never brings it up never brings it up never brings it up but when the enemy Rises up which he will try to rise up again what are you going to do resist you're going to resist it you're not going to Bow into it you're not going to talk about it you're not going to you're not going to elabor at on it you're not going to express it because the minute the enemy sees you in that condition he says I still got them you see the kind of things you can draw of the word of God submission to God to submit next slide means to yield to draw near acknowledge or Surrender oneself to the will and authority of God do you do you not believe that God has the authority and the ability to deal with whatever circumstance you might think is too hard for you it's too hard you can't you can't forgive it you're having a hard time forgiving it but it's because you haven't fully submitted to his authority and his ability to do it and it keeps you in a in a defeated condition and Satan just looks at you and says still got him and you can't go any further when you're in that kind of a condition you're just stuck right there and you're wondering why you're feeling you know that that you're not just completely free and you know but when when you when Jesus said he that's heavy laden come unto me I'll give you rest you know what like you know you know how it is to have a really good rest you know when you when you've really like oh this feels so good you're just falling into that beautiful rest and it just feels so good you know well that's what he wants you to experience with him he wants you to have that rest where you're at peace where your your your your joy you know the joy of the Lord now becomes your strength imagine that if you've been feeling weak and you're one my God I'm feeling so weak I'm tired all the time time because you need more joy in your life you need more joy in your walk you know you need to you need to laugh more you need to you know uh you know encourage one another with with with good positive thoughts and and things that are going to uh you know build joy into your life because if you've got joy in the Lord You' be able to sing that song the joy of the Lord is my strength amen and all of a sudden you're going to have a different walk you're going to have a a little bit more of a leap and a and a little bit more bounce in your walk with God and with your brothers and your sisters and the community of God we are called Next we are called to submit ourselves to God in all areas of Our Lives listen carefully now spiritually [Music] mentally physically socially and financially amen all areas of Our Lives some people they'll they'll do fine with the with the spirituality but you know when it comes to socially they can't get along with other people stubborn Spirits stubborn you know just or you you know physically and and and you know they're great physically but then they're stingy cuz they can't let go and and allow God to just flow through their lives financially Financial blessing of the Lord it flows amen through you the scripture says he he will not muzzle the O the ox that threshes out the corn think about that so if you're if you're a giver you want to be a better Giver amen a greater Giver because God's not GNA he's not going to stop that he's not gonna if he sees that you're doing he's G boy I can flow a lot more through that one there Hallelujah he doesn't hold on to any of it he just lets it Go and God provides your needs gives you more than enough does things supernaturally in your life he just drops blessings on you out of nowhere all of a sudden a blessing comes your way you didn't even know where it came from Uncle who left me how much hallelujah praise God he can flow through you if you allow him to flow through you amen but you got to know that he is the provider he's The Giver hallelujah praise God so all of these areas mentally we want to we want to mentally give ourselves and submit ourselves in every area of Our Lives let's let's go to the next in uh he also wants us we're going to five more minutes and then we're going to continue next time uh 1 John 1 18-10 he says if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us this is what I mean by understanding who you are as a human being until you come to realize that you're born in sin shaped in iniquity speaking lies a lot of people oh I never did anything bad I don't I you know I I I I i' I'm good there's none good amen nobody nobody's good the only one that's good is God Amen and if you've got God in you that's good Hallelujah praise God he says here and if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us do you see how important it is to confess your sins in other words you know like sometimes you got to go and and and you got to make things right with your brother or sister sometimes God will show you when it comes to confessing certain situations because of something you may have done against a brother or sister and you will no matter what that thing will kind of linger until you make it right and you just got to clear it and confess it and say you know what I want this thing gone I don't want it coming up anymore if you notice it coming up it's because it's still a little bit unconfessed okay and so we need to we need to uh confess our sins before God he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness there are things that we do that are not righteous but if we confess it and we go to God and we say Lord I don't want this thing anymore you know I I I don't want it controlling my emotions controlling my thoughts I Want to Be Free he is faithful he's faithful amen and if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in US think about that people want to say oh I never did anything wrong I sin every day it happens it's it's constant we're being bombarded in our minds constantly you know brother Braham says a thousand times a day because we're constantly being bombarded with unbelief and we and we entertain certain things and then we we see certain things and we and and and it's like like but you see we got to realize that we're in this flesh and there's certain things that he requires of us in order to overcome praise God I think we'll stop right there let the musicians come I believe that you know as we do this little study on living a Victorious Life In Christ we can draw things out of the word of God I i' I've been blessed by the word tonight amen I've been blessed by what I've read and the things that have come out of
