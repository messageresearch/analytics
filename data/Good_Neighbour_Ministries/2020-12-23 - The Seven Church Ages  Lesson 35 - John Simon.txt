TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] praise the lord it's good to be here again giving all the glory honor and praise unto the lord welcome friends happy to have you brothers and sisters in the presence of the lord may the lord bless you real good as we continue in our studies in the seven church ages particularly in the age of smyrna we ended our last talk by uh speaking of the hybriding that is in the world today and how it all started with eve in the garden of eden from whence we have this great uh process of high breeding man the humanity or the human race with animals producing a hybrid and it continues today human beings with a beast producing a hybrid cane with a nature contrary to god and god's word let us read out of the book of genesis chapter 4 verse 1. and adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and bear cain and said i have gotten a man from the lord verse 2 says and she again bare his brother abel and abel was a keeper of sheep but cain was a tiller of the ground just to clarify this knew eve his wife once and then she bore twins cain and then abel now not to go over the doctrine and teaching of the serpent's seed how that the serpent seduced eve and produced by her a hybrid son a bastard born to the word of god contrary to the will and plan of god and abel was the son of adam but cain was a son of the devil as spoken off in the book of first john now if we will look at the statement that eve makes here i have gotten a man from the lord eve had a lot more revelation and understanding than most people realize she did not publicly uh attribute the son to satan because that way how he came in um satan would have been able to spend another life that he was a creator like god she said i've gotten a man from the lord now in this sense that anything that happens god allows god allows so she's saying i've gotten a man because god permitted it god allowed me to have it but not that god was the father of that son so here we find my brothers and sisters that satan lost his opportunity right there of being able to say he's a creator for he was not he is a creation of god and a perverter of the will and the word of god and this is what we're talking about satan can create nothing of himself but what he does is watches whatever god does and then he copies it and perverts it adds a little bit here or a little bit there and then claims ownership of it that he invented or created it now we realize that god produced adam and eve by his spoken word creation as a matter of fact god's entire creation its foundation its origin was from his spoken word just read genesis 1 1 and it begins and god said and god said and it was so and god said and it was so and god said and it was so and that's the way it was according to hebrews chapter 11 verses uh verse 1 verse 3 it says by faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god god's spoken word was the origin of this entire creation of our entire universe made up of many worlds of which earth is just one and we are domiciled or live on this planet earth here we are on planet earth and it was framed or formed by the spoken word of god oh there's power in the spoken word there's creation in the spoken word out of the spoken word from the mouth of god it is so when god speaks it for god's word must come to pass amen praise god hallelujah now listen only god god was the only one that had the power to create for now when we come to the birth of christ we understand by by this god was illustrating and demonstrating what adam should have done at the beginning of the world adam should have spoken his word to his wife eve which would cause her to conceive by the planting of a word seed and she would have produced a word child or a child from him that was by god's ordained and god's provided way but instead she allowed satan to seduce her and by that seduction he injected or introduced into the creation and into our world the process and program called pro-creation now creation by the spoken word procreation by human instrumentality so close but yet a million miles apart now in the birth of christ our lord was illustrating how what adam should have done for the bible tells us in the book of matthew that from the presence of god came the angel gabriel and an angel stood before that virgin and spoke the word of god god's spoken word came through the mouth of an angel thou shalt bear a son amen and his name shall be called jesus and he shall save his people from their sins by that spoken word through the mouth of an angel creation of an egg in the womb of mary that came together and agreed with the word of god producing jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever now in our day takes me to god in these last days we are blessed by god that once his church drifted away from him drifted into worldliness churchianity creeds dogmas doctrines litanies various theologies covenants different things they've gone away into religious sciences religious teachings programs and so on what god in the middle of that seeing that his church has been deceived and that she has been drawn away by enticing spirits and seducing spirits with doctrines of devils god in our day has sent his angel his angel the seventh church angel to the seventh church age with a message for his people and sent him to bring this the word of god to god's people for the spoken word is the original seed it's the original seed that created everything and god allowed him to speak the message of the hour this spoken word that we as believers may open our hearts and receive the word of god receive the message of the owl and it would do what it will produce a genuine spoken word seed new birth and that brings about the reverse of satan's curse and place within us this confidence this certainty of god that we have the original life we have the original seed and we are walking in the light of the day now we realize that eve brought forth the serpent seed they were brought in the garden bought cain and abel there were in the original church if you want to put it that way both cain and abel that being in the church did not make them original seed sons seed children of the living god more than a pig being in a sheepfold it does not change that that peaks nature the nature of the pig remains the same even if he was raised every day of his life in a sheepfold his essential nature remains the same and he will never be transformed or changed into a lamb no prayers no burning of candles no particular doctrines of man not theologies nor persuasions of man nothing could change him transform him and move him and turn him from a big into a sheep or a lamb it cannot do it for every seed will bring forth after its kind amen even though bought seeds went through the similar process the children were different different because they were from different seeds different origins and lived different lives one la la the life of abel spoke of the truth of god the life of cain was just a a constant speaking of the satan's big lie amen he was a witness a testimony a billboard for satan's lie while the life of the other was a testimony and a flashing billboard of the truth of the very word of god amen oh my imagine she's saying cain was from god and accepting the devil's life [Music] instead of god's truth and that is exactly what our churches have done they have set themselves up as fountains of truth as depositories and repositories of the truth of the word of god but the truth is not in them the truth is not in them and yet their begotten children swear by them and would even kill for those churches their their loyalty and their faithfulness is not in the word of god not in the proclamations from the gospel of jesus christ but it's founded in their church doctrines teachings whatever it is that was laid in them from there the time of their natural birth and this is not an exaggeration this is not my personal sentiment but it is the proclamation of the word of god as found in ii timothy chapter 3. i charge thee therefore before god and the lord jesus christ uh timothy 4 who shall judge the queen and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom preach the word not church doctrine not litanies not the things of man not the geologies of man that have been distilled in their distillery of human science religious sciences no sir but preach the word preach the word preach it be instant in season hallelujah thank god it must be in its season and then it must be instant in season and out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all long-suffering long-suffering because you must stoop be humble and understand others who do not see or catch the revelation of your day and your of your hour preach and endure let them endure sound doctrine amen preach sound doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine that's our day that we're living in people want to be fed on fantasies and fables people want to be fed a diet religious myths and lines instead of sound doctrine the sound doctrine to them sounds caustic it sounds cutting it sounds crude and rough it sounds out of date it sounds that it is not in line with the flow of society not realizing that is not what we should stay in rhythm with we should be in rhythm with the word of god and the sound of the music that's leading a bride right into the skies trust him and believe him only believe for all things are possible to them that will believe the word of truth they will not endure some doctrine but after their own lust shall they heep to themselves teachers oh my what a day everywhere teachers preachers self-proclaimed prophets self-proclaimed apostles self-proclaimed great men oh god have mercy we are surrounded by multitudes of voices all claiming to be true but the bible says they shall keep up to themselves teachers having itching ears my god having itching ears you're itching to hear something new they're hip itching to hear something fresh they're itching to hear something different listen but the word of god does not change it's the old time holy spirit and the devil would go near it it's the old-time gospel that remains the same the word of god does not change it remains the same from the beginning unto the very end and by my friends having itching ears after a while such people itching to hear this itching to hear that they slowly begin to turn away from the truth satan begins to slowly inch them away from the original word of god which begins to seem like i said crude and rough to them while satan's meal sounds smooth and ordered and orderly yes and easily absorbed and taken in while the word of god takes you to have heirs that will hear of revelation oh my hearts to believe the truth of the word of god listen to the voice of god but watch watch now in all things endure afflictions do the work of an evangelist make full proof of your ministry hallelujah my friends the moment adam and eve left the word of god moved away from their original thai post death spiritual death and natural death set in upon them and there was no more strength in eve there was no more strength and so with the church their children were not born by the spoken word of god the children was born from a different source religious but from a different source and yet they claim their son their sons and daughters their membership that they are children of god and god rejects them for they are not his own god rejected cain and cain's offering cain's worship cain's altar it was all rejected and god testified of a bell though crude and rough with a rock cutting the neck of a lame and blood spraying everywhere yet he was the son of god he was filled with god's spirit god's leadership and god's anointing and god's revelation was upon him god testifying of his gift no strength and so what happened she became a monstrosity the original church of acts started to become a monstrosity from this age of smyrna bitterness had set in affliction had set in false doctrines had set in teachings of the nicolaitans had set in disobedience blindness to the word of god had set in and was swarming and taking over the entire work of god and the church of the living god the church that church of smyrna began to move away and move into forms and move into nickelodeon's ceremonies and began to organize a nickelodeon styled priesthood organized not ordained by god not called by the holy spirit not led by the holy spirit not led by the original shepherd of the sheepfold jesus christ yes but they are led by their organization and the head or leader of their organization instead of being led by the word of god and so they began to organize a priesthood into a group and they decided who the leadership of that priesthood would be instead of the holy spirit being the leader of it they claim the holy spirit gave them the wisdom to choose who will be the person that will lead that priesthood but that is contrary to the word of god it's not in god's bible and that moment death entered into the true church of the living god and discerned the lord's body and you will find that the the church of jesus christ so-called is one of the sickest bodies that we know change from a church filled with the power to glory the glow and the anointing of the holy spirit into a powerless group that loves to stress death and suffering and poverty oh my may god help us in this hour as we look and compare with the word of the living god yes sir i as i've said she moved from form move into forms and into ceremonies and into an organized priesthood and became a powerless church she has natural power but no spiritual power and her only weapon of friends has become what argumentation and debate by religious knowledge using that instead of the weapon of the revelation of the word of god and so as eve as the age of smyrna the church of this hour also modern church has built her hopes and our dreams built up on programs and not built upon faith in the word of god my friends and because they sold or planted programs in the hearts of their people they will reap and are reaping programs sought perversion perverted word into the minds and hearts of their people and so they are reaping perversion and perverted children they've tampered with god and when you tamper with god and the things of god you are going to reap exactly what you injected into it what you saw into it oh my god have mercy let's learn from nature my friends look at nature let's learn from nature watch how the human race has polluted nature tampered with nature and cross bred and high breeded nature how great men of science men of natural knowledge have injected their own ideas into nature and even to the rearrangement of molecules and by doing this we are now the human race is paying the price we are reaping the whirlwind by all manner of plagues and sickness and obesity and and old friends all manner of change in our bodies and our minds in our approach to things it's being changed because you become what you eat we see the bread and chickens and they are so highly bred they have become literal laying egg laying machines you don't need a machine you just need a properly bred chicken by the hype breeding to be an egg egg-laying machine not good lay a lot of eggs but they're not good for food they'll produce a lot of chicken some of them but they're not good for food they become soft not a rough rugged believing christian but they become soft and are poor for eating as far as that goes all manner of substances being injected into those poor animals and changed their molecular uh makeup and their turn from just a beautiful bird into a monstrosity of man oh friend look where we're at now and we see the same thing has happened the human race they place the substances in the chickens in the meat in the whatever else they they're giving us and then we eat it and we take in the very same substances that were in the chicken in the fish in in the whatever whatever other animals in the cows we take it all in and it changes our entire molecular structure and as a result of it women are getting wider in the shoulders narrower in the hips and the opposite is happening with men narrower in the shoulder and wider in the hips oh god have mercy and the human body is changing dramatically in the hour that we are living in because we have tempered with the natural food praise my god and if you tamper with the natural food you begin to produce a lot of natural human monstrosities and spiritually you trim temper with the food of the word of god and you begin to produce nothing but spiritual my friends uh spiritual monstrosities uh you begin to produce that here and what do you have my god the only answer to a perverted godless antichrist system my friends the only answer is god will have to cast the entire thing into the lake of fire like he did in the day of noah when he said i'm gonna wash the entire thing out i'm gonna have a new world i'm gonna wash this out he did it by water but now it's fire next time so fire upon the earth that will burn out and consume the things of this world and of satan the germs the evil that has been placed upon it here my friends here we are oh my bro the product of a church monster we have nothing but a denominational patchwork off of a frankenstein claiming that it is a son of god it's a child of god and it's nothing but a patchwork of denominational names patching themselves together in a union of churches so-called and my friends nothing but the beast again nothing but a monstrosity nothing but a frankenstein that's making a a claim that is baseless a bottomless pit building castles in the air castles built on the foundations of lies oh god have mercy for the hour that we are living in this dying age of smyrna when it died it never came back and no revival ever comes back from wherever it was it cannot because they have taken substitutes and rejected the word of god the only thing that can bring it back is fire from above regeneration from above the holy spirit coming from above can change the entire thing other than that my friends we look and see the last age started in 1906. with the great pentecostal revival but what they organized themselves right back instead of them taking the word of god they took the manual they took my friends the roberts rules of order they took all manner of organizational tools and begin to teach them and apply them with authority and with certainty as if there were the word of god and they were believed by millions and masses of people in the world my friends and here we find when they substituted their own ideas and begin to persecute each other and blame one another in every way they love their organization above everything else and what we have now is nothing but a second third fourth fifth sixth seventh generation of so-called pentecostals but i want you to know it's been said before i'll say it again god has no grandchildren you must be born again not your mother not your father not the pastor not the deacon not the priest not the supervisor not the superintendent you must be born again you must see him for yourself you must recognize your day and your hour in which we are living in amen praise god hallelujah oh praise god amen think about it churches not known for the power of the revelation of god's word but they are now known by their form of their worship by the ceremonies that they carry out they're distinguished by the difference of how they worship rather than by the word of the living god oh praise this wonderful name they can talk about what used to be and how it happened back then and back there and they've got my friends a whole lot of lightning but they lost the thunder all the thunders are gone from them but they've got a lot of lightning oh cracks and kraken sounds but no none of the real voice of god making itself manifest in their very myths what their boss about the glory of their founding of their movement little do they recognize ichabod ichabod the glory is departed the presence of god has left them the spirit of god has left the house and we are left with the works of man working up emotion and all kinds of generations things generated by man con contrary to the word of god oh praise god hallelujah oh my god the real pentecost started spontaneously and they should have left it spontaneous revelation is spontaneous it is not contained it's not educated into you it's not formed into a book of sciences that can be taught but it's something revealed flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you but my father in heaven has revealed this unto you and upon this rock of revelation upon this rock will i build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it oh friends what is baptist methodist nazarenes uh presbyterians brethren church of god uh you know church of god in christ whatever the name might be is irrelevant but all these brethren wonderful people as they may be brought up by different doctrines controlled and brought up under the tutelage of different bylaws church manuals and standards but when a genuine pentecost came 1906 and when it comes god sweeps aside all the manuals methods plans programs of man and and brings himself right in destroying every dispensational tear theory and restore the gifts of the spirit and now he is restored and is restoring his word in the midst of his people proving that he is the same yesterday today and forever the mighty god in christ hallelujah but did these people and do these people learn their lesson that god is a god of spontaneity and moves upon the people in this day and hour no sir they don't do it and because of that and because of having no faith they try to preserve that revival in other words as men try to preserve food by putting it in cans and that way they'll be able to preserve it and use it a long time from now they tried to preserve god or can god can him make him put him in a can and preserve his teaching his doctrine his word meanwhile it's dead meat everything is dead when they can it it's not alive anymore they did not learn their lessons and now they're written up their own textbooks they all their own theological books which are taught in their seminaries their teach the books of their laws wrought their own church manuals fellowship books standards of doctrine orders of fellowship with one mind to prove that they now have all the truth and they have all the answers and as such they become the very elite of god who know the way and can they're the only ones that can show the way because they have got it but i want to say to you they have not got it as long as i'm closing now they have not got it because they have hybridized themselves they are and by that they have produced a hybrid religion a religion that is half god and half man half beast half word half man's teaching man's mind man's reasoning man's argumentation placed in there and it's not glorifying god glorified man glorify god and a mixture of boat and produce nothing but a hybrid religion in the iron which we're living in oh praise my god my friends but they are is that if you want to be in the bride or if they want to be in that wonderful glorious number called the bride of christ they're going to have to come the very way their forefathers came they're going to have to come by the way of the revelation of the word of god spontaneous revelation of the word of god if you want to be in the bride you'll have to follow revelation chapter 18 verse 3 which reads for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth are wax rich through the abundance of our delicacies and i heard a voice from the heavens saying come out from her my people and ye be not partakers of our sins that you receive not her plagues for her sins have reached up into heaven and god has remembered our iniquities oh my my friends hear the call hear the cry come out of that denomination come out of that con spiritual condition and come to the fullness of the word of god and may god bless you for in the midst of smyrna in the midst of the eater in the midst of the bitterness of smyrna god can give you meat and god can give you sweetness come and receive it in the name of our lord jesus christ may the lord bless you and keep you in the midst of our chaotic age you can come to christ and receive him into your heart say lord forgive me cleanse me of my unbelief wash me from my sin and i commit myself to you as a child of the king may god bless you until we meet again [Music] you
