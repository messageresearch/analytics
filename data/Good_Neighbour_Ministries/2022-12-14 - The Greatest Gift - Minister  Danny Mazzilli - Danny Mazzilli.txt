doing for us with these young people by the grace of God as they move into their positions in the word of God it's as simple as that a lot of times we often wonder well what would God want with me what would God want to do with simple young old me or young me or old me or God has a wonderful plan for each and every one of his children and once you uh you Just Surrender yourself you submit to the spirit of God you'd be amazed what he can do with each and every one of you by God's grace thank you Shaw to Daniel amen praise God it's good to be in the house of the Lord um we sent out a message letting the people know that as a precaution we're asking that everybody wear a mask while in the services okay so just so you know if you know if you don't have it here tonight then you can be prepared for for next time we're just doing it as a precaution through the holiday season we do have some available at the back this covid has been raising its head again and you wonder well you know I'm not worried about it I'm not scared it's not a matter of being worried or scared it's a matter of understanding that in the same way that you can get a cold or you can get kidney disease or cancer or anything that is sickness there's no difference right there's no difference covet is just another dis-ease right it's just another form of sickness and we know that sickness is all of the devil it attacks your your body and it uh and it tries to weaken you in whatever form and uh you know if you're wondering is covet real yeah it is real absolutely I just came out of it for the last two weeks and still having some side effects from it okay um it's something different that I've never experienced before okay it didn't knock me down on my back and completely knocked me out but it has had an effect like just in the last week or so I can't taste things I'm having issues with the taste of everything you know and I was wondering about that and I didn't come to realize I said oh I've heard people say that one of the side effects is that you can't taste things you know for a while you lose your sense of smell your sense of taste and it definitely happened to me you know it's a side effect of that particular virus flu whatever you want to call it so you do need to take precautions if you don't want to have the effects of it my mother used to say hey put your coat on don't go outside without a hat it's winter out there and if you go out there and you start running around you sweat before you know it you're downstairs crying the blues and you got a cold and you're you've got a fever and everything else well those are the effects it's cause and effect right you sow and you reap these are simple things that we need to realize as Christians you know people say oh no plague shall touch me that is fine if you're listen it's like the scripture says that you know that uh uh I'll be uh you know bitten by a serpent and it shall not harm you well if you're walking through the forest and you happen to step on a on a snake and it bites you and you didn't expect it you didn't go after it then you shouldn't fear it it'll do whatever it has to do but it cannot harm you according to the word of God your faith has to be balanced properly you know what I mean you're the freest people on earth but yet if you you know you know tonight we're going to be looking at something here tonight and you know we're in the Christmas season and everything else and and uh we are the freest people and Christmas has a totally different meaning to the Sons and Daughters of God than it does to the rest of the world but it's all in balance and understanding it and living and Walking with God in a way where you can live by faith and allow Grace to operate in your lives amen praise God so we will be taking these precautions until further notice we'll see how long um you know we need to do it we did it over the last couple of years and it was successful we had no breakouts in the church where there was a whole big breakout and all of a sudden the whole half the church got covered like there was in many other institutions and so forth we took certain precautions and they were effective and so we are looking to do the same thing now over this flu season because you know temperatures the weather and everything else makes us more susceptible to these things amen praise God let us move on let us pray as we go to the word of God father we just want to thank you tonight Lord for the balance of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives Lord to walk with you in such a way Lord that we don't have to fear but we ask for wisdom you give it to us and we need to apply it in our lives and Lord tonight we ask your anointing to come and minister to our hearts and to our needs Lord we want to remember all those that are sick and Afflicted Among Us Lord we want to remember our pastor tonight Lord that you would touch him touch his precious wife sister Desiree his children Lord whoever may be affected we pray and ask that your anointing will sweep over their home Lord and raise such a standard that they will be made perfectly whole in the name of Jesus Christ father we commit all the saints and all those that are affected in any way Lord may your spirit just go and minister to their needs we pray we just Commit This service tonight into your hands in Jesus name amen praise God God bless you Saints tonight we're going to be looking at the greatest gift you know we're we're in the Christmas season and um it's it's a wonderful time you know for the world because everybody's you know feeling the joy of Christmas and and it's great you know and it's actually an opportunity for us to shine even more at these times you know because um you can you can talk about Christmas and give them the truth about Christmas you know tell them about the reality of Christmas so let's read our scripture tonight it's from Luke chapter 2. verses 9 to 12. and lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord Shone round about them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people For unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a Manger the Lord had his blessings to his word you may be seated well you know some of the things that we um first of all need to clear up and we're not going to get into a study on this but if anybody is interested you can go to the next slide we want to just you know clear up a few things make certain things clear here because it's the truth in you that has given you the walk with God that you have today it's by you knowing the truth by you experiencing the truth and knowing that he is the Living God but it's good to know certain things that you know separate us and liberate us as children of God as Sons and Daughters of God and one of the things is is that December is winter time in Judea snow is all over Jerusalem and Israel the irony is if Jesus was born in a manger in December he would have possibly frozen to death in the snow besides Shepherds won't be grazing their sheep on Snowy land with their sheep you know up on the Hills that's not when they do it they do it in the springtime that's when they go and graze with their sheep okay so understanding that first of all December is not the time of the birth of Jesus now the world celebrates it like I said I'm not going to get into the study but I did come across a lot of really good information in the form of a of a packet of information that brother Ron malabel uh in in the Philippines he's a he's a pastor of a church out there that does a lot of great work and research in developing and putting together information Powerpoints and in from his package on that's where I got some of this information are very useful if you want to know about the history of Christmas so you can send me a text message you can send me an email and I'll send it right to you it's it's great reading it gives you the full history on you know how December was actually you know a time that that it's it's a pagan holiday it was something that was established way back in the early you know 300s and uh they you know they they would have big festivals in the month of December um those you know five six days leading up to the 25th of December which you know ends up being the longest day of the year and and you know certain things that where the sun you know comes out um and they worshiped the Sun and there's a lot of pagan rituals around it okay I won't get into the details but if you are interested in it then I'd be happy to provide it to you Jesus was actually born in April when we celebrate Easter okay it's good for us to understand the importance of you know the the timing of things because it makes more sense to us understanding that you know Lambs are born in the spring that's when Lambs are born Jesus was the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world Amen and the greatest gift that we received through his birth was the gift of salvation brother Brahm says here our Lord was born in April but he wasn't born in December if you've been in Judea in December it's colder than this sheep are not born in December anyhow sheep are born in the spring praise God so let's read the next scripture or the the next um quote here brother Bram speaking in God's wrapped gift that's the only way anybody in the world will ever know what's in that package it has to be revealed to you you'll turn it down say it's it's fanaticism but when you get the Revelation you'll seek for it you'll open up and God will come in and sup with you and you with him when you're ready to open the door let him in that little package Knocking at Your Heart the greatest Christmas gift was ever given the first one and the greatest one that little package knocking at the heart of man it'll come in and sup you'll never know it until it's revealed to you when it's revealed to you then you'll go to hunting for it praise God Amen you know what a wonderful thing you know we're talking about the greatest gift and this is the thing that that you know we as Sons and Daughters of God we Rejoice around Christ around the worship of Jesus Christ that's what Christmas is all about it's about worshiping Jesus Christ and we don't worship him on a certain day we worship him every day amen praise God let's read our scripture from Ephesians chapter 2 verse 8. for by grace are ye saved through faith and not of yourselves it is the gift of God salvation nor not of Works lest any man should boast this gift that God has given us is not something that we deserved it's not something that you know that we decided oh you know what I'm gonna I'm gonna accept Jesus Christ uh you know the birth of Jesus Christ it's Christmas oh I should be going to church now you know when I was when I was you know living as a Roman Catholic you know we would go to church a couple times a year Christmas and Easter right and we figured well if we did that then you know that would justify our salvation well salvation is not something that you can earn salvation is not something that you can get because of works because of what you do it's not because of what you do it's because of what he has done next brother Brown speaking here in the Hebrews series Grace is what God did for me works is what I do for God you see God gave you a revelation of your salvation if there was any greater gift that God could have given you he would have given it to you but that great gift was the gift of knowing that you are an attribute of God that you are a son of God that you were not born into this world to some humans and that your life begins and it'll last for just so many years and then you die and then you get put into a grave you were given the Revelation that you were with God that you were a Son of God a daughter of God before you came to this world and the gift is the revelation of knowing who you are praise God grace is what God did for me works is what I do for God now they'll make a Doctrine out of it they think that works is what wins your merits if it is it isn't a free gift remember you don't deserve anything as a human being we're born in sin shaped in iniquity speaking lies there's nothing good that we can do I mean we can do lots of good works and so forth here in this world but it's all temporary it has no eternal end or or or beginning it has no reward other than pride and and fame and Legacy what good is that going to do people are forgotten after a few years they're forgotten once they're gone but God never forget Grace is what God did for you by Grace you're saved and works is what you do in appreciation of Grace that he showed to you and if you love him you like to do the works of the Lord certainly because then you you love him you see that's the beauty of this relationship with God when you've truly come into a relationship with God you're serving him because you love him because you've experienced his love in a way like nobody else could experience love to you you just go back and think about your salvation and when you were a first awakened to the understanding of who you really were and that God was a reality and you experienced his love it's the kind of Love Saints listen I can't even describe it you have to know it by experience that's the only way that you can truly understand this uh this revelation of the love of God in your lives and in your hearts for you to live for God and to love him and to serve him because you love him it's not something that that you can explain I can't explain it to you but you understand if you have revelation of it next so we're just looking at things here in order to to you know kind of look into how it is that we experience this gift how are we living out this gift how is this gift that God has given us how is it being expressed in our lives because remember God is his own interpreter God has given us something God is is revealing more and more of himself as we walk with God more and more of himself in Mark 16 it says he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned he that believeth you know like people say oh I want to be baptized well why are you being baptized and then you go to them and you say so how did you want to be baptized well you know in the name of the father and the son and of the Holy Spirit in the name of the father and the son and of the Holy Spirit well are they believing truth so how can they actually experience the true meaning of the gift of Salvation when truth is not the foundation of the gift everybody's out there by works all they're they're they're they're getting out their list and they're making their list and you know of all the gifts that they've got to give to all the people that they know and they don't want to miss anybody because if they miss somebody then then they're not going to be loved in the same way you see it's all by works it's all without faith and all without revelation of what it is and what is the true gift and what is the true gift that you can give others Romans 8 30 says moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified amen do you see the difference do you see that that that that this is not a gift that you can work up and get and deserve but this is something that God has done he saw you from before the foundations of the world he knew that you would be an attribute in this time and in this season and that you would be manifesting his word and so he prepared you for this time he prepared you to the point where he justified you that when you would come to him and receive that gift that greatest gift you would know that it's not something that he's going to take back from you you knew that that this was something real that all your unbelief all the sin that had a hold of you and had control over your life all the all the traditions of this world and all the things that had a hold of you he knew that you needed to be released from those things that you would need to be set free from those bondages that your mind would need to be liberated and and set free so that you could truly worship Christ it's Christmas time it's always Christmas time for the Sons and Daughters of God we worship him because of the Revelation that he's given us to know who we are that we are Justified that we're Sanctified that there's no more anything that you need to do he's doing it for you he's he's revealing himself more and more every day as you walk with him liberating you to serve him and and to serve him with passion amen praise God Justified now next slide arminianism is is you know when people think that they've got to do Works in order to to be justified now works are fine but they don't save you you're not saved by works people need to understand that people you know a lot of people that that are that are you know very religious they think they got to do the Rosemary they got to do their their their Hail Marys they got to do 10 our fathers they got you see it's all doctrines and and and traditions of man it's not what God requires works are fine but they don't save you they don't make you perfect it is Christ or perish and it is not even Christ and works it is Christ Alone this age began the years of arminism that does not believe in Christ as the reality it does not sing of nothing but the blood for it sings of nothing but the blood and my own conduct that's not what it's about this is nothing but the blood Saints nothing but the blood of Jesus this great gift that God has given you it comes through the blood it comes without cost it comes without price it's not based on what you do now I believe in Good Conduct if you are saved you will do righteously you will have a desire to do what's good you'll have a desire to do what's right we've already gone over that but let me tell you now salvation is not Jesus Plus no sir it is all about Jesus himself next slide says James 2 17 to 26 even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone because faith has to express itself through your life through your experience through your vocal uh uh descriptions through your ways of communicating faith is expressed in many different ways yea a man may say thou has faith and I have Works show me thy faith without thy works and I will show thee my faith by my works thou believest that there is one God thou do as well the Devils also believe and tremble so it's not just saying I believe it's knowing that you know that you know but will thou know o vain man that faith without works is dead so to say I believe you know like a lot of people say oh you know I've never done anything wrong in my life I've never heard anybody and you know and and they want to justify that you know that they're going to heaven because of works it's got nothing to do with works it's got to do with the fact that you are an attribute of God your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life from before the foundations of the world and in a certain time and season your name was going to be called through the word of God for this day in this hour your ability to recognize the word is your ability to respond to the word in your day it's you actually saying my name has been called when you can say Amen to the word of God for your day listen to brother Brown he says now works will never take the place of faith in God for our salvation but works will show forth our faith already placed in him you see we've we've we're justified in Christ we're Justified because of him saying we are Justified he said it we believe it so we're Justified because the revelation of justification has been revealed to us in our hearts and there's no and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against that revelation you're free you're Justified and you know it God good works won't save you but they will come forth out of a saved life as fruit unto the Lord we serve the Lord we come to church we we pay our tithes we give our offerings not because we have to not because it's a part of the requirement of the church in order to be a member of the church no it's because we recognize that we are sons of God and that God placed us here Earth I don't know about you but we're still in these human bodies over here and we need to exist in these human bodies we need to operate in these human bodies we need to operate under this realm we need to have a roof over our head those lights that you see shining down they're they're they're they're they're clocking right now and every every few minutes it's adding to our bill at the end of the month and that bill needs to be paid it's all part of our experience as Sons and Daughters of God here on Earth but it's God that gave us this place it's God that gives us the money to provide and make the payments for this house of worship you see the Revelation is that it's God that gives to us that gives us the ability to live and to manifest Financial blessings in our lives your financial blessings come as a result of your revelation of Jehovah Jireh knowing that God is your provider when you get to that place you'll be walking a different kind of walk you will have a different kind of expectation in your lives God will never forsake you God will never leave you God will never allow his children to to be begging bread that's the word of God and that's who we are we are the word being manifested in this day in this hour knowing that God is our provider God is Jehovah Jireh he will provide all of our needs it's not going to be because of my works that I'm gonna that I'm gonna make more money but it's because of Revelation that God has given me that I need to work and if I sow I'm going to reap according to the word not according to Danny's ability all the gifts that you have that God has given you to to to uh to to build Financial wealth those are gifts that God has given you and you need to exercise those gifts as you receive the revelation of the gift of prosperity in your life you will automatically manifest it in your works so if you want to be successful and you have an understanding of sowing and reaping you're not going to go into work and you're not going to turn around to the boss and say hey I need a raise what's the matter with you don't you know I work hard what kind of a boss are you you should be ashamed of yourself you're not paying me enough you can be out of a job a lot quicker than you're going to be in a job you see understanding that that that God gives you a job God provides for you then you are not going to be there going against the grain you're there to work you're there to be a blessing to that business you have the anointing of Joseph on your life as a son or a daughter of God that wherever you go you prosper that's the Revelation that you should have and so when you go to work and you go to work for somebody it's not him that's the boss it's him that holds a position and a certain level of authority but God is the boss God is the one that's paying you through that boss through that company it is your position to get in there and to do and to give all that you possibly can in order to benefit the business and when you do your best when you when you go in and you and you and you focus on what you're getting paid for and do it to the best of your ability you will get raises you will get promotions you will get moved on to other possible uh companies and careers and opportunities because it's God that giveth and it is God that taketh it's as simple as that so see how it works can be different when you have a revelation that it is You by faith being led by the spirit of God knowing that he is the one that's that's providing all the opportunity for you he opens the doors he shuts the doors I believe in good works even if a man is not saved he ought to do good works and do the best he can yes sir if you're a Christian you are doing you are going to do what is right your Works will show that your heart is right and it won't be something that you put on for you will do his will when no one but God sees you you don't have to worry about the boss seeing you but be aware of God seeing you God overshadowing you God opening the doors around you God shutting the doors around you God moving on your your boss to give you a raise God moving uh in your home to bless your children God moving in your family to to open their understanding and and to give them the understanding of this wonderful gift that God has placed in you amen God sees you and you will do his will even if it costs you your life next slide and Jesus come to do was to get these all Jesus come to do was to get these that the father foreknew and predestinated them before the foundations of the world to become Sons and Daughters of God the whole purpose of the whole Plan of Salvation the whole purpose of Christmas because remember it's all surrounding the birth of Jesus Christ but it's not so much his birth it was more about his death about him dying for your sins his birth has a great significance in that he became flesh in order to take our place as a human being so that we could receive salvation from this human dimension remember he didn't have to do that he didn't have to do that but because of his plan and because of his word and and and the whole Plan of Redemption that he he put into motion It produced a Calvary It produced where he had to come but the whole purpose was that he could come and get us redeem us give us that that special gift amen not him that runeth or him that willeth but God that showeth Mercy it is God that does it you can't brag at all there's not a thing that you did God by Grace saved you not you yourself if you do you got something to brag about but you haven't nothing to break all Praises go to him it's him and then he gives you this sure hope swore by an oath the impossibility for his children to ever be lost can you imagine like could there be a greater gift than the gift of Salvation that once you have that revelation of it you can never be lost your future is clear you could be facing listen we all got to deal with the conditions and the circumstances of this life no matter what brother Brian right we gotta deal with the circumstances the situations we got to go through school as young people and we got to study and we've got to get degrees and we've got to go through all those things and I know the anxiety used to oh man I couldn't take School you know like I I didn't like exams I don't you know like I just that was just me right where like everybody's different but I know the kind of pressure that you young people have to deal with you know to get you know uh especially in this day in society that we're living in where you know you know without without a really decent education you know there's not much opportunity you know it's a lot of pressure foreign sister the whole thing is Grace it's all Grace Saints you got to deal with these situations in your life and all these circumstances but let me tell you something grace is there for you to get you through it Grace will get you through whatever it is that you're dealing with right now and what you will have to deal with tomorrow it's all all of it is Grace it's not what you do anyhow it's what he's already done for you now you can't do one thing to Merit your salvation your salvation is a great gift Christ became sin that you might become righteous but then you've got the legalists and you've got those that believe oh no no no no no I gotta do in order to get the law the legalists see brother Brown speaking here in Hebrews uh you have to do this if you don't do this you're not a Christian and if you don't keep the Sabbath if you don't if you eat meat if you do these things all these legal ideas you've got to go to church if you don't you pay a penalty for it you have to do a novena that stuff is nonsense you're saved by the grace of God by the foreknowledge of God by his predestination by his predestination not saying oh I'm going to save Mike I'm not going to save Jack I'm going to save David I'm not going to save Jill no that's not the way God did it God by his foreknowledge could predestinate because he knew by his foreknowledge that when the word would come to his attribute his attribute would respond he knew that it would say Amen to the word of God he knew that you would recognize the word for your day he knew that you would that that when you heard the word and you can't explain why it is that you believe this message you can't explain something like that because it's revelation it's given to you so by his foreknowledge knowing that his attributes he put them out there and he didn't put out I'll just put out a thousand oh no maybe I'll make it 1200 or no maybe I'll make it a million or no no maybe no he knew exactly how many he knew so much that he placed our names in a book before we even came here in The lab's Book of Life and he knew that you would respond and say amen God called Abraham by predestination by foreknowledge he called he hated Esau and loved Jacob before either one was born you see this is all the gift of God there's no greater gift Saints this gift of Salvation is something that you never deserved we don't deserve it I need you this year at Christmas to go out there and tell people about this gift there's no greater gift that's right it's God's foreknowledge that knows these things and so why do we need to preach you say then what's the use of preaching the gospel if God knows everything God already knows that you know that that you know that you're saved and that you're saved that you're lost that you're saved if God like then why why are we going through this why does brother Danny even need to be here tonight to preach the word of God well listen to what the prophet says what's the use of preaching the gospel now I'll say this I'll say to you this Paul answered that or Jesus did rather here's Jesus he said the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a man that went to do this a pond or a lake and thrown in the net he pulled in out of there he had Turtles he had Terrapins he had serpents he had lizards he had frogs he had spiders he had scavengers and he had fish genuine fish next now the man's just sinning is when you take a net and you're just you know you put it out there and then you're pulling it in you put the nut out and then you're pulling it in and that's what the preaching of the Gospel is I'm preaching the gospel I just throw the net as we assemble ourselves as we go out there this year at Christmas and we start to testify about our experience with God our gift that God has given us as we're talking to the people and as we're telling them about God's Great salvation about God's foreknowledge about God's election about the attributes of God and how that if you're a son or a daughter of God you always were a son or daughter of God it's not by works and by you going to church this year at Christmas you know those those few days of the year that you go to that you go to church that's not what the gift is all about that's not what salvation is all about as you're doing that you're doing the same thing you're sinning you're you're throwing the net out you don't know where God's attributes are gonna raise up all all of a sudden you don't realize that that they could be right within your own household they could be within your family they could be at work they could be wherever you are and as you are experiencing as you're talking about this great gift that God has given you you are sinning you are you are you are uh seen where God's word is going to call another attribute and give them that that experience that you had when you first received the word of God all that whosoever let him come here comes some up at the altar they all hang around the altar they pray they cry I don't know one from the other we can't be I can't be in here saying oh you're saved you're not you're saved you're not you're saved we can't do that that's foolishness you know sometimes you get to to fellowshipping and you know you get talking and oh this brother they ain't got the Holy Ghost this sister she doesn't have the Holy Ghost this one's got the Holy Ghost this what that what's that got to do with you you got to deal with your own salvation with fear and trembling just love them be there for them fellowship with them pray with them everybody's got a portion of faith not everybody is going to have the same you know portion of Faith everybody's got different portions not everybody has the same part in the body one Revelation is enough to take you in the rapture because the the Rapture is a revelation so it's not about trying to figure out who's saved and who's not even when you're out there with your friends that are in the world don't put any interpretation on them imagine if they had to put an interpretation on you I know that if somebody hadn't looked at my life and put an interpretation on me 30 years ago they would have said no way no chance that they could possibly be a son of God but God had different plans God's choices are not our choices God's ways are not our ways we leave the Salvation up to the Lord we leave the giving of the gift to the Lord he's the one that gives and nobody can take away Hallelujah so but there's some in there that's frogs there's some that's lizards there's some that snakes it's some that's Turtles and there's some that's fish it's not my business to judge I say father here's what I pulled out Hallelujah but the enemy well he's got different plans Satan is out there putting all these doctrines telling the people it's all about Santa Claus it's not about Santa Claus it's about Jesus Christ you see putting all these lies before the people and it all sounds so nice oh Santa Claus I'm making a list uh uh you know making it twice he's checking to see if you're naughty or nice I mean it sounds all good but it's not the truth the the truth is that the true gift is Christ and the salvation of of your attribute being awakened to the revelation of Who You Are but the enemy listen Revelations 13 6 and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God to blaspheme his name and his Tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven and it was given unto him to make war with the Saints and to overcome them and power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and Nations and all a l l that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from before the foundation of the world so all the conditions around us and all the commercialization of Christmas and all the talk of Santa Claus is coming to town and all these things it's all a great big deception but it's not that we're going to go out there and we're going to blast the people and tell them about you know oh you're you're deceived you know Christmas you know your Christmas tree it's of the devil you know doing this and doing that no it's not it's paganism okay and people that are not Sons and Daughters of God that are just living in this world this is their Paradise that's their Joy that's their celebration that's their experience it's not up to us to go and condemn them when that's what they know and that's what they believe it's up to us to live the faith and the Salvation And the gift of God that's been given to us and to be a light and an example of his love and to show his grace remember it's by grace that you were saved it's not of your works so it's not because of their works that they're lost it's not because of their works that they're lost it's because of unbelief once salvation comes and once it's revealed to them the truth about Jesus Christ about the true worship of Christ that Christmas is the worship of Jesus Christ it's not about worshiping lights and trees and and and festivals and celebrations although we can do those things I want to celebrate with my family at Christmas but when we sit down to eat we pray and my family knows it and and and we pray and we we pray for them and we pray and we show the love of God and we get we bring gifts there's nothing wrong with giving gifts when you've got a true revelation of of of giving it's a wonderful thing it's more blessed to give than it is to receive but when it's being done by tradition and being done because you think that that that that's the true Christmas then you're missing out on the greatest gift listen we're concluding now brother Bram says so I appreciate all your prayers and by God's help and Grace a very Merry Christmas to every one of you remember my saying this is not Santa Claus this is Jesus you see Christmas Means Christ and we're writing last night showing the kitties all the houses decorated and everything which is awful nice brother Branham would take his kids show them the Christmas lights the kids would love it I've been to some light shows and some Christmas light you know extravaganzas I'm sure you've you've seen them out there they're beautiful they're amazing you know the the manger scene and and the three kings and and the way they can you know is put out all those lights that's a great Revelation to you when you're looking at that you're seeing it for what it really is you're seeing the revelation of those three kings that they were being led by the spirit of God to go and meet with Jesus Christ you see the revelation of the of a child being born in a manger God hiding himself in Simplicity he could have come and he could have come with with a host of angels come to the Earth and announced his coming in a supernatural way but he did it as a gift to the world in a child wrapped in swaddling cloths Christmas Means Christ and we were riding last night and the kitties all houses decorated everything which is awful nice but I thought if I ever had on anything on my house that I ever wanted to write would be a neon sign trusting Christ will be in your Christmas that's right put Christ back into Christmas the next slide now if you'll bow your heads again I want to wish each one of you a Merry Christmas may the great Christmas present the first one and only and the original and the only one there is Jesus Christ be afresh in your heart tonight May the Holy Spirit come to you and bring you ministering gifts and things from God that you a gift that you might live a better life praise God come ahead Michelle amen praise God could we have possibly received any greater gift Saints than the gift and the revelation of our salvation simple message tonight but it's something that the Lord led me you know to just you know to just emphasize this gift that he's given us this tremendous gift of the ability to receive divine revelation praise God let us bow our heads our gracious father Lord Jesus we just so appreciate your presence tonight Lord and the simplicity father to just reiterate this wonderful gift of Salvation that you've given us Lord to know father that the world is moving into this time in the season where all they think about is giving gifts but Lord if there's one thing that we can do is we can share this wonderful gift that you've given us with our friends our loved ones our families Lord use us this Christmas use us to be a light to be an example and to serve you in the power of your Resurrection Lord we give you thanks we give you praise in Jesus Christ's name amen go ahead David it's one song If it wasn't for the grace of God [Music] for the grace
