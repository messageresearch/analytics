[25:00] read a little lengthy scriptures here
[25:02] amen we get we have scriptures for today
[25:06] we have Noah's message Noah's message is
[25:09] great and there are scriptures in the
[25:11] Bible that are great and it's all the
[25:14] word of God right just like there's
[25:17] quotes in the message and it's all the
[25:20] word of God but there's a lot of
[25:22] scriptures for our day
[25:24] that's what brings us faith that is
[25:27] being fulfilled in this day it's just
[25:29] like the message God sent a 20 a 20th
[25:32] century Prophet right and we have many
[25:35] many quotes but some of those quotes are
[25:37] for brother Graham's day some of the
[25:39] scriptures are for Noah's day but then
[25:42] there's a lot of scriptures for us
[25:44] there's quotes that relate to us in our
[25:47] day and that's what's going to bring us
[25:49] faith when they open up to us amen and
[25:52] as ministers we got to break in to those
[25:55] the spirit of God to bring the word for
[25:58] our day what what is our day today our
[26:03] day is perfect Faith amen perfect
[26:06] realization of who we are amen and
[26:09] that's what the seed does when it wakens
[26:11] up Ephesians 1 3.
[26:16] blessed be the God and father of our
[26:19] Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us
[26:21] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[26:24] places in Christ according as he has
[26:27] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[26:30] of the world that we should be holy and
[26:33] Without Blame before him in love
[26:36] having predestinated us unto the
[26:39] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[26:41] himself according to his good pleasure
[26:44] of his will amen he has chosen us I mean
[26:48] we read this we read this but when it's
[26:50] quickened to us is a different story
[26:53] it's a different reaction and brings
[26:56] life to us we see here that he has
[26:59] chosen us we've heard this over and over
[27:02] and over and that he has predestinated
[27:05] us
[27:06] now
[27:07] listen closely and keep that in mind as
[27:10] we go through here
[27:12] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[27:15] wherein he had made us accepted in the
[27:17] Beloved in whom we have Redemption
[27:20] through his blood and forgiveness of
[27:22] sins according to the riches of his
[27:24] grace
[27:25] wherein he had abound towards us in all
[27:28] wisdom and Prudence Heaven may know and
[27:32] unto us the mystery of his will
[27:35] according to his good pleasure he had
[27:39] which he had purposed in himself
[27:42] that in the disposition of the fullness
[27:45] of times he might gather together in one
[27:49] all things in Christ both which are in
[27:52] heaven and which are in Earth even in
[27:54] him in whom also we have obtained an
[27:58] inheritance being predestinated
[28:01] according to the purpose of him who
[28:04] worketh all things after the counsel of
[28:07] his own will
[28:08] that we should be to the praise His
[28:12] glory who first trusted in Christ in
[28:16] whom ye also trusted after that ye heard
[28:20] the word of Truth The Gospel of your
[28:22] salvation in whom also after you believe
[28:26] were sealed with the Holy Spirit of
[28:28] Promise which is the earnest of our
[28:31] inheritance until the Redemption of the
[28:33] purchased possession unto the praise of
[28:36] his glory wherein I also after I heard
[28:39] of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love
[28:43] to All Saints cease not to give thanks
[28:45] making mention of you in my prayers that
[28:49] the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the
[28:51] father of Glory may give unto you
[28:53] the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in
[28:57] the knowledge of him that the eyes of
[29:01] your understanding be enlightened that
[29:04] you may know what is the hope of his
[29:06] calling and the riches of his glory of
[29:10] his inheritance in the Saints and what
[29:13] is exceeding greatness of his power to
[29:16] us word who believe according to the
[29:20] working of his mighty power
[29:23] wow there's a lot wrapped up up in there
[29:28] but but what's wrapped up in there is us
[29:31] and him it's the promises that he has
[29:34] given us the assurance that all that he
[29:38] has called will come Amen in this hour
[29:44] Hallelujah
[29:45] Romans 8
[29:49] 1.
[29:53] now we're talking about the seed that
[29:55] has awakened
[30:00] in this hour
[30:02] there is therefore no now no
[30:05] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[30:08] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[30:12] after the spirit
[30:13] for the law of the spirit of life in
[30:17] Christ Jesus had made me free from the
[30:21] law of sin and death
[30:23] for what the law could not do in that it
[30:26] was weak through the flesh God sent in
[30:29] his own son in the likeness of sinful
[30:31] flesh for the sin condemns sin in the
[30:35] flesh that the righteousness of the law
[30:38] might be fulfilled in us who walk not
[30:41] after the flesh but after the spirit
[30:44] for they that are after The Flesh do
[30:47] mind the things of the flesh but they
[30:50] that are after the spirit the things of
[30:52] the spirit for to be carnally minded is
[30:56] death
[30:57] but to be spiritually minded is life and
[30:59] peace because the carnal mind is at
[31:02] enmity against God for it is not subject
[31:05] to the law of God neither indeed can be
[31:09] then they that are in the flesh cannot
[31:13] please God but Yea are not
[31:16] but ye are not in the flesh you see he's
[31:20] talking to a Pacific people here
[31:23] ye are not in the flesh but in the
[31:26] spirit now listen
[31:28] four times he says in the next couple of
[31:30] verses here's if
[31:33] and that's a big if
[31:35] if so be that the spirit of God dwell in
[31:39] you
[31:40] now if any man have not the spirit of
[31:43] Christ he is none of his and if Christ
[31:46] be in you the body is dead because of
[31:50] sin but the spirit is life because of
[31:54] righteousness but if the spirit of him
[31:57] that raise up Jesus from the dead dwell
[32:00] in you
[32:01] he that raised Christ from the dead
[32:03] shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by
[32:07] the spirit that dwelleth in you God
[32:09] bless you as you seated
[32:11] if the spirit
[32:13] dwells in you it will Quicken your
[32:17] mortal bodies by The Same Spirit that
[32:20] dwells in you
[32:23] Hallelujah
[32:26] you know when I read these scriptures
[32:27] and I read the word of God
[32:30] I I come to realize
[32:34] that
[32:36] that is not me
[32:38] as the scripture says my flesh is weak
[32:43] I could not serve God by my flesh I
[32:46] cannot serve God by my carnal mind
[32:49] and and I I look at the elements right I
[32:54] look at my weaknesses and I look at all
[32:56] these things
[32:57] and and if that's what you're looking at
[32:59] you can never serve God you can never
[33:03] look into the scriptures and what is
[33:04] Promised in this hour and this day to
[33:07] the Bride of Jesus Christ and say how
[33:09] can I live that
[33:11] because it's not us that lives it it's
[33:13] not it's the seed of God it's the
[33:16] attribute that God allotted for us in
[33:18] this age
[33:19] he allotted a word for every age we look
[33:23] at justification we look at
[33:25] sanctification we look at the baptism of
[33:27] the Holy Ghost those were seas that were
[33:30] allotted for that day and that age and
[33:33] they produced that
[33:35] you're looking you look go back Luther
[33:38] produced justification
[33:41] Wesley produced sanctification in the
[33:44] people
[33:45] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the day of
[33:47] Pentecost those genuine seeds produce
[33:51] the scriptures
[33:53] it wasn't a fake uh uh religious uh uh
[33:59] uh false interpretation life it was
[34:01] genuine lives that was that the seed was
[34:05] producing in their day and their age
[34:07] well we have a seed that was released in
[34:11] our day today
[34:13] and and only
[34:16] only that seed like brother Brown's seen
[34:18] the vision of the woman walking up she
[34:21] was justified she was Sanctified she had
[34:23] the baptism of the Holy Ghost she has
[34:25] gifts in their life
[34:27] but she left off one word what the word
[34:30] for the day for today
[34:33] and he's seen her fallen into the pits
[34:35] of hell
[34:36] because we have a word that is allotted
[34:39] for our day today my brothers and
[34:42] sisters that we must come into amen come
[34:46] into the understanding the enlightenment
[34:48] into it
[34:49] Hallelujah
[34:55] he breaks the seals and reveals and
[34:58] gives us an inheritance to his people
[35:01] he gives the inheritance that he inherit
[35:04] becoming Kinsmen Redeemer and he freely
[35:07] gives it out to us It All Belongs to him
[35:12] he was the one who redeemed oh
[35:16] the it's these seals opening up just
[35:19] beginning to reveal the Plan of
[35:22] Redemption how he did it Paul told us in
[35:25] the first chapter of Ephesians that God
[35:27] before the foundation of the world had
[35:30] predestinated us unto the adoptions of
[35:33] sons through Jesus Christ and John tells
[35:36] us here in the Book of Revelations that
[35:38] in the last days there will be religious
[35:41] people amongst us Cults and
[35:43] organizations amongst us that would try
[35:46] to deceive the very elected if it were
[35:48] possible but it's not when you look at
[35:50] the even look at that quote it's not the
[35:54] religious people out there
[35:56] that's going to deceive the very elect
[35:58] or try
[35:59] if it were possible it's right here
[36:02] it's here where where they're not
[36:05] preaching right present truth being
[36:09] established because the seed can only
[36:12] feed Amen on present truth that's why
[36:16] you don't feed off of a man you don't
[36:19] feed off of me or any Minister you feed
[36:21] off of him the spirit that brings
[36:24] present truth and that's what testifies
[36:28] it doesn't matter how educated you are
[36:30] how well of a Preacher you are it's the
[36:34] spirit inside that brings life
[36:37] that testifies
[36:40] God will always confirm where he's
[36:44] and where he's moving
[36:46] by what by bringing life
[36:50] perfect Faith awakens the seed of God in
[36:54] us
[36:55] in this hour perfect faith is God's tool
[36:59] that he uses to lift the veil of
[37:02] spiritual amnesia
[37:06] in each age there's a lot at word
[37:09] the word of God is a seed in this age
[37:12] the Seven Seals being opened and the
[37:15] Mysteries being revealed to the bride
[37:18] this faith is perfect and complete
[37:22] people that don't believe that the seals
[37:24] have been opened
[37:26] they don't realize when the seals were
[37:28] open the lamb opened the seals he spoke
[37:32] and when he spoke he spoke those seeds
[37:35] and those seeds are here tonight on the
[37:38] earth they are growing they are
[37:40] manifesting and they are coming into
[37:43] maturity
[37:44] to fulfill all that is promised to the
[37:48] bride
[37:50] see the bride doesn't waver
[37:54] the bride is not lukewarm and lazy and
[37:56] locked
[37:57] no she's not
[37:59] she's like Abraham's faith
[38:02] no matter how long she's waiting in
[38:04] certain areas of her life she knows God
[38:07] is going to fulfill his promise and
[38:09] bring forth the word
[38:12] and there's a promise to the Bride of
[38:14] Jesus Christ in these last days
[38:18] that he's going to fulfill
[38:21] you see this Faith to the bride is
[38:23] perfect and complete it brings perfect
[38:25] realization and everything the bride
[38:28] needs to overcome and it reveals the new
[38:32] birth for this hour and being under this
[38:36] birth brings a full manifestation of
[38:39] Christ in her
[38:42] I'm trying to get into the get into the
[38:46] thought of this amen bring in the real
[38:50] birth in this hour
[38:53] my
[38:54] so many different births Brother Brad
[38:57] I'm talking in the rising of the Sun
[39:00] he says dead seeds
[39:03] he said oh God don't let there be dead
[39:05] seeds amongst us but let there be seeds
[39:09] that will come to life
[39:13] eternal life
[39:20] all these things are just mirrored
[39:22] traditions
[39:24] what good would it do whether you had
[39:27] lent or not lent if there's no life in
[39:30] you
[39:32] it's only a memorial
[39:34] which there's nothing against it
[39:37] but they have certainly carried out
[39:39] their traditions
[39:40] but left off the main thing
[39:43] I wonder
[39:46] man is always that way
[39:49] until the Holy Ghost comes in the man's
[39:51] life
[39:53] carrying out traditions
[39:57] traditions in the message
[39:59] traditions in their life
[40:03] but if there's no life there
[40:06] now listen
[40:08] Satan doesn't care how religious you are
[40:10] or how right you are in your Doctrine
[40:15] if you miss that life you won't come up
[40:18] anyhow
[40:20] no matter how religious how good how
[40:23] many churches you belong to or will
[40:25] belong to how many churches you jump
[40:28] around to thinking oh I'm going to go to
[40:31] this message church I'm going to go the
[40:33] words over here in this message Church
[40:35] the words over here in this message are
[40:37] jumping
[40:38] jumping back and forth
[40:41] what what does any of that have to do
[40:43] with anything
[40:45] what does any Traditions have to do with
[40:47] anything
[40:48] it's the life
[40:50] it's the life in the sea
[40:53] has to be in there
[40:55] and that's what's coming to The Showdown
[40:58] in this hour
[40:59] that's what's coming into perfect faith
[41:02] and perfect realization and Rapture in
[41:04] faith in this hour in the bride that's
[41:07] what God is going to show off in this
[41:09] hour
[41:11] that's short quick work has been
[41:14] preparing that seed has been growing in
[41:18] the ground being nurtured by Water by
[41:20] Rain by the moisture of the Holy Ghost
[41:23] by trials Temptations and deaths
[41:26] and it's coming to that place in this
[41:28] hour
[41:34] it doesn't matter one thing unless you
[41:36] have been born again
[41:41] when we look deeply at our own spiritual
[41:45] lives we can see the image of the seed
[41:51] this is a great analogy for the
[41:54] spiritual path on so many levels
[41:57] everything we need for Spiritual
[41:59] Awakening is contained
[42:02] within each
[42:04] of us
[42:06] in the seed the very blueprint of
[42:09] enlight enlightenment
[42:11] Made In His Image all we need to do is
[42:15] water the seed of the soul and do
[42:18] everything we can to support its growth
[42:21] by making choices one after another that
[42:25] places the seed in water and in light
[42:28] and in Divine substance of his presence
[42:32] that's how we do it
[42:34] making choices
[42:36] one after another
[42:40] feeding that life
[42:42] and that's what the bride is doing in
[42:44] this hour
[42:46] that's what the spirit inside the True
[42:48] Believer
[42:49] is do it in this hour she's making
[42:52] choices one after another not to not to
[42:55] satisfy the pleasures of the flesh
[42:58] not to satisfy the carnal mind
[43:01] she knows the difference between she
[43:03] knows the two like Paul says he says oh
[43:06] Wretched Man that I am
[43:07] he knew the difference between The
[43:09] Wretched Man and the man Christ Jesus
[43:12] inside of him
[43:14] he knew that he was redeemed he knew
[43:17] that he he had the Holy Spirit the new
[43:19] birth inside of him
[43:21] he knew he was predestinated
[43:23] for a purpose
[43:27] knowing that is the most important thing
[43:30] when she recognizes who she is knowing
[43:34] who she is amen and all so many
[43:38] different levels knowing who she is in
[43:40] her life that's what's consuming the
[43:43] Bride of Jesus Christ in this hour that
[43:45] she's being possessed and consumed by
[43:48] the revelation of who she is in this
[43:51] hour
[43:52] that she's not up and what does it do
[43:54] when when Revelation comes it does two
[43:57] things that exposes Satan and it reveals
[43:59] God it exposes the Flesh and it reveals
[44:02] the seed of God inside of her and it re
[44:05] it exposes all the works of her flesh
[44:07] I'm talking about you personally in your
[44:09] life and it reveals the spirit of God
[44:11] when the spirit of God is pleased when
[44:14] you're walking and moving by faith
[44:16] amen
[44:19] you see in Galatians 5 6.
[44:22] it says this
[44:24] this I say then walk in the spirit that
[44:26] you you shall not fulfill the lust of
[44:28] the flesh for the lust of the flesh
[44:31] lusted against the spirit and the spirit
[44:34] against the flesh and these are contrary
[44:36] one to another so yea cannot do the
[44:39] things that you would but if you be led
[44:42] of the spirit you are not under the law
[44:45] in Romans 12 1 I beseech you therefore
[44:48] Brethren by the mercies of God that you
[44:51] present your bodies a Living Sacrifice
[44:53] holy and acceptable unto God which is
[44:56] your reasonable service and be not
[44:59] conformed to this world but be
[45:02] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[45:04] that you may prove what is good and
[45:07] acceptable perfect will of God
[45:10] amen
[45:12] I know we read these scriptures we've
[45:15] been reading them for 10 20 30 years
[45:18] and and and uh these these scriptures
[45:22] amen they come alive more and more the
[45:27] word has to meet the challenge of the
[45:29] age the word has to meet and raise like
[45:33] the Bible's brother Brown said when the
[45:36] enemy comes in as a flood God will raise
[45:39] the standard what he'll make the word
[45:42] more real to you in other words
[45:44] personally in your individual lives God
[45:47] will come and make that word more real
[45:50] amen he will show you he will show you
[45:55] like he said right there he'll show you
[45:56] how to present your body a Living
[45:58] Sacrifice
[46:00] he'll raise a standard
[46:03] as you walk and as you grow it'll
[46:05] constantly grow with you the seed will
[46:08] grow the plant will grow and it comes
[46:11] out of the seed and it produces what
[46:13] it's supposed to produce in this hour
[46:16] Hallelujah
[46:17] it will constantly be showing you
[46:19] where you're being conformed to this
[46:21] world you see God could not show you
[46:24] everything when you first come in
[46:25] they couldn't it would kill you
[46:28] you can never live but here we are 30
[46:32] years later amen the Bride come into a
[46:35] place in her maturity in this hour where
[46:38] God can show her deep things that
[46:41] separates her
[46:43] that he can have the preemus in her life
[46:46] and he can possess her
[46:49] but you got to be willing
[46:51] you got to be willing
[46:54] that's all you have to do is be willing
[46:56] to yield Your Vessel and become under
[46:58] obedience as we're going to see here
[47:02] there was the first sheath come up from
[47:05] all the prophets which was the son of
[47:07] God and the king of all the prophets
[47:10] there there has been churches and
[47:12] churches and there have been brides and
[47:15] Brides but there has to come a real
[47:18] bride
[47:20] there has to come a real bride it's
[47:23] spoken and already prophesied by the
[47:25] prophet in this hour
[47:30] there must come one that's not only got
[47:32] the mechanics the word
[47:34] word word word word I got the word I got
[47:37] the word you got to line up with the
[47:38] word word word
[47:40] it's not just the mechanics
[47:42] but it's the Dynamics is when the
[47:45] Dynamics the spark hits the gasoline
[47:48] amen and produces amen the power that's
[47:52] going to run through the engine the
[47:54] power that's going to move that car move
[47:57] that life inside of you what good is it
[47:59] if you got word word when you don't got
[48:02] any life inside of you
[48:04] you need to life
[48:06] you'd eat the spark in the gasoline to
[48:10] bring forth the life
[48:11] to bring forth the power that will cause
[48:14] you to overcome and become what he said
[48:16] that you are
[48:18] and what he said that you are
[48:25] that makes the church live and move in
[48:27] the power of his resurrection until we
[48:30] come to that place
[48:32] until we find that place
[48:35] until we come to that place in our
[48:38] individual walks in our experience
[48:41] until we come to that place what good
[48:44] does it do to polish the hubs what good
[48:46] does it do for her to give herself a
[48:49] facelift what good is it will it do to
[48:51] wear long hair long dress
[48:54] act polite
[48:56] all those things are respected but what
[48:59] good does it do
[49:03] nothing
[49:05] unless there's life in there
[49:10] that don't mean nothing in this day and
[49:12] age my brothers and sisters
[49:14] that through the Bride of Jesus Christ
[49:16] all this religious
[49:19] Acts
[49:20] all this Pious Acts
[49:23] is all becoming dead to her
[49:26] there's nothing to her
[49:28] it doesn't even move her anymore
[49:30] because she's lifted way above that
[49:34] you know we we always justify ourselves
[49:37] you know to try to not make ourselves
[49:39] look like anything but in reality we are
[49:42] something which God says I'm something
[49:44] I'm something
[49:47] yeah I'm not gonna I'm not gonna just
[49:49] belittle myself
[49:50] but all these things all these these
[49:53] religious acts and all these religious
[49:55] uh formal Traditions that people are
[49:57] doing are nothing
[49:59] because the Bride of Jesus Christ is
[50:01] moving and operating in his life
[50:05] he's in hurt revealing himself
[50:08] he she knows and and only she knows more
[50:11] than anybody else that she is nothing
[50:14] you don't have to tell her that she's
[50:15] nothing
[50:16] you don't have to tell her that she
[50:18] can't do nothing without him
[50:20] but you know why because she doesn't do
[50:22] anything without him more and more
[50:24] because he's possessing her life the
[50:27] seed of God that's inside of her is
[50:30] coming to such a place my brothers and
[50:32] sisters in this hour that is taking
[50:34] control of her Is possessing her
[50:39] we're in such an hour that we're living
[50:41] in look at the word that's coming forth
[50:42] look at the the maturity of the word
[50:45] that's coming forth
[50:48] that is being spoken
[50:50] it's showing something
[50:52] it's showing me personally me where I'm
[50:56] at in my walk where I'm at on my
[50:59] maturity with Christ
[51:00] it should be showing you the same thing
[51:04] now I'm not going to sit here say if
[51:06] it's not showing you the same thing if
[51:07] you don't feel this you feel that come
[51:09] to the Altar and pray and all that stuff
[51:10] that's a day gone past that's not in
[51:13] this day and hour
[51:15] this out this hour listen
[51:18] this hour is where where the bride the
[51:22] seeds of God are coming into maturity
[51:25] and all the other seeds they're coming
[51:27] into their position in place too
[51:30] everything is coming into their place in
[51:32] their position
[51:34] I'm not going to here to convince you oh
[51:36] you're gonna you need the Holy Ghost
[51:37] come up here and we'll pray for you and
[51:39] you'll get the Holy Ghost come and sit
[51:40] in the altar come fast and pray for
[51:42] hours and days read your Bible come to
[51:45] church every service and you'll get the
[51:47] Holy Ghost that's not the hour we're
[51:48] living in anymore
[51:50] that's not the hour my brothers and
[51:52] sisters
[51:53] that's not going to do it in this hour
[52:03] what good would it do if there's no
[52:05] Dynamics in it
[52:07] no matter how much the mechanics prove
[52:09] to be right there got to be Dynamics to
[52:12] make it work
[52:13] that's what Easter proved he was not
[52:17] only the word but he was God himself the
[52:20] Dynamics in the word
[52:21] I am he that was dead so dead to the son
[52:24] said he was dead the moon said he was
[52:26] dead the Stars said he was dead all
[52:28] nature said he was dead and now the
[52:31] whole world's got to recognize that he
[52:33] is alive again
[52:34] and it can only be the manifestation of
[52:37] the Fulfillment of all the revelations
[52:39] any other has spoken of the Bride of
[52:42] Jesus Christ
[52:43] that's what's going to happen in this
[52:45] day and age
[52:47] just like they have to recognize that he
[52:49] was dead they had to recognize that he
[52:52] was alive
[52:54] they're going to have to recognize the
[52:56] Bride of Jesus Christ in this hour
[52:59] the world's going to recognize the
[53:01] Masters is going to recognize that it's
[53:04] because it's him that is living it's not
[53:07] her it's him and her
[53:09] that's going to manifest
[53:12] is the same scriptures going to be
[53:15] fulfilled again
[53:17] in her
[53:19] we've heard the quotes over and over
[53:21] again I can quote and quote and quote
[53:25] the son of man being revealed in Bride
[53:28] form
[53:29] oh my brothers it's all sounds good all
[53:32] the Mysteries you can have all Faith to
[53:34] move mountains it's not about faith
[53:36] faith doesn't save you it's not about
[53:38] knowing all the Mysteries
[53:40] as predestination
[53:42] is is God putting a seed a allotted word
[53:45] we call it a seed of God an attribute of
[53:47] God because the word of God is a seed
[53:49] inside of you and not coming to life and
[53:52] revealing to you as an individual
[53:54] saves you you're not saved on some day
[53:58] you're not saved on some year you're not
[54:00] saved on some preacher that came and
[54:02] preached a dynamic Revival or you came
[54:05] to the altar
[54:06] you're eternal
[54:09] you were there before the foundation of
[54:12] the world
[54:13] you're Eternal as much as God is eternal
[54:16] but Faith Comes as a tool it opens up
[54:19] your Enlightenment it opens up the door
[54:21] it breaks the spiritual Amnesia upon
[54:23] your life to make you recognize that you
[54:25] are a son and daughter of God and it
[54:28] constantly being revealed to you and
[54:29] being revealed to you
[54:31] that you are over and over again
[54:38] it can only manifest it does something
[54:40] different from the groom it isn't the
[54:43] bride because she is flesh of his flesh
[54:46] and bone of his bone and life of his
[54:48] life and power of his power she is him
[54:53] until you come to that place of perfect
[54:56] faith
[54:58] wow
[55:01] you will
[55:02] you will you hear you hear preaching
[55:04] like this you hear quotes like this and
[55:06] you think in your mind you know your
[55:07] mind starts playing tricks on you until
[55:09] I come to that place
[55:11] no you know when I hear that when I hear
[55:13] the preaching like that being brought
[55:15] forth like that
[55:16] I say to myself the seed of God inside
[55:19] of me will come to that place I believe
[55:21] it I accept it I know it's being
[55:24] revealed to me and it's going to
[55:25] manifest
[55:27] you can't do nothing
[55:29] you can't how can how can we or or
[55:33] anybody bring forth this life it's his
[55:37] life he brings it forth
[55:42] amen
[55:46] Faith can't save anybody faith is a tool
[55:49] that opens up
[55:50] your understandings to see that you're
[55:52] predestinated and the place inside of
[55:54] you
[55:56] which saves
[55:58] you Faith opens the door for you to
[56:00] recognize that and it breaks the
[56:02] spiritual Amnesia on your life and you
[56:04] recognize that you see James 2 14 what
[56:08] do it profit my brethren though a man
[56:10] say he has faith and have not works can
[56:13] Faith save him even so if a man had not
[56:17] works is dead being alone yea a man say
[56:21] that thou have faith and I have Works
[56:23] show me thy faith without thy works and
[56:26] I will show you my faith by my works
[56:30] thou believe is that there is one God
[56:32] thou doest well but the Devils also
[56:35] believe in tremble and what he's saying
[56:37] in there you know I believe God I
[56:39] believe the message I believe God sent a
[56:41] prophet so does the devil
[56:43] the devil believes all that everything
[56:45] that most people in this message are
[56:47] believing amen and being religious right
[56:50] without this life the Devils believe
[56:52] even more
[56:54] yeah yeah people people all God said a
[56:57] prophet God said a prophet ten years
[56:59] later they walk away I don't know if
[57:00] this Prophet is real I I don't know if
[57:03] what he's saying is right not stuff let
[57:05] me tell you no matter what you say about
[57:06] any minister of God that's a true
[57:09] minister of God let me tell you the
[57:11] devil believes
[57:13] the devil knows
[57:15] more than most people know
[57:18] oh yeah he knows he knows what's real he
[57:22] knows what's life
[57:24] he I'm no match for him none of you are
[57:27] a match for him
[57:28] not one of us but I know he's no match
[57:31] for him my Lord and Savior
[57:34] oh that's what I trust in that's what I
[57:36] believe in
[57:39] and when you come to that place and the
[57:40] confidence in your life and in your walk
[57:43] and you know that you know that he's
[57:45] inside of you you know that he's there
[57:54] Hallelujah
[57:58] you see
[57:59] faith is the starting point it beckons
[58:02] us to move in obedience
[58:04] and obedience always requires action on
[58:07] our part the word tells us that it's
[58:10] impossible to please God without faith
[58:12] pleasing God happens when we have faith
[58:16] and apply it with action
[58:19] our walk of faith is a lifelong journey
[58:23] and there are two things that I know
[58:25] about it without a shadow of a doubt the
[58:28] first thing is no one else can run our
[58:31] personal race of faith
[58:33] no one it's you and you and God Alone
[58:38] you are an individual
[58:40] you got to know for yourself
[58:43] where you stand and who you are
[58:48] the second is truly walking by faith is
[58:51] not by sight
[58:53] it produces
[58:55] Eternal fruit of all which pleases God
[58:59] and brings his glory
[59:02] yes walking by faith
[59:06] is not walking by sight
[59:08] is not walking by works walking by faith
[59:12] is believing what he said like Abraham
[59:15] believe him
[59:16] look at we we we read about Abraham so
[59:20] much
[59:21] and Abraham's seed but look at Abraham's
[59:23] life
[59:24] we need to go back sometimes
[59:27] and draw faith and Power
[59:30] how Abraham believed the promises now
[59:33] our our promise is that Abraham that God
[59:36] spoke to Abraham in his day is not for
[59:39] us today
[59:40] amen
[59:42] right so we are looking at different
[59:44] promises that God is going to do
[59:48] God is going to change our body
[59:53] God is going to Rapture in all the world
[59:57] and even your flesh is against that
[59:59] truth
[1:00:01] it fights and batters against the truth
[1:00:04] amen this world is gross Darkness
[1:00:08] everything every image in this world is
[1:00:11] not the image of God
[1:00:13] the image of God is only in one place in
[1:00:17] this hour on this Earth and that's in
[1:00:20] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:00:22] and she doesn't believe in any other
[1:00:25] image but his image
[1:00:30] only his image
[1:00:33] that she believes in
[1:00:35] in this hour
[1:00:38] that's what Abraham walked by
[1:00:40] everything that came against him having
[1:00:43] a baby
[1:00:44] look at their age
[1:00:47] impossible scientifically
[1:00:50] everything that was against him but what
[1:00:52] did God do
[1:00:53] what did God do when his body
[1:00:57] deteriorated
[1:00:58] when the the everything around him
[1:01:01] deteriorated the promise looked like it
[1:01:03] was going to come to pass what did God
[1:01:05] do God changed their bodies
[1:01:10] like somebody told me I was talking to a
[1:01:12] a Muslim guy I known him for a while and
[1:01:15] we are going back and forth and back and
[1:01:17] forth and then he comes to me and says
[1:01:19] God cannot become a man
[1:01:22] and I looked I looked and I said I said
[1:01:25] who are you
[1:01:27] who is any man
[1:01:31] The God Who created the heavens and the
[1:01:33] Earth and everything that there is in
[1:01:36] that you believe that that God is
[1:01:38] Supernatural
[1:01:40] and God created the universe and
[1:01:42] everything who are you to save
[1:01:45] that God
[1:01:47] cannot become a man
[1:01:54] who are we to save who is Abraham
[1:01:57] Abraham's Faith did not stagger
[1:02:00] Abraham's Faith was perfect
[1:02:02] because you know why it was revealed to
[1:02:04] Abraham
[1:02:05] that's when Faith becomes perfect and
[1:02:07] that's the problem in this hour it's got
[1:02:10] to be revealed to you
[1:02:12] it's got to be revealed to you and made
[1:02:14] known unto you and then perfect faith
[1:02:17] comes and then confidence comes
[1:02:21] then you're walking in the power of the
[1:02:23] spirit of God then you know you can
[1:02:25] overcome
[1:02:27] then you know you're Victorious when is
[1:02:29] revealed to you until it's reveal to you
[1:02:32] you cannot walk in there
[1:02:35] I know that for myself I I make
[1:02:37] challenges all the time every time every
[1:02:40] time I overcome something there's
[1:02:42] another challenge and I know that's
[1:02:44] going to be right to the day I leave
[1:02:46] here one challenge after another don't
[1:02:50] think you're ever gonna arise you're
[1:02:52] never gonna arrive unless you arrive to
[1:02:55] the rapture
[1:02:57] the event of the Rapture that's the only
[1:02:59] thing you're going to ride to
[1:03:01] but until then from then to now is just
[1:03:04] one challenge after another
[1:03:07] and the same fate that came to you that
[1:03:10] cause you to walk is the same faith that
[1:03:13] he promised that he will give you and
[1:03:16] reveal to you every challenge that you
[1:03:19] come against
[1:03:24] it he will not fail
[1:03:27] he will not fail you
[1:03:30] oh my
[1:03:35] Hallelujah
[1:03:38] amen
[1:03:40] everything that you ask for you shall
[1:03:43] receive it if you believe it with all
[1:03:45] your heart
[1:03:46] now I'm going to ask you
[1:03:49] how can you believe it with all your
[1:03:50] heart
[1:03:52] you can't believe it with all your heart
[1:03:54] unless it's revealed to you it's got to
[1:03:56] be revealed to you
[1:03:59] I'm going to ask you upon the basis of
[1:04:01] the shed blood upon the basis knowing
[1:04:04] that you are a Christian and the promise
[1:04:06] is true if Jesus Promised life after
[1:04:09] death went forth into death and come
[1:04:12] back with life to prove it and give you
[1:04:15] life of the spirit in you and his
[1:04:19] presence here now how can it fail
[1:04:23] how can these things fail
[1:04:27] oh my
[1:04:30] oh my how many people are still
[1:04:34] under the fear of death
[1:04:38] death
[1:04:39] where Paul said death where is your
[1:04:41] sting see his faith came to a place with
[1:04:44] God
[1:04:45] right that God revealed to him that's
[1:04:48] why he could say death where is your
[1:04:50] sting grave where is your victory
[1:04:53] oh my what a revelation he had what an
[1:04:56] understanding he had
[1:04:59] that death had no power over him
[1:05:02] death has no power of you tonight
[1:05:04] if you're born again and the spirit of
[1:05:06] God lives inside of you that is gone
[1:05:09] from you
[1:05:11] death can never touch you
[1:05:14] you already died
[1:05:16] [Music]
[1:05:19] I know they're just they're just words
[1:05:21] but when they come alive in your walk in
[1:05:24] your faith in your confidence that you
[1:05:27] can walk we need this my brothers and
[1:05:29] sisters because there are challenges
[1:05:31] that we are facing now today and there's
[1:05:33] challenges that are coming upon us on
[1:05:35] this Earth that Mark of the Beast system
[1:05:37] that new world order that by I can't buy
[1:05:40] or sell all these things are coming into
[1:05:43] effect
[1:05:44] and God is building our faith to meet
[1:05:47] the challenges supernaturally to
[1:05:50] separate us into another dimension our
[1:05:52] faith into another dimension that we
[1:05:55] might have to speak things into
[1:05:57] existence we I don't know what's going
[1:05:59] to happen
[1:06:00] but I know the supernatural God can be
[1:06:03] present it's got to be present to beat
[1:06:06] and meet the challenges
[1:06:08] of that Beast system in its full power
[1:06:11] until we leave here
[1:06:13] until we leave here
[1:06:16] hey
[1:06:18] I'm telling you Manny
[1:06:20] you think people fell when Corvette hit
[1:06:23] many are going to fall
[1:06:25] that don't have their life
[1:06:28] you can't come and get this oil
[1:06:31] I just I just heard from the brothers I
[1:06:33] think brother Desmond or brother Philip
[1:06:34] were saying Down in Africa or somebody
[1:06:36] was saying that uh brother brother
[1:06:39] Christopher Christopher said that his
[1:06:41] brother went over and uh Revival broke
[1:06:43] out and there's like 10 or 15 churches
[1:06:46] Pentecostal churches that come to the
[1:06:48] message
[1:06:51] let me tell you my brothers and sisters
[1:06:54] we're not here long
[1:06:57] and this thing has been growing
[1:06:59] you can't come and get this oil
[1:07:01] you know that that is that is spoken
[1:07:04] already by the prophet that when you see
[1:07:08] those things happening and those things
[1:07:10] come into pass look up
[1:07:14] your faith
[1:07:16] is being completed your Redemption
[1:07:19] is being completed at that time when the
[1:07:23] Pentecostals start coming for this oil
[1:07:24] they're not going to get it look at the
[1:07:26] 10 fluids virgins people in this message
[1:07:28] that don't have the oil right now
[1:07:30] they're not going to get it
[1:07:32] that's the hour we're living in
[1:07:37] it oh my
[1:07:39] God oh my
[1:07:42] God hey man let's move on here
[1:07:44] Hallelujah
[1:07:49] have faith in what the word says you are
[1:07:52] and Jesus had faith in the word of God
[1:07:54] what he was
[1:07:56] It Was Written of me
[1:07:58] then David and the Psalms and the
[1:08:00] prophets all spoke of him
[1:08:02] I am the bread of life that cometh down
[1:08:04] out of God out of Heaven I am the Tree
[1:08:06] of Life from the Garden of Eden I'm all
[1:08:10] these things I am that I am and he knew
[1:08:13] with a perfect faith that he was the
[1:08:15] anointed Messiah that the spirit of God
[1:08:18] was upon him he said now I in myself do
[1:08:23] nothing but it's my faith in God and God
[1:08:27] was in him the word made manifest and
[1:08:30] when the word of God see he's leading up
[1:08:34] to something it always leads up to
[1:08:36] something when we speak about Jesus or
[1:08:38] the prophet it always leads to something
[1:08:41] in this hour and where does it lead to
[1:08:43] to the bride
[1:08:45] that's where it leads to
[1:08:48] and when the word of God comes in you it
[1:08:51] makes manifest who you are as a believer
[1:08:55] and a Believer is the faith of God that
[1:08:58] moves inside of you when it's revealed
[1:09:01] to you
[1:09:02] then it becomes perfect faith
[1:09:06] oh my
[1:09:07] you know
[1:09:08] I'm I I can imagine Abraham every time
[1:09:12] Abraham
[1:09:13] it was challenged Satan challenged him
[1:09:16] I can see him
[1:09:18] God said so
[1:09:21] God promised I'm going to have a child
[1:09:25] I don't care about anything and when I
[1:09:27] look at the word of God and I see what
[1:09:29] has been spoken what has been spoken
[1:09:31] about the bride what has been prophesied
[1:09:33] about the bride I look at has been
[1:09:35] spoken about me and prophesied about me
[1:09:37] I don't care about myself I know I'm no
[1:09:40] good at myself I know I couldn't my
[1:09:42] brother says uh take my bootstraps and
[1:09:45] go anywheres without God it's been God
[1:09:47] from the beginning that spoke to me when
[1:09:50] I came in 31 years ago was gone
[1:09:53] today it's gone tomorrow it's gone it's
[1:09:56] always going to be God
[1:09:57] [Music]
[1:10:02] so when I see what's been spoken
[1:10:07] there's a witness of the Holy Ghost
[1:10:10] of the life of God inside of me that
[1:10:13] says amen
[1:10:15] amen and then when God quickens the word
[1:10:18] in the time and season in my life my
[1:10:21] personal life and speaks that word amen
[1:10:24] then I know life is going to come forth
[1:10:27] change is going to come forth and it's
[1:10:30] happening
[1:10:31] brother Brown's seen himself walking and
[1:10:34] he was walking and then all of a sudden
[1:10:36] he looked around and he looked at his
[1:10:37] wife and he was
[1:10:40] and he said he's seen the bride in a
[1:10:41] vision walking walking walking walking
[1:10:43] straight up my brothers and sisters
[1:10:47] there's a transformation taking place
[1:10:50] there's elements I don't know the
[1:10:52] scientific uh
[1:10:53] breakdown of all of it I don't have
[1:10:55] enough education for that but the
[1:10:57] elements in our bodies amen the cells in
[1:11:00] our bodies right now are changing amen
[1:11:03] they're vibrating faster and faster and
[1:11:05] faster as the word of God is coming
[1:11:07] forth in the spirit of God is opening up
[1:11:09] and revealing and revealing and bringing
[1:11:11] it to pass in our lives our bodies are
[1:11:14] being changed Moment by moment we don't
[1:11:16] even have to think about how how I'm
[1:11:18] going to be different how I'm going to
[1:11:19] change oh I want to be different oh I
[1:11:21] want to change oh I don't want to do
[1:11:23] this anymore I don't want to do that
[1:11:24] anymore we don't think about that
[1:11:26] anymore it just happens it happens when
[1:11:29] you walk every day in your life and it's
[1:11:31] a transformation is just taking place

[1:11:54] Ministers of God that are catching the
[1:11:56] revelation of this hour of the Rapture
[1:11:58] that are going to be called
[1:12:01] crazy in fanatics
[1:12:04] what are you preaching what is that
[1:12:08] what if brother you see those traps set
[1:12:11] in there it's always been that way
[1:12:13] that's why Jesus spoke in Parables
[1:12:16] that's why the word was written The Way
[1:12:18] It Was Written because it's only
[1:12:20] revealed to the ones that are chosen
[1:12:22] it's giving you to know the mysteries of
[1:12:24] God to the other ones it's not given to
[1:12:26] no
[1:12:28] and there's things written in this in
[1:12:30] the message in these quotes right that
[1:12:33] is allotted for the Bride of Jesus
[1:12:35] Christ in this hour to speak
[1:12:38] is not written in word it's the
[1:12:41] unwritten word behind the quotes of the
[1:12:44] eye in the word
[1:12:46] we see how can she write how can she
[1:12:48] just when she comes into that life of
[1:12:50] God
[1:12:51] how can you write the life of God the
[1:12:53] life of God Lives the life of God's
[1:12:56] speech the life of God moves in the
[1:12:58] moment that it moves every day of Our
[1:13:01] Lives

[1:14:41] I say Lord come on the scene come on the
[1:14:44] scene and overcome in my life oh my

[1:15:29] through us
[1:15:32] and that is Us in this hour
[1:15:35] now you can understand when Jesus said
[1:15:39] be perfect
[1:15:40] as your heavenly father is perfect
[1:15:44] I believe it
[1:15:48] you know what Saints
[1:15:50] I'm perfect
[1:15:52] I'm perfect
[1:15:54] just like my heavenly father's perfect
[1:15:57] because the perfect one
[1:15:59] the perfect everything
[1:16:02] is him that's living
[1:16:05] every every credit to my life
[1:16:08] spiritually speaking
[1:16:10] everything that I've overcome everything
[1:16:13] that I've changed in my life is credit
[1:16:15] to him
[1:16:16] the perfect one
[1:16:18] and he's going to make everything
[1:16:20] perfect
[1:16:22] not according to my interpretation
[1:16:25] that's a big thing with the human mind
[1:16:29] interpreting God
[1:16:31] we don't interpret God God is his own
[1:16:35] interpreter he will make it plain he
[1:16:39] will bring the word to pass
[1:16:41] he will show himself
[1:16:44] who he said he is and who he will be in
[1:16:46] your life
[1:16:47] amen
[1:16:53] Hallelujah I'm going to move right on
[1:16:55] here
[1:16:56] brother Brown is speaking in here
[1:16:58] quick and Empower lets us see his coming
[1:17:01] coming
[1:17:03] quickening power snatches us from death
[1:17:05] to life
[1:17:07] quickening power gives us discernment
[1:17:10] you know people look at the sermon right
[1:17:13] listen if you don't got discernment in
[1:17:15] this hour
[1:17:17] you're finished
[1:17:18] and I'm not talking about people you
[1:17:21] know they look at brother bradner's
[1:17:22] discernment does not kind of discernment
[1:17:23] no no no no
[1:17:25] this word discerns a very thoughts and
[1:17:28] the intenses of the heart even your own
[1:17:30] heart
[1:17:31] not anybody else's your own heart
[1:17:33] and it it discerns your motives your
[1:17:36] intentions
[1:17:39] how many times we quiet the spirit of
[1:17:41] God within us when he's speaking the
[1:17:43] voice of God in us when he's speaking
[1:17:44] when he's Discerning your very thoughts
[1:17:46] and your attentions of your hearts and
[1:17:48] your motives when he's speaking to you
[1:17:51] that happens to me when I go like like
[1:17:53] our Pastor said many times when when uh
[1:17:56] when you go to bed at night and you
[1:17:57] start praying
[1:17:58] you've done something wrong
[1:18:01] and not in the day or said something
[1:18:03] wrong it comes up
[1:18:05] it comes up
[1:18:07] oh yes
[1:18:08] I know I experienced that all the time
[1:18:11] that's the only way in the spirit I know
[1:18:15] I have a clear conscience and I'm right
[1:18:18] with God and I'm right with everybody
[1:18:20] else
[1:18:22] is because the spirit of God reveals and
[1:18:25] how many times the spirit of God even
[1:18:27] the Bible says it if you have ought
[1:18:29] against your brother or your sister go
[1:18:30] to them
[1:18:31] what are you keeping that inside of
[1:18:33] there I don't even know why I'm getting
[1:18:34] on this why are you keeping that inside
[1:18:36] of you
[1:18:37] that is hinder in the spirit of progress
[1:18:40] inside of you hindering the holy ghost
[1:18:42] from doing the things he wants to do
[1:18:45] inside of you
[1:18:46] you got to let that go you got to
[1:18:48] confess that
[1:18:51] that's that's our job if there's a job
[1:18:54] that we have to do
[1:18:55] is that is that
[1:18:57] is confess our sins one to another

[1:19:12] will
[1:19:13] will be the Lord Jesus Christ is so full
[1:19:16] of quickening power he said destroy this
[1:19:19] body and I'll raise it up in three days
[1:19:23] talk about confidence and quickening
[1:19:25] power it was the prophecy of the word of
[1:19:28] God and the prophecy if it's true word
[1:19:30] of God cannot fail and the same prophecy
[1:19:33] and the word of God that said
[1:19:36] it'll raise him up says that we are
[1:19:40] already raised with him no wonder he
[1:19:44] said fear not
[1:19:47] fear not
[1:19:49] the greatest tool that Satan uses still
[1:19:53] upon people's lives here
[1:19:55] fear
[1:19:57] but God is trying to reveal to us over
[1:20:00] and over by by what he's speaking here I
[1:20:04] conquer death Hell In The Grave I rose

[1:20:33] I don't care what do you care about the
[1:20:35] flesh
[1:20:38] the spirit of God the life and God the
[1:20:40] life of God inside of you has raising so
[1:20:43] much up above the flesh you don't walk
[1:20:45] by the flesh

[1:20:49] the scripture says you walk in the
[1:20:51] spirit you walk in faith you walk in
[1:20:53] Revelation
[1:20:54] in Revelation there's no fear

[1:21:04] in the light as he is in the light
[1:21:07] keep walking in the light
[1:21:10] my brothers and sisters is a separation
[1:21:12] time
[1:21:13] there's another level that is going to
[1:21:15] it's going to another level it keeps
[1:21:18] going up to the levels and levels and
[1:21:20] levels this word of God with inside of
[1:21:22] us
[1:21:23] separating us
[1:21:25] bringing us to the place now you see
[1:21:28] right here when he's talking here
[1:21:30] talking about confidence and the
[1:21:33] quickening power my brothers and sisters
[1:21:35] the challenge is that Jesus had to meet
[1:21:37] in the Garden of Gethsemane the
[1:21:40] challenges that he had to meet going to
[1:21:41] the cross the challenges is that he had
[1:21:44] to meet going into hell and taking the
[1:21:47] keys of death hell in the grave and
[1:21:49] rising up again
[1:21:50] is the challenges that he was saying
[1:21:53] right there
[1:21:54] that we the bride he wants to put that
[1:21:59] Faith inside of us in this hour
[1:22:03] the get us prepared and ready for what's
[1:22:07] coming upon the Earth
[1:22:09] so that we can move and operate in the
[1:22:12] same power the same confidence that he
[1:22:15] operated in
[1:22:17] do I have all the words do I have all
[1:22:18] the understanding of what I'm saying
[1:22:20] right now no
[1:22:21] because he's breaking it he's unfolding
[1:22:23] it but I know there's a time that's
[1:22:25] coming very soon very soon that these
[1:22:29] quotes are not going to be quotes
[1:22:31] anymore
[1:22:32] they're going to be a living
[1:22:34] manifestation of individuals walking on
[1:22:37] this Earth producing it they don't have
[1:22:39] to talk it
[1:22:41] the preaching is going to be done one
[1:22:43] day to you
[1:22:44] the preaching is is actually getting to
[1:22:46] a place where it is starting to wind up
[1:22:48] now
[1:22:49] because Sons and Daughters of God know
[1:22:52] who they are
[1:22:55] I'm not saying that you don't need
[1:22:57] preaching and stuff like that
[1:22:59] I'm saying something different here that
[1:23:01] you need to catch by the spirit
[1:23:03] amen
[1:23:05] Hallelujah let us wind this down now
[1:23:09] amen
[1:23:13] that true Easter seal on that Sunrise
[1:23:16] broke
[1:23:17] the secret of life and death was
[1:23:19] revealed before that time we didn't know
[1:23:21] the world were grouped in darkness
[1:23:23] groped around man's suspicious theories
[1:23:26] amongst man's hearts and traditions made
[1:23:28] up man worshiped Idols they worshiped
[1:23:31] the son they worshiped all kinds of gods
[1:23:32] and all kinds of people made claims and
[1:23:35] they went into the grave and they stayed
[1:23:37] in the grave but the real seal had been
[1:23:40] broken
[1:23:42] and once and one who once lived as we
[1:23:47] lived and died as we died was risen from
[1:23:50] the dead and the Seeker was made known
[1:23:52] that he was both resurrection and life
[1:23:55] and he said when he came forth on that
[1:23:58] morning he said because I live
[1:24:03] you live also
[1:24:06] that life that was living in him is now
[1:24:10] in US
[1:24:12] no different life it's the same life
[1:24:15] that's what he's saying there
[1:24:18] because I live
[1:24:21] because I overcame I conquered
[1:24:24] you live
[1:24:26] you do the same things
[1:24:29] Hallelujah
[1:24:30] amen
[1:24:34] that's the way it is
[1:24:35] to all believers they are Mystic the
[1:24:38] people don't understand because they
[1:24:41] live in a world to themselves
[1:24:43] that's why you can't live there's no
[1:24:46] there's no that we're individuals we
[1:24:48] can't live uh you know uh groups this
[1:24:52] ain't no groups this ain't no uh bunch
[1:24:55] of people this is individuals God deals
[1:24:58] with us as individuals
[1:25:00] right we walk with God Alone
[1:25:06] with God
[1:25:08] you my wife don't walk with god with me
[1:25:12] alone
[1:25:13] no
[1:25:14] I walk with God Alone She Walks With God
[1:25:17] alone you walk with God Alone
[1:25:22] your wife or your or or or your husband
[1:25:25] might have great faith what about you
[1:25:29] where do you stand
[1:25:33] Hallelujah
[1:25:37] Jesus lived in the world that nobody
[1:25:39] else could touch
[1:25:43] so it is when a man lives by faith and
[1:25:45] walks by faith I mean substance Faith he
[1:25:47] is isolated from the entire world and
[1:25:49] becomes a new creature in Christ

[1:27:02] brother Brown says that faith never
[1:27:05] fails

[1:27:09] his perfect faith and so it is now
[1:27:13] with those who have perfect Faith are a
[1:27:16] Mystic to others so now he's saying so
[1:27:20] it is now
[1:27:22] it's here now
[1:27:25] the bride perfect faith is here now
[1:27:29] that's what the seed has awaken up to in
[1:27:32] this hour is that perfect faith and only
[1:27:36] that perfect faith
[1:27:38] can produce
[1:27:40] a raptured in this day in this hour
[1:27:46] amen
[1:27:49] they want a Great Awakening
[1:27:52] I'll wind it down the musicians can come
[1:27:55] they want a Great Awakening
[1:27:59] their crying believing that there will
[1:28:01] be an Awakening
[1:28:04] well brother Brown is speaking back here
[1:28:06] recognizing your day and his message and
[1:28:08] you know he's talking back there
[1:28:10] but like I said the quotes
[1:28:12] are prophecies
[1:28:14] and you need to find the right quote
[1:28:16] quotes
[1:28:17] for the Prophecies of this day and age
[1:28:20] and this God struck my heart and
[1:28:23] revealed this to me and showed me that
[1:28:25] this prophecy this quote is being
[1:28:28] fulfilled today in the message
[1:28:31] that's what's happening with the
[1:28:33] confusion that's what's happening with
[1:28:36] all the false things that are going on
[1:28:38] all the Cults and Clans that are raising
[1:28:40] up everything that is is puzzling the
[1:28:43] people
[1:28:45] not the bride
[1:28:47] the bride was always based on his word
[1:28:50] and him
[1:28:52] she's not deceived by these things
[1:28:55] they are crying believing that there
[1:28:57] will be a Great Awakening sure they are
[1:28:59] look at the message look at the quotes
[1:29:01] look what look at the prophet said about
[1:29:03] the bride look what look what he said
[1:29:05] about her overcoming and becoming what
[1:29:07] some of the things we said here tonight
[1:29:09] of course they're believing all that
[1:29:12] they're good people
[1:29:14] they're not evil people they're not bad
[1:29:16] people they're good people
[1:29:20] they have not recognized The Awakening
[1:29:23] of the Bride
[1:29:25] by being a Christian they feel the pull
[1:29:28] of the hour
[1:29:30] oh there's a pull in this hour
[1:29:33] oh the pool is getting stronger and
[1:29:36] stronger as God is revealing to his
[1:29:39] bride more and more that pull is taken
[1:29:42] over the atmospheres
[1:29:44] oh yeah
[1:29:47] and it's become in her atmosphere
[1:29:50] that's what that's what is his life that
[1:29:54] she can that the people are going to see
[1:29:55] in this message that they can't deny
[1:29:57] because when she speaks it's going to
[1:29:59] come to pass and the atmosphere that's
[1:30:01] around her
[1:30:02] look remember brother Brian was the
[1:30:04] first wave sheep when he walked into a
[1:30:07] room the presence of God was so much
[1:30:09] around him
[1:30:11] the atmosphere of God was so much around
[1:30:14] it changed things
[1:30:16] oh my my brothers and sisters don't look
[1:30:19] at yourself right now I don't look at
[1:30:20] myself right now but I look at to the
[1:30:22] word of God and I see what's coming I
[1:30:24] see what God is doing inside of me
[1:30:27] and let me tell you don't put a time
[1:30:29] limit on God what he can do in your life
[1:30:31] God can Quicken things and Quicken
[1:30:34] things so much the word that's been
[1:30:37] planted and you've been feeding off it
[1:30:39] for years all it takes is one moment for
[1:30:42] God to Quicken us
[1:30:44] oh yeah
[1:30:46] that's why we don't put an
[1:30:47] interpretation on nothing of his word we
[1:30:51] believe it we accept it and that's it
[1:30:54] because he's going to bring it to pass
[1:30:56] when he's going to bring it to the Past
[1:30:57] in his time in his season
[1:31:00] now listen
[1:31:03] but they haven't recognized what's been
[1:31:05] done
[1:31:07] oh my
[1:31:08] something has been done
[1:31:10] brother Tim tell me what's been done
[1:31:12] something has been done
[1:31:14] I can't tell you
[1:31:16] I can't tell you not even even the
[1:31:18] messages that we preach and how clear we
[1:31:21] we hear the word of God so so clear and
[1:31:24] mature from from our pastor for many
[1:31:27] many years amen but even that cannot
[1:31:30] show you what's been done only the
[1:31:33] spirit of God can show you what's been
[1:31:35] done
[1:31:35] how many people been feeding off this
[1:31:38] word for many many many years how many
[1:31:40] people pass through even this ministry
[1:31:43] and gone
[1:31:45] and I look into my heart
[1:31:47] and we and I say how can it be
[1:31:51] like Peter says where can I go Lord you
[1:31:54] got the words of life it's not a word of
[1:31:57] a man
[1:31:58] I don't follow a man
[1:32:01] what's words of life
[1:32:03] it's Jesus in our camp it's Jesus in our
[1:32:07] midst
[1:32:09] it's him
[1:32:12] what's been done that's what's making
[1:32:14] them feel that way
[1:32:16] they know something is supposed to
[1:32:17] happen
[1:32:18] but they see they're looking for it way
[1:32:21] off in the future to come oh no
[1:32:24] tonight is happening
[1:32:26] it's happening tonight every day is
[1:32:29] happening
[1:32:30] in The Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:32:32] when it's already happened right by you
[1:32:36] recognizing your Danish message
[1:32:40] in Jehovah Jireh
[1:32:42] last quote here
[1:32:45] the bride is done chosen
[1:32:48] it's getting her ready now
[1:32:50] the Revival is over there is no more
[1:32:53] Revival spirit
[1:32:56] think about it
[1:32:58] is only a word Revival
[1:33:00] that's happening in the individual bride
[1:33:03] of Jesus Christ that's all
[1:33:04] everything else is dead
[1:33:07] even in the message if you're not under
[1:33:09] this word Revival is coming and
[1:33:11] manifesting is dead
[1:33:15] people are getting quoted to death
[1:33:19] educated to death
[1:33:22] dead seeds
[1:33:25] knowledge all these things
[1:33:32] there's no more Spirit Revival two hours
[1:33:34] of service everybody's complaining
[1:33:37] and so we are just gleaning in the field
[1:33:39] and Abraham just had to sweat it out
[1:33:42] until he found character
[1:33:44] and when he found character the next
[1:33:46] thing was prepare her to meet the vibe
[1:33:50] groom
[1:33:51] you remember when he found her it was in
[1:33:53] the evening time the evening light
[1:33:56] but the spiritual Royal Seed of Abraham
[1:34:01] which believes every word of God
[1:34:06] there is a confirmation of a living
[1:34:09] resurrect Jesus Christ in them
[1:34:13] that's the other
[1:34:16] oh I believe the message I believe those
[1:34:19] who believe every word of God there's a
[1:34:22] confirmation in them of the living
[1:34:25] resurrected Jesus Christ
[1:34:28] that is the difference that is going to
[1:34:31] be displayed in this hour
[1:34:33] between the believer
[1:34:35] and the make-believer and the unbeliever
[1:34:39] halleluia the church
[1:34:42] goes through
[1:34:44] the tribulation period
[1:34:47] let me tell you the message
[1:34:50] goes through the tribulation period
[1:34:53] but the bride not her
[1:34:57] she is redeemed she doesn't have to be
[1:35:00] purified she's already pure the Holy
[1:35:03] Spirit has come into her and purified
[1:35:05] her and took all the filthy of the world
[1:35:09] and she believes that word and becomes a
[1:35:12] part of it it's the bride that comes out
[1:35:16] of the Church of the message
[1:35:19] it's the bride and the spirit
[1:35:23] in this last day that says come
[1:35:26] amen
[1:35:28] oh it's the bride in the spirit
[1:35:31] that says come
[1:35:33] in these last days let us stand
[1:35:38] the Great Awakening of that seed
[1:35:43] it's a perfect faith
[1:35:46] in this hour

[1:35:48] oh my
[1:35:50] God
[1:35:51] father we thank you Lord
[1:35:52] [Music]
[1:35:56] foreign what can we say father but thank
[1:35:59] you
[1:36:01] Here We Are Tonight Lord Jesus
[1:36:04] believe in
[1:36:05] [Music]
[1:36:07] on the first time you spoke into our
[1:36:09] hearts
[1:36:12] and you spoke bright
[1:36:13] [Music]
[1:36:15] we had we found it hard to believe at
[1:36:17] that time lord
[1:36:19] and we kept wandering over the years
[1:36:23] am I really
[1:36:25] this that that is spoken by the prophet
[1:36:27] am I really this
[1:36:30] but you constantly came
[1:36:32] as that seed was Awakening and growing
[1:36:34] and being watered and in the sunlight in
[1:36:37] good soil
[1:36:39] with a good heart
[1:36:41] that you gave us Lord
[1:36:43] and you constantly came over and over
[1:36:46] and over and over all the things that
[1:36:49] were done in our lives all the signs
[1:36:50] wonders all the great things that you
[1:36:53] confirm to us was not to make us proud
[1:36:56] or Pride or make us feel that we're
[1:36:58] better than anybody else
[1:37:00] but it's just to show you to show us
[1:37:03] Lord that you were showing us that we
[1:37:05] are
[1:37:06] what you said we are yes we are the
[1:37:09] Bride of Jesus Christ in this hour
[1:37:10] [Music]
[1:37:12] oh Lord
[1:37:13] [Music]
[1:37:16] I can understand
[1:37:18] how in the in the day when you walk this
[1:37:21] Earth
[1:37:23] when the Pharisees and Sadducees came up
[1:37:25] and you had to you had to change from
[1:37:27] the first pull to the second Pole where
[1:37:30] everybody loved you Lord just like in
[1:37:32] this hour with our Prophet but when the
[1:37:35] third poll came
[1:37:36] that third pull was perfect faith
[1:37:40] that was the purpose of God that was
[1:37:42] predestinated before the foundation of
[1:37:43] the world that was the position that
[1:37:46] that you were called to manifest on this
[1:37:48] Earth and you were called to come here
[1:37:50] to die to raise again but you you were
[1:37:54] called to proclaim the kingdom the
[1:37:56] kingdom of God has come within men
[1:37:59] you are called to say I and my father
[1:38:02] are one and the same
[1:38:04] and I believe Lord that the bride is
[1:38:08] coming into that faith that perfect
[1:38:10] Faith where she can say in this hour and
[1:38:14] speak that I and the father
[1:38:18] are one in the same
[1:38:19] [Music]
[1:38:22] Jesus Christ
[1:38:24] has come
[1:38:26] in flesh again
[1:38:28] and is manifested
[1:38:31] oh God
[1:38:33] you have prepared her all these years
[1:38:37] and you have placed and taken everything
[1:38:39] that you need to take out of our Lord
[1:38:42] so that she can walk with this word and
[1:38:45] Proclaim this word
[1:38:47] that it will just be you
[1:38:51] Jesus you said I do nothing unless the
