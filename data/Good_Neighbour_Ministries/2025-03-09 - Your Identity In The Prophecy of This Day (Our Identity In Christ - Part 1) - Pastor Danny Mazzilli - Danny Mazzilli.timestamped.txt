[28:48] to Rejoice around the word of God amen
[28:51] amen amen and I'm excited about the word
[28:54] because it is God's provided way for us
[28:57] to receive strength to receive
[29:00] instruction to know better who we are
[29:03] make clear our identity in this day and
[29:06] in this hour and what it is that God is
[29:08] doing and where we fit into the whole
[29:10] program of the Lord amen am praise God
[29:14] and so today we're going to be looking
[29:17] at um we're we're still in in uh in the
[29:21] lines of what we've been ministering you
[29:23] know one thing you're going to come to
[29:24] realize and what I'm realizing is that
[29:26] you know the word just keeps expounding
[29:30] itself and you'll see that regardless of
[29:33] the topics that you take and the themes
[29:37] and and the titles that you take from
[29:39] the scriptures once your your your
[29:42] understanding has been opened to the
[29:44] word of God you've received the Holy
[29:46] Ghost for your day all you can see is
[29:49] Jesus Christ throughout the word and
[29:52] what you're going to be seeing more and
[29:53] more in this day is not just Jesus
[29:56] Christ but Christ and the church
[30:00] everything of the Old Testament was
[30:02] calling on the Messiah the coming of
[30:04] Christ the coming of the Lord Jesus but
[30:06] I want you to notice in the New
[30:08] Testament it's all about Christ to his
[30:12] church amen because Adam was restored
[30:16] Eve is now being restored the Church
[30:18] amen and so we're still um you know I
[30:22] can't get away from uh the thoughts that
[30:24] uh the Lord has just been placing on my
[30:26] heart and so we're going to be go to the
[30:28] next slide today we're going to be
[30:29] looking at um you know our identity in
[30:32] Christ but even more so go to the next
[30:35] slide you'll see that it's your
[30:38] identity your personal identity in the
[30:42] prophecy of this day amen amen amen
[30:45] praise God we know that we're in the
[30:47] midst of Prophecy don't
[30:49] we amen praise God well we need to
[30:52] recognize where we fit let's read our
[30:54] scripture and then you may be
[30:56] seated first scripture is from 1
[30:59] Corinthians 13 veres 9 and 10 it says
[31:03] for we know in part and we prophesy in
[31:07] part but when that which is perfect is
[31:10] come then that which is in part shall be
[31:13] done away amen amen God bless you you
[31:16] may be seated may the Lord add His
[31:18] blessings to the word of God Amen father
[31:20] we thank you for everything that you are
[31:22] about to unveil and make known more
[31:25] clearly there's nothing new that I can
[31:28] bring father it is only your inspiration
[31:31] and your spirit that can interpret the
[31:34] word of God to each and every one of us
[31:38] personally and that is our desire this
[31:40] morning Lord as we would Minister your
[31:42] word that that the spirit would would
[31:46] stand behind the word and move through
[31:49] the pews and into the hearts of the
[31:51] people oh God and make it real make it
[31:54] live make it an overcoming victory for
[31:57] each and every one of us Lord the
[32:00] present truth the word of God for this
[32:02] day and for this hour Grant it we pray
[32:04] in Jesus name amen praise God Saints
[32:07] we're living in the day uh when that
[32:11] which is perfect has come amen praise
[32:15] God we need to realize that that uh you
[32:18] know these scriptures they were spoken
[32:20] but this was like 2,000 years ago here
[32:23] Paul was speaking in in the in the book
[32:26] of Corinthians and he was saying that
[32:28] that when you know when that which is in
[32:30] part uh that which is perfect comes that
[32:34] which is in part will be done away and
[32:36] this is the hour where the word himself
[32:40] the fullness of the word that which is
[32:43] perfect has come unveiled the word of
[32:46] God to us in these last days to make the
[32:49] word come alive and real and identify
[32:53] you and me exactly where we fit in the
[32:55] word of God Amen praise God when Jesus
[32:58] Christ came to the Earth he was the word
[33:00] made flesh and yet only a handful of
[33:04] people could actually identify with him
[33:07] amen all those religious leaders of that
[33:10] day they were they were they were
[33:11] astounded by the things that he was
[33:13] saying making himself God imagine saying
[33:17] that I am the son of man he that is you
[33:20] know he he he spoke to the woman at the
[33:22] well he says she says only Messiah only
[33:25] only Messiah could do these things and
[33:27] he turns he says I am he it was a time
[33:31] where he was unveiling himself but it
[33:33] was only to those that he chose to
[33:36] unveil himself too amen and so the
[33:39] mighty Angel has come down open the
[33:42] mystery of Christ to us made the book a
[33:45] brand new book to us through the opening
[33:48] of The Seven Seals amen the word is now
[33:51] in its fullness revealed to the called
[33:54] out Church there's a people that have
[33:57] wreck recognized that the mighty Angel
[33:59] has come that the spirit of God is now
[34:02] anointing a people to recognize and to
[34:05] live this word and to identify in the
[34:08] prophecy as the church that's going in
[34:11] the Rapture amen amen praise God we need
[34:14] to know which scripture it is prophecy
[34:17] is being fulfilled all around us and if
[34:20] your eyes are open to see it you'll be
[34:22] able to recognize the players the actors
[34:26] the political landscape the kings of the
[34:30] earth Prime Ministers presidents there
[34:34] those are the kings of those Nations and
[34:37] they all represent those Nations but
[34:40] they they didn't just
[34:42] come into uh uh representation
[34:45] now all scripture is is prophecy the Old
[34:50] Testament spoke clearly of the things
[34:53] that would take place in the end time
[34:56] and how these kingdoms would rise and
[34:59] who the players would be and what part
[35:01] in the prophecy they would fulfill we
[35:04] looked at it last week when we were
[35:05] talking about Donald Trump and his
[35:08] position as the king of North America of
[35:12] of uh of of the United States of America
[35:14] he wants to make himself king of the
[35:16] world now by his by his statements and
[35:19] by you know USA we will make USA great
[35:23] again what's he trying to say he says we
[35:26] want to be the superpower of the world
[35:29] that's his decree to the world and and
[35:32] he wants to fulfill this and but he
[35:34] doesn't realize himself that he is
[35:37] fulfilling prophecy amen he's being used
[35:40] to bring certain kingdoms into their
[35:43] positions so that they can fulfill the
[35:46] word of God parts of of assisting Israel
[35:50] and how Israel is the center focal point
[35:54] of it
[35:55] all they fail to see all of of that but
[35:59] unto you it has been given to know the
[36:02] mysteries of the Kingdom you're blessed
[36:05] so where do you identify with the
[36:07] current day prophecy do you identify
[36:10] with second Timothy where it says people
[36:13] will be lovers of themselves proud
[36:17] boasters were they're going to be
[36:19] disobedient to parents lovers of
[36:22] pleasure more than lovers of
[36:26] God you see you need to you need to look
[36:29] at your own life and you need to see
[36:31] where your priorities are that's what
[36:33] we're going to be looking at here you
[36:35] know maybe over the next uh few weeks as
[36:38] the Lord would would lead I don't know
[36:40] how how long we're going to go with this
[36:42] but let's just pray and believe and see
[36:45] what it is that the Lord wants to reveal
[36:46] to to our hearts personally because
[36:49] that's what the word of God is for the
[36:51] foolishness of preaching so that we can
[36:54] know clearly Who We Are how we fit are
[36:59] we just
[37:00] churchgoers are we just you know are we
[37:02] about uh those that um you know about
[37:06] the day that don't know the day and the
[37:08] hour like it says in Mark chap
[37:11] 13:32 the Lord will come as a thief in
[37:14] the night it says are you still waiting
[37:18] for something to happen or have you
[37:20] recognized that he has already come and
[37:23] like a thief in the night he's pulled
[37:25] you out of the world amen pulled you by
[37:28] a revelation into the message of this
[37:31] day so that you can recognize Christ in
[37:35] the present stage of his
[37:37] ministry to see where prophecy is being
[37:40] fulfilled around your very life and how
[37:42] it is that prophecy is being spoken and
[37:46] lived through your
[37:49] life amen where do you see yourself
[37:52] Saints first Corinthians talks about
[37:55] that that uh in verse in chapter 15 it
[37:59] talks about that we will be changed in a
[38:01] moment in the twinkling of an eye that's
[38:04] a prophecy amen but yet in second in in
[38:07] uh 1 Thessalonians chapter 4:1 16 it
[38:10] says that the Lord
[38:12] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[38:15] shout and we know that the shout is the
[38:18] message amen and the voice is the voice
[38:21] of the Archangel it's the voice of God
[38:23] it's the spirit of God amen glory to God
[38:27] with the Trump of God so that so that we
[38:30] could receive rapturing Faith so that we
[38:33] can receive perfect faith for for a
[38:36] Rapture amen and God is using a a
[38:39] natural Trump and God is using his his
[38:42] Trump which is his word which is a which
[38:45] is a call to the Sons and Daughters of
[38:48] God back to the word of God Amen are you
[38:50] looking at this event as something to
[38:53] come is it a future prophecy or is it
[38:57] something that you are identified with
[39:00] now amen that you've received the
[39:03] message you've heard the voice amen
[39:07] you've recognized the the the scripture
[39:10] that's being fulfilled around you
[39:12] Revelations have you recognized Malachi
[39:15] 4 verse
[39:17] 5 behold I send unto
[39:21] you that's
[39:23] personal unto you
[39:25] personal have you received received
[39:27] God's messenger of Malachi 4:5 in this
[39:31] day and has he turned your heart back to
[39:35] the word you see you can't miss that
[39:39] prophecy to miss that prophecy is to
[39:42] miss the message of the hour amen you
[39:45] can't you listen you can't get to the
[39:47] message of the hour without going
[39:50] through Mali
[39:52] 4:5 amen praise God but listen Malachi
[39:56] 45 was William Mary and Branham but it's
[39:59] not you worshiping him or making him the
[40:03] absolute it's recognizing the word that
[40:06] that came through the the instrument
[40:09] through the prophet amen amen the
[40:12] prophets were not
[40:14] God but they spoke as God Amen they
[40:18] spoke the word of God they represented
[40:22] the word of God Amen so the minute that
[40:25] we make a person other than than Jesus
[40:28] Christ other than Elohim other than God
[40:31] himself the
[40:33] absolute we are committing adultery amen
[40:38] you cannot make
[40:42] anything anything deity other than God
[40:48] himself amen and when deity operates in
[40:52] you it is God operating in you showing
[40:56] that you are a part of God amen amen
[40:59] praise God so have you recognized
[41:01] Malachi 4:5 have you realized that he's
[41:04] come to you personal to turn your heart
[41:07] right back to the scriptures right back
[41:10] to the word of God because to miss that
[41:12] you miss Revelations 10 1-7 amen which
[41:15] is the mighty Angel himself coming down
[41:18] to the Earthly Angel of the seven Church
[41:21] age messengers of which William Branham
[41:25] was the seventh angel Messenger to the
[41:29] leodan church age to the Pentecostal age
[41:33] have you recognized that he has come
[41:36] down to open the word of God to unveil
[41:39] the mysteries of the Seven
[41:41] Seals or are you looking at those seals
[41:44] as a future
[41:46] event but have you recognized that they
[41:48] have been unveiled that they have been
[41:51] open that the mystery of Christ has been
[41:54] unveiled and is being unveiled and this
[41:57] is everything to us
[42:00] amen the coming of the Lord amen praise
[42:05] God this is prophecy in progress Saints
[42:11] these are things and so when we look at
[42:13] Prophecy in the word of God and we go
[42:15] back to the very
[42:17] beginning it's important for us to
[42:19] recognize where it all started
[42:22] everything started in the mind of God
[42:25] but when it comes to you and me
[42:28] here on Earth it started right back in
[42:30] the Garden of Eden amen and so let's
[42:33] read our next
[42:35] scripture as we move along here and we
[42:38] look at
[42:41] prophecy and us being identified in the
[42:44] prophecy in Genesis
[42:46] 1:27 to 28 it says so God created man in
[42:50] his own image in the image of God
[42:52] created he him male and female created
[42:56] he them and God blessed them and God
[42:59] said unto them be
[43:01] fruitful and multiply and replenish the
[43:05] Earth and subdue it and have dominion
[43:09] over the fish of the sea and over the
[43:11] fowl of the air and over every living
[43:14] creature that moveth upon the Earth amen
[43:20] that was a
[43:21] prophecy and Eve was the woman who the
[43:25] prophecy would be fulfilled
[43:27] through understand that when God created
[43:30] himself and made it in his own image
[43:33] Adam and Eve were in Adam it was one God
[43:39] expressed in the image of God and when
[43:43] God took the dust of the earth and
[43:44] created the body for Adam God says to
[43:47] him he says now
[43:50] multiply he goes on to say multiply and
[43:53] replenish the Earth amen it was it's
[43:56] always been listen whenever we talk
[43:59] about
[44:01] God and Jesus Christ we need to also see
[44:06] the plan of God Adam and
[44:10] Eve Christ and the
[44:13] church never see it any other way
[44:17] because this is the hour where this
[44:19] becomes completely unveiled made clear
[44:23] and that's why we can identify as the
[44:25] church that goes in the
[44:29] Rapture the wise virgin it's always been
[44:32] a woman a type of the church that the
[44:34] word would operate through that's why
[44:37] Eve her name was given Eve mother of all
[44:41] living because we're talking about the
[44:43] whole plan that that that we're
[44:46] fulfilling here on Earth let's stay
[44:49] let's stay clear on on the plan of God
[44:52] Amen Eve went ahead of the program
[44:57] by being deceived by the
[44:59] serpent let's look at the next slide
[45:01] here Adam's bride could not
[45:04] wait God had told Adam and Eve multiply
[45:08] and replenish the Earth it was an
[45:11] oncoming thing of promise when when you
[45:14] look at that oncoming thing of promise
[45:16] you know what that says it was a
[45:19] prophecy God was saying we're going to
[45:22] replenish the Earth and when you look at
[45:24] the word replenish I know a lot of
[45:27] people but you need to see what it's
[45:28] actually saying replenish means to
[45:31] replenish that there was something there
[45:33] before and now it's going to be
[45:36] replenished we know that there was
[45:38] previous civilizations we know that
[45:40] there was things that happened that are
[45:42] hundreds of thousands and millions of
[45:44] years but that has got nothing to do
[45:47] with who you and I are here
[45:50] today we can understand that we can know
[45:53] because God has given us the ability to
[45:56] be in the mind of God and to know what
[45:58] what what God is doing today that's
[46:00] what's
[46:01] important why would Jesus Christ have to
[46:04] come to the Earth and die and give up
[46:06] his own life two thou 4,000 years after
[46:11] this was
[46:12] said if it was so important everything
[46:15] that happened before the foundations of
[46:17] the
[46:18] world if that was all so important then
[46:21] then then we would need to know those
[46:23] things but we don't need to know those
[46:25] things but we do need to understand that
[46:28] God is Sovereign God is eternal God had
[46:31] no beginning and no end and so dinosaurs
[46:34] could have existed 250 million years ago
[46:37] it's
[46:38] irrelevant because in God there is no
[46:42] time time is relevant to us because we
[46:46] die because in these human I'm only
[46:49] talking about the human bodies now
[46:52] that's why Christ came so that we could
[46:53] have eternal life not just have eternal
[46:56] life but be given and taken back
[46:59] to our
[47:01] Eternal position in God Amen if you are
[47:05] a son or a daughter of God there's never
[47:07] been a time that you were not but you
[47:09] came into a spiritual body a spiritual
[47:12] Amnesia by coming into this body and now
[47:16] you've got to live out this whole Plan
[47:18] of Redemption but blessed are your eyes
[47:21] and blessed are your ears for unto you
[47:23] it has been given to know the Plan of
[47:25] Redemption
[47:28] and this is what we this is why we
[47:29] Rejoice amen so so we know that that
[47:33] there was these previous things but
[47:35] we're not interested in that I keep
[47:37] telling my friends you know they'll want
[47:39] to bring up oh you know the
[47:42] anunaki well the Bible talks about the
[47:45] the the children of anak they were
[47:49] giants but I want to remind you that the
[47:52] children of
[47:54] Israel went and walked
[47:57] around Jericho and that city fell along
[48:01] with all the
[48:02] Giants the children of Israel overcame
[48:05] them so where do they fit in the
[48:09] prophecy of this
[48:11] day those are the demons and the powers
[48:15] that constantly fight Us in that
[48:18] spiritual real we don't fight against
[48:20] flesh and blood but we fight against
[48:22] Powers principalities and dominions and
[48:24] the and the easiest way for Satan to get
[48:28] to you as a son or a daughter of God is
[48:30] to distract you from The Plan of
[48:32] Redemption and put you into theories and
[48:36] put you into this well this is a
[48:38] possibility well this could have
[48:40] happened and this could happen and they
[48:42] could still be here yeah they are still
[48:45] here in spirit form they're the demons
[48:47] that are trying to take our minds away
[48:49] from the word of God away from God's
[48:52] plan and God's purpose for us so that we
[48:54] can come into our rightful positions
[48:57] as Sons and Daughters of God for the
[48:59] Rapture we're not to be distracted
[49:02] Saints be careful of all of those new
[49:05] age movements and all of those teachings
[49:08] and and oh you need to understand this
[49:10] and understand that if Jesus Christ is
[49:13] not the focal point and Jesus Christ is
[49:16] not their lord and savior and if they
[49:20] don't recognize that God had a
[49:22] restoration to his word they don't
[49:24] realize the seven Church ages the seven
[49:27] Messengers through those Church ages the
[49:30] great Reformation Luther breaking away
[49:33] from the Catholic Church Wesley breaking
[49:35] away from Luther Pentecost breaking away
[49:37] from from Wesley uh and then and then
[49:41] Christ himself through the messenger of
[49:44] Malachi 4:5 Revelations 10 1-7 where he
[49:48] introduced Christ himself
[49:51] again amen amen amen so that Christ
[49:55] could come and identify himself the
[49:57] second coming of the lord they're all
[49:59] talking about
[50:01] it but they'll make him something
[50:04] different they'll say oh yes Jesus was
[50:06] this Jesus was a master Jesus reached
[50:09] the highest level of Consciousness Jesus
[50:12] Is God Amen and he is he has a Plan of
[50:15] Redemption and he has a people that he's
[50:18] come to call amen praise God those he
[50:22] said that are that are in the palms of
[50:24] his hand he says not one of them will be
[50:26] l lost that my sheep will hear my voice
[50:29] amen I believe there's sheep that are
[50:31] hearing his voice this morning praise
[50:34] God hallelujah and so we can see these
[50:38] things and we can see from this quote
[50:40] that this was a prophecy of things to
[50:43] come amen praise God let's look at the
[50:46] next slide he says here in uh in uh this
[50:50] is all from the spoken word is the
[50:51] Original Seed now Adam's bride could not
[50:55] wait but she went forward
[50:58] first that's the way today the bride
[51:01] today she wants to manufacture something
[51:04] now when we're talking about the bride
[51:05] we're talking about church we're talking
[51:08] about the woman anytime you hear woman
[51:11] in the Bible when it comes to the New
[51:13] Testament understand that it is talking
[51:16] about the church she's known as women
[51:19] amen and she wants to manufacture they
[51:22] want to come up with their own ideas
[51:24] their own teachings their own do amen
[51:27] glory to God she's got to work it up on
[51:30] the platform she's got to have something
[51:33] she's got to have everything see what is
[51:35] she doing manufacturing
[51:38] something but not the True Church the
[51:41] true church does not manufacture the
[51:43] word of God she interprets the word of
[51:47] God by the life that she receives by the
[51:50] Holy Ghost to man to to manifest
[51:54] Christ to manifest the word amen praise
[51:57] God and so here now in the next slide he
[52:00] says now when God give a commission
[52:03] which cannot perish listen what whatever
[52:04] God says something he said heavens and
[52:06] earth will pass away but not his word
[52:09] God's word is eternal it cannot fail
[52:12] when he said multiply and replenish the
[52:15] Earth that's what God's that was God's
[52:18] Eternal
[52:19] purpose he's still doing
[52:22] it he never changed the
[52:24] plan nothing Chang changed Saints this
[52:28] is being fulfilled and you're going to
[52:30] see how this prophecy is now being
[52:34] fulfilled in our day and how you
[52:36] identify in that prophecy to carry that
[52:39] out you cannot die because it's his word
[52:43] you can't you have to live thank you
[52:46] Lord God's listen he goes if that child
[52:50] had been brought forth right they'd have
[52:53] been there' have been no death but she
[52:55] couldn't wait
[52:57] you understand what he's saying there
[52:59] he's talking about when Eve was beguiled
[53:02] by the serpent went ahead of God and
[53:05] accepted the the the serpent seed amen
[53:09] instead of accepting and taking God at
[53:12] his word praise God hallelujah it's all
[53:15] about the Plan of Redemption had we come
[53:18] according to God's original plan which
[53:22] was by the spoken word in the same way
[53:25] that he did it in the Virgin Mary and
[53:27] that's what we're going to continue to
[53:28] look at then it would have been a
[53:32] perfect son every single time a perfect
[53:36] daughter of God every single time
[53:38] expressed in the image of God every
[53:40] single time attributes of God praise God
[53:45] forever more let's read on in Genesis
[53:48] 3:14 he says now and the Lord God said
[53:51] unto the serpent pay attention because
[53:54] thou Hast done this
[53:56] Thou Art cursed above all the cattle and
[53:59] above every beast of the field upon thy
[54:02] belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou
[54:06] eat all the days of thy life and I will
[54:08] put enmity between thee and the woman
[54:11] and between thy seed and her seed it
[54:14] shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[54:16] bruise his heel praise God listen don't
[54:21] tell me that the serpent was a
[54:23] snake and that it was an apple on the
[54:26] tree tree no no sir the serpent was an
[54:30] upright being that could speak that went
[54:33] to Eve was was beautiful because Satan
[54:36] is talked about as as as uh you know
[54:39] Lucifer the lightbearer he was he was
[54:41] beautiful he was he was smart a woman's
[54:44] seed well wait a minute here a woman
[54:48] doesn't have a
[54:49] seed a woman has an
[54:52] egg so what seed is he talking about
[54:57] Christ he's talking about the
[55:01] prophecy of the Christ Jesus the Messiah
[55:07] that would come through the church amen
[55:10] that would come through a virgin birth
[55:13] that would be nothing but the
[55:15] unadulterated word of God Amen people
[55:18] want to worship Mary they want to make
[55:20] her something else let's see what she
[55:23] actually represents in the scriptures
[55:26] amen amen and and the prophecy is very
[55:29] clear here there's going to always be
[55:32] enity between those two seeds and that's
[55:35] why when Cain and Abel came forth one
[55:38] was the seed of the serpent there was
[55:40] twins born and one was the seed of Adam
[55:43] amen one was an eternal seed one had a
[55:49] time because it came forth by the
[55:52] procreative power of God's word that
[55:55] every SE seed would bring forth of its
[55:57] own
[55:58] kind what nature was it that went into
[56:02] Cain remember the serpent had a beastly
[56:08] nature it did not have a human nature or
[56:12] the nature of God it had a beastly
[56:15] nature it's wild it cannot it all all
[56:18] that it was given was the ability to
[56:22] communicate by voice but its nature was
[56:25] a nature of a
[56:28] beast and it and and it's and it's clear
[56:31] here in the prophecy that there's no way
[56:34] that he's going to that that Beast is
[56:36] ever going to override
[56:39] Christ it'll bruise its
[56:42] heel but that ain't going to kill him
[56:45] it's going to bring to
[56:47] pass the Plan of
[56:50] Redemption amen praise God here we see
[56:53] the prophecy is clear about the woman
[56:56] that there would be enemity between her
[56:58] seed and the Serpent's Seed and what
[57:00] we've been ministering on over the last
[57:02] few Services we've been seeing that
[57:04] those those lineages and how we saw the
[57:06] natural the the the the the the seed
[57:10] that came through unbelief through Hagar
[57:12] and then the seed that came through a
[57:14] through a natural sex act through Sarah
[57:17] but yet it brought forth the nation of
[57:19] Israel which was the promised Nation but
[57:22] then it was the spiritual seed word of
[57:24] God that came to Mary
[57:26] by no
[57:27] sex it was God the blood of God the seed
[57:31] of God the word of God and unadulterated
[57:34] untouched of men that Mary brought forth
[57:38] Christ to restore Adam in his Perfection
[57:42] amen praise God and so here now we're
[57:46] we're just we're just continuing on that
[57:47] thought let's go to our next slide as we
[57:50] move along here Isaiah we're talking
[57:53] about prophecy here now back 800 years
[57:56] before the Virgin conceived this
[57:59] prophecy came through Isaiah therefore
[58:02] the Lord himself shall give you a sign
[58:05] Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear
[58:08] a son and shall call his name Emmanuel
[58:13] well what is
[58:15] Emmanuel God With Us his name was called
[58:19] Jesus Jehovah Savior Jesus Jehovah of
[58:25] the old test Testament is Jesus our
[58:28] savior of the New Testament amen praise
[58:32] God and so here now Isaiah was the
[58:35] prophet who caught the word of God in
[58:39] his day under the inspiration now listen
[58:43] Isaiah was a known Prophet you can go
[58:46] back and you can see how many prophecies
[58:49] go basically the whole Bible from
[58:52] Genesis to Revelation is in the book of
[58:54] Isaiah did you know that go back back
[58:56] and study it again you'll see prophecy
[58:58] after prophecy after prophecy and the
[59:01] people that knew Isaiah in his day they
[59:04] knew that the things that he said when
[59:06] he would say things they would come to
[59:08] pass things that he would say they would
[59:10] come to pass but a lot of the prophecy
[59:12] was for a future event on the coming of
[59:15] the Lord and I can imagine you know when
[59:18] when Isaiah made that prophecy on that
[59:20] day that a lot of the young virgins were
[59:23] like whoa is it could it be me and they
[59:25] were all preparing
[59:26] that potentially they could be that
[59:28] virgin that would conceive without
[59:31] having to be with man and that she would
[59:33] be that that one that that would be
[59:36] exalted like they do to Mary
[59:39] today because God chose her listen when
[59:42] Isaiah spoke that prophecy he saw the
[59:45] Virgin Mary 800 years down the road he
[59:49] saw her he saw exactly who it would be
[59:52] he saw her lineage he saw where she
[59:54] would come out of what Town what out of
[59:57] Nazareth she he knew exactly who this
[1:00:00] woman was because he's
[1:00:02] God his prophecy is clear in his mind
[1:00:06] all it is is that he needs to interpret
[1:00:08] it and bring it to pass he does that not
[1:00:12] you not me we manifest it when we
[1:00:16] believe it amen praise God and so here
[1:00:20] now let's read this uh next quote here
[1:00:23] brother Bram speaking here at a court
[1:00:24] trial and he's talking about Witnesses
[1:00:27] you know you've probably heard this
[1:00:28] message but he says all right let's call
[1:00:30] another witness right quick he says
[1:00:32] Isaiah the prophet let's ask him
[1:00:34] something why he said the Lord spoke to
[1:00:37] me one day in Prophecy I was a prophet
[1:00:40] everybody know that that that's what I
[1:00:42] said the Lord honored and they all
[1:00:45] believed me as a prophet and one day
[1:00:48] there comes something rash and it set a
[1:00:50] virgin shall conceive well now that was
[1:00:53] unusual and it's usually in that unusual
[1:00:57] thing that God works see it's too
[1:01:00] strange like Joseph he wanted to believe
[1:01:03] Mary but it was so unusual you see to it
[1:01:07] was too unusual so he said when I made
[1:01:10] that prophecy everybody believed me so
[1:01:13] every young girl got ready that was
[1:01:15] unmarried got ready to have a virgin
[1:01:18] born child day after day year after year
[1:01:21] passed on and then they begin to believe
[1:01:23] that I was a false prophet
[1:01:27] you know you've been talking about the
[1:01:28] coming of the Lord you've been talking
[1:01:30] about what God has done in this day
[1:01:32] you've been talking about the end time
[1:01:34] prophecy you've been talking about how
[1:01:36] this world is going to go into
[1:01:37] tribulation you've been talking about
[1:01:39] political uh positioning and and all of
[1:01:42] these players and you've been talking
[1:01:44] about what God has done but the people
[1:01:47] look at you year after year after a year
[1:01:50] and you're still here you've been
[1:01:51] talking about the Rapture but you're
[1:01:54] still here
[1:01:56] they're looking at you wondering when is
[1:01:59] all of this going to come but I know it
[1:02:01] was the same God that had always made
[1:02:04] these promises so I stayed right with it
[1:02:08] and it was some 800 years later before
[1:02:12] the baby come but a virgin did conceive
[1:02:17] his words come to pass and we can stand
[1:02:20] on that today Saints to know that God's
[1:02:23] word it does come to pass am amen there
[1:02:26] is nothing that God has said that he
[1:02:29] will not bring to pass and so let's just
[1:02:31] continue on here and let's look at the
[1:02:33] life of Mary let's see what we can draw
[1:02:35] out of it let's see where where where we
[1:02:37] identify in the
[1:02:39] prophecy in Luke chapter 1 verses uh
[1:02:43] 26-31 and in the sixth month the angel
[1:02:46] Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of
[1:02:49] Galilee named
[1:02:51] Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man
[1:02:55] who whose name was Joseph of the House
[1:02:57] of David and the virgin's name was Mary
[1:03:01] and the angel came in unto her and said
[1:03:04] hail thou that are highly favored and
[1:03:08] the Lord is with thee blessed art thou
[1:03:12] amongst women Oh Glory to God Saints
[1:03:15] there's so much that we can draw from
[1:03:17] this and when she saw him she was
[1:03:19] troubled at his saying and cast in her
[1:03:22] mind what manner of salutation this
[1:03:25] should be and the angel said unto her
[1:03:27] fear not Mary for thou H has found favor
[1:03:30] with God Don't Fear Saints don't don't
[1:03:35] don't be worried about the things that
[1:03:37] the angel have has told you don't fear
[1:03:40] what the mighty angel of Revelations 10
[1:03:43] 1-7 what what the the the prophet of
[1:03:45] Malachi 4 verse5 Has Told You Be not
[1:03:49] Afraid for for behold Thou shalt
[1:03:52] conceive in thy womb and bring forth the
[1:03:56] son and shall call his name Jesus glory
[1:03:59] to God imagine what was going through
[1:04:01] Mary's mind at that moment hallelujah
[1:04:05] praise God but here let's read the next
[1:04:08] quote it says as Adam found his wife
[1:04:11] pregnated with the seed of
[1:04:14] death of Satan's lie she had accepted
[1:04:18] Joseph found his wife pregnated with the
[1:04:22] seed of God which the word she had had
[1:04:27] accepted praise God forever more listen
[1:04:31] Adam found his wife pregnated by by a by
[1:04:37] a by a serpent seed amen but here now
[1:04:41] God uh impregnates a a bride a a virgin
[1:04:46] with the pure word of God somebody that
[1:04:48] had not come into contact with any kind
[1:04:51] of
[1:04:51] religion she might have had some
[1:04:54] upbringing and teachings on the word of
[1:04:56] God and the and and her priest her
[1:04:59] Pharisee you know would would have it it
[1:05:02] it ex it expounded it it it blew their
[1:05:05] minds when they found out that she was
[1:05:07] with child why couldn't they recognize
[1:05:10] the prophecy of
[1:05:12] Isaiah why were they blinded to that
[1:05:14] very prophecy to where they would call
[1:05:17] her that that that she said that she was
[1:05:19] a prostitute that she was with child
[1:05:22] before she had been married why couldn't
[1:05:23] they see it because of the enity that
[1:05:28] was placed in Eve and come down through
[1:05:33] that lineage that is there for one
[1:05:36] purpose to turn the people away from
[1:05:38] believing the pure word of God and we
[1:05:41] deal with it today the same things if
[1:05:43] you talk to a a hundred priests out
[1:05:46] there they will tell you about what
[1:05:49] happened in the Garden of Eden was Eve
[1:05:51] ate an apple and it brought about the
[1:05:54] sin of the world
[1:05:56] they have no idea about the lineage
[1:05:59] about the mystery of iniquity the
[1:06:01] serpent seed and how that lineage runs
[1:06:03] from Genesis all the way down through
[1:06:05] Revelation light and darkness amen but
[1:06:08] listen she found favor in God Amen and
[1:06:12] when we look at the word you know if you
[1:06:14] look at the Greek and you look up favor
[1:06:18] it says make accepted to make graceful
[1:06:20] charming lovely agreeable to pursue with
[1:06:24] Grace compass with favor to honor with
[1:06:29] blessing
[1:06:31] Grace God's
[1:06:33] grace because when God spoke that
[1:06:36] prophecy through Isaiah he needed a
[1:06:39] woman praise God and when God saw the
[1:06:44] prophecy that he would have a bride in
[1:06:46] the end time without spot or wrinkle he
[1:06:49] saw you and he saw
[1:06:52] me only by his favor and by his Grace
[1:06:56] and also of course by his forn knowledge
[1:06:59] because he knew that you would say yes
[1:07:03] amen glory to God hallelujah when you
[1:07:06] look at the word find it says to come
[1:07:09] unto to meet with after searching to
[1:07:13] find a thing that was sought without
[1:07:15] previous search to fall in with those
[1:07:18] who come or return back to a place while
[1:07:23] you are a son or a daughter of God if
[1:07:26] God found you it's not because he found
[1:07:28] you by accident it's because you always
[1:07:31] were a son or a daughter of God and now
[1:07:34] he's bringing you back to your place and
[1:07:37] now you're identifying yourself with the
[1:07:40] prophecy of the hour and realizing that
[1:07:43] you are that church amen you are
[1:07:46] identified with the rapturing church
[1:07:50] those that will recognize the Trump of
[1:07:52] God the voice of God the the the mighty
[1:07:55] angel of God Amen praise God that has
[1:07:57] come down to gather his
[1:08:01] elect praise God to return back to a
[1:08:05] place means you had to be there and by
[1:08:08] forign knowledge he predestinated you
[1:08:10] like it says in First Peter for his
[1:08:12] purpose and by his election and by his
[1:08:15] predestination Ephesians 1:1 Mary says
[1:08:20] how can this
[1:08:21] be listen to her response when when when
[1:08:24] the angel said said that this was going
[1:08:26] to happen you see she started to think
[1:08:28] well wait a minute well what do I got to
[1:08:30] do I got to like you mean you mean like
[1:08:33] how's this possible that that that like
[1:08:35] there's there must be something that I
[1:08:36] need to do the angel said there was
[1:08:39] nothing that she needed to
[1:08:41] do he said you found favor there's
[1:08:44] nothing that you need to try and put on
[1:08:47] there's nothing that you need to try and
[1:08:48] be a church goore and try to be better
[1:08:51] and try to live the the word of God
[1:08:53] better than anybody else once the word
[1:08:56] gets inside of you this is the time
[1:08:58] where Christ himself takes control the
[1:09:02] angel of the Lord said there's nothing
[1:09:04] you found favor Mary he says you just
[1:09:08] found favor there was going to be no
[1:09:10] human faculty no thinking that she would
[1:09:12] have to do something but notice what the
[1:09:15] angel says the Holy Ghost shall come
[1:09:18] upon you Hallelujah glory to God have
[1:09:22] you received the Holy Ghost for this
[1:09:24] hour have you receive the Angel's
[1:09:26] message of this hour which is the
[1:09:29] evidence of the Holy Ghost in your life
[1:09:32] because if you have there's nothing more
[1:09:34] that you need to do but Surrender Your
[1:09:36] Vessel unto the Lord and do like Mary
[1:09:39] when she said be it unto me according to
[1:09:41] thy
[1:09:44] Worden glory to God Amen the Holy Ghost
[1:09:48] shall come upon thee you have nothing to
[1:09:51] do but believe and she says be it unto
[1:09:53] me it was time for God to reveal the
[1:09:56] prophecy of the Virgin that was made not
[1:09:59] just 800 years ago but the one that was
[1:10:02] made back in Genesis chapter 3 that I
[1:10:05] will put enmity between your seed and
[1:10:08] her seed her seed need to come to the
[1:10:11] Earth the word needed to be restored and
[1:10:14] God had to find not some woman that
[1:10:17] could be artificially or or could be
[1:10:20] inseminated by another man because God
[1:10:23] wanted the plan that he had from the
[1:10:25] beginning when he said replenish
[1:10:27] multiply he meant speak the
[1:10:30] word all he had to do was speak the word
[1:10:33] eve bring forth brother Desmond
[1:10:37] Hallelujah bring forth Sister Sarah
[1:10:40] bring forth brother Derek bring them
[1:10:43] forth in the name of the Lord and they
[1:10:45] would have been they would have come
[1:10:47] into manifestation by just a dimensional
[1:10:49] change and saying hallelujah what's the
[1:10:53] plan and what are we doing I know the
[1:10:55] Lord said that we're coming down because
[1:10:58] God was God had a plan but this plan
[1:11:01] unveiled in a different way it had to be
[1:11:04] a Plan of Redemption so that we could
[1:11:06] come into our position so that we could
[1:11:09] find our place so that we could be a
[1:11:12] part of this great plan that we're
[1:11:13] rejoicing around today amen glory to God
[1:11:17] Jesus Christ Adam was the Old Testament
[1:11:19] while the Bride of Jesus Christ is is
[1:11:22] she she's all about the New Testament
[1:11:25] amen praise God you can't have the old
[1:11:27] without the new because the old is the
[1:11:30] new concealing the old and the old is
[1:11:33] the new concealing the new Hallelujah it
[1:11:37] was always Jesus Christ the same
[1:11:39] yesterday today and
[1:11:41] forever it'll always be him amen praise
[1:11:44] God it was time for the prophecy to be
[1:11:47] fulfilled the anointed word which was
[1:11:50] Jesus who was the prophecy of the seed
[1:11:53] that would come through the woman Mary
[1:11:55] amen praise God I just want to read a
[1:11:57] little quote here uh may I add to this
[1:12:01] woman Grace Mary may I place her in the
[1:12:05] Bible also is called the elect lady
[1:12:10] brother Brandon from the invisible Union
[1:12:12] of the bride of Christ this misg Grace

[1:12:17] declares said to the elect lady that if
[1:12:21] you notice elect come from the word
[1:12:24] elected lady if you go back and search
[1:12:27] it that he says our lady amongst all
[1:12:31] other ladies was elected like the Virgin
[1:12:34] was to bring forth the body of God on
[1:12:36] the earth she was an elected woman God
[1:12:40] chose Mary and also God has chose an
[1:12:43] elected lady which is his bride in this
[1:12:47] hour remember everything is in type form
[1:12:50] if you can't see Jesus Christ the same
[1:12:52] yesterday today and forever from Genesis
[1:12:55] all the way through Revelation go back
[1:12:57] and read it again by the open word
[1:12:59] that's been revealed to you now by the
[1:13:01] Holy Ghost you can't miss it you'll see
[1:13:04] it everywhere you'll see Joseph in his
[1:13:06] type Joseph a perfect type of Jesus
[1:13:08] Christ when he when he when he was sold
[1:13:10] for for so many pieces of silver like
[1:13:12] Christ was sold for so many pieces of
[1:13:14] silver thrown into a pit just like
[1:13:16] Christ when he went to to to Calvary and
[1:13:19] then he was risen by the by the god of
[1:13:22] that time the the the the the the god of
[1:13:24] Egypt uh and and put right next to uh to

[1:13:35] got a gentile bride just like Joseph he
[1:13:38] had a gentile bride amen and when Jesus
[1:13:41] when God when when Joseph went to reveal
[1:13:43] himself to his sons and and to his
[1:13:46] brothers he put his wife in The Palace a
[1:13:49] type of the church the Gentile Bride In

[1:14:02] miss Christ all the way through the
[1:14:04] Bible he's there I'm just giving you a
[1:14:06] quick example of Joseph as a perfect
[1:14:09] type amen it was all prophecy it was all
[1:14:14] prophecy in their lives being fulfilled
[1:14:17] they had to come into the identification
[1:14:19] of their position like Joseph he had to
[1:14:22] realize what God was doing and realized
[1:14:25] it when he said God has done all of this
[1:14:27] for good amen so that he could save the
[1:14:31] world so that he could save his bride
[1:14:34] and he could save the 144,000 the elect
[1:14:37] of Israel amen praise God forever more
[1:14:42] amen glory to God let's continue reading
[1:14:46] here in Luke chapter 1 verses 32-
[1:14:53] 38 he shall be
[1:14:55] great this is just continuation and
[1:14:58] shall be called the son of the highest
[1:15:01] and the Lord God shall give unto him the
[1:15:03] Throne of his father David and he shall
[1:15:06] reign over the house of Jacob forever
[1:15:10] and of his kingdom there shall be no end
[1:15:13] then said Mary unto the angel how shall
[1:15:16] this be see and I know not a
[1:15:19] man and the angel answered and said unto
[1:15:22] her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee
[1:15:24] and the power of the highest shall
[1:15:26] overshadow thee and I say the same thing
[1:15:28] to you the Holy Ghost needs to come over
[1:15:32] thee you need to be baptized in the name
[1:15:34] of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[1:15:36] remission of your sins you shall receive
[1:15:39] the gift of the Holy Ghost amen and if
[1:15:43] there's an elected attribute seed of God
[1:15:45] in there and when the spirit of God
[1:15:47] comes on that seed it'll awaken back to
[1:15:50] its original position as a son or a
[1:15:53] daughter of God Amen praise God and
[1:15:55] it'll guide you the Holy Ghost it'll
[1:15:57] what guide you into all truth the Holy
[1:15:59] Ghost shall come upon thee and the power
[1:16:01] of the high shall overshadow thee
[1:16:03] therefore also that Holy thing which be
[1:16:06] born of thee shall be called The Son of
[1:16:09] God God now was coming to restore Adam
[1:16:14] in his fullness amen and there was only
[1:16:17] one way that it could be done it had to
[1:16:20] come through Mary it had to come through
[1:16:24] the original plan of God otherwise every
[1:16:28] single man regardless every single man
[1:16:33] that would come as a result of sex would
[1:16:36] be born in sin shaped in iniquity would
[1:16:39] be speaking lies it would it would not
[1:16:42] reverse the original curse that took
[1:16:44] place back in the Garden of Eden man man
[1:16:47] has got a beastly nature on him whether
[1:16:49] you know it or
[1:16:51] not that's why you get this this desire
[1:16:54] this lust uh you know passion for for
[1:16:57] for the things of the world because
[1:16:58] you're you're of human nature there's a
[1:17:01] character on you that came as a result
[1:17:03] of the beastly nature that came through
[1:17:07] the the serpent seed because that seed
[1:17:09] got injected into all of
[1:17:13] humanity doesn't matter if you're born
[1:17:15] of of
[1:17:17] blood that resulted from back from the
[1:17:20] Garden of Eden through through a a sex
[1:17:22] act then you're born in you're shaped in
[1:17:25] iniquity Jesus had to reverse the curse
[1:17:29] in order to bring Eve on the
[1:17:31] scene because Eve was in him and he
[1:17:35] wanted to fulfill the whole Plan of
[1:17:37] Redemption amen praise God and so God
[1:17:41] himself had to come a son listen he goes
[1:17:44] on he says and behold thy cousin
[1:17:47] Elizabeth she hath also conceived a son
[1:17:51] in her old age and this is the sixth
[1:17:54] month with her who was called Barren for
[1:17:58] with God nothing shall be impossible and
[1:18:00] Mary said behold the hand made of the
[1:18:04] Lord be it unto me according to Thy word
[1:18:08] she believed the word amen we cannot
[1:18:13] overemphasize why we we so emphasize the
[1:18:16] word we tell somebody we
[1:18:19] say listen I see you rejoicing as a
[1:18:23] Christian
[1:18:25] but you can ask him this question have
[1:18:27] you received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:18:30] believed because I can see outwardly
[1:18:33] that you go to
[1:18:35] church you name the name of
[1:18:38] Jesus you worship Him you go to Sunday
[1:18:42] school your children go to Sunday
[1:18:44] school but my question is this have you
[1:18:47] received the Holy Ghost just like Acts
[1:18:49] 19 when Paul come across those
[1:18:52] disciples they were rejoicing Around
[1:18:55] Jesus Christ he asked them what do you
[1:18:57] what you know I see that you're
[1:18:59] rejoicing what's going on here oh we're
[1:19:01] rejoicing over the baptism of of John
[1:19:04] the
[1:19:06] Baptist he says but if you receive the
[1:19:09] Holy Ghost since then because Jesus said
[1:19:14] he baptized you with water but I'm going
[1:19:15] to baptize you with fire which is the
[1:19:18] Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is the is
[1:19:22] Christ himself in your day amen when
[1:19:25] Jesus came to the Earth he was he was in
[1:19:29] flesh God in flesh the Holy Ghost is in
[1:19:32] spirit but even in the flesh when he
[1:19:35] stood before all those religious leaders
[1:19:37] of that day they couldn't recognize that
[1:19:39] he was the
[1:19:40] Messiah that he was Christ and they
[1:19:44] rejected him and they'll do the same
[1:19:47] thing today when the Holy Ghost is in
[1:19:51] you and you will go to them and you will
[1:19:53] speak about the word of God and the
[1:19:55] message of this hour and what God has
[1:19:57] done let's read on
[1:19:59] here says and the angel departed from
[1:20:04] her amen glory to
[1:20:07] God and Mary said behold the handmaid of
[1:20:10] the Lord beat unto me Accord and the
[1:20:11] angel departed from her now let's go
[1:20:15] on Amen what can we draw from this well
[1:20:19] the Lord sends a sends a messenger to
[1:20:22] the Virgin and says she's highly favored
[1:20:24] says the Lord is with her she is blessed
[1:20:27] among other women types of all the
[1:20:29] churches yet she's astounded by what she
[1:20:32] heard the angel tells her she's found
[1:20:34] favor and so forth tells Mary that she
[1:20:36] is not alone in this Supernatural
[1:20:39] calling glory to God aren't you glad I
[1:20:43] was glad when I went into Gabriel fet's
[1:20:46] uh uh you know uh furniture store there
[1:20:48] and and and the Holy Spirit uh awoke me
[1:20:51] because then I realized when when I came
[1:20:53] to realize what had taken place and I
[1:20:56] come into that little white church on
[1:20:58] Winona there praise God I I I I was I
[1:21:02] was mesmerized that there was other
[1:21:04] people that actually believed this
[1:21:07] word glory to God because it was
[1:21:10] unusual it was very unusual it happened
[1:21:14] in a very unusual way all my family
[1:21:16] thought what in the world is going on
[1:21:18] with you glory I said praise God the
[1:21:22] Holy Ghost has come upon me
[1:21:24] [Music]
[1:21:25] what do you mean Holy Ghost what what
[1:21:27] what Holy Ghost I can't explain it but
[1:21:30] I'm reading the word of God and I can
[1:21:32] see it as clear as day that there's a
[1:21:35] great deception in the land and the
[1:21:37] people are worshiping things that they
[1:21:39] know not what they worship oh
[1:21:42] yes in vain they're worshiping the Lord
[1:21:45] but here when your eyes are open to
[1:21:47] recognize the word you come to realize
[1:21:49] that there's others God didn't make it
[1:21:52] just you no
[1:21:54] Hallelujah tells her tells her that
[1:21:57] listen your cousin is going to accept
[1:22:02] this
[1:22:03] word because I've done a miracle in her
[1:22:06] life too amen praise God let's move
[1:22:08] along here how do we know that she
[1:22:11] recognized she was a part of the
[1:22:14] prophecy how did she how did she
[1:22:17] understand that she was a part of the
[1:22:18] prophecy amen praise God glory to God
[1:22:21] let's read on uh next uh scripture here
[1:22:24] we we we move on here from 39 to 45
[1:22:28] let's read it and Mary arose in those
[1:22:31] days and went into the Hill Country with
[1:22:34] haste glory to God let me tell you when
[1:22:36] the when the fire of God gets under you
[1:22:38] and you've received something that's
[1:22:40] real in your life you can't wait to tell
[1:22:43] people hallelujah doesn't matter how
[1:22:45] strange it looked I had friends down at
[1:22:48] the market that man I go down south with
[1:22:51] them we'd party together drink together
[1:22:54] gamble together do all kinds of things
[1:22:57] and the very next month after the Holy
[1:22:59] Spirit had taken a hold they're looking
[1:23:01] and they're
[1:23:02] going what what's what what's going on
[1:23:07] here they couldn't understand but I was
[1:23:10] zealous I wanted to tell them the holy
[1:23:12] ghost is real I would say I would tell
[1:23:14] them God is real you know you know the
[1:23:17] god that that that everybody talks about
[1:23:19] and you know all these religions and all
[1:23:21] these yeah yeah yeah they're talking
[1:23:22] about all the time it's on TV Danny come
[1:23:24] on it's everywhere this and that yeah no
[1:23:26] no but he's
[1:23:27] real he delivered me from a cocaine
[1:23:30] addiction that I was that I was under
[1:23:32] bondage for 13 years I was just like
[1:23:34] that blind man that his eyes were open
[1:23:36] don't you tell that blind man that his
[1:23:38] eyes aren't open don't you tell me what
[1:23:41] what what's taking place in me I I can't
[1:23:44] understand it but it's gone the
[1:23:46] addiction is gone he's opened my eyes I
[1:23:49] don't care what your priest says I don't
[1:23:51] care what your your pastor says I can
[1:23:53] tell you that that he is a living God
[1:23:56] and he's still a miracle working God and
[1:23:58] he and he's got a word it's not only the
[1:24:01] miracle but now the word has become a
[1:24:04] reality Hallelujah that's what really
[1:24:07] listen the Miracles is to just draw the
[1:24:09] attention Jesus did many miracles but it
[1:24:12] was to the word they he wanted them to
[1:24:15] recognize who he
[1:24:17] was he would get frustrated with his
[1:24:20] disciples they'd come to him and say
[1:24:22] Lord you know gee we you know we see
[1:24:25] that you're the the the the Messiah uh
[1:24:28] can I sit on your right hand John and J
[1:24:31] can I sit on your left hand can can we
[1:24:32] be and he look he
[1:24:35] says oh my gosh what's the matter do you
[1:24:37] guys realize what's what's going on here
[1:24:40] you see you got to recognize your day
[1:24:43] and its message amen it brings you and
[1:24:46] it grounds you into a reality of God
[1:24:50] being a reality so she hasted into the
[1:24:52] city of Judah and entered into the house
[1:24:54] of Zacharias and saluted Elizabeth and
[1:24:58] it came to pass that when Elizabeth
[1:25:00] heard the salutation of Mary the baby
[1:25:04] leaped in her womb glory to God
[1:25:06] hallelujah listen when you tell somebody
[1:25:09] about this message if there is a seed
[1:25:12] germ of God an attribute of God in that
[1:25:15] individual and they hear this message
[1:25:17] something is going to change in them
[1:25:19] don't you worry you won't have to do
[1:25:21] anything they're going to just realize
[1:25:23] something has just come to life in me
[1:25:26] and so here now the moment that she
[1:25:28] heard the salutation she heard the
[1:25:30] testimony the word it came to pass that
[1:25:32] when Elizabeth heard the salutation the
[1:25:35] baby leaped in her womb and spake out
[1:25:37] with a loud voice and said and and
[1:25:40] Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:25:42] and she spake out with a loud voice and
[1:25:45] said blessed art thou amongst women and
[1:25:48] blessed is the fruit of thy womb she
[1:25:51] understood and she believed Mary's
[1:25:54] testimony
[1:25:56] amen glory to God Amen because she was a
[1:26:00] part of that testimony she was a part of
[1:26:03] that prophecy she was going to bring
[1:26:05] forth John the Baptist amen who would be
[1:26:08] the one that would introduce the Messiah
[1:26:11] to the world 30 years later praise God
[1:26:15] Amen but here the prophecy is now in
[1:26:18] progress we've been listen I've been in
[1:26:20] this message now for I'm in my 31st year
[1:26:24] I was sitting back yesterday while I was
[1:26:26] here studying and praying and I was just
[1:26:28] thinking about everything and the Lord
[1:26:30] brought it all he just flashed my whole
[1:26:31] life before me again he says you know
[1:26:34] it's been 30 years that you've been
[1:26:37] serving me and now you're in your your
[1:26:38] 31st year I said yes Lord he says you
[1:26:42] know that Jesus Christ came into his
[1:26:44] public Ministry after 30 years listen
[1:26:46] God will show you types God will show
[1:26:49] you how he's in your life he does that
[1:26:51] not to exalt me I'm not telling you this
[1:26:53] listen I've had some Supernatural
[1:26:55] experiences trust me when I tell you
[1:26:57] I've seen the pillar of fire I've been
[1:26:59] in his presence I know what the things
[1:27:01] that have happened that's why I can be
[1:27:03] as zealous as I am amen but praise God
[1:27:06] he started bringing all these things and
[1:27:08] and all these thoughts start coming in
[1:27:10] my mind and here now we are in our
[1:27:12] public Ministry Jesus comes to Mary at
[1:27:17] at at at a time and 30 years later Jesus
[1:27:20] goes and starts into his public Ministry
[1:27:24] Hallelujah what's going on Saints
[1:27:27] prophecy God wants us to identify with
[1:27:30] the prophecy these planetary alignments
[1:27:34] and these all these things that are
[1:27:36] going to happen next Friday there's
[1:27:37] going to be a red there's going to be a
[1:27:38] blue moon it's going to be a a dark red
[1:27:41] moon it's something that only happens uh
[1:27:43] very very uh uh periodically doesn't
[1:27:48] happen hundreds of years whatever it is
[1:27:50] I can't remember the last one but but
[1:27:53] it's significant because we know that
[1:27:55] God's Bible the first one was written in
[1:27:58] the
[1:27:59] heavens and so we need to be able to
[1:28:02] identify the prophecies identify the
[1:28:05] things that are happening around us and
[1:28:07] then identify ourselves in the
[1:28:10] prophecy Hallelujah glory to God God
[1:28:13] doesn't do anything by accident here he
[1:28:16] is he says he goes blessed are thou
[1:28:18] amongst women blessed is the fruit of
[1:28:21] thy womb and then she goes on and whence
[1:28:24] is this to me that the mother of my Lord
[1:28:27] should come to
[1:28:29] me now don't get messed up when she says
[1:28:32] mother of my
[1:28:34] Lord okay mother just means carrier amen
[1:28:40] carrier she was the carrier of the seed
[1:28:43] amen okay amen she was the carrier of
[1:28:46] the seed which was the the Bible says
[1:28:49] that that we are that we are saved by
[1:28:52] the blood of God Amen it's not through
[1:28:54] the blood of any man Joseph had nothing
[1:28:57] to do with it Mary egg had nothing to do
[1:29:00] with it it was pure word Gene attribute
[1:29:04] that was placed inside of Mary's womb
[1:29:07] amen and so but she recognizes the
[1:29:10] supernatural
[1:29:12] element Elizabeth she's she's she's
[1:29:16] realizing here and and and she's going
[1:29:19] how can this be for low as soon as the
[1:29:21] voice of thy salutation sounded in my
[1:29:24] ears the baby leaped in my womb for joy
[1:29:28] and blessed is she that
[1:29:31] believed she's saying glory to God Mary
[1:29:34] I am so grateful to know that you
[1:29:37] believe this word amen because it's it's
[1:29:40] going to bring to pass look at and
[1:29:42] blessed is she that believe for there
[1:29:44] shall be performed of those things which
[1:29:47] were told her from the Lord when he said
[1:29:50] he's going to be the the Messiah he's
[1:29:52] going to be the god he's going to be the
[1:29:55] the the the the true one he shall be
[1:29:58] Emmanuel God the word made flesh it will
[1:30:01] bring about the plan glory to God she
[1:30:05] was excited when she heard what had been
[1:30:07] said blessed is she she believed amen
[1:30:11] glory to God listen he says here in
[1:30:14] Mary's belief uh brother brandham in
[1:30:16] 1960 says it made it listen it made this
[1:30:20] little baby come to life in the wombs of
[1:30:23] its
[1:30:25] mother and in the womb of the mother and
[1:30:28] leap for joy and the Bible said that
[1:30:31] John was born from his mother's
[1:30:34] womb full of the Holy Ghost not only
[1:30:38] that by but while he was in the womb the
[1:30:42] Holy Ghost upon him his own mother
[1:30:47] received the Holy Ghost and prophesied
[1:30:50] saying and gave prophecy concerning him
[1:30:53] and concerning the Lord Jesus hallelujah
[1:30:57] praise God listen when when somebody
[1:31:01] comes to you and shares this message and
[1:31:04] you receive it it's going to transform
[1:31:07] your life and all of a sudden you're
[1:31:08] going to become a conduit for the
[1:31:13] word you're going to you're going to be
[1:31:15] you're going to believe all that the
[1:31:17] prophet said because the Holy Ghost upon
[1:31:20] you is going to discern the word of God
[1:31:22] for this day and for for this hour amen
[1:31:25] praise God the moment Mary spoke to
[1:31:27] Elizabeth that attribute came and leaped
[1:31:30] for Joy she was also in the prophecy M
[1:31:33] Mary was in the prophecy and so was
[1:31:36] Elizabeth in the prophecy and they both
[1:31:38] came to realize that they were a part of
[1:31:40] the prophecy of the day amen she knew
[1:31:43] she was able to bring forth her part in
[1:31:46] the word and Elizabeth could see that it
[1:31:48] was
[1:31:49] Revelation glory to God you know that
[1:31:52] there was a prophecy in Isaiah chapter
[1:31:54] 40 that talked about John the Baptist
[1:31:58] the voice of him that crith in the
[1:31:59] wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[1:32:02] Lord amen make straight in the desert a
[1:32:06] highway for our God amen glory to God
[1:32:10] but listen I want you to notice here now
[1:32:13] we're going to look at the other side of
[1:32:14] the coin here because the angel first
[1:32:18] appeared to Zachariah if we go back now
[1:32:21] to the next slide here
[1:32:24] notice here in Luke chapter 1 we're
[1:32:27] going to go back now to verse 11-6 and
[1:32:30] there appeared unto him an angel of the
[1:32:32] Lord standing on the right side of the
[1:32:35] altar of
[1:32:36] incense now Zachariah was a priest and
[1:32:39] he'd been praying that the Lord would
[1:32:41] give him a son amen would give him a
[1:32:45] child and and now the angel of the Lord
[1:32:47] comes and appears to him and when the
[1:32:50] and Zachariah saw him he he was troubled
[1:32:54] and fear fell upon him but the angel
[1:32:57] said unto him fear not Zacharias for thy
[1:33:00] prayer is heard and thy wife Elizabeth
[1:33:03] shall bear thee a son and thou shalt
[1:33:06] call his name John you see God gave him
[1:33:11] a a a revelation was coming to unveil
[1:33:15] the plan and make him a part of the
[1:33:17] prophecy but he couldn't quite see
[1:33:20] it and then and thou shalt have joy and
[1:33:23] glad and many shall rejoice at his birth
[1:33:27] for he shall be a great he shall be
[1:33:29] great in the sight of the Lord and shall
[1:33:31] drink neither wine nor nor strong drink
[1:33:34] and he shall be filled with the Holy
[1:33:35] Ghost even from his mother's womb and
[1:33:40] many of the children of Israel shall be
[1:33:42] turned to the Lord their god listen when
[1:33:46] Zacharias heard
[1:33:48] this he didn't believe
[1:33:51] it he couldn't believe it
[1:33:55] and you know what ended up happening to
[1:33:56] him read on he says and he shall go
[1:33:59] before him in the spirit and the power
[1:34:01] of Elijah Elias to turn the hearts of
[1:34:04] the fathers to the children and the
[1:34:07] disobedient to the wisdom of the just to
[1:34:10] make ready a people prepared for the
[1:34:12] Lord glory to God and Zachariah said
[1:34:15] unto the angel whereby shall I know
[1:34:20] this he's questioning how how you know
[1:34:23] in other words how's this possible and
[1:34:26] how am I going to know that you're
[1:34:27] actually going to do this imagine the
[1:34:30] angel appears to him and Zachariah said
[1:34:33] unto the angel where for I am an old
[1:34:35] man and my wife well stricken in years
[1:34:39] and the angel answering said unto him I
[1:34:41] am
[1:34:43] Gabriel I am the Messenger of the Lord
[1:34:46] amen listen until you come to a place
[1:34:49] where you've got a supernatural
[1:34:51] experience with the angel of God God
[1:34:54] where with the spirit of God unveils
[1:34:56] himself and makes himself real to you
[1:34:59] you will you will fall in doubt you will
[1:35:02] you you you'll be questioning this
[1:35:04] questioning that you'll be looking for
[1:35:06] an interpretation on this trying to make
[1:35:08] something come about by your own means
[1:35:10] amen he said I am Gabriel that stand in
[1:35:13] the presence of God and have sent to
[1:35:16] speak unto thee and to show these that
[1:35:20] show thee these Glad Tidings and behold
[1:35:23] th th shalt be
[1:35:26] dumb and not able to speak until the day
[1:35:30] that these things shall be performed
[1:35:32] because thou believest not my words
[1:35:34] which shall be fulfilled in their
[1:35:39] season I'll tell you something Saints
[1:35:41] you're going to talk to people and they
[1:35:43] are not going to believe and I'll tell
[1:35:45] you they will just get Dumber they will
[1:35:48] not they they'll they'll get further and
[1:35:50] further away from God they'll reject the
[1:35:53] word word it'll take until it actually
[1:35:56] comes to pass and then it'll be too late
[1:36:00] at that time it'll be too late for them
[1:36:02] to recognize what God has done it'll be
[1:36:04] too late it'll be because remember Mary
[1:36:07] represented the wise virgin and Jesus
[1:36:10] gave a parable of the wise and the
[1:36:12] foolish virgin the wise virgin she's got
[1:36:15] the Holy Ghost she's got oil in her lamp
[1:36:18] amen the the the foolish virgin they're
[1:36:20] they're going to come to a place where
[1:36:22] they're going to look and they're going
[1:36:23] to see wait a minute here you know Danny
[1:36:27] John Mike Tim
[1:36:31] Phillip the they've been talking about
[1:36:33] all these these prophecies that would
[1:36:35] take place all these things that would
[1:36:38] happen in the political uh landscape how
[1:36:40] the world would just go further into
[1:36:43] turmoil further into confusion how there
[1:36:47] would be corruption to the levels of
[1:36:49] government like they've never seen we we
[1:36:51] said it because we saw thought back in
[1:36:54] the Old Testament and history was just
[1:36:56] repeating itself remember the Old
[1:36:59] Testament is is a concealed version of
[1:37:01] the New Testament revealed amen all the
[1:37:04] things all the unbelief all the the the
[1:37:07] the mystery of iniquity they thought
[1:37:09] that the big church that the Catholic
[1:37:11] Church would be the greatest Church on
[1:37:14] Earth but in there lies the greatest
[1:37:17] deception I'm not talking about the
[1:37:19] people the people that recognize they're
[1:37:22] going to come out of her my people they
[1:37:24] will come out of that deception they
[1:37:26] won't bow down to a worship of Mary this
[1:37:30] is the real understanding of Mary if you
[1:37:33] want to know what Mary represented you
[1:37:35] need to listen to this message you need
[1:37:37] to pay attention go back and read the
[1:37:39] scriptures and see how Mary represented
[1:37:42] she's a sister she's a daughter of God
[1:37:47] Amen she was a vessel she was used as a
[1:37:50] vessel because the Holy Ghost Came Upon
[1:37:53] her to bring forth the Son of God and
[1:37:57] Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost has come
[1:37:59] upon you in these last days amen
[1:38:02] hallelujah to bring forth the Son of God
[1:38:05] again into perfect manifestation through
[1:38:08] a a bride Ministry that believes the
[1:38:11] word of God that says be it unto me
[1:38:14] according to Thy word she will not bow
[1:38:16] down to man's tradition man's teachings
[1:38:20] man's man's injection of himself try to
[1:38:24] make himself something praise God the
[1:38:26] way up with God is go down get humble
[1:38:29] before the
[1:38:31] Lord humble yourself before his presence
[1:38:34] he's still the Living God that can open
[1:38:37] the eyes and shut the eyes when he wants
[1:38:39] to amen amen glory to God hallelujah and
[1:38:43] he says and he he he says that uh he's
[1:38:47] going to do his part in his season God
[1:38:50] is going to bring about these things now
[1:38:53] let's let's go to the next slide here
[1:38:55] we're going to close here in a minute
[1:38:57] now this little virgin was all excited
[1:39:00] notice here's what I I like about Mary
[1:39:03] amen instead of doubting like Zacharias
[1:39:05] that preacher she said behold the hands
[1:39:08] made of the Lord be it unto me according
[1:39:11] to your word she didn't try to figure it
[1:39:13] out all like like he did why he said now
[1:39:17] look my wife's old and so forth like
[1:39:20] this we have plenty of examples look at
[1:39:22] Hagar at the temple look at Sarah many
[1:39:26] of the old women had many children by
[1:39:28] God's blessings upon them and he had
[1:39:31] plenty of examples but he had she she
[1:39:35] had to believe something that had never
[1:39:39] happened glory to God Amen and I'm
[1:39:42] telling you that we are living in a day
[1:39:44] let the musicians come we are living in
[1:39:46] a day where something is going to happen
[1:39:49] that has never happened Hallelujah glory
[1:39:52] to God amen there's going to be a church
[1:39:55] that in the moment and in the the
[1:39:57] twinkling of an eye she's going to be
[1:39:59] changed in a moment and this Mortal
[1:40:02] shall put on
[1:40:04] immortality glory to God in the moment
[1:40:06] in the twinkling of an eye this Mortal
[1:40:09] shall be changed and we which are alive
[1:40:12] and remain are going to not hinder those
[1:40:14] that are asleep because those that are
[1:40:17] dead in Christ that died under the
[1:40:20] revelation of Jesus Christ in their day
[1:40:23] you can go back into the old you listen
[1:40:26] you can go back over the last seven
[1:40:27] Church ages all the way back to the day
[1:40:29] of Pentecost and you will see that down
[1:40:33] through all those ages God had
[1:40:36] representation in the
[1:40:38] prophecy he had those that were
[1:40:40] identified in each and one of those ages
[1:40:43] and they had to bring forth the portion
[1:40:45] of the word that they represented some
[1:40:48] were anointed to be to be cut into
[1:40:51] pieces some were were anointed to be
[1:40:54] burned at the stake some were anointed
[1:40:57] to deal with with W with what the the
[1:41:00] the Dark Ages would produce women having
[1:41:02] their children cut right out of their
[1:41:04] bodies in front of their husbands had to
[1:41:07] endure those things but God gave them an
[1:41:10] anointing God placed on them the ability
[1:41:13] to overcome the age that they had to
[1:41:15] face how by the Holy Ghost amen and how
[1:41:19] are you going to overcome this age of of
[1:41:21] intellectual understanding where there's
[1:41:23] putting so many interpretations on God's
[1:41:26] word that how you going to know what's
[1:41:27] the truth there's only one way that you
[1:41:30] will know the truth Jesus Christ said I
[1:41:32] am the way the truth and the life and I
[1:41:36] will give you the comforter which is the
[1:41:38] Holy Ghost and he will guide you into
[1:41:42] all truth so that when you read about
[1:41:45] Mary you can understand her position you
[1:41:48] can see her part in the prophecy and
[1:41:50] then you can see where you fit in and
[1:41:52] how you represent her and how you
[1:41:54] identify with her glory to God
[1:41:57] hallelujah praise God forever more thank
[1:42:00] you Jesus
[1:42:04] Hallelujah let's close right here I've
[1:42:06] got a lot more but we'll continue next
