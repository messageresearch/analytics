TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] praise be to god good evening friends it's good to be in god's house praise his marvelous and wonderful name we're indeed delighted and happy to be here to teach the word of god on the seven church ages now our topic for tonight will be the victorious christ thanks be to god that when they placed him in the tomb thinking that he was defeated and conquered he was unconquerable amen he rose up i am the resurrection and the life amen thanks be to god hallelujah that we serve the mighty conqueror jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever the ever-living one hallelujah the victorious one amen let us pray our gracious heavenly father we thank you for this marvelous and glorious opportunity of being in your house around your word united with your people may the great holy spirit father take glory and honor in everything we do and say and may you my father in heaven may you delight and joy in the going forth of thy truth we ask it in jesus name amen and amen out of the scriptures revelation chapter 1 verses 17 and 18 and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am a life forevermore amen and have the keys of death of hell and of death amen glory to god hallelujah think of it john caught up into this vision of the victorious christ my friends if you have really had a genuine god set holy ghost vision especially a vision of jesus christ then you will understand this supernatural effects of a great anointed holy spirit vision upon an individual's body the natural coming in contact with this supernatural so john is speaking here in the word or recording in the word the effects of this vision of the resurrected and victorious christ that he beheld that he was blessed to see this risen one hallelujah amen so he said and i fell at his feet as dead or as one that is dead or one that appears dead oh so the first effect of the vision was that he fell at the feet of jesus as one dead spiritually speaking it's speaking to us how the john a type of the bride of christ a type of the church falls at the feet of the revealed word as one that has died out to himself and every one of us when we come to a place of a revelation or behold the transfigured word of god before us in sight our inside sight our spiritual sight the eyes of the heart it creates the atmosphere where you desire and surrender yourself to die out to yourself and the works of the flesh and the sincerity and the sobriety of the holy spirit takes a hold of the individual that this is not a fiction fantasy or something made up by man but it is a work of god god working on the human heart and through the human being and making himself known so the vision took away john's natural strength real prophet of god making the word of god manifest and after finishing his physical body would be weak we can go through the bible and see danielle and others after they've had a vision of of the almighty a vision of the lord that they are weak they are as one that uh is dead a tight hair we can see it that we need to die out to ourselves and become weak with our flesh in other words perfect strength god's perfect strength is made manifest in our human weakness as paul the apostle said so he gave away or surrendered his natural strength a man of the flesh that he might gain the strength of god he may gain the anointing of the holy spirit upon his life that he might be a fully sacrificial and dedicated servant of the lord that's what we need in our day that we might come to him surrendering our lives uh that he might flow through us and himself to the world amen hallelujah so john died out to himself he died to himself and there it is that the bible tells us and our right hand is the right hand touched him glory to god the right hand the hand of the lord jesus touched him and here he was brother sister that he could be raised up and stand upon his feet because he had fallen at the feet of the of the word in worship in wonder oh and ready to do the work of god and to give god all the glory and all the praise glory to god so the right hand touched them tenderly with love and as the hand that raised thee lame man and says stand take up your bed and walk that same hand reaches out and touches john and raises him up my friends have you ever had a touch from jesus oh have you ever heard that song he somebody touched me somebody touched me while i was praying praying to jesus somebody touch my soul oh have you ever had a healing touch to your body have you ever had a supernatural touch of the lord upon your soul have you had a comforting touch upon your heart oh may we not just us touching the hem of his garment but may he turn and touch us and change our lives forever that we may bring glory to his marvelous name also i must say the very sound of his voice was a blessing to john the sound of god's voice to a true believer can never be underestimated just to hear the tones a crying baby hearing its mother's voice oh what a comfort to take away all her stress of his stress all the frustration all the murmurings the complainings the hunger the first is taken away once that baby hears its mother's voice oh what a comforting voice when a a a young boy or young woman is being attacked in some way or they allah and their father steps up on the scene and they hear his voice saying fear not for i am here i am with you oh what a blessed thing to hear the voice of god and john heard the voice of god that was comforting that same voice that says fear not don't you be afraid i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead but behold i am alive forever more oh praise god what is there to fear oh my what is there for us to fear i believe that fear is one of the worst spirits that has been attacking the body of jesus christ christians living their lives in fear fear of sickness fear of financial hardship fear of death all manner of pains and aches and troubles and trials and tribulations oh living constantly in some form of fear but what is there to fear what is there to dread when we are leading on the everlasting arms of our blessed lord jesus like john did when he was alive let us lean upon the word amen let's lean on this good friend the word of god for a friend that stick it closer than a brother you can trust him you can believe him for his word and his promises surely come to pass oh thank god we don't have to fear judgment anymore because my brothers they that live and believe on him have passed from death onto life we are living or having eternal life spiritually already a never-ending life resides within you made that anchor your soul your experience and your heart to the word of god knowing that heaven not hell not death not grave nothing can shake you or separate you from the love of god that is in the lord jesus christ for you are one of his own and his eyes are on the sparrow and he's watching over you never mind all that you may be going through now the judgment that was supposed to come upon us fell upon him at the cross and he took it upon himself he became our bumper he became our shock observer because he took the shock of sin he took the bops of the devil upon him for the bible said that he was afflicted but he opened not his mouth how there god struck him at calvary but he was the bumper he was the man standing in the gap oh my he was our redeemer our savior that stood the test of time oh glory to god here he is we thank you my my lord my savior i thank you well thank you for your wonderful works to the children of man as i was just saying he was her bumper or shock observer he was our substitute everything took upon himself my friends and because of that there is therefore no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus because he took it he took the condemnation he became sin for us he who knew no sin the peerless pure clear crystal clear word of god became my friends the one who took upon himself our sins and our sufferings and sicknesses and therefore there is no condemnation for he was not only our lawyer or our advocate but remember he is also the judge and the judge says pardoned the judge says you are not guilty the judge says case closed the judge says you are justified you are set free as if you never did anything wrong your record he has struck off every record every writing and every curse that was against you he struck it off by the blood of jesus christ that bleach blood of christ in which anything falls it makes it clears and takes away every guiltless stain and makes you free and makes your white ass snow my friends if you trust in him the word of god jesus christ hallelujah he has promised in his word on the on the path of confession on your past my friends of acting and demonstrating a committed consecrated and repentant life that he would forgive you of your sins and take you as his own if you do this now the lord jesus christ will come into your life and never ever leave you evermore lord of god so therefore my friends with our case settled with us being not guilty with us being in a set with us being a justice if nothing has ever happened before with us being in a state where every writing every charge that every accusation of the devil has been struck off by the word of god by the cleansing blood of jesus christ and now therefore there is no condemnation to you and i if we are in our lord jesus christ hallelujah so why should the church fear no promise he has made has ever failed and everywhere we should never live our christian life anymore in the fear of punishment we should not live our christian life in any fair of going to hell because the word of god tells us categorically we have already passed from death into life i want you to be conscious and clearly aware the genuine christian does not have any hell in their future we have gone into the fires of trials tribulation tests proving god proving his word that is his part of him and he has tried the word prove the word and we have come out like the three boys out of the fiery furnace and we have no fire and brimstone smell of hell upon our lives no worldliness upon our lives no smell of smoke upon our lives for we have been set free by the power and presence of god within our lives oh thank god i'm free i'm free free from this world of sin i've been washed in the blood i've been born again oh hallelujah i'm saved i'm saved by his wonderful grace oh thank god we are free to tonight and we give him all the praise the honor i give glory for this victorious christ for without his victory where would we be without jesus oh we would still be prisoners of satan but we are set free by the hand of the mighty lion of the tribe of judah who has broken our every chain and now we can shake off our shackles we can walk out of our prison doors we can walk into the glorious liberty of the sons of god the children of god the people of god and walk in the light of his presence the light of the word of the hour oh glory to god oh thank god that he is the mighty conqueror he is the one who wrapped the veil into yes he is the one who ripped it from the top to the bottom and opened the way the more excellent way into the presence of god so that we may come boldly before the throne of grace of god hallelujah mighty conqueror here he is the one who conquered the world of the scene and of the unseen demonstrated an authority over devils over every disease and even death demonstrating that he is the living one the one who conquers all why should we fear he is greater than alexander the so-called great who lived his life as a conqueror upon the earth and after a while at the age of 33 when there was nowhere else to turn nothing else to do after living a life and becoming a victim of sin a victim of his riotous living a victim of his own success may god help you that you do not become a victim of your so-called success that you do not become a victim of your ambitions but that you my friends surrender your life to the victorious christ that he might reign and rule within your heart and there was alexander after all his conquests died as a victim to his own wicked living and he also this victorious christ was not like napoleon bonaparte who conquered all europe and finally had to meet his defeat at waterloo and later as you know was banished to the to elba there he was at that time finding himself he who was a conqueror found himself conquered but this man after he had conquered he sat down hallelujah the case is settled he sat down it's over it is finished there is nothing now to fear nothing now to dread we lean upon his everlasting right arm of his power glory to god there was nothing that could conquer our lord jesus satan made so many stabs and at him the not this sword piercing not the spear piercing not the nails in his hands not the temptations on the mountain not any disease that ever came in his presence that could defeat him no trouble no trial not even death he rose up from the grave up from the graveyard rose with a mighty triumph oh hallelujah thank god for this victorious ever conquering christ the same one we bless his holy name lord of god and so he is greater than alexander the great and has ascended up into heaven to manifest what he has said her hair upon the earth and as the scripture says he has been given a name that is above every name that at the name of jesus because he has conquered all things at the name of jesus every knee shall bow why the king is coming and when the king is coming the heralds blew the trumpet and everything falls down at his feet every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess that jesus christ is indeed our lord and master conquering death hell and the grave and he has the keys thereof no one else has the keys of death hell and the grave oh my friends all these men made doctrines and teachings of men and symbolisms of man used to bring about paganistic trolldom upon the hearts minds and lives of men and women and keep them in the spiritual darkness of the word of god but rise shine your light is come and the glory of the lord is risen upon you come to him now and repent confess surrender if you are a christian walk deeper in his love walk deeper in his grace walk with confidence knowing that when you have come to the end of the way the last mile of the way oh friend you will walk out into life eternal you will not go down to the cliff of death or hell but you'll rise to live eternal in the presence of almighty god amen he whatever he loses hair on earth is loosed in heaven whatever he burns is bound thank god hallelujah i'm so happy about that hallelujah he alone is your savior we have no other savior we have no other mediator he is the only mediator between god and man jesus christ our lord our only savior our only redeemer oh glory to god hallelujah thank god he is the only god for he said i am the almighty beside me there is no other remember he didn't say i am the mighty or i am a mighty god he said i am the almighty and beside me there is no one two three other persons i am the only one there is only one god and his name is the lord jesus christ and i love him and thank god so god's speaking now don't fear john that same voice that spoke to john john was a microcosm a type of the bride of christ that was to come and god speaking to john back there saying don't fear john that same voice that same voice of god is speaking to the bride of the day saying don't fear little bride don't fear little flock no matter what you may be going through the rapture is at hand i am coming again i promised according to the word amen that i go to prepare a place for you that where i am you may be also you may be there i want you to take you to my father's house come and go with me to my father's house where there is joy and peace and love and we can walk hand in hand together just to think of it the king and i the king and you you and i can walk with the king glory hallelujah praise god we can walk in victory walk in boldness walking truth walk with the joy and peace of god within our heart don't fear little flock all that i am you are here too oh thank god hallelujah oh we sing the song my father is rich in houses and lands oh thank god and i'm a child of the king whatever he owns belongs to us and i'm not just speaking naturally i'm speaking spiritually here mainly about the fullness of the treasure house of god's word has been opened up to us it's been unlocked and now all the treasures of god the wisdom of god the mystery of god hallelujah you are you have now i have become also an heir to the revelation of the mystery of god oh i wish i could make all men see what is the fellowship of this mystery of the lord jesus christ that is now revealed all his power is yours hallelujah for all power belongs to god and god belongs to you therefore all power belongs to you all powers in you and is ready to be made manifest through you for god's glory amen all his omnipotence lives in you as the children of god and he stands in the midst of the seven candlesticks he stands in the midst of you he stands within your heart he lives upon the throne of your soul hallelujah and thank god we serve a god who did not come to bring fear but he came to bring love and peace and joy and long suffering he came to bring to you comfort he did not come to bring to you failure but he came to bring to you an rebels winning spirit and that is the spirit that god has within your life if you're a true believer you are not a failure you're a widow you're a you you are one who can say i am more than a conqueror through him that led us thank god let me repeat you are not a failure you are not a loser you are a winner for the mighty conqueror lives within you the victorious christ lives within you that makes you a conqueror that makes you a victor for greater is he that lives within you then he that is fighting against us in the world hallelujah glory to god thank god that he came to bring his love and his courage his abilities as dunamis the abilities of the holy spirit reside within us we are receptacles for his presence who lives within us oh glory to god we have put on christ hallelujah and the lord jesus christ has put us on god living inside of us and through us for all power is given unto him and all of that power is now ours to use for his glory if we know how if we allow the holy spirit to teach us how all his power is for us to use first of all of course the first principle will be to know when and how under his direction to speak the word for the entire creation entire world everything that has ever been formed or done was done by the spoken word of god but it's not just speaking the bible of reading a verse neither is it it's just standing there and saying let this be here and let that be there it's not simple as that it's us it's just humbling yourself to god so that he can use you when he chooses to use you for his glory now that is part of the turtle of his divine presence and whatever god anoints you in an hour like that under his direction to perform or to share do it shall come to pass because he is the living one that lives in us and has made a grace covenant with us thank god now in this very chapter of revelation 1 moving on to verse 20 and the mystery of the seven stars which down source in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the angels or messengers of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which those sources are the seven churches hallelujah here right in the scriptures we have the interpretation we already have the truth we don't have to take what any man says or any person or school says but we can take what the lord himself says that these seven stars represent oh glory to god seven angels seven messengers at john's time that were to come amen hallelujah of course we realized that this was to come and also make clear that these seven candlesticks are speaking of the seven churches hallelujah oh my with god's help we'll look at these things within the word of god that we might grow and develop a clearer understanding of what god wants us to know hallelujah so the seven ages we know we are aware of these seven church ages spoken of in the book of revelation first three chapters for they are listed in the word of god and starting i believe next week we will begin by going into the first church age which will be the ephesian church age we shall begin to deal with that and i'm excited about it i want to do it with you i want to be able to feast with you at the lord's table around this word as we talk about the seven church ages but thank god upon thee upon sea and land as the mighty angel came down putting his foot upon the sea and one foot upon the land here stands the mighty ever-living god with his feet as straddling the globe the globe and the annals of all history there is stance with seven stars within his right hand and the seven golden candlesticks behind him as he stands and walks amongst them or what a scene to see him standing there breathtaking supreme deity hallelujah the other living mighty judge of all the earth standing there the priest the king the eagle the lion the lamb the alpha the omega the beginning the end the first the last the order and the finisher of our faith the father son holy ghost hallelujah him which was which is and which is to come the word he is the lamb that was slain hallelujah the word he won he has proved everything that he has said and he's proved himself that he has a right to all those offices or he has a right to all those names that all wrapped up in one glorious name jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever all the prison doors of hell shake at the name of jesus all the devils are paralyzed at the name of jesus all at the name of jesus demons devil's sins of diseases flee at the name of jesus for this is the name of the mighty righteous victorious and ever living one hallelujah yes there he stands announce the seven candlesticks with the stars in his hands my friends that should speak to us right there that he holds these stars within his hands it's speaking of night time night time whether it was night time right then or speaking of night time that is to come we know we are living in that age of laodicea and it's nighttime it's dark not just getting dark but it's dark the world is in darkness spiritually in every possible way we realize friends that that's the time when we light laps when we light the light stands ought to be lit oh glory to god is the same time also after that the sun is gone down that is when the stars come out to shine and friends within the present darkness in which we live god is looking to you and i for our lights to shine for we are the lord lights oh didn't the old song say let the lord lights be burning oh oh friends send your light throughout the lifeline across life's rough waters life stormy waters mary shiner lights and throughout the lifeline some ship wrecks up for long brother seeing this may take heart again rise and try again dear brother rise and try again dear sister do not give up but look up for jesus is coming again thank god the stars are here to do what to reflect the light that is not of their own but they reflect the light of the sun amen oh praise god hallelujah and we are here to reflect the light life of the son of god hallelujah what a blessed thing for us as believers to know that we can clean up shine up and prepare our lives to become reflectors of the life of the living one jesus christ the same yesterday today and forevermore do you know of what i'm speaking or if you only can come into a deep personal realization and revelation to which i am speaking and have the spiritual experience of him living within your soul our lord has departed from this earth and i have said last sunday if you've lost any coins sweep around search and find the lost coins and put them back into their place but our lord has departed the earth but thank god he has left us his spiritual presence in the form of the holy ghost that the holy spirit can indwell us and that he can shine through us our lives no wonder we say shine through me lord flow through me shine through me lord oh may the holy spirit shine through our lives may the presence of almighty god reflect through us to him be praise honor and glory the ever-living christ the other living one shining through life for his honor and glory amen and so he comes into our lives to give us oh spirit light if we are spiritually called to give us divine warmth oh praise god to live within us amen hallelujah and come to give us his life to give us his light or understanding revelation of truth and to empower us or to give us his power of the baptism and infilling and possession by the holy spirit thanks be to god oh that we may get a glimpse of him as john did i know isaiah's have a glimpse of him but i uh tonight my friends i don't want to be carried away for isaiah was also caught a vision of him and watch at the effects of the vision on isaiah you may study that in isaiah chapter 6 you'll find where isaiah had the vision of him and had had to fall down at his feet and how the coal of fire touched the prophet making him as pure as pure can be then the voice of god said who go for us and isaiah answered here am i lord send me may you my friend answer his call and say here am i lord send me gracious father as we come to the end of this broadcast may the holy spirit anoint every heart and every life i send forth the parent presence of the holy spirit may he find his lost child may he find his lost seed and call your own to repentance
