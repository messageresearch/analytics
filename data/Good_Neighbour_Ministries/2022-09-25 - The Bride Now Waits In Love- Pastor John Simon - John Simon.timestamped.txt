[53:07] then when I walked in and the thought
[53:09] says oh my goodness those people are
[53:11] waiting I hope they have patience and
[53:14] then my thoughts went back and said oh
[53:16] but your subject is
[53:18] the bride

[53:24] I said oh my praise God hallelujah
[53:28] Brethren everything we do

[53:36] is God knows what he is doing

[53:48] this Earth to write
[53:50] whatever God does is Right amen amen no
[53:54] matter what you think he said look I
[53:57] made you you clean my hands if I want to
[54:00] make you smash you up break you up turn

[54:05] again what do you have to say about it I
[54:08] am the Creator I am the maker I'm the
[54:10] one that's doing these things and it's

[54:39] Lord bless you praise the Lord please be
[54:42] seated
[54:47] foreign
[54:57] 1965 and that would be paragraph uh 167.
[55:04] okay I repeat so that you may be able to
[55:08] afterwards check on it see whether the
[55:11] things I'm saying are true if they are
[55:13] in uh the message if they're in the
[55:17] Bible the word of God you're able to do
[55:19] that it's a God of this evil age 1965
[55:23] paragraph
[55:25] 167. okay and it begins like this this
[55:31] little faith woman
[55:33] that lives by faith amen the bride
[55:40] their bride that person may be here
[55:43] there here off somewhere else in some
[55:48] other Church
[55:51] some other denomination
[55:54] wherever it is she the bride
[55:59] you see the idea that the bread is only
[56:02] made up of the people who claim to be in
[56:05] the message
[56:06] that's not what he's talking about here
[56:09] this is 1965. he is telling you clearly
[56:13] the bride that person that's here
[56:19] there
[56:20] off here off somewhere else
[56:25] in some other Church
[56:27] some other denomination whatever it is
[56:32] you see the Bride is a makeup of
[56:36] wherever God has hid her or placed her
[56:40] this is just now the time of in
[56:43] gathering
[56:45] this is the time of the last Harvest
[56:48] and he is gathering in her in wherever
[56:52] she is notice he identifies his bright
[56:56] hair and he calls her
[57:00] this little faith woman amen isn't that
[57:04] wonderful to know that God looks on us
[57:08] as the little faith woman well of course
[57:12] faith is a revelation so this little
[57:15] Revelation woman this woman who has a
[57:19] thirst for Revelation from the hand of
[57:23] God hallelujah this as we preached last
[57:27] Christmas this wise woman amen for you
[57:32] are wise when you seek God uh his
[57:36] Shining Light of Revelation you are
[57:39] counted wise
[57:42] and we see that Wise Women as we spoke
[57:46] of at Christmas there how God dealt with
[57:50] them and uh Elizabeth and Mary and how
[57:54] God worked through their lives to make
[57:57] them a blessing amen hallelujah and a
[58:01] woman or a church or a person as wise
[58:05] amen when God works through them by
[58:09] revelation
[58:11] hallelujah praise God and when she lives
[58:16] by the revelation of the word of God
[58:18] that's what makes her wife she's not
[58:22] wise in her own eyes she's not wise with
[58:26] her own understanding she is not wise
[58:29] with any of the denominational teachings
[58:33] she is not made Wise by intellectual uh
[58:37] discussions of even this message she is
[58:41] not made Wise by all kinds of concerted
[58:44] convoluted ideas coming from the minds
[58:47] of man and then trying to present that
[58:50] to the mind of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[58:53] Hallelujah but thank God he has said the
[58:56] pure word
[58:58] and the true bride is able to discern it
[59:02] and to recognize it Hallelujah by
[59:06] Revelation through the presence of the
[59:09] holy spirit amen hallelujah amen yes
[59:14] listen here he says now she believes the
[59:18] word
[59:20] and then obedient to the word
[59:24] waiting in love
[59:27] for the promise of the age
[59:30] to be confirmed what is she waiting for
[59:34] for the promise of the age to be
[59:37] confirmed
[59:39] but this is what I'm saying be heard be
[59:42] recognized Time for Action but don't act
[59:45] uh prematurely wait on the presence of
[59:49] God wait on the direction of God let the
[59:53] Holy Spirit lead when he is ready he is
[59:57] the one that will come and cross
[59:59] everything to get into action and to
[1:00:02] move by the Holy Spirit hallelujah oh
[1:00:06] praise God hallelujah yes sir she is
[1:00:10] wise because she lives by revelation
[1:00:13] this woman is wise because she can't
[1:00:18] live without the presence of her husband
[1:00:21] who is the word
[1:00:23] she needs the word that she might live
[1:00:27] hallelujah amen you see uh because of
[1:00:32] this word that God has given when it's
[1:00:35] revealed to you then you have something
[1:00:38] to believe
[1:00:40] without the Revelation you see faith it
[1:00:45] doesn't have anything to believe
[1:00:46] somebody say oh I believe this I believe
[1:00:49] that but why do you believe it do you
[1:00:52] have a revelation of it or you believe
[1:00:54] it because you read it or you believe it
[1:00:57] because you heard somebody say it uh
[1:00:59] what do you believe see a revelation uh
[1:01:03] puts it this way as I repeat now uh
[1:01:06] Revelation the prophet said nobody can
[1:01:08] give you that
[1:01:09] God himself has to give you that
[1:01:12] you can't get it from anywhere amen so
[1:01:16] Revelation then is by grace
[1:01:20] because it's not you can't study
[1:01:22] yourself into it you can't go and break
[1:01:25] in the window or the door and climbing
[1:01:27] like a thief on a robber you think you
[1:01:30] can but you really can't because
[1:01:33] Revelation is by grace and grace alone
[1:01:37] hallelujah amen and because this woman
[1:01:41] believes the real has the revelation of
[1:01:45] the word she can see something that she
[1:01:48] can believe in
[1:01:50] and she can rest her face on that
[1:01:54] hallelujah amen so she believes the word
[1:01:58] and because she believes with it all her
[1:02:02] heart praise God do you believe the word
[1:02:05] do you believe the revealed word
[1:02:07] praise God it's a difference in
[1:02:10] believing the written word it's another
[1:02:12] thing to believe the revealed word which
[1:02:16] is not different than the written word
[1:02:18] is spiritually unveiled to the
[1:02:21] individual amen it doesn't change the
[1:02:24] word make the written word different or
[1:02:27] something or the other it's just a
[1:02:29] spiritual unveiling of the written word
[1:02:32] to the individual Hallelujah giving them
[1:02:36] confidence in God hallelujah amen praise
[1:02:40] God Amen yes sir so here uh we see in
[1:02:45] God's wonderful word that she believes
[1:02:49] the word and because she believes the
[1:02:53] word that is and that gets the word
[1:02:57] preeminence
[1:02:58] and by the word having preeminence in
[1:03:02] her life and leading her guiding her
[1:03:05] instructing her sons and does the god
[1:03:09] led by the spirit of God she
[1:03:12] unconsciously begins to walk into a life
[1:03:14] of spiritual obedience to the world
[1:03:20] Hallelujah she doesn't have to walk
[1:03:22] around uh saying oh you know Ten
[1:03:26] Commandments yeah the first commandment
[1:03:28] is this the second commandment is that
[1:03:30] or walk around with the New Testament
[1:03:33] now well I got to remember Jesus said uh
[1:03:36] be not angry in certain situations and
[1:03:39] remember Paul said that you shouldn't do
[1:03:42] this in the you don't go around with
[1:03:44] those things at all
[1:03:46] because your control is not from the
[1:03:50] outside James said we have a witness
[1:03:52] inside is that right Paul talks about
[1:03:56] the power that worketh within us
[1:03:59] the prophet said the Sheep doesn't give
[1:04:01] wool coming from the outside the world
[1:04:04] comes from the inside of the sheep a
[1:04:08] mule a fox a wolf that can't go and try
[1:04:14] to produce wool no they have to go kill
[1:04:18] a sheep and then take that wall and
[1:04:21] scrape it somehow and then try to put it
[1:04:23] on and try to make themselves into a
[1:04:26] sheep but a real sheep that woe comes
[1:04:29] from the inside
[1:04:31] they don't have to work themselves into
[1:04:33] producing woe they don't have to work
[1:04:35] themselves into getting virtues you
[1:04:38] don't have to work themselves into
[1:04:40] anything they just feed on the Green
[1:04:43] Green Grass of the word amen and produce
[1:04:48] the white white milk of the
[1:04:51] manifestation of the Life of Christ the
[1:04:53] Pure Life of Jesus Christ begins to flow
[1:04:56] through them and the world comes out of
[1:04:59] them amen because they it's their nature
[1:05:03] to do that to produce the world so it's
[1:05:06] nothing they have to think about I'm
[1:05:08] talking about our Christianity an
[1:05:10] original Christianity that is not one by
[1:05:14] theology
[1:05:16] not one by the wisdom of even religious
[1:05:20] men it is not one imposed or given to us
[1:05:24] by even the Giants that we find in the
[1:05:28] land that we are in but we are to rest
[1:05:32] on his unfailing grace Hallelujah and by
[1:05:36] that Grace amen we are able to have
[1:05:39] victory for his life in US gives us the
[1:05:42] victory here life in US gives us
[1:05:45] Holiness he life in US gives us
[1:05:48] Perfection his life in US produces the
[1:05:52] fruit on these branches we are he is
[1:05:55] divine but we are the branches to
[1:05:57] produce the fruit Hallelujah but he
[1:06:00] gives us the sap he gives us the
[1:06:02] quickening power to produce the fruit in
[1:06:04] our lives so it's not about us it's
[1:06:07] about him
[1:06:08] [Applause]
[1:06:10] Glory worthy honor power adoration to
[1:06:15] Jesus Christ Our Lord who has given this
[1:06:17] to us amen blessed be the name of the
[1:06:20] Lord hallelujah amen yes sir so she is
[1:06:26] obedient to the word
[1:06:29] not by legalism
[1:06:33] not just by our self
[1:06:37] saying oh I'm just gonna I'm just gonna
[1:06:40] do what the word says no even when she
[1:06:43] isn't thinking
[1:06:45] amen even when she's not thinking and
[1:06:49] she's just living
[1:06:50] she walks into Obedience of the word
[1:06:54] and if while doing that she makes a slip
[1:06:58] here a mistake there whatever she still
[1:07:01] keeps walking
[1:07:02] because she knows that the blood has
[1:07:05] already been shed to take care of all of
[1:07:07] that and all I have to come back and say
[1:07:10] Lord I know I shouldn't have done that
[1:07:11] I'm sorry Lord forgive me here forgive
[1:07:14] me there and then the blood already was
[1:07:16] always there his brother Branham said
[1:07:19] you asking me to pray for you for
[1:07:22] healing he says don't you understand
[1:07:24] your stripes were laid on him on the
[1:07:27] cross you're already healed
[1:07:29] hallelujah amen it's your face now in
[1:07:33] believing the word of God and God using
[1:07:36] me now to lift that Faith by pronouncing
[1:07:40] you heal but you're healed already
[1:07:43] he said even if I wanted to I can't heal
[1:07:45] you again because Jesus Christ done it
[1:07:48] all at the cross
[1:07:50] amen by his stripes we are healed we
[1:07:54] delivered we are saved praise God by the
[1:07:57] power of the Holy Spirit the presence of
[1:08:00] the Living God drives every devil away
[1:08:03] that can't stand in his word of the
[1:08:05] Living God amen hallelujah amen yes sir
[1:08:09] the Bible said she believes the word she
[1:08:13] has obedient to the word and now what
[1:08:15] does she do she gets to a place now

[1:08:28] the bride is in a state of waiting in

[1:08:34] hearing recognizing through the age
[1:08:36] through the time through the season in
[1:08:39] all his forms and all its lights and all
[1:08:42] its shapes yeah she's been seeing it
[1:08:44] she's been rejoicing in it and she's
[1:08:47] waiting for that word now to be
[1:08:51] conformed for that promise to come alive
[1:08:55] for this Bible to move and live and be
[1:09:00] convincible before us the promises that
[1:09:03] he gave in this word to live in our day
[1:09:06] not in Paul's day nothing brother
[1:09:09] branham's day it lived over there we've
[1:09:12] seen that praise God we're witnessing to
[1:09:14] it but let the spirit of God witness to
[1:09:17] his own word in our day and keep promise
[1:09:22] in this day and that's what she's
[1:09:24] waiting for
[1:09:25] that's what I am waiting for that's what
[1:09:28] every one of us should be waiting for
[1:09:31] praise be to God

[1:09:36] to bring it down
[1:09:37] praise the Lord all this is is here for
[1:09:41] is to open our understanding it's open
[1:09:45] our understanding so that we enter into
[1:09:48] a deeper state of rest just rest just
[1:09:52] relax God is working things out
[1:09:55] all right let me repeat it again I've
[1:09:58] said it over and over God is working
[1:10:01] things out
[1:10:04] there is no Tangles or no not in life
[1:10:08] that he can't undo God has the answer
[1:10:12] for every problem

[1:10:25] rest
[1:10:26] you're having that headache you take the
[1:10:29] the the the uh
[1:10:32] well I didn't want because I'm on the
[1:10:36] internet here to be advertising for a
[1:10:39] brand name that's why I pause
[1:10:46] yeah yeah that's why I pause because I
[1:10:49] could have said said a headache pillars
[1:10:52] that's why I pause to be able to adjust
[1:10:54] myself there right but when you take the
[1:10:58] pill you don't lay on the bed analyzing
[1:11:02] I wonder if this so soon so chemical is
[1:11:05] interacting properly with some chemical
[1:11:08] and before it all works in my body to
[1:11:11] contact me in this nerve and pass
[1:11:13] through this part before it gets to the
[1:11:16] place that's aching no you don't think
[1:11:19] about it once you're taking that word
[1:11:21] once you take it in you just rest
[1:11:25] and let it do its work let him do his
[1:11:29] work
[1:11:30] don't get in his way
[1:11:33] don't get in this way just let the Holy
[1:11:36] Spirit do his work
[1:11:38] and he's working
[1:11:40] I said he's working the spirit of God is
[1:11:43] at work right now the Living God is
[1:11:47] taking care of everything right now he
[1:11:50] said but I don't know if he's seen me or
[1:11:52] if he's not my problem or he's taking
[1:11:54] care of me listen God knows every single
[1:11:57] ant
[1:12:02] in other words you've seen him on the
[1:12:04] platform calling the people by their
[1:12:06] name and call their address where they
[1:12:08] live and and then he says oh oh they
[1:12:11] don't believe he says well then uh
[1:12:14] remember when you were just a child and
[1:12:17] you were under a tree and you were
[1:12:19] looking towards the east and when you
[1:12:22] were looking towards the east when you
[1:12:24] were a child you are thinking
[1:12:27] and this is what you were thinking and
[1:12:29] he tells them what they were thinking
[1:12:32] what that is is not to bring glory to
[1:12:35] himself for you to look at him but that
[1:12:38] was God trying to show you I am God I
[1:12:41] know everything
[1:12:45] I go every one I know every situation I
[1:12:48] know every problem
[1:12:50] amen praise the Lord cast your cares on
[1:12:53] me for I care for you
[1:12:57] Hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:13:00] Living God I want you to know that
[1:13:02] clearly friends because she is now the
[1:13:06] bride now who recognizes the word amen
[1:13:10] I'm not saying the bride that claims she
[1:13:12] is in the message not the bride that
[1:13:14] says I believe the message not the
[1:13:16] bright or the person that said I believe
[1:13:18] the prophet I believe this quote I
[1:13:21] believe that but they have caught the
[1:13:24] revelation of the unwritten word
[1:13:28] Hallelujah now you must understand that
[1:13:32] uh uh uh what What's his name uh between
[1:13:36] Cain and Abel
[1:13:39] we'll get to that in a in a little while
[1:13:41] a little while we'll touch on that a
[1:13:43] little while and let you see clearly
[1:13:45] that uh Cain can can definitely did not
[1:13:50] want to subject himself to Abel's
[1:13:54] revelation
[1:13:56] right
[1:13:57] and God says the Revelation Abel has and
[1:14:02] had was the word
[1:14:05] for God bore witness to it
[1:14:08] even though think back then there was
[1:14:13] not one word written
[1:14:16] but evil got a revelation what word was
[1:14:19] that he got a revelation of what word
[1:14:23] we're not talking just about the
[1:14:25] writings in the Bible which we respect
[1:14:27] we love and we ought to believe in but
[1:14:30] the Bible is only a representation of an
[1:14:33] unseen being
[1:14:35] right and this being revealed to Abel
[1:14:41] that it was not a fish
[1:14:43] it was not a horse or a goat
[1:14:47] but you must kill a lamb which rep down
[1:14:51] the blood of the Lamb my friends will
[1:14:54] represent that thing that will save you
[1:14:57] sacrifice a lamb and all that with all
[1:15:00] prophecy and type Point into the coming
[1:15:02] of Jesus Christ the Lamb of God that
[1:15:06] would be sacrificed now he's in the
[1:15:08] beginning of the Bible getting a
[1:15:09] revelation is what's going to run right
[1:15:11] through the Bible right to the end of
[1:15:14] the Bible and here he is doing it by
[1:15:17] what by revelation
[1:15:20] by faith we understand
[1:15:23] no man can please God without faith no
[1:15:27] man can please God
[1:15:29] without a revelation so the unwritten
[1:15:33] word
[1:15:34] it was not written bible
[1:15:36] there was no books no nothing written
[1:15:39] yet but yet Abel knew
[1:15:43] now I won't expand on that now but what
[1:15:47] that Revelation that Abel had is what
[1:15:50] Cain was fighting against
[1:15:53] he was fighting against that because
[1:15:55] Abel couldn't pick up uh look the
[1:15:58] prophet said it here
[1:15:59] Abel couldn't do that there was no
[1:16:01] writing he couldn't even go to show me
[1:16:04] it in the Bible show me it in the word
[1:16:06] he couldn't go even to the world because
[1:16:10] they didn't have nothing written there
[1:16:11] to point anybody too amen he could only
[1:16:15] say I know God spoke to me and this is
[1:16:18] what he said
[1:16:21] oh but you can go off that way and get
[1:16:23] the false Doctrine or something like
[1:16:25] that but if it's the right spirit
[1:16:28] the Holy Spirit he can't differ from the
[1:16:31] word
[1:16:32] it doesn't matter even if you didn't
[1:16:34] know that verse it's in that word if the
[1:16:37] holy spirit is revealing choose a word
[1:16:39] amen it can't therefore so it's easy
[1:16:43] then for the True Believer to step off
[1:16:46] the boat and start walking on the water
[1:16:48] because they have faith in him amen
[1:16:52] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[1:16:55] says she waits in love for his promised
[1:16:58] word of the age to be confirmed praise

[1:17:07] brother Branham use these words often to
[1:17:10] be Vindicated
[1:17:12] what we believe what we see in the word
[1:17:16] what we're trying to tell others and
[1:17:19] they may not be able to perceive or to
[1:17:21] understand because listen while I am
[1:17:23] talking like this you are talking like
[1:17:25] that Satan's got his agents peering
[1:17:28] peeping
[1:17:29] they're listening a word on word just
[1:17:33] like it is in the Bible they marked his
[1:17:36] mouth
[1:17:36] they go through everything he's saddened
[1:17:40] how he said it and everything else and
[1:17:42] and they were doing that brother Branham
[1:17:44] said to do what to find something that
[1:17:47] they could trip him up or or be able to
[1:17:50] tangle him up or to Blacken his name
[1:17:53] amen you see what they thought it was
[1:17:56] just him they didn't realize that they
[1:17:59] were fighting God Amen didn't realize
[1:18:02] that amen praise God hallelujah but
[1:18:06] she's watching she is waiting and listen
[1:18:09] what it says she is waiting in love for
[1:18:13] the promise of the age to be confirmed
[1:18:17] to be Vindicated
[1:18:19] she is not only wearing she is watching
[1:18:23] for it
[1:18:24] so just waiting and she is watching oh

[1:18:54] saying there she knows that she is a
[1:18:56] part of the word before she didn't know
[1:18:59] but now she knows she's part of that
[1:19:01] word
[1:19:01] she is part of that word that was before
[1:19:05] this Bible was ever written
[1:19:07] she was part of that Unwritten word that
[1:19:12] was with him and in him before the
[1:19:18] foundation of the world
[1:19:20] she was there with him and she
[1:19:24] recognizes that now Hallelujah not just

[1:19:34] into that Dimension places you into that
[1:19:37] place amen she knows she was with him in
[1:19:40] eternity

[1:19:52] of the word

[1:21:17] understand what was happening all down
[1:21:21] time until this hour and what she has to
[1:21:24] do and what is to fulfill in this age
[1:21:27] and in this hour amen as that word
[1:21:32] unfolds unveils itself piece by piece to
[1:21:36] her she's waiting in the middle of that

[1:21:43] of God was unveiled and and you got it
[1:21:46] no it continues like a Roman Candle to
[1:21:50] unfold and unfold and it keeps on

[1:22:39] amen because this bright body is waiting
[1:22:42] for his life now quickly to uh reiterate
[1:22:46] or to mention this again that we are in
[1:22:49] a condition like the first Adam was
[1:22:54] but now Through the Ages this was the
[1:22:56] building of the physical body of the
[1:22:59] second Adam
[1:23:01] that one lay on the physical Earth back
[1:23:05] then but now this is the new creation
[1:23:10] so we are Parts on pieces of that body
[1:23:13] of Christ who is the second Adam
[1:23:17] and the second Adam is on the earth now
[1:23:20] do you believe that
[1:23:22] amen praise God the second Adam is on
[1:23:26] the earth now but when God created Adam
[1:23:30] and had him on the earth there he did

[1:23:37] am God breathes the breath of life and

[1:23:57] confirm her position of who she is and

[1:24:29] perfect
[1:24:30] life of Jesus Christ
[1:24:34] I'm not saying you going out and trying
[1:24:36] to work yourself into that but I say
[1:24:39] saying uh God is his own interpreter
[1:24:45] who is going to interpret his life to
[1:24:48] this generation
[1:24:50] he did not intend that he's going to
[1:24:52] come back like he walked on the shores
[1:24:54] of Galilee and walked down the streets
[1:24:57] of New York
[1:24:58] and people would say oh there's Jesus oh
[1:25:00] that's how sweet he is that's how that's
[1:25:03] the picture they draw you of how sweet
[1:25:05] Jesus was he can't even point a straight
[1:25:08] finger his finger always has to be
[1:25:09] drooping or chocolaty and you know no no
[1:25:13] no no no no no he wasn't like that one
[1:25:15] minute he can be pick up the children
[1:25:18] with love in his arms and in the next
[1:25:20] minute he turned around and say castle
[1:25:23] out of Darkness weeping and wailing and
[1:25:26] gnashing of teeth right amen so he was
[1:25:29] brought a lamb and a lion right
[1:25:33] so we see here praise God
[1:25:36] so when he he himself now comes to the
[1:25:43] his physical body on the earth at this
[1:25:46] age and in this stage
[1:25:49] he begins to live his own life
[1:25:53] through heart
[1:25:55] and they don't have to try and interpret
[1:25:59] the word for our two other people
[1:26:03] that's not what they have to do they
[1:26:05] just are resting
[1:26:07] and letting him interpret his own word
[1:26:12] interpret his own life manifest his own
[1:26:16] presence because his glib on everybody
[1:26:18] oh I'm born again oh I'm a Christian oh

[1:26:33] right the bride is resting and waiting
[1:26:36] for her faith to be confirmed to be
[1:26:40] Vindicated problem that is just saith
[1:26:43] the Lord she for her she knows it's
[1:26:48] right she don't have to have it proven
[1:26:51] for her to know she already knows but
[1:26:54] for all the onlookers and wondering

[1:27:05] is it they got a hold of what is this
[1:27:08] what's taking place amen God is going
[1:27:12] it's going to interpret his own life
[1:27:16] true of her praise God and let them deal
[1:27:19] with that
[1:27:20] amen do you believe that
[1:27:23] praise the name of the Lord praise the
[1:27:25] Lord let's read Colossians 3 from verse
[1:27:29] 4 and see what it says when Christ

[1:27:47] Christ who is our life shall appear
[1:27:50] then shall we also appear with him in
[1:27:55] glory
[1:27:56] because if he's in you they're going to
[1:27:58] see you and they're going to see him all
[1:28:00] at the same time you know they see Jesus

[1:28:15] are upon the Earth

[1:28:40] come up on the children of disobedience
[1:28:45] amen praise the name of the Lord he
[1:28:48] knows that those are the things that
[1:28:51] Satan will use the five senses of the
[1:28:54] body
[1:28:55] to manipulate and cause human beings to
[1:28:59] fall into
[1:29:01] so Paul is saying mortified
[1:29:04] the members of your body
[1:29:08] and allow the Holy Spirit to bring them
[1:29:11] under control of his word amen praise
[1:29:16] the name of the Lord now I want you to
[1:29:19] realize that I'm talking about the bride
[1:29:23] waiting in love for uh the word to
[1:29:28] confirm the word and when you think
[1:29:30] about this we can name some names in the
[1:29:32] Bible quickly and then I'll go to the
[1:29:35] last stage of this here uh there was
[1:29:38] Rebecca
[1:29:40] while she was journeying with the the
[1:29:45] messenger
[1:29:46] to get to Isaac
[1:29:49] she was waiting
[1:29:52] while traveling she was waiting and
[1:29:55] waiting in love
[1:29:57] that what she had believed from being
[1:30:00] told
[1:30:04] by elieza she was waiting for that to be
[1:30:08] confirmed
[1:30:09] and when she saw him that confirmed it
[1:30:12] oh my praise God hallelujah and what
[1:30:17] what about Ruth

[1:30:34] his servants
[1:30:35] uh and just loved him you know the rest
[1:30:40] of the story
[1:30:42] and then how he told her that he is
[1:30:46] going to seek to redeem her and this
[1:30:50] type of thing and she kept working she
[1:30:53] didn't stop working she's kept working
[1:30:55] in the field but she was working and she
[1:30:59] was waiting and she was watching for the
[1:31:03] promise that he made to her to be
[1:31:06] confirmed
[1:31:07] to be met manifest and Vindicated before
[1:31:11] all the people what he told her
[1:31:14] privately was not going to go out

[1:31:19] display of this bride everybody was
[1:31:21] going to recognize she is the one
[1:31:24] amen she she was saying she's the one
[1:31:27] but now we know she is the one not
[1:31:30] because she said so but God is proving
[1:31:33] it so that she is the one praise the
[1:31:36] name of the Lord we can see it also
[1:31:39] figured out there in job we can see it
[1:31:43] in Mary
[1:31:45] and also we can see it now in the select
[1:31:49] bride
[1:31:51] praise the Lord but before I
[1:31:54] finish this sermon it wouldn't be
[1:31:57] finished unless I touched on what he was
[1:32:00] really talking about what I am talking
[1:32:03] about what brother Brandon was talking
[1:32:05] about when he told a simple beautiful
[1:32:08] story
[1:32:09] of that little
[1:32:12] young lady waiting in love for the

[1:33:05] daughter so that daughter was staying
[1:33:08] with them instead of them caring for her
[1:33:11] loving her they put her to be like the

[1:39:58] scene there
[1:40:00] what he saw was so disheartening and
[1:40:04] what Jesus looks upon in this modern
[1:40:06] world with all these denominations and
[1:40:09] churches and remember denomination
[1:40:11] doesn't have to be what we call a
[1:40:13] denomination it can even be somebody a a
[1:40:17] group that claims to believe this
[1:40:19] message and may even have a message name
[1:40:21] on it but the structure the system the
[1:40:25] workings of if the control of it the
[1:40:27] direction of it amen could be completely
[1:40:31] denominational right so he's talking
[1:40:34] about that completely in that way
[1:40:37] hallelujah amen so he was disheartened
[1:40:40] amen but watch now oh my this boy was
[1:40:46] watching and he went out to look for
[1:40:49] them Hallelujah he was looking for
[1:40:51] something different and then of course
[1:40:53] he saw this girl which is what I'm
[1:40:54] getting back to I don't want to go
[1:40:57] through the entire
[1:40:59] um story you can look it up you can go
[1:41:03] through it and hear everything that he
[1:41:05] said hallelujah amen hallelujah no he
[1:41:10] met her
[1:41:11] and when he met her
[1:41:14] throwing out dishwater
[1:41:16] right
[1:41:18] remember it's not dishwater for herself
[1:41:22] love covers a multitude of sins so she's
[1:41:25] throwing out the dishwater but it's for
[1:41:27] the rest of them
[1:41:28] right so she's throwing out the
[1:41:30] dishwater and he spoke with her a while
[1:41:33] and
[1:41:35] um he asked her are you willing to make
[1:41:38] yourself ready
[1:41:39] uh uh to to go with me uh will you wait
[1:41:44] for me to come back because he I will I

[1:42:30] different day when he comes here on the
[1:42:35] scene praise God I want you to

[1:43:51] type of the bride of Christ today she
[1:43:54] got her garments ready Hallelujah now
[1:43:58] you see she began to display a little
[1:44:01] bit of that wedding garment and instead
[1:44:04] of the questions understanding they said
[1:44:08] why you silly child
[1:44:11] you mean to think that a man like that
[1:44:14] would do anything like that for you

[1:45:04] struggling but that is all of the whole
[1:45:07] uh of the whole uh journey and parcel of
[1:45:11] God that you might prepare and be ready
[1:45:16] with the wedding dress when he comes
[1:45:20] Hallelujah the trial of your face worked
[1:45:24] at patience amen glory to God see now he
[1:45:28] said I told you they said I told you
[1:45:31] that you was wrong he ain't coming
