but we'll bring you the word amen praise the lord a gracious father once again we draw near we are here to worship you we are here to declare your word to the hearts of your people father oh god like the musical scale like the tuning forks may the spirit take the word and apply it to our hearts lord i may be able to strike something deep within that will reverberate throughout eternity lord we commit ourselves to thee now for service reception and for delivery that you might receive all praise honor and glory in the name of jesus christ amen praise the lord we have one text one scripture which will be genesis chapter 1 verse sorry genesis 3 15. and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shall bruise his heel praise the lord god bless you please be seated well our last wednesday uh we ended the talk by speaking of the seeds that were in the pharaohs tomb from since the time of joseph they were in that tomb and all they were actually waiting on was the right kind of water the right kind of moisture to be able to strike that seed that it could come alive likewise multitudes who are elected or predestinated by god they might have been in all kinds of churches even groups in the message they've been in all kinds of societies and different things and always there's a longing there's a reaching inside there's a something missing there until the holy spirit takes the word of god and applies the word and it wakes up the seed that was buried in them by the great planter the great sore who told his own story when he said a man went forth to seoul and he sold seeds you know the story even god was speaking of himself so that you might catch it and understand what is happening so seeds of life better known we may use the word genes we may use attributes in him were all these things praise god and so he took those seeds and those seeds were in his elected children but as you know we have seven church ages and so many uh are elected to each age so many are in every age not a standard amount we don't know the amounts we don't know but god knows who they are but in every age he has children with the life of god in him because that was part of his plan to be able to push back against satan's uh satan's what should i say running ahead of god and preempting his plan his purpose that he wanted to carry out and so water came on those seeds and those seeds came to life it doesn't matter how long those seeds were sitting there they may look dead they may even go into a traditional church and act dead they know nothing else the seed of god lays there waiting on what the water of the holy spirit to come and wake up that seed the deep calls to the deep and the deep will respond praise god hallelujah amen at the same time let me make this point the word of god led through the ages centuries and they did everything they could to to say that god is dead the world is dead that's just literature it's poetry it's beautiful history and everything else but he sent a prophet to water the word for this age to prove to them that the lord is alive and that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah praise god he says you know the water comes because the a real predestinated seed of god is an absorbent for the holy spirit amen in other words like a sponge oh my to take in the holy ghost praise the name of the lord hallelujah think about it because when the holy spirit comes unto that or into that germ of life that's laying there it produces another seed just exactly like another son of god is born you see they don't know it but it's an amateur god that person is a son of god a daughter of god an immature god why the spirit of god woke up the seed and the seed is what part of the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word become you or me the word become flesh why because the wa it still remains the word after it remains a wheat seed after 3 000 years and when they water it it comes out with a wheat seed and it is the prophet is trying to say here in the same way never mind you were unconscious you didn't know you had no idea whatsoever that seed just laying there waiting waiting waiting waiting amen until the holy spirit comes and wakes it up as he says in the church book if the seed be planted then the water will raise it up again amen praise god hallelujah so in the same way you as an individual elected seed were waiting laying there until the spirit comes in the same way the entire word of god that they tried to say is dead and everything else and that times of change we're living in a modern day and you're still saying women shouldn't dress this way and they shouldn't dress that way and and christians should be this way and baptism is this way and that way we're in a modern age and times have changed but they didn't realize the seed never changed even the natural one from joseph time never changed it remains the same seed let the water strike it it will act like the original seed and the same way when the holy spirit comes on the true believer it will cause the seed life in them to act like the original seed hallelujah the son of man the seed of god jesus christ these seed we are acid part of the word signified by the purifier breaking up on their pentecost we are part of the word that's why the scripture says in him was the fullness of the godhead bodily amen we were all in him praise god hallelujah i thank god for that listen he says don't you know oh my i am branham because i was born of ella and charles branham and that makes me a branham praise god hallelujah he is saying charles and ella branham produced him and automatically he's a branham he doesn't have to do anything to prove he's a brother he doesn't have to go to work to be a brand now he doesn't have to go and attend bible school to know he's a brother he doesn't have to go to any converts class for six weeks before you get baptized to know that he is abraham no sir the moment he was born from that mother and father he was abraham amen praise the name of the lord and i'm so happy about that that when the holy spirit reigns down on the seed life that is in us we recognize because that's what real salvation is is your eyes open and you recognize who you are where you come from who your father is amen and your journey of life and where you are going praise the lord hallelujah amen glory to god amen let me tell you if you plant a son of man seed what else can it produce but sons and daughters of men sons and daughters of god it can't produce because every seed has to bring forth after its kind hallelujah and he planted themselves in the ground and even tell you beforehand that i'm going down to the one seed goes down on the ground but when it comes up it's coming up multiplied it's coming up there producing a crop amen oh my and that the son of man produces and has produced sons of man hallelujah and collectively when you put all of them together they are the son of man for this day back then it was jesus was the son of man for that day hallelujah the head of the body or the husband to the bride but now here comes the bride amen anointed with the same holy spirit praise god and she becomes the what the manifestation of the son of man him operating and manifesting through her praise the name of the living god amen lord of god amen listen when the holy ghost rain falls on the elected seed of god he says what does it produce you see when that seed the spirit of god's spirit waters that seed of god then which is the word of god that it can't produce nothing else but god is that right hallelujah and you see from that time it's not the individual no more it's god hallelujah doesn't mean that all of a sudden we we lose our minds we don't know who we are where we come from and and god's spirit take us over brother brown said god's spirit doesn't work like that person know exactly what they're doing make their own choices and everything else satan is the one that plays on the people's mind get them insane then he can use them even more but god doesn't work like that you see he moves in his children see see because now it's god individual in the individual because what you are dead you are really not yourself anymore you because you by fact reckon yourself there and hollowed out the seed of life comes to life and it isn't you no more it isn't even that man no more it's god now in that man or woman hallelujah in other words your pee your friends your family around you you're not going to see not no physical change it's the same one right but the man inside like paul said he's changing daily amen he's changing daily while he says while this outside man they're looking at is wasting away and and getting old and it's dying he says the inner man is alive and living come why is walking towards eternal life praise god hallelujah that's where he's headed he's walking towards eternal life praise god hallelujah see it isn't you anymore it isn't the man that woman it's god now in them it's the seed germ like the beginning spoken word god's word now made manifest in men is that what's happening now you see how simple and humble god does these things the brother branham said the greatest things are happening right in front of the people and they can't see it because they're not allowed to see it they're not allowed to see it just like israel was blinded they they can't see it but it's right in front of them praise god hallelujah oh my praise god i tell you friends it's the word of god that watered by the holy spirit it will produce the same thing it was amen can't produce anything else i'm talking about predestinated children of god predestinated children of god hallelujah now god spoke to eve from the very beginning and told her to multiply and replenish the earth satan heard that when he heard that he jumped ahead to copy what god was doing and to corrupt god's plan so eve under the spirit of uh seduction deception and uh lies you know she multiplied but she multiplied in for the mortal realm flesh realm is where she did the multiplication god had in his mind his multiplication would have been through the spoken word amen but she did the the devil i should say uh diverted and perverted it uh in other words to imprison or to capture all them seeds and trap them into flesh and then they will find no way out of it because they were would be in his prison right you know all the messages about souls in prison now and so on like that but that's what happened we all sitting here in bars of bone and even though you're born again even though you're saved don't tell me you're not going to feel any aches or pains brother but a bill don't tell me that if you hit your foot against a rock you're not gonna feel anything you're gonna have it amen but god even turned that around for his glory because then uh he let the world see how how a christian bears suffering trial problem sickness pain uh whatever evil failure uh success what he is letting the world see all those things through us and our weaknesses become his strengths because he can make himself manifest and reveal through that amen glory be to god hallelujah amen so you see god did not get the use of eve's womb to produce what he wanted we know abel was there but he did not get uh to produce what he wanted because remember in another place brother branham said you know if eve had obeyed the word and believed the word she would have produced that christ the messiah right back from the beginning there and we would not have to go through all of this amen praise god but because she didn't do it god already recognized he has to have that seed son of man seed to come up somewhere in the human history and therefore we understand carefully here that the great devil of god the holy spirit had to go searching to find a believing virgin amen praise god today he is searching for virgin hearts amen that would receive the word of god for this day and for this hour praise god listen it's the same thing that she uh um i mean mary got back there the spirit searched until it found that child amen to anoint and use her for his glory and the same spirit of the living god sent a prophet in this age amen and he stood before not mary back there but before a bride here today and spoke the word of god thus saith the lord there'll be a pride there'll be a rapture they all praise god they'll be sons and daughters of god and here they come praise god because the word attract their attention and brought them to attention of who they really are amen so the word of god in this last day has come to a virgin bride he has come to her and she has received the word of the living god amen do you remember he says here john 5 19 how i do nothing till the father shows me what was he you see right there sure that though he was god meg made himself a man right praise god god made flesh dwelling among us the word was made flesh and dwelt among us god spoken word through a virgin was made flesh and dwelt among us and it brought forth a body amen and then dwelt in him praise god and there the life of god was manifesting through christ for god was in christ the anointed one you know christ means the anointed one or the anointed word amen and god was living in that praise god hallelujah amen and now we understand why the scripture says his name shall be called what emmanuel which is god with us but now we say emmanuel god in us praise god god in us making himself manifested to the world oh praise god how beautiful this is praise god now here we are brother sister like uh i think i've mentioned it before and was mentioned how that we really living in two worlds amen praise god we're living in two worlds praise god human producing flesh and then the word seed laying on the inside and there we are living in two realms you're in the earth here in the world you've seen everything that's going on all the temptations you're facing but at the same time there's a soul in there that is in contact with its maker hallelujah praise god amen and it's not worrying with all these distractions it's it's pressing on it's it's just pressing on its way because it's going back to glory hallelujah amen you see what is it now the germ with the flesh is now the anointed flesh anointed with the spirit of god producing the word of god may manifest praise god hallelujah amen yes sir oh be filled with his word believe his word then the holy spirit comes to water that word makes that word grow and god manifesting himself through that continues hallelujah you see i'm going ahead a little here but brother branham said he died to pay the debt for high breathing right high breathing he died to pay that debt hallelujah because you know that that was the cause of all sin all it's high breathing and what was the high breathing not a serpent with eve that's high breathing right there satan is the initiator of all hybriding he's the one that created that and so there he is the first uh opportunity and the first instance of our breathing is the serpent and eve right there it goes praise the lord all my diverting god's original plans praise god because god's real plan was to have sons and daughters like himself praise god but satan did something else believing he's going to trick god and as long as he gets some sons hybrid hybrid sons that they can act like like god's children and god no doubt will you know after a while say well it's not my child but i still like him he's a good behave boy a girl a moral man upright man an upright woman look at the good she does look how she feeds the poor but it doesn't matter i know god wouldn't think like that because it doesn't matter what you do when the blood of a father is in a child it doesn't matter how the father behave or the child behave the child is still not that man's a child no matter what it's there all the time that doesn't change hallelujah so that person can be holy on the outside of making themselves look like a christian but they go back to their father the devil and his works you will do amen you see oh my praise god hallelujah let me tell you brother sister listen now remember the work of his first son his only begotten son he died for our hybriding life see that he might reconcile us back to be sons and daughters of god right how did he do it amen how did he do it he was the word making itself manifested hallelujah and he gave his life that he might send back the spirit to water the seeds amen that was there in the earth praise god hallelujah lord of god he that believeth in me the words that i do praise god hallelujah oh my now somebody says why do you throw it upon the bible friends he said it's simply this the bible has got to be in you for the word is a seed i don't mean that you're going to take and eat this bible because you read in revelation when he says eat the book this is this is not what he's telling you to eat but the revelation that's in here god is telling you to eat that eat the book eat the word as far as that goes but what he's saying there and as long as this is laying in there it won't do nothing but when the holy spirit the water comes on that then it begins to do something amen praise god in other words you come an elected seed and you come with the bible and you're ready not not the book the bible but you come with the unwritten word inside of you and you don't know how you know how to act or what to do just like brother branham didn't know how he knows that person's name but god knows the person's name from beyond the foundation of the world already predestinate him to be a prophet so all he got to do is be a mouthpiece it's not as easy as i'm saying it because he told one brother that he said it takes faith to do it never mind you have a gift the gift doesn't mean you just like that you know god doesn't just work and move the person they gotta act by faith too right so he says you don't want anything like this because it's all faith but but the fact is the name is known to god hallelujah it's easiest thing for him to tell him and then he just repeat what he god just told him and it's got to be it will be right every time because you know it's not me it's not said the lord glory to god hallelujah think of it so when the bible is laying in there when it comes into the heart then it begins to manifest by the holy ghost the works of god that's when visions begin to come power begins to come humility comes all of your knowledge begins to go out and you begin to become nothing christ becomes alive because you die and he lives you let go and he has his way because he died i live when i die what happens he lives again praise god when we die he lives again that gives him god the chance now to manifest or express himself through the individual the believing individual praise the lord hallelujah amen oh praise god and when i die he promised me life i died out to myself that i can have his life i'm taking his word now praise god and by that by faith believing it it produces exactly what the bible said it would produce hallelujah praise god i'm just going to go over quick something here he's just said in passing which anybody can expand on that if they can think oh my brethren we find now a lot of imitations is that right imitations of christ you know that famous book written by some great writer the imitations of christ the catholic loves it but that is what's actually going on imitations of christ trying to make themselves look like a christian act like a christian talk like a christian on that way praise god but the true word heavens and earth will pass away my words will not pass away that's the written word that's the living word the same word but it's not going to pass away because it's eternal to begin with praise god hallelujah that's why oh my i come out of that years ago when we used to be so uh you know really strong comforting to your heart to know i got born again on november the 21st 1955 or whatever you got the date you know the time and everything else like until the holy spirit starts speaking and saying like speaking he spoke to others but he's speaking to me saying does anybody know when they're born do not know the date the other day the mother the father got to tell them but when they were born they didn't know and you don't need to do that but it's your actions your character your motivations everything is going to begin to tell you you're changed you're not the same man or woman you used to be your taste is different everything's changed you've been transformed by god's power amen hallelujah so we got that heaven earth will pass away but my word will not pass away hallelujah because they are as predestinated as he was amen praise god hallelujah he's saying jesus christ was predestinated to be the messiah to be the savior that was what he was purpose of coming here to do you know a lot of his prayers saying father i fulfilled you know the mission you gave me that to die i did this i i've declared your name he came with a mission he was predestinated and he says here he says now we know that word seed was flesh word seed flesh now we see predestinated sons and daughters of god they are also predestinated you believe that amen praise god hallelujah ephesians 1 5 verse 5 amen original seed predestinated because we were predestinated in gods for knowledge in other words satan threw the whole thing off track but before he even threw it off track god already knew he was going to throw it off track and god had a contingency plan is that right so god had a contingency plan so god just put it into motion that's why we read the scripture of genesis 3 15. immediately after she sinned god tells tells her how that the seed you're right you're telling the serpent your your seed is going to bruise his head but he's going to bruise your eel amen and so so god had a plan that now the woman seed is the emphasis i wanted to bring because the woman has no seed that was already showing he was going to send that word seed now to untrue a woman right because sin came by and true a woman he's going to correct the whole thing by sending the word seed now in and through a woman bringing back life to the world hallelujah praise god that's what he's saying here amen see that original seed christ is that original seed you believe it now think the original seed was predestinated by gods for knowledge but i just told you god already foreign and knew what the devil was gonna do and everything else and had a contingency plan all right and god knowing that the fall would come here it is knowing that the fall would come and predestinated him to take our place amen you get it so all sons and daughters of god are predestined you can't be a genuine son or daughter of god unless you were pre-destinated by god hallelujah not forced to do something on the earth but god knew you in his mind and he knew everything you were going to do and everything you were going to be god knew all about that praise god amen so he knows us by name even before we come down here right we know that because he told jeremiah he said before you even was in your mother's stomach i i know you i i know you uh i know you i even know you're calling i know what you're supposed to do when you come down here you're to be a prophet you you're to do this god knew every one of us hallelujah praise god amen oh praise god you see you must not realize that god knew them seeds would be here and you are here on free moral agency he for you everything that we would be and he even knowed who you were and who you was amen praise god so god knows all his genes just like that mother eagle knew all her children where every egg was everything he knows exactly where they are now think on this he says he did not make eve do that what she did that is not the kind of predestination we're not talking about that god don't force didn't force her to do nothing right he but he know that she would have done that and because he knew what the devil would have done what she would have done and everything else he already had his plan for the lamb was slain already before the foundation of the world so god already had his plan the land was slain before all of this stuff actually took place down here the lamb was slain for our sins praise god hallelujah oh how wonderful to know that amen my god no wonder he says here they got eyes but they don't see they got ears but they don't hear amen that's why jesus himself said you are hypocrites you are good imitations of christ i'm saying that now your your good limitations of christ you you got so you good imitation you look so holy so christ-like so pious and everything else and you you're repellent brother bran says here repellent to the true word of god oh my yes that's the way it is you're refusing the word of god hallelujah but how does predestinated come you see god had commissioned adam and eve to multiply and replenish the earth amen and we see satan use that that is how sex was given but and that caused a high breathing amen my but now god already foresaw and predestinated a world of son and daughters to come hallelujah amen he predestinated them to be here and because of my breathing disbelieving god's word which caused that high breeding god put that right back on track again hallelujah you don't have to be a hybrid or think you're a hybrid amen praise god you can come to the original word and manifest that you are a child of the living god hallelujah right back to the word and where you're supposed to be in the beginning hallelujah my that's where we were supposed to be and you will automatically act and move like the son and daughter of god hallelujah now he says have you ever heard of anything like a strain being in a family a certain strain being in the family have you ever heard of that a son or a daughter or ever will have traits of a grandmother a grandfather or a great-great-grandfather he'll have uh he'll have that we see like that some kind of a family identifying traits that in that family that they don't have to they don't have to be taught that they don't have to be trained to have that nature that family nature these families that they they're quiet and there are other families that are they talk and they move families with long fingers like artists and other ones different ways every family has its own strain and you can't escape from it the the children of that family don't have to be given a bible school education to act like abraham or act like this one or act like a jones or a smith or whatever they're just born in that family and they automatically act like that family and you pure predestinated sons and daughters of god from the original family of god when the spirit of god comes to you you'll act like a son or daughter of god because the spirit will make you do it amen oh praise god no matter what you do you can't hide your family disposition is that right you can help to hide that you see he repeats it he said remember that there's always a strain in a family now he really is talking about the family of god here but it's left for you to read between the lines and pick that up and understand that god's family is automatically going to have certain actions you're not going to be you are not going to be jesus christ but there's going to be some similarity and some little thing that you do or say that will be like him certain situations come up when the normal thing in the world is to act like the world you don't even know why you said it why you did it this way why you acted that way because you got the family's traits in you and there's something and you're moving you to do that and it's not something that you have to think about it just flows out from you praise god hallelujah oh is that wonderful amen you come with the family seed inside of you the strain of god's life already inside of us hallelujah so we what i'm hitting at here we don't have to strain and struggle to live a real christian life my yoke is easy and my burden is light you use the word burden but you say it's light praise the lord you're gonna know that you're getting tests and trials but it's going to be light why because god's life is in you straightening you moving you so we don't have to strain or struggle hallelujah amen i go to go to uh bible school and learn how to be a leblanc is that right uh go over to this higher bible school they're going to do a better job in training me how to act like a christian how to be an apostle how to be a missionary they they got all their books and their training classes to train them and that's satan using systems in the mental realm right he's using them to act and when they act by systems they become predictable because the devil knew exactly because he taught you the system he knew exactly what the next move you're going to make but john 3 says true sons of god oh they're like the wind true sons of god they're moved by the spirit of god the wind lord where listed and no man knows where it goes where is coming from where it's going hallelujah because it's moving by the spirit of the living god praise god amen oh praise god i'm going to just wind this up here now amen says brother branham if that is so then why what's the use of us preaching predestination what's the use of us preaching he says yes preaching i've got to preach you've got to preach because there's a crop out there and we don't know who is in that crop is that right amen so the only thing i am doing here now is saying you know what a saying is it it's a net is throwing out the net and then he's gonna sort the fish like jesus said uh what is in the fish so you can preach the word and this church full up and people are bursting at the seams standing outside and as you get deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper in the world all the snakes all the crabs all this all of that they start crawling off because what they can't take the fullness of that word they can't just take the fullness of that word see that's the way it is amen praise god so i'm saying here now see going through all this grease and muck and you see my goodness but if there's even one out there one that can absorb this it will turn out to be that that would be a son or a daughter of god and it's predestinated amen and that's the reason why god could work through jesus for he was pre-death the predestinated son hallelujah praise god you know the messages of preach on prepared ground and how god to manifest in a certain age prepared certain persons elected to be in that age so when he comes their bodies waiting for him to use so jesus was predestinated to be the savior and redeemer and now we understand that in our day he produced he prophesied there would be a bride that will go in a rapture and he has predestinated a set of people to be in that bride and to be in that rapture and i believe i'm a part of it i believe you're a part of it i believe together we are a part of it there is nobody else but us that are here believe in the word of god and we're not hanging on we're believing we're holding to god's unchanging hand praise god we're not just like some kitten or cat that's hanging by one fingernail and uh i believe i'm gonna make it i i hope i make it oh jesus help me oh jesus help me no not like that we're standing on a solid rock revelation of the word of the living god amen praise god amen hallelujah remember he says before the foundation before even eden he jesus was already predestinated to his position predestinated to his purpose predestinated hallelujah for his purpose in this life praise god hallelujah amen don't you understand he's talking about the other sons but he's talking this son because we were all in him so when he talks about jesus he's actually talking also about all the other sons and daughters that were in him praise god that he already you predestinated with your position you're pus you're already predestinated with your purpose in this life so you don't have to go around uh worrying about lord what is my purpose what is my position am i supposed to be this or that no when you come here you're born you're put on the earth the word calls you you come into the message you come into the the word of god it automatically moves you into your position listen i thought i would have been an apostle and god only wants me to be a believer to support the ministry or god want me to be a wife or god wants me to be a husband or god wants me to be this or that whatever it's that simple is that right praise the lord he said anything god wants you to be you are going to be that and you're going to know it well you don't have to go off and decide you decide now i want to be a doctor of divinity i'll have to go to saint john's college you see that's where they're off and they don't realize it because it's too high and mighty sounding right but god wants you to come down and to make the low places high and the high places low god bless you all praise the lord i trust as predestinated sons and daughters of god you see your position and you receive the fullness of the word amen god bless you god bless every one of you i heard from sister farida and brother christopher that our sister had two operations today on the brain and she is now in the recovery state where you know that state where the doctors really can't do anything anymore they themselves have to wait as they say now they have to wait on nature they did the best they could and now they're waiting on nature but we say they're waiting on god they're waiting on healing and we already prayed and pronounced that healing so we are waiting and trusting god for the manifestation of that for the glory of god is that right amen god bless every one of you here tonight amen [Applause] [Music] john saw the bride who was prepared [Music] you're part of that bride
