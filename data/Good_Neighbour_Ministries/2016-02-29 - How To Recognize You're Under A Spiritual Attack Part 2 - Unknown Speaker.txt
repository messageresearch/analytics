the Lord Delight in my position Delight to serve pray and believe and Minister the word of God it should be my honor right to do that not my obligation it should be out of the love of my heart what he did for me nobody can do the things that he's done for me in my life and if you know that in your heart you know it's the truth Jesus Christ is the greatest every ever to me my life amen Nobody Loves

is going to try to convince me to do the things of the flesh that's where I got to fight that's where I got to bring it subject to the word of God that's where I got to control it right he's given me the power he's given me the Revelation to control it amen he's giving me the Revelation to bring this Flesh on your subjection to the word of God bring every thought captive to the word of God Amen

the simple people that you make things simple when I'm under attack and I need I need something from God not looking amen I need somebody this is sometimes the simple people that Hallelujah that come forth amen amen and you walk out of there I said oh God thank you for that Faith amen amen hallelujah extreme three frustrations J and the spiritual attack amen varies of circumstances oppress the Mind great frustration comes in amen a person who is under surge finds himself on the edge of anxiousness oh God isn't that a big one amen isn't that a big attack that's why they all come every attack of the enemy comes circumstances come oh it's because you know uh the economy went this way and or this happened that way and this person decid to do it that way this way no I'm sorry it's all designed you know that this world there's nothing going on that has a greater purpose in this world but the maturing amen the perfecting of the Bride of Jesus Christ can you understand that you understand what I just said everything evolves around you and me this morning the economy everything all the prophecies that are being fulfilled out there evolve around me and you our Perfection amen our our Perfection of our faith our rapturing faith our perfect Faith coming into that everything evolves around us coming into that our positions in Christ amen not it doesn't mean anything else no brother it means this no it doesn't mean anything else I'm just going to leave it right there you chew on it you put some sauce on it you tenderize it whatever you have to do but that's the truth we need to recognize and realize these things thank you brother Hallelujah confusion about purpose oh God when an attack comes how that throws off remember everything we said from the beginning of the service here how that throws everything out of out of order confusion about our purpose during a spiritual attack is often great confusion about spiritual Direction you know wait upon the Lord he will speak to you he will make it plain and until then just wait don't allow the devil to come in and and give you this direction that dire you know the voice of God you know when he speaks to you when a revelation strikes you you know everything is clear everything falls into place everything works out just perfectly in all order amen that's when God speaks and until then just wait don't allow the devil to confuse your mind make your mind double-minded and then confuse you by your position amen and the Order of the spirit of God in your life just wait upon the Lord trust in him he gave you this step he'll give you that step he'll give you this step he'll lead you right up he promis that faith is a great thing Saints faith in this is great because people don't see this show me this Rapture show me this perfect Faith show me this this this Jesus that was resurrected in our day show me this I can't it's got to be revealed to you but I believe all this amen I believe all this you know I got to get to a place you got to get to a place place in your walk whether it happens or not that you'll die for this I wonder like the church in Africa there believe is Africa forgive me if I'm wrong that uh it got under attack 50 people stood out of thousands of the 50 people stood and were willing to give their lives for this message this word are you ready you're not going to be ready you're not going to be at that position I don't care how many times you attend church I don't care how many years you've been coming to this ministry you're not going to be ready if you're not in this amen if you're not fighting you're not overcoming amen hallelujah what an hour what an hour feeling overwhelmed in helplessness you are over you are feeling overwhelmed by circumstances this could be a sign that you're under attack the worst circumstance comes from two words cir in circle stand stance stand in circle stand in other words you are standing in circle by what's going on think about it it doesn't take long for you feeling being overwhelmed and led into hopelessness the Bible says hope the first makes the heart sick Proverbs 13:12 it also tells us Fai faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence things of things not Hebrews 11:1 if the enemy can get you to lose hope think about it he can get you to stop living by faith that's right put the two scriptures together and you see hope my hope is in the Lord number six lack of peace the enemy bombards us the mind with various thoughts and ongoing Temptations in order to Rob our Rob our peace the Mind becomes IR irritated and exhausted oh oh oh you feel that man the enemy does all he can do to bring mental fatigue isn't that didn't brother Brown say that this age would go insane the mental illnesses that are out there I don't even want to give you the statistics that are out there it's I I I I go to the states and I'm hearing on the radio that the mental illness is such on a rampage they got to keep it behind closed doors we have mentally insane dangerous people walking the streets today yeah no they're walking the streets they're walking right by you every day time bombs right ready to explode but greater is he is in me unusual sluggishness and tired unusual I know we get tired but unusual a lack of energy are often the results of extended attacks we don't even realize it sometimes we're getting bombarded we're attack we don't even realize that we're under attack we start losing energy we start we start falling into the categories of these and we're under attack you know how many times like I said I can only speak for myself how many times you're under this attack and all these symptoms are starting to take place in your life and you still don't wake up you still don't recognize what's going on by taking the word by taking the power of Prayer by taking the spoken word in your own life and attacking back amen and cast him out yes and rebuke him these attacks certainly these issues can occur with natural problems lack of sleep Health battles in case through the roots this is the effect of prolonged spiritual battles but we must discern the Spirit we must discern the body of the Lord Amen brother BR said the greatest thing that we need in this day is discernment why people look at it before and they say well we need to discern what the preacher in these messages and message churches are preaching of course but that's not it only we got to discern in our own lives we got to discern these things we're talking about this morning so that you can be walking victoriously just coming to church just reading your Bible just listening to the Tes ain't going to make you Victorious that's right it's taking the word of faith it's taking the word of God it's applying the word and speaking the word is going to make you Victorious amen it's overcoming to him that overcome will I grant the sh with me number eight lck wow a sign that you're under attack is a lack attack there are times when it seems that all your resources dry up at the same time not only spiritually financially man what's going on here sometimes we think to ourselves and say wow man this happened and then that happened and this happened and that happened and this person took that that person will pay me this one happen this one happen this you sit there and you go and then what happens all these other symptoms come in and Satan attacks more and he attacks more instead of us recognizing hold on a minute here hold on a minute what are you trying to do you devil you're trying to attack me here you're trying to attack me here you're trying to attack me here I got to take the word of God I going to take my power pray and I'm going to start attacking back amen oh that's what God wants to see amen yes instead of you coming and crying here and crying there crying to one another picking up the phone crying here crying there God wants to see you recognizing these things getting on your knees amen and getting down the prayer amen if the situation is tough some come up by fasting and prayer get into fasting and praying about your situation take care of it amen get down

back all the church doesn't have money to put put this program on the church doesn't have money this or they're struggling with this or struggling with that saints of God is an attack on the body of Jesus Christ are you part of this body yes sir are you part of this ministry do you belong here are you wondering here Wonder from here Wonder from there Wonder from here have you made up your mind a double-minded man or woman is unstable in all their ways God cannot deal with that kind of person make up your mind amen either you belong or you don't belong either you're on the Lord's Side or you're not God rather you hot or cold not lukewarm it's the age of lukewarmness it's the age of lukewarmness in this message people are not taking the word of God that was brought forth you believe a prophet you believe God sent a prophet said live it it live the message you brought amen stop playing around with it amen and believe it with all your heart you believe it's the truth that is God's prophet and it's his word then give your life for it amen hallelujah week in prayer number nine Hallelujah I'm got to finish this message Saints I'm got to finish it Hallelujah glory to God four signs that you're under a spiritual attack is weakening of your prayer life oh God I'm telling you this morning okay you come up for prayer if you don't have a prayer life and we'll pray with you I'll pray with you the deacons will pray with you we'll pray with you because if you don't got a prayer life you've got nothing amen a prayer life is just not um you know telling Jesus about all you problems no a prayer life is speaking the word of God Amen a prayer life is confessing the word of God prayer life is is is is taking the word of God in your position recognizing who you are and speaking the word of God prayer life is is commanding these things to take place to happen yes to come into existence yes because why God said so God promised it to me amen that's what a prayer life is amen and if Satan has shut your prayer life and shut your mouth amen he closing you down amen and we need to pray together amen we need to cast out that Spirit hallelujah amen you cannot watch for me Jesus said for 1 hour Jesus asked his disciples then he told them watch and pray unless you fall into temptation and that's another reason why we pray we don't fall into temptation to these things that we're talking about right the spirit indeed is willing but the the flesh is weak Matthew 26440 Satan knows the power of prayer and the prayer of a righteous man is powerful is effective the Bible says it affected much much your prayers do much damage to the kingdom of Satan yes your prayers do much to bless your life too yes Hallelujah other lives amen and the body of Jesus Christ yes March Hallelujah number 10 old habits and Lifestyles resurface wow that's a that's a that's a a big attack amen hallelujah spiritual attacks old iniquities your old Rel life surface and I've been through it listen you can you can you can be as honest I want you to be as honest and open and and to the word of God this morning and and the only way way I can make you feel comfortable with that I've been there when I've been under attack I've been realizing why might getting these old feelings I know what has happened inside of me I know what has happened in my soul and nothing changes that but why am I when I'm under attack and extreme pressure for amounts of times and times and times and then these desires of the flesh come back up the old music you used to listen to you put it on the radio there and you wow wow I feel happy oh wow I remember how this used to make me feel good oh yeah in all movies you sit down oh I feel comfortable oh you know what I feel comfortable tonight but you sit down watch a movie and you don't realize right till God wakes you up I've been there you know what I thank God I was there too I'm not contrary to what I'm preaching here I thank God in there because he done something for me am I realize the channel That doesn't make me feel good it's a trap yes it's a deception TV music all that stuff is a trap and deception you can you come to me and tell me in this world in the music and the movies that are out there there's not signs lical signs and and and the things that are designed in there to speak to you to take over your soul they even said themselves they release Spirits through the TV amen you know that the TV flashes so much I don't know the technology of it flashes so much that if you watch it for so long the TVs they have today will actually stop your heart take control of your mind stop your heart and if if if this the light Reflections can do that what about the the the the messages that are coming through the TV right and the music what to capture your soul to get to to to cause this attack to come upon you to to to paralyze you to take away your faith your hope you're you're walking in the spirit your victory in Christ your desire all these things your energy it's designed to do that wake up the Lord is saying wake up to these things wake up to these attacks we don't do this by law we don't we don't we don't separate ourselves things by law but we separate because of the spirit amen we separate ourselves unto God to his Spirit don't we while we separate from the spirits of this world that's right what husband you heard it said many times a husband and a wife what husband wants his wife mingling with other guys flirting with other guys listening to other guys' ideas and their opinions and their their their their Vice it goes you know there's Fellowship amongst one another amen but there's a line that is drawn and that carnality and that fleshly and all the lust of the of the flesh starts coming into that that's what's out there no man wants that with his wife mingling amen hallelujah what do you think Jesus what do you think he wants his wife think about it think about it you're the Bride of Jesus Christ this morning he's your husband think about what he wants does he want you mingling and and and moving and and and feeding off of other people's the devil's Spirits out there no things like that no he doesn't want you that that you're his wife you should be proud to be his wife you should be proud to be by his side you should give yourself totally unto him Amen in every way every way possible bring yourself subject to the Lord he's your husband is he bu he are you married this morning oh God yes Lord amen thank you Jesus amen pulling away from Godly relationships that's an attack how many times we see it happen in the church when when Satan attacks some way that's why we try to go after them not only the deacons but you go after them when you see Satan attacking them they start uh disconnecting themselves from Godly Fellowship Godly relationship ship and they start clinging to worldly relationship caral relationship and they feel more comfortable around people of this world not that we don't love them not that we don't but when you start feeling more comfortable around them than the children of God you're under attack amen you're under attack amen and remember life and death lies at every attack amen amen amen Pull It Away Hallelujah I'm just going to go over these things quickly I think he has some of them you can read them up there amen thank you Lord questions directed the call that was once cleared questioning your call that was once so clear to you that you're a son and daughter of God that God is giving you a revelation of this word this message of this hour God has revealed that to you once was so clear but you know sometimes we're not talking about a month here we're not talking about a week here or a day here sometimes we're talking about years 10 15 years Satan pounding at you pound like to get the person that was once clear on who they are to to start questioning that has to be years and years of pounding and pounding and there's last years are years of really disobeying the Lord too his calling CU all over those years he's calling you to surrender he's calling you to die out amen amen you're disobeying somewhere remember that too these are attacks but remember you can overcome these attacks you can be aware of these attacks but if these attacks overtake you and overcome you for a period of time it's because you're not listening to the Lord amen amen the enemy attacks and gives them reasons to give up to the thing that God called them to the one of his master tools he releases confusion shame intimidation various schemes create a cloud of uncertainty the unlimited goal of a Believer off the pathway of his Destiny his position under attack he may find himself deeply questioning the road that he's traveling maybe there's somebody here this morning reexamining his decisions that was once Crystal Clear often time a person in the midst of these attacks will question pathetic words spiritual breakthroughs significant experiences that they had oh yeah this is a step towards moving backwards in the spirit and the Lord says those who draw back I have no pleasure in it's not drawing back it's going forward amen do Nots the do Nots to bring the enemy's attacks once you have taken a stand against the enemy as attacks there are five do not so you must remember do not forget who made you who called you who created you God created you with storms in mind remember that every trial every test everything that you have to face God created cre you place that word that portion of the word that who you are inside of you to meet every challenge that will come across your life he designed you that way don't ever forget that so anytime a storm and anything comes up I'm equipped I'm equipped to handle this and to go through it do not forsake time of place of prayer a don't forsake a time of prayer and a place of Prayer PR a successful prayer life brings much Deliverance amen your church is a place of power amen where you come and you receive the power is gathered here this morning it's not just me it's all of us that is gathered here this morning is a place of power your power your faith you're believing this morning might set somebody free over here over here or over here we must not forsake that and the Bible says don't forsake to assemble yourselves together even more is that day approaches amen why you're hearing it this morning do not dis disconnect from Pastor protection don't come from underneath your pastor when you're called to a pastor amen it's not the man don't look at the man don't look at the deacons don't look at the man look at the position God honors his position it's all through the Bible he La it out in the Old Testament and he bring it to the New Testament he places people in position of power and he meets them there he meets you there amen and the devil will try to make you run away from the pastor make you feel ashamed make you feel ashamed of your sin and everything like that when he knows because he knows that's the place that God will meet you amen and deliver you that's right and provide what you have need of at times amen amen if you're under attack you can arm yourself against enemy schemes equip yourself to fight to win you are made to Outlast the storm Matthew 7:2 24-27 when the enemy comes in as a flood Hallelujah God my God will raise a standard against him my God will make his word more real to me he'll give me the Revelation that I need to expose the enemy yes to discern what's going on in my life amen that's what my God will do and he'll do it for you amen every single time Saints not one time he hasn't lost one battle amen we might lose a battle but you know Jesus hasn't lost one he can never lose one amen Oh Glory glory to God what an army you're in this morning if you believe three keys to freedom I think we got that one yes once you recognize the attack being raised up in faith and I'm getting ready to close Saints amen and Authority that Jesus has given you rebuke the attack break his power over your life remember Jesus gave us power and authority over all demons and to heal diseases Luke 9:1 here are the three keys for your freedom Break It by faith with faith without faith is impossible to please him he that comes to God must believe that he's a rewarder of those who seek Him Hebrews 11:6 revelation of who you are in the body of Jesus Christ amen break it with prayer you take Faith you take prayer amen amen and bring your faith and your prayer and your petition and pray in the spirit Hallelujah you're praying all the the the equipment of God all the armor of God and the spirit of God not by might but not by power but by my spirit say the Lord into your prayer life into your spoken word into your faith and you're speaking the word Hallelujah with perseverance perseverance boldness to speak the word of God Amen break it with resistance so many times the Bible says we haven't resisted unto blood yet so many times we don't resist that devil so many times we give into it we give into depression we give into oppression we give into all these things that we're talking about this morning fear complexes we give into it so much we got to resist it we got to fight against it we got to say no you don't belong to me you don't belong in me you don't belong around me or part of me the blood breaks it amen does anybody understand what I'm saying this morning you understand what's going on here this morning oh God hallelujah break it with resistance submit therefore to God not the devil not to your flesh to God resist the devil and he will flee from you James 4:7 the enemy loves to hide remain hidden doesn't he love that maybe in your battle this morning maybe what you're going through this morning maybe when you're struggling for maybe years this morning he's staying there he's hidden there and sometimes he you know he uses your own Pride your own stubbornness that's right he uses that against you right to destroy you and you sit there and you use that Pride you keep that Pride that stinking Pride you keep that stubbornness you can't humble yourself before the Lord that he may lift you up think about it amen it's true Hallelujah humble yourself yes Jesus submit yourself you're forsaken the greatest experience that lies right before you this morning and you're walk with the Lord by keeping those things let them go let them go you're nothing I'm nothing none of us are nothing this morning without him amen nothing amen and you're the world everybody's going to find out when it comes to the day of judgment every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess every religion they're going to find out they're nothing without Jesus Christ that's right I just want to surrender here hallelujah I want to surrender at the mighty hand of God here I want to humble myself here I want to give my life here I want this to here to manifest right here and right now that I can stand beside him I just be privileged to sit while he stands there at judgment just a beside him that's all I'm not looking for nothing just to be there with the Saints of all just with him just to look upon his face amen Jesus it's not a song to me it's real to me the one who saved me every single day by Grace by Grace I'm being saved every dayah yes Lord the only reason why I'm up here is by Grace the next time I come up here is by Grace oh God let me just close this off here let us go to the last last um there you go I love it I love the word because it's who I am it's who you are notice the harmony of the father and the son Jesus never did anything until first it was shown to him by the Father John 5:19 this harmony now exists that's not going to be it exists amen amen between the groom and his bride he shows her the word of life and she receives it she never doubts it therefore or nothing can harm her are we listening Hallelujah listen with your heart not even death not even death There Is No Death in the camp here amen there's only graduations and Saints going home because God hallelujah right we don't understand we don't need to understand and we should never question God why he knows why he'll take care of everything that goes on Amen Hallelujah when he wants to take me home I know that my wife is not going to be happy and my kids and hopefully some of you won't be happy but you know what I'm going to be happy hallelujah hallelujah that's the way we should be amen for if the seed be planted by the water it will rise again here it is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in Mary the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what to do what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word of God in his name for she has thus say the Lord amen I hope this is making sense then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted and watered becomes the full Harvest servant is purpose that's come musicians those in the bride will only do his will no one can make her do otherwise no no devil can make her do otherwise those in a bride amen they have thus saved the Lord or they keep still they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while he was here in his Earthly Ministry now he his works and and through the bride now he's working through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that must be done now but now but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for a specific time amen you know Saints I came across this story here I want to say just quickly you know palm trees you know that we're type of trees right no even there the tree of the garden we know it wasn't fruit or nothing trees we we type people are types of trees right and pond trees you know that they go 70 ft up in the air but they also go 300 ft under the ground wow so that when the storm comes I mean it's common sense right the roots are so deep that it anchors and the palm trees sways and sways and it's able to Bear the storm and some people are deeply rooted in the word but there's also redwood trees you know they go 300 ft up in the air but you know they only go 3 feet down how can a tree one go 70 ft up in the air 300 ft down that makes sense to me right it'll hold through the storms but one tree goes 300 feet up in the air and only 3 ft down but see the key to this that I came came across is that the roots go out and they spread out for miles and miles and the roots of every Redwood joins themselves together and they interwine each other and they hold each other like this together oh they only go 3 fet down they're all joined together for miles and miles every tree Redwood joins itself they find each other they seek each other's out their roots and they go and they join together they hold together what's the scripture say about a Yol being broken not easily broken when two when one walks alone but when two walks together when we join ourselves together you know even a redwood even if it Dives they can go into the forest and they'll go and they'll look and they'll see a redwood dead but it still be standing you know why because the other red Woods won't let him go amen holds on to them amen and that's the way we should be in the body of Jesus Christ not individually amen only rooted to yourself but rooted together in love join together amen when this Army this F comes together like that and don't let each other's hold hold on to each other pray for one another when you go to a struggle when you go to a problem in your life in your marriage in your home with your kids the struggles that we're going don't criticize join together in prayer join together with your brother and sister and even if you see that they're dying hold them up have faith and hold them up like the trees they won't let it go you're not dead you're going to come back amen hallelujah let us stand recognize when you're under spiritual attack Hold Your Position Mighty Army of God Amen soldiers of the Cross We're All in This Together amen when you walk out of here today it's not well we hit a good sermon brother Tim I didn't do nothing we're together as an army amen are we going to fight are we going to bring this to the End Amen are we going to bring this battle to Victory are we going to show that there was Victory on the cross in our lives are we going to show the world again that Jesus Christ is alive they're looking for it Saints regardless of what what what it seems out there they're looking for it amen Jesus died to everything everything that he could have had on this Earth he died to it so that he can do the father's will even unto death he gave up his life are you willing to give up your life whatever God is calling you to do are you willing to be a soldier are you willing to get behind it God wants people not to
