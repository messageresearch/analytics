[5:17] these things God shall add unto him the
[5:20] plagues that are written in this book
[5:21] and if any man shall take away from the
[5:24] words of this book of this prophecy
[5:27] shall God take away his part out of the

[36:47] here in the presence of the Lord God

[36:53] wonderful name uh we will look to the
[36:56] word of God as we welcome all of you I
[36:59] see a lot of nice fresh faces in here
[37:02] and we are thankful to God for that amen
[37:06] we're looking to Psalms
[37:09] 139 if that scripture is up it should be
[37:13] up very soon on the screen uh before me
[37:18] and we'll read from the word of God
[37:22] verses 15 and 16.
[37:26] as I said last week I'm not really
[37:30] preaching I'm teaching on a word of God
[37:34] right and as such listen closely and let
[37:39] the word of God permeate your soul and
[37:43] your entire life
[37:51] my substance was not hid from thee
[37:56] When I Was Made In Secret
[38:00] and curiously wrought in the lowest part
[38:04] of the Earth
[38:06] Thine Eyes did see my substance
[38:11] yet being unperfect
[38:14] and in thy book were all my members
[38:18] written
[38:20] which in continuance were fashioned when
[38:25] as yet
[38:26] there was none of them
[38:30] I praise God now you know that was not
[38:34] written about Adam that really was
[38:37] written about Jesus
[38:39] Christ
[38:41] God in his mind you know and this so
[38:45] here was David the prophet on the
[38:48] inspiration but he was vocalizing uh
[38:52] what God had in his mind concerning
[38:56] Jesus knowing all the members of the
[38:59] body and everything else before they
[39:01] even came down here he knew them and and
[39:04] so on he's talking about that right
[39:07] there at this point praise the Lord let
[39:10] us borrow his look to the Lord in prayer
[39:13] our gracious uh loving unrighteous
[39:16] Heavenly Father
[39:18] we are absolutely a wonderful and
[39:21] privileged people
[39:24] oh God that thou would look down upon us
[39:29] and that you would give us your word for
[39:31] the age father
[39:33] Lord God we think that we uh can come
[39:38] here and invite your presence but we are
[39:43] the ones that are privileged to be
[39:45] invited into your divine presence
[39:49] the Lord maybe just appreciate your
[39:54] divine presence may this Spirit of
[39:56] almighty God go through this entire
[39:59] congregation and rest upon each believer
[40:03] that they might come to realize the
[40:06] reality of which we speak not of words
[40:09] only but of your very presence and your
[40:13] anointing upon the word giving us
[40:17] understanding and wisdom and eternal
[40:19] things for your glory and honor for we
[40:22] ask it in Jesus name God bless you
[40:25] please be seated
[40:28] okay
[40:34] now of course we know that Adam was
[40:37] always in God's mind Adam was already in
[40:42] God's mind and God knew everything about
[40:45] him and if you'll read that scripture it
[40:48] says here my substance was not hidden
[40:51] from thee praise God When I Was Made In
[40:54] Secret
[40:55] amen when he was coming from the spirit
[41:01] world and being made into substance amen
[41:06] praise the Lord and God looked and God
[41:09] could see every member just like you
[41:12] know every member of your body you know
[41:14] your fingers your toes you know
[41:15] everything God knew God is saying I knew
[41:18] all the members uh in that body and of
[41:21] Jesus I know all the members that will
[41:23] be uh in that body everything about them
[41:27] praise God I knew them and he said I I
[41:30] knew them you see see the eyes that see
[41:35] my substance yep being on perfect not
[41:38] fully manifest yet you see it before it
[41:41] even come into existence and in thy book
[41:45] where all my members in thy book
[41:49] were all the members they were already
[41:52] in the book
[41:53] they're already in the book of
[41:55] redemption they were already in the
[41:58] Lamb's Book of Life
[41:59] they don't come down here to come to an
[42:04] alternate path so that their names could
[42:06] be added to that book of life because
[42:09] God's thoughts are eternal
[42:12] and God can have a new thought because
[42:16] his thoughts are Eternal and unchanging
[42:20] and therefore God being Perfection of
[42:24] perfection nothing can be added to his
[42:27] thoughts because they are perfect to
[42:30] begin with and therefore we find out
[42:34] that it's not a new name now written
[42:37] down in glory that name had to be
[42:41] already in the book yeah
[42:43] and then God confirms it God certifies
[42:48] it
[42:48] God is the one that comes and put his
[42:51] seal of approval upon it and identifies
[42:55] it that that individual is one of his
[42:59] own
[43:00] not by their own choosing but of his
[43:04] choosing because he chose you
[43:07] you didn't just choose him
[43:10] you see he chose you praise God I'm glad
[43:14] he chose me because he said I chose you
[43:18] you didn't choose me I am the vine you
[43:22] were the branches you're only the
[43:24] branches for me to express myself so I
[43:27] chose you right you have not chosen me
[43:31] between a man and a woman use a marriage
[43:34] the man chooses who will be his wife if
[43:38] you want to say that's the woman's
[43:40] choice is like us when we come down here
[43:43] what would be looked upon as our choice
[43:46] is our acceptance of his choice
[43:51] accepting the word accepting the promise
[43:54] for your day accepting that what he said
[43:57] what he did whatever he says to us we
[44:02] believe it that it is so
[44:05] amen that is the bright choice or you
[44:09] can use the word that's the bright
[44:10] acceptance of his word praise God now
[44:15] the Bible says it clearly according to
[44:17] the church age but can I have some of
[44:19] the pages of the church age book care uh
[44:22] photocopied so I can refer to some old
[44:25] notes I scrambled through the years now
[44:28] how that when the woman comes to the man
[44:32] in the East and comes for the wedding
[44:35] she comes with a veil on our face
[44:39] and that
[44:40] veggies for us today we know nothing we
[44:45] become we might read the Bible read the
[44:47] scriptures and we know intellectually
[44:50] but really we know nothing and so she
[44:53] comes with a veil on her face amen but
[44:58] then when she comes with the veil in our
[45:01] face they they uh culture or else that
[45:07] he would come and lift the veil from off
[45:11] her face aren't you glad that our lord
[45:13] Jesus Is Lifting the veil from off our
[45:17] spiritual ignorance to this word of God
[45:19] and the word of God is making itself
[45:22] plain and clear to us so we can
[45:25] understand who we are who he is our
[45:30] place and our position and how we are to
[45:33] act in regards to him
[45:35] acknowledging his headship
[45:38] acknowledging his leadership
[45:40] acknowledging his position as husband
[45:44] and Lord and Savior baptizer and soon
[45:48] coming King glory be to God on high
[45:51] Hallelujah I said I wasn't going to
[45:53] preach
[45:55] so let me just I I'm trying to do that
[46:00] so I can stay calm enough to bring the
[46:02] word to you amen praise the Lord so we
[46:06] thank God that he is the same yesterday
[46:09] today and forever praise the Lord
[46:14] hallelujah so there we understand
[46:16] therefore that we were always a part of
[46:21] the book of redemption
[46:23] now we are in the place where we have
[46:26] become a part of the manifested book of
[46:30] redemption
[46:31] because we are manifesting what is in
[46:34] the book
[46:35] and that is trying to speak to the rest
[46:39] of the world and the rest of the people
[46:41] because they always have their this idea
[46:45] that God is a fearsome creature or
[46:48] person in the sky waiting to bring down
[46:51] judgment upon you or or to Doom upon you
[46:55] and God has come into the hearts of the
[46:59] True Believers men and women to infill
[47:02] them living them and to manifest into
[47:06] the world that he is not a god of
[47:09] judgment
[47:10] he is the god of love and grace
[47:14] but with love comes comfort and
[47:18] discipline
[47:19] and so God balances his word that we
[47:22] could recognize who he is he is pure
[47:25] love not the love of man but this is the
[47:29] Zoe the love of God the fullness of who
[47:33] he is amen praise the Lord so we are
[47:37] glad that we are in God's book amen
[47:40] praise the Lord now we'll talk about the
[47:44] natural election that we are all a part
[47:47] of and we'll talk a little bit about the
[47:50] spiritual election of which we are of by
[47:54] the grace of God and listen to quote
[47:57] from your church ages
[48:00] which I did last week he has never had a
[48:04] new thought about anything
[48:08] because all his thoughts he has always
[48:12] had and always will have them
[48:16] and knows the end from the beginning
[48:20] because he is God
[48:22] thus the thoughts of God are eternal
[48:27] is always have these thoughts and he is
[48:31] eternal and if he always had them his
[48:34] thoughts are Eternal as he is eternal
[48:36] and so that's those these thoughts of
[48:39] God are Eternal not only that they are
[48:43] real
[48:45] not like a man like he said in in
[48:48] continuing this which I wouldn't read it
[48:51] but he said it there not like a man
[48:53] having a blueprint and then later on
[48:56] he's going to go and and work to make
[48:59] that blueprint come into reality he says
[49:03] when God has his thoughts his thoughts
[49:07] are already real
[49:09] amen this thoughts were already real
[49:12] they're just waiting for when he wants
[49:15] to speak or to cause them to come into
[49:18] manifestation or expression amen praise
[49:23] the name of the Lord amen so we know
[49:26] those thoughts were in God's mind before
[49:29] there was even a moon or a star
[49:32] do you know you were there before the
[49:36] mood of the Stars you were there before
[49:39] any molecule
[49:41] you were there before any autumn
[49:44] anything was there you were there
[49:47] because remember Elohim the
[49:50] self-existent one was alone with his
[49:55] thoughts in him amen and of course we
[49:58] were chosen in him thus since when we
[50:01] were chosen because we were already in
[50:04] him he was there with his thoughts amen
[50:08] praise God hallelujah so uh thank God so
[50:13] therefore when he turned and asked job
[50:16] this wonderful question which we all
[50:19] know you're trying to jug his spiritual
[50:23] memory and to bring him out of his
[50:26] spiritual Amnesia by the way job where
[50:29] were you
[50:30] when the morning stars were singing up
[50:34] in heaven and shouting for joy and
[50:37] glorifying my name where were your job
[50:40] trying to bring his memory back to who
[50:43] he really was you're not just a human
[50:46] being here come to Born die and pass
[50:49] away You're an eternal being you come
[50:52] from God and you're going back to God
[50:54] you come from the presence and bosom of
[50:57] the great God of heaven and return to
[51:00] God we are not of time we come from
[51:03] eternity amen and we're going back to
[51:06] Eternity from Once We Came praise God
[51:09] we're right now on our journey
[51:12] we are traveling home to God
[51:15] and I think I hear it's separate time
[51:18] and I hear my father call amen I hear
[51:22] the call I feel the pull I know this is
[51:26] the season and the hour of the opening
[51:28] of the word of God and I've received it
[51:31] within my heart praise God hallelujah
[51:34] amen oh where were you can you see
[51:38] yourself if you were there amongst them
[51:40] I've preached it before I'll say it
[51:43] again if you're shouted for him when
[51:46] you're up there you won't come down here
[51:48] and have your mouth
[51:50] I'm not going to praise you
[51:53] you can say and reveal whatever you want
[51:56] I'm not gonna I'm Not Gonna Worship you
[51:58] that's the spirit of the devil but the
[52:01] sons of God under Divine anointing when
[52:04] that truth of God strikes their soul
[52:07] they will act the same way down here
[52:10] just like they did when they were up
[52:13] there there were Praises name they will
[52:15] give him the glory they'll give him the
[52:17] honor be can't help it because they are
[52:20] part of it they're part of it and
[52:24] they'll do the same things that if you
[52:26] fought God up there if you brought war
[52:28] in heaven against him you want to bring
[52:30] war in the church you want to link war
[52:32] in the home you want to bring War
[52:34] wherever you go amen but if you were
[52:37] shouting praising God give him glory and
[52:40] honor you will glorify his name down
[52:43] here glorify his word down here praise
[52:46] God hallelujah amen amen I'm glad that I
[52:51] can say I'm one of them
[52:53] I'm one of them praise God somebody said
[52:57] uh brother Simon looks like you my
[53:00] goodness that you all uh crossed up I
[53:03] said no I've been to the Cross
[53:05] oh my well you act like you're a fanatic
[53:10] that's right I've been to the attic too
[53:12] praise the Lord amen praise God brother
[53:15] sister something has got a hold of us
[53:19] when that Prophet a message was released
[53:23] from him it's not just the words that we
[53:26] see written on the spoken word book page
[53:28] it's not even what we just hear but our
[53:33] power was released from the presence of
[53:35] God and that power and presence is
[53:38] shaking ourselves
[53:40] Hallelujah I I I I just as it came to me
[53:44] I released that I said that to you it's
[53:46] the same thing brother Brandon was
[53:48] trying to get us to know look he turned
[53:51] us back and he says oh your name is Mrs
[53:54] so-and-so when you were small you were
[53:56] on a tree were eating corn you ate too
[53:59] much you got sick and from then on it
[54:01] created a vowel problem and you have
[54:04] this and that not be healed in the name
[54:06] of Jesus Christ Hallelujah you know he
[54:10] was trying to let us know faith is like
[54:13] that you stand up anyway any one of us
[54:17] and somebody tries to creep up behind
[54:20] you the moment they get close enough
[54:23] you don't know what it is I can't
[54:25] explain it something in you causes you
[54:28] to know
[54:30] you're not guessing how you know you're
[54:32] not guessing you're not seeing the
[54:34] person but you say oh but but I feel his
[54:37] presence how did you feel it how what
[54:40] what you know you see he's trying to
[54:43] explain to us that's how Revelation is
[54:45] like when God opens up the word to you
[54:48] you begin to see something in the word
[54:52] and you try to explain what you see you
[54:55] can only explain the written parts or
[54:58] whatever but that that power that has
[55:02] come and touch your soul touch your
[55:05] being
[55:06] you'll know that that's real that's true
[55:10] that that can't be changed you can't you
[55:14] can't do away with it it's part of me
[55:16] amen hallelujah praise God that's what
[55:20] it all it is and even saying that can't
[55:23] explain it it just gives you an inkling
[55:25] of an understanding so that you would
[55:28] recognize if you're one of those people
[55:30] praise God God one of those Noah
[55:34] noirs
[55:35] knowing people that recognize something
[55:39] from the presence of the Living God
[55:42] hallelujah you know God can come the
[55:45] things that are not as though they were
[55:48] and though those those members of his
[55:51] body were not yet made manifest he can
[55:55] Comfort them as they are Amen in the
[55:59] word says that I mean I'm saying it like
[56:01] that but while I'm speaking you
[56:02] understand that it's the word my mind is
[56:04] on the word and I'm bringing out from
[56:06] the word what the prophet said what the
[56:08] Bible says and I may not quote the
[56:11] entire verse or quote the quote or the
[56:13] scripture month year but I'm bringing
[56:16] out the truth that is encapsulated in
[56:18] that word that you might understand what
[56:21] God is saying in this hour praise the
[56:24] Lord hallelujah amen now we find out
[56:28] that these are amen that the thoughts of
[56:33] God are Eternal amen they are real they
[56:39] are not like a man with a blueprint that
[56:41] he has drawn up which one day he will
[56:45] then be substance and form what they are
[56:50] already real and eternal and they are a
[56:54] part of God hallelujah you're a part of
[56:57] God you're a part of God I don't know
[57:00] which part but you're a part of God Amen
[57:04] praise God you may not like me but I'm
[57:06] still a part of God
[57:10] is that right
[57:11] I don't know which part I could be the
[57:14] bomb but I'm still a part of God I'm
[57:17] saying that way to bring it down to
[57:18] earth now you might understand this is
[57:21] real
[57:22] doesn't matter which part we are whether
[57:24] you're a finger whether you're a toe or
[57:27] hair or whatever you're a part of God
[57:30] God himself amen praise the name of the
[57:33] Lord amen glory to God hallelujah I'm so
[57:38] thankful I'm part of him now to go back
[57:42] God was alone let me use the term Elohim
[57:47] because God of course there's so many
[57:49] gods you just say God it makes the
[57:53] person think you're just religious but
[57:55] Elohim the self-existing one
[57:59] not to go but to give you an Insight the
[58:02] Greek that word is actually plural
[58:05] it speaks of one being but somehow that
[58:08] being seems plural that's where they get
[58:10] these figments of the imagination it
[58:12] gets them to believe in a try a triunity
[58:15] and all this kinds of stuff but it was
[58:17] Elohim sitting in the darkness with his
[58:21] thoughts in him
[58:22] and so a plural Greek word is used amen
[58:28] because we were already in God himself
[58:31] as persons I'm not talking about the
[58:34] physical part of you but the spirit
[58:36] being that lives in you that was with
[58:41] God and in God from the beginning before
[58:44] the foundation of the world Amen there
[58:48] was no light anywhere there was just
[58:51] darkness everywhere
[58:53] and we were already in his mind but at
[58:57] this point we he did didn't put us in
[59:00] his mouth for We Are Never in his mouth
[59:03] but we passed through his mouth when he
[59:06] said let there be light
[59:08] and The Light Came Upon the face of the
[59:11] Earth coming bringing it understanding
[59:14] that he said I am the light of the world
[59:16] I am the light he will he is the pillar
[59:18] of fire he is the everything and out of
[59:21] him he spoke sons and daughters and they
[59:24] were expressed here upon the face of the
[59:27] Earth Hallelujah and so when he was in
[59:30] the darkness we were there
[59:32] we were there with him where were you
[59:35] job I was there praise God you look in
[59:38] the Book of Proverbs I believe and then
[59:41] you will see a more outline
[59:43] the same spirit of God speaking that I
[59:46] was there when you did this I was there
[59:50] when you did such and such I was there
[59:52] you'll find that somewhere in the Book
[59:54] of Proverbs but praise God hallelujah
[59:57] I'm glad we were with him in eternity
[59:59] and you know eternity has no beginning
[1:00:02] no starting place in other words and it
[1:00:05] has no ending Place
[1:00:07] eternity doesn't start and it doesn't
[1:00:09] end because it's one Circle that's why
[1:00:13] marriage rings are uh you know the image
[1:00:17] of Eternity is there on that ring that's
[1:00:20] what he's talking about we are there we
[1:00:23] say till death do us part but that's the
[1:00:26] natural thing where you part but the
[1:00:29] spirit man and woman if they are two
[1:00:32] seeds of God they're never part amen
[1:00:35] they never will whether Brandon proved
[1:00:37] that he went to heaven met his daughter
[1:00:39] in every they were all there because
[1:00:42] they're part of the whole word of God
[1:00:44] hallelujah amen so we thank God
[1:00:48] hallelujah amen amen but where with his
[1:00:52] thoughts he wanted
[1:00:54] to become
[1:00:57] God wanted to become you were the
[1:01:00] prophet talk about that it won't go down
[1:01:02] the length of it you want to be healer
[1:01:03] you want to be savior he wanted to be
[1:01:05] this you want to be that all of that God
[1:01:08] wanted to become amen praise God and you
[1:01:13] know Elohim became Jesus Christ
[1:01:16] is that right
[1:01:18] Elohim became Jesus Christ John 1 1 in
[1:01:22] the beginning was the word the word was
[1:01:23] with God and the Word was Elohim the
[1:01:26] Word was God see so Elohim became Jesus
[1:01:30] Christ coming down through the various
[1:01:34] stages of his and morphe coming down
[1:01:37] from thought coming down to being a
[1:01:40] theophany and Melchizedek and from
[1:01:42] Melchizedek Prophet said that he was he
[1:01:45] was just in the state of and morphing in
[1:01:48] himself until he became fully flesh Amen
[1:01:53] in Jesus Christ praise the name of the
[1:01:56] Lord so Elohim became Jesus Christ
[1:02:00] Hallelujah which was God's God's thought
[1:02:04] of himself
[1:02:06] expressed in the person of Jesus Christ
[1:02:10] amen praise God hallelujah and in the
[1:02:13] same way God's thoughts are also became
[1:02:18] expressed but we did not come Express as
[1:02:22] Jesus Christ we become expressed as Sons
[1:02:25] and Daughters of God
[1:02:27] amen we come expressed as a bride we
[1:02:31] come Express other not one body but a
[1:02:35] many membered body praise the Lord oh
[1:02:39] praise God slow down here there is not
[1:02:41] it's not two bodies I'm talking about
[1:02:43] because remember she was in him
[1:02:49] so when he came he was the fullness
[1:02:53] of all the thoughts everything that was
[1:02:56] in the godhead
[1:02:57] bodily is that right amen so when he was
[1:03:02] there we were in him by the way there's
[1:03:04] his rising of the sun uh this is the
[1:03:08] last thing I printed off here he says
[1:03:10] but remember when he went there
[1:03:14] to the Cross he's talking about you were
[1:03:17] there with him
[1:03:19] in him
[1:03:21] because God had never separated the
[1:03:25] bride from the groom as yet
[1:03:28] so when God looked down upon that body
[1:03:32] of Christ
[1:03:33] hanging there he saw what male and
[1:03:37] female
[1:03:38] it was all redeemed in that one body
[1:03:43] they are one and the same word the same
[1:03:48] word speaks of the groom it speaks of
[1:03:51] the Bride amen that's the rising of the
[1:03:54] sun we see he sang when he was hanging
[1:03:57] on the cross amen
[1:03:59] you are there in him
[1:04:02] that's another sermon God had his wife
[1:04:05] in him Adam came down his wife wasn't
[1:04:08] him Jesus came down his wife wasn't him
[1:04:10] you know and so on and you take the word
[1:04:13] and you can break that and express it
[1:04:15] and make manifest how God LED these
[1:04:18] things in the world that we can see how
[1:04:20] we got here how we got here and how
[1:04:24] we're gonna get back there going up
[1:04:26] Jacob's Ladder by the grace of the
[1:04:28] Living God hallelujah aren't you glad
[1:04:30] you're a part of him
[1:04:33] hallelujah thank God
[1:04:36] and all these members God knew them
[1:04:40] oh my in that wonderful why Prophet
[1:04:43] spoke he says do you know that when God
[1:04:45] when God looked God even knew the color
[1:04:49] you're here
[1:04:51] he knew every one of those thoughts he
[1:04:54] knew how you would look he says when
[1:04:57] that one thought goes down there uh just
[1:05:01] like I let Mary said just call his name
[1:05:04] Jesus
[1:05:06] that's an Earthly name there's a lot of
[1:05:09] jesuses in the Spanish World especially
[1:05:11] but but call his name Jesus so he can be
[1:05:14] recognized there on Earth and he will be
[1:05:16] this this is what his purpose is he's
[1:05:18] going to be you know the savior he will
[1:05:21] be the Redeemer he will do this oh look
[1:05:25] there's another one when he comes down
[1:05:26] here I'll I'll just call his name
[1:05:29] right amen it sounds funny but that's
[1:05:33] exactly God knew this one when we
[1:05:35] couldn't request that one's going to be
[1:05:36] named Mike that one is going to be named
[1:05:38] Susan this one is going to be named Mary
[1:05:41] this one Whatever your name God knew
[1:05:44] your name
[1:05:46] Hallelujah he nor the Earthly name that
[1:05:50] you would be given and you'll be given
[1:05:52] you have to be given that name down here
[1:05:55] because people have to know you
[1:05:58] amen but he already knows you he already
[1:06:01] knows your name from back there that's
[1:06:04] why the seals were opened praise God and
[1:06:08] he now began to call his children by
[1:06:11] their spiritual name praise God what's
[1:06:14] not their natural heirs going to
[1:06:16] recognize it what their spirit will
[1:06:19] recognize and feel the pull of the voice
[1:06:22] of God in these last days amen praise
[1:06:25] God don't tell me don't get excited
[1:06:29] the devil just try to speak and say Lord
[1:06:32] yeah no
[1:06:33] praise God I I can't help it when I see
[1:06:38] this beautiful
[1:06:39] wonderful Words of Life begin to expand
[1:06:43] explode and like a Roman Candlestick and
[1:06:47] lighting up the age that we're living in
[1:06:49] I can't help it but recognize my game my
[1:06:53] message my hour and be excited all about
[1:06:56] it blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:06:58] hallelujah amen so on Earth I let you be
[1:07:02] called John Simon let one be called
[1:07:06] Christopher one we call Danny or
[1:07:08] whatever I'll let them be called that
[1:07:11] here when they get here amen praise God
[1:07:15] and when they get here
[1:07:17] um I'm going to express myself through
[1:07:20] this member of this bar this part of my
[1:07:23] body I'm gonna express myself I I'm
[1:07:26] gonna express myself through this part
[1:07:28] or tomorrow said I'll expect myself
[1:07:31] through this part whatever he chooses to
[1:07:34] express himself out of that's him but
[1:07:37] I'll Express he will Express himself
[1:07:40] through the member of that part of the
[1:07:43] body but all together when I bring them
[1:07:46] all together they are not I mouth foot
[1:07:50] whatever they are the bride they are the
[1:07:53] wife of Christ because they'll make up
[1:07:55] their entire body of Jesus Christ they
[1:07:58] are one in him praise the name of the
[1:08:01] Living God Amen yes sir praise God so we
[1:08:06] come down here and we come to express
[1:08:10] ourselves for what he is amen hallelujah
[1:08:13] amen but all them members actually are
[1:08:18] himself being expressed because he
[1:08:22] wanted to become Jesus Christ
[1:08:25] he wanted to become you
[1:08:29] he gave you the power to become
[1:08:33] is that right to become and so he wanted
[1:08:37] to become you that you might become him
[1:08:41] right that you might go back to that
[1:08:44] place where you reckon recognize you're
[1:08:47] a part of him so he came down to express
[1:08:50] himself and we come down to express the
[1:08:54] rest of it to express ourselves as a
[1:08:57] part of the believing wife the believing
[1:09:01] bride amen praise God but together they
[1:09:06] make one body for it was one body go
[1:09:09] back to Genesis 1 the Bible says and so
[1:09:13] there was Adam and Eve but the Bible
[1:09:15] says if you read the scripture believe
[1:09:17] it's Genesis 3 but he called their name
[1:09:20] Adam
[1:09:22] he called their name Adam praise the
[1:09:26] name of the Lord right now in the same
[1:09:28] in the same thought Jesus hanging on the
[1:09:31] cross there with his wife in him
[1:09:35] their name was Jesus Christ
[1:09:38] so she is Mrs Jesus Christ
[1:09:42] it's not that we are just picking up
[1:09:44] terms and little slogans brother Branham
[1:09:47] priest and said and they're quoting them
[1:09:49] back to you for you to feel good
[1:09:51] this we are seeing reality in the word
[1:09:54] [Applause]
[1:09:56] it's actual fact it's actual substance
[1:09:59] it's actually unfailing reality of the
[1:10:02] Living God making himself known than
[1:10:04] they are in which we live blessed be the
[1:10:07] name of the Lord hallelujah it's all the
[1:10:10] process of Elohim come down and pressing
[1:10:13] or translating or uh and morphing
[1:10:16] himself from Spirit into flesh in the
[1:10:20] hour and that is the whole if you want
[1:10:23] to look at the whole mystery this is all
[1:10:25] this is what it is from Genesis to
[1:10:27] revelation
[1:10:29] amen but the book is now unfolding
[1:10:32] itself now it's now we're getting to
[1:10:36] understand that's why he said one of
[1:10:38] those will be greater than John because
[1:10:42] John and them it was they were in it
[1:10:45] they it wasn't unfolded to them but we
[1:10:48] are now at the end they were looking
[1:10:50] this way to what was going to come and
[1:10:53] some of them were seeing visions but we
[1:10:57] are here looking back at the whole thing
[1:11:00] and God using the seals gives us the
[1:11:03] entire history gives us the entire
[1:11:06] understanding of what happened from
[1:11:08] before the foundations of the world
[1:11:11] right through time through world history
[1:11:14] right to the very hour in which we're
[1:11:16] living amen and showing us the things
[1:11:20] that are going to be
[1:11:23] amen blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:11:27] hallelujah glory to God Amen oh we
[1:11:31] continue here praise God but to go on
[1:11:36] these elect were not only the eternal
[1:11:40] thoughts of God which were to be
[1:11:42] expressed in flesh
[1:11:45] you amen praise God where were you to be
[1:11:48] expressed in flesh praise God in other
[1:11:52] words you couldn't uh express yourself
[1:11:55] just in spirit form
[1:11:57] like I told you Genesis 2 Genesis 3 Adam
[1:12:01] God says in Genesis 2 that God already
[1:12:04] had made Adam but you see was made in
[1:12:07] the image of God which was just the
[1:12:09] spirit man
[1:12:10] a Genesis 3 the Bible says though Adam
[1:12:14] was made it says but there was no man to
[1:12:17] till the soil so the spirit man couldn't
[1:12:20] pick up a spare then go fill the soil
[1:12:22] not that there were Spades there but I
[1:12:25] mean he couldn't really dig cultivate or
[1:12:27] whatever the soil but he saw God then
[1:12:31] gathered of the Dust now not a part of
[1:12:34] himself but he gathered of the Dust man
[1:12:37] if you would say another man he made a
[1:12:41] flesh Man Out of the Dust and then the
[1:12:44] spirit man
[1:12:46] put the spirit man in there
[1:12:48] that he might be in the flesh man now he
[1:12:51] can go and tell the soil now he can go
[1:12:55] and do work in the garden praise the
[1:12:59] name of the Lord so my brothers and
[1:13:01] sisters what a blessed thing that we are
[1:13:03] a part of Amen so we got expressed in
[1:13:06] other words in flesh
[1:13:09] praise God that we can fulfill his
[1:13:12] purpose of what he and his mind praise
[1:13:15] God whatever he wants done in the garden
[1:13:17] we can now do it because you allow us to
[1:13:21] be here in flesh praise God hallelujah
[1:13:24] amen now to be expressed in their new
[1:13:30] season
[1:13:31] praise God takes me to God we are to be
[1:13:35] expressed in our Jew season
[1:13:37] in other words if you were to be born
[1:13:40] and to be made manifest in the age of
[1:13:43] Luther that would be the season God
[1:13:46] wanted you to be in
[1:13:48] that would be the part of the body he
[1:13:51] wanted you to be made manifest in you
[1:13:53] remember we spoke about uh about how God
[1:13:57] building his spiritual body Through the
[1:13:59] Ages Martin Luther being in the feet and
[1:14:01] coming up Wesley the cleansing of the
[1:14:03] body and then coming up to the the age
[1:14:06] just the age of the tongues uh you know
[1:14:09] and then going up to the seeing age of
[1:14:12] the eyes of prophetic eyes of the
[1:14:14] Prophet The Eagle Vision amen and then
[1:14:16] from there beyond that brother Branham
[1:14:18] said beyond that seeing age there are no
[1:14:21] more moving parts
[1:14:22] right we are broken into what you break
[1:14:26] into the mind of God you begin to break
[1:14:29] into the fullness of the revelation of
[1:14:31] the word they only had partial partial
[1:14:35] light partial light partial light they
[1:14:37] are part of it as much as we are but but
[1:14:40] they but the servants that come in the
[1:14:43] last part of the day gets the same pay
[1:14:46] like those who started in the morning
[1:14:48] hour praise the name of the Lord
[1:14:51] salvation is of the Lord and salvation
[1:14:54] is for every one of us who would
[1:14:57] recognize that I am a part of that thank
[1:14:59] you
[1:15:00] amen and so here we are not expressing
[1:15:04] the feet or the tongues that's why the
[1:15:06] prophet stress you are not in the
[1:15:08] Pentecostal age you may act like
[1:15:11] Pentecostal you may shout like
[1:15:13] Pentecostal you may dance like Pentecost
[1:15:15] Rejoice like Pentecostal but the truth
[1:15:19] the Revelation in Your Heart Makes the
[1:15:21] difference right there
[1:15:23] you are not Pentecostals you are Sons
[1:15:27] and Daughters of the promise
[1:15:29] you are Sons and Daughters of the word
[1:15:31] of God for this hour praise the name of
[1:15:34] the Lord
[1:15:35] hallelujah amen praise God to be made
[1:15:40] expressed in their due season in the
[1:15:45] right Church age that you might manifest
[1:15:48] if you weren't Luther you'll be
[1:15:50] manifesting the age of the feet
[1:15:53] you'll be manifesting what the food can
[1:15:55] do if you weren't loot Wesley's age who
[1:15:58] was speaking sanctification and
[1:16:00] spiritual cleansing that's what you you
[1:16:02] would be expressing right if you were in
[1:16:05] the Pentecostal age you would come in
[1:16:07] that age manifesting signs wonders
[1:16:09] Miracles and uh and tongues and
[1:16:12] everything else because that's the age
[1:16:14] you were supposed to be in prison but
[1:16:18] this age up here these Believers can
[1:16:21] manifest all those down there all the
[1:16:25] other things that are done there because
[1:16:27] they are not off that they came out from
[1:16:30] the churches
[1:16:31] we came out of the church ages we were
[1:16:35] but we are not of the churches
[1:16:38] Jesus came true Mary but he is not off
[1:16:41] Mary he come from God and he goes back
[1:16:45] to God we come through the church ages
[1:16:48] but we are not of the church ages we are
[1:16:51] beyond the churches yes we are broken
[1:16:54] out of the seven day week and may have
[1:16:57] broke into the Eighth Day the new day
[1:17:00] the rising of the Sun the son of man
[1:17:03] Christ Jesus being revealed again
[1:17:08] not in the physical form but in the
[1:17:11] spirit being making himself known by the
[1:17:15] opening of his own word god being his
[1:17:17] own interpreter and with us to make
[1:17:21] himself plain and known to every one of
[1:17:24] us praise the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:17:26] Hallelujah close listen
[1:17:29] praise the Lord
[1:17:31] these elect
[1:17:34] brother Brandon says this as I am saying
[1:17:37] no he says but to go on now with this
[1:17:41] thought these elect were not only the
[1:17:45] Eternal thoughts of God which were to be
[1:17:48] expressed in flesh in their due season
[1:17:53] but these same elect are called by
[1:17:58] another name praise the Lord Romans 4
[1:18:03] 16. therefore it is a faith
[1:18:07] that it might be by Grace not by law
[1:18:12] to the end the promise might be sure to
[1:18:17] all this seed all the seed amen not that
[1:18:23] only which is of the law
[1:18:25] but to what also witches of the faith of
[1:18:29] Abraham
[1:18:31] who is the father of us all praise the
[1:18:36] Lord amen we are going to come to that
[1:18:39] in a moment Romans 9 7
[1:18:42] to 13. neither because they are the Seed
[1:18:45] of Abraham
[1:18:47] are they all the children
[1:18:51] just because you're a Seed of Abraham
[1:18:54] that doesn't mean you're an elect
[1:18:57] you see see because it was in Isaac that
[1:19:01] the seed was called
[1:19:03] in Isaac but what happened they were
[1:19:06] born of Abraham too but but they were
[1:19:09] not elect uh it's like us saying today
[1:19:11] they are part of the church there or
[1:19:13] they're Christian oh they're religious
[1:19:15] but no it's of the elect
[1:19:19] is that right this is according to
[1:19:22] Spirit not according to flesh even
[1:19:24] though your father may be a holy man
[1:19:25] even though your father might be an
[1:19:29] Abraham or your father could be this or
[1:19:32] Samuel or whoever matter of fact some of
[1:19:35] the preachers uh children were the worst
[1:19:40] Aaron's sons and daughters or you know
[1:19:43] different ones in the Bible sometimes
[1:19:45] they're they end up being the worst
[1:19:47] because it's got nothing to do with if I
[1:19:50] am Holy it means that my children will
[1:19:52] be holy and then you want to look dung
[1:19:55] on me because my children did this and
[1:19:57] your child did that what's my child got
[1:20:00] to do with me
[1:20:01] if you understand what what to do with
[1:20:04] me they're going to make their own
[1:20:05] decisions do their own life do whatever
[1:20:07] they want to do it's not me amen I'm
[1:20:09] going I teach them I give them the word
[1:20:11] and after they come to their time
[1:20:13] responsibility it's up to them what they
[1:20:15] do with it but I have the word within my
[1:20:18] heart I stand upon the word of God this
[1:20:21] is my election this is not by Dr Sparks
[1:20:24] training this is not my human psychology
[1:20:28] amen we do what we can do this is the
[1:20:31] traps and these are the prisons of the
[1:20:34] mind and of the soul that Satan took
[1:20:36] people in this message and put them into
[1:20:39] spiritual bondage
[1:20:40] parents taking the children and lock
[1:20:43] them up into religious cages where they
[1:20:46] can't do this they cannot do that they
[1:20:48] can't talk to this person they can't do
[1:20:51] that you know what God says no it's not
[1:20:54] like that right if they are the seed of
[1:20:58] God it does not commit sin it can't go
[1:21:01] beyond a certain point look before I was
[1:21:04] even as we say it uh repent born again
[1:21:08] or get called
[1:21:10] I I didn't know what was wrong with me
[1:21:13] and you could think the same thing of
[1:21:15] yourself I can go so far with certain
[1:21:18] things when I get to a certain point I
[1:21:20] use the term something would stop me
[1:21:24] I don't know what it is I couldn't help
[1:21:28] other boys can take up a bottle or take
[1:21:32] something dangerous and do something or
[1:21:35] chop somebody hit somebody's tab so I
[1:21:38] couldn't do it I couldn't go beyond a
[1:21:41] certain point and every one of us would
[1:21:44] have had God has your point where you
[1:21:46] how far you can go so far no further
[1:21:49] you're not going any further than this
[1:21:51] the woman at the well went so far he
[1:21:54] says oh yeah you had five boyfriends I
[1:21:57] know that you had five of them and five
[1:22:00] of them you know was uh you know were
[1:22:03] men that maybe were single but this one
[1:22:06] now is a married man and yeah I watched
[1:22:11] I seen all of that and and just
[1:22:13] permitted it if you want to put it that
[1:22:15] way but when it gets to this I got to
[1:22:17] put a red line here I gotta put a stop
[1:22:20] to it so far no further amen the one I
[1:22:24] have now is not your own it's somebody
[1:22:27] else's oh my she drank that water on the
[1:22:32] tree of life the River of Life and and
[1:22:35] that water fell upon the sea that was in
[1:22:37] our soul and that seed spent to life she
[1:22:41] recognize amen you are the word you are
[1:22:44] the Messiah you are the one that's
[1:22:46] supposed to come amen and ran back to
[1:22:50] her Village and begin to tell everybody
[1:22:52] what had happened in her soul oh blessed
[1:22:55] be the name of the Lord listen this is a
[1:22:58] pause here
[1:23:00] from the beginning
[1:23:03] to preach
[1:23:05] it's not really the goal is not really
[1:23:08] to build up a big huge Church
[1:23:13] if you want to say that I already had
[1:23:16] some of that on the mountain when there
[1:23:18] was over 500 on something people coming
[1:23:22] on the streets were clogged in cars and
[1:23:25] everything else and the eagle they took
[1:23:28] a picture of the of the church sign and
[1:23:31] there was the eagle sitting in a nest uh
[1:23:35] in the sign praise God hallelujah and
[1:23:39] the picture was not taken by us this is
[1:23:41] taken by the photographer that's
[1:23:42] supposed to do the sign who was there
[1:23:44] but praise the name of the Lord why was
[1:23:46] that it was God moving by his Spirit God
[1:23:52] accomplishing these things for his glory
[1:23:54] but the whole thing is like you uh put a
[1:23:58] pot to boil and you put some vegetables
[1:24:00] in it and and it's filled up to the top
[1:24:02] but when you turn you look back the
[1:24:05] thing is gone right now
[1:24:08] it's not that you lose anything or it's
[1:24:11] gotten less it's just God bringing it
[1:24:15] down to where he wants it
[1:24:18] for his glory for his honor and that is
[1:24:22] what has happened and is happening in
[1:24:25] the message is that right we are not
[1:24:28] here to develop you as Church chickens
[1:24:32] but we are not here to preach uh what
[1:24:37] you call in a farmer whatever's gospel
[1:24:41] or doctrine a little Peck here a little
[1:24:43] Peck there and a Peck Peck here and a
[1:24:45] Peck there no no no we are here to bring
[1:24:47] to you the fullness of the word of God
[1:24:50] that's what you want to do with it right
[1:24:54] we are not here to beat it in you we're
[1:24:56] not here to pound it into you we're not
[1:24:58] we're not here I understand now we're
[1:25:01] not here to persuade using Gifts of
[1:25:03] persuasion and conversion using uh the
[1:25:07] different things that they teach as I
[1:25:10] was taught to in the school ministerial
[1:25:13] schools how to make people feel so
[1:25:16] empathetic
[1:25:17] empathies and pull out emotions and do
[1:25:21] this and create that no we're not here
[1:25:23] for that because realize those are the
[1:25:26] works of men
[1:25:28] that is the science uh given in these
[1:25:33] various theological schools and that is
[1:25:36] not what God wants God wants us to teach
[1:25:39] the people the fullness of the word then
[1:25:41] out of the word he will do his own
[1:25:44] calling
[1:25:46] he will do his own calling his own
[1:25:49] convictions his own convincing you need
[1:25:52] to be baptized he will tell them
[1:25:55] come home to him he will tell you amen
[1:25:59] praise God so we're not here to owe to
[1:26:03] build up a great big Organization no we
[1:26:07] are here to build a body of Christ
[1:26:11] by Revelation not a body by Egypt
[1:26:15] religious education but my revelation of
[1:26:19] the word praise be to God hallelujah oh
[1:26:24] my glory to God hallelujah so God now
[1:26:30] therefore let me quote the scripture
[1:26:32] first therefore it is a faith that it
[1:26:34] might be by grace to the end The Promise
[1:26:37] by might be sure to all the seed I have
[1:26:42] not come here to save everybody but I
[1:26:44] come for the lost sheep
[1:26:47] right of the House of Israel the lost
[1:26:50] sheep that's what he really come for
[1:26:52] right praise the Lord now also witches
[1:26:56] of the faith of Abraham who is the
[1:26:58] father of us all
[1:27:01] father of us all let me use that term so
[1:27:04] you understand here now now God Elohim
[1:27:07] there wanting to express himself into
[1:27:10] flesh
[1:27:12] right Satan the cunning evil Wicked one
[1:27:16] when God spoke and God brought Adam here
[1:27:20] right away the devil won't Express
[1:27:23] himself in the flesh also you got me
[1:27:26] he's always a copycat
[1:27:28] so he wants to express himself also in
[1:27:31] the flesh But realize let's go back a
[1:27:34] little here that when God was going to
[1:27:38] express his sons and daughters and put
[1:27:40] them into flesh it means without Satan's
[1:27:46] insertion of himself into the human race
[1:27:50] the entire human race would have been
[1:27:53] Sons and Daughters of God
[1:27:55] there will only be one race on this
[1:27:58] Earth and they all would be sons and
[1:28:00] others of God but Satan through the
[1:28:04] process of the sin
[1:28:06] of him and Eve
[1:28:09] brought
[1:28:11] a a situation of
[1:28:15] a seed of discrepancy
[1:28:18] he brought the seed of discrepancy now
[1:28:21] now you have to wonder which human has
[1:28:24] the lexed in them or the germ or the
[1:28:26] gene of God and which one does not have
[1:28:30] it and you see it brought a confusion
[1:28:33] God is not the author of confusion no
[1:28:37] Satan is the artery of confusion and
[1:28:40] that's why he create that confusion
[1:28:42] right there now this scripture is
[1:28:45] referring to all of that by telling you
[1:28:47] now out of Abraham came what Ishmael and
[1:28:53] Isaac
[1:28:55] and righteous father righteous mother
[1:28:59] righteous parents amen I'm remembering
[1:29:03] another quote now where the prophets are
[1:29:05] yes and so from that Holy place yonda
[1:29:09] came but good and evil
[1:29:12] Satan come from there and Michael the
[1:29:14] angel comes from there praise God see
[1:29:17] it's not just saying oh it's a father
[1:29:20] holy mother a father is a bishop or
[1:29:23] whatever a preacher so the children are
[1:29:25] support no they have to be who they are
[1:29:29] by the grace of God we just pray for
[1:29:33] them we just help one another we pray
[1:29:35] for one another that's what we are here
[1:29:37] for amen praise the Lord no we see he
[1:29:41] created also flesh so that there is
[1:29:45] doubt now because you don't know really
[1:29:48] what you are dealing with amen praise
[1:29:52] God and so now even though all flesh
[1:29:55] maybe religious and may even say we are
[1:29:59] believing
[1:30:00] right the election is not by Behavior
[1:30:07] praise God it's not by works by faith
[1:30:12] by Revelation it's my election of whom
[1:30:16] God chooses I think I'm going to start
[1:30:18] even though you can be eating the
[1:30:22] richest meal but after a while you feel
[1:30:24] full
[1:30:25] you feel your hand enough for the day
[1:30:28] you can eat some more tomorrow
[1:30:30] is that right
[1:30:32] so uh
[1:30:34] quickly to sense that and realize that I
[1:30:38] know I have to bring this now to an end
[1:30:40] for today by the grace of God hallelujah
[1:30:43] so recognize friends that it's like that
[1:30:48] though they came out from this same
[1:30:51] mother and father
[1:30:54] because Satan created a confusion
[1:30:57] if that confusion or the first sin
[1:31:00] wasn't there the entire human race would
[1:31:03] have been seeds seeds Sons and Daughters
[1:31:06] of God is that right
[1:31:08] Satan that's the seed of discrepancy
[1:31:11] that is where he caused the discrepancy
[1:31:14] where there is no doubt you don't know
[1:31:16] we don't know whose son whose daughters
[1:31:18] of God and who's the devil who's of
[1:31:21] serpent seed or who is this or who's
[1:31:23] that right that's what that's why the
[1:31:25] word test becomes important now because
[1:31:28] one will respond to the word and one
[1:31:31] will hate the word even while it is
[1:31:35] behaving religiously and believing
[1:31:37] so-called even while it's behaving like
[1:31:39] that like the Pharisees and Sadducees
[1:31:41] examples are in the Bible there praise
[1:31:44] God that they will behave that way amen
[1:31:47] yes sir so
[1:31:49] um amen the Paul is telling us here in
[1:31:53] the word of God neither because they are
[1:31:56] the Seed of Abraham are they all the
[1:31:59] children of God
[1:32:02] no but in Isaac shall the seed be called
[1:32:06] what I'm preaching here realize that
[1:32:08] Paul understood this and that's why he
[1:32:11] he's preaching it here now uh whether
[1:32:13] those people understood back there I
[1:32:15] don't know brother Branham said that
[1:32:17] Paul was preached I preached what Paul
[1:32:19] preached he preached this this stuff
[1:32:22] already I'm preaching it here praise God
[1:32:24] and I'm preaching what the prophet
[1:32:26] preached he preached this stuff already
[1:32:28] it's just that we didn't understand we
[1:32:30] didn't get a revelation of it praise God
[1:32:33] hallelujah amen but in Isaac shall the
[1:32:36] seed be called
[1:32:38] that is there which are the children of
[1:32:42] the flesh
[1:32:43] are not the children of God
[1:32:47] but the children of the promise the
[1:32:50] children of the promise
[1:32:52] they are counted foreseen amen praise
[1:32:57] God hallelujah and so those are the
[1:33:01] election of God who feel the pull and
[1:33:04] recognize the word for their age that
[1:33:07] God begins to identify as a sons and his
[1:33:12] daughters his children for the age that
[1:33:15] we are living in now praise the Lord you
[1:33:19] you have to know when to stop and I'm
[1:33:21] going to stop now praise the Lord and
[1:33:24] God bless you don't just listen to these
[1:33:27] things and oh that was that was the all
[1:33:30] right sermon and you just walk no
[1:33:33] meditate on these things
[1:33:36] praise the Lord not because I am saying
[1:33:40] it
[1:33:40] but because the word not me the word
[1:33:44] that is going up that's the word you
[1:33:47] must regard and that's the word you must
[1:33:49] listen listen to it again and see what
[1:33:52] God will tell you
[1:33:54] because God's word is like as the
[1:33:57] prophet said it clearly it's like a
[1:33:58] diamond
[1:33:59] I'll see one facet of it the Brilliance
[1:34:03] of it come out and catch my attention
[1:34:06] but you may not see that I may be seeing
[1:34:09] blue and he's seeing pink
[1:34:12] right the next one is yellow but it's
[1:34:15] the same word of God it's what God is
[1:34:18] revealing to you and he wants you to
[1:34:20] know for the Bible tells us cleanly
[1:34:22] while the musicians are coming that how
[1:34:24] that um he leads his children and the
[1:34:27] Sheep into the pasture and he feeds the
[1:34:30] Sheep right he tells Peter feed my sheep
[1:34:33] right praise God but he knows exactly
[1:34:37] what portion each of one of us needs
[1:34:39] this morning
[1:34:41] that is why you will come to church and
[1:34:44] you may be speaking something in your
[1:34:45] car you might have prayed about it last
[1:34:47] night all of a sudden the preachers
[1:34:49] speak in it
[1:34:51] the man of God
[1:34:53] because the man of God didn't hear
[1:34:56] something maybe some of them do but I
[1:34:59] don't do that I cut off myself or from
[1:35:01] that long time ago you know just wait
[1:35:05] some God
[1:35:07] and he may not come to the pulpit
[1:35:09] knowing anything but once he starts
[1:35:11] speaking then the word goes out to meet
[1:35:14] the need that is in your heart
[1:35:17] which is a different thing that is in
[1:35:20] your heart or in that person's heart the
[1:35:23] word knows to do it just like on a day
[1:35:25] of Pentecost is that right
[1:35:27] while Peter yet spake
[1:35:30] these words
[1:35:32] he just spoke in the Hebrew language but
[1:35:35] all the rest of them were hearing him in
[1:35:37] their languages
[1:35:39] you are hearing the word as it feeds you
[1:35:43] and meets your condition
[1:35:46] your situation and gives you the answers
[1:35:50] that you seek and you need praise God
[1:35:53] aren't you glad you serve a God Like
[1:35:55] That
[1:36:02] let us just buy our heads for a brief
[1:36:04] movement as we talk to God the worship
[1:36:06] leader will will come and he will lead
[1:36:10] us in a few songs of worship Prophet
[1:36:12] said after the preaching it's good to
[1:36:14] sing and worship a little bit so that
[1:36:17] the word of God could sink them in your
[1:36:19] soul and you could Rejoice over the word
[1:36:21] that you heard Heavenly Father
[1:36:24] foreign
