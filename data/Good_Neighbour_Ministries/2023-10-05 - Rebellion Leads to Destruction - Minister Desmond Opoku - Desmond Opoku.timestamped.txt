[27:27] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for
[27:29] the glory of God Amen and amen
[27:33] Hallelujah
[27:35] we're gonna read the book of Samuel
[27:37] first Samuel
[27:40] chapter 8
[27:42] verse 4
[27:44] to 19.
[27:46] today is a day I don't think we're gonna
[27:49] jump
[27:51] begin a listing
[27:54] and take instruction from God
[27:57] because God always give us instruction
[28:01] when he's leading you
[28:07] then
[28:09] all the Elders of Israel gathered
[28:11] themselves together and came to Samuel
[28:14] unto Rama and said unto him behold thou
[28:18] are old
[28:20] and thy sense walk not in thy ways now
[28:24] make us a king to judge us like all the
[28:28] nations
[28:30] but the
[28:32] but the thing displeased someone
[28:36] and when they said
[28:39] and the things is free somewhere when
[28:43] they said
[28:44] give us a cane to judge us and some will
[28:47] play unto God and the Lord said unto
[28:50] someone hacking unto the voice of the
[28:53] people in in all
[28:56] that they say unto thee for they have
[29:00] not rejected thee but they have rejected
[29:04] me that I should not Reign Over them
[29:07] that's a big thing
[29:10] if you reject God
[29:13] you heading towards destruction
[29:15] Hallelujah
[29:22] the Lord said on December hacking unto
[29:25] the voice of the people
[29:27] because why they have they have not
[29:29] rejected but they rejected according to
[29:31] all the works
[29:33] which they have done since the day that
[29:36] I brought them up out of Egypt even onto
[29:40] this day well in day half forsaking me
[29:44] and serve other gods so the so do they
[29:49] also on today
[29:51] now therefore hacking onto their voice
[29:53] how did ye protest
[29:56] solemnly
[29:59] unto them and shield them the manner of
[30:03] the king that shall reign unto them and
[30:07] Samuel told the words of the Lord unto
[30:09] the people that asked him again
[30:12] and he said this will be the manner of
[30:15] the king that shall reign over you
[30:18] he will take your sons
[30:21] and appointed them
[30:23] for himself and also Charles and to be
[30:27] his husband
[30:29] and some shall run before his chariot
[30:34] you know before there was nothing like
[30:36] that now God telling them
[30:40] what are you asking what how the king
[30:43] gonna be
[30:45] Hallelujah
[30:47] and he will appointed him captains over
[30:50] thousands
[30:52] and captains
[30:53] over 50s
[30:55] I will set them in the two year
[30:59] his ground
[31:01] and to reap his habit and to make his
[31:05] instrument for war and instrument of his
[31:07] chariot
[31:09] and he shall Take Your Daughters to be
[31:13] confectionaries and to be cooks and to
[31:17] the Bakers and he will take your fails
[31:21] and your Vineyards and your oblivious
[31:24] even the best of them and give them to
[31:28] his servant
[31:29] and he would take the tenth of your seed
[31:33] and you are Vineyard and to give it to
[31:36] his offices
[31:37] and to his servant and he will take your
[31:41] men servant and you are made seven and
[31:46] you are goodest goodest
[31:49] young men and your asses and put them to
[31:52] his work he will take the tenth of your
[31:56] ship and you shall be in his servant and
[32:01] you shall cry on and you shall cry out
[32:04] in that day because you are King which
[32:08] you have
[32:09] chosen you
[32:12] and the Lord will not hear you in that
[32:15] day may the Lord had his Blessing
[32:19] to the reading of his way you may be
[32:20] seated
[32:24] you see
[32:25] when the children of God
[32:28] one God was leading them
[32:30] there was peace
[32:33] the amazed servant yet everything was
[32:35] for them
[32:39] Hallelujah
[32:41] praise God
[32:44] prophet Samuel was the mouthpiece of God
[32:47] that day
[32:49] he was God's spokesman in that day
[32:57] he was God's spokesman in that day
[33:01] he was the prophet
[33:04] that God gave it to them to lead them
[33:07] but why this happened
[33:10] because
[33:13] when God was leading them
[33:16] somewhere God make them so comfortable
[33:21] someone became common to them
[33:25] so when you are pastor
[33:27] or any leader that leading you
[33:30] don't let that person become common to
[33:33] them
[33:34] you know that God has ordained that
[33:36] person
[33:38] to lead you my subject here is
[33:41] rebellious leads to destruction
[33:45] rebellious leads to destruction
[33:50] the children of God
[33:52] Israelites they rebelled against God
[33:57] and God was further not one time
[34:01] you remember God said the same thing
[34:04] they did for me when I was taking them
[34:07] from Egypt
[34:08] to Canaan
[34:10] and I let them hear they think he
[34:12] doesn't know there is nothing here
[34:15] anything that he spoke to speak to your
[34:18] houses and everywhere God knows
[34:21] God has not changed because right now
[34:25] before God did that physically
[34:30] he talked to them physically through the
[34:33] prophet
[34:38] because
[34:39] everything that they do they sit in
[34:43] their tent and they mammal
[34:45] and God here I tell you seven this is
[34:49] what he's doing
[34:50] Brethren don't think
[34:53] anything that he talks to your Chambers
[34:56] God does not change
[34:58] he is the same yesterday today and
[35:02] forever
[35:03] he does no change
[35:06] if we want to be in heaven that we are
[35:11] going and we know we are going how many
[35:14] believe that they are going to heaven
[35:17] if you know you are going to heaven
[35:21] live right
[35:22] stay with the word of God
[35:25] and do things right
[35:27] because everything that you do it will
[35:30] come against you
[35:32] not only you affect the whole bride of
[35:37] Christ
[35:38] Hallelujah we thank God God has given us
[35:42] a pastors
[35:44] to lead us first God was leading them
[35:47] through the prophets
[35:50] our day God has brought a prophet
[35:57] and what happened
[35:58] he left us the word of God
[36:01] now the prophet is not here anymore
[36:06] by the Holy Ghost himself is here
[36:11] that's God himself is here
[36:14] you rebelled against God you're gonna
[36:18] face the consequence
[36:20] Hallelujah
[36:27] thank you Lord
[36:31] instead of them
[36:33] to listen to right now I'm coming to our
[36:36] way instead of the people to listen to
[36:39] their pastor
[36:41] or the man of God that is leading them
[36:47] they were looking to the other
[36:51] other minister apart from their Church
[36:54] Minister that God has ordained
[36:59] to lead them
[37:01] God always appoints somebody purposely
[37:06] for your own good in the church the
[37:09] local church that you are in it doesn't
[37:12] matter whether I say handsome
[37:15] tall
[37:16] doesn't know how to talk

[37:31] person because it's God man
[37:36] Hallelujah

[37:42] you
[37:43] because we human being chose human to

[38:34] trials and everything
[38:38] he they're gonna cry as much as they
[38:41] want they're gonna fix by themselves
[38:45] right now we cannot face anything by
[38:48] ourselves
[38:49] God is the one that leading
[38:51] and we have to follow
[38:55] the pastor

[39:39] the other side why the children in
[39:41] Israel said they need they need a pastor
[39:44] they need a king
[39:47] because they were not looking what they
[39:50] have they look outside beyond the camp
[39:55] they were not looking
[39:58] what they have let me tell you this
[40:00] church what what we have here
[40:03] you cannot get it anywhere other than
[40:06] where God has placed you
[40:10] no matter it doesn't matter what
[40:12] Minister that comes here to preach that
[40:16] person is not bigger than your pastor
[40:21] do not fall in trap
[40:25] and just look the other side
[40:28] you don't understand anything you gotta
[40:31] ask
[40:32] God has provided you
[40:36] a tools that you can need
[40:39] for your own good for your answer
[40:41] because you remember we are going home
[40:46] and we are going home together
[40:49] we don't want to leave no one behind

[41:05] loved ones your faith
[41:08] and your prayers

[41:18] and protect one another Hallelujah
[41:22] not that baby you go outside for
[41:24] fellowship and somebody sitting down
[41:27] there
[41:27] and yabbing against your pastor or your
[41:31] brother or your Deco and you sitting
[41:33] down there without defending that person
[41:35] your pastor that leading you and
[41:39] somebody's sitting down there and
[41:41] talking rubbish
[41:43] some years ago I remember brother Kofi
[41:46] went to one brother and he was bashing
[41:48] brother Pastor brother coffee never
[41:50] sprayed that he bashed that person I
[41:53] said I'm gonna tell the pastor
[41:55] that's where it's supposed to be
[41:57] you protect your pastor no matter what
[42:01] that man is no bigger than your pastor
[42:04] and he has no more wisdom than your
[42:07] pastor that God has given you to lead
[42:10] you
[42:11] I have a strange message today
[42:14] thank you Lord I don't know but I
[42:17] believe God has given me this
[42:20] Hallelujah I told you today I'm not
[42:22] gonna let I'm not gonna let you jump up
[42:25] and down
[42:27] it's something because me I have a hard
[42:30] time to bring this message but I believe
[42:32] God is preparing us the place where we
[42:36] are going we will never
[42:37] we've never been there before
[42:40] so God is preparing you right now
[42:44] Hallelujah
[42:46] when the children of Israel they thought
[42:48] the Lord told them you are going to the
[42:49] their promise that they've never been
[42:51] there before
[42:52] tomorrow do you know what will happen
[42:54] tomorrow how many people know is that
[42:57] nobody don't know we are going by what
[43:00] faith by what God
[43:03] amen have you ever been to the the
[43:06] darkness very dark pitch
[43:09] that when you raise your hand like this
[43:11] you can't even see your hand how many
[43:14] have I ever experienced that before
[43:16] okay
[43:18] that pitch this world here is so I get
[43:22] it so dark
[43:24] get it so dark very dark so God has
[43:29] given us a ball of light
[43:33] and that ball of light your pastor is
[43:36] the one who hold that ball of light
[43:39] in that peace there
[43:42] so we all follow him
[43:45] as a you know like a a like a sheep they
[43:51] all follow what the shepherd
[43:54] they all follow the shepherd
[43:57] you understand so that Pastor hold that
[44:00] ball of blood that pillow fire
[44:03] he's holding like that because God has
[44:06] ordered him to lead us
[44:08] so he is the one bringing us
[44:11] you remember brabham said every minister
[44:14] is going to present his congregation
[44:18] before God
[44:19] so every God or damn Minister won his
[44:24] bride
[44:25] to be perfect
[44:28] no blemish
[44:31] so he gonna reach a time God gonna
[44:34] chastise you
[44:37] and sometimes when this thing happen the
[44:39] people stood there and said
[44:44] this is a man this is not God
[44:48] but let me tell you God will never pass
[44:51] your pastor to anyone to speak to you
[44:53] God will use your pastor
[44:56] to speak to you
[44:58] and if you don't listen you be care you
[45:01] become the same thing rebellious like
[45:04] the children of God when they repair
[45:07] when they rebelled there was a price to
[45:09] pay
[45:12] if you don't understand anything it's
[45:15] like if I hurt you
[45:18] and you're done you don't tell me
[45:21] how would I know
[45:23] if you don't understand anything
[45:25] ask
[45:28] ask
[45:29] God knows all the answer
[45:33] and even if you go to your pastor maybe
[45:37] sometimes he tells you wait he has to
[45:40] ask
[45:41] from God
[45:43] and God will give that Pastor answer
[45:47] to you
[45:48] do not rush
[45:51] patience
[45:53] patience
[45:55] brings
[45:57] Joy
[45:58] he brings answer he brings peace
[46:03] Hallelujah
[46:08] when God gave you a pastor he knew all
[46:13] your needs be before he release him
[46:19] to lead you
[46:22] all the churches are not the same
[46:27] don't think you're gonna compare your
[46:29] church to other church over there
[46:33] I eat Fufu Brothers
[46:35] every day he eat pasta
[46:39] that Pastor is have he has a way of
[46:43] leading his people
[46:45] you cannot compare your pastor
[46:48] to other Church
[46:50] very very important
[46:53] brother Brown said even if you think
[46:57] your pastor is wrong and your heart is
[47:00] pure God will tell your pastor like this
[47:04] and come back in life because you are
[47:08] God people you are God children
[47:12] Hallelujah you are God children
[47:18] your pastor has a different gift
[47:21] that God lead him because he knows your
[47:24] needs
[47:25] so stay Hallelujah
[47:31] your pastor is unique
[47:35] your pastor is unique
[47:39] God give good things to his children
[47:42] always give good things the best thing
[47:45] for your children because we are the
[47:48] bride of Christ if you are the white you
[47:51] think that I will give anything that is
[47:55] not good to my wife
[47:57] no I will always give her the best
[48:01] because it's me she represents me
[48:04] he she refresh me
[48:08] so I want her to be good refraction
[48:12] the same thing applies to God
[48:17] the same thing I pray to God God knows
[48:20] that you are his bride so when he gave
[48:23] you a pastor
[48:25] stay with him it doesn't matter whatever
[48:28] you think about him
[48:32] don't let that man become common to you
[48:36] very very important
[48:38] Hallelujah
[48:41] as I said he is the mouthpiece of God
[48:45] Hallelujah
[48:50] he is God man
[48:54] he's God man
[48:58] you can say because some time ago
[49:00] somebody told me oh he's a man that
[49:03] can't see me
[49:04] what's that mean that person he lost
[49:06] confidence in your pastor you cannot get
[49:08] nothing from your pastor
[49:11] you cannot get nothing from your pastor
[49:13] because you regret him
[49:16] very very important
[49:19] very very important
[49:22] let me tell you
[49:25] your pastor is your spiritual father
[49:29] your pastor is your spiritual father
[49:32] remember even all this
[49:35] there is to use
[49:38] even
[49:39] six seven years old boy to be a king
[49:43] if you read the Bible you know
[49:47] 12 20 years old he became a king
[49:50] and all the air the the the the the the
[49:54] the area that they have to subject
[49:58] everything to him
[50:00] the king speak when that that King speak
[50:04] you cannot say oh I'm older than him it
[50:07] cannot work
[50:10] and God will never give you
[50:15] more Revelation than your pastor
[50:19] God will never give you more Revelation
[50:23] than your pastor
[50:25] so you have to think
[50:28] who you are your degree
[50:32] your highest your money whatever you are
[50:36] you have to subject unto God
[50:39] if you're subject unto God you'll be

[51:02] and to and you are here to help you to
[51:05] the journey that God has set before you

[51:27] is God in the man
[51:30] it's a God man
[51:33] Hallelujah
[51:34] now no prophet
[51:37] now God man is leading you to the
[51:40] Rapture because we are not expecting any
[51:43] more prophet in these days
[51:45] so don't think somebody is coming to
[51:48] lead you other than your pastor
[51:49] Hallelujah stay strong

[52:08] standing here but inside of him and when
[52:11] you speak is God speaking through that
[52:14] person
[52:15] Hallelujah don't think that he is a man
[52:20] and sometimes one one
[52:26] people you correct them
[52:29] they don't want correction human being
[52:31] is tough
[52:33] to correct human being
[52:37] Hallelujah

[52:45] that man is is God man
[52:49] Hallelujah leading you and guiding to
[52:52] your destination
[52:53] if you disobey him you are destined for
[52:58] destruction

[53:01] the ball in the pink Darkness right now
[53:04] in the big black says in the world
[53:06] the world is changing
[53:08] if that can give that congregation that
[53:11] followed that Pastor in that preach time
[53:14] there
[53:15] I will leave behind as soon as the when
[53:18] that pitch light they go from here to
[53:21] there you cannot find your way you
[53:23] cannot see nothing what happened you
[53:26] head into a destruction
[53:29] to always try as much as you can to
[53:34] follow the man who has that ball of

[54:29] what happened to him God gave him a
[54:32] chance and he told him
[54:34] because of his propriety and the sin

[1:00:23] Hallelujah
[1:00:26] it's not this just you come here to
[1:00:29] minister here

[1:00:33] are special you are not special nobody
[1:00:36] is special we are all special
[1:00:39] Hallelujah in the eyes of God we are
[1:00:42] honest we are all special about God has
[1:00:46] ordained people
[1:00:48] to help him to do the work to lead the
[1:00:51] children
[1:00:53] to put them in line
[1:00:55] so that nobody can go here nobody gonna
[1:00:57] go look
[1:00:59] eating a pastor love to chastise
[1:01:03] somebody
[1:01:05] um a shepherd
[1:01:09] the Sheep gets rebellious
[1:01:13] and he doesn't want to flow through the
[1:01:17] shepherd
[1:01:18] the shepherd has to take the sheep and
[1:01:21] break the leg you think when the
[1:01:23] shepherd is breaking he feels the same
[1:01:25] pain that the Sheep
[1:01:28] pain that the Sheep is peeling
[1:01:31] but
[1:01:32] she has to do it
[1:01:35] for what to save the Sheep otherwise the
[1:01:39] wolf gonna get that ship there
[1:01:42] how are you gonna be lost
[1:01:45] it's the same thing that applies to us
[1:01:49] we are safe to be led
[1:01:51] if you if you listen to the the message
[1:01:54] leadership
[1:01:56] he talked about that
[1:02:00] you you ha your mother lead you and then
[1:02:04] then after that you you go up and you go
[1:02:07] to school your teacher lead you and when
[1:02:09] you finish you come back and then your
[1:02:11] father lead you and honey get it then
[1:02:14] the same thing always we have to be lead
[1:02:18] somebody has to be taking care of you
[1:02:22] so when your pastor chastise you you
[1:02:26] have to listen
[1:02:28] because I see
[1:02:29] some years ago because you don't you
[1:02:33] don't expect that whatever your past
[1:02:35] somebody the other Church Pastor is
[1:02:38] doing you're gonna that your pastor is
[1:02:40] gonna do the same thing no God give each
[1:02:43] Pastor his own revelation
[1:02:46] how to lead this because he knows your
[1:02:48] needs
[1:02:49] so you know how to move you around
[1:02:52] and protect you and put you around it
[1:02:55] like this
[1:02:58] so I was a deacon and then then every
[1:03:02] Decor has a part years ago some years
[1:03:05] back years ago and then and then
[1:03:08] he used to have a basket to give the
[1:03:12] congregation who was and then then this
[1:03:16] brother just went there he asked his
[1:03:18] children he said his people uh what
