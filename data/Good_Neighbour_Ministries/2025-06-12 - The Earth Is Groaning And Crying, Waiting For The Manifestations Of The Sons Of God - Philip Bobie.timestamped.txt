[8:33] path. Lord, your word is transformative,
[8:35] Lord. It's not just for information, but
[8:36] it's to get us to transform. And that's
[8:39] why we're here tonight, Lord, to be
[8:40] transformed by the renewing of our
[8:42] minds, God. How we desire, oh, Lord, to
[8:45] hear from you tonight, Father. It's our
[8:47] it's our walk with you, Lord. That is
[8:50] all that matters, Father. It's an
[8:52] individual thing, Lord. So each and
[8:53] every one of us come, Lord, to hear from
[8:55] you, Lord Jesus. May you come tonight,
[8:58] Lord Jesus. May you come and speak with
[9:00] us, speak to us in a special way

[9:14] chains of of sickness and chains of
[9:17] financial stress and different chains

[14:13] you can be sit down BraI is doing very
[14:16] well today by the grace of God he was
[14:19] able to come and watch my son Joseph run
[14:22] at the wellland secondary school there
[14:25] so he came with Mary and I was very
[14:27] happy to see them
[14:32] they didn't walk all the way there but
[14:34] they drove and then you walk and sit
[14:36] down and then watch the game so Thank
[14:38] God for that.
[14:41] How many enjoy the word on last Sunday?
[14:44] The word came forth so much in power and
[14:47] demonstration of the Holy Ghost. One
[14:50] brother sent me a test that he's still
[14:51] feeding on it and I'm still feeding on
[14:54] that word to such a blessing and a
[14:57] tremendous presence in the house of the
[14:59] Lord. Um let's I pastor Daniel send his
[15:04] greetings and God willing when going
[15:06] when I see him on s on Sunday. You're
[15:08] going to be preaching on next Sunday. So
[15:10] let's bow our heads and pray. Oh our
[15:14] gracious eternal God. You are the true
[15:18] living God. Before you there is no any
[15:22] other god formed. Neither will there be
[15:24] any other god formed. You are one God
[15:29] and your name is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[15:32] Lord during the day we might have passed
[15:35] through so many places. Some of us at
[15:38] work and everything that goes on the
[15:41] prophet said that he backslide thousand
[15:44] times a day because of thoughts that
[15:46] sometimes pass pass through his mind.
[15:49] And father we ask him for forgiveness of
[15:51] our unbelief. If you have any offense,
[15:55] even any thought that has passed on like
[15:57] you, renounce it, reject it, and you
[16:00] accept the mind of Christ, knowing that
[16:02] the spirit of God forgive us and wash us
[16:05] from all uncleanness because you died on
[16:08] Calvary and gave us victory over the
[16:10] enemy. Father, may you come once more.
[16:13] Take me aside. Help me, Father, that I
[16:16] could get myself away so that you can
[16:19] speak to the needs of your children.
[16:20] Father, they have come from work, some
[16:23] tithe and everything by faith. They are
[16:25] here, Lord. They're not here to see me.
[16:27] They want to hear from you. Won't you
[16:30] come once more, Lord Jesus Christ, and
[16:33] speak to their needs and come against
[16:35] any contrary spirit. May the true Holy
[16:38] Ghost have primance and flow through,
[16:41] Lord, and bless your children. Amen.
[16:45] Okay. Sorry for keeping you standing. I
[16:50] just have a a lengthy scriptures but I'm
[16:52] going to cut it off read only one and
[16:55] then the rest. So
[16:58] it's a Bible studies. So I hope you
[17:01] don't mind reading a lot of scriptures.
[17:04] Okay. Our first scripture will be Romans
[17:06] chapter 18
[17:08] verse 17- 28.
[17:20] I think I'd like to have the scripture
[17:21] myself.
[17:25] Okay.
[17:27] Okay. Romans 88 verse 17-28.
[17:32] And if children then hes of God and
[17:37] joined hers with Christ, if so be that
[17:40] we suffer with him, that we may be also
[17:44] glorified together. For I reckon that
[17:47] the sufferings of this present tense,
[17:51] present time, are not worthy to be
[17:53] compared with the glory which shall be
[17:56] revealed in us. For the earnest
[17:59] expectation of the creature waited for
[18:01] the manifestation
[18:03] of the sons of God. That going to be my
[18:07] topic here. The earnest expectation of
[18:10] creature waited for the manifestation of
[18:12] the sons of God. For the creature was
[18:14] made subject to vanity, not willing, but
[18:19] by reason of him who has subject the
[18:22] same in hope. Because the creature
[18:25] itself
[18:27] also shall be delivered from bondage
[18:32] of corruption into the glorious liberty
[18:34] of the children of God.
[18:36] For we know that the whole creation what
[18:39] grown
[18:41] and travailed in pain together until
[18:45] now. And not only they, but ourselves,
[18:49] also which have the first fruit of the
[18:51] spirit, even we ourselves
[18:54] grown within ourselves, waiting for the
[18:57] adoption
[18:59] to wait the redemption of our body.
[19:03] For we are saved by hope, but if but
[19:06] hope that is sin is not hope. For what a
[19:10] man seeth, why do ye hope for?
[19:15] Likewise, the spirit also help our
[19:17] infirmities. For we know not what we
[19:20] should pray, for as we ought, but the
[19:22] spirit itself make intercession for us
[19:25] with groaning
[19:27] which cannot be altered. Verse 27, and
[19:31] he that searched the heart knoweth what
[19:34] is the mind of the spirit, because he
[19:38] maketh intercession for the sins
[19:40] according to the will of God. And we
[19:44] know that all things work together for
[19:47] good to them that love God. And I'm just
[19:49] going to read one more scripture here.
[19:51] Luke 12:32.
[19:54] Fear not little flock, for it is your
[19:57] father's good pleasure to give you the
[19:59] kingdom. Please Jesus bless the reading
[20:02] of your word in Jesus name. Amen. Please
[20:05] be seated.
[20:10] Praise God. Hallelujah.
[20:13] So um if I'll titled it, I think my
[20:17] title is um
[20:20] the earth is groaning and crying waiting
[20:22] for the manifestations of the sons of
[20:25] God. Okay, it all comes back to
[20:28] redemption and I I can't get away from
[20:31] that. It's been so open to me when like
[20:35] one word opens always everywhere. It
[20:38] comes back to redemption.
[20:40] So um
[20:45] okay in Genesis 1 26
[20:50] when God made man he made him a god
[20:54] because he gave him dominion and he had
[20:58] rulership
[20:59] he had power over the best grace you can
[21:03] put it on um I think it's
[21:06] Messiah's paragraph 47
[21:09] he had power over the birds of the air,
[21:12] the cattle, over the winds, the waves,
[21:15] the fishes of the sea, the everything.
[21:18] He had dominion over everything. He was
[21:21] a ruler, anointed, a ruler because he
[21:25] had dominion over everything.
[21:28] He was a ruler anointed because he was
[21:31] in the likeness and in the image of God
[21:35] with an earthly dominion. That's why the
[21:38] Bible says that earth is growing in
[21:42] crying, waiting for the manifestations
[21:46] of the sons of God. The world is waiting
[21:49] for the man to come back into his right
[21:53] estate. In other words, Adam had
[21:57] dominion and power over everything in
[22:01] the garden.
[22:03] And because of what happened in the
[22:06] Garden of Eden, he lost that dominion.
[22:09] And not only him, we all because we were
[22:12] in him, we also lost that dominion. And
[22:15] even the trees, the animals, they did
[22:18] not make commit anything. But because
[22:22] Adam was God an amateur God over all
[22:27] those things when he fall it all bring
[22:31] them into this. So the Bible said the
[22:34] whole creation is was waiting and crying
[22:38] for the manifestations of the sons of
[22:42] God and sons and daughters because
[22:44] they're waiting for all of us to go back
[22:47] and God being God when that sin happened
[22:54] it kind of separate man from God and
[23:00] because if you check the Bible Ible said
[23:03] Adam knew what he was doing. But the
[23:06] love that Adam have for Eve, he also
[23:09] deposit his seed to win Eve because he
[23:11] know that he's part of God and God
[23:13] cannot destroy him. So is God also the
[23:18] love of God that flow through him. He
[23:20] also came to partake our sins so that he
[23:23] can bring us back to himself. So when
[23:29] that thing happened,
[23:33] there has to be a way to bring us back.
[23:36] And as we said already, the cried went
[23:38] out, there was no one worthy. Only the
[23:42] lamb of God was worthy. And what is
[23:45] happening is that he died
[23:48] only to redeem his predestinated
[23:52] children. He didn't die for the whole
[23:55] world. It seems like he died for the
[23:57] whole world but his death
[24:00] because the Bible said that the lamb was
[24:03] slain before the foundation of the
[24:06] world. So he said everyone whose name is
[24:09] not written in the lamb's book of life
[24:11] before the foundation of the world will
[24:13] be deceived by the antichrist.
[24:16] So that death, that cry that went out
[24:18] when God had to make to redeem man, to
[24:24] bring man to himself so that you can
[24:27] manifest all that Adam was manifesting.
[24:32] First, there has to be a way out to
[24:34] bring his children back to that stage.
[24:37] The only way he was going to do that was
[24:41] what? through revelation revealing
[24:44] himself to his sons and daughters and as
[24:47] you said I said little flock it is your
[24:50] father's pleasure to give you the
[24:52] kingdom so it's not many it's not for
[24:57] many people because the Bible said that
[25:00] the children of the b woman are more
[25:03] than that of the married woman so we
[25:07] have a lot that are not God's children
[25:10] and the god's children are very few in
[25:13] numbers and God always deal with
[25:17] minority. He is looking for one person
[25:20] who is what of a willing heart who that
[25:24] is a part of him that he can reveal
[25:26] himself to.
[25:35] So when it started in the garden of
[25:37] Eden,
[25:39] he chose
[25:41] to reveal himself
[25:44] to
[25:46] he chose to reveal himself to Abel and
[25:49] Bible said that by faith Abel offered an
[25:53] excellent sacrifice and God testify of
[25:57] his gift which is by revelation. That's
[26:00] the way God has been dealing with his
[26:02] children. So God revealed himself to
[26:06] Abel and because God revealed himself to
[26:10] him was able to what give an excellent
[26:13] sacrifice and that that's is what the
[26:17] what do we call it like the
[26:22] like the what word we have to like that
[26:26] became the standard
[26:29] for everyone that has to do or come to
[26:33] thought it has to be by revelation not
[26:35] by works of righteousness. It's not
[26:38] anything that Abel has done but God he
[26:42] found grace in the eyes of God and God
[26:45] reveal himself to him because he was
[26:48] part of God. He was attribute of God
[26:51] means that he was a thought of God and
[26:54] being a thought of God. God revealed
[26:57] himself to him for him to know what
[27:00] caused the fall of man. And if you
[27:02] remember when that fall came, he made a
[27:06] promise that the woman's seed will what?
[27:09] Bruise the head of a serpent seed. That
[27:12] means that the coming of Messiah to die
[27:15] to destroy the work of the devil to
[27:17] bring us back to himself. And it has
[27:21] always been a revelation and it has
[27:24] never been a majority.
[27:28] is always a small member of people. And
[27:33] if you read the Bible in Genesis, it
[27:36] says that Noah
[27:39] found grace in the eyes of God. And
[27:43] because he found grace in the eyes of
[27:45] God in the middle of perverted world out
[27:49] of millions at that time, it was only
[27:52] Noah and his children. And the Bible
[27:56] said as it was in the days of Noah, they
[28:00] build it, they they were given a
[28:03] marriage like common law marriages, they
[28:06] drink, they do everything.
[28:09] And when Noah went the ark, he destroyed
[28:12] all of them. So is you and me today.
[28:18] You and I have found grace in the eyes
[28:22] of God that at this very time when the
[28:27] everything that happened in the time of
[28:28] Noah and Sodom and Gomorrah is repeating
[28:32] itself, God by his amazing grace by his
[28:36] elected seed has called you by you have
[28:39] found grace in the eyes of God so that
[28:42] you can receive his word for today. It's
[28:47] not because you are better than anyone
[28:50] else but you find grace in the sight of
[28:53] God and it's not by anything by a
[28:57] sovereign grace. God is a sovereign and
[29:00] he said I have chose you. I have elected
[29:02] you. I'm revealing myself to you. No one
[29:05] can question God. There might be some
[29:08] people who think or seems to be more
[29:11] better than you, but God bypassed all of
[29:14] them and he came purposely to you to
[29:17] elect and what chose you to be part of
[29:21] him. And in the midst of our generation,
[29:27] that exact thing that happened in sodomy
[29:38] is repeating itself again.
[29:42] You have found grace in the sight of
[29:44] God. And being like Abrahamic seed, God
[29:49] revealed to Abraham everything that was
[29:51] happening in the camp of Sodom to him.
[29:55] But the people in Sodom didn't know what
[29:58] was coming. And by his grace God has
[30:01] sent us a vindicated prophet William
[30:03] Myron Abraham and has
[30:06] uh prophesied and revealed a lot of us
[30:09] to. So when we pick up this Bible, we
[30:12] pick up the message to read that we are
[30:15] not going for the letter part. That's
[30:17] what the letter killer but the spirit
[30:19] giveth life. So because you are part of
[30:21] God when you pick it up, he reveal
[30:25] himself to you without even the book. He
[30:28] comes and deal with your heart and
[30:30] reveal and put things in your heart and
[30:32] let you know discern things to know what
[30:35] is going on because you are part of him.
[30:39] It's effortlessly. You didn't fight for
[30:42] that but by grace you found grace in the
[30:46] eyes in the sight of God and God chose
[30:50] you to be part of his word. So it has
[30:56] always been a minority
[31:00] and God never deal with many in every
[31:05] age. It has always been a minority.
[31:09] Amen. And
[31:12] hallelujah.
[31:14] If
[31:15] the Bible said that Abraham
[31:19] was called out as from his what? His
[31:22] kindred and his people and walk with
[31:27] God.
[31:28] So is you and me. God call us out. Some
[31:33] from denominations, some from uh the
[31:36] world, some hasn't even some were
[31:39] atheists, some were cocaine addicts,
[31:42] some were drunkers, some were all this.
[31:44] God callth us from all those things and
[31:47] what and reveal himself to us the same
[31:50] because we are a royal seed of Abraham
[31:55] and God made a promise to Abraham.
[31:58] Amen. If you read Isaiah
[32:01] chapter
[32:03] 14
[32:05] verse
[32:09] Isaiah 14
[32:12] verse 24 and 27
[32:15] said the Lord of hosts hath sworn saying
[32:19] surely as have thought so shall it come
[32:24] to pass and have purpose so shall it
[32:29] stand for the Lord of hosts had purpose
[32:32] and who shall disanol it and his hand is
[32:36] stretched out and who shall turn it
[32:38] back. So God is a sovereign God. Amen.
[32:42] And when he made a promise, he made a
[32:46] vow or when he swear because there's no
[32:49] one greater than him. He swore by
[32:51] himself and he gave Abraham a promise
[32:54] that your descendants will s to another
[32:58] country and they will be there for 400
[33:01] years. After 400 years, I'll bring them
[33:04] out with a mighty head. Because God
[33:07] swore by himself and spoke that that
[33:10] word has to come to pass. Amen. And when
[33:14] the time came for that that thing to
[33:17] come to pass,
[33:19] Bra explained that Moses was ready but
[33:23] the people were not ready. And because
[33:26] they were not ready, it cost them
[33:28] another 30 years. Yes. And I'm afraid
[33:31] that the rapture should have taken place
[33:33] long time. But because some of us are
[33:36] not ready to go all the way out as our
[33:40] pastor said on our former pastor said
[33:43] last Sunday, let's look for those who
[33:45] are vaccinating around us. Let's go for
[33:48] the lost souls. There's a work for you
[33:50] and I to do I know God's a sovereign
[33:53] God. When he's ready, he can just move
[33:56] and let everything happen. But still,
[33:59] you are part of him. So we have to be
[34:03] obedient to the word of God and be ready
[34:05] so that he can use us the way he wants
[34:08] to use us so that nothing will be a
[34:11] hindrance. Because remember as I've
[34:13] always been saying if
[34:16] you do not do it he said I'm able to
[34:21] raise souls to the father Abraham to
[34:24] worship me. So God if you refuse is
[34:27] going to use he has so many tools to
[34:30] use. So we got to be ready. We got to do
[34:33] what we got to do because if we don't do
[34:37] it, he we need him more than he need us.
[34:42] And your unbelief cannot what? Stop God.
[34:47] And whatever God has purpose to come to
[34:49] pass, it will come to pass. One time the
[34:53] the high priest Zachariah,
[34:57] he doubted God's word.
[35:00] But his doubt and his unbelief did not
[35:02] stop God from bringing John the Baptist
[35:05] through his loins.
[35:07] Whatever God has purposed in his heart,
[35:09] it will come to pass. So you better be
[35:12] on board.
[35:14] If you refuse to be on board, you are
[35:16] the one that going to suffer. Amen. So
[35:20] back to what I'm saying, when God gave
[35:23] that promise, in that promise was Moses
[35:27] name hiding. But he never talked about
[35:29] Moses that Moses is the one going to do
[35:31] it. But him being the sovereign God. He
[35:34] knew that Moses the one who was going to
[35:36] what? Fulfilled and do that. And Moses
[35:39] have favor in the sight of God. And
[35:42] Moses was the vessel that God used to
[35:46] bring them back. Bible said that he
[35:49] forsook the pleasures of Egypt for a
[35:52] season
[35:53] and work with what? Lost despised few.
[35:58] Pharaoh was looking through the same
[36:00] window he was seeing slaves.
[36:04] But Moses the same window he was seeing
[36:08] God's promised children. It depends on
[36:10] what window you are looking it through.
[36:13] Where you are looking it through. That's
[36:16] what you get. What you expect
[36:20] even here tonight. If you expect God to
[36:23] speak to your heart, he will turn my
[36:25] mouth to say something to help you. But
[36:28] if you don't expect, you come, you go
[36:30] for nothing. You'll get nothing because
[36:33] you are not expecting to hear to receive
[36:34] from God. So you get what you expect. So
[36:38] you got to give me your undivided
[36:40] attention and let God speak and you pray
[36:44] that God will what? Use me to say
[36:46] something unconsciously to bless you.
[36:50] Amen. That's what we are here for. You
[36:52] are here not to see one another. You are
[36:55] here to hear from the Lord Jesus Christ.
[36:58] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[37:01] forever.
[37:02] Hallelujah.
[37:04] So
[37:07] Moses
[37:09] was the one that God chose to lead the
[37:12] children of Israel. And it was a one man
[37:17] uh one man
[37:19] one man message. God chose Moses as a
[37:23] prophet.
[37:25] And because someone like Kora in their
[37:29] time, the Lord allow him to let his
[37:33] spirit 70 people to go on them. They
[37:36] think they know more than Moses and God
[37:39] destroyed all of them. Is that right? So
[37:42] is
[37:44] God sent us a vindicated prophet brother
[37:47] William Myron Branham and he type
[37:50] himself as Moses. And what did Moses did
[37:54] when Moses were coming out
[37:58] from Israel from Egypt back to Palestine
[38:03] the Bible said there were multitude.
[38:07] There were two million people
[38:10] and remember they all passed through the
[38:12] Red Sea. They received the baptism of
[38:13] the Holy Ghost. They saw um they saw the
[38:18] pillar of fire. They saw the pillar of
[38:20] cloud. They ate mana. They drink from uh
[38:25] from the rock. They have all these
[38:28] miracles following them. Yet their heart
[38:33] was not right with God. And God
[38:35] destroyed all of them except Joshua and
[38:38] Caleb. Because Joshua and Caleb were of
[38:41] what? Of a different spirit.
[38:44] So is the message. This prophet that God
[38:49] sent, his message has caught up a lot of
[38:53] people in the next so-called message
[38:55] believers. We have maybe millions of
[38:58] them now. Five, I don't know how many
[39:00] people. But the bride is coming out from
[39:05] the message. It's not everybody in the
[39:09] message church is a bride. But all are
[39:12] called like the children of Moses. The
[39:15] children of Israel were called. Many are
[39:18] called but few are chosen. Amen. So as
[39:21] it was in the time of Moses,
[39:25] there were 2 million
[39:27] but it was only Joshua and Caleb who
[39:31] have faith who stood by what the prophet
[39:34] said by revelation not just by the
[39:36] letter because God revealed to Joshua
[39:39] and Caleb
[39:41] and they have confidence
[39:44] in the word of God revelated part of it
[39:49] that God revealed through Moses to them
[39:52] and when as we read from the scripture
[39:56] they said hope that is seen is not hope.
[40:00] It was revealed to them that God that
[40:05] delivered them from Egypt with mighty
[40:09] words.
[40:10] And even the last sign was a talking.
[40:14] And if I see the blood, I'll pass over
[40:17] you. And all the firstborn were killed.
[40:20] And they saw all those miracles. And
[40:23] they have confidence. They believe God.
[40:26] They have faith in their God. So when
[40:29] they went to spy the land and they saw
[40:33] the people were giant they didn't look
[40:36] at the giants of the people they look to
[40:38] the promise of God so is you and me no
[40:43] matter what giant you facing no matter
[40:46] what is in your life you got to look to
[40:49] the promise of God because God said I
[40:52] have purpose of myself amen have purpose
[40:56] and who shall disan anoint
[40:58] and his son is stretched out and who
[41:01] shall turn it back. Hey, I have taught
[41:04] and it shall come to pass. So whatever
[41:08] God has spoken in this word here, it
[41:10] will come to pass. So we have to believe
[41:14] with all our heart, with all our mind,
[41:17] with all our soul and stand by the word
[41:20] of God because in every age the true
[41:23] sons and daughters of God, they believe
[41:26] this word with full revelation.
[41:29] Amen. God reveal it to them and they
[41:33] stand by that. And Joshua and Caleb,
[41:36] they were of a different spirit and they
[41:39] stood by it. And that same God is here
[41:43] tonight.
[41:45] What I'm trying to say is that I'm not
[41:48] trying to scare anybody
[41:50] because the prophet said that you have
[41:55] to believe that if it's only one person
[41:58] in the whole Ontario going, I believe
[42:01] it's me. You got to believe it's you.
[42:04] Because that same God that has called
[42:06] you, that has revealed himself to you
[42:08] for all these years, here a little,
[42:11] there a little, prism upon precept, if
[42:14] you have that confidence and believe
[42:17] that all this is God, then that same God
[42:21] will take you home. So we have to
[42:24] believe that for yourself
[42:27] that if there's only one person, you and
[42:30] that individual and stand by that word
[42:33] of God. Amen. And act on the word of God
[42:36] as our former pastor encouraged us last
[42:38] Sunday. Let's act on the word of God.
[42:40] Let's pick our sword and cut out all
[42:43] those Amalachites.
[42:45] Can't chop the head off with the word of
[42:47] God. Because Jesus Christ is the same
[42:50] yesterday, today, and forever. Because
[42:54] God has never been in a majority.
[42:57] Is always minority.
[43:01] Amen. Praise God. And someone like um
[43:06] Gideon in Judges
[43:10] chapter 6 verse 15- 16.
[43:15] And he said unto me,
[43:18] "Oh my Lord,
[43:20] where shall I save Israel?
[43:24] Behold, my family is poor in Manasseh.
[43:29] I am the least in my father's house. And
[43:33] the Lord said unto him, surely I'll be
[43:37] with thee, and thou shalt smite the
[43:40] median's house as one man. Amen. And
[43:44] when he get to a place,
[43:48] Lord said unto Gideon, "The people that
[43:51] are with thee are too many for me to
[43:53] give medianites onto their hands, lest
[43:57] Israel
[43:59] will vouch themselves against me,
[44:04] saying, "My own hand has saved me." In
[44:08] other words, God doesn't want us to
[44:11] boast of our achievement.
[44:15] He always gets to a place so that we can
[44:19] rely on him and give him the glory. So
[44:22] he doesn't use your abilities.
[44:26] You have to surrender it to him so he
[44:28] can use it. So he said that unless the
[44:31] people will v or will boast that their
[44:34] hands has saved them, I'm going to use
[44:37] only few people. And
[44:40] Gideon went to them and told them that
[44:45] anyone who is scared go and 22,000 left.
[44:51] It was left to 10,000. The Lord said
[44:54] 10,000 is too many.
[44:57] So he gave them the word test
[45:01] and when that word test came only 300
[45:05] was able to what qualify for that word
[45:07] test. I believe that that word test is
[45:11] going on now.
[45:14] God is giving us the word test and he's
[45:17] trying to show the the characters that
[45:20] is hidden.
[45:22] That's why he said there has to be a
[45:24] falling away first.
[45:26] Because so many people that were with us
[45:29] when that word test came they failed and
[45:33] they have scattered and some of them
[45:35] have even turned against this very word
[45:38] and denying it because they failed the
[45:42] word test. But bless your eyes that you
[45:45] can see and bless you that you can say
[45:48] you were part of that 300. If you are to
[45:51] be transported back to the time of
[45:54] Gideon as you have the revelation
[45:56] standing by the word of God now you'll
[45:59] be part of that 300 that pass that word
[46:02] test
[46:04] that's why God is trying us every day
[46:08] and the trials when we come out of the
[46:11] trials he let us know what is hidden
[46:14] inside of us. Abraham never knew the
[46:17] faith he had until God put him to that
[46:20] test
[46:21] to was offer his only son and the Bible
[46:25] said by faith
[46:28] he offered Isaac why because when those
[46:32] test comes it proves you and it tries
[46:36] you and give you confidence that's what
[46:39] happened to Job
[46:42] he passed that work test
[46:45] And every son and daughter of God,
[46:48] you're going to go through the word
[46:49] test. You'll be tested. You'll be tried
[46:54] and whatever is inside of you will show
[46:56] up.
[46:59] So God doesn't need a majority.
[47:03] Little flock is your father's pleasure
[47:07] to give you what? The kingdom.
[47:10] And that kingdom is within you.
[47:13] You've got the power in the name of
[47:15] Jesus. You've got the power in Jesus
[47:18] name to cast out devils, to heal the
[47:21] sick, to pray for the sick. All those
[47:23] things within you, you got to activate
[47:26] it by acting on the word of God.
[47:30] Whatever you have need of tonight, ah,
[47:33] my God is able to provide it. But
[47:37] depends on you. is according to the
[47:40] level of your faith, the measure of your
[47:43] faith. Everything is available. He's the
[47:46] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[47:50] Amen. He never changes. Hallelujah. He's
[47:53] looking for a willing heart. Hallelujah.
[47:56] Our God is good all the time.
[48:01] And what am I saying tonight?
[48:05] that
[48:06] every one of us
[48:09] we have a purpose.
[48:12] God have a reason. He has a purpose for
[48:16] you and me to fulfill it.
[48:20] And nobody
[48:22] can fulfill that plan unless you fulfill
[48:26] it.
[48:27] Amen. It doesn't matter.
[48:30] Like Simeon.
[48:33] like Simeon he was 80 year old man but
[48:37] God revealed to him that he will not die
[48:43] until he see the birth of Christ.
[48:49] He was 80 at that time maybe old and
[48:52] everything
[48:53] but because God has purposed that to him
[48:57] no matter what it has to happen
[49:00] and when that thing happened he said my
[49:02] eyes have seen the glory of God and Anna
[49:07] also did the same thing even though she
[49:09] was blind she has to see that coming of
[49:12] Christ and she has to fulfill that no
[49:15] one else could have fulfilled it so is
[49:18] you and me. Whatever God has ordained
[49:22] for you to fulfill, nobody can stop it.
[49:28] Even though sometimes
[49:30] human beings will try their best to
[49:33] block it, to do everything their power
[49:37] to stop it. But once God has ordained
[49:41] you for that, he going to move everybody
[49:44] away when the time comes and let you
[49:46] fulfill it. Because it's not by power,
[49:49] by might, but by my spirit, says the
[49:52] Lord. No matter what the enemy does,
[49:55] they can put like m on the face and
[49:59] everything like Mary Magdalene and the
[50:02] woman in the world. They were daughters
[50:04] of the living God.
[50:07] And the devil throw mud on their face
[50:11] and they become like prostitute and the
[50:14] men were using them and it thought that
[50:17] their life was like in shambles and Mary
[50:21] Magdalene was caught in the very act.
[50:25] But because she was a daughter of God,
[50:28] when the time came,
[50:30] oh my,
[50:32] the time that it seemed that was the end
[50:35] of her that she was going to be stoned,
[50:39] the time that she was so supposed to die
[50:42] because her work has not finished yet.
[50:47] And if your work has not finished, no
[50:49] one can take you out from this earth.
[50:51] Amen. Whatever you have to do in this
[50:54] life, if it's not finished, not even
[50:57] death can take you out from here. So is
[51:00] Mary Magdalene. It was time for her to
[51:02] die because the accusers were about to
[51:05] stone her and kill her and destroy her.
[51:10] But at that very moment,
[51:13] the Messiah was there and he began to
[51:16] write that this woman has been caught in
[51:19] the very act. He began to write.
[51:23] By the time he finished all of them has
[51:25] gone and he said that where is your
[51:28] accusers? They all gone who have never
[51:31] sinned. cast that first stone
[51:34] and they all departed
[51:36] and
[51:38] later on she came and fulfilled the very
[51:42] purpose that she was ordained for and
[51:45] follow the Lord ministry and even I
[51:48] believe that she was those that have the
[51:51] the incense to go and anoint that to go
[51:54] to visit him on the on the stone to
[51:57] anoint it. Why? because her life was not
[52:01] finished. And no one can take your life.
[52:05] No sickness, no death, nothing
[52:09] can take your life unless God is
[52:12] finished with you.
[52:14] And whatever you were created for, you
[52:17] will fulfill this one life. Don't let
[52:20] nobody pushes you around. They can push,
[52:24] they can do whatever, but it will come
[52:26] to pass. Amen. Amen. The same as the
[52:29] woman of the world,
[52:31] her purpose in life was to testify
[52:37] and bring people to Jesus Christ.
[52:40] But the devil
[52:42] attacked her and became like a
[52:45] prostitute and she was living like five
[52:47] married, divorced five times and then
[52:50] she also living with somebody's even
[52:52] husband.
[52:54] She went through all that rough time.
[52:57] But when the right time came,
[53:00] God, she said, I have me to go to
[53:03] Samaria
[53:04] because of her, he has to stop every
[53:08] meeting and go and meet her.
[53:12] So is a prophet of when Abraham was here
[53:15] and then he was supposed to take a plane
[53:18] to Chicago because somebody was praying
[53:20] for his daughter, her son, because
[53:23] somebody was desperate for the healing
[53:26] of her son. God has to grant that plane
[53:31] and take him to go and pray for that
[53:35] anti Jamaima son to what? Get well. Not
[53:38] only did that man receive his healing,
[53:41] he also receive he also also became born
[53:45] again. And later on he proved when he
[53:48] met him on the train station that have
[53:50] also been converted because there was a
[53:53] mom praying for her son.
[53:58] So is you and me. We need to pray for
[54:01] our children. No matter how far they
[54:04] have gone, we got to be on their knees
[54:07] for them. Like Job, his children were
[54:10] parting.
[54:12] But Job didn't look at them parting and
[54:15] say, "Oh, you are vagabond children. You
[54:18] are this or curse them." He was on his
[54:21] knees and he was praying for them. So
[54:25] sons and daughters of God, we got to
[54:27] pray for our children. We got to
[54:29] intercede for them.
[54:32] Even the Lot was as as as Lot was strong
[54:37] as strong can be. But still Abraham
[54:41] pleaded through the angel for him
[54:44] because of Lot. He interceded for him.
[54:48] So we have to have that intercessory
[54:50] prayer. We have to pray intercede for
[54:54] our loved ones. No matter what they have
[54:57] done, let's pray for them. Let's support
[55:00] them. Let's do our best because
[55:03] salvation is of the Lord, he's going to
[55:05] do whatever he do. But even in some
[55:07] place, he told the prophet of God that
[55:11] all that loved you and all that you
[55:14] loved, I have given to you. Amen. So if
[55:17] you have confidence and you know that
[55:20] you know that you know that you are part
[55:23] of the bride of Christ then you should
[55:26] be able to claim your children and
[55:28] believe that you love them and all that
[55:31] you loved God has given them to you. It
[55:34] doesn't matter what. Don't look at the
[55:36] appearance.
[55:38] Amen. Look to the promise of God and
[55:41] stand by it and say good words about
[55:44] them. Don't look. Pronounce healing.
[55:47] Pronounce deliverance. Pronounce right
[55:49] words.
[55:51] Amen. And you will see God to work.
[55:56] Sometimes you might not even see it
[55:58] right when you are living, but it will
[56:02] come to pass. You remember the story
[56:05] that talked about that man that um
[56:12] that when he went to a place and the
[56:15] people
[56:17] have gold they wanted him to drink and
[56:20] they wanted to kill him and he said that
[56:24] I'll say my last word when I kill me
[56:26] kill me because my mom told me not to
[56:29] drink now I will not taste the first
[56:31] break
[56:33] and one of them somebody was outside
[56:37] when they were about to kill him
[56:40] somebody came and interveneed he said my
[56:42] mom also told me the same thing but my
[56:45] mom is dead I disobey his her
[56:48] instructions
[56:50] and God used that man to bring all of
[56:52] them to Christ
[56:55] that man's mom did not see his son her
[57:00] son sorry being converted but because
[57:04] she planted the right word
[57:08] and did the right thing after when she
[57:11] was gone
[57:13] her son manifested that.
[57:17] So let's do our part
[57:19] and God will do his part. Amen. You
[57:23] don't have to see everything
[57:26] that you pray for. Don't have to see all
[57:27] the results.
[57:29] He knows what he's doing.
[57:33] He's on time. God, he's the same
[57:37] yesterday, today, and forever.
[57:41] Amen. Praise God.
[57:44] Our God is good.
[57:55] And
[57:57] I haven't finished my main topic because
[58:02] remember all that I was talking about
[58:03] what's happening in the garden of Eden.
[58:05] Is that right? So we've taken it back
[58:07] all the way to what? Calvary.
[58:12] And that woman's seed
[58:16] bruised the serpent seed on the cross
[58:19] on Calvary. He gave up the ghost.
[58:23] He defeated hell grave and hell grave
[58:28] and um death was defeated on Calvary
[58:32] when the Lord gave up the ghost.
[58:35] And what happened when he gave up the
[58:39] ghost?
[58:41] The spir he gave his spirit
[58:44] and after that on the day of Pentecost
[58:49] he became me a many member body his
[58:53] spirit the same spirit that was on Jesus
[58:55] Christ it went into the apostles on the
[58:59] day of Pentecost and they receive it
[59:01] because except a seed of man except the
[59:05] um except the
[59:08] the seed is planted it abides alone
[59:11] So he has to be die and what multiply
[59:14] himself. So after the death the devil
[59:18] first he has only to deal with he became
[59:21] many mamba body he didn't know who to
[59:23] deal with again now he became like a hot
[59:26] potato in his hands you go that same is
[59:29] in Peter it's in Philip it's in it's in
[59:31] it's in um Mark James everywhere and
[59:36] they were scattered and on day of
[59:37] pentecost 3,000 souls were added and the
[59:41] bible said that nobody death
[59:44] at H go to unless God what? Add him to
[59:48] it. And I believe in history repeat
[59:52] itself
[59:54] in a true church that God has ordained
[59:57] that believe this way. Nobody death come
[1:00:00] unless God call him and add him to it.
[1:00:03] You come by yourself, you go by
[1:00:06] yourself. But when God calls you, you
[1:00:08] know God has called you. No matter what
[1:00:11] anyone does to you, it's not that person
[1:00:13] that call you. Sometimes God even permit
[1:00:17] some people to try you and test you and
[1:00:19] be rough to you going to see your
[1:00:21] reaction. If that man who's been rough
[1:00:24] to you or those like they step on your
[1:00:28] toes like this
[1:00:31] when they step on your toes like that
[1:00:33] and all those things. If those
[1:00:37] individuals are the ones that call you
[1:00:39] that you pack your bag like modern day
[1:00:42] marriage when they face a little
[1:00:44] problems they pack their bag and they go
[1:00:46] home. So that's why some people treat
[1:00:49] the the house of God every little thing
[1:00:53] take his back and you go. But if God is
[1:00:57] the one that call you, you don't care.
[1:01:00] You stand by the word of God. You even
[1:01:02] pray for that individual and God will
[1:01:06] turn things around and bring it back to
[1:01:09] the right perspective.
[1:01:11] So we are not here for a man.
[1:01:15] We are here to worship the Lord Jesus
[1:01:18] Christ.
[1:01:20] It's him that brought us here.
[1:01:23] Hallelujah.
[1:01:25] Amen. Praise God. Let me read this one
[1:01:29] here to just um wrap in the wrapping up
[1:01:33] stage.
[1:01:35] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:01:38] Amen. So what am I saying?
[1:01:42] When
[1:01:44] he gave up the ghost,
[1:01:47] then his prayer became available
[1:01:51] and then
[1:01:53] those who are part of him in every age
[1:01:58] receive that word of God and manifest it
[1:02:02] because if you are not part of it, you
[1:02:05] can't receive it in your age. And God
[1:02:08] has been dealing with what individuals
[1:02:10] all the time.
[1:02:13] Hallelujah.
[1:02:14] So um
[1:02:18] that power that Adam had that's why the
[1:02:23] Lord Jesus Christ died to bring us back
[1:02:28] the third is a revelation of the seven
[1:02:30] seals and became available when God when
[1:02:35] the seals were revealed 1363. So I'm
[1:02:37] just going to read this here in uh the
[1:02:40] Messiah paragraph 55
[1:02:43] now self will then God comes into the
[1:02:47] man into the heart which is the spirit
[1:02:50] then the spirit makes the soul and then
[1:02:53] the soul dwells in the body. Now when a
[1:02:56] man is converted say just like that
[1:02:59] little white bottom
[1:03:02] starts in his heart. Now that part is
[1:03:05] God. God when he's born again that
[1:03:09] spirit of God spirit dwells in him.
[1:03:15] Now, as he can let that spirit grow and
[1:03:19] take out all the roots of bitterness
[1:03:22] and press God's way through him, he can
[1:03:26] become back in the same condition that
[1:03:31] he was when he was in the Garden of
[1:03:36] Eden.
[1:03:37] Jesus said in Mark 11:24,
[1:03:41] "Very verily I say unto you, if you say
[1:03:46] to this mountain, be moved and do not
[1:03:50] doubt in your heart, but believe that
[1:03:52] what you have said will come to pass,
[1:03:55] you can have what you said." That puts
[1:03:59] him back right back supreme again. Puts
[1:04:03] him right back in the right condition.
[1:04:08] If thou kinds believe and do not doubt
[1:04:10] in your heart,
[1:04:13] God
[1:04:14] will work through you and if you say to
[1:04:18] this mountain be moved and do not doubt
[1:04:21] in your heart, but believe that what you
[1:04:23] have said will come to pass, you shall
[1:04:26] have what you say is still available for
[1:04:30] you and me today.
[1:04:32] We just have to act on the word of God
[1:04:35] and see God come and what vindicate it
[1:04:38] because he said I have said and I have
[1:04:40] purpose it will come to pass
[1:04:45] and it puts man back back in that
[1:04:48] condition
[1:04:50] because whatever Adam said God was
[1:04:52] pleased with it because he was thinking
[1:04:55] the thought of God and you tonight you
[1:04:58] have the mind of Christ.
[1:05:01] Amen. That's what the Calvarist was
[1:05:03] there for, to restore us back to our
[1:05:06] original thought, our original way of
[1:05:09] doing things. Yes, the flesh may make
[1:05:13] mistakes, but that sh that part of God
[1:05:16] in you, it can never disbelieve God's
[1:05:20] word. It will always spoke the right
[1:05:22] word. There's a fight, a battle going
[1:05:25] on. But as our former pastor, it depends
[1:05:28] on which one you are feeling most.
[1:05:31] That part of God in you can never sin.
[1:05:35] It can never disbelieve God's word.
[1:05:39] Amen. Because it's a part of him. So
[1:05:42] whatever you say,
[1:05:45] if thou can believe, all things are
[1:05:49] what? Possible to them that believe. I
[1:05:53] am a son of God
[1:05:55] and I have right
[1:05:58] to every promise in the book. You got to
[1:06:01] write to a sound mind. You got to write
[1:06:04] to everything that God has promised for
[1:06:07] you. Don't let the devil take away your
[1:06:10] joy of salvation. Don't let him steal
[1:06:12] away your joy. He just like to distract.
[1:06:18] He's a distractor. He bring things in
[1:06:20] your life to distract you, to try to
[1:06:22] take away your joy from you. But you
[1:06:24] have to say no. You got to boo him back.
[1:06:27] Put him back in his place. Tell him who
[1:06:30] side of what you are made up of. Amen. I
[1:06:34] like that song that Mlin used to sing.
[1:06:37] Amen. I'm one in a million. Hallelujah.
[1:06:42] What you are made up of, you have to
[1:06:43] show it to him. Amen. You are son or
[1:06:47] daughter of God.
[1:06:49] And God has placed his trust in you and
[1:06:54] me.
[1:06:56] He sent as a vindicated prophet. And
[1:07:00] he's like a wave shift. God raised him
[1:07:03] up. The way Jesus Christ was a wave
[1:07:05] shift. He also raised Abraham up for us
[1:07:08] to see what God can bring a man to.
[1:07:12] Is that right? We're not worshiping the
[1:07:13] prophet,
[1:07:15] but we have confidence that the same God
[1:07:18] that was in him is now in the true
[1:07:21] bride. Amen. In a many members body
[1:07:26] doing exact same thing through that
[1:07:29] bride life in a different way. It might
[1:07:32] not be in a high like him but still God
[1:07:35] is doing mighty works through the bride
[1:07:37] because he said that if thou can
[1:07:40] believe. If the same spirit that raise
[1:07:43] up from Christ from the dead if it
[1:07:46] dwells in you to also what quicken your
[1:07:48] mortal body. He said the works that I do
[1:07:51] shall you also do.
[1:07:55] Amen. That same God is here.
[1:07:59] He took the prophet. He never took his
[1:08:01] spirit
[1:08:04] and he is ready to use you and me. Amen.
[1:08:10] No wonder that the Bible said in Romans
[1:08:15] 8:19,
[1:08:18] Romans 8:19 again, it says,
[1:08:24] sorry, in Romans 8:19, for the earnest
[1:08:28] expectation of the creature waitth for
[1:08:31] the manifestation of the sons of God.
[1:08:35] They are all waiting on us to put that
[1:08:38] word to act on that word and bring it to
[1:08:41] manifestation so that everything can
[1:08:43] come so it can go back to that original
[1:08:47] creation where the lamb and the wolf
[1:08:50] will live together when dogs will not
[1:08:53] back on you try to bite you
[1:08:56] where all the lambs lion everything they
[1:09:00] all going to be in their proper state
[1:09:03] they are waiting on you and me.
[1:09:06] We are the ones with the last baton. And
[1:09:09] in Hebrews
[1:09:11] 11:37
[1:09:13] to
[1:09:15] um Hebrews 11:37 to to 39. It said they
[1:09:22] were stoned.
[1:09:24] They were sworn as sand were tempted.
[1:09:28] Was lain with a sword. They wandered
[1:09:31] about in sheep skins and goat skins
[1:09:34] being destitute, afflicted, tormented.
[1:09:38] Verse 38, of whom the world was not
[1:09:42] worthy. They wandered in desertes and in
[1:09:46] mountains and in ds and in caves of the
[1:09:48] earth. And this all
[1:09:52] having obtained a good report through
[1:09:55] faith receive not the promise.
[1:10:00] God having provided some better things
[1:10:03] for us that they without us should not
[1:10:07] be what be made perfect.
[1:10:10] So they are waiting on us.
[1:10:13] They are all waiting on us because they
[1:10:17] without us will not be what? made
[1:10:19] perfect. That's why our former pastor
[1:10:23] spoke to us last Sunday. Let's act on
[1:10:26] the word of God.
[1:10:29] If you do not act on, you will not see
[1:10:31] the power of God. I remember myself
[1:10:36] when I first came here
[1:10:39] and I was, you know, my nature a little
[1:10:42] bit quiet. So, I don't like um
[1:10:47] things like that sometimes. bed.
[1:10:50] I remember
[1:10:52] one time my sister in UK was given
[1:10:55] birth. It was soon life and death and I
[1:10:58] prayed for her and God delivered her and
[1:11:02] the husband were very happy. But I never
[1:11:05] had that courage of like going out and
[1:11:08] laying my hands on somebody and praying
[1:11:10] for them before. But as pastor Simmon a
[1:11:12] former pastor preached last Sunday
[1:11:14] before he preached like that in a mighty
[1:11:18] and a powerful way like that and the
[1:11:20] word become so clear revealed to my
[1:11:22] heart
[1:11:24] become so real that oh man I'm going to
[1:11:26] act on this word of God. So I went to
[1:11:29] Ghana in 2003.
[1:11:32] That was the first time that God used me
[1:11:35] to pray for the sick because God sent
[1:11:38] our pastor here to preach that word in
[1:11:41] his purest purest form. And when he
[1:11:45] preached it like that, that anointing
[1:11:46] that spirit that revelation became so
[1:11:49] real and clear to me. So when I went to
[1:11:52] Ghana, there was no shyness in me. I was
[1:11:55] just testifying everywhere I was going.
[1:11:59] And I happened that I was going to visit
[1:12:04] my stepmom.
[1:12:05] His name is Agnes. And I kind of got
[1:12:09] lost to the house. And I ended up in
[1:12:13] another Agnes house in the area. When I
[1:12:16] went there, the woman was shivering with
[1:12:19] clothes on her shaking.
[1:12:22] And I realized it's not the same person
[1:12:25] that I was looking for. like under
[1:12:28] normal circumstance if it's not a person
[1:12:30] you go your way but because God has used
[1:12:33] our pastor that was way back in 2003 to
[1:12:37] preach like that that anointing that
[1:12:40] that when I was I was so on fire for
[1:12:43] Christ I laid my hands on the woman I
[1:12:46] prayed for her I gave her money and I
[1:12:48] left in 3 days time I came back and she
[1:12:55] said son God send you here.
[1:12:59] I was shivering. I was dying. There was
[1:13:02] no hope.
[1:13:04] But when God sent you here, when you
[1:13:06] prayed for me, I began to sweat. I began
[1:13:11] to sweat. I began to pee. Sorry, use the
[1:13:14] washroom. And within a short time, all
[1:13:18] my sickness, everything was gone without
[1:13:21] seeing any doctor. So what I'm
[1:13:24] encouraging tonight is if you have not
[1:13:26] been acting on that word of God, act on
[1:13:28] it.
[1:13:31] Don't worry as he said,
[1:13:34] lay your hands on the sick and get eye
[1:13:36] and what God will do the recovery.
[1:13:40] Don't be shy.
[1:13:43] Talk about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:13:45] Everywhere you go, don't be ashamed of
[1:13:48] him. He said, "If you ashamed of me,
[1:13:50] I'll be ashamed of you.
[1:13:52] Don't hide your religion.
[1:13:56] Let it be in an open face. Let the life
[1:14:00] of Christ in you speak because our life
[1:14:04] speak more rather than our words.
[1:14:08] Let that life flow through rest
[1:14:11] because the whole creation
[1:14:15] they are what groaning and waiting for
[1:14:19] the sons and daughters of God to take
[1:14:21] their positions just like Joshua and
[1:14:23] Caleb they took their position on the
[1:14:26] word of God.
[1:14:28] Amen.
[1:14:30] Samson recognized who he was.
[1:14:34] Amen. And when the fight came at he just
[1:14:36] take a jawbone because he knew the
[1:14:38] anointing of God on him and he take that
[1:14:41] jawbone and defeated thousand
[1:14:43] Philistines. That same God is here.
[1:14:47] If thou can believe take that word of
[1:14:49] God and God will manifest it through
[1:14:52] you. It's not by your power by your
[1:14:55] might but by his spirit says the Lord.
[1:14:59] Because the spirit of God is about to
[1:15:01] move. the bride's about to go. There's
[1:15:05] no time to waste. When you see all the
[1:15:08] things around us, what do you think is
[1:15:10] going to happen when this pope is in
[1:15:13] power? And very soon you're going to see
[1:15:16] that wealth council of churches come to
[1:15:18] this culmination.
[1:15:20] Amen. Hallelujah. And the scripture said
[1:15:24] the oneness is not churches coming
[1:15:26] together with different doctrines but
[1:15:29] you become one with God and God reveal
[1:15:33] himself through you. Amen. That's what a
[1:15:36] true oneness is. Hallelujah. Ah God is
[1:15:40] able. He's the same yesterday, today and
[1:15:44] forever. Amen. Hallelujah. No wonder
[1:15:49] that spirit of God Elijah was so
[1:15:53] conscious of the spirit of God in him.
[1:15:57] Amen. Sometimes we are not conscious of
[1:15:59] what we have.
[1:16:01] But Elijah
[1:16:03] was so conscious that he laid his body
[1:16:05] upon that dead body and came to life. It
[1:16:10] was God in that man. God took over. He
[1:16:14] was anointed. Jesus said that he was
[1:16:17] every prophet of God in the old temple
[1:16:18] was anointed for the with the Holy
[1:16:20] Ghost. They were then were lesser lines.
[1:16:23] He was the fullness of God being the
[1:16:26] Messiah. They saw Messiah then smaller
[1:16:29] messiahs for they were anointed with the
[1:16:32] same spirit that he was anointed with
