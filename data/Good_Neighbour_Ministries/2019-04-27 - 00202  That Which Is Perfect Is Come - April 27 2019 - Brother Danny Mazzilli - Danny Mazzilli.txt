TRANSCRIPT
========================================
yes he said in the city seven seas talking about eyes but you don't have eyes to see that we can't possibly see and then he goes up in bed with that come up heels in the seven seas guess what seals we're gonna do he opened those seals because there was a there was a change of watch it was going from the Prophet over to the right angel himself because that seventh seal that was open to interpretation he said to school on is water because Dada was gonna cover the scene he was gonna the intelligence mouth was gonna come and [Music] [Music] revelation [Music] yourself coming to you as an individual and not seeing Chris Paul David no he's calling you by the beat and responding you responded here in your position that's how that's how faster side windows that's how he knows it idiot if the word is having an effect on the people he knows that this is God's church that it's God that causes public places it's the Lord had asked to the church not any not googling out there and you pull people into the church because you can pull people I pulled a lot of people into this church [Applause] [Music] because his children because he's not gonna provoke his son to that he's not gonna provoke his children to the point with everything else something wrong with that because God is giving you the meeting over that hole and when you're in your position as a father son of God you can be quiet the Holy Spirit can you say what's the truth and you leave it at that you say what but but the word says even if that not hear about the word to take control in the situation well it's the same thing in anything that we do we use that as an example but here you are in the church listen God has placed trustees in the church they've been anointed to do the work that God has has described as what a trustee does in the Church of God and when that person understands their position and states in their position during doing that and God blesses it God gives somebody somebody needs God gives them and the same thing with a deacon safety with the pressure whatever it is whether they're in their position right God gives the right inspiration and gives authority in that decision so it's the mind page it's it's not the mind age it's the supernatural intelligence age witches now brother grabbed people's audiences now then when the dot-com he opened the seven seals and revealed the evening like taking all the mysteries that [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it's not so much [Music] that could never change and so now he says he says justification under new sanctification that's pulling his bride out he's creating his bride justification under another sanctification of the recipe and so forth you see he evolution of the Spirit being given more and more because the body is building coming to the head which is Christ the body of Christ now what Moses would have come to brought those message [Music] he says it would not work and I think Jesus message had worked every word of Moses and neither the Wesley's message every word in movement or Luther's message vice versa and today we are the last Reformation was Pentecostal and today we're moving for that and the Pentecostal message will mix with this because it's another day and that's why you know when you go sometimes you start the culture for some people and all their stock on hope you didn't save the way the Prophet said it's because don't get me wrong here and don't think that you know they they're not right they might very well be practical there's a dispositional change here it just like someone left on the other side of Jordan they were ordained and given their position and the portion of land on that side of Jordan not on this side just like leaders of pride just like Wesley's right just like that kind of gospel right that came up through the message of William Branham they'd have a place in the World Cup but those that recognize their thing and its message are feeding on something that is different you can't interpret it you can't put an interpretation up into supernatural experiences it just it just happens and so that's why you for some reason start talking you makes it those for an hour we both feel that connection it's because this is a different disposition and you're receiving something that is policing you into your part of the world your part is different everybody's got apart from each dispensational age is going to lead up to the rapture of the church and so here not he says that neither the Jesus message typically will smother busty and today be our last time Reformation was better than today or moving through that and the gospel message mix with this and that's right the message so covenant church is now going to another transformation and there's there's a change because the revelation is moving on the progression of the word is moving up and it's naturally going to leave both behind there that can't be see this it's just as simple as that okay and not like you can't interpret that because it's another day it will mix it's all the Word of God but it's building like the feet arms coming up forming a bride for the rapture Halloween I'm going to bypass a lot of this just goes down oh that's musicians come there's so much actually you know what I'm not going further because this next stage when I started eating this I started and it's so excited because remember asked misters we want that farm talk we want that that chain of thought you want that revelation that that excites us that lights up something inside of us that gives us the inspiration and the confidence and the courage the mystery of the story that's how he's doing it in the final mystery that's why somebody come up here and they they got their own agenda or whatever they were afraid for it will not feed the church not the future I just won't do it but there's so much in here and you know if you get a chance read the the seals will back to be the seals again read the breach between the seals the first church the first seal the second third reading reading they're having this bottom line of how God is progressing the word and giving you faith for a rapture and how how it's actually taking place and bringing you to a place where you'll actually start to know how to apply the word what to actually do the word because brother Kraft said that this will [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] brotherbrother one new message Genesis chapter 2 Bible says God for the spear an empty formerly breathe into its nostrils the breath of life and I will be able to be sold under the new creation using the Duster here to here but crowd you bag to walk again and through the ages like a brother this transfers over the mountains into the CH the prophetic revelation came soon and then into the bride accepting the intelligence [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the inspiration coming from the bodies from the message running [Music] discover the scene and then the Lord Himself comes to be what Christ if they could God is in Turpan topples over to make you smart lady speaking to his bride time greatly amen praise the Lord that's why we're here today I'm so glad to be here in the house the Lord regardless of who is those people when you have notes a special speaker it makes a little bit more motivation for people to be in the house here the speaker band covers and we have different flavors Minister what really Jesus Christ is a special speaker she'll be up and we have a service for the relativity here Lord of God and do the best we can but his glory amen let us have Hornet cream that's bleep quietly good girl we think that work the Julie is here despite the trenches [Music] [Music] [Music] Church yes she's insurance because she told that she needs to be a church and the presence of God that's what gives you strength that's my peers majority's deliverance and this world god bless everyone be differently that was the warning premium racist on every block [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Music] god bless wall [Music]
