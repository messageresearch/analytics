of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray amen and amen second corinthians chapter 13 verse verse 5. examine yourself whether he be in the faith proof your own self know ye not your own self how does jesus know you not your own self how that jesus christ is in you except ye be reprobates you may be seated hallelujah the bible said he live in us the word rupert you know the word rupert beat rupert means condemned you know what he said there except he be rupert you know he lives in you he said that except he be reprobate robert means condemned rejected unworthy by god beyond hope of salvation that's a big word hallelujah but we know we are not like that we are the children of god we are updated children when christ was on the cross we were in him when he when you stood in the paris parasite that we were there when he was standing in sanhedrin they were mocking him we were there when they took him to our centurion we were there when we were whipping him we were there thank you lord there is nowhere christ was that you were not there everything that they did to him we were in him hallelujah thank you lord so he knows our suffering he felt it so he know what you're gonna be right here right now so don't look at yourself that you alone he went for it that he gave everything upon himself he took everything for himself that we should not go the same way that he went through so we have to be the happiest people in the face of the earth hallelujah thank you lord he gave you everything he said oh what i have i gave it to you amen thank you lord amen glory to god we're going to have slide number 26 that 26 is there right okay we're going to have 27. yeah is it 27 or 28. no we need to i need a 28-27 that's 27 you 27. is that 27 okay 27 if you cry to hide okay if you try to hurt your sins you will never succeed but if you humble confess and reject reject him you will receive mercy if you try to hide your sins you will never succeed you cannot hide your sins because the bible said the believer does not make don't have sin because he took everything upon himself so you cannot hide nothing from god bible said you have an advocate with the father so he is the judge all what you have to do you have to get on your knees and repent and talk to him because he wants us to talk to him he don't want us to get away he wants us to talk to him don't encroach yourself to somewhere because of what you have done he is your lawyer the same time he is your judge so you have to pray you have to talk to him don't exclude yourself hallelujah you cannot cut cut you cannot cut corners hallelujah amen glory to god even david said you know that david he has so many thoughts he was a man he did something that he cannot do he shouldn't do but he thought he was doing in secret what can you hide what can you hide from god in secret you tell me what can you hide from god in secret you cannot hide nothing even the syrians they want to attack israel they went to their best chamber to have a conversation how they are going to attack them by the time they realize everything is in israel what they are doing so how can you hide something from god you cannot and god said he has forgiven you everything already he put it under the sea where you cannot reach to take it take it back why he wants you to be free the bible says we are created free moral agency he we are his children we are his partnership she's so he always wanted to talk to him talk to him you did something wrong talk to him god is a being before when we know god was saying we thought god was way high in the sky i used to look around to see if i can pick go and take my eye on above the crowd to see him when i was young when i see the moon when i see the moon i look the moon i thought god was there hallelujah not knowing he was living inside of me hallelujah so how can you hide something from him even before the thought comes to your mind he already knows hallelujah oh glory to god our god is good amen david said even if i send i send into heaven he is there and behold if i i make my bed under hell he's already there so why are you gonna hide you cannot hide thank you he is always there for you he holds there for you there is no mistake that god cannot forgive you there's only one mistake as the holy spirit then if you sin against the holy spirit you blaspheme against the holy spirit you would be never be forgiving because holy spirit is god himself so any other than that god will forgive you everything rise up and go forward hallelujah we're gonna go slide number 29 29 that's 29 okay yes i look around and ask the holy spirit to use me how many here tonight want the holy spirit to use them hallelujah this is what we are here for when we read the bible we hear what god does to our brethren our four fathers everybody rejoiced when we read about paul when we read about peter when we read about john when we read about nathaniel but jesus christ said he is the same yesterday today and forever he does not change even our prophet came down here we saw how how much the holy spirit used our brother and now he passed everything unto us we cannot come to his presence every day every night yes without seeing the manifestation of god in your life one time you have to see god in your life just one time that's your testimony that will drive you every time you guarantee that that thing hit your mind this this is not i did it but god that is your strength that is taking you right down to the journey you need something that will take in you to drive you hallelujah that's why this purpose of prayer is very important because god wants to draw you closer to himself hallelujah to know him the power of his resurrection each and everyone has a gift because the gift is in you that gives you to the holy spirit himself remember abraham said you're gonna reach a time you cannot come to this store they're gonna lock you down so what are you doing prepare yourself there is no time to come back that is no time to call brother tim no time to call brother coffee or brother brother friend or any of the deacons it's you alone this is the time you have to
