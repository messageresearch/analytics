[27:45] Believers that are believing the word of
[27:48] God I believe God is
[27:49] revealing to the bride all around the
[27:52] world I don't think she's a majority
[27:54] though amen but I believe she's all over
[27:57] the world and God is calling her out
[27:59] amen hallelujah last time I preached I
[28:03] uh on the Sunday there I was going
[28:05] through a lot of different things in my
[28:07] body and I'm still going through some
[28:08] things I woke up this morning I sent a
[28:10] text to a couple Believers last night
[28:13] and I said you know if I wake up in the
[28:15] morning without any pain then I I might
[28:19] think that I'm dead so I sent that out
[28:22] yesterday and I woke up this morning and
[28:24] I pulled a muscle in my back and uh my
[28:28] hip I don't know what happened there I
[28:31] couldn't get out of bed I was like like
[28:33] Jacob you know like I was limping I'm
[28:36] going oh man what's going on here so I
[28:39] just went I said I'm going upstairs I'm
[28:40] going to study and see what the Lord
[28:43] does and uh I'm here I'm standing here
[28:48] amen and uh you know what we got to we
[28:51] got to press through Sometimes some
[28:53] things amen and we got to pray one for
[28:55] another amen especially in this hour we
[28:58] need to move this word on Hallelujah we
[29:02] have seen some you know the word on
[29:04] Sunday was was great we can see how God
[29:07] has transferred like Elijah the double
[29:11] portion down the anointing is here amen
[29:15] it doesn't matter about man amen it's
[29:18] God it's the anointing and he's here
[29:20] because of you because of me amen
[29:24] because he has a purpose and a plan to
[29:26] bring forth his word so I want to finish
[29:30] I didn't finish it there because at that
[29:32] time I was feeling really bad I was
[29:34] getting used to new medication and and I
[29:36] thought I was going to pass out here
[29:37] that's why I rushed off the pulpit if
[29:39] anybody remembers and um so I want to
[29:43] you know I had a little bit to finish so
[29:45] God just made it into a message so I
[29:49] want to read tonight out of Revelations
[29:51] 10:8 Jeremiah
[29:54] 3311 we want to talk about the voice of
[29:57] God and where it is
[30:00] today and what his voice is amen what
[30:04] his voice is and where it is
[30:07] today because it's not in a day past
[30:10] it's here it's got to be here because
[30:13] all the scriptures and even the prophets
[30:16] prophecies and what he have spoken said
[30:18] it will be here so I hope we identify
[30:21] ourselves with the voice of God tonight
[30:23] and where it is
[30:24] at my title is the Manifest of the voice
[30:28] of God in the
[30:29] bride in the bride Hallelujah that's
[30:33] where it's prophesied to be in this hour
[30:36] and brother Bram says I don't know who
[30:37] it is but I know there's going to be a
[30:40] bride
[30:42] hallelujah amen and the voice which I
[30:47] heard from Heaven spake unto me again
[30:50] and said go and take the little
[30:54] book which is open in the hand of the
[30:56] angel
[30:58] which is open in the hand of the Angel
[31:01] and we believe in this day we got to
[31:03] bring it to today we believe that those
[31:06] seals are
[31:07] open today they're open they're not
[31:11] closed they're open so God's word is
[31:14] open and available to manifest in our
[31:19] lives which standeth upon the sea and
[31:22] upon the Earth and I went unto the angel
[31:25] and said unto him give give me the
[31:28] little book
[31:30] Hallelujah Lord give me the little book
[31:33] that should be our desire and our hunger
[31:35] and our
[31:37] thirst and he said unto me take
[31:42] it eat it
[31:44] up and it shall make thy belly
[31:47] bitter but it shall be in thy mouth
[31:50] sweet as
[31:52] honey and I took the little book out of
[31:56] the Angel's hand Hallelujah there's the
[32:00] bride and ate it up and it was in my
[32:04] mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I
[32:06] ate it it my belly was
[32:11] bitter and he said unto me thou must
[32:15] prophesy again before many peoples and
[32:18] Nations and tongues and Kings Hallelujah
[32:22] let us go to Jeremiah
[32:23] 3311 I believe that's the bride
[32:27] in this hour and in this day Hallelujah
[32:31] but you know the bride said give me that
[32:33] book and the bride took it and she ate
[32:36] it the word it was sweet in her mouth I
[32:39] mean this Revelation is sweet when it
[32:41] strikes you amen but oh man if you just
[32:44] let it sink down and let it take control
[32:48] and let the Lord the word be the Lord of
[32:50] your life it gets a little
[32:54] bitter Jeremiah 33:11
[32:57] the voice of Joy the voice of gladness
[33:01] the voice of the bridegroom and the
[33:03] voice of the
[33:05] Bride the voice of them that shall say
[33:08] praise the Lord of hosts for all for the
[33:12] Lord is good for his mercy endureth
[33:17] forever and of them that shall bring the

[34:49] first like we know what came first the
[34:52] church or the word the word came first
[34:56] Hallelujah
[34:57] and what came first the message of the
[35:00] hour or the word the word came first and
[35:04] the prophet always point us back to the
[35:07] word and sometimes it's a sad thing but
[35:11] we know more of the quotes than we do
[35:13] the word of God and that's why people
[35:16] misinterpret the word of God because
[35:19] they take the quotes and they put their
[35:21] own interpretation on it we are to take
[35:23] the message of the hour and filter it
[35:26] through the word of God and when the
[35:28] word of God and the message line up then
[35:32] we got a perfect
[35:33] shot we're taught that we've been taught
[35:36] that by our former Pastor amen the word
[35:39] comes first and always is back not back
[35:42] to the quotes but back to the
[35:45] word the voice is the word of
[35:50] God Amen now the voice of God in the
[35:53] last
[35:54] days and God had promised to meet the
[35:58] need of the
[36:00] hour he always does that and we need the
[36:05] voice of God
[36:07] today now not back there but
[36:11] today this is our quote not
[36:15] 1963 but
[36:18] 2024 we need the voice of God today to
[36:23] meet the need of the hour
[36:27] oh my a present day God a present voice
[36:32] of
[36:33] God you know people are getting drugged
[36:38] up in this hour to look back at the
[36:42] voice there and not recognizing the
[36:45] voice
[36:46] today a delusion a
[36:50] deceiving power has been released to
[36:53] make people look back and not see what
[36:56] what God is doing
[36:58] today it's all prophesied it's all given
[37:01] to us in the word clearly laid out for
[37:04] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[37:07] amen and after he promised it we can
[37:11] rest assure that he will keep his
[37:15] promise that's the confidence that a
[37:18] Believer has in his maker that he
[37:21] promised to meet the
[37:22] need and today one reason that the
[37:25] church is in the condition that it's in
[37:28] is because there's so many voices and so
[37:32] many other voices to attract the church
[37:36] from the voice of
[37:38] god
[37:40] wow
[37:43] wow and a lot of these other
[37:47] voices and a lot of these other strange
[37:49] voices we call the voice of
[37:52] God but it's distracting the people of
[37:56] away from the true voice of
[37:59] God let us get into it and we'll see
[38:03] where the Lord leads
[38:08] tonight until it's very doubtful that
[38:12] many would hear the voice of God though
[38:14] it's spoken right in their
[38:18] midst they perhaps would even understand
[38:21] it because it wouldn't it would be
[38:24] foreign to the a foreign thing to them
[38:28] they have gotten themselves so much
[38:31] centered on the voices of the day and if
[38:35] we notice in our scripture reading that
[38:38] the voice of God was foreign to them and
[38:41] it become that way
[38:44] today that the voice of God there are so
[38:48] many other voices and then if God
[38:50] promised he would give us that and if
[38:54] other voices are contrary to the voice
[38:57] of God then it must be the voice of the
[39:01] enemy confusing us that we would not
[39:05] understand the voice of God when it's
[39:09] spoken wow you talk about deception
[39:13] remember with in the Garden of Eden
[39:15] Satan took the
[39:18] word he took the
[39:21] word and all these other strange voices
[39:24] are taking the word and trying to
[39:27] interpret
[39:32] it
[39:34] voices let's talk about voices for a
[39:37] minute so I can lay a background so you
[39:40] may understand where I'm
[39:44] going a voice is a
[39:47] tool that transports us into the
[39:50] future and we can see that everything
[39:55] that's been spoken
[39:57] Jesus would have not
[39:59] come if there wasn't a
[40:02] prophet back in Isaiah that spoke and
[40:06] said a virgin shall conceive his name
[40:09] Shall be Called Emmanuel God With
[40:13] Us so the voice is always speaking the
[40:17] future into
[40:19] existence and what God has spoken if you
[40:22] know your God you'll see what he has
[40:26] spoken in these last days that those
[40:29] words that were spoken by a prophet is
[40:32] for the future it's for now
[40:36] today
[40:39] Hallelujah glory to
[40:43] God a
[40:45] future has more
[40:48] possibilities and more
[40:51] solutions a voice is a tool that can be
[40:55] used for we're standing up for what is
[40:58] Right rather than what is
[41:02] easy a voice gives you
[41:05] opinions a
[41:07] platform and gifts gifts you with the
[41:13] opportunity to have a prospect and
[41:16] knowledge on things that matter no two
[41:19] voices are the same each voice has
[41:22] something different to say we know that
[41:26] the body is many different parts and
[41:29] each is given a Measure of Faith to
[41:32] speak the word in our
[41:38] lives in and in the world and in a world
[41:43] that needs to represent freedom and
[41:46] democracy a voice is a powerful symbol
[41:49] of this and it is what has allowed
[41:52] people to protest in Justice to sing for
[41:56] Freedom or simply speak the
[41:59] truth a voice can be a source of Hope in
[42:04] difficult
[42:06] times using your voice for truth is
[42:09] important to create a better
[42:12] world everyone's voice matters and I
[42:16] believe that today are the Bride of
[42:20] Jesus Christ every voice
[42:23] matters and that's where Satan will
[42:26] tried to shut you
[42:28] up amen take that voice away from you
[42:32] when God is revealing things to
[42:35] you your life is a voice your actions is
[42:40] a
[42:41] Voice
[42:44] Hallelujah glory to
[42:46] God
[42:50] Amen and it
[42:53] is H
[42:55] Allelujah
[42:57] create a better world for every voice
[42:59] matters it is important not to let
[43:01] yourself become silent because when a
[43:03] voice is not
[43:06] used it prevents the opportunity for
[43:09] True
[43:10] democracy where each voice is valued in
[43:13] a peaceful manner voices carry
[43:17] Impressions and feelings and passion and
[43:21] excitement voices can transport anything
[43:24] whether it's a Feeling or a place or an
[43:28] idea that's how powerful a voice is Amen
[43:33] in a way voices are
[43:35] superpower if you know how to use it
[43:38] just like James says amen your tongue is
[43:42] a powerful
[43:44] thing and we must take the tongue our
[43:48] voice the words and use it in the right
[43:53] way
[43:55] Hallelujah
[43:56] a Amen brother Bram said what did he say
[43:59] go create your world speak your world
[44:03] and go live on it your
[44:06] atmosphere Hallelujah your
[44:09] Victory your your overcoming amen it's
[44:13] going to come by faith and and and when
[44:17] it comes by faith then you got to speak
[44:19] it
[44:21] Hallelujah let us move on here voices
[44:25] can be used to create
[44:28] change now I hope you're typing this put
[44:31] your spiritual thinking caps
[44:33] on type this back to our calling and our
[44:38] position in
[44:41] Christ people can take anything or any
[44:44] material thing from you but they cannot
[44:47] take your voice or they cannot take your
[44:51] faith Satan could do what he wanted to
[44:54] job and take what he wanted from job but
[44:57] when it came down to it just like
[44:59] brother Brandon when it came down to it
[45:02] blessed be the name of the Lord he
[45:04] giveth he taketh blessed be the name of
[45:07] the
[45:08] Lord H shall not the judge of the earth
[45:11] do right he's the Creator
[45:15] Hallelujah glory to God
[45:19] amen
[45:21] hallelujah voices are meant to encourage
[45:24] other voices are used to unite some to
[45:28] support each other one of the most
[45:30] powerful things someone can do is use
[45:34] their
[45:35] voice
[45:36] hallelujah amen again in John
[45:42] 1613 Jesus speaking here how bit when he
[45:47] the spirit of Truth the word is come he
[45:52] will guide you into all truth Thy word

[46:10] word this is
[46:12] you this is me he says you'll know in
[46:16] that day that I'm in the Father the
[46:18] father in me and I am in you God is

[46:33] God and he shall show you things to come
[46:38] oh yes the spirit bringing the word of
[46:41] Prophecy I want you to note very
[46:44] carefully that Jesus did not say that
[46:47] the evidence of being baptized with the
[46:49] Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues
[46:51] interpretations prophecies or shouting
[46:54] or dancing he he said the evidence would
[46:57] be that when you would be in the truth
[47:02] you would be in the word of God for your
[47:05] age you would catch the Revelation what
[47:08] God is doing
[47:10] today that is the evidence of the Holy
[47:13] Ghost because he can only lead you to
[47:16] fulfill what he's given us in this
[47:19] day oh
[47:21] my there are so many that are fulfilling
[47:25] a day gone past so many that are living
[47:28] in the prophets day Pentecostal day
[47:31] Baptist day Luther Day claiming to be
[47:35] Christians claiming to have the word of
[47:38] God but today is a different age it's a
[47:41] different day it's the bride's
[47:44] day Hallelujah do we know the prophecies
[47:48] that God has given in this
[47:51] hour Hallelujah because he the spirit of
[47:54] Truth can only lead you to what he is
[47:57] fulfilling in this hour he'll never lead
[48:00] you to another
[48:01] age never that's another voice those are
[48:06] strange voices but the voice of God in
[48:10] this hour will lead you to the word that
[48:12] is being fulfilled
[48:16] today
[48:19] hallelujah
[48:24] amen evidence has to do with receiving
[48:28] That Word pergamus Church age Hebrews
[48:32] 3:1 he is the high priest Upon Our
[48:36] confession Upon Our confession he is the
[48:39] high
[48:40] priest what are we
[48:44] confessing what are we
[48:46] speaking I'm not just talking about you
[48:50] know speaking stupid or foolish things
[48:54] I'm talking what are we
[48:57] saying when we speak the written word
[49:02] what what are we saying that's been
[49:04] revealed to us in this hour our life
[49:07] speaks our fellowship
[49:11] speaks you can't help but what's inside
[49:14] of a man or a woman will come out in
[49:17] your voice and what's revealed to
[49:22] you he's the confession Mark of
[49:26] 11:24 whatever you desire
[49:29] speak and it will be given do not
[49:33] confess negative thoughts in your mind
[49:35] rather Speak life the life for the age
[49:40] to every situation around
[49:43] you
[49:45] Hallelujah everything around
[49:48] you I mean we should be at that place of
[49:51] maturity in this hour that where we
[49:54] recognize
[49:56] when the enemy comes
[49:58] in and then we take the word of God and
[50:02] we deny
[50:04] him we reject him we resist him by what
[50:09] by speaking the truth the word in this
[50:13] hour I've seen him so many times attack
[50:17] and I just sit there instead of oh lean
[50:19] into fear lean into doubt lean into to
[50:23] this Comfort or that comfort I recognize
[50:27] what's going on and I said no I don't
[50:30] want this this is not part of me this is
[50:32] not part of the word of God and I rebuke
[50:35] the thing and if I have to stay there
[50:37] like the the the shotgun with in the
[50:39] rabbit's hole and stay there amen thus
[50:42] sayeth the Lord thus sayeth the Lord
[50:44] I'll stay right there until that thing
[50:47] moves I mean I prayed for an hour
[50:51] sometimes when a devil's attacking me
[50:53] and I prayed for an hour and and I stay
[50:56] right there until it moves and speak
[50:59] that
[51:01] word oh he attacks you in your mind and
[51:05] tries to put
[51:07] doubt but you need to take that word and
[51:10] speak it
[51:12] Hallelujah Proverbs 3:20 I mean
[51:16] 3032 speak good to your spouse your
[51:20] children your brothers and your sisters
[51:23] and you will see the fruits of it
[51:26] germinate
[51:28] Hallelujah the Bible says that we when
[51:31] we declare a thing it shall come to
[51:35] pass if we continue to believe in job
[51:38] 22:28 if we continue to believe what we
[51:42] speak what we declare around our lives
[51:46] it will come to pass when we don't know
[51:51] unless God reveals it but we stay right
[51:54] there on our confession because he is
[51:58] the high priest of our
[52:01] confession he looked at what you said
[52:04] you say unto this mountain you speak to
[52:07] the rock you speak to the situation and
[52:11] he is the high priest upon your
[52:13] confession and what you're
[52:16] speaking it's not for us to figure out
[52:20] how he's going to do it when he's going
[52:23] to do it it's us to believe believe that
[52:25] he's going to do it because he's already
[52:28] done it like I always said when God
[52:31] reveals something it's already
[52:34] here it's not
[52:36] coming amen it's here the Rapture is not
[52:42] coming it's here it's manifesting here
[52:46] right
[52:47] now and when this Dimension starts
[52:50] breaking and the scales start lifting
[52:52] off your eyes amen and your heart heart
[52:55] starts receiving the word because your
[52:58] life is getting into position you'll
[53:00] recognize that the Rapture is here
[53:03] that's what's going to move us into the
[53:05] translation the angels are here the
[53:08] cloud of witnesses are here
[53:13] tonight because this
[53:16] flesh
[53:19] amen blocks us from seeing
[53:22] it but God said your soul will see
[53:28] it have you noticed in Revelations
[53:32] 22:7 and he said the spirit and the
[53:35] bride say
[53:37] come and let him that hear it say
[53:40] come see the bride speaks the same word
[53:45] as does the
[53:47] spirit she is a word bride proven she
[53:52] has the spirit in every Church age we
[53:57] hear these words he that had an ear let
[54:00] him
[54:01] hear you see everyone in the message
[54:05] will hear the word they will hear words
[54:09] they will understand words but Jesus is
[54:12] saying
[54:13] here he that had an ear let him
[54:17] hear so there's something different than
[54:21] what the ministers are saying there's
[54:23] something different that's being
[54:25] revealed to the Bride of Jesus Christ
[54:27] that is opening up to her heart remember
[54:30] Jesus said flesh and blood has not
[54:32] revealed it unto you man cannot reveal
[54:34] it theology cannot reveal it to you but
[54:38] my father the spirit has revealed it
[54:40] unto you and he's saying he that has an
[54:42] ear let him hear what the spirit is
[54:45] saying I believe the spirit is saying
[54:48] something
[54:50] Hallelujah glory to
[54:53] God what the Spirit say to the churches
[54:56] the spirit gives the word if you have
[54:59] the spirit you will hear the word for
[55:03] your
[55:04] age and those true Christians took the
[55:07] word for their
[55:11] age now we always when
[55:14] we listen to
[55:16] this we always think in our minds I
[55:19] heard the word for my
[55:21] age I heard brother brandham
[55:26] I heard brother brandham that's the word
[55:27] for my age and then they live contrary
[55:31] to the word of God they're not producing
[55:33] the word of God
[55:35] no like we said at the
[55:38] beginning God provides the voice for
[55:41] every hour and he meets the need of the
[55:45] hour this is a different
[55:48] age this is the bride
[55:51] age so what are you saying brother Tim
[55:54] the the message is different than what
[55:55] God's revealing now no it's not
[55:59] different God is revealing his word to
[56:03] this age and the portion of word that he
[56:06] spoke remember Jesus in his ministry did
[56:09] he fulfill everything no he didn't
[56:13] fulfill everything he fulfilled what he
[56:14] needed to fulfilled and the rest was
[56:16] left off for the church to fulfill did
[56:19] the prophet fulfill everything
[56:22] no it was left off for us the bride in
[56:26] this age to
[56:28] fulfill and that's what I'm talking
[56:32] about there ain't no great man there
[56:34] ain't nobody coming with some great
[56:37] Revelation it's what God has released
[56:39] through the opening of The Seven Seals
[56:42] that are here and he the spirit of Truth
[56:45] is taking it and revealing it to us as
[56:51] individuals that's what's taking place
[56:54] he that has an ear to hear the spirit
[56:57] the voice of God for this
[56:58] day Ephesians
[57:01] 4:29 let no corrupt communication
[57:04] proceed up to your mouth but he but that
[57:07] which is good and use of edifying that
[57:11] it may Minister Grace unto the hearer
[57:14] and grieve not the holy spirit of God
[57:17] whereby you're sealed until the day of
[57:19] your
[57:19] Redemption
[57:21] Hallelujah we always think oh grieve not
[57:24] the holy spirit let no corrupt
[57:26] communication come out of your mouth so
[57:28] we think oh we're talking about this
[57:30] we're talking about that or we're
[57:31] cursing or we're swearing yeah those
[57:32] things are bad the Holy Ghost won't
[57:34] allow you to say those things amen or
[57:37] he'll deal with you but he's not talking
[57:39] about that here hallelujah he's talking
[57:42] about don't speak another word for
[57:45] another
[57:46] age keep silent until you see the word
[57:49] for this age in this hour and God will
[57:53] reveal it to you what he's doing doing
[57:55] if you are in the word and you're
[57:57] listening to the word he'll reveal it to
[58:01] you he promised it I can't bring up all
[58:05] the scriptures that around it if you're
[58:07] in the Bible and you know your Bible oh
[58:11] you must more more people know the
[58:13] quotes more people know what brother
[58:15] Bram said than what Jesus said and what
[58:19] the word said what the Apostle
[58:23] said just like when brother Bram said
[58:25] more more know about Santa Claus than
[58:27] Jesus Christ and shame on them but shame
[58:31] on the message when you know more about
[58:33] the quotes than you know about him it's
[58:36] KN him that's life you say oh brother
[58:40] Tim the message is the
[58:43] Bible my brothers wake
[58:46] up wake
[58:50] up we have to take the quotes and not
[58:54] preach preach and put our interpretation
[58:56] on the quotes those quotes when you
[58:59] preach got to line up with the word and
[59:02] the word got to testify of it because we
[59:05] know as we've
[59:07] heard and I'm bold to say it because
[59:10] it's been spoken
[59:11] already as Paul said I'm bold they were
[59:15] bold to
[59:16] speak and we've
[59:18] heard Hallelujah that brother Brandon
[59:21] had to
[59:22] grow oh my he had to grow in
[59:26] faith Hallelujah even himself said that
[59:31] I know for sure in the token message go
[59:33] back to it I know for sure that this
[59:36] token message that God gave me those
[59:39] seals in those Church age were directly
[59:41] from the from God
[59:43] himself all the other things were just
[59:46] inspired you know what all the other
[59:48] things were just a man of God growing
[59:50] into his position and recognizing his
[59:52] position did he not say could this be
[59:56] the Malachi
[59:57] 45 and then he saysure down the road
[1:00:01] sure looks like Malachi 45 and then when
[1:00:04] he came to the end he said this is
[1:00:06] Malachi 45 so there was a progression of
[1:00:09] faith that was taken
[1:00:11] place oh my listen
[1:00:14] tonight Hallelujah hear the word of the
[1:00:18] Lord amen Proverbs
[1:00:21] 18:21 our words have the power to build
[1:00:24] up people and to give them life or tear
[1:00:28] people down and bring them to death
[1:00:31] spiritual death the words we speak can
[1:00:34] Inspire or encourage others while the
[1:00:36] same sentence can deflate discourage and
[1:00:40] Destroy and that's not just using
[1:00:44] negative words to them that's taking the
[1:00:47] word of God without a revelation and
[1:00:50] speak in death into

[1:17:02] traditional voices religious voices
[1:17:06] false Doctrine voices satanic voices
[1:17:09] false believed voices the power of
[1:17:12] tradition Jesus said you and your
[1:17:14] Traditions make the word of God of none
[1:17:17] effect that's a message in
[1:17:20] itself the power of tradition that we
[1:17:23] keep in our
[1:17:26] lives we're not to take the word like
[1:17:30] the Pharisees and Sadducees where was
[1:17:32] the Pharisees and Sadducees in the Old
[1:17:35] Testament where were they they're spoken
[1:17:37] of by Jesus but God did not set them
[1:17:41] up they were man-made Traditions rabbis
[1:17:45] were man-made Traditions if you go back
[1:17:49] in
[1:17:50] history a lot of man-made traditions
[1:17:52] chrans amen we take from the church ages
[1:17:56] and we bring it in here
[1:17:58] now and Jesus is saying you and your
[1:18:01] Traditions I'm not talking about
[1:18:03] Christmas traditions and all the
[1:18:05] Traditions that you have I mean when the
[1:18:07] word of God and the Holy Ghost and the
[1:18:10] new birth comes in your life it does it
[1:18:12] automatically it starts speaking to you
[1:18:14] it starts dealing with those traditions
[1:18:16] and taking those desires of the world
[1:18:19] your family your natural family all
[1:18:21] those things that he is not pleasing to
[1:18:23] him for the word that is in set inside
[1:18:26] of you to fulfill anything that gets in
[1:18:28] the way of that word that's inside of
[1:18:30] you he deals with it and separates it
[1:18:34] from you we're all
[1:18:36] different just like in a high calling
[1:18:39] he'll let other people get away with
[1:18:41] this but not you get away with it he'll
[1:18:43] let other people Prosper but not you but
[1:18:45] he'll he'll He he'll it's pleasing to
[1:18:48] him to supply your needs every day day
[1:18:51] by day it's according to the way God in
[1:18:55] his mind has planted and that's what the
[1:18:59] Revelation when it comes to you and
[1:19:01] what's pleasing to God Amen that when
[1:19:04] you recognize that and then at the end
[1:19:07] of The High Calling how many thousands
[1:19:09] of ways that God chooses to deal with
[1:19:12] you that may puzzle you Hallelujah do we
[1:19:16] still get puzzled in the things that
[1:19:18] happen and the way God deals with us but
[1:19:21] when you come to a place where you are
[1:19:23] pleased just
[1:19:25] imagine you wonder why the Bible says
[1:19:28] Rejoice through your trials and trouble
[1:19:30] oh my getting to that place I'm telling
[1:19:32] you there's great Victory happening when
[1:19:34] you can Rejoice through your trials and
[1:19:36] trouble where you can be pleased way the
[1:19:38] god deals with
[1:19:40] you
[1:19:45] Hallelujah sometimes he deals with you
[1:19:48] really
[1:19:50] rough to get you to that place
[1:19:54] Place
[1:19:58] Hallelujah brother Bram speaking here
[1:20:00] going to just pick and choose here as
[1:20:02] we're getting ready to wind her
[1:20:05] down and um the LEC in church
[1:20:09] age yes sir the church is no longer the
[1:20:12] mouthpiece of God it's its own
[1:20:16] mouthpiece I wonder if the message has
[1:20:18] got to that
[1:20:19] place the
[1:20:21] message got to that place I'm not
[1:20:23] talking about the
[1:20:26] bride I have a clear Revelation and it's
[1:20:28] getting clearer and clearer that there's
[1:20:30] a difference between the bride and the
[1:20:33] message and I believe what I see my
[1:20:37] opinion and I have a right to my
[1:20:39] opinion I believe when brother brand
[1:20:41] said go back to your
[1:20:44] denomination and be a light I believe
[1:20:47] that's being fulfilled right now in the
[1:20:49] message where the bride is in that
[1:20:52] denominational spirit nickan Spirit go
[1:20:57] study what the nickan spirit is and that
[1:21:00] denomination spirit and what it really
[1:21:02] does and how it operates and where it
[1:21:04] came
[1:21:05] from brother bradam had to be the seven
[1:21:09] Church age
[1:21:11] messenger he had to come to them that
[1:21:14] was his calling but his life his
[1:21:18] Revelation never joined with them his
[1:21:22] Spirit never never joined with them but
[1:21:24] he tried to pull as many as he could in
[1:21:27] he was a light outside of that he was a
[1:21:30] light to the
[1:21:32] denominations
[1:21:34] hallelujah oh glory to God
[1:21:40] Amen yes it is for it says in the last
[1:21:43] chapter of Revelation 17 the spirit and
[1:21:46] the bride say come once more the world
[1:21:49] will hear directly from God as it did
[1:21:51] Pentecost now he has cried out in this
[1:21:54] last age you have the word you have more
[1:21:57] Bibles you have all the
[1:22:01] quotes all the
[1:22:07] tapes but what are you
[1:22:11] doing you're not doing anything about
[1:22:16] it but you're taking the word and
[1:22:20] dividing it and hacking it into pieces
[1:22:22] taking what you want and leaving out
[1:22:25] what you want and what you don't
[1:22:28] want you're not interested in living
[1:22:31] it but debate in
[1:22:34] it my Lord
[1:22:38] Jesus I don't got time to
[1:22:41] debate I never had that in my
[1:22:43] spirit to argue with
[1:22:49] somebody I would sooner you be cold or
[1:22:52] hot if you were cold or
[1:22:58] hot
[1:23:01] hallelujah
[1:23:03] amen let me just pass over a few things
[1:23:11] here then I
[1:23:13] heard a loud voice shouting across the
[1:23:17] heavens it has come at last salvation
[1:23:21] and Power
[1:23:23] and the kingdoms of our God and the
[1:23:25] authorities of his Christ for the
[1:23:28] accuser of the brothers and sisters have
[1:23:30] been thrown down to the Earth the one
[1:23:33] who accused them before God day and
[1:23:36] night Revelations
[1:23:38] 1210 Hallelujah God's words are wise
[1:23:42] Beyond human wisdom for he is the sour
[1:23:45] source of all wisdom but that doesn't
[1:23:48] mean that his words always make sense
[1:23:51] according to human wisdom or will be
[1:23:54] popular in the world's eyes spiritual
[1:23:57] truth is understood spiritually through
[1:23:59] the work of the Holy Spirit and sometime
[1:24:02] God's word sounds foolishness to those
[1:24:06] who don't know him people who are aren't
[1:24:10] spiritual can't receive these truths
[1:24:12] from the spirit it sounds all
[1:24:15] foolishness to them and they can't
[1:24:17] understand it for those who are
[1:24:20] spiritual can understand what the spirit
[1:24:23] means those who are spiritual can
[1:24:26] Elevate all things but they themselves
[1:24:30] cannot be elevated by others for who can
[1:24:34] know the Lord's thoughts who knows
[1:24:37] enough to teach him about his word think
[1:24:41] about
[1:24:43] it 1 Corinthians
[1:24:46] 2:14 for just as the heavens are higher

[1:25:05] miss the call of
[1:25:07] God we need not to be afraid of that God
[1:25:12] himself has promised to those who seek
[1:25:15] Him will find him and those who belong

[1:30:41] are many voices in this present
[1:30:44] generation there is the voice of human
[1:30:47] reason there is a voice of innocent
[1:30:50] blood the voice of of politicians and
[1:30:53] even the voice of the martyrs however
[1:30:56] the one voice that has not yet been
[1:30:59] heard in its fullness or entirety now
[1:31:03] listen is the voice of the
[1:31:07] Bride Revelations
[1:31:10] 1823 States the light of the lamp will
[1:31:14] not shine in you any longer and the
[1:31:18] voice of the bridegroom and the bride
[1:31:20] will not be heard in you any longer for
[1:31:23] the merchants were the Great Men of the
[1:31:25] Earth because all nations were deceived
[1:31:28] by the arts practice or the Spells of
[1:31:32] persons who are supposed to exercise
[1:31:34] Supernatural Powers through the aid of
[1:31:37] evil spirits this P this passage clearly
[1:31:41] outlines a season of time in which the
[1:31:45] voice of the bridegroom will distinctly
[1:31:48] Express clearly efficiently through the
[1:31:52] bride and a certain time for it to
[1:31:59] cease oh my where are we where are
[1:32:04] we throughout the Earth there is
[1:32:08] religious and politician spirits that
[1:32:10] the Bible identifies as mystery Babylon
[1:32:13] nevertheless in the midst of this
[1:32:15] ungodly system the holy spirit will
[1:32:20] release great praise and worship
[1:32:22] expressions of God's cre creative
[1:32:24] ability and distinctions of his true
[1:32:28] voice in the word bride
[1:32:31] today oh he
[1:32:34] will she will seek
[1:32:36] clearly his voice she will not be
[1:32:41] deceived if it were possible it would
[1:32:43] deceive the very
[1:32:46] elect
[1:32:48] where where just think about it where
[1:32:52] would it be
[1:32:54] possible
[1:32:56] Hallelujah come on
[1:32:59] musicians my last quote
[1:33:02] here
[1:33:06] actually I got two quotes
[1:33:14] here one one
[1:33:16] came inspired to me and the other one is
[1:33:20] brother bradam just give me a few
[1:33:22] minutes more and we'll be
[1:33:26] done perfect faith is not on the
[1:33:33] tapes
[1:33:35] no perfect faith is in the word of
[1:33:41] God and his word is in the bride of
[1:33:45] Christ and because she has the revealed
[1:33:48] word of God in her she becomes comes the
[1:33:52] voice of God for this rapturing
[1:33:57] age it is the word of
[1:34:00] God made flesh again
[1:34:03] today she is the final
[1:34:06] voice and God will reveal
[1:34:09] all the truth that will bring a body
[1:34:13] change to
[1:34:15] her and in
[1:34:17] her it is now the spirit of God in her
[1:34:20] speaking and crying out come out of her
[1:34:23] my people be not
[1:34:26] partakers of that
[1:34:28] Nicko and denominational
[1:34:31] spirit in the churches
[1:34:36] today has taken up the spirit of
[1:34:40] organism systems setting up their
[1:34:43] churches to duplicate and leaving the
[1:34:46] power of God in the
[1:34:50] word
[1:34:52] remember Satan
[1:34:54] said brother Braham said that Satan will
[1:34:57] try to make the church powerless formal
[1:35:02] lukewarm that's his
[1:35:05] goal and nothing down Through the Ages
[1:35:09] has killed brother Braham says the
[1:35:13] church but when they
[1:35:15] denominate oh we can never
[1:35:19] denominate don't be dis
[1:35:22] received recognize that
[1:35:26] Spirit now remember this Christ in the
[1:35:29] true church is the continuation of the
[1:35:32] book of
[1:35:34] Acts the book of Acts not any other
[1:35:39] book but the Book of Revelation shows
[1:35:42] how the Antichrist Spirit would come
[1:35:43] into the church and defile it making it
[1:35:45] lukew formal powerless it exposes Satan
[1:35:48] revealing his works his attempt
[1:35:50] destruction of on God's people and
[1:35:53] discrediting the word of God right down
[1:35:56] to the time he's cast into the Lake of
[1:35:58] Fire so he's doing it now he's doing it
[1:36:01] today and where is
[1:36:04] he brother brah said he's seen it and he
[1:36:08] tried to cut that devil's head off that
[1:36:10] snake but it sneaked right
[1:36:15] in right down to the time he cannot
[1:36:18] stand it he knows now listen he knows
[1:36:21] that if the people get a true revelation
[1:36:24] of the true church and what she is and
[1:36:28] what she stands for and that she can do
[1:36:31] the Greater Works she will be Invincible
[1:36:35] Army and they that get a true revelation
[1:36:38] of the two Spirits within the framework
[1:36:41] of the Christian church it's
[1:36:44] here it's already been spoken and
[1:36:47] prophesied we've heard it throughout the
[1:36:50] years
[1:36:53] Satan will be powerless before
[1:36:57] her he will be as a defeated warp today
[1:37:02] as Christ with stod every effort to gain
[1:37:04] power over him in the desert yes Satan
[1:37:07] hates Revelation but we love it with
[1:37:10] true Revelation in our lives the Gates
