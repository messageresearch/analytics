[2:29] name of jesus christ amen
[2:34] as we begin our study tonight
[2:39] on this topic of the ephesian
[2:44] church age we will begin
[2:47] by touching on this city
[2:50] the great city of ephesus
[2:55] now we realize that this is not a
[2:58] word for word commentary
[3:02] on the seven church ages but we will
[3:06] certainly
[3:07] take our liberty to be able to declare
[3:11] the word of god as we see it
[3:15] using the background and the
[3:19] setting and backdrop
[3:22] of the wisdom and knowledge given by
[3:25] god through his divine
[3:28] prophet you may put it this way
[3:32] i am saying what he says
[3:35] for god's glory and honor
[3:38] now we know that this great city of
[3:41] ephesus
[3:42] is one of the three great cities
[3:46] [Music]
[3:47] mentioned in the new testament
[3:52] in the area of asia
[3:55] one of the three great cities
[3:58] of asia
[4:01] it was often called the
[4:04] third city of the christian
[4:07] faith jerusalem of course
[4:11] is always mentioned as the first
[4:15] city of the christian base
[4:19] after which comes this great
[4:22] city of ephesus
[4:26] followed by antioch
[4:29] the city of antioch
[4:33] it was known in its day and time
[4:36] of being a very rich city
[4:40] rich in every respect culturally
[4:44] financially uh people-wise diversity
[4:49] of nations uh that sort of thing
[4:52] ephesus was indeed a very
[4:55] rich city the government
[4:59] of that city was roman
[5:04] the language of the city
[5:07] was greek
[5:10] very important for the romans gave
[5:13] us the roads and laws and of course
[5:18] the the greeks gave us the language
[5:21] the laws and the roads to be able to
[5:25] take or transport the gospel was given
[5:28] by the romans
[5:30] and the greeks with their language
[5:32] facilitate
[5:33] the dispersal of it also
[5:37] now we real historians do believe
[5:42] that john mary peter andrew and philip
[5:45] were all buried in this great
[5:48] city this beautiful city
[5:52] of ephesus now
[5:56] we to looking at the city of ephesus
[6:01] we must be able to extract
[6:04] our understanding because
[6:07] this city is a precursor of the age
[6:11] that is to come it gives us a picture
[6:15] an analogy when we look at the city and
[6:20] what the city was
[6:21] what occurred in the city what actually
[6:25] was displayed in the city it helps us to
[6:28] understand
[6:29] the age and what the age will be like
[6:33] what would be displayed in the age what
[6:36] we have to look for
[6:37] in this age that is here to come
[6:42] now first of all look at the city of
[6:45] ephesus
[6:46] its reputation look
[6:49] upon the city and look at its
[6:52] religion then look upon the city of
[6:57] ephesus
[6:58] and see its culture
[7:01] that controlled the minds and thoughts
[7:05] of the people in that day
[7:08] look upon its quality and customs
[7:12] that also dominated that
[7:16] hour and that time that they
[7:19] were living in the language we mentioned
[7:23] which was
[7:24] greek it was commonly greek of course
[7:27] people spoke their different individual
[7:30] languages but the main language
[7:35] for business for any form
[7:38] of public public understanding
[7:42] was the language of greek
[7:46] when we look at the city of ephesus we
[7:49] must also
[7:50] take into mind at the legacy that that
[7:54] city left for that
[7:57] legacy that the city left was a
[8:00] legacy that would influence
[8:03] future ages that were to come
[8:08] now paul was the one
[8:12] who founded the true faith
[8:15] in this great city of ephesus
[8:20] and he loved that city and even when he
[8:24] was away from that city and his mind
[8:27] turned to the great city of ephesus
[8:31] how that he continually
[8:35] prayed for them that the
[8:38] hand of god will be with them
[8:42] and upon them of course
[8:45] paul pastored the church in ephesus
[8:48] for about a period of about three years
[8:53] now we understand paul being uh
[8:56] pastoring it means that paul
[9:00] came to ephesus as
[9:03] a missionary and as a real missionary
[9:08] he spent three years pastoring
[9:12] founding and pastoring this church
[9:16] that he had founded in the city
[9:20] of ephesus now while pastoring
[9:24] while being a missionary while
[9:26] ministering the word of god
[9:28] he was watchful mindful
[9:32] and waiting for god to reveal to him
[9:36] who would be the local pastor
[9:39] or bishop for you know the word pastor
[9:43] bishop is the same thing it's not
[9:46] as the modern interpretation of a bishop
[9:50] being someone above pastors but
[9:53] that a pastor is a bishop a bishop
[9:56] is a local pastor and so here
[9:59] he was ministering god's word
[10:03] to the people of ephesus and
[10:06] while paul was doing this
[10:10] spiritually he had his eye of
[10:13] discernment
[10:14] and his eye of faith waiting on god to
[10:18] reveal to him
[10:20] who would be the pastor after that
[10:24] he leaves ephesus to go
[10:27] on with his great missionary
[10:31] journey we understand from the bible
[10:35] from the scriptures
[10:37] that timothy who had the great faith of
[10:42] his
[10:42] grandmother and mother
[10:46] placed in his heart from the time that
[10:49] he was a child
[10:51] where he spent his time thinking
[10:55] and talking about the lord
[10:58] in first timothy chapter 1 verses
[11:02] 1 to 3 we read
[11:05] paul an apostle of jesus christ by the
[11:09] commandment of god
[11:11] our savior and the lord jesus christ
[11:15] which is our hope unto timothy
[11:19] my own son in faith you see
[11:23] timothy became converted by paul's
[11:26] ministry
[11:28] so he calls timothy his son
[11:31] in the faith grace
[11:35] and mercy and peace from
[11:38] god our father and jesus christ our lord
[11:44] as i besought thee to abide
[11:47] still at ephesus then
[11:50] i went into macedonia
[11:55] that thou might discharge
[11:58] some that they teach
[12:01] no other doctrine
[12:04] of course i will not touch on that but
[12:06] already
[12:07] paul was seeing the very appearance of
[12:10] those
[12:11] religious spirits trying to invade the
[12:15] faith
[12:15] and teach some other doctrine
[12:19] some other teachings those spirits were
[12:21] already there
[12:23] and he was already advising timothy
[12:26] to be aware of these
[12:29] demonic powers the seductive
[12:33] and enticing spirit that would
[12:36] invade the faith and that he timothy
[12:40] as the local bishop was to stand with
[12:44] the original
[12:45] word as was delivered by
[12:49] him paul no wonder he later said
[12:52] though an angel were to come down from
[12:55] heaven
[12:56] and say or try to say anything
[12:59] different from what i have said then you
[13:02] commit him to be a curse by the spirit
[13:06] of almighty
[13:07] god now the very
[13:10] name ephesus has a compound meaning to
[13:14] it meaning
[13:15] spiritual naturally and also as
[13:19] a spiritual meaning to it
[13:22] the name speaks of one
[13:25] aim that or what one is
[13:28] aspiring to or aiming to
[13:32] accomplish see the name
[13:35] ephesus means aim that aspired to
[13:39] reaching out to it also
[13:42] means relaxed showing a different
[13:45] from your aspiration to getting a
[13:48] relaxed
[13:49] laid-back attitude and slowly
[13:53] beginning to drift away from
[13:56] your original aspiration
[13:59] and aim now it began with the
[14:03] fullness of the spirit it began with the
[14:07] depths of god with the great anointing
[14:11] and
[14:11] leadership of the spirit of god
[14:15] and they were aiming at this
[14:18] high calling of the saints that was
[14:22] in god and
[14:25] that began to slowly
[14:28] slip away from them
[14:31] and to give way to a less
[14:35] watchful attitude in the presence of god
[14:39] of course a less ardent
[14:44] attitude towards the word of god
[14:47] began to be manifested
[14:50] among the saints of god
[14:53] of course that was a sign and oh man
[14:57] towards the future ages
[15:01] of what they would be
[15:04] how that the church which we know
[15:07] is the physical vehicle by which
[15:11] god makes himself manifested
[15:15] and showing how the true church
[15:18] the physical manifestation of the spirit
[15:21] of god
[15:22] would slowly begin to drift away
[15:26] from the things of god from the depths
[15:29] of god
[15:31] right into the depths of satan
[15:34] or satanism drifting away completely
[15:39] becoming relaxed becoming
[15:43] one that is drifting away
[15:46] from the original foundations
[15:51] already we see the spirit and attitude
[15:55] action of apostasy backsliding
[15:59] taking place in this the very
[16:02] first original church age
[16:06] the bible tells us you that it had
[16:10] left its first love its
[16:14] first love already was waning
[16:17] becoming still warm but becoming
[16:21] colder and colder as it drifted away
[16:25] from the original faith of god
[16:29] now that was a tiny seed planted by
[16:33] satan
[16:34] in that original first
[16:37] age which would later on
[16:40] grow into a spirit of
[16:43] error in the middle of the kingdom of
[16:46] god
[16:48] until the every fallen
[16:52] evil bird or spirit of that
[16:55] age would
[16:58] roost rest within the branches of
[17:04] that church isn't that just like the day
[17:08] in which we are living in
[17:10] where the church of god which should be
[17:13] a a seed of faith a a
[17:16] tree of faith a tree of
[17:19] faith and trust in god's
[17:22] word and his supernatural presence
[17:26] instead it becomes a tree
[17:30] that is a roost uh a refuge
[17:34] a hiding place for
[17:37] every foul unclean spirit
[17:41] every foul and unclean bird
[17:45] finds itself within those branches
[17:52] though they are found within those
[17:54] branches
[17:57] coming in as religious spirits
[18:01] they will make themselves
[18:04] appear to be inoffensive
[18:09] they seem so innocent
[18:13] so good that this
[18:17] plant would now become the new eve
[18:22] that is deceived by satan
[18:25] subtility by his
[18:28] wisdom in that day
[18:32] in which they were living in
[18:35] and would again be deceived by satan
[18:41] that ephesian church age
[18:44] represented to
[18:48] the church god's great
[18:51] opportunity for them to be able to
[18:56] aspire to reach out
[18:59] and to grasp the original faith
[19:04] it was theirs to be had
[19:07] but she prevailed only but for a while
[19:11] and after prevailing for a while then
[19:13] she began
[19:15] to relax and in that relaxed
[19:19] in that less vigilant that unguarded
[19:23] moment satan quickly planted
[19:27] within the framework of the church
[19:31] his seeds of ruin
[19:35] and complete destruction later on
[19:40] now in this city of ephesus
[19:43] the ruling religion
[19:46] or ruling faith except
[19:50] the tenor uh for the
[19:53] ages that were to come
[19:57] within this great beautiful city of
[20:00] ephesus was the great
[20:04] and beautiful noticeable
[20:08] placed on a high place the beautiful
[20:12] temple of the goddess diana
[20:17] and there were so many years in building
[20:20] it
[20:22] and how's within these sacred courts
[20:28] there was a lusterless
[20:31] and unobstrusive
[20:36] a picture of this great
[20:39] image or idol of diana
[20:44] the great at that time
[20:49] this image of course this great idol
[20:52] that was within these courts
[20:55] was unimaginable something that
[20:58] one could not imagine you would think of
[21:01] something
[21:02] magnificent but it was not
[21:05] at the time for it was
[21:08] simply the shapeless female
[21:12] figure that finally
[21:16] found itself as a block of wood
[21:20] from which this figure was guard
[21:25] two arms came out of this block of wood
[21:29] and those
[21:30] those two arms were made of iron
[21:35] and this of course uh perfectly
[21:39] portrays uh it
[21:42] figures out what would happen
[21:46] in the future ages
[21:49] how that the spirit of antichrist
[21:53] would be loosed in this first
[21:56] age of ephesus that
[22:00] is a pre-figure of
[22:04] revelation chapter 6 the
[22:07] opening of the first seal
[22:10] the white horse writer
[22:14] at this matter of fact shall be read
[22:17] out of the book of revelation
[22:20] chapter 6 as the bible
[22:24] reads to us verses 1
[22:29] and i saw when the lamb
[22:33] opened one of the seals and
[22:36] i heard as it were the
[22:39] noise of thunder and one of the four be
[22:43] saying
[22:44] come and see and i saw
[22:48] and behold the white horse and
[22:51] he that sat on him had a ball
[22:56] and that crown was given
[22:59] unto him and he went for conquering
[23:02] and to conquer revelation chapter 6
[23:06] verses 1 and two
[23:09] so under the first seal
[23:12] we see this spirit
[23:15] of antichrist being loosed
[23:18] or coming forth so
[23:22] suddenly as we see the white horse rider
[23:26] white being the uh a
[23:30] symbol of righteousness of religion
[23:33] and the faith showing that this horse
[23:36] rider
[23:37] this evil one would come under
[23:40] the guise or disguise of
[23:43] faith as if he was a believer
[23:46] and writing on religion
[23:50] he would come him acting as if he has
[23:53] the word of god
[23:55] he has a bow but no arrows
[23:58] he's going forth to conquer but not
[24:01] out there he is really going to conquer
[24:05] the people of god the kingdom of god
[24:08] yes sir here he was the conqueror
[24:12] by this seat that was his purpose
[24:16] to conquer by the seat on that
[24:19] white horse of religion
[24:22] there is the deceit that comes from
[24:25] appearing so
[24:27] innocent and
[24:30] appearing to be so harmonious
[24:35] along with the original fate
[24:38] that was there he would make himself
[24:40] appear to be
[24:41] harmonious with it
[24:45] and create this atmosphere of an
[24:48] innocent religious appearance
[24:53] as i've said this was a wooden idol
[24:58] with two arms that were made
[25:02] of iron this idol of wood
[25:06] the arms were made of iron so it
[25:09] appeared innocent
[25:11] but once it got a hold of the
[25:14] individuals
[25:15] it would hold them with arms that were
[25:18] bands of iron and control them
[25:22] and crushed them and hold them
[25:26] to itself see back then
[25:31] while appearing as wood
[25:34] no one would notice its ability
[25:38] its power to crush and to
[25:41] destroy and that way he will be able
[25:44] satan will be able to make inroads
[25:48] in the kingdom of god
[25:51] of what he wanted to do but one day
[25:55] they would come to notice that his
[25:58] deeds his deeds that were unacknowledged
[26:02] unnoticed would become
[26:06] doctrines his deeds would become
[26:09] doctrines
[26:10] and then manipulation of the government
[26:14] figures will turn his doctrines
[26:18] into deeds
[26:21] into actions he could take action
[26:24] by and through his doctrine
[26:27] and from that he will then go a little
[26:30] further
[26:31] and turn his deeds into laws
[26:36] where the uh civil
[26:39] or federal government will then be able
[26:43] to
[26:43] end act his deeds his
[26:46] doctrines as law then be able to
[26:51] command and control even
[26:54] those who claim they do not believe to
[26:57] force them to believe with his
[27:01] bands of iron he will be able to crush
[27:04] them
[27:05] if they do not claim what it is
[27:08] that he was and his teaching
[27:11] at this time now the order the temple
[27:15] worship was
[27:16] very revealing there were first of all
[27:20] priests who were eunuchs
[27:24] the priests were not allowed to marry
[27:29] visibly they were not allowed to marry
[27:32] there's priesthood was sterile
[27:36] and this terrible priesthood
[27:39] my friends it was a pre-figure
[27:44] of how god's people would become so
[27:47] sterile
[27:48] the word of god would be so taken away
[27:51] from them
[27:51] until they will become so sterile that
[27:54] they would drift away from the word of
[27:58] god
[27:58] but still yet believing that they had it
[28:01] but they would
[28:02] actually have drifted away from the
[28:05] original
[28:06] i believe that's happening right now
[28:08] while we speak
[28:09] that we who have received the message of
[28:12] the hour
[28:12] from the prophet of malachi 4 5 god's
[28:16] people
[28:17] are drifting away from that original
[28:21] message my friends drifting away
[28:24] into what they think or claim to be
[28:27] the word of god but really
[28:30] it's far from the original truth
[28:33] from which they receive
[28:37] and now entering into that period
[28:41] where they're drifting from that message
[28:44] from the word of god given by god's
[28:47] sermon and prophet
[28:49] into a life of spiritual barrenness
[28:53] baron yes because we are drifted from
[28:57] the world
[28:58] we are not feeding on the original word
[29:01] of god
[29:02] and they become what sterile
[29:06] messengers sterile a sterile
[29:10] priesthood that does not
[29:13] have the original faith anymore
[29:16] in it it has nothing to pass on
[29:21] it has no life to give none
[29:24] whatsoever for it has become sterile
[29:28] drifting from the original truth
[29:32] of the faith or revelation
[29:35] of the word of god secondly
[29:38] we find out that that temple had
[29:42] within its confines
[29:45] virgin priestesses
[29:48] who claim that they
[29:51] were one with diana
[29:55] and that there were virgins
[29:58] yes this showed the day
[30:01] would come when
[30:05] farm ceremony
[30:08] ritual and works would then
[30:11] take the place of the great holy spirit
[30:15] over the church of the living god
[30:19] there will be no more charismatic
[30:22] manifestation
[30:23] no holy spirit growth
[30:26] and manifestation or action or
[30:29] demonstrations
[30:30] amongst the people because the holy
[30:33] spirit himself
[30:34] will be pushed out of the church the
[30:37] very
[30:38] original people that accepting god's
[30:42] patriarchs prophets and
[30:45] of late receive god's prophet's
[30:48] messenger
[30:49] of this hour has come to the point
[30:54] where they have believed that they are
[30:56] no more
[30:57] pentecostal in origin
[31:01] but that they are different from being
[31:04] pentecostal in origin
[31:06] which and i'm speaking of your old
[31:08] original pentecost
[31:10] acts 2 4 right on right from there
[31:14] not this modern day
[31:17] nonsense that we see being carried out
[31:20] but my friends
[31:22] we've got to come back to the original
[31:24] faith
[31:25] back to the original word the original
[31:27] pattern the original blueprint
[31:30] what paul had and be able to say like
[31:33] god's servant
[31:34] i preach what paul preached i preached
[31:37] under the same
[31:38] inspiration i preach under the same
[31:41] anointing
[31:42] in the same atmosphere where the people
[31:45] are free to praise and glorify the name
[31:48] of
[31:48] god and to prophesy and to speak in
[31:52] towns if necessary to be in the spirit
[31:55] to act as if they are in the spirit we
[31:58] are
[31:59] in the spirit of almighty god
[32:02] not in the spirit of diana or the
[32:05] denominations
[32:06] of this day and of this time
[32:10] now thirdly in this temple
[32:14] of diana remember the central figure
[32:19] being a woman diana over
[32:22] them they had certainly a
[32:25] high priest there was this high
[32:28] priest a man of high position
[32:33] a man of political power
[32:36] and a man of public influence
[32:41] pro-training and showing manifesting
[32:44] already
[32:45] what was already in progress
[32:48] satan had put his plans already in
[32:52] progress
[32:53] and his his evil was manifesting itself
[32:58] within the very house of god
[33:02] this of course was showing that one day
[33:06] the church of god which was supposed to
[33:09] be led
[33:10] by the spirit of god would be
[33:13] wholly given over towards the
[33:17] leadership teachings doctrines darkness
[33:21] deeds of man rather than the
[33:25] inspiration or revelation
[33:29] of the holy spirit which they would
[33:32] place it
[33:33] as if it's out of order it's not within
[33:36] the
[33:37] registered system it's not acceptable
[33:41] anymore for he would use his
[33:44] laws his doctrines and deeds
[33:47] he would make into laws using those laws
[33:50] to outlaw deregister
[33:54] delegitimize the genuine true
[33:58] faith of the word of god
[34:01] and find her friends
[34:04] the leadership of man
[34:07] man's plans would become preeminent
[34:13] man's ambitions would become preeminent
[34:18] so controlling that it would be counted
[34:21] greater
[34:23] than thus saith the holy spirit of god
[34:28] and thus saith the lord or thus saint
[34:31] the holy spirit
[34:32] would no longer be a reality
[34:36] in the minds hearts and hearing
[34:39] of the people where their hearing will
[34:41] be taken away from them
[34:43] for hearing they will hear nothing
[34:45] seeing they would see not
[34:47] they will not recognize the word of god
[34:50] for their day
[34:52] and for their time
[34:55] underneath fourthly underneath all of
[34:58] this within the temple
[35:00] there were also temple slaves as i'm
[35:03] beginning to try to wind this up there
[35:06] were also
[35:07] masses of temple slaves within
[35:11] the the temple of diana
[35:14] and these type of slaves had no other
[35:19] uh cure but to obey
[35:23] they had no other choice
[35:27] than to obey that which was given
[35:31] down to them by this
[35:34] man of high position through
[35:38] the sterile priesthood
[35:41] and so-called virgin priestesses
[35:46] they had to obey because they were
[35:50] controlled and ruled over by a religious
[35:53] hierarchy rather than by the
[35:57] holy spirit of almighty god
[36:01] what does this mean what does it mean
[36:04] it means that the day was looking for
[36:08] that the day would come
[36:10] when a vested chirp clergy
[36:13] by political maneuvering by
[36:17] state help by the substitution
[36:21] of the word of god by the substitution
[36:25] of the spirit of
[36:26] god for the creeds and dogmas
[36:29] of man human leadership
[36:33] would create an environment
[36:36] of religious enslavement over
[36:40] the laity while the religious
[36:43] leaders luxurated or lived
[36:47] lives of unimaginable
[36:50] luxury made or
[36:54] gained by ill-gotten
[36:57] wealth and enjoying their
[37:01] filthy pleasures the filthiness of
[37:05] sin and the wages of sin
[37:09] and instead of them
[37:13] living a life of humility like jesus
[37:15] like the apostles live
[37:18] they live lives of extreme luxury still
[37:21] claiming
[37:22] to be man of god still claiming to be
[37:24] holy
[37:25] still claiming to be carrying the word
[37:27] still claiming to serve god and being
[37:30] the voice of god
[37:31] my friends contrary to the will and word
[37:34] of god
[37:36] for originally the true church
[37:39] was meant to serve the poor
[37:42] and serve the people amen
[37:46] and up from their way they've twisted it
[37:49] around
[37:50] where the poor and the people
[37:54] are now serving them when the reality
[37:57] should be that they should be the
[38:01] servants
[38:02] of the poor and of the people instead
[38:06] may god bless these thoughts to your
[38:09] hearts
[38:10] may god quicken them to your mind
[38:14] may god implant them within
[38:18] your soul may they grow up in the trees
[38:21] of righteousness
[38:23] blessed is the man planted by the rivers
[38:26] of waters
[38:27] that he might grow up and be a great
[38:30] tree
[38:31] a tree of the righteousness of the
[38:33] living god
[38:35] so may the seeds of this word this
[38:38] message that we have taught here tonight
[38:41] under inspiration of the holy spirit
[38:44] take
[38:44] root within your heart and grow up for
[38:48] his glory and for his honor and praise
[38:50] in the name of our lord jesus christ god
[38:53] bless you my friends
[38:54] until we meet each other again next
[38:58] wednesday night
[38:59] when we touch upon the topic in this
[39:02] ephesian church age
[39:03] of jesus his messengers
[39:08] and his message may he praise and bless
[39:12] his
[39:12] own as we gather once again
[39:16] amen may god bless you
[39:37] [Music]
[39:47] you
