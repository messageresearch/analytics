TRANSCRIPT
========================================
from that perspective now you're seeing that God is revealing to you what he's doing and there's nothing greater than that and you know we could go back and you know you look back when Christ here was on the earth imagine the word was made flesh and he was walking amongst the people and he was fulfilling all the prophecies that were written of him and yet just a handful actually recognized what was actually happening that just blows my mind every time I think of it and that's why you know we want to be able to look at our present state of Christianity and see where we fit in right we want to see where we fit in and how we would have been identified had we been back in that day that's right we have recognize the word would we have been one of those that God had chosen to reveal his word to and to bring the word to life and this is what we're experiencing in this day we are we are living the word of God Amen we are experiencing Jesus Christ in our daily lives and activities and we're seeing him move in Supernatural ways if we are looking for it and we are under expectation but if we're living with the world and like the world and we're seeing the World Through The Eyes of the world that we're getting caught up with all of the the teaching of this world and the way they're looking at the word of God Through The Eyes of this world like they did back when Jesus was on the earth they missed it a million miles so imagine if we're looking through that perspective what are we seeing we're seeing a a world where people go to church on Sundays and we you know we get excited you know oh yes we belong to a church and you know it's all about you know and because I I meet with many Christians and you know and we get to talking and the things they'll start talking about is the things that they're doing and how they're contributing to society and what they belong to and the different ways that they contribute and that's wonderful and I encourage that and I say praise God that's wonderful you know but then what about Christ and what he's doing right now how do you see that oh W how how are you acknowledging that how are you um you know and that brings a totally different perspective and all of a sudden you're either going to meet resistance that's right because you know you start to tell them about well there's like 3,000 different denominations out there how can we possibly know for sure because when Christ came there was a lot of different teachings and a lot of different priests and and churches but yet they didn't recognize when he was actually here it was Christ do you see what I'm saying so we're we're blessed tonight that we're under the teaching of the ministry of this hour in Jesus Christ and what he's presently doing right now am amen so we started last Wednesday we we were talking about born in time destined for eternity and I'm not going to go back over everything that I went through last Wednesday um you know go back and see if you can watch it or listen to it by CD a lot of it there was a lot of inspiration in there and um you know I would even have to go back I believe in the power of Christ operating in the church do you like when I come to church and there's somebody preaching there I got faith that I'm going to pull not the man's ability but I'm going to pull on Christ through that vessel right and that's that's that's also the message of the hour that's also the real teaching of this hour and if you have caught that then you're not looking at the man you're listening for the voice right and and the inspiration because the five full ministry remember is Christ in the church amen operating in those fivefold operations of Pastor teacher evangelist Apostles Prophets amen am praise God so um go back and see what uh was preached last Wednesday and then we'll continue where we're at so um we're going to we're going to read the scripture let's go to the next um Slide the scripture says Ephesians 1: 17 to2 three that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give you unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him this is what we're doing this is what we're studying the eyes of your understanding be enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling it's not your calling it's not good neighbor's calling it's his calling right amen and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the Heavenly places far above all principality and power and might and Dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filth all in all let us pray father we want to thank you tonight Lord for this opportunity to study your word and to draw from it father all that you would have us to receive tonight open our understanding our hearts and our minds Lord uh let us just let go of the the the weak and and the cares of today and all the burdens that lay Upon Our Hearts and just rest and know that you can answer and provide every one of those needs if we just kneel at your feet and listen a while Grant we pray father in Jesus name amen God bless you s and so last week we're looking at how we actually came into time and how that you know if you have received the new birth and that you have an understanding of what it is to be born again then you have the spirit of Truth in you the spirit of Truth truth will guide you into all truth that's the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost cannot go against his own word remember that the minute that somebody says anything contrary to the word of God like you say to them well you need to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and they turn around and say it don't matter they have not got the spirit of Truth they have not got the Holy Spirit though they will claim to have the Holy Spirit and I tell you 95% of the Christian teaching out there believes in a trinity believes that God is three in one they they believe in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit they'll do the sign of the cross on them and so forth and you know I don't condemn those people and we should never condemn anybody okay but there's teachings and traditions and that's why when Jesus Christ was on the earth and he came and only a handful actually recognized who he was was because they had taken the word of God that they had studied so much and and and and created so many Doctrine and so much understanding on the word of God that their teaching made it of none effect to the people it just became of none effect because they came in with all kinds of you know today you've got like this the the the the the holy sacraments and you know these different uh uh communion and and you know first communion and Stu baptism of babies and so forth It's nowhere in the scripture and the Holy Spirit cannot lie he cannot lie God cannot lie can you imagine how can God possibly lie and and produce confusion and then say he's going to judge the people meanwhile he he allows this one to have this Doctrine and this teaching and then allow this one to have this understanding allow this one to have that understanding and say they're all fine how can it be he could not possibly be a just God oh but they want to say that no but you know all roads lead to Rome wrong God cannot go against his own word and so that's why the scripture here says that that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation revelation of the word of God Amen in the knowledge of him and he is the word and so um you know let's go to uh uh number 23 Faith so what we were looking at now we're going to take a look at um from time to Eternity and from coming from eternity into time and now going back to Eternity and all these time cycles and cycles that that that are going to come in that have come in and that are leading us up to here because through this and through the knowledge of understanding of God's Plan of Redemption understanding the time and the season is important you're going to need to know the season that we're in so that you can actually produce the word of the Season amen by by by Revelation by knowing what to do with the word right brother B said that we would come to a place where we would know what to do with the word and understand the word of God and so when we look at the Timeline we know God was in eternity before the creation and that's where we were before the foundations of this world if you're a son or a daughter of God there's never a time you were not a son or a daughter of God and so if you are born again and have the Revelation in the spirit of Truth is because God has opened your understanding that you were you're not just being taught history you're being brought back into the mind of God all right and so we came from eternity back there before God was even God because God means object of worship and then came the original Creation in Genesis 1:1 where the scripture said let there be and God created the heavens and the Earth period genesis1 right now there could have been billions of years from that Point that's why a lot of people talk about oh but the Bible 6,000 years how do you mean how do you explain that you know dinosaurs everything else we've talked about that before the fall actually came could have been billions of years next and so [Music] um there's a prehistoric age of unknown duration that's how we can actually look at it okay that you know there's no age element there was no time element until the fall took place until the fall happened that's when time actually started okay next slide and then there's the 6,000 years that we have now fulfilled we're actually 6,7 years into this cycle okay now you know there's there's calendars and we can't say it's 67 or whatever but we know that it's definitely over 6,000 years and so we are in borrowed time because we know for a fact that that's truth anyway because God sent us a prophet and gave us a revelation and then open the Seven Seals Christ came down to open those seals because that's just before the Rapture takes place so we know that these these seasons have taking place so let's let's go on and so God rested then a thousand years and we know that there's going to be the Millennium right so right you know right after the Rapture we go into the Millennium okay so it's been 6,000 years since Adam and Eve that's what you tell people that uh since Adam and Eve fell in the Garden of Eden it's been 6,000 years because Adam and Eve didn't die until after they disobeyed the word of God Amen it's when they disobeyed God's word that's when death entered in because he said the they you eat thereof ye shall surely die and death is time we're doing time right now amen because of the fall of our mama and papa In the Flesh next slide and so Adam and Eve was 6,000 years ago next slide then comes another 2,000 year cycle which is Noah right leading up to the flood which was 4,000 years ago from now 4,000 years ago okay so you understand the graph here then comes another 2,000 years after Noah which comes to Jesus Christ the word made flesh comes to the Earth Christ comes life death and resurrection and that was how many years ago 2,000 years ago right then comes the 2,000 years since Christ and that's from his resurrection 2,000 years ago to now and here we are at 2017 and we know that this age basically ends with the Rapture of the church praise God that's what we are fulfilling see we're right in that blue arrow right now we're actually in the Rapture and it's all already started what do you mean it's already started it's already started it's started for you the day you were born again by the revealed word of this hour am oh yeah that's when the Rapture started and that's the Revelation that you are actually going to manifest that is the word that you are going to fulfill that is the prophecy that you are going to fulfill in the word of God I get excited every time I think about that I because you know we're going to fulfill a portion of the word a lot of people say well what am I do it in the word what am I going to do in the word you need to know you're already doing it the day you receive the Holy Ghost the day you received this message the day you you you had a revelation that God that Christ was actually come down now to actually redeem his jewels redeem his his sons and daughters back in 1963 he decided Now's the Time and I'm coming down and there's a half hour of Silence that we're in right now and because it's Christ left the throne and there's silence in heaven when he's there there's a lot of worship going on oh you don't like worship down here just wait till you get up there you think it's too loud down here just wait till you get up there there's a lot of worship that goes on when Christ is in the midst because that's what we're experiencing now that's why when you come into the house of the Lord you get into that Spirit of worship and you get caught up into the Heavenly places that joy that you're experiencing that feeling of of release and being set free and that that that you know being caught up that's the presence of God Amen now I want you to multiply that by a eternity you can't even Paul says you eyes have not seen ears have not heard you have not experienced what God has in store for you we we get a little do drop every now and then praise God when we get that you know when when the Lord comes down from time to time you know and everybody has their personal moments and experiences with God okay but I can tell you one thing when you do have those those moments okay as you walk and then God comes down and he has a little visit with you let me tell you something if you had that experience you don't want to leave that experience that's right amen You Weep and cry and beg God to not let you have to go back to this Dimension here okay just those few times those times when you have it you the ones that know what I'm talking about you know you you just don't you just beg God don't don't let me have to go back to that again because that experience is is beyond you can't put words on it there's no nobody could people used to ask me because God when when the Lord called me out and gave me those those few times of experience those first few times it was like I've done drugs I've done whatever they had they don't even come close there's nothing on this Earth that can come close to God's love not one single thing on this Earth no where no how no way okay and that is what we can look forward to eyes have not seen ears have not heard what God has in store we're already in the midst of it and that leads us into the next Thousand-Year Millennium next slide right for the Thousand Years that we're going to be back here on this Earth because we go up in the Rapture and then we come back down so let's look at this go to the next slide after that eternity begins but the timeline let's look at those 2,000 year timeline Cycles because we're doing Bible study we want to see what took place we want to see how it types how it you know how it pertains to our day you can always look at everything back in history even looking back at Noah and see the whole type like Noah's uh experience types sort of like the Rapture you know what I mean like that experience of being called out from the world that's going to go into tribulation in in a way like Noah does type you know he types the foolish virgin it's Enoch that really typed the Rapture just before Noah right but you can see the compound revelation of God throughout the whole experience and everything that God was doing back in the history of each of these 2,000 Year events and so we know that Adam and Eve was 6,000 years ago 2,000 years go by and here comes Noah and then Genesis 3 like going back now and looking it How It All Leads up we see that there was the fall in Genesis 3 and there was Adam's seed and the serpent seed and we know that you know by now we all know that the original sin was not an apple that was eaten but it was actually an adultery that took place in the Garden of Eden when the serpent went and beguiled Eve that's scripture that serpent who beguiled Eve deceived and got her to you know have sex and and and therefore bring forth through procreation children because we were in the image of God and God all he had to do was speak Adam was in the image of God all Adam had to do was just like what the angel Gabriel did when it went to the Virgin Mary and said blessed art thou Thou shalt bring forth a son you know and told her that she's blessed is her womb and and so forth and and and you're going to have a son you're going to call his name Jesus right there that was the spoken word coming through an angel speaking it right into the womb of Mary and that's why she had a virgin birth well Adam all he had to do was look at Eve and say Eve bring forth Richard it it was it was like the the the the word of God but then comes the procreation through the fall through an adultery now all of a sudden Eve gets excited by this experience and goes and shows Adam and then Adam to save her knowing what was going on does the same thing that's why Christ a type took sin on him come in the flesh to redeem his wife Eve the woman the bride the church the church is always called The Bride right and so within that church are Sons and Daughters of God and so this whole process was being shown the Plan of Redemption was being shown right from the very beginning when Adam went took his wife took on sin and in order to redeem her right just like what Christ did for us and so there's two seeds now because Adam knew his wife and two children are born you got K you got able Cain is of that Wicked one the Bible says it you're of your father the devil he was a liar from the beginning who told the first lie Cain the serpent when he went to Eve and he says you shall surely not he added one word and said You shall surely not die when God said he shall surely die the day you eat thereof and she was deceived and therefore brought forth a seed that came from that serpent who was the devil possessed in a serpent and the nature came upon his son that's why you look at you know you look at families usually the nature of the father will come upon the children the nature of the mother comes upon the children right and so in the same way that nature of the fall through that adultery came down on the human race and that's why the Bible says we born in sin sin is unbelief what was the unbelief when they disobeyed God's word and that's why we're born in sin shaped in iniquity speaking lies right from the day we begin to speak you asked that child where did you put that I don't know are you telling me the truth yeah what's behind your back I don't know you see what I mean it's it's it's just the nature that's on the human race and people want to say that they can be perfect and that they can be righteous and that they can no you can't amen the only thing that's righteous about you is the Holy Ghost in you that's right that attribute of God that was placed in you from before the foundations of the world that's righteous that's the word that cannot disbelieve that's going back to God because it came from God heavens and earth will pass away but his word never will will it pass away and so now we look at these two lineages we've got Adam's seed and we've got serpent seed Adam seed the replacement was Seth because Abel was killed by his evil brother where did that Wicked Spirit of murder come from that can't come from God can't come from God next slide and then we see that there's the lineage you know that comes forth and all of those that were Adam's lineage they were God's were God's seed Adam's seed which was Christ seed the righteous seed the word would flow through and that's why that that God's seed is always met resistance because Cain also had you know his seed but then we can look and we can see types again in Enoch because Enoch was the seventh from Adam a type of the seventh Church age type of SE it's always you're always going to see seven through the scripture because seven is God's number of completion and Enoch was the seven from Adam and here we are we are completing the seventh Church age we've actually moved out of the seventh Church age and we're actually into that Eternal Church age already because the Eternal messenger himself which is Christ has come down and it's already called you and already uh you know Tak you snatched you from the world yeah you're still here but you're not the same person you know what I mean you're still here you go to work like everybody else but you know you're different you know you're not the same you know you're not of this world okay you know that you're actually waiting on a body change that you're just waiting for a translation you've got rapturing faith already in you given to you by the revealed word of this hour every time you come into the house of the Lord if you come with the right expectation to receive something from God you're receiving another little portion of that rapturing Faith that's just you know building upon building precept upon precept line upon line and Adam the seventh from Adam was Enoch and he was a type because he walked with God Enoch walked with God and what did he do please God why did he please God because God gave him a revelation of what he was going to do the whole Plan of Redemption God got you know Lord gets excited sometimes and he starts really revealing and starts unloading and man you know you can get so full of inspiration and before you know it you you could get so caught up like Enoch that you're just you're God you're God you know you're God G in your thoughts you're gone in your Revelation You're Gone In Christ and you know you're you're you you know that you're you're another Enoch because you're just not the same as anybody else here on this Earth You are of another Dominion you're of another place and you know that that's the place that you must go back to there's nothing that can stop it and then comes Methuselah and he's a type of the Millennium you know n lives 969 years right and so we go to the next lineage and we look at the serpent seed lineage and Cain's lineage was carried in the Ark by Noah's son and wives the sons and wives because that lineage continued through even though the Earth got flooded and got wiped out the lineages carried on they still carried through and on we go then the flood rained 40 days 40 nights in the ark one year 10 days so now let's look at the next cycle which is the 2,000 years that lead up to Jesus Christ next slide we see that there was a rainbow and God said this is the token of the Covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you for Perpetual Generations I do set my bow in the cloud and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the Earth God was showing that there was going to be fulfillments there was going to be covenants that would be fulfilled and that he would make certain promises and that those promises would be fulfilled and he promised After the flood that he would not flood the Earth again but that he would come and actually redeem us and so in the next 2,000 years we come to the age where God calls Abraham and then below remember the serpent seed carries on Nimrod Babylon right those two seeds got to keep running all the way through all the way to the end next slide then comes Moses King David Daniel and these are all the kings and all all that God was showing through their experiences and through each one of those individuals a type of exactly what he was going to do in our day and that we were going to receive an Abraham's call that we were going to receive a Moses that we were going to receive you know a a an understanding of the kingship of God and the grace of God you know what he what he showed through David's life and how he showed mercy and how he showed the grace and and and the Glorious um experiences that David had and then how he would bring all the prophecies through Daniel you know and all the the wonderful Revelations the 70 weeks of Daniel and brother brand of bringing all that Revelation and all that understanding and that's why it's so important for us to continue to listen listen to the tapes and go through the tapes and listen to them praise God it all led up to the life of Jesus Christ and then down below which is the serpent seed we've got all these Empires that were constantly fighting against the word there's always going to be a fight right now our fight is not so much these Empires but we fight against powers principalities and dominions we're in another dimension our fight is another dimension Saints we're not to get caught up into the fight of this world the politics of this world they're just fulfilling prophecy but what are you fulfilling what is your destiny what is your position in the word of God so Daniel brought the understanding of the image the head of gold the silver the belly the brass the legs of iron and clay and we're not going to get into all the details of that what we're trying to bring through these through this study tonight and last Wednesday is just an understanding of Time Eternity time and back to Eternity and how it all fits together and so the third timeline is the 2,000 years of when Christ comes to the Earth to redeem next slide says the Creator himself became the Redeemer Christ had to come and take on human flesh listen here he says but he put man on free moral agency knowing that man would fall remember this is not some you know game like you know like you see on the internet where they have you know game of uh Thrones and all these you know different things that they set up and and uh it's no God placed us here under free moral agency and you're still under free moral agency you can choose to do right and do wrong you can choose to serve God you can choose to come to church on Wednesday night you can choose not to that's entirely up to you you can choose to come on Sunday you can choose not to you see what I mean you're under free moral agency but when you choose right you get blessed am you you can never go wrong when you choose God and what he's provided for you and in that then he became man himself in order to redeem back man that fell that's the reason that Jesus was Emmanuel God With Us if God sent another person besides himself then that wouldn't be just God had to come himself and take place and God could not become down in spirit and take take place he had to be made flesh In the Flesh of his own creative son his own son that he cre he created himself a body so that he could dwell inside that body so that it could go because God can't be a liar if God says if you sin you shall surely die then God had to make a way for us to be to be brought back because he couldn't go against his word see God's going to prove everything by his word by fulfilling his word and by doing what he said he promised he would do amen so he became flesh and so next slide we look at the 2,000 year cycle of Christ and what's within those 2,000 years next slide we get the seven Church ages 1 2 third fourth fifth all the way up to the seventh and we've already come out of the seventh age even though we're in the Leo Dean Church age we are actually by Revelation Way Beyond that we're Way Beyond that Saints you should see that by now that we that brother Bram came he was the messenger so let's go on it says here and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not for I am the first and the last this is Christ now speaking to John Revelations 1:7 I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forever more amen and have the keys of hell and of death who was speaking there Jesus Christ it's Jesus Christ it's not you know people say oh there was you know three in you know three in one the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost no it's one God it's always been one God there's no one beside IDE me there's no one after me nor before me it's just God and his name is Jesus Christ in in the in in our human realm of understanding it's Jesus Christ I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I'm alive forever more amen and at the keys of hell and of death write the things which thou H has seen and the things which are and the things which shall be Hereafter The Mystery of the Seven Stars which thou saw in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks the Seven Stars he's telling them what those seven stars were are the Angels of the seven churches and the Seven candlesticks which thou saw are the seven churches next slide and so we've got the seven Church ages and we've got the seven Messengers and we all know about the seven Church ages you know this is all the history that we received through the message of the hour and through William Mary brandom who was the seventh messenger am okay to each of those Church ages in order to have a revelation of what God is doing today I'm going to emphasize this you need to see this you need to understand the ages that we have come through you need to understand the reformation and what the a lot of people talk about the Reformation I belong to the Reformed Church I said that's great but did you know that the Reformation has progressed and continued on Amen to the Fulfillment where Christ is going to take a church and in a Rapture they're still living in that reform age they're still living under the under the reformers of those particular ages they won't deny you you tell them but if you heard of William Brown who's that but then you turn around and say well what's the name of your church we are Lutheran Church is that right I said who who's Martin Luther well who's Martin Luther they'll stand right behind him Bo let me tell you who's joh West what are you talking about but they don't realize what so God cannot continue on and fulfill all that he said he was going to fulfill in the Book of Revelation what happened to the seven Church age what happened to the continuation and the Reformation that would lead up to Jesus Christ coming to the Earth do you see what I mean and what was God going to do and how do you explain Malachi 4:5 and how do you explain Revelations 10 and and all the scriptures they don't have a clue about that why because they're stuck in a certain age and they're not willing to march on and progress with the word of God and the thing is when God said brother bradam a prophet to this 20th century he took the word and restored all things he was the one Malachi 4 that would restore the faith of the fathers back to the children where we whereby we could actually know which would be the right Church where we would need to go just like when John the Baptist was on the earth God sent John the Baptist so that he could announce the coming of the Lord Jesus and those that were following John were led to Jesus Christ and he was the word and brother bradam was Elijah he was the messenger that would that would introduce the second coming of Jesus Christ people are talking about he's coming again he'll shall he'll come in the Clouds Of Glory and you know and they're and they're under this expectation and meanwhile here you are and he's already come amen amen and you know it and he came in a cloud amen he came in 1963 he had seven angels come down and open up those Seven Seals of the Book of Revelation he did all those things and it's all in the scripture but yet the people you you start to talk about the Book of Revelation oh but you know that's that's too complicated yeah sure it's complicated the whole word of God the Bible says that the letter kth but the spirit gives it life all you need is the holy spirit oh really yeah that's all you need is the Holy Spirit and you the spirit will show you truth amen oh how do I get the Holy Spirit by obeying the word of God that says repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy ghost amen it's that simple acts 238 that's God's provided way so how are you baptized I have not been baptized as an adult I was I was baptized as a child you need to be re-baptized you have not come according to the word of God and God is not a liar so if you're telling me that you're experiences enough and it ended with a baptism when you were five 7 months old or you got baptized in another church as an adult and you ask them well how are you baptized well I went to the pool and I went into the water I came up okay do you remember how you were about do you remember what he said because the scripture there's 8,000 baptisms in the New Testament in the book of Acts and every one of them was in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right so how were you about well oh yeah it was in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit I said you haven't been baptized what do you mean I went into the waters yeah but you didn't have you see to repent is to turn away from unbelief and if you stay in unbelief by believing that there's a trinity Father Son and Holy Ghost then you really have't taken on the name of Christ which is the bridegroom Christ is the groom that's your husband right yes okay so usually the wife will take the husband's name I'm being a little caral here in the way that it's being uh uh given but yet there's a revelation that a wife will take her husband's name and that's why the Bible says that many are going to come to Jesus Christ on that day and say Lord let me in did I not prophesy in your name did I not cast out devils in your name did I not pray in your name he's going to turn around and say I never knew you I never knew you Adam knew his wife gave seed gave Revelation gave understanding I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity what is that knowing truth but rejecting it having the truth come right up to you give given to you shows you that you need to be baptized according to Christian baptisms in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in water and you turn around and you say don't need it doesn't matter okay so then you then do then you could have been baptized in the name of the lily of the valley then oh no but he just told me it doesn't matter you see either you believe the word of God or you don't either you got the holy ghost or you don't it's just that simple God is not the author of confusion and all of these truths were brought out through the ministry of brother William brandham who was the seventh Church age messenger amen amen next slide and so those seven candlesticks we just heard it it John was told that those seven candlesticks were the churches but they were all lit by the Messengers that God God sent and every one of those Messengers were lit by The Same Spirit you see it's always been Christ in every age it's always been the Holy Ghost in every one of those Reformation age and you know through the Dark Ages it was Christ in the people it was Christ in every one of those angels and Messengers but what happens is they kick Christ out of the church by taking on their own Doctrine and not moving on with the progression of the word of God that leads us to this day and when you leave when you when you reject Christ like they rejected Jesus when he came into the temple and he stood there and he read the word and he spoke the word to them and he said this day this word this prophecy this scripture has been fulfilled before your very eyes they turned to him and said what crucify him blasphemer seeing that he is the word made flesh in this day
