========================================
for greet you all and the loving name of the Lord Jesus Christ and company our pastor wrote of Hawkins ministry for other doctor this morning and our civilian where we have on early officially and that's where we're at we just bought a church there were few years ago but we're certainly happened to be here and bring ingredients of the whole fire back home and appreciate all of you but the tough next night night view that did we brought some fancy chapter 13 these are very familiar countries and there's several things on my heart that I could have but thirteen I'll begin reading in verse 3 if you would these fake many things under them in parables saying behold a sower went forth of stove when he sowed some seeds fell among the wayside the files came and devoured them up some fell upon stony places where they had not much earth and forthwith they sprung up because they had no deepness of earth and when the Sun was up they were scorched because they had no root they withered away some fell among thorns the thorns sprung up and choked there was I would have felt in the good ground would be there constantly and it brought forth fruit some a hundredfold some sixty and some thirty four they got any questions this morning - through the reading of his word many baby seed in this morning it is lovely me again is a privilege and an honor to be here this morning [Music] [Music] - TV so few really that was the first first taping that we [Music] so we're just happy to be here we've been met with the sugar now and it's wheel Michigan area there's work number of years and we're certainly happy to be and grandson was on some of the taping you'll see them is one of my carrying them honor him walking around the platform with him so he's coming along just fine [Music] [Applause] our family [Applause] [Music] so finally through prayer and a lotta grace of God we were able to we were able to bring our life together again in our family into the ministry it's been a it's been a journey it's been a wonderful journey and we just have appreciated the hand of God and the main thing is never make mistakes I'm gonna sell what we got one of the greatest words I think in all Christianity is a word called reap in another language they're winners what his father God makes a mistake he can't wait to repent that's been my experience yeah I made a lot of mistakes but there's something tugging at my heart my deal you need to make this for that your life the grace of not we've been able to keep on keepin on and so that's the that's the important part that it's good to see see you here this morning because some of you know in our family for many many many years and others may be worsening us for the first time so don't get tweaked sided is that your case because we're gonna leave at the service but we're certainly happy to be here for next month some of you are wanting to write down this date November the 21st because you want to send a little card you know I was 18 years old 18 years old when the Lord spoke to my heart a lot and I'll be honest we're raising our children and by the grace of God every one of them serving the Lord and growing up with God and doing doing wonders when I'm elected change overnight but by the grace of God East Campus and I said I knew of everything to do or better really like [Applause] so we're happy to be here we're happy to share this morning and like I said I just have a little flaw in my heart something I brought through the local church here some time back and I want to title this this morning out I find it to be very lengthy at all are you living below your privilege that's what I'll tight with this morning are you living below your privileges or are you living to your full potential so a lot of different ways to live and I'll be honest with you living to your full potential is the best so as we look at our scripture this morning and I want to start here with this city this is the parable that Jesus was speaking on the sower we're just talking about are you living below your privileges and the question is where are we at where are you and when it comes to living to our full potential how do you measure up this morning according to God's Word and according to this message that he brought in this age and after all the years that we would serve a given living for him to you especially that offended this is simply brother Tom's been around here a long time in this area some of you may have started with him I don't know something to then maybe something beginning in here some maybe five years or 10 years or 15 years I don't know but the thing the question is this morning hi how are you doing I'm Gus were how are you doing if I could say like this God's spiritual measuring stick because really that's important it's important how you live your life it's important where you're at spiritually it's important if you're going to do something for God that you're living for him to your full potential so I will just talk of these things in just for you this morning I think I think without any doubt in my heart I think we should all be living to our fullest potential [Music] futures I'm determined in the spring so I'm not the brush Harbor fireball that I used to be so won't you be disappointed with this is over those are wonderful days and I'd love to ever been in I used to preach so hard that look we dripping down my throat but I got [Music] slow down but I just love the Lord just as much as I always have so let's just look at this today what you turbo's me if you would the mark chapter 10 and I don't have this on the overhead to give you as much but we just take our time and look at it mark the tenth chapter and I'm going to begin reading at verse 28 I'll give you a moment to turn to it but mark 10 verse verse 28 says this Peter began to say unto Him lo we have left all and follow the United referred here is open mouth insert foot Peter Peter was always getting himself in trouble with the Lord so they tempted visas Bowl staples he said we heard fibbing he says he begin to say we have left all this Peter now we have been Paul and have followed thee so Jesus comes back with this answer nothing is profound and he just gotta sex Peter's thought and he said this is the person who has left off and here's Jesus answer verse 29 and jesus answered and said to me apparently I've seen to you there is no man that hath left house and brother or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my sake in the gospel but he shall receive a hundredfold in this time now Peter how do you feel about your statement wife and children and lands anyone done that has a hundredfold life right now I know what I love that that's my goal in life is to be able to serve him to my 50 fullest potential and that's exactly what I want with each other see force pretty a hundredfold in this time Hopson brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands relative inside why'd he stop there because you only have one so when you stop there in addition to the EEG at this time it selected brothers sisters children the blades and the mothers of all what a wonderful time you're going to have that's our goal and I think we should all be striving for that hundred full life I think I'm gonna be her god desire I think that would be our goal in life because you see a total commitment reach a total reward [Music] you know there's a lot of people that want what grandpa and grandma hand they want that whole time to experience and a month ago plant power of God but they don't want to live like the old people use no they they don't want that upper room experience and I want that Patsy's among some buddy we're done deserve you are right here you're not all so he's saying here it takes a total commitment kind of like the story that I know you've heard of the of the chicken of the pig that were having a great conversation is the chicken say hey I'll tell you what let's do breakfast in the morning you bring the bacon out radiates a little check a wonderful time thinking about [Music] take a look at that check the set for you it's just a mere confirmation well that's what takes so the question is this morning as we did we look at this for a few minute is our living to our fullest potential are living below our privileges the profit of message colors evil skirts are necessary here's the worst sight that Matthews hockey club who's talking about the Eagle that he saw him that the eCos he saw in the zoo I think was it's an anchor somewhere revisited these all things evil they softly caged up and there's places we personally people that are out there to take this very day singing and play their instruments in that clubs a bar and cut their teeth on but it takes a personal commitment it takes somebody that's willing to surrender their hearts and their lives to God in a message coheeries and in Saskatoon he said this is it circle the ministers we should be ashamed of ourselves as we keep our congregations way below their procedures I've seen it done I've seen the old song come down so the pastors and churches work they just keep their people now and I'm allowed to soar like the Eagles they don't allow them to live above the world they want to keep their control he said this I think this is profound he said the whole Christian church today is believing thousands of miles below their god-given proof we need to claim every promise of God can you say man and when you can claim your problems about not all second certainty that we're living the thousands of the house before but it does me and I thought one thing for sure how about me living to my fullest potential in Christ you see too many holes but there's two in there fall by the wayside and I would like to see and I would think there's a congregation you would like to see I would think it's a congregation you should want to be living to your souls so let's take a look at the Word of God as we look at here just a little bit and in our text in Matthew chapter 13 Jesus said some seeds fell to the ground we would eat that top right I told people you've probably heard me say maybe what however long has been almost 20 years I think what John said but I've ever seen I've said it many times you're nothing but dirt though if you get here I minded you're made up of the 16 elements of the years you're probably number two dollars living in us we believe they didn't decide then he's sitting there with something would bring for 30 some 60 100 fold and when you look at your life this morning the store I want us to do to do a little self inspection this morning when you look at your life this morning which would you say you're producing there's the venturi now mind you they're all believers I'm not talking about all the neighbors 30 60 and hundredfold somewhere in that scale you are as I am and I want you there self examine what you turn there's on to this money inside of you it just half your cell would you want Lord we're quite sure where am i living in is my life producing 34 still reliever 60-vote stay with a beaver why am i living to my fullest potential and I praise the Lord for a family so let's just take a good look at many times the disciples didn't understand Jesus when he spoke to them in parallel and this was one of those times and they ask you in 13 words you're staying in that chapter for a while yes universe did they say disciples said to him once because now unto them in parables [Music] explain what you mean parables are slower good for them some see you hear something they're at something why do you do that this silences his file or attested in the insert in verse 11 if you said that there because it's given unto you to know miss because it's for members only so let's take a look at those pictures to see what he said this morning forgive me good eye throats messed up my brother used to be around you it's not given to them he wants you to understand his work he wants you to know what he's talking about he wants you to know who you are you want you to know where you are that's what we're talking about this where ever you haven't the scale that we're talking about this morning you drop down to verse 18 and he starts explaining the parable now that we just talked about he said here you hear for the terrible when any one heareth the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not then cometh the wicked one and catcheth away that which is sown in his heart this is he which received seed by the way side so we can't I want to say this is just total unbelievers but it pretty closely is because they have no clue and though inside I said in first Corinthians 214 the natural man receiveth not the things of God because they are spiritually discerned you've got to have you've got to have a cold man to break the quote of this book a time the tiny otherwise you read it in the beats nothing you won't get the coke and break it down to you without that you're just like the man that has a seat that comes and has no understanding of them and they get stolen away first I said this clinics one but he they're free this see into the stony places the same is he that heareth the word and anima joy receiveth it this is both enjoy either call them enjoy because the years and receive it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] shouting others [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] because you know about protection when you first come into the house in protection you don't sell the problems in the church off the shoulder these there are 22 you have that rootedness company dearth for a while encryption and persecution arises because of the word or your future enemy [Music] all right 21 in everyone okay aren't you he got also the race she was seen up on farms us with the men together if he that receipt here's the word and the care of this world the pressures of life and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becometh he was fruitful to become a country he gets so caught up and the cares of life and the things of life women and all things of life their spiritual life exponent altitude and there's fulness of richness mom and dad or not the universe after every service and I'm born of thee that's how I want to be is like that well I had a worker with [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] with a full the cup and put it against the wall to give the car came up which was our kitchen table that's what we lit up when we got married when we should you should get cement box and put

without so you're gonna watch out for Joe salesman and you look at say I want to see the lowest price [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] device [Music] [Music] [Music] probably due
