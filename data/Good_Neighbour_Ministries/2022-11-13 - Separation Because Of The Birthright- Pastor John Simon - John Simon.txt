bless you please be seated amen looks like a new one but I knew nothing about it so I don't want to turn it on or off or whatever but God bless every one of you did you sleep well amen amen it was a long day yesterday at sister Johnson's funeral and in respect to her we all wanted to be there and you know just to comfort your family be with the friends and everything else I want to see also I'm very proud and thankful to every one of you that supported the effort for the family they needed like helpers people to work whether it's in the kitchen whether it was to give to help the support because they had much more people than they had planned for and they thought they just have a few hundred and maybe they had you know maybe half a half a thousand maybe about 500 people and some did not even come to the reception which um you know people were outside from the funeral um having to watch on uh remotely and some others had to go home and just watch it being streamed and Mr Johnson let me know that um after it that people they were texting him constantly from England Jamaica other countries um like that they were so blessed by the entire service and so we thank God for that and uh amen [Applause] and I want you to know that the church was behind that all the way and even now that they had more people and believe that we will try to uh uh kind of brace up that family just a little more right because it just at the last minute you know uh running out of a few essentials in the midst of everything and then there had to be a an effort to get things going so uh we we I want you to know we did our part uh you might not know it but we've done our part and we'll continue to do so in about a week's time a couple of us may just go up there and uh talk with the family again sing pray and God bless them right praise God you we can't be with them every day every night from then on because of the passing now they have to start strengthening themselves and moving on their own praise the Lord God bless you uh Praises wonderful precious name we welcome all of you into the house of God and trusted the holy spirit will bless us and shower his grace and mercy upon us praise the Lord uh Genesis uh here in the Bible chapter 25 readings from verses 19 to 24 praise the Lord amen foreign God verses 19 to 24. let's read God's word and these are the generations of Isaac Abraham's son for Abraham begot Isaac and Isaac was 40 years old when he took Rebecca to wife the daughter of betuel the Syrian of padhana ram the sister Taliban the Syrian and Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife because she was barren and the Lord wasn't treated of him and Rebecca his wife conceived and the children struggled together within her and she said if it be so why am I thus and she went to inquire of the Lord and the Lord said unto her two nations are in thy womb and to manner of people shall be separated from thy vowels and the one people shall be stronger than the other and the Elder Shall Serve the young girl and when our days to be delivered were fulfilled behold they were twins in her womb praise the Lord God bless his word father we thank you for the word that you've given to us and now as we pick up that word we pray that the word of God will transmute transform itself and reveal itself to your children who are equipped and sent here with the ability to receive it in the way you want them to receive it father bless us today we pray in Jesus name amen and amen God bless you all praise the Lord now um we know um we have been preaching the word in such a way in a way it's pointing out the separation uh that is taking place uh right now not human Separation by us separating ourselves from anybody but the Holy Spirit doing his own work but at the same time what God is actually doing uh to create or to cause that separation is to uh pinpoint where the Antichrist is hiding in the church today because the church is now in the Harvest time or what you may say is the grand age when the word comes to the place where it is ripened and it can be uh visibly distinguished one from the other and a youthful days when we was wheat is planted you can't tell the difference between wheat and grass because all the blades come up looking the same when they come to maturity then the difference starts becoming apparent it's becoming real until you can't even avoid seeing the difference and this is what we are talking about with this series of messages is God by the holy spirit is trying to identify to us the spirit of the Antichrist which was always in the womb of the church it was always there quickly as the scripture says here and Rebecca conceived and the children uh were fighting together in her they were fighting right in the womb praise God now we don't want to this would be a message because you got to go back in the mind of God what fighting was taking place in heaven and come on down and all that but the fact is the Bible is telling us in a short precise Dynamic way that the children were already fighting and they were fighting struggling in the womb now just naturally imagine that with a woman with two with twins in the womb and they're kicking and fighting and everything else she must have had a time of her life uh oh my but there it is and uh uh she said if this be so why am I enough in other words if this is the Lord doing this why why these children peaceful they're fighting something is going on here if this is the Lord it should be peace it should be nice it should be wonderful the same thing naturally this is the Church of God and if this should be the house of God why is it not peace why why do you have to always be on guard be vigilant and to recognize what Spirits here or people you are intermingling with we'll get to that in a minute because we realize that here that this is rarely a uh uh what should I say God projecting the fact that the time will come when himself and Satan will actually be fighting within the confines of the Church of the Living God and he wants us to know that that is going to happen but it's been prefigured and presented to us in the in this way that we creatures of Senses can understand what was going to happen and is happening now in our day no Brother Bruno Mars said Satan and the bride will have to come face to face again just as Eve came face to face with Satan in the Garden of Eden but she was defiled or beguiled as the Bible says it and there we understand all sin started praise God hallelujah but now it's not the spirit anymore of let's say is a fighting Jacob it is but it isn't uh Jacob and Esau coming with satanic power in this hour we find out if Satan fighting against God and he's fighting against God in the church and it's going on while we speak Hallelujah now God fighting against Satan how's he doing it God Christ in his brain fighting against Satan praise God because the bride has now become the word and the word is fighting against unbelief the word is fighting against lies the word is fighting against Darkness the word is fighting against anything contrary to himself amen hallelujah and I want you to know as we've preached the past weeks Satan is here trying to impersonate the word in his men and women that he may be using in this hour so there's a face-to-face fighting going on and it's going on between God and Satan amen so it's not men that are fighting but his spirits in men that are fighting do you get this we're not we're not fighting anybody but it's spirits in people in men that are actually fighting amen praise God now you understand then what I'm saying is that each one has temples and God has temples and Satan has his temples and God in his Temple is again fighting against Satan in his temples and the temples are men no ye not you know your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost so these temples are actually fighting against one another in that way hallelujah amen praise God and then Satan will say to you it's in the Bible what are you talking about but then the word will answer and say yes it's in the Bible but I say it's written I know it's written but this is what it is just us oh it's no different but it's the same thing but one is written and one is by Revelation and the revelation of the word right of the word of God is what causes a separation the separation is caused by the birthright and whenever somebody gets the right verse it will start to create a separation praise God hallelujah amen oh my praise the Lord so he he stood up Satan on that mount of Temptation he stood right in the face let's look at how thirsty as we say he is that he stood right in front of the word himself and he is withstanding the word himself and he is telling the word what is written about him and say in his written Jesus said yes but it is also written and he take it further to show him what you say there that's what it said on his you stop there but if this is it more more and he can go on forever and Satan gotta go back he's trying again it is written in the Bible the Bible says so and so amen praise God but Jesus said but look at what you say is written it means this this this this this this that party in written amen but it is written oh my oh yes and then finally he had it he said tempt not the Lord thy God thank God Amen praise God and put him down praise God and they're saying the same thing now to us oh look in the Bible where did you get that I never heard that before that's not my problem if you never heard it before is it the truth or is it not the truth amen amen if it's not the truth you got it right to take the take the word where you're saying it's written and so it's not the truth but if it's the truth just like with Stephen you can't withstand the word by which Stephen's smoke you can't go against it because it is the truth the prophet said truth escape the truth and it don't change it Remains the Same as it always was praise the Lord God hallelujah amen glory to God I want to know is the truth praise God I tell you friends in this hour where the deception is so close where would we be without Jesus where we would we be without him uh we would be fun trying to use human senses to differentiate and to detect because it's so close amen praise God and here in Cain and Abel we see that separation when the birthright became apparent that aimed to Abel that he already had it that it was in him he caught Revelation in that hour without there being any written word around and God revealed to him that it was a lamb that was to be killed Hallelujah so Abel had a revelation not only of his sacrifice that was going to be made but he had a revelation of Z sacrifice that was going to be made for all the rest of the seed that were like him and that's what he understood by faith April brought forth a better a sacrifice amen hallelujah amen and when he saw that that uh it's the lamb that would take or pay the price for sin he ceased from his works because there's nothing he can do like game to prove or work something up it was the work of God so he entered into the believer's rest I hope you have entered into the believer's rest for the True Believer she says from their own works and they enter into the rest of God what rest resting on the word hallelujah oh praise God that's where we are resting today we're resting on the word of the Living God hallelujah amen oh my yes sir he knew of a short of us surely by the Revelation that he caught that it was not by works of righteousness by which we have done but by his mercy and Grace that we have saved this morning Hallelujah by his mercy and Grace we are seated we are standing we are talking we're rejoicing we're singing because of the grace of God to our souls Hallelujah amen and God Vindicated his sacrifice don't worry children I'll tell you this bride the Vindication of this bride and what the bride is expressing is going to be fully Vindicated amen it's starting to but it will be fully when the Canton and become apparent to all amen we all start from the same starting point like he said in the marginal divorce but he says when you're close together you're going from many miles you're still pretty close you know but it's just slowly it starts he says by time you get 50 miles out or 100 miles out the thing is so far apart you can't even you don't have to guess but there is a big huge difference both call themselves Christian but it starts out so and everybody's innocent everybody is wonderful it's nice but then slowly you see you see something going like this amen it's not Apparent at first but then later on you see the Gap becomes so wide that you can recognize it for yourself amen praise be to God hallelujah now we know there is another separation see and that is between Abraham and lot amen luck was a colonel Seeker amen he always was thinking about this big thing thinking about that big thing always thinking of big things and things with a lot of tinsel on it now uh we're not preaching about Christmas but the prophet talks about cancer being on it in other words they have got to have their Church filled with a lot of shiny things and tinsel things and if they're going to have a program or they're going to have it they have to put all kinds of stuff trying to attract people's attention amen but you see it's the opposite it wants to be God once the height and simplicity not to attract people's attention he only wants to attack the brain's attention the rest of it is only going to be trouble the rest of this is gonna be death and trial and he don't really want that see that Spirit of love wants the big things something with a lot of things lot on it see because it's just like a monkey yeah that's not me saying that the prophet is talking about there's a lot of Monkey Business going on within the message where people are being caught up with bright objects bright things bright individuals who are bright shining personalities they're caught up you know there's things where we talked about that the time will come they get caught up with personalities and celebrities and start to drift from the word because they're following that instead of keeping their eyes and being led by the word of God but they don't have faith in their own faith so they want to put the faith in some mind that he must be right they are I follow him because he must be right but you see we want you not just to follow me or any man else but to keep your eyes on the word we are teaching and let the word lead you and guide you through for the glory of God so you have your individual Revelation individual salvation but you know the word of God says he puts you on the Shepherds and pastors but the real Pastor is the one above yeah because he leads that Pastor the pastor leads you amen praise God but you are really in the original you're led by the holy spirit amen and he will always lead you to the perfect light of the word of God see them things are just like a monkey and I don't know about you but when I look around there's a lot of Monkey Business going on always wanted to have these bright shiny things all and he says it here and always reaching out for bright things all around them see oh my that Spirit hasn't left the Earth that spirit is with them people even here today do you believe that oh we have this big convention oh we have oh you know who that's going to be this is going to be brother soon so oh man you've got to go to this one if you miss that oh you're gonna miss out on some you see it just in the real believer listens for the word doesn't care brother who is talking I don't care what name he puts on it I bring it back to we have uh oh this brother has this Mighty gift this brother is a great preacher and I listen to some believer bring them in and while they're talking the holy spirit says there homosexuality is there oh over there there is this there and then you have to stop it quietly they don't know you stop it so they think it's normal huh may you stop it behind the scene because you recognize what's hiding back of the veil what God is saying that is happening and going to happen in a bigger scale it may not be publicized but he is going to discern them things in his own body Hallelujah and buying them and cast them out for the glory and praise of the Living God hallelujah amen you see them that them spirits will always reach out like that for bright things in other words then he says like like lot going to that City in other words bright lights they like to go over those bright lights and everything everybody is so well-dressed and looking shiny uh you know the Lord himself was of no appearance don't want no no attraction to him except you're attracted by what you see in him the whole praise God hallelujah amen see them people like that they want the biggest churches in the city they want the most intellectual pastors see they they want the best dressed people that want where the mayor goes see it's still that same Spirit Hallelujah and remember this he says they're really did have the book right Pentecostal had the holy spirit for their age is that right but they didn't recognize the fullness of it and then they find out but by their action when the birthright come to them in another shape and form they rejected showing that they didn't really know even what it was when they got it the first time so here he says it let me say it in his words uh really they already have the book rights to begin with and call themselves a church but they lose it because they despise it amen see they despise it completely and they didn't because it was their nature to do that when the time came Hallelujah when the things start to reveal and The Germ the gene of God starts to be watered by the water from the prophetic Rock and they start coming to life then we find out right there the difference started slowly to be made manifested but it's in their nature he said to do that and to reject that birth right see all my because there is the spirit of The Crow and the dove oh Hallelujah Then There It Is they crave that because that is what they are that is what they are amen and you are acting according to what you are amen it's not something you put on something you make up that is what you are Hallelujah there are see one wanted to get away from it but the other one you couldn't even keep him away from it because that's why the election of God hallelujah the election of God you couldn't keep him away from it oh Hallelujah he is born Now by a spiritual man amen or a spiritual woman something in him calls for that he's talking about born by the spiritual man Christ and a real spiritual church that's what he's talking about here not talking about a natural spiritual man and spiritual woman and that way and because of that he Longs for it I hopes you can recognize it I hope this gets you down to a place where we can see what I mean by capping this all off he's capping it off capping off his messages amen praise God now as long as there were associated together the church natural and the church spiritual they never did get the blessings Jacob was never blessed until he separated himself from Esau do you believe that amen and Abraham was never blessed until he separated himself from lot amen I want you to see the blessing come by the separation and the separation come by Revelation or the birthright amen Separation by the book right hallelujah amen yes oh my now Jesus and speaking of the second coming he said as it was in the days of Noah they shall be eating and drinking oh my marrying and giving in marriage but when he spoke of the days of lot he's never said it like that amen he never said it like that he said as in the days of lot so shall it be now you see that one was for Revelation to be revealed because that's the same day when the son of man is being revealed and this is all wrapped up in what he's saying here in that day that's different from what he's talking about uh uh Noah there there's of Noah amen but thank God I'm glad we are here and God has fortified that that if the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the Lord is able to raise up a standard of the word against him this is the day of Revelation do you believe that I said this is the day of Revelation not just natural education not memorization not just teaching you tactics of how to memorize Bible verses and pieces and stuff like that and that word written word is going to be your sword or walking with a cross on a pole before you is going to scare the devil away no we're past all that now Christ in me the hope of glory Christ in you your hope of glory Christ in you is your defense glory to God hallelujah amen yes sir hallelujah oh praise God forevermore so God is revealing to us his bride and as fast as the devil moves and tries to hide somewhere God reveals to her where he is hiding every time he moves God Rises up a standard every time he goes behind a different but God reveals to her where he is hiding amen that's why we so reliant on him we're not relying ourselves our brain is not fast one he said in the church of his book he said do you think any natural man can ever compete against us and spirit like that that had six thousand years of sophistry and things like that you're going to compete against one like that oh my well who then is he saying come compete against them God himself amen God himself in you is the only one by revealing this word hallelujah because he said what where do you come from Satan he's a going to and fro and that's the devil his mind is fast and you can't keep up with that his mind is so fast you'll think he's a genius but thank God God is a bad genius God is above all of that amen amen he can go as fast as he wants and God just sits still and see the wonders of the Lord be still and know that I am God now we're running around and uh this and that and the other rest in the world let the word work itself out for the glory of God hallelujah amen yes sir God did what first of all he opened up the Seven Seals for us to show us his intention that I'm going to show you where he has been Landing all down through these thousands of years I want to show you where he was hiding and now down to your time I come right now on the scene I'm going to be with you and every time he moves I'm gonna move every time he does this I'm going to reveal it I'm going to make it no so you know exactly what he's doing and how to come against him amen hallelujah amen glory to God hallelujah I'm glad he's revealing to us where Satan's at and you know by now he's showing us that Satan is not out there among the Pentecostals he's not out there amongst the general areas he's telling you that the deception is so close is right inside the church right beside you and it comes back to the womb of Rebecca with the twins fighting right inside of the womb amen hallelujah oh my praise God Amen yes sir the impersonators we have today is not Pentecostals the impersonators are right in this message amen some men that do not even call to preach they're preaching and when they're preaching uh they're quoting the message they're preaching the Bible but they're missing something that's in there and people with the spirit of Christ and a revelatory spirit of Jesus Christ can recognize it amen oh you can't hide it no more Satan the word of God is on the scene revelation of the spirit of God that's right here on the scene glory be to God hallelujah amen yes sir oh my praise God and though where he's hiding praise God and uh while I'm talking like that let me say this I'm not thinking of any person personalities or individuals while I'm talking like this because the devil will want to come to your mind and say oh maybe he's talking this way thinking this way that way no no no no no no not at all I'm just sending out the word right and Satan is they're throwing his things too so I I just want you to know that that that's this just we are not here to tear down anybody's character the work that they're doing amen praise God and that sort of thing but to point you to the word amen and all we are trying to do is to point out and identify the works of the Antichrist so you are not caught off guard amen praise God hallelujah amen amen praise God and the Antichrist is in the message right Among Us amen and just like the spirit of Jesus right amongst the other Apostles right amongst the other believers and he was so close that he was trusted he was genuinely sincerely trusted amen and walked amongst them Hallelujah Oh my Jesus himself said that Judas Ministry was not inferior to the other ones he said have I not chosen you all of you in other words all of you even Judas who was chosen one was chosen to receive the word and one was chosen to deceive because he was born the Bible says he was born that way to be have that spirit in him praise God and uh they say oh but I got the Holy Ghost well Judas had the Holy Ghost Ministry he was casting out devil because he's in the sick he was going around with Jesus doing everything and it outwardly appeared uh genuine wonderful but it's not just having a holy ghost Ministry amen it's making sure God showed you Mercy by blessing his germ this Gene his seed in you that you are not one in a million could have been anybody else hallelujah amen praise God and me or in one of us we have the germ the gene representation to Salvation and one have another seed contrary seed in them representation to condemnation but thanks be to God I am here to represent Jesus Christ you are here to represent Jesus Christ you are here to manifest Jesus Christ for the glory of God hallelujah amen yes sir o praise God hallelujah you the spirit had to come to a stop I thank God what did the prophet of God say said here wisdom versus Faith he says you see do you know he said Satan knew just as much of the world as Jesus knew he's talking with a written word there you know so that that's not in the book but you understand he's really talking about the written word because Satan can't really know the word as much as Jesus because he said one knew the word but the other one himself was the word and that's the great difference one Speaking from from his knowledge of the word and the other one is living the word he's the Living Word so it's a great difference there praise God and the rain has fallen under just a new unjust in our day the ministry of the Prophet came and it shined down and rained down on this day on every person that was there amen praise God and whatever Revelation you've got it's got to be revealed to you by God himself you remember Jesus came and he said to them who do you think is I the son of man am in other words even though I'm standing here before you looking like a man who do you really think I am that's the question you really was asking you know because he was always doing his signs and wonders to give them some you know wake up their spiritual Amnesia to to start to remember when they were with him before the foundations he did a Wonder here A Sign there something here just to wake up that spiritual Amnesia to begin to start to recognize who he was and something like broke through on on Peter oh don't want the Christ the son of the Living God I see it now oh please God hallelujah listen where it came from yes Peter flesh and blood has not revealed this on you where it come from but my Father in heaven has revealed this it's the same thing happening now PM picked it up by education we don't pick it up even by by religious teaching you got it my heavenly father has revealed this unto you everything oh praise God forevermore hallelujah oh thank God I'm so glad that this is what God has done amen because it makes you recognize what the word you recognize also the anointed word for your day and for your hour praise God you know the difference from the holy spirit amen praise God and there that also identifies your election because he came to you amen what you're singing about that he came to you and why did he come to you he said that come for the lordship amen that's what he came from came for prays that he loves everybody he loves the whole world but he came to the lost sheep came to bring them back to where they came from praise the Lord hallelujah I'm so thankful to God for his marvelous and Wonderful Grace hallelujah oh praise God I'm glad our father has come to us to reveal to us himself the spoken word to us that we might know him praise God do you know he all the stuff was set plainly out in the openness now making clear that his church he builds his church on Revelation and by Revelation everything about this church Brick by Brick and it's by Revelation every time he put Revelation between to cement the things together and the whole Foundation was was Revelation everything he built his church on Revelation by Revelation to the glory and praise of the Living God hallelujah amen yes sir praise the Lord here oh praise God let me just jump over some things here that he praise the Lord that we might move on and get through this praise the Lord hallelujah now we know according to I'm quoting brother Branham here now he's saying here now about two two thousand years ago this Deception come to a head and uh it came to a head and it was headed up in two men one of them named Jesus Christ and the other one named Judas Iscariot Hallelujah now Jesus Associated the the second coming that these two Spirits again now would be just a lot different than they were back there when he was now here it is where I want you to put on your glory Gardens these two Spirits are going to be different because Satan come and lived in a man that was just a carnal church member he lived in a carnal church member Judas Iscariot in the carnal church and he was a friend to the church all the time he was not some enemy fighting the church he was a friend to the church all the time but he come in and deceived or thought that he was deceiving his brother amen he came in tested the good things of God he heard all the preaching they got the same word from from the of the pulpit chastened of the good things of God and move right along in the spirit seeming to be went out and even went out and preached the gospel and him cast out Devils but down in him all the time he was Judas to begin with what he had a germ from Satan in him and one had a gene from God in Him Praise the Lord hallelujah amen do you know I think it's in perfect let me see a perfect faith brother Branham said do you know that they were afraid of the very message that they got a hold of and I know that thought of course coming from when they cross the sea and and and then they cry out and asked the Lord to come and help them in the storm and when he did come they said oh he's a ghost they were afraid of their very answers to their prayers and that happens in our day too that happens to us praise the Lord amen amen praise God yes sir and so when Revelation comes uh you would be shocked you are rejoicing over it and there's a lot of people afraid of it they're scared of it they don't want nothing to do with it because it would tear down all their long-held beliefs amen praise God hallelujah praise the Lord Jesus amen praise God hallelujah amen amen just give me a minute here praise the name of the Lord hallelujah I just want to get to a germ of things here now we know that the Holy Spirit has been leading us into the depths of the word just little by little and uh presenting by presenting the word to us in uh a new light but just like the prophet said the Bible become a new Bible it doesn't mean the Bible changed but he's seeing the Bible from a new light when he reads the verses and reads the things in it it comes with a new light on it praise the Lord and makes itself known to us that we might know him whom to know his life eternal praise the Lord amen and we know that any elected son or daughter God will see the word like that and will always be lined up 100 with the word of God now watch this we are now in this time we are coming to the making of the hundred millionth over here we are come right down to the sharp edge of the Gospel The Razor's Edge amen then a two-edged sword cutting even to the asunder of the bone and discerner Hallelujah he says God let it go through to them go through hallelujah it's a discerner of the thoughts of the mind that's the gospel the power of God the word of God made it made manifest is the gospel Hallelujah have you if the I want you to know if you caught what he really said there praise God and what we are doing now by the spirit to detect these men are in spirits in there see because it's the word now Discerning those spirits is the word doing that Hallelujah I I just got some things written here and there's so spidery that I've got to look carefully before I can tell you what I've got written here beside uh brother Brown may have a quotation and then what I see I might make the notes beside it and say what it's like amen praise God and imagine that the word discerns the spirit and then when you see them spirits come up and then they reject the unwritten word you quickly recognize or what kind of spirit is back there no matter how nice it looks on the outside you're looking at the word it denies the revealed word and it identifies that spirit that is back there because the word in you is Discerning that Spirit five minutes he said two minutes he said you'll know what spirit is in that person that's back there amen why because it's the word that is in you hallelujah amen praise the Lord hallelujah now we know the holy spirit being in the head that life from the headship has come down into the body amen and I believe this is the time when the Holy Spirit is working through this body and not that body to fulfill Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and they don't recognize it because it's not coming like Jesus with the long hair and the you know the groups From Galilee and that sort of stuff because just like he changed his form in the Melchizedek uh you know uh and Martha he's done the same thing now but it's coming as we said before and over and over again in the form of a bride because this is not the head Eve was taken out from Adam and she looked as if she was separate from Adam but it actually she was a part of Adam amen and she was a manifestation of him being revealed and now this many membered Bride is a manifestation of him being revealed hallelujah or praise God so the head is now revealing or manifesting himself through his right body glory be to God hallelujah amen praise the Lord and so I can confidently say I I'm not up here to discern diseases I'm not up here to try to discern all kinds of spirits and people though the holy spirit will do that whether I like it or not or you like it or not but we are not that is not the emphasis when brother Brennan was here God had to do that during those ages to capture the attention of the Bride because he was scattered everywhere and he had to do that to get grab their attention in that kind of a of a way Hallelujah so we are not here to discern X and pains and tell you and it's amazing how many of you have seen the prophet uh under the spirit of a discernment how many of you have seen that and heard the voice of God speaking through him and calling the people amen because it wasn't him people didn't understand it wasn't him it was the same Jesus that was there thousands of years ago come back and using a man's Temple and speaking out of him and that is why one time the voice said this is not William Branham speaking William Branham has only loaned me his body amen it was God I am the Lord come down amen that same God has come down not to William Brown but to a great body and using her praise God not to discern disease but now it's come down for you to discern the Antichrist spirit amen in the Lord's body and that's what he's Discerning not the sickness in the bodies out there but the sickness as the prophet said the sickest body that I know of is the body of Christ and now the the spirit of God is moving on that and he's Discerning the spirit of the Antichrist within his own body protesting them out of that body for the glory of God wherever he is God's spirit against his spirit amen praise the Lord and casting the devil away from us praise the Lord Jesus Christ I'm so thankful today that we are not left in the Darkness amen but we can walk in the light as he is in the light and have Fellowship one with the other and the blood of Jesus Christ God's only begotten son amen the only body that he created to live in amen oh my God the blood of Christ cleanses us washes us and brings us here today that we can sit in the presence of God and listen to the word of God praise the Lord now this is a broken up message that's scattered here and there but whatever peace says whatever germs whatever crumbs whatever loaves or or slices you can receive receive from it whatever is your portion feed upon whatever is your person that God has set down here for you today by the grace of God hallelujah God bless every one of you while the musicians are coming and we are rejoicing and singing for the praise of God and I'm so glad for uh the the praise team brother Anthony and all of you that were there uh yesterday for his glory and

was no sadness there there was just rejoicing that was just rejoicing a praising God hallelujah because what she had stepped into Glory amen and all the crosses shipboard had now become a crown
