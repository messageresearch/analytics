[2:49] declared
[2:51] o magnify the lord with me
[2:54] and let us exalt
[2:56] his
[2:58] letters all his name together
[3:01] i saw the lord and he heard me
[3:05] and delivered me from all my fears
[3:09] they looked unto him
[3:11] and were lightened and their face were
[3:13] not ashamed

[3:19] and save him out of all his trouble

[44:20] and the call of god's spirit came upon
[44:23] me
[44:25] uh my parents were not members of any
[44:27] church
[44:30] um
[44:31] all they knew they would read the bible
[44:33] and
[44:34] pray and sing
[44:36] but then when i got to about 14
[44:39] the pulsation of the spirit was so
[44:42] strong and powerful
[44:45] it caused me to hit the streets
[44:49] and going on the streets all i knew was
[44:52] that
[44:53] jesus
[44:54] lived and did miracles signs wonders
[44:58] died for our sins rose again hallelujah
[45:02] and
[45:02] that's all i knew and except you
[45:04] received the word of god you lost you
[45:06] you you're just finished so i just began
[45:09] to preach the word of god with a good
[45:11] friend of mine who still lives today and
[45:13] he's a major
[45:15] bishop in the united states praise god
[45:19] and i mean to a real and i'm saying this
[45:23] not to
[45:24] shine any light on me but on him and
[45:26] what he has accomplished he rose to the
[45:29] very heights
[45:30] of faith and religion in the united
[45:33] states
[45:35] until he began to do some prayer
[45:37] breakfast
[45:38] in the white house
[45:40] and knowing all the major evangelists
[45:43] you can think about
[45:44] billy graham swagger all of them they
[45:47] know him and he knows them as well as
[45:50] governors senators and so on
[45:52] but the point is to let you know where
[45:55] god took us from
[45:57] and where he's brought us
[46:01] our revival broke out
[46:03] we didn't even know what the revival was
[46:05] we didn't know that the revival was
[46:07] going on
[46:08] because we were praying for the sick and
[46:10] they were jumping up and we're saying oh
[46:11] this is what the bible is talking about
[46:13] because we think this is normal every
[46:15] christian ought to have this
[46:17] and
[46:18] uh people were jumping up and
[46:21] lives were being changed and
[46:24] the demons were cast out and so on
[46:27] and that caught the eyes of the
[46:29] assemblies of god denomination which
[46:31] gave us a scholarship to the college
[46:34] for three years by god's grace
[46:37] but i want to thank god at the
[46:40] end of that
[46:42] an old gentleman
[46:44] who was thought to be on nobody couldn't
[46:48] write his name
[46:50] i would read his letters for him
[46:53] and yet that man
[46:56] who would they know him because he
[46:59] crossed the country and tell people
[47:00] things you're gonna have a child this
[47:02] you're gonna have a son they say you're
[47:04] byron but you'll by next year this time
[47:07] it would happen over and over so all of
[47:09] the denominations knew him
[47:12] they hated him
[47:14] but yet they wanted him near them
[47:18] because whatever it was on him
[47:21] you know
[47:22] you could see it but that man believed
[47:25] and taught why this stayed away from him
[47:29] one god
[47:30] there's no three
[47:32] it's one
[47:34] that man believe what a baptism ought to
[47:38] be in the name not names of the father
[47:41] son and holy ghost
[47:43] and peter knew the name and said be
[47:45] baptized in the name of jesus christ
[47:48] that's all he knew and that's all he
[47:50] taught
[47:52] and oh my praise god i did a lot of
[47:55] prayer time with him and stuff like that
[47:57] the two of us alone would be praying
[47:59] praying for hours
[48:01] and you know
[48:04] that's where
[48:05] i began to print say lord
[48:08] there's got to be something beyond
[48:10] pentecost
[48:12] because
[48:13] i'm shortening everything because by
[48:14] that time i've risen to the heights of
[48:18] pentecost not what pentecost we see now
[48:22] i'm talking about when the real
[48:23] pentecost was coming to its end
[48:26] when
[48:28] the pastor would get up and say well the
[48:29] lord revealed to me a brother is going
[48:31] to come his name is so and so he's going
[48:34] to be here tomorrow to preach the word
[48:36] and um
[48:38] we'd all be in prayer and waiting on
[48:40] expectation
[48:42] and
[48:43] the service started but in the middle of
[48:45] the service the door opens and a
[48:47] gentleman walks in
[48:48] and when he walks in and the pastor
[48:51] would say oh brother so-and-so
[48:55] oh you know me but well the lord told us
[48:57] you're going to be here and you're
[49:00] you're supposed to preach and he'd come
[49:01] up and preach the word of god and i've
[49:03] seen other cases
[49:06] this is not even what i prepared to talk
[49:08] about
[49:10] but i've seen other cases where people
[49:12] come to take the communion
[49:15] and some of those men says
[49:17] don't
[49:18] don't touch it
[49:20] if you touch it
[49:22] they'll send
[49:23] for them to
[49:25] pack you out of here
[49:28] you'll die right on the spot don't even
[49:30] touch it because
[49:33] saturday night you were here here here
[49:35] here
[49:36] so they can't doubt so they back off
[49:40] but you see that
[49:43] we've seen times we're praying together
[49:45] we're preaching we're
[49:47] worshiping and then you see the clouds
[49:49] of glory
[49:51] passing over the congregation
[49:54] and then going on
[49:56] you see you're imagining no it sounds
[49:59] like imagination now
[50:02] because you don't see these things
[50:04] anymore
[50:06] now they're trying to beat it down with
[50:09] music
[50:10] they're trying to sing it down from the
[50:12] heavens
[50:14] they're trying to do everything but you
[50:17] don't tell god when to come when to go
[50:20] what to do whatever he moves as he wills
[50:25] praise god
[50:27] and i want to thank god and i saw
[50:29] pentecost rise to its height
[50:32] and uh
[50:33] you know and then started to fall
[50:36] right
[50:38] it started to fall
[50:40] until right now how are the mighty
[50:43] fallen
[50:44] fallen it has the outward looks as if
[50:47] it's all revival things are going great
[50:50] there's really no revival
[50:53] right there's a lot of fish in the net
[50:56] but
[50:56] a lot of them are snakes and crabs and
[51:00] all kind of other creatures in the net
[51:03] but the real fish the real fish
[51:06] there are very few of those
[51:09] but i want to thank god that i could be
[51:11] alive in this damn time
[51:13] as one who saw the ending of that
[51:17] right
[51:18] and was able to come into what is
[51:20] happening now
[51:23] right praise the lord god bless you let
[51:26] that be just my
[51:28] my comment that was thrown in there but
[51:31] praise the lord
[51:33] now we know we're talking about
[51:35] resurrection time
[51:38] and we know that when abraham
[51:42] had gotten or was living on the top of
[51:45] the mountain
[51:46] that he was visited
[51:49] by three men
[51:52] and as the three men
[51:54] three
[51:55] approached him
[51:58] right
[51:59] he said my lord
[52:03] elohim
[52:05] but even though that word
[52:08] they say it's plural
[52:10] it's really one just like how
[52:13] adam and eve
[52:15] they're standing in the garden two
[52:17] people
[52:19] what the bible says and god called their
[52:22] name adam
[52:25] right
[52:26] there they were so here three men and
[52:29] yet my lord
[52:31] amen
[52:33] and
[52:34] jesus now referring back to that
[52:37] says
[52:38] as it was
[52:40] in the days of sodom
[52:44] of lot
[52:45] so shall it be
[52:48] when the son of man is being revealed
[52:52] in other words
[52:54] the son of man would be veiled in human
[52:57] flesh again
[52:59] the god of heaven will come and live
[53:04] behind skin veils
[53:08] living
[53:08] in human flesh
[53:11] i want to thank god
[53:13] that he's the mighty god the everlasting
[53:16] father
[53:17] hallelujah
[53:18] praise god
[53:20] now
[53:21] he is saying in other words
[53:23] that
[53:24] god would now return
[53:29] in the form of his church
[53:33] in the form of his people
[53:36] he will no longer be hiding
[53:39] behind the tent named jesus
[53:45] but now he's in a many-membered body
[53:51] he came first
[53:54] as jesus the head the husband the bright
[53:59] groom
[54:00] of the body
[54:02] but now it's body time
[54:06] it's bright time
[54:09] it's your time
[54:11] it's my time
[54:13] it's the time of the holy ghost when he
[54:15] promised
[54:17] that the son of man would be revealed
[54:20] again
[54:22] praise god
[54:23] in other words god would be revealed as
[54:26] man
[54:27] not as jesus christ
[54:30] but in his people
[54:32] because remember
[54:34] uh eve was not different from adam
[54:38] for she came out of adam
[54:42] she was a part of him
[54:44] god did not go take up not a different
[54:47] piece of dirt to make her
[54:50] the same material that adam was made of
[54:54] the same material she was made of
[54:58] because he took her
[55:00] out of him
[55:03] spiritually now in our case jesus was
[55:06] there and is the word
[55:10] and his bride or his wife comes from him
[55:15] then if he was the word
[55:18] let the devil not confuse you blind you
[55:22] or make it so unbelievable to you that
[55:25] you cannot believe that the god of
[55:28] heaven has come down toward again to
[55:31] live in mankind that they may go back to
[55:36] being the word of god
[55:38] as they were
[55:40] in him
[55:41] before the foundation of the world
[55:44] in him
[55:45] when she was separated
[55:48] from him like eve was separated from
[55:51] adam
[55:53] so we look like we are now it's a many
[55:56] member body of
[55:57] thousands and thousands maybe millions
[55:59] of people
[56:00] but yet they are one
[56:04] let them recognize father that they are
[56:07] one
[56:08] right no matter how many there are one
[56:12] praise god what makes you one not just
[56:14] gathering together but your faith
[56:17] makes you want
[56:19] your revelation makes you one as isaiah
[56:22] said and in that day the watchmen on the
[56:26] walls of zion will begin to see eye to
[56:29] eye
[56:30] how are you going to see anything
[56:31] different we're looking we just we're
[56:33] looking at the same thing
[56:34] we're supposed to be looking at the same
[56:36] thing if we are seeing something
[56:39] different it means that somebody is
[56:40] putting their own view and their own
[56:43] concept
[56:44] on it
[56:45] but we can't look at the same thing and
[56:48] seeing two different three four five
[56:51] different things
[56:52] something is wrong somewhere when that
[56:55] begins to
[56:56] happen but thank god
[56:59] it's resurrection time again
[57:03] and the son of man is raised up and is
[57:06] revealing himself in human beings and
[57:09] true human beings
[57:11] look god portrayed all of this in the
[57:13] old testament
[57:16] because he used badger skins
[57:21] to veil
[57:23] the glory of god from the people
[57:25] [Music]
[57:27] it hid the glo god's glory from the
[57:29] people whatsoever
[57:31] praise god and i'm so glad
[57:34] when thousands around the world are
[57:37] celebrating easter as a tradition
[57:41] we can come in here and we can come
[57:43] wherever we are around the world we can
[57:47] come with real christian faith
[57:51] not by tradition but by revelation
[57:55] listen
[57:56] this bible this scripture
[57:59] was not given
[58:02] by education
[58:03] not by theology
[58:05] holy men wrote
[58:07] as they were moved by the holy spirit
[58:11] listen you've got to remember this is a
[58:13] supernatural book
[58:16] there was no book like this before
[58:19] there was nothing written
[58:21] when these men believe abraham enoch
[58:25] elijah there was nothing written that
[58:27] they were believing
[58:29] they had nothing they could read every
[58:31] day like we are to keep up our faith and
[58:34] to you know like a tomato plant to prop
[58:37] ourselves up unless we fall over
[58:40] no no no they had nothing
[58:44] all it was something supernatural
[58:48] invisible
[58:49] spoke into their hearts
[58:53] sometimes they heard a literal voice
[58:55] behind them
[58:57] but whatever that voice was
[59:00] oh praise god whatever the spirit of
[59:03] christ was hallelujah they recognized
[59:07] him
[59:09] and they recognized that that was the
[59:11] truth
[59:13] oh praise god and they they lived their
[59:17] life on that
[59:19] in other words if i'm going to vote i'm
[59:21] going to vote for for him
[59:23] if i'm going to live my life then i'll
[59:25] lay down for whatever that is i know
[59:28] that that's right
[59:29] and what's right that's why the bible
[59:32] says in hebrews 11 these all died in
[59:36] faith
[59:37] did he see anything they didn't read
[59:40] nothing or praise god they only put
[59:44] their faith in what god had made known
[59:47] to them
[59:48] yes i know moses came afterwards and
[59:51] wrote the ten commandments which was for
[59:54] the jews praise god but now we're under
[59:56] the gentile dispensation where the holy
[59:59] spirit is making yourself known praise
[1:00:02] god look god hiding behind the skin they
[1:00:06] knew god was in that temple
[1:00:09] they knew god was in there
[1:00:11] because the holy fire of god
[1:00:14] was above the around the place
[1:00:17] but it hid behind the veil of those
[1:00:20] skins hallelujah
[1:00:23] and traditions couldn't go in there to
[1:00:25] see it
[1:00:26] because the skins were hiding the word
[1:00:29] the skins were hiding the glory of god
[1:00:33] the skins were hiding the shekinah
[1:00:35] praise be to god hallelujah oh my so
[1:00:40] my friends there was no beauty to the
[1:00:42] desire of jesus christ when he came in
[1:00:45] this world
[1:00:47] because he was a disguise that god was
[1:00:51] wearing
[1:00:52] his name shall be called emmanuel
[1:00:55] meaning god with us
[1:00:57] it was god with them
[1:01:00] god walking around the people among his
[1:01:03] subjects so that he could be tempted
[1:01:05] tested tried
[1:01:07] learn obedience and so on by
[1:01:10] walking among his subjects to see
[1:01:13] what they're going through what their
[1:01:14] lies are like that he could be as the
[1:01:16] scripture said a
[1:01:18] high priest
[1:01:20] amen that can be touched by the feelings
[1:01:23] of our infirmities because he was not
[1:01:27] tempted with any other temptation less
[1:01:29] than you had but more than all of us he
[1:01:32] bore every temptation and he overcame
[1:01:37] so he knows what it is to go through
[1:01:41] praise god there was no beauty to be
[1:01:43] desired of him hallelujah the lord made
[1:01:47] flesh among us praise god hallelujah and
[1:01:51] it's the same thing happening today
[1:01:53] again
[1:01:54] for this that same son of man
[1:01:58] is being revealed again now
[1:02:01] but in you and me
[1:02:04] but what people will look at there is no
[1:02:07] beautiful desires of that i know him
[1:02:11] i know her
[1:02:13] i know what he'd done
[1:02:15] i know what she done
[1:02:17] i know what this other one done you are
[1:02:20] looking at all of those things and yet
[1:02:23] you don't see the glory of god hiding
[1:02:26] behind that skin
[1:02:30] that veil
[1:02:31] hallelujah
[1:02:33] i know him he used to be a drunkard
[1:02:36] i know her i remember when she used to
[1:02:38] use drugs
[1:02:40] and all kinds of things like that
[1:02:42] brother sister we don't care what
[1:02:45] they've done
[1:02:47] if they sincerely surrender themselves
[1:02:50] to jesus christ and they are washed by
[1:02:52] the blood of jesus christ and they have
[1:02:54] seen the word of god for their day and
[1:02:57] it supports them of their sins and out
[1:03:01] of their past
[1:03:02] he closed the book in the temple and
[1:03:05] today he wants to close the book on your
[1:03:08] past he want to close the book on every
[1:03:11] single thing you've done and set you
[1:03:13] free completely that you might worship
[1:03:15] him and walk with him alone praise god
[1:03:19] amen oh praise god i want to tell you
[1:03:23] them skins that was once on the badger
[1:03:27] god was using that skin now
[1:03:30] to hide his glory
[1:03:32] praise god forevermore
[1:03:35] oh
[1:03:36] and so god was being housed or had his
[1:03:39] habitation behind those skins
[1:03:42] i want to thank god today that god has
[1:03:46] come again in our time and we have given
[1:03:49] up our sins praise god hallelujah but
[1:03:54] sometimes we gave it up and sometimes
[1:03:57] god had to skin us alive
[1:04:01] by hebrews
[1:04:02] amen
[1:04:04] the word of god is quick
[1:04:06] sharper than a two-edged sword oh skin
[1:04:09] you are lying take your skin off for you
[1:04:12] get behind your skin that he can hide by
[1:04:16] behind your skin and walk amongst the
[1:04:19] people it god hiding in simplicity
[1:04:22] oh
[1:04:23] and doing the same by his grace
[1:04:26] amen
[1:04:27] yes
[1:04:28] and behind that skin
[1:04:31] on the outside when the people look all
[1:04:33] they saw was badger skins
[1:04:36] oh my
[1:04:37] yes he's just like me she's just like me
[1:04:41] the other one is just like me
[1:04:44] god made it thus
[1:04:46] to be like that
[1:04:48] god might even make you look and see
[1:04:50] some of their mistakes
[1:04:52] deliberately make you look and see some
[1:04:54] of their mistakes so that you can be
[1:04:56] distracted and don't see that gleam of
[1:04:59] glory hiding behind that veil
[1:05:02] oh my praise god but the word of god was
[1:05:06] back at that veil i believe the word of
[1:05:08] god is back in some of these veils here
[1:05:10] today
[1:05:11] amen the shekinah glory was back of that
[1:05:15] veil praise the lord and more than that
[1:05:19] there this shoe bread was behind
[1:05:22] them that veil at that particular time
[1:05:25] glory to god
[1:05:27] all the glory of god was hiding behind
[1:05:31] that veil praise god even the manna
[1:05:35] everything was right behind that veil
[1:05:38] praise god and all
[1:05:41] you can do when you get behind that veil
[1:05:44] is walk in the light
[1:05:48] the light of his presence that was
[1:05:50] behind the veil
[1:05:52] all the priests could do was walk in the
[1:05:55] light
[1:05:56] and we are asked to do the same thing in
[1:05:59] our day and time
[1:06:01] is the walk in the light
[1:06:03] and that
[1:06:04] light will preserve you like it preserve
[1:06:07] the shoe brand
[1:06:08] that same light praise god will watch
[1:06:12] over you every step of the way that you
[1:06:15] are taking
[1:06:16] glory to god hallelujah
[1:06:19] oh my listen what paul says
[1:06:23] changing from glory unto glory
[1:06:27] hallelujah my friends that's what has
[1:06:30] got to happen we change from one glory
[1:06:33] to another glory until you go back to
[1:06:36] your original glory like jesus said all
[1:06:40] father would glorify me with the glory i
[1:06:44] had with thee before the foundation of
[1:06:48] the world praise god every saint of god
[1:06:51] every child of god are parts of the
[1:06:54] stars of the spirit of christ amen and
[1:06:57] that glory of the light of god in you
[1:07:00] god wants you to brighten every corner
[1:07:02] where you are shine the light that is
[1:07:05] within your soul touch lives and change
[1:07:08] hearts for his glory and for his honor
[1:07:11] blessed be the name of god hallelujah
[1:07:14] thanks be to god now i'm use the term
[1:07:17] elohim
[1:07:20] and the reason why he's called elohim
[1:07:23] is because and the word is plural is
[1:07:26] because in him
[1:07:28] was attributes
[1:07:32] amen
[1:07:33] people stumble over when god said let us
[1:07:36] make man
[1:07:38] uh you know into our own image
[1:07:43] they stumble over these things they
[1:07:45] don't realize it's one person speaking
[1:07:48] but they're speaking for a whole
[1:07:51] a whole race of people
[1:07:54] not not natural spiritual he's speaking
[1:07:57] about a whole super race
[1:08:00] and he's speaking with one boy you know
[1:08:01] that naturally even queen elizabeth now
[1:08:04] we are not amused we who is she alone
[1:08:07] talking but she is speaking of all the
[1:08:10] generations behind her
[1:08:13] right so god now is
[1:08:16] had attributes in him amen
[1:08:19] praise god you believe that
[1:08:23] and there's one god
[1:08:25] and then god showed on pentecost
[1:08:28] how he broke himself into pieces and
[1:08:31] portions
[1:08:32] and went into these apostles
[1:08:36] so a part of god was in these apostles
[1:08:39] they were not god almighty
[1:08:42] but they as jesus said ye are gods
[1:08:46] and children of the most high
[1:08:49] praise god so being part of god amen
[1:08:54] they moved in his grace and the presence
[1:08:57] and the power of god in them them
[1:09:00] identified them that they were part of
[1:09:04] the living god now we know that
[1:09:07] we were
[1:09:08] if we are believers in god as his
[1:09:10] attributes
[1:09:12] and jesus came to be our savior and our
[1:09:15] redeemer how many knows that
[1:09:18] oh praise god well the word redeem
[1:09:22] means buy back
[1:09:24] praise the lord
[1:09:26] it's like if um
[1:09:27] let's say sister sheila
[1:09:29] who went to poland uh uh
[1:09:32] you know a hairpin or something like
[1:09:35] that that's made of gold uh to be able
[1:09:38] to raise some money for funds to do
[1:09:40] something
[1:09:42] and uh that that gold hairpin or that
[1:09:47] authentic piece would be in the pawn
[1:09:48] shop right
[1:09:50] and when the time came she wants to
[1:09:53] redeem it
[1:09:54] that she might take it back because it's
[1:09:56] her own
[1:09:57] right
[1:09:59] it says born again
[1:10:01] so he's taking back what is his own
[1:10:06] but because he allowed us to come down
[1:10:10] in this world of sin
[1:10:12] and and satan got the control over us
[1:10:17] the only price that could purchase us
[1:10:20] back was his own blood
[1:10:24] but we are redeemed not with silver and
[1:10:27] gold but by the precious blood of christ
[1:10:30] hallelujah and when we say blood we're
[1:10:33] not talking about the blood that was
[1:10:34] painted on the cross
[1:10:36] because you know the life is in the
[1:10:39] blood
[1:10:41] that red was only for the human eyes
[1:10:44] mortal to know that something went out
[1:10:47] of him that was unseen
[1:10:50] but that was just a symbol
[1:10:52] but to this day millions are still
[1:10:55] power in the blood power in the blood
[1:10:57] and they're thinking of that blood back
[1:11:00] there they're not realizing that that
[1:11:02] blood is really the holy spirit himself
[1:11:07] amen
[1:11:08] oh praise god so the life is in the
[1:11:11] blood so he came to bring us back
[1:11:14] where we started from
[1:11:16] praise the lord god hallelujah and where
[1:11:20] you started from you started in god's
[1:11:23] thinking
[1:11:25] that's where you started for in god's
[1:11:27] thinking
[1:11:28] right
[1:11:29] praise god i was in my father's loins
[1:11:33] before i actually arrived here on the
[1:11:35] scene we were in god's mind before we
[1:11:38] arrived here on the scene
[1:11:41] now god by his great holy spirit
[1:11:44] hallelujah
[1:11:46] amen
[1:11:48] uh shaped every one of us
[1:11:51] we all different here
[1:11:53] everyone
[1:11:54] even if you had twins in this building
[1:11:57] they still be different
[1:11:59] because they make up maybe different
[1:12:01] this is different in different ways but
[1:12:04] we are all different because god in
[1:12:08] making us shaped us and formed us that
[1:12:11] way praise god amen
[1:12:14] and if not so god knows right where you
[1:12:17] belong
[1:12:19] he knows where you belong
[1:12:22] he knows
[1:12:23] where you belong
[1:12:25] praise the lord hallelujah and therefore
[1:12:29] i want you to know
[1:12:31] if you really have eternal life
[1:12:34] as i've said many many times
[1:12:37] you never began
[1:12:41] and you will never end
[1:12:44] hallelujah
[1:12:46] you're not conscious of it
[1:12:48] but that's why the word has come to make
[1:12:51] you conscious of who you really are
[1:12:55] you're not just another human walking
[1:12:57] around the earth not knowing who you are
[1:12:59] where you come from who your father is
[1:13:01] or what is the order or resurrection of
[1:13:03] promises of god in the word amen but you
[1:13:06] recognize fully who you are
[1:13:10] and then you're able to step into your
[1:13:13] possessions possess your possessions
[1:13:16] and accept the benefits of resurrection
[1:13:20] recognizing who your father is and that
[1:13:22] he has died and his will has been read
[1:13:26] under the opening of the seven seals
[1:13:29] and that you are now accepting what he
[1:13:33] has left for you you have come into your
[1:13:36] supernatural inheritance
[1:13:38] by the power of the holy spirit amen and
[1:13:41] you have the right to take what is yours
[1:13:44] by faith in the word of god hallelujah
[1:13:47] oh my you've been predestinated to this
[1:13:51] mystery of god
[1:13:53] predestinated to this hour and to this
[1:13:55] position that you might receive what god
[1:13:58] has given to you amen you have you never
[1:14:02] had a beginning and you never had an end
[1:14:05] hallelujah
[1:14:06] and i want you to know you always
[1:14:10] were
[1:14:13] you always were
[1:14:17] you i say again you may not yet be
[1:14:20] conscious of it
[1:14:22] amen
[1:14:23] but you always were
[1:14:26] so when
[1:14:28] uh the the false view mistakenly false
[1:14:33] view
[1:14:34] because of not having to say listen this
[1:14:38] bible as i was saying
[1:14:40] was given by inspiration
[1:14:43] then if you're going to receive it it's
[1:14:46] got to be received again by inspiration
[1:14:50] hallelujah
[1:14:52] you know when we met used to make tapes
[1:14:54] or we make cds they're moving at a
[1:14:57] certain speed
[1:14:58] is that right
[1:15:01] when the
[1:15:02] tape or the cd is like this and i put it
[1:15:04] here it can't talk to you
[1:15:08] this bible sitting here can't really
[1:15:10] talk to you
[1:15:11] but when it goes back into another tape
[1:15:15] recorder
[1:15:17] and even though it's in there
[1:15:20] if that tape recorded doesn't speed up
[1:15:23] enough
[1:15:25] the same speed like it was given
[1:15:27] it can't
[1:15:29] replicate the same thing to let the
[1:15:31] voice speak again
[1:15:33] so that the people can hear the voice of
[1:15:35] god on the divine inspiration am i
[1:15:38] making any sense steve
[1:15:39] praise the lord
[1:15:41] hallelujah so the same spirit
[1:15:45] the same anointing has to return
[1:15:48] and come again amongst his people
[1:15:51] glory to god and to make the word of god
[1:15:55] live again hallelujah
[1:15:59] the word eternal means something that
[1:16:00] never had a beginning something that
[1:16:02] will never end
[1:16:05] so in reality
[1:16:06] if you're a true believer you weren't
[1:16:09] saved
[1:16:10] on a certain certain day
[1:16:13] that is when you become aware
[1:16:16] that you were rarely lost
[1:16:19] and needed to be saved but you weren't
[1:16:21] saved on that day
[1:16:23] because in actual fact the lamb was
[1:16:25] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:16:28] and the lamb knew he were who he was
[1:16:30] dying for before the foundation of the
[1:16:32] world you are already in his mind before
[1:16:35] the foundation of the world he's now
[1:16:37] come to claim what is his own
[1:16:41] he come to claim what is his own praise
[1:16:44] peter god hallelujah being the attribute
[1:16:47] of god hallelujah and being the
[1:16:50] attribute of god which is the word of
[1:16:52] god now that god come comes into your
[1:16:55] life and you are here and you are uh
[1:16:58] trying to be like jesus and to live the
[1:17:01] life he live
[1:17:02] you become what you you become um
[1:17:07] what i would say you become a one that
[1:17:10] can
[1:17:10] be one that is a display of the word or
[1:17:15] you become the word made manifest
[1:17:19] the word made manifest for the word of
[1:17:23] god is expressing itself in and through
[1:17:26] you praise god remember there's only one
[1:17:29] bible right
[1:17:31] but inside of this bible look how many
[1:17:33] words
[1:17:35] is that right
[1:17:37] in the beginning
[1:17:39] was the word
[1:17:42] is that right
[1:17:43] but praise god in the end what happened
[1:17:47] we find out uh you are a word
[1:17:51] but all those little i am a word you are
[1:17:55] a word he's a word all those words make
[1:17:58] up the
[1:17:59] word
[1:18:01] and in the beginning was the word
[1:18:06] and where was the word the word was with
[1:18:08] god
[1:18:10] and the word was god
[1:18:14] hallelujah praise god is that too much
[1:18:17] for you to believe
[1:18:19] amen
[1:18:21] praise the lord jesus hallelujah
[1:18:24] praise god you know
[1:18:28] if i am to say
[1:18:29] um microphone
[1:18:31] in an in a nanosecond while i'm thinking
[1:18:35] to say
[1:18:36] microphone i i already visualize a
[1:18:39] microphone
[1:18:42] human beings are made like god in his
[1:18:44] image
[1:18:46] so before i could say pew or table or
[1:18:50] or whatever anything you think about
[1:18:53] you quickly get a picture in your mind
[1:18:55] without even thinking you don't have to
[1:18:56] do nothing for that to happen you're
[1:18:58] made that way
[1:19:00] that's the same thing with god
[1:19:02] right
[1:19:03] so
[1:19:05] when god
[1:19:06] spoke about having
[1:19:09] a wife or a bride
[1:19:12] he already knew every single one that
[1:19:13] will make up that bride
[1:19:16] just as much as when a virgin will
[1:19:19] conceive and bear islam do you think
[1:19:22] that god had to wait
[1:19:24] until mary got born
[1:19:26] and then he knew which virgin is going
[1:19:28] to be no he already knew
[1:19:31] it's the same way i'm telling you
[1:19:34] he knew you
[1:19:37] hallelujah
[1:19:39] he knew you that's why he called you
[1:19:42] that's why he
[1:19:43] glorify you and anoint you with the holy
[1:19:46] ghost and send you here today that you
[1:19:48] might hear god's word for this hour
[1:19:51] amen praise god forevermore hallelujah
[1:19:56] amen as the psalm said
[1:19:58] when he was on the cross i was on his
[1:20:02] mind
[1:20:03] yes he knew me
[1:20:05] he knew you before you were he was even
[1:20:08] on the cross
[1:20:10] so that's why you came on his mind
[1:20:13] because he was thinking of you and of
[1:20:15] saving you and i'm talking individually
[1:20:18] i'm not talking about god thinking of a
[1:20:21] mass of people
[1:20:23] he knew you
[1:20:25] he knew me
[1:20:27] he knew all my mistakes
[1:20:30] praised god he knew all my stumblings
[1:20:33] all my failings god know knows me and
[1:20:37] despite knowing you he loved me
[1:20:41] thank god he loved every one of us
[1:20:45] my
[1:20:46] god hallelujah praise god and if god
[1:20:51] ordained you to see this what i'm
[1:20:53] talking about
[1:20:55] hallelujah you can't fail to see it
[1:20:59] you can't stop yourself from seeing it
[1:21:02] because only certain people are
[1:21:04] permitted to see it
[1:21:06] only certain people are made shaped
[1:21:09] formed and empowered by god to be able
[1:21:12] to see his glory hiding behind the veil
[1:21:16] oh praise god hallelujah
[1:21:19] amen i tell you we're coming you're
[1:21:22] coming forth in the resurrection right
[1:21:24] now
[1:21:25] there's another resurrection going on
[1:21:28] not the one back there but there's a
[1:21:30] resurrection going on right now in this
[1:21:33] day and in this hour a real easter a
[1:21:36] present-day easter is taking place with
[1:21:39] a resurrection right now glory to god
[1:21:42] hallelujah amen do you know
[1:21:47] again misunderstanding false doctrine
[1:21:51] jesus is coming
[1:21:53] the coming of christ
[1:21:56] he's been coming since the day of
[1:21:57] pentecost
[1:21:59] do you know that
[1:22:01] he's been coming
[1:22:03] praise god
[1:22:05] that's the way that the baptists were
[1:22:07] born
[1:22:09] that's the way the methodist was born
[1:22:13] born into a resurrection
[1:22:16] of their day
[1:22:18] amen so the new birth puts you into the
[1:22:23] resurrection
[1:22:25] process that is going on as i've taught
[1:22:28] the other night resurrection or a
[1:22:30] rapture is not one sudden event on a
[1:22:32] certain day and we've gone up like that
[1:22:35] of course god can do that but it's a
[1:22:37] process
[1:22:39] leading to the finality of the whole
[1:22:42] thing
[1:22:43] an event
[1:22:44] right and we go out of here by the grace
[1:22:47] of god oh praises wonderful name i'm so
[1:22:51] glad that he's the same yesterday today
[1:22:54] and forever so every single age had
[1:22:58] their wave
[1:23:00] of the resurrection
[1:23:02] every age had a wave of his coming
[1:23:07] praise god but how he came to that first
[1:23:09] aid second age third age might appear
[1:23:13] different but it's all steps of his
[1:23:16] coming coming coming coming to the edge
[1:23:19] and to this last leodision church edge
[1:23:22] at the end of it all he comes and takes
[1:23:25] the whole thing away praise god
[1:23:27] oh praise god amen blessed be his name
[1:23:31] praise god i'm so glad that another wave
[1:23:35] is rolling in right now right now
[1:23:38] at pentecost they said another wave
[1:23:41] rolls in well another wave is rolling in
[1:23:44] what we are in the middle of is another
[1:23:46] wave of resurrection another wave of the
[1:23:50] coming of christ hallelujah the real
[1:23:53] easter in your soul the real
[1:23:56] resurrection of god raising you about
[1:23:59] the things of the world hallelujah
[1:24:02] amen praise god i tell your friends
[1:24:06] i'm glad that i'm in this move of god
[1:24:09] for this day amen praise god so the
[1:24:12] bride body is being raised up
[1:24:15] that's the resurrection we are in right
[1:24:17] now
[1:24:18] the whole bright body is being raised up
[1:24:21] by the power of god for if the same
[1:24:23] spirit that raised christ from the dead
[1:24:26] well in you
[1:24:27] will also quicken your mortal body
[1:24:32] by the spirit that dwell in you i'm
[1:24:34] thinking of a place where
[1:24:36] um
[1:24:38] a fish was dead
[1:24:40] and
[1:24:41] you know
[1:24:42] and the spirit of god spoke to brother
[1:24:44] branham and said
[1:24:47] pray for that fish
[1:24:49] this is a silly little thing like that
[1:24:51] praying for a fish
[1:24:52] nevertheless you pray for that fish
[1:24:55] he prayed for the fish and the fish come
[1:24:57] to life and
[1:24:58] start swimming away oh my and that fish
[1:25:01] was dead but four hours
[1:25:03] you know in the water like that is
[1:25:06] impossible but the fish lived
[1:25:09] and then he said oh i understand that
[1:25:11] he's saying
[1:25:12] that if
[1:25:14] he can bring a fish to life that is just
[1:25:17] such a little inconsequential thing what
[1:25:20] about his sons and daughters if he could
[1:25:22] speak a word to make a fish live what
[1:25:25] about making you live
[1:25:27] would he raise you up in the last day
[1:25:30] would he bring you back to what you are
[1:25:32] before
[1:25:33] that's the promise of the living god if
[1:25:36] you can speak the world into existence
[1:25:38] he can speak you back into life for the
[1:25:41] glory of god hallelujah now you know the
[1:25:44] word rapture is not uh found in the
[1:25:46] bible when when you're tired let me know
[1:25:52] praise god yes because sometimes the
[1:25:54] speaker gets so caught up you don't
[1:25:55] realize uh what's happening amongst the
[1:25:58] people uh amen you're not gonna throw me
[1:26:01] off if you get up and stretch your
[1:26:04] hands or your feet praise god
[1:26:08] but you know the word rapture is not
[1:26:10] even used in the bible
[1:26:12] but it's a commonly used word in
[1:26:14] christianity but it's not written in the
[1:26:17] bible that you can say rapture
[1:26:19] and we do use the word rapture and we
[1:26:22] understand what rapture means but i'm
[1:26:24] just telling you the facts that it is
[1:26:26] not really written
[1:26:29] in the bible
[1:26:31] the bible itself says
[1:26:33] that we are caught up
[1:26:36] hallelujah
[1:26:38] the great order of the rapture that was
[1:26:41] given is
[1:26:42] amen that jesus would raise of jesus
[1:26:45] race which he has already praise god one
[1:26:48] wave of the resurrection praise the lord
[1:26:52] and how
[1:26:53] that
[1:26:54] the
[1:26:55] the the dead in christ will be raised up
[1:26:58] first
[1:26:59] after him
[1:27:00] and the next order is which we who are
[1:27:04] alive and remain
[1:27:06] praise god
[1:27:07] we will be changed
[1:27:09] praise god and we will be caught away
[1:27:12] with christ i won't even
[1:27:14] that's another subject we're going to be
[1:27:15] changed while we're still living
[1:27:18] we didn't have to die but he's still
[1:27:20] living
[1:27:21] in other words if all the other saints
[1:27:24] have passed away and they all slept and
[1:27:26] you happen to be still alive and that's
[1:27:29] his time for the rapture and the
[1:27:31] resurrection
[1:27:32] and you happen to still be alive the
[1:27:35] bible paul is saying if you're still
[1:27:36] alive at a time you are going to just be
[1:27:40] changed by the power of god
[1:27:43] hallelujah praise god hallelujah now
[1:27:47] three things happen before the lord
[1:27:48] himself appears on the scene praise the
[1:27:51] lord and we are waiting for that hymn to
[1:27:55] appear in that way the shout
[1:27:58] the voice
[1:28:00] and the trumpet
[1:28:02] before jesus
[1:28:03] appears
[1:28:05] what is a shout it's a message
[1:28:07] that you know of it's a message going
[1:28:10] forward in other words and what is the
[1:28:12] message the message was the the bread of
[1:28:16] life
[1:28:17] amen to bring forth the bride that she
[1:28:20] might feed on the bread of life that
[1:28:23] will bring her forth into life praise be
[1:28:27] to god
[1:28:28] hallelujah how wonderful this is to know
[1:28:32] that he is the same yesterday today and
[1:28:36] forever praise god hallelujah
[1:28:39] you remember when jesus was here when he
[1:28:42] raised up
[1:28:43] then he raised up the bible said he
[1:28:45] descended into hell preached to the
[1:28:47] spirits in prison and then
[1:28:50] they were seen for 40 days in the city
[1:28:52] of jerusalem and the bible says he
[1:28:55] ascended up on high and he took them all
[1:28:58] with him now we know that our our
[1:29:02] catholic uh friends uh our brothers and
[1:29:06] sisters
[1:29:07] uh in christ praise the lord
[1:29:10] they claim that there's a place called
[1:29:12] paradise
[1:29:14] there was such a place called paradise
[1:29:17] but jesus emptied it out
[1:29:20] he empty out all you see because there
[1:29:23] was this place where the patriarchs and
[1:29:26] the prophets
[1:29:27] who could see that jesus was going to
[1:29:30] die for their sins
[1:29:32] because in the lambs that were being
[1:29:34] killed
[1:29:36] they could see like a bell from the very
[1:29:38] beginning
[1:29:39] could see that from the lambs being
[1:29:41] killed that there was going to come a
[1:29:43] real perfect lamb
[1:29:45] that was going to die for them
[1:29:47] so they believe unto
[1:29:51] eternal life
[1:29:53] right
[1:29:54] we are looking back now
[1:29:57] so
[1:29:58] we are in a better position because we
[1:29:59] know it happened
[1:30:01] and now we can believe towards that to
[1:30:04] be born again
[1:30:06] right but it's the same old testament
[1:30:08] new testament um hebrews 11 there they
[1:30:12] believe unto praise god so here it is
[1:30:16] that he took them and emptied out all of
[1:30:19] paradise
[1:30:21] and took them with him back to glory
[1:30:24] so paradise doesn't exist anymore
[1:30:28] there's no use for it no need for it
[1:30:31] because he has fulfilled uh his position
[1:30:35] of all the types being the perfect
[1:30:37] sacrifice the perfect lamb without spot
[1:30:40] blemish examined by the priests the
[1:30:43] rabbis and everything questioning him
[1:30:46] setting traps for him uh everything else
[1:30:49] they deliberately say something and see
[1:30:51] how we can react to it you know
[1:30:53] sometimes believers do that to their
[1:30:55] pastor and they don't realize that there
[1:30:57] is something new
[1:30:59] no you're not doing anything new and
[1:31:01] you're doing what's already been done
[1:31:03] and
[1:31:04] the holy spirit has his own way anyway
[1:31:06] praise the name of the lord jesus
[1:31:08] brother sister
[1:31:10] and
[1:31:11] the bible tells us
[1:31:13] amen
[1:31:14] hallelujah that god
[1:31:17] brought them all out but you see
[1:31:21] he showed us what he was going to do
[1:31:22] before he did it
[1:31:24] because he went to the tomb of lazarus
[1:31:28] and said lazarus comfort
[1:31:31] and his loud voice
[1:31:34] woke up lazarus
[1:31:36] hallelujah no matter how many ages
[1:31:40] that his spirit had
[1:31:42] traveled and gone down maybe into this
[1:31:44] edge
[1:31:45] that voice that sounded back there
[1:31:48] echoed down through the edges right
[1:31:51] until this time
[1:31:53] and it woke up lazarus the last of us
[1:31:57] it woke us up to the word that we might
[1:32:00] recognize him our day and the message
[1:32:03] for our day praise god forevermore
[1:32:06] hallelujah and so it woke up last round
[1:32:09] it was that same voice hallelujah shout
[1:32:13] is a message
[1:32:14] and that same voice woke up those saints
[1:32:18] that were there in the prison and took
[1:32:20] him out
[1:32:21] and that same voice that was the
[1:32:24] that was the
[1:32:26] first rapture that was taking place
[1:32:28] there do you know that
[1:32:31] and now the second rapture is going to
[1:32:34] be the our catching away
[1:32:36] our catching way of the bride praise god
[1:32:40] by the spirit of the living god because
[1:32:42] the old testament saints have already
[1:32:45] gone into the presence of the living god
[1:32:48] and when he see he got or was on the
[1:32:51] cross
[1:32:52] and the bible says and he lifted up his
[1:32:55] voice and screamed with a loud voice a
[1:32:59] lamborghini hallelujah and he gave up
[1:33:03] the ghost
[1:33:05] when he screamed that loud voice the
[1:33:07] same voice that raised lazarus from the
[1:33:09] grave that voice penetrated right into
[1:33:12] him satan knew that his dominion was
[1:33:15] over
[1:33:16] and the mighty conqueror had come the
[1:33:19] great one hallelujah the lion of the
[1:33:22] tribe of judah the mighty god the
[1:33:25] everlasting father amen prince of peace
[1:33:28] amen yes sir praise god forevermore and
[1:33:32] so we know that he's here again for this
[1:33:36] second part of the rapture
[1:33:39] saints that are living
[1:33:42] and saints
[1:33:44] that are dead
[1:33:46] and passing over all these things
[1:33:48] because there are subjects all
[1:33:51] by themselves
[1:33:54] so
[1:33:54] the shout the message the voice his
[1:33:58] voice amen will touch a little later
[1:34:01] praise god what is the trumpet
[1:34:04] what is the trumpet then
[1:34:06] praise god it's the gospel trumpet you
[1:34:10] see they're always looking for something
[1:34:12] spectacular a trumpet listen i was i
[1:34:16] remember my sister when she had first
[1:34:18] come to believe and born again she lived
[1:34:20] near the army camps
[1:34:23] and the soldiers you know they wake up
[1:34:25] on time
[1:34:26] early in the morning a certain time and
[1:34:28] they would have to blow the trumpet amen
[1:34:32] and
[1:34:33] her mother had to tell her get back to
[1:34:34] bed because when that trumpet blew she
[1:34:36] jumped out of bed oh hallelujah i'm
[1:34:38] coming lord oh jesus i'm ready
[1:34:42] listen no it's the army trumpet next
[1:34:44] door
[1:34:47] well she thinks it's a trumpet of the
[1:34:48] lord
[1:34:50] because they're thinking of that kind
[1:34:53] of trumpet
[1:34:55] but the trumpet the scriptures is
[1:34:57] talking about is the gospel trumpet
[1:35:01] that same trumpet that came luther
[1:35:05] sounded part of it and so on down
[1:35:08] through the age hallelujah you don't see
[1:35:11] the compound
[1:35:13] meaning of
[1:35:14] scripture and history being fulfilled
[1:35:18] in one person or one voice they can't
[1:35:20] see that but it's the same god making
[1:35:23] him himself known praise god hallelujah
[1:35:27] so i'm thankful to god
[1:35:30] amen
[1:35:31] that the same bread room that was at the
[1:35:34] beginning has traveled through time and
[1:35:37] is here again now to pick up
[1:35:40] his wife his bride praise the name of
[1:35:43] the lord in this day and in this hour
[1:35:46] and i'm so thankful that she has heard
[1:35:49] his voice
[1:35:50] and has responded to it praise the lord
[1:35:53] amen glory to god
[1:35:56] hallelujah okay i want to move on here
[1:36:00] to talk about um
[1:36:02] the bible tells us we're going to be
[1:36:03] caught up how many believe that
[1:36:06] you really believe that
[1:36:09] we're going to be caught up i'll touch a
[1:36:11] little bit on it praise the lord
[1:36:13] praise the lord
[1:36:15] now brother branham speaking now i don't
[1:36:18] want to say translation
[1:36:21] see paul was caught up into the first
[1:36:23] heaven and what he seen
[1:36:26] no i was caught up in the first heaven
[1:36:29] and what i seen you know his message on
[1:36:32] look past the curtain of time and so on
[1:36:35] but he said but paul he was caught up in
[1:36:38] the third heavens
[1:36:40] but he couldn't even talk about that
[1:36:42] amen see
[1:36:45] if he was caught up
[1:36:48] then i
[1:36:50] would have to catch up
[1:36:53] with him
[1:36:55] to be caught up
[1:36:57] right praise the lord
[1:36:59] oh my
[1:37:01] i'll give you an example one time he
[1:37:03] said i was in germany
[1:37:06] and i had to stop brother schuman i said
[1:37:08] brother schuman stop stop the rest of
[1:37:11] them are going with us
[1:37:14] and they they're trying their best to
[1:37:16] catch up they're trying their best to
[1:37:19] catch up with us and we just let's just
[1:37:22] wait here so that they can catch up with
[1:37:26] us praise the name of the lord don't you
[1:37:28] understand we are encompassed with a
[1:37:30] cloud of witnesses
[1:37:32] and they are all waiting on us to catch
[1:37:34] up so that we can all be caught up
[1:37:36] together

[1:37:39] praise god you've got to catch up so
[1:37:43] that we can all be caught up catch up
[1:37:46] how with your understanding of the word
[1:37:49] you got to catch up to what the apostles
[1:37:52] had what the apostles believed what they
[1:37:54] received you got to catch up so that you
[1:37:57] could be caught up in the presence of

[1:38:31] type they were typing christ
[1:38:34] and the bride
[1:38:36] elijah
[1:38:38] you might as well say jehovah
[1:38:41] that's her
[1:38:42] right it's a symbol of the old testament
[1:38:47] the new testament
[1:38:49] because the eagle or the bird has got
[1:38:51] two wings to fly
[1:38:53] you've got to have balance to be able to
[1:38:55] fly so it's got to have those two wings

[1:39:46] both of them of course elijah and elisha

[1:39:52] and the saints that are already dead
[1:39:55] amen praise god hallelujah amen praise
[1:39:59] god and if you are filled with the holy
[1:40:02] spirit here today by the grace of god

[1:40:09] moving in your life i'm going to bring
[1:40:11] this to an end now even though i have
[1:40:13] not finished all i have to say but i've
[1:40:16] been to an end
[1:40:17] now because let me tell you
[1:40:21] if god is in your life and is moving in
[1:40:23] your life right now and he does things
[1:40:26] so simply
[1:40:28] uh first of all i want you to know you
[1:40:30] won't have to stand in the judgment
[1:40:33] you've heard about the white throne
[1:40:34] judgment the white trump judgment
[1:40:37] is for sinners
[1:40:39] and unbelievers
[1:40:42] right the judgment of believers
[1:40:46] is not as the way you're going to go
[1:40:49] but it's us to rewards that you're going
[1:40:52] to receive
[1:40:54] amen praise the name of the lord
[1:40:57] because
[1:40:58] he says if you judge yourselves now you
[1:41:01] will not be judged but what was he
[1:41:04] talking about if you judge yourself by
[1:41:07] the word
[1:41:08] you allow the word
[1:41:10] to
[1:41:11] circumcise you clean you up cleanse you
[1:41:14] chop off all the excess flesh
[1:41:17] and behaviors and
[1:41:19] worldliness and this and that's just
[1:41:21] chop it off he said you will not be
[1:41:23] judged because you're already judged by
[1:41:24] this the same word that's going to judge
[1:41:26] them there judges you here now
[1:41:30] so if you allow me to judge you here now
[1:41:32] you won't come into judgment
[1:41:34] you will not come into judgment but you
[1:41:37] have passed from death on to life
[1:41:41] hallelujah you already
[1:41:44] been translated in heavenly places
[1:41:47] praise god listen to brother branham
[1:41:49] here
[1:41:50] remember what i'm saying
[1:41:52] you have already been translated into
[1:41:56] heavenly places with christ jesus that
[1:41:58] is your soul we're talking about here
[1:42:01] right
[1:42:03] not that you will be translated
[1:42:07] but when
[1:42:08] you believe
[1:42:10] you receive
[1:42:12] what god has sent here
[1:42:15] you are now right now he says repeating
[1:42:18] again right now
[1:42:20] translated
[1:42:22] and in the presence
[1:42:24] of the living god
[1:42:26] may god bless you this sermon is not

[1:42:31] but it's ended for today
[1:42:34] and i trust that these little
[1:42:37] uh gobbled up words brought together to
[1:42:39] you and i say that because it's not a
[1:42:41] typical
[1:42:42] well-streamed
[1:42:45] sermon put together with all the
[1:42:47] hermeneutics and homoletics and so on
[1:42:50] but it's just what god has laid upon my
[1:42:53] heart to say to you for his grace and
[1:42:57] for his glory may the lord bless every
[1:42:59] one of you here today
