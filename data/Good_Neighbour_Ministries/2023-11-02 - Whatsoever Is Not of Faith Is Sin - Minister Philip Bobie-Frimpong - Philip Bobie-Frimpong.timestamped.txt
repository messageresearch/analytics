[23:47] you take me aside and close my mouth

[23:51] to say Lord may your spirit come and
[23:53] take control take preeminence and bless
[23:56] your children we invite the great Holy
[23:59] Ghost father God without you our meeting
[24:01] will be in vain Lord one word from you
[24:04] father will sett us so come and speak to
[24:06] your children's heart in Jesus name amen
[24:10] amen let's read our Bible here I have
[24:14] three scriptures maybe four of them
[24:16] today is
[24:20] um Bible
[24:23] studies our first scripture is Romans
[24:26] it's all in Romans then the last one
[24:29] I'll read it later on Romans Chapter
[24:33] 14 verse 23 and my title is anything
[24:37] done without faith is
[24:39] sin Romans
[24:44] 14:23 and then Romans
[24:46] 15:16 and Romans
[24:56] 8:11
[25:01] if you got to say amen amen okay
[25:05] Romans
[25:08] 1423 and he that douth is damned if he
[25:16] eat because he eateth not of Fai for
[25:20] whatsoever is not of faith it sin that's
[25:24] my title uh Romans 156
[25:29] that ye may with one
[25:32] mind and one
[25:35] mouth glorify God even the father of our
[25:39] Lord Jesus christall and Romans
[25:42] 8:11 but if the same if the spirit of
[25:45] him that raised up Jesus from the dead
[25:48] dwell in you he that rais up Christ from
[25:51] the dead shall also Quicken your mortal
[25:54] bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in
[25:57] you
[25:58] you please Jesus bless the reading of
[26:00] your word amen please be
[26:08] seated okay we all know that faith is a
[26:11] substance of things not
[26:13] seen evidence of Things Not Seen it's a
[26:17] substance so um we contact our five
[26:22] senses by see taste smell and hearing
[26:28] but there's another
[26:30] sense braam call Super sense the six
[26:32] sense that is Faith it doesn't go by the
[26:35] things that you physically see it goes
[26:38] by the word of God the promise of God it
[26:40] might be contrary to what you physically
[26:44] can see but if you have God has revealed
[26:47] to you that thing is yours nothing can
[26:50] take it away from you for faith is a
[26:54] revelation and nobody can give himself a
[26:57] revelation
[26:58] a revelation is a gift from God and
[27:01] without faith it's impossible to please
[27:04] God so those who just come to God might
[27:07] believe that he's those who came to God
[27:10] might believe that he's the one who
[27:11] deligently canot do it so without faith
[27:14] you can't please God by faith the others
[27:17] they gain a good report so anything that
[27:22] you do in this earth if you do not do it
[27:25] by faith it doesn't please God
[27:28] because you doing with your caner mind
[27:30] our pastor has told us in so many times
[27:33] that when you even
[27:35] um come to pay your offering or your
[27:38] thight you don't just put the money in
[27:41] the envelope and just come and put it in
[27:43] there because then you do it um it
[27:46] becomes like a routine it's a tradition
[27:50] it becomes tradition to be every time
[27:51] you just come you put the offering
[27:54] inside you place there but he said that
[27:55] you have to pray before you put that
[27:58] side before he put that offering inside
[28:00] and trust God that in Malachi 3 he said
[28:03] that bring this and I will let food now
[28:07] open Windows of Heaven to us to bless
[28:09] you so you putting in in and you praying
[28:13] and believing that God will honor his
[28:17] word because there's one thing that God
[28:19] cannot do he cannot fail he cannot lie
[28:22] you lie I lie but God never lie he said
[28:25] let every man's word be alive but mind
[28:27] be the truth so if God keep his word
[28:31] keep his promise then you don't put that
[28:34] thing and let become
[28:36] har har Sly they just put the money in
[28:40] sometimes our Christian work sometime
[28:42] become a tradition we just have to be to
[28:45] be at the church we just want to show
[28:47] our present but God don't want us to be
[28:49] in that way he want us to come prepare
[28:52] that heart come ready to receive from
[28:55] him because you get what you expect
[28:57] even tonight it all depends on what you
[29:00] expecting if you expect God to speak to
[29:02] your heart he will speak to your need if
[29:04] you expect just to come because remember
[29:07] you never going to live here the same
[29:10] way you came you either going to be more
[29:13] drawn to God or you not going to be
[29:15] drawn you not going going to be drawn to
[29:17] God so is your
[29:20] expectation what do you want God to do
[29:24] for you tonight whatever in your heart
[29:27] if thou can believe all things are
[29:30] possible to them that believe because
[29:34] God is more than able to answer your
[29:36] need but it's according to your faith
[29:39] it's according to what you expect
[29:43] remember I always say that that man that
[29:46] was like 70 years or 75 that did not bra
[29:50] said that he was Infidel he didn't
[29:52] believe in Jesus Christ but if you
[29:54] listen to the conversation he had with
[29:56] Abraham he he said that I was always
[29:59] wanted to speak to that man that was
[30:01] able to pray for those people with
[30:03] cancer God healed because in his heart
[30:07] he was expecting to meet that prophet of
[30:10] God so God supernaturally make a way for
[30:13] them to meet so whatever you expecting
[30:16] tonight you will get it according to
[30:19] your faith God is the same Jesus Christ
[30:22] the same yesterday today and forever so
[30:26] back to the title and offering when you
[30:28] put it expect it God want us to give us
[30:31] our all because remember that
[30:35] um that the Widow's might that Widow he
[30:39] gave she gave everything but God said
[30:42] that she had manone was very little but
[30:45] God said that she has given more than
[30:47] everybody why she gave from a heart she
[30:51] gave all that she had so God expect us
[30:54] to give everything that we have and
[30:57] sister hat right also did exact same
[31:00] thing and when she also put in $20 braam
[31:05] wanted to give that money back to her
[31:08] but God did not allow her did not allow
[31:11] him to give that money back to her and
[31:13] when the greatest thing that could ever
[31:16] happen on the face of Earth speaking
[31:18] things into existence it happened to her
[31:21] because why she gave her everything so
[31:25] what I'm trying to say tonight if if you
[31:28] have seen if I have seen that this
[31:32] gospel is thus said the Lord and if you
[31:36] know that there's nothing on this Earth
[31:38] that is greater than what we have then
[31:41] you have to support it with all our mind
[31:44] all our heart all our soul everything
[31:47] within it as you have to support this
[31:50] ministry we have to support the work of
[31:53] God because we know this is the truth
[31:55] there's nothing
[31:57] if it's not the truth then you be the
[32:00] most miserable person you have to just
[32:02] pack up and go but once we have God has
[32:05] revealed to us that this is the truth
[32:08] and nothing on the face of this is
[32:10] closer to this then you have to support
[32:12] it with everything within us God wants
[32:15] us to be a prisoner to his wor leave
[32:18] everything aside let's put God first
[32:22] amen say seek ye first the kingdom of
[32:24] God and his righteousness all all other
[32:27] things shall be added unto you so if the
[32:31] kingdom of God is was within you that
[32:34] kingdom is the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost
[32:37] is within you amen so you have to what
[32:41] give your everything I know it's not
[32:44] easy in this hour it's a demanding time
[32:51] your work wants more of every 10 of you
[32:54] it's a time of demanding your family
[32:57] want 100% of you God also need more of
[33:01] you so there have to be a balance but
[33:04] even though you balance your natural of
[33:06] your spiritual life you still have to
[33:09] decide in your heart have decided to
[33:12] follow Jesus no matter what comes maybe
[33:15] because the Lord that has brought us all
[33:18] this far he's able to us take us the end
[33:21] he will never leave us in the middle of
[33:23] the road he didn't bring us here to
[33:25] leave us he didn't bring us here to
[33:27] suffer he didn't bring us here to let
[33:29] all this go he is here to take us
[33:32] through if thou can believe all things
[33:36] are possible he's never going to leave
[33:39] you in the middle of the road it's not
[33:41] by power or by might but by my
[33:45] spirit amen say the Living
[33:50] God it has never
[33:52] been the prophet of God has never been
[33:56] the saints of God has never been anybody
[33:58] it always been God in the people it's
[34:01] God in Moses god in Samson God in all
[34:05] those people that did those Miracles and
[34:07] is the same yesterday today and forever
[34:11] so the same God that was in the prophet
[34:14] is also in you amen and he's doing exact
[34:17] same thing he did through them don't
[34:19] look down upon yourself because the
[34:22] scripture said they without us will not
[34:24] be made perfect so they all waiting on
[34:27] us we are the last one God reserve us
[34:31] the end so we have to have confidence in
[34:34] God and in ourselves that God is behind
[34:37] our skin it's God who is doing this it's
[34:40] not you it's not by your own
[34:41] righteousness by his but by his by his
[34:44] grace alone there's no one perfect here
[34:47] but there perfect one who is Jesus
[34:49] Christ he's in you make you perfect he
[34:51] makes us perfect not we ourselves the
[34:54] Perfection of perfection is in us he is
[34:57] the perfect one we all we all make
[34:59] mistakes none of us is perfect by in our
[35:01] flesh here but the soul within us is
[35:04] thatbut is from God that why nobody can
[35:06] touch is God himself and that perfect
[35:09] God is in you and is in me so that makes
[35:12] you perfect so don't look down upon
[35:14] yourself don't look at your mistakes God
[35:16] doesn't even remember any one of them he
[35:18] has put them in his SE or forgetfulness
[35:21] he's the same God he loves you he cares
[35:24] for you let's love him back let's love
[35:27] him by because it's the grace of
[35:31] God that has brought us all here and I
[35:34] believe that that same Grace will lead
[35:37] us home hallelujah it's Amazing Grace
[35:40] Grace Grace Grace it's not anyone of us
[35:43] has done God's grace and that Grace is
[35:46] going to lead us to our final
[35:48] destination and God hasn't changed
[35:50] hallelujah praise God what is happening
[35:54] is
[35:55] that a lot of
[35:58] people are doing things without faith
[36:02] without
[36:03] Revelation they doing it just because
[36:05] somebody have told them to do it somewh
[36:08] bra saying that if I told you not to
[36:10] wear pants and you just wear it you
[36:13] don't wear you just don't wear it it's
[36:14] not going to help you but something in
[36:16] your
[36:17] heart respond and confirm to it and you
[36:21] do it then you get a blessing then you
[36:23] have understanding why you are not
[36:27] wearing those pants I'm fed up with copy
[36:31] cats going on in the message people are
[36:34] just copying and doing things without
[36:36] Revelation by just doing things sometime
[36:39] one brother was telling me that there
[36:41] was a brother not in our church here
[36:44] there was a brother that witnessed to
[36:47] somebody after he witnessed the person
[36:49] the person came to be baptized and when
[36:52] he baptized the guy was still smoking so
[36:56] this man also bought a cigarette and
[36:59] give to the man to to smoke how can you
[37:02] impersonate like that because Abraham
[37:04] did that he's also doing that but in
[37:06] this situation the man smoke the all the
[37:08] pack because why he's impersonating just
[37:12] like s of ska he said that Paul I know
[37:16] Jesus I
[37:17] know the demon said Paul I know Jesus I
[37:20] know who are you so you cannot go by
[37:23] somebody's experience before you do
[37:26] anything
[37:27] if God revealed to that individual it's
[37:30] a different situation but just because
[37:32] braam bought a cigar for somebody that
[37:34] the person has baptized is smoking and
[37:36] you do that you are making a copy cat it
[37:39] will not work let's let God have his own
[37:42] way let God lead us as individual
[37:45] because God is not we are we are
[37:48] unique don't copy one another because
[37:53] before when you came a lot of people
[37:55] want to use their experience and impose
[37:57] it on us to go the same way God is
[38:00] dealing with them but God deals with
[38:02] Gentiles as individuals so just open
[38:05] your heart and let God speak to your
[38:07] heart let God lead you let God direct
[38:10] you because God speaks to his children
[38:13] no matter what you need if you open your
[38:15] heart and you are not biased to what you
[38:19] want and you go there with an open heart
[38:22] open mind God will make things plain to
[38:25] you he will talk to you he will speak to
[38:28] you any way that he's going to make that
[38:30] things clear to you he's going to make
[38:32] sure you hear it you understand it so go
[38:35] we don't want to be a
[38:37] copycat we want to do what God is
[38:40] leading us to do amen because he's the
[38:44] same yesterday today and
[38:47] forever so what am I trying to
[38:50] say when God deals with us with as
[38:53] individual never has he dealt with us as
[38:57] a group and even when it came time for
[39:02] him to speak to his 12 disciples he
[39:05] asked them the question who do you say
[39:08] the son of man I am as some say you are
[39:12] Elijah some say you are some of the
[39:14] prophets they all say whatever they want
[39:16] but he narrow it down and asked Peter
[39:20] what do you say this is who do you say
[39:23] this is and Peter said Thou Art the son
[39:26] of the Living God he said flesh and
[39:28] blood has not revealed this unto you but
[39:32] my Father in Heaven has done Upon This
[39:34] Rock upon this Revelation I'll build my
[39:37] church and the Gate of Hell shall not
[39:40] Prevail against it because this that's
[39:43] the God's standard for every age every
[39:46] generation is based on Revelation the PA
[39:50] of the word that God has thrown light on
[39:53] when that light lights up those seed of
[39:57] God those who were predestinated to see
[40:00] the truth in that age they will respond
[40:03] to it from Luther from Wesley all those
[40:07] ages when light thred on that light that
[40:10] word of God the seed of God God's
[40:13] children who are predestinated for
[40:16] eternal life that word will be revealed
[40:18] to them and they will live by it by
[40:21] Faith by Revelation and see the hands of
[40:25] God because this is not a a a group
[40:29] Affair it's an individual how God is
[40:32] dealing with us he deal with us
[40:34] individual that's why the prophet said
[40:37] the Bible said by faith Sarah also she
[40:39] has to have her own personal revelation
[40:42] amen so he said here in paragraph 234
[40:47] Christ The Mystery of God
[40:48] revealed look Christ in you makes him
[40:52] the center of life of the Revelation see
[40:57] Christ life in you makes him Center of
[41:00] Revelation Christ in the Bible makes the
[41:04] Bible complete revelation of Christ
[41:07] Christ in
[41:08] you Christ in you makes you the complete
[41:13] revelation of the whole thing see what
[41:17] God is trying to do what is the new
[41:20] birth then you say well brother Abraham
[41:24] what is the new birth it is the
[41:26] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[41:29] you amen you see not you join a church
[41:34] you shook a hand you done something
[41:36] different you said a Creed you promised
[41:38] to live by a code of RS but Christ the
[41:42] Bible he's the word that revealed to you
[41:44] and no matter what anybody says what
[41:48] takes place is Christ Pastor priest
[41:51] whatever it might be it's Christ in you
[41:53] that is the Revelation that the church
[41:56] was built upon so it's an
[42:00] individual how Christ has revealed
[42:04] himself to
[42:06] you it's how God has done it to you
[42:10] that's why the Pharisees the Sadducees
[42:14] the the rabbis at that time the priests
[42:17] and all those people they were singing
[42:20] The Very song of Psalm 22 Psalm 22 my
[42:24] God my God why H has Thou forsaken me
[42:26] all this they were in the in in the in
[42:31] the in in in those churches why in their
[42:34] Temple singing those psalms and at the
[42:37] same time the morning of crucifixion
[42:39] they were crucifying the very word that
[42:42] was that was they were manifesting that
[42:45] they didn't even know it because they
[42:47] didn't know what was what God was doing
[42:50] in their time so the scripture they were
[42:53] singing about it they were talking about
[42:55] it and and that scripture they were
[42:57] fulfilling in the wrong portion because
[43:00] they were singing my God my God why has
[43:02] thou forsaken me and they were do all
[43:05] those things that happened the morning
[43:06] of crucifixion and they were thinking
[43:09] they were talking but that thing was
[43:11] manifesting and they did not even know
[43:13] it that that's what is taking place
[43:16] because they were living in the past
[43:18] they were just talking about it and
[43:20] their eyes were blinded they couldn't
[43:23] see what was taking place in the present
[43:25] tense of their time so it's a present
[43:28] stage office Ministry you have to
[43:31] recognize what God is doing pres now
[43:35] thank
[43:36] you pres tells what he's doing the past
[43:39] will not do it because people a lot of
[43:42] people when it is written they can know
[43:45] it what is written what was said but
[43:48] when it's manifesting they can't see a
[43:51] clue of it it's a it's a it's a foreign
[43:54] to them they want I see it writing but
[43:57] by the time they recognize it that thing
[43:59] has gone that's why the Bible said the
[44:01] letter kill it but the spirit give life
[44:04] it's a spirit of God that throw light on
[44:07] the word and it quickens it and it give
[44:09] life amen so so many people are living
[44:14] in the
[44:16] past when the thing is
[44:19] written they can read a letter but when
[44:22] it is manifesting in their time they
[44:26] can't recognize it but the true bride of
[44:29] Christ those whose name were written in
[44:32] the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[44:34] foundation of the world those who have
[44:36] representation who has the who God has
[44:39] his thought on them when God they God
[44:42] think about them they were in God's
[44:44] thought they will recognize what God is
[44:47] doing every time in their time in their
[44:50] age they cannot miss it on they can't
[44:53] help it but they they will find it they
[44:56] will recognize it because the same God
[44:59] in them is part of them the the head
[45:01] Unite with the body so they can't they
[45:04] can't help it it's not something that
[45:06] bra said somewhere that some people they
[45:09] they want to get they understand they
[45:13] for they can't do nothing about it
[45:16] some whatever you do they cannot get it
[45:19] but others they don't do nothing but
[45:22] unconscious automatically they got it
[45:26] because why they are part of the of the
[45:30] of the main thing so they cannot
[45:32] differentiate it because they are part
[45:34] of God so how can they miss God said my
[45:37] sheep hear my voice a stranger they will
[45:42] not
[45:43] follow you call them by my
[45:46] name so God is the same yesterday today
[45:49] and forever amen so don't let us look
[45:52] too much to the
[45:54] back when the light is shown in the word
[45:58] catch it and move on with it amen
[46:01] because our God is awesome God
[46:04] hallelujah God hasn't changed he's the
[46:06] same yesterday today and forever
[46:10] hallelujah praise our god thank you
[46:13] Jesus amen
[46:15] so one other thing is I can't get
[46:20] away from
[46:23] um from where waiting on the promise of
[46:27] God it just keep on coming everywhere I
[46:31] try to get away from it it doesn't leave
[46:34] me can't leave I can't leave it um let's
[46:38] read James 1: 3
[46:54] to8
[47:02] in James chapter 3 verse
[47:04] one it said knowing
[47:08] this that the trying of your faith WTH
[47:15] patience but let
[47:17] patience have a perfect work that you
[47:22] may be perfect an
[47:24] entire world wanting
[47:27] nothing so patience work with what
[47:33] faith if you have faith you got the
[47:36] patience to wait for the thing to
[47:39] manifest you can't go ahead of it as you
[47:43] said the last time that Sarah went ahead
[47:47] and gave hegi to Abraham and those time
[47:52] polygamy was legal so Abraham hecken to
[47:56] what Sarah told him but somewhere back
[48:00] then that bit correction when
[48:03] ishmail the wild child when he came on
[48:06] the scene and
[48:08] bullying um bullying Isaac Sarah asked
[48:13] God Sarah told Abraham to send him away
[48:16] then Abraham asked God that do he has to
[48:20] that God said listen to what your wife
[48:23] is telling you so just a little bit
[48:25] correction because in that Ismael
[48:27] situation God
[48:29] told Abraham asked God before he did it
[48:35] but during the death during the marriage
[48:38] because polygamy was legal at that time
[48:41] Abraham just hacking to what um Sarah
[48:44] told him but the main thing that we
[48:46] trying to point over here is that Sarah
[48:49] did not have patience she couldn't wait
[48:53] and that brought Ishmael who is a wild
[48:56] child that has been a Thor in the flesh
[48:59] of the Israel Israel people but if you
[49:03] read in the scriptures that time her
[49:06] name was sah s a r a i but when the
[49:10] angel that MC went and revealed the
[49:15] heart of Sarah to her if you go back to
[49:18] Roman said that by faith Sarah also sah
[49:21] received her own faith to what to give
[49:25] birth to to Isaac it was a revelation
[49:28] that from that time going Sarah never
[49:31] missed it she had her own personal
[49:35] revelation amen before the child even
[49:38] that time if you check over there she
[49:40] was changed to be a young man because
[49:43] the Revelation that she received because
[49:46] of that it let it quickened her body for
[49:49] her to be chained to receive that
[49:51] promised son amen so that same God is
[49:55] here and if you read in the scriptures
[49:57] another person that have the patient was
[50:01] Elisha Elisha followed Elijah for so
[50:04] many years for more than 20 years we
[50:08] never read in a place that Elisha tried
[50:13] to um sabotage
[50:16] Elijah um program we never read in anywh
[50:21] that she tried to get away from El
[50:24] Elijah and have his own Ministry he wait
[50:28] upon the Lord he wait upon his ministry
[50:31] because he has the patient to wait when
[50:34] the time came he received a double
[50:37] portion of Elijah's spirit so it's
[50:41] important that we wait on our gifts it's
[50:44] important that we have patient and wait
[50:47] and let God have his own perfect way
[50:51] don't try to go ahead of your pastor
[50:53] don't try to sabotage don't try to uh
[50:57] push into your ministry if God has
[51:00] called you and he has something for you
[51:03] he will bring it to pass no matter what
[51:06] happened whatever God has inall for you
[51:10] will come to pass Elisha was not like ha
[51:15] who tried to what bypass the prophet to
[51:20] go and get money
[51:22] from um to get money from the Syrian
[51:26] leper he never did that he was
[51:30] faithful and God expect us to be
[51:33] faithful faithful to his servants
[51:36] faithful to his word
[51:38] respect when you respect it makes
[51:42] you get a place that you don't you fear
[51:45] to do something wrong to against God
[51:49] that you not going to please God so it
[51:50] makes you respect it brings you fear so
[51:53] the same thing if you respect God's
[51:56] servants you want to also fear so that
[51:59] you don't want to do something to what
[52:01] against them that's the way the
[52:02] scripture said
[52:04] respect and if you respect he said that
[52:07] if you give the prophets reward if you
[52:10] respect the prophet you get the prophet
[52:13] reward if you disrespect you get the
[52:16] other part of it too because
[52:19] elishah when those children they
[52:22] suspected him what happened that and you
[52:25] call on and 4 of them were killed on
[52:28] that same very day because of disrespect
[52:31] of the office so let's have in our heart
[52:36] to respect the office that God has given
[52:40] to us when you respect God will bless
[52:43] you when you respect God in his own time
[52:46] he'll give you your blessing so it is
[52:51] God of Elijah God has sent us a prophet
[52:54] Malachi 4 4 56 has been fulfilled
[52:58] Revelation 10:7 Amos 3:7 all those
[53:01] scriptures we respect the prophet that
[53:04] God has sent us we love him and respect
[53:07] him amen and because we love and respect
[53:09] him God will give us has also G us the
[53:12] word reward of the Prophet
[53:14] respect and in Malachi 4:5 said that
[53:18] I'll send you the Elijah the prophet you
[53:20] turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[53:22] children and the hearts of the children
[53:23] to the fathers the Turning of the House
[53:26] of the children to the fathers and the
[53:28] turn of the children heart the fathers
[53:30] in our time it means that we are going
[53:32] to have the same faith that Apostles
[53:36] have the same Pentecostal Faith the same
[53:38] faith that the Peter and the rest have
[53:40] that is what we have now and what is
[53:43] happening is making us write another
[53:45] book of
[53:46] Acts because it's the M member body
[53:50] before it was Jesus Christ alone and
[53:53] when he died his his his Spirit came and
[53:56] divided and went to the all the apostles
[53:58] so it is our Prophet alone doing all
[54:01] those Mighty works and God took him from
[54:04] the scene and what happened the same
[54:07] spirit that was on the prophet the same
[54:09] way that Elisha cried where is the god
[54:11] of Elijah we serving we looking for the
[54:14] god of Elijah we not serving Elijah we
[54:18] serving Elijah God of Elijah that's who
[54:20] we are crying for the same God that was
[54:23] in the prophet the same God in us doing
[54:26] exact same thing he did through his
[54:28] ministry but it's scattered the bride is
[54:31] all over the world in Africa Australia
[54:33] in Asia all over the place remember we
[54:36] are not Canadians we not Americans we
[54:39] are not Africans we are Christians we
[54:41] are Sons and Daughters of the Living God
[54:44] and the same God in the Malachi 4:5 that
[54:48] same God is in us because we are the
[54:49] Fulfillment of that prophecy and we are
[54:53] manifesting it Hallelujah the people
[54:55] like the same God that was in him is
[54:58] also working through us because we have
[55:01] recognized our Prophet for our day and
[55:03] give him that Prophet respect and God is
[55:07] moving in our lives
[55:10] mightily when
[55:12] elishah was so respect to Elijah God
[55:16] gave him a double portion of his thing
[55:21] no wonder he said that the bride will
[55:23] have a short quick w
[55:26] many member body and that going to be
[55:29] tremendous it's on the way when you see
[55:32] things all shaping it's all those
[55:34] pressures bringing unity and they going
[55:36] to put everybody in their place and when
[55:40] that thing happen you
[55:42] watch how God will manifest and flow in
[55:46] a mighty way has never been before the
[55:48] world haven't seen nothing yet the CH of
[55:51] children the God's children are coming
[55:53] onward watching
[55:56] Onward Christian Soldiers we are
[55:59] Marching as to war that same God is in
[56:02] us he doing exact same thing he did back
[56:05] then he hasn't changed he's the same
[56:07] yesterday today and
[56:10] forever because he said that all that
[56:12] the father was he poured into Christ and
[56:16] all that Christ was he poured into the
[56:18] church and when he did that what
[56:20] happened the apostles they did exact
[56:23] same thing Jesus Christ did
[56:25] when the um Peter and John when God used
[56:31] them to heal that man at the at the
[56:34] beautiful gate the people recognize that
[56:37] first they were ignorant
[56:40] unlearned but they realize that they
[56:43] have been with Jesus so if the same
[56:47] spirit that was in crisis in you your
[56:51] actions your behavior will let people
[56:54] know that you have been with
[56:57] him you don't have to
[57:00] talk you don't have to prove
[57:03] anything God will vindicate you as he
[57:07] said in abble that God testify of his
[57:11] what of his gift of of of his
[57:15] um of his
[57:17] sacrifice because it was revealed to
[57:19] what Abel and God testified of his
[57:24] sacrifice the same God that testified of
[57:28] the Apostles gift of of the Apostles
[57:32] that same God will testify that he's in
[57:36] you you don't have to talk you don't
[57:38] have to do anything said by their fruits
[57:40] you shall know them he will live his
[57:43] life unconsciously through you it's not
[57:46] you going to make this or you can't
[57:48] force yourself do this do that no just
[57:51] relax and let God have his perfect way
[57:54] in your life because he is the one that
[57:57] going to do it you and I we can't do
[58:00] nothing without him without him we are
[58:02] nothing he is the center of our life he
[58:05] is everything and when he comes into you
[58:08] you are nobody you become somebody
[58:11] because somebody is in you doing exact
[58:14] same thing he did through the apostles
[58:17] because that Mighty God is in you he did
[58:20] it in the apostles he's doing it through
[58:22] us as D and
[58:25] elaborate it because sometime we look
[58:27] too
[58:28] far sometime we put things in our mind
[58:31] look too far but just come down and look
[58:34] into this little small Church what God
[58:37] has been doing through the lives of the
[58:39] people Lord if you could just have an
[58:42] eye you will see that the same God the
[58:46] same Pillar of Fire the same Mighty
[58:48] angel that same God that was in Moses
[58:52] that was in the prophet he stood the
[58:54] same in this little church but your eyes
[58:57] have to open you just have to sit down
[58:59] don't look too far because God is so
[59:03] simple sometimes that Simplicity might
[59:06] bypass you the way you expected when
[59:09] John the Baptist was to be born they
[59:11] were expecting it so high the mountains
[59:13] will this and that and that but it came
[59:16] so simple the people did not even
[59:18] recognize only
[59:20] few that accepted his message and he
[59:23] point them to the Christ and they
[59:25] believe it once he point them the Christ
[59:27] they never follow John the Baptist again
[59:29] they follow the word Christ the word and
[59:31] it's the same thing our age he has
[59:34] pointed to him he said I must decrease
[59:36] he must increase once he said that the
[59:40] Lamb of God that take away the sins of
[59:42] the world you follow that light you
[59:44] follow that word of God for your age he
[59:46] doesn't expect you to go back anymore he
[59:48] has said he said somewhere they said
[59:51] that Braham would the bride have
[59:52] Ministry say yes it is is going on now
[59:55] the 454 Ephesians 511 they do exit the

[1:01:07] lot of people the Rapture will be gone
[1:01:09] and they say oh why did this thing was
[1:01:10] supposed to this said has gone already
[1:01:13] and he did not know because why even
[1:01:15] John the Baptist and the disciples all
[1:01:17] of them they miss it they say why that
[1:01:19] the scripture said theas must first come
[1:01:21] he said theas Will Truly Come and what
[1:01:25] restore all things that was the the
[1:01:28] first restore later elas has come and is
[1:01:32] gone already Rec was John the Baptist
[1:01:34] that was in two fold one was the Malachi
[1:01:36] 4 and one was John the Baptist so John
[1:01:40] the Baptist ministry came and finished
[1:01:43] it and the people did not even recognize
[1:01:46] that and scripture is repeating itself
[1:01:51] the denomination World some of them are
[1:01:53] expecting Mala 45 to fulfilled but that
[1:01:57] has gone fulfilled way back and they Liv
[1:02:01] in the P that is gone now is a rapturing
[1:02:05] Time amen it's a bride to go home to be
