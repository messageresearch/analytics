[38:44] was coming in to brother corey i said
[38:48] brother corey you know the believer may
[38:50] stand on a rock they may slip and slide
[38:53] on the slime that's on the rock but
[38:55] they're still on the rock
[38:57] so we thank god for a steadfast faith
[39:01] in the word of god for this day and for
[39:04] this hour
[39:06] we will not
[39:08] shrink
[39:09] we will not be ashamed
[39:11] in any way fashion or form we won't
[39:14] swerve any way but we'll stand firmly
[39:18] until the crown in heaven regain we
[39:21] thank god that we have these promises
[39:24] in the word of god welcome brother tom
[39:27] welcome to see sharon praise the lord
[39:29] i'd like to ask him to come give us
[39:31] testimony praise the lord just whatever
[39:34] lord lays in your heart
[39:36] huh
[39:37] that's okay fine okay don't want to put
[39:40] anyone in a spot if god give him
[39:42] something then he'll say it but this is
[39:44] the way it is um i'll tell you the
[39:46] honest truth that's
[39:48] that's the way it was some if the
[39:51] preacher had nothing to preach that
[39:52] sunday he'd not be ashamed he just come
[39:55] and say well brethren i i i don't feel
[39:58] inspired i don't have anything to say uh
[40:01] this sunday is there someone here that
[40:04] the holy spirit anoints
[40:07] maybe a strange brother will step
[40:08] through the door
[40:10] and
[40:11] come and bring the word right or god may
[40:14] drop on a believer that you
[40:17] didn't suspect or expect right so so
[40:20] look we're coming all back to these
[40:22] things
[40:24] because we're going back to the original
[40:27] he preached what paul preached
[40:29] and in the atmosphere in which paul
[40:31] preached it
[40:33] and so that's why i i'm saying to you we
[40:36] don't really have to do anything
[40:40] we are like ruth now
[40:42] waiting
[40:43] for the boss to break out among us
[40:47] that's that's what we're doing we're
[40:49] keeping faithful to the world and we're
[40:52] waiting for the hour
[40:54] we come through the years of recognizing
[40:57] we come through the years of hearing
[41:00] first
[41:02] recognizing all of a sudden we start to
[41:04] recognize what we were hearing and now
[41:07] is the hour when the holy spirit is
[41:09] going to move on the believers to act on
[41:12] the word
[41:14] and that's the reason why the last
[41:16] message was a lot of believers of this
[41:19] message are acting prematurely trying to
[41:22] bring another pentecost by their own
[41:24] efforts which is good it's it's it's
[41:27] human that we feel that way but that is
[41:30] not what it is
[41:32] what it is is he himself coming
[41:35] back and moving on the believers
[41:39] hallelujah and breaking forth amongst
[41:41] them to fulfill his own word
[41:45] and we thank god and praise him in this
[41:47] hour that we are living in the midst of
[41:50] something that's going on
[41:52] something supernatural it's not natural
[41:55] it's not even human it's a it's a glory
[41:58] and presence of almighty god strengthen
[42:01] our souls with the glory divine thank
[42:04] god hallelujah i'm glad i'm in the midst
[42:07] of this and i'm one of them
[42:10] i'm glad i'm one of them i don't know
[42:13] boy but sister brother but something
[42:16] striking my soul
[42:18] when i open this word when i talk about
[42:21] the word something real gets a hold of
[42:25] me
[42:26] not something man made hallelujah look
[42:29] we have an internet
[42:32] uh service going on right now
[42:35] they are uploading it while i'm speaking
[42:38] but we are not here to make just an
[42:41] internet presentation
[42:43] we have no church program
[42:46] we are not trying to present something
[42:49] to you to make you join our church or to
[42:52] join us
[42:53] we are bringing this world that you may
[42:56] have the unfailing reality of
[42:59] recognizing jesus christ
[43:02] in the ever-present hour in which we are
[43:05] in
[43:06] and it's reals more real than what you
[43:09] see with your eyes which will pass away

[44:08] to lead me from despair

[44:31] walking in the darkness
[44:34] with faith to guide my way
[44:38] the sun is shining
[44:41] on me today
[44:44] i found the answer
[44:47] i learned to pray
[44:49] [Music]
[44:51] forgive me if i try to sing at the same
[44:53] time try to cry but i thank god for the
[44:56] holy spirit of the living god
[44:59] that but we have found the answer

[46:59] and let them be for signs and for
[47:03] seasons and for days and years
[47:07] and let them be for lights
[47:09] in the firmament of the heaven to give
[47:12] light upon the earth and it was so
[47:17] and the god made two great lights the
[47:20] greater light to rule the day the lesser
[47:23] light to rule the night
[47:25] and he made the stars also
[47:28] and god set them in the firmament of the
[47:31] heaven to give light upon the earth
[47:34] and to rule over the day and over the
[47:37] night and to divide
[47:40] the light from the darkness

[47:51] day praise god bright time
[47:54] oh praise his name now
[47:57] romans 8 11 says to us

[48:13] shall also quicken
[48:16] your mortal bodies

[48:24] we thank god for the great precious word
[48:27] of god hallelujah amen god bless you
[48:31] just please be seated
[48:41] hallelujah
[48:44] now
[48:46] i'm speaking here today on
[48:50] the sun is shining on the seeds today
[48:57] now
[48:58] quoting the prophet of god
[49:02] now
[49:03] at the rising of the sun
[49:06] when the world lay in utter darkness
[49:10] that was back then but we know about now
[49:13] when the entire earth lies in spiritual
[49:16] darkness
[49:17] and the people know not god that there's
[49:20] even one god
[49:22] they've been blinded by every form every
[49:25] tradition that they've placed on the
[49:27] earth here because remember satan start
[49:30] with his lies his rumors and his
[49:32] propaganda machine
[49:34] uh through spreading it out through all
[49:37] his lying angels
[49:40] to blacken as the prophet said in taking
[49:43] sides with jesus to blacken the name of
[49:45] jesus darken the name of god
[49:48] and to diminish it from the minds of the
[49:52] people and to establish his lies as the
[49:55] truth
[49:56] but notice here
[49:58] see now it the world was without form it
[50:02] was void
[50:03] it was all covered with water and was
[50:06] laying there dark
[50:09] dismal
[50:11] gloomy
[50:12] see
[50:13] oh my
[50:15] but then the spirit of god moved upon
[50:18] that see
[50:19] oh
[50:20] and
[50:21] then said let there be light
[50:26] amen
[50:27] hallelujah now god had a reason to do
[50:30] that for that light to come
[50:33] for down beneath that water there
[50:38] there were seeds
[50:41] them seeds were already planted
[50:46] but they were waiting they had to have
[50:49] that sunlight
[50:51] to come to life
[50:53] lord of god you
[50:55] i've just go quickly remember how dr
[50:58] pember uh uh spoke of the fact that
[51:02] there was some chaotic
[51:05] uh events took place because when satan
[51:09] was cast down
[51:11] after he come and started civilization
[51:14] there and all the filth and evil from
[51:16] that god just destroyed the whole thing
[51:20] and the bible begins
[51:22] how the world was without form and void
[51:27] but in the beginning it was not so
[51:30] god had a perfect earth in that first
[51:33] verse but after that the in between
[51:35] there came that time of evil sin and
[51:39] corruption and god put an end to it
[51:42] and we ended up with an earth that was
[51:45] oak form and void but there were trees
[51:48] and seeds already and when that
[51:52] destruction came they just got buried in
[51:55] the dirt buried under the earth covered
[51:57] with water covered with every form of
[52:00] junk just like you and i covered up with
[52:02] all kinds of stuff from in the world
[52:05] covered up by sin covered up by evil
[52:08] filth mud everything else but then god
[52:12] spoke let there be light hallelujah
[52:15] [Applause]
[52:16] and the light came shining
[52:18] thank god it's shining on me today
[52:22] because i found the answer
[52:24] i've learned to pray upon the answer in
[52:27] jesus christ hallelujah amen amen praise
[52:31] god hallelujah yes sir so we find out
[52:36] that them seeds were he had them seeds
[52:39] that were already planted
[52:42] but they had to have that sunlight to
[52:45] make them live oh praise god you've got
[52:49] to have sunlight you've got to have the
[52:51] light of the son of god shining upon you
[52:54] for you to live again
[52:56] i don't care how many layers of dirt
[53:00] how many layers of evil mud is around
[53:04] you how much you're covered up by
[53:06] satan's lies and junk tell the woman oh
[53:11] you're a witch but it took a prophet to
[53:13] come and stand before says you were no
[53:16] rich
[53:17] thus saith the lord
[53:19] oh praise god you're a daughter of god
[53:22] hallelujah it's the same spirit spoke
[53:25] through the prophet with the spoken word
[53:28] the original seed telling you and i you
[53:32] are not what the world says you are
[53:34] you are not who the your mother and your
[53:36] father tells you you are you are not
[53:39] whom your school teacher tells you that
[53:41] you are you're not who society tells you
[53:44] you are you are who i tell you that you
[53:48] are
[53:52] amen
[53:53] and you're gonna be what i already said
[53:56] you're going to be
[53:58] because everything you're going to be is
[54:00] already in you
[54:02] hallelujah
[54:04] praise god
[54:06] and i'm going to use the revelation the
[54:09] light of the word of god to strike that
[54:12] and bring it to life again
[54:15] to produce after its kind
[54:17] that it might bring forth what i have
[54:20] ordained oh praise god forevermore
[54:22] hallelujah or do you believe that
[54:26] oh my praise god amen now remember
[54:32] that first light was that was ever given
[54:35] on the earth
[54:36] was really god's spoken word for god
[54:41] said
[54:42] let there be light
[54:44] hallelujah so the first light
[54:48] the original light is god's spoken word
[54:52] never mind man messing with electricity
[54:54] messing with this kind of new power and
[54:57] everything else like that it's good
[54:59] that's for the human realm and they want
[55:01] to use that but the real original life
[55:04] is god spoken word
[55:07] amen hallelujah praise god see god's
[55:11] spoken word said let there be light and
[55:14] there was light
[55:15] and it turned darkness into light
[55:19] hallelujah
[55:20] in order to bring forth a creation of
[55:23] joy upon the earth the spirit of god
[55:26] moved over that with love and compassion
[55:30] at that day at the dawn of that creation
[55:33] upon the earth oh my the sun rose and
[55:37] swept its rays and dried up the waters
[55:40] and made an atmosphere for the first
[55:43] time and it was the purpose of that was
[55:46] to bring joy and life to the earth by a

[1:01:07] the world you believe that praise god
[1:01:11] you believe that a part of god is in us
[1:01:14] you believe the significance of those
[1:01:16] tongues of fire over the apostles was
[1:01:18] god trying to show that the mortalized
[1:01:21] could see recognize and understand what
[1:01:24] he was doing that he was
[1:01:27] breaking himself up as the pillar of
[1:01:29] fire and putting pieces of himself in
[1:01:31] these little ones hallelujah signifying
[1:01:34] that he was in them now and that they

[1:02:50] were already rotten seeds
[1:02:53] amen the waters and things
[1:02:57] burnt them up
[1:02:58] this takes me to another quotation when
[1:03:00] he says you see
[1:03:02] it's not the seed of god what happens is
[1:03:05] that that water instead of making that
[1:03:07] seed grow mature and so on it starts to
[1:03:10] rot
[1:03:11] it says right there by the water the
[1:03:14] very waters that's supposed to give it
[1:03:16] life stats are rotten right inside of
[1:03:19] this message
[1:03:20] that's supposed to quicken and bring
[1:03:22] them to life hallelujah the waters of it
[1:03:26] rottens them and they become dead seeds
[1:03:29] rotten by what they can't comprehend or
[1:03:33] understand see oh my but my
[1:03:37] no
[1:03:38] rotten seeds waters and things burnt
[1:03:40] them out but you know
[1:03:42] there was a seed laying there that was
[1:03:45] ready for life and god no
[1:03:49] it was laying there
[1:03:52] and them predestinated ones
[1:03:55] are are the first to be quickened by the
[1:03:59] holy spirit
[1:04:01] for the holy spirit came back to claim
[1:04:04] his own
[1:04:06] praise god he didn't come to claim
[1:04:10] some other person or whatsoever he knew
[1:04:13] his children like that all that all
[1:04:15] eagle flying over the barnyard she
[1:04:18] already knew her own
[1:04:20] all she wanted to do was pass over that
[1:04:23] barnyard and let all the screams so that
[1:04:26] they would recognize the voice that was
[1:04:28] calling to them hallelujah oh my i'm so
[1:04:32] glad i recognized that voice
[1:04:35] i'm glad you recognized that voice
[1:04:38] there's a voice calling me right off
[1:04:40] that old rugged tree i hear the call i
[1:04:44] feel the pull oh praise god and it's
[1:04:46] taken me right into glory amen
[1:04:50] hallelujah
[1:04:51] now this is
[1:04:53] deep now
[1:04:54] i hope you catch what i'm this good what
[1:04:58] oh my not all men
[1:05:01] who
[1:05:02] you see
[1:05:03] the sun was sent across the earth
[1:05:06] listen
[1:05:08] not to bring rocks to life
[1:05:12] not to bring
[1:05:14] the dark to life
[1:05:17] it was not to do that but was to bring
[1:05:20] the part of the dirt enclosed around a
[1:05:26] life
[1:05:27] the dirt enclosed around a seed
[1:05:31] amen
[1:05:32] a jersey germ an attribute not all men
[1:05:37] then will receive christ
[1:05:39] oh what a statement i thought the bible
[1:05:42] says whosoever will may come i taught
[1:05:45] whoever wants to just run up to the
[1:05:46] altar
[1:05:48] like that but you see
[1:05:50] what we did not understand
[1:05:52] is that god already knew he's elected
[1:05:56] and like a fisherman all kinds of fish
[1:05:59] will come in your net but it's only the
[1:06:01] ones you select or elect are the ones
[1:06:05] that you're gonna use all the rest have
[1:06:07] to go out
[1:06:09] and according to the pattern it's not
[1:06:11] that all are crabs and snakes and
[1:06:13] spiders not all are bad he said the good
[1:06:16] ones is the same pattern
[1:06:19] like this other one that's to make the
[1:06:21] dress
[1:06:22] but this is what i choose to make the
[1:06:24] dress
[1:06:25] it's just that this one is not within
[1:06:28] the confines of the pattern so we got to
[1:06:31] praise god that it shows us that we are
[1:06:34] one in a million
[1:06:36] oh my praise god forevermore that you
[1:06:40] were brought in by his grace
[1:06:43] [Applause]
[1:06:45] it's not that he loved you more than he
[1:06:46] loved the other person
[1:06:48] like god like the prophet of god said
[1:06:50] it's not that abraham was any better
[1:06:52] than any of those babylonians that were
[1:06:54] back there but god in his poor knowledge
[1:06:57] already elected and selected him
[1:07:01] unconditional covenant no conditions on
[1:07:04] it no works on it oh
[1:07:07] i got to get these virtues i i got to i
[1:07:10] got to try and
[1:07:11] live holy
[1:07:13] i i have got to develop this i got to
[1:07:16] develop that i got to develop that but
[1:07:19] when we see how it's unveiled to us that
[1:07:24] every potential that you need and will
[1:07:28] manifest through you
[1:07:29] god already had placed it in the sea
[1:07:34] and now we are here to work out our
[1:07:36] salvation
[1:07:38] with fear and trembling
[1:07:40] let go and let god have this wonderful
[1:07:44] way
[1:07:45] let him manifest himself let him bring
[1:07:48] his word to life
[1:07:51] amen oh my so the son was sent across
[1:07:54] the earth not to bring rocks which was
[1:07:58] also dirt to life
[1:08:01] see
[1:08:02] but to bring
[1:08:03] that dirt which was enclosed around the
[1:08:06] life
[1:08:07] not all men will receive christ but
[1:08:10] those which god had for ordained to life
[1:08:16] and that
[1:08:18] maybe house the wrong some of the dirt
[1:08:22] of the earth see
[1:08:24] oh my
[1:08:25] that's the one he comes to quicken i
[1:08:28] mean they're the ones he comes to
[1:08:32] quicken

[1:08:54] this kind of preaching i can't
[1:08:55] understand

[1:09:04] old sun is so hot he's preaching all the
[1:09:07] way from beyond before genesis before
[1:09:10] the foundation he's preaching about what
[1:09:13] happened after the foundations and he's
[1:09:15] preaching now of what's going to happen
[1:09:18] all the way up into eternity this is too
[1:09:21] hot for me i can't take this at all that
[1:09:24] old rock will say the sun is so hot but
[1:09:27] the little seed when the sun strikes it

[1:10:11] that part of the earth amen oh praise
[1:10:15] god because the sun was sent not to
[1:10:18] quicken their rocks not to quicken their
[1:10:21] dirt but to quicken the life of the seed
[1:10:25] that was in the dirt amen praise god you
[1:10:28] just happen to be in the body that
[1:10:29] you're in

[1:10:45] way he made it we made this flower this
[1:10:47] color and they had one color he got a
[1:10:49] purpose we don't worry about such things

[1:10:53] barrier we're in the word of god the
[1:10:55] power of the holy spirit amen praise god
[1:10:59] hallelujah oh for the real message is to
[1:11:03] the believer

[1:11:39] him for it praise god forevermore amen
[1:11:43] you know it's wonderful when the sun
[1:11:46] comes up just a few things i scribble
[1:11:48] here what the sun does is drives away
[1:11:51] the darkness
[1:11:53] amen and all of us were in darkness
[1:11:56] and we know when the sun came up and
[1:11:58] started shining on us
[1:12:00] when this revelation broke
[1:12:03] maybe it broke only with a little peep
[1:12:05] of light
[1:12:06] you know wake up early in the morning
[1:12:08] and the sun comes up so nice and gentle
[1:12:11] but it's coming up it's coming up before
[1:12:13] middle of the day it gets real hot
[1:12:15] hey man and then you're gonna know if
[1:12:18] you're a real seed because the real heat
[1:12:20] of the sun is now beaten down on you
[1:12:23] hallelujah and then you're going to know
[1:12:25] if you're a real seed but i thank god it
[1:12:28] drives the darkness away from us
[1:12:30] hallelujah amen book of acts what was it
[1:12:34] doing it was driving the darkness away
[1:12:37] from them
[1:12:38] you remember i've preached on it
[1:12:41] road to ms
[1:12:43] how them apostles they were even
[1:12:45] following jesus
[1:12:47] already is that right you're done
[1:12:49] following the message
[1:12:51] and they were even saying if they
[1:12:52] believe
[1:12:54] and there wasn't there
[1:12:55] but the point is
[1:12:57] that uh here it is they're going back
[1:13:00] discouraged
[1:13:02] because
[1:13:03] their prophet is dead and um
[1:13:06] out of the bushes steps a man
[1:13:10] and this man begins to tell them things
[1:13:15] taken from the scripture from the
[1:13:17] beginning and bringing it right down
[1:13:19] and showing them christ
[1:13:21] revealed in his own word oh praise god
[1:13:24] so
[1:13:25] that we find out he was driving the
[1:13:27] darkness away from them
[1:13:30] hallelujah on uh paul hallelujah when
[1:13:33] they come up there and the light struck
[1:13:36] paul and he fall from his heart it was
[1:13:38] driving the jewish traditions of
[1:13:40] darkness out of him
[1:13:43] knocking away all the darkness which he
[1:13:45] thought was light
[1:13:47] he was driving it away from him that he
[1:13:50] could see the real light of god that was
[1:13:53] shining upon his heart hallelujah there
[1:13:56] was one called
[1:13:58] cornelius and he was a man's sincere
[1:14:02] seeking god praying and fasting and grow
[1:14:06] walking in the light of the word and god
[1:14:08] sent peter to him oh my and there god
[1:14:13] used his spoken word through the mouth
[1:14:16] of a preacher
[1:14:18] to drive away roman doctrinal darkness
[1:14:21] away from him
[1:14:23] and that god still is alive here today
[1:14:27] to drive away paige and darkness
[1:14:30] trinitarian darkness
[1:14:33] all kinds of false baptisms all kinds of
[1:14:36] false titles and false things away from
[1:14:40] the minds of the people and to rip the
[1:14:42] veil once again that they can see the
[1:14:45] living risen christ who lives
[1:14:47] forevermore amen praise god hallelujah
[1:14:51] i'm so thankful he's the same yesterday
[1:14:54] today and forever second thing that the
[1:14:57] what the sun does when it rises up it
[1:15:00] dramatizes whatever seeds are hidden
[1:15:02] beneath the dirt
[1:15:04] doesn't matter what concrete is on that
[1:15:06] that that wonderful seed it will break
[1:15:09] through everything and come to its
[1:15:12] fullness of its life because it was
[1:15:15] predestinated to bring forth after its
[1:15:19] kind
[1:15:20] hallelujah no one of the holy spirit
[1:15:23] asked me many years ago whose kind are
[1:15:25] you going to be go read genesis 11 every
[1:15:28] seed must bring forth after it's kind

[1:15:54] something has really caught you
[1:15:57] oh my he will not let you go because you
[1:16:02] have become a prisoner
[1:16:04] amen paul said look even my own heart
[1:16:08] want to condemn me and
[1:16:09] i want to do this i can't even do it
[1:16:11] anymore
[1:16:12] i'd want to do that i can't do what i
[1:16:15] like anymore there's something inside of
[1:16:17] me telling me that that's not right
[1:16:19] that's wrong this that that and then
[1:16:21] directing me and moving me in different
[1:16:24] directions what is that it's the power
[1:16:27] of the holy spirit within the si the
[1:16:29] child's heart amen oh praise god forgive
[1:16:33] me sometimes because i'm on the brink of
[1:16:34] speaking in tongues
[1:16:37] and i'm just asking the holy spirit just
[1:16:39] to hold me back
[1:16:41] praise god forevermore oh my praise god
[1:16:44] those floodwaters that cover the earth
[1:16:47] when they're receded with the sun drying
[1:16:50] them up
[1:16:51] then the seeds begin to be able to
[1:16:54] dermatize and begin to come to life amen
[1:16:59] praise god so i thank god for this real
[1:17:02] sunrise that we are having
[1:17:06] amen the sun is still rising
[1:17:09] it's it's rising it's still shining it's
[1:17:11] going higher and higher and higher
[1:17:13] and then all of a sudden we're going to
[1:17:16] leave here and go to a land where there
[1:17:18] is no night there
[1:17:20] oh thanks be to god hallelujah amen
[1:17:23] laying there all these years we were
[1:17:26] waiting for the sun to rise
[1:17:28] amen but god sent a prophet to say like
[1:17:32] the young man you know the young slave
[1:17:34] that the prophet said on emancipation
[1:17:36] day he climbed on the very highest point
[1:17:38] of the barn
[1:17:40] he didn't want to wait
[1:17:42] down at the bottom
[1:17:43] and the moment the sun came up and he
[1:17:46] could see it peeping he said we're free
[1:17:49] we're free hallelujah the sun is coming
[1:17:52] up we are free
[1:17:54] that's what the prophet did for us of
[1:17:57] brother that could climb a bit higher to
[1:17:59] tell us oh the sun is out it is the
[1:18:02] rising of the sun come out to your
[1:18:05] prison doors come out your sickness come
[1:18:07] out of your pain come over your trials
[1:18:10] come out of your tribulation come under
[1:18:12] your crippled nonsense that you're in
[1:18:14] come out of your false doctrines back to
[1:18:17] the lord the sun is shining upon the
[1:18:20] seeds of god here today may it shine
[1:18:23] upon you wherever you are
[1:18:26] across the world where you will hear
[1:18:29] this oh you say oh that's a nothing
[1:18:31] church that's a nobody that's fine it's
[1:18:33] not nothing to do with me
[1:18:35] it's nothing to do with me i'm not even
[1:18:37] trying to
[1:18:38] to gain more numbers and subscriptions
[1:18:41] i'm not
[1:18:42] uh interested in whether it goes up it
[1:18:44] goes down cross way sideways all i'm
[1:18:47] interested in and we are interested is
[1:18:50] to get this word of god
[1:18:52] out that the last one may come in
[1:18:56] i don't care where they're buried if
[1:18:58] they're in china in your africa wherever
[1:19:01] you are islands of the sea let the
[1:19:04] spirit of god call his children
[1:19:06] let the spirit pull his own
[1:19:09] back to the word
[1:19:11] back to the presence of almighty god
[1:19:14] hallelujah amen praise god remember
[1:19:20] when that sun began to shine on that
[1:19:22] seed
[1:19:23] that that the sun didn't give the seed
[1:19:27] life
[1:19:28] you got me
[1:19:30] the sun didn't come to now make the seed
[1:19:33] get born again
[1:19:35] the sun did not come to make that seed
[1:19:38] yet saved
[1:19:40] but god has already predestinated that
[1:19:44] seed
[1:19:45] with the power to transform itself
[1:19:48] within the seed when the sun struck the
[1:19:51] seed the sin comes to life amen
[1:19:54] manifesting the life amen praise god for
[1:19:58] the life was already in the seed
[1:20:01] was just waiting for the
[1:20:03] s-o-n light to shine upon it hallelujah
[1:20:08] it was just waiting to start to manifest
[1:20:12] first that it was a son or daughter of
[1:20:14] god
[1:20:16] it was there to grow and to walk into
[1:20:18] its own maturity
[1:20:21] hallelujah
[1:20:22] uh as i have always said
[1:20:25] we are not in a a faith that puts us on
[1:20:29] the spiritual regimentation
[1:20:33] is that right
[1:20:35] we are walking completely free
[1:20:38] because your freedom is not my freedom
[1:20:42] and the other person's free because god
[1:20:45] will let me do this someone let you
[1:20:48] might let that person do something that
[1:20:49] you just wouldn't let me
[1:20:52] uh you see so you that's why paul said
[1:20:54] don't judge yourselves among yourselves
[1:20:57] because there's no comparison god is a
[1:21:00] god is
[1:21:01] he's a greater genius
[1:21:04] than anything you could think of he did
[1:21:06] not make two things the same
[1:21:09] with all the billions and billions of
[1:21:11] things he made no two things are the
[1:21:15] same
[1:21:16] is that right
[1:21:18] oh no god every one he makes is a
[1:21:21] masterpiece
[1:21:23] hallelujah

[1:21:27] too tall you're a little too thin you
[1:21:29] got too much weight you you too short oh
[1:21:32] i'm a masterpiece i don't care what you

[1:24:56] they never knew it but if they break
[1:24:58] through things
[1:24:59] that we are seeing and begin to know and

[1:25:07] time you want to get a bounce from this
[1:25:09] i tell you brother sister it bumps you
[1:25:12] right into glory in the presence of god
[1:25:15] you know he says that woman that man
[1:25:17] that boy and girl will just probably
[1:25:20] lift up their hands and say let's go
[1:25:23] lord jesus let's go
[1:25:25] let's go lord let's go hallelujah amen
[1:25:29] how wonderful to know it praise god now
[1:25:32] i have a lot of things to say but not
[1:25:34] because i have to say i mean i'm going
[1:25:36] to say it all now
[1:25:38] i'll stop when the holy spirit feel lets
[1:25:41] me stop right that doesn't mean i'm
[1:25:44] going to go on until midnight or hours
[1:25:46] but i'll stop when i feel that i need to
[1:25:50] stop for the glory of god hallelujah now
[1:25:53] we're going to talk a little bit about
[1:25:55] moses here is that okay
[1:25:57] amen praise the name of the lord
[1:26:00] oh my how wonderful
[1:26:02] now remember
[1:26:05] in him there
[1:26:07] this is why christ speak
[1:26:09] in him there was the god of abraham
[1:26:14] in a light
[1:26:16] a pillar of fire back in a bush
[1:26:19] that fire had waves like going out from
[1:26:23] it
[1:26:23] but it did not seem to bother the bush
[1:26:27] the fire was in the bush
[1:26:29] but it didn't bother the bush
[1:26:31] oh my
[1:26:32] and
[1:26:34] the voice of the scripture
[1:26:37] the voice of god
[1:26:39] spoke through there
[1:26:42] and said
[1:26:43] i have chosen you amen praise god
[1:26:47] hallelujah oh my it's not wonderful
[1:26:50] what you heard is that
[1:26:53] this scripture has a voice
[1:26:57] is that right
[1:26:58] and actually it's gone through the cycle
[1:27:02] and the word has become flesh
[1:27:05] and this flesh that through this uh
[1:27:08] elected predestinated flesh
[1:27:11] the scripture can go back
[1:27:14] to having a voice
[1:27:16] having
[1:27:17] words coming through vessels that he
[1:27:20] predestinated for that purpose
[1:27:22] amen oh praise god
[1:27:25] now see
[1:27:26] then so it's that voice
[1:27:30] in the scripture that spoke to moses
[1:27:33] amen and said i have chosen you
[1:27:37] and i want to say to you i believe it's
[1:27:39] that same voice spoke to us
[1:27:42] hallelujah because we saw it lined up
[1:27:44] with the scripture but there was
[1:27:45] something calling us
[1:27:47] and we recognize that it's the voice of
[1:27:50] the scripture hallelujah amen praise god
[1:27:54] and the voice of the scriptures is none
[1:27:56] other than what we call the seven
[1:27:59] thunders
[1:28:01] for that's the voice of god
[1:28:03] that's the voice of the mighty angel
[1:28:06] when he shouted amen seven thunders out
[1:28:10] of their voices we know the seven voices
[1:28:13] of the seven spirits of god is one voice
[1:28:16] of the one living god when you put all
[1:28:18] the messengers and put their voices

[1:28:22] message of god it's the voice of god
[1:28:24] amen coming to us in this hour in this
[1:28:28] time hallelujah and that voice spoke to
[1:28:30] us and we realized that we we are not
[1:28:33] just creatures of time we didn't just
[1:28:36] come on the earth to sport and enjoy and
[1:28:38] to party and to drink and dance and to
[1:28:42] wear our shorts on the beach and to jive
[1:28:45] or or to wear our handgun pants with the
[1:28:48] crotch touching the road
[1:28:51] no no sorry we know something was
[1:28:55] different about us
[1:28:57] when the spirit takes you back down the
[1:28:59] halls of your memory you realize you

[1:29:30] quote here i have heard now i see
[1:29:33] and i just try to copy it
[1:29:36] here so that i can go directly from the
[1:29:38] page uh praise the lord listen brother
[1:29:41] branham
[1:29:42] he's saying about junior jackson just
[1:29:44] before he's talking about how junior
[1:29:46] jackson came to his meeting and was
[1:29:48] telling him about this dream and he
[1:29:50] talked about how that voice really has a
[1:29:52] gift that god uses with dreams so
[1:29:56] he's saying here that boy is a dreamer
[1:29:58] and i seen his dreams and i know that
[1:30:02] they are true see oh my
[1:30:05] and then
[1:30:07] he was saying to me on that last night
[1:30:10] of your meetings i was speaking and you
[1:30:13] were speaking and praying for the sick
[1:30:15] and then suddenly
[1:30:18] i said something's fixing to happen
[1:30:22] and when i said that
[1:30:24] it was like a clap of thunder
[1:30:27] oh my and some people began running
[1:30:32] oh my when this revelation really broke
[1:30:37] and breaks to the people that are around
[1:30:39] you that are evil in the message
[1:30:42] some of them gonna run away from you

[1:30:47] because they don't know what is this
[1:30:49] terrifying sound that they're hearing
[1:30:52] coming forth the people began screaming
[1:30:55] running
[1:30:56] and as the thunder
[1:30:58] but listen listen i want you to listen
[1:31:00] this close he said but now
[1:31:04] then that thunder
[1:31:07] see begin once that thunder
[1:31:10] begins to seem to go away
[1:31:15] then it began to make a voice
[1:31:20] see
[1:31:21] and it began speaking
[1:31:24] wow the seven thunders are speaking now
[1:31:26] they're not just making the sound and
[1:31:28] everybody can say oh the seven thunders
[1:31:30] oh the thunders oh the thunders oh yes

[1:31:37] hallelujah and that speaking was going
[1:31:40] on and on and it was coming true

[1:31:54] the hint over to you in solomon one when

[1:32:00] through the lattice work
[1:32:02] amen these thunders began speaking and
[1:32:05] they were hearing it coming through the
[1:32:08] letters work and it's coming to every
[1:32:10] individual as the word begin to make
[1:32:13] itself known hallelujah oh my and then

[1:32:20] like you see in the picture
[1:32:23] that is even now above the audience
[1:32:27] here
[1:32:29] but i said

[1:32:35] rumbling off somewhere
[1:32:38] and i stood still and said that is
[1:32:42] jehovah god
[1:32:44] the prophet is gone the thunders are
[1:32:46] still speaking that's why uh

[1:32:52] wish i could be here i i would have
[1:32:54] loved to be here but he can't be here
[1:32:56] but that doesn't mean the voice stops

[1:33:59] that i will use to go to fulfill that
[1:34:01] purpose but that is that day but in this
[1:34:04] day god has his chosen ones
[1:34:07] and his chosen ones is becoming for them
[1:34:10] to fulfill all righteousness or all the

[1:35:02] hallelujah and i couldn't find my way
[1:35:06] i tell you
[1:35:07] all the roots that i took
[1:35:09] and i took it you say oh this
[1:35:12] denomination that denomination i just
[1:35:14] let you know factually
[1:35:17] that i
[1:35:18] you know pilgrim holiness
[1:35:20] seventh day adventists
[1:35:22] oh my
[1:35:24] i i i'll be talking maybe in a month's
[1:35:27] time when he gets back to a gentleman
[1:35:30] that i went uh and met him was talking
[1:35:33] to him because he he can sew he can do
[1:35:37] things and um
[1:35:39] while we are there talking you know i
[1:35:41] suddenly get a feeling and so i turned
[1:35:44] him and said well um
[1:35:46] i perceive you're some sort of a
[1:35:49] christian
[1:35:50] he said yes i'm a believer i'm a
[1:35:52] christian
[1:35:53] he says
[1:35:55] but you know i'm not
[1:35:57] this
[1:35:58] pentecostal or anything i i
[1:36:01] am an adventist but
[1:36:03] i really don't know if i should even say
[1:36:05] that that i'm adventurous because i come
[1:36:08] out because i seen so different things
[1:36:12] go and i i just can't stand it i just
[1:36:15] come out
[1:36:16] and uh right now i'm wondering what to
[1:36:18] do and this and that and the other i
[1:36:21] said oh is that right right
[1:36:23] so we start chatting on a light form and
[1:36:26] of course you know the spirits pull on
[1:36:28] him he wants to know more and this and
[1:36:30] that so
[1:36:31] let's pray for francisco that the holy
[1:36:34] spirit will continue to deal with his
[1:36:36] heart and life for the glory of god god
[1:36:38] has a way of doing things
[1:36:41] and he calls his own
[1:36:43] the day and the hour is up when we just
[1:36:45] got to take a track and chuck into
[1:36:47] another person's nose
[1:36:50] yeah but you remember when brother brown
[1:36:52] sat in his car and the young man came in
[1:36:54] the track he says did god lead you and
[1:36:57] tell you to give
[1:36:59] me a track
[1:37:00] and he's saying yes sir and this and
[1:37:03] that brother branham didn't really
[1:37:04] answer him but he said see see that's
[1:37:07] what the denominations have been doing
[1:37:09] in other words that they're hoping to
[1:37:12] catch
[1:37:13] one seed that might entangle it
[1:37:17] that's what they were giving out all
[1:37:19] these things for
[1:37:21] because they're attracted by spiritual
[1:37:22] things and they
[1:37:24] they get so many in to get so many in
[1:37:26] but it's to get those seeds of god that
[1:37:29] would be in that group
[1:37:30] to get them all entangled into all kinds
[1:37:32] of doctrines and
[1:37:34] dogmas and everything else
[1:37:37] like that but our eyes have been opened
[1:37:39] amen but thank be to god the holy spirit
[1:37:42] is calling he's speaking and this thing
[1:37:45] is progressing
[1:37:46] and i'm telling you this is going to
[1:37:49] break out
[1:37:50] amen because uh uh i i one quote which
[1:37:53] i'll get to maybe next time where he
[1:37:55] says oh when i begin to see this i i
[1:37:59] feel like repentance i feel like i need
[1:38:02] a revival i need i need an awakening
[1:38:06] amen but what is it it's all the sun
[1:38:10] shining on that seed bringing it to life
[1:38:13] amen and then what happened
[1:38:16] that seed now
[1:38:18] you don't have to go out and prematurely
[1:38:22] try to
[1:38:23] make the world do what it says
[1:38:27] it will do what it says when he chooses
[1:38:31] for it to do what it says
[1:38:33] don't act prematurely to open the
[1:38:36] heavens and close down the heavens and
[1:38:38] and all these kinds of things the holy
[1:38:40] spirit will have his own will his own
[1:38:43] way and his own work and while root is
[1:38:46] waiting patiently in the field it'll
[1:38:49] break out amongst her like that
[1:38:51] say oh but our service
[1:38:53] we we don't have much life we don't have
[1:38:56] much
