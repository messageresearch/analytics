[0:00] [Music]
[0:14] praise the lord friends it's good to be
[0:17] here again
[0:18] i'm happy to be with you
[0:20] joining
[0:22] our hearts of our hands
[0:24] together in worship and in praise to our
[0:28] great and eternal
[0:30] father
[0:31] and god
[0:33] and may he bless us tonight
[0:36] as we look into the word of god
[0:39] as found in revelation
[0:42] chapter 3
[0:45] verse
[0:46] 17
[0:47] praise god
[0:49] and the scripture
[0:51] reads
[0:53] because
[0:55] thou seest i am rich and increased with
[0:59] goods
[1:01] and have need of nothing
[1:05] and noise not
[1:08] that thou art wretched
[1:10] miserable naked poor
[1:14] and blind
[1:16] and naked
[1:18] amen
[1:20] a great and eternal
[1:23] heavenly father
[1:27] we ask for your divine presence
[1:30] upon the word
[1:32] and with the word
[1:35] may you lord
[1:38] go forth and send forth thy truth
[1:42] into the hearts of

[2:07] and from their
[2:09] spiritual dream

[2:14] realization
[2:16] of the word of god
[2:18] we give you glory we give you honor we
[2:20] give you praise
[2:22] and we pray lord that the spirit of god
[2:26] will go forth now
[2:28] with truth and light
[2:30] in jesus name
[2:32] thank you lord thank you lord blessed be
[2:36] thy holy name
[2:38] amen praise god
[2:41] in our last talk
[2:45] we spoke about the dangers of
[2:47] self-diagnosis
[2:50] where many of us
[2:54] we we just think that
[2:56] we are capable we are competent we are
[2:59] knowledgeable enough
[3:01] and we can just diagnose our problems
[3:07] maybe in some minor senses yes
[3:10] but in most cases no
[3:12] and then we do believe
[3:15] that if we can't diagnosis
[3:18] diagnose our condition
[3:20] maybe we can depend on our neighbors
[3:23] our friends our family
[3:27] they will diagnose for us some
[3:30] person that thinks that they know
[3:34] about these things
[3:36] however
[3:37] we find in most cases
[3:41] without the competent uh diagnosis
[3:45] from a doctor
[3:47] in most cases
[3:49] we begin to wax worse
[3:53] and find ourselves in a more
[3:55] dangerous and difficult situation i want
[3:58] to thank god for doctors and the best
[4:02] of them
[4:03] and the worst of them regardless
[4:07] they if that but they tried to do their
[4:10] best
[4:11] amen and their human like anyone else
[4:15] and they can make mistakes like anyone
[4:18] else
[4:19] but all in all
[4:21] the the true intent of the profession i
[4:24] can't speak for the individual but for
[4:27] the profession
[4:28] is to do the best they can
[4:32] and to help the helpless
[4:34] the sick
[4:36] uh that are out there that they can uh
[4:40] receive some help
[4:42] hope
[4:43] and healing
[4:45] amen
[4:47] but
[4:48] in the scripture we read
[4:51] this is a case of
[4:54] of uh
[4:55] one
[4:56] taking on the responsibility upon
[4:58] themselves
[5:00] and
[5:01] they are saying
[5:04] i am rich
[5:07] i am increased with goods
[5:11] and uh
[5:12] they're giving a diagnosis of their
[5:15] condition of how great it is how healthy
[5:18] they are how wealthy they are how
[5:20] wonderful they are
[5:23] but that is from their point of view
[5:27] for under the discerning eyes of god the
[5:31] great physician
[5:33] who had traveled and walked the shores
[5:36] of of galilee and around the jordan and
[5:41] and judea
[5:42] ministering the word of god
[5:46] and healing the sick and the lame and
[5:49] the lost and lonely this great physician
[5:54] now casts his eye
[5:57] upon this
[5:59] uh
[6:00] patient
[6:02] and the patient
[6:04] happens to be not one standing in the
[6:08] line with brother branham
[6:11] facing the eyes
[6:13] of a prophet on the discernment
[6:16] but this
[6:17] is under the eyes of the god of the
[6:21] prophets
[6:23] jesus christ the great physician
[6:27] under the inspiration of hebrews 4 12
[6:32] how the word of god is sharp and the
[6:34] discernable
[6:36] with those eyes
[6:38] he looks upon the
[6:40] patient
[6:42] with the name of
[6:44] laodicea
[6:47] and when he looks
[6:48] upon the chart
[6:50] he sees their claims
[6:53] he sees what they're saying
[6:56] and then
[6:58] he says pick up your pen and
[7:00] write and he begins to give his
[7:05] diagnosis
[7:07] of what he sees
[7:10] in the age
[7:12] he begins to tell
[7:14] them what the
[7:17] problems are
[7:20] and his diagnosis is one
[7:24] he sees
[7:26] you
[7:28] uh
[7:28] have become a nest
[7:30] of
[7:32] six or so
[7:35] deadly diseases
[7:39] you're suffering from wretchedness
[7:43] i diagnose you
[7:45] with
[7:46] misery
[7:50] i'll diagnose you with
[7:52] spiritual poverty
[7:56] and i can see
[7:59] nakedness
[8:01] where does this desire come
[8:04] from that makes you
[8:06] cast off your garments
[8:09] tear off your clothing walk the streets
[8:13] that way
[8:15] what's wrong with you something is wrong
[8:19] and a great physician jesus christ
[8:23] is diagnosing this patient
[8:27] from his word
[8:30] and furthermore
[8:32] on top of that
[8:34] you're suffering from an incredible
[8:36] blindness
[8:39] where you cannot see
[8:42] and that leads on to
[8:45] spiritual amnesia
[8:48] which you're also
[8:50] suffering from
[8:53] you see
[8:55] what god saw was different
[8:58] from what they saw
[9:00] or from what laodicea sees about herself
[9:06] she sees that she is
[9:08] rich
[9:09] and increase with goods
[9:12] and spiritually wealthy
[9:14] she sees herself
[9:17] as as a church
[9:19] as a
[9:20] group that has arrived to
[9:24] spectacular
[9:25] success
[9:27] and have need of nothing
[9:30] amen but god saw her condition
[9:35] otherwise and sad
[9:38] you but you don't know
[9:40] you're wretched
[9:42] you're miserable
[9:45] you're poor
[9:47] you're naked
[9:49] and you're blind
[9:51] and worst of it all
[9:53] you're suffering from spiritual amnesia
[9:56] you don't even know it
[9:59] you're unaware of your
[10:02] uh dangerous
[10:05] condition
[10:06] that you're in
[10:09] oh my
[10:11] you see my friends
[10:13] what it is
[10:15] is that the age that eyes
[10:18] of this the people of this age
[10:21] of the gentiles
[10:23] have been blinded by the spirit of god
[10:28] who had blinded the jews
[10:33] so that the gentile age might come in
[10:38] and now
[10:40] as the age
[10:42] is changing again
[10:45] now the gentile
[10:47] church world
[10:50] is being blinded by the spirit of
[10:53] almighty god
[10:56] so that the jews
[10:58] may come back into power
[11:02] and into their position and place
[11:05] in god's great
[11:07] economy
[11:10] you see
[11:12] this little descent church age
[11:15] first of all as we have said wretched so
[11:19] wretched
[11:21] my friends
[11:23] there it is
[11:25] blinded
[11:26] in the hour
[11:27] that they are
[11:31] you see
[11:32] the lord placed the veil
[11:35] over the face
[11:36] of moses
[11:38] a symbol
[11:40] of a avail to be placed over the eyes
[11:44] of the jewish people
[11:47] who to this day
[11:49] cannot see or recognize
[11:53] that jesus christ
[11:55] is their
[11:57] savior is their jehovah is their messiah
[12:01] is the one eternal god
[12:04] and they're blinded to that fact to this
[12:06] hour
[12:08] but what has happened and is happening
[12:11] is that the jew the
[12:13] gentile church world
[12:16] is now blinded by veils of tradition
[12:21] veils of denomination
[12:24] veils of theology
[12:27] culture
[12:29] veiled by false doctrine
[12:32] and cannot see
[12:35] that the jesus christ is the one true
[12:39] god and not three but one god making
[12:43] himself manifested
[12:47] blinded to the knowledge of the truth
[12:50] diverted by the devil
[12:52] into every
[12:54] uh other aspect of the gospel
[12:58] and of the word of god
[13:01] how strange
[13:04] that we live in this age of plenty
[13:09] we're supposed to be living in this
[13:11] great age
[13:13] of progress
[13:16] a great age
[13:18] of
[13:18] abundance
[13:20] and how
[13:22] in the world
[13:24] can there be trials
[13:26] in the midst of such plenty
[13:29] in the midst of such abundance
[13:32] in the midst of such wealth
[13:34] ah so much of everything
[13:38] it certainly is strange
[13:41] because the age is so full
[13:44] with opportunity
[13:47] and everyone seems to have so much
[13:51] even to those who
[13:54] are said to be poor in our midst
[13:58] they are rich relatively to
[14:01] the real
[14:03] hard scrabbled poor
[14:06] in the poorest
[14:07] parts of the entire earth
[14:10] they would be considered wealthy
[14:14] oh
[14:15] there is still so much to be had in our
[14:18] society
[14:19] for those
[14:20] that claim
[14:22] to be
[14:23] very poor
[14:26] we have so many inventions
[14:30] that have been invented to help us with
[14:32] our work
[14:36] so many things
[14:38] have been
[14:40] made to help us receive pleasure
[14:44] out of
[14:45] our
[14:46] life
[14:49] but suddenly we begin to find that
[14:51] instead of people being very very happy
[14:56] they
[14:57] they seem to be having more
[15:00] but yet they are unhappy
[15:03] they're wealthy
[15:04] but yet they seem to be sad
[15:07] depressed
[15:09] miserable
[15:10] wretched naked and blind and they hardly
[15:16] will recognize it
[15:18] and even if they recognize it they will
[15:21] not admit to it
[15:23] for their arrogance and pride seems to
[15:26] have consumed them all together
[15:31] millions
[15:33] are taking sedatives
[15:36] pills to sleep
[15:38] to fall asleep at night
[15:42] and then
[15:44] they rise in the morning
[15:47] and they need to have
[15:49] pills with some pep
[15:51] or pet pills
[15:53] to be able to boost them
[15:55] so they can go out into this uh
[15:59] world and and jostle their way as they
[16:03] claim to the top
[16:05] of
[16:06] success rushing about in every possible
[16:10] way
[16:12] and then
[16:13] uh
[16:14] they find they're miserable they're
[16:16] unhappy
[16:18] and they don't know why because they
[16:19] have everything already but yet they are
[16:22] unhappy they're miserable they're
[16:24] wretched and so
[16:26] before you know it
[16:28] they're taking hallucigenic drugs
[16:33] drugs to make them uh feel happy
[16:37] for uh for a short while
[16:40] and then they're done in the drops
[16:44] they'll take some other drug
[16:48] to give them this high
[16:50] a feeling of a great high
[16:53] and before you know it
[16:55] they're back down in the low
[16:58] they feel like if they're in the
[17:00] mountains
[17:02] in a short while they're down in the
[17:05] valley
[17:06] but we thank god
[17:09] for what he gives the christian
[17:12] joy and speakable and full and full of
[17:14] glory
[17:16] trials make common trials may go
[17:20] but the christian is blessed by their
[17:22] trials
[17:23] but the trials only come to make them
[17:26] strong
[17:27] and to perfect them
[17:29] as they go into the presence of almighty
[17:31] god
[17:33] absolutely my friends
[17:35] and here we live in this age
[17:39] where the people are drowned in the sea
[17:42] of unknown fears
[17:45] they don't know what's coming up on them
[17:48] so they drink alcohol
[17:51] to be able to
[17:52] uh deaden their senses and get in their
[17:55] minds so they don't have to think about
[17:59] it
[18:01] while they're boasting of their worldly
[18:03] goods
[18:04] and the things they have
[18:07] and they're less happy
[18:09] than ever before
[18:11] boasting about their spiritual
[18:13] attainments
[18:16] and yet they're less sure of themselves
[18:21] their lies are filled with all manner of
[18:23] complexes
[18:26] and they don't know
[18:27] where to turn or what to do
[18:31] this age
[18:33] boasts of its moral
[18:35] values
[18:37] but while it's both
[18:39] of the
[18:40] moral values
[18:42] it's the most corrupt age that we're
[18:46] living in
[18:47] since the time of noah
[18:50] and the flood
[18:51] we see it repeating again
[18:55] they talk about their knowledge
[18:58] their boast about their great science
[19:02] but they're fighting a losing battle in
[19:05] every field that you can think of
[19:09] racing against time
[19:12] climate change
[19:14] racing against
[19:16] uh food shortages
[19:18] racing against warming up of the planet
[19:22] their
[19:23] racing against
[19:25] a
[19:26] population increase
[19:28] many diseases
[19:30] appearing on the scenes
[19:33] oh
[19:34] while they're boston one hand of their
[19:36] achievements they're losing on the other
[19:39] hand and will not be able to overcome
[19:43] these challenges whatsoever
[19:46] amen
[19:48] yes sir
[19:49] my their minds can't comprehend
[19:54] the rapidity of the assaults
[19:56] that are coming against them
[19:59] they cannot absorb
[20:01] the buffetings of time and of the devil
[20:05] upon them and the changes
[20:08] that are taking place upon this earth
[20:10] with such increasing rapidity
[20:13] they cannot take it all in and respond
[20:17] to it for it's too much
[20:19] we've gone from the horse buggy bicycle
[20:24] and we've gone into a rocket age
[20:28] a time of of great rocket science
[20:33] oh
[20:34] astronauts and cosmonauts
[20:37] breaking into the unknown realms of
[20:40] space
[20:41] oh friends what a dangerous difficult
[20:45] time
[20:46] that we are living in here together
[20:50] one generation has gone another is here
[20:54] now
[20:55] oh
[20:56] and we find the people so proud arrogant
[21:00] boastful
[21:01] and yet insane refined is a an emptiness
[21:07] and a spiritual darkness
[21:09] that has taken over the minds and hearts
[21:13] of men and indeed we live in this age
[21:17] filled with neurotics
[21:21] filled with neurotics
[21:24] because they're crying peace
[21:26] peace
[21:27] and while they're crying peace wars are
[21:30] breaking out everywhere
[21:32] peace we're going to bring peace we're
[21:34] going to bring peace and more wars are
[21:37] breaking out and they have no answers to
[21:40] those wars whatsoever
[21:43] they're living in for the bible already
[21:45] said there will cry peace there will cry
[21:48] peace but there is no peace said my god
[21:53] towards the wicked
[21:55] and again
[21:57] another one of these diseases
[22:01] is misery
[22:03] not only wretchedness
[22:06] is misery
[22:08] it's horribly enough to be called a
[22:10] wretch or to be a wretch
[22:13] but on top of being a wretch you're also
[22:17] miserable
[22:19] you're a miserable person
[22:22] a miserable age
[22:24] a miserable church
[22:26] a miserable so-called christian
[22:29] all god have mercy their objects to be
[22:34] pitied
[22:36] to have pity
[22:38] upon them
[22:39] but they don't want your pity
[22:42] they don't want your they they scorn
[22:44] your pity they'll mock at you for
[22:47] telling them about pity
[22:50] you're full of pride they don't want
[22:52] your pity whatsoever
[22:54] they just want to vote what they have
[22:58] show what they have display what they
[23:00] have i made it now i'm i'm i'm i don't
[23:03] need nothing now i'm okay i don't need
[23:06] you i don't need him i don't need her i
[23:09] don't need them i don't need
[23:11] the church i don't need god i don't need
[23:14] a bible uh uh all i need is my wealth
[23:18] and my self-satisfaction
[23:20] of myself and
[23:22] family and my church family i'm happy oh
[23:26] i'm happy oh yes
[23:28] that may go for a while but just for a
[23:31] short while and then darkness emptiness
[23:34] and misery begins to set in
[23:38] because inside is us
[23:40] a burning desire
[23:43] that will never be satisfied
[23:46] whatsoever it will not be satisfying the
[23:50] bible says my friends
[23:53] you build upon the quicksands
[23:56] of this human life
[23:58] rather than rather than upon the rock
[24:02] revelation of god's word
[24:05] certainly
[24:06] whatever you have built
[24:08] will fall
[24:10] soon comes earthquakes
[24:14] earthquakes on the earth
[24:16] earthquakes in our lives
[24:18] earthquakes within the church world
[24:21] and then will come the storms of the
[24:25] wrath of god's judgment
[24:28] striking the earth everywhere
[24:30] many years ago
[24:32] the great minister of the gospel one of
[24:35] the great angels of god
[24:38] billy graham preached the message
[24:41] world aflame i believe and wrought a
[24:44] book called our world of flame i believe
[24:48] our world is a flame right now and will
[24:51] be even more inflamed and aflame in the
[24:55] years to come but right now
[24:58] with the booms and the blasts and the
[25:01] explosions like children playing with
[25:04] fireworks god have mercy upon us the
[25:07] lives and of men and women consumed by
[25:11] fire and smoke
[25:13] but by by the hands of other man as the
[25:18] statement was made uh
[25:21] the inhumanity of man to man has now
[25:25] taken place and so we see the darkness
[25:30] of our age everywhere
[25:32] sudden distraction upon us
[25:36] sudden destruction
[25:39] despite all the carnal human
[25:42] preparations
[25:44] for eventuality
[25:46] sudden destruction comes
[25:49] and though you prepare
[25:51] yet you are still unprepared
[25:53] for the extent the enormity the rapidity
[25:57] of what is and about to take place upon
[26:01] the face
[26:02] of the earth
[26:03] yes
[26:05] objects of pity
[26:07] indeed
[26:08] pity all the people that are
[26:11] naturally poor and also spiritually poor
[26:16] right now
[26:17] because we see the ecumenical move
[26:20] taking place before our very eyes when
[26:24] we know that is of satan
[26:28] and pit uh i tell you it's a pitiful
[26:31] thing
[26:32] when you look upon wonderful religious
[26:35] honest
[26:37] good sweet
[26:39] nice people
[26:40] but that's not what this is all about
[26:43] they're all that
[26:45] and yet they fail to recognize
[26:49] that
[26:50] organization its beauty
[26:53] its order
[26:55] its system
[26:57] that's so attractive
[26:59] is nothing but the influence of the old
[27:02] serpent the snake the charming influence
[27:07] and beauty of organization
[27:09] that draws them in
[27:12] and they're blinded to what is out there
[27:16] pulling to them
[27:17] we pity
[27:18] those who boast
[27:21] of their big beautiful churches
[27:25] and their marvelous cathedrals
[27:28] and their
[27:30] they fail to recognize while they're
[27:32] doing that the curse of organization the

[28:13] their forms of worship beautiful forms
[28:17] of worship beautiful
[28:20] sounds beautiful music but we pity them
[28:25] we don't envy them
[28:27] amen but i tell you in the words of
[28:30] god's servant for this age this 20th
[28:33] century and i thank god that he's given
[28:37] us one
[28:38] major prophet and his name is william
[28:42] marion branham
[28:44] the true
[28:46] angel of god
[28:48] the prophet of god
[28:50] for the 20th century
[28:53] whether you accept it or you deny it it
[28:57] does not change the fact that he is
[29:01] god's
[29:02] pastor
[29:03] prophet
[29:05] teacher
[29:07] voice to this age hallelujah in the name
[29:12] of jesus christ that is the case
[29:14] my brother and there's only one like him
[29:18] there may be others
[29:20] others in the sense of other men of god
[29:25] wonderful man of god anointed man of god
[29:28] gifted men of god or praise god and
[29:31] attacked god for them brother sister but
[29:34] there's only one true god set prophet
[29:38] amen to every age and that one
[29:43] has spoken the word
[29:45] and says back to the old storefront
[29:48] buildings
[29:50] back to those dimly lit rooms
[29:55] oh
[29:56] i know of it
[29:58] i can remember them
[30:00] wonderful marvelous times singing and
[30:03] praising god
[30:05] now
[30:07] tambourines are hated
[30:10] guitars
[30:11] uh some of these musical instruments
[30:13] drums they're not needed we don't want
[30:17] those kinds of things anymore
[30:19] uh we want beautiful music oh
[30:23] but my friends
[30:24] we clapped our hands we rejoiced
[30:27] we praise god in some old garage or in
[30:32] some old dimly lit room some old store
[30:36] front
[30:37] or in some old legion hall or a broken
[30:41] down white building we give god all the
[30:45] praise and the glory from the bottom of
[30:47] our hearts and the power of god fell in
[30:50] the spirit of god moved in amazing ways
[30:55] where people were drawn into god's great
[30:59] presence amen hallelujah
[31:02] back to themselves
[31:05] back to those dimly lit places
[31:08] lesser the world and more of god is what
[31:12] we want amen we don't want to have to
[31:16] make
[31:17] great claims
[31:18] but we want the great god in our lives
[31:21] we want to don't want to just talk about
[31:24] the gifts in the church but we want to
[31:27] talk about the giver of the gifts and to
[31:31] praise him who has given himself as a
[31:35] gift for all all those who are of our
[31:39] present day
[31:41] objects of pity
[31:43] will soon be objects of the wrath of god
[31:47] that has already began to strike the
[31:49] earth
[31:50] oh it's coming
[31:52] it's coming
[31:53] it's moving
[31:55] the spirit of the lord is now taking
[31:59] control as he prepares the way for the
[32:02] departure of his bride hallelujah and
[32:06] that's why the bible further says
[32:10] you have another disease
[32:13] you're poor
[32:14] while you are yet claiming you're rich
[32:18] while the words are in your mouth
[32:23] while you're filled and you're saying i
[32:25] i'm filled i am hungry i'm filled while
[32:29] you're saying that you don't know you
[32:32] are hungry you are empty
[32:35] what you are eating
[32:37] is not going to satisfy you it will just
[32:40] be there for a moment and it's gone
[32:43] you see i'm rich
[32:45] but you don't realize you are
[32:48] spiritually poor
[32:50] and you're devoid of the presence of god
[32:53] amen and that is one of the chief signs
[32:57] as this age closes out
[33:00] upon us
[33:01] is that they we we
[33:03] we develop bigger churches
[33:07] we build better churches
[33:11] and
[33:12] we have the lust for more and more
[33:15] people and more people in there
[33:19] and
[33:20] we crave
[33:21] for more and more
[33:23] uh
[33:24] outlandish manifestations
[33:28] we have entered in
[33:30] to this
[33:31] pentecostal
[33:33] bl frenzy
[33:36] it's taken over the lives hearts and
[33:38] minds
[33:40] of the people
[33:42] where
[33:43] they're desiring something more and more
[33:46] and more
[33:47] and they can't help themselves like that
[33:51] wanting these so-called
[33:54] demonstrations
[33:56] of the holy spirit to see
[33:59] their altar filled
[34:01] with people
[34:03] and the
[34:04] gifts of the spirit
[34:06] in operation
[34:09] but they don't realize remarkable
[34:11] attendance
[34:13] is not
[34:14] the sign
[34:16] of the blessing
[34:17] of god and it's not the answer from god
[34:21] hallelujah because most of the people
[34:24] that comes to the altars there
[34:27] with them
[34:28] go right back
[34:30] crawl back
[34:32] my friends back to their vomit back to
[34:35] their filth back to their worldliness
[34:38] back to their smoking back to their
[34:40] drinking back to the all the old things
[34:43] it's just like a creature from the deep
[34:48] that crawled out for a while
[34:51] makes this claim
[34:52] and then it goes right back to where it
[34:56] came from they listened to the appeal
[35:00] came into god's gospel net but there
[35:04] were not rainbow trout to begin with
[35:08] there were not fish to begin with and
[35:11] turtle like they crawled themselves way
[35:15] back into their own
[35:17] muddy waters
[35:20] amen
[35:22] and they continue to talk about
[35:23] glossolalia
[35:26] speaking in towns
[35:28] they talk about the initial evidence
[35:32] of the holy ghost
[35:34] and claiming it to be
[35:37] speaking in tongues
[35:39] and
[35:41] thinking they are in the midst of a
[35:43] great revival
[35:46] and they're watching
[35:48] and expecting
[35:50] even a greater revival to follow
[35:54] but i tell you
[35:56] in the words of god's prophet
[35:59] america
[36:01] canada
[36:02] have lost their last chance
[36:05] since 1957
[36:09] amen and now towns is not the evidence
[36:14] of the
[36:17] infilling of the holy ghost
[36:20] but it is certainly the evidence
[36:23] of the handwriting on the wall
[36:26] many many
[36:28] take el you far sin
[36:30] you're weighing the balances
[36:33] and you're found wanting
[36:35] the hour of the wrath of god
[36:39] is ready the angel of death
[36:42] is ready
[36:43] going across the land
[36:46] oh friends there's a marking time and a
[36:49] ceiling time
[36:51] now going on
[36:53] where the beloved of god are being
[36:56] marked and sealed
[36:58] from that day
[36:59] which is here upon us
[37:02] this time
[37:05] while the people are enjoying
[37:08] belshazzle's feast of plenty
[37:11] belshazza's feast of pop
[37:13] of lust
[37:15] while the people are enjoying
[37:18] their dances
[37:20] with the devil
[37:22] while they're enjoying
[37:24] their striptease dance tripping the
[37:27] church of every doctrine of every truth
[37:30] of every
[37:31] word of every revelation they
[37:34] should have they're being explained away
[37:38] they're being torn away they're being
[37:40] taken away and the true church being
[37:44] strict of the strength of its beauty and
[37:47] of the graces that god has given to the
[37:50] church amen
[37:52] and all we see
[37:55] is the laughter all we can hear is the
[37:58] murmur of the madness of this
[38:01] this trunk that has been carried away by
[38:05] their misery and their spiritual poverty
[38:08] and the hand is writing on the wall
[38:12] and telling you this is not the sign of
[38:15] revival this is the sign of judgment
[38:19] upon the face of the earth not just upon
[38:22] babylon
[38:23] natural babylon back there but
[38:26] judgment upon the earth and upon mr
[38:29] babylon the system that is running and
[38:34] moving and influencing the earth
[38:36] we know the bible says
[38:39] don't you know
[38:40] that many are going to come in the last
[38:43] day
[38:44] reading
[38:45] lord lord have we not done many
[38:48] wonderful works in thy name
[38:52] even to the casting out of devils
[38:56] and he will say depart from me
[38:59] you walkers of inequity remember these
[39:04] men were casting out devils
[39:07] these men had healing revivals
[39:12] these men had genuine uh things
[39:17] taking place with them and amongst them
[39:19] judas himself was one of them
[39:22] and what did jesus say
[39:25] workers of iniquity
[39:28] why they did not have the revelation of
[39:30] the word
[39:31] and if they caught even a little bit of
[39:34] it
[39:35] they knew what was right
[39:38] but didn't do it and didn't obey what
[39:41] god's word said to them
[39:44] man that can come
[39:46] pray for the sick
[39:48] my friends
[39:49] oil and blood and everything on the
[39:51] platform like that all men are
[39:54] supernatural
[39:56] and that alone will cause people to
[39:58] gather around them
[40:00] and
[40:01] and yet my friends living without any
[40:04] moral
[40:05] values
[40:07] on clean living
[40:08] drinking carrying on
[40:11] oh
[40:12] they get exposed the people see it and
[40:14] yet they're left alone why because well
[40:19] you know
[40:20] god is doing this god is using him
[40:23] anyhow and so it must be god
[40:27] and that's how we find our age is so
[40:30] spiritually poor
[40:32] oh my
[40:34] poor and poverty stricken to the core
[40:37] and they don't even know it
[40:40] furthermore
[40:42] our scripture says
[40:44] you are blind
[40:46] and naked
[40:48] an age
[40:50] that is blind and naked
[40:54] how can one be blind
[40:56] and naked
[40:58] and don't even know it
[41:00] how can you be blind
[41:02] and so naked
[41:04] and yet you're going out into the
[41:06] streets
[41:07] flaunting yourself of this great big
[41:10] church at the corner of the street
[41:12] corners
[41:14] and don't know that you're naked and
[41:16] you're
[41:18] miserable and blind
[41:21] yet my friends
[41:23] this can be
[41:24] clearly seen in the story
[41:28] of elisha
[41:29] and gaher's eye
[41:32] when they were surrounded by the syrian
[41:34] army
[41:36] and remember
[41:38] it was the prophet
[41:40] the very message of the prophet that
[41:43] smalled them blind
[41:45] for the prophet small the syrians blind
[41:50] and
[41:51] but what kind of blindness that was
[41:54] for it was a peculiar blindness
[41:57] their eyes were open
[41:59] they could still see
[42:01] naturally
[42:02] but yet there were blind for they could
[42:06] not see elijah
[42:08] elisha
[42:09] nor the hezei
[42:11] they couldn't see the prophet like many
[42:14] today cannot see the prophet's message
[42:17] neither can they see the
[42:20] the his helpers they can't see the
[42:23] message whatsoever
[42:26] they can't see where they're going
[42:29] they can't see where they're headed
[42:31] and so
[42:33] there's a peculiar blindness going on
[42:35] now
[42:36] where those people will argue debate and
[42:40] tell you we are not blind we see we know
[42:44] we know the greek we know the
[42:46] we know all of the aramaic we know the
[42:49] languages we know the grammatical uh way
[42:52] of putting this over we understand that
[42:55] we have translations we have various
[42:57] things that can prove what we are saying
[43:00] and they'll prove it to you and make you
[43:02] look simple and on no body while they
[43:06] elevate themselves with a great pride
[43:09] you see but certain things
[43:14] they could see
[43:16] other things they could not see
[43:20] they could not see elisha no hazel
[43:23] they could not see the camp of israel
[43:26] that was there and today what do we have
[43:30] a prophet again has preached the word
[43:34] blind in the eyes of some
[43:36] open the eyes of others
[43:39] until they can't see
[43:42] the revealed word
[43:44] of this age
[43:46] they are we live in
[43:48] they cannot see our sense
[43:51] oh
[43:52] the power and the presence
[43:55] of the eternal
[43:57] messenger from heaven
[44:00] the mighty angel the covenant angel
[44:04] christ himself
[44:06] revealing himself
[44:08] the god of the prophets
[44:10] come with his own word to interpret his
[44:13] own word amongst his people
[44:15] and yet they're looking back at the john
[44:17] the baptist of the age
[44:19] not recognizing him the mighty god
[44:23] hallelujah on the scene
[44:26] they can't see
[44:29] the crossing
[44:31] we've come to the crossing
[44:33] ending of the seven church ages
[44:37] and they can't see the crossing
[44:40] the gap
[44:41] between the ages and the capstone
[44:44] they can't see the crossing over
[44:48] from the seven day week
[44:50] of the seven church ages
[44:53] into the eternal church age under the
[44:57] inspiration
[44:59] of the eternal heaven sent
[45:02] messenger from heaven
[45:05] not men of earth
[45:07] no man
[45:08] no man
[45:10] no group of men
[45:12] but invisibly eternal messenger from
[45:15] heaven
[45:16] jesus christ
[45:18] come down to walk among his people
[45:23] share his self and his presence
[45:25] oh god and to reveal him his own word to
[45:29] his own glory to god they can't see this
[45:34] church age
[45:36] capping the ages off hallelujah and
[45:39] because of that
[45:42] they cannot see the unfolding
[45:45] of the rapture revelation
[45:47] taking place
[45:49] right before the very eyes
[45:52] abraham and sarah
[45:54] transformed
[45:56] from all to new
[45:59] from all to young
[46:01] the mighty god working upon the bride
[46:05] and her change has taken place
[46:08] amen
[46:09] the body changed now in progress
[46:12] the rapture now in progress
[46:15] the translation
[46:17] now in progress
[46:19] not speaking in towns but the new towns
[46:22] of the holy spirit
[46:24] taking a hold of the hearts and the
[46:26] lives of god's people o blessed be his
[46:30] name thank you lord thank you jesus amen
[46:35] my friends people believe they have it
[46:38] all and they know it all
[46:41] and they can't be taught
[46:43] they wouldn't listen
[46:45] to anyone
[46:47] unless they you arrive to a place where
[46:50] you are acceptable to their tastes
[46:53] uh then they will listen to that and
[46:56] you'll have to you imagine that you'll
[46:58] have to produce all kinds of
[47:00] certificates of recognition uh and
[47:03] credibility for an acceptance before
[47:06] they will even listen to what has to be
[47:08] said not realizing that they should be
[47:11] having an ear to hear the truth the
[47:15] revelation of the word of god amen
[47:19] yes sir
[47:20] i want to know how many of god's people
[47:24] today
[47:25] have their heirs really open to the
[47:28] truth
[47:30] god's great prophet has said
[47:34] there's only one percent
[47:38] let me repeat
[47:40] there's only about one percent
[47:43] that really genuinely sees and accepts
[47:48] the truth of god's word
[47:52] and we must accept all scripture for all
[47:54] scripture
[47:55] is given by inspiration
[47:58] and profitable for doctrine
[48:01] for reproof
[48:02] and for correction
[48:04] amen
[48:06] hallelujah
[48:08] my brothers and sisters
[48:10] god furthermore says
[48:12] you're blind
[48:14] or can you imagine something as tragic
[48:17] as that
[48:18] a man that is blind trying to cross a
[48:22] busy street
[48:23] with trucks and cars going by at
[48:26] tremendous speeds
[48:28] and when you step up to him
[48:32] and say sir uh can i help you
[48:36] go across the street so you won't be
[48:38] harmed and he he knocks your hands away
[48:41] and says no leave me alone
[48:44] you're the one thinking i can't see but
[48:46] i can see i know where i'm going i know
[48:49] what i'm doing and he strikes your hands
[48:52] away and he continues walking out into
[48:55] the dangers of the traffic that is
[48:58] taking place my friends there's only one
[49:00] answer that man is living in a state of
[49:03] oblivion
[49:04] his faculties are gone he's suffering
[49:08] from a form of insanity
[49:10] he is suffering from spiritual amnesia
[49:14] and is not recognizing he has lost his
[49:17] identity
[49:18] he has lost my friends
[49:21] all of his uh of himself
[49:23] and now
[49:25] is groping around in the darkness of
[49:28] insanity and still confident
[49:32] that he knows who he is he knows where
[49:35] he's going and you can tell
[49:38] that he is spiritually blind
[49:41] wretched
[49:43] naked
[49:44] miserable and don't even know it oh my
[49:49] can it be
[49:50] that the scripture is being fulfilled
[49:54] that man has put god out of their minds
[49:58] romans 1 28
[50:00] and even as they did not
[50:03] like to retain
[50:04] god in their knowledge
[50:07] god
[50:08] gave them over
[50:10] to a reprobate
[50:12] mind
[50:14] to do things
[50:16] which are not
[50:18] convenient
[50:20] amen
[50:22] my friends
[50:23] here's a people
[50:25] today who are saying we are of god we
[50:28] are god's people we have the holy spirit
[50:32] and yet
[50:34] they live act
[50:36] dress
[50:38] and move spiritually
[50:40] naked
[50:41] blind
[50:43] and don't know it stripped of their
[50:45] doctrinal truths and strength
[50:49] satan
[50:50] has stripped them completely
[50:53] for his own
[50:55] dance of seduction
[50:57] oh god have mercy
[51:00] already deceived
[51:02] and having a wrong spirit upon them but
[51:05] thank god
[51:06] jesus said
[51:08] the elect cannot be deceived and will
[51:11] never be deceived
[51:14] thank god forevermore
[51:16] hallelujah praise god they've become
[51:20] blind
[51:21] because what they refuse the word of god
[51:25] they refuse god's word
[51:30] and because of that
[51:32] they have become spiritually blind
[51:37] they did not heed the word
[51:40] and they opened the door for the devil
[51:42] satan to come in
[51:44] and strip them
[51:47] of every truth
[51:49] every
[51:50] revelation
[51:53] from the word of god
[51:55] the entire armor of god was stripped
[51:58] away and taken away from them
[52:02] their wedding dress
[52:05] of the pure word of god
[52:07] was taken away
[52:09] and the bible said they're naked
[52:13] by leaving god's protection like eve did
[52:17] leaving god's care
[52:20] amen
[52:21] yes sir
[52:22] and they sought out their own ways
[52:26] oh there's a way that seemeth right
[52:29] until man but the ways thereof are the
[52:32] ways of death
[52:34] yes
[52:35] certainly my friends
[52:38] how
[52:39] we see
[52:40] them going out there building their own
[52:43] modern day
[52:45] religious
[52:46] church towers of babel
[52:49] amassing of wealth
[52:51] of manpower
[52:53] when the bible tells us in mr babylon
[52:56] will be found slaves the souls of men
[53:00] god have mercy upon our wretched and
[53:03] wicked age in which we are living in
[53:07] they appear to themselves that they are
[53:10] so
[53:11] dressed so beautifully
[53:13] their religious pageantry
[53:17] is to be admired
[53:19] the original religious pageantry
[53:22] is very eye-catching
[53:24] the bells the sound the the beauty of
[53:27] the presentations uh
[53:30] wonderful indeed but empty
[53:34] empty
[53:36] as a sounding drum
[53:38] as a tinkling symbol
[53:41] empty for it has not the capstone
[53:44] it has not the truth
[53:46] it doesn't have the revelation
[53:50] of jesus christ the same yesterday today
[53:53] and forever great assemblies great
[53:56] conscious great conventions empty of
[54:00] christ talking about christ but not
[54:02] having him
[54:03] talking about having the holy ghost and
[54:05] not having him
[54:07] talking about all these things and empty
[54:11] of it all whatsoever
[54:13] the organizations have led them into the
[54:16] camp of the antichrist
[54:19] and into the fields
[54:22] not of wheat
[54:23] but
[54:24] lead them into the the tears
[54:29] a field of tears
[54:31] oh my
[54:33] take god he has taken us out
[54:36] thank god he has taken the lilies
[54:39] out of the fields
[54:41] and leave them with a field of tears
[54:44] and there they go my friends
[54:48] ready for their binding and burning
[54:51] as the judgments of god are here upon us
[54:54] indeed they have become objects of pity
[54:58] and we pity them
[55:00] very much so
[55:02] and yet we try to warn them they will
[55:06] not listen
[55:07] you pity them they scorn you
[55:10] you beseech them and beg them they think
[55:13] you are weak they think you're foolish
[55:16] they take your talking nonsense
[55:19] they want to get away from you as
[55:21] quickly as they can
[55:23] they they'll walk away they'll go on the
[55:24] other side of the street whatsoever
[55:28] while you are trying to reach them with
[55:30] the truth of god amen still they go on
[55:35] headway
[55:36] over the cliff
[55:39] or going to their own destruction
[55:44] oh
[55:45] rightfully turning away any and all
[55:48] attempts that we might make to save them
[55:51] and bring them
[55:53] into the realms and ranks
[55:55] of jesus christ
[55:57] and in the great shining light
[56:00] of god's word for the age that we're
[56:03] living in
[56:04] head long to their own destructions
[56:08] miserable indeed yet they know it not
[56:11] their consciences
[56:13] their conscience
[56:15] and their consciousness
[56:18] have become so calloused
[56:20] and hardened beyond hope
[56:23] that what they are now glorying in
[56:27] is really their shame
[56:30] it's really their destruction
[56:34] defiant against the word of god like
[56:37] cain was
[56:38] the same spirit of cain upon the people
[56:43] rebels
[56:45] against the revelation
[56:47] fighting
[56:49] against the word of god
[56:51] and yet one day
[56:53] they will be judged by it
[56:56] judged by the very word of god they
[56:59] rebel against
[57:01] amen and they will pay the price
[57:04] of its awful
[57:07] indictments
[57:08] may god have
[57:10] mercy make this god who is so rich in
[57:14] mercy
[57:15] have mercy
[57:17] upon these poor
[57:19] wretched souls who don't think they're
[57:22] wretched who don't think they're
[57:24] miserable who don't think they're poor
[57:27] when they have naturally
[57:30] overflowing with goods or flowing with
[57:32] everything everything should leave grand
[57:34] that churches feel overflowing with
[57:37] thousands of people and every everything
[57:40] naturally they can see that but
[57:43] spiritually they are blind to the truths
[57:46] of god's word may god bless you my
[57:48] friends
[57:49] and may the word of god
[57:51] shine brightly and bring you into more
[57:54] reality
[57:55] of the fullness of the word of god
[58:00] now
[58:01] next wednesday
[58:02] we will no not be on
[58:05] line preaching like this but we will be
[58:09] in the sanctuary
[58:11] where the word of god will be preached
[58:14] and declared to you
[58:16] and may you take advantage of it and be
[58:18] blessed by it
[58:20] for the glory and praise of the living
[58:22] god
[58:24] at that time
[58:25] we will be talking and speaking on the
[58:28] god's final advice
[58:31] to this age
[58:33] may god bless us all
[58:34] when we come together like that to
[58:37] receive every blessing from the presence
[58:39] of almighty god
[58:42] [Music]
[59:16] you
