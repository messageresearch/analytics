video make it a blessing make yourself a blessing by sharing it and also may god bless us all together as we gather in his marvelous and wonderful name with our open bibles as i open the bible to revelation chapter 2 3 sorry reading from verse 1. if you'll open your bible then we will read together and on to the angel of the church in sardis write these things sayeth he that had the seven spirits of god and the seven stars i know thy works that thou hast the name that thou livest and are dead be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for i have not found thy works perfect before god remember therefore how thou has received and heard and hold fast and repent if therefore thou shalt not watch i will come on to thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what are i will come upon thee thou asked a few names even in sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me and white for they are worthy he that overcome it the same shall be clothed in white raiment and i will not blot out his name out of the book of life but i will confess his name before my father and before his angels he that had an ear to hear let him hear what the spirit said unto the churches a gracious god and heavenly father as we introduce this profoundly important subject may our hearts and minds father be saturated with the drenching reigns of the holy spirit we pray father that our understanding will be expanded our understanding will be opened up and the word of god will find fertile ground unprepared soil to thee be all the glory and the honor and the praise for we ask it all in no other name but that wonderful matchless and glorious name of our all conquering christ our lord jesus whom we live and serve to him be glory and honor now and forevermore amen and amen sardis sardis of course my friends was this great city here in asia minor but sardis which was once the capital of ancient lydia and was ruled by the lydians it passed from lydian monarchy to the hands of persian royalty and then fro from persian royalty it was conquered by alexander the great and alexander the great held it for a while until finally the city was sacked by antiochus the great this was followed by the rule of the kings of pergamos then the romans came just a bit later and took it over completely and began to rule now in the time of tiberius we find that that's the city was desolated by earthquakes and plagues began to ravage the city of sardius and today we find that great city a heap of ruins and uninhabited of course that the history of this city as we look back to it it was of a very important uh it was of commercial importance if important not just to asia malaya the mediterranean uh those areas but it was very important in the uh economy of the then known world we find out that there was invented plenty the great speaks of this how that wool dying the dying of wool and the weaving of carpets was actually invented in that area and it was a center of dying and weaving also in the area it was noted for the vast amounts of silver and gold that could be mined out of the area and as a result gold coins were first minted in sardis now all this sounds like i'm just giving you uh natural facts that may be found in history books but when we get to the application on the understanding of these inferences and these indications we will have a crystal clear understanding of what god is trying to say to us but i am just now laying the foundations for the rest of this study that is to come next week and the weeks that are ahead also in this city of sardis there were there was also a great slave market one of their commercial enterprises was in slavery enslaving other human beings but not was not only was this city one of commercial importance it was also one of a religion it was also a religious city but in particular this city uh based itself on the religion of siboli now simile was their goddess sibley this woman this female representation was their divinity that their worship let me repeat they had a religion of woman worship the worship of sibo lee now the meaning of her name it means earth's mother she was a nature goddess that encouraged the worship of nature and the divinity and deity of earth that we all came from the earth and she was mother earth and so goddess of the earth she was recognized and worshipped as civilly their goddess and prayed to and served in every possible way now this religion was one of impure worship you'll read even in your bible amongst the various prophets and if you were to read other pagan histories you'll find out that they love to have their worship in in groves and gardens and and and uh had all manner of according to dr barnes of the barnes new testament in his notes he says that the inhabitants of the city of sardis had a bad reputation amongst the ancients of that day their reputation was one of lust and licentiousness it all flowed from this religion of civilly lust licentiousness sexual crimes of evil took place under the guise of religion because of the worship of this so-called goddess the massive ruins of course of this temple may still be seen at this particular time you will recall when we talked we studied the pergamus church aged we mentioned about the connection to babylonious religion where with from the dim an ancient past within the midst of time you will remember how we spoke of the mother and son religion that came out from babylon and of course some weeks ago we talked about the waters or the religions that flowed out from these rivers of babylon and now in the present time of course we are encircled everywhere by every manner of the denomination that flowed out from this mother of mystery mother of confusion mother of chaos hear me friends as we look into god's word think pray believe and ask god to direct you listen not just saying uh i listened to what brother simon says search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life just don't have to take any man's word for it for god says let every man's word be a liar and my word be true may the words of god stand forever miss the tests of time may all the hammers become worn out and broken and the anvil of god's word remain stands to eternity from eternity to eternity this mother and son religion that issued out from babylon down through the various nations and the names of the god and goddess mother uh and son will change as it went from country to country but when it all comes back together it's actually the same goddess with our same son now spread out to many other nations who call them by the various names one area that may be called uh semiramis another area astate another area venus but whatever the names the history and mythology uh and the lies that surround this all comes together us pointing back to these this one mother and son later as we go into our study you will see how this babylonish religion was able to study and look into the christian religion and be able to subvert it twist it and to be able to apply the names of their babylonious gods and goddesses transferring them into christianity then beginning to use christian names on these false goddesses and gods now turned into saints now turned into holy ones using christian names and many christians being deceived by this invasion of paganism into christianity are now worshipping using christian terminology but in actual fact their worship has is is pagan worship under the guise and cloak of christianity and babylon of course civilian was called semiramis and the sun was called nina's here in sardis she's called not simiramis but siboli but it's the same deity the same goddess the same person and the son was called the aussie yourself in asia same ones my friends now the very attributes that were attached to these two in babylon are the same attributes attributed to siboli and her son diovios now in asia minor and later we will see that it's the same attributes that have been transferred on down through the centuries right into our day where they're given christian names first of all when we compare them side by side it's very enlightening it's very eye-opening so let us take a look at it right now according to the mystery religions of babylon he was the sun god and she the mother was the moon goddess think while i'm speaking and make applications in your own thoughts in your own mind to who is called uh the moon the mother of the moon or the moon goddess and he being the s-u-n god he was called the lord of heaven she was called this is back way back in babylon she was called the queen of heaven he was called the revealer of goodness and of truth she was called the one of gentleness and of mercy he was called the mediator she was called their mediated tricks listen he was always pictured with the keys before him and saying that he opens and shuts the gates of the invisible world she was identified also or pictured with the identical keys as if she had the same power to open and shut as much as the sun he called himself the judge of the dead and she is pictured as standing by his side along with him to judge the dead it is told that their son god was dead was killed dead and raised up from the dead and then ascended into heaven and that she the mother was carried bodily into heaven by her son now of course in rome that same title is being given to our lord to our lord jesus is given the title not called openly plainly but it's part of their mystery moving and changing from s u n god not much of a change of them saying yes we believe jesus is the son s o n of god he is called the son of god and she is called now the mother of god i want you to think of what us uh we said to you and brought to you and now apply this in your heart and in your thoughts amen yes sir she's called the mother of god of course we know that is impossible for if for if a god is god who has no beginning no ending no beginning no ending if he had a mother then the mother would be before him so these blasphemous thoughts and pronouncements god having a mother the mother of god god has no mother he said before me there was none beside me there was no there is none and after me there will be no none i am the lord he says he i am the lord thy god there is no other god beside me amen thou shalt not bow down to them nor serve them for i the lord thy god am a jealous god hallelujah amen this is the word of god amen so we found that in the form of ages that we have already studied that there was already this mother and god concept that satan allowed to filter out and to be in the atmosphere right before the people in the atmosphere but then it starts to crystallize as the ages go by it starts to take tremendous importance and tremendous proportions as it advances and back in babylon the worship of the sun just as it was began to lose favor until the people began to worship the mother more than they worshipped the sun they began to emphasize the mother more than the emphasis being on the sun apply that today and see what has happened as we look into the word of god amen so we find friends that this pagan worship of the city of sardis was a rotten pagan worship pagan religion of woman worship of course women are to be honored they are to be respected there to be love for their contributions to the world and it's it's expansion and multiplication we find friends here that sibley she became most projected and most important to them the name of our son the aussies just began to be in the background oh yes uh he's their son but she is the one and they place the importance on this divinity this goddess so-called siboli and she took the place of the sun until they began to endow her with qualities of the god-headed himself she became the one to be mainly worshiped she became the one to be lifted up she became the one that embodied all the qualities of divinity and godhood yes my friends we just have to go through the various titles of civilly and realize that hard titles and attributes literally you can place them beside the titles names and attributes of mary olitree right that has been accorded to mary by the roman church and there you will understand true historical origins of mariola tree or the worship of mary by the roman church we will see this in the weeks ahead as we delve into the histories and into the word of god do you want to know more will you open your heart listen learn lift up your head only believe and allow the great holy spirit to break the shackles of denominational religion break them from your mind free you from the hooks of a red hot claws that have caught within your mind but in your soul and now god why his word wants to break the chains and set you free now there are two things that are very very significant when we look into the worship of civility one is the fact that she wore a chain with a key just like the sun that gives her the very authority that the son has which of course we know that's not written in our scriptures the key to heaven and earth the key to all mysteries she claims this now under the name of mary sibo ciboli claimed that under the under her name back then but of course as i explained paganism turned uh under the guise of christianity now changed name from sibolee to mary and making the same claims we see it here before us right now my friends the next fact that is very important for us to take note of the worship of siboli worshipers on certain so-called divine holy days took all manner of whips took all manner of implements and whip themselves they whipped themselves until they were bleeding as part of the worship to civilly until the blood began to spurt from their bodies my friends to this day among the nations people that follow that romish religion of mereolatry still whipped themselves you may look at the term self-flagulation self flagulation self whipping and this they're told is that by doing this you're identifying yourself with the sufferings of our lord of course that is in contradiction to his word he who has said i have suffered that you may not suffer i become poor that you may be rich amen he died you might have life he suffered but you may not suffer he was already wounded for our sufferings he bore our sufferings he bore our sorrows he bore our pains and we may be delivered from them now and forevermore o may god help you to lift up your eyes of your heart and to see the truths of the word of god if you will read isaiah 53. phil read in the gospels where jesus himself said this that he suffered that you may not suffer he went without a home that you may have a home foxes have a home and the birds have a nest but the son of man had nowhere to lay his head dear my friends it's done today and many around the world especially at sukkah easter time time when jesus uh suffered for the sins of the world they claim they are identifying with the suffering of the lord by doing the acts of self torture self nailing self-flagulation and other unrighteous ungodly inhumane bloody acts that are contrary to the word of the living god but i must say this was the beginning of the first break from rome for the seed of god was now fixing to break forth and to begin to be restored in other words the reformation was just about to start amen and the first break from popishness and from papal rome came here and actually actually flourished it caused that jezebel religion this so-called church that has the attributes as the prophet s jezebel in the bible yes sir she began to consolidate and to emphasize her power because she had to do that using men as john tatsell and many other men to come against and to oppose protestantism that now began to raise itself up under the leadership of martin luther amen they began teaching of course in rome this doctrine that endures to this day and to this time of which i'm speaking protestantism under luto was preaching that mary is denied in having any part whatsoever to do with salvation of course they acknowledged that she was used as the virgin to bear the body in which our lord would use as his tent while here upon earth to manifest himself among the nations may i make a statement here always remember they're trying to project a false truth a false idea a lie that jesus came from mary but our lord did not come from mary but i say to you he was only allowed to pass through mary mary was only used as a carrier orreza couldn't do it that's all she was she's honored she's blessed oh and she is revered because of how she submitted herself in humility not to prophesy but to surrender herself to be blessed of god enough to carry his word and to bear the reproach of his word that there might be a birth from and through the word amen so luther crystallized this in his doctrine of their just shall live by revelation that just shall live by faith not just by believing but what luther was saying is that the just should live not by all these written uh litanies concepts bowls uh that are written in their books years year after year the same thing used over and over there may be a little uh transcription here or there but it remains essentially the same luther is saying no no no the word of god is not manhandled it is not to be manhandled but the just shall live by revelation god's word was written by holy man under the inspiration of revelation and so must it be received by the same spirit of god the spirit of revelation and so he said the just shall live by faith not by works though works has an important part to play but man shall not live by works but by faith man shall not live by works which they emphasize the works of what penance that is a work of man this is not in the bible the works of endless prayers of what jesus said the pagans do that gentiles do with their long prayers over and over repeating long prayers over and over and over jesus himself said that don't be like the gentiles are amen and turn real holy ghost prayers into the works of the minds of men and using all unscriptural means to subvert overturn and to bring question upon the very word of god planting their evils doctrines of seeds of discrepancy in this hour in the minds and hearts of men for hundreds of years until this day this dark planter of the sower of seeds continues his work to scatter his seeds of evil in the very uh fields of god that has been planted amen my friends but as the freed christians glorified the srn of god these romans increased their worship like priests of bill who jumped and danced all day long crying for the fire now they defy and glorify mary going to any great lengths that they can until my friends roman theologians under pope pius began to send out a bull is something that is absolutely uh a roman bull of the exaltation of mary exalting her to glorification in a resurrected body that is not found anywhere within the confines of the word of god we do not have any gospel or any bible any do away version of the bible where what we are empowered to do away with anything that is within the word of god but we'll stand by the word of god until that crown we bear on that great day may the great holy spirit help us amen that doctrine of course is a absolutely babylonious doctrine of the son carrying the mother into heaven along with himself this fifth age of sardis goes right along with the other ages and will do so for the ages all travel together amen officially they may end but they continue to go together those spirits of all the ages mingling mixing accumulating and increasing and there's a uniting time for them going on to the world council of churches but there's also a uniting time for the word of god and the people of god and the children of god where god is calling out a genuine true bride to fulfill the promises of his divine word amen hallelujah we know according to this bible that that harlot this harlot of this day will find her part in the lake of fire where the bible tells that the the harlot of the book of revelation will find her end along with her children will be killed and put to death by the second death which is complete extermination and extinction in the lake of fire there it is my friends the origins of mary olitery i did not say idolatry though one may be able to connect those things together but what i'm saying is about the historical origins of mary olivertree or the worship of mary who was under babylonian terms once called samurais letter called civili now called mary amen and do you know my friends if i might go a little back further go back that astarte who was the goddess worship by jezebel in the bible of who she was the prophetess of that goddess was the goddess astarte which is the same person just with the name changed they're masters of name change oh my it's something else ah you know how they can change names may god help us to understand in this day it's god by his holy spirit who reveals his word to us and changes our name and nature not man who just changes our not natural name copying what god did for jacob what god did for peter by revelate simon and change his name to peter by revelation and by his divine authority they are now doing it man doing it calling men and women and placing them into certain positions and claiming they have the power to change their names and give them certain authorities my friends that same jezebel that caused israel to stumble into ungodliness uncleanness and contrariness of the chaos of unbelief in this day on the different names or a different name she the great harlot is causing the church again to spiral into chaos and religious madness through deceit and lies may god help us in our day and in our times to be able to identify these evil characters oh think be spiritual minded and allow the holy spirit to be your leader to lead you and guide you that you may walk into god's great shining light may the great holy spirit be with us bless us watch over us in the days that are ahead and keep us bring us back together in his glorious name god bless you my friends and while you're at it share this video share this topic let it be proliferated be a blessing to many of your friends and family who need to hear this touch the share
