[1:57] well um last week we started started out
[2:00] by um starting to tell you that we'll be
[2:03] talking about the signs of
[2:07] times and uh actually in fact let's read
[2:11] first of all out of Matthew
[2:16] 24:4 Matthew 24:4
[2:30] let's I'm going to read from verse three
[2:32] and we land verse four uh as he sat upon
[2:36] the Mount of Olives the disciples came
[2:39] unto him privately
[2:43] saying tell us when shall these things
[2:46] be and what shall be the sign of thy
[2:50] coming and of the end of the world and
[2:54] Jesus answered and said unto them take
[2:57] he that no man see for for many shall
[3:00] come in my name saying I am Christ and
[3:04] shall deceive many and you shall hear
[3:07] wars and rumors of wars and see you may
[3:10] not troubl for all these things must
[3:11] come to pass but the end is not yet and
[3:15] Nation shall rise against Nation Kingdom
[3:17] against Kingdom and there shall be
[3:19] famines pestilences earthquakes and
[3:21] diverse places these are the beginnings
[3:26] of Sorrows amen praise the Lord father
[3:29] we have just read your word and we ask
[3:31] your blessing of Honor that you will
[3:33] break the bread of life to our hearts
[3:36] and give us strength for the journey
[3:38] give us oh God understanding that we
[3:41] might grow in your grace we wait upon
[3:45] your your coming father and while we
[3:47] wait we're feing upon the word of God we
[3:50] ask you to break it like you broke it by
[3:52] the Sea of Galilee and we ask your
[3:55] blessing now in Jesus name amen praise
[3:58] the Lord God bless you please be
[4:00] seated now we're not going to be um
[4:03] extra long or anything like that a
[4:06] middle of the week you you have lots of
[4:08] stuff in your mind or unless the Holy
[4:10] Spirit move in some special way and keep
[4:12] us here until
[4:14] midnight other than that we stay with
[4:17] with the um sensible actions that we
[4:22] should take amen now uh what we want to
[4:26] talk about is the in the in this age in
[4:29] that we living in and under the
[4:32] inspiration of the message that we are
[4:35] in the atmosphere around it the
[4:38] atmosphere in the entire world is using
[4:42] Brother Brandon's own words you must not
[4:47] misinterpret the word of God very
[4:50] true I'm talking about the dangers of
[4:55] misinterpretation danger of
[4:57] misinterpreting the word it's not that
[5:00] you don't have the word you may even
[5:03] have the true word but you end up
[5:06] misinterpreting the original word that
[5:10] you had because you're not looking at it
[5:13] and seeing it in the right
[5:16] way now we this age of living in is
[5:20] filled with a lot of
[5:23] that uh Believers are putting the
[5:26] emphasis in on different things that are
[5:29] not very not as important as it should
[5:31] be like the one man that was arguing
[5:35] with brother Brandon about how Jesus is
[5:37] going to
[5:38] come and U you know he said well it's
[5:43] not whether he's coming on a cloud it's
[5:45] not important that he's coming on the
[5:47] wind it's not important whe he's going
[5:49] to step from star to star or whe he's
[5:51] going to come down from heaven in The
[5:53] Chariot the main thing is he's
[5:55] coming but what I'm so use Believers get
[6:00] sidetracked and because they get
[6:02] sidetracked and that's a trick of the
[6:03] devil to make you think you got a
[6:06] revelation in the
[6:08] word uh and I'm thinking of a a certain
[6:11] brother that used to be us years ago and
[6:15] he Lov to dig into what he thought was
[6:17] deep
[6:19] stuff when he read A Thousand Years is
[6:22] as the day with the Lord of course she
[6:24] grabbed this computer thousand years is
[6:28] a day did
[6:30] that means that uh a thousand years is
[6:33] an evening gone or whatever he brought
[6:36] it down that therefore 1 hour is equal
[6:39] to so much so much you know and
[6:41] therefore he started to calculate and
[6:44] that means that the coming of the Lord
[6:45] should be around such and such a Time by
[6:48] his
[6:49] calculation then he'd have studies that
[6:51] he would do on the
[6:54] devil he studied the devil and the
[6:57] devil's Behavior and the devil's
[6:59] character I said brother you're you're
[7:02] heading for trouble that's right it's in
[7:04] the Bible I mean know who the devil is
[7:07] but why waste yourself studying about
[7:10] the devil why don't you study
[7:12] God you know I said if you have a white
[7:16] sheet of paper and I took a pen and just
[7:19] put one spot you don't have to ask me
[7:22] what's black because the spot appears
[7:25] and you right away you recognize it
[7:27] other than that you're heading for
[7:29] trouble and you going to misinterpret
[7:31] the
[7:32] word uh you look around there is
[7:35] millennialist people that believe that
[7:37] Jesus W come to the Millennium the
[7:40] Rapture would took place uh there's
[7:44] premillennialists like us we believe the
[7:47] Rapture is coming before the millennial
[7:50] right we believe that absolutely that
[7:53] he's coming before the Millennium praise
[7:55] God but there's actually people that
[7:57] teaching that Jesus is not coming after
[8:00] the
[8:01] Millennium uh of course some believe
[8:04] that they they're going up their their
[8:07] Rapture is going to be with the
[8:09] Jews and that they um to be saved you
[8:12] got to be a member of the honor of for C
[8:14] or else you're lost that's you have a
[8:16] witness doctrine of course and of course
[8:19] when they come to my house with that
[8:21] they don't come anymore I asked them I
[8:23] said well are you one of those 144,000
[8:25] they said well well well no because
[8:28] those are the ones sealed the forign you
[8:30] know one this I said well what if you're
[8:33] not a 100 part one of them what are you
[8:35] doing here what do you have to say what
[8:39] what actually you have to offer you see
[8:41] you have to be certain of God you can't
[8:44] guess about what you're doing you got to
[8:46] know who you are and you have to know
[8:49] that you know a Believer ought not to be
[8:52] opera on Spirit of giil a Believer are
[8:55] not to be operating on a spirit of
[8:57] condemnation amen we have not to be
[9:00] operating on the spirit but I'm hanging
[9:02] on I'm hoping and I trust I'm going to
[9:05] make it true no the prophet of God said
[9:08] you got to get to a place where you are
[9:10] sear of God search of God the word the
[9:15] Revelation the truth that it is thus say
[9:18] of the Lord and you can say like those
[9:21] thousands that were up there beyond the
[9:24] ve when they said he said I teach what
[9:27] Paul teach they said and we are resting
[9:30] on that praise God that's the way we
[9:32] ought to be resting on that that is th
[9:35] say the Lord nothing else we don't have
[9:38] to worry about nothing else amen praise
[9:40] God because we know he was he was a true
[9:44] Prophet amen there's no question about
[9:48] it and if he's a true Prophet don't you
[9:50] see how foolish you are just the
[9:52] question what the prophet is saying
[9:55] better you say I didn't understand what
[9:57] he was saying but don't say he was wrong
[10:00] don't say he didn't know what he was
[10:02] saying don't say well God you know
[10:05] called him to be a preacher and he tried
[10:08] to go out there and become a teacher and
[10:10] that's the reason why he messed up not
[10:12] knowing that a prophet a a genuine
[10:15] Prophet is really God in a body making
[10:19] himself
[10:20] man now don't get me wrong I wasn't I'm
[10:23] not saying brother Bram was God but I'm
[10:26] saying that the prophet is a divinely
[10:29] ordained
[10:31] body placed in a certain age so that
[10:35] when God comes to interpret his word for
[10:39] that age he has a body waiting that he
[10:43] can use it for that
[10:45] hour is that right and he he told us he
[10:49] would have that that he'll come manifest
[10:51] himself through Malachi
[10:53] 45 amen praise God so brother coming on
[10:57] the scene when he open this out to speak
[11:00] it wasn't brother Bram saying oh this is
[11:03] God speaking no it was God speaking
[11:06] through the prophet the spirit speaks
[11:08] through the prophet and saying thus
[11:11] sayth the Lord hallelujah in the old
[11:14] messes call looking onse used to have
[11:16] them in a big real to real text you can
[11:18] actually hear in the in in a part of
[11:21] that sermon I remember the beginning
[11:25] when he was making some comment all of a
[11:27] sudden a voice spoke out this is not
[11:30] William bradam speaking this is the Lord
[11:34] God Almighty come down William BR only
[11:38] Lord be his voice and his body thus
[11:41] sayth the Lorden who is saying thus say
[11:44] the Lord the Lord is s me right and
[11:48] that's the same thing with Moses Moses
[11:51] opened his mouth to say well God told me
[11:53] that he was I am that I am I am that I
[11:56] am sent me but it wasn't like that just
[11:59] in the word when Moses opened his mouth
[12:02] to speak the voice spoke out and said I
[12:05] am that I have amen but Pharaoh couldn't
[12:09] understand that God hiding in a human
[12:12] Veil and therefore they misinterpret the
[12:16] word and there's a lot of
[12:18] misinterpretations going around right
[12:20] now but it must be because Jesus said in
[12:24] Matthew 4 there will be false Christ
[12:26] amen false Christ it means false
[12:30] anointed
[12:31] ones praise the Lord you said anointed
[12:35] ones oh there must be the Antichrist no
[12:38] Prophet said in uh in the uh book of the
[12:42] message he was speaking on the message
[12:44] he start the rain falls on the just and
[12:47] the unjust amen the Holy Ghost the Holy
[12:51] Spirit falls on the just and the unjust
[12:55] both on the SE and the nonse he said but
[12:59] the nonseed has nothing in them to be
[13:03] rebor but the seed has something in it
[13:06] to be rebor but the anointed ones at the
[13:09] end time that's the message I was just
[13:11] trying to find where he said that he
[13:13] said that it's the same genuine holy
[13:17] ghost that falls on the
[13:21] believer falls on the other on it's the
[13:24] same rain fall on the weed and it falls
[13:27] on the we it's not a different Holy
[13:30] Spirit dropping on those
[13:32] Pentecostals it's how they interpret and
[13:36] manifest their anointing that comes on
[13:38] them the anointing drives us to the
[13:41] world that's right their anointing
[13:43] drives them to signs and wonders amen
[13:46] they're lust and thirst after that we
[13:48] thirst after the
[13:49] word because we're in a higher uh demena
[13:53] yes amen we're not in the first P second
[13:56] P anymore we in the third p
[13:59] amen CH is the Myst God revealed listen
[14:02] what he said he said watch 2:00 the
[14:05] second p is over the t is at hand he
[14:08] said did you hear the music it went into
[14:11] a higher octave right there glory to God
[14:14] hallelujah and that the entire bride and
[14:17] the understanding and interpretation of
[14:20] the Bride went into a higher OCT by
[14:23] Revelation for the word of God Amen
[14:25] praise God that's where we are here
[14:27] today brothers and sister
[14:29] Hallelujah we not Supernatural we're
[14:32] caught up already in the mystery amen
[14:37] amen you are a part of that mystery amen
[14:40] is that right you're a mystery to them
[14:43] is that right but you're a revelation
[14:46] when they need
[14:47] Christ amen so God hides in you and me
[14:52] and he hides himself and reveals himself
[14:55] true you and me when he chooses to do so
[14:58] oh praise the Lord Jesus Hallelujah so
[15:02] we are surrounded by misinterpretations
[15:04] and everything else now um we know that
[15:07] that has a reason and that's a purpose
[15:10] God uses that to do what like it said in
[15:12] the book of Psalm how that that which we
[15:15] must be shaken will be
[15:17] shaken is that right so that the things
[15:20] that should will remain but the
[15:23] foundation of God standed sure and the
[15:26] Lord know
[15:29] why because the Keystone the Cornerstone
[15:33] was laid in you before the foundations
[15:36] of the world to God hallelujah you have
[15:39] Blessed
[15:40] Assurance not because you're handing on
[15:42] and holding on but because you got a
[15:45] anchor a seed that was plac in the soul
[15:49] before the world a seed was there ready
[15:53] W
[15:54] the to do what anchor you to the word of
[15:58] God
[15:59] without that you be acting like
[16:01] everybody else but that's keeping
[16:05] us God true great
[16:08] Revelation that's how we kept praise the
[16:11] Lord glory to God Amen so the
[16:15] misinterpretations around you when they
[16:17] come don't let the devil use it to scare
[16:20] you realize that God is using it to
[16:23] shake the old
[16:25] tree so that the roots can go down
[16:27] deeper
[16:29] it didn't come to break you it came to
[16:32] make you is that right amen that's what
[16:36] it comes for so when you look around and
[16:39] you see all the
[16:40] misinterpretations and this one is fall
[16:43] away from the message they don't believe
[16:45] the prophet or he was wrong with here he
[16:47] was wrong with there listen the best
[16:50] thing you can do is shut your mouth
[16:52] brother BR said if you don't understand
[16:53] the best
[16:55] of don't say nothing amen amen right
[16:58] don't say
[16:59] other than that if you're going to say
[17:01] something say well I don't
[17:03] understand but before when I got in the
[17:06] message I heard the message being
[17:09] preached I heard serpent seed not
[17:11] preached but reading it in the books
[17:13] about serpent seed about one God water
[17:16] baptism I didn't understand everything
[17:20] but something coming out of those books
[17:22] and those messages and those tapes hit
[17:24] my soul and I believ everything before I
[17:28] understood
[17:30] is that right before I understood it
[17:32] intellectually I believe it in in the
[17:36] room Hallelujah the man in engine room
[17:39] grab the whole of it andc me and it
[17:43] willon let me go I'm still here run for
[17:46] Jesus keeping me alive am praise the
[17:50] name of the Lord God hallelujah amen so
[17:53] don't let these misinterpretations that
[17:56] going on around on the internet
[18:00] many knows about that all on the
[18:03] internet people that were in the message
[18:06] for 25 years I say oh I wasted my life I
[18:11] thought it wasn't truth God help you5
[18:15] years and here's one that just come in
[18:17] just the other day and they say oh my
[18:19] God I never heard anything like this
[18:22] praise the Lord hallelujah you see it's
[18:26] clear unto you is given to the the
[18:29] mystery of Amen King that is not praise
[18:34] the Lord uh one will be two will be in a
[18:38] bed one will be taken the other left two
[18:42] will be in a field gospel field amen
[18:46] they in the same
[18:48] church amen sitting in the same f one
[18:52] will be taken on the order of death
[18:56] Hallelujah you think it's waiting till
[18:59] you know who will be left behind they're
[19:01] being left behind right now by the
[19:03] Revelation Gap taking place right now
[19:07] you're left behind right now amen you
[19:10] don't really know it but you you better
[19:12] realize it you're left behind the
[19:14] Revelation Gap is increasing increasing
[19:16] increasing it's too late it's God and
[19:19] you didn't know about it praise the Lord
[19:22] so uh I'll make the point again do not
[19:26] be shaken or worried about all these
[19:28] Devils that are flying around amen
[19:31] hallelujah am praise God Amen some of
[19:35] you know that late last year uh couple
[19:38] of Brothers turned up here oh this is
[19:41] wrong that is wrong and I I don't see
[19:44] that in the scripture and this is not
[19:46] right what about this and what my
[19:49] goodness hallelujah amen well you know I
[19:52] don't have too much patience with the
[19:54] [Music]
[19:55] devil amen praise the Lord thank you
[19:58] Lord
[19:59] so so of course the first thing I said I
[20:01] said first of all uh you're talking to
[20:03] somebody older than yourself listen to
[20:05] how disrespectful you are you tell me
[20:07] that's the spirit of God Amen I said
[20:10] secondly you're talking to a Elder in
[20:13] the gospel and you you have to have
[20:16] respect you don't even have that and you
[20:19] calling that the holy spirit amen I said
[20:22] cly you're how long you're in message oh
[20:26] I've been in message 3 years and I know
[20:28] the word
[20:29] really oh you went 3 years mhm wonderful
[20:34] praise
[20:36] God Amen I said there you go again see
[20:40] so I said all I'm going to ask you is
[20:42] that don't bother coming back here
[20:44] because the deacons already are going to
[20:47] be told that you shouldn't set foot here
[20:50] in regards because I've got I've got
[20:53] young lambs and sheep and different ones
[20:56] coming up and I don't want you to friend
[20:58] to spread your foot on mouth disease you
[21:01] know uh uh this kind of stuff like that
[21:03] so that's it and so we said that
[21:06] straight by the grace of God but these
[21:08] Spirits are flying around amen you know
[21:13] a couple of weeks later I went up to
[21:15] brother Brooks to minister there and he
[21:17] say oh you know brother Simon do you
[21:19] know so and so certain Brothers came up
[21:22] to my church he said and the funny thing
[21:24] they arrived when I wasn't
[21:27] there and he started saying all kinds of
[21:31] confusing
[21:32] stuff and he said one of the deacons had
[21:35] the presence of M to call me I was he
[21:37] was way away somewhere else he said put
[21:39] him on the phone and brother Brooks did
[21:42] the rest so they hit the road and they
[21:45] left
[21:46] there about a month
[21:49] later but Elijah gets
[21:52] here praise God brother I want to know
[21:56] about two brothers you know that came by
[21:59] here you know do you oh I said oh my
[22:03] goodness I said brother I should have
[22:05] maybe called you ahead of time and kind
[22:07] of forward you or something like that
[22:09] and the next thing you know I'm heing
[22:11] they're up in new BRS with they up down
[22:14] here there over all over the place and
[22:17] but I'm not focusing on them I'm just
[22:20] saying that is the evidence that there
[22:23] is a spirit of
[22:26] misinterpretation seduction and illusion
[22:29] that's
[22:31] loose and it's operating right
[22:35] now and you need to do what hold to
[22:38] God's unchanging
[22:40] hands hold to God unchanging hand no
[22:44] worry about these things taking place
[22:46] upon you you see the word for the hour
[22:49] you're blessed just by your eyes being
[22:52] open bless are your
[22:55] eyes bless your heart because you
[22:59] yes here praise God Lord praise God
[23:03] sometimes we come to church and become
[23:05] so uh we so used to the message we think
[23:08] we're just as simple Ordinary People you
[23:10] know we just Christians are we walking
[23:12] around like that no you are a different
[23:16] part of the human race you are a part of
[23:19] the super
[23:21] race you are the super for the Y you are
[23:26] the fleshing red light that is coming
[23:29] call out by the grace of God hallelujah
[23:33] praise God you walk into any place and
[23:36] no matter how you try to hide after a
[23:38] while they going to know who you are
[23:40] right they know what kind of person you
[23:41] are they first of all say you different
[23:44] something about you watch it it's the
[23:46] genuine Holy Spirit and the devil go
[23:49] near it that's the reason people fear it
[23:52] but it's
[23:53] good amen hallelujah now I want you to
[23:57] know that the first misinterpret of the
[24:00] word was
[24:02] Satan brother says that clearly that
[24:06] Satan was the first one to misinterpret
[24:09] the word and he misinterpreted to
[24:13] Eve and he said now we see there the
[24:17] result of misinterpretation was
[24:21] what sin and the and death and sickness
[24:25] and suffering of the entire human race
[24:28] amen
[24:29] now Satan did that we see the evidence
[24:32] of it so therefore you know that any
[24:35] misinterpretation of the word that will
[24:38] be the fruits of it and that is what it
[24:40] will Bear right I think he says choosing
[24:44] of a bride he was saying he says we must
[24:47] be able to have the have the word of God
[24:51] pre straight direct is that right amen
[24:54] amen hallelujah he said because if
[24:57] you're going north you can't afford to
[25:00] Veer just even a little teeny bit he
[25:03] said down here it looks like nothing but
[25:05] if you keep walking in that little teeny
[25:08] uh thing he says by time you get a way
[25:11] up you're 200 miles up from you're
[25:13] supposed to be right because when you
[25:16] started you
[25:18] misinterpreted is that right you weren't
[25:20] going in the right direction not the
[25:22] place he puts it this way he says you
[25:24] got to line up your back side and your
[25:28] fright is that right praise God you
[25:32] understand what he's saying you got to
[25:34] line up history and you got to line up
[25:37] modern events being made clear by
[25:40] history you got to line the C things up
[25:42] in other words when you look at what's
[25:44] going on in the world today you are able
[25:47] to interpret it
[25:49] supernaturally by what the prophet has
[25:53] brought and interpreted the the trail of
[25:56] the serpent is that right
[25:58] the path of the the of of iniquity trail
[26:03] of iniquity of ungodliness and also of
[26:07] godliness amen the two seeds coming down
[26:10] we follow the path all the way and we
[26:12] look through history and he's given us
[26:14] all the CES so we can look at the day
[26:17] and interpret what's going on
[26:19] now
[26:21] Hallelujah and so we are a blessed
[26:24] people we are a blessed people
[26:26] Hallelujah Lord thank you Lord
[26:29] we we we actually know the news not just
[26:33] reading today's news but we know the
[26:35] news before they amen hallelujah we know
[26:40] one day we going to see a bigline say
[26:42] Angeles Sun the SE amen we we know these
[26:47] things because Prophet spoken thus say
[26:50] the Lord amen praise God so uh don't uh
[26:55] approach the word from the point of view
[26:59] because holy men of God did not write
[27:02] the me the word by private
[27:05] interpretation but they wrote the
[27:08] scriptures as they were inspired by the
[27:11] Holy
[27:12] Ghost so in the words I like the Bill
[27:15] Anderson song where he says I hel a
[27:18] pencil but he wrote this
[27:21] song I can do nothing alone I can do
[27:26] nothing alone I weak but my savior is
[27:31] strong I only held a pencil but he is
[27:35] the one true me that wrote this that's
[27:38] how they wrote the Bible it was men
[27:41] holding the P oh yeah he wrote it I saw
[27:43] him with the yeah but it was God writing
[27:46] it through them is that right Hallelujah
[27:50] wow praise God they are misinterpreting
[27:54] the word for the hour I better move on
[27:57] Hallelujah
[27:58] look where we at here now praise God
[28:01] Amen so we see here that you got to and
[28:05] understand uh also to be able to
[28:08] interpret and recognize your day and the
[28:11] message of your day to interpret the
[28:13] hour and the seasons that you are in is
[28:17] that right if you don't know what the
[28:20] season is that you are in you will
[28:23] misinterpret the word by trying to
[28:28] interpret a Lutheran
[28:31] lifestyle is that right
[28:34] in h a Capstone
[28:37] age or you're trying to live a Methodist
[28:42] lifestyle you see you're interpreting
[28:44] the word for that hour but not for this
[28:48] hour there's people writing the message
[28:51] they still interpreted
[28:53] interpreting Malachi 4:5 7 Church age
[28:57] I'm not
[28:58] understanding that sunset Mountain he
[29:01] came down is that right shout boys
[29:05] trumpet and the prophet who was bringing
[29:08] the word a prophet is interpreter of the
[29:10] word now God took him away because he
[29:14] wants to move that visible uh personage
[29:17] out of the scene so that we could look
[29:19] away to Jesus amen is that right we can
[29:22] look away to Jesus because he came down
[29:26] to do what to become
[29:28] that God is his own
[29:31] interpreter and he will make it CLE that
[29:35] he could whisper this bright
[29:38] ear lip to ear by revelation of the word
[29:42] of God that's right and she can now have
[29:44] confidence in the Revelation she is
[29:47] getting not only basing your salvation
[29:51] on what brother Bron told you that was a
[29:55] foundation for you to get your own faith
[29:58] amen is that right amen faith comes out
[30:03] of
[30:04] Grace is that right you can't have faith
[30:08] without
[30:09] Grace said no man can study himself Pi
[30:12] up a revelation he says Revelations by
[30:15] Grace God gives you a revelation by
[30:18] Grace therefore these are the words that
[30:21] he said not brother Brandon but his
[30:25] grace is greater than your faith amen
[30:28] amen praise the Lord God's grace is
[30:32] greater than your faith praise the Lord
[30:34] because without Grace you didn't have
[30:36] anything to believe on Grace made Faith
[30:40] possible Revelation possible Grace and
[30:43] Truth came by Jesus Christ and then
[30:47] Faith come and set all that amen so his
[30:51] grace is greater than our faith praise
[30:55] the Lord now see why we need need to
[30:59] understand and and not allow the devil
[31:01] to cause misinterpretations to upset you
[31:04] is because we are we we are now in the
[31:06] time where the Gentile Church age is
[31:10] starting to phase
[31:12] out as you know that the ages don't end
[31:15] abruptly like this this right they don't
[31:18] just end that's Pentecostal
[31:20] interpretation they think the raptures
[31:22] will to come only on a certain day and
[31:25] end like that and by the next morning
[31:28] tribulation begins but we know that he
[31:31] talks about the blending of those ages
[31:34] they overlap is that right and they run
[31:38] right out right like that time shall be
[31:41] no more that's not
[31:44] same time um natural time by the clock
[31:50] is going to stop The Day the Earth Stood
[31:52] Still he's not telling you that but he's
[31:55] saying time shall be no more
[31:58] it's the the time for this prophecy to
[32:01] be fulfilled the time is up it's got to
[32:04] be
[32:05] fulfilled amen this is the hour when the
[32:08] fullness of time was come God sent forth
[32:11] his son amen so you understand that so
[32:16] we have got to understand clearly here
[32:18] that the ages are the age being in the
[32:20] Middle where the age is changing now
[32:22] this whole thing is going back to the
[32:24] Jews amen praise the Lord amen praise
[32:27] God listen to what he says here notice
[32:31] here that the
[32:34] trumpets is a called Together For A
[32:37] Feast for a war for a person or for some
[32:42] sacred day or something like that oh yes
[32:47] see now you got the background now of
[32:51] the seals and the church after that
[32:55] we're going into the trumpet the Trump
[32:57] trumpet sounded trumpet in not war or a
[33:01] feast day and so on or what it means is
[33:04] a gathering together of the people the
[33:07] trumpet hallelujah praise God now you
[33:11] understand that the same another place
[33:14] he said the same seals that were open to
[33:18] us and the same thing that he
[33:21] preached he says to us there the seals
[33:26] and it's the revelation of Jesus right
[33:29] but when it goes over to the
[33:31] Jews and the two witnesses deliver it
[33:35] that's the Feast of the trumpets to
[33:37] them right now we are feasting on what a
[33:41] seven course
[33:44] meal by the greatest Chef the world has
[33:47] ever seen we're feasting on that se
[33:49] course meal right now and when the
[33:53] trumpet that trumpet
[33:55] sounds we raptured out the here
[33:58] right that's what he's talking about he
[34:00] said it speaks of War but also speaks of
[34:03] the Gathering Together of people and
[34:06] right now it's a uniting Time praise God
[34:09] it's a uniting time so we are uniting by
[34:13] the pull of the holy spirit amen not by
[34:16] people Gathering us some conventions but
[34:19] we are united by the Holy Spirit just
[34:21] like the wise men were United they
[34:23] didn't know each other one up in India
[34:26] the next one in Persia the next one
[34:28] and something pull their spirits and
[34:31] they start traveling to find this word
[34:34] this newborn message this word of God
[34:38] for the hour
[34:40] traveling and you know you know I've
[34:42] said it before brother BR Watchman watch

[34:58] life is tied right back here amen so
[35:02] while they're moving those Stars moving
[35:04] on the up there they're moving on the
[35:06] earth here and what happened those stars
[35:09] have to unite to become one big star is
[35:12] that right it's a prophet made us know
[35:14] that we thought it was one big bright
[35:16] star but he understand no it was Jupiter
[35:19] Venus and Mars all come together one
[35:22] star God is one God whatever came
[35:26] together as one Hallelujah
[35:28] but the thing about it when they were
[35:30] moving in the heavens the men were
[35:31] moving on the earth and when those stars
[35:34] come together like that these people
[35:36] that didn't know one another their paths
[35:38] crossed and they met amen hallelujah and
[35:42] they found that they saw the same thing
[35:44] believe the same thing and heading in
[35:46] the same direction they come from the
[35:49] East and the West they come from the
[35:51] land ofar to Feast with the king the D's
[35:54] guest how blessed these FS are

[37:01] gives an uncertain sound you who can
[37:05] prepare themselves for war or for peace
[37:08] or whatever who knows we have to know
[37:13] what the trumpet sounds and when the
[37:16] trumpet sounds we see something in the
[37:19] Earth today we see great trouble
[37:24] everywhere everybody knows it everybody
[37:27] is come the age has become neurotic the
[37:31] whole world is now a neurotic world I'm

[37:43] world and we know there is something
[37:47] wrong he says even to them there in the
[37:52] Pentagon and everywhere we know there is
[37:55] something wrong new
[37:58] not place he said it shall come to pass
[38:00] the whole world will
[38:02] go you know why they it's just like in
[38:06] demon possession I've seen people uh
[38:09] cast out the devil from somebody and it
[38:11] jumps on a person because they're not
[38:13] covered by the blood right is that right
[38:16] they're not protected by the blood all
[38:18] of a sudden this person was insane the
[38:19] next thing you know they have a clear
[38:20] mind next thing you know somebody scream
[38:22] over there they become insane because
[38:24] that devil that was making that person
[38:27] sayane jump and get on the other person
[38:29] that had no covering they have no
[38:31] covering at all amen and that's what's
[38:34] happening with us by the prophet
[38:36] bringing the message amen you been
[38:39] washed in the
[38:41] blood and not only that uh you've been
[38:44] given back your right
[38:46] mind Hallelujah because he brought you
[38:49] out of
[38:51] insanity insane in sin not much
[38:56] difference there he brought you out and
[38:59] Paul said now we have the mind of Christ
[39:02] and because you have the mind of Christ
[39:05] it anchors you and everything that's
[39:08] going on around
[39:09] you amen not that the devil is going to
[39:12] try to harass your mind and give you a
[39:15] little thing and this like that but he
[39:17] can't actually take control of you
[39:19] that's right because you have the mind
[39:21] of
[39:22] CHR amen Christ in you your hope of
[39:25] glory amen without him we can do nothing
[39:29] without him we'll surely fail without
[39:32] him we like shift with a mind that's
[39:35] loose and drifting amen without the sail
[39:38] but with him we are
[39:41] anchored we Anchored In Jesus who be
[39:43] fear no B of we praise the Lord
[39:46] hallelujah amen praise the Lord so he
[39:49] says we got now there are three must in
[39:53] Scripture that you must not do you must
[39:57] not interpret misinterpret the word
[40:01] Christ is revealed in his own word page
[40:03] 72 you must not misinterpret the word
[40:06] you must not misplace the word and you
[40:09] must not dis dislocate the word amen so
[40:14] you must not
[40:16] misinterpret the word of God but you
[40:19] must understand what it is praise the
[40:21] Lord now I won't go into all these
[40:23] quotations that I have here where he
[40:25] said he said they started out first by
[40:28] Mis misinterpreting him the person Jesus
[40:32] Christ that misinterpreted him and then
[40:35] in another message called God being
[40:38] misunderstood it's actually the same
[40:40] thing they misinterpreted him of who he
[40:43] was they misinterpreted his actions they
[40:47] calling me El every other name like that
[40:52] they didn't know who he was so
[40:54] misinterpreted the very God that they
[40:57] serving and they're misinterpret the
[40:59] very Bible that they're reading the very
[41:01] message that they're reading they
[41:03] misinterpret the word of God for the
[41:06] hour you must not misinterpret the word
[41:08] you got to have the right
[41:10] interpretation and for you to have the
[41:12] right interpretation in the word you got
[41:14] to have Revelation is that right
[41:17] Hallelujah W people were back in the
[41:19] days of Luther and while they were in
[41:22] the back of Luther Wesley came Wesley
[41:25] came because they had no revelation of
[41:28] Wesley they remained manifesting
[41:32] Luther's
[41:33] message and though it was right in their
[41:36] age when they brought that over in the
[41:39] age of from Luther and they brought it
[41:41] over in the age of Wesley it became a
[41:44] misinterpretation of the word for that
[41:47] day is that right and all these all
[41:52] these uh people right down from Luther
[41:54] Wesley Methodist all of them come right
[41:57] down and they miss the prophet's message
[41:59] they're trying to live a Christianity
[42:02] which is a
[42:04] misinterpretation of the word are you
[42:06] follow amen they living a Christianity
[42:09] that is a
[42:11] misinterpretation of the word praise God
[42:13] you got to know uh what your lines are
[42:17] you got if you if you're an actor in the
[42:20] play and um you have Act One 2 three
[42:24] write up to act 78 whatever you the the
[42:27] the whole book of Acts anyway so there
[42:30] you are and um you just step on the
[42:35] stage you not you don't have any
[42:38] understanding of the script you have no
[42:40] revelation of the script and you
[42:42] stepping out on the stage when it's not
[42:44] your time that's right or your time is
[42:48] passed and you going to step out on the
[42:50] on the stage and you misinterpreting you
[42:53] you're you're interpreting something and
[42:55] your interpretation might be beautiful
[42:57] there's a lot of people out there that
[42:59] look like real Godly Christians you
[43:01] couldn't touch them is that right oh
[43:04] yeah but they are trying to project a
[43:07] past age into the present age when they
[43:12] failed to recognize their day and the
[43:16] message for them and because they
[43:19] haven't recognized
[43:21] that they're sincere they're genuine but
[43:25] all they're producing is a
[43:26] misinterpretation of the word of
[43:29] God and that's what they're giving to
[43:32] the people and it's so seductive that a
[43:34] lot of people buy into that is that
[43:37] right am praise the Lord hallelujah wow
[43:42] think about
[43:44] it listen what did the prophet
[43:48] say the angel tell the prophet don't get

[44:07] speak when you step out is that
[44:11] right praise God brother Brandon I

[45:15] do that walk head this that everything
[45:21] we are under inspiration of the mighty
[45:24] angel that came down and the mighty
[45:26] angel is the Covenant angel that he said
[45:28] is no one other but Christ
[45:31] himself that's inspiration amen and his
[45:35] Spirit quickens the word for the hour
