[16:55] commit it into your hands in Jesus name
[16:58] we pray
[16:59] amen and amen amen
[17:03] hallelujah so as we read now it came to
[17:08] pass in the days when the judges ruled
[17:13] that there was a famine in the
[17:16] land and when you talk about a famine in
[17:19] the land now it's right now not for
[17:22] bread and water but for the word of the
[17:24] Lord amen and a certain man of Bethlehem
[17:28] Judah
[17:29] went to sourn in the country of Moab he
[17:34] and his wife and his two
[17:37] sons and the name of the man was AMC and
[17:41] the name of his wife Naomi and the name
[17:45] of his two sons Maron and
[17:48] chilon ephes of Bethlehem Judah and they
[17:52] came into the country of Moab and
[17:56] continued there
[17:59] and Emet Naomi's husband died and she
[18:03] was left and her two sons and they took
[18:07] them wives of the wom of Moab and the
[18:11] name of one was Offa and the name of the
[18:15] other root and they dwelt there about 10
[18:20] years and Maron and Chan died also both
[18:24] of them and the woman was left of her
[18:28] two sons and her husband what a
[18:33] time then she arose with her daughters
[18:37] inlaw that she might return from the
[18:40] country of Moab for she had heard in the
[18:43] country of Moab how that the Lord had
[18:47] visited his people in giving them
[18:50] bread wherefore she went forth out of
[18:54] the place where she was and her two
[18:57] daughters in law with her and they went
[19:00] on the way to return unto the land of
[19:03] Judah and Naomi said unto her two
[19:07] daughters-in-law go return each to her
[19:11] mother's house and the Lord deal kindly
[19:15] with you as he have dealt with the dead
[19:19] and with
[19:21] me the Lord grant you that you may find
[19:25] rest each of you in the house of her
[19:28] husband
[19:29] then she kissed them and they lifted up
[19:32] their voice and wept and they said unto
[19:34] her surely we will return with thee unto
[19:38] thy people and Naomi said turn again my
[19:42] daughters why will you go with me are
[19:46] there yet any more sons in my womb that
[19:49] they may be your husbands turn again my
[19:53] daughters go your way for I am old to
[19:57] have an husband if I should say I have
[20:00] hope if I should have a husband also
[20:04] tonight and should also be a son would
[20:07] you T for them till they were grown
[20:09] would would you stay with them for
[20:12] having husbands near my daughters for it
[20:15] grieveth me much for your sakes that the
[20:19] hand of the Lord is gone against
[20:24] me and they lifted up their voice and
[20:27] wept again and offer kissed her
[20:30] mother-in-law but root clave unto
[20:34] her and she said behold thy sisterin-law
[20:39] is gone back unto her people and unto
[20:42] her Gods return Thou after thy
[20:45] sister-in-law see God started a great
[20:47] work in your life and there's no turning
[20:50] back Hallelujah no turning back amen
[20:53] don't go back to your old ways to your
[20:55] old country your old habits amen once
[20:58] God open up your eyes amen keep pressing
[21:02] on Amen keep marching on Amen Hallelujah
[21:05] there's nothing to turn back to right
[21:08] amen hallelujah praise God I don't want
[21:12] just to this to be like a story for you
[21:14] tonight I want you to listen carefully
[21:17] what the Lord will may be speaking to
[21:19] your heart tonight amen this Bible study
[21:23] amen hallelujah praise
[21:27] God but this is the the sweetest part of
[21:30] the story that everybody should
[21:33] loveen and Ruth said entreat me not to
[21:38] leave thee or to return from falling
[21:41] after thee for with thou goest I will
[21:46] go and where thou lodgest I will
[21:50] Lodge thy people shall be my people and
[21:55] thy God my God now remember remember
[21:58] where where Ruth came from from a
[22:01] heathen country amen and by the example
[22:05] Naomi said to her change something in
[22:08] her
[22:09] life amen
[22:11] hallelujah where thou dest I will die
[22:14] and there will I be buried and the Lord
[22:17] do so to me and more also if ought but
[22:22] death part thee from me amen it's like a
[22:26] a bow she took amen amen a vow she took
[22:29] amen when you take a vow to the Lord
[22:32] amen hallelujah you keep that vow amen
[22:36] hallelujah praise God until death amen
[22:40] but a Christian don't die hallelujah
[22:44] praise
[22:44] God when she saw that she was
[22:47] steadfastly minded to go with her then
[22:50] she left speaking unto her so the two
[22:53] went until they came to Bethlehem and it
[22:57] came to pass when when they were Come to
[22:59] Bethlehem that all the city was moved
[23:02] about them and they said is this Naomi
[23:06] May Lord add as blessing to the reading
[23:09] of this word you all may be seated
[23:11] tonight amen
[23:14] hallelujah now in our study of the woman
[23:17] of the Bible we have looked at
[23:19] Eve Sarah Rahab and tonight we are
[23:24] taking the character of
[23:26] Ruth amen
[23:29] in the Book of Ruth many of you run over
[23:32] the top of that book and you don't think
[23:35] about the lessons that we can learn from
[23:38] that book amen you'll find it's just a
[23:41] short reading or something like thaten
[23:43] or just another
[23:46] story but as according to our prophet he
[23:49] said that is one of the greatest
[23:53] story that was ever recorded in the Old
[23:56] Testament is it type of
[24:00] Christ amen hallelujah praise God now we
[24:05] seen a culture that traced its lineage
[24:08] almost
[24:09] exclusively through men these women
[24:13] stand out like beacons in a host of male
[24:16] names and you can take all the male
[24:18] characters in The Bible amen but there
[24:22] were only few women that were recorded
[24:25] in the Bible and God had a reason for
[24:30] thaten Hallelujah as we would see
[24:33] tonight men praise
[24:36] God say they stand out and they still do
[24:40] because we talking about them
[24:43] today their presence clearly brings us
[24:47] the question who were these women and
[24:51] why did the Holy Spirit singled them out
[24:55] as a as ancestors of the Messiah
[25:00] Hallelujah we looked at Rahab not only
[25:03] she was a prostitute but also a
[25:06] Canaanite a people marked by God for
[25:11] judgment and yet not only did she saved
[25:15] herself but she saved her
[25:18] family but she joined the faith amen of
[25:25] Israel she married into the Royal tribe
[25:29] of Judah and the lineage is a powerful
[25:34] reminder that even in the face of
[25:36] certain judgment salvation is available
[25:41] through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ
[25:44] amen hallelujah so through her lineage
[25:48] of RAB came Boaz in this story tonight
[25:52] amen in this Bible study tonight
[25:55] Hallelujah now we see Ruth repres reprs
[25:59] Grace Joy friendship loyalty and
[26:04] commitment remember those words amen and
[26:07] try and put yourself in that in that
[26:11] category Hallelujah are you joyful
[26:15] tonight amen are you have are you have
[26:18] the grace of God in your life are you
[26:21] committed to the work that he has called
[26:23] you to do are you loyal to him amen
[26:28] hallelujah praise God thank you Lord
[26:32] Jesus you see this story took place
[26:35] sometime during the rule of the judges
[26:38] as we read from the beginning of our
[26:40] reading tonight amen these were dark
[26:43] days for Israel when the people did
[26:46] whatever seemed right in their own sight
[26:50] as is recorded in Judges chapter
[26:53] 17: 6 21 and 25 so the every man did
[26:59] according to what he think was right so
[27:01] as we might say in modern Palance they
[27:04] did they did their own thing amen
[27:07] hallelujah that's right in contrast to
[27:10] all the other women mentioned in the
[27:13] bible root stands out as one of the
[27:16] characters we could learn a lot and
[27:19] pattern our lives with the example that
[27:23] she
[27:24] sets amen
[27:26] hallelujah amen Ruth is one of the
[27:29] brightest and most appealing figures in
[27:33] all
[27:34] scripture
[27:37] Hallelujah now that famine must be
[27:40] really great for EMC to move it his
[27:43] whole family down to Moab
[27:47] amen here we see famine struck the land
[27:50] and Naomi her husband with her two sons
[27:53] left Bethlehem and reside in Moab
[27:58] she her husband her two sons left
[28:00] Palestine a type of the church they left
[28:05] Palestine went over in the land of Moab
[28:09] amen a country which was worshiping
[28:14] Idols they were Idol worshippers amen
[28:17] but remember where the tribe of Moab
[28:19] came from the moabites they were the
[28:22] descendants of lot with an incestous
[28:25] amen relationship right amen
[28:29] hallelujah they had for maybe at the
[28:33] beginning they maybe had part of God in
[28:36] their life but they turned over onto
[28:39] idolatry amen
[28:41] hallelujah that's a symbol of
[28:44] backsliding like Israel did any Jew that
[28:48] left Palestine was out of the will of
[28:51] the Lord God gave Palestine to the Jews
[28:55] and said remain there
[28:58] amen so if God place you in a in a
[29:02] position in a place stay there until he
[29:05] wants to move you amen amen you are
[29:08] blessed wherever God places you amen
[29:12] hallelujah praise God though the the the
[29:16] the the the circumstance around your
[29:18] life may seems like contrary but God is
[29:23] obligated to bless you where he place
[29:25] you Hallelujah the Lord in Deuteronomy
[29:29] 233 says an ammonite or a
[29:34] moabit shall not enter into the
[29:37] congregation of the Lord even to the S
[29:41] generation shall they not enter into the
[29:44] congregation of the Lord
[29:46] forever because they met you not with
[29:49] bread and with water in the way so
[29:52] that's when the children of Israel left
[29:55] Egypt and they were going through on
[29:56] their Journey the moabites prevented
[30:00] them from passing through their land and
[30:03] giving them water here what the Lord
[30:04] says when he came forth out of Egypt and
[30:08] because they hired against the BAM the
[30:11] son of beop of Mesopotamia to Cur you
[30:17] nevertheless thy God would not haen onto
[30:21] bam but the Lord thy God turned the
[30:24] curse into a blessing unto you
[30:28] because the Lord thy God loves you so
[30:33] what God blesses bless hallelujah what
[30:37] God curse is Curse amen so you can't
[30:40] going to bless what God curse amen
[30:43] hallelujah and we seen that happening

[44:18] them until they grow up man man so she
[44:23] wasn't only thinking about herself Naomi
[44:27] she was thinking about her daughter's
[44:29] in-law amen
[44:31] hallelujah Naomi was
[44:34] expressing herself as if God is
[44:38] punishing her and his presence has left
[44:42] when she said for it grieveth me for
[44:44] your sake that the
[44:46] Lord that the hand of the Lord is gone
[44:49] against
[44:51] me man she was thinking because she knew
[44:56] where they Where She Went Wrong and by
[44:58] leaving from under the protection of the
[45:00] Lord from leing a land where God had
[45:05] placed her in and we all know when we
[45:08] leave from under that protection amen
[45:10] and Trouble Comes we just say oh we
[45:12] paying for
[45:14] iten Hallelujah we paying for what we do
[45:17] amen hallelujah and somewhere along the
[45:21] road sometimes you might go off of
[45:23] course amen but God does bring us back
[45:27] amen he just bring us back amen
[45:30] hallelujah and she believed that God was
[45:32] punishing her by taking her son and
[45:36] taking her
[45:38] husband here we can learn a great
[45:41] lesson despite Naomi's best efforts to
[45:46] dissuade her root clung onto her amen
[45:52] hallelujah not only she clung onto her
[45:54] she clung onto the god that
[45:59] served Hallelujah that's where the the
[46:02] the the the the the blessing lies unto
[46:05] the god that Naomi serve unto the god
[46:09] that you serve people are following you
[46:11] because who you are amen when they see
[46:14] the god that you serving they follow
[46:16] that God amen amen as the Apostle Paul
[46:20] said it's not I that live but Christ
[46:22] that lives in me he do the works yes
[46:25] amen he does the change amen he does the
[46:28] converting amen he does your turn around
[46:31] on your life he does this the stop he
[46:33] stops the drinking the smoking the
[46:35] carousing and all that that's the one
[46:37] who can do it it's not I but he that
[46:40] lives in me that does it Hallelujah when
[46:43] you got that testimony you know
[46:45] something really really struck amen an
[46:48] individual life when they can see the
[46:51] god that is living in you amen
[46:53] hallelujah praise God thank you
[46:57] Lord yeah even in her desperate
[47:00] situation Naomi had a selfless
[47:05] attitude although she had decided to
[47:07] return to Israel she encouraged Ruth and
[47:11] offer to stay in Moab and start their
[47:15] lives over even though this means
[47:17] hardship for them man Naomi was not just
[47:22] considering her own needs but the needs
[47:24] of her two daughters-in-law
[47:27] now in the Jewish
[47:29] custom if someone's husband dies it was
[47:34] allow for the Widow to marry another man
[47:38] from the same household in order that
[47:42] the seed is carried on Amen the law kept
[47:46] the Widow from poverty and provided a
[47:49] way for the family's name of the dead
[47:52] husband to be carried on so and I'll
[47:56] just tell you where it's at it is from
[47:59] levitic sorry Deuteronomy
[48:02] 255 and it is stated as the levate
[48:06] marriage found in JW
[48:09] Judaism the brother of a man who died
[48:13] without children is permitted and
[48:16] encouraged to marry the Widow taken from
[48:19] Deuteronomy 255 and to
[48:22] 10 you see Naomi did not have any sons
[48:26] for Ruth to offer to marry so she
[48:29] encouraged them to stay in their
[48:31] Homeland and
[48:33] remarry offer agreed which was her right
[48:37] to do man it's a choice choose this day
[48:41] who you want to serve you're going to
[48:43] serve God or you're going to serve the
[48:45] devil there's only two ways about it
[48:47] you're going to follow Christ or you're
[48:48] going to follow Satan amen hallelujah
[48:52] praise God Ruth was willing to give up
[48:55] the possibility of security and children
[48:58] in order to care for
[49:02] Naomi amen you see Ruth was willing to
[49:06] leave her Homeland and go to Israel amen
[49:10] are you willing to forsake the world
[49:13] Amen and join up with if Gods despised
[49:17] you amen you started out with Jesus and
[49:20] you're going
[49:21] true hallelujah praise God you see Ruth
[49:27] was a
[49:28] moabites but that did not stop her from
[49:32] worshiping the true
[49:34] God nor did it stop God from accepting
[49:38] her worship and for blessing her man you
[49:43] see the Jews are not the only people
[49:46] that God
[49:48] loves God chose the Jews to be the
[49:51] people through whom the rest of the
[49:54] world will be blessed
[49:57] as we go back to the story of Abraham
[50:00] amen hallelujah praise God as Peter
[50:05] expressed in
[50:07] Acts chapter 10: 34-
[50:11] 36 of a truth I perceive that God is no
[50:17] respector of
[50:19] person but in every nation he that
[50:23] feareth him and WTH righteousness is
[50:27] accepted with
[50:30] himen
[50:32] so Hallelujah the word which God sent
[50:36] unto the children of Israel preaching
[50:39] Peace by Jesus Christ he is Lord of all
[50:44] so if God says I accept you who going to
[50:48] reject
[50:49] you amen
[50:52] hallelujah God accepts all who worships
[50:56] him you believe that yeah the true
[51:00] worshipper worships him in spirit and in
[51:05] truth and the father seeketh
[51:08] such Amen in every nation he accept
[51:13] those who fear Him and do what is
[51:17] right God accept those who worship him

[1:01:03] they arrived in Bethlehem at the time of
[1:01:05] the Harvest of The Barley
[1:01:08] season Bethlehem was surrounded by Lush

[1:01:15] were
[1:01:17] abundant

[1:01:46] test it's all a test for Naomi and it
[1:01:51] becomes a test for us many times
[1:01:54] amen you see Ruth and Naomi returned to
[1:01:58] Bethlehem was no
[1:02:00] coincidence but it was certainly God's
[1:02:03] plan because in this tongue of David
[1:02:07] would be born as predicted by the
[1:02:10] prophet Micah in chapters 5 verse2 that
[1:02:14] where Jesus also where David was going
[1:02:17] to be born and also Jesus was going to
[1:02:19] be
[1:02:20] born this move was more than me
[1:02:24] convenience
[1:02:27] it look like a good opportunity yeah to
[1:02:30] to to to to to get by then man but it
[1:02:34] led to the Fulfillment of
[1:02:37] scripture you have to look at the bigger
[1:02:40] picture we don't see the bigger picture
[1:02:43] when we going through our test and
[1:02:45] trials when we see situation arrive
[1:02:47] around our lives everything looks
[1:02:49] distorted out of place and everything
[1:02:52] but later down the road you Le back and
[1:02:55] say wait a minute that is what the Lord
[1:02:58] has been dealing with me to bring this
[1:03:01] about so when disappointment come is not
[1:03:04] disappointment really you know he said
[1:03:07] all things the disappointment and the
[1:03:11] not so good things is going to work out
[1:03:13] together for your good amen
[1:03:18] hallelujah it's just for the Fulfillment
[1:03:20] of script you see God has a big plan and
[1:03:23] we just are players in God's hands
[1:03:26] to work things out to his perfect will
[1:03:29] and plan amen
[1:03:31] hallelujah you see when the Harvest and
[1:03:34] B were ready to be harvested Harvesters
[1:03:37] were hired to cut down the stalks and
[1:03:40] tie them into bundles so they landed up
[1:03:43] when the Harvest they started to reap
[1:03:46] the crops amen barley wheat and corn the
[1:03:50] Israelite law demanded that the corners
[1:03:53] of the field not to be
[1:03:56] harvested in addition any grain that was
[1:03:59] dropped was to be left for the poor to
[1:04:01] be picked
[1:04:04] upen it was supposed to be used for food
[1:04:08] and in Leviticus 199 it says when you
[1:04:12] reap the Harvest of your land thou shal
[1:04:16] not wholly
[1:04:17] reap the corners of thy field neither
[1:04:21] shallal thou gather the gleaning of thy
[1:04:24] Harvest
[1:04:26] and in Leviticus 23 22 says when you
[1:04:29] reap the Harvest of your land thou shal
[1:04:32] not make clean riddance of all the
[1:04:35] corners of the field so you know what
[1:04:37] the Lord saying don't cut everything
[1:04:39] leave some leave some and anything that
[1:04:42] fall on the ground don't pick it up
[1:04:44] leave it leave it amen hallelujah my and
[1:04:49] that's going to be entering into our
[1:04:52] next part of our study and I hope
[1:04:56] not tonight by God's
[1:04:58] grace Amen on
[1:05:02] purpose and leaving it out on
[1:05:06] purpose
[1:05:09] hallelujah praise God Thou shalt leave
[1:05:12] them unto the poor and to the stranger I
[1:05:16] am the Lord your God
[1:05:18] Amen and that process was called
[1:05:22] gleaning amen the purpose of the law was
[1:05:26] to feed the poor and prevent the owners
[1:05:29] from hoarding amen you know some people
[1:05:32] even like to everything sweep the floor
[1:05:35] clean don't leave nothing behind if the
[1:05:37] fruit fall in the ground nope nobody
[1:05:39] can't get
[1:05:40] thaten you see but when is we serve a
[1:05:43] god of
[1:05:44] abundance amen of abundance the birds
[1:05:47] have to feed man this start together
[1:05:50] amen the creatures out there amen
[1:05:52] hallelujah praise God and here we see he
[1:05:54] said leave it for the the poor and the
[1:05:57] strangers you see God always have ways
[1:06:04] men you see Ruth made her home in a
[1:06:07] foreign
[1:06:09] land instead of depending on Naomi or
[1:06:14] waiting for Good Fortune to happen she
[1:06:17] took the
[1:06:19] initiative I hope he listening
[1:06:21] tonight am man she sees the opportunity
[1:06:25] to go to work she was not afraid of
[1:06:29] admitting a need or working to fulfill
[1:06:32] that
[1:06:35] need and God used that to provide for
[1:06:41] her and on this note if you are waiting
[1:06:44] for God to provide consider this he may
[1:06:48] be waiting on you to take the first
[1:06:51] step man to see how desperate you are
[1:06:56] for that
[1:06:58] need
[1:07:00] man and as our Prophet really put it out
[1:07:03] nicely here usually it
[1:07:06] takes a state of
[1:07:09] emergency to throw us into desperation
[1:07:13] you want to wait on that
[1:07:16] time it's too bad it has to be done that
[1:07:19] way but human beings are so slothful in
[1:07:23] their mind that it takes an
[1:07:27] emergency something arises and when they
[1:07:29] do then it throws them into that
[1:07:33] desperation and really in doing that in
[1:07:36] desperation it brings out that real
[1:07:40] thing that you
[1:07:43] are man it
[1:07:45] shows what you're made out
[1:07:48] of it's in the time of
[1:07:51] desperation Hallelujah
[1:07:55] see Naomi did every sorry Ruth did
[1:07:58] everything that was necessary to get by
[1:08:02] you know a lot of people believe yes God
[1:08:04] is my provider I just open my mouth and
[1:08:06] food will fall from Heaven and fill
[1:08:09] Meen God don't like
[1:08:12] laziness you say you have to walk to
[1:08:16] eat you see a man that doesn't walk
[1:08:19] shouldn't eat at all St the scripture
[1:08:22] man Hallelujah he said by the sweat or
[1:08:25] your brow you going to eat
[1:08:27] bread man so you have to work man you do
[1:08:32] you do something and then God go do the
[1:08:33] rest for you amen action for reaction
[1:08:38] you start up amen praise
[1:08:42] God what is your attitude when the task
[1:08:46] that you have been given is not up to
[1:08:49] your
[1:08:50] expectation the task at hand may be all
[1:08:54] that you can do do or it may be the work
[1:08:58] that God wants you to
[1:09:00] doen and as I said before amen the grass
[1:09:04] looks greener on the other side why God
[1:09:07] prospering them and they God they
[1:09:09] prospering me amen I should be doing
[1:09:12] what them doing and then God will
[1:09:14] prosper me but if God call you to do

[1:09:24] content with in any state that you are
[1:09:26] in God's going to bless you
