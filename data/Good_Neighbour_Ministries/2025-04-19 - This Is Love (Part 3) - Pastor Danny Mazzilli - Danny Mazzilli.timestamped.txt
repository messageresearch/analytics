[10:38] is
[10:40] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[10:43] Glory to God. Let us bow our our heads
[10:46] and our hearts today, Father.
[10:49] Lord,
[10:51] Lord, so many years
[10:53] ago, Lord, you were hanging there on the
[10:57] cross and a thief looked
[11:00] over and you said, "Lord, remember me."
[11:03] And you looked back and you said, "Today
[11:07] thou shalt be with me in paradise."
[11:10] Oh God, I say today Lord because the sun
[11:16] has risen
[11:17] again. Oh God, you came in this day and
[11:22] with a 20th century prophet
[11:24] Lord and there was a rising of the
[11:27] sun. The word of God was restored back
[11:31] to the bride of Jesus Christ. And today
[11:34] we come together and we assemble
[11:36] ourselves together under that great
[11:40] umbrella of the Holy Ghost. Father,
[11:42] Lord, because the kingdom has come,
[11:44] Lord, through the new birth of the
[11:46] opening of the word of God in this last
[11:48] day, Father, Lord, the attributes of God
[11:52] have come to life. Hallelujah. There's
[11:55] been a resurrection, Lord. And we're not
[11:57] here to to mourn or or to weep, Lord.
[12:00] We're here to celebrate, Father, what
[12:02] you've done for us, oh God. Lord, that
[12:05] you have come now and you're living in
[12:09] flesh again, Father. The word of God is
[12:12] coming into full manifestation in this
[12:15] hour, Lord. Lord, how can we celebrate
[12:18] anything else but that? Because that is
[12:20] your resurrection in the bride of Jesus
[12:23] Christ again today, Father. Lord, and as
[12:26] we gather together today, Lord, let us
[12:28] worship you, Lord, truly with this
[12:31] revelation upon us in spirit and in
[12:34] truth. Father, Lord, just take control
[12:37] of the service, Lord. You said you are
[12:39] the head of the church that you might
[12:41] have the preeminence amongst us. And
[12:43] that's what we want more than anything,
[12:45] Lord, to be lost in you tonight, Father.
[12:49] Not lost in ourselves, not lost in our
[12:51] flesh, not lost in our mistakes, Lord,
[12:54] but lost in you, Lord, tonight, Lord,
[12:57] just to be caught up in the spirit of
[13:00] the living God. Come and move in this
[13:03] service, Lord. Come and fill this place,
[13:06] oh God. I pray, Lord. Come anoint each
[13:08] and every one, Lord, that will have to
[13:12] stand here and and sing the songs of
[13:14] Zion of worship, pointing the people to
[13:17] Christ, Lord. And as your word would
[13:19] come forth tonight, Lord, that you have
[13:21] given to your servant, Lord. Lord, just
[13:24] come and take the word and place it
[13:28] where it needs to be placed in our
[13:30] hearts today, Lord God, so that we may
[13:32] leave here rejoicing, Father. Oh God, I
[13:35] pray if there's any sick, Lord, Lord,
[13:39] your stripes, you have declared and you
[13:41] have spoken it, Father. By my stripes,
[13:45] you are healed. It's not something that
[13:48] that it's going to be done. It's done.
[13:50] It's been spoken. So, let it be spoken,
[13:54] Lord. Let it be done tonight, Lord. All
[13:56] you need is somebody to believe it,
[13:58] Father. All you need is somebody to
[14:01] accept it tonight. And as your word
[14:03] would come forth, you said, "I sent my
[14:05] word and I spoke my word in this day and
[14:10] it went forth and it healed the people.
[14:13] It delivered the people. It set the
[14:15] people free." Lord, we come here tonight
[14:17] to feed to to receive and accept the
[14:21] benefits of Calvary, the this to accept
[14:24] the benefits of the resurrection. Not
[14:27] only 2,000 years ago, but now in this
[14:31] day, thou has risen again, Father.
[14:34] Hallelujah. Glory to your name, Lord. We
[14:37] thank you. We praise you, Lord. Give us
[14:39] your spirit in in measure tonight,
[14:42] Father, that we can truly worship you in
[14:45] spirit and in truth. Bless each and
[14:48] every one, Father, Lord, and just have
[14:50] your way. In Jesus name we ask.
[14:53] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[14:57] You can be seated for a few minutes.
[14:59] Praise God. But it certainly is a
[15:01] privilege in 2025 to be able to come

[24:40] But the introduction for this song, the
[24:44] title of it, But uh the characters are
[24:48] two the apostle
[24:50] Peter who Jesus had said flesh and blood
[24:54] didn't reveal
[24:56] himself but his spirit and of course
[24:59] there's the woman at the well of
[25:01] Samaria who he changed her life because
[25:06] he met her inside her spirit woke
[25:10] up. So the name of this song is Calvary
[25:13] for what he did for us.
[25:17] [Music]
[25:31] I said that I would die for
[25:35] him. I really thought I
[25:39] could. But there I was denying him.
[25:45] I never thought I
[25:48] would. I failed the Lord. I let him down
[25:54] after all he's done for
[25:57] me. But now he's walking up a hill, a
[26:03] hill called Calvary.
[26:11] [Music]
[26:13] Calary.
[26:17] Calary. Was it meant for
[26:21] him? Was it meant for
[26:25] me?
[26:27] [Music]
[26:29] Calary.
[26:31] [Music]
[26:34] Calary. Is that my cross? He's taken to
[26:40] [Music]
[26:42] Calary in my sin and told me no in sin
[26:48] no
[26:50] more. Ever since that day I'm not the
[26:55] way I was
[26:58] before. I only came to thank him for the
[27:03] life he gave to me.
[27:07] But there he's going up a hill, a hill
[27:12] called
[27:17] Calary.
[27:19] [Music]
[27:21] Calary.
[27:25] Calary. Wasn't meant for
[27:29] you. Wasn't meant for me.
[27:33] [Music]
[27:37] Calary
[27:41] Calary is that my cross is
[27:46] [Applause]
[27:46] [Music]
[27:57] taking wasn't meant for him.
[28:02] wasn't meant for
[28:04] [Music]
[28:08] me.
[28:13] Calary is that my cross is taking to
[28:17] Calary.
[28:22] that my cross is taking to
[28:28] [Music]
[28:35] Calary.
[28:38] Amen. Yes, it was it was my cross that
[28:41] he was taken to Calvary which uh you
[28:44] know there's a funny thing that a way
[28:47] that people talk in this day. You know,
[28:50] if somebody has if you have a a sports
[28:52] team for instance that you're uh you
[28:55] like and they lose, you'll say, "Oh, we
[28:57] lost yesterday or we won yesterday." To
[29:01] me, it doesn't make sense. But a lot of
[29:03] people talk like that. You know what I
[29:04] mean? They have nothing to do with the
[29:05] team, but they they they talk like
[29:07] they're part of the team. Oh, we did
[29:08] this and we did that. We did this, we
[29:10] did that. Meanwhile, you're just a fan.
[29:12] But I'll tell you one thing we can
[29:13] identify with or we can say we is his
[29:18] victory. Right. Amen. Brother, sister,
[29:21] you have no victory of yourselves. I
[29:23] have no victory in myself, but we have
[29:25] victory in Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[29:28] And how many are claiming his victory
[29:30] tonight? Otherwise, you know, don't
[29:33] don't take your next
[29:35] breath. Oh, you did. You took your next
[29:37] breath. Claim his victory by the grace
[29:39] of God. And F if you would, would you?
[29:41] Praise God. Let's stand for everyone.

[29:48] old
[29:50] story of how a savior came from
[29:56] glory and how he gave his
[29:59] life on

[34:20] Musicians, glory to God. How many are
[34:22] happy to be in the house of the Lord

[34:26] evening? Amen. Praise our
[34:31] God. We are grateful for this day. I
[34:37] know the world um you know celebrates it
[34:41] in many different ways.
[34:43] um in the Philippines, you know, I I
[34:45] received a a message, an article today
[34:49] from uh Brother John Simon, and uh
[34:52] they're, you know, they're doing things
[34:53] there where they're crucifying people,
[34:56] you know, um trying to uh you know,
[34:59] relive thinking that they need to uh
[35:02] experience the
[35:03] crucifixion
[35:05] again. God bless you, brother Chris.
[35:07] It's good to see you in the house of the
[35:08] Lord. Amen. And uh and you know such a
[35:13] such a shame that they have not realized
[35:16] the great victory that was produced
[35:20] 2,000 years ago on Good Friday. Amen.
[35:24] And it was our victory. It was truly our
[35:27] victory, saints. And uh wow, the world
[35:31] is just um in turmoil. They don't
[35:35] realize how how great God is. How
[35:39] wonderful his spirit is available in
[35:42] this day and in this hour to bring
[35:44] healing, deliverance, to set people
[35:46] free. And yet they want to go and suffer
[35:50] when he suffered once for our sin. Amen.
[35:54] Praise God. Amen. And so let's go to the
[35:56] word of God this
[35:58] evening. Um we are going to be going to
[36:02] the Lord's supper. We're just going to
[36:04] speak
[36:06] shortly and uh we're going to let the
[36:09] Holy Spirit just uh minister to our
[36:12] hearts um to bring us into the reality
[36:16] of what what truly Good Friday and this
[36:20] Easter season is all about. Amen. We
[36:23] know we know what it's all about. We've
[36:26] been given clarity by the word of God to
[36:28] know what it's all about, saints. And so
[36:31] we can rejoice in the word of God.
[36:33] Amen. Praise God. And so, we're going to
[36:37] continue. We've been on a series, This
[36:39] is Love. I don't, you know, I I believe
[36:42] there's nothing greater that the Lord
[36:43] could have done. There's nothing greater
[36:45] that anybody could ever do than to lay
[36:47] their life down for someone else. And we
[36:50] know that uh the Lord had a great plan
[36:53] in his heart that he had a desire to lay
[36:57] down his life for a purpose. And that's
[36:59] what we want to look at this evening.
[37:02] We'll read from our
[37:05] scripture 1 John
[37:08] 3:16. It says, "Hereby perceive we the
[37:11] love of God because he laid down his
[37:14] life for us and we ought to lay down our
[37:19] lives for the brethren." Amen. Amen. Let
[37:22] us pray. Father, thank you, Lord. What a
[37:26] tremendous opportunity that we have,
[37:28] Lord, to minister your word tonight and
[37:30] to be assembled with brethren of like
[37:34] precious faith, especially the faith
[37:36] that you've made available in these last
[37:39] days and especially in this hour, oh
[37:41] God, to the true church, to the church
[37:44] that have been awakened by the word of
[37:47] God in this day, Lord. And it brings an
[37:50] atmosphere. It brings your presence to
[37:52] the to the services. Lord, you're
[37:55] pleased when we tap into your thoughts
[37:58] and the things that you are doing, Lord,
[38:01] right now in the midst of a a world
[38:04] that's falling apart, but yet there is a
[38:08] a wonderful love that's being uh
[38:12] penetrated into the hearts of your
[38:14] children. And it is attracting them to a
[38:17] love and to a a a a relationship that
[38:21] that words cannot uh put you can't put
[38:24] words on it. Lord, this relationship
[38:27] that you've given us, it's something
[38:28] that we did not try to bring about. We
[38:32] had no idea that you would come to us at
[38:36] an appointed time, Lord. That that the
[38:39] word would awaken something within us
[38:41] that we didn't even know was there.
[38:44] Lord, we were we were lost in sin. We
[38:47] were sinners. But while we were yet
[38:50] sinners, you loved us and you gave us
[38:53] life, Lord. And so tonight, Lord, as we
[38:56] as we go into the depths of your word,
[38:59] Lord, may your anointing just come and
[39:02] Lord open hearts and deliver and set
[39:04] free. Lord, may may there be a reality
[39:08] tonight, Lord, as the word goes forth
[39:10] that it will change lives, Lord. It'll
[39:13] it'll make uh such a difference Lord
[39:16] that they will leave here Lord saying
[39:18] our heart my my heart burned within me
[39:22] as the word and as we we we talked and
[39:25] fellowshipped with you Lord grant it we
[39:28] pray father take absolute control of
[39:31] this vessel now in the name of Jesus
[39:34] Christ for your glory. Amen and amen.
[39:37] Hallelujah. You may be seated. Amen.
[39:46] Saints, this is love.
[39:50] This is love. You can go to the next
[39:53] slide. God's great plan, God's
[39:57] tremendous
[39:59] desire to be in fellowship with his sons
[40:04] and daughters, with his attributes,
[40:07] God's great plan of love. This is what
[40:10] this is all about. This is why we are
[40:13] here tonight because God had a desire to
[40:16] have fellowship with attributes that
[40:19] were within himself. It's it's like you
[40:21] can say it this way, you know, God God
[40:24] desired to have fellowship with himself.
[40:27] But the only way that he could do that
[40:28] was to express himself into other
[40:32] beings, into his own image, to express
[40:35] himself into individuals whereby he
[40:38] could have fellowship and and and make
[40:41] love in a way that that goes so much
[40:45] beyond the the the the carnality of what
[40:49] love is in this world that we live in
[40:51] right now. Amen. It was a tremendous
[40:54] plan and it all started back in the
[40:57] garden of Eden where he desired to
[40:59] express himself and he did when he
[41:01] expressed himself in Adam and in Adam
[41:04] was was his attribute of male and female
[41:07] and he desired that that that that they
[41:10] would be uh um you know in in this
[41:13] earthly existence of of no space and no
[41:18] time where they could just continue to
[41:20] speak the word and
[41:22] express sons and daughters to come into
[41:25] a great relationship and fellowship.
[41:28] That's why Job, you know, you hear Job
[41:30] saying, "Where were you when the sons of
[41:32] God rejoiced together before the
[41:35] foundations of the world? This was his
[41:37] great plan. This was his great desire."
[41:40] But then entered in the deceiver,
[41:43] entered in Satan, came into the garden.
[41:46] And now you know Adam's wife Eve
[41:50] actually her name was not even Eve her
[41:53] name was Adam. And when she was
[41:56] approached by that by that great
[41:58] deceiver to uh you know to deceive her
[42:01] into the adultery because that's what
[42:03] really took place in the Garden of Eden.
[42:05] That's why it's it's the one thing that
[42:07] destroys it's it's one of the greatest
[42:09] things that that's destroying families
[42:12] in this day that we're living in right
[42:13] now. People want to satiate an apple.
[42:16] How could how could eating an apple open
[42:19] conscious
[42:21] realization? It wasn't an apple. It was
[42:24] it was it was an adultery. Satan
[42:27] injected him his him his seed into Eve.
[42:30] And that's why Adam called her from that
[42:33] moment when when when the when the when
[42:35] the children were born, he realized that
[42:37] there had been an adultery. And and and
[42:40] he called her name Eve, the mother of
[42:42] all living. And because of that sin,
[42:46] death entered in to the human race.
[42:49] Death entered into the world. God's plan
[42:52] was kind of temporarily put into a into
[42:57] a a a suspended animation, if you want
[43:00] to call it. It was just placed. But God
[43:04] God wasn't finished. God knew exactly
[43:06] what was going on. He knew what he still
[43:08] had a desire to do. He wanted he still
[43:11] wanted that plan to be fulfilled and
[43:14] there was nothing that was going to stop
[43:15] him. And that's why he had the great
[43:18] plan of of coming to the earth making
[43:23] the sacrifice to redeem his wife to
[43:26] bring her back to that perfect state
[43:29] back into himself where they could
[43:31] become one again. Amen. And that's why
[43:34] we're here tonight talking about Good
[43:37] Friday. Hallelujah. We could elaborate a
[43:40] lot more on that whole plan, but maybe
[43:41] we'll we'll get a little bit more on
[43:43] Sunday. But here, you know, Adam's first
[43:47] bride fell and brought death to every
[43:50] human being. So Jesus Christ, the second
[43:52] Adam, the Bible says, the quickening
[43:55] spirit, the one that would come and and
[43:58] quicken every son and daughter of God,
[44:02] every attribute of God back to their
[44:04] original position as sons and daughters
[44:07] of God. you came into this human flesh,
[44:10] it's temporary.
[44:12] It's a temporary habitation.
[44:15] Amen. But when the word of God was was
[44:18] uh was came over you and brooded over
[44:20] your life, not just you know church uh
[44:24] um tradition, not just being in a
[44:26] church, no where the spirit of God
[44:29] himself came to you personally and
[44:32] started to brood over your life and
[44:34] started to you know awaken you to to him
[44:38] to his love. That's what that's what is
[44:41] called the new birth. That's what brings
[44:43] about a change in your life that you
[44:46] you'll never be the same again. Amen.
[44:49] And this is what it was all about. This
[44:51] is why Calvary had to come. Amen. So
[44:54] that he could come and and take the
[44:57] place. Let's read Romans chapter
[44:59] 6 verses 3 to8. It says here, "Know ye
[45:03] not that so many of us as were baptized
[45:08] into Jesus Christ were baptized into his
[45:11] death?
[45:12] that when he came on that day on that
[45:17] Good Friday when he went to the cross
[45:20] and he he was nailed to the cross you
[45:23] were nailed to the cross in him because
[45:24] you were always in his mind.
[45:28] You were always a part of his desire.
[45:31] There was no way that he there was no
[45:33] way that you could be lost because you
[45:36] were already in him. Amen. He just he
[45:39] just needed to go and and fulfill the
[45:42] the the his word, his own word that he
[45:44] said that if a man's sins, a man must
[45:46] die. And so when he went to Calvary and
[45:50] died for every sin, all your sin went
[45:54] and got pinned right to that cross.
[45:58] And that's why today you can you can
[46:00] claim the victory that comes from from
[46:03] that day on Calvary. Amen. Therefore, we
[46:06] are buried with him by baptism into
[46:10] death. So when you know that's why when
[46:12] when somebody is baptized in water,
[46:15] they're baptized and their old life gets
[46:19] buried, right? It gets left buried in
[46:24] the water, if you want to call it,
[46:26] because going underwater, it's like
[46:29] going into the earth. It's death. And
[46:32] when you rise up, you rise up new. It
[46:35] says that like as Christ was raised up
[46:38] from the dead by the glory of the
[46:40] father, even so we also should walk in
[46:44] newness of life. So that when you come
[46:47] out of that baptismal tank, you come
[46:50] out, you've got a brand new life.
[46:54] Your whole life has been complete.
[46:56] That's that's the born again experience.
[47:00] If the reality has taken place on the
[47:03] inside, that's when you go to the water.
[47:06] Remember, you could go to the anybody
[47:08] can go to water and be
[47:09] baptized. But it's one thing to be
[47:12] baptized uh just by going to the water
[47:14] coming going in a a wet a dry sinner
[47:17] coming out a a wet sinner. But it's
[47:19] another thing if God has awakened within
[47:22] you to realize that that you were that
[47:26] that you needed to be cleansed of this
[47:29] old nature. You need to be born again.
[47:32] You need to leave that old life and you
[47:34] need to bury it. Then that changes
[47:36] everything. When that happens first,
[47:39] you'll run to the water. Amen. Amen.
[47:42] Praise God. For if we have been planted
[47:45] together in the likeness of his death,
[47:47] we shall also be also in the likeness of
[47:50] his resurrection.
[47:52] Amen. Knowing this, that our old man is
[47:56] crucified with him, that the body of sin
[48:00] might be destroyed, that henceforth we
[48:03] should not serve sin. For he that is
[48:07] dead is freed from sin.
[48:10] If you've truly been born again and your
[48:13] life has been buried in Christ, then
[48:16] there is no more sin in you.
[48:20] You're justified as though you never
[48:22] done it in the first place. Now, if we
[48:25] be dead with Christ, we believe that we
[48:27] shall also live with Christ. Amen.
[48:32] Praise God. Listen here. Let's read the
[48:35] quote here from God hiding himself in
[48:37] simplicity.
[48:38] He says, 'Now, we're here on Good Friday
[48:42] and the world today in the Catholic
[48:44] denominations and in many different
[48:45] other denominations, they crawl up the
[48:48] steps and oh, so many different ways
[48:50] that we make traditions and rub bones.
[48:54] And there's some 19 absolutely proven
[48:57] nails that they took out of the hands of
[49:00] Jesus. They claim each church has got
[49:02] one. And what difference does it make
[49:05] whether it's it's the nail or whether
[49:08] it's the cloak or whether it is what we
[49:12] have the Holy Spirit. Amen. That's what
[49:15] Christ left to the church. Not some
[49:19] coat, some piece of the cross, some nail
[49:22] or something. He left us a memorial. And
[49:26] that was the Holy Spirit that he left
[49:29] for the church. Now, now that was what
[49:32] he left to the church. 1900 years ago
[49:35] this afternoon as he died at Calvary, he
[49:38] commended into the hands of God his
[49:41] spirit and it was sent back to the
[49:44] church on the day of Pentecost.
[49:47] Hallelujah. That's what Calvary did for
[49:51] you and me. Hallelujah. When he was
[49:54] there on the cross and he said, "Into
[49:56] thine hands I commit my spirit," he
[50:00] said, "it is finished."
[50:02] When when God says it is finished, sin
[50:06] is finished, unbelief is finished, all
[50:10] the all the the the chains of guilt and
[50:13] shame, all the things that you want to
[50:15] carry, that's your choice. You choose to
[50:18] carry those burdens of sin. You carry
[50:21] you choose to carry those burdens of of,
[50:24] you know, uh scars from the past. That's
[50:26] right. You can be set free from those
[50:29] scars because he said it's finished. I
[50:32] give you my spirit. And my spirit is is
[50:35] life. It is life abundant. Amen. You
[50:39] don't need to stay in that condition.
[50:42] You don't need to stay under that mental
[50:44] oppression. You need to know that he to
[50:47] Listen, if there was anybody that that
[50:49] felt mental oppression, it was Jesus
[50:51] Christ. Amen. He had to deal with the
[50:54] mockery and the shame and the and the
[50:56] and he was bruised. He was he was he was
[51:00] uh he was bruised and and and whipped
[51:03] and and mocked and spit upon and and you
[51:06] want to talk about shame.
[51:09] But he took it all to the cross for you
[51:11] and me. So why do we remain in shame?
[51:15] It's because we have not accepted the
[51:18] blood of Jesus Christ, which is his
[51:20] spirit. We've not allowed him to come
[51:23] and take control and say, "Lord, I give
[51:26] you my life." Like we read in the
[51:29] scripture, if he could lay down his
[51:31] life, why can't we lay down our
[51:34] lives for one another?
[51:37] When that you what that scripture says
[51:39] for one another, it's for those that are
[51:42] still got to come in for our brethren.
[51:46] Because all that the father hath given
[51:48] me, they will come. Amen. Every last one
[51:51] of them's got to come. But it's going to
[51:54] take you to surrender yourself and allow
[51:57] your life to exp to to express the
[52:00] resurrection
[52:01] of Jesus Christ to show that you are the
[52:05] very evidence of his resurrection. That
[52:07] you're the very reason of his death and
[52:11] resurrection. Amen. Praise God. Amen.
[52:14] Hallelujah. And so we don't need to live
[52:16] in shame anymore. Absolutely not. Listen
[52:20] here on from that message that day on
[52:23] Calvary. You know, Brother Tim sent me
[52:26] this uh uh text this morning. He shared
[52:29] this quote with me and I said, I like
[52:30] that. He says, "Now there there's where
[52:33] we lose our
[52:35] position. If we don't watch, we try to
[52:38] look back to what he
[52:41] was. And as long as we look back to what
[52:44] he was, the sacrifice means nothing to
[52:48] us. We can't be going into, oh, happy
[52:51] Good Friday. Oh, good Friday. Blessings
[52:54] to you. Oh, yes. Oh, we, you know, they
[52:57] were they were sacrificing for the last
[53:00] 40 days. They were giving up certain
[53:02] things, you know, out of tradition,
[53:05] not out of a reality of that that he's
[53:09] here now, you know, but you know, he
[53:12] says, but as long as we look back to
[53:14] what he was, the sacrifice means nothing
[53:16] to us. Oh, can't you see it, church?
[53:20] Amen. The congregation says, I would I
[53:22] would not try the job. I can't, and
[53:25] neither can you. There's no need of
[53:27] trying. you're lost to begin with as
[53:31] long as you look to what you've done.
[53:34] But don't look to what what
[53:37] uh as long as you look to what you've
[53:40] done. Look what that day on Calvary did
[53:43] to you. It paid your price. It settled
[53:47] the questions. Your sins be as scarlet.
[53:51] They are as white as snow. Red like
[53:55] crimson, white like wool. then you have
[53:59] no sin. You are perfectly sinless. No
[54:02] matter what you done, now pay attention
[54:05] here. No matter what you done or what
[54:08] you do, oh my glory to God. You don't
[54:12] got a desire to sin.
[54:15] You don't have that desire to go out
[54:17] there and and commit adultery. Those are
[54:20] the spirits and the and the lusts of
[54:22] this world. There you you can't help it.
[54:25] You walk out there and there's there's
[54:26] there's women half naked, you know,
[54:29] walking around. A man can't help
[54:30] himself. He's he's got eyes in in his
[54:33] head.
[54:35] Sure, you you're going to see it. and
[54:37] and the enemy is going to try to put
[54:39] lust into your mind and and you're
[54:41] gonna, you know, and but sometimes we
[54:43] need to understand that this thing here,
[54:47] this thing here, it's your enemy.
[54:50] It's your enemy because it constantly
[54:53] wants to to it's got the nature of the
[54:56] serpent seed. Remember what happened
[54:58] back in the garden in the beginning?
[55:00] Satan injected his nature. when he
[55:03] injected that seed. That's why when the
[55:06] first two children were born, Cain goes
[55:08] and kills his brother, it was a wicked
[55:11] spirit. It's a spirit of lust. It's a
[55:14] it's it's lust of the flesh, lust of the
[55:17] eyes, the pride of life, all of those
[55:20] things. And we get caught sometimes. And
[55:22] that's why he says here, he says, "Then
[55:26] you have no sin." He says, "No matter
[55:29] what you've done or what you do, you're
[55:32] still sinless."
[55:34] Amen. You're going to make mistakes.
[55:36] Repent.
[55:38] And come back to the word of God. Amen.
[55:40] Praise God. Don't stay in that sin.
[55:43] Satan's just sitting there laughing at
[55:46] you, keeping you in a condition because
[55:48] he's got you in a mental condition. And
[55:50] that's why mental health is is the
[55:53] biggest problem that's taking place
[55:55] right now all across the world because
[55:58] Satan has got his ability now that that
[56:02] that he's fully connected when
[56:04] somebody's got a phone in their hand.
[56:07] They go on to uh media, Instagram, they
[56:10] will get fed exactly where wherever
[56:13] their interests are. So if they're
[56:14] having mental health issues, you know
[56:16] what they do? They connect with other
[56:18] people that have health mental health
[56:20] issues and all of a sudden they start to
[56:23] share to one another things that they
[56:26] think are going to help one another to
[56:28] get themselves out of that mental health
[56:30] issue. Yeah, it's a trap.
[56:33] It's a trap. You need to go to the one
[56:36] who can who can take it and place it
[56:39] into the sea of your forgetful of his
[56:41] forgetfulness and your he can wipe it
[56:44] from you. Amen.
[56:47] completely set you free. Amen. No matter
[56:50] what you've done, glory to God. As long
[56:52] as you've accepted Jesus Christ as your
[56:54] savior, savior, your sins are forgiven.
[56:58] Anything is forgiven is remitted and
[57:01] forgot about. Then what does it do? It
[57:05] gives you after that condition, his
[57:09] spirit to follow him and to do as he did
[57:13] for others. who is following on. Do you
[57:18] see now how that scripture how how how
[57:20] you now become a channel of the voice of
[57:26] God by the spirit of God to go and
[57:30] minister to others to share your
[57:32] testimony to see others get set free to
[57:36] allow people to really come into the
[57:38] true meaning of Calvary. Amen. Praise
[57:41] God. for others who is following on. He
[57:44] was just one man, the perfect man. He
[57:47] gave his life and he made an example for
[57:50] you. Now you now what must you do?
[57:55] Glory to God. Amen. Hallelujah. In
[57:59] Galatians 2:20 it says, "I am crucified
[58:03] with
[58:05] Christ. Nevertheless, I live but not I.
[58:10] But Christ liveth in me. And the life
[58:13] which I now live in the flesh, I live by
[58:17] revelation. Amen. By faith of the son of
[58:21] God who loved me and gave himself for
[58:26] me.
[58:27] Amen. We've been crucified with him. And
[58:31] if we've been crucified with him and
[58:33] we've accepted what he did for us, then
[58:36] we are sinless. We are washed. We are
[58:40] cleansed. We are spotless. We are the
[58:43] sons and daughters of God that can start
[58:45] a brand new life from right now. Amen.
[58:49] Amen. Glory to God. Let's go to our next
[58:52] scripture. St. John 14:16.
[58:56] And I will pray the Father, and he shall
[58:58] give you another comforter, that he may
[59:01] abide with you
[59:03] forever, even the Spirit of truth, whom
[59:06] the world cannot receive, because it
[59:09] seeth him not, neither knoweth him, but
[59:12] ye know him, for he dwelleth with you,
[59:16] and shall be in you. I will not leave
[59:19] you comfortless. I will come to you yet
[59:22] a little while, and the world seeth me
[59:24] no more. This was just before he went to
[59:26] Calvary. But you see me because I live,
[59:31] you shall live. He didn't go to die. He
[59:35] went to be resurrected.
[59:38] He went to go and be resurrected so that
[59:41] his spirit could come back down on you
[59:44] and me. That's why Jesus, he was telling
[59:48] his disciples, he was there with them
[59:50] saying, "Hey, listen. I got to go." And
[59:52] they were all sad. I can imagine they
[59:54] were all kind of h why you know how's
[59:57] this going to happen? He says don't
[59:58] worry I'll not leave you comfortless.
[1:00:01] You might be in a condition right now
[1:00:03] but I want you to know there's a
[1:00:04] comforter.
[1:00:06] There's a comforter that can come and
[1:00:08] and and take you out of that condition.
[1:00:10] Amen. And liberate you free from the
[1:00:13] from the condition that that you are in
[1:00:15] right now. Amen. Glory to God. I'll not
[1:00:19] leave you comfortless. I'll be with you
[1:00:21] even in you now. He says here that um in
[1:00:29] uh Christ the mystery of God revealed go
[1:00:32] to the next slide
[1:00:34] there. Yep. It's not expressions of some
[1:00:39] church that we should express something.
[1:00:41] Now what he's meaning here it's not by
[1:00:43] traditions or doctrines of man or some
[1:00:46] church system. No, it's a life that you
[1:00:52] don't live yourself, but he comes in you
[1:00:56] and lives by himself.
[1:01:00] It's not by, oh, we're going to build a
[1:01:02] beautiful church. We're going to design
[1:01:04] all these classrooms. We're gonna we're
[1:01:07] gonna design all these different
[1:01:08] programs and we're gonna get people to
[1:01:11] come into the church and we're gonna
[1:01:13] we're gonna have altar calls and we're
[1:01:15] going to bring the Listen, we're way
[1:01:17] down the road, saints. We're way down
[1:01:20] the road. This is Christ now. He's
[1:01:23] finishing up the work. This is where
[1:01:26] he's bringing his bride into perfection
[1:01:29] because there's going to be a rapture.
[1:01:32] You may not have heard of it, but
[1:01:33] there's going to be a rapture. The
[1:01:35] rapture is the body change. It's the
[1:01:37] it's the dimensional change. They're
[1:01:39] they're already breaking into all kinds
[1:01:41] of things with science where they're
[1:01:42] they're they're they're teleporting
[1:01:44] things and they're tell, you know,
[1:01:46] they're they're trying to tap in. But
[1:01:48] you need to understand as we see science
[1:01:52] grow and become smarter and develop into
[1:01:54] these higher, it's because the word is
[1:01:58] moving into those heights, too. Yeah,
[1:02:01] before they even get there, the word was
[1:02:03] already done. It was finished a long
[1:02:07] time ago. But we've got to go through
[1:02:10] this process in order to bring the last
[1:02:12] one in. Amen. God's looking for that
[1:02:14] last one that's going to be quickened
[1:02:16] into the body of Christ. Amen. That's
[1:02:19] why we become his his voice. We become
[1:02:22] his feet. We become the the the the
[1:02:25] church, the the true church. So here he
[1:02:27] says it's not some program that we
[1:02:30] should try to express but it's the life
[1:02:33] that you don't live yourself but he
[1:02:35] comes in you and lives by himself and
[1:02:37] you become a prisoner to any human
[1:02:40] intellectual being at all. You don't put
[1:02:44] any kind of you know understanding on
[1:02:46] this your own understanding. You're not
[1:02:48] to lean upon your own understanding.
[1:02:52] You're to allow the spirit of God to
[1:02:54] possess you. And you're to yield
[1:02:57] yourself and allow his spirit to take
[1:03:00] control and be led by the spirit. That's
[1:03:03] why he says, "You're led by the spirit."
[1:03:06] Amen. Praise God. And so here he goes.
[1:03:09] And now we'll go to the next quote here.
[1:03:12] He says it in the rising of the sun as
[1:03:15] Christ was the first one to raise from
[1:03:18] all the prophets and so forth. Although
[1:03:20] typed in many places, he was the first
[1:03:24] fruits of those that slept. Amen. So God
[1:03:28] was showing through Christ that there
[1:03:31] would be a resurrection,
[1:03:33] that there is a heaven, that there is an
[1:03:38] eternal life. Yes, he proved it by his
[1:03:41] resurrection and was seen even in some
[1:03:44] of the saints of old, those that were in
[1:03:47] the Old Testament that were waiting on
[1:03:49] Jesus to come and open the prison doors
[1:03:52] and to let them out. They were witnessed
[1:03:55] in Jerusalem on the the at the time of
[1:03:58] the resurrection. Amen. He was the first
[1:04:02] fruits of those that slept in the bride
[1:04:05] coming of Christ. Now we're coming into
[1:04:08] our day. Coming out of the church,
[1:04:12] there'll have to be a sheath waved again
[1:04:14] in the last days.
[1:04:17] We're going to see the the the same
[1:04:19] process that that that Jesus
[1:04:22] did in his first
[1:04:25] resurrection. There will be a repeat of
[1:04:28] that in the bride church calling for the
[1:04:32] resurrection of the church. There had to
[1:04:35] be a wave sheath that would have to come
[1:04:38] in our dispensation
[1:04:41] in order to come to maturity to show
[1:04:44] that that bride could come into the very
[1:04:47] image of Christ.
[1:04:50] do the the same things that he did to ex
[1:04:54] to do greater. He says greater than this
[1:04:57] shall you do when when because there
[1:05:00] would be more of himself being
[1:05:02] expressed. And in and in 1933 to 1965, a
[1:05:08] man by the name of William Marryiam
[1:05:10] Branham was the seventh church age
[1:05:14] messenger
[1:05:15] to the gentile church.
[1:05:19] and his message was to come and to
[1:05:22] restore the word back to the original
[1:05:25] faith so that all the confusion of the
[1:05:29] churches, how do you know which church
[1:05:30] to go to? You've got thousands of
[1:05:33] different denominations out there. So
[1:05:35] God, just like when Jesus came to the
[1:05:38] earth, it was the same problem. They had
[1:05:40] the Sadducees. They had the Pharisees.
[1:05:42] They had all these different
[1:05:44] sects. But they all could not recognize
[1:05:47] when the word was made flesh standing
[1:05:49] before them. They said, "Crucify him."
[1:05:53] They've done the same thing today.
[1:05:56] They have to repeat it. They got to
[1:05:58] crucify the word again. Praise God. But
[1:06:03] the so so here now William Brham comes
[1:06:06] on the scene and he comes to the he's
[1:06:08] the first one to come to maturity of the
[1:06:11] end time church the bride church the the
[1:06:15] the actual church that was going to be
[1:06:18] the church that would be raptured
[1:06:20] there's a lot of churches denominations
[1:06:22] out there talking about rapture talking
[1:06:25] about the resurrection the second
[1:06:27] resurrection the second coming of the
[1:06:29] Lord they've missed the second coming of
[1:06:32] the Lord Lord, he's already come. He
[1:06:35] came in 1963.
[1:06:37] When when that when that when the when
[1:06:39] the earthly angel William Branham, who
[1:06:41] was on the earth at the time, went to
[1:06:43] Sunset Mountain and those seven angels
[1:06:46] appeared, they came right out of that
[1:06:48] other dimension and appeared to him and
[1:06:51] said, "Go back to Jeffersonville. It's
[1:06:53] time for the opening of those seven
[1:06:55] seals." Because those seven seals
[1:06:58] contained the names of every single son
[1:07:01] and daughter of God that would have to
[1:07:04] be called in this time.
[1:07:07] It contained the names of the church.
[1:07:11] That would be called. How do you know
[1:07:13] that you're a part of that church? When
[1:07:15] you hear that message. When those seals
[1:07:17] get a hold of you. When all of a sudden
[1:07:19] you get caught. God sent a prophet. I
[1:07:23] remember God didn't pull me in by that.
[1:07:27] God drew me in by his love. God per when
[1:07:31] I realized I was a sinner and I needed
[1:07:33] to be cleansed. I I needed to go to the
[1:07:35] waters of baptism. I went to those
[1:07:37] waters of B. It wasn't for months later
[1:07:40] that God opened my understanding because
[1:07:42] he said, "I'll send you the comforter
[1:07:45] which is the Holy Ghost." And that's
[1:07:47] what happens when you repent and receive
[1:07:50] Christ and and and and repent and and
[1:07:53] receive the Holy Ghost. It's the
[1:07:54] comforter. And he said, "He will guide
[1:07:57] you into all truth." So with the Holy
[1:08:00] Ghost, there was nowhere else that I
[1:08:02] could go but to the truth because I was
[1:08:05] being led by the spirit. And that's
[1:08:07] exactly what'll happen to every son and
[1:08:09] daughter of God. He's the same
[1:08:11] yesterday, today, and forever. He
[1:08:13] doesn't change. You'll see a new birth.
[1:08:16] you'll know that it's a real birth.
[1:08:18] Because it'll take them right to the
[1:08:19] word. Hallelujah. And then when they see
[1:08:21] Malachi 4, that that behold, I send unto
[1:08:25] you Elijah the prophet, they're going to
[1:08:27] do their research and they're going to
[1:08:28] see it as plain as day. It's right there
[1:08:30] in the scripture. And then they're going
[1:08:32] to see the opening of those seven seals
[1:08:34] and how important they were. That's why
[1:08:37] we're preaching tonight.
[1:08:39] That's why we've got a message. We'd
[1:08:42] have nothing. We'd be just another lodge
[1:08:44] if we didn't have those seals. We'd just
[1:08:46] be another church, just another church
[1:08:49] on a corner saying, "Oh, well, you know,
[1:08:51] I'd like to bring my children to church
[1:08:52] and put them into Sunday school, and you
[1:08:54] know, I think it's a good idea." Sure,
[1:08:56] it's a good idea. You want to train up
[1:08:58] your children in the way of the Lord,
[1:08:59] but God is looking for his attributes
[1:09:03] because we're at the end time. This is
[1:09:05] when the rapture is going to go. God's
[1:09:07] interested in bringing his elect,
[1:09:10] bringing them into that capstone because
[1:09:12] that capstone is the only ship that's
[1:09:14] going to go. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:09:18] And so, William Branham, the seventh
[1:09:22] messenger of the seven church ages. And
[1:09:26] even you can you can do a study on on
[1:09:29] the seven church ages and you'll see
[1:09:31] that Martin Luther uh yeah, Martin
[1:09:33] Luther was one of the um messengers.
[1:09:36] Then you'll see John Wesley was one of
[1:09:38] the messengers. You can go back and see
[1:09:41] Iranius. And you know who the first
[1:09:42] messenger was? The apostle Paul.
[1:09:46] He was to the first church age to the
[1:09:48] Ephesian church age. Amen. Praise God.
[1:09:51] And the last church age messenger to the
[1:09:54] Leodysian church age. Read it in
[1:09:56] Revelations chapter 3. The Leodysian
[1:10:00] church age. The messenger was William
[1:10:03] Miriam Branham.
[1:10:05] Go do a study on him. You will come to
[1:10:08] realize that it wasn't it's not just
[1:10:11] some teaching or some it's from the
[1:10:13] word. Take the Bible, put it here. Take
[1:10:16] your Google, put it there, and then do
[1:10:18] your research and start to see if the
[1:10:21] word doesn't line up with the word.
[1:10:23] Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. All that
[1:10:25] he said. That's why we use his quotes is
[1:10:28] because he was the first wave sheath
[1:10:31] that came into a a a divine revelation
[1:10:34] where the spirit of God possessed him.
[1:10:37] And that's why it's called the voice of
[1:10:39] God. He was not God.
[1:10:43] But he was an attribute of God. Yeah.
[1:10:46] And then as we go as we as we mature,
[1:10:48] then you can then you can
[1:10:50] say he's God. But not in the way that
[1:10:54] you could say he's God because I'm going
[1:10:57] to say the same thing about you. Because
[1:10:59] if the spirit of of Christ is in you and
[1:11:03] you've received his spirit and he says
[1:11:05] on that day he shall know that I am in
[1:11:07] the father ye in me and I in you. How
[1:11:10] can God have fellowship with anything
[1:11:13] other than God?
[1:11:17] You're just a a a messiah.
[1:11:20] You're you're you know, listen, I I'm a
[1:11:22] father. I bring forth children.
[1:11:25] They come forth from me. They're my
[1:11:28] children.
[1:11:29] So, human beings bring forth human
[1:11:31] beings. Well, when Adam was in the
[1:11:34] garden, all he had to do was look at Eve
[1:11:36] and say, just like the angel went to
[1:11:38] Mary, Just like the angel went to Mary
[1:11:41] and said, "Mary, you're blessed. You're
[1:11:44] blessed amongst all women because you're
[1:11:47] going to be the choice that God is going
[1:11:49] to express this great plan of redemption
[1:11:51] through. He's going to show that that
[1:11:54] there's a faith in you that you're going
[1:11:56] to be able to receive his word in your
[1:11:58] body and you're going to bring forth
[1:12:01] Emmanuel. You're going to bring forth
[1:12:03] God."
[1:12:05] She had nothing to do with the egg. She
[1:12:08] had nothing to do with the seed. It was
[1:12:10] just God. And Adam, all he had to do was
[1:12:13] go and say, "Eve, you are so
[1:12:16] beautiful. Bring
[1:12:19] forth
[1:12:21] Jennifer because Danny is waiting for
[1:12:24] her."
[1:12:27] Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:12:30] That's your new birth. That's why you
[1:12:34] can't identify with the churches
[1:12:36] anymore. You know you're a speckled
[1:12:38] bird. You know that you're different.
[1:12:41] Why? Because you're a supernatural
[1:12:43] bornagain attribute of God that's been
[1:12:46] birthed by the word,
[1:12:49] not by a natural birth anymore. The the
[1:12:52] natural birth dies. It gets buried. It
[1:12:57] gets left behind. That's why when we go
[1:12:59] in the rapture, we're going to be
[1:13:00] changed in a moment and in the twinkling
[1:13:02] of an eye. Hallelujah. So, William
[1:13:06] Brandham came to that full maturity as
[1:13:08] the first wave sheath to the bride
[1:13:11] church. Amen. Amen. And that's why we
[1:13:14] are we are the the ones now that are
[1:13:16] that are coming into that fullness of
[1:13:20] the word recognizing that we are the
[1:13:22] ones that were literally being called
[1:13:25] through the message and through the
[1:13:27] opening of those seals. There's too much
[1:13:29] to try and get into all of that. Amen.
[1:13:31] But here he says, he says in the bride
[1:13:34] coming of Christ coming out of the
[1:13:36] church there'll have to be a a sheath
[1:13:38] waved again in the last days. Oh my
[1:13:41] waving of the sheath. What was the
[1:13:43] sheath? The first one that come to
[1:13:45] mature. The first one that provided it
[1:13:48] was a wheat that proved it was a sheath.
[1:13:51] Hallelujah. I'm sure you see what I'm
[1:13:54] talking about. It was waved over the
[1:13:57] people. Go to the next slide. He
[1:14:00] continues, "And the first time there
[1:14:02] will come forth for the bride age,
[1:14:06] for a resurrection out of dark
[1:14:10] denominationalism, will be a message."
[1:14:13] This message,
[1:14:15] this message, this message is the
[1:14:18] message that calls a church, a bride,
[1:14:21] out of the church.
[1:14:24] It's not out of the world. It's now a
[1:14:28] church out of the church and it's and
[1:14:30] it's honing down where to now, you know,
[1:14:34] it's it's not it's not out of the
[1:14:36] Pentecostals.
[1:14:37] If there are attributes of God still
[1:14:40] left in there and they hear this
[1:14:41] message, they're going to come
[1:14:44] because that see Jesus said, "My sheep
[1:14:46] hear my voice. No other will they
[1:14:49] follow. They you won't be able to help
[1:14:51] it. Trust me when it happens you that
[1:14:54] voice that word that o that that that
[1:14:57] inspiration that'll come on you you will
[1:14:59] not be able to to go anywhere else. You
[1:15:02] you you eagles they eat fresh food and
[1:15:06] the only thing that will satisfy you as
[1:15:08] a son or daughter of God will be fresh
[1:15:11] revelation coming directly from God to
[1:15:14] you directly personal
[1:15:17] personal. Amen. He says the first time
[1:15:20] he says for a resurrection out of dark
[1:15:23] denominationalism because back in in
[1:15:26] 1965 the denominations were just
[1:15:28] starting to flourish like crazy
[1:15:30] especially the Pentecostal
[1:15:31] denominations.
[1:15:33] But a message is going to come out of
[1:15:35] that that will that that the full
[1:15:38] maturity of the word has turned back
[1:15:41] again in its full power back to Christ
[1:15:45] in the fullness of the word and being
[1:15:48] waved over the people by the same signs
[1:15:51] and wonders that he did back there. He
[1:15:55] says, "Because I live, you live also."
[1:16:00] Speaking to his wife,
[1:16:03] Hallelujah. Because I live, you live
[1:16:06] also. What a resurrection that was. And
[1:16:09] what a resurrection this is. To be
[1:16:13] quickened from the dead to be made alive
[1:16:15] in Christ Jesus by God's quickening
[1:16:19] power.
[1:16:21] Glory to God. Amen. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:16:26] Hallelujah. We're winding down
[1:16:29] now. Amen. So we are the
[1:16:33] carriers of the
[1:16:36] victory of Good Friday. Good Friday was
[1:16:40] victory day.
[1:16:43] Don't you be going and getting all, you
[1:16:46] know, trying to relive the suffering and
[1:16:49] everything else. It's enough that you're
[1:16:52] suffering and you're dealing with the
[1:16:54] reproach that comes with with with with
[1:16:57] standing on this word, having the
[1:16:59] courage and the confidence to be able to
[1:17:01] stand on this word and say, "I believe
[1:17:04] that the word has progressed and I'm in
[1:17:07] I'm I'm under the present truth of the
[1:17:10] ministry of Jesus Christ." Amen. It's
[1:17:12] enough to have to deal with that and the
[1:17:14] oppression that you go through every
[1:17:17] single day when the enemy tries to fight
[1:17:19] you and and the battles that you've got
[1:17:21] to deal with every day. Those great
[1:17:23] battles in your mind.
[1:17:26] Amen. But see it for what it really is.
[1:17:30] That it's about the resurrection and
[1:17:32] it's about the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:34] that's been made available to us to
[1:17:37] overcome anything that comes our way.
[1:17:40] Because for the enemy to get to to us,
[1:17:43] he's got to get through Jesus Christ,
[1:17:45] the spirit of God that's in you.
[1:17:49] He's got to get through that. And he'll
[1:17:52] never do it. It's impossible.
[1:17:55] He'd have to be born again to get into
[1:17:58] that place. You're sealed into that
[1:18:01] capstone of love. His love has sealed
[1:18:04] you in. And there's nothing that can can
[1:18:07] seal you out. He, the scripture says,
[1:18:09] "Grieve not the Holy Ghost, the Holy
[1:18:12] Spirit, whereby you are sealed
[1:18:15] until the day of your rapture."
[1:18:20] You're sealed until that day. Don't
[1:18:22] worry about the enemy. Just do what you
[1:18:24] know you're supposed to do. Live for
[1:18:26] Christ. Amen. Glory to God. He says
[1:18:29] here, listen, um, uh, you know, he says,
[1:18:32] "Oh, if I could get the world to see
[1:18:34] that, why, there you are. There is the
[1:18:37] body of Christ living, standing,
[1:18:40] redeemed, redeemed. Oh my, justified in
[1:18:44] his sight. Why are we
[1:18:47] justified? We are his victory.
[1:18:50] The church is his victory. We come forth
[1:18:54] in this last days with this glorious
[1:18:56] gospel showing his victory. He died for
[1:19:01] this purpose and we are proof of his
[1:19:04] victory. It's victory day, saints. Amen.
[1:19:08] When we see his when we see him coming
[1:19:10] down and living among the church, that's
[1:19:13] his victory. Shows that he couldn't be
[1:19:15] kept in the grave. Neither can they keep
[1:19:18] us. Oh no, sir. You're not going to
[1:19:22] convert a an attribute of God. It's like
[1:19:25] trying to convert God himself. You're
[1:19:27] not going to do it. How can the creation
[1:19:30] tell the creator how it's going to be?
[1:19:34] It ain't going to work. Amen. Glory to
[1:19:36] God. That's right. Amen. He says, he
[1:19:39] says, uh, and we're already potentially
[1:19:43] risen because we've raised from the dead
[1:19:47] unbelief of his word, from
[1:19:49] denominational creeds and so forth to an
[1:19:53] eternal word of the eternal God, which
[1:19:57] is
[1:19:58] him,
[1:19:59] himself, working through us, manifesting
[1:20:03] himself, that he is the same yesterday,
[1:20:06] today, and forever. Hallelujah. Notice
[1:20:11] the vindicated word in his body is the
[1:20:15] very victory and the reason for his
[1:20:18] death. the very evidence that we're
[1:20:20] standing here and we're preaching this
[1:20:22] message, this revelation that he's come
[1:20:26] to redeem and to and to take back his
[1:20:30] his bride, to redeem his bride out of
[1:20:33] this church mess, all the mess that's
[1:20:36] going on in the churches in this age
[1:20:38] right now. That's the very evidence of
[1:20:41] his victory that we can that we can
[1:20:44] stand here and and preach the word for
[1:20:47] our day and for for this hour. Amen.
[1:20:50] Notice the very message of the gospel
[1:20:53] itself is to prove to the people that he
[1:20:56] is risen.
[1:20:58] That's the purpose of this message of
[1:21:01] this hour. Amen. God, go tell my
[1:21:04] disciples that I am risen from the dead
[1:21:06] and I'll meet with them to confirm this
[1:21:09] to them. Oh God, how in this last day
[1:21:11] there shall be light again across the
[1:21:14] earth and I'll prove to my disciples, go
[1:21:17] tell them that I'm not dead. You need to
[1:21:20] tell the people, listen, oh Jesus died
[1:21:22] today. No, he's risen.
[1:21:24] He's not dead. He's alive. And I'm the
[1:21:28] very evidence that he's alive. Amen.
[1:21:30] Because because I am a I am a living
[1:21:34] Christ. I'll meet them. Take this
[1:21:37] message to my disciples and I am risen
[1:21:39] from the dead. The gospel good news.
[1:21:41] Amen. Hebrews 13:8. He's the same
[1:21:44] yesterday, today, and forever. And we,
[1:21:47] his
[1:21:49] beneficiaries, are to prove his life is
[1:21:52] in us now.
[1:21:55] Amen. He uh the beneficiaries of his
[1:21:58] life, the life there never was a life
[1:22:02] lived like it. He was the son of God and
[1:22:04] he died and that shut it out. And when
[1:22:07] he raised again from the dead on Easter
[1:22:10] morning, then we as his servants are
[1:22:13] commissioned by him to go into all the
[1:22:16] world and bring the good news to every
[1:22:20] person that he is alive.
[1:22:24] Glory to God. And how can you do it? By
[1:22:27] the word only. For it is written, the
[1:22:31] gospel came not by word only, but
[1:22:34] through the power of the
[1:22:36] manifestation of the Holy Spirit to
[1:22:39] prove he is alive.
[1:22:43] Amen. And our last scripture is
[1:22:46] Ephesians chapter 2. Saints, this is by
[1:22:50] the grace of God.
[1:22:54] We are
[1:22:56] saved through faith and that not of
[1:23:00] yourselves. It is God's gift to you.
[1:23:04] Thank you, Lord. Amen. Receive the gift
[1:23:07] of the resurrection.
[1:23:09] Amen. At this time, we're going to
[1:23:12] change the order of the
[1:23:13] service. Glory to God.
[1:23:17] Let the
[1:23:22] deacons ah okay, brother Christopher.
[1:23:25] Amen. Praise
[1:23:27] God. Let us pray then. Let us as we
[1:23:31] change the order of the service.
[1:23:34] Father Lord, you are a living God.
[1:23:37] You're present among us tonight. Lord,
[1:23:39] my heart burns within me. Oh God, I know
[1:23:42] that this is real. There's nothing more
[1:23:44] real than this word that you've
[1:23:47] provided that you
[1:23:49] yourself will interpret. You yourself
[1:23:54] will vindicate in the lives of your
[1:23:57] children. You will prove to this world
[1:24:00] that there is a people that
[1:24:03] have benefited and have recognized the
[1:24:08] resurrection and that it is their
[1:24:11] victory. It's their victory
[1:24:14] cry. Oh God, thank you Lord Jesus for
[1:24:19] allowing us, Lord, the the grace to to
[1:24:22] to just be one of those that you held in
[1:24:28] your hand, Lord. You said, "Not one of
[1:24:29] them will be
[1:24:31] lost." You wrote their names in the
[1:24:34] Lamb's Book of Life from before the
[1:24:36] foundations of the world. It wasn't even
[1:24:38] It wasn't even here, Lord. It wasn't
[1:24:41] because we we repented or it was wasn't
[1:24:44] because we came to an altar call. It was
[1:24:46] because of a supernatural call. It was
[1:24:50] because you saw every son
[1:25:50] In
[1:25:51] John 6 verse
[1:25:54] 32-35 it says then Jesus said unto them
[1:25:57] verily verily I say unto you Moses gave
[1:26:00] you not that bread from heaven but my
[1:26:04] father giveth you the true bread from
[1:26:07] heaven for the bread of God is he which
[1:26:10] cometh down from heaven and giveth life
[1:26:14] unto the
[1:26:15] world. Then said they unto him, Lord,
[1:26:18] ever more give us this bread. And Jesus
[1:26:22] said unto them, I am the bread of
[1:26:27] life. He that cometh to me shall never
[1:26:30] hunger, and he that believeth on me
[1:26:33] shall never
[1:26:35] thirst. Glory to God. Amen. In 1
[1:26:38] Corinthians chapter 10 verse 17 it says,
[1:26:42] "For we being many are one
[1:26:46] bread." Saints, "The Lord's supper means
[1:26:48] something completely different to
[1:26:51] me more than
[1:26:53] ever. This Lord's supper means something
[1:26:56] completely so much
[1:26:59] more. We are we are a part of him." He
[1:27:04] said, "I am that bread of life." And now
[1:27:06] here he says, "For we being many are one
[1:27:09] bread and one body, for we are all
[1:27:12] partakers of that one
[1:27:14] bread because we are the body of
[1:27:17] Christ. This Lord's supper should mean
[1:27:20] more to you after knowing that that his
[1:27:22] resurrection and his spirit by him
[1:27:25] giving his life to you, you become a
[1:27:28] part of him." And when we feed on the
[1:27:31] one bread, we're feeding on the body of
[1:27:34] Christ. We're edifying. We're
[1:27:36] nourishing. We're we're we're drinking
[1:27:38] the wine together by by the stimulation
[1:27:41] of the revelation that he's given us in
[1:27:44] his word. We are partakers of that wine
[1:27:47] because it is his spirit. It's not
[1:27:49] literal wine. This wine is not the
[1:27:52] literal blood of Jesus Christ. Remember,
[1:27:55] we're doing this in remembrance, but
[1:27:58] it's more than remembrance. Now, I don't
[1:28:00] know about you, but this is a reality.
[1:28:03] This is more than just remembering him.
[1:28:05] This is him in our midst and we're
[1:28:09] partaking of that one body which is his
[1:28:12] body and we become a part of that body
[1:28:16] and we edify, we nourish, we strengthen
[1:28:19] one
[1:28:21] another. This is when a family comes
[1:28:24] together and has supper together. When
[1:28:27] Jesus was there with them, he was
[1:28:30] fellowshipping with them. He was talking
[1:28:32] with them. He was letting them know that
[1:28:34] that that he would be doing this again
[1:28:37] with
[1:28:38] them. And we're already partaking of
[1:28:41] that
[1:28:42] time because you've already been
[1:28:45] resurrected. You've been called out of
[1:28:47] the world. The Bible the the Bible says
[1:28:50] that one will be taken, one will be
[1:28:53] left. Well, it's already happening.
[1:28:56] Families that you know because God
[1:28:58] doesn't call families. God calls his
[1:29:01] sons and his daughters. God doesn't call
[1:29:05] grandchildren. He doesn't have
[1:29:07] grandchildren. He's got sons and
[1:29:10] daughters. And that's why it, you know,
[1:29:13] we bear the reproach for this
[1:29:16] word. Just like the disciples bore the
[1:29:19] reproach for the word when they walked
[1:29:22] with
[1:29:24] him. Amen. Glory to God.
[1:29:27] In 1 Corinthians chapter 10 verse1 17 it
[1:29:30] says and when he had given thanks he
[1:29:35] broke it and said take eat this is my
[1:29:40] body which is broken for you do this do
[1:29:45] in remembrance of
[1:29:48] me. Tim would you pray for the bread?
[1:29:57] for the bread of life.
[1:29:59] Lord, we hold in our hands here, Father,
[1:30:03] natural bread, Lord, that we pray that
[1:30:06] you would bless and
[1:30:07] sanctify. But even greater than that,
[1:30:09] Lord, the bread of life,
[1:30:12] Father. Lord, every day we eat the bread
[1:30:17] of life, the word of God. Today we have
[1:30:20] listened and we have fed off of your
[1:30:24] body, Lord, the word of God, Lord. Every
[1:30:27] single day you allow us to feed off of
[1:30:29] that word of God, Lord, and we become
[1:30:32] one with that word, Lord. Tonight we are
[1:30:35] so grateful, Lord, that that body was
[1:30:38] bruised, was striped, Lord God, was
[1:30:43] buried, and rose again for our
[1:30:45] justification, Lord. Lord, that we can
[1:30:48] come every day and receive revelation
[1:30:51] from that word of God. Lord, that is
[1:30:53] changing and transforming us. Lord, we
[1:30:56] are not creatures of this earth. We are
[1:30:59] eternal, Father, because of the word of
[1:31:01] God. So, we pray as each and everyone
[1:31:04] would take this natural bread. Father,
[1:31:07] may the revelation of the word of God
[1:31:09] open up into the hearts, Lord. And if
[1:31:12] there be any seed of God that has not
[1:31:14] been awakened, Lord, may it come alive,
[1:31:16] Father. Lord, we just commit this into
[1:31:19] your hands now. And each one heal, set
[1:31:23] free, and deliver, Lord, in the name of
[1:31:25] Jesus Christ, we
[1:31:28] pray.
[1:31:30] Amen. Praise God. And after the same
[1:31:33] manner also he took the cup and when he
[1:31:36] had sucked, saying, "This cup is the new
[1:31:39] testament in my blood." It's a new
[1:31:42] covenant. Testament is a
[1:31:44] covenant. It's a brand new covenant.
[1:31:47] He's he's he's restored all
[1:31:50] things. This do ye as often as ye drink
[1:31:54] it in remembrance of
[1:31:57] me. Chris, would you pray for the wine?
[1:32:01] Oh gracious, dear loving heavenly
[1:32:04] father, thank you Lord for this time
[1:32:07] Lord that we can spend as a family in
[1:32:11] communion Lord. Father Lord we thank you
[1:32:14] Lord for this wine which represent your
[1:32:18] shed blood Lord say without the shedding
[1:32:21] of blood there is no remission for sin
[1:32:25] Lord. And I thank you, Lord, that we
[1:32:28] have experienced your forgiveness, Lord.
[1:32:32] Father, what you did 2,000 years ago,
[1:32:35] Lord, Father, we can experience that
[1:32:38] same thing right now, Lord. Father, may
[1:32:42] Oh God, as this wine, Lord, has a
[1:32:44] natural effect of stimulation, Lord. Oh
[1:32:48] God, which represents revelation, Lord,
[1:32:51] Father, may the stimulation of your
[1:32:54] revelation, Lord, go deep within our
[1:32:57] souls, Lord Father. Lord, and may it, oh
[1:33:00] God, continue, Lord, to pour out amongst
[1:33:03] us, Lord, Father, the evidence of your
[1:33:06] revelation, Lord, Father. I ask Lord
[1:33:08] that you bless this wine, sanctify it as
[1:33:11] we partake, Lord, Father, in Jesus name
[1:33:14] we pray. Amen.
[1:33:18] Amen. Praise
[1:33:21] God. This time we
[1:33:25] will
[1:33:27] ask the
[1:33:29] brothers, get some other deacons and
[1:33:32] start distributing the bread and the
[1:33:35] wine at the same time
[1:33:39] quickly. And they can put on some music,
[1:33:42] please.
[1:34:11] [Music]
[1:34:20] [Music]
[1:34:37] [Music]
[1:35:13] [Music]
[1:35:56] [Music]
[1:36:32] [Music]
[1:37:22] [Music]
[1:37:49] [Music]
[1:37:58] [Music]
[1:38:29] [Music]
[1:38:46] [Music]
[1:38:52] [Music]
[1:39:09] I trust that you've examined your heart.
[1:39:14] You said, "Lord, if there's anything in
[1:39:20] me, the blood of Christ, I claim
[1:39:24] it. Make me
[1:39:27] whole." Because we want to take the
[1:39:29] Lord's supper with a sincere heart,
[1:39:34] understanding, and right relationship
[1:39:37] with the Lord. This is not a tradition.
[1:39:40] This is not some supernatural It's just
[1:39:43] bread and this is just
[1:39:45] wine. But the relationship is spiritual.
[1:39:50] It's
[1:39:51] supernatural. And that is what pleases
[1:39:54] the Lord is that faith that you have in
[1:39:58] your heart for
[1:39:59] him. Let's partake of the bread and the
[1:40:02] wine together.
[1:40:48] I don't know about you, but I
[1:40:51] was I was picturing myself right there
[1:40:53] at the supper table with the Lord.
[1:40:57] just having fellowship with the family
[1:40:59] of
[1:41:00] God, partaking of the bread and the wine
[1:41:04] together as they
[1:41:06] did over and over again
[1:41:11] together. It was a love
[1:41:15] relationship. Truly remarkable, saints.
[1:41:18] And we can experience that same
[1:41:20] relationship
[1:41:23] today with one another in the body of
[1:41:29] Christ. At this time, we're going to be
[1:41:32] um going to the foot
[1:41:34] washing. And um I just wanted to uh
[1:41:38] share a few thoughts for the sisters in
[1:41:41] the way that we do the footwashing here
[1:41:44] in the sanctuary. I just share it in the
[1:41:46] way that we do it that maybe it'll help
[1:41:50] you to
[1:41:51] um go through the process
[1:41:55] uh simplified. Amen. And what we do is,
[1:41:58] you know, we set up a few buckets,
[1:42:01] usually around three or four,
[1:42:05] and you choose a partner as the Lord
[1:42:09] would lead
[1:42:11] you or somebody might come to you and
[1:42:16] just know that you're in the body
[1:42:18] together. Don't be looking for oh this
[1:42:21] one or that one or you know just let the
[1:42:24] spirit stay under that anointing and
[1:42:27] allow the Holy Spirit to just lead you
[1:42:29] to that individual lead to each other
[1:42:34] and then wash each other's feet. So then
[1:42:36] what would happen is you would sit
[1:42:39] down and the sister that's praying and
[1:42:42] washing the sister's feet will pray for
[1:42:45] that sister. the other sisters that are
[1:42:49] not being washed and have not yet
[1:42:53] because there's only so many
[1:42:55] buckets, go over, lay hands on the
[1:42:59] sister that's being prayed for and pray
[1:43:01] with the one that's praying for her and
[1:43:04] keep it within a minute to two minutes
[1:43:07] maximum. You don't have to be sitting
[1:43:08] there and praying about their whole life
[1:43:11] from when they were born until they
[1:43:13] leave in the rapture.
[1:43:16] just pray for them that the Lord will
[1:43:18] bless them and prosper them and and you
[1:43:20] know uh uh just provide whatever is in
[1:43:24] their heart and and sincerely pray for
[1:43:26] them quickly and within a minute to a
[1:43:29] you know to a minute and a half you
[1:43:30] should be done and and then just move
[1:43:34] through it through prayers quickly and
[1:43:36] you you it should not take long. You
[1:43:39] should be praying for another sister,
[1:43:42] not standing and having fellowship and
[1:43:45] causing any kind of a
[1:43:48] distraction. You need to be all together
[1:43:50] in an atmosphere of prayer. We are a
[1:43:53] family and we pray one for the other.
[1:43:56] Amen. Praise God. Is that clear? All
[1:44:00] right. So, at this time, we're going to
[1:44:02] have a closing word of prayer. I'm gonna
[1:44:04] ask brother Christopher to close us in
[1:44:06] prayer
[1:44:07] tonight and then after we're done with
[1:44:09] the foot washing
[1:44:11] everybody, you are dismissed to go.
[1:44:25] Let's bow our heads.
[1:44:27] Let's just bow our hearts.
[1:44:29] Gracious dear loving kind heavenly
[1:44:33] father just thank you Lord for this time
[1:44:36] Lord that was spent in your presence
[1:44:39] Lord
[1:44:41] Father Lord just reminding us of what
[1:44:45] you did for us even before the
[1:44:50] foundations of the world Lord
[1:44:52] Father and we thank you Lord that you
[1:44:56] have shed your blood for us paid the
[1:44:59] penalty and price, Lord, to bring us
[1:45:02] back into fellowship with you in true
[1:45:06] love and in harmony,
[1:45:08] Lord. Lord, we just thank you, Lord, for
[1:45:10] the saints gathered here today, Lord.
[1:45:13] Father, even those that are online,
[1:45:16] Lord, if there be anyone that needs a
[1:45:19] touch from you, Lord, Father, Lord, you
[1:45:22] said when you said it's finished, Lord,
[1:45:24] Father, you paid the price for every
[1:45:28] single thing that we have need of in
[1:45:31] this walk in life, Lord, in this earth,
[1:45:34] Lord. Whether it be healing, Lord,
[1:45:37] Father, salvation for the soul, Lord,
[1:45:39] Father, may be, oh God, some financial
[1:45:43] need, Lord, Father. Oh God, may you
[1:45:46] minister to them tonight, Lord, Father,
[1:45:49] and let it be done, Lord, according to
[1:45:51] your great plan and purpose for each
[1:45:54] individual, Lord. Lord, as we, oh God,
[1:45:57] just continue to remember you, Lord.
[1:46:01] Father, may your spirit go with us,
[1:46:03] Lord, and bring us back again, Lord, and
[1:46:07] even on Sunday, Lord, rejoicing and
[1:46:10] thanking you, Lord, for all your many,
[1:46:13] many blessings, Lord. Father, Lord
[1:46:16] Jesus, we commit each individual here
[1:46:18] into your tender loving care as we, oh
[1:46:21] God, depart from this building, but not
[1:46:24] from your presence. Lord let your love
[1:46:27] continue to flow amongst us. This we ask
[1:46:31] in Jesus name. Amen. And
[1:46:39] amen. Dismissed.
