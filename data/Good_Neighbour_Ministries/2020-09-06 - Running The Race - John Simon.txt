TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good sunday morning praise god hallelujah it's good to be together again giving praise and honor to him i'm so sorry but we do not have our time of fellowship or worship because of our coveted restrictions but nevertheless we are here to praise god and give him glory by the preaching of the word may the holy spirit bless anoint and give us spiritual growth as we place our hearts and our thoughts upon the word of god let us pray our gracious heavenly father we ask for your divine blessing upon the word of god today may you bless and anoint your people as we sent forth the word in light and truth may the great holy spirit be glorified may your word be magnified may your name be uplifted and may the truth of god go forth father wherever you wanted to find a nest a resting place a heart to mind a soul ordained by you from before the foundations of the world may the holy spirit father find that resting place and may the dove of peace rest in peace in the presence of god to you be all the glory and the praise in the name of jesus christ our lord amen and amen well today i would like for us to talk about the human race we'd like to talk about this race spoken of in hebrews chapter 12 verses 1 to 3. it speaks of this human race it may be called the race the glory the race to heaven lice race it may be called by many different descriptions but i would like to approach it today from the point of view of finishers finishers as the old song says oh there were many that started in the race and with the word with the lord jesus they fail to keep peace others accept it because it is new oh but i've started out with jesus and i am going through i trust that you are too as we read from god's word from the book of hebrews chapter 12 verses 1 to 3 wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which dot so easily beset us and let us run let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking onto jesus the author and finisher of our faith for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest you be weary and faint in your minds now we realize that our entire life whether we a christian non-christian whatever we are claiming that we are the bible tells us clearly that we are all engaged in the human race because from birth until death we are in the race a race to the rapture we are engaged in this race that we might gain the crown of eternal life it really doesn't matter who you are it doesn't matter friends how great and wonderful your achievements may be it doesn't matter what victories you have what uh what great certificates diplomas that you may have to decorate your office wall it really does not matter your successes doesn't matter your prosperity doesn't matter whatsoever you might have done that during your entire lifetime but it will all be in vain if your soul is cast into other darkness cast into the pits of hell away from god the joy of god the peace of god the life the love of god and the people of god and you are cast away forever then all you have accomplished and all you have done will be for not for we are all engaged in this human race that we are in and will be cast aside because of our own spiritual blindness or our own spiritual ignorance to god and his word this gospel must be preached into all the world and then shall the end come so to come to a revelation of this gospel is the most important thing in our life to grasp the word of god to recognize your day and the message for your day is the most important thing that we are here make no mistake about it my friends we are in a race against time whether we be sinner or saint king or commoner whether we be professor or whether we just be a possessor or an ordinary person within the street my friends we are all in this race together and we must race against time above all else we must use the time we have here on earth to be able to know jesus christ to know the reality of his word you may not think that is important but when you come to the end of your way you will find that that is the most essential and important thing in your entire existence to know him is to know life eternal to know him is to enter into life's joys and life's inheritance now a certain olympic runner and i'm quoting from george macdonald rebuilding your broken world in this he said an olympic runner distance runner who was also a a missionary in the work of god he wrote to a friend who was experiencing a personal crisis some personal disaster maybe you are uh involved in a personal disaster a personal crisis or some major challenge in your life now he said in this race that i was running i suddenly hit a branch the branch of a tree and the blow almost knocked me out it knocked me out of the race and almost knocked me cold but somehow i staggered back to the track and i stumbled on i remember one thing clear in the conclusion as i was staggering one thought stuck in my mind i must not lay down i must not give up i must keep on i must keep going even if i come in long and far behind the others but i must finish the race not only must i start it but i must finish this race i must not quit i must keep going and he said and i kept going and to my surprise when i came to the end i won the race with every difficulty with the blow with the setback i must keep on going god will lead us always to the same results my friend my brothers my sisters no matter what you may be going through in this very moment i am putting it to you right now that our god is able and no matter if you've been knocked down the devil has tried to knock you out but you must press on keep on going say lord i'm pressing on the upward way new heights i'm gaining every day still praying as i'm onward bound lord plant my feet on higher ground yes let us remember very much the thought in which he said we must keep on it absolutely captures paul's thought here on this race that god has given to us that we must run hebrews 12 1 paul says let us run with patience or perseverance the race that is marked out for us listen this is a race that is marked out for you your footsteps are ordained or ordered by the lord god knows the mistakes god knows the test god knows the trials god knows what you are going through even right now the holy spirit is aware and knows what it is that you are going through now my friends the only way that you can do the right kind of job for the lord is to put your everything behind what you are doing for him put all your strength all your soul all your heart all your mind put your everything in it if you're a christian do you want to be a real christian or are you just having a sham of a christianity which if it is searched out will be found that you are partially fake may god help every one of us to do everything within our hearts within our souls to be real believers that will hold to god's unchanging hand and not the things of this world they are there for us god will bless us if we are faithful to him but let our eyes be upon the lord jesus christ when you're going to do anything whether it be for god or man do it right do it in the right way put everything leave everything else alone and if you're going to be a christian put everything you have in it to live a life for jesus christ put your time put your talents put your everything in it my friends whether it you whether you're playing a guitar whether you're strumming some instrument whether you're blowing a saxophone or a flute whatever it is put all your wisdom all your talent in it and use it for the glory of god and god will help you god will straighten you no matter what you think you may not be the best talent you may not be the best of anything but in god's eyes when you do it with your sincerity with your heart with your soul behind it all then he is with you and for you amen and amen and he gives all praise and honor and glory to those who stand for him no matter what it is if you know how to whistle then whistle for his glory and honor justify do something but don't sit there and claim to be a christian we are not to be spectators or observers we are supposed to be participators we are supposed to be ones who are engaged in the race not just spectating or admiring someone else running in the race and saying oh he's a good man oh she's a christian woman that that young woman she is just a beautiful one that's living for for her lord well that's her faith but but i want to live the way i want to live no my friends let us see the example put forth by the savior how no matter he endured the shame he endured the toilet test the trials he endured the sufferings of persecutions that he might come to the end of the way and so should it be like every one of us friends put god's first in everything your home your husband your wife your children whatever it is let that take second place and put god first let him be the number one thing or person within your heart and within your life may god find the very first place within our hearts and within our lives you must let him have the preeminent position in your heart and life god doesn't want second place god does not want to be a spare tire in your life that you only call him into your life when you're broken down and your life isn't moving anywhere you can't go on then you need him no he will fulfill that but nevertheless he does not want to be second place he wants to be recognized as being number one the preeminent one the one who has first place within your heart and within your life i say to you he deserves the best he deserves the first place within our hearts and within our lives and so we need to seek the will the plan and purpose of god we're not we're not here to look after the acclaims of man we're not here for the recognition of man we are not here for the platitudes the the great the papers and the great diplomas and certificates of of man though that may be good in the educational field of natural life natural endeavor we understand that that does give us some kind of recognition but let us not put our faith or our trust in such things put our trust in jesus christ who is the same yesterday today and forever oh glory be to god let's not give favor to what our neighbor thinks or what the people think it has nothing to do with your wife and her what she thinks of how you are serving god let us not seek the favor my friends of anything else oh praise god but let's look forward to being the one that places him first within our hearts and within our lives now paul emphasizes one of his chief concerns that we should finish our race with jesus christ finish it with glory and with the spirit of trial for we find as the song says oh there are many who start in this race many who start going to church many who start claiming to believe the message of the hour menu who start out religiously pressing on the upward way but then very soon [Music] they fall and stumble by the side of the way romans 2 1 that dwell therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip another translation says niv pay more careful attention so that we do not drift away from that which we were taught in the word of god may god help every one of us listening to the word of god regardless of where you are what nation what country what corner whether in a palace whether in a great mansion or whether in just a little old huffle by the side of the way what you are hearing is the word of god and if you hear god's word god will pay heed to you and god will hearten to your life to your needs and mostly he will help you to win this lice race he'll help you to finish this lice race so let's not only be starters we have a lot of starters right now you look in the denominations you look around the world and there are thousands and thousands of starters whenever you go and you witness whether on television or in person my friends the race starts out with thousands of people no matter what marathon it is in and they all start together and you wonder how many is going to come to the end of the way but jesus already told us whoa man he was running the broad way oh but there is a way there is a narrow way there is just a and few there be that will find it few will finish this race few will make it through the trials the troubles the tribulations the torments the persecutions the reproach for the world the shame that must be born for his great name oh praise god forever may the great holy spirit help us today that we will make it through no matter what the devil tries to true in our way listen to the word of god oh praise god my friends i'll tell you we should worship god give him glory and give him praise every hour every moment of our life our work must be a form of worship every opportunity that presents itself we must worship god we may see or meet someone and we have the opportunity of sharing with them this glorious gospel my friends don't press it don't push it but do your best if the lord up gives you not to reach out to them and let them know there is a better life a man that may be swearing using the name of the lord in vain don't back away from it but be a child of the king and be able with love with humility praise god and not publicly but be able to let the holy spirit allow you to get that person by themselves privately and tell them of the grace of god and of the love of god and what he has done for you and what he is doing for you and how he could change their life and bring them into a life that would be a life eternal a life of joy a life of peace a life of pardon a life of redemption and one which will take them to the end of the way with this blessed assurance that is mine oh what a foretaste of the glory divine oh praise god forevermore thank god we can worship him and give him all the glory just go and share this message this glorious message that we have received in this time with meekness with gentleness with broadly kindness just as you would have it to you you you try to do that with someone else privately share with them either by giving them a tape a book a sermon a song your personal testimony tell them all about love and presence of god uh that and the powers of the world to come the anointing of the blessed holy spirit upon your life and what it took you from and what he has brought you in he took you out of the ghetto and put you in the ghetto he took you my friends from the bottom of the pits and put you in his palace that you can say i walk with the king hallelujah glory to god i walk with the king blessed be his holy name no matter what you may be called my friends we know there's a god in heaven who answers the prayers of his people who believe in faith and believe and trust in his word just this week we had a wonderful precious brother was rushed to the hospital they tested him they did that checked up on him and one hospital said oh you you have a problem it's your heart you've got pains you you've got the blockage you've got this you've got that and now let's take you to a an even better hospital that has better equipment and doctors meanwhile a prayer request goes out to our prayer circle and the believers saints get before god and begin to pray in faith for we know the prayer of faith shall heal the sick and the lord will raise them up did you hear that we'll do the praying he'll do the raising up you do the believing he'll do the delivery you trust in him and he will perform his works so prayer was made and while taken the next day to that other great hospital when they check this what are you talking about we don't see anything there's nothing here there's nothing wrong with this man why did you bring him here in the first place and and they just gave him clearance and gave him the freedom to return to his home all praise be to god he's a mighty healer he's a deliverer he's the same yesterday today and forever my friends if you trust in him he will see you true maybe you're sick right now be healed in the name of jesus christ maybe you're in pain right now in the name of jesus christ may that foul and evil spirit lose that person whichever part of their body that you have a hold of i demand in jesus christ's name and that his name every knee shall bow and every tongue must confess oh you must confess him as lord you may leave the person now and go from them and return no more may the healing touch whether it be cancer whether it be blood pressure whether it be back pain matter whatever it is if that person can only believe all things are possible to them that will believe the word of god listen hebrews 4 1 let us do for fear lest a promise be left us entering into his rest any of you should come short of it hallelujah o praise god hallelujah blessed be the name of our god yes brother sister let me stay in christ let me stay under this you may say oh you're a fanatic that's right i've been to the attic i've been there and i've come back down with the holy spirit within my soul hallelujah they may call you a holy role they may call you excitable they may call you one of those people yes brother sister but i am a supernatural witness of the word of god and the power of the holy spirit amen may god keep our souls in christ because some day is coming i said one day he's coming again and all those who are in christ will god bring with him in the name of jesus christ there is a spiritual revealed truth laying right there and it'll take you having a spiritual mind to catch it and to hang on to it now we're talking about being a finisher in this race and i want to quote from a wonderful person that is an actual runner her name is jennifer bro the gun and here she is speaking now i know what it takes to win a race friends anyone can race but it takes something special for someone to win a race what does it take it takes hours of training it takes hard work it takes spending time in the wet room it means putting away changing your eating habits your sleeping habits you can't think you're going to live on a diet of ice cream and cake and four hours of sleep and you're going to be a winner in the race it'll lead to disaster yes sir you must have a like a diet she says of lean protein with fruits and vegetables is more successful than those kinds of other diets and it's true my friends in this race we want to be finishers we just don't want to have the glamour and glory of starting in the race or saying i'm a christian but being a finisher in the race you cannot partake in cake and late night slumber parties and liquored up parties my friends instead you need to lay aside every weight and every sin that easily tries to cling onto you and to hold on to you amen praise god but you must put your eyes upon the prize which is jesus christ our lord and eternal life which he alone can give amen we must run this race run it like i said with the back of your mind with the thought i am a finisher and i am going to finish this race with god's help i started with jesus and with god's help i am going through oh praise god forevermore you are going to start out by believing first of all if you're not a believer then from today you must be a believer become a believer be baptized in water in the name of jesus christ not father son and holy ghost but in the name of jesus christ for those apostles realize what jesus was saying when he did use the words be baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost he did not say names but in the name one name for that person that is father son and holy ghost and peter which some claim is the first pope he said it clearly in acts chapter 2 verse 38 and onwards he says it's clearly repent be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ hallelujah and be baptized in the name of jesus christ it's the name that we must be baptized in for there is no other name given under heaven whereby we must be saved but the name of jesus christ for this is the name that is above all names that the lord god has given unto us now after believing we have started our race but now you must persevere you must be persistent you must live with spiritual stamina and allow the holy spirit not to be just laughing and funny because the christian life is no my friends it's not one where you go around with a sour face or a grumpy face either it's full of the joy of god but not the frivolous joys of the world but we must press on with perseverance in the middle of all our tests and trials thirdly we must have this spirit of getting to the finish line by laying aside every sin every weight anything that will try to cling on or attach on to us by the grace of god hebrews 12 listen looking since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and every sin which clings so closely and let us run with patience or endurance the race that is marked out by god are set before us looking to jesus the founder the perfecter the author and the finisher he was not just a beginner or an author but he was the finisher and he expects all of his children to be finishers of this marvelous and this glorious race now my friends many runners properly nourish their body so that if they encounter problems along the way they'll be able to recover quickly and press on so must we as believers keep feeding on the word of god not just the bible but the revelation of that word amen and as we feed on the word building up our spiritual strength our maturity and our spiritual stamina when we are knocked down by a branch when we are knocked down or we stumble upon some stone that may be in our way when we get knocked out of our lane we can rise and try again as i've often said we can turn our setbacks into comebacks praise god hallelujah we can endure the long runs we can do the short runs we can do the speed runs we can lift the weights we can do all the stretching and learn how to endure and push and press your way through pain and do all all the sore muscles all the aching tired lungs you learn to do all of this so that when you are in this race you can truly say i am going through i am going through no matter what others do i'll take the way with the lord's despised view i started out with jesus what i am going through as christians let me say to you we must work hard to straighten our faith that we may endure the race we must seek him daily in prayer we must feed on his word daily we must live by having fellowship with others who are running in this race we must my friends mix with other believers so that we may be encouraged by them or we may be used by god to encourage them within our walk that is why we need the fellowship of the saints the fellowship of the believers we must also have fellowship so that we may have rebuke some people only love to be praised but when god anoints a brother a sister a pastor a deacon a trustee with a word of rebuke and correction many times we don't want to receive it for a man but god allows us to develop within our personality within our lives personal private discipline accountability that we might grow in christ and we may keep our eyes focused on him alone yes my friends there are many things may come in our life that may slow us down many things may come in our life that may stall us in our run to the finish line many times self-centeredness and joy that is only for yourself personal praise slows us down sometimes sin clings on to us so closely and it's hard to shake off that habit or to shake off that sin that clings to us so closely and after a while sin that habit that that thing which you will say oh that's my way that's the way i well god wants you to have his way and to shake off those things that are of self of sin and of the world the laid the messiah amen the father we are from sin the closer that we can be to him and let us keep our eyes on jesus not on the spectators on the sides of the way but keep our eyes upon the lord jesus looking unto jesus paul said looking on to jesus the author and the finisher of our faith let's finish this race that we started that god placed upon us praise god hallelujah set your eyes firmly upon him when we thank my brothers when we come to the end of the way remember the crown remember the reward that he has promised how he would make us into a tree of life how he would give us the victor's crown hallelujah when we come to the end of the way or we will have life eternal life which will never end no more weeping no more crying no more sorrow no more tears when we come to the end of life's way amen hallelujah glory to god hallelujah remember always whatever you may be going through or suffering a crown awaits you at the end of your life's race you may be weary some saints may feel like giving up you might feel like letting go my friends sin may have grabbed a hold of you but every look you took a jesus one look will take away the weight of that sin one look will encourage you in your life's way one look will put you back on track for the glory of god so that you will have the strength to endure and to finish the race well and to cross that finish line and get to the lord jesus christ be a finisher not a starter only but be a finisher of the race i want to emphasize that oh there are many who started in the race but look around you where are they today oh i've seen that when i was just a teenager one of the olympic stars came to uh my old country of guyana and there he trained with a young man who was the champion in his field in that country and he had heard of him so leaving where he was he came to train or to teach this young man who later went on to the united states and received a scholarship there for he was so very good but one thing is that this man came and trained with us and show to us it's not by working up your your strength and working up yourself but being relaxed knowing what you're doing and being confident in what you're doing and pressing on the upward way glory to god hallelujah my brothers my sisters therefore as the scripture says leaving the principles the drop the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on to perfection let us not go again laying again the foundations of repentance from dead works and faith towards god oh how we need in this journey to find a place where we can rest in the grace of god and feast upon the word of god oh praise god we because friends we are engaged in a great battle it's a race and yet it's a battle enemies all around you satan may be running trying to get you out of your lane or or to use the spikes on the shoe to to make sure that you are wounded or in some way to slow you up praise god hallelujah but thank god we are engaged in this great race of the human race and we have heard the call amen start runners get online bang off goes the race and now brother sister we must endure in this race for the glory of god and it's time for us to come into spiritual maturity a time for us to leave the things which are behind and to press on into spiritual maturity we have played around and frolicked a long time along with this message and this word of god and we're going to have to put away childish things put away worldly things put away just these light shallow things and and enter into true spiritual maturity that god wants us to have and really get down to business for the glory of god yes true my friends god has this way of doing things and we must stay in god's way of doing things we are not a denominated people we are not nominal church people or organizational people but we are the people of god and we are to stay in god's way and god's plan and walk in god's provided way not to be sloppy not to be careless oh but to be diligent be be diligent be perseverant praise god in god's way hebrews 6 11 says we desire every one of you that you show the same diligence and the full assurance of hope until the end lord of god hallelujah oh praise god paul says here in the word of god hold unswervingly to the hope we profess for you who has promised is faithful let us draw near to god with a sincere heart in the full assurance of faith so we need to persevere so that when we have done the will of god we will receive the what he has promised the praise he has promised once we have endured to the end and proven to be finishers with the lord now paul speaks to us and he tells us a whole host of men if you were to read hebrews chapter 11 it tells of many like moses and and abraham manoah and jacob and joseph and many others of the prophets that hell took god's unchanging hand of his word as was revealed to that day and the majority of the people rejected the word of god for that day but for those who endured to the end and were finishers they finished their race holding to god's unchanging hand and now they are the witnesses who will inspire us to finish our race onto glory now we know that these believers in paul's day were mocked and scoffed at as apostates from god they were called renegades that left the faith of moses they were accused of abandoning the law of moses they were accused of forfeiting their old testament promises all praise god but against that dark background that they had paul warned them of the spiritual neglect of spiritual unbelief of disobedience immaturity and rejection of the word he told them hold to god's unchanging hand and he will see you through to the very end no matter what others say what other mock what whatever they said about the patriarch or the prophet or all of god's promises for this day hold to god's unchanging hand for he changes not praise god hallelujah amen there are saints that have gone before us they're on the grandstands of glory and as we are running the race they are cheering us on they're encouraging us on run run with patience the race that is set before you brother and bisco many years ago i say this over and over again preached a glorious message and in it he made the term he said listen we are the last church age there is no one else to run you are the ones that are left to run therefore run run with patience the race that is set before you brother sister in his words and in his way i want to say the same thing today run with patience run with faith run with confidence run looking onto jesus who is the author and the finisher of our faith praise god hallelujah amen amen stay on track don't quit but keep pressing on until you reach the finish line in the power of jesus christ amen hallelujah i'll tell your friends you're listening to me now and back then they listened to paul but you are here listening to me today and judaism was deeply embedded it was culturally embedded and religiously embedded by tradition but instead today you might be listening to me and you're coming from a culture a background a religious reference point you're coming out of that background of roman catholicism hinduism buddhism paganism muhammadanism spiritualism or even d nami nationalism and i am bringing the word of god for you to be able to see clearly that god wants you not to be any of those things but to be a christian a real christian from the bottom of your heart amen praise god hallelujah you may be listening today and you may have been a christian even a believer a follower of this message but your steps have been slowing down oh many who start in the race many you who begin to slow down in the pace many who are stalling on their road matter of fact they've come to the point like peter when uh he said oh i'm going back fishing i'm going to find a good place where i can go and and fish and and by fishing i'll forget i'll forget about the lord i'll forget about serving him i'll forget about the tests of forget about the trial i'll forget about the endurance i'll forget about all of these things but oh let us not be like him because we know that peter only went fishing for a while and then he heard the voice of god and realized that he could not fish for fish he had to fish for man may god help you today that you may recognize that your greater call is for god to use you as a fisher of men praise god as the roadblocks mount as your problems begin to melt up as your fate seems unproductive as doors begin to slam in your face you begin to find it easier and easier to start beginning to think about quitting doors may slim in your face and you may easily think about quitting in this personal private race that you have with the human race the race the glory the race to jesus christ but i'm here today to remind you like paul like the prophet who went before that you must put jesus first let him have the supremacy in your life and let him have the excellency that only jesus christ can give there's no stronger inducement or in our excitement or enticement to stay in the race but to fix your eyes on jesus looking onto jesus the author and the finisher of your face for he shows the example who endured the faith endured the cross endure the garden of gethsemane endured all the the things and he was not guilty we were guilty but by his grace he has set us free set us an example that look i i made it i am a finisher and all my children will make it through no matter what trial what trouble what tribulation satan puts against them they'll make it true for i am in them i am the conqueror i am the overcomer i am the mighty one i am he the same yesterday today and forever and listen to our scripture we we are compass with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which though so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despised in the shame and is set down at the right hand of god for considering him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest you be wearied and faint in your mind my beloved friends my brothers my sisters in christ let us run our race to glory in life let us run in close communion in connection with god true prayer through our constant communication with him let us allow god's word to take command and control and become the governor within our lives and let us do that by worshiping him praising him giving him all the glory every step of the way loving our brethren annoying and serving our lord and master the lord jesus christ and better and better each day let him be a constant daily companion and let him be our guide in our hearts and made in our lives remember we are finishers and i remember as a finisher everything must be finished well when it's been woodworking or whether it be in running it must be finished perfectly and if you're going to be a finish finisher friends not just starting in the race i reiterate this there are many who have started in the race oh but with the trials on the test they failed to keep pace others accept this message this word this for promise of this hour all because it was new but i want to tell you today give it a second look a third look a fourth look and you'll see something different making itself made manifest and say lord jesus i started the race i fell along the way i stopped along the way i stalled along the way but with jesus help with god's help i will i can i will go through resting upon jesus my lord and master may he
