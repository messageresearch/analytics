[13:01] amen

[13:06] forget it not we know that brother

[13:11] neither decline from the words of my
[13:14] mouth
[13:15] forsake her not
[13:17] and she shall preserve thee
[13:21] love her and she shall keep thee now
[13:24] he's not talking about a woman here
[13:27] talking about revelation
[13:30] wisdom is the principal thing
[13:33] therefore get wisdom and with all thy
[13:36] get in
[13:37] get understanding
[13:41] exalt her
[13:42] and she shall promote thee
[13:44] she shall bring thee to honor when thou
[13:47] do
[13:48] embrace her
[13:50] the revelation
[13:53] brother branham speaking here
[13:56] [Music]
[13:59] now the greek word for revelation is
[14:01] apocalypse
[14:03] which means unveiling this unveiling is
[14:06] perfectly described in the example of
[14:09] the sculpture unveiling his work
[14:11] exposing it to the unlooker
[14:14] it is the uncovering revealing what has
[14:18] previously been hidden
[14:20] now on the uncovering is not only
[14:23] revelation of the person of christ
[14:26] but it is the revelation of his future
[14:28] works in the upcoming seven church ages
[14:32] the importance of revelation by the
[14:34] spirit to a true believer can never
[14:38] be over emphasized
[14:40] revelation means more to you than
[14:43] perhaps you realize
[14:45] now i'm not talking about the book of
[14:47] revelations and you i'm talking about
[14:50] all revelation
[14:52] it is tremendously important to the
[14:54] church
[14:55] do you remember in matthew 16 when jesus
[14:58] asked the disciples this question
[15:00] who do men say that i is the son of man
[15:02] m
[15:03] they said some say that thou are john
[15:05] the baptist some elias some jeremiah and
[15:09] and one of the prophets he said unto
[15:11] them but whom say ye that i am
[15:16] and peter answered and said thou art the
[15:18] christ the son of the living god
[15:21] and jesus answered and said unto him
[15:23] blessed are simon bardurna flesh and
[15:26] blood had not revealed it unto you but
[15:28] my father which is in heaven has
[15:30] revealed it unto thee
[15:33] it was revelation read it the way it's
[15:36] written flesh and blood has not revealed
[15:39] it but my father had revealed it and
[15:41] upon this revelation i will build my
[15:44] church and the gates of hell shall not
[15:46] prevail against it
[15:48] don't tell me
[15:50] what he
[15:52] said tell me what he meant
[15:55] and this morning we're under such a
[15:58] great ministry amen
[16:00] a revealing ministry
[16:03] we have the opportunity if we seek the
[16:05] lord amen to receive
[16:08] what he meant
[16:10] and when we get what he meant the
[16:11] revelation that's what brings the
[16:14] changes it means more to us this morning
[16:18] to seek for that than anything else
[16:21] believers amen
[16:23] hallelujah god bless you

[25:38] i want to do a little song this morning
[25:40] it's a song that i was inspired by

[25:46] it was been on my heart all week
[25:48] so it's it's it's matthew 22 where jesus
[25:51] was talking about the parable
[25:53] of a king who drew a wedding feast for
[25:56] his son
[25:58] so he says here go ye therefore into the
[26:02] highways
[26:03] and as many as you shall find bid to the
[26:06] marriage
[26:08] so those servants went out into the
[26:10] highways and gathered together all many
[26:13] as they found both bad and good
[26:16] and the wedding was furnished with
[26:18] guests
[26:18] [Music]
[26:19] and when the king came in to see the
[26:21] guests he saw there a man which had not
[26:24] away in a garment
[26:27] and he said unto him friend
[26:30] how can thou hater have another wedding
[26:32] garment
[26:34] and he was speechless
[26:38] then said the king bind him
[26:40] hand on foot
[26:42] and take him away and cast him into the
[26:45] outer darkness
[26:46] there you shall be weeping
[26:49] of teeth
[26:50] for many a called fewer chosen
[26:53] but abraham said that where the garment
[26:55] was the holy ghost

[38:12] giving him all the praise the honor and
[38:15] the glory once again as the song says we
[38:18] are together again
[38:20] amen just praising the lord
[38:23] giving praise and honor and glory unto
[38:26] him praise god
[38:28] hallelujah i
[38:30] want to make you aware if you're not
[38:33] that brother emmanuel
[38:36] you know brother emmanuel
[38:38] who is usually here with his family they
[38:41] take up maybe one or two pews
[38:44] and um lively fellow
[38:47] and he has
[38:49] taken his flight
[38:51] and gone to be with the lord
[38:53] i went home to
[38:56] africa i believe he told me was to visit
[38:59] his homeland namibia
[39:02] south africa zambia
[39:05] zimbabwe and
[39:07] congo or whatever else
[39:09] but
[39:11] he got
[39:13] such a
[39:15] terrible attack that he
[39:18] passed on
[39:19] and took his flight to be with the lord
[39:22] so we want to extend our
[39:26] sympathy uh words of comfort
[39:30] and actions
[39:32] that show our love
[39:34] to touch the life of that family
[39:36] as we know
[39:37] young
[39:38] jack
[39:40] will be the one that is now
[39:42] in charge of that family his mother is
[39:45] not here she's over there and she's so
[39:47] emotionally distraught
[39:50] that he has to handle everything
[39:53] uh from here so let's pray for him in
[39:55] particular
[39:57] and also let us remember the entire
[39:59] family
[40:00] that needs our
[40:03] blanket of support
[40:05] as a church of god
[40:07] now um
[40:09] they have no father not that they're
[40:12] kids
[40:13] but they're young people but they still
[40:16] need to have a strong
[40:18] male figure there
[40:21] so any one of us that are anointed with
[40:25] the spirit of god can fill that role
[40:28] from time to time
[40:29] and i do believe they
[40:32] after this is over they'll certainly
[40:34] appreciate fellowship
[40:36] uh and they'll certainly appreciate
[40:38] visits
[40:39] and calls
[40:41] but right now and things would be so
[40:43] caught up you know how it is phone calls
[40:46] dress paperwork all kinds of things but
[40:49] just so you know that you're aware of
[40:52] this and our hearts can go out to them
[40:54] of course um
[40:56] brother philip as the deacon was over
[40:58] there and spent until late in the night
[41:02] talking comforting praying
[41:05] encouraging
[41:06] them on praise the lord of course i
[41:09] spoke with them more than once and we
[41:12] trust that god will bring them through
[41:14] this
[41:15] and that they will not come out as
[41:17] bruised reeds
[41:19] but they'll come out stronger than they
[41:22] were before
[41:24] looking ahead and not looking back
[41:27] and forgetting those things which are
[41:28] behind the lord bless you
[41:32] real good now let's go to the word of
[41:35] god
[41:36] um because we are here
[41:38] uh to have church not to have
[41:41] uh we have no programs to attract
[41:44] attention
[41:46] uh we have no great advertisements
[41:49] or stuff of that nature the only thing
[41:52] we have
[41:53] is the
[41:55] anointed and revealed
[41:57] word of god
[42:00] and we're trusting that the god who
[42:04] anointed the prophet
[42:06] with healing and miracles
[42:08] will in the same manner anoint
[42:11] the word of god
[42:14] so that none of us will get to the place
[42:16] like israel got to
[42:18] and complain oh this plain bread
[42:21] and i realized it was angels food they
[42:24] were eating
[42:25] was heavily bred they were eating
[42:28] but it's so simple it appears so simple
[42:32] and so humble
[42:33] that unless you're really watching
[42:36] uh you won't recognize
[42:38] what is really taking place
[42:40] but you'll see because god himself
[42:43] will break forth
[42:45] he will break forth of himself
[42:48] we don't have to bring him down or call
[42:50] him up or drum him down or sing him down
[42:53] or sing him in or dance him down or
[42:56] whatever the word
[42:59] will do all of that
[43:01] if we put our faith and the confidence
[43:03] in the word of god god bless you praise
[43:06] the name of the lord our scriptures are
[43:08] found in
[43:10] psalms chapter 1
[43:13] verses 1
[43:15] to 3.
[43:18] then we will follow reading that
[43:22] with revelation chapter 22
[43:26] verses 1
[43:28] to 7
[43:30] and our
[43:32] thought or topic will be
[43:35] fruits
[43:36] on the tree of life
[43:40] fruits
[43:41] on the tree of life you can say from the
[43:44] tree of life
[43:45] but i'd rather
[43:48] say fruits that are now like hanging on
[43:51] that tree
[43:52] of life praise the lord
[43:55] amen
[43:57] let's read the scripture
[43:59] blessed is the man
[44:02] that walketh not in the counsel of the
[44:05] ungodly
[44:07] stand it in the way of sinners
[44:10] nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful
[44:14] but his delight
[44:16] is in the law of the lord
[44:19] and in his law do he meditate
[44:23] day and night
[44:25] and
[44:26] he shall be like a tree
[44:29] planted by the rivers of water
[44:32] that bringeth forth
[44:34] his fruit
[44:36] in his season
[44:39] his leaf also shall not wither
[44:43] and
[44:44] whatsoever he do it
[44:47] shall
[44:48] prosper
[44:50] amen
[44:51] now we'll read from revelation chapter
[44:56] 22
[44:57] verse
[44:58] 1 verses 1
[45:01] to 7
[45:02] praise the lord
[45:13] let us read
[45:14] and he showed me
[45:17] a pure river
[45:19] of water of life
[45:23] clear as crystal
[45:25] proceeding out of the throne of god
[45:29] and of the lamb and in the midst of it
[45:34] on either side of the river
[45:37] was there the tree of life
[45:41] which bear twelve manner of fruits
[45:46] and yielded her fruit
[45:48] every month
[45:51] and the leaves of the tree
[45:54] were for the healing
[45:57] of
[45:58] the nations
[45:59] and there shall be no more curse
[46:03] but the throne of god and of the lamb
[46:06] shall be in it
[46:07] and his servants shall serve him
[46:11] and they shall see his face
[46:14] and his name shall be in their foreheads
[46:18] and there shall be no night there
[46:22] and they need no candle
[46:25] near the light of the sun for the lord
[46:28] god giveth them light
[46:31] and they shall reign forever
[46:34] and ever
[46:36] and he said unto me
[46:39] these sayings are faithful and true
[46:43] and the lord god of the holy prophets
[46:47] sent his angel to show unto his servants
[46:51] the things which must
[46:54] shortly come to pass
[46:57] will be done
[46:58] behold
[47:00] i come quickly
[47:02] blessed is he
[47:03] that keepeth the sayings
[47:06] of the prophecy
[47:08] of this
[47:09] book praise the lord
[47:11] father thank you so much
[47:14] for your word that you have sent forth
[47:17] and provided for us
[47:20] all down through the ages until the
[47:22] present time and we give you praise
[47:25] honor and glory father in jesus name
[47:29] amen and amen please be seated
[47:38] it's wonderful i believe brother tim
[47:41] read the scripture about the importance
[47:43] the supreme importance of revelation
[47:47] coming forth for
[47:49] uh god's people believers
[47:52] and because god has been giving forth
[47:55] his word casting light on our pathway so
[47:59] that we can see
[48:01] how to walk
[48:03] and
[48:04] we can avoid the dangers
[48:06] because of the word being the light onto
[48:10] our feet and the lamp to our path
[48:12] uh and i believe friends that we ought
[48:15] to be so thankful
[48:17] uh when we
[48:19] recognize
[48:20] and realize what god has been doing
[48:23] through the years
[48:25] giving the word to the prophet and then
[48:27] the prophet saying after i leave here
[48:31] you're going to play tapes
[48:34] after i leave here
[48:36] you are just going to listen
[48:38] to my tapes alone
[48:41] because i have been made pastor
[48:46] oh my i'm letting you know
[48:50] that the prophet is dead
[48:53] we have the message
[48:55] and before he left here he started
[48:57] putting the importance of
[49:00] even in the seal books he said it i must
[49:03] decrease that he might increase
[49:06] when that mighty angel came down on uh
[49:10] mount sunset
[49:11] he he said two of us can't be on the
[49:13] earth at the same time
[49:15] one of us has to go
[49:18] and you know many coats are there he's i
[49:20] see my end
[49:22] you know he knew he was going
[49:24] and he had to leave
[49:26] because another
[49:28] person was coming on the scene
[49:32] and this was not
[49:34] another human being
[49:36] because he plainly said all the other
[49:39] angels were man of the earth but that
[49:41] one in the front with the swept back
[49:43] wings
[49:44] he said that was the lord from heaven
[49:48] so it was the lord that was the second
[49:52] coming of the lord amen to the bride
[49:56] appearing to her first
[49:58] by the opening of the word and then
[50:00] taking out her out of here
[50:03] hallelujah he's helping her to prepare
[50:06] for his own uh coming so that white when
[50:10] he comes they leave and go together
[50:15] and we ought to be so thankful that god
[50:17] has opened
[50:19] the eyes of our heart to see the word
[50:22] and to appreciate the word of god amen
[50:27] and uh that we have the ability
[50:30] uh to
[50:31] recognize the word
[50:33] because not everybody can recognize the
[50:36] word
[50:37] they can read the word they can hear the
[50:39] wording and listen to preaching but to
[50:41] recognize what you are hearing that's
[50:44] another matter
[50:45] because only the elect the bride will
[50:48] fully recognize what god is actually
[50:51] saying and what he is doing in the
[50:54] present time
[50:56] amen this day is this scripture
[50:59] fulfilled
[51:00] amen praise the lord so we must
[51:03] recognize it and when you fully
[51:06] recognize it you almost can't help it
[51:09] you you want to give your whole life to
[51:11] it
[51:12] you want to give your own life your
[51:14] whole life to him
[51:17] and for him to rule over your life
[51:20] you see well uh brother simon i want to
[51:22] do that but i make so many mistakes i i
[51:25] got problems even in my uh thinking yeah
[51:29] i get problems in my walk in my talk in
[51:32] my
[51:33] whatever area
[51:35] but i thank god no matter what comes my
[51:38] way your way there is there is a still a
[51:42] fountain filled with blood opened in the
[51:46] house of david
[51:47] that cleanses god's people amen
[51:51] that blood when you confess and repent
[51:54] of your sins
[51:56] the blood will erase
[51:59] everything amen why you're dropped it in
[52:03] the bleached blood of christ
[52:05] hallelujah and that blood cleanses you
[52:08] and brings you to a place where you can
[52:11] say i'm justified hallelujah you never
[52:14] done it in the first place
[52:17] amen you didn't do it because the spirit
[52:20] of god not only cleanse you from it
[52:23] but you're justified i haven't really
[52:25] started into the message yet but the
[52:28] holy spirit's got me commenting like
[52:30] this because you see uh when uh if you
[52:34] uh
[52:35] went to the courts and and they pardon
[52:38] you
[52:39] or you went to the courts and the judge
[52:43] uh you know dismissed the case and put
[52:46] put it off or something like that what
[52:48] i'm trying to say is is that you did
[52:52] commit the crime
[52:54] that's the reason why you had to be
[52:56] pardoned
[52:58] but what the prophet is saying
[53:00] we
[53:01] we we are justified
[53:04] you never done it in the first place
[53:08] and the reason why
[53:10] is because
[53:11] this
[53:12] satan used this man out here that he has
[53:17] influence over to do all the sinning and
[53:21] to do all the evil
[53:23] and to enjoy the pleasures of this world
[53:27] and everything else and then when he
[53:29] done it then he turns wrong and he
[53:32] accused your soul
[53:34] he accuses your
[53:36] gene your spirit
[53:38] but god is trying to tell you get the
[53:42] understanding and the revelation of who
[53:44] you are
[53:45] that is why james said this seed of god
[53:49] do not commit sin it can't commit sin
[53:53] because that seed is a part of god
[53:55] himself it's a portion of him it's a
[53:58] little messiah of him praise god just a
[54:01] little portion signified by the little
[54:03] licks of flame that came down when the
[54:05] apostles dear pentecost acts 2 4 but
[54:08] that's what it is so the man inside
[54:11] can't see him
[54:13] but when you sin
[54:16] on the outside this man outside doing
[54:19] and saying and thinking all those things
[54:22] that's not the real you doing that
[54:25] because the real you that's on the
[54:28] inside cannot do that
[54:30] because you were elected and placed here
[54:33] as a part of god
[54:35] amen
[54:36] now it's a difference uh i still can't
[54:39] get off of this to get to what i want to
[54:42] say here the fact is
[54:44] that there's a difference between
[54:47] a sinner
[54:49] and one who
[54:50] sins because you know that a sinner is
[54:54] one who just sins by nature
[54:57] the other one
[54:59] he he he just he just make a mistake
[55:03] the other woman she just
[55:06] that's not her nature that's not his
[55:10] nature he feels bad after that happens
[55:13] whenever that happens he feels bad the
[55:15] other one it happens they don't bother
[55:17] them
[55:17] they go and do it again they'll do it
[55:19] again they'll do it again
[55:21] you know a sinner by by habit by nature
[55:25] amen praise and by choice but on this
[55:28] other hand uh this one is making
[55:31] mistakes they slip they fall they they
[55:34] do things they do that praise god and
[55:37] the difference again there is one is a
[55:40] sinner and the other one is a son or
[55:42] daughter oh praise god yes jesus said
[55:46] your servant you can fire them you can
[55:49] kick them out of your house forever amen
[55:52] but your son your daughter there's
[55:54] nothing you can do about it
[55:56] amen you can't do anything about it
[55:59] because
[56:00] your blood is in them there's nothing
[56:02] you can do about it he's already a son
[56:05] she's already a daughter what are you
[56:06] gonna do about it all you can do is
[56:09] speak to them tell them how to do it
[56:11] better forgive them and walk on praise
[56:15] god and that's what god does with us
[56:17] praise the lord and we must be very
[56:21] careful don't let the devil trick us
[56:24] amen hallelujah like brother george
[56:26] smith when he was preaching here said
[56:29] how that the devil
[56:32] encourages you to go and do something
[56:36] then when you do it
[56:38] then he's the first one to call the
[56:40] police force on you
[56:42] to to to arrest you
[56:44] amen see he's the one that does that but
[56:47] it's a different thing when you realize
[56:51] your position
[56:53] and that you are not ruled
[56:56] by your present condition
[57:00] because
[57:02] the condition
[57:03] doesn't change your sonship your
[57:07] daughterhood
[57:08] or your position in christ
[57:11] one is your position the other one is
[57:13] your condition
[57:15] you might be under the most horrific
[57:18] condition just like the other guy
[57:20] but you have sonship back of you you've
[57:23] got a gene you got a seed you got a life
[57:26] you got an election of god ruling over
[57:29] your life
[57:30] so your conditions outside maybe changes
[57:33] stormy smoky whatever
[57:37] this that but your position does not
[57:40] change
[57:41] it remains the same
[57:44] for jesus said for a son
[57:46] abideth in the house forever
[57:50] but the servant
[57:51] yes
[57:52] you can you can fire him get rid of him
[57:55] or her but the son there's nothing much
[57:58] you can do about that amen thanks be the
[58:02] god we ought to thank god for that and
[58:04] praise him that he takes our sins away
[58:08] into the sea
[58:09] of his forgetfulness
[58:12] i just want to stop and again here's it
[58:14] here it goes now i want you to know only
[58:17] really god can forget
[58:22] about what people are talking about that
[58:25] oh oh forget about that forget about
[58:27] this this person you see
[58:29] the the believer doesn't walk a wrong
[58:31] remembering past hurts and past pains
[58:34] this and that there are few things might
[58:36] bother you but the fact is um you don't
[58:39] walk around that way
[58:41] but you will it will always be there
[58:44] somewhere in the vaults of your memory
[58:47] as long as you're here on earth until
[58:50] you're gone then those things will be
[58:52] gone away but only god can really forget
[58:56] because everything we do say think here
[58:59] it's like on a tape
[59:01] is that right
[59:03] and that tape is going to be played back
[59:06] it's going to be replayed so you can't
[59:08] go erasing those things now it's not
[59:10] going to happen only god alone can do
[59:13] that amen
[59:15] and that's the beauty of forgiveness
[59:17] that you may even remember past hurts
[59:19] but because you forgive
[59:21] there is nothing there
[59:23] nothing there holding you
[59:25] praise the lord hallelujah
[59:28] praise the name of god i believe i can
[59:30] go ahead now praise the lord
[59:32] now i want you to realize
[59:35] that um
[59:37] when jesus died on calvary and gave up
[59:39] the ghost
[59:40] that life that was in the lamb of god
[59:44] came upon his bride came up on his
[59:48] church his people
[59:50] that life
[59:52] is the one i'm talking about
[59:55] that is here with us here today by the
[59:58] grace of god and that is as real to me
[1:00:01] as uh anything else
[1:00:04] thank god for that thank god so the the
[1:00:07] word
[1:00:08] the the life that was in that lamb when
[1:00:11] he gave up the ghost the holy ghost
[1:00:16] that life come came back on the church
[1:00:19] of god
[1:00:20] and began to work through
[1:00:23] god's people right on down to this age
[1:00:26] until the word is on and in the bride of
[1:00:30] jesus christ for this hour amen praise
[1:00:33] god hallelujah that's wonderful because
[1:00:37] with that life in us as you know we've
[1:00:40] preached a week or so ago on the life
[1:00:44] that pleases god
[1:00:45] and we found out that the only life that
[1:00:49] can really please god is the life of
[1:00:51] jesus christ
[1:00:54] so uh him in you gives you a life that
[1:00:58] pleases god or the life that pleases god
[1:01:02] amen hallelujah amen and when we come in
[1:01:07] contact with the
[1:01:09] life that is in the
[1:01:12] word
[1:01:13] then we find out it grants gives to us a
[1:01:16] burning love and desire
[1:01:19] within our hearts amen we want to please
[1:01:22] god
[1:01:23] we we want to praise god
[1:01:26] we want to worship god we want to come
[1:01:28] into god's house
[1:01:30] we we don't need uh special
[1:01:34] treats and
[1:01:35] all kinds of encouragements you know the
[1:01:38] message has passed the hour
[1:01:40] when the pastor
[1:01:43] or any shepherd should be out there
[1:01:46] chasing sheep
[1:01:49] sheep are supposed to follow
[1:01:53] the pastor
[1:01:54] those days are over in the first second
[1:01:58] pull of this message
[1:02:01] now it's individual revelation
[1:02:05] and if individual revelation does not
[1:02:09] keep you cemented
[1:02:11] as your
[1:02:13] stone or part in the cap in this pyramid
[1:02:18] in the solomon's temple for this hour
[1:02:21] then
[1:02:22] like your children going to school you
[1:02:24] can't watch them 24 hours the pastor
[1:02:27] can't watch you 24 hours the pastor
[1:02:30] wasn't here to accept to spy on you and
[1:02:32] watch every move what you dress what you
[1:02:34] wear what you eat what you drink what
[1:02:36] you do this do that there is something
[1:02:39] god has sent a life that will keep you
[1:02:43] regardless of who is there you're kept
[1:02:45] by the power of god truth
[1:02:48] faith through revelation of this word
[1:02:51] you are kept by faith amen praise god so
[1:02:55] just settle in your hearts
[1:02:57] and believe god don't think about hell
[1:02:59] don't think about
[1:03:01] backsliding and all these kinds of
[1:03:03] things we know it exists but it exists
[1:03:06] for those who has to be weeded out
[1:03:10] is that right
[1:03:11] hallelujah the the out of the blessed
[1:03:15] subtractions out of the church of the
[1:03:18] living god so that it will come down uh
[1:03:22] i'm talking about the winnowing of the
[1:03:24] wheat seeds
[1:03:25] when you know in the old days you throw
[1:03:28] them up in the air and the wind will
[1:03:30] blow praise god and and the carried away
[1:03:34] with the wind while the the weight of
[1:03:36] the seed will still be in the basket
[1:03:39] amen that's what i'm talking about now
[1:03:42] you are kept by not the pastor
[1:03:45] you you kept not by this or that but now
[1:03:49] you kept completely by the word
[1:03:53] your recognition of the word your love
[1:03:56] of the world the very power of the world
[1:03:59] that's working in your life keeps you by
[1:04:02] the grace of almighty god hallelujah i'm
[1:04:05] so thankful for that amen and that we
[1:04:08] must realize that we as i've uh spoken
[1:04:12] before we are eternal beings
[1:04:15] i'm going to read the future home of the
[1:04:17] heavenly bright and bright groom where
[1:04:18] the prophet said you are not if you are
[1:04:21] elected you are a believer you are not
[1:04:24] creatures of time
[1:04:26] amen he says you come from eternity
[1:04:29] you're going back to eternity amen
[1:04:32] hallelujah praise god forevermore amen
[1:04:36] yes sir so god really sent us down here
[1:04:40] as jeans uh to live in flesh
[1:04:44] amen
[1:04:46] that we
[1:04:47] might be upon this earth so he can be a
[1:04:50] father
[1:04:51] some of us can maybe be sick so he can
[1:04:53] be a healer
[1:04:54] some of us will have these conditions he
[1:04:57] can be a savior some can be without
[1:05:00] money to pay their rent and he can be a
[1:05:03] provider he can show all of his
[1:05:06] attributes the very prism of this
[1:05:09] personality bursting with life the power
[1:05:13] of almighty god strikes the soul
[1:05:16] hallelujah and the word unfalls before
[1:05:19] us amen hallelujah yes sir praise god
[1:05:23] amen so we did not come down here on
[1:05:26] this earth seeking or searching for
[1:05:29] eternal life
[1:05:32] because we were always having eternal
[1:05:35] life
[1:05:36] but we didn't know
[1:05:38] that we had eternal life we had to be
[1:05:42] brought out of our spiritual amnesia to
[1:05:44] recognize who we really are
[1:05:46] we thought we were beggars
[1:05:49] when we realize that we are kings and
[1:05:51] priests
[1:05:52] we thought we were slaves and servants
[1:05:55] then we recognize we are sons and
[1:05:57] daughters are the living god it changes
[1:05:59] the whole picture
[1:06:02] everything changes hallelujah amen
[1:06:05] praise god so when you walked in to the
[1:06:09] services whether here or somewhere else
[1:06:12] and
[1:06:13] all the call was given
[1:06:16] we of course didn't know this so we went
[1:06:19] up to the altar or we responded to the
[1:06:21] call thinking that we are seeking
[1:06:24] eternal life i got to get eternal life i
[1:06:28] got to get it uh oh praise god if i
[1:06:31] don't get it i i may be going to hell if
[1:06:34] i don't get it i mean mr rapture
[1:06:37] hallelujah those were the things that we
[1:06:40] were thinking at that particular time
[1:06:44] amen hallelujah not knowing that eternal
[1:06:48] life was in us that he was there as the
[1:06:51] song says all the time
[1:06:54] waiting patiently for you to come to a
[1:06:57] place of recognition of who you are and
[1:07:01] what was happening within your life
[1:07:03] hallelujah praise god so let me come now
[1:07:08] as i slowly go to this now
[1:07:11] we were not really seeking eternal life
[1:07:14] because you were eternal life you are
[1:07:17] having eternal life what we felt the
[1:07:20] desire for but didn't know it was
[1:07:23] redemption
[1:07:26] hallelujah because you were sold into
[1:07:30] sin by eve
[1:07:32] you were caught
[1:07:34] in the devil's pawn shop of this world
[1:07:40] and you had no way out
[1:07:42] unless the owner
[1:07:45] your owner
[1:07:48] bought you back
[1:07:50] and brought you out of the pawn shop
[1:07:53] and that is what rally jesus came to do
[1:07:57] all that are his
[1:07:59] all that the mind will come to me
[1:08:02] all the father has given me will come to
[1:08:05] me
[1:08:06] praise god you see he said i'm not come
[1:08:08] comfortable
[1:08:10] for the i only come to for the
[1:08:12] uh sheep uh uh the lost sheep amen
[1:08:16] that's what he came for praise god but
[1:08:19] whosoever will may come but this is what
[1:08:22] i really come for whosoever will can
[1:08:24] come to church who has whosoever will
[1:08:27] can uh join something somewhere or the
[1:08:29] other but i'm really coming back for my
[1:08:33] elect i'm coming back for a bride i'm
[1:08:37] coming back for those that were blinded
[1:08:40] and lost during these seven ages of the
[1:08:44] church and i'm going to bring them back
[1:08:46] buy them back and bring them back to
[1:08:49] their original condition into the house
[1:08:52] of the living god amen hallelujah oh
[1:08:55] thank god that we have been redeemed can
[1:08:58] you say that
[1:09:00] we've been redeemed by the blood of
[1:09:02] jesus christ
[1:09:04] not with silver or gold but with the
[1:09:06] precious blood of the lord jesus christ
[1:09:09] hallelujah amen i'm glad that we're
[1:09:13] living in this day when the mighty eagle
[1:09:16] is flying over the lands wherever god's
[1:09:20] people are hallelujah in the densest
[1:09:23] part of africa in the hottest parts of
[1:09:27] india in the most spontaneous parts of
[1:09:30] china wherever it is up in the north
[1:09:33] over in europe thus great eagle is
[1:09:36] flying over hallelujah and he knows all
[1:09:39] them that are his hallelujah amen and
[1:09:43] what he's doing now he's come to he's
[1:09:46] calling out to his own amen they feel
[1:09:50] the spirit's call
[1:09:51] they know the pull amen praise god that
[1:09:55] little eagle in the barnyard he never
[1:09:58] heard an eagle before but the moment he
[1:10:01] heard that eagle screamed he recognized
[1:10:03] the voice hallelujah he recognized amen
[1:10:07] that that was a voice speaking calling
[1:10:10] hallelujah he never heard an eagle's
[1:10:12] language before but yet when he heard
[1:10:15] that language something fits his soul
[1:10:18] like that praise god forevermore i'm so
[1:10:20] glad brother sister that this word fit
[1:10:24] my soul completely amen oh my my my
[1:10:28] praise god there's nothing else for me
[1:10:30] to do but to press on until he calls us
[1:10:33] out of here amen
[1:10:35] lord of god amen thank god forevermore
[1:10:39] i'm so glad that i'm one of his own
[1:10:43] praise god but
[1:10:45] you laid there dormant
[1:10:48] amen from the time you were born that
[1:10:51] gene lay in you there dormant
[1:10:55] you did not know
[1:10:56] why you couldn't do like other
[1:11:00] men and women were doing
[1:11:03] we all did our part of sinning
[1:11:06] so
[1:11:07] there's nothing for us to play holier
[1:11:10] than zou than anybody else
[1:11:12] we did our parts of sinning
[1:11:14] but the fact is even while
[1:11:17] you were sinning
[1:11:20] you just
[1:11:21] don't feel right
[1:11:23] you just
[1:11:24] can't be like this other person i can
[1:11:27] remember even when i was way back in
[1:11:29] school just a young kid and other boys
[1:11:33] would get angry with one another and
[1:11:35] they would
[1:11:36] look for broken glass or something else
[1:11:39] to harm the other person i couldn't do
[1:11:42] that
[1:11:43] i couldn't do simple things and then i
[1:11:45] wonder why am i so like this i can't do
[1:11:48] that i can't do this i can't do and it's
[1:11:51] not because somebody's telling you you
[1:11:52] can't do it you just don't feel inside
[1:11:55] of you something is holding you that you
[1:11:57] can't do it there's a line that you're
[1:11:59] not you cannot cross because you will
[1:12:02] you see gifts and columns are without
[1:12:04] repentance you were kept by god even
[1:12:06] long before you were even saved prophet
[1:12:08] said you think you're just wandering
[1:12:10] here like that and stumbling no he says
[1:12:12] you're here because the spirit let you
[1:12:15] hear amen praise god glory to god the
[1:12:18] great holy spirit has brought us to this
[1:12:22] hour hallelujah and that gene lay in you
[1:12:25] and lay in me
[1:12:27] amen until it could manifest the life
[1:12:30] that it was praise god amen hallelujah i
[1:12:35] thank god that when i heard
[1:12:38] the word read the word and the holy
[1:12:40] spirit hit that gene that was hidden up
[1:12:43] inside that thing burst into life the
[1:12:47] seed life broke open and it began to
[1:12:50] grow in the grace of almighty god
[1:12:53] hallelujah amen and i thank god for it
[1:12:56] amen glory to his marvelous wonderful
[1:13:00] name amen glory to god hallelujah listen
[1:13:04] to i'm reading from the rapture
[1:13:06] book here
[1:13:08] amen
[1:13:10] if you are in christ
[1:13:12] there's not a word written in here that
[1:13:16] you will not believe
[1:13:19] i don't care what anybody else says
[1:13:23] when god makes that thing manifested
[1:13:27] amen
[1:13:28] what i mean is cause when he pours that
[1:13:32] spirit on that word
[1:13:36] that gene word gene amen what happens
[1:13:40] then
[1:13:41] when the spirit is poured on it just
[1:13:44] like putting water on any other seed
[1:13:48] it will then live and bring forth what
[1:13:52] is supposed to bring forth after its
[1:13:54] kind
[1:13:56] hallelujah praise god so god wanted
[1:13:59] children after his kind
[1:14:02] is that right
[1:14:03] so
[1:14:04] a god kind or or a god men god women
[1:14:08] children of god what else is god going
[1:14:10] to bring forth goats bring forth goats
[1:14:12] donkeys donkeys horses horses and god
[1:14:14] gonna bring forth what nothing but a
[1:14:16] part of himself
[1:14:18] is that right it sounds unbelievable
[1:14:21] sometimes but it's true
[1:14:23] amen praise god hallelujah amen it'll
[1:14:27] bring forth after its kind
[1:14:29] oh
[1:14:30] then some of you say i got the baptism
[1:14:34] of the holy ghost
[1:14:37] that don't mean that you're even
[1:14:40] saved is that right
[1:14:43] my
[1:14:44] that doesn't mean you're saved
[1:14:47] because you see what is it's gonna be so
[1:14:49] crystal clear to you
[1:14:51] that the gene is already in you
[1:14:54] the baptism of the holy spirit is just
[1:14:56] the former latter rain that comes to
[1:15:00] claim those seeds and wake them up that
[1:15:03] they might break forth into life
[1:15:06] amen praise god oh my but let's not talk
[1:15:10] about that we'll touch it a little later
[1:15:12] see oh my so you got the baptism the
[1:15:15] holy ghost
[1:15:16] and there's been a lot of hullaboo about
[1:15:18] that in the message and stuff like that
[1:15:20] everybody got to have the holy ghost got
[1:15:23] to have the token don't know what the
[1:15:25] token really is and all that they don't
[1:15:27] realize that token part of it was
[1:15:30] already in you that's what i'm talking
[1:15:32] about all the time amen and the chinese
[1:15:36] abstract had to come down and connect
[1:15:38] with that to make it the full token
[1:15:42] hallelujah and to break forth into life
[1:15:44] make itself manifested a son and a
[1:15:48] daughter of the living god forgive me if
[1:15:50] i get excited because i'm seeing it so
[1:15:52] clear
[1:15:54] oh my listen my friends anytime any day
[1:15:58] now i'm preaching and you
[1:16:00] i just disappeared and
[1:16:02] just give it i'm gone in the rapture
[1:16:05] praise the lord i believe it this is not
[1:16:07] a joke it's true anything could happen
[1:16:10] yeah i mean he knocked walk with god and
[1:16:12] he was not he was and he wasn't he was
[1:16:14] there and he wasn't there you know he
[1:16:16] was there and he wasn't there philip was
[1:16:18] there and soon he wasn't there praise
[1:16:20] god brother ernie fandler told me he was
[1:16:23] one and brother he was in one of brother
[1:16:25] brandon's meetings
[1:16:27] and brother branham uh
[1:16:29] spoke to him and said sir uh
[1:16:33] he says they told you that uh you are
[1:16:36] not anointed by the holy ghost but i'm
[1:16:38] telling you now you're anointed by the
[1:16:41] holy ghost amen he says just about that
[1:16:44] time when he said it
[1:16:46] i don't know what happened i can't
[1:16:48] explain to you all i know is that
[1:16:51] i was in this
[1:16:54] 3000 large crowd and i was on this side
[1:16:57] of the crowd
[1:16:59] and when i come to myself i'm on that
[1:17:01] side of the crowd
[1:17:03] and nobody saw me move
[1:17:06] i didn't feel anything
[1:17:08] except that when i come to myself i feel
[1:17:11] like my head is on a feather pillow or
[1:17:13] something
[1:17:15] i was there and then i wasn't there i
[1:17:17] was over there
[1:17:18] he said oh my so he got a foretaste like
[1:17:23] of the rapture
[1:17:25] is that right praise god and i believe
[1:17:27] friends it's just like that amen
[1:17:30] we won't even feel or know anything
[1:17:33] except that we are in the presence of
[1:17:35] the lord hallelujah
[1:17:37] praise be to god hallelujah amen now
[1:17:41] remember
[1:17:43] you see we are made
[1:17:46] triune being
[1:17:48] with that little fellow
[1:17:51] inside
[1:17:54] a soul
[1:17:56] a spirit
[1:17:57] a body amen
[1:17:59] but remember caiphus
[1:18:03] that too
[1:18:04] soul spirit and body
[1:18:07] and having all that he went and he
[1:18:10] prophesied
[1:18:12] he says look
[1:18:14] even balaam had it too
[1:18:17] was a prophet
[1:18:19] and he prophesied
[1:18:22] but that don't have nothing to do with
[1:18:25] that man on the inside
[1:18:27] do you have a gene a seed life of god
[1:18:31] dwelling in your heart
[1:18:33] you can't put it there
[1:18:36] you can't go pray for and ask god to
[1:18:38] give you one now
[1:18:39] that is what he's talking that the devil
[1:18:42] is caught in his own uh wickedness
[1:18:45] because god had this plan before the
[1:18:47] foundational world
[1:18:49] is the picture's already been taken
[1:18:52] and you're in it or you're out of it
[1:18:55] is that right that's not by me that's by
[1:18:57] him i don't know who he's in and who's
[1:18:59] out but he knows who he's in and who's
[1:19:00] out
[1:19:02] and the point is in us he places the
[1:19:05] gene the seed the attribute
[1:19:08] which is the same thing
[1:19:09] in us as your blessed assurance
[1:19:13] that you come down from him
[1:19:16] and you have this in you that's going to
[1:19:18] take you back to him
[1:19:20] you're not going to be left here but
[1:19:22] it's going to take you right back to him
[1:19:24] because all that knows is the word that
[1:19:27] man inside knows is the word hallelujah
[1:19:31] see
[1:19:32] unless
[1:19:33] that was god's seed in there
[1:19:36] amen his gene from the beginning they
[1:19:40] are predestinated from him then you are
[1:19:43] finished
[1:19:45] amen
[1:19:47] see
[1:19:48] it's just you in that word that's christ
[1:19:52] bring it in there and watch that make
[1:19:56] itself known
[1:19:57] just as it opened up like any other seed
[1:20:01] and declared itself
[1:20:03] then this has to open up and declare
[1:20:06] itself for the age that it's living in
[1:20:12] hallelujah in other words you're not
[1:20:14] going to declare luther's age that age
[1:20:17] because that gene was predestinated for
[1:20:20] this age
[1:20:22] not to manifest justification back there
[1:20:25] and so on so on on gifts
[1:20:28] but
[1:20:29] that seed is here for its own purpose
[1:20:31] for god's own purpose amen see
[1:20:34] because you see you must understand
[1:20:37] that luther could only bring forth
[1:20:40] nothing but sprigs
[1:20:42] i use the word sprouts that's what he's
[1:20:45] saying that's not that's all luther
[1:20:47] could do because that's god's plan that
[1:20:50] the the life will come back up first as
[1:20:53] a sprout
[1:20:54] so the
[1:20:56] the saints in luther's age even though
[1:21:00] they
[1:21:00] had the same holy spirit that's in you
[1:21:05] the life that is in you
[1:21:07] they were not permitted to produce
[1:21:10] anything else
[1:21:12] their purpose on the earth was to
[1:21:16] manifest the spring or or of growth
[1:21:20] of the tree bright tree coming back to
[1:21:24] life again
[1:21:25] and all they could bear is that spig
[1:21:29] amen hallelujah that's the way it was
[1:21:32] hallelujah amen and so when the holy
[1:21:36] ghost falls in this age
[1:21:39] it's not for you to go out and be a
[1:21:42] lutheran to be bringing forth sprouts
[1:21:46] it's not to anoint you to go and bring
[1:21:49] forth for some other age
[1:21:51] but the spirit of god anoints you in
[1:21:54] this hour because it come from jesus who
[1:21:57] was the what the wheat seed
[1:21:59] the corner wheat that fall in the ground
[1:22:02] it must go through its cycle
[1:22:04] hallelujah and come back to what
[1:22:07] seed again
[1:22:09] the
[1:22:10] spoken word coming back now in the
[1:22:13] believers with god's power to transform
[1:22:17] goes back to being sons and daughters of
[1:22:20] god seed
[1:22:22] amen from seed to seed back again
[1:22:26] hallelujah praise be to god hallelujah
[1:22:30] so
[1:22:32] the principle here is you can only
[1:22:35] manifest
[1:22:37] that portion of the word you are
[1:22:40] supposed to display
[1:22:43] i should put it more generally
[1:22:46] the people of this age can only manifest
[1:22:49] that part of the world
[1:22:51] they are supposed to display
[1:22:55] but we happen to be the
[1:22:57] ones that have come out of the last
[1:23:00] church age
[1:23:01] is that right
[1:23:03] and the last church age has already gone
[1:23:06] through its stages
[1:23:08] and it's gone right back to the very
[1:23:10] person of jesus christ
[1:23:13] and the only other person then
[1:23:16] jesus
[1:23:17] himself
[1:23:19] the male
[1:23:21] manifesting his own life
[1:23:24] the only other person that can do this
[1:23:26] other last part
[1:23:28] is his wife
[1:23:29] who has the other part of his life
[1:23:34] working in her life
[1:23:36] amen to manifest him
[1:23:39] to this generation
[1:23:41] praise god because what the bride or
[1:23:44] what we have here now is like the sum
[1:23:46] total of all the other ages
[1:23:48] all that luther had all that wesley had
[1:23:51] all this support all together come right
[1:23:53] down until we have this full cup full
[1:23:57] and running over in this day and in this
[1:24:00] hour by the word of god we know and have
[1:24:02] received things that prophets long to
[1:24:04] know
[1:24:06] but the devil is so cunning he makes
[1:24:08] people think they're they're just so
[1:24:10] ordinary just hear the message every day
[1:24:14] there's nothing to it it's just the word
[1:24:16] it's just the bible
[1:24:18] relax yourself you don't have to bother
[1:24:20] with that he they don't realize what is
[1:24:23] going on he don't want you to know that
[1:24:26] you got you got the real acts 238 amen
[1:24:29] and he's scared of that because when you
[1:24:31] wake up that you i realize you really
[1:24:33] got an axe in your hand and 2 38 to
[1:24:36] blast him out of of existence then he
[1:24:39] gets scared when you recognize what is
[1:24:42] really happening
[1:24:44] but if you just read the scripture acts
[1:24:46] 2 38
[1:24:47] amen it's just acts 2 38 but when you
[1:24:50] realize no no no i've been given 2 38
[1:24:53] and given a big axe to take off his head
[1:24:58] praise god hallelujah
[1:25:01] but thank god
[1:25:03] even though though luther was an early
[1:25:07] stage worker
[1:25:09] i repeat what i've said before he gets
[1:25:12] the same
[1:25:13] salvation
[1:25:14] like you and i will get in this last
[1:25:17] part of the day
[1:25:19] is that right
[1:25:20] we come in the last part of the day and
[1:25:22] we are working for the lord now
[1:25:25] and he did
[1:25:27] that early part
[1:25:30] and he gets the same page just like
[1:25:31] you're going to be getting we're not
[1:25:33] going to have no bigger salvation than
[1:25:35] anybody else we all have the same
[1:25:37] salvation
[1:25:39] doesn't matter you say oh paul oh elijah
[1:25:42] those guys they really have salvation we
[1:25:45] all got it
[1:25:48] and we all got it
[1:25:50] there's no part of it is less than the
[1:25:52] other one we all got salvation it's when
[1:25:55] we come to the judgment seat of christ
[1:25:57] for rewards
[1:25:59] then
[1:26:00] will be the difference where god begins
[1:26:03] to reward those that work and you know
[1:26:07] did things for him and for his kingdom
[1:26:09] for the glory of god hallelujah amen
[1:26:14] praise god so i'm glad that luther had
[1:26:17] complete eternal life now i go to christ
[1:26:20] is revealed in his own word listen to
[1:26:24] this and i'm deliberately slow
[1:26:28] and when i feel like stopping i'll stop
[1:26:30] and if i have to continue it another
[1:26:32] time i will but for now let's deal with
[1:26:35] it now
[1:26:38] this is paragraph i believe 76 here
[1:26:42] for jesus himself
[1:26:45] you know
[1:26:46] is the
[1:26:48] interpretation of the entire bible
[1:26:51] do you believe that
[1:26:56] and he is
[1:26:57] manifest manifesting himself and is made
[1:27:01] manifest in the age
[1:27:04] of whatever part of his body
[1:27:09] is being made manifest
[1:27:11] in other words like i said before if it
[1:27:14] is a foot age it can't go manifest in
[1:27:17] their eyes
[1:27:18] if it's a
[1:27:20] fingerage or a
[1:27:22] mouth age it can't manifest something
[1:27:25] else
[1:27:26] right that's why the prophet's talking
[1:27:28] about don't get your lines tangled in
[1:27:30] these kinds of times you can't get
[1:27:32] tangled up and recognize not recognizing
[1:27:35] what age you're supposed to be in and
[1:27:37] what's supposed to be made manifest in
[1:27:39] and through your life praise god
[1:27:41] hallelujah now
[1:27:42] see
[1:27:43] if it's a hand age then it must
[1:27:48] manifest beyond
[1:27:51] see
[1:27:52] it cannot go and try to be a head age
[1:27:57] if it's a voice age
[1:28:01] well then it can't decide to go back
[1:28:04] there and be a foot age
[1:28:08] if it's uh see see now now we know now
[1:28:14] that's why he was here
[1:28:16] we are now living in the i age
[1:28:21] are you following me
[1:28:24] and now
[1:28:26] the next after that i is
[1:28:30] is he himself to come
[1:28:34] on the scene
[1:28:37] that's what i'm telling you
[1:28:39] that he
[1:28:41] is here
[1:28:44] his appearing among us now
[1:28:47] is only preparing us for his coming
[1:28:51] that is why we are receiving rapture in
[1:28:54] faith rapture revelation

[1:29:09] prophetic
[1:29:11] see
[1:29:12] because we are now in the i age but the
[1:29:15] next
[1:29:16] is to be he himself
[1:29:19] he says prophetic amen that means after
[1:29:23] he's gone
[1:29:24] hallelujah he puts you in the hand of
[1:29:26] the spiritual joshua for this hour which
[1:29:29] is jesus christ himself

[1:29:47] word
[1:29:48] hallelujah praise god forevermore now
[1:29:51] see down through the edge
[1:29:54] we started off from the foundations
[1:29:58] he's trying to get this truth in
[1:30:01] from the first church age when the seed
[1:30:04] went
[1:30:05] in the ground the complete seed went
[1:30:07] into the ground then it comes up
[1:30:10] back through the feet
[1:30:12] luther come up then through wesley
[1:30:16] then
[1:30:17] into them pentecostal which is the tones
[1:30:20] now of that body then the lipsy
[1:30:24] now i'm saying again
[1:30:27] it's now in the eyes
[1:30:30] that was his ministry
[1:30:32] right the word
[1:30:35] manifesting that is in the eyes
[1:30:38] prophetic
[1:30:39] of malachi 4
[1:30:42] and so forth now there's nothing else
[1:30:45] left for it
[1:30:47] to come
[1:30:48] but he himself has got to come and step
[1:30:53] into that
[1:30:54] what his body for this hour
[1:30:58] the son of man
[1:31:00] now being revealed not in the form of
[1:31:03] the headship but in a bright form
[1:31:07] or in the form of a bride so the devil
[1:31:10] is his mind is blood because he's
[1:31:12] looking for jesus
[1:31:14] that jesus that was back there to come
[1:31:16] back and while he's looking for jesus to
[1:31:18] come back there here is a many member
[1:31:21] body running around glorifying god
[1:31:23] praising god fulfilling the word making
[1:31:27] jesus christ known amen
[1:31:29] and they know they and their father are
[1:31:33] one
[1:31:35] they're one
[1:31:37] same ingredients
[1:31:39] same portion
[1:31:41] a temple full of water from the ocean is
[1:31:44] same as if the whole ocean it has the
[1:31:46] same chemical values it ain't going to
[1:31:48] be different it's the same thing it's
[1:31:50] just the portion that is it might be
[1:31:52] smaller but it's the same thing
[1:31:54] i and my father are one
[1:31:57] you and your father are really one
[1:32:00] one
[1:32:01] the man inside
[1:32:03] amen because you are him
[1:32:06] being revealed
[1:32:08] praise god hallelujah oh my so then the
[1:32:12] last thing there it is he has got to
[1:32:15] come himself and step into that
[1:32:18] praise god the next then
[1:32:21] when that's here the next thing
[1:32:24] will be
[1:32:25] is the intelligence starts coming that's
[1:32:28] what's coming right here now
[1:32:31] supernatural spiritual intelligence
[1:32:34] amen not man-made intelligence
[1:32:38] not me going and saying oh brother simon
[1:32:40] must have studied the message for 40
[1:32:43] years maybe he prayed under some trees
[1:32:47] maybe he was up all till midnight and
[1:32:49] this and that yes i did a lot of that
[1:32:51] stuff in the early part of the message
[1:32:54] praise god but i i come to discover god
[1:32:58] is making it known no
[1:33:00] that is good but that's not what you
[1:33:03] need to depend on hallelujah all you
[1:33:07] have to do is relax let go and let me
[1:33:11] start to
[1:33:12] give you uh insight into my mind
[1:33:16] of what i'm seeing and what i want done
[1:33:19] and then speak that
[1:33:21] then it's not you it's me from the lord
[1:33:23] hallelujah making himself known that you
[1:33:26] recognize jesus christ the same
[1:33:29] yesterday today and forever
[1:33:31] lord of god hallelujah amen you see then
[1:33:37] we recognize we have no intelligence
[1:33:40] then of our own
[1:33:42] when this start to happen you start to
[1:33:44] realize you don't have no intelligence
[1:33:45] of your own doesn't matter what school
[1:33:47] you went to i don't care what you know
[1:33:50] all the man's knowledge is pittance to
[1:33:53] god
[1:33:54] imagine that you have a chance to
[1:33:58] break into god's wisdom
[1:34:01] god's knowledge god's intelligence of
[1:34:04] course you don't walk in there when you
[1:34:06] feel like you want to walk in but you
[1:34:08] are invited in what is necessary for you
[1:34:11] to go in there uh a man and walk and go
[1:34:16] allowed to go behind the veil praise god
[1:34:19] so
[1:34:20] oh my
[1:34:22] we have no sight of our own
[1:34:25] no intelligence
[1:34:28] no man could foresee those things he
[1:34:32] cannot do it
[1:34:34] prophet said i want to tell you it's god
[1:34:37] himself
[1:34:39] doing all of that praise god
[1:34:42] it's be coming to a place
[1:34:45] that he's governed the body all the way
[1:34:48] through
[1:34:50] then now
[1:34:51] the complete body of christ
[1:34:54] is revealed now
[1:34:56] in the form of a bride
[1:35:00] that was taken out of his sight like
[1:35:04] adam was back then at the beginning but
[1:35:08] now
[1:35:09] hallelujah she comes from his side
[1:35:12] where does she come from
[1:35:15] and his side his adam back there was
[1:35:17] flesh but he back here is what the word
[1:35:20] and she comes
[1:35:22] as a part of him out of the word
[1:35:25] she becomes a word bride which is a part
[1:35:28] of himself amen we're not conscious of
[1:35:31] it the prophet said you're not really
[1:35:32] conscious of it but as you walk and that
[1:35:35] spirit begins to reveal and make known
[1:35:38] you begin to recognize little by little
[1:35:41] just like a baby's eyes being opened up
[1:35:43] first it's foggy and smoky but then
[1:35:45] after a while you you the path of the
[1:35:48] just shall be a shining light as men as
[1:35:51] they approach that perfect day praise
[1:35:53] god i tell you friends the ours come
[1:35:57] when the power and presence and
[1:35:59] revelation of the living god is striking
[1:36:01] the bride of jesus christ amen
[1:36:03] hallelujah now see
[1:36:06] if you are in
[1:36:08] christ there is not a word in there
[1:36:12] that you will not believe you will
[1:36:16] believe every single word of the living
[1:36:19] god hallelujah amen praise god and as i
[1:36:23] said before if the holy spirit the rain
[1:36:28] the the rain of the spirit falls on the
[1:36:31] genuine gene
[1:36:33] life seed
[1:36:34] oh praise god
[1:36:38] oh if you could ever
[1:36:39] be able to recognize this it would be a
[1:36:41] real blessing
[1:36:43] you know
[1:36:44] you can have a church full of people
[1:36:48] and i repeat
[1:36:49] i've preached to thousands 50 000 at one
[1:36:53] time
[1:36:54] and i've gone into little villages and
[1:36:57] towns and started churches with two
[1:37:02] so
[1:37:03] numbers is not the thing that impresses
[1:37:05] me
[1:37:06] i'm looking for god
[1:37:08] and whether he's behind hiding behind
[1:37:11] two or ten or fifty or ten thousand
[1:37:14] amen that's what i'm looking for praise
[1:37:17] the name of the lord jesus praise god so
[1:37:20] you you see you've got a real nice
[1:37:22] friends that's uh the holy spirit falls
[1:37:25] on that gene
[1:37:27] that is in you and i and then begins to
[1:37:31] water that gene
[1:37:33] amen
[1:37:34] you begin to the water of the world
[1:37:37] isn't that what he said in the church
[1:37:38] book
[1:37:39] if the seed be planted
[1:37:42] the water will rise it up again
[1:37:45] the water will raise it up again praise
[1:37:48] god forevermore i'm glad it has raised
[1:37:50] it up inside of me amen and bring it to
[1:37:53] a manifestation praise the lord amen so
[1:37:57] he was there all the time just waiting
[1:37:59] for for when the holy spirit of god
[1:38:02] would come amen praise god so you you
[1:38:05] realize then that we come eternal we're
[1:38:09] baptized to the holy ghost i'm trying to
[1:38:12] i'm doing several things here or he is
[1:38:14] trying to accomplish several things here
[1:38:16] he's trying to bring you out of your
[1:38:17] denominational way of thinking
[1:38:20] you say i'm in a message i don't think
[1:38:21] that anymore but you have a lot of
[1:38:23] backwash
[1:38:26] that you're not conscious of
[1:38:28] that's laying in you and he wants a pure
[1:38:31] spotless bride
[1:38:33] so he wants to get that out of us
[1:38:36] you didn't come here
[1:38:38] to get really saved and to get eternal
[1:38:41] life
[1:38:43] you come to be redeemed
[1:38:45] to be brought back
[1:38:47] and brought back where you come from
[1:38:51] you come here to the lord and you come
[1:38:55] and give your heart to him
[1:38:57] praise god
[1:38:58] because the
[1:39:00] seven
[1:39:02] years
[1:39:03] of the church ages are over
[1:39:06] and you're entering into the bride's
[1:39:08] jubilee
[1:39:10] to go back to your the things that you
[1:39:14] own you go back to your land go back to
[1:39:18] what god had for you you're going right
[1:39:20] back to it again
[1:39:22] hallelujah because you you fulfill the
[1:39:25] word you come through all the stages of
[1:39:28] the world and it's becoming to us to
[1:39:30] fulfill all righteousness or the rest of
[1:39:33] the world that's left to be fulfilled it
[1:39:36] it's becoming unto us to be able to do
[1:39:39] that glory to god hallelujah amen so
[1:39:42] when you come to the altar it didn't
[1:39:44] make you eternal
[1:39:46] because then eternal would have a
[1:39:47] beginning
[1:39:48] right but
[1:39:50] it just made you recognize
[1:39:53] that you have eternal life in you
[1:39:56] all the time as i illustrated some time
[1:39:59] ago how that when the the baby is born
[1:40:02] and the baby comes forth i don't know
[1:40:05] if the doctors do that today
[1:40:08] you know but the doc used to pick the
[1:40:10] babies up and then take his one hand and
[1:40:13] pow
[1:40:14] slap it on the bomb
[1:40:16] and if that's not a stillborn child
[1:40:20] that child is going to scream ah
[1:40:23] oh this one is a life glory to god
[1:40:25] hallelujah amen what is that
[1:40:28] the child didn't just get life
[1:40:32] when the doctor slapped it
[1:40:35] the child just manifested that it
[1:40:37] already had life in it
[1:40:40] and that is what i'm trying to tell you
[1:40:42] that we are thinking has to be changed
[1:40:46] the holy ghost is just washing us
[1:40:48] cleansing us and changing the way we
[1:40:50] think
[1:40:52] people are run up to the altar and say
[1:40:53] oh i got saved on this date you're
[1:40:55] eternal there's no date you got saved on
[1:40:58] you were saved before the foundation of
[1:41:00] the world the lamb was slain before the
[1:41:02] foundation of the world god already knew
[1:41:04] who was saved and who wasn't and and and
[1:41:08] we just are playing out the great drama
[1:41:11] the story of redemption
[1:41:13] now making itself manifested amen how
[1:41:16] could they know that he the lamb was
[1:41:18] slain except he come down going across
[1:41:21] and go through the entire drama so that
[1:41:23] the senses of a human could recognize
[1:41:25] that he did die for the sins of the
[1:41:27] world and so the same thing with us as
[1:41:30] believers we have got to follow in his
[1:41:33] stead and his footsteps to fulfill the
[1:41:36] rest of the story
[1:41:38] fulfill the word of the living god amen
[1:41:42] praise god so the doctor didn't put life
[1:41:45] in the child
[1:41:47] the child already had life in it
[1:41:50] uh let's come a little closer uh rising
[1:41:53] of the sun i wouldn't go through the
[1:41:54] coat i just talked
[1:41:56] off the top of my head where the prophet
[1:41:58] was talking about the car
[1:42:00] and he talks about the car can sit there
[1:42:02] with every mechanic
[1:42:05] everything could be right the church
[1:42:07] could be set up perfectly the singing
[1:42:10] the this everything perfect
[1:42:12] right
[1:42:13] and
[1:42:14] they can even have the word
[1:42:16] they're preaching the word it's the
[1:42:18] message of the hour
[1:42:20] he says but you see
[1:42:22] really
[1:42:24] the power is already in the gas
[1:42:27] the power is already in the world
[1:42:30] that you may be even preaching right
[1:42:32] it's there in the gas
[1:42:35] but the power that's in the gas will not
[1:42:38] be released until a spark hits it amen
[1:42:42] oh lord send the power just now
[1:42:46] send the holy spirit to quicken the word
[1:42:49] of god to bring that word to life amen
[1:42:52] amen oh my that's my prayer that god
[1:42:56] will quicken the word and make the word
[1:42:59] live or his words
[1:43:01] live
[1:43:02] for he has promised no word will return
[1:43:06] to me void it will accomplish what i
[1:43:09] sent it down here to accomplish and it
[1:43:11] will go back to come back amen and
[1:43:13] fulfill its purpose here upon the earth
[1:43:18] earth amen hallelujah amen i thank god
[1:43:22] that i already got
[1:43:24] power in my tank
[1:43:27] i got power
[1:43:28] gas within my thank tank glory to god
[1:43:33] hallelujah
[1:43:35] oh my what can what can you say
[1:43:39] uh how can i say this
[1:43:42] that we just sit here and we sit quietly
[1:43:45] and we just hear in the word of god and
[1:43:47] you're not seeing miracles breaking out
[1:43:51] you're not seeing uh
[1:43:53] fire or blood or smoke or something like
[1:43:56] that
[1:43:57] you see god
[1:44:00] it's what rebecca did if you read the
[1:44:02] story of rebecca
[1:44:04] when eliezer came and gave her all kinds
[1:44:07] of jewels
[1:44:09] all kinds of precious stones
[1:44:11] the bible said that she was more
[1:44:14] interested in hearing about isaac
[1:44:21] they're coming the brethren are coming
[1:44:23] her nephews are coming and they're
[1:44:25] bothering her when eliezer is trying to
[1:44:27] talk to her so she just took the whole
[1:44:29] stuff of jewels all them gifts that she
[1:44:33] got from him and she give it to them
[1:44:36] you can go off with the gifts
[1:44:38] you can run off with all of that but i
[1:44:40] want the word i want isaac i want to see
[1:44:43] this man i want to see jesus
[1:44:46] i only one look amen if i can only get a
[1:44:50] look a glimpse at him amen praise be to
[1:44:53] god forevermore so this my friends is
[1:44:57] the power that we are living in the
[1:45:01] power to be released
[1:45:04] and saying that anytime while we talking
[1:45:08] just like this
[1:45:09] that can happen
[1:45:11] very simple
[1:45:13] right
[1:45:14] it's happened before it can happen again
[1:45:17] it can happen again praise the lord amen
[1:45:21] yes
[1:45:23] i'm so careful because the devil will
[1:45:25] twist these things meaning you're
[1:45:26] talking about yourself but just like uh
[1:45:29] um
[1:45:30] down in south carolina speaking and
[1:45:33] while speaking just like this
[1:45:35] all of a sudden a lady a sister screams
[1:45:38] and
[1:45:38] runs up and throws herself in the front
[1:45:41] and and said oh
[1:45:43] i i
[1:45:44] i want to i want my husband to come back
[1:45:49] my husband you know is gone
[1:45:52] and to come back
[1:45:54] and that's years
[1:45:56] and said well we'll pray for you we
[1:45:59] prayed for her and what happened
[1:46:01] four o'clock the next morning they're
[1:46:03] banging on the door
[1:46:05] there's a storm in the city but
[1:46:07] something made that man walk through the
[1:46:09] storm he didn't even wait on a taxi and
[1:46:12] went right back home
[1:46:14] and that man turned to god
[1:46:17] and that man became a
[1:46:19] came a deacon in the church i went back
[1:46:22] and preached there
[1:46:23] and he
[1:46:24] they lived together and he was there as
[1:46:27] an officer in the church for a long time
[1:46:31] another one came up there
[1:46:34] ran up
[1:46:35] next time somewhere else and said oh
[1:46:39] you know i want i i want a child i want
[1:46:42] this i want that and before i could
[1:46:45] think
[1:46:47] that boy said
[1:46:49] i give it to you
[1:46:52] amen and that's the way it came to pass
[1:46:56] fulfill the word of god
[1:46:59] but just so you understand it's nothing
[1:47:02] that you can plan
[1:47:04] you can this you can that see because
[1:47:06] god stopped these things from pointing
[1:47:09] to a man
[1:47:11] so you're going to say this is a miracle
[1:47:12] man and that is a that brother has a
[1:47:15] healing that man has this that man has
[1:47:17] that no
[1:47:18] praise god god wants to bring all the
[1:47:21] glory to himself
[1:47:23] and even when sometimes those things
[1:47:25] happen he doesn't even want it to be
[1:47:27] advertised for anybody to know
[1:47:30] is that right
[1:47:32] naturally speaking of the wisest things
[1:47:35] to to advertise and people know my
[1:47:38] goodness this is a powerful church my
[1:47:41] god miracles have taken place there my
[1:47:44] no but god doesn't want that
[1:47:47] he wants you to walk with a hidden life
[1:47:51] hiding in thee hiding in thee thou bless
[1:47:54] rock villages
[1:47:56] i'm hiding in thee all right let's go on
[1:47:58] to
[1:47:59] to psalms 1 1-3 if you can put that
[1:48:02] scripture back up
[1:48:04] it'll be great
[1:48:09] and i think i'll deal with this
[1:48:12] and then i may just
[1:48:14] um
[1:48:16] begin to wind this up now but i sure
[1:48:18] want to
[1:48:20] show you this in the words psalms 1
[1:48:23] 1-3
[1:48:25] and we can read it together while i'm
[1:48:27] reading blessed is the man
[1:48:31] that walketh not in the counsel of the
[1:48:32] ungodly nor stand it in the way of
[1:48:35] sinners nor sit in the seat of the
[1:48:37] scornful
[1:48:40] but his delight
[1:48:43] when you see that
[1:48:45] his delight i'm bringing your attention
[1:48:47] to something this is speaking not only
[1:48:50] of a man who will live righteously but
[1:48:52] it's actually speaking about jesus
[1:48:54] christ himself
[1:48:56] right
[1:48:59] his delight is in the law or word
[1:49:04] of the lord
[1:49:05] and in his law dot he meditate day and
[1:49:09] night
[1:49:10] you know jesus said i came to do thy
[1:49:13] will
[1:49:14] oh god hallelujah amen
[1:49:18] and he
[1:49:20] shall be like a tree
[1:49:23] praise god you recognize brother branham
[1:49:26] made it clear he says the tree of life
[1:49:28] was jesus christ
[1:49:30] he was in the garden he was the tree of
[1:49:33] life
[1:49:34] and he shall be like a tree
[1:49:37] planted by the rivers
[1:49:41] of waters
[1:49:43] and brick that bringeth forth
[1:49:46] his fruit
[1:49:47] in his season
[1:49:50] thank god
[1:49:51] spiritual food comes in due season
[1:49:54] whether it's whichever church age
[1:49:56] there's different seasons in the year
[1:49:58] and different seasons in that seven day
[1:50:00] week that we are supposed to receive
[1:50:03] life and he brings forth whatever fruit
[1:50:05] he wants in that season as we've been
[1:50:08] talking about these different stages of
[1:50:10] the bodies and how it's going to develop
[1:50:12] they're true and each part must manifest
[1:50:14] its self in its divine position that god
[1:50:19] placed it amen praise god so it's
[1:50:23] wonderful to know that praise god
[1:50:27] and he shall bring forth fruit
[1:50:29] in his season
[1:50:33] and his leaf
[1:50:35] also shall not wither and whatsoever you
[1:50:38] do it shall prosper aren't you glad that
[1:50:41] for that
[1:50:43] amen of course the leaves is speaking
[1:50:46] about believers
[1:50:47] right because you're going to read the
[1:50:49] rest of sam lift up your hands all you
[1:50:51] people let the leaves let the trees clap
[1:50:54] their hands
[1:50:55] he's really talking about people he's
[1:50:58] talking about believers his leaves can't
[1:51:00] wither they can't die
[1:51:03] they eternal right because
[1:51:06] that's what he is now let's go over
[1:51:10] into uh
[1:51:12] revelation 22 and read verses one to
[1:51:15] seven
[1:51:18] just a few things i'd like to
[1:51:20] bring out here amen
[1:51:25] and he showed me a pure river
[1:51:28] of water of life
[1:51:30] clearest crystal proceeding out of the
[1:51:33] throne of god and of the lamb
[1:51:36] it's nice if you could paint a picture
[1:51:38] like that
[1:51:39] but the fact is that's talking about the
[1:51:41] pure word of god
[1:51:43] that flows right from his divine
[1:51:46] presence
[1:51:47] and coming forth to the true
[1:51:49] believers
[1:51:51] that will receive it that's what that's
[1:51:52] talking about uh river crystal clear but
[1:51:56] right away you imagine uh you're
[1:51:58] standing on a riverside like that but
[1:52:00] this river crystal clear hallelujah
[1:52:04] and
[1:52:05] there the tree of life
[1:52:08] on either side of the river
[1:52:13] was
[1:52:14] there the tree of life how can one tree
[1:52:18] be on both sides of the river at the
[1:52:21] same time
[1:52:22] how could that happen
[1:52:24] but you see
[1:52:25] it's not an ordinary tree it's the tree
[1:52:28] of life it's a supernatural tree and
[1:52:30] he's speaking to us
[1:52:32] of the old testament and the new
[1:52:34] testament
[1:52:35] and it's real life being there in the
[1:52:38] old testament and how it comes back in
[1:52:41] the new testament back there it was in
[1:52:45] the form of the male
[1:52:47] and on this side it's the female on the
[1:52:51] other side of the river but it's the
[1:52:54] same tree
[1:52:56] amen and that tree of life which bear 12
[1:53:01] manner of fruits
[1:53:03] praise god not going to break everything
[1:53:06] down and and yielded our fruit every
[1:53:09] month and the leaves of the tree
[1:53:13] were for what the healing of the nations
[1:53:16] that's what we here for
[1:53:18] hallelujah we are here uh to be many
[1:53:22] redeemers many saviors many messiahs
[1:53:27] however you want to describe it that's
[1:53:29] what we are here for to make his word
[1:53:33] manifested and
[1:53:35] uh i want you to know friends that the
[1:53:38] word of god
[1:53:40] come down through the ages hallelujah
[1:53:44] and begin to be brought back to us
[1:53:47] and we start being brought back to
[1:53:50] him praise god now we are not supposed
[1:53:54] to be the arms on the shoulders here
[1:53:57] because the body was made from the
[1:54:00] bottom coming up the feet and it comes
[1:54:02] up now to sanctification wesley
[1:54:04] cleansing of the whole system and stuff
[1:54:07] like that then it goes right up to the
[1:54:10] tongues the mouth or pentecost the towns
[1:54:13] and speaking and manifesting then it
[1:54:16] went to the sea age of the prophet of
[1:54:19] the he's talking about the building of a
[1:54:21] spiritual body and the prophet being the
[1:54:24] eyes of that body made manifest but
[1:54:28] after he said after i'm gone it's gonna
[1:54:30] be he himself
[1:54:33] for there are no more moving parts it
[1:54:36] will just be what the intelligence
[1:54:39] hallelujah and that intelligence i'm
[1:54:42] thankful to god now that is giving it to
[1:54:45] his beloved wife
[1:54:47] he is bringing his love secrets in her
[1:54:50] ears that she might recognize him
[1:54:53] that she might know him
[1:54:56] whom to know is life eternal praise be
[1:54:59] the god hallelujah amen now if you had
[1:55:02] come up in the pentecostal age then god
[1:55:05] will be requiring you to manifest gifts
[1:55:08] but you didn't come up in the
[1:55:10] pentecostal age
[1:55:11] you see lots of people don't realize
[1:55:14] that brother branham was actually the
[1:55:16] messenger for that age and he himself
[1:55:20] said many places the seven church ages
[1:55:22] are now over
[1:55:24] time shall be no more
[1:55:27] hallelujah time for the church ages
[1:55:29] doesn't mean time for the earth amen
[1:55:32] it's over and now brothers and sisters
[1:55:36] that time is over and it's come to the
[1:55:38] place now where it's no more arms and
[1:55:42] legs than this but the
[1:55:45] not fit to operate
[1:55:48] limbs and speaking tongues but fit to
[1:55:52] operate the word
[1:55:55] operate the revelation of the word
[1:55:59] i'll use another word to make it a
[1:56:01] little clearer to manifest the word of
[1:56:04] god so the people can recognize what god
[1:56:07] is doing in this hour
[1:56:09] hallelujah they can see god in his
[1:56:12] wife in his bride hallelujah recognizing
[1:56:16] him in her meekness in her
[1:56:18] long-suffering inner patience in the
[1:56:21] power that's in her life amen every
[1:56:23] aspect of him
[1:56:26] every family trait
[1:56:31] god's family traits
[1:56:33] will be recognizable
[1:56:35] in her
[1:56:36] and there'll no other truth
[1:56:39] these are christians
[1:56:40] they've been with jesus

[1:56:46] even though we love him we recognize him
[1:56:49] and we know who he is we know his
[1:56:50] position his place and how god used him
[1:56:53] amen but they are
[1:56:56] acting like the word
[1:56:59] the they got certain attitudes actions
[1:57:02] like the word

[1:58:18] prophet looked in the vision he saw all
[1:58:20] those young men and young women marching
[1:58:24] marching marching he says and one set
[1:58:27] marched right to the lip of the hill and
[1:58:30] went down the precipice

[1:58:36] marching up into the skies praise god i
