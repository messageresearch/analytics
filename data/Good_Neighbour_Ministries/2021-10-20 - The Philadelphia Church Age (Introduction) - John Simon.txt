you to be left with this habit of prayer this desire for prayer may the lord bless you may the lord bless our brothers pray for this wonderful series which begins on sunday this sunday it will begin and may the lord bless this to your hearts together but for now we will approach this marvelous subject of the philadelphia church age and our scripture is found in revelation chapter 3 reading from verse 7. let's read together and to the angel of the church in philadelphia right these things said he that is holy he that is true he that had the key of david he that openeth and no man shattered and shattered and no man open it i know thy works behold i have set before the unopened door and no man can shut it for thou hast a little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name behold i will make them of the synagogue of satan which say they are jews and are not but do lie behold i will make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that i have loved thee because i was kept the word of my patience i also will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth behold i come quickly hold fast which thou asked that no man take thy crown him that overcome it i will make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out and i will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god which is new jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from god from my god and i will write upon him my new name he that had an ear to hear let him hear what the spirit set unto the churches now philadelphia itself was 75 miles south of sardis we've just finished the sardis church age and uh as we explained these church ages were a microcosm or a like a little nursery for the seeds that were beginning at that time of the world that would mature in these last days and we have just gone through sardis now we are at the city of philadelphia which prefigures the church age of philadelphia of course it was the second largest city in lydia and built upon many hills and was famous famous for what it was famous for being a wine growing district and its coins bore the head of the god bacchus and the priestess bakanti of course was a priestess of bacchus this city was peculiar because in particular this city was populated by jews and also by christians of jewish descent then it was also populated by converts many converts from heathenism and paganism this is a city that suffered also from many frequent earthquakes now i'm laying the foundations for what will be taught for the rest of this church age so let us place our hearts and our thoughts and minds on these facts receive them and see later what we'll be able to express from them even though this city had many earthquakes do you know that it's the longest uh existing city among those seven cities because right now the city still exists but it exists under than the turkish name alas here or city of god oh my it's a city that minted its own coins and the minting of the mintage of that city suggests the deity of the city tobacces in other words the god of that city was bacchus and his priesthood priestess baccante now of course bring back to your memory backus is the same one as nina's which is the same as saying nimrod let me repeat bacchus is nimrod that we read off in the book of genesis in our bible now this was a peculiar coin they minted their coins as many nations do with a face or a name or some other important object on that coin in this case they minted the coin of court with two sides backless on one side and his priestess or and prophetess bakante on the other side this is certainly something we ought to pay some attention to because really if you threw that coin in the air and fell to the ground it didn't really matter which side of the coin was showing whether bacante or bacchus for he was the leading one behind the scenes and before in the front of it also and behind it therefore it didn't matter whether the face of bakante showed or the face of bacchus shown because he backus was still in control which of course this as a pre-figure or pointing to the rhombish religion of jesus and mary jesus on one side mary on the other side but really my friends as we look at it we'll find out that this not only speaks of rome as one city one place or one religion but it speaks of the great harlot spoken of in revelation and this harlot certainly had daughters because they were produced by her harlotry of our fornications and she became a mother her daughters are now coins of of the same mintage or as we say chip off of the old block on one side of the coin they'll worship and talk about the worship of jesus but on the other side of the coin they'll be stressing the worship of mary and it comes back to the same things for when they give the worship of jesus but yet distressed the worship of mary and her creeds not jesus's teachings but her creeds her dogmas hard balls our tenants and then turn around and sell them to the people deceiving them that by keeping these tenants these dogmas they would enter into salvation insisting that she mary alone has the true light contrary to the word of god contrary to the bible how remarkable that that age was characterized by the coin for the mothers and daughters are doing the same thing they're all buying their way into trying to buy their way into heaven they're using the purchase price of money and not blood they will enter by how much monies they give and spend for good works rather than by the blood of jesus christ that was shed for our salvation and given for our sins for he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by his stripes we were healed we are healed we are delivered we are saved because of his great sacrifice at mount calvary now they've changed the uh price tag the price tag is no more the sacrifice of jesus christ but my friends no more that the price is based on money money and not the power of the holy spirit and so we see here the god of this world maman has blinded their eyes and if the blind leaders lead the blind jesus said they will all fall into the ditch together these dealers in debt d-e-a-t-h they're dealing death they are merchants of death my friends they are traffickers in sin and suffering and divert the people away from the word of god but thank god their dealings will end soon for soon that great city of mr babylon the city that sitted on seven hills and one hour the bible says she'll be birthed and the merchants and the rich of this earth will wail and scream and cry because of her passing oh it will be sudden judgment upon her it'll be the hand of the mighty god in christ amen and soon their dealings will be over for this is the age when the spirit of god cries out behold i come quickly and we answer and say even so come lord jesus now you say brother simon how long did this church age of philadelphia last it lasted from the year 1750 to 1906 which is approximately 156 years the meaning of the name of that city is the city of brotherly love philadelphia which uh means love of the brethren or love of the brethren so the city of brotherly love now each age that is featured explained and revealed to us has a messenger you cannot have an age without a messenger sent from god to unfold the word to display the spirit to make known his mighty name in this age that messenger's name is john wesley john wesley was born in epsworth june 17 1703 and he was one of 19 children of his mother susanna wesley his father's name being samuel his father was a chaplain in the church of england but wesley's life was not really influenced by his father's uh teachings uh religious leanings it was mainly influenced by his mother's susanna by her exemplary life a life of modesty a life of holiness a life of prayer a life of sacrifice a life of dedication oh what a woman anointed of god used of god may she be a marvelous example in the bible we may have sarah oh we may have many others with exemplary life in our time through these ages we've seen many other wonderful women of god and amongst them susanna wesley a woman of exemplary life and character that influenced the life beliefs and actions of her son you see mothers you have a wonderful ministry you may not go to a pulpit as the bible tells us clearly she shall not teach nor usurp authority amen god's word said so now she may not preach teach like that from a pulpit but her life is a talking chip to her children her testimony her teachings her examples her advice her wisdom oh what a wonderful marvelous opportunity of you my blessed sisters in molding in shaping and forming those uh beautiful uh and marvelous impressionable children into the image and stature of the perfect man christ jesus john was a brilliant scholar and he did his scholarship most of his scholarship at oxford uh himself and charles and they joined up with a group that was really spiritual young men praying together fasting together seeking god together searching the scriptures together finding the truth amen not going to make doctrines but searching the word and drew and so while they were doing that they drew up a guide for themselves a spiritual guide of works and faith that they should do and one of them was to do giving to the poor to visit the sick and the fatherless to visit the prisoners was because they had it written up and drawn up that this is what they all agreed to do they were called methodist methodists so this is where the the the name of methodism came from and it was used in terms of derision it is not something us today when one say oh i'm a christian there's a pride that goes along with that it wasn't so in the book of acts they had to hide they had to run they had to be in fear of their lives they were sought out to be tortured and the name christian was a derisive term oh now methodism back then was a derisive term they were mocking them putting them down for what they were doing but today it's name full of religious pride oh i'm a methodist i'm a free methodist i'm a grace methodist i'm uh whatever amen in that way let's back to the original back to your face back to the word of god back to the way god has called you amen the original way amen you may call it primitive but may god help us if we could just recapture primitive christianity like paul had like peter had like philip had like stephen had stand on the word of god until the crown you of life you gain amen praise god no now wesley was a very much much imbued with a vision and a call of god and the hunger to reach the lost and so he traveled to america and went to the state of georgia there to preach the word of god as a missionary among the indians but his time there was a total failure but while on his trip to america he met some people called moravians and was so impressed with their sense of peace and godliness and meekness and courage in all circumstances and so he said i went to america to take the gospel and now i return to england crying i went to america to convert the indian indians but oh who shall convert me this is what john wesley said now he's back in london back in london he again met some moravians and peter pohler showed him the way to salvation and he was truly born again to the dismay of his brother charles but lit who became angry with him but as he began to see the word of god he himself became converted by the great holy spirit amen so wesley now began to preach the word of god he began to declare the gospel in those pulpits and churches that were open to his access but after a while they soon threw him out he was put out of those churches couldn't preach there anymore wondering to know what he could do with his life but he soon received an invitation from his good friend george whitfield who invited him to come go preach with him george richfield was not preaching in churches so much he was preaching in the outdoors and thousands would come to hear him and it says to this move of god he invited john wesley john wesley was at first incredulous he couldn't believe what was happening there was the bible bible days were here again and when he began to preach and god's holy spirit began to move in such a wonderful way amen he began to see the working of the holy spirit of the living god amen and he turned wholeheartedly to preaching the gospel in the open air now the work began to take on such proportions that he began to send out a lot of his men and followers to preach the word it seemed like another pentecost was on the scene again oh god may we have another pentecost may we have another ministry of christ among us hallelujah amen the spirit of god began to raise up men overnight overnight and they began to preach the gospel doesn't tell us they went to the bible college they did not tell us they went to oxford or somewhere else but they preached the gospel as the spirit struck their soul amen hallelujah amen and the spirit began to attempt to teach them to preach the word it seems like overnight amen of course violent opposition started from the various uh powers church powers that be of that time amen and the spirit of conviction through john wesley's ministry seems like a return to pentecost the spirit began to strike the people while he was yet preaching and it seems like their knees would become weak and they would fall to the ground crying out or in distress over their sins i'm not talking now about the religious show i'm not talking now about uh copycat ism i'm talking about the genuine presence of the living god oh my that would strike the people amen and they'll fall under the influence of the holy spirit now wesley was an extremely strong man he slept no more than six hours a day he rose up and went out and preached every day as far as we know of his life from five o'clock in the morning amen and he would preach four times in a single day year after year so that we know that year after year he would preach hundred sermons or more think of it the man was anointed and blessed by god given supernatural strength to be able to accomplish this but not only that he traveled for thousands of miles and he did it on his his fateful horse of course you know one time his horse got seemingly sick fell to the ground and couldn't take him on the circuit john wesley did not hesitate he anointed his horse with oil laid his hands on the horse and called it back to to health and life and the horse rose up and wesley went on with his ministry truly a wonderful man with the miracle ministry and gifts of the holy spirit which are denied by many in this our day and in our time he sent out also many circuit riding preachers the various outstations to go spread the gospel of jesus christ hallelujah it is said he traveled 4 500 miles each year by horse think of it that was the age of the horseback uh now they had gone through the bicycle but now it was the horseback uh the other ages of the airplane and the rocket that was still to come but here it is my friends he was a believer in the power of god hallelujah he was a man that prayed for the sick and sought with great faith and received wonderful results may god help the methodists of this hour to have that kind of faith amen to believe the holy spirit and believe the living god would so stir them with so anoint them so use them like they use this wonderful man of god that god used in many of his meetings wesley saw the manifestation of the nine gifts of the holy spirit in his life which is denied or you'd be thrown out to some of those churches if you were going to some of them that call themselves real methodists they'll throw you out of there but thank god there's still a few a faithful few among the methodists in this modern age that holds to god's unchanging hands of of health of holiness of his faith of his word and are pressing on the upward way new heights they're gaining every day amen wesley was never in in favor of organization his associates did have a united society but wesley did not believe in organization this united society was a company of men having the form and seeking the power of godliness and united together in order to pray and to receive the word of god for exaltation and to watch over one another in love that they may help each other to work out their salvation with fear and trembling hallelujah now wesley recognized that after his death then the movement that had followed him would be organized and the spirit of god would leave them with a dead form i believe that has happened they've left with the form of that he left that left with the skeletons that he left but not with the meat of the uh on miracles and manifestations of the ministry that god flew through this marvelous man of the living god listen he once remarked i do not fear the name methodist that it would ever leave the earth but i fear that the spirit might take its flight oh my god i believe the spirit of the living god has taken its flight from what we call modern methodism during his lifetime wesley estude wealth he bypassed it he did not look upon it as something for him to run or chase after but he did have a saying that is known to this day to real christians he said and let me say it get all you can save all you can and then give all you can let me repeat john wesley said get all you can save all you can then give all you can oh how strange if wesley were to come back in our day and see the denomination that bears his name of methodist today they're certainly not poor they're certainly not walking away from the things of the riches of this world they are rich they are endowed with gods but as the scriptures as miserable naked and noise now that you're blind lukewarm and far from the truth that this man preached out of the word of god oh my the life and the power of the holy spirit as it was in the life of john wesley is missing in their midst today oh may god help just a few men just a few women just if some methodist somewhere because wesley would turn in his grave if he could see what he's seeing happening today oh god rise up on your generation let there be a wave of the holy spirit across the hearts of the people that they may recognize that you are the same yesterday today and forever and would return to their roots back to the word of god back to the root of david may they bear the fruits of god's word through really spirit anointed and spirit given ministry amen wesley never desired to build any work on a denominational or sectarian basis although he was an armenian in his beliefs he did not want to separate his brethren from his brethren on the grounds of the doctrines that he was teaching neither do i amen all of my brethren i'm in love with all of my beloved brothers and sisters in the various churches denominations wherever whoever they are i may not agree or espouse what they may believe or may teach but we are together brethren and we must hold to god's word and his unchanging hand amen more praise god let's base our eternal life upon god's word faith and works amen living the life of christ rather than accepting a creed a dogma or some doctrinal statement now in closing let me say to you john wesley died at the age of 88 years old after all that writing and preaching and and the strength of the man preaching living working teaching the word of god he died at 88 years old having served god as few men can or would dare to think they can and i say to you i salute john wesley god bless him god rest his gallant soul may god bless all those who follow his teachings which points right back to the bible back to the word of god back to the original faith back to the book of acts back to the upper room may the holy spirit galvanize and magnetize the mind the heart and the life and practice of many methodists may be listening to the word of god here today may god bless you my friends my brethren in christ may the great wings of the great dove of god settle upon your heart your life from this time forth even forevermore in the name of our lord jesus christ god bless you [Music] you
