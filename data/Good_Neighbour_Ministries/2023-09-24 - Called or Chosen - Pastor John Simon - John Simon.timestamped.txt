[52:39] uh we thank you for that so much amen
[52:45] as we look to the Lord Matthew 22
[52:50] verses 1 to 14. and it's speaking about
[52:55] the great parable
[53:08] at that time Herod that attract her
[53:12] heard of the fame of Jesus
[53:15] and said unto his servants
[53:17] this
[53:19] is John the Baptist he is risen from the
[53:23] dead and therefore Mighty works are done
[53:27] in Him Praise the Lord glory to God
[53:31] and we thank the Lord for that word that
[53:35] we read there and we pray the Holy
[53:37] Spirit will continue to no I'm reading
[53:40] the wrong place actually
[53:42] signs of getting older
[53:47] all right
[53:49] and Jesus answered and spake unto them
[53:52] again by Parables and said the Kingdom
[53:56] of Heaven is like unto a certain King
[53:58] which made a marriage for his son
[54:03] and sent forts's servants to call them
[54:06] that were bitten to the wedding
[54:09] and they would not come
[54:12] again he sent four servants saying tell
[54:16] them which are bidden behold I have
[54:19] prepared my dinner my oxen my fatlings
[54:22] are killed and all things are ready
[54:27] come unto the feast the marriage
[54:31] and they made light of it
[54:34] and went their ways
[54:37] everyone to his farm
[54:40] another one to his merchandise
[54:43] and the remnant took his servants and
[54:46] then treated them spitefully and slew
[54:50] them
[54:51] and when the king heard thereof he was
[54:53] angry Roth and he sent forth his armies
[54:57] and destroyed those murderers and burnt
[55:00] up their City
[55:02] then said he to his servants the wedding
[55:05] is ready but there which were bitten
[55:08] were not worthy
[55:10] go ye therefore into the highways and as
[55:14] many as you shall find bid to the
[55:17] marriage
[55:18] so these servants went out into the
[55:21] highways and gathered together all as
[55:25] many as they found both bad and good
[55:30] and the wedding was furnished
[55:33] with guests
[55:35] amen and when the king came in to see
[55:38] the guests he saw there a man which had
[55:41] not on a wedding garment
[55:44] and he said unto him friend how chemist
[55:47] Dell in hither not having a wedding
[55:50] government and he was speechless
[55:55] and when the king and then said the king
[55:59] to the service bind him hand and foot
[56:01] take him away cast him into outer
[56:04] Darkness there shall be weeping and
[56:08] gnashing of teeth for many are called
[56:14] but few
[56:16] are chosen and that is my scripture for
[56:19] today called
[56:21] are chosen
[56:23] please let us look to the Lord gracious
[56:26] father be thank you for the reading of
[56:28] the word we thank you for these who with
[56:31] prepared hearts have come to the house
[56:33] of God to receive your word for the day
[56:36] May the Holy Spirit Grant to us Grace
[56:39] and draw near to us father for being
[56:42] ourselves have nothing of our own but
[56:45] may your mind be able to flow through us
[56:48] as we surrender ourselves to Divine
[56:51] misery of preaching to the glory of the
[56:53] great name and your divine presence here
[56:57] Among Us in the name of Jesus Christ
[56:59] just settle down upon us father and
[57:02] hover over us and and and and warm our
[57:06] hearts that we might receive the
[57:08] engrafted word and to you be all the
[57:11] praise Theon and the glory that their
[57:14] eyes may see Jesus only amen praise the
[57:17] Lord God bless you all please be seated
[57:23] thank God what you have here today is
[57:26] one of the greatest privileges that we
[57:28] can ever have
[57:29] is not just a sitting church but to
[57:33] actually be conscious and aware that you
[57:36] are seated in the presence of our
[57:39] invisible King
[57:41] it is a great privilege of course and uh
[57:44] I I counted that we are alive in the
[57:47] greatest times of our lives here when we
[57:51] live here in the presence of the Living
[57:54] God because we are gathering here
[57:56] because we we're gathering around the
[57:58] world
[57:59] is simply in heaven we will gather
[58:02] around the throne uh we will be there
[58:05] worshiping singing praising God and
[58:08] giving him glory but we're starting it
[58:10] now down here so when we get up there
[58:13] it's not going to be strange for us
[58:16] because we already know and uh since
[58:20] this wonderful feeling of what it means
[58:23] to be in the presence of the Lord
[58:26] hallelujah praise God I don't know about
[58:29] you but I've come into the presence of
[58:31] God that uh if our heavenly father would
[58:35] want to reveal some more to us something
[58:39] else to us that will help us to grow and
[58:43] ripen in the presence of God and lose
[58:46] any greenness
[58:48] any bitterness any uh sourness that we
[58:53] may have in our personalities our our
[58:56] lives or our families our homes that the
[58:59] great Holy Spirit might break every
[59:02] chain
[59:03] lose every prisoner open up the way and
[59:08] that God may receive all the praise and
[59:11] the honor and the glory amen May Our
[59:14] Lives be centered around him and around
[59:16] his word that we may all grow in this
[59:20] hour when we know the Death Star has
[59:23] risen with healing in his wings the
[59:27] light is shining upon us and the mercy
[59:29] of God is moving among us to his praise
[59:33] and honor and Glory as I've said here my
[59:37] topic is called
[59:41] are chosen and I want you to understand
[59:44] who are called and who is chosen
[59:47] who are called and who are chosen
[59:50] because the Bible does immediately give
[59:53] us two groups there the called and the
[59:56] chosen this is not my saying it's the
[59:59] word and I'm just saying what the word
[1:00:02] said back then I'm saying it now for
[1:00:05] this day and for this time and for this
[1:00:08] hour
[1:00:09] amen so we are gathered here and we come
[1:00:13] here together for this one purpose that
[1:00:16] we may be certain of God and we can make
[1:00:19] ourselves assured which group we're in
[1:00:23] and we can rejoice in knowing which
[1:00:26] group we are in in the presence of the
[1:00:29] Lord hallelujah amen now in this Parable
[1:00:33] Jesus is talking about a certain King
[1:00:36] uh having a son and having a wedding
[1:00:39] supper for that son in reality he is
[1:00:44] really talking about God the Father
[1:00:48] having a spiritual marriage for his son
[1:00:52] amen and uh and is telling us the entire
[1:00:57] story
[1:00:58] in a form of a parable
[1:01:01] so using not true things
[1:01:04] to symbolize spiritual things
[1:01:08] that from the natural we'll be able to
[1:01:11] gain an understanding of the
[1:01:13] supernatural
[1:01:15] and that is why we are here
[1:01:17] you know the story The King told them to
[1:01:20] go find people because the first group
[1:01:23] that he had invited to come they refused
[1:01:27] to come
[1:01:28] they made light of it
[1:01:31] they laughed they mocked they thought it
[1:01:34] was all a joke
[1:01:35] my just think of it indeed now you have
[1:01:40] to understand that God sent a prophet in
[1:01:43] this hour with a message with a shout
[1:01:47] and that shout was to call us out
[1:01:51] praise the Lord and like I say we are
[1:01:53] not called with the shout to go
[1:01:56] wandering about we were we were not
[1:01:59] called to go wandering and wondering if
[1:02:02] this is somewhere if this is sore is
[1:02:05] that right is this right we're not
[1:02:07] called to wander we are called to go
[1:02:09] into the promised land of the word of
[1:02:12] God for this hour that is has been
[1:02:15] revealed is being revealed and will
[1:02:18] continue to be revealed as long as we
[1:02:21] are here on this earth I praise God and
[1:02:24] then it will take us out of here but for
[1:02:27] now we are called to be in the presence
[1:02:29] of almighty God Amen praise the Lord now
[1:02:34] you know how it went that they went out
[1:02:37] and they tried calling the people in and
[1:02:40] they won't come so he says go out again
[1:02:42] and now call him The Good The Bad and
[1:02:45] The Ugly
[1:02:47] call everybody in no matter what they
[1:02:51] are
[1:02:51] I am going to give them a wedding
[1:02:53] garment so they can come in
[1:02:56] in other words it doesn't matter who
[1:02:58] they are what their lies were like what
[1:03:01] they've done where they come from I'm
[1:03:03] gonna wash them I'm gonna clean them up
[1:03:06] I'm going to give them a wedding card
[1:03:08] man and I'm going to invite them into
[1:03:10] this Feast that the others refuse to
[1:03:12] come into aren't you glad that you were
[1:03:15] invited to be inside of this oh praise
[1:03:18] God hallelujah
[1:03:20] amen now
[1:03:23] the thing about this story coming to the
[1:03:26] end of it says that all those people
[1:03:29] were already told that well I'll find
[1:03:32] other folks
[1:03:33] the king came into the wedding
[1:03:37] and when he came into the supper there
[1:03:40] was a man
[1:03:41] somehow slipped in there
[1:03:44] not having a wedding garment
[1:03:46] not to go over uh Eastern polity or
[1:03:50] Eastern Customs but that they would
[1:03:53] provide you with this suit
[1:03:56] in other words you don't have to go and
[1:03:59] buy your your suit and your tie and all
[1:04:03] that stuff they were Rich enough they
[1:04:06] provided you with the suit to attend the
[1:04:09] wedding
[1:04:10] and the suits were a certain color
[1:04:14] and then when everybody should be
[1:04:17] wearing purple or whatever color this
[1:04:20] guy turns up with a gray
[1:04:23] he turns up with a gray suit on and the
[1:04:28] King says friend how how did you get in
[1:04:31] here just uh not having a wedding
[1:04:34] garment you have a different type of of
[1:04:37] suit on here amen the Bible says and
[1:04:42] the person was speechless
[1:04:45] they couldn't speak
[1:04:47] and I'll tell you why that person could
[1:04:50] not speak because they were shocked
[1:04:54] they were shocked that they were not
[1:04:58] ready for the rapture
[1:05:01] praise God they were so sharp with the
[1:05:05] word they had so many quotes on the word
[1:05:08] they were so educated and informed with
[1:05:11] the word they can bury you they can
[1:05:13] plaster you they can paint your wall
[1:05:15] with all those things and so he felt
[1:05:19] that that he had the right he should be
[1:05:22] in there he should be in there because
[1:05:25] actually he looks better in the suit
[1:05:27] than some of the people who are invited
[1:05:30] uh or who are in there but but the Lord
[1:05:34] himself says no friend
[1:05:36] that's not a wedding garment
[1:05:39] all your knowledge all your wisdom all
[1:05:42] that you covered with that is not a
[1:05:44] wedding garment
[1:05:45] the wedding garment is the one I give to
[1:05:48] you
[1:05:49] nobody else can give you that kind of
[1:05:52] wedding garment you can't dress yourself
[1:05:55] with that kind of wedding garment unless
[1:05:57] I give it to you
[1:05:59] you cannot come in to be a part of the
[1:06:02] Bride unless God himself reveals himself
[1:06:06] his word to you for you to know him in
[1:06:10] the power of his resurrection
[1:06:13] says not by human education
[1:06:16] it's not by religious knowledge
[1:06:19] it's not by length of time that you were
[1:06:22] in the message or in Christianity It Is
[1:06:25] by God's faith God's word God's
[1:06:27] revelation on his word doesn't matter if
[1:06:30] you came in in the morning and you're
[1:06:32] the last one coming in the evening he
[1:06:35] says same pay
[1:06:37] same salvation there is no bigger richer
[1:06:41] better salvation than the one he has
[1:06:44] given to everyone from Luther right on
[1:06:47] down to this hour that we are living in
[1:06:50] it's the same salvation that we are
[1:06:53] enjoying do you believe that yes sir
[1:06:55] that's what we have here Among Us here
[1:06:58] today by the grace of God hallelujah
[1:07:00] amen the man was speechless
[1:07:04] why he is thought that he was doing
[1:07:07] something right
[1:07:10] and we see understand brother bran when
[1:07:12] he says oh friends watch it there will
[1:07:17] be a lot of disappointments on the day
[1:07:20] of judgment
[1:07:21] because this man felt he was absolutely
[1:07:25] right
[1:07:27] he knew how to take that word and tie it
[1:07:30] together explain it but you know go down
[1:07:34] to the profundity of it and bring up all
[1:07:37] the Deep things and so on like that but
[1:07:40] you see they don't realize
[1:07:43] that God's depths are hidden in
[1:07:46] simplicity
[1:07:47] and they revealed again true simplicity
[1:07:52] and when you are not watching or you
[1:07:54] think it's not relevant he said watch
[1:07:57] the prophet said watch it it'll go right
[1:07:59] past you you won't even recognize it you
[1:08:02] won't even realize what's really going
[1:08:04] on Amen praise God hallelujah amen all
[1:08:09] of a sudden the king himself tells him
[1:08:11] you are wrong while he was on Earth no
[1:08:15] man could tell him he was wrong because
[1:08:18] he knew that word so much that he could
[1:08:22] bury anybody that would come against him
[1:08:24] but the king himself comes and says no
[1:08:27] friends you are wrong
[1:08:30] you are absolutely off the word you're
[1:08:33] wrong and so he was speechless he didn't
[1:08:37] know what he could say praise God and
[1:08:40] the King turned to the other servant
[1:08:42] says now bind him hand and foot
[1:08:47] don't let him run all over the world
[1:08:49] spreading the nonsense he's talking
[1:08:50] about buying his foot and bind his arms
[1:08:54] and you take him and cast him into outer
[1:08:58] Darkness cast him out out there amen
[1:09:02] praise the Lord many are called but few
[1:09:05] are chosen
[1:09:07] many are called but few are chosen are
[1:09:10] you in the cold or the chosen this is
[1:09:14] the question that is being asked here
[1:09:16] today by the grace of God hallelujah and
[1:09:20] without the opening of The Seven Zeals
[1:09:22] I'm telling you friends we would still
[1:09:25] be wrestling with the understanding of
[1:09:28] many of these things we'll still be
[1:09:30] wondering what does this mean or what
[1:09:32] does that mean but I thank God for the
[1:09:35] opening of those Seven Seals that has
[1:09:37] opened up our understanding that we
[1:09:40] might know him the same yesterday today
[1:09:42] and forever hallelujah amen now many are
[1:09:47] called called means invited in other
[1:09:50] words we will use the word you can say
[1:09:52] use the word invited many are invited
[1:09:55] amen now the gospel goes out to
[1:09:58] everybody whosoever will May Come
[1:10:01] Mania called everybody is called the net
[1:10:04] is thrown out and it goes over all kinds
[1:10:07] of fish and everybody is called many are
[1:10:10] called amen but one day you see the
[1:10:13] fisherman has to bring everything to the
[1:10:16] shore
[1:10:17] and then he opens up the neck with
[1:10:20] everything on it and lo and behold it
[1:10:24] wasn't all fish that he caught
[1:10:26] that poor Pastor that thought that all
[1:10:30] he had in there was rainbow trout we're
[1:10:33] going to find out that he had some
[1:10:34] spiders
[1:10:36] he had some crabs
[1:10:38] he had some crawfish
[1:10:40] he had some bottom feeding fish amen yes
[1:10:45] sir he had some that will eat the filth
[1:10:48] and the dirt of this world and don't
[1:10:51] want the real clean things that come
[1:10:53] from the word of God yes sir he begins
[1:10:56] to find out there was even a few snakes
[1:10:59] that were in there that almost bit him
[1:11:02] when he's trained to do his work God
[1:11:05] have mercy yes it has actually happened
[1:11:08] I know what it is because that actually
[1:11:10] happened with me and this time it wasn't
[1:11:12] a small snake it was one as fat as my
[1:11:14] arm and he just came up like that and of
[1:11:18] course I ran back you know I'm not as
[1:11:20] Brave as you but
[1:11:21] I ran back and I used a a Big Bamboo and
[1:11:26] pushed it at here but he just wrapped
[1:11:29] around it and his constriction it
[1:11:31] started to crack crack that would have
[1:11:33] been my bones if he had caught a hold of
[1:11:37] me but in any case that is actually what
[1:11:41] happened amen so many are called many
[1:11:45] are invited but chosen means elective
[1:11:50] means selected
[1:11:52] out of all the guests all of those
[1:11:55] invitees there were some selected they
[1:11:59] were invited and unselected by the king
[1:12:03] to come in Praise the Lord so let's say
[1:12:07] it this way many years are given an
[1:12:10] invitation
[1:12:12] to come to the wedding supper
[1:12:15] but few are chosen
[1:12:18] to be in The Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:12:21] Hallelujah many call to the wedding
[1:12:25] supper everybody claims that they are a
[1:12:28] part of it and they want to attend it
[1:12:31] praise the Lord now let's go to a
[1:12:34] quotation the invisible Union around
[1:12:37] page 88.
[1:12:40] brother Branham is stalking and he's
[1:12:43] talking about the book of life and stuff
[1:12:46] like that now now we are just ready for
[1:12:50] one thing
[1:12:51] and that is the coming of the Lord
[1:12:53] hallelujah are you ready for that are
[1:12:56] you ready for that I'm ready and waiting
[1:12:59] for the coming of the Lord now there
[1:13:03] there is your name on The Book of Life
[1:13:06] for the Book of Life is the word of God
[1:13:11] see The Book of Life is the word of God
[1:13:15] the and God is the only thing that is
[1:13:18] life
[1:13:19] so then you see your name is somewhere
[1:13:25] represented in that Bible
[1:13:29] it was represented in the Bible
[1:13:33] before the Bible became the word of God
[1:13:39] what he's saying there is before the
[1:13:43] Bible that was in God's mind and heart
[1:13:45] became the written word before the
[1:13:49] written word existed before
[1:13:51] King James version was written it was
[1:13:54] still the word it was always the word
[1:13:57] but that word was in the mind of God but
[1:14:00] before God allowed it to be loosed
[1:14:03] enough for them to be able to write it
[1:14:06] your name was already there
[1:14:10] we don't have to sing like a Charles
[1:14:13] Wesley is my name I already Sankey by
[1:14:16] the way is my name written there in the
[1:14:20] page white and fair in the book of thy
[1:14:23] kingdom is my name written there no we
[1:14:28] don't have to sing that amen praise the
[1:14:30] Lord like our brother saying here today
[1:14:32] he never fails me yet now it's wonderful
[1:14:36] but that was for a past age now we
[1:14:38] recognize that now we sing Jesus
[1:14:42] never fails Jesus never fails amen he
[1:14:48] never fails never ever fails so when we
[1:14:52] say it never fails me yet
[1:14:55] I'm not expecting him to ever fail me
[1:14:58] right not now nor in the future nor any
[1:15:01] other time praise the name of the Lord
[1:15:03] glory to God so it's the same thing many
[1:15:06] people are still believing wondering if
[1:15:08] their name is on the page it doesn't go
[1:15:11] like that we must come to a place where
[1:15:14] we are certain of God
[1:15:16] we are certain of God hallelujah amen
[1:15:19] that our names are in there praying the
[1:15:22] Lord now being in the message doesn't
[1:15:26] mean you are one of the Joseph
[1:15:33] being in the message let me repeat it
[1:15:36] because this is not only going here
[1:15:38] where you are sitting in this
[1:15:40] congregation there are many others
[1:15:42] hearing this and seeing this online
[1:15:45] who have believed all their lives all
[1:15:48] they have to do is get in the message
[1:15:50] just believe a prophet
[1:15:53] just believe the word and they are in
[1:15:57] and that's how they believe it
[1:15:59] but being in the message doesn't mean
[1:16:02] that you are one of the chosen
[1:16:06] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[1:16:08] amen many are called indeed but few are
[1:16:14] chosen
[1:16:15] now you must you've got to realize uh be
[1:16:20] talking go back to the seals talking
[1:16:22] about the Book of Revelation uh one
[1:16:25] through three uh there and in I believe
[1:16:28] it's chapter two you'll see the
[1:16:30] Antichrist Spirit you'll see the
[1:16:32] Antichrist spirit in there uh uh and
[1:16:35] it's riding on a white horse is that
[1:16:38] right
[1:16:39] in the Book of Revelation even if I
[1:16:40] mistook the chapter there
[1:16:42] forgive me for that but we find out the
[1:16:46] Antichrist spirit is supposed to ride
[1:16:48] and I believe he's writing right now
[1:16:51] he's writing right now and he's writing
[1:16:54] on a white horse which is a symbol of
[1:16:56] religion he'll use your faith he'll
[1:17:00] misplace your faith and he'll ride on
[1:17:03] that but really he has no real power
[1:17:07] amen but thank God we we can recognize
[1:17:11] him now because the seals are open
[1:17:14] and it reveals not only Christ but it
[1:17:17] reveals to us the Antichrist reveals to
[1:17:20] us the the king and it reveals to us the
[1:17:23] enemy that comes against us that we
[1:17:25] might know him and how to be able to
[1:17:27] deal with him for the glory of God
[1:17:30] hallelujah amen so uh I said that so you
[1:17:35] can understand a person can be religious
[1:17:39] and yet be Antichrist
[1:17:41] for the Antichrist was religious
[1:17:44] don't you know the devil is the most
[1:17:46] religious person in the world
[1:17:49] the devil is the most religious person
[1:17:51] you can think about
[1:17:53] I I quoted the scripture first John
[1:17:55] where he says even the devil believes
[1:18:00] and he believes it so much that he
[1:18:02] trembles
[1:18:03] he believes in God he believes there
[1:18:06] will be a judgment he believes they're
[1:18:08] going to be a Rapture he believes all
[1:18:11] those things and it trembles at it and
[1:18:13] you have foolish people saying there is
[1:18:15] no God
[1:18:16] and other ones want nothing to do with
[1:18:19] God nothing to do with the word because
[1:18:21] there's nothing we can see feel touch uh
[1:18:23] I'll wait there they don't realize that
[1:18:25] you are a spirit and therefore that
[1:18:27] spirit inside you worships a god also
[1:18:30] that you cannot see
[1:18:31] uh you know and and that's why the
[1:18:33] prophet said the one whom you you felt
[1:18:36] in your heart all these years and you
[1:18:38] believed one day will become
[1:18:41] personalized appear right before you for
[1:18:43] the glory of God Amen there's going to
[1:18:46] be a Rapture One Sweet Day well we'll be
[1:18:49] caught up in the presence of almighty
[1:18:51] God and we'll see him face to face and
[1:18:54] as the song says tell the story saved by
[1:18:57] grace glory be to God Amen yes sir glory
[1:19:02] to God hallelujah Seven Seals
[1:19:05] page four seven to three
[1:19:09] amen
[1:19:11] brother Brandon was asked this question
[1:19:14] brother Branham is it true that every
[1:19:18] Jew born since Christ will be saved
[1:19:22] and who are the 144
[1:19:25] 000. are they the predestinated ones to
[1:19:30] be sealed with the Holy Ghost and what
[1:19:34] is their mission
[1:19:35] amen oh my he says there's three
[1:19:40] questions
[1:19:41] in in one there but
[1:19:45] no
[1:19:47] no
[1:19:48] nothing will be saved only those whose
[1:19:53] names were put on the Lamb's Book of
[1:19:57] Life amen you believe that
[1:20:00] praise the name of the Lord glory to God
[1:20:03] Amen yes sir praise God you know why I'm
[1:20:06] looking I'm looking for the quotes put
[1:20:08] up there but the young young all of the
[1:20:11] young men are not here today so we give
[1:20:14] God praise amen hallelujah now we find
[1:20:19] that God wants you to recognize if your
[1:20:23] name is in the LA in the Lamb's Book of
[1:20:26] Life
[1:20:27] The Book of Life of course we know the
[1:20:31] Bible amen the word of God if your name
[1:20:35] is in there
[1:20:37] but you see the book of life has
[1:20:39] sections this I'm not teaching on that
[1:20:41] but now but there are sections and one
[1:20:45] of the Obscure sections is the Lamb's
[1:20:48] Book of Life right you can read the
[1:20:51] Bible all you want study it all your
[1:20:53] life and receive nothing but natural
[1:20:56] life from it other than but the Lamb's
[1:21:00] Book of Life which comes by Revelation
[1:21:02] that only comes the Holy Ghost can
[1:21:04] invite you in there only the Holy Spirit
[1:21:07] can open up the word and reveal to you
[1:21:10] what he wants amen praise God hallelujah
[1:21:14] many are called
[1:21:17] let me say it another way but few have
[1:21:20] representation
[1:21:23] many are called but few are not
[1:21:26] represent are represented in the word
[1:21:29] there are only a few a selected
[1:21:32] predestinated by the grace of God these
[1:21:35] are to be called also but praise God
[1:21:37] forevermore there's only a few
[1:21:41] that have their names represented in the
[1:21:45] book praise the name of the Lord elected
[1:21:48] to braidhood elected to the bright class
[1:21:53] of saints many Saints but there is a
[1:21:57] bright class of saints amen praise the
[1:22:00] name of the Lord hallelujah yes sir Lord
[1:22:03] praise God let's let's continue on this
[1:22:07] uh the seventh seal book here and check
[1:22:10] what the prophet of God had to say
[1:22:13] no nothing will be saved only those
[1:22:17] whose names were put on the Lamb's Book
[1:22:19] of Life before the foundation of the
[1:22:22] world you are Gentile
[1:22:25] no matter who they are
[1:22:28] you see he even said oh under the first
[1:22:31] second pull he says oh all babies go to
[1:22:35] heaven those little angels He says no
[1:22:39] but now the seals are open nobody gets
[1:22:43] in there except those whose names were
[1:22:46] written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:22:49] before the foundation of the world
[1:22:52] nobody doesn't matter because even
[1:22:55] before they're born he knows who they
[1:22:57] are and where where they're going to he
[1:22:59] doesn't have to wait for them to be born
[1:23:01] or to grow up and live and then look at
[1:23:04] their life and decide whether they are
[1:23:06] going in or not he knows before you even
[1:23:09] got here he told Jeremiah before you
[1:23:12] were even placed in your mother's womb I
[1:23:15] saw you I knew you before you got here
[1:23:19] God knows every one of us before we got
[1:23:21] here on this Earth
[1:23:23] praise the Lord you come here and he is
[1:23:27] now going to identify you of who you
[1:23:31] really are are you a son
[1:23:34] are you a servant
[1:23:36] or are you an unbeliever God is able to
[1:23:40] know that
[1:23:41] amen doesn't matter what religious uh
[1:23:44] Garb what what disguise we put on we can
[1:23:48] act Pious and spiritual and Christian
[1:23:51] and read our Bible all day and do all
[1:23:54] the fasting we want that's all good
[1:23:56] that's wonderful but underneath all of
[1:24:00] that God's spirit sees right to the soul
[1:24:03] he sees right to your entire being he
[1:24:06] recognizes you who you are amen the True
[1:24:10] Believer is not a person of time
[1:24:14] we come from eternity and we are going
[1:24:17] back to Eternity we come from God and we
[1:24:20] go back to God we come from his presence
[1:24:23] praising him singing and glorifying him
[1:24:26] and we're going back there with the
[1:24:28] presence of the Living God to glorify
[1:24:30] and praise His holy name amen yes sir
[1:24:34] just is so important to know that amen
[1:24:37] hallelujah praise God now we know
[1:24:42] friends
[1:24:44] the bride was really an average age when
[1:24:47] he said the bride is not only in this
[1:24:49] last Church age there is a bride but
[1:24:52] every age had a portion or part of the
[1:24:56] Bride because the entire pyramid as you
[1:25:00] see behind me is a symbol of the entire
[1:25:03] life of Jesus Christ
[1:25:05] it's a symbol of all the church ages
[1:25:08] it's a symbol of the Saints while they
[1:25:11] are in the time dispensation of the Son
[1:25:15] of God in time period but once it breaks
[1:25:19] past broadly kindness and it goes up
[1:25:22] higher into a higher level you've gone
[1:25:24] into the Eighth Day you have left the
[1:25:27] ages as the prophet said well in the
[1:25:30] Statue of a perfect man he says now the
[1:25:34] the seven churches are now over
[1:25:37] and now I'm looking to to see that man
[1:25:40] that woman amen that will be there after
[1:25:45] these Church ages praise God they are
[1:25:48] the ones they're going to step into the
[1:25:50] day and walk into it praise the Lord
[1:25:52] back there even Believers of this
[1:25:55] message were talking about eight day but
[1:25:58] now the prophet master plan he says when
[1:26:01] these edges are over praise God he won't
[1:26:04] even be here but those Saints are going
[1:26:06] to go right into that that day and
[1:26:09] they're going to walk in it praise the
[1:26:10] Lord a new day is here upon us brother
[1:26:13] sister I said a new day is here this is
[1:26:16] not the Moses generation this is the
[1:26:19] Joshua generation
[1:26:22] praise the Lord we're crossing the river
[1:26:26] you can only Cross by the Holy Spirit
[1:26:28] opening up the way
[1:26:30] that's the only way that you can cross
[1:26:32] the river and meet the challenge of the
[1:26:35] city of AI praise the Lord I know that
[1:26:38] AI is challenging us now in the other
[1:26:42] computer Age and and we're going to meet
[1:26:46] that challenge too by the grace of God
[1:26:48] because they come with human
[1:26:49] intelligence machine intelligence we are
[1:26:52] coming with Divine intelligence the body
[1:26:55] has come right up from the feet right up
[1:26:57] right up through the body right up to
[1:27:00] the ellipse of the speaking age of the
[1:27:02] Pentecostal age which I was a part of
[1:27:04] but then I realized this our God is
[1:27:07] marching on God is God is not a
[1:27:09] standstill God he is a god that is
[1:27:12] marching on by the grace of God and so
[1:27:15] the revelation of the word has marched
[1:27:18] on and progressed where we are in
[1:27:20] another stage now and you are not in it
[1:27:23] you are not part of it you may be in a
[1:27:25] message but you are not part of it until
[1:27:28] by Revelation the holy spirit opens your
[1:27:32] eyes and you experience a spiritual
[1:27:34] Epiphany where the spirit of God lights
[1:27:37] up the word praise God lights up the
[1:27:40] entire word praise God forevermore amen
[1:27:43] yes sir Hallelujah now I tell you
[1:27:47] friends all those that were in The Bride
[1:27:49] in those other ages not that their names
[1:27:52] were actually written down inside the
[1:27:56] Bible that you can read their name Peter
[1:27:58] Paul James Susan whatever
[1:28:01] their names weren't written like that
[1:28:04] well Prophet said it in the same seven
[1:28:06] seal book
[1:28:07] um you know I can continue to quote here
[1:28:09] but listen what he says he says here
[1:28:11] it's not like he's going to call your
[1:28:13] name Susan or James or Sarah or whatever
[1:28:17] he says but the while the mystery that
[1:28:21] your name is under is being revealed
[1:28:25] amen while that mystery is being
[1:28:28] revealed your name is being called
[1:28:32] and you see when that mystery of the
[1:28:35] word begins to be revealed like that and
[1:28:39] your name is being called then what
[1:28:41] happens the Deep crawls to the Deep
[1:28:44] praise God the Deep calls out to the
[1:28:48] Deep the word that is in you responds to
[1:28:51] the word that's being revealed praise
[1:28:54] God my goodness I'm I'm coming off of my
[1:28:57] message here but I'm talking about that
[1:28:59] Chinese uh laundry tag now amen torn in
[1:29:04] pieces Hallelujah Jesus torn a Calvary
[1:29:08] Park went up to Glory parked down here
[1:29:11] amen and now when that part comes back
[1:29:15] down Hallelujah and it comes it's got to
[1:29:18] fit together perfectly nobody can take a
[1:29:22] man-made means of carrying another piece
[1:29:24] of paper and trying to fit it it won't
[1:29:26] work it's got to be the original and
[1:29:28] that's why God says no I know what I
[1:29:31] sent down here and so when the Holy
[1:29:33] Spirit comes down amen when the mother
[1:29:36] Eagle passes over the yard she knows her
[1:29:39] daughter he she knows her son she knows
[1:29:42] her children she can identify you and
[1:29:45] you're called out by the scream of the
[1:29:47] word of God something in your heart
[1:29:49] leaps because you recognize your father
[1:29:52] is calling your home
[1:29:54] come home come home it's supper time
[1:29:59] all the ages have ended
[1:30:02] the supper is on the seven course meal
[1:30:06] of the holy spirit being revealed to us
[1:30:08] the great chef himself sharing it out
[1:30:12] glory to God Amen nobody else can bring
[1:30:16] it like that brother sister but him
[1:30:18] alone
[1:30:19] praise God Amen I'm just asking him to
[1:30:22] use my voice and use me to speak to
[1:30:24] bring this word to you because no man
[1:30:27] can interpret the word
[1:30:29] the Holy Spirit The Living Christ amen
[1:30:32] is the only one that can release the
[1:30:35] word of God to you amen yes sir God is
[1:30:38] his whole interpreter he will make a
[1:30:41] plan amen yes sir praise God hallelujah
[1:30:45] well brother Simon you said our names is
[1:30:48] nothing ever Paul's name is in there
[1:30:51] Peter's name is in there
[1:30:53] I think I read John's numbers in there I
[1:30:57] I read different why is my name not in
[1:31:01] there how come I say it again because
[1:31:04] they in the first church age their names
[1:31:07] are allowed to be in there publicly you
[1:31:09] can see them because they were
[1:31:11] ministering the word and he would
[1:31:13] recognize them there are many others
[1:31:14] were in that age their name's not there
[1:31:16] but it's because their name is hid under
[1:31:20] that mystery
[1:31:22] for that particular age amen and so the
[1:31:27] only way that you could be identified
[1:31:30] God has to identify you because you are
[1:31:33] a part of the World by the word
[1:31:37] the word identifying the word the Deep
[1:31:41] call into the deep
[1:31:42] the same Holy Spirit coming and matching
[1:31:45] your spirit because the actual fact the
[1:31:49] True Believer of why on the death
[1:31:51] Pentecost there come a great Pillar of
[1:31:53] Fire because those tongues of fire are
[1:31:56] pieces off of the great Pillar of Fire
[1:32:00] that's why the Bible says he is the
[1:32:04] fullness of the godhead bodily all of
[1:32:09] that put back together comes back to the
[1:32:11] fullness of the pillar of fire and he is
[1:32:13] all of that amen we are in him and he's
[1:32:16] in US Hallelujah and it's all together
[1:32:19] it's one thing for his glory amen glory
[1:32:23] to God hallelujah amen so God identifies
[1:32:27] Us by his scripture the scripture being
[1:32:31] fulfilled and it identifies us that we
[1:32:34] are part of that Bible
[1:32:36] amen because we are fulfilling what we
[1:32:40] are fulfilling the rest of Malachi 4 5.
[1:32:43] amen the children are feeding and
[1:32:46] feasting on a word that the fathers used
[1:32:49] to have that's been restored and we
[1:32:52] identifying Who We Are
[1:32:54] praise the lord lord of God forgive me
[1:32:56] if I get too excited
[1:32:58] I can't jump high like that old man that
[1:33:01] was a prophet talked about jumped up
[1:33:03] around the eye the rainbow click his
[1:33:06] heel drop back down and preach a little
[1:33:08] bit more but just let me preach a little
[1:33:10] more here today by the grace of God is
[1:33:12] that okay praise God Amen yes sir
[1:33:16] hallelujah amen yes sir so so when the
[1:33:21] word is breached
[1:33:23] and the The Mystery of the word is
[1:33:27] preach it sounds like a mystery but to
[1:33:30] the True Believer they are able to catch
[1:33:33] a revelation out of what appears to be a
[1:33:35] mystery
[1:33:36] they are able to catch an understanding
[1:33:39] out of that praise God Amen see God
[1:33:43] already sought all this mind and now
[1:33:46] when he sees his unfolding upon the
[1:33:49] Earth he's recognizing oh that's what I
[1:33:52] saw uh back here now watch look at look
[1:33:55] at it here it's doing exactly what I I
[1:33:59] thought it would do as she's acting
[1:34:01] exactly the way I thought she would act
[1:34:03] she's he is living the way that I
[1:34:06] believed he would live
[1:34:09] look I mean he came on the earth she
[1:34:11] came on the earth maybe they looked like
[1:34:13] a Jacob
[1:34:15] like a trickster they look like a
[1:34:17] renegade they look like this maybe they
[1:34:21] didn't have such a good time in life
[1:34:23] that's the way they look and they seem
[1:34:26] to their fellow Mortals but you know I
[1:34:29] saw that Jacob later on would be uh
[1:34:32] converted and believe me and walk in the
[1:34:35] line of my word and live for me amen and
[1:34:38] love me with all his heart hallelujah
[1:34:41] amen praise God I was talking to a
[1:34:45] brother this is I come off a little bit
[1:34:46] here
[1:34:48] um but I was talking to a brother last
[1:34:50] night and he says brother Simon did you
[1:34:52] know that Jacob was Chinese
[1:34:56] he says Jacob was Chinese
[1:35:00] very important because he was a limping
[1:35:08] see he was really limping
[1:35:13] so we recognized him
[1:35:15] [Laughter]
[1:35:17] praise God hallelujah well praise the
[1:35:21] Lord now that just is a little bit
[1:35:23] pressure off of us here
[1:35:26] we can go back to the word worthy praise
[1:35:31] the name of the Lord I told him I said
[1:35:33] brother I never heard that before I
[1:35:36] thought he was Jamaican
[1:35:38] but now you're telling me he's Chinese I
[1:35:41] know the Bible says that God Abraham
[1:35:44] said prepare a kid and bring it and go
[1:35:46] you know Jamaicans love goat meats and
[1:35:49] so God at the goat meat and he enjoyed
[1:35:51] it he had a wonderful time so I said I
[1:35:54] don't know what is Jamaican or Chinese
[1:35:56] but I know he's God and he said God for
[1:35:58] everybody and we give God the praise
[1:36:00] this was a Chinese brother anyway so he
[1:36:03] was trying to tell me that God is
[1:36:06] Chinese
[1:36:07] he said God is everything for everybody
[1:36:10] amen he knows that but I praise the Lord
[1:36:13] oh blessed be the name of the Lord the
[1:36:16] same yesterday today and forever
[1:36:20] so God already saw you believing the
[1:36:24] mystery of his word
[1:36:26] and in there when you look into the
[1:36:30] world and the word opens up you see that
[1:36:33] your name and your life really
[1:36:35] is not just in the Book of Life natural
[1:36:39] but spiritual your life is eternal
[1:36:43] your life is eternal because you are a
[1:36:46] part of him God Elohim now being
[1:36:52] revealed
[1:36:53] inhuman flesh that is why you have the
[1:36:57] desire to lift away
[1:37:00] according to the word that you want to
[1:37:02] live your thirst is to live this way
[1:37:06] other people can't understand why you
[1:37:09] want to live that way you could go out
[1:37:12] in the World and Achieve this you can do
[1:37:14] that live whatever you want but somehow
[1:37:17] you go so you know when I was at school
[1:37:19] I tell this again the other boys could
[1:37:22] in my day it wasn't nice books for you
[1:37:25] to write on we had a slate
[1:37:28] something called a slate uh right and
[1:37:32] you had to write on that slate other
[1:37:35] boys can break that slate and then in
[1:37:37] the school fights and cut the other kids
[1:37:40] fighting or chop them or split their
[1:37:43] skull or something uh doesn't matter how
[1:37:46] angry I was with anybody else I just
[1:37:49] couldn't do that something in me would
[1:37:52] just stop me I can't I can't take a
[1:37:54] broken bottle and cut some body and no
[1:37:57] you see he was always there all the time
[1:38:02] he was with you all the time
[1:38:05] the Devils maybe try to kill some of you
[1:38:08] from the day you're born
[1:38:10] the devil tried to bring you into some
[1:38:14] accident to get rid of you because God
[1:38:16] wants to use you as a vessel to express
[1:38:18] himself he wants to stop that
[1:38:22] and try to give me maybe your mother
[1:38:24] even had trouble with giving birth
[1:38:26] and and you wonder why but it's because
[1:38:29] you are one of his own one of his Chosen
[1:38:32] Few called you out that he might reveal
[1:38:35] himself through you and make himself
[1:38:37] known to a sin cursed World walking in
[1:38:40] darkness without the bright shining
[1:38:42] light of the Holy Spirit of the Living
[1:38:45] God amen amen yes sir hallelujah amen
[1:38:50] praise God I thank God that that this
[1:38:53] book amen this book that is part of the
[1:38:57] Bible but yet this Lamb's Book of Life
[1:39:00] I'm talking about is outside of the
[1:39:03] Bible it's written in that Bible yet
[1:39:06] it's it's the word Unwritten because
[1:39:10] it's the word that's living it's the
[1:39:12] word men flesh again it's the word
[1:39:16] manifesting itself as a son of man now
[1:39:19] being revealed in this hour an age that
[1:39:22] we are living in amen praise the Lord of
[1:39:24] God hallelujah if you don't understand
[1:39:26] all I'm saying pray and ask God to give
[1:39:30] wisdom and understanding amen hallelujah
[1:39:33] yes sir by revelation we see it by
[1:39:36] believing the word of God for this hour
[1:39:38] praise God the prophet said
[1:39:41] the book holds the mystery
[1:39:46] and the book is unfolding it now
[1:39:50] Hallelujah you can use the word
[1:39:53] revealing it unfolding it now it's now
[1:39:57] being unfolded now uh Naturally Speaking
[1:40:01] is like this let me say it this way it's
[1:40:04] like before the opening of the seventh
[1:40:07] seal no man could have a clear
[1:40:09] understanding of it
[1:40:11] Dr Ironside Dr this doctor that praise
[1:40:14] God and some of those names A lot of
[1:40:16] them Bollinger many many others they
[1:40:20] know all about it they wrote about the
[1:40:22] volumes and volumes of it praise God and
[1:40:25] I have some of the volumes on my shelf
[1:40:27] back there where they're just sitting
[1:40:29] there uh just for reference but the fact
[1:40:32] is no man could understand or break into
[1:40:35] those seals
[1:40:37] for the lamb himself had to take the
[1:40:39] book
[1:40:41] yes brother Branham didn't break those
[1:40:43] seals
[1:40:44] the lamb took the book
[1:40:47] broke the seals
[1:40:49] and then came down and revealed to him
[1:40:53] what was in there
[1:40:56] and he was just a voice
[1:40:59] praise God forevermore just a voice to
[1:41:03] make known to the world the word that it
[1:41:06] might flow through him
[1:41:08] that's what it was praise the Lord amen
[1:41:11] now the book is unfolding it now
[1:41:15] not each one's name
[1:41:19] but what is the mystery of the book
[1:41:23] while it is calling the names
[1:41:27] you see the names that are under a
[1:41:29] certain Revelation a certain
[1:41:32] understanding of the mystery of the word
[1:41:35] you know you know in Christianity
[1:41:39] I'm slowing up here because I I start
[1:41:42] getting so quick and that I move out
[1:41:44] there but watch
[1:41:46] um
[1:41:47] we find that some preachers and persons
[1:41:51] individual believers they just have a
[1:41:53] hunkering to hear about healing
[1:41:55] one said love to hear about the baptism
[1:41:57] Holy Ghost another set loves to hear
[1:42:01] about the love of God
[1:42:03] another set once they hear about faith
[1:42:06] some once they hear just about to
[1:42:08] Rapture all the time you see that's what
[1:42:11] uh goes on out there so God knows which
[1:42:16] mystery your name is represented under
[1:42:20] in the word
[1:42:22] and when it is time for you to be called
[1:42:26] or your name to be called it doesn't say
[1:42:29] James
[1:42:30] but it makes a preacher
[1:42:33] or a minister
[1:42:35] ordained Anointed with the word
[1:42:38] to begin to preach on that same subject
[1:42:41] on that same topic and certain things
[1:42:43] that he will be saying is things that
[1:42:46] you already had in you and was wondering
[1:42:48] about thinking about her whatever the
[1:42:51] Holy Spirit who is the discerner of the
[1:42:53] hearts and the thoughts of the minds
[1:42:55] amen he will take his word and apply
[1:43:00] that token right where it is needed amen
[1:43:03] and those personal persons who are under
[1:43:06] that seal and unfold the name that their
[1:43:09] name is in there but the grace of
[1:43:11] almighty God hallelujah
[1:43:13] blessed be his name I'm so glad I've
[1:43:16] caught of you I've got a glimpse that my
[1:43:19] name is on that book
[1:43:21] and not not I'm not gonna back up I'm
[1:43:23] not going to bend I'm not going to burn
[1:43:25] I'm not gonna move aside but I'm
[1:43:28] pressing on the upward way you hide some
[1:43:30] gaining every day amen oh blessed be the
[1:43:34] name of the Living God hallelujah amen
[1:43:37] praise God brother Simon you're old now
[1:43:39] you should settle down
[1:43:41] you should start to really lecture about
[1:43:43] butterflies and the burial of pets and
[1:43:46] that sort of decent kind of thing well
[1:43:48] I'm not used to that you know that was
[1:43:51] one thing all all the ministerial
[1:43:53] training I just you know that's in the
[1:43:56] background put that away and all that
[1:43:58] sort of stuff back to the word amen
[1:44:01] praise the Lord I never seen a man
[1:44:03] sitting on a hot stove and he just sits
[1:44:06] there and he's taking all
[1:44:08] his flesh is all being burnt up and and
[1:44:11] he sits on the stove like
[1:44:13] no he's not going to sit there he's
[1:44:15] going to jump off that stove amen praise
[1:44:18] God well I'm telling you when the word
[1:44:19] god gets in your soul and you get on
[1:44:22] fire with the Holy Ghost age don't
[1:44:24] matter the Holy Ghost will lift you up
[1:44:26] the Holy Ghost will use you for his
[1:44:29] glory praise God the spirit of the
[1:44:31] Living God quickens the individual
[1:44:33] regardless of who they are amen praise
[1:44:36] God hallelujah but when they come to
[1:44:39] themselves and they come back normal and
[1:44:41] they get cold then they feel the aches
[1:44:43] coming back
[1:44:45] that's just to let you know like the
[1:44:47] high priest God says tire little scarlet
[1:44:50] cord on their feet so that when they
[1:44:52] come into the holy of holies and the
[1:44:53] little bells you'll know if they're
[1:44:55] alive
[1:44:57] don't put any floor in on the temple so
[1:44:59] that they walk in on the dust and and
[1:45:02] when they come back out and they've been
[1:45:04] in the glory of the presence of the fire
[1:45:06] they can't think that they've been in
[1:45:09] heaven
[1:45:11] they can still see the dust is on your
[1:45:13] on your feet you're still living down
[1:45:16] here you still have dust in your feet so
[1:45:18] long after we leave this building and we
[1:45:20] shout all the Praises of God glory to
[1:45:22] God you still got to go out and pay your
[1:45:24] rent
[1:45:25] you still have to pay your mortgage
[1:45:28] you still got to face the everyday
[1:45:30] things of life amen don't get so
[1:45:33] spiritual minded as the old Pentecostals
[1:45:36] you say that you become no earthly good
[1:45:39] you see you you got to be uh like I've
[1:45:42] always said be deeply spiritual but be
[1:45:45] intensely practical
[1:45:47] you've got to have a balance with
[1:45:49] whatever you do for the glory of God
[1:45:51] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[1:45:54] amen yes sir but what the mystery of the
[1:45:58] book is while it's calling those names
[1:46:00] now I want to amplify this a little
[1:46:03] nothing will be saved
[1:46:06] only those whose names
[1:46:09] were put on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:46:12] before the foundation of the world
[1:46:14] whether Jew or Gentile
[1:46:17] that's that's all the book holds the
[1:46:22] mystery amen and the book is only
[1:46:25] unfolding it now praise the name of the
[1:46:28] Lord hallelujah but what the mystery of
[1:46:31] the book is what is the Revelation what
[1:46:34] the mystery of the book is what's the
[1:46:36] revelation of that book while it is
[1:46:40] calling those names amen hallelujah
[1:46:43] praise God and and I believe that even
[1:46:46] while I'm preaching the mystery is
[1:46:48] unfolding right now
[1:46:49] you believe that
[1:46:51] I believe it's on word is unfolding
[1:46:53] right now and and I believe that the
[1:46:56] holy spirit is calling to every one of
[1:46:58] us for us to recognize ourselves that we
[1:47:01] are a part of the word of God Amen
[1:47:04] Hallelujah and the spirit of God of
[1:47:06] course is calling your name by I repeat
[1:47:08] by a mystery and my repetition is
[1:47:11] deliberate so that we might remember
[1:47:13] that we might understand what God is
[1:47:15] doing in this hour and in this time
[1:47:19] praise the Lord now to continue the
[1:47:22] quote the book doesn't say now leave ale
[1:47:26] is to be saved in the time of this
[1:47:30] church age
[1:47:32] are that arm and Neville or whoever it
[1:47:35] is no it doesn't say it that way it
[1:47:38] doesn't say it like that see it just
[1:47:42] shows
[1:47:43] and unfolds that mystery or revealed
[1:47:47] like I said to you it shows the mystery
[1:47:50] and it reveals the mystery
[1:47:52] see of what that is and we now of
[1:47:58] ourselves
[1:47:59] see by faith we see and believe that see
[1:48:04] that is what makes you know whether your
[1:48:08] name is under that book because you are
[1:48:10] allowed to see it
[1:48:13] what's wrong with that everybody can see
[1:48:15] no
[1:48:16] when they were there and he was telling
[1:48:19] these things and the disciple says
[1:48:21] Master how should we understand what you
[1:48:23] are saying
[1:48:25] oh they're hearing the same thing we are
[1:48:27] hearing but they don't understand
[1:48:29] we see what you're saying they don't see
[1:48:32] he says blessed are your eyes that you
[1:48:35] are able to see that's not your ears
[1:48:37] that you are able to hear and understand
[1:48:39] what I'm trying to I'm saying to you
[1:48:42] amen and I say to you now blessed are
[1:48:45] your eyes blessed are your heirs blessed
[1:48:48] are they that hear the words of this
[1:48:51] book hallelujah amen yes sir well
[1:48:54] they're the ones that enter in to
[1:48:56] eternal life by the grace of God Amen
[1:48:59] yes sir o praise God God reveals the
[1:49:03] word to you glory to God by unfolding or
[1:49:08] making the mystery of his word clear to
[1:49:11] you praise God Hallelujah the same
[1:49:15] question that Jesus asked Peter is being
[1:49:18] asked today
[1:49:19] Hallelujah who do you say
[1:49:25] yes
[1:49:26] not who do you say I am
[1:49:30] but who you do do you say when I come in
[1:49:33] flesh again
[1:49:34] in a form of a bride
[1:49:37] or in bright form
[1:49:40] because remember uh both husband and
[1:49:44] wife Adam and Eve
[1:49:46] they were really one
[1:49:48] is that right
[1:49:51] and
[1:49:52] um we know that this is the hour when he
[1:49:57] the headship Jesus Christ has come down
[1:50:00] to earth in flesh
[1:50:02] is that right
[1:50:04] and he has made himself known as the
[1:50:07] word not a word but the word
[1:50:10] now she's of the same material that he
[1:50:13] is
[1:50:14] she is a part of that word of him
[1:50:17] Christ is the mystery of God now being
[1:50:21] revealed the word now being made known
[1:50:25] making itself clear by Revelation
[1:50:28] through the great teacher comforter the
[1:50:31] Holy Spirit making the world clear to us
[1:50:33] so we find out now the headship has been
[1:50:37] made known revealed and we all believe
[1:50:40] Jesus Christ
[1:50:43] is God
[1:50:45] is not a god
[1:50:48] he's not just
[1:50:50] the Mighty God
[1:50:52] a lord he is the Almighty
[1:50:56] first and the last beginning on the end
[1:51:00] Alpha and Omega they start from on high
[1:51:03] wonderful counselor amen this the Mighty
[1:51:07] God Everlasting father amen one God his
[1:51:11] name is Jesus Christ amen we believe
[1:51:14] that that's the word do you believe it
[1:51:18] hallelujah praise the Lord and we
[1:51:21] certainly believe that and we put our
[1:51:23] faith in him and he asked who do in
[1:51:27] other words when you look what do you
[1:51:28] see who who do you say I am do you say
[1:51:32] I'm Jesus back there
[1:51:35] or
[1:51:36] do you recognize the son of man here
[1:51:39] today
[1:51:40] who do you say the son of man is now
[1:51:43] now revealing himself in the form of the
[1:51:47] rest of his body
[1:51:49] which is his wife
[1:51:51] praise the Lord I think I'm going slow
[1:51:53] enough for you to follow what I'm saying
[1:51:55] which is his wife
[1:51:57] and he's now fulfilling the scripture
[1:52:00] where he's saying the son of man is to
[1:52:03] be revealed again
[1:52:05] in other words when he came the first
[1:52:07] that was the son of man being revealed
[1:52:09] but he says yes but but he's coming
[1:52:12] again so they have always looked and
[1:52:15] think it's just him 1900 2000 years ago
[1:52:18] is going to come back now and make
[1:52:20] himself known now and yes he is but not
[1:52:24] in the form he was back there God and
[1:52:27] morphe God brought himself now in the
[1:52:31] form of his own bride
[1:52:34] a many-membered body
[1:52:36] Hallelujah I said now he's in the form
[1:52:39] of a many membered body
[1:52:43] and he's expressing himself through a
[1:52:45] many-membered body
[1:52:47] and because of this the people don't
[1:52:49] realize scriptures are now being
[1:52:52] fulfilled right in this hour and in this
[1:52:55] day that we're living in
[1:52:57] just before the uh I think it's around
[1:53:00] 440 something scriptures were fulfilled
[1:53:03] when Jesus went to Gallery there and now
[1:53:06] we understand the Rapture is about to
[1:53:08] take place hundreds of scriptures are
[1:53:11] being fulfilled in this hour and the
[1:53:13] people fail to recognize the word of God
[1:53:16] being made known
[1:53:17] they failed to recognize the word being
[1:53:20] made known in the hour praise God
[1:53:22] blessing my friends God is up to
[1:53:25] something big do you believe it
[1:53:27] and I believe I'm a part of it amen do
[1:53:30] you believe that that you're a part of
[1:53:32] this I believe I'm a part of it no
[1:53:35] matter what anybody says I'm a one of
[1:53:38] the few
[1:53:39] praise the Lord I believe that praise
[1:53:42] the Lord hallelujah praise God listen I
[1:53:46] haven't preached my whole lifetime
[1:53:48] just thinking of gathering people and
[1:53:51] building up a big church
[1:53:53] if that was was the case I would have
[1:53:55] had thousands
[1:53:57] I've talked to two and I've talked to 40
[1:54:01] 000 at one time
[1:54:03] what difference
[1:54:05] and built up churches not one church but
[1:54:09] many churches
[1:54:11] and build them up sometimes 504 and then
[1:54:15] afterwards God will come and says no I
[1:54:17] want to use this as a distribution
[1:54:19] breaks it down 200 here 100 gone here 50
[1:54:23] gone there and the churches come up you
[1:54:26] know I came to Ontario here there was no
[1:54:28] church
[1:54:29] there was not a message Church anywhere
[1:54:31] and God by his grace uh raised up many
[1:54:35] churches praise the Lord by his grace
[1:54:38] remember I was young then but I didn't
[1:54:40] fully understand later on he may get
[1:54:42] known to me I said my what am I doing
[1:54:45] that these brothers will just leave and
[1:54:47] go on one with a hundred one with 105th
[1:54:50] but it was God Distributing himself
[1:54:54] and I young you know you're on fire you
[1:54:57] don't understand then Lord revealed said
[1:54:59] no sit still here praise the Lord just
[1:55:03] just just do his will praise God so now
[1:55:06] I can give God praise and glory that
[1:55:08] there are churches around the world
[1:55:12] and wake up to the fact I'm not saying
[1:55:16] for that for you to look at me because
[1:55:18] what he done is him by his grace because
[1:55:22] sometimes you say something you don't
[1:55:23] realize what you're saying and it
[1:55:24] catches and somebody's Soul they praise
[1:55:27] the name of the Lord you'll see an
[1:55:28] example brother can't read dicks here he
[1:55:30] just found one of my old messages hidden
[1:55:32] in one of the churches back there and
[1:55:35] and picked it up and started looking to
[1:55:36] it while he was just a young man and
[1:55:38] mine set the soul on fire and set him on
[1:55:41] fire and he's never cooled on up since
[1:55:43] then
[1:55:45] amen praise the Lord
[1:55:49] he goes to Montreal these preaches the
[1:55:51] word there and he saw on fire it catches
[1:55:53] the heart of brother Miguel and brother
[1:55:54] Miguel gets on fire and he's on fire
[1:55:56] with the Holy Spirit praise the Lord
[1:55:58] hallelujah and that's the whole way of
[1:56:01] the fire of the Holy Spirit that's how
[1:56:04] it burns that's how it goes on praise
[1:56:07] the name of the Lord It's not anybody
[1:56:09] coming up and say well I'm not going to
[1:56:12] believe anything you preaching until
[1:56:13] brother Joe comes
[1:56:16] I'm not talking about Brother Joseph
[1:56:18] Coleman our brother Joseph Branham
[1:56:20] but I'm just telling you some people are
[1:56:23] like that I'm not going to believe you
[1:56:25] until I hurt brother Vale or brother
[1:56:27] this or whether that they got to have a
[1:56:29] a big name recognition and a profile and
[1:56:34] lots of money back of them or they got
[1:56:37] to have influence of some nature and the
[1:56:40] prophet talks about all that he says the
[1:56:42] people
[1:56:43] move away off the world because of
[1:56:46] celebrities coming up Giants in the
[1:56:49] message
[1:56:50] caught up with all these things right
[1:56:53] last week I told you how Monkey loves
[1:56:55] shiny things right or Ravens they love
[1:56:58] all kinds of Chinese things like that
[1:57:00] but the true sons of God God hides in
[1:57:04] Simplicity and reveals himself in the
[1:57:06] same for his glory and for his honor
[1:57:09] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[1:57:11] amen glory to God I can't say everything
[1:57:14] I want to say here today but I'm going
[1:57:16] to give you as much as I can for his
[1:57:18] glory what what time is that I'm seeing
[1:57:21] there

[1:57:35] amen uh praise the name of the Lord I
[1:57:38] lost the brothers to prepare some
[1:57:39] chicken soup at the back there
[1:57:42] if you like chicken soup then
[1:57:45] they can buy some from portinos and
[1:57:47] serve it in the back but right there
[1:57:50] we're looking for red hot meat fresh
[1:57:54] caught kill for the glory of God
[1:57:57] Hallelujah
[1:58:01] you know why my thoughts went that way
[1:58:03] is
[1:58:04] um I saw on the internet
[1:58:07] they showed a short clip of an eagle in
[1:58:11] Florida
[1:58:12] and they show him coming up and there he
[1:58:16] had a shark and the shark was bigger
[1:58:18] than his size
[1:58:21] they couldn't believe that that animal
[1:58:23] had so much that bird had so much power
[1:58:26] that even though that that shark was
[1:58:29] doing like this and like that the eagle
[1:58:31] had a hold of him and when I got a hold
[1:58:34] of the word you can't take it out of my
[1:58:36] hand you can't take it away from the
[1:58:39] True Believer when he got a hold of the
[1:58:41] word amen praise God and not only that
[1:58:44] he just rose up with that eagle they
[1:58:49] thought he might have dropped it or
[1:58:50] might he have to flop them no he flew
[1:58:52] away to the mountains with that eagle
[1:58:54] where we going to feed his young or
[1:58:55] something or the other but I said wow
[1:58:58] look at the glory of God look at the
[1:59:01] power of God displayed in the ego praise
[1:59:04] the Lord thank God we can be God's egos
[1:59:07] amen and we can feed on the freshness of
[1:59:10] the word and live by it for his glory
[1:59:13] amen who do you say I the son of man is
[1:59:18] hallelujah
[1:59:20] who do you say the word is do you say
[1:59:23] it's just a message
[1:59:25] do you say it's just a message that's
[1:59:27] walking around everywhere like that or
[1:59:30] do you see who is back of the Veil
[1:59:33] of the message
[1:59:35] who is back of that clothes and that
[1:59:37] face that they used to call Jesus Christ
[1:59:40] when he tells them who is living back
[1:59:43] here the father that dwelleth in me he
[1:59:45] do it works
[1:59:46] I am that I am
[1:59:49] praise the Lord Jesus it was I am back
[1:59:52] there praise the name of the Lord
[1:59:54] hallelujah who do you say he is now
[1:59:57] because he's in this bright form praise
[2:00:01] the Lord glory to God I got a lot of
[2:00:03] preaching that I can do because you're
[2:00:04] going to say well me I got so many
[2:00:06] mistakes in my life I did this I did
[2:00:08] that I you know I feel guilty with this
[2:00:10] I feel guilty with that it's got nothing
[2:00:12] to do with him on the inside
[2:00:14] because the eagle always cleansed not
[2:00:17] the eagle but the dove clearances itself
[2:00:19] from the inside to the outside
[2:00:21] not from coming outside and then pouring
[2:00:24] water on themselves but the prophets the
[2:00:26] the difference with the with the Dove
[2:00:29] and the pigeons they cleanse themselves
[2:00:31] from the inside to the outside
[2:00:34] Hallelujah so your cleansing is coming
[2:00:36] as the scripture Paul says it work out
[2:00:40] words your salvation with fear and
[2:00:44] trembling
[2:00:45] it's not the works you're doing outside
[2:00:47] trying to make yourself clean and and
[2:00:50] washing your clothes and and doing this
[2:00:53] or that or Naturally Speaking thinking
[2:00:55] it's your Works gonna take you in being
[2:00:58] a good Christian believer dressing right
[2:01:00] we're in the right lengths we're in the
[2:01:02] the Christian uh or message
[2:01:05] um uniform on is going to take you in no
[2:01:09] no no no no no no that's not what to
[2:01:11] take you in it's him and you is going to
[2:01:14] be cleansing you all the time
[2:01:18] as you walk he'll cleanse you
[2:01:20] things are going to start dropping off
[2:01:23] they may not drop off the first day and
[2:01:25] when people walk in here with cigarette
[2:01:27] habits dope addicts or a drug addicts
[2:01:30] and everything else and it dropped off
[2:01:31] bang one day gone hallelujah praise God

[2:01:57] the son of the Living God Amen you are
[2:02:01] not
[2:02:02] the what Moses said
[2:02:05] but you are the Christ
[2:02:07] what Peter is they're telling him you
[2:02:09] are the word for this hour
[2:02:11] you are the anointed word for this day
[2:02:15] for this hour
[2:02:16] we understand it's not what Moses said
[2:02:19] and this one said and Doctor inside and
[2:02:21] doctor so and so that's good wonderful
[2:02:23] but who do you say I am
[2:02:27] god making himself known in this day and
[2:02:31] this hour hallelujah amen yes sir it's
[2:02:34] the not the Bible going to reveal this
[2:02:36] to you what I'm preaching about
[2:02:37] right
[2:02:39] he says not not even me but the father
[2:02:42] that dwelt in me he's the one that's
[2:02:45] going to make it known to you
[2:02:47] the Father the Holy Spirit the Great
[2:02:50] Mighty one is going to make himself
[2:02:52] known to you by the opening of the word
[2:02:56] praise God hallelujah okay I'm going to
[2:02:59] start trying to wind this up praise the
[2:03:01] Lord if you want to hear more that's
[2:03:04] fine but I'm going to start winding it
[2:03:06] up
[2:03:08] I know some of you will want to stay
[2:03:10] here and if I preach till midnight but
[2:03:13] um
[2:03:14] I think it's time I start winding it up
[2:03:16] glory to God hallelujah now I want you
[2:03:20] to understand here
[2:03:22] that this parable
[2:03:25] that I just uh
[2:03:27] read and talked about is really talking
[2:03:31] about
[2:03:32] the revelation of the Gathering of the
[2:03:36] guests
[2:03:38] this is not the Gathering of the Bride
[2:03:43] but guests for the wedding feast
[2:03:48] see
[2:03:49] so many are called
[2:03:52] but few are chosen
[2:03:55] many call to come to the supper
[2:03:58] called to be in other grades in the book
[2:04:01] of life whether they're going to be
[2:04:03] servants guards or or whatever they'll
[2:04:06] be there
[2:04:07] but they're not going to be sitting on
[2:04:10] the throne with him
[2:04:11] as the bride you see praise the name of
[2:04:15] the Lord so many guests are called but
[2:04:17] only a few are chosen to be on the bride
[2:04:21] now praise the Lord now if that was the
[2:04:25] actual wedding
[2:04:28] um there
[2:04:29] we understand that that would and they
[2:04:32] were thinking just is going to be in
[2:04:33] heaven that's going to happen uh but we
[2:04:36] know that that's going on here now on
[2:04:38] the earth do you believe that
[2:04:41] improving the world proving his word the
[2:04:44] old book proving his word page 54.
[2:04:48] brother Brandon brother Branham tells us
[2:04:51] clearly if you read it there he'll tell
[2:04:53] you that the wedding doesn't take place
[2:04:55] up there it takes place down here and
[2:04:57] quickly if I might say it that's what he
[2:04:59] meant when he preached all those
[2:05:00] messages about the invisible Union
[2:05:04] of of your soul with the bride of with
[2:05:07] Christ the word amen coming together
[2:05:11] that's the invisible Union that's the
[2:05:14] marriage taking place right there and
[2:05:16] then no secrets are held back from you
[2:05:19] now because now the bridegroom starts to
[2:05:22] make his word known to you because he he
[2:05:25] recognized you as his bride so he
[2:05:28] started to tell you all his Secrets he
[2:05:30] starts whispering in your ears you go in
[2:05:32] prayer and all of a sudden all of a
[2:05:34] sudden you get you might think just a
[2:05:36] thought or you just get a little whisper
[2:05:38] or God makes you know something the
[2:05:40] bridegroom is now talking to you he's
[2:05:43] whispering in your ears making
[2:05:45] themselves known by the opening of his
[2:05:47] word amen hallelujah praise God so we're
[2:05:51] sitting here getting married
[2:05:53] but God helped those guests they're
[2:05:56] wonderful
[2:05:57] but they're only there to watch on as we
[2:06:00] get married
[2:06:02] as we get married to the world
[2:06:04] they're looking on at the ceremony and
[2:06:08] and wondering how it must feel to be the
[2:06:11] bride
[2:06:12] Hallelujah and that's what's the problem
[2:06:15] a lot of people in this message are
[2:06:16] bridesmaid they're not they're not
[2:06:18] they're not the bride
[2:06:22] forgive me but that's that's how the
[2:06:25] Holy Spirit uses me see they're
[2:06:27] bridesmaid
[2:06:29] they're not not the actual bride and
[2:06:32] they just look on and serve their part
[2:06:35] and be a part of what's going on now in
[2:06:38] this day and in this hour praise the
[2:06:40] name of the Lord hallelujah so what I'm
[2:06:43] saying here is the guests are not the
[2:06:46] bride
[2:06:47] is that Claire
[2:06:49] the guests are invited
[2:06:51] but they are not the bride the bride was
[2:06:54] elected and chosen even before the
[2:06:57] wedding even called call for a wedding
[2:06:59] the call for the wedding only come after
[2:07:02] the break room already has a bride he
[2:07:05] already has a bride he might not
[2:07:07] identify her yet to you who she is she
[2:07:10] might even be amongst you right he says
[2:07:13] feed the flock of God that is amongst
[2:07:15] you amen by faith in the word of the
[2:07:18] Living God Amen say see so yeah maybe I
[2:07:21] did not identify him I must speak in
[2:07:23] tongues but
[2:07:25] he almost he didn't identify her to you
[2:07:28] praise God but God has a whole group
[2:07:32] that is brought in to what is called the
[2:07:35] message amen and they were called
[2:07:39] but were not chosen
[2:07:42] they were called but failed to recognize
[2:07:45] like the Jews the Jews were called they
[2:07:49] were called but what is their mistake
[2:07:51] they failed to recognize who was their
[2:07:55] Messiah
[2:07:57] amen that's why they have to wait for
[2:08:00] the Gentile ages to be over dispensation
[2:08:02] to be over you know and it breaks right
[2:08:05] back the Sun goes back to the East and
[2:08:08] they come back to a place where he will
[2:08:10] come again and make himself known to
[2:08:12] them like Joseph made himself known his
[2:08:15] brothers he will come back to the Jews
[2:08:17] and make himself known to them so that
[2:08:20] they will be able to recognize them and
[2:08:22] they don't have to believe what I see
[2:08:24] any man says because he himself is
[2:08:26] coming and before he comes he said
[2:08:28] Elijah Moses the chief Prophet the chief
[2:08:31] law giver and they'll break the word of
[2:08:34] God to them Prophet said in the Feast of
[2:08:36] the trumpets what they are going to
[2:08:38] receive is exactly what you are
[2:08:40] receiving now

[2:08:44] feast that they're going to be receiving
[2:08:46] amen we are in the Feast of the
[2:08:48] atonement they're going to have that
[2:08:50] Feast the word breaking to them and
[2:08:52] recognize who he is by the great Holy
[2:08:55] Spirit of the Living God amen glory to
[2:08:59] God hallelujah amen yes sir this is not
[2:09:02] going to be in heaven but it's happening
[2:09:03] right here or not I'm going to stop
[2:09:05] right now glory to God hallelujah you
[2:09:08] continue to pray for me if God wills and
[2:09:12] he wants me to continue part of this
[2:09:14] next week if not then he gives me
[2:09:16] something else and says no I want to go
[2:09:18] this way then I listen to him not my
