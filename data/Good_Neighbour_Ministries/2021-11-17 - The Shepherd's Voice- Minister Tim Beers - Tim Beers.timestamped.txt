[14:34] to uh lay upon the altar amen i know uh
[14:38] covet uh
[14:40] gave us a
[14:42] relaxing kind of feeling
[14:44] to make those sacrifices where we could
[14:46] sit on a home and you know we don't have
[14:48] to come out and that and
[14:50] but remember
[14:52] and that's all good i mean we we all
[14:55] enjoy that in the flesh right but god
[14:58] requires a sacrifice because there's
[15:00] something in a sacrifice
[15:03] that we give
[15:04] that's a blessing
[15:06] amen
[15:07] that we he made the ultimate sacrifice
[15:09] for us
[15:10] he gave everything he didn't even have
[15:13] his own life he had it right brother
[15:15] branham said to live his own life and do
[15:17] what he wanted to do get married or do
[15:20] anything he wanted to do but he let that
[15:22] goal and he sacrificed his life so that
[15:25] the gospel
[15:27] you know that that's what we have to do
[15:28] too even coming here tonight
[15:31] right feeding on the word feed it on not
[15:33] brother tim
[15:34] but feeding on the spirit of god feeding
[15:36] on the spirit of revelation it blesses
[15:39] your life
[15:40] right and then you can go out
[15:43] and be that sacrifice to the world again
[15:46] in this day and age and that's what we
[15:48] come here for not just be shown not to
[15:50] have good attendance

[19:28] john
[19:29] 10 1
[19:30] verily verily i say unto you
[19:33] he
[19:34] that entereth not by the door
[19:37] other words not by revelation
[19:39] into the sheepfold but climb it up some
[19:42] other way
[19:44] some intellectual way
[19:46] some religious way
[19:48] the same is a thief
[19:50] and a robber wow
[19:53] a thief and a robber
[19:56] but he that entereth in by the door
[19:58] revelation
[20:00] is the shepherd of the sheep
[20:03] to him the potter open
[20:07] and the sheep
[20:08] hear his voice
[20:10] and he calleth
[20:12] his own sheep
[20:14] by name
[20:17] he leadeth them out
[20:19] and when he put it forth
[20:22] his own sheep he goeth before them and
[20:25] the sheep follow him
[20:28] for they know his voice
[20:31] and a stranger will they not follow
[20:35] but will flee from him
[20:38] for they know not the voice
[20:41] of a stranger amen god bless you as you
[20:43] see it
[20:45] amen what's the so much in this
[20:47] scripture here
[20:49] hallelujah
[20:51] my sheep hear my voice
[20:55] and i call them by their name
[20:57] predestination has called us tonight
[21:00] amen
[21:01] into this
[21:03] we we call it
[21:05] we don't call it into the message
[21:06] because we can say into a church or into
[21:10] another organization but into christ
[21:13] amen because the re the message is the
[21:16] revealed word of god we're called by our
[21:19] names into this revealed word of god in
[21:22] this hour and what is it supposed to do
[21:25] produce the word again in flesh
[21:29] we're not just to listen to the tapes
[21:31] amen or we're not just listen to some
[21:34] great preacher or even anointed preacher
[21:36] around but we're here amen to become the
[21:40] word made flesh again
[21:43] in this hour in this day and if that is
[21:45] not the purpose if that is not what god
[21:48] wanted to accomplish then what was the
[21:50] message sent for
[21:52] amen so we can we can idolize uh a
[21:55] prophet we can we can lift them up as a
[21:58] god
[21:59] these things are happening i know for a
[22:01] fact that they're happening
[22:03] amen they're pla they're putting them in
[22:05] the wrong position if he was here in
[22:07] this hour he would not be wanting to put
[22:09] in those positions that people are
[22:11] putting them in
[22:12] he must decrease amen and jesus christ
[22:17] the mighty angel who came down amen that
[22:20] brother brandon machine with the wings
[22:22] in the middle coming down he must
[22:25] increase
[22:28] amen
[22:31] but jesus is saying here
[22:35] that he knows
[22:37] his sheep
[22:39] he calls them by name
[22:41] and they follow him
[22:43] and they know his voice
[22:45] i watched this video on uh youtube and
[22:49] it had it i just came across it and it's
[22:51] funny i was just going through this and
[22:54] uh they did a test they had four people
[22:57] three of them they had a the whole field
[23:00] of sheep out there
[23:02] in in a farmer's field of sheep
[23:04] and and four people were there and one
[23:07] of them was the farmer
[23:09] and the other three were strange voices
[23:12] strange people so they went out and the
[23:15] farmer told them to do a certain call to
[23:18] the sheep because every time that you
[23:21] call that certain way those sheep come
[23:25] so the first one came out
[23:27] and and they did the call and the sheep
[23:29] were down they didn't even move the
[23:31] second one same thing the third one same
[23:35] thing
[23:36] but the farmer came out and he did that
[23:39] call
[23:40] and all of a sudden you see it right on
[23:42] the tv it was amazing they all point
[23:44] their heads up they looked and they
[23:46] started coming running because they
[23:48] recognized the shepherd's voice amen
[23:52] hallelujah there's something with inside
[23:54] a believer amen that recognizes his
[23:57] voice
[23:58] and doesn't follow a strange voice amen
[24:02] hallelujah
[24:04] glory to god
[24:06] amen
[24:09] wow
[24:10] in jeremiah 29 just going to recap a
[24:12] little bit from the last service
[24:14] a couple thoughts here for i know the
[24:17] thoughts that i think towards you saith
[24:19] the lord thoughts of peace not of evil
[24:22] to give you an expected end a beautiful
[24:25] end of your life
[24:27] then shall you call upon me and you
[24:30] shall go and pray unto me and i will
[24:32] hearken unto you
[24:34] there's that word again and when you
[24:37] call to me
[24:38] and you pray i will listen
[24:43] you see the connection between purpose
[24:46] and prayer
[24:47] between god's plan
[24:49] and your life
[24:52] it's always
[24:54] good
[24:55] amen
[24:58] god's
[25:00] plan for our life is good romans 8 28
[25:05] and we know all things work together for
[25:07] good to them that love god to them that
[25:10] are called according to his purpose
[25:12] so we can rejoice when we run into
[25:15] problems and trials for we know that
[25:18] they are good
[25:20] for us for they help us learn patience
[25:23] and endurance
[25:25] amen god always gives me what i need
[25:29] not what i deserve amen
[25:33] oh thank god for that because
[25:36] if i if i got what i deserve
[25:38] i wouldn't be up here tonight amen you
[25:41] wouldn't be here tonight you wouldn't be
[25:43] listening on youtube tonight if you got
[25:45] what you deserve
[25:48] but he always gives me what i need and
[25:50] what i need is more of his word more of
[25:53] his presence more of the holy ghost in
[25:56] my life which is revelation amen
[25:59] that's what i need because you know when
[26:01] the enemy comes in at a flood
[26:03] the enemy is already here your greatest
[26:06] enemy is not the one sitting beside you
[26:09] or this person or that person or the or
[26:11] the world or things of the world amen
[26:14] your greatest enemy is yourself
[26:17] it's your own flesh amen your fallen
[26:19] flesh
[26:21] and and that that's what raises up
[26:23] against us sometimes our own weaknesses
[26:25] amen
[26:26] yeah satan does circumstances he he
[26:29] brings this up he brings that up he uses
[26:32] this person people at work he uses even
[26:35] the enemies of your own household he'll
[26:37] use your husband your wife he'll use all
[26:40] kinds of things your children all these
[26:42] things will come up in your life amen
[26:45] but god raises the standard so that you
[26:48] can live above it that you don't get
[26:52] distracted that you don't stumble
[26:56] that you can continue walking in the
[26:58] spirit because satan's objective is to
[27:01] try to get you out of rhythm
[27:03] amen out of the spirit amen
[27:06] an athlete when he's training he has to
[27:09] be dedicated for those six eight weeks
[27:11] or whatever that they're doing or the
[27:13] time that they need they need to be
[27:14] dedicated they need not to be distracted
[27:17] amen to perform the way they need to
[27:19] perform and my brothers and sisters we
[27:22] need to walk in the spirit
[27:24] amen we need to live in the spirit we
[27:27] need to act in the spirit and it's a
[27:30] it's a bad doll
[27:32] it's the greatest battle ever fought
[27:36] that has taken place
[27:38] and there's people that are
[27:40] overcoming there's people that are
[27:42] battling there's people that are
[27:44] trusting god's word his power to his
[27:47] overcoming power and their and they're
[27:49] winning
[27:50] they're winning
[27:52] they're overcoming
[27:54] amen
[27:55] hallelujah and then there's others that
[27:57] are given up they're given in
[28:00] they're making all kinds of excuses
[28:03] i you know they can be legit i saw my
[28:05] wife tonight they could be legit excuses
[28:07] but remember they're still excuses
[28:10] and excuses are of the devil
[28:14] amen psalms 103
[28:18] 10
[28:18] he had not dealt with us
[28:20] after our sins nor rewarded us according
[28:22] to our iniquities he has taken our sins
[28:25] away and removed them as far as the east
[28:29] is from the west
[28:31] i like that
[28:32] from the east to the west because
[28:33] there's no end to the east to the west
[28:37] we are free my brothers and sisters
[28:39] we are free from this body of sin amen
[28:45] has no more control over you
[28:48] hallelujah
[28:51] amen
[28:54] now we look in the scriptures
[28:56] and we look to
[28:57] brother branham here i'm going to read a
[28:59] quote
[29:00] hallelujah to get into the
[29:03] the second part of this message here
[29:07] brother branham speaking here in the
[29:09] church
[29:10] ages smear it in
[29:13] we did not become seed
[29:16] by the rebirth
[29:18] there is so much confusion out there
[29:21] amen
[29:22] and if you don't get the word right
[29:25] that's why he says if you put the cow on
[29:27] top of the roof you're gonna you're
[29:29] gonna mess up the whole picture amen
[29:32] so you have to get the word right with
[29:35] inside of you you need to understand it
[29:38] and that's that's why we need him
[29:41] that's why we need his voice
[29:44] because we can listen to so many and
[29:46] i've gone through it 30 years i've been
[29:48] walking in this word and some people
[29:50] even longer but i've heard many many
[29:53] different people preaching amen
[29:56] and and and some of it has been the
[29:59] shepherd's voice speaking to me and some
[30:01] of it's been strange voices strange
[30:04] teachings and doctrines amen and what
[30:07] that does is just like if you don't get
[30:10] the godhead right you don't get the
[30:12] baptism right in jesus christ's name and
[30:15] don't recognize there's only one god in
[30:17] three offices you'll never see and
[30:20] understand that god
[30:22] lived in flesh fully lived in flesh and
[30:25] that god wants to come again and live in
[30:28] flesh in our flesh you'll never be able
[30:30] to recognize that god in your flesh
[30:33] today
[30:34] and that's the message that's the hour
[30:36] that we're living in god in flesh again
[30:39] amen
[30:42] we did not become seed by the rebirth
[30:46] we were seed
[30:48] and therefore
[30:50] we were reborn
[30:53] for only the elect can be reborn
[30:56] bottom line
[30:58] amen so you're born again tonight amen
[31:02] not because you had some experience not
[31:05] because you came to the altar and you
[31:07] bowed down not because you even got the
[31:09] baptism of the holy ghost
[31:11] you were born again because you were
[31:13] seed of god
[31:15] and that's the only reason that you can
[31:17] be born again if that you are seed of
[31:20] god
[31:21] only a seed can be reborn
[31:23] amen
[31:26] hallelujah
[31:27] [Music]
[31:28] god by his death
[31:30] the shed blood bought
[31:33] us back he bought his own back
[31:36] he bought the back the spoken word seed
[31:40] bride
[31:41] my sheep hear my voice the word
[31:44] and they follow me the word
[31:48] you always were sheep
[31:50] you were never a pig or a dog
[31:53] turned into sheep
[31:56] and so many times satan put putting
[31:59] guilt and trying to remind us of our
[32:01] past
[32:02] and and and saying look what you did
[32:04] though
[32:05] even look how you think now
[32:08] we're going to get into the thoughts and
[32:09] we're going to get into where they come
[32:11] from a little bit here amen but listen
[32:14] what he says
[32:16] listen deep with inside your heart
[32:19] go beyond your imagination tonight go
[32:21] beyond your feelings tonight go beyond
[32:24] your emotions tonight go down too deep
[32:26] into your soul and let that word truth
[32:30] strike your soul because that's where it
[32:32] takes that's where life takes place
[32:34] it doesn't take place on the outer rims
[32:37] and the senses it does not take place
[32:39] there the truth of the word gotta go
[32:42] deep down inside and anchor there where
[32:45] you know that you and that word that
[32:47] truth that opened up to you becomes one
[32:50] in the same
[32:52] amen
[32:54] i was never a pig or a dog
[32:57] amen never
[32:59] that life
[33:01] and everything that this thing fails
[33:03] today
[33:04] tomorrow next week
[33:06] amen it's got it has to go back to the
[33:10] accuser satan amen right from the
[33:13] beginning of the garden eden it goes
[33:15] back to him
[33:16] not me
[33:18] the only way i examine myself if the
[33:20] holy ghost speaks to my heart
[33:22] and says and convicts my heart
[33:26] that i'm out of line my attitude's out
[33:28] of line or my spirit's out of line then
[33:31] i repent
[33:32] but outside of that this thing
[33:35] doesn't belong to me
[33:37] it's been it's been
[33:39] redeemed
[33:41] oh my
[33:42] you see the liberty
[33:44] and and the freedom that's when brother
[33:46] brahm said in the quote there he says
[33:47] when she recognizes who she is this is
[33:50] all part of recognizing who you are
[33:53] amen she will be invincible because
[33:56] these things that tie us down what ties
[33:59] us down my brothers and sisters what
[34:01] keeps us from going forward
[34:04] it's always that that the
[34:06] characteristics and and the attributes
[34:09] of satan that does that through the
[34:11] flesh
[34:12] amen
[34:14] hallelujah
[34:18] that is impossible for every kind of
[34:20] life produces the same kind and there's
[34:23] no
[34:24] change of species
[34:26] as we were in the thoughts of god then
[34:29] expressed in flesh there had to come a
[34:32] day where we would hear his voice the
[34:35] word
[34:36] and hearing that voice
[34:38] become aware of our father's calling us
[34:41] and recognize that we were sons and
[34:43] daughters of god we heard his voice and
[34:46] we cried out like the prodigal son save
[34:49] me o my father i'm returning
[34:52] to thee
[34:55] that was my experience when i heard the
[34:57] word of god
[34:58] amen
[34:59] i was not convinced
[35:01] to follow any men
[35:03] i was not convinced to follow any
[35:05] organization i was in the catholic
[35:06] church
[35:07] i was the head altar boy i was doing i
[35:09] could have been a priest or i don't know
[35:11] could have done anything i wanted in
[35:13] there really big organization big church
[35:16] amen but it was the holy spirit it was
[35:18] the voice of god that was calling me
[35:21] amen
[35:22] and i i can remember that voice you say
[35:25] well brother brother my brother and
[35:27] sister um you know that voice only comes
[35:31] right when you hear the prophet on the
[35:33] tapes
[35:34] that voice only comes when you come into
[35:36] the message well i'm sorry my brothers
[35:38] and sisters i'm not claiming to be
[35:40] special more than anyone else but i
[35:42] heard that voice before
[35:44] i heard that voice when i was deep in
[35:46] sin speaking to me amen i heard that
[35:49] voice many times as a childhood growing
[35:51] up and what what what turned my life
[35:53] around it started moving in a different
[35:55] direction where god supernaturally send
[35:57] me people from campbell's soup amen to
[36:00] speak this message to me is i was in the
[36:02] catholic church kneeling down on my
[36:04] knees amen after giving a confession to
[36:07] the priest amen where i had an
[36:09] experience where i felt like i was raped
[36:12] spiritually raped in there where i
[36:14] confess all my my stuff to him and and
[36:17] god would just show me you don't confess
[36:20] to a man you don't confess to that that
[36:22] office you confess your sins to me
[36:25] and before i even i'd knelt down there
[36:27] and he said say hail mary's and
[36:30] and and our fathers or whatever that was
[36:32] amen and before i could even say one i
[36:35] didn't even wanted to say it i didn't
[36:37] even understand i didn't know this truth
[36:40] but a voice spoke into my heart and said
[36:43] you will not find me here
[36:45] and every time he spoke he spoke direct
[36:48] he spoke very few words in my life
[36:52] but in all those few words that he
[36:54] always spoke
[36:55] gave me direction
[36:58] amen and led me
[37:01] you will not find me here
[37:03] oh my
[37:04] i wonder i wonder that voice keeps
[37:07] speaking to me when it when you get into
[37:09] certain things and even in the message
[37:11] amen there are certain things that are
[37:13] going on in the message certain
[37:15] teachings certain followings certain
[37:18] clangs and groups and cults performing
[37:21] in the message and the same voice is
[37:23] saying you will not find me there amen
[37:26] you'll find me where i always am in the
[37:29] word in the revelation
[37:31] amen
[37:33] oh my
[37:34] what a secret life a secret catching
[37:36] away
[37:37] jesus said no man can come to me except
[37:39] my father draw him
[37:42] all the fathers give me will come to me
[37:44] now look
[37:45] how can you say that the spirit dwells
[37:48] in you
[37:49] though you've done everything you
[37:51] thought was right
[37:53] here's your evidence whether you got it
[37:55] or not if the spirit that was in christ
[37:57] is in you it also quickens the word
[38:01] to you
[38:02] for he is the word
[38:05] amen
[38:06] and if it's contrary it will quicken you
[38:09] away from the word
[38:12] then it isn't the spirit of christ
[38:15] for my sheep hear my voice and they
[38:18] shall live by every word
[38:22] brother is speaking here in the horizon
[38:24] of the son
[38:25] they shall live by every word
[38:29] they can you can only live by every word
[38:32] amen unless christ is living inside of
[38:35] you
[38:36] amen there's no way that's where people
[38:38] try to put on works
[38:40] amen legalism comes into play do's and
[38:44] don'ts you've got to live by the word
[38:47] you got to live by i know i just read it
[38:49] to you you got to live by every word but
[38:52] i cannot live by every word on my own
[38:56] my own self my own strength my own
[38:58] abilities but the holy ghost amen the
[39:02] the voice that spoke to me the
[39:03] revelation that came into me the new
[39:05] birth that he gave me by waking up the
[39:08] seed will
[39:09] live
[39:11] by every word all i need to do
[39:14] is yield myself
[39:16] amen

[39:19] job every night every day yield yourself
[39:22] to the holy ghost amen

[39:27] know that the spirit of god is speaking
[39:29] to you amen things of your flesh amen do
[39:33] the opposite
[39:34] i wonder if we stop doing that brother
[39:36] branson said when the devil comes and
[39:38] tries to tempt you in this way talk to
[39:40] you in this way persuade you to to yield
[39:43] to your weaknesses yield to the
[39:46] sin in your life
[39:48] to do the opposite
[39:50] we can't stop doing the opposite my
[39:52] brothers and sisters you say that the
[39:55] angels told brother brown and press on
[39:57] press on you don't know what's laying
[40:00] ahead of you amen and brother branham

[40:10] weak you're strong in the lord keep
[40:13] pressing on
[40:15] making that choice in that decision amen
[40:18] to follow
[40:21] let's go to slide three
[40:26] when we were born
[40:29] there is no one
[40:31] who teaches a baby how to hear
[40:35] that you can go to school
[40:37] teach a kid
[40:38] growing up
[40:40] right a lot of different things but

[41:07] too many trying to teach people or amen
[41:10] with education into this kingdom of god

[41:16] it's automatically in you to hear his
[41:19] voice automatically in you
[41:22] to see
[41:23] his word by faith
[41:26] so stop looking to a ministry stop
[41:28] looking to a man

[41:32] to preach the word for the spirit of god
[41:35] to use yes that is true
[41:37] to edify you in faith and strength amen
[41:41] but they can never man can never do the
[41:44] work that god needs to do
[41:46] god before the foundation of the world
[41:48] set his plan and orders plant a
[41:50] salvation in order and he placed an
[41:52] attribute a seed inside of you that he
[41:54] would wake that up one day
[41:56] and give it the new birth
[41:58] and then when that new birth comes
[42:00] you're automatically going to recognize
[42:02] his voice
[42:03] you're automatically going to see his
[42:05] word unfold to you

[42:20] so is preaching
[42:21] man that guy's anointed and maybe true

[42:33] amen because i can go down there lots of
[42:36] rain lots of thought you know lots of
[42:38] thunder lots of thing but no no rain

[42:55] right
[42:56] and i'll grow up uh if i miss this
[42:59] preacher i miss that preacher or
[43:01] whatever amen
[43:03] i'm not worried about those things amen
[43:05] if god led me this far and he took most
[43:09] of you out of a life of sin
[43:12] corruption darkness
[43:14] evilness drugs alcohol sex
[43:18] and he led you to this word
[43:20] can he not lead you all the way oh yes
[43:23] yes he can lead me he started to work
[43:26] inside of me i know he has
[43:28] i know he has started to work inside of
[43:31] me and i know he can finish that work
[43:34] because i know what's impossible with
[43:37] man is possible with god and everything
[43:40] is possible to them that believe amen
[43:43] and i can't help but believe him
[43:46] hallelujah
[43:48] amen
[43:51] hallelujah
[43:53] amen when you are born again no one has
[43:56] to teach you how to hear god's voice
[43:59] amen his voice
[44:01] can sound like the still small waters
[44:03] or the still small voice or in the book
[44:06] of revelation his voice sounds like the
[44:08] voice of many waters
[44:10] amen
[44:11] that will speak to your life
[44:14] and there are there are three voices
[44:16] that will try to get your attention in
[44:18] this life amen
[44:21] now if you look right there just before
[44:22] i move on
[44:24] uh um
[44:26] still
[44:27] small water still small voice
[44:30] and the voice of many waters amen
[44:33] now god
[44:34] god planned and i've been going through
[44:37] this that that that we just don't hear
[44:41] god's voice through the through brother
[44:43] branham's tapes
[44:44] because the purpose of the message amen
[44:48] even brother branham said it himself in
[44:50] the church ages was that the voice would
[44:53] get inside of her
[44:56] the voice is inside of the bride
[44:59] amen in this last days she will be the
[45:02] final voice to the final age that we are
[45:06] living and i believe it's now
[45:09] amen that voice is inside of her now and
[45:13] brother brown said when that word of god
[45:15] gets inside of her amen and has the
[45:18] preemis inside of her life a surrendered
[45:20] yielded life to god
[45:22] not their own ways and their own
[45:25] interpretations but to god amen you put
[45:29] the word of god upon their lips it's
[45:31] like deity speaking again out of who
[45:35] who's he talking about
[45:38] himself no he was talking about the
[45:40] bride of jesus christ
[45:42] what was the purpose brother brown said
[45:44] of the story of eliezer amen abraham
[45:48] sent out alieser tell me more what is
[45:52] isaac really look like what is the
[45:54] purpose of eliezer amen
[45:57] to take the position of isaac
[46:00] to marry rebecca
[46:03] no
[46:04] to bring
[46:06] amen eliezer to rebecca to introduce the
[46:10] the husband and wife together
[46:14] oh my
[46:18] three voices that try to distract you
[46:22] the satanic voice
[46:24] always speaking against the word of god
[46:27] the secular voice
[46:29] that means attitudes activities or other
[46:32] things that have no religious or
[46:34] spiritual base
[46:37] the spirit of god's word in john 14 26
[46:40] the holy spirit will guide you and lead
[46:43] you into all truth
[46:46] so these are the voices amen that will
[46:48] try to pull on us
[46:50] therefore when you want to hear god's
[46:53] voice
[46:54] you tune in to
[46:57] multiple spontaneous or flowing thoughts
[47:01] of god's word coming into you
[47:04] that's god speaking by his word into you
[47:08] even satan's thoughts come
[47:10] to us spontaneous thoughts too
[47:14] which is why we are commanded to take
[47:17] every thought
[47:19] captive
[47:21] second corinthians 10 5. amen because
[47:25] we we see here
[47:27] that we have spontaneous thoughts of
[47:29] god's word
[47:31] uh moving and scriptures moving things
[47:35] coming within us and speaking to us but
[47:37] at the same time we have spontaneous
[47:40] evil thoughts trying to take us away
[47:42] from the word amen
[47:44] hallelujah god calling you to a deeper
[47:46] walk calling you to a deeper prayer life
[47:49] amen and then thoughts taking you away
[47:52] using the three voices there the satanic
[47:55] voices trying to take you away making
[47:57] you feel guilty unworthy amen the
[48:00] secular voices of the world the
[48:02] attractions of the world the things of
[48:03] the world speaking to you trying to take
[48:05] you away from what god is calling you to
[48:08] do
[48:11] spontaneous thoughts
[48:13] and you have to rightfully divide the
[48:15] truth that's why it says in the
[48:16] scriptures you've got to bring every
[48:18] thought my brothers and sisters
[48:21] how can i do that the holy spirit does
[48:23] it
[48:24] holy spirit does it
[48:27] i'm not i'm not training or teaching
[48:29] anybody here tonight how to bring every
[48:31] thought captive to the holy spirit
[48:33] but the scripture says it
[48:35] so the scripture will do it the holy
[48:36] spirit will do it it's the holy spirit
[48:38] that goes into the word and fulfills the
[48:40] word not men
[48:42] not your ability not your carnal mind
[48:44] holy spirit gets into the word so the
[48:46] holy spirit says bring every thought
[48:48] captive amen and then when it when after
[48:51] you bring every thought captive to the
[48:53] word of god then here you are discerning
[48:56] the lord's body discerning god's
[48:59] thoughts in your life you need to
[49:01] discern the lord's body for your own
[49:03] life you need to discern how god is
[49:05] leading you amen and when god's spirit
[49:08] is leading you into prayer leading into
[49:11] a deeper walk a deeper consecration you
[49:13] need to discern that and and kick out
[49:16] the evil
[49:18] amen cast out the evil one out of our
[49:20] lives amen we still got to do that
[49:23] saints we still got to cast him out
[49:26] we still got to take the word of god our
[49:29] authority in the word and cast them out
[49:32] we still got to bind spirits we still
[49:34] got to bind their activities they're not
[49:37] going to stop you can stop all you want
[49:40] you can make a a a a sanction or a
[49:44] what's the word uh um
[49:46] uh agreement with uh with the devil all

[49:52] or you leave me alone devil you you you
[49:54] get off my back devil and you know what

[50:03] life amen
[50:04] you can make that that that
[50:06] treaty with the devil all you want but
[50:08] i'm telling you right now
[50:10] he's he's the guy that makes you do the
[50:12] crime and he's the one that calls the
[50:13] cop on you amen and he's going to come
[50:16] right back around and still try to
[50:17] destroy your life so settle it my
[50:19] brothers and sisters settle it now amen
[50:22] that you got an enemy and you need to
[50:24] attack that enemy amen every time he
[50:27] pops his head up like the rabbit out of
[50:29] the hall you need to shoot him down by
[50:32] the word of god take the word that's
[50:34] been revealed to you take the word that
[50:36] god has shown you in your life he's
[50:38] given you a vision of where he wants you
[50:40] to walk amen where he wants you to lead
[50:43] your life
[50:46] and anything contrary to that
[50:48] cast it down

[50:52] amen
[50:54] hallelujah
[50:57] glory to god slide 4.

[56:55] breaking in and catching some victory
[56:57] over these 40 days of purpose the
[56:59] momentum that the spirit has given don't
[57:01] look at anything else look at what the
[57:03] spirit is doing and what the spirit has

[57:12] according to their own experience amen
[57:14] stirring up our lives i mean it's
[57:16] stirring up my life it's stirring it up
[57:18] to and all all when god stirs up my life
[57:21] it doesn't make me wanna you know become
[57:24] more like the world or make me uh have
[57:27] my own ambitions or make me do my own
[57:29] thoughts when when god stirs up my life
[57:32] amen it it draws me closer to him to be
[57:36] more consecrated to be more dedicated to
[57:38] go back to that love of god amen
[57:42] hallelujah you only know what i'm
[57:44] talking about if you experience that
[57:46] love of god amen breaking through into
[57:48] his presence and that's what he's saying
[57:50] here many times god calls us the prayer
[57:52] amen and and we say a little prayer amen
[57:56] thank you jesus we read a scripture and
[57:58] say oh jesus wept and that's it for the
[58:00] day that ain't going to do it my
[58:02] brothers and sisters that ain't going to
[58:04] produce the life that is needed in this
[58:06] hour to overcome the enemy to overcome
[58:08] this age the darkness that is here
[58:12] it's not good enough
[58:14] how many and i judge myself
[58:16] in this category
[58:18] how many of you have broken through in
[58:20] prayer where you enter into that other
[58:22] dimension you know when they break space
[58:24] they break that the atmospheres of space
[58:27] and then when they get there there's
[58:28] floating
[58:29] and they're just
[58:31] floating up there's peace up there well
[58:34] it's only a type of what you do when you
[58:36] break through
[58:37] amen you got to pray my brothers and
[58:39] sisters you got to pray you got to turn
[58:41] off your phone you got to turn off all
[58:43] distractions you got to get away from
[58:45] things sometimes i know we have to work
[58:47] we have busy lives sometimes but you
[58:50] have to you have to you have to do this
[58:53] you have to get away and and make that
[58:56] time where you shut everything out no
[58:58] matter what
[58:59] and break through and get into that
[59:02] other dimension
[59:03] and when you break in i've been there
[59:05] many many times by myself i've been many
[59:07] times with believers we break into that
[59:09] dimension the next thing you know once
[59:11] you break through whether it takes a
[59:12] half an hour whether it takes an hour
[59:14] you sit there and i'm telling you
[59:16] everything is clear
[59:18] you know what to pray for you know what
[59:20] to speak for god will show you your life
[59:23] he'll show you your kid's life he'll
[59:25] show you the church he'll show you in
[59:27] that dimension he'll show you everything
[59:29] he needs to show you and then you just
[59:31] it's so sweet
[59:33] when you get into that dimension and you
[59:35] start when you start praying it's sweet
[59:37] it's not bothering it's not tired it's
[59:40] not like whoa my you know i've been
[59:42] praying for like uh an hour and a half
[59:44] now if you're still conscious of the
[59:46] time that you're praying and what you're
[59:49] praying then you haven't broke through
[59:51] yet you haven't broke through in that
[59:53] dimension amen
[59:54] and that's why jesus went many times off
[59:57] to pray let's go on here amen we'll get
[1:00:00] right into it so faith comes by hearing
[1:00:02] the word of god
[1:00:04] in john 10.
[1:00:05] behold i stand at the door and i knock
[1:00:08] if any man hear my voice and open the
[1:00:11] door i will come in to him and i will
[1:00:14] sup with him and he with me revelations
[1:00:17] 3 20. that's still the same today my
[1:00:19] brothers and sisters he is still
[1:00:22] knocking on our doors in all these areas
[1:00:24] amen he might not be knocking to reveal
[1:00:27] that you know the message to you or the
[1:00:29] new birth to you but he's still knocking
[1:00:32] and knocking in areas of your life to
[1:00:34] draw you closer into him not realizing
[1:00:37] my brothers and sisters when you
[1:00:39] surrender to that the very victory that
[1:00:42] you're looking for the very thing that
[1:00:44] you're looking for to overcome in your
[1:00:45] life lies behind that door
[1:00:49] that you need to open
[1:00:52] it lies behind that door
[1:00:56] whatever you're struggling with
[1:00:59] hallelujah this is what makes our faith
[1:01:02] different
[1:01:03] from every other storyline in the world
[1:01:06] god says you're a sinner you deserve
[1:01:08] punishment you deserve hell
[1:01:10] but i'm the good god i'm the good
[1:01:12] shepherd i love you
[1:01:14] i am the i'm also the holy and just
[1:01:17] god
[1:01:18] paid for your sins
[1:01:20] so that so here
[1:01:22] the deal
[1:01:24] i do i do it i pay for your sins
[1:01:28] i will come to the earth as the son of
[1:01:30] god jesus christ i will die for your
[1:01:31] sins
[1:01:33] you're not dying for mine
[1:01:35] i'm dying for yours
[1:01:37] god doesn't have any sin
[1:01:39] this is the gospel this is the king's
[1:01:41] sacrifice
[1:01:43] himself for his people
[1:01:45] amen the shepherd sacrificing himself
[1:01:48] for the sheep
[1:01:49] where do you find out there
[1:01:52] out there do you think that any shepherd
[1:01:54] will sacrifice themselves for any of
[1:01:57] their sheep
[1:01:58] you say brother that's that's natural
[1:02:00] that's that's crazy how can a human
[1:02:02] being
[1:02:03] sacrifice himself for a sheep an animal
[1:02:08] it's not crazy my brothers and sisters
[1:02:11] if you look at it through the eyes of
[1:02:13] god and who we were in
[1:02:16] in sinful lives in this flesh amen
[1:02:19] that's what really happened
[1:02:22] the shepherd
[1:02:24] the god of glory the king of glory
[1:02:27] sacrificed for his sheep us who were no
[1:02:30] good who didn't deserve anything he laid
[1:02:33] down his life
[1:02:35] the same even greater than the natural
[1:02:41] slide five
[1:02:45] here's the mind-blowing thing
[1:02:47] not only did jesus die
[1:02:50] to pay for our sins that's good enough
[1:02:52] right
[1:02:54] there
[1:02:55] but he has another thing he does
[1:02:58] in that there is the great exchange
[1:03:02] he imputes his goodness he imputes his
[1:03:06] goodness inside of you his life inside
[1:03:08] of you
[1:03:09] he takes all the bad out all the sin out
[1:03:12] and he puts all the good the word of god
[1:03:15] in
[1:03:17] hallelujah it's a blood transfusion
[1:03:21] that he is doing this is the great
[1:03:23] exchange
[1:03:25] my
[1:03:27] there is so much that
[1:03:29] he has done
[1:03:32] for us
[1:03:34] oh my
[1:03:35] but you wonder why brother branham cried
[1:03:37] out in the spirit so many times
[1:03:39] why shouldn't we live for him
[1:03:41] why shouldn't we give ourselves to him
[1:03:44] why shouldn't we sacrifice ourselves for
[1:03:46] him and what he's done for us amen
[1:03:50] hallelujah
[1:03:52] look at the next verse in the bible
[1:03:54] second corinthians chapter 5 21. god
[1:03:58] took the sinless christ
[1:04:01] he never done anything wrong and he
[1:04:03] poured
[1:04:04] into him our sins jesus takes the guilt
[1:04:07] from
[1:04:08] every rape every murder every gossip
[1:04:11] every lie
[1:04:13] every molestus evil spirit
[1:04:16] every tax invasion
[1:04:18] everything done wrong
[1:04:21] ever in history
[1:04:23] god took the sinless christ and poured
[1:04:26] himself
[1:04:27] into him
[1:04:29] for our sins
[1:04:30] all the sins of the world
[1:04:33] then here is the unbelievable part
[1:04:36] then in exchange he pours god's own life
[1:04:41] into us are you kidding me
[1:04:43] when god looks at you he doesn't see
[1:04:46] your sin he sees the blood
[1:04:49] he sees the life of christ he takes all
[1:04:52] the bad out then he puts all the good in
[1:04:55] that is the great exchange
[1:04:58] that took place in your life when you
[1:05:00] were born again
[1:05:01] amen abraham had to believe just what
[1:05:05] that voice told him and we are abraham's
[1:05:09] seed
[1:05:10] he staggered not at the promise of god
[1:05:12] through unbelief but was strong given
[1:05:14] praise to god knowing that he was able
[1:05:17] to perform what he promised
[1:05:19] notice this
[1:05:21] something you possess
[1:05:23] it's not an imagination
[1:05:26] you really have it
[1:05:29] it's not
[1:05:30] it's just as real to you
[1:05:33] it's just as real to you as you know
[1:05:35] you're riding in your automobile here
[1:05:37] tonight
[1:05:38] it's just as real to you as you're
[1:05:40] sitting in the church
[1:05:42] it's just as real as you hear my voice
[1:05:46] it's a substance
[1:05:48] it's not an imagination
[1:05:50] it's not an emotion
[1:05:52] but something that you have
[1:05:55] and it comes by here in the word of god
[1:05:58] and that only
[1:06:01] where your faith then is not in some
[1:06:04] individual it's not in a man
[1:06:06] it's not an organization it's not in a
[1:06:09] group of people it's in god because god
[1:06:13] is the word my brothers and sisters it's
[1:06:16] not an imagination
[1:06:19] it's not an emotion it's not feelings
[1:06:22] this goes deeper
[1:06:24] it's something that you know no matter
[1:06:26] what condition that you're in tonight
[1:06:30] what you're feeling what your emotion
[1:06:32] level is tonight amen
[1:06:35] is something that you possess that is
[1:06:37] real
[1:06:39] you know you possess it
[1:06:42] you know you have it tonight
[1:06:45] real in your life
[1:06:48] and if it's not real
[1:06:50] and if you don't know you have it and
[1:06:52] you don't know you possess it
[1:06:54] it's the time and it's the hour to seek
[1:06:57] and you shall find knock and shall be
[1:07:00] open
[1:07:01] amen
[1:07:02] god does not withdraw nobody he said
[1:07:05] those who are hungered and thirsting for
[1:07:08] righteousness amen
[1:07:10] come
[1:07:11] come unto me those who have elated in
[1:07:13] burden
[1:07:14] come unto me pray unto me
[1:07:18] hallelujah
[1:07:19] my brothers and sisters preachers are
[1:07:21] preaching the true gospel of jesus
[1:07:23] christ all around the world

[1:07:29] lael c and lukewarm spirit age we're all
[1:07:32] here fighting tonight i can see we're
[1:07:35] fighting it but i know deep down in your
[1:07:36] heart a true believer deep down in your
[1:07:38] heart amen you're you're craving that
[1:07:41] word you're craving the spirit of god
[1:07:43] but we're all fighting this elements
[1:07:45] here amen
[1:07:46] hallelujah
[1:07:48] amen
[1:07:51] that's why ii corinthians says casting
[1:07:53] down imagination
[1:07:54] and every high thing that exalted itself
[1:07:56] against the knowledge
[1:07:58] of god
[1:07:59] and bring every captive under obedience
[1:08:03] to christ
[1:08:05] here it goes again bring every thought
[1:08:06] captive to obedience to christ
[1:08:10] everything that exalted itself above god
[1:08:12] amen pride
[1:08:14] selfishness
[1:08:15] your own wants
[1:08:17] your own needs
[1:08:18] amen
[1:08:20] so many things
[1:08:21] slide six
[1:08:24] obedience
[1:08:26] the bible says it's better than
[1:08:27] sacrifice
[1:08:29] some people want god to speak to them
[1:08:33] when they haven't done
[1:08:35] what god already told them to do
[1:08:38] that's a big thing my brothers and
[1:08:40] sisters
[1:08:41] speak my lord speak my lord
[1:08:44] speak into my life i need you to speak i
[1:08:46] need you to speak

[1:08:57] crying the same cry
[1:08:59] speak to me my lord speak to me
[1:09:02] and god is saying
[1:09:04] when you obey what i've already spoken
[1:09:06] to you
[1:09:09] then i'll speak
[1:09:11] wow
[1:09:13] that's a big one my brothers and sisters
[1:09:15] you ever heard the saying go back to
[1:09:17] where you left jesus
[1:09:19] amen
[1:09:21] hey you have to judge that for yourself
[1:09:23] examine yourself to see if you're in the
[1:09:24] faith amen judge your own heart judge
[1:09:27] your own experience

[1:09:52] where i'm praying about things and i'm
[1:09:54] seeing things i'm seeing attacks all
[1:09:56] over the place and i'm praying for a
[1:09:58] breakthrough in a lot of different areas
[1:10:00] and i get down and i start praying and
[1:10:03] all of a sudden this thing just comes
[1:10:04] over softly
[1:10:07] and all so many times before
[1:10:11] i've looked at that stuff say ah
[1:10:13] that's
[1:10:14] nothing
[1:10:16] oh that's probably my thoughts
[1:10:20] oh that's so simple why do i have to do
[1:10:22] that
[1:10:24] who are you who are you to judge
[1:10:26] who am i to judge
[1:10:28] why god does what he does
[1:10:30] you know some of the greatest
[1:10:32] deliverance and the greatest miracles
[1:10:34] that took place
[1:10:36] were the simple things
[1:10:39] the foolish things that people have done
[1:10:41] out of obedience to god
[1:10:45] listen god hid in his simplicity and
[1:10:46] revealed in the same my brothers and
[1:10:48] sisters
[1:10:49] watch those simple things that cross
[1:10:51] over you
[1:10:53] you got you got a simple thought that oh
[1:10:55] something that you did or whatever long
[1:10:58] time ago or god wanted you to do a long
[1:11:00] time ago wanted you to say this or do
[1:11:02] this or or make this writer do that or
[1:11:04] do whatever it is my brothers and
[1:11:06] sisters
[1:11:07] just look at it when you're in prayer
[1:11:08] and that if that thing comes back and it
[1:11:10] keeps coming back to you you know what
[1:11:13] act upon it
[1:11:15] i know the spirit
[1:11:17] i know
[1:11:18] if you want to say it's not this way but
[1:11:20] the only way i can explain it as a human
[1:11:22] being i know the feeling
[1:11:24] of god's thoughts when they come
[1:11:26] when the spirit comes and he reveals and
[1:11:28] god speaks he god has a tone
[1:11:31] a sweet loving tone in his voice and
[1:11:34] when he speaks to you you know it washes
[1:11:37] over you
[1:11:39] you know that tone
[1:11:42] it's different than man's tone
[1:11:44] it's different than man's rebuke
[1:11:47] man can rebuke you
[1:11:49] but when god does there's a different
[1:11:51] tone to it there's a love tone to it
[1:11:55] even though it hurts it it's still
[1:11:58] the love behind it
[1:12:00] is comforting
[1:12:02] amen
[1:12:06] so philip obeys
[1:12:09] as he walks along the road he sees a man
[1:12:11] in the chariot on his way
[1:12:15] the man just happens to be
[1:12:17] a treasure of the queen of ethiopia
[1:12:21] he has been to jerusalem
[1:12:23] to worship and now he's trying to read
[1:12:26] in isaiah the scroll while he's bouncing
[1:12:29] up and down in his chariot
[1:12:31] philip doesn't know this yet
[1:12:35] but he is sharp
[1:12:37] observation
[1:12:40] he knows the spirit
[1:12:43] he knows how to listen
[1:12:46] to the spirit
[1:12:48] the spirit told philip go to the chariot
[1:12:52] and stay near it acts
[1:12:55] 8 29
[1:12:57] catch up to it
[1:13:00] philip does
[1:13:02] exactly
[1:13:04] an assistance to the situation
[1:13:07] with the help of the spirit
[1:13:09] and you know what happened
[1:13:11] he led
[1:13:13] the man
[1:13:14] to christ
[1:13:16] why
[1:13:17] because philip
[1:13:19] was obedient to the spirit philip
[1:13:22] knew how to listen to the spirit
[1:13:25] he knew he was always paying attention
[1:13:28] to the spirit
[1:13:29] always listening for the spirit
[1:13:32] hallelujah
[1:13:34] what does obedience bring to your life
[1:13:36] my brothers and sisters
[1:13:38] it brings clarity of mind
[1:13:41] how many times we struggle with fog in
[1:13:44] our mind confusion in our mind
[1:13:46] amen god satan is the author of
[1:13:49] confusion
[1:13:52] it brings wisdom
[1:13:54] it brings the guided hand of god in your
[1:13:57] life
[1:13:58] it helps you recognize the voice of the
[1:13:59] holy spirit
[1:14:01] it brings peace of mind
[1:14:03] obedience brings all these things it
[1:14:05] brings deliverance
[1:14:08] in our lives
[1:14:10] hallelujah
[1:14:11] amen
[1:14:13] let me move along quick i don't have
[1:14:14] much left here
[1:14:16] the bible says satan is not afraid of
[1:14:19] your plans
[1:14:20] satan is not afraid of your schemes
[1:14:22] satan is not afraid of your budget or
[1:14:25] your strategy
[1:14:26] satan is not afraid of your programs
[1:14:29] but he's scared to death of your prayers
[1:14:33] then brother branham say
[1:14:35] that the weakest christian gets on their
[1:14:37] knees
[1:14:41] all of hell shakes
[1:14:44] we've been hearing it over and over in
[1:14:45] these 40 days of prayer
[1:14:48] if prayer brings blessings
[1:14:50] then why don't we pray
[1:14:52] pray
[1:14:53] i don't know how to pray
[1:14:55] ask the holy spirit to teach you how to
[1:14:57] pray
[1:14:58] get together with people that want to
[1:15:00] pray
[1:15:02] that know how to pray
[1:15:04] amen read the psalms
[1:15:07] read the proverbs
[1:15:10] read the bible
[1:15:12] it'll teach you how to pray
[1:15:15] amen
[1:15:16] hallelujah
[1:15:20] god is saying
[1:15:21] prayer
[1:15:23] is a big part
[1:15:25] it's not the part it's not the evidence
[1:15:28] but prayer is a big part that's going to
[1:15:30] bring
[1:15:31] this rapture on
[1:15:33] prayer is a big part that's going to
[1:15:35] bring deliverance in your life
[1:15:37] breakthroughs in your life
[1:15:39] i believe that's why god
[1:15:41] one of the reasons that i see that god
[1:15:44] is bringing us 40 days of prayer
[1:15:47] not to bring a program we can't go by
[1:15:50] programs we're not under that spirit of
[1:15:52] programs
[1:15:53] but god bring this our way through
[1:15:55] brother simon then gave it to brother
[1:15:57] danny and danny took it and brought it
[1:15:59] this way and and leading it all to us
[1:16:02] amen because god wants us to pray
[1:16:06] god wants us to break through
[1:16:09] god wants us to break through where we
[1:16:10] get to a place where we start speaking
[1:16:13] his word that he will reveal to us amen
[1:16:17] when we break through
[1:16:22] it's all different my brothers we can
[1:16:24] pray we can pray together we can pray on
[1:16:26] the phone together amen but there's a
[1:16:29] difference when you break through in
[1:16:30] that other dimension when you finally
[1:16:33] break through
[1:16:34] all the veils of this world the veils of
[1:16:36] your flesh the veils of your mind
[1:16:39] then the spirit of god is in there
[1:16:41] speaking to you
[1:16:42] and then when you speak
[1:16:44] he gives you instructions
[1:16:47] and that's what brother brown talked
[1:16:48] about he gives you his instructions and
[1:16:50] you carry them out
[1:16:52] he tells you what to speak and you speak
[1:16:54] it
[1:16:55] and then you'll see because it's not
[1:16:57] your word it's not a word of a man
[1:16:59] now it's the word of god it's the spoken
[1:17:01] word
[1:17:02] and it will bring forth amen
[1:17:06] hallelujah quickly here
[1:17:09] verily early in the morning
[1:17:12] while it was still dark jesus got up
[1:17:15] left the house and went off to a
[1:17:17] solitary place where he prayed
[1:17:19] going away to pray and listen to the
[1:17:21] father is important pattern in jesus's
[1:17:24] life
[1:17:25] one that he seeks
[1:17:27] to demonstrate before his disciples for
[1:17:30] them to copy
[1:17:32] luke 4 42
[1:17:34] jesus and ah jesus often withdrew
[1:17:37] to lonely places and prayed luke 5
[1:17:41] 16
[1:17:42] in those days jesus went to the mountain
[1:17:45] and prayed and he spent
[1:17:48] and he spent the night praying to god
[1:17:53] luke 6 12
[1:17:55] all night praying to god
[1:17:58] you know
[1:17:59] i i looked at that my brothers and
[1:18:01] sisters
[1:18:02] and sometimes like the bible says some
[1:18:04] come out by fasting and praying
[1:18:06] and if you're stuck
[1:18:09] and there's some there's a stronghold in
[1:18:10] your life
[1:18:12] you got to get that lazy thinking out of
[1:18:15] your mind that devil out of your mind
[1:18:17] and you got a plan
[1:18:19] and purpose
[1:18:21] that whatever like the bible says in the
[1:18:24] book of acts they were there until
[1:18:30] until
[1:18:32] you know when you prayed about something
[1:18:35] amen and you prayed it out of your life
[1:18:39] and you prayed at that that demon was
[1:18:41] cast out amen from bothering you holding
[1:18:44] you back in your life you prayed until
[1:18:47] it was gone
[1:18:54] it might not happen
[1:18:56] you know
[1:18:56] but every one of us
[1:18:58] satan has a punch coming
[1:19:00] satan has an area of our lives
[1:19:04] and we we need to wake up and realize
[1:19:06] hey hold on a minute
[1:19:08] all this other stuff is not working
[1:19:12] i got to make this sacrifice i got to do
[1:19:14] this sacrifice
[1:19:16] ministers
[1:19:18] we need to pray
[1:19:20] we need to pray more and more
[1:19:23] to come under that anointing to come
[1:19:25] under that the spirit where the spirit
[1:19:27] takes control of us and that man's
[1:19:29] thoughts are not being projected but
[1:19:30] god's thoughts are being projected that
[1:19:32] the supernatural will come
[1:19:34] into these vessels
[1:19:36] and that we will step aside amen and
[1:19:39] watch him do the things watch him speak
[1:19:43] i'm looking for more for that i'm
[1:19:45] praying more for that
[1:19:49] amen i'd rather preach one message that
[1:19:51] that is so effective and so so god not
[1:19:55] brother tim
[1:19:56] not the gift but so god
[1:20:01] that's why brother abraham said all the
[1:20:02] words that i've said everything that i
[1:20:04] preach one word from god
[1:20:06] is greater than all the messages
[1:20:10] that's what we want to get to a place
[1:20:13] it's not just going to come by a lazy
[1:20:16] life
[1:20:17] and i i'm speaking to myself
[1:20:20] it's not going to come that way it's
[1:20:21] going to come
[1:20:23] by a life that surrender to god
[1:20:27] i look at my i look at my brothers
[1:20:30] my african brothers brother desmond
[1:20:32] brother phillip brother coffee going
[1:20:34] down to jamaica there god bless all the
[1:20:36] saints in jamaica amen
[1:20:38] and let's pray and continue to pray for
[1:20:40] them
[1:20:41] you think they went down there without a
[1:20:43] prayer life you think they went down
[1:20:45] there without prayer and fasting
[1:20:50] no
[1:20:52] no you don't we don't walk anywheres
[1:20:55] this world is satan's eden
[1:20:57] amen we want to be fortified under that
[1:21:00] anointing under that prayer life amen
[1:21:03] and speaking that word
[1:21:09] amen
[1:21:10] let me just wind it down now
[1:21:13] close it off here a couple quotes here
[1:21:16] and then we'll uh
[1:21:19] the shepherd's voice
[1:21:20] the still small voice amen
[1:21:26] hallelujah
[1:21:32] not only to pray and read scriptures
[1:21:34] which we must do
[1:21:36] but also listen to god's whisper his
[1:21:39] voice
[1:21:41] we might be ready for the day that he
[1:21:43] brings us
[1:21:45] start our day with prayer read in the
[1:21:48] word
[1:21:51] you're never too busy
[1:21:53] if you need to get up a half an hour
[1:21:55] early
[1:21:56] get up a half an hour early before work
[1:21:58] read pray
[1:22:02] that's what it means to abide in jesus
[1:22:06] where he talked about the parable of the
[1:22:07] vine and the branches john 15 1-9
[1:22:12] in the church age again here brother
[1:22:13] branham speaking
[1:22:15] jesus the name the word will
[1:22:19] you can't separate god from the word
[1:22:20] they are
[1:22:22] one the word he had left behind on on
[1:22:26] printed pages is part of him
[1:22:29] when you accept it by faith into a
[1:22:30] spirit-filled life
[1:22:32] he said
[1:22:33] his word is life john 6
[1:22:36] 63.
[1:22:38] but that's exactly what he
[1:22:41] is
[1:22:43] john 14 6
[1:22:45] says i am the way the truth and the life
[1:22:48] so when a spirit born
[1:22:51] spirit-filled man takes faith
[1:22:54] that word into his heart and places upon
[1:22:56] his lip
[1:22:58] why that's the same as deity speaking
[1:23:00] every mountain has to go
[1:23:02] satan cannot stand before that man
[1:23:07] so when a man lives by faith and walks
[1:23:10] by faith i mean substance faith he's
[1:23:13] isolated from the entire world
[1:23:16] he becomes a new creature in christ
[1:23:18] now you're getting into bride material
[1:23:21] you see see see
[1:23:23] you're getting into rapture and
[1:23:24] condition now
[1:23:26] that means for the laity every
[1:23:28] individual
[1:23:29] that walks in a world with god alone
[1:23:34] you're baptized into his kingdom and
[1:23:35] nobody in there but you
[1:23:38] and him
[1:23:40] he gives the orders you pack them out
[1:23:42] whatever he says there is not a shadow
[1:23:45] of doubt
[1:23:46] nowhere
[1:23:48] now to get into that kind of condition
[1:23:50] to get in that kind of life
[1:23:52] to be walking in the spirit my brothers
[1:23:54] and sisters it takes a life surrender to
[1:23:56] god
[1:23:57] if the lord says this there's nobody in
[1:24:00] the world that can talk you out of it
[1:24:03] you go just right on the same
[1:24:05] musicians you can come
[1:24:08] now you're coming into perfect faith
[1:24:14] hallelujah
[1:24:24] that perfection
[1:24:26] cannot fail
[1:24:28] that faith never fails yes
[1:24:30] it's a mystic to the world
[1:24:33] but not to them with perfect faith
[1:24:39] hallelujah
[1:24:41] let us stand
[1:24:45] i do not believe that one can earnestly
[1:24:47] seek and find
[1:24:48] priceless treasures in god's
[1:24:51] call without a devoted prayer life
[1:24:54] that is through god's word and prayer
[1:24:57] where he speaks
[1:24:59] there is nowhere in the world
[1:25:03] a kind of life more sweet and more
[1:25:06] delightful than that of continuous
[1:25:09] conversation
[1:25:11] in prayer with god
[1:25:13] those only can comprehend it who
[1:25:15] practice it and who experience it in
[1:25:18] their walks in their lives
[1:25:21] you have the anointing from the holy one
[1:25:24] and all you know the truth
[1:25:26] the anointing you receive from him
[1:25:28] remains in you
[1:25:30] and you do not need anyone to teach you
[1:25:33] it
[1:25:34] but as the anointing teaches you
[1:25:37] about all things
[1:25:40] and as the anointing is real not
[1:25:43] counterfeit
[1:25:44] just as it taught you it remains in you
[1:25:48] first john 20
[1:25:51] 2 20.
