[27:01] heart that you cannot go to
[27:04] heaven without the Holy Ghost because
[27:08] the Holy Ghost is your
[27:11] tiet so the church does have that ticket
[27:15] the only place where you can get a
[27:17] ticket is where God has given
[27:19] instruction this Bible
[27:22] here that this Bible is written here
[27:25] every word is inspired
[27:28] every word inside that Bible here that's
[27:32] your earnest hope that is Tak you to

[27:40] I I tear a paper I said this paper that
[27:42] I take nobody can take this paper the
[27:45] same way that I rap it even myself I
[27:47] cannot rap into two
[27:49] times so you part here God has is over

[27:58] click and March that paper that God has
[28:02] and that is the Holy Ghost part of you
[28:04] God has it there and you are you are
[28:07] here so you going to March it up the
[28:09] church nobody can match it up unless you
[28:12] yourself you follow that patter and God
[28:15] gave it to you and through his grace and
[28:17] mercy because we were there before we
[28:20] came over here so your part is already
[28:23] over there
[28:25] Hallelujah and I begin to talk talk to
[28:28] them Hallelujah and I said you are
[28:31] sitting here you know me from the
[28:33] beginning when I was young childhood you

[28:39] was no good nothing good in me I
[28:42] traveled to go and and find money to
[28:45] come here but I went what I get is more
[28:48] than the money that I went for
[28:50] Hallelujah now what I get is what I
[28:52] brought here it's more than life your
[28:57] daily life Oh Glory to God we had a good
[29:03] time and then after the
[29:05] service then the man started to and I
[29:08] started to I started to open a little
[29:11] bit about the serpent
[29:14] seed that are Apple and all those things
[29:17] there so the pastor asked me so it's not
[29:18] Apple I said what is
[29:22] Apple there's not such a thing Apple
[29:25] inside the Bible even if you read the
[29:27] Bible there's no word Apple
[29:31] there so they
[29:34] SE and I started to explain to them how
[29:38] things went before he sitting down there
[29:41] me and him going through this journey
[29:44] and God came down through his grace and
[29:46] mercy he reversed that case and here we
[29:49] are now so whoever took this this word
[29:54] here and I tell you not everybody can
[29:58] take there's a special people whom God
[30:01] has chosen no matter what because their
[30:04] part is already there you tell them they
[30:07] will take that word there they cannot
[30:09] refuse it
[30:11] Hallelujah glory to God and I had a good
[30:14] time with
[30:15] them yes so after the
[30:20] service four people everybody lined up

[30:27] my sister is laying down Sick onto a
[30:30] point of death I want to stand before I

[38:36] there you your can do that no God
[38:42] himself brother Abraham was preaching
[38:45] and the man was challenging him and he
[38:47] said you fall down on my feet what

[1:11:02] enemy the paragraph 27 he said brother
[1:11:07] Braham now he
[1:11:10] seed now Jesus said about seed he said
[1:11:15] this that he said this that it will be
[1:11:19] far better than a a mstone to be h on
[1:11:23] your neck and drawn in the dep of the

[1:12:03] whoever bless
[1:12:06] you I bless them and whoever Cur you I
[1:12:11] will Cur
[1:12:14] them thank you Lord now if you notice he
[1:12:20] said he would bless who
[1:12:24] Abraham who blessed Abraham and his seed
[1:12:27] will be blessed and he will curse ever
[1:12:31] who Cur Abraham now you just watch that
[1:12:34] the Jewish people see what happened
[1:12:38] watch that amongst Christian see what
[1:12:42] happened always that way see you see so
[1:12:46] you
[1:12:47] see he will possess the enemy's
[1:12:51] gate let's go back and find some some of
[1:12:53] the man Abraham seed under the Jewish
[1:12:57] Covenant then bring it down into the
[1:13:00] Gentiles when we were drafted over from
[1:13:03] the Jewish age of to the Gentile age to
[1:13:07] take a people for the name for his name
[1:13:10] now let's take some of the The Men Who
[1:13:13] was the Seed of Abraham and see if they
[1:13:16] possess the Gate of the enemy let's take
[1:13:20] let let's take for instance now let's Pi
[1:13:24] a moment upon there when the children of
[1:13:27] Israel has been carried away captiv down
[1:13:29] from Babylon there was a time first
[1:13:33] there was had first they had no they had
[1:13:36] to come to a
[1:13:38] trial there's always a trials it always
[1:13:42] darkest before day in the nature and you
[1:13:46] always have trials before you have
[1:13:48] Victory if there is no war then there is
[1:13:51] no victory so you going to get
[1:13:55] worse but there will be always Victory
[1:13:58] when God you have a trial you have a
[1:14:01] problem God never solve the problem God
[1:14:04] always solve our
[1:14:06] problem never one time ever leave us now
[1:14:09] the Hebrew children down there had
[1:14:13] brought on the
[1:14:15] spot had brought onto the spot where the
[1:14:18] king made a declaration that anybody
[1:14:22] will not bow down to this image would
[1:14:25] throw into the fire furnace furnace of
[1:14:28] fire
[1:14:29] rer and when they purposed their heart
[1:14:33] that they would not go in to defy
[1:14:36] themselves they were going to leave
[1:14:39] close to God now three Hebrew children
[1:14:42] Shadrach mesek andigo they were all they
[1:14:46] were the Seed of Abraham and how to and
[1:14:49] how the promise of God that is seed
[1:14:53] that's his seed will possess the enemy's
[1:14:55] gate now I would imagine when a trial
[1:14:58] come up what the first thing a child of
[1:15:01] God has for Refuge when a trial comes
[1:15:05] the greatest weapon was ever put in the
[1:15:08] hands of mankind
[1:15:09] prayer hallelujah what what what what
[1:15:13] the what's the greatest weapon prayer
[1:15:16] Hallelujah it even changed
[1:15:20] everything it even changed the mind of
[1:15:22] God one one time God told the God told
[1:15:26] his Prophet go up and tell the king he
[1:15:29] was going to die and the King turned his
[1:15:31] face to the wall and said Lord I beseech
[1:15:34] you to consider me I have walked before
[1:15:37] you with a perfect with a with a perfect
[1:15:41] heart and need 15 years longer and God
[1:15:45] spare his life 15 years longer Prayer
[1:15:47] Changes
[1:15:49] Things
[1:15:51] Hallelujah then then then we noticed
[1:15:54] then the Hebrew children came to prayer
[1:15:57] meeting that
[1:15:59] night what were going to what what are
[1:16:03] we going to do they have to be a
[1:16:06] gathering and decision has to be made
[1:16:09] know that they pray all night long and
[1:16:12] the decision was en numerously because
[1:16:15] they were deciding that they could not
[1:16:19] afford to go back to go on God on the
[1:16:22] time of trial
[1:16:23] wouldn't that be good for the whole
[1:16:27] church now when the decision is made
[1:16:30] shall I turn to be shall I turn to the
[1:16:34] things of the world shall I go like the
[1:16:37] rest of them go the decision come to
[1:16:41] every Christian it comes to you daily
[1:16:45] how are we going to do it you have got
[1:16:48] to make your
[1:16:50] decision and they made their decision
[1:16:54] regardless what what would take place
[1:16:57] wasn't going to turn away from God that
[1:17:00] right because they promised of God that
[1:17:03] they were Abraham's seed and they know
[1:17:07] their position and know where they
[1:17:10] standing and they told the king they
[1:17:13] said no now they said we are going to
[1:17:16] throw you into the far F if you do not
[1:17:20] bow down to this God
[1:17:23] Hallelujah I just want to get something
[1:17:31] here there was a place where I wanted to
[1:17:37] get yeah but they will hold out the

[1:17:43] are my servant Abraham said so I will
[1:17:45] hold truth I will so they will hold
[1:17:49] truth well the next morning the king the
[1:17:53] king might have said have you
[1:17:56] decide now that you are going to bow

[1:18:03] to bow down we are just a r a rig his
[1:18:08] dignation him he that he h the furnace

[1:18:18] he took he took some big strong men they
[1:18:22] started walk into the drop of into the
[1:18:24] furnace and they walk up close looking
[1:18:28] like the Dark
[1:18:29] Hour was there that the way that's the
[1:18:33] way it looks to Christian sometime when
[1:18:36] somebody the young lady and they have
[1:18:39] been persuaded by a boy that she really
[1:18:43] loves to take care for
[1:18:45] cigarette when she forced maybe to take
[1:18:49] a drink for her first
[1:18:51] time

[1:18:56] something but it's too
[1:18:58] long yeah it's
[1:19:04] okay there's a place where God God said
[1:19:07] I have to go down I have to go down by
[1:19:10] myself that's what I was looking for I
[1:19:12] think it's okay praise the Lord
[1:19:15] hallelujah so you young people we said
[1:19:19] sometime you're going to go through
[1:19:21] trials somebody going to take you oh
[1:19:23] let's go take a one drink the Christmas
[1:19:25] is coming let's try let's go take one
[1:19:29] cigarette would you deny God and follow
[1:19:33] that demon that try to persuade you you
[1:19:36] have always have to stand by God if you
[1:19:39] stand by God God stand by you God bless
[1:19:42] you this is a little thought that I have
[1:19:45] for you this evening may the Lord bless
[1:19:47] you praise the
[1:19:51] Lord
[1:19:56] thank
[1:19:58] you wonderful thank you uh praise God
[1:20:02] God bless everyone of you here tonight
[1:20:04] good to see you good to see you all here
[1:20:07] in the house of the Lord you know as I
[1:20:09] listened to brother Desmond I thought if
[1:20:12] Moses was here
[1:20:14] tonight and and trying to speak to you
[1:20:18] and you know of course he's bringing the
[1:20:21] word of Jehovah bringing the word of God
[1:20:23] but here you would be halting and and
[1:20:27] and stammering and and and and uh you
[1:20:30] know struggling to to talk to you and
[1:20:34] you'd be wondering what this guy is a
[1:20:37] preacher or whatever but you see you've
[1:20:40] got to understand God
[1:20:43] [Music]
[1:20:44] deliberately hides behind that kind of
[1:20:49] skin right and when I say that I don't
[1:20:52] mean black skin white skin brown skin
[1:20:54] any skin he deliberately hides behind it
[1:20:59] and then he lets you see little things
[1:21:02] about that person but that uh you know
[1:21:06] just to distract you because those who
[1:21:09] are ordained by God to see the truth and
[1:21:13] the revelation of the word doesn't
[1:21:16] matter what comes what distractions come
[1:21:20] oh he the devil will bring your ATT
[1:21:22] mention oh he didn't pull up his socks
[1:21:24] before he got up there look at that his
[1:21:26] TI is Twisted what's that got to do with
[1:21:29] the word what is anything got to do with
[1:21:32] the opening of the word but that's how
[1:21:34] Satan Works he takes your attention away
[1:21:37] with all kinds of other things uh rather
[1:21:40] than recognizing what God is
[1:21:44] saying and using like for instance this
[1:21:48] brother here tonight talking about uh
[1:21:51] the Manifest
[1:21:54] recognizing your testimony being
[1:21:58] recognized not by how much you're
[1:22:00] talking and all that but by the
[1:22:01] manifestation of the Holy Spirit through
[1:22:04] your life amen in other words by faith
[1:22:08] Abel amen God testifying of his gift not
[1:22:13] just him telling oh I I I had a
[1:22:16] revelation I knew that it was blood I
[1:22:19] that's in it's a truth but that's not it
[1:22:23] after you say it then God comes and
[1:22:26] testifies that it is the truth amen and
[1:22:29] furthermore the brother was emphasizing
[1:22:32] it's not if you see it in your pastor
[1:22:34] you see it in the Deacon you see it in
[1:22:35] this one that one that's fine but then
[1:22:38] when you begin to see little uh
[1:22:42] incidents in your own
[1:22:44] life on
[1:22:49] unexplained um coincidences taking place
[1:22:53] around you you see you start to see
[1:22:58] little suggestions or hints coming into
[1:23:01] your mind that you didn't think about
[1:23:04] but all of a sudden a thought comes well
[1:23:05] why don't you do this why didn't you
[1:23:07] think about that why didn't you go here
[1:23:10] stop what you're doing over there uh
[1:23:12] stop now go stand over there simple
[1:23:16] simple ordinary things like that but you
[1:23:19] you God starting to train you to
[1:23:22] understand him and to know him until you
[1:23:25] begin to walk with him so uh these
[1:23:31] manifestations of the supernatural as
[1:23:33] our brother was talking about uh Paul
[1:23:36] said we didn't come with just the word
[1:23:39] only right yeah we got the message but
[1:23:41] we didn't come with the word only but we
[1:23:44] come in the manifestation or
[1:23:47] demonstration of the spirit of God and
[1:23:50] in the power of God and that's what we
[1:23:53] come in and the beauty of this thing is
[1:23:56] it's not as we think we're going to move
[1:23:58] the hand of God because we have strong
[1:24:01] faith no God doesn't do anything brother
[1:24:03] brandham said because you tell him to or
[1:24:06] you ask him to he doesn't because he
[1:24:09] wants to do
[1:24:10] it he is
[1:24:12] moved he he is moved but he is not moved
[1:24:17] he moves but he is not moved he moves
[1:24:20] when he wants to move but he's not moved
[1:24:22] by by sympathies human things and all
[1:24:26] that he's not moved by that he moves
[1:24:28] when he chooses to move amen and he
[1:24:31] knows Beyond Us Praise the Lord I'm not
[1:24:33] here to preach I'm just commenting all
[1:24:36] of this is coming off of what the
[1:24:37] brother was saying but it's just
[1:24:39] marvelous and wonderful but
[1:24:42] also um he left out that when he spoke
[1:24:47] to that old
[1:24:48] preacher uh the old preacher suddenly
[1:24:52] remembered that the night before he he
[1:24:55] he had a dream or Vision that somebody
[1:24:58] else was preaching in the church but he
[1:25:00] didn't know who the person was uh he
[1:25:03] didn't mention that maybe God didn't
[1:25:04] want him to say but the fact is that's
[1:25:07] what happened uh and and so that is one
[1:25:10] of the things that put the Man on
[1:25:13] Fire what is going in the world is going
[1:25:16] on because he knows that nobody did that
[1:25:19] it was God did that amen and and so he
[1:25:23] just hung on the word and what a
[1:25:26] blessing that is now we'll just do the
[1:25:29] best we can to help that church because
[1:25:31] we know they are just now trying to
[1:25:33] build a building praise the Lord and
[1:25:36] this is what we have been doing and we
[1:25:38] thank the Lord for that wonderful so God
[1:25:42] is God and he uses anybody amen and so
[1:25:46] you can take the simplest one of us here
[1:25:49] and let us say something that doesn't
[1:25:51] sound
[1:25:53] uh as we say intelligent or it doesn't
[1:25:56] sound logical but if it's in line with
[1:25:59] the word of God you listen to that voice
[1:26:01] behind that voice and let the Holy
[1:26:04] Spirit lead and guide you now I'm here
[1:26:08] as the pastor and I have been here uh
[1:26:11] for all these years and God no doubt has
[1:26:14] been flowing through me and you're used
[1:26:16] to that but now there's a transition and
[1:26:20] a passing of a torch but not only the
[1:26:23] passing of a torch it's the pillar of
[1:26:26] Fire or the Holy Spirit going from one
[1:26:30] to
[1:26:31] another not for you to hear a different
[1:26:35] voice but the same voice coming through
[1:26:39] the a different vessel that God will be
[1:26:42] using it's the same voice but it'll come
[1:26:45] through a different vessel so don't look
[1:26:48] at the vessels listen to The Voice see
[1:26:51] that's what you got to have your
[1:26:53] attention on listen to the voice that's
[1:26:56] coming and that will keep you up online
[1:26:59] front sight back site word of God
[1:27:02] everything will be lined up together and
[1:27:05] doesn't matter what the devil cannot
[1:27:08] Prevail against the True Church of the
[1:27:11] Living God because it's founded on
[1:27:13] Revelation it lives by Revelation and it
[1:27:16] will continue to move by
[1:27:18] Revelation and not because we use the
[1:27:21] words Revelation because these days
[1:27:23] everybody's saying they get
[1:27:25] Revelation and and and they talk about
[1:27:28] the supernatural but the Supernatural is
[1:27:30] not something you
[1:27:32] do it's something that he
[1:27:35] does and it's something that you you
[1:27:37] yourself can
[1:27:38] explain uh you can be just talking like
[1:27:42] this and be talking simply like this and
[1:27:45] then all sudden the Holy Spirit just
[1:27:48] breaks out why because the spirit of God
[1:27:52] God on you creates the atmosphere that
[1:27:56] he can drop down among us and that he
[1:27:59] can make himself known anytime he wants
[1:28:02] and it's it's beautiful it's a beautiful
[1:28:05] thing sometimes he comes in the Thunder
[1:28:08] next time he comes in the lightning of
[1:28:10] the word another time he's a still Small
[1:28:13] Voice we just got to go with him
[1:28:16] whichever way he wants to go the Lord
[1:28:18] bless you real good and who's going to
[1:28:23] do the singing oh he's here in position
[1:28:26] praise God everything is positionally
[1:28:28] placed brother adopted anointed
[1:28:32] positionally placed and ready to go
[1:28:34] praise the Lord God bless you all amen
