TRANSCRIPT
========================================
was in when Jesus decided to intervene in my life I had problems I had drug addictions I had Financial issues I had all kinds of situations around my life and uh God just chose to intercede at that particular time in my life you know a lot of people say oh you know you needed God because you know you were going through some bad times and you know that's why you you you took a hold of God and you let that be your clutch you know and your way of of uh you know uh saying and justifying that this is how you know you got out of your problems and your trouble no no no no it's not the way it works okay there's a lot of people that will go to rehab centers and they do work some of them work some of them don't it's as simple as that I'm not going to turn around and say you know this works and that doesn't work and this works and that doesn't work no I'm just going to tell you my experience my experience was not because I uh went to a rehabilitation Church on Winona it wasn't a Little White Church on in Winona known as a rehab center a lot of people want to call churches rehab centers I'm saying churches are a good thing everybody needs to belong and to worship because it's in you to worship something but it's another thing when God comes to you when God comes to you because he has a plan for you because he has a a purpose for your life because you're not just another ordinary individual out in the world you are a son or a daughter of God by election in the back mind of God from before the foundations of the world and you are being now expressed and manifested in this day as a as a an actual attribute of God you are the word being manifested and made flesh to the people of this 2023 year and and this time and this season you are God's interpretation of his word there's a big difference between just being a churchgoer and being the word you are the word because you can see yourself in the word and here now you you look and you know Peter was just an ordinary man I was an ordinary man you're an ordinary woman you were just somebody that was brought up in a certain land and you ended up here in Canada and now you ended up here in this church and you ended up under this ministry and you're now finding yourself by Revelation in the body of Christ the mystical body of Jesus Christ not just good neighbor Ministries this is just a church it's a church building like any other church out there but what gathers in this place every Sunday every Wednesday when we come together there's a supernatural God that comes and and possesses the ministry and starts to speak to our lives and makes his word real to us it's a reality it's not just a a tradition it's not oh I got to go to church so that I can be seen oh no that's not what it is this is going to meet God where God can speak to you lip to ear and discern your needs and and change your life and and work on your character and take away the things that that that that you know like we talked about on Wednesday night we have preconceptions and we have things in our lives that that that we filter our lives through and we think that oh well I was brought up in this way and I was taught this way and you know I've got these bad experiences in my life and and it was a bad experience and now I'm a miserable person most of the time that's just who I am not when Christ comes amen Peter was a miserable person Peter had a had a fiery uh uh temper amen praise God but God was going to use that fire that was in him to go and preach to the Gentiles amen praise God God was going to use that that that characteristic that's in you to be a testimony and to be a a living uh word in your day and God is going to use your character the way that God designed you but he's gonna he's gonna he's gonna mold you and shape you into something that you are going to be proud of to know that you're a part of God's economy amen praise God he was just like anybody else having financial problems relationship problems he was having trouble with his wife there she was getting tired of you know uh all the the the excuses and all the lies because he'd be out late at night maybe he'd be trying to gamble his money back or trying to make a way to you know somehow because he just wasn't doing well at fishing you see but God had designed him to be a fisherman amen because God had different plans for him down the road you can look back in your life and you can look at certain characteristics in your life uh how God you know designed you you know I hear my wife say a lot of times to me you know she goes man you know all you thought about was money all you thought about was becoming rich All you thought about was you know like being successful I said that's just who I was that's the desire that was in my heart now I want to be successful I want to be financially free and I want it all for one purpose for the glory of God so that something can happen that that if God wants to use me financially if God wants to use you financially if God wants to move millions of dollars through you for whatever purpose as long as you've come into your position as a son or a daughter of God God can give you what is yours God can bless you financially God can do with you what he wants because he knows now the character is the right kind of character but God doesn't always bless everybody in the same way you see some people you know they get into their mind oh you know I got so much Revelation on Prosperity I should be I should be one of the rich ones in the church that's not the way it works God doesn't work that way God gives a portion of faith to each and every one and so some will just naturally have the ability to prosper financially so that they can bless the kingdom of God because God knows they got a revelation on it other people got a revelation on uh big houses and and and fancy cars and and and just luxury all around them and and that's that's their motive that's their desire and that's their purpose and God is not interested in that he's not interested in that he's interested in the vision that he's placed in you to prosper the kingdom of God God doesn't need my money God doesn't need your money God didn't need to get into Peter's boat God didn't need oh Peter I need you to bring me out a little bit further out into the water because this way the people will be able to hear me better which that makes sense right because you know you go out there's a crowd and everything else so Peter I I need I need your boat to take me out there I can I can show you a scripture that says Jesus walked on the water he didn't need the boat but he needed Peter he had an he had an appointment with Peter he had an appointment with you he had an appointment with me he had a purpose in calling us and so when God's going to do something he's got a purpose purpose and a plan and he knows everything that he needs to put into your life so that when the time comes that you recognize your calling get into your position God can bless you and bless the body hallelujah praise God forever more but you know sometimes the Lord will allow us to get into some pretty low places to get our attention he'll allow us to fall into unbelief because you know we're still human right you got to remember there was Simon and then there was Peter you see each and every one of us there's there's there's there's you and then there's the attribute of God God's dealing with the attribute and the attribute is dealing with your flesh because it's at enemity with God right your your attribute is God by the way the portion of God that you are as a son is actually a part of God and so when your flesh is fighting up and it doesn't want to go to church it doesn't want to give it doesn't want to be there to help when the when the when the church is being cleaned when your flesh is fighting up in those areas it's because it's rebelling against God it's as simple as that you're rebelling in your spirit you you don't understand why you know you've got this this this miserable kind of attitude sometimes and why you you know you're you're you're nice one day and the next day you're not and then you know you're you're struggling one day the next day you're you're free it's because you are in this battle you're in this great battle brother Bram said it was the greatest battle that you'll ever fight and that battle is against yourself it's against this human element that you struggle with every single day gets tired and gets upset and has has to deal with all kinds of situations amen so God knows that there's there's Simon and then he called him Peter because now he was calling the real attribute now he was now he was going deeper now he was going to the to to the to the place where okay I'm gonna I'm gonna Place him now I'm going to show him so God had to do something Supernatural around Peter's life in order to catch his attention and I'll tell you something God will do something Supernatural when he calls you it will not that's why get rid of all the confusion okay forget all the confusion forget about all the things that that you hear you know oh I heard this happens and I heard I could speak in tongues and I heard that I you know I I would do this and and and then I heard this and I heard that forget about all of that you need to know that you're going to have a supernatural experience and you're going to know that God actually called you you're going to have the sign of the Messiah take place right in your own personal life you will not be able to deny it and nobody will be able to take that experience away from you nobody I don't care what anybody says when somebody's been awakened to the revelation of who they are as a son or a daughter of God there is no demon in the pits of hell no nothing Jesus said the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it it's a simp f is that so if you haven't had that yet let that be what burns within your heart say Lord let that be what burns within My Heart Lord I want to know now don't think oh you got to walk up and a a bush is going to be on fire in front of you could that happen sure but is that the evidence no what is it what is it that that that that because all of a sudden this word that you've been reading that you've heard about that you've been taught that you've listened to the priest you've listened to the preacher you've listened to your mom you've listened to your dad you've heard it it's all been word it's all been letter it's all been rules it's all been things that I should things that I shouldn't do that all gets blown right out of the water and Jesus comes to you personally and he opens your your your understanding in a way that you can't you can't you can't get away from it you can't get away from it I I remember I remember listen I I remember people were trying to convince me to go to church you know they would tell me you should come to my church you should go to this church that church but when this word was revealed to me I couldn't get enough church I couldn't get enough of the word I couldn't ever I wanted to read constantly read I didn't want to go to work I just wanted to feed on the word listen to The Prophet feed on the word go to church because because it became so real and all I could see was all these experiences in my life all these things that that God was doing around my life and the reason why this and the reason why that and he started to answer this question and he answered that question and because he became real he he started to show himself and his thoughts started to come in you do you know what I'm saying here amen come on you you know that you know you know that God is revealing it to you it's a reality that that that goes beyond being taught or or or just belonging to a church or or this pastor's got it so maybe I got to go to this church oh no maybe I got to go to that church glory to God Amen it's not the church that you go to it's the spirit of Revelation that's come upon you to hear the word and to know where God is placing you where God is using you God is speaking to you in a certain church because he's got a position for you in that church and as long as Israel was in her Homeland God would bless her but the minute you go outside of your land the moment that you start to go looking elsewhere you start to look for interpretation here interpretation there well I should well I don't I don't need to pay tithes I'll just pay my tithes to the voice of God and I'll pay them when I want and I and I I don't want to be account I don't want to be held accountable to nothing you see that shows that you really haven't come into contact with Christ himself you know that you're you're you're naked before God you know that he knows your life you know that you You Can't Hide anymore that everything that you do when you're doing it you're doing it because you are aware that God is aware hallelujah praise God he didn't need to he listen Jesus didn't need to get into the boat but he wanted to get into the boat because you heard him what he said you know Peter was saying listen I got you know I'm busy I got I got things I got to go do I got to go figure out how I'm going to pay this debt I'm going to have to go do another side job I'm going to have to go build something now to to make some extra money and you want me to go deeper no Jesus was looking deeper into him Jesus knew what was deep beneath that skin if Jesus could see that there was fish deep in the water do you think God you think Jesus couldn't see what was deep within him don't you know God can see what's deep within you and why he's calling you why he's placing you God has all of that in the in the back of his mind let's go to the next slide listen to brother brandom he says here now listen notice how his own predestinated sheep followed him right in the days of the greatest theologians that we ever had they come right out because they knew him they knew what the word had promised for that day they know what the Messiah was to be like when he came and Simon Peter came to him which was only Simon then you see there was a Simon and there was a Peter and Andrew had tried to tell him about that you know his brother Simon you got to come and see you gotta listen this this is the Messiah you know because Andrew had a real experience something was revealed to Andrew that he was the Messiah you know that's why you know when you when you when you got on fire man I remember I telling everybody and everything around me that Jesus Christ is a reality he's real he's a living God he's present right now and he's dealing with people he's dealing with me he's dealing with me he's dealing with I see it in my brothers and my sisters that he's a reality but you know Peter and Simon he just Andrew please you know like I got debts I got to pay debts okay but you see this man is the Messiah and when God becomes a reality to you your family your friends they will know that you are different they will know that you don't change your tune they will know that God is a reality to you that's beyond what they know they just can't quite put a finger on it but they know well Simon of course he was maybe a little hot-headed hardheaded and he wouldn't go but when he walked up into the presence of Jesus when Jesus said your name is Simon and you are the son of Jonas now we know that Jesus told his Apostles that he knew them and he before the foundations of the world they were attributes of his thoughts that's where it everything changes you see when Jesus came into your life when this message came into your life it was because the Holy Spirit was coming to an Atri rute not to Daniel gusin not to Tina it was coming to the attributes they have plans they're all excited they're they got great plans guess what Jesus has greater plans Jesus has something in store that that he had from before the foundations of the world and as long as they can fall into Jesus plan Jesus word recognize what the word says about them as a husband as a wife as a provider all those things as a father as a all those things that the word says about them in the word of God they will prosper they will move forward in the name of the Lord and God will do things for them that they will not need to do anything they will just trust and Obey and know that God is in control of their lives amen attributes of God attributes of his thoughts therefore being that seed laying in him and knew that the word said and had been promised that the Messiah would be a prophet and when he seen that he was through with fishing he knew then that he would drop his Nets because he was be he'd be going to become a fisher of men and that's from 19 65 lean not unto your own Understanding God's prophet and so he knew that that that something was deeper Jesus knew that there was something in Peter's life that he was going to come to know and I want you to you know I want you to see something else here Jesus knew also that Peter would deny him three times even after his conversion in the boat you're going to make mistakes you're going to do things that you wish you never did you're going to say things that you wish you never said you're going to you're going to get caught the enemy is going to trap you and and all of a sudden you're going to be in an embarrassing situation Hallelujah and you might even deny the word of God and Jesus knew that about Peter but yet Peter is written in the word of God as one that went to the Gentiles as one that was a mighty minister of God wrote Into the scriptures was used of God in a mighty way Supernatural God made him somebody that he never thought that he would be but God knew everything about Peter God knew everything about Peter he knew his life he knew his future just like he knows yours he knows what you're headed for he knows what you're going to do in the word of God he knows that some are going to leave some are going to leave there's nothing that we can do about that you you heard the parable the parable of Heaven is a is a net and all kinds are going to come into that net but he's going to take out the rainbow trout and the rest he's going to throw away it's just as simple as that because not everybody is attributes of God not everyone that lives in this world is a son or a daughter of God they come through Pro creation they come through the through the Avenue of a man and a woman coming together and bringing forth seed of their own kind and bringing forth individuals and then a life comes into that body not every soul that goes into each and every body has within it the attribute of God there has to be representation from God in there that was the great mystery that was a thing that that that you know that that would would not be interpreted you couldn't put an inter interpretation on that it's always been all the way down Through the Ages God placed a portion of himself in each and every son and daughter of God and he said my sheep my attributes my sheep my sheep hear my voice what what you know like that that has to become a reality to you that you're actually hearing the voice of God it's not just that you're hearing brother branham's voice you're hearing the voice of God through brother brandham and the Revelation that brother brandham has when he's speaking on that word and he's revealing the word and he's preaching the word and and the seals are being open the voice that's coming through brother brandom is the voice of God it's a supernatural element that's speaking to the attribute that's within you and that's calling you and placing you into the body allowing you to say Amen to this word hallelujah allowing you to to to to to be shaped by the word of God and to to be placed positionally right where God wants you to be amen praise God hallelujah so we know that that Parable is a Dragnet and it's it's it's it's typing everything that that's going to happen in the end time there's a lot of people that are being called into churches a lot of people are starting to look at what's going on in Israel and they're and they're looking at it and they're saying man you know what I better get back to church because things are really starting I I heard the the the pastor preaching about something about Israel you know something about war in Israel something about the big battle of Armageddon and that's where that's where that's in the Middle East there's a big Valley there and that's you know all of a sudden people are starting to naturally they're starting to awaken to that you know to what's going on in the world and so there people are maybe starting to go to church they're listening in on on YouTube a little more and listening in on what Jesus said about it and you know they're trying to put one plus one together but let me tell you something this goes beyond putting one and one together this is this is where where you can you all you can do is Jesus said unless my father my spirit you got to understand Jesus was the father is the father is the Holy Ghost Jesus Christ is the human name that he took when he came to Earth but he is Elohim he is the self-existent one one God not three Gods not not not you know the Mighty God the almighty no no one God and unless you get that as your foundation you're going to be listening to a lot of things that are not going to make sense so you need to say so when Jesus was here and he said the all that the father hath given me will come I'm going to I'm going to read that I'm going to speak that a little different right now all that I have given myself from before the foundations of the world the sons and daughters that were with me before where were you job when the Sons and Daughters of God rejoiced together around the throne where were you you see he has sons and daughters only one God there was only one that stepped out from the throne it was Jesus Christ it was God himself it's all one person so all that I have given myself self will come to me I will draw [Applause] them my sheep hear my voice they recognize and so that element when that takes place within a Christian walk Everything Changes the scriptures change all of a sudden now it's not baptism in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit all of a sudden now because you got a revelation that it's just one God and when Jesus stood there in his glorified body and he stood before his disciples and said go ye into all the world baptizing them in the name name n a m e not titles he said name he said now I can show you scripture after scripture that there's only one name that man must must be saved by and that name is Jesus Christ and so when he said in the name of the father in other words the name is Jesus because the father is Jesus the son is Jesus the holy spirit is Jesus Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the New Testament look up Jehovah Jehovah the word means Jehovah Jesus our savior you see it was all talking about the coming of the Lord I want to keep this simple you see without without without a a foundation of knowing who your your relationship is with you can't really have the right relationship you can't really be all that God wants you to be because now you're you're not listening to his voice you're listening to man's interpretation you'll go on and you'll listen to the Baptist preacher and then you'll because you're a little confused you think okay wait a minute let me listen to this this uh denomination and see how they uh you know interpret God now God needs to be interpreted to you personally by he himself period it's as simple as that until you can get that clear you know I try to tell people that I try to say to people listen you know like I understand you know that you know you're seeing what you're seeing but I'm just saying that you know I had an experience by the Holy Ghost and God gave me his spirit Jesus said I will send you the comforter which is the Holy Ghost and he will guide you into all truth I'm trusting in that guide that it's taking me to all truth I can't I can't see it any other way everywhere I look in the scripture I see Jesus Christ I see him in the Old Testament I see him in the New Testament I see him in every single scripture because he is the scripture he is the word so if you don't see him in every word brother Braham says go back and check and pray and see where you where you missed him because you missed him somewhere when somebody comes to you and says well wait a minute the the Bible's you know Jesus said go and baptize in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost then Peter over here goes and baptizes in the name of Jesus Christ that's a contradiction I just finished explaining it that's no contradiction Peter Simon who became Peter who got revelated was standing right there when Jesus came and said go ye into all the world Peter was right there yes Lord baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit and Peter said yes Lord and on the day of Pentecost you go and read it I tell I tell preachers you know theologians they said listen here's Jesus given his commission he Peter you do you acknowledge Peter was there yes he was yes he was okay good because on the day of Pentecost can you please read to me what the subscription was when Peter stood in front of all the people when they asked them what do we do to be saved right do you hear Peter saying I go ye and repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the he says no that's not what it says I said what does it say sir he says in the name of the Lord Jesus I said what did you say you see some people regardless they will still turn around and say that means that I'd have to change everything that means that my whole life as a fisherman would be over because he just asked me to follow him indirectly the word just said follow me and that person is saying wait a minute here my family will disown me my friends will absolutely disown me my friends are going to think I've lost my mind because I'm putting the word of God first and I'm as an adult I received that Revelation and I went straight to the tank because I knew it was the truth and I knew that my old life had to die it had to be left in the deep it had to be left behind and when that Revelation strikes an individual and it comes into their heart there's nothing that'll stop them from going to the water and and that old life being buried and sunk and left behind because they realize it's the truth the TR Jesus said the truth shall set you free not a lie so if you remain in the LIE then who's responsible you see God is going to he's going to give witness to every single person on this Earth that he's a living God and you can drive down the roads and you'll look and just glance over and it says Jesus who so loved the world that he gave himself Jesus loves you Jesus is the way the truth and the life he's going to leave a testimony some people just won't stay long enough to listen they won't they won't just relax and allow you to say what it is that you need to say about the word of God and and and and and and challenge them to actually search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life but it's a reality Saint Jesus made it very clear when he made his elaboration on the Kingdom of Heaven and the net so we know that Jesus knew knew that Peter was going to deny him three times but did that stop Jesus from coming into his life no absolutely not because Jesus knows your life sees the end from the beginning then that Miracle took place and Peter could not deny what he was seeing with his own eyes the two boats were filled with fish he saw it he he couldn't deny it he couldn't deny that that this man just called him by his name and told him who his father's name was he couldn't deny it but yet down the road he was going to deny Jesus Christ because the human side of Simon would still struggle with the world just like you and me we're still in this world we're still just as human as anybody else we're no better than anybody else I brag on Jesus Christ I don't brag about myself I brag on Christ I brag that I brag on him to say Jehovah Gyra provides all my needs I brag on him I do what I need to do I brag on Christ to know that he's the one that that that makes things happen I cannot take credit the only thing that I can do that God said to me says listen you need to overcome and I'm telling you saints of God you need to overcome this you need to overcome your your your your weaknesses you know those those things of your of your past the things the scars that you know that you're holding on to maybe some bad experiences you need to you need to replace those with the word of God replace those those you know those moments when those times come up and Satan comes to remind you of all your error and all your mistakes and all your past and everything else if you've truly come into a relationship with God the first thing you did when that happened was you got on your knees like Peter you've seen what he did he humbled himself he got down on his knees and he said Lord depart from me I don't deserve this I remember when the word came in into my life and and I realized the kind of life I was living and I seen what he was doing and I I said I don't deserve this there's no way I deserve this kind of Grace and this love that I'm experiencing and I'm feeling I I don't understand it it's beyond human comprehension that God would intervene in my life in such a way I did not deserve it all like I would drive down the road and I'd just be going oh thank you thank you thank you Lord thank you Lord it would just be constant because I couldn't believe that the word made himself real to me and everything becomes a reality to you then in the word of God and you can't help it and Peter he he listen he was he was you know he could have listen he could have had a lot of Pride like a lot of people and said well you know what the fish weren't biting last night way to go guys we got a nice catch who is this guy you know Pride will do that God will do something in front of an unbeliever right and put that unbeliever right there and he will deny the miracle right to your face God's not interested in their reaction he's looking at yours he's looking to see what is in you he wants to know if that reality is there if you're you know Peter got on his knees you know what that means you're you humble yourself before God you humble before God because you didn't do anything to deserve this there's nothing you could ever do to deserve God's salvation Peter could have been full of Pride and I can do this and I can do that and well you know what you know we just had a bad night fishing boys you know we always catch fish you know but no God knew his need God knew and when he when God did it right there he knew that he says Thou Art the Lamb of God he knew that he was God he knew the reality and he humbled himself and he stood there and he let God now do for him what God was going to do what Jesus saw what God what Jesus knew he was going to do in his life that was the right response coming from Peter amen praise God and when you you know there's listen there's Simon and then there's Peter there's you that I see here on Sunday and I know you guys here on Sunday I see you I see your your character I see the way you greet me the way you don't greet me the way you do this the way you do that I see all of those things but do I see you on Monday Tuesday the other person Simon you know I I I I don't really know that person Pastor Simon doesn't really know that person unless God reveals to them exactly what and who you really are you can be you can be a hypocrite and come into the house of the Lord but if there's an attribute of God in there it's going to edify the body amen when I see you I feel edified I feel encouraged I feel blessed because you are one of those joints we're going to be looking at things I haven't even started I'm not kidding you I I got I got I got a whole series of messages that I've been putting together and God every week when I start when I think okay I'm going to do this this that all of a sudden he he comes here he says no we got some work to do I said oh okay I said Lord I know I need work I need help too Lord he says we gota we gota we got to really lay that foundation in good so that so that those that are that are going to fish the real fishermen they're going to have a revelation on fishing they're going to understand what it is to fish they're not going to be somebody that just goes out and you listen to this Tech you listen to this track you read this track and listen to this tape and if you can hear and you can recognize then you're an attribute of God if not you're a devil that's not the way it works it's not that the word has to be revealed personal so you the best thing that you can do in every situation is Express God's love to the people show them that you have the character of Christ Christ came he came to to call his own he says you know I didn't come for for those that that were righteous that didn't need me a lot of people say I got church Danny I got you know you know I sit down with people sometimes and they'll say oh I don't want to go there I said no no no no problem I don't want to go there either praise God because because Jesus is where every answer every uh uh problem can be solved but you got to be able to get somebody to sit still enough to listen amen praise God let's read we're going to wind this down right now let's read the next um uh scripture or next quote here from Brother Bram he says notice now we're talking about Simon and Peter we're talking about you know you in church and you at work and you know God God knows all about us you know he knows he knows the Simon in you and he knows the Peter in you amen and when you come into the house of the Lord he's you know he's speaking he's speaking to the to the attribute but he's he's dealing with the human element the weakness the the the the the stubborn Spirit the you know all those things that that we struggle with in this human realm amen notice there was a man an old fisherman who came to him by the name of Simon Peter his name then was Simon you see look like this just keeps coming out of the word his name then was Simon and when he came the strange thing about it Jesus yesterday now we're talking about he's the same yesterday today and forever amen he knew who he was he knew exactly everything that he needed to know about Peter he knew he was and he told him what his name was St John the first chapter said Thou Art Simon and your father's name is Jonas he could discern his life I remember when Jesus discerned my life I will never forget it I'm not going to get into it but when it happened and he spoke my name every demon that was around my life went into total abs absolute chaos they had no idea that it was going to happen I had no idea it was going to happen but when it happened everything started to shake around my life and everything shook around your life when this word came when Jesus made himself real to you he says what do you think that old fisherman with that greasy apron on thought when Jesus a man that had never seen him told him what his name was and what his daddy's name was that was kind of strange said now I'm going to give you another name that's what we've been hearing every time we come into the house of the Lord we're hearing him call our name you see the opening of that seventh seal was to reveal each and every son and daughter of God that was going to be called by their Supernatural name in this day that was something that he was going to do himself now you can say well I heard my name because I recognize the message of the hour that's good but that ain't enough oh but I I know that brother brandham is the prophet of the 20th century and that he was Malachi 4 and Revelations 10:7 he fulfilled that scripture that's good but that ain't enough Oh you mean there's more yeah I said Jesus Christ brother Bram says I got to decrease so that he can increase I got to do something that that that that you can't do brother brandom I'm gonna have to do it myself I'm going to need to come down myself and take care of this because their names are written on my Palms oh yes they're every single one of them they're written there and not one of them is going to be lost and I'm going to call them in such a way that they're going to know know that I know that they know Hallelujah glory to God Amen praise God that was Jesus he see now I'm going to give you another name I'm going to call you Peter which is by interpretation a little stone or a little Revelation or I'm going to call you by Revelation it's not Peter the pope it's not Peter the pope that started the church it's Jesus the rock that we stand on which is the revelation of God's word that that's been revealed to you as a son or daughter of God to know Jesus Christ in the power of his resurrection that he's made himself known to you that that that you have within you a stone of Revelation it comes off the great Anvil and and it reflects the spirit of God that light that keeps feeding you when you get caught into Heavenly places in Christ Jesus every Sunday every Wednesday when you feed on the word you're you're you're making contact with the Living God and he's showing you that you are mine and I have a purpose for you as we close the musicians Please Come Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God I think I think you know I've got I got more notes here but I believe the Holy Spirit has made it clear what we need to know today amen praise God I'm so looking forward go to the next slide there the Lord Jesus sees you but the next slide is what I'm really looking forward to seeing my part in the word because that's what's going to give me perfect faith for the Rapture I will never stop preaching on the Rapture because the Rapture Revelation is who I am it's in me it's in you you will speak the Rapture until you are changed I remember the first message when God called me to minister this word I was shocked I was totally shocked when Pastor Simon came into my office office one day and he dropped a sword on my desk and I looked at I said oh that's a nice letter opener he said no brother he said you're GNA pick up the word I said what I'm GNA pick up the word how how no idea I said okay well and I remember going to study and the first message that the lord gave me was being caught up together and I thought wow when I look back I see where God started you can look back and you can see where God started in your life and the Revelation that he gave you the part in the word that you were he doesn't make mistakes everything that he's doing is ordained by God it's his plan you want to know you're in that plan you're going to know you're going to you're going to recognize you're going to let the Holy Spirit reveal to you he's going to give you the faith so that you can see your part in the word of God God bless you Saints brother Anthony let's sing that song it's manifesting time behold he
