TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] dear friends once again i am so happy to be here with you to share the bread of life this word of god given to us we thank him for his grace and mercy this lesson from the seven church ages will be mainly introducing nimrod as mentioned in the bible and the reason why is because nimrod is closely associated with the origins or the beginnings of the trinitarian doctrine teaching of the trinity where it came from how how it originated and later we will touch on how it got here today but i will be brief tonight and next wednesday we will take up the life of nimrod of which we will speak now today is a topic i would like to entitle antiquity nimrod and the trinity our scripture reading is in genesis chapter 10 verses 8 to 10. let us read our bibles genesis 10 verses 8 to 10. this is a study of the word of god and cush begot nimrod and he began to be a mighty one in the earth he was a mighty hunter before the lord wherefore it is said even as nimrod the mighty hunter before the lord and the beginning of his kingdom was babel and eric and akad and kalne in the land of shinar god's blessing be upon his word and upon his people his word we know is already blessed but we ask for a refreshing of the holy spirit in teaching us the word of god this we thank you for father giving you all the glory honor and praise in jesus name amen now we ended our last talk speaking about how satan became the god of this world of course we know that satan has many names the god of this world god of this evil age the prince of darkness and so on so he has many names many descriptions and how that he buying his lies in heaven was kicked out upon the earth and then when he came to earth he continued his his uh lies rumors of deception duplicity and exacted created an atmosphere where he demanded worship or coerced or seduced people into worshipping him as god and there here we want to pick up this fact that polytheistic religion or religions that believe in many gods begin with the trinitarian doctrine the trinitarian doctrine is the basis for polytheistic religions within this this world today because way back in antiquity is where this belief and teaching of one god in three persons found itself being spread across the world and in the minds of those that were there at that time it's very strange that our modern day theologians who think of themselves as men of acute intelligence and mental dexterity have lost sight of this fact that the trinitarian doctrine way back in antiquity was the very foundation for polytheistic religion it seems as if just as satan duke the people way back in the antiquities in the ancient times it seems as he has duped our procession of uh theologians and wise men of this day until they have lost sight of the word of god that is so plain and simple to those who would believe just imagine intelligent people wise people believing the doctrine of three persons in the godhead and there's no scripture for it let me give you references to various parts of of of the especially of the new testament where they would allude uh or suggest that fact which has no standing anywhere in the word of god for god never changes his mind about his word and when he said to israel hero israel the lord thy god is one lord he never said the lord thy god is tree the lord thy god is for the lord i got no the lord thy god is one lord there's only one god he said and beside me there is no other not behind not before not beside just one god and he always proclaims himself that way and saying i the lord thy god i'm a jealous god hallelujah thanks be to god now it's very strange that the descendants of him went the way of satanic worship but the descendants of shem kept the belief and the faith from the time of adam and eve and abel who caught the revelation that the lord god of heaven is one lord and they have to this day the semitic peoples have maintained the fact in line with the word of god historically antiquity to modern times one lord one god of heaven and earth eternal on the present immutable o praise god we serve one great and eternal heavenly father and we give him praise and thanks for this fact hallelujah now remember the israelites as i've said have never wandered away from this belief of one god putting it through the ages they stumble this way that way but they're always on track for one god like you are i in our spiritual walk we're walking with god and we may stumble here we stumble there but the main uh the main trajectory of our walk is in line with the word of the living god they have never believed in three persons being in one god and abraham who came from the very plains of shinar came from the very area that nimrod rose up in which was like a center of false god carbs gods rock gods sculptured gods architecturally beautiful uh wonderful gods admirable to their eyes but we're talking about an eternal spirit being god that appeals and speaks to your heart to your life to your soul and you recognize it hallelujah thanks be to god amen in the bible genesis 18 abraham saw the lord coming up the road two angels with him and when abraham looked he did not say my lords plural he said my lord amen my lord hallelujah just as much as thomas would say my lord and my god in the new testament one god and his name is jesus christ abraham saw three persons coming towards him but he only recognized one god hallelujah now we know that the trinity in from the time of antiquity has been expressed in the form of an equatorial triangle a triangle with equal signs just as it is expressed in rome today we see that the hebrews or the semitic people have no such concept none whatsoever now who is right one god or three gods in one person who is right about it the hebrews or the babylonians who is actually right see now we know that in asia this polytheistic idea of three gods in one came out into the image of three heads on one body a god with three heads on one body now you can see later on from that came one body and then a whole bunch of heads or a whole bunch of arms or a whole bunch of feet coming out of that one body but it began with three heads on one body and was expressed as three intelligences to this one body later in india they found it in their hearts and in their teaching to express this god also in the form of a body with three heads and later on evoluted to three forms not only three heads but now three different forms see now we see that real good today we match it up with modern day so-called theology in japan there was a buddha with three heads on it like what we described earlier as we began speaking here and it all sets forth the trinitarian concept for it is not faith it is not the word it is not what we teach it is not in the bible it was never sent forth or revealed or made known by god these so-called uh claims of of saints and so-called claims of people having visions of that nature it's absolutely maybe they did have it but it's absolutely contrary to the word and voice of god for this day and for this hour now this trinitarian concept was first set forth as the head of an old man symbolizing the head of the father and around him or after him a great circle with a dot in the middle representing the seed or the sun from that father and then thirdly we see the wings and tails of a bird right and that was their doctrine of father son and holy ghost i hope you're taking some notes i hope you're writing down some things that you are hearing hopefully it will speak to you if not now but later on as you consider them and here was their doctrine a father son and holy ghost three persons in the godhead which they began to call the trinity now you can go to rome even today now and you will see some of the same things portrayed right before you it's strange how strange would it be that devil worshipers got the revelation of who god was before the patriarchs that they were teaching in babylon babel three persons in one god think of it before abraham the father of the faithful devil worshipers were propounding these teachings of three persons in the godhead but the moment god called abraham out of china out of that idolatrous background called him to himself all that abraham could see was one god now my friends it seems from what i've been saying uh it satan tried to pro uh uh propound the fact that the devil worshipers knew more about god than the real patriarchs and prophet did and so just like modern theologians today they propound and talk a lot about their trinitarian doctrine with such authority that you would think it is in the bible but it is not the bible they'll tell you about three lights tree grapes trees this three that they're trying to propound the twisted perverted every possible way but the bible remains the same hero israel the lord thy god is one lord true spiritual israel still believes hero israel the lord thy god is one lord there is no other but jesus christ jehovah of the old testament is now the same jesus of the new testament for the name jesus means jehovah has now become our savior jehovah is now our savior now we know from the scriptures that satan is the biggest liar there is but the bible calls him the father of all lies that's why the bible tells us the satan and all the liars and the lying will be placed into the pit of hell for lying is darkness truth is the light you see but satan takes his darkness and calls that light he'll tell you join this organization you'll get secret knowledge that will give you light it'll give you light but you see the light that he will give so-called light is really darkness because he's a murderer to begin with and his doctrine of the trinity what has it done destroyed multitudes millions warring in the name of christianity which is not real christianity but paganism hiding under the cloak of christianity perpetrating crimes until their lips and their hands are dripping with blood oh my friends look to the word of god look to the lamb of god who taketh away the sins of the world amen it didn't take very long that this concept of father son and holy ghost to expand because satan took it one step further and moved the people away from the truth and began to push the fact of there being one eternal father and the spirit of god now incarnate in a human mother now think of it brother sister and then a divine son the fruit of that incar carnation the woman's seed and then began to propound that or teach that as the proof or foundations for the doctrine of the trinity but the devil was not content right there you see he wanted to bring the worship to himself and so he began in an indirect way to pull the worship away from god and so he takes the people further and further away from the truth and through his so-called mysteries you'll find that they talk a lot about the their so-called mysteries so he began to reveal to them that god himself is a mystery and that he is an invisible father god he's a silent god who stays in the background and doesn't say anything to his people or get involved in the affairs of men and remains silent all the time actually that was his way of trying to get the people to now begin to ignore god to ignore the true and living god by claiming that god is silent yes and it saw then we see he began to propound these teachings of meditation and these religions that base themselves on meditations unknowingly to them it's really satan's trick to get them further away from the true and the living god now look just look at the word god god meaning object of worship everybody will say god even the devil believes there's a god only the fool doesn't believe there is a god but the devil so much believe it that he trembles so don't be tricked by the devil religious person some holy man some high and mighty elevated person in this modern world that constantly uses the word god i believe in god and god is good and god is great and which god are you talking about there is only one god now you begin to nail it down which god are you talking about that's why it tells you clearly the devils believe and tremble but they do not believe that jesus christ has come in the flesh again and here amongst this people god in flesh appearing in his people through his people the same yesterday today and forever glory to god hallelujah so since he began that lie that god is silent god is in the background god doesn't want to be bothered with you now he's encouraging the people to ignore god and to draw back from the living god so since you couldn't you shouldn't worship that silent god the next way he could take your attention is away from that to the mother with the sun in her so the worship of the woman began woman worship began drawing away the attention of the people from the mastery of the word from the father god to the mother god or mother of god i don't see how that's even um sensible it doesn't make any sense whatsoever god the being without beginning without ending and then he had a mother and if he has a mother then the mother was before him and that's what the devil is actually teaching the people and they're not realizing it it's not the mother is god or mother of god that's a lie for god has no mother god is god he stands alone hallelujah he just used mary's body to manifest the flesh into which he was going to step into and because he created that flesh he called it his son god was in christ reconciling the world to himself hallelujah listen to it again god was in christ reconciling the world to himself one god the eternal being manifest within the son no mother of god god has no mother amen he has no father no beginning nor ending he is all in all he is the i am not i was i'm going to be but the i am amen glory to god hallelujah now i'm trying to show you from these church ages exactly the prophet of god taught it clearly how the devil tried to seduce the people away from the belief and faith into one god and so the worship move to the mother and child where we get all these songs and so on mother and child reunions this that the other uh everything else they're praising the woman uh mary rather than praising god giving him the glory an honor to his name the devil switch completely until that's what the people are doing adoration of mary adoration of the woman rather than worship and adoration to god so we all we also do that yes my friends but we know that that's an aversion and that is absolutely a lie now in egypt this same mother and son combination belief was called isis and orsis let me repeat isis and horses in india it was called ishi and ishwara very close same thing justice spread acro across countries and cultures and in asia it was called sibil c y b e l e and d aussies there it is of course rome and greece followed suit they followed along with it now in china also the catholic missionaries were shocked when they went into china and there in china they found a mud runner and child with rays of light emitting from the head of the baby and no christian had ever gone to china but it was a madonna and child with the buddha and they were shocked about it now you can understand how certain religions can fit into almost any other religion because they basically at the back of it all they actually have one thing they believe in many gods whether it's three whether it's three million or or 30 million is still a belief a polyistic belief when we believe according to this bible and the scriptures that there is only one god amen yes must have been shocking to them they go with their beads and and they and the buddhists shaolin priests already have beats they go with their prayer beats the priests already had their prayer beats whatever they had those priests had it already because that belief was spread that satan made sure this belief in many gods was spread in various parts of the earth and if you go into the vatican you will see that concept repeated over and over again so what are you talking about i have been there several times and have toured the entire place i i can't say entire because the vatican and rome of course is a great city great to be hold beautiful for you to be able to go to italy and to see its glory its wealth its power its building its architecture gifts of the kings unimaginable but basically my friends you will see that concept of this trinitarian doctrine we're talking about of three persons being in the one godhead you will see it throughout and in continuity throughout your time there it will be displayed all around you in various forms of course when those catholic missionaries looked at the babe and the mother the only difference was the facial characteristics because every race or nation will draw their their belief of what they see with the characteristics of their people so when they saw it that's the way they saw it but the idea the thought was exactly and identically the same so then that suggests it didn't originate just from rome it did not originate era there it's originated where the bible says it came from out of beibel after the confusion of languages seems like they had a confusion of gods but also because out of there came this this madness this evil seduction of satan that threw the people away from one god before that time all the peoples of the earth believed in one god after babel after that time then this great migration away from the one god teaching and belief in the bible began to drift into darkness now the original mother and child because all these other concept came off of one original and that original came from in babylon now the name of the original modern child was semaramis and her son was called rhea semaramis and ria in the east and in her arms she held a babe who was described as tall strong handsome and captivating to women read in your bible ezekiel chapter 8 verse 14. in ezekiel chapter 8 verse 14 the bible describes him or calls him or names him by the name tammuz tammuz t-a-n-m-u-z among classical writers he was called bacchus bacchus to the babylonians he was called nemos n-i-n-u-s which accounts for the fact ninus even to this day nino nina you know it's speaking of a child he's represented as a babe in arms and yet though he was a baby in arms he was described as a great and mighty man called the husband son one of his titles was that he was the child and yet he was the husband of the mother and in india where they are known as ishii and ishwara we know that it represented the husband at the breast of his own wife these things can be read from history just read it in antiquity and next week i will continue for then we now enter into the life and times of the biblical character described in genesis 10 verses 8 to 10 called nimrod we will see that this same ninus spoken of in babylonian uh so-called writings semiramis tammuz all these things you will find it all leads right to nimrod spoken off in the bible and we will discuss him we will bring forth the truth of the word of god about him and open up your understanding of the origins of this trinitarian doctrine its attitude actions its characteristics of blood and lust for power and various other aspects i trust that this would have wetted your appetite and opened it up so that next week we can come believing receiving and go rejoicing in the name of the lord jesus christ may the lord jesus bless you and keep you in his wonderful love and care heavenly father we ask your blessing upon all these that have taken the time out lord in the middle of their week to receive the uh word of god made this simple uh simple thought of the word father impress itself upon their hearts and minds and bless us we pray in every way in jesus christ's name amen god bless you my brothers and sisters we will meet again on sunday praise god where we will continue speaking about the fresh water from the well of bethlehem fresh water from the well of bethlehem may the lord jesus pour out may the man with the water pot pour out the opening of the word upon us and bless us together next week we will get into the character and background of nimrod in the bible god bless you [Music] you
