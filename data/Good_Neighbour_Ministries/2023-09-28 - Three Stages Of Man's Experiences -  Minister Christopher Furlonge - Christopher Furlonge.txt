Lord as we just wait upon you Lord and whatever you would have to say to our hearts tonight in Jesus name we pray amen you're maybe seated tonight amen hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus amen Hallelujah priest which is wonderful name and just to recap a little bit you know the last time we we mentioned about Nicodemus amen he was a a rich man he doesn't have need of anything man but he was lacking one thing he wasn't satisfied with the life he was living and many of us that are here tonight we might acquire all these good things in life man like even the The Prodigal Son man he had it made for him because it came a point in time in his life he asks for like give me what you have for me I want to go and have some experience of any world men because he had something lacking in him and I would like to or maybe a little bit later on to give you a little bit about my testimony man it's good to testify about the Lord of your experience with him how did you get your candle lit man amen hallelujah because that you become an example to them that God can change lives you are going down a rocky dangerous road man I don't know how what were the Lord or what channel the Lord is going to take us here tonight but I just trusting in Him tonight amen because in myself I ain't got many much to say to you but when he speaks you know something is going to happen Hallelujah and I trusted in him tonight amen Hallelujah you see Nicodemus had questions amen amen he wanted to know amen Hallelujah praise God he said rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God and many people know that you are God-fearing person and there's something in your life that demonstrate that there is something more than what they have that they would want man and you need to share that with them and to be a witness to them how God changed your life amen hallelujah so Nicodemus wanted you know he said no this man they're called Jesus amen I know but an assurance with a surety that he came from God man Hallelujah and thou do as miracles and accept God be accept God be with him amen and the people know that God is with you Man by the life you demonstrate man Hallelujah so it is not only to be in church here to put on a religious act amen hallelujah but when you're out in the womb that is that you become a minister men and women children the children in his school amen the life you demonstrate to your fellow students they're gonna know there's a difference in you Hallelujah and Jesus said verily verily I say unto you except a man be born again so there is something there got to be born again are you already in this world already my mom and my dad and my mom gave birth to me I'm already here why should I be born again what kind of a a statement is that that you're going to be born again but from the understanding from our Prophet amen hallelujah the 20th century Prophet man Hallelujah you were born wrong to begin with and so you're going to have to get the right birth amen hallelujah I want to make this by God's help and Grace make this simple to you amen hallelujah thank you amen that evening littlest child can understand it men because God is a god of simplicity amen Hallelujah to him be praised on on Glory tonight amen you see we were supposed to come by the spoken word and to be born again you need to be you need to come by the spoken word for your hour for your day amen hallelujah man glory be to God and that is just unfolding how God is showing his children these things amen hallelujah prayers be to his name thank you Lord Hallelujah you see the Rich Young Ruler amen he was rich he was wrong and he had position he was a high society person so really and truly he didn't lack anything Naturally Speaking but deep down inside of him he knew that there was something lacking he need to have a real experience amen hallelujah because he had all your experiences out there gaining money wealth popularity and everything else amen he had all that experience that the world could have offered to him but you see this to be born again that was a natural birth amen but to be spiritually born it could take spiritual things amen hallelujah it's only going to take God to do that for you amen hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus praise be to his name glory to God so when he could not accept the solution to his problem man he was very much disappointed and you know sometimes when we get this solution to our situation to our problems amen you know we sometimes we question it we question it sometimes we feel it's too hard or it may be too simple like the the lady the ruler who had when it is Philip I believe oh baptized in the Jordan River I believe it is right amen amen hallelujah that song Too simple for him but that was the answer to his problem amen hallelujah praise God praise God you see on the day of Pentecost and Pentecost as I always say as plenticost the Christian life is not easy it's not a better roses by now you should realize that man by all the opposition all the these things the the things that people say about you and to you amen why are you following that church why are you doing this why are you doing that you could have stayed you know home and do something else or you know something always the enemy always puts something to discourage you from serving God all the time or you're too tired tonight you know well last night I didn't sleep too well you know so I had to stay home and get some rest but you see these things this sacrifice that you make for God always pay big man you see God don't own no man you sacrifice your time your talent and everything to him God pays you big man you don't maybe understand it right now but you see later on it's down the road you're going to look back and see how God took you through and brought you out that situations men Hallelujah by simple a simple thing as attending church man making yourself present here man Hallelujah so if the Lord should come tonight amen and only for those who hear what's going to happen to the others man Hallelujah so live today like it's the last we gotta work yes we gotta do things yes amen but make your sacrifice unto him Hallelujah simple things to be reminded of glory be to God Hallelujah as we said Pentecost has plenty cause and the last time we touched on only the predestinated seed can be born again because there's something inside of them to be born again to be dominated to be to be brought alive amen and you have to come with that amen you can't buy yourself into it man you can't walk yourself into it you have to be you have to be in the mind of God before the foundations of the world to be expressed here now as a son and as a daughter of God amen hallelujah and to be born again as we touched last time is to have a need to change amen amen so if you know that your nature hasn't been changed go check back on the experience you had amen if it was a true Born Again experience man if you're continuing the things of the world and have that is desire and I learning a deep desire inside to just go out in the world and do the things that it was something wrong with your experience and don't let Satan come and lie to you now if you're a true Born Again experience and it kind of let it gets you know a little bit lukewarm go back to where you started off man Hallelujah praise God and we spoke a little bit about a woman from Canaan amen who had a deep a situation happening with her man and she had to press her away for her blessings and tonight press your way into the kingdom of God press your way for your blessing tonight you have a desire for whatever it may be the enemy don't give it to you easy you know something is going to happen and he will put every obstacle in the way to prevent you from getting it amen that job you're looking for that house you may be looking for that car you may be looking for amen that race that you were expecting so long amen that's healing that's just natural thing that healing in your body amen Satan I've been lying to you so long man it's time to take a stand and say no more put your foot down amen claim your blessing tonight man and receive it amen hallelujah Reach Out And Touch him tonight man Hallelujah praise be to God and we spoke about you can't join a church amen you've got to be born into that church you got to have that Born Again experience into the living body and the spirit of the Living God Amen into that church amen if you're joined our natural churches just like joining our lodge amen hallelujah but when you're born into the kingdom of God you're born into the living Hallelujah the spirit of the Living God Amen Hallelujah and you have that real true experience that will anchor you amen you'll give your anchor post that you can look back at typos in your life so you know and that certain time you know God gave me this experience you open up my understanding to know that I am a son that I am a daughter of God men Hallelujah it's not that you just been made a son you were always a son but is Daniel recognize that I am a son and I am a daughter of God Amen Hallelujah praise God Hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus and tonight I just want to go into these three stages of a man's experience amen hallelujah Amino natural Iman is made of body soul and spirit amen amen just as we have the Christian walk we have justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen praise God so in Natural Things man has three steps and also in spiritual things man has three stages them man mine has been up like a Triune being Hallelujah we communicate with the natural world by our five senses man and we communicate with his soul by affection Amen Hallelujah by memory by conscience by reason Amen Hallelujah by imagination amen and that is the the Avenue that the the soul has been you can connect to the soul amen hallelujah praise God now I'd like to just take a little type from the temple Solomon's Temple or the temple that was in the wilderness How It Was Made Up and give you a little reference of how you can have extreme experiences amen how man can have three experiences with God notice this manner is a very perfect type of the Holy Ghost remember Mana fell every night and they had to get a new Supply every day amen they had to get a supply every day man so that's so what you experience yes you say I have a born-again experience but you know from the children of the in Israel when they were hungry they had to go they were crying for food and God gave them manna from above for them amen hallelujah and they had to pick it up every day and they could not keep it for another day otherwise it will turn wiggle tails of worms man now so with your experience you need something a new a a new uh experience every day with the Lord man as always our pastor say you can't Sail on yesterday's Breeze are you can't you know survive on yesterday's experience now if we take a if if we take a note here you know there are a lot of people around the prophet they were experiencing only Miracles all the healings and everything they had an experience then and they still continuing you know speaking about experience that you've had with the prophet physically and without understanding the deeper things that he was bringing to them man so they continue with that and it's it's gonna fade out All I'm gonna talk about the healings the Miracles that this and that and yet but what about the food that he was storing up just as the Moses commanded Aaron to take some of that manner and put it into the holy of holies and it's going to remain fresh all the time and that what is what the prophet was doing stirring up Manna for us now to feed on not on healings and miracles alone man Hallelujah so they will continue talking about you know the prophet when they're hunting and he catch this and this and that and all our experience but what about the hidden manner that he stood up I have a feeling on that for now man amen hallelujah for now amen hallelujah blessed be his wonderful name amen you see that Manara came down amen Hallelujah a priest didn't give Big Data make that for them that was Heavenly Mana man Hallelujah and they couldn't buy it or or do something else no interference with that none whatsoever so that is what happened when the Seven Seas were broke man Mana came out amen revealed word for this hour came out amen Raptor in feet came out from that and you have to feed on that as your feet and your natural body as it changes along every day you have to feed on that spiritual manner to give you Rapture and Faith to change us to take us out of here Hallelujah so what is the experience are you feeding on that manner that is being present right now that is available for each and every one amen hallelujah but you know something if you eat Tamanna is it will be bitter in your belly it will give you a bitter experience man Hallelujah but you know what it's changing you it's changing from the inside out Hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus amen hallelujah every day with Jesus is sweeter than the day before amen so you got to have a new experience every day and it's gonna draw you closer and closer to him it's going to give you bill you in this Tatia of a perfect man with more love more grace more humility and all those things that are going to make you mature amen a mature grain for his Harvest Hallelujah thank you Lord praise be to God hallelujah you see on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell from Heaven amen they received their Manna for that day amen hallelujah and it's the same original Pentecost experience they had done with that manner that was filled that fell then you need to have it now too man Hallelujah yes David has spoken tongues but that was just an expression of the experience that they had amen explain it amen and you can explain actually you can explain the Born Again experience to somebody you can't give it to them they got to experience it for themselves Hallelujah thank you Lord thank you Father praise God and you see that experience as Peter was saying it's available it was available for it was available to them and it's available to us and to all those amen who are far off if not to this day amen hallelujah amen and there were three stages of everything back then and there are three stages of your experience no when we say we take a look at the the the the the temple we see the outer Court man and as I asked there are experiences out on the outer Court amen and don't let your experience and their outer Court determine your stand with the Lord amen because these natural Sun was shining in the outer Court rain could be fallen amen you have some rainy days man sad days amen so mopedes man some trials and testing this amen so don't let that determine your stand with the Lord that's just on the outer Court digest and experience on the outer court but God wants to take a man a little step further amen and a little step further he would take he was going to take him to the inner amen the force God where there was artificial life amen hallelujah the candles Scandal stick amen so if you run out of oil then amen if you ever run outside your experience if you're a run out of some uh some Holy Ghost experience amen you'll feel dong your iron low amen hallelujah so it's going to determine now and the physical environment that you're in amen go determine your mood and whatever you have around you so don't let that alone determine who you really are amen hallelujah you see the next man come into the first Court there were seven golden candlestick that was a good light but many times this Candlestick went out the lamps moved up he lived by an artificial light someday he was up someday he was down and someday he must be all to the ground amen right that's the way with the Christian experience if you're only living in a Justified State going to church and saying well I did the best I can you're going to have many rainy days amen Hallelujah you're going to have days when you're going to wonder and whether Miracles are right or not you're going to wonder if you're saved or not the enemy comes around and tells you see what you just do that see you really ain't safe enough that experience he was talking about that you're really not that enough amen because you're just on the you're just only the the full Squad amen praise God and all those kinds of Scruples and things are going to pass through your mind the enemy will come in and bombard you I'm telling you that you know you you say you are Christian yeah look look what you just said look look look look look what you just did amen hallelujah but you know something God wants to take you closer than that if you walk into a little Fellowship with the church again with that they're the seven candlesticks where the offering was only made and the sacrifice burned and you still have Smoky days and rainy days cloudy days days when the light was out there's when the lamp smoked up your experience my you don't want that right Smokey days experience amen you can't really see a way through this problem you really can't see your way through this situation but God is here to bring you out of that amen hallelujah he started a good work in you and you're going to see a trip through the end so it's just a passing you're passing these stages and a Christian life for this Christian work is a walk of a process God has taken you to a process you want to know why all the trials and testing and all the things that come in around you it's not to break you it's not just to make you bitter was to make you better man Hallelujah so don't don't fuss the fume the Fret amen stand up to who you really are amen that I am a son I am a daughter of God and I am above what the enemy is trying to let to tell me I am he will always bring condemnation to you amen he's the accuser of the Brethren you will always come and accuse you of something Hallelujah amen but the man who walked in that holy of holies it didn't matter whether the sun shined or not amen Hallelujah it didn't matter whether the can was burned or not he lived in the light of the Shekinah Glory amen hallelujah we had a pillar of fire is and you are in the presence of the king what better place to be time to be in his presence it doesn't matter what situation happened no matter what is happening if they ordain the world amen hardship this pestilence this data you are secured you are locked away you are locked in you are in the inner Veil you don't hear the noise from outside the enemy is making a whole certain noise outside but you ain't hearing it man you're blocked out at that amen hallelujah amen you are under the the interlocked wings of the cherubim and all the time he was walking in the perfect light you are walking in perfect light and fellowship so no matter what this one's saying about you that one thing about you you are in perfect fellowship with God and you are with peace with God man but when you have peace you have proof Fellowship cultural communion you could talk to one another man and a one-to-one basis when you are peace with God as a scripture we read first when you are Justified you have peace with God our Father do you have peace tonight perfect peace perfect rest amen hallelujah and there is perfect peace there is perfect rest Hallelujah and it's available for you and I tonight amen hallelujah blessed be his wonderful name Hallelujah praise God praise God he didn't look out the outside to the rainy days there was never a rainy day there was never a doubt in his mind in his heart amen that he is in the presence of God the father he is in the presence of the almighty God that all things are possible with him so what's it what you're worrying about tonight man nothing should worry you tonight yes you have situations yes you have that but my God is able amen the god of Shadrach meshachana Bendigo the god of these three Hebrew boys my God is able to deliver my God is able to heal my God is able to provide because you know why he already done it it's for you to claim it amen hallelujah it's available for you but it's how much you could believe for tonight amen how big is your tanker or you just want a little Spoonful or you want a truckload or you want this yeah you want to be tapped into the source of your supplies amen hallelujah where the glory never fails man because you are living in the presence of the king Hallelujah praise God he had no worry no more certainly not he was inside the world was locked outside men Hallelujah praise God that's what the church needs today is an experience that'll take you into this Shekinah Glory men where all the curtains will fall on high demand from the things of the world man so there's no attraction you know as I will always say the love of the world and the things of the world Amen you take out the love of the world the L of world and you'll get the word so you love the word so you're locked out from the world so you're in the word you're in the presence of God amen hallelujah thank you Lord and He is the world amen hallelujah thank you Lord till you live in the presence of God under his great power under the unlocked wing and interlocked wings of the Holy Ghost and in the cross you'll stand and the cross does not become a burden to you so you can sing I take up my cross and follow Jesus it's not a burden anymore amen hallelujah you will love to take the cross up amen what he has done for you amen you have to appreciate him so much in your praise in your Worship in your Thanksgiving Amen in everything that you do amen do it unto him Hallelujah when you think of the burdens every day the sun is shining amen I'll cross the river and whale the river and Veil where the glory never feels I am living in the presence of the king amen hallelujah man you can have it friends for each one of you tonight my brothers and sisters sins of God you can have it tonight amen and I believe you have it you got all of it amen hallelujah you shot in with him in a secret place Hallelujah no more worries very no you're just praise him for his Wonderful Grace amen hallelujah praise God thank you Lord Hallelujah and the prophet you know he brought he brought his nice little I believe it's a song Amen here the sun is always Shining here the sky is always bright it gives no place for gloomy Christians to abide for my soul this filled with rapture as I live a watch and pray we are living on the Hallelujah side so you could really show Hallelujah because you're living in the Hallelujah side amen hallelujah praise God and what is the evidence of a genuine Born Again Spirit-filled son or daughter of God Hallelujah every day every time you meet them they got the victory in their heart amen you can't it's not a skin deep religion man it's deep it's embedded in the heart it's branded it in the heart it's engraved in your heart so no matter what you do to them it ain't gonna stop throw them off amen hallelujah they're praising God whether the sun is shining or not whether I have money in their pocket or not whether things good or bad or not amen they are praising God all the time Hallelujah they're living in the presence of the king don't you want that hidden life tonight amen amen there is something real about that man if you haven't experienced that there's it's really it's real God is real this presence is real men His blessings are real Hallelujah and the Raptors will one of these days we're gonna be fully in the presence of him what we feel here now that presence you feel here now it's drawing into drawing you into that great presence amen hallelujah one of these days is going to be manifested we're going to be fully engulfed in that presence hallelujah what a day that will be amen thank you Lord Jesus praise God hallelujah what is Grace is what God did for you man Hallelujah and what is books works is what you do for God in appreciation of the grace that he imparted unto you amen did you get that Hallelujah praise God so we need to be thankful of his grace all the time appreciate God's grace if it was for the grace of God where would I be where would I be without Jesus where would I spend eternity yourself lost and undone without God or Islam where would you spend eternity my without Jesus where would I be hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus Hallelujah praise God praise God as we said to be born again is to have and nature change to have a born again experience is to have a need to change amen so the born-again experience tells us who we are it doesn't mean that we don't believe in shouting and all the manifestation and demonstration of the spirit but yet that's not it biblical shout and scream and holler and do everything else amen that has just been anointed in the flesh amen but to have a real Born Again experience is from the heart amen it's something different from that you become a new creation you become a new Creator creature the things that you used to do you do them no more the places that you used to go you go there that those places no more because the desire for those things are not are in within you there's no pull Satan can't pull on that and send you to the bathroom to send you to the the nightclub and the dance party and everything amen hallelujah because the desire is not there in you no more my life has been changed and only the Lord Jesus Christ could have done it no priest could have done it nope nope nobody has gone done it amen hallelujah only God the Lord Jesus Christ could change my life from what I was to where I am now Hallelujah is not all is not all I want to be but I'm heading for that hallelujah amen glory to God praise is wonderful then thank you Lord Jesus praise God Hallelujah you see it's just not to say I've been born again but you've got to demonstrate by the way you live that the experience you have that you're truly born again amen Hallelujah many times we think that well if we are born again we we got happy man we shouted we spoke with tongues or we money or manifested God in some way but Brethren you know that's not it we may see people jump shout dance cheat lie steal and everything else and we know that that isn't it born again that isn't it Hallelujah if you want praise God when Martin Luther said the just shall live by faith he said we got it and John we as he came along with something new and Luther was right so far as he said that Josh shall live by faith and he thought he had it but he found out that wasn't it there was a step higher than that man Hallelujah where's he came man yes shouted he said you got it amen and found out that they didn't have it Pentecost shouted speaking tongues shout dance and everything said they got it what did they really have it no they did Hallelujah and the fruit of the spirit is not shouting speaking in tongues that attributes of the Holy Spirit of course but it can be impersonated amen Hallelujah so if you want a true example amen listen or take your example or experience from Paul from characters in The Bible man Hallelujah if you want to match up your life match it up with Paul yes he was like that but look where God took him it took a true experience from God to knock him off his high horse for him to bite the dust amen Amen to turn his life around because when you you look at his life he was killing the very sad people that he was going to join up with man so when people see Paul coming or Saul as you may say no Paul's Saul do any questions or us all coming they were saying head's Gonna Roll boy they're going to take our heads off man Hallelujah but look what God did to him change his life totally we are wrong that look how many books in the Bible he said and after all he said what could separate me from the love of God man could you say the same thing here tonight what could separate you from the love of God popularity woman sickness whatever you name it that this world has to over what gonna separate you don't do like a is um what's his name in the Bible um Esau amen sell out for a plate of food to get the right Bird to get the boat right man would you sell out so cheap cheap I don't think so man what the experience you have with God you cherish it you can look back at your life every single time and say God changed my life amen you see I'll give you a little testimony I was brought up in a Christian home amen at the young age of nine years old I lost my mom right you know people go through some bitter experience in in life right and always question God and say God is not a good god look how all the hard things are going through and the hardships and all the disciples I show every single one of you I went to some bad experience in your life some disappointment some tragic moment in your life man you could look back at that to that and make you bitter for the rest of your life man but that you see once you have something inside once God implanted something inside later on when God turned your life around then you can look back at that and know that God was with you all along life's journey man they could say look children without parents they go out there you see a lot go astray how come you didn't go astray yeah yes brought up in a Chris a message home believe it home but at that young age we went to Sunday school went to church no desire no pool inside yes so going to churches really changed you will be make you a Christian we understand the schoolmaker Christian nothing like that paying tithes being a regular member in church doing all the things that are necessary will make you a born-again Believer no sir you gotta have a real experience with God man many tragic moments in my life I went through I gotta just give up just you know something's happening people like their mind is send them both snap them they're going crazy
