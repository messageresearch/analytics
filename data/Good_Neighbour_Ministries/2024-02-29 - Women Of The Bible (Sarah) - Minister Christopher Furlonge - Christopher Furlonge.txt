amen as we said you know not too many women were mentioned in the bible but the few of them that were mentioned had a great impact in their day and even up to this day our first little study we went in was with Eve right amen that she was the mother of all living amen and through Eve amen we all here today amen and we saw the fall and all that right our next little study we taking tonight on one of the wom in the Bible is Sarah amen praise God and we just want to read the scripture taken from Genesis 17:15 amen and I like you know tonight we have a baptism amen by God's grace amen and I don't want to be too long tonight I wanted to start a little bit earlier but I'm not going to finish our little thought here tonight we're going to continue the next time amen hallelujah I just to welcome our precious brother here with us tonight brother Henry amen welcome in his presence amen scripture reading taken from Genesis 17 15 and verse 16 amen it's up on the board there it's up yeah and before we read the word let us just pray just bow our hearts our gracious God and eternal heavenly father just thank you Lord for your grace in our lives Lord for taking us through this day and

father bless the reading of the word and bless the hearers may you are anoint it to their hearts that something may be said tonight to encourage someone Lord we just commit each and everyone into your presence in Jesus name amen hallelujah here we see and God said unto Abraham as for Sarai thy wife Thou shalt not call her name Sarai but Sarah shall her name be amen and verse 16 and I will bless her now this is a promise I will bless her who is talking there I will bless her When God Says something it doesn't fail amen Heaven and Earth is going to pass away but his promise word to you and I will never pass away it must accomplish what it was sent for to accomplish so here God say I will not I maybe man not guessing I will positive I will bless her and gave thee a son also of her yeah I will bless her and she shall be a mother of Nations Kings of people shall be of her when the go Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you all may be seated tonight hallelujah thank you Lord you know we all here and this cold night it was nice and beautiful in the morning and it's like temperature just went 20 25 degrees below and you say oh my you could have stayed home but God saw it fit that you're going to be here and you're glad you're going to say after all I'm glad that I came you must have already already been blessed by the songs that you were singing amen amen hallelujah just by the songs that you were singing you were already blessed so this is a added blessing to what you already received Hallelujah now in Genesis we find a man by the name of Abraham the son of ham that came down probably from Babylon an idol worshiper and he came down in the valley of shinar and dwell in the land of chalia the city of her he was married to his half sister Sarai now you'll see where their names were changed amen and God had a reason for changing their names Hallelujah and as they came down in that land Abraham wasn't better than anyone else man he wasn't better than nobody else just as you and I why did God chose you amen we were out there doing our own thing we weren't even seeking God we were doing uh attending all the parties drinking and and doing everything else we weren't seeking God but God was seeking you amen and he will create certain circumstances even for around your life to know that he's the one that is calling you amen hallelujah praise God see but God by Sovereign Grace and election amen called Abraham and it's by God's election to you he called you amen hallelujah you didn't choose God God chose you as you always know you were chosen before the foundations of this worlden and God God already knew who going to accept him and who's going to reject him so you already place your name in the Lamb's Book of Life so when you came down here you came down with part of him inside of you already you didn't recognize that yet amen until until you hear that voice speaking to your heart amen hallelujah praise God so God called Abraham by election according to his election not by some priest by your father or your mother by some man but that election was by God himself Hallelujah nothing amen that Abraham could have done was better than anybody else he was an idol worshipper man and we today we have a lot of people today have Idols in their lives it might be a idol on a wall or a painting on a wall it might it be some personality out there amen you might worship your car your house amen you might worship money amen something that you placed in front of the true and living God that becomes your God and Idol hallelujah praise God you see Abraham wasn't a Believer from the beginning when God called him but God with his unmerited grace Abraham was saved amen and Not only was he saved but when God called Abraham he saved him and gave him his Covenant unconditionally now we here we I'm speaking my title tonight we're teaching is on Sarah but why is Abraham you're talking about Abraham so much amen because without mentioning Abraham hallelujah or if you mention Sarah you can't leave out Abraham at all because her whole life was hinged WR Abraham Hallelujah you see when God call him when he call Abraham he didn't call Abraham alone and he called his wife too the two were one hallelujah praise God so we see here it was always amen hallelujah [Applause] Sarah meaning princess or a noble woman in the Old Testament and she was the wife of Abraham and mother of Isaac Sarah was childless until she was 90 years old amen hallelujah praise God thank you Lord Jesus hallelujah thank you Lord just give me one moment here my brother something is see with all this modern day technology something is trying to my notes here oh my wow wow wow okay but Alvin come come a minute please bring this the stick you have there with please Hallelujah see the the enemy has been fighting all day halfway to church I had to turn back and go home that's why is I'm a little bit late here tonight Hallelujah just open up that um Word document for me please sir Hallelujah so we talking about Sarah tonight amen amen hallelujah and when we speak about Sarah put yourself in the picture amen when you see the life and when we were speaking about wom in the Bible you see woman types the church Hallelujah so praise God there we go thank you my brother Hallelujah so when we speak about Sarah we cannot leave out Abraham not at all in Genesis we find The Man by the name of Abraham the son of heram that came down probably from Babylon and as I said he was an idol worshipper amen hallelujah and dwelt in the land of chalia the city of Earth and he was married to his half sister sari could you put up uh the slide three please Genesis 11: 2931 we will get we we'll get on track very soon amen hallelujah praise God you know the devil is on your track and you're trying to turn your back all the time you all the time you're trying to hinder you but God's word is going to go for tonight the greater the battle the bigger and better the blessings hallelujah amen hallelujah and Abraham and no took them wives and the name of Abraham's wife was Sarai amen and the name of nahor's wife was milka the daughter of Haron the father of milka and the father of ishka but Sarah was Barren she had no child and Thea took Abraham his son and lot the son of Haron his son's sons and Sarah his daughter-in-law his son Abraham's wife and they went forth with them from o of the chales to go into the land of Canaan and they came unto Haron amen praise God so as we see here amen Abra Abraham as he was known then when God called himen they were living in that land of Haron right and they came down in this land and Abraham wasn't better than anyone else as we were saying amen hallelujah but when God called Abraham he saved him and he gave him his Covenant unconditionally no attachment to it amen hallelujah hallelujah when we was studying Eve it had conditions because God gave them if you do this this going to happen amen if you eat of that Forbidden Fruit of the tree amen you're going to die and you're going to surely die so there was a condition attached to that but with Abraham here now the promise that he gave to Abraham he said I will praise God Amen I will unconditional nothing attached to it God promised it and he's going to fulfill it no matter what it takes is going to happen Hallelujah so what's God promis you tonight Hallelujah we don't want to jump ahead now the Lord had said unto Abraham get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land that I will show you amen hallelujah slide four amen you got it up there now the Lords and I will make thee a great nation so here you seen this is not what anybody else is promising God himself saying I going to do this to you I am going to make you a great nation and I will bless you did God promise he going to bless you amen hallelujah and make thy name great and thou shall be a blessing so when God bless you you're going to be a blessing to others Hallelujah and I will bless them that bless thee and curse them them that curse thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed anyone who sides with God's chosen people are going to be blessed amen that's a promise of just it just naturally happens amen what about the children of Israel Jews anywhere they go and they were accept did God bless those people who receed them amen that's history Hallelujah so Abraham departed as the Lord had spoken unto him and lot went with him big mistake Hallelujah and Abraham was 75 years old when he departed out of Haron and Abraham took Sarah Abra Abraham took Sarah his wife and lot his brother's son and all their substance they had gathered and the souls that they had gotten in Haron and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan and into the land of Canaan they came amen so as we said this blessing when God called Abraham it wasn't for him alone it was for his wife amen Hal Hallelujah and when God calls amen a man hallelujah hallelujah most of the times and I said a lot of times God blesses his wife and calls her out too amen hallelujah praise God now just just pause here a moment put yourself into Abraham's shoes if one day your husband comes to you and say listen we living here no you have to give up all your family all your the things you accumulated over the years all your friends all the attachments that you had we H you have to give it up because you know what God spoke to me or some Angel spoke you might say spoke to me and said we we are leaving here you got to go what you going to ask this man man you would say well listen we leaving here but where are we going you know that first question you might ask as a woman you going to ask your husand listen where are we going well you see this angel or this man that I meet or this angel or this God that I me he said listen I going to show you where you're going but you mean to say you don't know where you're going and you're listening to this man he telling you he yes giving you an idea where you're going yes siren eyes haven't seen as hav heard the things that God has promised to you and ien you ever seen it you feel it you see a picture of it amen amen but something deep down in your heart telling you that is the truth amen and that is the faith that Abraham had in her husband that whatever he said I going to believe it where he go goes I will go I'll follow him all the way an obedient wife amen Hallelujah obedient to a husband God call you to this walk it may look strange to the people out there you mean to say oh you going in a rapt here there's a heaven waiting for all you you have a you mean you have a new body waiting for you without sickness or pain or anything have you ever experience something like that do you know anybody who uh um experience that and come back and tell you amen but we know we have evidence know and we believe the true report Hallelujah Glory thank you Lord amen so she believed her husband she didn't fuss she didn't fight she didn't fret she packed up everything amen that she could have carry and they left amen hallelujah praise God and some of us want to take too much on this journey we want to take a a tractor load or a container load with us amen hallelujah let all them thing yeah you know God tell them you have to separate yourself separate and you know mean separate cut it off get rid of of it take away all the attachments you have to it amen and a lot of us like to bring around a lot of baggage when we going on this journey so God is asking us we have to separate and God will bring certain conditions around your life that you have to leave them behind a true son or daughter of God circumstances going to come around your life that you have to leave it behind the weight that so easily beset you pull you away from serving God pull you away from coming to church pull you away from praying amen pull you away from worshiping a lot of things in know amen we have to separate ourself fromen the things that so easily catch our attentions and draw us away from God and there's so many things out there now amen so deceptive and deceitful that will draw us away from the presence of God hallelujah praise God see we see now so s Sarai obeyed her husband and she went along with him now as we have read in Genesis 17 and 16 which says I will bless her and give her as son of her own amen amen as we read she going to be a a a mother of all Nations man and This Promise was given to her when she was at the age of 65 way past childbearing now remember we read she was Barren she couldn't have any children children amen hallelujah praise God hallelujah now when God called Abraham and Sarah they were living with tra that was Abraham's father amen and God said unto him get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House onto a land that I will show you amen did God when God called you did he showed you that Promised Land amen but you know we are already partaking of some of them fruits that over there amen sweet know enjoy really you enjoy those fruits peace Joy amen godliness patience when you have the peace of God nobody can explain that to you and it pass all understanding true peace amen hallelujah and that is some some fruits that are over on that side amen hallelujah and we could go in all the types and shadows tonight amen and we going to take all night no but tonight I'm not going to keep you all very long amen we just do a little background of Sarah amen hallelujah Hallelujah and in the message Slide Five of God's covenant with Abraham and his seed are you Abraham's Faith seed tonight because the same faith that Abraham had his seed has it amen hallelujah praise God see when God called Abraham he called him for total separation separate yourself from your Kinsmen separate yourself from your father's house separate from all your Associates and completely ANH helate yourself from all these things and walk with me what that separation amen hallelujah tonight we have a water baptism amen hallelujah and God is calling each and everyone in that walk in that newness of life amen hallelujah when all your past leave it in the past cut off all the things that hindering you in this Christian pathway in this walk amen hallelujah you know we I like to repeat the Simplicity of the Gospel the basic things the everyday living things that will make you overcome the struggles and the battles that are in this life and there are many many when you decide to serve the Lord then the enemy really comes after youen because he don't have you he losing one amen and we like to instruct the brother tonight is a good stand he's taking amen we all got to pray for him pray for one another amen amen hallelujah that God will strengthen him and encourage him in this step that he's taking the best step you could take in your entire life is to serve the true and living God there's nothing better than that nothing Hallelujah nothing amen and you will enjoy salvation man nobody said the road is going to be easy Hallelujah see God called Abraham in a wilderness walk he took him in the desert know amen and he could have start complaining from there and then if you have been to Israel and the surrounding area is all sand and rock and all all the things and know a dry place and know Hallelujah but you know something when you have faith in the one that calls you amen he's going to take you to an ois everything might be looking dry and dry up and thirsty around your life amen the battles may be strong hot and heavy amen you know what God is testing you to see us stand if you're going to continue or you going to give up easy hallelujah praise God and why God does that is to bring out the real part that is in you hallelujah praise God praise God thank you Lord what privilege is when a man is being called like that how happy a real Christian is to separate himself separate yourself amen so God is calling for total separation from unbelief amen from unbelief and as we spoke before what is unbelief sin is what is sin sin is unbelieving not believing God God's word so Abraham took God at his word and he never gave up he never faled amen hallelujah though the battles were strong hot and heavy around his life he still continue to press on Hallelujah you say why I talking so much about Abraham because it's typing Sarah through Abraham because it's the B of them enough amen Sarah could I be going to him every time man what is this all about you promised that you're going to take me to a better place or something like that God didn't say I'm going to take you to a a a better EAS he said I'm going to show you where I going to carry you man but the way from here to here may be rugged but at the end of the road is going to be joyous amen is going to have a real Harvest hallelujah praise God he said Abraham beside all this I will beside this I not if you will I am I've already settled it and I'm going to make a covenant with you now Abraham and I'm going to make you an air to the whole world and all nations and and you'll be the father of every nation and I'm going to make a covenant with you and your seed you've come to me in an old age and there's no doubt about it you've going to do a great work for me and besides I'm going to give you a child by Sarah your wife through him all nations shall be blessed Hallelujah God has promised us a Rapture amen he has promised us a body change you might say a new Bo a new being just like how Abraham was promised a child God has promised you a new being a new body imagine that without without any wrinkles in it without any gray hairs in it without any pain in it no worries you know stress is the biggest Factor now in this world that's happening now causing heart attack causing cancer causing diabetes causing all kind of thing pressure on man's mind causing all kind of diseases it putting the body out a whack so all kind of thing Creeps in amen and takes over amen hallelujah so release the stress and pressure by serving the true and living God he promised amen when you leave all your burdens At His Feet he's the one who going to take care of it amen cast all your cares upon Him cast all just give it to him give it all to Jesus amen give it all to him hallelujah thank you Lord now we see Abraham in this walk that God called him to you know he never stopped and stayed in a place too long he kept moving on as God's spirit has you know guide him and directed him amen and as you see from the scripture yeah in Genesis 12: 7 it says and the Lord appeared unto Abraham and he said unto thy seed will I give thee this land and there he build he an altar unto the Lord who appeared unto him Genesis 129 and Abraham journeyed going on still towards the South amen hallelujah so he never put down roots and say well this is it I'm settled here amen hallelujah until God took him down Amen to the outskirts of Sodom Hallelujah where the bright lights were where the city life was very very attractive and Satan loves to bring us to the bright lights Amen to add to the attractive things where the life seem so easygoing in amen you have everything all the money all the woman all the parties to attend to all the the hierarchy and big shot all the dressing and everything else and Satan loves to attract you with those things amen but beside it all God was blessing Abraham so much amen that it comes at it came a time in his life when he had to separate himself from lot and lot represents the nominal church or the nominal Christian or the nomal or the unbeliever how you might want to put it man and as we said God is calling you for separation but when God called Abraham he didn't call lot but God took lot um Abraham took lot with him and he took his father I believe his father with him too amen and God could not bless him the way he want wanted to bless him until they had to separate them amen hallelujah praise God and we see that lot went down to Sodom and Abraham took the hillside amen and and in Genesis 121 say and it came to pass when he was come near into Egypt that he said unto Sarai his wife behold now I know that thou art a fear woman to look upon so from the very s day that God gave Sarah or Abraham and Sarah that promise though she was Barren she didn't have any CH children amen their bodies started to change right as they journeyed and walk with the Lord their bodies started to change not only internally but externally it started to show when you started to walk in this revealed word at this hour God already started to change you and we always he the Rapture is already in you it's a process amen and one day you're going to see the full manifestation of that process that already began in you amen amen hallelujah and I always say the things you used to do you do them no more so God already start a change in your life already amen the places you used to go I go them no more the songs I used to sing I sing them no more you stop the swearing you stop the drinking you stop the carousing the partying and all them kind of thing right Hallelujah because God already started a change in your life and you as you walk along the Christian pathway and journey a change has already begun in you and people will observe and notice it you're different and they will tell you you're different so when Sarah Sarah went down into Egypt she started to look like a young lady she was already looking like a young lady amen so this change was already inside her and was reflecting on the outside so when she went down there amen you know the story Pharaoh the king down there saw her and wanted you know he saw her and he asked who's this feir Maiden who's this beautiful young lady that I I want her so Abraham say said listen now man to save my neck you better tell them you're my sister you know it's a half you tell them you know that was his half sister he didn't tell a full lie tell a half lie half truth but lie is lie anyhow what happened to Eve one [Applause] word one word one word destroyed the whole the whole plan starting there amen put everybody on that sinen Hallelujah and then God had to take them out of that situation amen hallelujah because you see God had a plan for Sarah and Sarah alone he said I will and he will do everything to bring that to pass so that King could not marry her as wife amen because God had it a perfect plan to down through Sarah Through the Ages amen for the Christ child amen and for you and I as Abraham fth seed amen you know your part of Abraham amen because then you receive Abraham's Faith or Revelation amen hallelujah because only Abraham Faith seat could receive that kind of Fai hallelujah amen hallelujah praise God praise God I'm going to just wind this up in about five minutes but uh so you can start getting yourself prepared for the baptism hallelujah we're going to have to continue this some other time amen and just want to wrap it up a little bit here hallelujah so we saw that Pharaoh tried to take Sarah as his wife amen if you read the scriptures in Genesis 12 men D and then God's blessing was with great substance amen for Abraham and they God had to separate them Hallelujah then after many battles and tests God brought them through amen so you see God promised that she would be a mother of Nations and she would conceive and bear a son But as time passed their Fai were tested just as so you and I God made promises to you and Satan always comes and and whisper in ear did he really mean that all the time he comes and question you are you really saved you say you're born again look what you just thought of just now look what you just did or something along the line amen hallelujah and then you get tested from outside and you get tested from inside and the worst kind of testing this is to get is from inside or not the ones that closest to you test you and try you Amen to the core to see if you're really mean or you really you really believe or you really believe man hallelujah hallelujah you know what I say the enemies of your own household amen hallelujah and we have a saying in Trinidad that is the worst thing to get bit by your own dog but that's how life is you know and God does bring test to you to see your reaction because you're not fight against fighting against flesh and blood principalities Amen in high places it's not just ordinary place from high place them think those things come from Hallelujah so don't give up when you're testing and the Trials come keep pressing on hallelujah praise God but it come it came a time where Sarah was having trouble believing the promise of God we ever reached a situation like that in that in in our walk that we start to kind of you know little bit you know doubt a little bit now is this true that we promised and the enemy love to whisper that into our ears and we try in our own efforts now to bring it to pass amen hallelujah we try to take God's plan and we try to work it out for ourselves but you cannot do that amen you could only please God by Revelation what God shows you to do he's the one you say you put your life in his hand amen and you said he's the one who's going to lead me and he's the one who's going to guide me then you take your hand off and you're taking the situation now in your own hand now to work it out for your own self and it doesn't work right it going to bring a whole lot of chaos and in Abraham's life up to this day this very moment that chaos that started there woking up to this very moment Hallelujah so we see Abraham amen Sarah Abraham wife amen she said no I have no child God give me this promise it's been so long and I can't I don't know how many years passed amen and you when time passed you know you started kind of s down a little bit we start hot hot and sweaty running running You Know But as time pass we start to cool off a little bit start to cool off a little bit amen and that's what was happening the it means so long 10 years pass 15 years past God say I'm going to have a child but see all along if Sarah was observing herself in the mirror in God's mirror in God God's word you and I just want to type it she would have seen a change already started and she it was reflecting in her already that God was up to something big for her hallelujah praise God and when you watch yourself in God's mirror you know God is doing something good for you so don't give up don't doubt keep holding on to the promise that he gave you Hallelujah so we see here Abraham wives bear him no children children and she had at handmade an Egyptian whose name was hagga slight six amen amen and Sarah said unto Abraham behold now the Lord had restrained me from bearing now she blaming the Lord now Lord promised her that she going to have a child now she's saying the Lord not you know hindering her from having a child amen amen hallelujah I pray thee go into go in unto my mid it may be that I may obtain children by her but the promise was not for nobody else but was for Sarah and this Rapture is not for everybody amen hallelujah it is only for those that could receive the revealed word of the hour for this day rapturing faith that you're going to have a body change amen hallelujah and that will bring in you into perfect Faith Hallelujah that I may obtain children by her and Abraham hearkened to the voice of Sarah amen so yes Abraham was swayed a little bit amen listening to an uncertain sound amen hallelujah he listening to a a my I'm going to say it to anyhow to some woman preaching receiving seed men contaminated seed seed that would not bring forth eternal life Hallelujah some strange Doctrine some strange teaching hallelujah praise God thank you Lord and Sarah Abraham's wife took hagga her made the Egyptian after Abraham had dwelt 10 years in the land of Canaan and gave her to her husband Abraham to be his wife and that's where this trouble with all in the East started from since then unto this day amen hallelujah to this day and it's going to continue right until that battle of the third world everything going to be like all forces confronted and all hell break loose amen hallelujah so from there and then because it Bible said that ishman was a wild man and he was not the promised seed plain and simple he was not amen hallelujah but you know God promised that he going to bless his seed and Ishmael was part of Abraham's seed but not the promised seed so he had to bless him because watch how much oil and everything that they have amen hallelujah praise God thank you Lord praise God we're going to continue by God's grace where we left off from here from where all the trouble started in the world up in the Middle East here amen hallelujah so God bless you tonight amen hope these few words type yourself put yourself into Sarah's shoes amen and ask yourself what would you have done amen if you received such a promise and you know we have received that promise amen that when you take Gods at his word amen amen hallelujah and he made promise is to you it shall surely bring it to pass though the vision terries it shall it must come to pass amen so we living in a society you know H H super everything quick quick quick quick we amen we want everything done right right away but you know it took 25 years to shaper Abraham and I don't know how how long it would take it take the Lord to shape us but going take some shaping amen hallelujah so God bless your hearts tonight as I turn over to brother Phillip tonight we have our precious brother J Josiah Josiah who desires baptism the Lord has spoke to him amen and he desire to be baptized in water amen but Phillip I think he's going to I don't want to take away brother Philip but you know baptism is just a outward confession of what God has already started interally Amen to say now I going to identify myself with God's people and with God's children baptism don't change you it's just a symbol that something already the change is already started amen just as God promised Sarah amen that she's going to Bear forth her son amen my precious brother he's going to bring forth amen The Life of Christ in his himself amen so God bless you all tonight brother phip take it away my brother yeah as the brother said that baptism does not sa but we do it as obedience the word of God and something already taking place in the inside so we have a couple of scriptures I'm going to read and then we go from there my first scripture will be be taken from Matthew [Music] 2819 Matthew 28:19 said go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost he never say names you will know that Father Son and Holy Ghost are just titles of God and then when you go to Luke 24 verse 47-49 it says that and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem that's expressing the importance of the name that remission of sins forgiveness everything should be preached in his name Samuel said that everything you do in works or In Deed do it in my name and when you go to verse 4 say behold I sent the promise of my father upon you be ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be Ed with the power from on high in other words when this promise was given Peter was there in Matthew 28:19 but he told them to wait until the promise comes and Acts 2 verse 3739 when the promise came when the Holy Ghost that they were waiting on came they asked them now acts 2: 37-39 acts chap 2 vers 37-39 they asked him now when they heard this they were pred in their heart and said unto Peter and the of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized everyone of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall called is God still calling yes amen okay so the last one in Romans said that therefore Romans chapter 6: 4-6 Romans 64-6 it says that therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from dead by the glory of the father even so we should also walk in the newness of life for if you are been planted together in the likeness of death we shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection amen that means that if you really repented you believe then you leing all your sins in this water tonight you bury them can inside [Music] [Music] can [Music] yeah bra justan did you came here in your own free will okay you renounce Satan and all his activities all generation Spirits every that has been following you okay so let's pray oh our Heavenly most gracious Eternal God our precious brother has come here with his own free will and is repented of his sins and is coming to be baptized in your name father you gave us the promise that you are still calling it's not any man calling but father you call him you did this in his heart and is showing now for what you have already done Satan come against you in the name of Jesus as he's going to the border every generation Spirit anything un like Christ be cast it out and leave him he's no more your property he's a property of the Living God and we all bear witness to it this evening that the grace of God will be shadowed upon him and as he is genuine repenting father you cannot lie you cannot change you you gave that promise that when the people gen repent and they baptize your name you fill them with your Holy Ghost so father I pray in the name of Jesus that your perfect will be done and you keep your word because you never failed and we have that confidence in the god that we are serving that your name is the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ you keep all your
