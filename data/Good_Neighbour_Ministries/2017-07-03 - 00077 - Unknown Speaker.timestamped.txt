[11:44] [Music]
[11:54] I oh
[11:57] God y it
[12:00] and
[12:01] still praise the Lord we're happy to be
[12:04] in the house of the Lord this afternoon
[12:06] are you happy to be here praise the Lord
[12:09] please be
[12:11] seated sister rth did you get your FL
[12:14] back here praise the lord well we'll
[12:18] trust the Lord that you get back a FL or
[12:21] our Breen will get together and get to
[12:23] the flute praise the Lord by his grace
[12:27] amen she lost her
[12:30] um flute that she plays here on the
[12:35] bus somehow so prayer request pray that
[12:40] she recover that flute but the devil
[12:44] isn't going to stop God's children or
[12:46] God's word
[12:48] yes and um if the Lord sees it f to
[12:51] restore it you will in that way if that
[12:55] doesn't come back to us and the devil
[12:57] holds on to it then we'll find a way for
[13:00] her to get a flute to be able to play in
[13:03] the presence of the Living God
[13:05] hallelujah praise the Lord on top of
[13:08] that brother bisco um his uh operation
[13:12] uh started at 5:00 this afternoon a stck
[13:16] up there time about there I believe 3 or
[13:21] is it 6 3 3
[13:23] hours right so therefore it's 6 6 6:00
[13:29] his uh operation started and some of you
[13:33] know about it 90%
[13:35] blockage that's that's bad you know 90%
[13:39] blockage and the other
[13:41] complication so um we we pray and trust
[13:45] that the Lord will bring our our brother
[13:49] out but like Daniel said to King
[13:53] Nebuchadnezzar uh if you choose to keep
[13:55] in the fire I'll go in the
[13:58] fire and uh if uh he doesn't want to
[14:02] take me out of the fire amen then I
[14:05] won't worry about it either so this way
[14:08] if the Lord uh wants to take this
[14:11] witness home there's nothing we can do
[14:14] about it because when he calls we have
[14:16] to answer regardless of what age we at I
[14:20] you brother bll is way up in age believe
[14:24] is 80 something you know yeah 80
[14:26] something years old and 83
[14:29] and was still so was so still bigor us
[14:32] going hunting and preaching all around
[14:35] the world so um uh God has been good to
[14:39] himen God has been good to him
[14:42] naturally where he's a wealthy man in
[14:44] his own nothing to do with the church
[14:46] before he even dealt with the church
[14:48] wealthy in business right um he's done
[14:52] very well in that area then when God
[14:54] blessed him with the church starting
[14:58] with a uh 50 people and then 100 people
[15:01] first he was here in in Toronto you know
[15:04] he told me himself in his daughter's
[15:06] living room he was here for a brief time
[15:09] but he just didn't feel the Zeal for it
[15:12] and nothing was happening so he just
[15:14] quickly left and went West right when he
[15:18] went West there and then he you know
[15:20] went with some Pentecostals and stuff
[15:23] for a while and then he started on his
[15:25] own because they threw him
[15:27] out
[15:29] he started on his own and he had some
[15:31] just another handful of people and the
[15:34] next thing you know they grew to about a
[15:36] hundred and you know the story you built
[15:37] the lock cabin there they work together
[15:39] and built that lock cabin and after a
[15:42] while Lord bless them give him a vision
[15:46] amen of this wonderful work that was
[15:49] going to happen and then the Lord
[15:51] blessed them somebody sold them a 100
[15:53] acres of land in that area there for a
[15:57] minuscule Mount at the time right and uh
[16:02] then they kept they start keeping church
[16:04] and Lord tell them no build a new
[16:06] Tabernacle so then what happened is that
[16:09] how's he going to build a tabernacle
[16:10] they don't have the money and Lord says
[16:12] well sell some of the
[16:16] land and then with what was shown to him
[16:20] he had a builder come in a developer
[16:23] come in and draw up the whole land like
[16:27] a small town with lots and houses and
[16:31] stuff like that on it um and the rest is
[16:35] history you kept 5 acres for the church
[16:39] and built a massive Tabernacle on it
[16:42] which you know at the height of his
[16:44] ministry there was like 2,000 people in
[16:46] there every night right and now it's
[16:49] about 900 but that's still a lot of
[16:53] people right and uh since then God has
[16:56] his own ways the church broke into this
[16:59] group in Washington this group over here
[17:01] this group over there this group over
[17:03] there because sometimes H sometimes it
[17:06] looks like the devil but sometimes it's
[17:07] the will of God so that the word can
[17:10] spread up right it's like scattering
[17:13] fire um no Pastor likes it but God is
[17:16] the over Shepherd amen and he does
[17:18] whatever he wills and so um so uh we see
[17:23] that and then he you know he sent to me
[17:25] in his DA's living room because you know
[17:27] his son-in-law used to come to this
[17:29] church here um praise the Lord what was
[17:33] his name again uh maybe you can't
[17:35] remember you don't remember him but
[17:38] anyway um he used to be in the church
[17:40] here his mother is from City here his
[17:43] lost mother and so um he said there to
[17:46] me he said you know the only thing I
[17:48] didn't do
[17:50] is uh he didn't Envision that all this
[17:54] would happen that his ministry would
[17:56] really get that big so he only kept five
[18:00] acres you should have kept 10 or 20
[18:04] acres out of the 100 acres CU now
[18:07] there's a town around it called evil
[18:09] Crest and all because the even the real
[18:12] estate agents was telling me he crazy
[18:15] who's going to come way out here to
[18:17] live but no sooner that they Mark those
[18:22] lots right with with hardly if no
[18:25] advertising people started coming and
[18:28] buying lots of
[18:30] and before you know it they were
[18:32] building building building and the rest
[18:34] is history praise the Lord hallelujah
[18:36] and then you know his life story from
[18:39] his youth with brother Bradham or
[18:42] brother Bradham saw him and the shirt
[18:44] that he was going to be wearing and all
[18:46] that you know uh and so he is one of the
[18:49] living
[18:51] Witnesses one of the living witnesses
[18:53] that are still here and one by one they
[18:57] have been gaining the portal
[18:59] brother is gone brother per green is
[19:03] gone you know Junior D is gone praise
[19:07] God brother Bale gone and and you go
[19:09] down the whole list of them right gone
[19:13] they're all gone and uh to a great
[19:16] degree a lot of that sometimes is even
[19:19] the purpose of God because he wants to
[19:21] take the people's eyes off of the
[19:25] witnesses and off of those men and
[19:29] so that the people's eyes will go on him
[19:31] alone
[19:33] amen those men don't have to try to
[19:35] build themselves up to be something
[19:36] that's not what I'm saying I'm just
[19:38] saying it's natural for human beings
[19:41] when they have a leader like that was
[19:43] close to the prophet they tend to
[19:45] gravitate to that person and then some
[19:49] go overboard with that person and but
[19:53] God wants our attention on him amen and
[19:56] him alone right God you made it plain
[20:00] how in the last days people have going
[20:02] to start Wasing celebrities whether it
[20:05] be preachers or or movie stars or
[20:08] whatever people are going to start
[20:09] worshiping celebrities and the only
[20:11] celebrity we are to worship is the Lord
[20:13] Jesus Christ amen we have to worship him
[20:17] give him praise amen so we pray that God
[20:21] will bring our brother through safely
[20:24] wonderfully and restore him back to his
[20:28] family
[20:29] that is our sincere prayer amen but we
[20:33] have to leave it at that for the
[20:35] Sovereign will of God because God's
[20:38] Sovereign will overrides anything we say
[20:41] or
[20:43] do then also what a week brother
[20:48] Christopher's daughter his eldest
[20:50] daughter
[20:52] Trisha uh having three sons no daughters
[20:56] Just Three Sons Bri boy nice voice um
[21:01] she had an accident sometime ago and
[21:04] that's affected her back and neck and
[21:06] all like that until it was so bad that
[21:09] her hands and her feet started to get
[21:13] paralyzed a paraly paralysis began to
[21:16] creep in right on her and before it took
[21:20] over
[21:21] completely it took her to uh she decided
[21:24] to go to the doctor and the doctor said
[21:27] it's a nurse
[21:29] right somewhere in your neck and there's
[21:32] something else going on in your brain
[21:35] and we have to
[21:36] operate why but he says now when we
[21:42] operate one little
[21:45] mistake I have to tell you you said
[21:48] plain one little mistake and you'll
[21:53] either be gone or you paralyzed for
[21:57] life
[21:59] and um I prayed with her of course but
[22:03] the thing about it it's like touch and
[22:06] go so I prayed with her that God will be
[22:09] the
[22:10] surgeon and that he will work through
[22:13] that
[22:14] surgeon and let all things be well so
[22:18] brother Chris was excited when he called
[22:21] me back later in the evening and said
[22:24] the operation went well 100% the surgeon
[22:28] said he never seen anything like it he
[22:29] said it was absolutely if I can say it
[22:32] for myself because he did it absolutely
[22:37] [Applause]
[22:40] perfect and early this morning gave me
[22:43] another call to said oh Pastor she was
[22:46] in pain all night she you know she pain
[22:50] all night yeah he says but you know the
[22:53] thing about it is now the feeling in her
[22:56] hands and her feet are C
[22:58] back and she started to be able to move
[23:00] him again
[23:05] prise God
[23:08] serve oh praise God Heaven and Earth
[23:11] adore him praise God what a mighty God
[23:14] we serve so I said well you know what it
[23:16] is uh after an operation or any injury
[23:19] the the the night or the morning after
[23:21] is usually the worst right uh the pain
[23:24] is the worst and then after that it
[23:27] slowly begins to
[23:29] receive and the fact that you are
[23:32] feeling pain which is what what most
[23:34] doctors try to tell people tells you
[23:37] that you are getting well because if you
[23:39] weren't feeling that pain the pain is
[23:41] telling you that your body is working
[23:43] and it's trying to uh it's trying to
[23:46] cast off anything that's uh uh negative
[23:49] right so uh we want to give God praise
[23:52] for that and honor him because he's the
[23:54] Mighty God he's still a Healer he's
[23:57] still the great God of amen praise the
[24:00] [Applause]
[24:05] Lord now we would have loved if it could
[24:09] have just disappeared like brother
[24:10] Brandon's wife when the surgeon touched
[24:13] her the minute he tried to touch her
[24:15] with that knife Bo everything just left
[24:19] gone amen uh that's us we human beings
[24:22] are built like that that kind of stuff
[24:24] captures us you know but God works in
[24:27] many many ways
[24:28] amen he works through
[24:31] hers you know God A Healer that's right
[24:34] and he'll heal you through
[24:36] hers natural
[24:38] substances but he'll also heal you by
[24:41] using a doctor or a nurse
[24:45] amen praise God or he can heal you by
[24:50] his healing power gradually that's right
[24:53] or you can make you well by an instant
[24:56] Miracle that's right
[24:59] but when we come and we ask God for
[25:01] deliverance we don't uh tell him which
[25:05] way he should make or do it that's up to
[25:09] him how he does it whether by Mir sudden
[25:13] Miracle whether by gradal healing
[25:15] whether by doctor whether by herbs
[25:17] whether by food whatever that's in his
[25:20] hands praise the Lord but most people
[25:23] tend to have their own expectation
[25:26] already in their mind so when the
[25:29] preacher pray if their hand go
[25:31] straighten out right away they say oh my
[25:34] God I'm not healed right as if it's
[25:37] magic Abracadabra he prayed and it
[25:39] didn't
[25:41] work praise the Lord that's how people
[25:44] thinks that that's how human beings
[25:45] think oh he prayed but nothing work well
[25:48] what about the guy that was blind Grand
[25:50] prayed for was about a year later while
[25:54] he's in the barber's chair and said come
[25:56] on John you know you're blind said no no
[25:58] I'm not blind I'm Healed he says but you
[26:02] we I know you for for this long you come
[26:04] into this barber shop I'm looking at you
[26:06] right now and I know that you are blind
[26:09] he said no I'm not blind I'm Healed
[26:11] praise God and when he said it that time
[26:15] W his eyes just popped right open and he
[26:19] popped right out the chair with all his
[26:21] home on his beard and everything run
[26:23] down the street with
[26:26] wa I'm heal I'm Healed
[26:28] heal praise God hallelujah he's the
[26:32] mighty healer he the Le amen oh praise
[26:38] God when the saw him he started
[26:41] walking oh praise God he's still the
[26:43] Mighty God you believe
[26:45] that the devil trying to cover all this
[26:48] up and put it in the back like if it's
[26:49] only history is if it's something back
[26:52] there then he had he also has Jes and
[26:56] jees out there claiming that they're
[26:58] working miracles and and all have the
[27:01] people oh there's another one when
