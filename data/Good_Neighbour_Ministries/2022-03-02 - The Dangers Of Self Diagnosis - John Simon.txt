TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] glory and praise be to god here we are on another wednesday evening to raise our hearts in worship and praise to god we give him thanks for bringing us through this week protecting us leading us and guiding us may the lord certainly encourage our hearts as we look into the perfect law of liberty praise his wonderful and precious name amen now as we go in the presence of the lord we would love to read from revelation chapter 3 reading verse 17. because thou i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knows thou not that thou art wretched miserable naked and blind our dear gracious loving heavenly father with joy we draw night to thy august throne may the holy spirit father quicken us together bless the heart of all the saints that are watching and partaking around the world near and far may you minister as you reach out to call out you're elected of this last day for when the last one comes in the rapture goes up and we are trusting father in every service in every point of time space on our walk that you will bring us into contact with that lost seed lost and the last of the lost may you draw them into your kingdom and your name be glorified and a great meeting in the air when we are there together again giving praise to your name thank you father glory to your marvelous name in the name of our beloved lord and savior jesus christ amen tonight i'm talking about the danger of self-diagnosis well we've just come through uh two years of the covet plague and we have all been affected by it in some way or the other physically mentally emotionally or socially or family situations whatever we have been influenced in some way shape or form and during this period of time a lot of there has been a search for a cure something that will end the reign of this plague in the bodies and minds of men scientists have searched and searched and researched until they were able to find a vaccine medicine something that will be able to stay or to hold back the onslaught of this evil thing but during this time there have been a lot of people who have thought they did not need science they did not need a scientist they did not need a vaccine they did not need any medicine and so they decided that they would uh prescribe something for themselves they will find their own cure and any knowledgeable any doctor will tell you as any lawyer will only a fool will take himself to be his own lawyer and so is it that the doctors will prescribe the scientists will recommend but yet there are multitudes of people that decide they don't need the wisdom they don't need the hours of research they don't need the knowledge they can self-diagnose they can prescribe for themselves they can find the answer for themselves so they don't need any help i know of one person that decided to self-diagnose and it wasn't long after the man was dead there have been other cases where people have self-diagnosed and find found themselves with worst ailments and worse conditions on their lives so there is great danger in a person self-diagnosing self-prescribing and not waiting for those with the knowledge to do that but here tonight we are not speaking on natural self-diagnosis we're speaking on the self-diagnosis of the church the church's spiritual estimate of herself so full of pride so uh caught up with her own narcissism her own uh her own estimate of her beauty and attraction the church looks into the mirror and comes back with her own diagnosis not what she would be told but what she thinks about herself and so here in revelation chapter 3 verse 17 the church gives her own diagnosis and god responds by saying yes you have a diagnosis of yourself but we can't trust that let me do a diagnosis which we will talk about later but here our scripture picks it up because thou says you see they were speaking they were giving their diagnosis of their spiritual condition they were saying to themselves we have now become the mouthpiece of god amen romans 12 6 tells you that we are not to be wise as the scripture says in your own eyes be not wise in thy own eyes so man many times will think that way but we are not to be wise in our own wise and paul the great apostle says they that compare themselves among themselves are not wise certainly as we look into the word of god we find out friends that the church says that she speaks for god but god says no you're not that is your estimate of your self see the leodysian church age the edition church says i am rich i am increased with goods i have need of nothing hallelujah i am rich i am wealthy i'm prosperous i'm powerful oh praise god he is boasting in the face of god and his word when in the epistle of james chapter 2 verses 5 to 7 the bible says heart my beloved brethren had not god chosen the poor of this world uh have you not has he not promised in faith that they are heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to them but you have despised the poor do not rich man oppress you and draw you before the judgment seats oh my see they're blaspheming this worthy holy name by which they're called amen now by no means am i or anyone else suggesting that rich men on women cannot be spiritual that is not what i'm saying but most of the time the heady wine of uh uh of wealth and prosperity seems to throw most people off kilter and they draw away from god draw away from his spirit move out of his presence and begin to despise the poor the uneducated they have no patience with those who they can't see eye to eye with the virtues seem to pour out of them and be gone and they seem to want to achieve their own ends now by themselves and uh without any contact whatsoever with those kinds so-called of so-called people they're very very few rich men and women today they're actually spiritual and humble enough to listen to god's word through the bible through his servant's true nature through his voice amen yes sir and when we look at the true church god already prophesied that the true church will actually be dominated mainly by the poor it'll be taken up with a lot of those that are poor now if the church then becomes so full of wealth we can only see what the scripture said ichabod is written across her portals the glory of god has departed as much as the wealth pours in the glory departs from it talk about wealth in this modern church today there has never been so much wealth as we see around beautiful sanctuaries being built and they're built at such a furious rate multiplied churches everywhere costing millions of dollars this created the situations where denominations are vying uh competing with each other to see who will build the most unique the the most attractive eye-catching uh buildings and structures out there yes lovely yes oh my something else and they build beautiful education centers estimated at millions and millions of dollars and they only use the building for a few hours a week maybe more than that but uh they just use it for a short period of time and we see that they expect to educate the children and give them religious teaching uh and take away the uh teaching of that the parents should be able to provide they become the religious kindergarten and the ones to rear and mold the minds and hearts of the children the day and so money has poured into the church instead of god's might and power money has taken over their minds instead of the revelation of the mystery of god and is poured into these different denominations who now own stocks and bonds and factories and some even own oil wells they're not depending on god anymore depend on our own wisdom our own ability to be able to maneuver and do a business and things of that nature nothing is wrong with business but they are doing that and they are using the power of that to forget the power of god in the presence of the holy spirit yes sir owning factories owning oil wells owning insurance companies amen and pouring money into welfare and charities of that nature pouring money into retirement funds everywhere that sounds good but it becomes a trap and a snare to many ministers and believers because if there's a minister and after a while he begins to see holes he begins to see openings in the fundamentals the foundations of what he was taught and he begins to see the truth in god's word and wants to break away you see he becomes trapped by that pension fund that they had established in his name in that particular denomination because if he leaves the denomination he'd lose a suspension fund they'll support him no more he'll lose what they were that they should be giving to him oh my friends that poor fellow is then trapped into that situation where he will be put out as a beggar in the streets and then he decides i'd better stay with my denomination for all the years i've put in uh so be able to reap or to receive my attention and so he yields to the pressure of that pressure group that had this trap or snare set up for him friends we're living in the last age and we know it's the last age for israel is back in her homeland they're getting themselves ready for the third temple coming of the red heifer watching for the appearing of elijah again to them and then the messiah oh their hearts yearn their hearts are filled with expectation and joy for the gentile dispensation is coming to an end and as the gentiles go out the jews come into power naturally and spiritually coming into power amen and we believe and teach that jesus is really coming for us for a rapture to take his waiting bride away hallelujah and then he'll go out and talk to his brethren my praise god hallelujah oh something is wrong when they claim jesus is coming soon but they're building and building bigger bigger richer better everything else and yet claiming there's going to be a rapture we're leaving soon but they're putting down massive structures everywhere contrary to their confession oh my religion today has come into a condition of making itself transforming itself into big business using religion a great uh industries have raised up from religion oh praise god something is wrong somewhere they act and do and live as if the coming of the lord is hundreds of years off so they have enough time to to do all this building and buying and selling and and uh making of records and books and histories and uh building up great profiles and whatever because back of their mind with their lips they're saying jesus is coming soon but with their hands their works they are proving that they maybe he's coming hundreds of years from now but friends they're those of us who believe jesus is coming soon it may be morning night at noon but the coming of the lord is right here with us and we want to give him praise glory and to acknowledge the divine presence among us now it's our departure with him to live forevermore is divine presence but when we look what do we see religion has become big business with business managers and financial managers do you think this is what god wants and god desires of the church of the living god my friends consider in the word of god what about the book of acts did you did this teach us that the apostles force trained those those seven deacons train them as business managers first before they can handle the finances of the apostolic church in those primitive times was it so my friends but the bible tells us they sought for men full of the holy ghost not full of finance but full of the holy ghost men full of the holy ghost and of faith to serve the lord hallelujah amen surely my friends god is saying to them you say i am wealthy you say this is your diagnosis that i am rich and i'm so rich that i have need of nothing i don't need nothing they don't need god's help anymore they don't need god's presence with them anymore they just want to be religious they want to be thought of as good people that that helps the poor don't i do this don't i do that don't i do the other oh but my friends genuine faith genuine desire to walk with god and to serve him in the fullness and the power of his resurrection the air is filled and polluted filled everywhere with religious radio programs filled with television programs all manner of church endeavors all manner of programs and various plans costing millions and millions of dollars selling this and selling that and this is on sale well it costs money to produce so we have to sell it for so much and and sales religious sales are going on everywhere and wealth is pouring into the modern church and the membership is increasing along with the masses of money that is coming in and yet the work of evangelism and the work my friends of reaching the loss at any cost is not being done oh look into god's word and see what we we can see here amen oh my friends the apostles did more work that they can ever dream or think of without any money without any human might without any kind of of influence of man that did it under the power of the holy spirit for this not by financial might mental power mental might but by my spirit saith the lord god hallelujah amen now we are ending up with multitudes of paid preachers paid assistance paid ministers of music paid ministers of education paid youth leaders paid choirs paid custodians paid programs and paid people to produce uh dramatic sets and people to be masters of of entertainment and programming and that like all costing millions and millions of dollars and they justify it in the name of the lord amen yes my friends even their power is decreasing while they increase on that side their power is decreasing with god and yes indeed the church is rich and richer than she ever was but the power of god is not there for the glory is departed the dove of peace has taken her flight no more oh is the holy spirit dealing with the modern church he has come to be dealing now with the individuals that may be in the midst of those churches god moving by his spirit but not by the amount of money that you have absolutely god is not moving by the trained talents that may be in the church but is moving by the gifts of the spirit that he has implanted within the hearts of his believers the world and the church is consumed with a diabolical urge and hunger for money seems like the god mammon has taken over the minds of men and the churches have gone all out to get as much money as they can and as much membership as they can but now they have refined their targeting they have developed systems plans programs and pits to be able to target the wealthy the rich and those that have spheres of influence and everywhere they're doing every possible thing as women of today are doing to make themselves even more attractive and to make themselves so appealing that the rich will feel proud to walk into a proper church that is well decorated beautiful in its exterior the shape of the church the dress the look of the church the paints they the carpets the beautiful tiles they're all something that will infuse and influence the senses of man that is their visual atmosphere that they want when god deliberately let the lord jesus be born in a manger full of straw and the smell of human of animal uh excrement the god who allowed all the holy spirit to come down in the upper room uh in a humble atmosphere man unlearned and untrained god knowing that will deliberately throw off some of those whose minds are set in one direction and only the humble only those who are willing to walk god's way can become overcomers to overcome that and still walk in the light my friends oh instead we find they go after the rich they want their church to have the most cultured the best dressed the best uh those with the best manners and talents in the church oh those who have worldly prestige and standing in the society this is what is the desire of the modern church today that's what we can see amen oh can't they understand friend that if wealth is they is the measuring stick of who is a real believer and a member then my friends i tell you then the world already has god because they're more rich sinners out there rich more rich unbelievers uh that you can number on your you can you can't without number so those that are in the church are much fewer than those that are outside and if wealth was the measure then the world already has god but that is not the case because the word told us already clearly my friends that thou says i'm rich thou says i am increased with goods amen but listen friends you may have natural goods but you don't have the spiritual goods you may have natural wealth but you don't have the spiritual will oh you laugh at that you market that oh you can go talking about spiritual wealth but you don't have money you don't have position you don't have power you don't have these natural things listen to the real believers those things are good and god bless you if god has given them to you but the most important thing if we lose all else we don't want to lose our salvation we don't want to lose our revelation and understanding of god's word we don't want to lose our spiritual sight we don't want to lose the spiritual riches of god to pour out of us we're not here to try uh catching or trying to get a drink of water by using a basket we are here my friends to drink from the springs of salvation the refreshing waters of the word of the living god amen hallelujah look at this let us consider this last day leo decian boast a lukewarm church a church which god said i spit you out of my mouth and yet they're boasting but we are rich thinking that that will make god want to accept her and to have a union with her no god doesn't want that kind of a church with that kind of a character he wants a church with a cat of christ that will stand firmly with him a real help meet of the word that will stand by the word of god and walk with him step by step amen yes friends hallelujah they want influential men in their society in their church and they put them in the positions of influence and power in the church not knowing you have read in your newspapers you have seen it on the internet some of the wealthiest richest men in the world caught and caught up with wife swapping the human trafficking drug dealings all manner of sexual immorality on their private yachts their private jets their private islands their great big resorts oh the world looks up to them but my friends rotten to the core liars cheats killers murderers and everything else all bands of children that they bring into their midst to defile to corrupt to spy and sell young men young women caught into their nets of evil everywhere prostitution oh taken to a place where they try to make it acceptable to the world and these modern day prostitutes to natural things they try to make them admire when they my friends live such a corrupt life contrary to god's word amen lying stealing gambling filled with drug addiction needles sticking using all manner of chemical agents within their lives and within their body amen and then the church goes on claiming oh what a fine generation this is what a blessed generation this is look how prosperous they are oh if we can have believers become prosperous like that if they can present that kind of oh my friends what a lie of satan and many times they'll they'll pick up a bible holding it in their hands to try to influence others to think that they are such christians and believers when they're rotten to the core and the church the conservative church blinded by the things of the world instead of being able to discern the revelation of the word of god they're blinded by these things with their sea with their natural eyes the entire church has become defiled claiming all these fine wonderful things and yet the churches are not responsive to the hunger and the cry of the lost that is out there and they have turned the church over instead of turning the church to the hands of the great physician to prayer to fasting to the power of god they have turned the church over to the doctors they have turned the people instead of casting evil away from the people they have turned the people over to the psychiatrists of such a manner yes sir talk about being and yet they speak of being spiritually rich amen but we know from their actions and attitude they may be naturally rich but they are spiritually bankrupt of the word of god and the revelation of the holy spirit hallelujah just look at the people who pass by just look go to the corner as one prophet said he said i stood by the by way and i watched as the people pass by oh is it nothing to you he said who passed by of what jesus christ has done for you is it nothing to you but today it seems as if it's nothing to the people they can dismiss him they can dismiss his serpents they can dismiss the word they can dismiss everything because they look on it as foolishness ignorance and uh you know it's rough it's crude it's not cultured it's not smart it's not wise it's not polished it's this is not the kind of thing it it ought to be beautiful not to be nice it's not to be uh this way it ought to be structured it ought to be systematic such ways like that you know and they miss the entire plan of god amen just look at the people all claiming to be christians but they're not even their natural appearance proves that they're not christians and they are not real christians amen look at how they act look at the places they go to look at the friends they have look at their tastes look at their desires look at what ah they're pulled by instead of pulling in the presence of god they're pulling the presence of other things they're not contrary to the word of the living god amen and you cannot see the real evidence of the holy spirit in their lives are upon their hearts you cannot see it at all amen so fundamental churches to death claiming that they are filled with millions of people that are truly saved and even so-called filled yet when you go what do you see you see these so-called spirit-filled women going around with their hair chopped off when the bible says the long hair on a woman is her glory amen they wear shorts slacks going to church amen wearing shorts and slacks halter tops and briefs and bikinis and all painted face jezebel to the word of god as god calls it amen and refuse to be adorned in modest apparel they believe it's fantastic to flaunt their sexuality to be able to be attractive to the world i know they don't set the styles those styles are set in places like hollywood and france and the catwalks of uh modeling and stuff like that it's set by that but they have to accept those styles and live and dress themselves by those so-called styles that they have but the scripture tells us that if a man lusts after a woman just look upon her with lust desire and that kind of a motive he has already committed adultery within his heart and if the woman deliberately dresses with all manner of such appeal and sexuality she becomes a partner in crime a partner in sin amen even though she be unaware yet god will hold both are comfortable in his divine in his sight this kind of preaching seems to people today to be old-fashioned they don't want to hear this kind of a preaching they didn't listen to noah they did not listen to all the prophets of patriarchs the apostles in the bible they called paul a woman hater called brother branham a woman hater they don't realize it's not them that said it it's written in the word of god thou shalt not put on a garment that pertains to a man for it's in the word of the living god hallelujah amen but you are dead wrong when you don't accept god's truth and you take the way of the world bible forbids you to cut your hair off the bible forbids you from wearing man's apparel amen god gave a command and said you are to wear your hair long and you are to wear it amen for your glory and for his glory amen for your here is your covering not some hat on your head or cut off your hair and then put on a hat no he says you grow the hair long for the long year is your beauty and your covering hallelujah because when you cut off your hair you are giving the signal that that you're not coming under any authority of god or any man but you are under your own leadership and your own authority and you don't care about taking any man's job any man's position or anything else like that but i want to urge you tonight repent and turn to back to god come back to your original position and be who god wants you to be he made you female not male and he made the male male not female let us go back to the original and be who god wants us to be amen it's bad enough but not only is a society invaded by these kinds of spirits the pulpits have become invaded positions of power in the spiritual realm have become invaded yes my friends and so it's everywhere when god never ordained any woman to preach or teach or usurp authority over men yet the very church that claims it obeys god is ordaining women placing them in those positions contrary to the very word of god not listening to what god says to them and doing the total opposite to the word of god amen woman cannot possibly have a place in the five-fold ministry for god himself said i will not suffer a woman to teach nerd to usurp authority no sir hallelujah ephesians chapter four absolutely you're not to do it and sisters i encourage you listen to the word of god listen to the simple bible oh my yes i tell you somebody has made a mistake somebody got blinded and went off from the correct direction of god's word somebody allow themselves to be fooled absolutely you better wake up before it's too late wake up before let your eyes be opened my friends you see because satan has attempted and is attempting to fool the daughters the sister the bro the sisters the women of today just like he fooled eve back in the garden of eden he is bringing his evil trick his sinister lies bringing them on the scene again oh you say but uh brother simon i have need of nothing you may have needs your church may not be the biggest you may need this you may need that you may need the other but i have needed nothing i've got everything you can that's okay you can boast about that you can talk about it but i have him amen hallelujah listen i have need of nothing oh praise god in other words you're telling me i have everything i have everything and so uh you think you have everything and yet while you are saying that you lack the presence of god amen you're saying i got everything now i i don't need anything more i i don't need any more of that word of god because i i got everything already that i need that is your diagnosis that is your theory that is your estimate of yourself but god says noise down not you're miserable you're wretched you're naked you're blind but the the the part of it that is so bad is that you don't even know it because you feel so self-confident you believe that you know when you don't know and you're contrary to the word of god what a complacent last dead church that figures that she has it all amen figures that she has the revelation figures that she have the power she figures that she has the truth and the bible says and knows them not you don't have it whatsoever they wrote their manuals base their faith on their manuals their fundamental instead of upon the raw plain pure word of god as was given to the apostles i say to you back to the primitive church back to the apostolic church back to the apostolic way but of course in this modern satan's eden in which we live satan has made it such a way that that seems like an anomaly in the midst of it all hallelujah my preaching even now would seem like old-fashioned it doesn't fit in to the society and into the measure or standards of the day but friends we are not called to measure up ourselves to the world or to the standards of the world we are here to keep god's plumbline standard of his unchanging unswerving word and his truth which will never die but will bring to pass the things he has spoken amen amen now they're trying to prove it all that they are trying to prove to the world they have it and they have enough of it and they have more than enough of it but you compare this 20th century church with the church of the book of acts chapter 2 verse 4 and what do we see where is the power where is the love where is the fellowship where is the moving of the holy spirit i mean genuine moving not the engineered moving of man not by the systems of man with uh the manipulation of masses of people but by the original spontaneous combustion of the holy spirit coming down and moving amongst the people oh my where is that purified church that was refined and purified by god in which you could not have ananias and sapphira you couldn't have ungodly liars and cheats in the mets but god will know how to subtract them how to take them out of the midst whatsoever where is that church that was so holy and purified it stood up against sin amen it walked in purity and faith walking the world in white with him praise god holding hand to hand as an old song said the king and i walked through lice road together or praise god ah the king and i a lonely beggar called by god redeemed by his grace but we walk life's road together where is the unity they're talking about where is the faith where is the oneness they can't find it where and wherever it is wherever they claim it is they don't have it all together and yet my friends with all of that they claim what we have need of nothing but i tell you if you have a need you need what those apostles had you need what the book of acts had you need that anointing that was on that seventh angel you need the presence of the holy spirit as never before amen i want to thank god in this closing moment of the world's history and of this message here tonight i want to thank god that he has come back and we are experiencing another visitation of a different form in this day and in this hour and the holy spirit of god the white horse rider is riding through the land and i thank god for it and i believe i'm a part of it i trust god he'll open your heart he'll stir your desire and make you a part of this also that you will you will recognize your position in christ and who you are that you will walk with him in these last days in which we live may the lord bless you may the lord be with you every step of the way and especially during the last days of this week may god's holy spirit go with you and watch between us until we meet again god bless you [Music] you
