[5:56] direction you have to detect looking at
[5:59] design coax but go beware the post or
[6:03] disciples is pointing so listen to the
[6:06] voice of the son praise God
[6:10] should we just turn to a scripture and
[6:13] that is in the book of Job and this is
[6:17] just for a springboard bara
[6:20] a jumping-off point
[6:44] resident market chapter for your thought
[7:04] with this story that's pretty racist
[7:13] father we thank you for the open Bible
[7:15] we thank you for the word given to us
[7:19] the bread of life and just before we
[7:21] break the bread
[7:23] we asked justice who broke the bread to
[7:27] give thanks and then we got to cheer up
[7:31] to the people we ask your blessing here
[7:33] today about the simple word Jesus Christ
[7:45] Jesus
[7:47] [Music]
[7:53] [Music]
[8:01] [Music]
[8:16] [Music]
[8:30] now Jacob's Well was there Jesus
[8:34] therefore being wearied with this
[8:36] journey sad us on the web and it was
[8:40] about the sixth hour their comment a
[8:43] woman of Samaria to draw water jesus
[8:50] saith unto her to betray me or his
[8:53] disciples was ugly under the city
[8:57] divided me then seek the woman of
[8:59] Samaria under him I have a woman of
[9:07] Samaria or the truth Jesus
[9:12] [Music]
[9:30] don't let nothing stand that living
[9:38] water are greater than our Father chiku
[9:41] which gave us the well track the rocket
[9:44] for this children under stop Jesus
[9:49] whosoever drinketh of this water shall
[9:51] thirst again
[9:52] but whosoever drinketh of the water that
[9:55] I shall give him shall never thirst but
[9:58] the water that I shall give him shall be
[10:01] in him a well of water springing up into
[10:05] everlasting life the woman singer of the
[10:08] ham sir give me this water in that was
[10:37] here the hip sir I perceive that what a
[10:39] prophet our fathers worshiped in this
[10:41] mountain and he's saying that Jerusalem
[10:44] is the place where men ought to wash
[10:46] them jesus said of her woman believe me
[10:49] they are coming but you shall neither in
[10:52] this mountain
[10:55] worship the father you watch their
[10:57] people not walk but be know what be
[11:01] watching her salvation is of the Jews
[11:05] but they are coming and now is when the
[11:08] true worshipers shall worship the father
[11:10] new spirit and they that worship Him
[11:17] that wasn't him in spirit and in truth
[11:23] no carpet which is proud of the Christ
[11:27] when he is coming up tell us all things
[11:29] she said of the her I speak of the deep
[11:34] he even embraced up and the rest of the
[11:38] scripture the woman dropped her water
[11:40] pot ran back into our city and begin to
[11:44] say Garcia man is not mr. Christ and all
[11:48] of them we understand from other
[11:50] scriptures that are reliable for power
[11:52] in that city because of this woman's
[11:55] testimony of what happened to her life a
[11:58] novice there are other scriptures that I
[12:01] can leave to be seated
[12:07] I hope read about this comforter of
[12:10] Jesus Christ with the priests when
[12:15] McLoughlin Beelzebub in other words the
[12:20] colorful deadly and then in the other
[12:24] actor ever
[12:46] he said if Rahab can't be you Father
[12:50] because Abraham you be right ever have
[12:54] you mean and if he was here today he
[12:56] would recognize the fact that you do not
[12:59] recognize me tells me that or of your
[13:02] father that death and he's a liar a
[13:06] thief from the beginning and so you are
[13:09] expressing his nature even though it's
[13:11] thousands the years later you're
[13:14] expressing his nature and truly who you
[13:17] are exposing yourself and identifying
[13:20] where you come from and when you're good
[13:24] today I'd like to speak on the priest
[13:28] and the prostitute
[13:31] [Music]
[13:35] it was in this situation it seems to
[14:37] change our life's direction what would
[14:45] be your husband
[14:46] now remember this is like 6 o'clock that
[14:49] evening it's quite light time here is a
[14:52] single 30 30 31 year old to a young man
[14:58] sitting alone where in the evening only
[15:02] the women go to get water and a young
[15:06] Jew is sitting there as if he is waiting
[15:09] on something and she comes along and he
[15:16] well to go with now is somebody else's
[16:17] husband
[16:18] it's natural and so I have to stop you
[16:21] even say that left every left for the
[16:24] reasons why we got there the chapter of
[16:26] our life because you're gonna cross a
[16:28] time we're going to go too far right
[16:32] see you want to pass the cross

[20:28] outside in the priests entire group or
[20:49] on one of the slaves because only the
[20:52] priest could go behind the veil moving
[20:55] and he will ring the bell and instance
[21:00] in the presence of God sacrifices and
[21:03] then he will come

[30:15] of God in her never mind what you
[30:17] receive on the outside that run this way
[30:20] or that way it was something there amen
[30:24] the priests had nothing to work with
[30:35] [Music]
[30:46] [Music]
[30:51] [Music]
[31:12] to draw this picture of predestination
[31:17] and representation to condemnation and
[31:22] representation to eternal life amen
[31:26] please God we see here when sister
[31:30] I read Exercises of st. Ignatius
[31:33] Ignatius of Loyola and really that's the
[31:38] standard fundamental book for the Jesuit
[31:42] priest as such my former life of course
[31:47] I interest Catholic priest at the School
[31:50] of Arts or snap and later on he became a
[31:54] Pentecostal or Protestant but the fact
[31:56] is that these priests especially Jesuit
[32:01] which is one
[32:05] the church maybe not they'll have to
[33:48] start
[33:51] the you know first of all and they put
[33:55] you in a Bible College and then they
[33:57] begin the training

[46:53] upper atmosphere and something will you
[46:56] come into the presence and right away
[46:58] it's trained two or more men part make
[47:01] sure the breasts or whatever but the
