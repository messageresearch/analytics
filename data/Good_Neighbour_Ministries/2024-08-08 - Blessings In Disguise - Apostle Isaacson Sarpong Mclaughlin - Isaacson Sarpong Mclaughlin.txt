in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen Hallelujah we give God a praise for tonight for his mercies and his grace Upon Our Lives without wasting much time let us turn our Bibles this evening so that we can take the comfort of our seat to the book of Hebrews chapter 12 Hebrews 12 verse 5 to2 Hebrews chapter 12: 5 to 12 and ye have forgotten the exaltation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuke of him for whom the Lord he loveth Chast it and scored every son whom he receiveth if ye endure chaining god dealth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chastin not but if he be thou Chas mens whereof all are partakers than ye are Bast and not Sons furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us hallelujah and we have gave them re shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and leave for they verily for a few days Chastain us after their own pleasure but he for our Prophet that we might be partakers of his Holiness now no chasing for the present seem to be joyous but Grievous Hallelujah nevertheless after all it yielded the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercise thereby moreover wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble needs the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of his word shall we humbly be seated I greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ how many of of you are happy to be here the scripture said where two or three are gathered in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he is in our midst and tonight we are glad we are more than two Hallelujah if it is only the two of us is in our midst we are more than two and three and we believe the Lord will be with us I bring greetings from the Saints in the dooa forest and uh they send their greetings down here may the Lord bless you I hope you receive their greetings things I want to thank Pastor John Dana also for giving me the privilege to be able to see Pastor Danny God bless you for the fellowship and opening of hiop to serve the Lord's Children Here Also I want to title my message blessings in disgu blessings in disgu you see we are living a time when Christianity has been hybridized Christianity has been modernized amen we have a modern version of Christianity and we have the hybridized version of Christianity but Christianity is an oldtime religion Hallelujah the gospel is not as sweet as the world sells it amen and amen I want to read my first quote from the message the acts of the Holy Spirit acts of the Holy Spirit 5429 a brother Abraham says times may be hard God has not promised a flowery Beed of East but he has promised Grace for every trial that can hit you amen times may be hard so if today this world or this country is uh going through hard times we must not be surprised because the Bible says perous times shall come amen perous times shall come time may be hard but God has not and never promised us a flowery bird of ease amen but he promised great sufficient for every trial that will hit you is that not beautiful that every Tri that will hit you God has equivalence of sufficient Grace amen and amen he said that's right yes indeed grace is sufficient he said now he is not he's on a flower flower bed of East but he promised Grace to overcome in every Temptation when the cross gets heavy Christ promise prise to be with you you didn't hear that when the cross get heavy Christ promise to be with you the scriptures we read are four says every son that comes to God every daughter that comes to God must be scorched must be chastised not because he hates you but because he loves you yes in Revelation 3:21 said those that I love I rebuke and I chastise not those he hates but those that He Love yes sir Christianity has been sold as if when you come to Christ then everything goes well for you let's see from the true Easter seal that was preached in 61042 paragraph 79 the prophet of God said the Christian doesn't ask for easy things he said there is so much promises today made among Christian people so many ministers promise a people a false thing and what is that false thing that first thing is what have kept the denomination busy with people fill with members all the time because of that false thing they are hanging on and what is that false thing if you just come to Christ all your troubles is settled oh Lord have mercy the prophet that I tell you when you come to Christ then they begin see that is the difference between the modern Christianity and the old time religion because the old time religion we have been made known and aware that every son that comes to God must be tested and tried oh Hallelujah he said when you come to Christ then they begin that's when you put on a uniform and take a gun and enter into Battlefield Christianity is not a picnic Christianity is a war is a spiritual warfare Christianity is a battlefield it's a battle between right and wrong it's a battle between immorality immorality it's a battle between Christ and the devil it is a battle between Creed and dogmas it's a battle between Christ and the world Hallelujah he said the Christian road is not a flly flower bed of ease is a battle from the very hour you start until you are your spirit is set free by death you are not on a no picnic you are on a Battleground and so we are promised things so even in the service we are on the battlefield the holy spirit is ministering to you the devil is also whispering to you are you going to believe by faith or you are going to doubt the word the battle is ranging on oh glory be to God but as for me I will receive what the Lord have for me tonight I will open my heart and my mind in my hands to receive the fullness of the blessings of God in my life tonight blessed be the name of the Lord let us read from the book of Romans 8:28 another popular scripture here we are all very much acquainted with Romans chapter 8 ver 28 the Bible says here and we know that all things work all things work together for good to them that love God when the scripture says all things it means all things am Hallelujah the scripture didn't say some things but all things so all things means all things all things work together for your good to them that love God not them that God hate not them that hate God but them that love God all things work together for their good to them who are called according to his purpose Hallelujah for whom he did forn he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren Christianity is by predestination you are not a Christian by your will you are not your Christian by your desire we are saved by the desire of God God forew you before the foundation of the world and he did predestinated you in other words he pre plan your life because he is an infinite God that knows the end from the beginning and the beginning from the end where the limitation of man ends that is where the ability of God begins yes sir that makes him God so whom he did for new them he also did predestinated Hallelujah and moreover whom he did predestinated then he also called so if you are not forn of God you will not be predestinated and if you are not predestined to believe you will not be called and those he called he did what he also was justified and Those whom he justified them he also glorified hallelujah our lives are pray plan of God we are in the program of God there is nothing out of ker God is taking the real and Jesus know where we are going he knows where the boat will sail he knows the sof part of the race and he will keep us to the shore regardless of the storms of life that comes our way blessed be the name of the Lord let us jump and continue said what shall we say to these things if God be with for us who can be against us he that SP not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justify who is either that condemn it it is Christ that died oh Hallelujah woman where are your accusers oh glory be to God it is Christ that died yeah rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who maketh intercessions for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ oh blessed be the name of the Lord shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or S Hallelujah he says here as is written for thy sake we are killed all day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that love us hallelujah oh thank you Lord for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things presentence nor things to come oh blessed be the name of the Lord nor height oh nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord why am I reading this the world is selling Christ that when you come to church when you come to Christ and All Things become cool and soft and coozy so when you come to Christ with such expectation that you don't have what you expect because of what you have heard then you are disappointed so people's laugh of God cools down when they are naked we have no place to sleep when they are having famine when all those things the LA begin to cool because they come with such expectation but we are more than conquerors through him that love us hallelujah in all these things we are more than conquerors if you catch such a revelation you will be persu worded also that neither death or life nor angels or principalities nor height or death nothing present or nothing in the future can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus I want to read from the message in 19 time and sign paragraph 17 but Abraham says some people tries to introduce Christianity that you are free from worry you are free from worry nothing bothers you he said no you are not you are free from tension he said oh no you are tension when you become a Christian every brother came to the prophet oh brother Abraham pray for me I have a high temper so that God will take it away so no problem as you know that the prophet begin to pray God let people Cur him Lord drink troubles his way said no no no brother I mean pray that God will take away my temper he said you know what if God don't bring those things your way how will you know the prayers have been answered so God bring all those things and when you are able to stand without reacting then you know something has happened unto you that you know a work has been done on you blessed be the name of the Lord you are not free from tension oh no you attention when you become a Christian he said because he was kind of slow Go Happy Lucky whatever it was out there not caring what you did but when you become a real Christian every moment you are wondering am I pleasing my Lord the people of the world don't ask such a question they are question is am I pleasing the world but a Christian asks a question am I pleasing my Lord so it's not about yourself but about the Lord our Prophet taught us you don't leave for ourself is said first you leave for the Lord second you leave for your family before third you leave for yourself Hallelujah but people today are more careful and concerned what they well thinks about them more than what the Lord thinks about them but when you become a real Christian then you think of what the Lord thinks about you he said every woman you are wondering am I pleasing my Lord if I could hear from him he said he puts you on tension put you on God that's what makes you what you are Hallelujah so after all tension is a blessing it was tension that pushed Mary to go to where Jesus will be giv birth to fulfill the law if it was not tension that said everybody go to your hometown there is going to be a population sensous they will not have moved Jesus will be born where it was not prophesied so tension drove them out you can imagine a pregnant woman on the ass of the O pushing up and down oh my tired no in want to receive them yes he cannot be born in the hospital if he's a lamb of God he must be born where Lambs are born it was tension that drove them there attenion is a blessing it's just the way you are looking at it it's just the way you are looking at it see if you just look at the other side no matter how thin you slice anything you so got two sides to rate you see you want to see both sides Hallelujah so I think oh my what's this tension if I could have been born without this tension well if I wouldn't have had this tension I wouldn't have been what I am I wouldn't have been a Christian perhaps it was this tension that drove me to Jesus Christ so he being a blessing to me sometimes God puts you in a situation that will drive you to him when things are good and coozy oh Lord have mercy we sometimes forget God David prayed they was level prayer say Lord do not let me be rich over overflow that I might forget you and do not let me be hungry that I will stale amen and amen that is what tension does in the book of Corinthians 15 you will see Paul the great messenger of God whose aprons and handkerchief was taken from him and were laid on the sick and they were healed that same powerful messenger of God have infirmity he said I've saw the Lord tce but the Lord did not take it away from him does it mean God does not laugh for hello does it mean God does not laugh for you still love him then God told him my grace is sufficient for you Hallelujah he said my grace is sufficient for you that the power of Christ May rest on you and said therefore I will glory in my infirmities that when I am weak I am strong oh blessed be the name of the Lord a prophet also had a stomach infirmity that comes every seven years God used this great man of God across the world seven times great healing campaigns discernment and prophecies Miracles dead being raised and yet God didn't take away that infirmity it took seven years 7 by seven 49 years when he had a vision that little animal was coming to enter his mother gate and he hit the chest and fell down and God told him your enemy is dead but he suffered that infirmity every seven years for 49 years regardless of all the healing in his ministry he didn't change his God he didn't make his God less a Healer said if I go and pray for thousand people and they all die tomorrow I'll still be praying for the sick when you pray and you are not healed does not mean God is not the Healer God still he he the sick you know as humans sometime we pray and we say oh God I pray that heal me so I will know you are God Lord do this for me so that I know you are God let me tell you whether God do it or he does not do it he is still God you can't time God you can't put him in a little match box say Lord unless you do this you are not God he will laugh at you because he being God is by his sovereignty whether he will heal you he will heal you by his will he will not heal you by your desire blessed be the name of the Lord but Abraham said God heals not to prove his power but God heals to keep his word oh blessed be the name of the Lord I want to read from the message perfect strength by Perfect weakness paragraph 181 he said did God feel sorry with for Moses with all his weakness and said oh poor little Moses something has happened to you you fell from your decree Oh my he said he was a great man and intellectual and there was nothing going to stop you he said no God wasn't sorry for him God never took pity on him God had him killed then all of that stuff he wasn't sorry for him you see as humans we always want something we call human sympathy like job when he was going through his his crisis and his friend came around he felt that they will be sympathizing with him oh sorry oh no and when when when you feel that somebody is faing your situation it makes you feel good but brother Abraham said God did not feel pity for Moses he said God didn't feel sorry for him he said we find out if you are putting it down in Exodus 4:14 the anger of God was candled against him God wasn't sorry for him because he was weak God wasn't sorry for him he said you say oh Lord I just feel so bad I don't believe I could do it he said God don't feel sorry for you it feels like kicking you around like football Olympic games that is how God feels like kick you around and when he feel like kicking you around and you still take him as your God that is when you will see the anwers of Christianity but when he kicking around oh I can't bear this anymore I'm done I'm going to come I'm not going to come to church again the pastor is not powerful there is no power here no no you are missing it that is not it blessed be the name of the Lord he says here God don't feel sorry for you he get angry with you you are just getting in a shape then where he can use you blessed be the name of the Lord let us read another scripture here in First Peter 1 Peter 4:12 he said beloved think it not strange concerning the fairy trial which is to try you as though some Str happen on think it not strange but Rejoice but what Rejoice Hallelujah in so much as he are partakers of Christ's suffering that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding Joy if ye be reproached for the name of Christ happy are ye for the spirit of glory and of God God rested upon you on their part he is evil spoken of but on your part he is glorified but let none of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as an evil doer or as a busy body in other men's matters don't give any excuse for the devil I did this because of this I didn't come to church because of this this happened because of this is no s amen but yet if any man suffer as a Christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify God on his behalf for the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God Pastor you are judging me the church is judgmental but judgment must begin in the house of of God because if we are judged here we will not more be judged there that is why the bride of Christ will not be judged we will sit in the throne to judge the world hallelujah oh thank you Jesus Christ you see another one again the same Peter First Peter 1 6 First Peter 1 6-9 wherein ye greatly Rejoice though for now for a season if need be ye are in heav through manold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth the trying of your faith is precious to God more than gold gold Lord is the richest ornament of the richest valuable thing on Earth but the tri of your faith is more precious to God than go that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and glory honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ whom have not seen ye love in whom though now ye see him not yet believing ye Rejoice with joy Jo unspeakable and full of Glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls oh blessed be the name of the Lord are we together church let me continue from the junction of time 56115 paragraph 71 God doesn't promise a flower bed of ease don't fortify a Christian and don't falsify the message by telling them that everything is going to be all right so when you tell them everything is going to be all right and they come to Christ and everything is not all right and they are being chastised and scored of the Lord they turn their back we have been deceived because we are coming with expectation that everything is going to be be all right but they must be mindful that when they are coming every son that he receiveth is cing and chastise Hallelujah we must be mindful that the very tral that is going to try us we should not make it as a strength has happened to us blessed be the name of the Lord he said there is nothing going to harm you there is nothing going there's no old trials there is nothing don't falsify a Christian by telling them that and don't fortify the message also as a PO said must I be carried onto Heaven on the flowy bed of East why others fought to win the prize and sail through bloody Waters said no sir God didn't promise ease and prosperity but he promised Grace to endure in every time is the grace of God is the amazing grace of God that he promised to endure in every time it is Grace that we look to if it's not a grace of God nobody can please God Amen and amen it is his grace that we look to let us read from James chapter 1 verse 2- 4 James CH 1 vers vers 2 to 4 Bible says here my brethren count it all joy when you fall into diverse Temptation knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience the trying of the faith worketh patience but let patience have a perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing some through the waters some through the floods some through the fire but all through the blood some through great sorrow but Jesus Lead along mess Jehovah jaah the prophet of God says every time that a man really steps out to serve God he goes through Tes blessed me the name of the Lord he goes through testing God gives you a little training child training is not very pleasant the Bible said for a while but it yielded Peaceable fruits oh thank you Lord he says that even our fathers in the flesh if they chastise us and correct us how much more our father of all Spirits he said no chastising for the moment is joyous no oh Preacher Man you don't know what I'm going through I'm sorry yes I don't know what you are going through but the good news is you also don't know what I'm going through you are going through some kind of testing and tring I am also going through some kind of test or trial but that has not stopped me from preaching Paul said necessity is also laid on me Pastor Dan is not preaching because all is good for him he has no option but to preach regardless of how he feel what he thinks or what he is going through he is commissioning to deliver the word hallelujah in the message second handed r 56125 m paragraph 55 but Abram said when I heard a pastor say this this morning that many are becoming discouraged why are you discouraged my sister why are you discouraged my brother he said what we need is to be encouraged tonight I'm not here to put fear on you but I'm here to encourage you I'm here to encourage you to put on the full armor of God to draw the sword of the word shine your armor back hold your LS gather with truth hold on to the breastplate of righteousness and prepare your feet for the preparation of the gospel of peace what we need is to be encouraged said that's right trials may come we never was promised to be immune from them theist said trials here sometimes they are many sometimes my feet grows wor Hallelujah and it looks like we cannot make it but after all we're going to make it God will give us sufficient Grace he will give Grace to go through them if the mountain is too high to go over too deep to go under too white to go around it he will give Grace to go through it that's right just don't worry but keep your eyes on Christ for his holy one that can take us [Music] through oh blessed be the name of the Lord he's the only one that can take us through let's read from first 1 Corinthians Chap 10:3 and see what the word of the Lord said here 1 Corinthians chapter 10 verse 13 there had no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that which ye are able but will with the Temptation also make a way of Escape that he may be able to Bear it what a consolation what an encouragement when David went to war with his army and they return and the enemy R the town the camp take away their women their children captive thinking everything everybody's heart was melt and sad but the scripture says that David encorate himself in the Lord is God we have got to come to a time that we have to have inner encouragement self encouragement individual encouragement when the pastor can encourage you when your brethren can encourage you lean on the Lord to encourage you when you lean on God for his encouragement you will not be disappointed and each and every individual must come to a place to know how to encourage yourself in the Lord oh help us Lord tonight from the church ages the prophet of God said persecutions and trials are natural normal part of the Christian Life how do you say trials and persecutions a normal and natural part of the Christian Life what do you mean he said there is only one thing you can do about them commit them all onto God judge not and leave their heart working and final judgment to him as humans when things happen we begin to say things we begin to guess things but no it might not be so when job was going through what he was going through when his friends came around it took about 3 days they were silent they did not say anything why is job was going through what he was going through on Earth little did he know God was gambling with his life above them how did it happen the devil was going through and through as his normal business then one day God told him hey devil have you considered my servant job job was de there yet God went and challenge oh Lord have mercy then the devil said of course you have blessed him what why would a man worship him if you have blessed him so in Christian we don't serve God because we have everything that is not Christianity he said no it's not so you touch him and see said are you sure but the good news is that the devil cannot do anything to you unless God permit him Hallelujah on knowing to Jo the devil told God are you not the one that have thrown a w all of fire around him meanwhile Jo might think he is nobody how you know that God a world of fire around us you might not know but God has secured us oh blessed be the prophet of God said when God is taking you to a trial it means that you are favor with God I'm going through this he says God had confidence in job knowing that job will not disappoint Him Sister when you are going through any kind of trial it shows God has confidence in you God knows you will not let him down God knows you not take the name of God in oh go and take everything you would like and of course job was not worshiping God because of what he has all his animals his cars his sheep

if we live right let care if we live right that doesn't mean that we are immune from TR just like Jo's friend were thinking because going through whatever he's going be careful of how you judge one another you are not the one who the one it to God knows what doing if we live right that doesn't mean that we are immune from troubles frankly it means that all troubles are directed our waying right for many are the afflictions of the righteous but God delivered him out all of them that's a glorious part that one is found in the book of Psalm 34 verse 19 Psalm 34: 19 many other afflictions of the righteous but that is the good news but the Lord delivered the Lord delivered him out of them all but the secret is the f are many and he is not because he's a sinner the Bible didn't say many other

God but your lord deliver him all out of them all oh blessed be the name of the Lord that is a glorious part the Lord open East Africa Africa country Mal I didn't want to go because of experience I when I was I was going by land and uh when I got to malari it was only for a Transit basa to cross over to go to mosambik where my destination was and it looks like the immigration officers didn't want me to Cross they made hell out of this the The Crossing a Transit visitor a visit of two days of $50 they said it's 100 I've paid and when he brought the receipt and the stamp it was I said what about my imbalance he said no we will cancel you you will not go here so I went and I was the step and in the bus going praying to go whatever I was going I was sharing message books of course what I do whatever I go out of missions praying and singing so as I was giving my number was behind I left and 3 month ago or 3 month after us I received a message from a pastor in Malawi and he says he mentioned his name and his training and his many years in Ministry but the book I gave him he has never come across such a book before said I want you to come to malari and bring this message so I said malari again I'm not going with the immigration and all that I went through and whilst I was praying and while they were praying God was giving them Revelation upon Revelation his church members who have not seen who doesn't even know me God will give them Revelation they will describe me to their Pastor that this is the man we saw was so much that God was even giving Revelation to my mom she's in blessed memory now said my son I had a vision you were on a big platform having a crusade somewhere I said finally I canot fight God I said okay I will go and as usual I go through Kenya by flight from West Africa to East Africa then I take four days to cross by road because of the H not because I wanted that way but that is how I could be able to manage to be able to get there so when I get to the B because of the past experience so I have to to change my $50 holding me so when I got I said I'm coming for a Transit so that is my $50 the immigration officer look at me said you I know you I will not let you cross he actually took a pen and crossed my passport refuse entry unless you pay $100 Jesus you see God that is why I didn't want to come here again I didn't want to avoid all those things so I have no option I have to pay and when I got down there to chawa Below blanta in Malawi when that Pastor met me said do you know I invited you I said no he said when we were in that bus I kept hearing the voice of God telling me there is a blessing in this bus I kept looking around where is a blessing it was no long a Pentecostal preacher came to preach in the bus said I commun with my Lord and asked him is that a blessing nothing was ringing so he said you saw a little boy sitting in the entrance of the car the bar bubbling his mouth whether he's singing or praying so said when he were giving out the books said when he stretched the hand to receive that book The Voice spoke back to him this is a blessing so he asked the Lord how can this small bo be a blessing so he said because I need that blessing that is why I invited you here and I said you didn't tell me about this then I told him I am not the blessing the blessing is in those books I gave you then he look at me he said as much as you are carrying those books then you are my blessing then the scripture came back to me in Revelation 1:3 maybe we can read that as our last scripture Revelation 1:3 the Bible said blessed are those blessed is he that reth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written the ring for the time is at hand that is the day understand this prophecy you organized meetings upon meetings conferences and ministers meetings 50 denomination preachers woman preachers all over after the first day meeting the one woman preacher resigned that very evening One Pastor one baptized I think if I remember we baptized about five churches during that campaign in malari and the bush begin to spread all over but yet I asked myself why was I being blocked at the border it was because of that blessing ahead but Abraham said when Satan make a big fight it is a sign to you that there is a blessing ahead that was the southern part of Malawi God brought me to muu the middle B of Mala and you baptized about five pastors also about two three years ago one of them was a a bible school scholar he said I've gone through Bible school by the message you are preaching Apostle I've never heard it before what do I do I said repent and baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and that very day he surrounded he brought the wife to the service in the evening and by the preaching of the word they testify of the service my wife was sick but the Lord healed there right down there I said why would I go to S thing at the border it was last year for the first time God gave me Grace to able to fly over from Kenya to malari and to go be the glory this year the Foreign Affairs have wiped away visa for ghans and malarian when I saw the news I said Thank You Lord so last Sunday I was preping to go and preach for Pastor John Saga my pastor the first Pastor baptized over there sent me a WhatsApp message saw baptism pictures how many were baptized he said two I said glory be to God then he said this is the result because we came to visit us in Mal and these are many other testimonies God is doing in East and Central Africa I was sharing one with Pastor in the car one of them also denomination what God deals with me he give me Grace among denominational churches and somehow somewhere they open their door and I preach the message among them and they believe an entire church and the pastors believe baptizing I give them books and when they hear it they tell the other churches and they all organized so I've lost count of the churches in Uganda in Kenya in malari and Z of but one particular one I would never forget was last year December I was in Kenya when I was preaching the goel among one denominational church with other three pastors coming to one of the pastors who came from a different church he was to the and the wife was a preacher but sheeded Church after and he saw with STS and Tre and they saw me coming with a sword I to all those STS and I to so when I was preaching the message of the hour so hard life Nevers I'm going to work tomorrow even if it's Sunday you want to go for and a half hour before I realize time was gone they even escaped their lunch the lunch was ready nobody want to go out the next day four and half hour I said my god I've never preached more than three hours in my life before the five will go is two and a half about four and half hour oh blessed be the name of the Lord God gave Grace open your eyes his associate pastor baptized his diing baptized the whole church oh my God it was Ring they went to the water and were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ oh my God so I told them that the hard message I was preaching I was apprting denominational stamps increase and I'm sowing the seeds of the message of the in your heart and God gave me Grace the existing Mage churches there the elders are doing very good work behind and they are keeping them active join join services and preaching to them and they are pleading and praying for God to give them Grace to have a place of Fellowship a structure to praise the name of the Lord the testimonies are wonderful sometimes you go far in the north part of Uganda a place called Cabo they were they are out of civilization they are not part they are C Raiders they fight to steal C from one another military are afraid to go there and the pastor didn't tell me so when I came there he said you are the second missionary to come to this place because ministers in Uganda don't want to even go there from the city because the place is dangerous we have to take bike motorbike to ride 15 miles to the Wilderness we have services on the Rocks Under the trees no chair you having good time yet we sit on the floor you preach them standing there is even no water to baptize we have to they have to get a pumping baptism pool and walk miles and fetch water and baptize them I think we baptize 22 from those native lands they don't know their left or right they are living in another world all together there's nothing like Civilization they drink the blood of the cows they are warriors I was told before they come to church with guns and knife and arrows and stick all weapons but when the love of Christ enter their heart they drop all those things and come to church and praise the name of the Lord that is what the love of God can can do as the organist resume her seat that is what the love of God can do in the life of everybody sir this gospel have power to transform this message of the hour is reality this message of the
