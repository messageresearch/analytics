[0:58] asking you it one you're certain say
[1:01] what praise God then you certain what
[1:05] you sing it with a little Tremor in your
[1:07] voice I think you're not too certain you
[1:10] have to be certain one praise God
[1:14] hallelujah amen what kind of a faith
[1:17] will it take for us to get out of this
[1:20] Rapture
[1:22] age amen praise God and where can we
[1:26] find that faith today which church can
[1:29] we find that faith fa in where can we
[1:31] find that
[1:33] Faith amen the prophet said that faith
[1:37] is lying in these messages that's the
[1:40] importance of why we ought to listen to
[1:42] those tapes why we are to read the the
[1:45] spoken word books and why we ought to
[1:47] read our Bible amen the message books
[1:50] are not the Bible amen amen the
[1:53] Revelation the prophet God came out of
[1:55] the Bible amen but the Bible is in a
[1:58] condensed form is that right and then he
[2:01] took that like Jesus when he came to the
[2:04] law uh he said I didn't come to destroy
[2:07] that I come to
[2:09] magnify right he came to magnify it's
[2:11] the translation there I come to magnify
[2:14] now make it a little more plain right
[2:16] that's what the prophet message did to
[2:18] this Bible he came to magnify it praise
[2:21] the Lord and then he turns around wait
[2:23] till them young man come and when they
[2:25] come along they going to take this word
[2:27] and they're going to break it down
[2:30] praise God so you can understand praise
[2:32] God so all the time he's making it
[2:34] clearer clearer clearer down to the
[2:36] stage praise the Lord now how do we get
[2:38] this Rapture in
[2:44] faith how do we get it by
[2:47] hearing ah Faith cometh by hearing and
[2:53] hearing by the word revelation of the
[2:56] word of God com by hearing prophesy
[2:59] hearing means understanding right faith
[3:02] comes by hearing the word of God with
[3:03] your ears you understanding amen and
[3:06] that's where you able to rest your
[3:08] belief on Amen praise God
[3:11] hallelujah how did he not typ the
[3:19] bride by pleasing God Walking with God
[3:23] Amen now go back and think about when
[3:26] brother Brandon was told by the Holy
[3:28] Spirit to go down
[3:30] there and deliver that um well he didn't
[3:34] know that yet was just go down walk down
[3:37] in the city and he walk and walk and
[3:41] he's walking a long time and he start we
[3:43] human beings we get a patient and he's
[3:46] walking a long time and like he's not
[3:48] doing nothing much being the message for
[3:50] so many years I'm not seeing the rain
[3:52] open in the skies and Thunderbolts and
[3:55] lightning I I I didn't see brother Simon
[3:57] speak on arm yet since I've been in the
[4:01] church or leg go back on somebody that
[4:04] had no leg or or some man with one one I
[4:08] socket was empty and all of a sudden the
[4:10] ey socket come back then I can believe
[4:12] oh my see that's the th F we talk
[4:15] rapturing faith is that right see see
[4:19] but he's talking to us of a different
[4:21] thing here amen faith comes by hearing
[4:24] the word of God and Enoch uh pleased God
[4:28] that's the way he did he T the right by
[4:31] pleasing god with rapturing faith praise
[4:34] God let me move on Amen praise God so um
[4:40] how how is it that we can obey the
[4:45] word you can only obey the word after
[4:48] hearing the word or getting a revelation
[4:51] of the word of God hallelujah amen
[4:53] praise God not you brother Philip I'm
[4:56] looking at you but it's not you so don't
[4:57] get nervous
[5:00] praise the Lord how long did he not
[5:03] please God how many years years you sure
[5:07] this man is able to please God for 500
[5:09] years you sure it's not two
[5:11] years you sure that I can't poast I've
[5:14] been in the message for 50
[5:16] years or I post I you know I I I I am
[5:20] more solid than you because I be listen
[5:22] you can be in the message for 100 years
[5:24] and you're
[5:26] still in Christen because that ation
[5:30] part didn't open up fully yet is that
[5:33] right praise God it's only then you can
[5:36] take in the nutrient is when God opens
[5:39] up that
[5:40] word like that praise God hallelujah
[5:43] amen so he pleased God for about 500
[5:46] years of course you must be catching
[5:49] that five is number of Grace okay so you
[5:51] understand that praise the Lord
[5:53] hallelujah uh did he not get all of this
[5:57] rapturing fith in one day or in one
[5:59] night suddenly woke up and I
[6:02] F this is what tell took him to about
[6:05] 500 years for this rapturing fi to
[6:10] accumulate is that is that right yes and
[6:13] it's the same thing with us in other
[6:15] words it's not telling you that you got
[6:16] to wait 500 years but it takes time to
[6:19] be holy it takes time for to build up
[6:23] listen you can get you can get a whole
[6:25] Brew of chickens in 13 weeks is that
[6:28] right
[6:30] but it takes a whole year for an eagle
[6:32] to get
[6:33] one one eag takes a year for them to get
[6:37] one eag look you can get a you can get
[6:40] the Judas or one of these evil spirits
[6:43] in all time you can get a g just give
[6:47] him some money right this one do that
[6:49] easy but it take years for God to build
[6:53] Abraham it take 40 years for God to
[6:56] build a Moses and then him out is that
[6:59] right
[7:00] so when God is building his church God
[7:02] called God train God said now you
[7:05] understand it takes time to be
[7:08] holy praise the Lord hallelujah amen so
[7:11] you got to understand what the Bible is
[7:13] trying to tell you here just like not
[7:16] walk with God you take the time to walk
[7:19] with God and it's not going to happen
[7:21] overnight like that but little by little
[7:24] by little by little what Isaiah said
[7:27] precept upon precept line upon lying
[7:30] here a little there a little what is it
[7:32] it's like God it's like your human body
[7:34] by eating you're adding cells cell cell
[7:38] s on top of cell cell on top of cell
[7:41] building you up and making you grow in
[7:44] Grace praise the name of the Lord that's
[7:46] why you come to the house of God Fe on
[7:49] the word of God and be buil up in this
[7:51] Most Holy face the glory of God
[7:53] hallelujah amen amen yes sir so he
[7:57] didn't get it to in one day or one time
[8:00] but he walked with God for more than 500
[8:02] years and while he's walking he's
[8:05] obeying the word amen and by obeying the
[8:08] word God's GPS amen God's positioning
[8:13] system deliberately guides him he didn't
[8:16] depend on anything else all he depend on
[8:18] is the word and the word is going to
[8:20] guide you right straight into a Rapture
[8:23] yes is that right you can literally
[8:26] close your eyes like all of these
[8:28] self-guided cars they have today and
[8:31] don't have to worry about accidents no
[8:33] more because you're headed for heaven
[8:35] and
[8:36] H and the Holy Spirit of you is going to
[8:38] take your there praise God hallelujah
[8:41] hallelujah
[8:43] I'm praise God forever more praise God
[8:46] praise God praise God hallelujah amen
[8:50] praise God so is the is there a climax
[8:53] for the bright
[8:56] today you believe that this faith that
[8:58] we in is going to
[9:00] clim amen praise God forever more we
[9:03] looking
[9:04] at amen look clim
[9:07] there right you he says we are now
[9:11] walking on the r of edge glory to God
[9:15] you can fall this way you can fall that
[9:17] way amen so therefore the true Christian
[9:19] keeps their battles yes right straight
[9:22] to the middle of the road by the grace
[9:24] of God they don't lean this way or that
[9:26] way but they walk right straight to the
[9:28] middle of the road Hallelujah so the
[9:30] whole thing is a climax praise God oh my
[9:34] praise God so what is Rapture in
[9:42] faith what is it Rapture in
[9:45] faith Revelation more Revelation is
[9:49] needed is that right in this hour to
[9:54] believe and Obey more of the word amen
[9:57] certain parts of the word that wasn't
[9:59] revealed to you before you couldn't obey
[10:02] because you didn't have a revelation on
[10:03] it what did I know about seven seventh
[10:06] angel what did I know about the about
[10:09] Revelation 10 coming to Revel I'm going
[10:11] into Revelation 7 to fulfill God is his
[10:14] own
[10:15] interpreter the unveiling of the Mighty
[10:17] God what did I know all these things
[10:19] could I speak like that before I was a
[10:21] ministering the assem of God but could I
[10:23] speak like that before no I didn't have
[10:25] any clue nothing until God sent up prop
[10:30] and said thus say the Lord reading your
[10:34] Bible of Adam and Eve and the serpent
[10:35] seed and the serpent and Eve I had no
[10:38] idea until the prophet said no it wasn't
[10:41] an act she committed a sexual act with
[10:45] serpent that was not a snake at that
[10:47] time he was a looking like a man that's
[10:50] why God said from today you will go on
[10:53] your belly th say the Lord that settles
[10:58] amen prop say thus sayth the Lord you
[11:01] can rest on that praise God hallelujah
[11:04] what what would do we know about things
[11:06] like that listen let's not take this
[11:08] message simple let's just not take it
[11:11] ordinary and start just resting it on
[11:14] the bookshelf or put it over there and
[11:16] it does it start to become that
[11:17] meaningless to you it's
[11:19] powerful
[11:22] huj it's up
[11:25] today praise God hallelujah I can't
[11:28] preach more ser in one day but I wish I
[11:30] could preach 10 maybe in the whole day
[11:32] and I had the strength to be able to
[11:33] preach 10 in M day and people willing
[11:35] enough to listen because when I read
[11:37] stuff in the papers like uh two days ago
[11:40] the scientist got a breakthrough in
[11:42] Europe where they are now able to create
[11:47] babies in a in a tum without
[11:54] human
[11:56] instrumentality they're literally able
[11:58] to not create
[12:00] designer
[12:02] babies is that
[12:04] right so a black woman can go say I want
[12:07] a blond
[12:10] child is that right I'm just making that
[12:14] extreme so you can understand this is
[12:16] what they're looking at this they can
[12:17] make a lot of money with that you know
[12:20] how much money those guys they can be
[12:22] get very rich right but what will it
[12:24] gain a man if he gains the whole
[12:27] world ping around God's laboratory yeah
[12:30] that's the prophet of God said he said
[12:32] they're going to make a big mess because
[12:34] they're fooling around in God's
[12:36] laboratory right and they don't know
[12:39] what they're playing with it's like kids
[12:40] playing with dynamite or and they don't
[12:43] know what they're playing with they're
[12:44] trowing a grenade and they think it's a
[12:46] ball a cricked ball and they can just
[12:48] slap with a back or something in the AR
[12:51] right that's what they're doing right
[12:52] now the whole world is going crazy
[12:55] theming is going wet amen hallelujah
[12:58] amen now let me let me now ask you a
[13:01] question personally
[13:03] now do you have more Revelation
[13:06] today than the day that you came into
[13:09] the
[13:11] master can you honestly say that that
[13:14] you understand a lot more and you're
[13:17] getting every day you're getting more
[13:19] and more
[13:21] Revelation from the day you came into
[13:23] this
[13:27] [Applause]
[13:33] listen Lord faith is required but we not
[13:36] saying like some people are pulling away
[13:39] that is some kind of a different Faith
[13:42] it's the same Faith praise God but
[13:45] you're looking at it from a different
[13:47] point of view because it's a spiritual
[13:49] revelation of the will and the word of
[13:52] God Amen being in 100% agreement with
[13:55] him fi for this out
[14:00] Me Not Looking Back oh when brother was
[14:04] here when brother was there when brother
[14:07] Paul Jones brother Phil fer chers or one
[14:10] of these Great Men pus or one of these
[14:14] Great Men of the past maybe had little
[14:17] things here and there but what they were
[14:19] saying was essentially true it's not
[14:21] even looking back on those things you
[14:24] understand we we we looking
[14:26] ahead they are some of those men the
[14:29] bridges and the ladders that we climb up
[14:32] on to be able to get revelation of the
[14:35] word and they already serve that purpose
[14:37] you can't keep looking back even at the
[14:39] prophet himself you can't keep looking
[14:41] back looking back Amen in other words
[14:44] it's like we not a FR frog F froggy F
[14:48] where where you're looking backwards but
[14:49] you're jumping
[14:51] forwards if you do that you're going to
[14:53] crash you're going to have problems amen
[14:55] you got to look Keep Your Eyes Upon Your
[14:59] word of the Living God hallelujah amen
[15:03] praise God and every day as you walk
[15:04] your faith is going to get
[15:06] stronger why because we are Abraham seed
[15:10] and the Bible says as Abraham was going
[15:14] old living longer yet he sted not
[15:17] because of unbelief am because his got
[15:22] stronger and stronger instead of him you
[15:25] know some people get older the being in
[15:28] the message longer and the fa
[15:30] get got to start questioning this
[15:32] questioning that more and more instead
[15:35] of their faith building up and getting
[15:37] stronger they start getting weaker but
[15:39] every see their fth get stronger right
[15:42] I'm stronger amen I'm stronger that of
[15:47] rapturing starts to change their body
[15:49] while
[15:51] they they start getting caught up in the
[15:54] Revelation first and then the Revelation
[15:57] begins to change that
[16:00] oh praise God forever more what are we
[16:03] talking about praise God we talking
[16:04] about things that they can't even dream
[16:06] to talk about amen hallelujah amen
[16:09] brother BR said rapturing faith is
[16:11] laying in these messages hallelujah amen
[16:15] if that's the truth then feed on the
[16:17] messages feed on the messages hallelujah
[16:20] praise God hallelujah what kind of
[16:22] offend are you being built up in right I
[16:28] trust TR and I believe and I am certain
[16:32] that I'm preaching the kind of faith
[16:34] that will build you into Rapture
[16:36] rapturing faith if you will receive it
[16:40] if you will believe it if you will obey
[16:42] it if you will just this message is not
[16:47] just it's not just fun and fellowship
[16:50] and and stuff like that but brother
[16:53] along with all those things which is
[16:55] wonderful it's a serious commit
[16:59] to listening and receiving the word for
[17:03] your listen to The Prophet no matter how
[17:06] many years you been listen listen to The
[17:08] Prophet that's where it lays it's laying
[17:10] in the messages right praise God I'm
[17:14] just an every other minister that's
[17:16] really truly anointed it's just the
[17:18] voice to be able to pick up the word and
[17:21] speak it so that you buying Revelation
[17:24] through the Holy Spirit can tap into the
[17:27] Unseen part of the word right that's
[17:30] what we have been used for praise God so
[17:33] no Pastor no Minister can give you
[17:35] Revelation you have to catch Revelation
[17:39] amen by the Holy
[17:41] Spirit you are the grace of God
[17:44] hallelujah amen oh praise God and uh let
