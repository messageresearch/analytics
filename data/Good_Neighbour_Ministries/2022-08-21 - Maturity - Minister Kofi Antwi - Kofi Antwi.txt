[Music] [Applause] so [Music] i didn't know the title i must put it on the subject that i'll preach about it and here brother mike walked in the room and i asked him brother how are you he says by go he started talking i'm fine by god's grace bro mike i won't speak for you if i speak i can't speak the sentence right so i would like you to come and speak what you said this morning in the room while we were in the room there and i would say give me five give me five give me five so i want you to come and speak for yourself yeah brother sorry for putting the spotlight on you i know you don't like it but hey god does mysterious uh thing the way that you were speaking then from there they will know for themselves i didn't know you were preaching this morning i have no idea said in the trustee office you're just fellowship anyway so my apologies i didn't know you're preaching no i was expecting god to speak so i'm looking around anyway and god spoke through you the lord was blessing us this morning because uh we were just the thought that we were thinking on this morning was maturity a mature bride and uh and i told brother coffee i said brother you know you could you could see a young lady and this has nothing to do with how old you are by the way but generally speaking how will you see a young lady she could be fully formed and uh and everything but here you are as a uh what are you 40 years old 30 35 60 here you are as a a mature man but you can't have fellowship you got to have fellowship with somebody who's mature and i just we're just talking about that and how he is mature and he can only have fellowship with a mature bride and that's what he's after he's a mature bride and uh i trust that uh no matter where you are we're just all growing by god's grace but we're growing in maturity and we have to come to that place and uh let's have fellowship with him but i honestly i didn't know you were preaching so i didn't know i was i was disturbing you i was blessed because i was expecting god to give me the title of my message and here he came and he spoke about maturity right and in my heart i was thinking i was gonna give a title like god wife no matter what the devil does will come up victory so when he came and he was speaking in that line i caught him and secondly in my heart this morning the thought was saying brother timber before even i i read my scripture finish you have to pray before i perceive the word of god and i'm thinking about god that lord is it my mind or god is doing something and here the brother called him to pray the words that i was thinking in my heart even was coming from his lips i was on the back there crying because i know that vindicate to me that god is moving so praise the lord i'm gonna bring the word what the lord give it to me thank you brothers i really appreciate you deacons because for you stepping aside i am just like a trashcan and i see how the power of god use you brothers i'm the least in the kingdom and here i am god today he chose me to stand here and to bring the word so bear with me i'm not a great speaker i i know how to talk but i'm not a and when i say i'm not a great speaker i'm not a great reader or great knowing the prophet says this the prophet says that's all right but whatever god placed in my heart i'm gonna bring it and i'm trusting him i'll take myself aside that he will take control and speak whatever he speak you better open your heart and take it because brother kofi don't have that kind of wisdom but he have always done and he is god that we look to we don't look to man we look to him so as we go in the word brother you already have the title what i said place it on what i'm going to preach is let us stand up as we go into the word of god my subject the scripture i'm reading is first john chapter 3 verse 3 to 15 and i'll read first john 5 3 to chapter 5 3 3 number of three so you know what tree mean so brad timber would you come and lead us in prayer before we perceive i still want you to pray because you were in my heart to pray even though the brother called him i still have to let him pray before we we we we perceive the word of god brother you are on my heart this morning okay father as we approach thy holy throne which we know that it's within us oh god the kingdom of god is within us as we open your word father there's no man that could our prophet has taught us no man can touch this no man's hands can touch this lord yes lord only though only the hand of god can take the word and place it in our hearts this morning lord yes lord so take the word this morning father lord our brother lord desires to be out of the way fully take his heart take his take what you placed in his heart what you placed in his life lord and even go above that this morning lord and speak to our needs this morning yes we commit everything into thy hands thy word father as his red father let signs and wonders and miracles within our lives around our lives our children our grandchildren our homes our finances take place father yes as we believe your word in jesus name amen thank you brother okay the scripture read first john chapter 3 verse 3. and every man that he and every man that had this hope in him perfect himself even as he is pure whosoever commits sin transgreate also the law for sin is the transgression of the law and you know that he is manifested to take away our sins and in him is no sin whosoever uh whosoever abided in him saying it not whosoever seen it had not seen him neither know him little children let no man deceive you he that he that does righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous he that commits sin is of the devil for the devil sin from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil okay so whosoever is born of god does not commit sin for his seed remained in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god in this the children of god are manifested and the children of the devil whosoever does not righteousness is not of god neither he that love it not his brother for this is the message that he heard from the beginning that we should love one another not as cain who was of the of that wicked one and slew his brother and therefore slow he him because his own words were evil and his brother's righteous marvel north my brethren if the world hates you we know that we have past past from death unto life because we love the brethren he that loveth not his brother abide in dead okay that's verse 5 chapter 5 verse 3 for this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grieved for whatsoever is born of god overcome the world and this is the victory that overcome the world even our faith may the lord have this blessing praise the lord god is good please be seated you know when we were born we were born with the seed of god and the devil taught because what our mother eve did sometimes and many other times he put so many dust garbages on our flesh and he accuses even when we come to church what he does is he will continue accusing us and because we're born into a cultural family we have taken the world wisdom so much and we didn't know who we are but god by his grace know who we are because the pharisees when mary magdalene committed adultery which it was not her it was the devil packing some garbage on her flesh and that devil was accusing mary magdarin and saying i caught you on the very act right it was the devil accusing mary magdalene and may why because of what our mother eve did so the seed was buried in mary murdering but jesus knew god knows our hearts he knows each and every one heart what kind of seed is hidden there and no matter what that seed if it is of god no matter how much dust the devil has put on it that seed it will grow and come maturity and it will grow and fulfill what god has accomplished that seed to accomplish jesus said my seed will my word will never return unto me void it means it is his seed the true seed word of god in you it will never return why no matter what you do that seed is going to come forth so when mary murray the devil was accusing her i caught her on the very act and it's true she caught her that is the flesh but jesus looked beyond the flesh of mary madarin and he was seeing his seed and he said jesus said turn to the devils i call them devils there were you and i naturally speaking they were standing there as human beings but they were devils right they were devils accusing the seed of god that that is not of god but jesus was looking beyond and saying amongst you who have never committed sin let him cast the first stone they were supposed because they cannot cast the stone because they themselves they don't have the seed word of god because the seed of god does not sin that seed once you are born into this world the seed in you god sent it here to come to make manifest because you your seed is the word for the hour that's why the devil tried to accuse you some of us the devil has been accusing us for too long even when we come to church he's he'll continue bombarding some of us but let me tell you this is the hour if the seed of god dwells in your soul you have to know who you are that in you there is no sin in you is christ the lord a new is maturity of the lord he knew his profession of the lord in you is the glory of the lord in you everything jesus said he was talking about you and you are here the devil can do you nothing don't be afraid that's why brother abraham when i think it was a cow or something he saw somebody tall in his uh vision or something he says boo that was that was the devil trying to pull him down but when he said boo the team begin to get smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller there is a bullet anything going away that is same time satan is a bluff it is a blood to you god has used pastor simon with the fight for ministry i'm looking at the corners sitting here building you taking all the dust that covering you taking every tradition every culture every sin that the devil has buried you but god doesn't see you as a sinner he sees you as a pure heart and the bible says blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god so you will see god if you are true pure seed word of god you will see god nothing can change you nothing will be hindering you not to see christ because let me tell you in him is perfection in him the world that things the world having seen in him dwell the fullness of godhead bodily so you are in him you are perfect i said you are perfect i don't see you as a sinner i don't see listen i'm not here in interested of nobody mistake that is the devil that put into my brother the devil that put that mistake into my sister i don't care about that all i care is the seed of god laying down there that's what i'm interested that's what the quality is that's what the profession is that's where we came here to fulfill the word of god this is the hour this is the time this is the hour the blind the wife of christ won't be deceived because no matter what he do god has let us know who we are that's why jesus when he told mary magdalene go home and see no more what is sin unbelief of god where sin is not drinking committing adultery the prophet has told us already brother abraham has as god in him has let him expose the word of god to us playing before our eyes and we know that listen even when he preached the same devil has come in the message using the course thinking he can deceive the elect with your big cause but brothers and sisters let me tell you this is not about a man this is not about some great man would get caught because he can quote the bible can read the bible the prophet couldn't read bearer and when he told even the preachers they told him you cannot read better you gonna go around the world with no education to preach to things and this and that the prophet says i'm not lis i'm not leaning to my own knowledge i'm not learning to whether i can read or i can't read all that matters is god in my soul he told me what i will do and if god has told you god has called you he told you before the foundations of this world and call you out you have to know who you are you have to stand up and push the devil away because you are a child of god one revelation will crush the devil ahead because you were in christ because the bible says go read genesis 3 the seed of the woman will bruise the serpent head and he will bruise his heel who was that christ and where were you you were in christ so when he broke the serpent head don't you know you are part of that bruising the second head and if you are here in flesh you're gonna do the same thing because it is jesus i said it is jesus here is jesus pull the gift i said pour the gifts you will pray the gift as i'm standing here let me tell you it's like a sea i see the water is in inside so much but if you don't pull the gift the the water won't rival the word won't come out it will get stuck but you will pray the gift don't look at me that oh brother coffee is oh nothing we never see him stand here it doesn't mean nothing to god glory to god glory to jesus let jesus have his way this morning i tell you the truth i have been in a place where i'm speaking the power of god will fall people dropping down crying devils coming out healing i've seen all that i know what god can do i know i can do it let me tell you as i stand here god knows my heart i cannot do it but he can i'm trusting him once he is in my soul that's all matter i move myself out of the way i'm not a proper preacher with dignitaries and proper way talking yes sir god there with me on the street i have gone to prostitute house places we crops countries seen dead bodies see people get killed bottle run people head stomach dying in lagos desmond leaving lagos you know what i'm talking about it i have seen all that so i wasn't brought up what couldn't caught and this that no god brought me on the street and the way he has mauled me that's the way i'm gonna bring the word whether you like it or not i am not here to please man because i even told him i have fought with him i have fought with god i remember one time when i came to the message i was telling blood that's more and brother philip a brother used to tell me oh brother i wish they have to put you on the pulpit to preach and i got to pass a simon knowing nothing brother i have no knowledge nothing i said brother i believe god called me to preach that time when we went early stage he rebuked me but you know what that time god has revealed him to me that is my pastor so as soon as he said that i said brother you are right you are right and that put me off i know the brother was lying so since that time anybody can tell me god call you to preach you know what i used to think i used to think they have a devil on them but they still won't go away it will not go away no matter what i do it will not go away i'm repeating people and time to time they tell me they tell me even on the street they tell me when i was preaching in pentecostal church they tell me so many ways i said what is this i know when my eyes begin to open to the word as the last place i want it i don't want it i remember when we were in the workers like bro gabriel is here he would say what a huge you are here i want to church me brother gabra adam three of us prayer night and i'm looking that time they have made me trustee and i'm standing there and nobody is coming that night and i'm going my god so no decon coming to preach what is going on i go stand on the street i leave them quiet go stand on the street i said what is this we come here to listen to the brothers who are capable preaching the gospel and here nobody's here what is going on tonight and i'm going on the tree like that eight o'clock nobody is there and i says what in the world is this okay let me go stand there just read psalm 23 i go i read while i was reading brother gabriel i was sitting there he thought in his mind what is this brother doing what are you going to preach tonight all of a sudden there was a letter in his pocket but someone has visited him and told him when he comes to the prayer night she'll tell the church to pray for brother frank that time brother frank was there i look at brother gabriel i said brother gabra pray for brother frank is her go boom he confessed say brother i know that how this is what i was thinking when you were standing there i said brother let me tell you if you really know who is standing there i'm struggling even i don't want it i'm i'm crying for the deacon to be there [Applause] but i'm telling the truth as it is i'm crying for the deacons to be there i don't want to be there but i says nobody's there i see trey of us coming along we have to at least somebody have to stand and it fall on me so i have to just do literally brother gabriel recognized that this brother no god is doing something that time i try to run run run run run but the moment i run i can't i can't it's listen preaching is not by education it's not by how a man will choose you and put you in the pulpit bank no denomination does that mean right denominations does that and even in this message so many preachers have done that but that is not the way of god amen i am not saying god can like god's servant pastor simon god can reveal to him i'm using him as an example to point a brother to choose a brother to lead you understand god use people like that but it has gone so bad in the message this is what they are doing and it's thinking god knows okay those things stink in god knows because god set in the church the fight for ministry god chose them god will vindicate them he'll vindicate them by his way he will identify them whether they are i always say whether they are educated university college great one no education at all god will bring them and when they come whether one word in the ellipse god will unhate whether time was god will unact he used the prophet as an example to us there was no beauty to desire a prophet that came the message the glorious message that shot the earth at this 20th century god was hiding with abraham and speaking to us he wants to know how he operates that is not the wisdom of man because he says my thoughts are not your thoughts my words are not your ways my thoughts are higher than your tongue my words are higher than your wish so therefore let me do it i have the knowledge i have the wisdom i created everything your eye could see i formed the light i created all things and i am the same god i cannot i lie not so at this hour what god is doing right you could see he was he is now bringing his perfect will to his bride his wife his perfect will he has taken us to let us know through our beloved brother pastor simon for us to know that things even in the message so-called message god has brought us up not us alone but everywhere that his spirit is moving because the true wife of christ are gonna leave those that are in the mess age because the message is progressing god's spirit is moving and it's not moving by education is moving by predestinated as he said jacob have i loved esau have i hate because eat everything based on the seed it's not your mother christianity won't get you in your father christianity won't get you in your husband christianity won't get you in white christianity won't get you in it's all about what jesus christ his seed and if it is his seed in you no matter what you do you are going to come out perfect because the seed of god does not commit sin because god is unchangeable god he's a reality god he is god that heals all our disease if you are sick let me tell you jesus has healed you already because the true seed of god in you let you all know uh you all know hey doctors tell me i have cancer you think i believe that i'm gonna die no i don't because unless god said so nothing can take my life i have come to that point i'm not joking the seed of god in me is stronger than any sickness the seed of god in you danny is stronger than any devil what devil can do to you what devil can do to you sisters what a devil can do to you don't give him chance let me tell you look him in the eye and says i am a child of god when he comes with a stretch you stand there and says i know who i am i have eternal dwelling me and i am a child of the king brother braham know who he was he know that he was the 20th century prophet he know that he was the one that have to fulfill malachi 4 5. luke 10 luke 10 17 he know all those scriptures so when he came to knowing who he was you think the devil could conquer him no that's why the word of god is passed on that's why christ came down when you are a bride and you know who you are and bring christ on the sea and when christ come on the scene you know what it does to you you light up darkness free darkness free from you all the time you are light up because christ is the light of the world is the light in you if you are light up what has satan got to do with you the thing that satan scared is light christ light the pill of fire certainly scared off so sister brother don't be afraid look away to jesus and walk in the light brother as you said when you are walking the light the devil don't want to come close the devil know as our pastor said you are like a hot potato for him and a hot potato he cannot eat he cannot eat a hot potato because he's so hot gonna burn his mouth let me tell you you the world talking about nichola bomb you my brothers my sisters you the spirit of god in you if they want to see the true negro you are that negro they can do nothing nothing you are more than that nuclear power you are more than conqueror you are more than everything you think you are god is hidden in your soul god is telling you when you look through his word in you he doesn't see you as a sinner he see himself and when god sees himself himself light up because jesus christ is the light of the world he sees himself that himself there's no sin that's what god looked into that's why god told david you are a man after my own heart don't you know we are the wife of christ we are the people after god or heart that's why god can never leave us listen i'm speaking play i don't know who is the bride the wife of christ but i know i am you must know for yourself you must know for yourself if you don't know cry out to the lord say lord brother coffee says he know he's one but he don't know about me and i don't know myself so lord help me to know help me help me it's not a joke it's not because oh brad then is powerful in the lord so his wife is so powerful in the lord and his wife is going with brother danny wait no we are going as individuals we are going as individuals jesus said to be in the bed i'll take one and leave one to be in the field i'll take one and leave one what did brad brahm says there are three classes of the message people believers make believers and unbelievers we are all sitting in there okay so it's not me to tell you you are an unbeliever it's not me to tell you you are make believer it's not me to tell you you are a believer we are just preaching the gospel the brothers just preach the gospel we just cast the net and the net we don't know who is but god knows that's why in this message we that have been here long we have seen one time where so many the church busted out then it goes broke there so many emboss it out sometimes the people you think they are strong they busted up right people that won't humble themselves they won't subject to the pastor the will of god that is leading they won't subject to the deacons let me tell you it doesn't matter even if you are deacon if he doesn't submit to god god will move you it doesn't matter you sit in the bench if you doesn't submit to god god will move you let me tell you this flesh is not of god every person this flesh is not of god we all make this flesh make mistakes but what if you are a child of god you make mistake that's why i always say i come with danny timber christopher brother mike whoever sister but if i'm wrong and god begin to speak to my heart for me to know i'm not ashamed i'll come and repent i always said that if i haven't seen it then i'm staying on my ground but the moment god begin to reveal to me i have to repent and turn to god the gospel so many come in the message they try to help things and god doesn't like it god wants everything on the table your lifestyle have to be on the table and if you are doing things it may be wrong in even people's eyes but if god likes it doing if you are doing right in people eyes and god doesn't like it stop it because god is the one that we look into but again you've been blessed he's being one as our pastor said one of the oldest in the church right you have seen so much brother mike then later maybe tim beer and the rest brother brian and cole coming then we came later without once came later no matter how you think you are weak you are stronger than what you think brother you are so strong in the lord more than what you think okay don't let the devil push you around you don't know nothing you don't know nothing so i'm i'm in the lord in my come on brother you are stronger you are stronger than what you think i'm just telling you from my heart and i believe it's god speaking to you he's telling you you are strong be strong in the lord you are not a you you a military guy you know how military behave i live in the barracks i know how so just be a no soldier when the trumpet sound and the soldier head will be down every soldier you see them running for their gun or sharp dress up ready to go because they understand the trumpet this is the hour when god is saying i'm bringing my children from north south east west and i'm pulling them out all the mess in the message i am pulling them out and i'm revealing myself to them individually and i'm calling them to know who they are so because some are depressed some have used intellectual to oppress god's children writing the message and god is saying no i can't worry that i'm gonna seek my sheep i'm gonna save them bring them out i'm gonna feed them i'm gonna punish them just dress them with my word and even you may look at them they are they are like nobody from beginning all of a sudden you see that ball coming to bone like uh i think joseph born in egypt they have to take it to israel right that won't have to come out from egypt because he can't stay shaking and panicking let me tell you when god there's no fear when you when god light you up no fear in you again as i stand here no doubt no fear i know who i am i am so certain of god and when i'm speaking i know god is on my side god is with me it doesn't matter whoever believe or don't believe i trust him and once i trust him he identify himself that he is with me that's all i worry about when anybody trusts me and god doesn't trust me i'm done but when god trusts me that i'm doing his perfect will that's what matters to me jesus christ will never fear us he will never forsake us let us put trust in him let us when we come to church worship him don't let your mouth or your joy cross let me tell you as you said it when queen elizabeth call you and tell you the whole world go he make you in charge and you're gonna take put some gold in all your clothes dress you with the best car which is rose rice and just inside with gold for you to sit in what you gonna do you go in a meeting and you're gonna be you go in a meeting like this once you are dressed with gold and you control the whole world goal don't you know that's what jesus has done to you jesus has placed himself in you the greatest thing that will strike the earth is not billions of dollars that delegate heart or not like the queen heart the greatest thing that will strike on this earth is jesus christ in your soul that's why brother abram said you could speak a word and go and live inside you can create your own world and go living because the greater that he that is in you that he that is in the world so be happy there's no sadness in christ there's no lukewarm in christ there's no laziness in christ we have to rise up and know who we are and walk with our chess board with no fear that we know who we are it is we that the world will come against because the word of god are what is going on the stock market the world things the churches they are coming against the bride they are coming everywhere system is coming against god's wife and this is the hour this is the time know who you are what you are raised for what you stand for if you don't know who you are this time go down your nest cry unto the lord say lord i have walked with you i am short of your spirit i am short of your word father jesus feel me let me know who i am let me have confidence let me know that i am not just ordinary person i am you and i are one because the bible says we are born of his bone spirit of his spirit word on top of the word that he is and you're gonna walk with your head down no sir the bible tells you jesus christ look the wall the same yesterday today and forever don't you know you came from him and you are part of him and if he is resurrected you there's no debt for you if your body goes this flesh go in the great absent from this body you are present with the lord what else do you be afraid he has conquered death and proved to us that he said i am he that was dead and i'm alive forevermore praise god you don't you know you're going to be alive forevermore you're going to be created as goddess don't you know you will sit with him and judge the world the bible says the sense of god will judge the world let me tell you it's you you brother you gonna judge the world the whole world the kings the queens you're gonna check them you sitting here if god see dwell in you you are going to judge the world work as somebody of christ on the edge now i'm taking my authority i'm taking my position before i thought i was nobody i am dummy i am literate i am no good i am this that's what i used to put on myself now god says no no no no no no no you are not like that i don't see you in those category i see you as myself my you are my spirit of my spirit born of my bones flesh of my flesh and through jesus christ he said i can do all things through christ what do you think you can do our things let me tell you if you are poor started speaking with boldness by revelation let me tell you nothing gonna come to you with your hair down i don't care how the world economy is my wife's sitting here long time someone used to preach i don't even have one cent in my pocket and i took my wife in toronto working on the houses we're going to houses to houses as his wife from toronto to hamilton one of the house is my scarborough doesn't belong to me because if i go live there i can come to church me number one the word of god i'm not joking it doesn't belong to me i can't i can't live there and come to here and no matter how on until my dead bones before i leave here because i see the water flowing this is the gas station let me tell you every time i come here i get fill up yeah you may see me shouting crying it's hard his brother is there to cry this dad is because it's the love of god throwing through my heart the joy of the lord throwing through my heart okay because i'm seeing the holy spirit using the brother brother christopher i see him as a teacher i see timber preach with a power of god like a blimp stone and fire sometime i see danny teaching sometimes i see him preach like a brimstone and fire i see philip coming i says oh my god you want me to stay away unless unless my dead bones yes i'm telling you the truth unless something serious serious that i couldn't get away to be here i want to be here because you know what when you come you get you you go there's one says juicy it's like the the apple or like the orange it's so juicy you drink it it drips all your mouth that you are happy listen money is good but money can bring happiness money without christ will be the miserable miserable in the world but then he knows he used to deal with millions of dollars and he was he himself said he was smoking cocaine and all kinds of addicts until god turned him around he cried out the seed of god in him cry out to god held him now he's free he may not have i don't know how much he have he may not have that 10 million 20 million physically but he we want this one better than that 20 million is the truth we got to tell us it is we human beings we want proper talk proper this way proper time what's the time 12 something okay maybe 10 minutes time i stop okay proper proper preaching proper talk proper way of doing things with books and everything have to be conducted is that no no no that's not that's not me i love the way pastor sermons preach because you know what i see myself in the preaching because listen god knows me better than anybody he can't put me to a proper proper conduct with all kinds of education and no that doesn't work for me no no brother coffee brother coffee don't want that no no no no it's not my heart but i i want some men sometimes you preach this way that way this way that will drop here this way that and you talk and that's the way me i am you understand and i'm seeing everything all the questions brother mike you remember the day i was cramping up the chain with uh igniting them western road that's what i was seeing i saw god i told you i saw god because through that kind of preaching i don't care whether two or three i'm looking for god so my heart was burning seeking and i would do anything to seek my lord and god by his grace revealed to me and since that time listen dear little deadly uh and i'm so happy i'm so happy listen i don't have a hundred thousand or even five thousand in the bank even two thousand i don't but let me tell with this word of god i don't care how much a person have if god wants me to talk to that person i will talk and i will tell him god put into my heart even whether you're gonna kill me i'll say but as we grow immature if god says does it don't speak i don't want to speak if god says speak i'll speak that's the way i want to be god wants me to be and move the way god wants i want to do his will and know in your heart that the seed that god planted in you it cannot sing it will go back to god as god says it is it will accomplish every word of god that god sent here for and have confidence because when god designed you let me tell you we didn't design you with rob okay god didn't design his children with rag only sometimes the prophet our pastor has said it but god's children sometimes we want to walk with rags i have done it and thinking i'm carrying my cross at me alone and i'm taking the cross and nobody else all for jesus is coming shake off that spirit and know who you are and begin to speak if you are poor speak prosperity if you are sick speak healing if your children are not in speak them you have to speak not the pastor not danny not in beer not christopher not desmond not philip not brother callie once they get in the pulpit you think oh they have to speak for you brother of you will speak for you speak yourself jesus said why christ speak moses speak and go forward did i not commanded thee did i not place my word in thee i said when you speak i will perform it unless you don't believe me if you don't believe me then if there is doubt in your heart repent and speak and go forth the moment i begin to recognize that on my life i begin to speak i say lord i need a house i need a house from here too how many paul sitting here asking we used to go to orangeville he says oh there's house selling there we go there there's house selling here we go there we don't have money but we were driving like crazy looking for a house this doesn't sound like improper my wife that time we don't have one dollar we used to go as soon as possible was preaching that kind of preaching i said this now i got it i got it i'm gonna put it to action put it to washing don't let the world stay in the pew you think god is a god on the pew god don't want you to be a pewarma put his word into watching because there's a work that you have to do nobody can do it and unless you stand up to the standard and begin to speak so i begin to speak i begin to speak and believe speak and believe come and see the house god has given to me come and see the house god gave it to me and my wife he gave us not like that that time that from that moment he gave us two brand new cars within a short time you seen it he's outside there we bought it brining paul had one my wife bought one for her i bought 2017 from nothing things began to move because god every bone that belongs to me to come back every bone that belongs to you has to come to you don't let the devil tell you you are nobody you can do nothing the seed of god cannot sin go forth whether you have to go forth and take it from the devil hand if you are say take healing from the devil hand the devil brought that sickness to you god didn't bring sickness to his wife god had no sickness to his wife so is the devil that is bringing it take that healing from the devil hand and says you are taking my healing i claim it in the name of jesus i claim my prosperity in the name of jesus you have taken my money i claim it in the name of jesus let me tell you god is real the god brother abraham preaches not a dead god he's a mature god he's a god of a healer he's a god of a savior he's god of abundance how much can you take according to your faith so will it be up to you blessed be the name of the lord i'm watching the time i have about two minutes then i then brother you you get yourself here i'm i'm gonna begin to wind up i don't want to continue keep you here long because you know when you preach so much long the people can take it in africa they can take three

you whether you are able to bring the world more to them honor because they are so hungry one old lady told me he says when i was small a preacher passed in my village and he said some word of god since that time nobody has passed that village until you came here you spoke that way he was 70 years old he says i will let you baptize me i don't know when i'm gonna die when god gonna call me this is the second time i'm hearing the voice of god in my life since from baby through you and you walk in the water with me and i'm baptizing i never go there again i told her i said if you don't see me believe in jesus when the heaven door open that name jesus take with you if you take it in your heart with you jesus will open the door for you brothers and sisters i came here today to encourage you to let you know that there's no sin in you that's all i'm saying to you you have no sin so go home if the devil has put complex on you leave that complex and give it back to him you are free in christ
