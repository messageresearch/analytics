[45:35] and then speaking on this I will
[45:39] reiterate or my reputation some of the
[45:43] things I've already taught and said but
[45:46] it's necessary so that we could as you
[45:49] know the carpenter doesn't hit the nail
[45:51] one time
[45:53] but he clinches it right
[45:56] and repetition is a very useful and
[46:01] important tool that God himself uses he
[46:04] which he said in the word he says the
[46:07] things I'm saying to you repeated to
[46:09] your children your children's children
[46:11] and to your generations and then he will
[46:15] go back and tells you by another Prophet
[46:18] remember I said this over here and this
[46:21] is and he repeats it again it's so that
[46:24] it stays in our hearts it's God planting
[46:26] seeds Seeds of Life praise the Lord and
[46:30] may the Lord bless us this morning of
[46:32] course I again I will not complete this
[46:34] but it lays the foundation so that we
[46:39] can continue on on the next time praise
[46:42] the Lord uh before I go into the word
[46:45] just so that I remind you that I will be
[46:50] leaving for Israel

[49:04] and I wept much because no man was found
[49:09] worthy to open and to read the book
[49:13] needed to look Beyond

[49:19] not Behold The Lion of the tribe of
[49:23] Judah the root of David has prevailed
[49:29] to open the book and loose the Seven
[49:32] Seals thereof
[49:35] and I beheld
[49:37] and law in the midst of the throne and
[49:40] of the four beasts and in the midst of
[49:43] the elders there stood a lamb as it had
[49:47] been slain
[49:49] oh praise God having seven horns and
[49:53] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[49:55] of God sent forth into all the Earth
[50:00] and he came and took the book out of the
[50:03] right hand of him that sat upon the
[50:05] throne and when he had taken the book
[50:08] the four and the four Beeson Four and
[50:11] Twenty Elders who fell down before the
[50:15] lamb having what every one of them harps
[50:19] and golden vials
[50:22] full of orders which are the prayers of
[50:27] the Saints
[50:30] and they sung a new song
[50:33] saying worthy though the word worthy to
[50:37] take the book and to open the seals
[50:40] thereof
[50:41] for thou was slain
[50:45] and has redeemed us to God by thy blood
[50:49] out of every Kindred and tongue and
[50:55] people and nation and has made us Kings
[50:59] and Priests and we shall reign upon the

[51:24] hears the word here today May the spirit
[51:28] of almighty God come upon the scene Lord
[51:31] and speak to our hearts not just me
[51:35] standing up here speaking to them they
[51:37] can see me they can hear me but may your
[51:40] voice be heard
[51:42] in every heart May every one be
[51:45] conscious of God his presence and his
[51:48] power and his revealing of his own word
[51:52] for his glory for we ask this in the
[51:55] name of Jesus Christ for the glory of
[51:57] the father amen and amen God bless you
[52:00] please be seated
[52:03] Hallelujah
[52:05] amen
[52:08] we have been given a wonderful scene
[52:13] here in the Bible
[52:17] and the scene that we are seeing
[52:21] is that the great Ancient of Days
[52:25] was sitting on his throne high in the
[52:29] heavens and he had a book within his
[52:34] hand
[52:37] now we know that that book was the book
[52:41] of redemption
[52:43] that he had in his hand this great book
[52:46] of redemption
[52:48] Adam and Eve had lost this book
[52:52] they lost the book they lost their
[52:55] generations of the uh elect which that's
[53:00] all they should have reproduced and they
[53:04] lost the right to have that and to do
[53:07] that and other seed could now pass
[53:10] through them and they found themselves
[53:13] with a hybrid religion a hybrid approach
[53:17] to God mixed Faith with all kinds of
[53:21] stuff mixed in it amen you see so they
[53:25] lost their rights or you would say title
[53:29] they lost their rights to to that book
[53:33] uh for the revealing of that book by God
[53:38] taking that and manifesting it through
[53:41] them through reproduction amen but they
[53:45] lost the rights and therefore the book
[53:49] went back to the original owner
[53:53] and that honor was God
[53:56] so the book ended up back in the hands
[53:58] of God John picks it up now and he's
[54:02] showing God sitting the Ancient of Days
[54:05] sitting on a strong with that book which
[54:10] holds the title deed of all the names of
[54:15] those that were to be redeemed were
[54:19] already in that Lamb's Book of Life
[54:23] but the book was now sealed they
[54:28] actually should have it should have been
[54:30] opened back then and then manifested
[54:34] through them but by their unbelief it
[54:39] could not pass their way it had to pass
[54:43] mixed and modeled with all kinds of
[54:45] shocks and cares and everything else it
[54:49] when it should have been a clear stream
[54:52] of only elect by the spoken word of God
[54:57] it ended up with all kinds of serpent
[55:00] seed elected mixed in there because of
[55:05] their Disobedience to the word of God
[55:08] now I know those of you who have been
[55:11] here hearing me preach the word you
[55:13] understand and you should and it's
[55:15] making itself clear to those of you who
[55:17] are just visiting it might sound a
[55:20] little bit like what's he talking about
[55:22] I know uh you're saying that
[55:24] respectfully but that's human because
[55:27] you haven't been here long enough to
[55:30] hear enough to up your understanding but
[55:32] if you are an elected seed of God God
[55:36] will open up that understanding that you
[55:39] might understand the symbols you will
[55:42] understand the Revelation and the
[55:45] opening of the word of God Amen praise
[55:48] God now it went back to God and Satan
[55:52] didn't like that no
[55:54] Satan hated it he felt that he could
[55:58] have captured that book but instead of
[56:01] it being captured God took back the book
[56:05] amen into his hands because he didn't
[56:09] belong to Satan in the first place right
[56:11] because that's what he was actually
[56:13] trying to do with Adam and Eve he was
[56:15] trying to get at the book to capture it
[56:18] right and to take it but it had to go
[56:21] back by God's immutable laws like this
[56:24] universe has lost up something goes up
[56:27] it gotta come down and you don't try to
[56:29] spit in God's face because it's coming
[56:31] back into your face and you know those
[56:34] laws are out there and they just were
[56:37] they just happen to be there right who
[56:41] praise God but praise the Lord thank God
[56:44] while he's sitting on the throne there
[56:48] comes a lamb from out of Eternity
[56:52] and this lamb comes to God
[56:57] and in the description
[56:59] a lamb as it had been slain now in a
[57:04] nice way it's referring to what was
[57:06] going to take place and had taking place
[57:08] on Calvary and here was Jesus a bloody
[57:13] bleeding man or he was the Lamb of God
[57:17] in other words in the Old Testament they
[57:19] killed Bullocks and Rams and dogs and
[57:22] stuff to keep away sin and and the
[57:25] judgments of God but God was saying none
[57:29] of those things are equal to the life of
[57:31] a man there got to be a perfect man that
[57:35] could sacrifice himself for the rest of
[57:37] the human race and we are saying from
[57:40] this Bible Jesus Christ was that man
[57:44] that died in our scared or substitute
[57:47] that took our place at Calgary the judge
[57:51] said hell and he he took our judgment
[57:55] said let it come on me and he took it
[57:58] the Bible said he descended into hell
[58:00] but praise God he rose again
[58:04] Bill couldn't hold him the grave
[58:06] couldn't hold him the prison couldn't
[58:09] hold him nothing could hold him he said
[58:11] destroy this body and I raise it up
[58:15] again in three days foreign
[58:17] [Applause]
[58:20] you see because that was really the same
[58:23] God but he created a body and lived in
[58:26] that body so that he could tell them you
[58:29] do whatever you want with this outside
[58:31] but I'll raise it back up anyway amen
[58:34] praise God so Jesus was not just another
[58:36] Prophet
[58:38] Muhammad you know the roster or one
[58:42] everybody claims they're a great prophet
[58:44] and they have millions of followers
[58:46] behind them but none of them ever died
[58:49] and rose again
[58:51] the only one who did that was Jesus
[58:54] Christ He's Alive forevermore
[58:58] him yesterday today and forever praise
[59:02] God forevermore we serve a living God
[59:05] not a death God buried in some grave we
[59:10] don't serve a God buried in the Bible we
[59:14] serve a living God who steps out from
[59:17] eternity and walks before his people
[59:20] amen praise God hallelujah amen so I
[59:25] want you to know my friends that this
[59:28] bloody lamb
[59:30] was able to contact the book out of the
[59:34] hand of him that was upon the throne
[59:38] because he had control war with Satan he
[59:42] had fought with the devil he had gone to
[59:45] every right that crucified him amen that
[59:50] did everything for him to to stop what
[59:53] he was doing but praise God he endured
[59:57] it until he was able to serve it is
[1:00:00] finished praise God he paid the price
[1:00:03] for every one of us seated here today
[1:00:06] whether we want it or not he paid the
[1:00:09] price
[1:00:10] you got to accept it you got to receive
[1:00:13] it but he paid the price
[1:00:17] like the man that was in prison
[1:00:20] and you know the governor passed into
[1:00:24] the prison
[1:00:26] but the governor dressed like an
[1:00:28] ordinary man
[1:00:29] and came to him and chatted with him and
[1:00:32] after a while he said look I have this
[1:00:34] here for you uh this is a pardon right
[1:00:38] that if you take this before uh another
[1:00:42] judge that's like God giving us a pardon
[1:00:45] and there's an Earthly judge he says
[1:00:47] they'll set you free and all that you
[1:00:50] ever done is passed away and he says no
[1:00:53] way I don't want that piece of garbage I
[1:00:57] don't want a little piece of paper he
[1:00:59] says no it's the truth you will be
[1:01:03] completely pardoned and forgiven if you
[1:01:07] take this up before amen and you know
[1:01:10] what he refused the pardon and even now
[1:01:14] there is a law in the United States our
[1:01:17] pardon is not a pardon unless it is
[1:01:20] accepted as a party
[1:01:24] each word is saying you are pardoned
[1:01:28] you're forgiven
[1:01:30] I don't care what you've done you're
[1:01:32] forgiven
[1:01:34] my you're forgiven but you have got to
[1:01:37] accept the Forgiveness you've got to
[1:01:39] accept the pardon you've got to take it
[1:01:42] and believe it in your heart amen praise
[1:01:45] God that's what he is saying here and he
[1:01:48] died for us and provide us with an open
[1:01:51] door for us to accept his pardon amen
[1:01:56] now we understand that the book that was
[1:02:01] in the hand of the one on the throne
[1:02:04] which the lamb took was the book of
[1:02:08] redemption
[1:02:09] Adam lost it now the lamb takes it
[1:02:13] because now they failed in opening the
[1:02:18] book or exposing it manifesting it so
[1:02:22] now he is coming now to do what they get
[1:02:26] new did not do what they could not do at
[1:02:30] the time that he might start the restart
[1:02:34] or start the process
[1:02:37] of the manifestation of the Sons and
[1:02:41] Daughters of God that should be
[1:02:43] manifested through them they didn't do
[1:02:45] it but now he comes that he might bring
[1:02:47] forth the manifestation of the sons of
[1:02:50] God hallelujah praise God you know all
[1:02:53] my children were in me
[1:02:55] is that right
[1:02:57] but through myself
[1:03:00] and my wife to Adam through Eve every
[1:03:05] son every look there's humans on the
[1:03:08] Earth but amongst them are the sons and
[1:03:12] daughters of God
[1:03:14] you don't know them from the outside but
[1:03:16] from their actions from the things they
[1:03:19] do they rather like Jesus on the cross
[1:03:22] he rather to die so he might save other
[1:03:24] people and they rather to do things for
[1:03:27] other people than to save themselves you
[1:03:30] know them by their Spirit that's in them
[1:03:33] it can't help it because it's the same
[1:03:36] Spirit of Christ it's only a small part
[1:03:39] of that but it's here in another human
[1:03:41] body or many bodies
[1:03:44] and expressing itself to the glory of
[1:03:47] the father hallelujah amen yes sir
[1:03:51] so this book of redemption held the
[1:03:55] names you're following me
[1:03:59] you're understanding some of what I'm
[1:04:01] saying here
[1:04:03] yes
[1:04:05] so this was a book of redemption
[1:04:09] Hallelujah and we want to find out
[1:04:14] what this book of redemption really is
[1:04:19] we want to find out who we are amen
[1:04:26] because the book is opening to expose
[1:04:29] those names and reveal who right who and
[1:04:34] who they are who they really are praise
[1:04:37] God and it will also that book show to
[1:04:41] us why we are here that we might not
[1:04:45] reason why we are here why we can't be
[1:04:48] like other people oh my God I I want to
[1:04:52] do this but like I can't do it I want to
[1:04:55] do that but I can't do it what other
[1:04:57] people just do it easy it don't bother
[1:05:00] them they just go ahead and do it and
[1:05:02] they don't know why they're like that
[1:05:03] but you see you do things from your
[1:05:06] nature from that Soul on the inside and
[1:05:09] that Soul inside of them can only act
[1:05:12] that way but what is in US Heaven you
[1:05:15] can act the way of God they don't know
[1:05:17] nothing else amen once said that that
[1:05:20] way too because he didn't know who it
[1:05:22] was but from the time that begins to
[1:05:24] know who it is it began to act like its
[1:05:28] father and our father is God our
[1:05:31] heavenly father we appreciate you we
[1:05:34] love you we adore you we bow down before
[1:05:38] you amen because he is our heavenly
[1:05:41] father praise God we didn't come from
[1:05:43] Earth
[1:05:44] we come from Glory
[1:05:48] we didn't come out of time we're living
[1:05:50] in time but we're going back to Eternity
[1:05:53] where we come from
[1:05:55] that's the reason we die physically here
[1:05:58] but upset from the body present with the
[1:06:02] Lord within his presence walking in the
[1:06:04] light as he is in the light glory to God
[1:06:07] hallelujah amen also when this book
[1:06:11] begins to open itself to you you begin
[1:06:14] to understand what is happening now
[1:06:20] you understand you start to understand
[1:06:23] how modern events can be made clear by
[1:06:28] this ancient book by prophecy
[1:06:31] prophets spoke all these things before
[1:06:33] but when they read the Bible with no
[1:06:36] understanding of course they don't oh
[1:06:38] here is Daniel speaking and it shall
[1:06:41] come to pass in the last days there
[1:06:44] shall be chariots running in the
[1:06:47] highways and the by the words is in the
[1:06:50] Bible
[1:06:51] you understand some of them wise men
[1:06:54] usually come back and say but wait a
[1:06:55] minute if we hadn't known this we would
[1:06:58] have you already tell you they're going
[1:07:00] to be highways and they're going to be
[1:07:02] chariots you see those men didn't know
[1:07:06] what to call a plane they didn't know
[1:07:09] what this when they saw cars they
[1:07:11] couldn't they couldn't describe it so
[1:07:13] they used the fastest thing that they
[1:07:16] knew then you know he said I'll I'll
[1:07:19] bring you back to your land of Israel on
[1:07:21] the wings of some great eagles flying
[1:07:25] was planes but they didn't they couldn't
[1:07:28] describe it right because there was
[1:07:30] nothing like that at the time now he's
[1:07:32] his cars he says on these chariots well
[1:07:36] amen well be moving swifted on horses
[1:07:40] and they will they will be jamming up
[1:07:43] each other in the streets you're talking
[1:07:45] about traffic jams and all of that and
[1:07:48] he says and they will have two large
[1:07:50] eyes brighter than the eyes of dragons
[1:07:54] is is your car lights he was seeing all
[1:07:57] of it thousands of years ago and telling
[1:08:01] them another one said give the winds a
[1:08:03] mighty voice they find out of radio and
[1:08:06] so on so on speaks about rockets and
[1:08:09] everything else but praise God
[1:08:12] hallelujah we by the word it makes you
[1:08:16] know what is happening now
[1:08:19] you know when uh when a righteous is not
[1:08:24] a righteous man but when a religious
[1:08:27] personality goes out there and said it's
[1:08:30] time for us to write a new Ten
[1:08:33] Commandments
[1:08:35] and Gathering all the leaders of the
[1:08:38] major churches
[1:08:40] and they are going to study and with
[1:08:43] their wisdom the old Ten Commandments
[1:08:48] this is a modern time that was for back
[1:08:51] then when they were in the wilderness
[1:08:53] but we are in a modern society and we
[1:08:56] need a new set of Ten Commandments
[1:09:00] and we are going to study it and when we
[1:09:03] when we put that out and the world will
[1:09:06] know really what they should believe now
[1:09:10] this is on the internet if you can look
[1:09:11] for it you'll find it and you know what
[1:09:14] they're being going up to Mount Sinai
[1:09:18] just like Moses did and I was there and
[1:09:22] there's a picture of one of the past
[1:09:24] Popes with his staff looking over into
[1:09:27] the promised land and they take a
[1:09:28] picture of him as he's looking over and
[1:09:31] my friends they are about to do that now
[1:09:35] but they are not going to come down from
[1:09:38] sanyi with their new Ten Commandments
[1:09:43] however we have got to see all these
[1:09:46] things happening so when it happens we
[1:09:49] know why it's happening what's the
[1:09:52] reason for what's going on in the world
[1:09:54] that's why we're not troubled we're not
[1:09:55] worried day-to-day life you have your
[1:09:58] little ins and outs but in the midst of
[1:10:00] it the overall picture you know where
[1:10:02] the whole thing is headed
[1:10:04] amen praise God hallelujah amen praise
[1:10:08] the Lord and I thank God for Revelation
[1:10:10] don't you
[1:10:12] I thank God for revelation because you
[1:10:15] know each Revelation you receive is
[1:10:18] taking you deeper and deeper into the
[1:10:21] rapture
[1:10:22] every Revelation you'll get is like a
[1:10:25] stone building on another Stone building
[1:10:27] on and also it's taking you deeper and
[1:10:29] deeper right into the Rapture Hallelujah
[1:10:33] and while it's taken us deeper into the
[1:10:36] Rapture it means that he is coming down
[1:10:39] and drawing near because we are supposed
[1:10:42] to meet him in the air praise God not
[1:10:46] mean just the natural atmosphere here
[1:10:48] but in the other dimensions is where we
[1:10:51] are going to meet him praise God
[1:10:53] hallelujah praise the Lord God
[1:10:55] hallelujah amen thank you Lord Jesus
[1:10:58] amen now Revelation 10 1-4
[1:11:03] that speaks about the seven Thunders
[1:11:07] the mighty angel coming down
[1:11:10] and one foot on the land and put one on
[1:11:13] the sea raise his hands to have one hand
[1:11:16] to heaven and in the other hand is the
[1:11:20] book that was in the hand of the one who
[1:11:23] was on the throne is now in the hand of
[1:11:26] this Mighty Angel but it's no more
[1:11:28] closed it is now open
[1:11:32] one hand with the book open the other
[1:11:35] one Reigns to heaven
[1:11:37] and the Bible says he shouted with a
[1:11:40] loud voice
[1:11:41] amen time shall be no more well a lot of
[1:11:46] people thought that meant the world is
[1:11:48] going to end but that's not what he's
[1:11:50] saying there was going to be seven ages
[1:11:54] of the church the church will go through
[1:11:56] seven phases and at the end of that time
[1:11:59] for that process will be over
[1:12:03] that is what he was talking about then
[1:12:06] that's where come all these
[1:12:07] misconceptions and things where I would
[1:12:09] say this over here and says that over
[1:12:11] there and so on and comes all these
[1:12:13] things because they have no
[1:12:14] understanding of what really was taking
[1:12:17] place
[1:12:18] well that angel Mighty angel with a
[1:12:23] rainbow around his head and for those of
[1:12:26] you know already but for those who need
[1:12:29] to know I have to repeat myself this
[1:12:31] Mighty Angel is really the Lord Jesus
[1:12:35] Christ himself
[1:12:36] thank you
[1:12:38] for the rainbow around his head is
[1:12:41] typical of the Covenant angel
[1:12:44] right a covenant Angel we have an
[1:12:48] eternal Covenant excuse me
[1:12:51] but this Angel was the Lord himself
[1:12:55] in the form of a messenger or angel
[1:12:59] coming down to the Earth and Revelation
[1:13:02] 10 says that he comes to heaven
[1:13:06] and he speaks or uses a revelation 10 7
[1:13:14] amen the messenger to the seventh Church
[1:13:17] age the last Church age which is why we
[1:13:22] are so excited praise God because we
[1:13:25] know we have come out of we've just come
[1:13:27] out of that and we know the messenger
[1:13:31] was whom we call Brother William Mary
[1:13:34] and Bradham
[1:13:35] we don't deify him we don't worship Him
[1:13:38] his brother William Branham God just
[1:13:43] used him but what God used him to do was
[1:13:46] catch the mystery catch the Revelation
[1:13:49] the what was in that book and then to
[1:13:53] bring it to us not he the man but making
[1:13:58] himself available that God could come
[1:14:00] and teach the world through him
[1:14:04] through him
[1:14:06] until even one time he's standing there
[1:14:08] preaching and suddenly a voice speaks
[1:14:10] out this is not William Branham
[1:14:14] William Branham has only loaned me his
[1:14:18] body
[1:14:19] amen I am the Lord calm down
[1:14:23] and continue to speak you see God was
[1:14:26] using Brother Branham as the voice as
[1:14:30] his voice to the edge like God you needs
[1:14:34] your hand to do good it is your feet to
[1:14:36] go and do missions he needs your heart
[1:14:38] to love you see he needs us so he needed
[1:14:42] to have a prophet
[1:14:44] amen that he might speak true to bring
[1:14:48] his word to a sinful dying generation
[1:14:53] The Voice speaks to the prophet the
[1:14:57] spirit of God speaks to a prophet
[1:14:59] prophet of predestinator prepared
[1:15:02] individual or Amen to be in this age and
[1:15:05] time for him to use for his glory amen
[1:15:09] hallelujah amen and so when the angel
[1:15:13] came down he cried and the Bible said
[1:15:15] his voice sounded like seven Thunders
[1:15:19] and the Seven you heard the Thunder that
[1:15:22] was rolling in Buffalo there and you saw
[1:15:25] the snow that was coming down amen you
[1:15:29] hear the thunder crack I don't care who
[1:15:31] you are a certain amount of thunder you
[1:15:34] can take but if it really goes I don't
[1:15:36] care who you are you're gonna suddenly
[1:15:38] stop amen that's why David said that the
[1:15:42] voice of God thundering it break at the
[1:15:45] cedars in Lebanon it met the mountains
[1:15:48] tremble amen the voice of God hallelujah
[1:15:52] does something in every age amen praise
[1:15:56] God because those Thunders they sounded
[1:16:00] like Sanders but listen what the Bible
[1:16:02] says John heard what
[1:16:06] it was saying
[1:16:09] that means that in the middle of all
[1:16:11] that thundering and it looks like a mass
[1:16:12] of confusion he heard a voice
[1:16:16] he heard something that he could
[1:16:17] understand
[1:16:19] or else he wouldn't say let me write
[1:16:21] this down and then the boy says no
[1:16:23] this is not for to be written down you
[1:16:27] can't write it amen and this is why we
[1:16:30] try to tell people the Bible is written
[1:16:33] yeah you can go by this and just read
[1:16:35] everything on it and you should amen but
[1:16:39] like every public speaker knows it's not
[1:16:43] just the written word it's the nuances
[1:16:46] if the on the currents of what whether
[1:16:49] the person that why why
[1:16:52] you did that just one turn on the word
[1:16:56] changes the meaning and so on like that
[1:16:58] it's that part that's why the Bible
[1:17:01] tells us there is the Rhema
[1:17:03] and there is the logos
[1:17:06] the Rhema is what you can read and then
[1:17:09] that's why we tell you see you could be
[1:17:11] a theologian and all that means is you
[1:17:13] got lots of intelligence
[1:17:15] is that right and that is not what God
[1:17:18] is talking about
[1:17:20] the low ghost is the spiritual intent is
[1:17:25] the spiritual the Unseen meanings of the
[1:17:29] word when a word is spoken there's so
[1:17:31] much is conveyed out of a word not by
[1:17:35] reading the writing but receiving what
[1:17:38] the Bible tells us is the revelation
[1:17:42] upon which Jesus says I'm not going to
[1:17:45] build my church on the sinking Sands of
[1:17:48] constant changes in translation
[1:17:50] but I built my Church on the Rock of
[1:17:54] Revelation from the word of God
[1:17:57] hallelujah and that is what he is
[1:17:59] building his church on people are who
[1:18:03] are able to read between the lines
[1:18:07] people who to catch the supernatural
[1:18:11] meaning of the word of the Living God
[1:18:16] so I'm trying to make the point John
[1:18:18] heard the same Thunders everybody else
[1:18:21] heard
[1:18:22] but to them it was not intelligible if
[1:18:26] there was anybody else there but to him
[1:18:28] he clearly understood what it was saying
[1:18:30] and he wanted to go write it down and
[1:18:36] the same boy says no
[1:18:38] don't break it down John you don't want
[1:18:41] to write it but I want you to seal it
[1:18:44] seal up their understanding
[1:18:47] seal up their minds
[1:18:49] they can read it but they won't
[1:18:50] understand it until
[1:18:53] this seven Angel comes that I can use
[1:18:56] and then those seals gonna be broke and
[1:19:00] then their understanding will start to
[1:19:02] open up then the Revelation begins to
[1:19:05] start going out but it's going back out
[1:19:07] now because now he's coming again but
[1:19:11] this time he's coming for them names
[1:19:13] that were in that book
[1:19:16] coming for the elect and he knows the
[1:19:18] world has got billions of people but
[1:19:21] there is a uh some of his own scattered
[1:19:24] amongst them and when this begins to
[1:19:27] break and the Unseen revelation of the
[1:19:31] word begins to go forth he knows that
[1:19:35] only the elector the ones that he has
[1:19:39] chosen with that kind of equality and
[1:19:42] ability given to them by himself there
[1:19:46] will be the only ones that will be able
[1:19:50] to recognize receive it within their
[1:19:53] hearts and the change by your praise be
[1:19:55] to God Amen aren't you glad you are one
[1:19:58] of them
[1:20:00] I'm one of them nobody can sing that
[1:20:03] song right now I'm one of them
[1:20:06] I'm one of them
[1:20:08] I'm one of them
[1:20:11] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[1:20:16] them
[1:20:17] I'm one of them Holy Ghost people one of
[1:20:21] them I'm so glad
[1:20:24] that I can say I'm one of them
[1:20:28] hallelujah
[1:20:30] amen seal it up till the last days and
[1:20:35] when the seventh angel comes on the
[1:20:38] scene Hallelujah he will reveal or make
[1:20:42] known those Mysteries praise the Lord
[1:20:45] amen so you understand there quickly
[1:20:48] have passed us it was the seven Thunders
[1:20:52] that were sealed up
[1:20:53] when you say the word was sealed up it's
[1:20:56] not just this written it's the seven
[1:20:59] Thunders that was sealed up in there
[1:21:02] praise God which he couldn't understand
[1:21:04] and could not receive whatsoever praise
[1:21:08] the Lord Brother Branham explained this
[1:21:10] what's a seal
[1:21:12] a seal is like when you have the the
[1:21:16] um the train cars carrying grain or
[1:21:19] carrying goods the inspector comes and
[1:21:24] puts a seal on that door it might be
[1:21:28] able to lead or some other thing but
[1:21:30] he'll put a seal and they have something
[1:21:32] when they press it it has the back then
[1:21:36] it used to have the Queen's crown on it
[1:21:39] the strong property
[1:21:41] and it's sealed off nobody should open
[1:21:44] that seal whatsoever because it's sealed
[1:21:48] up in the boxcar amen but I thank God
[1:21:52] that uh you don't open the boxcar until
[1:21:56] you want to see what's in it
[1:21:58] you want to know what's inside you can
[1:22:02] walk around it and walk around it and
[1:22:05] study every wheel and every board trying
[1:22:08] to guess at what's in it but until the
[1:22:12] door is open to you you don't know
[1:22:14] anything
[1:22:15] you're guessing you're just having
[1:22:18] educated guesses amen praise God they
[1:22:22] are that's why they call themselves
[1:22:23] professors
[1:22:26] you're professional
[1:22:29] but you really don't know
[1:22:31] you're just making an educated guess
[1:22:34] and then you call it uh you're a
[1:22:36] professor see that's what it really is
[1:22:39] it's that that's not just making fun of
[1:22:42] that but I'm doing it that way that you
[1:22:44] might understand clearly what it is is
[1:22:47] that right oh my just like a doctor a
[1:22:50] doctors don't really heal nothing
[1:22:52] yeah amen doctors only treat
[1:22:56] they have to wait on God to heal
[1:22:59] they might have to use the right of
[1:23:01] medicine or herb or whatever but
[1:23:04] whenever you are finished only God can
[1:23:08] do the healing
[1:23:09] [Applause]
[1:23:11] there can't do nothing
[1:23:13] they are there for the purpose of being
[1:23:16] able to advise you what is the best
[1:23:19] medication you can use to bring about
[1:23:22] your healing but they only remember this
[1:23:25] they only can treat
[1:23:28] they cannot heal
[1:23:30] and the higher up you go and you ask one
[1:23:33] of them they will tell you that's the
[1:23:35] truth I can only do my best and then
[1:23:38] after that you just they're going right
[1:23:40] back to prayer pray to God
[1:23:43] that you will start getting better
[1:23:45] because they have to wait for God to
[1:23:47] heal because that's the way it is amen
[1:23:51] praise God well it's the same thing with
[1:23:53] the Bible
[1:23:54] the Bible has been sealed and it's been
[1:23:59] sealed by Roman seals were put on our
[1:24:03] Bible
[1:24:04] look when I was a kid and I bought one
[1:24:08] of those Bibles to hold for Keepsake a
[1:24:11] big sick Bible like that
[1:24:13] some of them used to have a padlock on
[1:24:16] it
[1:24:17] and before the priest goes up there and
[1:24:20] I was a Catholic going to Saint Aloysius
[1:24:23] RC when I was just a kid
[1:24:26] and they had to open that Bible like
[1:24:29] Mysteries mysterious and fear on the
[1:24:32] people and when they roll it back nobody
[1:24:35] used to read it only the priests can
[1:24:37] read it and then they will read from
[1:24:40] this mysterious book here and the lesson
[1:24:43] close the book put back the lock on it
[1:24:46] that's the way it is you see it was
[1:24:48] sealed from 325 Eddie it was sealed with
[1:24:54] a Roman seal upon it praise God not
[1:24:58] literal padlock but the minds and hearts
[1:25:02] were padlocked by these Spirits from
[1:25:05] Babylon that's why the Bible calls that
[1:25:08] Spirit mystery Babylon the mother of
[1:25:11] harlots amen yes sir so so the minds of
[1:25:15] the people were sealed by and then see
[1:25:18] that's where the devil's smart he makes
[1:25:20] up false religion under the same thing
[1:25:24] with the true revelation of the word of
[1:25:26] God because everybody call themselves
[1:25:27] Christian everybody going to a church
[1:25:29] everybody doing this but everyone but
[1:25:32] one is acting out what Satan is
[1:25:34] influencing them to do and one is living
[1:25:36] by the word because they caught a
[1:25:39] revelation of that word amen praise the
[1:25:42] name of the Living God hallelujah well
[1:25:45] you know the Bible is really what he was
[1:25:47] referring to that is really God's boxcar
[1:25:52] and there was this Roman shield on the
[1:25:56] boxcar and the boxcar now that they yeah
[1:26:01] they had there had to be opened up amen
[1:26:04] they couldn't understand it praise the
[1:26:06] Lord but thank God the prophet broke the
[1:26:09] seal and opened up the Lord
[1:26:11] glory to God and while I'm here I'll
[1:26:14] just take a moment to show you what he
[1:26:17] did naturally was already done if you go
[1:26:20] back and look in the uh Matthew and Luke
[1:26:22] you will find the Bible says when Jesus
[1:26:25] body was placed in the Tomb that it came
[1:26:28] to pass an angel descended from heaven
[1:26:32] like a bolt of lightning and rolled away
[1:26:36] the stone
[1:26:37] amen and Jesus stepped out amen rolled
[1:26:41] away the stone this is what we're
[1:26:43] talking that angel moved what the Roman
[1:26:46] seal
[1:26:47] amen that's what they moved he moved
[1:26:50] away the Romans seal so that the word
[1:26:54] could come into Berlin View
[1:26:57] that the people then could have an
[1:26:59] unveiling of the Mighty God now in our
[1:27:03] time it's not a rock it's not a stone
[1:27:05] and I'm going to go back by the by that
[1:27:08] same place and Joseph of our matthia's
[1:27:10] garden where the tomb was and is still
[1:27:13] is and see it but nothing is there his
[1:27:16] body isn't there just seeing the scenery
[1:27:19] of what is there but the fact is that
[1:27:22] big rock that was there with the Roman
[1:27:26] seal on it sealed up the tomb and
[1:27:28] soldiers and all to protect it
[1:27:29] theologians and so on protecting it you
[1:27:32] see the angel rolled all of it away and
[1:27:36] the soldiers all ran away for fear amen
[1:27:40] just like brother Branham came with the
[1:27:42] word now and spiritually now they were
[1:27:46] so fearful of that Ministry because of
[1:27:50] the power because of the demonstrations
[1:27:53] because of the spirit of God working
[1:27:55] through him or praise God hallelujah
[1:27:59] when a man is going to stand up and tell
[1:28:02] you please mainly amen yes I see a boy
[1:28:06] it's not here it's ins it's in Sweden uh
[1:28:11] nearer there I see him dead and God
[1:28:15] shows me that he will live again
[1:28:19] and you know many years after he ended
[1:28:22] up going there for meetings and while
[1:28:24] they're driving him to the meeting a car
[1:28:27] knocked down a little boy in the street
[1:28:29] and he he steps out of the cart and when
[1:28:32] he says but I've seen the scene before
[1:28:35] he says look in your Bible because I
[1:28:37] told you all to write this down and
[1:28:39] there is the same scenery written in
[1:28:41] their Bibles
[1:28:43] he says you see why I have confidence
[1:28:46] he just walked up to the boy lay his
[1:28:49] hands and the boy jumped up picked up
[1:28:51] his bicycle right away he didn't say
[1:28:53] thank you or nothing he said jump on the
[1:28:55] bus little boy right off like that
[1:28:58] praise God you see but all those things
[1:29:02] they just can't understand it all
[1:29:06] Robert's all of them they get them
[1:29:07] meeting and maybe in the meeting they
[1:29:09] have four or five people come up and
[1:29:11] pray for them and they get well
[1:29:13] this man stands in a meeting every night
[1:29:16] thousands
[1:29:18] some of them just get off the train
[1:29:21] station miles away from where he is
[1:29:24] and just to get off the train and they
[1:29:26] walk in towards him the cancer drop off
[1:29:30] he's not there
[1:29:32] but what's happening but that's what
[1:29:34] used to happen that's why T.L Osborne
[1:29:36] said
[1:29:38] this was not just a man
[1:29:41] this has to be God working through a man
[1:29:45] if God using a man amen Mike and he says
[1:29:50] even though I'm preaching I'm telling
[1:29:53] you long after I'm gone I quoted that
[1:29:55] just the other night where he said long
[1:29:58] after I'm gone you're gonna find out
[1:30:00] these things I'm telling you are the
[1:30:02] truth just say it the Lord
[1:30:04] [Music]
[1:30:05] that man would stand in front of
[1:30:08] thousands of people turn his back he
[1:30:11] says you don't believe
[1:30:13] he turned us back and then you'll say
[1:30:16] there's a woman up there in this aisle

[1:30:23] and what she has come here for is about
