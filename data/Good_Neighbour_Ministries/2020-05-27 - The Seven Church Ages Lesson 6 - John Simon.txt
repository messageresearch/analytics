 Good evening, friends AN EXPOSITION OF THE SEVEN CHURCH AGES
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good evening friends it's good to be here with you to share with you the wonderful words of life may God bless each and every one maybe you read from the scriptures John chapter 14 verses 25 to 26 in another lesson on the seven church ages these things have I spoken unto you being yet present with you but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you our gracious Heavenly Father we ask your divine blessing upon this bread of life as we receive it with thankful hearts in Jesus name Amen and amen well friends no man no matter how wise how learn it he is how intelligent how smart he is how intellectually wonderful he is no man knows the things of God save the Spirit of God for known only to him are the great hidden secrets and again who by searching can find out God only he to whom the Spirit well revealed it took we need to call in God therefore not depend on the great academia of men upon the tea ologies of men their variants various presumptions of man or propounded principles of men though they may be good but let every man's work be a lie God says and my word must be the truth the very anchor of your soul they rock of your salvation so we have accepted the Bible and we have accepted the great truths of the Bible but it is still not real too many people who are confused and this is because of the lack of revelation the revelation by the Holy Spirit is not there and the word in them has not been quickened for his name if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again the rain of the Holy Spirit will germinated and bring the seeds of God to God's Word into life now friends almost all Bible students believe that our New Testament was written originally in the Greek language also all Bible students agree that God gave us three great nations the Greeks who gave us a universal language the Jews who gave us true religion and true knowledge of one God through our Savior the Lord Jesus Christ the Romans who gave us unified Empire government law and a system of unparalleled highways and thus from the contributions to to our faith and to Christianity these three great nations have helped us to grasp the Word of God now we find friends the Romans gave us a unified Empire as we have said and the roads with which to spread the gospel everywhere the Greeks gave us a universal language by which the Word of God could be communicated and so the Jews they gave us the greatest of all true religion and true knowledge and understanding wisdom of one God which I believe came through Jesus Christ our Savior now historically that seems to be about right that seems to be about correct and today's our Greek scholars say that the Greek language of the Bible days was so perfect an exact that if a student of Greek is refined and curate very knowledgeable and if he isn't accurate romera he can truly know what the scripture especially of the New Testament in the word is teaching now that's wonderful to hear that but is that really true we know that when two Bible eminent by the scholars of two different denominations get together let's say for a debate over any minor thing in the Word of God or major thing in the Word of God you cannot get them to agree that's the reason why there 2 or 3 or 3,000 various denominations all because of this fact they're words based on the exact and identical words of the Greek language and grammar and they still disagree and that's just the way that it is I tell you friends I'm sure that we can see that there is some kind of a conflict there now prior to the Nicean council of 325 AD there were two great students of the word of god one by the name of areas and the other one as a nation and they became locked in doctrinal battle doctrinal combat over a greek word okay of course the argument really at that time was over one God versus trinitarianism we will not get into at this time but the fact is to great evidence scholars were in debate over greek of one understanding one word in greek and that caused a split and a division over the entire world now if greek is or what's so perfect and so ordained of God why was there such a dispute for God hates division I'm sure my friends God did never did not and never has intended for all of us to know Greek so that we can know the Bible or perfectly understand what the Bible is really saying or even to know Latin from the Romans or all of us to know Hebrew so that we can all understand the Bible on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit fell every nation under the Sun regardless of what language they spoke they all heard the voice of God and when the voice of God speaks through the Holy Spirit it's universal it has nothing to do with languages nothing of the sort it has to do with revelation and understanding wisdom given by the holy spirit alone parts not my mental might of human beings amen nor by the great acumen or power but by the Spirit of the Living God is the Word of God revealed thanks be to God now my friends let us step just a little further today we have students who claim it really wasn't Greek because Jesus in his day spoke the language of the of the street people of the ordinary people just the regular language spoken on the street about foxes and about a fig tree or or some commonplace thing and they are saying that it was a great ring it was our make so so so it was just the language that was spoken by the regular person and we have many students like that and our historians even at the present times are divided over that fact now we know that there one was one called dr. Lanza and he was very convinced that the New Testament was written in ink in Aramaic he was backed up by T on me that this was written in Aramaic and not Greek all my friends don't you see right there this division again not Greek it was written in our mate and then they contend then later in Greek my friends Bible scholars splitting hairs over words and grammar and to this very present day we as the Church of the Living God in the last days are divided another group of these scholars as I've for said believes that it was written in the Aramaic language of the common people and so we find theologian seminarians we find all of these great the translators and scholars are fighting and debating each other over which is the purest language to convey or in which the Word of God or the understanding of the Word of God was relieved was it Greek was it Latin was it Aramaic what was it I believe that language was the universal language of the voice of God in these last days that whenever God speaks his words are universal and never mind a language that tongues the translations the voice of the Spirit goes to the heart to the crutches and inside the innate seed life of that man that gene life of that man or that woman will understand for my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow but they will recognize the voice of their Savior God Shepherd lead to leading them calling out to them guiding them by his blessed Holy Spirit praise God so we can see we cannot base our understanding and interpretation of the word of God and base it upon the profound knowledge of great students of the language of the Bible of what it was written in know absolutely you see because you can read the Bible you can know Greek know all this language but once you are veiled in your mind you will not recognize God speaking through the word and the God you seek and that God you try to serve we'll be miss understood and he will be unrecognized and he's the one that must be reveal himself in and through his own words now think about it let us go back in time go back to the times of Jesus when there were candles in the street donkeys industry goats and sheep and travelers in their Eastern garments shrugging through the streets that that the call cry at the bazaars that were nearby and Jesus lived in such an environment the Pharisees were there the Sadducees Epicureans the Stoics others The Libertines they were all there at that particular time and that age of which we are speaking but amongst them it is understood that the Jewish Pharisees and Sadducees were the most eminent scholars and knowledgeable of the Word of God no we must we must grasp this my friends if anyone was to understand what language it was written in it was they it was the Pharisees and the Sadducees they would have known because that was their time that was the language or languages that they understood clearly for the award of most eminent for their day and for their time so they knew in 33 AD the exact meaning of the words the exact grammars that were supposed to be used every song that would be there there would be familiar ways better than anyone in our day and yet they miss August the Word of God for their day the Word made flesh we see clearly here they missed the revelation of God's Word made manifested in the flesh because there he was open the world was open for them to see and yet they were blinded to the very presence of the Word of God which was in the beginning and which was God and our word was made flesh and they did not recognize who he was just as much that it changed from flesh form first from spirit form in the flesh warm and now in the word form and what I am seeing is that just as much as they did not recognize the very word that was in flesh form they did not recognize the very God that they worship the very Bible the very Psalms they were reading from my God my God why hast thou forsaken me oh you see my bones how they're showing true and and various other parts of the various scriptures that did not recognize that it was speaking of him the word that did not recognize the word for their day now that word replete tell tells us clearly that he was going back to God went back to spirit form but I wouldn't leave you I'll come back to you which we understand to be in the form of the Holy Spirit same God and he is here with us in the form of Holy Spirit amen to quicken his word for the people are looking at the Bible and scrapping around like hands in the chicken yard trying to peck a little here and back a little there they're human miniscule wisdom of 40 50 70 80 even a hundred years against a God an eternal God and his unfathomable mind oh my god don't you see clearly no man no woman get by searching can find out God and only to wound the Holy Spirit of God will reveal it knowledge wisdom reading learning is is wonderful and it's great and we should have it but our dependency is not upon these things amen but upon the great Holy Spirit to open up and to reveal the Word of God to us so not by man's profound knowledge but by the revelation of the Holy Spirit making himself known now we know that God through the centuries through the eons of trained God has been trained to reveal himself to man and he tried to make himself known to them that he was this coming the scientists coming Savior this seed of the woman that he was going to come into flesh pass through a woman and be here upon the earth and from Genesis to Malachi through signs through pipes through symbols shadows he tried to make himself known and many whole chapters in our Bible especially in the Old Testament pointed clearly to him and the Pharisees who were students of the Bible so clear-headed so wonderful marvelous and to this day their generations are the top scholars in wisdom and knowledge in the world it was said of these Jewish Pharisees that they could take a pin or something sharp and stick it through the Torah and from the verse that they were reading on the top page they could tell you every other verse right to the bottom of that pin of what was said within those scriptures they were that eminent intellectual and sharp in their knowledge and yet they knew or I regardless of our position or Papa you know any of our achievements accomplishments to dare to think we can pit our minds against the mind of the Most High who by searching the scriptures who by searching the things of man can't find out God none but the Spirit of God and to whom he will reveal it clearly friends let us come to a conclusion of this matter because back in those days with the Pharisees and Sadducees only a few had a revelation and the knowledge of who he was and God promised that he would reveal his word just to his faithful few for broad is the way my friends broad that's the way but he asked us to walk in the narrow way and how fear not little flock it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom just a little luck it's been the so in the days of Noah just a few made it in the ark in the days of Moses coming through the wilderness they left two million of them or friends but only two from that original group with a lot of youngsters made it into the Promised Land in the days of Jesus he called out from amongst that generation only about 500 disciples and then John chapter 6 verse 6 to 6 when he told them eat my flesh drink my blood they did not depend on the Holy Spirit of God to fully understand what he was saying and they totally misunderstood him thinking he was asking them to become a cannibal to eat his flesh and drink his blood my friends I tell you and the Bible says they walked no more with him and we know it had to be true about 380 of those 500 disciples because under their Pentecost there was only a hundred and twenty in that Upper Room so me Fred few there be that find it and only a few in the Nate days of Jesus really caught who it was my friends the Shepherd's unto you in the City of David is born a savior which is Christ the Lord of course it was Joseph a very simple humble people that received the revelation and knew who this was BC Zacharias and Elizabeth also had the revelation of who this was and lastly a blind old blind woman and a so-called crackpot old preacher that lived in the temple in the presence of Almighty God and just pushed off to the side saying oh I think this man is saying this the things this woman is saying is it's just off of the norm it's off of the normal things but he knew what he was talking about only those Simeon and Anna Mary and Joseph Zacharias and Elizabeth and the shepherds and later on others began to break into this knowledge of this truth and of this revelation but friends let me say of course we believe in trying to find all this and the best manuscripts to get the best record of the word of God as possible but even if we found that we will never arrive at the real meaning and the true meaning of it by human wisdom knowledge learning understanding we will not get it that way we will not get it by human study we will never get it by Bible studies that's just made up of comparing scriptures with Scripture that is just something of the human mind we need the fertilizing an empowering presence of the Holy Spirit upon our minds and upon the in our hearts friends to refresh the scriptures for us I've said before if the seed be planted the water will germinate and waken up again praise be to God hallelujah it men yes sir so it will take a revelation from God to bring up what exactly the scripture is saying let me read from Paul listen to the upon which things we also speak not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth man's geology man's knowledge he's saying we don't get it that way it's right in your Bible read it for yourself not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth 1st Corinthians chapter 2 verse 50 in our text Jesus made it clear that presently you can't understand but this comforter when he comes he will take the things I have spoken and he will be the teacher he will teach you he will reveal himself to you just miss Lissa this kind of a situation where men and women feel comfortable they feel comfortable in a structured environment to be taught of other men about the God of heaven not realizing that man can't convey to you the depths of God but the deep was called to the deep then the deep will respond it is whom he chooses to draw nigh and approach him and to whom the Holy Spirit of God read revealed himself to the true revelation of course is God interpreting his own word to you by my friends fulfilling and vindicating that which he has promised so the fulfillment of the word is the interpretation of the word oh praise God if this room was dark and I were to say let there be light and all of a sudden something bright comes on and you were never never seen light you never heard of it you don't know what it was yet when it came on and those lights came on you would immediately recognize that that was the interpretation or the vindication of what I just said and that is what is God convey that is what God is conveying to us that when his word is fulfilled it makes itself clear it makes itself crystal clear to any person a simple wayfaring person will understand and will not miss their way whatsoever what we feel our safety in great groups of people studying together we feel comfort in knowing dr. so-and-so and dr. so-and-so said this before and we rely upon that rather than relearning with we have some kind of a complex where we can't rely on God himself revealing and making himself known to us back to the word back to the Bible back to her original faith my friends rest upon the rock revelation upon which he said upon this rock heaven my father in heaven has revealed this on to you amen and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell will not prevail against it praise God don't be misled I believe this Bible is accurate because Jesus completely authenticated this Bible as I Boston and said how that the Lord Jesus authenticated it place the stamp upon it his approval upon it by consistently and constantly saying well did Isaiah say this this is well did Jeremiah say such and such such or as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of lot your father Abraham you see he consistently and constantly vindicated the Scriptures as being his word and as being accurate I believe it was compiled and I believe the New Testament was compiled by a holy men of God anointed moved by the Holy Spirit and is accurate make no mistake about it we have with us already here in our hands the infallible Word of God what I'm talking about this the understanding of that infallible Word the wisdom the knowledge being opened up to us that my friends no man dear add or take away from the Word of God but we need the same Holy Spirit that gave us the word by inspiration to teach us the word by inspiration now if you have a record or a tape or anything digital the very same software by which the thing works or the same speed it has to be quickened by the same speed so that it can produce the voice produce the information whatever it is so men inspired men anointed by the Holy Ghost wrote the word under the guidance from the author who used them ascribes now that same spirit of God must also come again anointing men and women and birthday to reflect and to interpret and place his word for God is his own interpreter and interprets his word true anointed men and women here today all my friends how we need the revelation of the Holy Spirit we really do not need in your translation we have already have dozens and dozens of various translations and there's still a million miles away from cleaner and perfect understanding on the Word of God I'm not against them I use them they're wonderful marvelous indeed my friends some of them even have verses left out some pieces here and there that are left out and so they're good but let's not rely on those things and run after this translation that translation run after this dr. so-and-so run after his knowledge of sin so they're all contributing are contributors indeed my friends but our reliance must be upon the Holy Spirit to interpret what any man even myself included what I am saying what he is saying she is saying or anyone is saying that man's weren't being lying but God's Word must be truth if it in our hearts and within our lives my friends I tell you we need the revelation of the Holy Spirit thank God in this hour we can have what we need if we ask God for knowledge and wisdom he has promised in his word he was not denying my friends wisdom is crying in the streets for the lack of those who want her in their lives revelation is crying for in the streets for the lack of desire for people to receive him or receive it within their heart may God continue by his Spirit to give us continuous life-giving life-giving and life-changing revelation for when revelation true revelation straights your heart it's life-changing and it prevails over every other talk that you might have had any precept you might have learned no matter what man placed upon you the Word of God banishes it away then you can say I could see clearly now the rain is gone I can see all the obstacles in my way the holy spirit has set the bright shining light of his presence and has made clear to me that all things are well by the Holy Spirit I believe friends if we can receive the Word of God within our hearts we can become the living manifestation of the Word of God or the living manifested word for the hour as Jesus wants we can walk in his footsteps and be the living manifested word for this day and for this hour to fulfill Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever blessed be his precious and Holy Name and friends god bless you we've come to the end of this brief study I pray that the Holy Spirit will anchor this within your soul and the Holy Spirit will keep you in the in a very atmosphere of this great haven of rest Heavenly Father we ask your blessing upon this words that the words that were spoken father I can be the voice to speak these words but you must be the one to vindicate and anoint the words we know distance tiny more space has nothing to do with it for you are everywhere whether the person father it is across the sea whether they're in Europe Asia Africa or South America North America Canada United States and they hear these words may your words flash true and faithful may your words turn on the light Lord for the evening lights have come and this we know God and Christ are one to thee be all the glory Father for thine is the kingdom and the power and glory forever ever amen any men God richly bless you my friends until we gather again here on Sunday morning at 11 a.m. to hear the words of God precious wonderful words of life god bless you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen [Music] you [Music]
