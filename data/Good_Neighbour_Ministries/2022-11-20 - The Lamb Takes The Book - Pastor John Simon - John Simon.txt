here today just coming together like this and worshiping God may the Lord bless you as we go into the word of God and today we want to talk about the lamb takes the book and then speaking on this I will reiterate or my reputation some of the things I've already taught and said but it's necessary so that we could as you know the carpenter doesn't hit the nail one time but he clinches it right and repetition is a very useful and important tool that God himself uses he which he said in the word he says the things I'm saying to you repeated to your children your children's children and to your generations and then he will go back and tells you by another Prophet remember I said this over here and this is and he repeats it again it's so that it stays in our hearts it's God planting seeds Seeds of Life praise the Lord and may the Lord bless us this morning of course I again I will not complete this but it lays the foundation so that we can continue on on the next time praise the Lord uh before I go into the word just so that I remind you that I will be leaving for Israel next Sunday uh brother Bill senior and Junior will be coming along with me I understand from the church in Scarborough uh rather Samuel's daughter her family all also going on that trip many others from the United States and maybe other countries so uh we will go there in the land of the Lord and we'll enjoy the people the atmosphere and everything that's there pray for us praise the Lord your Lord will protect and preserve him for us while we are there amen you know there's problems all around the world but that has nothing to do with us God though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death we will fear no evil for thou art with me this is not just a talking this is a fact if you believe it if you don't believe it then of course it's not but if it's a fact praise the Lord so we thank God for that and for every one of you I'll be praying for you you continue to pray for us okay praise God revelation 5. verses 1 to 10. listen and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written I went in and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look there upon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book needed to look Beyond and one of the elders said unto me would not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David has prevailed to open the book and loose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld and law in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders there stood a lamb as it had been slain oh praise God having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four and the four Beeson Four and Twenty Elders who fell down before the lamb having what every one of them harps and golden vials full of orders which are the prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song saying worthy though the word worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us Kings and Priests and we shall reign upon the Earth praise be to God God bless the reading of his word our gracious Heavenly Father we thank you this morning for the privilege of looking into the book we pray your blessing on everyone that hears the word here today May the spirit of almighty God come upon the scene Lord and speak to our hearts not just me standing up here speaking to them they can see me they can hear me but may your voice be heard in every heart May every one be conscious of God his presence and his power and his revealing of his own word for his glory for we ask this in the name of Jesus Christ for the glory of the father amen and amen God bless you please be seated Hallelujah amen we have been given a wonderful scene here in the Bible and the scene that we are seeing is that the great Ancient of Days was sitting on his throne high in the heavens and he had a book within his hand now we know that that book was the book of redemption that he had in his hand this great book of redemption Adam and Eve had lost this book they lost the book they lost their generations of the uh elect which that's all they should have reproduced and they lost the right to have that and to do that and other seed could now pass through them and they found themselves with a hybrid religion a hybrid approach to God mixed Faith with all kinds of stuff mixed in it amen you see so they lost their rights or you would say title they lost their rights to to that book uh for the revealing of that book by God taking that and manifesting it through them through reproduction amen but they lost the rights and therefore the book went back to the original owner and that honor was God so the book ended up back in the hands of God John picks it up now and he's showing God sitting the Ancient of Days sitting on a strong with that book which holds the title deed of all the names of those that were to be redeemed were already in that Lamb's Book of Life but the book was now sealed they actually should have it should have been opened back then and then manifested through them but by their unbelief it could not pass their way it had to pass mixed and modeled with all kinds of shocks and cares and everything else it when it should have been a clear stream of only elect by the spoken word of God it ended up with all kinds of serpent seed elected mixed in there because of their Disobedience to the word of God now I know those of you who have been here hearing me preach the word you understand and you should and it's making itself clear to those of you who are just visiting it might sound a little bit like what's he talking about I know uh you're saying that respectfully but that's human because you haven't been here long enough to hear enough to up your understanding but if you are an elected seed of God God will open up that understanding that you might understand the symbols you will understand the Revelation and the opening of the word of God Amen praise God now it went back to God and Satan didn't like that no Satan hated it he felt that he could have captured that book but instead of it being captured God took back the book amen into his hands because he didn't belong to Satan in the first place right because that's what he was actually trying to do with Adam and Eve he was trying to get at the book to capture it right and to take it but it had to go back by God's immutable laws like this universe has lost up something goes up it gotta come down and you don't try to spit in God's face because it's coming back into your face and you know those laws are out there and they just were they just happen to be there right who praise God but praise the Lord thank God while he's sitting on the throne there comes a lamb from out of Eternity and this lamb comes to God and in the description a lamb as it had been slain now in a nice way it's referring to what was going to take place and had taking place on Calvary and here was Jesus a bloody bleeding man or he was the Lamb of God in other words in the Old Testament they killed Bullocks and Rams and dogs and stuff to keep away sin and and the judgments of God but God was saying none of those things are equal to the life of a man there got to be a perfect man that could sacrifice himself for the rest of the human race and we are saying from this Bible Jesus Christ was that man that died in our scared or substitute that took our place at Calgary the judge said hell and he he took our judgment said let it come on me and he took it the Bible said he descended into hell but praise God he rose again Bill couldn't hold him the grave couldn't hold him the prison couldn't hold him nothing could hold him he said destroy this body and I raise it up again in three days foreign [Applause] you see because that was really the same God but he created a body and lived in that body so that he could tell them you do whatever you want with this outside but I'll raise it back up anyway amen praise God so Jesus was not just another Prophet Muhammad you know the roster or one everybody claims they're a great prophet and they have millions of followers behind them but none of them ever died and rose again the only one who did that was Jesus Christ He's Alive forevermore him yesterday today and forever praise God forevermore we serve a living God not a death God buried in some grave we don't serve a God buried in the Bible we serve a living God who steps out from eternity and walks before his people amen praise God hallelujah amen so I want you to know my friends that this bloody lamb was able to contact the book out of the hand of him that was upon the throne because he had control war with Satan he had fought with the devil he had gone to every right that crucified him amen that did everything for him to to stop what he was doing but praise God he endured it until he was able to serve it is finished praise God he paid the price for every one of us seated here today whether we want it or not he paid the price you got to accept it you got to receive it but he paid the price like the man that was in prison and you know the governor passed into the prison but the governor dressed like an ordinary man and came to him and chatted with him and after a while he said look I have this here for you uh this is a pardon right that if you take this before uh another judge that's like God giving us a pardon and there's an Earthly judge he says they'll set you free and all that you ever done is passed away and he says no way I don't want that piece of garbage I don't want a little piece of paper he says no it's the truth you will be completely pardoned and forgiven if you take this up before amen and you know what he refused the pardon and even now there is a law in the United States our pardon is not a pardon unless it is accepted as a party each word is saying you are pardoned you're forgiven I don't care what you've done you're forgiven my you're forgiven but you have got to accept the Forgiveness you've got to accept the pardon you've got to take it and believe it in your heart amen praise God that's what he is saying here and he died for us and provide us with an open door for us to accept his pardon amen now we understand that the book that was in the hand of the one on the throne which the lamb took was the book of redemption Adam lost it now the lamb takes it because now they failed in opening the book or exposing it manifesting it so now he is coming now to do what they get new did not do what they could not do at the time that he might start the restart or start the process of the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God that should be manifested through them they didn't do it but now he comes that he might bring forth the manifestation of the sons of God hallelujah praise God you know all my children were in me is that right but through myself and my wife to Adam through Eve every son every look there's humans on the Earth but amongst them are the sons and daughters of God you don't know them from the outside but from their actions from the things they do they rather like Jesus on the cross he rather to die so he might save other people and they rather to do things for other people than to save themselves you know them by their Spirit that's in them it can't help it because it's the same Spirit of Christ it's only a small part of that but it's here in another human body or many bodies and expressing itself to the glory of the father hallelujah amen yes sir so this book of redemption held the names you're following me you're understanding some of what I'm saying here yes so this was a book of redemption Hallelujah and we want to find out what this book of redemption really is we want to find out who we are amen because the book is opening to expose those names and reveal who right who and who they are who they really are praise God and it will also that book show to us why we are here that we might not reason why we are here why we can't be like other people oh my God I I want to do this but like I can't do it I want to do that but I can't do it what other people just do it easy it don't bother them they just go ahead and do it and they don't know why they're like that but you see you do things from your nature from that Soul on the inside and that Soul inside of them can only act that way but what is in US Heaven you can act the way of God they don't know nothing else amen once said that that way too because he didn't know who it was but from the time that begins to know who it is it began to act like its father and our father is God our heavenly father we appreciate you we love you we adore you we bow down before you amen because he is our heavenly father praise God we didn't come from Earth we come from Glory we didn't come out of time we're living in time but we're going back to Eternity where we come from that's the reason we die physically here but upset from the body present with the Lord within his presence walking in the light as he is in the light glory to God hallelujah amen also when this book begins to open itself to you you begin to understand what is happening now you understand you start to understand how modern events can be made clear by this ancient book by prophecy prophets spoke all these things before but when they read the Bible with no understanding of course they don't oh here is Daniel speaking and it shall come to pass in the last days there shall be chariots running in the highways and the by the words is in the Bible you understand some of them wise men usually come back and say but wait a minute if we hadn't known this we would have you already tell you they're going to be highways and they're going to be chariots you see those men didn't know what to call a plane they didn't know what this when they saw cars they couldn't they couldn't describe it so they used the fastest thing that they knew then you know he said I'll I'll bring you back to your land of Israel on the wings of some great eagles flying was planes but they didn't they couldn't describe it right because there was nothing like that at the time now he's his cars he says on these chariots well amen well be moving swifted on horses and they will they will be jamming up each other in the streets you're talking about traffic jams and all of that and he says and they will have two large eyes brighter than the eyes of dragons is is your car lights he was seeing all of it thousands of years ago and telling them another one said give the winds a mighty voice they find out of radio and so on so on speaks about rockets and everything else but praise God hallelujah we by the word it makes you know what is happening now you know when uh when a righteous is not a righteous man but when a religious personality goes out there and said it's time for us to write a new Ten Commandments and Gathering all the leaders of the major churches and they are going to study and with their wisdom the old Ten Commandments this is a modern time that was for back then when they were in the wilderness but we are in a modern society and we need a new set of Ten Commandments and we are going to study it and when we when we put that out and the world will know really what they should believe now this is on the internet if you can look for it you'll find it and you know what they're being going up to Mount Sinai just like Moses did and I was there and there's a picture of one of the past Popes with his staff looking over into the promised land and they take a picture of him as he's looking over and my friends they are about to do that now but they are not going to come down from sanyi with their new Ten Commandments however we have got to see all these things happening so when it happens we know why it's happening what's the reason for what's going on in the world that's why we're not troubled we're not worried day-to-day life you have your little ins and outs but in the midst of it the overall picture you know where the whole thing is headed amen praise God hallelujah amen praise the Lord and I thank God for Revelation don't you I thank God for revelation because you know each Revelation you receive is taking you deeper and deeper into the rapture every Revelation you'll get is like a stone building on another Stone building on and also it's taking you deeper and deeper right into the Rapture Hallelujah and while it's taken us deeper into the Rapture it means that he is coming down and drawing near because we are supposed to meet him in the air praise God not mean just the natural atmosphere here but in the other dimensions is where we are going to meet him praise God hallelujah praise the Lord God hallelujah amen thank you Lord Jesus amen now Revelation 10 1-4 that speaks about the seven Thunders the mighty angel coming down and one foot on the land and put one on the sea raise his hands to have one hand to heaven and in the other hand is the book that was in the hand of the one who was on the throne is now in the hand of this Mighty Angel but it's no more closed it is now open one hand with the book open the other one Reigns to heaven and the Bible says he shouted with a loud voice amen time shall be no more well a lot of people thought that meant the world is going to end but that's not what he's saying there was going to be seven ages of the church the church will go through seven phases and at the end of that time for that process will be over that is what he was talking about then that's where come all these misconceptions and things where I would say this over here and says that over there and so on and comes all these things because they have no understanding of what really was taking place well that angel Mighty angel with a rainbow around his head and for those of you know already but for those who need to know I have to repeat myself this Mighty Angel is really the Lord Jesus Christ himself thank you for the rainbow around his head is typical of the Covenant angel right a covenant Angel we have an eternal Covenant excuse me but this Angel was the Lord himself in the form of a messenger or angel coming down to the Earth and Revelation 10 says that he comes to heaven and he speaks or uses a revelation 10 7 amen the messenger to the seventh Church age the last Church age which is why we are so excited praise God because we know we have come out of we've just come out of that and we know the messenger was whom we call Brother William Mary and Bradham we don't deify him we don't worship Him his brother William Branham God just used him but what God used him to do was catch the mystery catch the Revelation the what was in that book and then to bring it to us not he the man but making himself available that God could come and teach the world through him through him until even one time he's standing there preaching and suddenly a voice speaks out this is not William Branham William Branham has only loaned me his body amen I am the Lord calm down and continue to speak you see God was using Brother Branham as the voice as his voice to the edge like God you needs your hand to do good it is your feet to go and do missions he needs your heart to love you see he needs us so he needed to have a prophet amen that he might speak true to bring his word to a sinful dying generation The Voice speaks to the prophet the spirit of God speaks to a prophet prophet of predestinator prepared individual or Amen to be in this age and time for him to use for his glory amen hallelujah amen and so when the angel came down he cried and the Bible said his voice sounded like seven Thunders and the Seven you heard the Thunder that was rolling in Buffalo there and you saw the snow that was coming down amen you hear the thunder crack I don't care who you are a certain amount of thunder you can take but if it really goes I don't care who you are you're gonna suddenly stop amen that's why David said that the voice of God thundering it break at the cedars in Lebanon it met the mountains tremble amen the voice of God hallelujah does something in every age amen praise God because those Thunders they sounded like Sanders but listen what the Bible says John heard what it was saying that means that in the middle of all that thundering and it looks like a mass of confusion he heard a voice he heard something that he could understand or else he wouldn't say let me write this down and then the boy says no this is not for to be written down you can't write it amen and this is why we try to tell people the Bible is written yeah you can go by this and just read everything on it and you should amen but like every public speaker knows it's not just the written word it's the nuances if the on the currents of what whether the person that why why you did that just one turn on the word changes the meaning and so on like that it's that part that's why the Bible tells us there is the Rhema and there is the logos the Rhema is what you can read and then that's why we tell you see you could be a theologian and all that means is you got lots of intelligence is that right and that is not what God is talking about the low ghost is the spiritual intent is the spiritual the Unseen meanings of the word when a word is spoken there's so much is conveyed out of a word not by reading the writing but receiving what the Bible tells us is the revelation upon which Jesus says I'm not going to build my church on the sinking Sands of constant changes in translation but I built my Church on the Rock of Revelation from the word of God hallelujah and that is what he is building his church on people are who are able to read between the lines people who to catch the supernatural meaning of the word of the Living God so I'm trying to make the point John heard the same Thunders everybody else heard but to them it was not intelligible if there was anybody else there but to him he clearly understood what it was saying and he wanted to go write it down and the same boy says no don't break it down John you don't want to write it but I want you to seal it seal up their understanding seal up their minds they can read it but they won't understand it until this seven Angel comes that I can use and then those seals gonna be broke and then their understanding will start to open up then the Revelation begins to start going out but it's going back out now because now he's coming again but this time he's coming for them names that were in that book coming for the elect and he knows the world has got billions of people but there is a uh some of his own scattered amongst them and when this begins to break and the Unseen revelation of the word begins to go forth he knows that only the elector the ones that he has chosen with that kind of equality and ability given to them by himself there will be the only ones that will be able to recognize receive it within their hearts and the change by your praise be to God Amen aren't you glad you are one of them I'm one of them nobody can sing that song right now I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them I'm one of them Holy Ghost people one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them hallelujah amen seal it up till the last days and when the seventh angel comes on the scene Hallelujah he will reveal or make known those Mysteries praise the Lord amen so you understand there quickly have passed us it was the seven Thunders that were sealed up when you say the word was sealed up it's not just this written it's the seven Thunders that was sealed up in there praise God which he couldn't understand and could not receive whatsoever praise the Lord Brother Branham explained this what's a seal a seal is like when you have the the um the train cars carrying grain or carrying goods the inspector comes and puts a seal on that door it might be able to lead or some other thing but he'll put a seal and they have something when they press it it has the back then it used to have the Queen's crown on it the strong property and it's sealed off nobody should open that seal whatsoever because it's sealed up in the boxcar amen but I thank God that uh you don't open the boxcar until you want to see what's in it you want to know what's inside you can walk around it and walk around it and study every wheel and every board trying to guess at what's in it but until the door is open to you you don't know anything you're guessing you're just having educated guesses amen praise God they are that's why they call themselves professors you're professional but you really don't know you're just making an educated guess and then you call it uh you're a professor see that's what it really is it's that that's not just making fun of that but I'm doing it that way that you might understand clearly what it is is that right oh my just like a doctor a doctors don't really heal nothing yeah amen doctors only treat they have to wait on God to heal they might have to use the right of medicine or herb or whatever but whenever you are finished only God can do the healing [Applause] there can't do nothing they are there for the purpose of being able to advise you what is the best medication you can use to bring about your healing but they only remember this they only can treat they cannot heal and the higher up you go and you ask one of them they will tell you that's the truth I can only do my best and then after that you just they're going right back to prayer pray to God that you will start getting better because they have to wait for God to heal because that's the way it is amen praise God well it's the same thing with the Bible the Bible has been sealed and it's been sealed by Roman seals were put on our Bible look when I was a kid and I bought one of those Bibles to hold for Keepsake a big sick Bible like that some of them used to have a padlock on it and before the priest goes up there and I was a Catholic going to Saint Aloysius RC when I was just a kid and they had to open that Bible like Mysteries mysterious and fear on the people and when they roll it back nobody used to read it only the priests can read it and then they will read from this mysterious book here and the lesson close the book put back the lock on it that's the way it is you see it was sealed from 325 Eddie it was sealed with a Roman seal upon it praise God not literal padlock but the minds and hearts were padlocked by these Spirits from Babylon that's why the Bible calls that Spirit mystery Babylon the mother of harlots amen yes sir so so the minds of the people were sealed by and then see that's where the devil's smart he makes up false religion under the same thing with the true revelation of the word of God because everybody call themselves Christian everybody going to a church everybody doing this but everyone but one is acting out what Satan is influencing them to do and one is living by the word because they caught a revelation of that word amen praise the name of the Living God hallelujah well you know the Bible is really what he was referring to that is really God's boxcar and there was this Roman shield on the boxcar and the boxcar now that they yeah they had there had to be opened up amen they couldn't understand it praise the Lord but thank God the prophet broke the seal and opened up the Lord glory to God and while I'm here I'll just take a moment to show you what he did naturally was already done if you go back and look in the uh Matthew and Luke you will find the Bible says when Jesus body was placed in the Tomb that it came to pass an angel descended from heaven like a bolt of lightning and rolled away the stone amen and Jesus stepped out amen rolled away the stone this is what we're talking that angel moved what the Roman seal amen that's what they moved he moved away the Romans seal so that the word could come into Berlin View that the people then could have an unveiling of the Mighty God now in our time it's not a rock it's not a stone and I'm going to go back by the by that same place and Joseph of our matthia's garden where the tomb was and is still is and see it but nothing is there his body isn't there just seeing the scenery of what is there but the fact is that big rock that was there with the Roman seal on it sealed up the tomb and soldiers and all to protect it theologians and so on protecting it you see the angel rolled all of it away and the soldiers all ran away for fear amen just like brother Branham came with the word now and spiritually now they were so fearful of that Ministry because of the power because of the demonstrations because of the spirit of God working through him or praise God hallelujah when a man is going to stand up and tell you please mainly amen yes I see a boy it's not here it's ins it's in Sweden uh nearer there I see him dead and God shows me that he will live again and you know many years after he ended up going there for meetings and while they're driving him to the meeting a car knocked down a little boy in the street and he he steps out of the cart and when he says but I've seen the scene before he says look in your Bible because I told you all to write this down and there is the same scenery written in their Bibles he says you see why I have confidence he just walked up to the boy lay his hands and the boy jumped up picked up his bicycle right away he didn't say thank you or nothing he said jump on the bus little boy right off like that praise God you see but all those things they just can't understand it all Robert's all of them they get them meeting and maybe in the meeting they have four or five people come up and pray for them and they get well this man stands in a meeting every night thousands some of them just get off the train station miles away from where he is and just to get off the train and they walk in towards him the cancer drop off he's not there but what's happening but that's what used to happen that's why T.L Osborne said this was not just a man this has to be God working through a man if God using a man amen Mike and he says even though I'm preaching I'm telling you long after I'm gone I quoted that just the other night where he said long after I'm gone you're gonna find out these things I'm telling you are the truth just say it the Lord [Music] that man would stand in front of thousands of people turn his back he says you don't believe he turned us back and then you'll say there's a woman up there in this aisle so-so number wearing this colored dress and what she has come here for is about this this and and my God and there it is the woman screaming because the thing is gone from her brother Brady from Jamaica comes over I sat in their house and his wife was telling me about it her foot was all swollen didn't know what to do ctors couldn't help her gave her up and sent her home she's laying in the bed he's in North Carolina gets a letter first time he ever went into a meeting with brother brother he's sitting in the meeting Brother Brad was preaching he's preaching all of a sudden he said sir do you believe me to be a servant of God that already said brother I was so scared when that man looked at me I just documented The View he says and when I rose up he continued preaching preaching preaching he waited until I caught up with everybody and hallelujah praise God and then he made all the people gonna look at me now he said sir do you believe me to be a servant of God he said well now everybody looking at me I can't duck he says he says yes sir I do he said oh you do he says you are not from here I see water oh you're from the island of Jamaica and more than that you receive the letter just this morning before you came to this meeting and in the letter it tells you oh I see go back to Jamaica Mr Brady your wife's left foot is healed thus said the Lord oh that's fine she said I didn't know all of this happening but all I know I'm in the darkened bedroom and I see this ball of fire come through the wall and it just goes slowly over the bed and pass out the other wall by time I go out there my foot was back to normal I've never had the problem again for the rest of her life she was healed completely home by the power and the passion for the Mighty God look these are just things we tell but the fact is it actually took place amen hallelujah amen but I just want you to know that it's real amen and as far as I'm concerned what the song says praise God my doubts are settled and I know I know my God is real praise the Lord hallelujah praise God glory to God I think I'm going to start by winding this up here now praise the Lord glory to God Amen yes sir if I go further because I'm going to go into the woman at well and all that and that's going to take you know some more time and I don't want you I just want to leave you salivating thank you waiting for the the next uh piece of the word that we are going to receive while the musicians are all coming up here praise God hallelujah let's Worship the Lord and praise him a little bit amen glory to God God bless you all [Applause] the lamb is still taking the book
