[50:31] joy of the word all over you. Amen.

[51:19] that the Lord will touch him and restore
[51:22] him. Amen. Praise God.
[51:25] I just want to thank everybody again um
[51:28] that uh stood at their post of duty last
[51:33] weekend to make the the meetings uh the
[51:37] wonderful success that they were. Amen.
[51:40] How many enjoyed those meetings this
[51:43] you just you just can't you just can't
[51:46] um say enough of what the Lord did did
[51:50] for our young people. Amen. And um I
[51:53] believe that uh uh everybody anybody
[51:56] that was that was present last weekend
[51:59] in any of the services they know uh they
[52:03] received it was an atmosphere where all
[52:06] things were possible.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; If if you come into that atmosphere with
[52:10] expectation you could have received a
[52:12] tremendous blessing. Amen. Praise God.
[52:15] So thank you everybody for stepping into
[52:17] your positions. You made me very proud
[52:20] as the pastor of this church to see how
[52:23] you treated the people, how you served
[52:25] the people, showed respect under the
[52:27] people, and um put them first. And I
[52:31] believe that anytime that we host guests
[52:33] in the house of the Lord here, we should
[52:36] do that. Amen. And um I'm very grateful
[52:39] for that. And uh God bless you each and
[52:43] everyone. you've just really uh placed a
[52:46] a great blessing upon yourself for just
[52:49] being here and supporting and doing
[52:52] everything that you did. Amen. Praise
[52:54] God. Hallelujah. So, uh, Brother Diggs,
[52:57] you know, um, and I've heard from other
[52:59] people, too, you know, just how
[53:00] wonderful the services were. People just
[53:03] rejoicing still. Um, you know, uh,
[53:06] Brother Diggs said that this one is
[53:07] going to go down in history. He says,
[53:09] "Brother," he says, 'You know, uh, for
[53:12] for for the that kind of an atmosphere
[53:14] to be in the meetings, it takes the
[53:16] faith of the people
[53:18] &gt;&gt; to bring God into the house. Amen. To
[53:20] pull that word and that that anointing
[53:23] down and to meet the needs of the
[53:25] people. Amen. Praise God. So, he he
[53:27] really enjoyed it. He says, you know,
[53:30] God bless all of you that um were so
[53:33] kind and so good to him. He really
[53:34] appreciated that. Amen. And um you know
[53:38] I trust that everybody received their
[53:40] portion. Praise God. But you know um
[53:43] last week we were in preparation for
[53:45] these meetings well for many weeks. And
[53:48] last week, you know, we we canceled the
[53:50] Wednesday night service and we had a
[53:52] prayer meeting and, you know, the Lord
[53:54] just led me to, you know, to to pull out
[53:56] some scriptures and uh, you know, just
[53:58] to to dig deep um with the Lord to pour
[54:03] out for these young people and for us on
[54:06] the weekend that he would just show
[54:07] himself and declare himself. And I'm
[54:10] telling you, God vindicated his word in
[54:13] a dramatic and wonderful way. You can
[54:16] just put up the next slide. This was um
[54:18] the scripture that that we used when we
[54:22] were praying for brother Diggs and we
[54:24] used different scriptures but this one
[54:26] was the one that that the Lord led me
[54:28] to. It said also I heard the voice of
[54:31] the Lord saying whom shall I send and
[54:34] who will go for us? Then said I here I
[54:38] am send me. And so the thought that I
[54:41] brought in the prayer meeting was, you
[54:43] know, brother Diggs is the chosen vessel
[54:45] that God is going to use. And he's he's
[54:47] yielded himself. He's surrendered
[54:49] himself to come and to minister his uh
[54:52] you know, his ministry and the word of
[54:55] God into the hearts of the people. And
[54:58] my God, you know, on Sunday, this was
[55:01] the scripture that he took. And he says,
[55:04] "If not me, then who?" Right? and
[55:07] showing that, you know, that God was was
[55:10] showing that that that he's got a people
[55:13] that he's raising up in these last days,
[55:16] uh, especially amongst our young people
[55:18] to receive a word and to go out and live
[55:22] that word.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. If not me, then who? Praise God.
[55:26] And so, if you'll remember, you can go
[55:28] to the next slide. You know, we prayed
[55:30] for for the young people and one of the
[55:33] things we were praying for was, you
[55:34] know, that that they're going to receive
[55:36] the word of the Lord on that weekend.
[55:38] And they're going to need courage.
[55:40] They're going to need to have the
[55:42] confidence to go back out there and and
[55:45] deal with the enemy and and uh and
[55:48] overcome because, you know, you come
[55:50] into that atmosphere and, you know, you
[55:52] surrender and you rejoice. And a lot of
[55:55] young people were just, you know, coming
[55:57] up and saying, "Oh, brother, you know,
[55:58] some came to me and says, "Can we c can
[56:00] you host meetings like this like every 3
[56:03] months, brother?" You know, like a group
[56:05] of young people. And I said, "Well, you
[56:08] know, you know, you're going to have to
[56:10] fast and pray and really, you know, uh,
[56:12] go to the Lord and if he if he wants
[56:14] something like that, well, let's see
[56:16] what he'll do." But I don't know about
[56:18] that. But anyways, you know, uh but but
[56:20] the whole thing was that, you know, the
[56:21] Lord would strengthen them when they get
[56:24] back out there,
[56:26] &gt;&gt; you know, and and have to deal with the
[56:28] situations that God would expose because
[56:31] that's what God does. He brings you into
[56:33] the house of the Lord. He exposes what
[56:35] needs to be delivered from your life.
[56:37] And so the scripture was, "Have not I
[56:39] commanded thee? Be strong and of good
[56:41] courage." Joshua was a young man that
[56:44] was taking the word of the Lord at in
[56:46] his day. Amen. be be not afraid, neither
[56:49] be thou dismayed, for the Lord thy God
[56:52] is with thee, whethersoever thou goest.
[56:54] And we prayed for our young people and
[56:56] we took about maybe five, six
[56:58] scriptures, but then I put up this slide
[57:01] in the prayer meeting,
[57:03] the next one, and it's David holding the
[57:07] head of Goliath.
[57:09] And if you remember on Sunday, Brother
[57:10] Diggs was walking like this.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; And he was he was showing that, you
[57:15] know, you need to be courageous. You
[57:17] need to be able to take the head of the
[57:20] enemy off whatever situation, whether
[57:23] it's some drug, you know, controlling
[57:26] your life or some some pornography or or
[57:29] or some kind of a of a of a of a
[57:32] stronghold in your life, you need to go
[57:35] back out there and remove the head off
[57:37] of that enemy. Amen. And so I believe
[57:40] that the Lord really poured out and I
[57:43] believe our young people can take this
[57:46] and and and let it be a stepping stone
[57:49] in the direction of where he wants them
[57:51] to go um so that he can use our young
[57:55] people in a mighty way. Amen.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And so we certainly um had a
[58:01] tremendous time and we certainly
[58:03] appreciate the Lord doing what he did
[58:05] for us, giving us um two baptisms,
[58:08] Sister Sarah uh Hope and uh Brother
[58:11] Jesse Mitchell. Amen. That the Lord
[58:15] continue to move on their lives. You,
[58:18] you know, as a village, we need to pray
[58:20] for them. We need to we need to support
[58:22] them. Uh we know that um it's not easy
[58:25] especially in this generation to stand
[58:28] for the word of God. Amen. So we want to
[58:30] thank God for that and we want to thank
[58:32] God for the fruits that he provided for
[58:34] us. Amen. Praise God. Let's go to the
[58:36] word of God. Let's all stand. How many
[58:39] has a request this morning that they
[58:41] want to bring before the Lord and and uh
[58:44] say Lord remember me. Remember this.
[58:47] Remember this person. Remember uh Lord
[58:50] my finance. remember everything. Father,
[58:52] we're so grateful, Lord, that um we can

[59:00] Lord, and that you're mindful of our
[59:02] needs. And Lord, that you want to speak
[59:04] to us. You you want to inspire our
[59:06] hearts to to have the courage to face
[59:10] the life that we are living here in
[59:12] these human vessels. Father, as long as
[59:14] we're here, we're going to need to
[59:16] overcome. And Lord, we are uh this is
[59:21] why we come here. This is why Lord, we
[59:23] we assemble ourselves because we've come
[59:26] into a love affair with you because you
[59:30] have been mindful of us. You are
[59:32] constantly making a way for us. Your
[59:35] your uh your love goes beyond human
[59:38] understanding. And Lord, how is it that
[59:41] you speak to us? Through your word. You
[59:43] you raise a standard. you. Faith cometh
[59:46] by hearing. And Lord, uh, all I can do,
[59:49] Father, is surrender this vessel to you
[59:52] this morning that you would just come
[59:53] and and have your way and and speak and
[59:56] inspire the hearts of the people, Lord.
[59:58] Open their hearts, open their minds. You
[1:00:01] know where each and every one of us are
[1:00:03] at right now, this morning, right here
[1:00:06] at this time in our lives, Lord. Lord,
[1:00:09] last weekend was wonderful. We rejoiced
[1:00:11] in your presence, but this is a new
[1:00:14] week. This is a new day. This is a new
[1:00:16] challenge. This is the hour where we
[1:00:19] have to still stand and and and take
[1:00:22] what you have given us in the word of
[1:00:24] God for this hour and and be the living
[1:00:28] manifestation of that word in a
[1:00:30] generation that's in in absolute turmoil
[1:00:34] and that's falling apart. Lord, give us
[1:00:36] what we need, Father, that we can only
[1:00:39] do and come back and say one thing.
[1:00:43] All the glory is yours, Father.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; And we will never fail but to give you
[1:00:49] praise and honor in all that you are
[1:00:52] doing. Bless, strengthen, heal,
[1:00:56] encourage, correct, edify, do everything
[1:01:00] in our midst this morning, Lord. We so
[1:01:02] appreciate it in Jesus name. Amen and
[1:01:05] amen. God bless you. Let's go to our
[1:01:07] scripture. Um today we're going to
[1:01:10] continue on the purpose of God. This is
[1:01:12] part two. We're going to be looking at
[1:01:14] manifesting your purpose. You know, um
[1:01:17] it's it's it's very um uh clear that God
[1:01:22] has a plan and that God has uh had a
[1:01:25] plan right from the beginning before the
[1:01:27] foundations of the world. And that plan
[1:01:29] has to do with man. Has to do with you
[1:01:32] and me here in on this earth in this
[1:01:36] dimension. Amen. And we want to know how
[1:01:39] we fit into that plan and how it is that
[1:01:41] we are going to manifest our purpose.
[1:01:44] Amen. Praise God. And so, uh, let's go
[1:01:47] to the next slide. Our scripture reading
[1:01:50] comes from Isaiah chapter 60,
[1:01:54] um, and verse 1.
[1:01:58] Amen. Praise God. Arise, shine, for thy
[1:02:02] light is come, and the glory of the Lord
[1:02:06] is risen upon thee. For behold, the
[1:02:09] darkness shall cover the earth, and
[1:02:12] gross darkness the people. Gross dark,
[1:02:15] meaning that it it's it's covering the
[1:02:17] entire earth. It's it's covering all the
[1:02:20] people. It's so dark.
[1:02:23] But the Lord shall arise upon thee,
[1:02:28] and his glory shall be seen upon thee,
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; and the Gentiles shall come to thy
[1:02:36] light, and the kings and kings to the
[1:02:39] brightness of thy rising.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. May the Lord add his blessings to
[1:02:45] the word of God. You may be seated.
[1:02:48] Amen. Praise God. Let's play that. Um, I
[1:02:51] I uploaded a video. I'm I'm not sure.
[1:02:54] Did you uh managed to get that video
[1:02:56] uploaded
[1:03:02] on Shine Your Light. Amen. Turn off the
[1:03:06] lights here on the platform. You can
[1:03:08] leave the front ones, but all the lights
[1:03:10] on the platform, turn them all off.
[1:03:19] You need some volume.
[1:03:22] [Music]
[1:03:38] Heat. Heat.
[1:03:58] Heat.
[1:04:02] [Music]
[1:04:12] Heat.
[1:04:15] [Music]
[1:04:49] Amen. Amen. Praise God.
[1:04:53] And so from the video there, we see that
[1:04:56] that that a light
[1:05:00] has come to you and now you
[1:05:03] are a reflection of that light.
[1:05:06] We will come to realize, you know, after
[1:05:09] this service here
[1:05:11] that God has placed within you an
[1:05:15] attribute that at an appointed time and
[1:05:18] season will come to life. And there's
[1:05:22] only one way that that attribute will
[1:05:24] come to life. And that will be by the
[1:05:28] word of God, the light of God's word
[1:05:32] shining upon you
[1:05:36] here in this dimension. And that light
[1:05:39] awakening
[1:05:40] and piercing the darkness around your
[1:05:44] life in order to bring that light that
[1:05:47] you are into manifestation in these last
[1:05:50] days. Amen. Where gross darkness is over
[1:05:54] the land.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Look at the amplified version here
[1:05:57] from the scripture that we just read. It
[1:06:00] says here, "Arise
[1:06:02] from the depression and prostration in
[1:06:06] which circumstances have kept you."
[1:06:09] you're under certain conditions and
[1:06:12] you're living a life and you've been
[1:06:13] brought up under a certain atmosphere
[1:06:16] and maybe under, you know, some
[1:06:19] generational influences upon your life
[1:06:22] and and and they are restrictions that
[1:06:24] have been placed upon your life. But but
[1:06:27] when Jesus comes and the word for this
[1:06:30] day, the light for this hour comes and
[1:06:33] it crosss your path, it starts to break
[1:06:36] all that darkness away from your life.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Everything that that now stands in front
[1:06:43] or hinders the word of God in your life
[1:06:46] has to be broken and and and moved
[1:06:48] aside. Amen. But it's kept you. But it's
[1:06:51] saying rise to a new life. Amen. You
[1:06:54] could be living on this earth for 10,
[1:06:57] 15, 40, 50, 60 years and you've been
[1:07:02] living a life where you're just
[1:07:04] miserable. You know that your only hope
[1:07:07] is is that you know maybe there's
[1:07:09] something beyond this life because this
[1:07:12] life has just been a life of heartache,
[1:07:15] a a life a life of of trial and
[1:07:17] temptation and heartbreak and all kinds
[1:07:20] of situations. Amen. But but when Jesus
[1:07:24] crosses your path, when the word of God,
[1:07:27] the light of this hour crosses your
[1:07:30] path, whatever condition you're in, it's
[1:07:33] going to bring life.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Because that light is life. Amen. Glory
[1:07:38] to God. He says, "Shine. Be radiant with
[1:07:41] the glory of the Lord for your light has
[1:07:45] come."
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; It's his light coming to you. And now
[1:07:49] you become the light.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. because it's your light. It's his
[1:07:54] life on you. Amen. For your light has
[1:07:57] come. Amen. For behold, darkness shall
[1:08:00] cover the earth and dense darkness. All
[1:08:04] people,
[1:08:05] but the Lord shall arise on you.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Now, we know he's talking to Jerusalem
[1:08:11] here, but we know that Israel always
[1:08:13] types the bride. So, so I'm speaking to
[1:08:15] the bride this morning. Amen.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; We know we know the condition that
[1:08:19] Israel is in. And if you look closely at
[1:08:22] at at the circumstances around us and
[1:08:25] where Israel is right now and the and
[1:08:27] the condition of Israel and the and the
[1:08:29] armies and the wars and the and the
[1:08:32] great battles that they're fighting
[1:08:33] right now, taking out some of the some
[1:08:36] some of the heads of Hamas and taking
[1:08:38] out some of these these evil leaders
[1:08:41] that that are that are trying to destroy
[1:08:43] the nation of Israel. Amen. I want you
[1:08:46] to know that those same powers
[1:08:49] spiritually are against you.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Trying to take your life, trying to keep
[1:08:54] darkness in your life, trying to hold
[1:08:56] you down, keep you in a in a mental
[1:08:59] state, in a mental condition where you
[1:09:02] are absolutely uh uh useless in the
[1:09:05] kingdom of God.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we want to we want to break
[1:09:09] out of that darkness. Amen. Praise God.
[1:09:12] Behold, he says, "But the Lord shall
[1:09:14] rise upon you, and his glory shall be
[1:09:17] seen on you."
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Listen, if you're a Christian in this
[1:09:22] hour and you've come in contact with
[1:09:25] this light,
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; it's got to show in your life.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me that that that that that
[1:09:31] you've received the word of this hour
[1:09:33] and and you're miserable more than
[1:09:35] you're happy.
[1:09:37] You're not the kind of person that
[1:09:38] people want to be around because
[1:09:40] something is missing in your life. Amen.
[1:09:43] It says here, you know, um uh uh the
[1:09:47] glory shall be seen on you and nations
[1:09:49] shall come to your light. You should be
[1:09:52] the kind of person that people want to
[1:09:56] come to. You should be the kind of
[1:09:59] person that that attracts people into
[1:10:01] your life,
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; not push people away,
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; not have a starchy attitude, not have a
[1:10:07] a, you know, a fire in hell attitude.
[1:10:11] We're way down the road, saints.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; This is not the hour to have that kind
[1:10:15] of an atmosphere around our lives. Amen.
[1:10:17] Praise God. Listen here. He says, "And
[1:10:20] and and the kings to to the brightness
[1:10:23] of your rising, you're going to rise up
[1:10:27] and and there are going to be people
[1:10:29] that are going to recognize that you're
[1:10:32] different.
[1:10:33] There's going to be people in your in
[1:10:35] your workplace. There's going to be
[1:10:38] people of influence out there that are
[1:10:40] going to see certain aspects and a
[1:10:43] character on you that is going to
[1:10:45] reflect prosperity. It's going to
[1:10:48] reflect the joy and the strength of the
[1:10:51] Lord in your life. Amen. He says, "Lift
[1:10:55] up your eyes round about you and see.
[1:10:58] They all gather themselves together.
[1:11:01] They come to you. Your sons shall come
[1:11:04] from afar, and your daughters shall be
[1:11:07] carried and nursed in the arms. Then you
[1:11:10] shall see and be radiant, and your heart
[1:11:13] shall thrill and tremble with joy. I I
[1:11:17] just want to stop there for one second.
[1:11:20] Many many of us have lost our joy.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; But you know what the scripture says?
[1:11:29] The scripture says that the joy of the
[1:11:31] Lord is our strength.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; What does it mean by that? It means that
[1:11:37] the joy of your relationship with the
[1:11:40] Lord should be expressed in your life.
[1:11:44] like like you know like we've been
[1:11:45] saying you should be testifying to the
[1:11:48] people about how wonderful it is to
[1:11:51] serve God. People are missing joy in
[1:11:55] their lives because something has has
[1:11:58] has come and and and and
[1:12:02] infiltrated your life in a way that it's
[1:12:05] taken your attention off the word and
[1:12:08] placed it on these situations, these
[1:12:11] these maybe a broken relationship, maybe
[1:12:14] you know something that happened in your
[1:12:16] past while you were, you know, growing
[1:12:18] up. you young people, you know, you got
[1:12:21] to let go of certain circumstances
[1:12:24] because the joy of the Lord is something
[1:12:27] that you that that you need in order to
[1:12:31] have strength to overcome in this day
[1:12:33] and in this hour.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; You can't be a Christian that's that's
[1:12:37] miserable, has no joy. Guess what? If
[1:12:41] you got no joy in the Lord, you got no
[1:12:44] strength. And how you going to overcome
[1:12:46] situations without his strength?
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Remember, the Holy Ghost is the ability
[1:12:52] to overcome anything that the enemy
[1:12:55] tries to bring your way.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost once it's made
[1:12:59] contact with you, it brings a joy
[1:13:02] unspeakable. Amen. But the joy of the
[1:13:05] Lord is our strength. Something has
[1:13:06] sabotaged your joy. Amen. a hurt, a
[1:13:10] persistent sin, you know, something that
[1:13:14] you just it's there, you know, it's
[1:13:16] there, you just keep letting it stay
[1:13:18] there.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; You you figure, oh, well, you know, I
[1:13:21] you you try to justify this, justify
[1:13:23] that. You need to take its head off.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then you will notice all
[1:13:29] of a sudden the joy of the Lord starts
[1:13:31] to come back into your life.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; And when you've got joy, you've got
[1:13:35] confidence. When you've got confidence,
[1:13:37] you've got an atmosphere around you that
[1:13:39] attracts people to the light.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Maybe some guilt,
[1:13:45] maybe other people's opinions. We're not
[1:13:48] interested. You need to kick those
[1:13:50] things out and get back to your
[1:13:52] relationship with Christ.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Make the word your
[1:13:57] absolute.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Back to your first love. Amen. Glory to
[1:14:02] God. And it continues to say, "At a
[1:14:05] glorious uh deliverance and be enlarged
[1:14:08] because the abundant wealth," and he
[1:14:10] uses in here the Dead Sea. And you know,
[1:14:13] I looked into that a little bit. And did
[1:14:15] you know that there's, you know, it was
[1:14:17] called the Dead Sea and it, you know,
[1:14:19] you couldn't swim in it, you couldn't
[1:14:21] drink it, you couldn't do anything with
[1:14:22] it until they discovered that there's
[1:14:25] more minerals and and and uh and wealth
[1:14:28] in the Dead Sea that they're comparing
[1:14:30] it that they could draw so much wealth
[1:14:32] out of the Dead Sea that it would
[1:14:34] compare to three times the US economic
[1:14:38] financial power.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; We're talking trillions here. Amen. Why?
[1:14:44] Because God is showing us that that that
[1:14:47] when we come when when when our time
[1:14:50] comes, we are going to shine with
[1:14:52] prosperity.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; We are going to shine with abundance.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; We are not going to be a a people that's
[1:14:58] that's been defeated. We're a people
[1:15:00] that have overcome, that have received
[1:15:03] what God has in in in store for those
[1:15:06] that recognize the word and the light
[1:15:08] for their day. Amen. Praise God. It goes
[1:15:11] on to say that you know that um that
[1:15:14] unto you shall the nations come with
[1:15:16] treasures. A multitude of camels from
[1:15:19] the eastern tribes shall cover you.
[1:15:21] Jerusalem, the young camels of Midian,
[1:15:24] of Epha, all the men from Sheba once who
[1:15:27] once came to trade shall shall come
[1:15:29] bringing gold, frankincense.
[1:15:32] But notice it didn't it didn't mention
[1:15:34] myrr. Why? Because this is not about
[1:15:37] death. This is about resurrection. Amen.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; This is going to bring forth a rapture.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; This light that we're that we're
[1:15:44] accepting and we're receiving now is
[1:15:46] going to is going to change you. It's
[1:15:48] going to transform you. It's going to
[1:15:50] take you from this dimension into
[1:15:52] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Amen.
[1:15:56] Praise God. That that part we're not
[1:15:58] interested in. Amen. Glory to God. And
[1:16:01] so here, let's let's um let's go to the
[1:16:03] next scripture here.
[1:16:05] Um Ephesians chapter 1 verse 3-5 says,
[1:16:09] "Blessed be the God and father of our
[1:16:12] Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us
[1:16:16] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[1:16:18] places in Christ." Now my purpose in
[1:16:21] taking this scripture is because I want
[1:16:23] to emphasize hath. Now listen, God is
[1:16:27] going to manifest his purpose in your
[1:16:29] life.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Everybody agree with that? Because you
[1:16:33] can't stop the heaven and earth will
[1:16:35] pass away, but my word shall not pass.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; It will accomplish that which it has
[1:16:40] been sent forth to accomplish.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want you to notice he said
[1:16:44] hath blessed. Amen. Hath chosen us in
[1:16:49] him before the foundations of the world
[1:16:51] that we should be holy and without blame
[1:16:54] before him in love. having that means
[1:16:58] past having predestinated us unto the
[1:17:02] adoption of children by Christ Jesus to
[1:17:04] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:17:08] of his will. I want you to notice here
[1:17:11] that your manifestation and when your
[1:17:15] manifestation is going to come and be
[1:17:18] and and fulfill God's purpose. I want
[1:17:20] you to know that God already
[1:17:23] prepared
[1:17:24] that attribute
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; everything that that that God desires
[1:17:29] for you to express in this age because
[1:17:32] you are the expression of the word when
[1:17:34] you receive the light.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; You become the light.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Right? We saw the video shine. Let your
[1:17:41] light shine. Amen. So, so here now I
[1:17:44] want you to know that this is not
[1:17:46] something that that that is going to be,
[1:17:49] you know,
[1:17:51] happen now and well, let's see what we
[1:17:54] can do.
[1:17:55] Let's see if I can overcome these
[1:17:57] situations in my life.
[1:18:00] I want you to know that he hath already
[1:18:04] predestinated
[1:18:05] your purpose, your manifestation, your
[1:18:08] time, your season to come into the light
[1:18:12] of God's word. This is not something
[1:18:14] that's going to be by accident. This is
[1:18:17] not because you answered an altar call.
[1:18:19] This is not because you decided to join
[1:18:22] this church. This is because unto you it
[1:18:25] has been given to know the mystery of
[1:18:28] God.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. The mystery of God uniting with
[1:18:32] man. God's desire to take and possess
[1:18:36] you and reflect himself through you.
[1:18:40] Amen. Everything that will ever be
[1:18:43] already was in the mind of God. When he
[1:18:47] saw you in his mind before the
[1:18:49] foundation of the world, he saw you
[1:18:50] right here, right now in this meeting
[1:18:52] tonight. Today.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. He saw me delivering this message
[1:18:58] in season because he has a purpose in
[1:19:01] his word being being delivered in a
[1:19:04] certain time and season.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Everybody's got Listen,
[1:19:08] everybody's got a ministry. The
[1:19:10] five-fold ministry is made up in in in
[1:19:12] five different folds. Amen. My ministry
[1:19:15] is a little bit different. I'm I'm not
[1:19:17] I'm not like like I can't be brother
[1:19:20] Diggs. I can't be brother Tim. I can't
[1:19:23] be Pastor John Simon, our previous
[1:19:26] former pastor. I can't be brother
[1:19:29] Phillip. I can't be brother Emmanuel.
[1:19:32] Because there's aspects of the word that
[1:19:35] God wants to bring out in a time and in
[1:19:38] a season that is going to meet your
[1:19:41] particular need. Amen.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; And he's going to use the fivefold
[1:19:45] ministry to feed and to deal with all
[1:19:48] those areas of our lives. I really
[1:19:51] enjoyed the service on Wednesday night
[1:19:53] with brother Emmanuel. Amen. Praise God.
[1:19:56] Glory to God. Don't you judge. You let
[1:19:59] the Holy Spirit bring out what it is
[1:20:01] that's in that that attribute
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; because every attribute is not going to
[1:20:06] be clones.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; We're not clones.
[1:20:12] We are individuals, sons and daughters
[1:20:14] of God. All you got to do is look out
[1:20:16] there at the variety of plants and
[1:20:19] flowers and colors and the things that
[1:20:22] God has created in his glory that that
[1:20:25] that all things were created by him and
[1:20:27] they exist by him.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; And then you think that you're going to
[1:20:32] be like anybody else?
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:20:35] I look at every one of you and I see a
[1:20:38] difference
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; in every single attribute of God
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; and God has a way of speaking and and
[1:20:47] delivering his word to those attributes
[1:20:51] at the right time in the right season.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; So in due season his his predestinated
[1:20:59] will comes into manifestation.
[1:21:02] This is the hour for the manifestation
[1:21:05] of the sons and daughters of God in
[1:21:07] bride form.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; She is going to be an exact an exact uh
[1:21:13] uh presentation of Jesus Christ in the
[1:21:17] power of his resurrection. She will have
[1:21:20] his abilities. She will have his love.
[1:21:23] She will have his patience. She will
[1:21:26] have his peace because she is reflecting
[1:21:30] him. Amen. Praise God. So, our
[1:21:33] predestinated purpose is to be the body
[1:21:36] of Christ, the body in this end time
[1:21:40] age.
[1:21:41] And that's why it's called the bride
[1:21:43] age. We're no longer in the Leodysian
[1:21:46] age
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; in the church.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; We've we've moved on. God is now calling
[1:21:51] a bride out of the church age.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Actually, he's calling a bride out
[1:21:57] of the message church. Amen.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; That's how that's how honed in this is
[1:22:02] this is getting, saints.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; This is not going to this is not going
[1:22:06] to stop. And and God is not going to be
[1:22:09] bottled up. God is not going to be
[1:22:11] placed in into a a certain uh doctrine
[1:22:16] because that's the thing about man that
[1:22:18] man always wants to denominate and and
[1:22:20] take control of the word and say if it's
[1:22:22] not this way then it's then it's you're
[1:22:25] lost.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; No sir, that's not Jesus Christ. It's
[1:22:28] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:22:31] He does not operate that way. Amen.
[1:22:34] Praise God. We need to rise and shine
[1:22:37] because it's our time now. And Paul has
[1:22:39] told us that God hath he hath he hath
[1:22:44] already blessed us. You're already
[1:22:47] blessed.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're already called.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; You're already predestinated. You're
[1:22:53] already uh you know uh prepared in the
[1:22:56] eyes of God. Everything that you need is
[1:22:59] in you. It just needs to be manifest.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; That's what God's purpose is in giving
[1:23:04] you the Holy Ghost.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Let's go to the
[1:23:08] next slide. In John 8:12, it says, "Then
[1:23:13] Jesus spake again unto them, saying, I
[1:23:16] am the light of the world. He that
[1:23:20] followeth me shall not walk in darkness
[1:23:23] but shall have the light of life.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; So what do we understand here? That when
[1:23:29] you receive the word for your day,
[1:23:33] it brings life.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; It brings a life.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; It brings a change of a new life. You
[1:23:41] cannot remain the same way. There's
[1:23:44] absolutely no way that you're going to
[1:23:46] remain the same. just go back and look
[1:23:48] at your experience. And if you haven't
[1:23:50] had that lifech changing experience with
[1:23:53] Christ, then you're still on the
[1:23:55] journey. If if if the things of the
[1:23:58] world and the cares of this life h are
[1:24:00] are are still covering over and and your
[1:24:04] life and the the purpose of your life
[1:24:07] doesn't include first Jesus Christ. And
[1:24:11] you young people, whether it's whether
[1:24:12] it's a a career, something that you're
[1:24:14] looking to, you know, down the road, if
[1:24:16] the if the purpose of God has come into
[1:24:19] you, which is the Holy Ghost, by the
[1:24:21] way, that's God's purpose. That's why he
[1:24:24] gives it to you, so that you can live
[1:24:26] his will, his purpose. And so, if you've
[1:24:29] received that, then your plans got to
[1:24:32] line up with his purpose.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; It can't take you away from the message
[1:24:38] of the hour. No,
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; it's got to bring you closer to the
[1:24:41] message of the hour.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; It's got to it's got to cause you to dig
[1:24:44] into the word, listening to the prophet,
[1:24:47] listening and reading the messages.
[1:24:50] Uh uh uh you know, getting into the um
[1:24:53] seals and and and the seven church ages
[1:24:56] and having an understanding of why God
[1:24:59] sent a prophet in these last days, the
[1:25:02] purpose of it all. That's what the Holy
[1:25:04] Ghost will do. It will bring you back to
[1:25:08] the word of God. It will take you out of
[1:25:10] the darkness and it will reflect the
[1:25:14] light of life
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; which is the life of Christ. Amen. Let's
[1:25:18] read our quote here from brother
[1:25:19] Brandham from the message shalom. He
[1:25:21] says that son which is the light is the
[1:25:26] word of God. In the beginning God said
[1:25:29] let there be light. When God said, "Let
[1:25:32] there be light," life came into
[1:25:35] existence.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Without light, there's no life.
[1:25:40] And when the manifested word of God,
[1:25:42] when the word of God was manifested,
[1:25:45] there was light. God spoke it, what if
[1:25:48] he didn't manifest? Then it wasn't light
[1:25:51] yet. And so, if you're not manifesting
[1:25:54] the word, then you haven't had the light
[1:25:57] turned on. You haven't met the man that
[1:26:00] can turn on the light yet.
[1:26:03] Amen. But when he spoke it and then it
[1:26:06] was manifested, vindicated, his word was
[1:26:09] vindicated, light come into existence.
[1:26:12] Amen. And that's the only way it can be
[1:26:15] done now is when the word is vindicated,
[1:26:19] God's written word vindicated, then it
[1:26:22] shows life,
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; light.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; It brings forth a life.
[1:26:29] under the revealed word of this hour.
[1:26:31] Now you are reflection in this
[1:26:33] generation of what God is doing today.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; That's why we always, you know, we
[1:26:39] always say, have you recognized your
[1:26:41] word
[1:26:43] for the day that you're living in?
[1:26:45] Right.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Everybody's praising Jesus for what he's
[1:26:48] done in the past, what he's going to do,
[1:26:50] but they're failing to recognize what
[1:26:52] he's doing right now
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; in your life, in your circumstances, in
[1:26:58] your family, in your home, in your
[1:27:00] health, in your wealth. You need to come
[1:27:02] into that personal relationship so that
[1:27:05] you can know that there's light that can
[1:27:07] that can shine in your life and and blow
[1:27:10] the darkness out of your life. Amen.
[1:27:12] Amen.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; We find it in the church ages.
[1:27:16] He says here the uh uh God's written
[1:27:19] word vindicated then it shows light.
[1:27:21] It's a portion is lit or put out for
[1:27:24] each age. You see there's a portion of
[1:27:27] light that God is going to put out in
[1:27:30] each age. How do you think he puts that
[1:27:32] portion out?
[1:27:34] By sending you.
[1:27:36] by having you who he hath blessed who he
[1:27:41] hath predestinated
[1:27:43] uh to be to be adopted sons and
[1:27:46] daughters of God. Amen. To receive the
[1:27:49] adoption to receive the light for our
[1:27:52] day. Amen. The portion in each age,
[1:27:55] you're that portion. We find it in the
[1:27:57] church ages. We find it in the Old
[1:27:59] Testament ages. Each time that there
[1:28:02] come a time for a certain manifestation
[1:28:05] of the journey, there was a prophet that
[1:28:08] came to the earth and the word came to
[1:28:11] the prophet and he made that word live.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. And when that word was
[1:28:17] identified, it reflected God.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; And there was the age and there was the
[1:28:24] light. And that's the way light comes
[1:28:27] today. Amen. God sent a prophet. God
[1:28:31] vindicated that prophet.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; He went around the world seven times.
[1:28:36] William Brandham vindicated that
[1:28:38] ministry. Turn the hearts of the
[1:28:41] children back to the light,
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; back to the original word so that we
[1:28:46] could know what was truth. Amen. Every
[1:28:50] age had a portion. We can't take Moses's
[1:28:53] message. That was God's message for the
[1:28:56] Israelites back in the days when he was
[1:28:58] bringing them out of Egypt.
[1:29:01] We can't take Moses's message uh or we
[1:29:04] can't take and we can't take Noah's
[1:29:06] message because that was the portion of
[1:29:08] light that God gave Noah.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; But God has a portion of light that that
[1:29:15] he gave to a prophet in the 20th century
[1:29:18] by the name of William Branham. And that
[1:29:21] light reflected every son and daughter
[1:29:26] back to the original word
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; because there was absolute confusion on
[1:29:31] the earth.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Nobody knew what to believe. There was
[1:29:34] revival. They were they were they were
[1:29:37] ramping up all over the earth. But there
[1:29:39] was confusion because one said the
[1:29:41] evidence of the Holy Ghost was speaking
[1:29:43] in tongues. Another one was that you've
[1:29:45] got to have the the the word of
[1:29:47] prophecy, that you've got to have, you
[1:29:49] know, uh a healing ministry. He's all of
[1:29:52] those things. And he'll always be those
[1:29:55] things. But we need to receive what
[1:29:58] light he has for us today so that we can
[1:30:02] get under that anointing, under that
[1:30:04] light, so that we can receive what we
[1:30:06] have need of to overcome in this age.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; You need to overcome in this age. I see
[1:30:12] a lot of people living miserable.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; They've lost the joy of their strength.
[1:30:16] They've lost the joy of the Lord.
[1:30:18] They've lost the joy of their salvation.
[1:30:20] You don't lose your salvation if God
[1:30:21] gives it to you. You can never lose it.
[1:30:24] But you can live miserable.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; You could be in confusion.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; You could be in a in a message church
[1:30:30] wondering, "Oh, this is just all law. We
[1:30:32] got to do this. We got to do that. It's
[1:30:34] all this, do this, do that." That's all
[1:30:36] you're hearing. But when you come to the
[1:30:38] light of this message in this hour,
[1:30:41] Jesus Christ is saying, "Heim whom the
[1:30:43] son of man sets free." And then he gives
[1:30:47] us the keys.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; And he says, "You now have the keys.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; You you go out and and and whatever you
[1:30:54] loose shall be loosed.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Whatever you bind shall be bound."
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Because he wants to give you that light
[1:31:00] now to be the reflection in this age and
[1:31:02] in this hour.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet of Malachi 4 came for
[1:31:06] one purpose. To shine the light on the
[1:31:09] word and to introduce the mighty angel
[1:31:12] to the church
[1:31:14] of this age, the bride. Amen. Praise
[1:31:17] God. And that's why it's so important to
[1:31:20] understand the opening of those seals,
[1:31:22] the opening of the word, the mighty
[1:31:25] angel that has come down that is now in
[1:31:27] control of this church.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; He's the one that leads the church. It's
[1:31:31] not led by Voice of God International.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; It's not led by some, you know, great
[1:31:36] preacher who's got a great big following
[1:31:39] who has thousands of people following
[1:31:41] him online and and millions of people
[1:31:44] whatever YouTube hits and oh, look at
[1:31:47] this. this person. Listen, I can tell
[1:31:49] you right now, message churches and
[1:31:54] message ministers, even if they get
[1:31:57] 50,000 hits on YouTube, there's people
[1:32:01] out there with a million hits.
[1:32:04] The hits don't mean nothing.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; It comes back to the word.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; It comes back to the reality of what God
[1:32:12] is doing in this day.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; And it's never been a big crowd. It'll
[1:32:16] never be a big crowd.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; It'll never be a huge church.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; It's not going to God never did it that
[1:32:22] way. He's never done it that way. Amen.
[1:32:25] Praise God. He just sends a little
[1:32:27] portion of his word to reflect his light
[1:32:32] for that particular age. And they start
[1:32:35] to now reflect
[1:32:37] that word. Glory to God.
[1:32:44] And that's the way light comes.
[1:32:48] Amen. Praise God. Let's read our next
[1:32:50] scripture.
[1:32:53] Amen.
[1:32:55] We're just um we're going to read here
[1:32:58] from the book of Acts.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Chapter 13. Because I want I want you to
[1:33:03] see here how how the word comes in its
[1:33:06] day. Like you know, they all went to the
[1:33:08] upper room. They all received the Holy
[1:33:10] Ghost. And now their ministries went
[1:33:12] forth. Amen. And here we are today. And
[1:33:15] you know when people ask me, brother
[1:33:16] Danny, you know, or Danny, you know,
[1:33:18] like, uh, what do you believe? I said,
[1:33:21] well, you know what? The best way to
[1:33:23] kind of describe it is, um, if you if
[1:33:25] you get some time, you read the book of
[1:33:26] Acts and you you see what the Holy
[1:33:30] Spirit is doing because it's not the
[1:33:31] acts of the people, it's the acts of the
[1:33:34] Holy Ghost
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; in the people. Amen.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; And and we are kind of a continuation of
[1:33:39] that same church. So what you see in
[1:33:41] there is what you're going to get from
[1:33:42] me,
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; you know. So if you really want to know
[1:33:46] more, then you know, then I'll get into
[1:33:47] baptism with them. I'll get into, you
[1:33:49] know, have you received the Holy Ghost
[1:33:50] and and so forth. But here now, let's
[1:33:53] look at, you know, how how this all
[1:33:54] evolves here. Paul and Barnabas waxed
[1:33:57] bold and said it was necessary that the
[1:34:00] word of God should first have been
[1:34:03] spoken to you. Now, they're talking to
[1:34:05] the Jews here, okay? They're boldly
[1:34:08] speaking out to the Jews and because
[1:34:09] they've received the Holy Ghost. They've
[1:34:11] received the message of the hour. And
[1:34:13] but seeing ye put it from you and judge
[1:34:16] yourselves unworthy of everlasting life,
[1:34:18] lo, we're going to turn to the Gentiles.
[1:34:21] And so, this message that you and I are
[1:34:25] now uh you know, bearing light to is for
[1:34:28] the Gentiles.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; It is for the Gentile church. It's for
[1:34:32] it's for your friends, your families
[1:34:34] that are Gentiles. You know, now you
[1:34:37] don't know where attributes are going to
[1:34:40] have ended up. They could have ended up
[1:34:41] in a Muslim home. They could have ended
[1:34:43] up in a Buddhist home. They could have
[1:34:45] ended up in all kinds of different
[1:34:47] religions and teachings. And that's why
[1:34:50] we don't we don't differentiate people
[1:34:52] when we're testifying to them about the
[1:34:55] word and the light of this hour.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; We just let it reflect. We we we we we
[1:35:00] give our testimony. We let the light we
[1:35:03] we we tell them that how joyful we are
[1:35:06] in serving the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:35:08] that he's our savior. Amen. And so for
[1:35:11] so for so hath the Lord commanded us,
[1:35:13] saying, "I have set thee to be a light
[1:35:17] to the Gentiles." You're a light.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; We are lights.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; We are reflecting the word for our day.
[1:35:23] Amen. Glory to God. thou and and that
[1:35:26] thou shouldest be for salvation unto the
[1:35:29] ends of the earth. And now listen. And
[1:35:32] when the Gentiles heard this, they were
[1:35:35] glad.
[1:35:36] But pay attention. And glorified
[1:35:40] Paul and Barnabas.
[1:35:44] No, they glorified the word.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; You see, it's recognizing the word.
[1:35:51] People are people are bringing this
[1:35:54] message in such a way that all they're
[1:35:56] doing is they're they're they're putting
[1:35:58] message tracks into the people's faces
[1:35:59] say William Brandham William Brandham
[1:36:01] William Brandom William Brandham
[1:36:06] there's a lot of people that recognize
[1:36:09] William Brham but now they've gone off
[1:36:11] into another sphere and all they want to
[1:36:14] hear is William Brandham all they want
[1:36:17] to hear is the tapes. All they want to
[1:36:20] read are the tracks. They don't need
[1:36:23] anything else. They don't need present
[1:36:25] light. They don't realize that the light
[1:36:28] is moving on.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. They don't
[1:36:32] realize what God is doing in this hour.
[1:36:34] Let's read on here. He says in Galatians
[1:36:36] 1 11-13, he says, "But I certify you,
[1:36:40] brethren, that the gospel which was
[1:36:42] preached unto me is not after man."
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; We're not interested in man's teachings
[1:36:48] here.
[1:36:50] He says here, "For I neither received it
[1:36:52] of man,
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; neither was I taught it, but by the
[1:36:56] revelation of Jesus Christ."
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; What what happened to Revelation?
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, no. You you just listen to the
[1:37:05] tapes.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; You just you just you just you know, you
[1:37:09] say it the way he said it.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Like, listen, I'm not coming against
[1:37:12] anybody here. I want you to understand
[1:37:15] the Holy Spirit is going to exp Listen,
[1:37:17] we're walking in light.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; And if we're walking in light, then the
[1:37:20] darkness is going to flee around us.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; And we're not going to be bound by by by
[1:37:24] by darkness. Amen. Praise God. Listen,
[1:37:28] I'm reading quotes from William Branham.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; So don't think that I don't believe
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; what he said.
[1:37:39] I believe everything he said. I also
[1:37:42] believe that he was a man under an
[1:37:45] anointing of a prophetic ministry and
[1:37:48] that he was also a man of like passion
[1:37:50] and that he was also a man that had to
[1:37:52] grow in revelation just like you and me.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Cuz when he came to the seals, he he
[1:37:59] says, "This is a new book."
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; He says, "I would have messed this whole
[1:38:02] thing up.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; I would have I would have preached
[1:38:04] something completely different if I
[1:38:06] hadn't received this intervention in my
[1:38:08] life. It's just like you and me right
[1:38:11] now. We're right in the same place.
[1:38:13] We've come to a place where this is a
[1:38:15] new Bible to us
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; when the Holy Ghost comes upon you. This
[1:38:19] word comes alive.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; It's not it's not voice of God comes
[1:38:23] alive. It's not it's not all these these
[1:38:25] message churches that come alive. It's
[1:38:27] Jesus Christ in the present stage of his
[1:38:30] ministry
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; by the revealing of his word because
[1:38:33] it's not given by man.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; You're never going to receive this by
[1:38:38] man. And if somebody gives you a tape
[1:38:40] and says you got to hear this tape and
[1:38:43] by listening to this tape you're going
[1:38:45] to be converted. I'm not saying you're
[1:38:47] not going to get converted. I got
[1:38:49] converted.
[1:38:51] I heard the first message that I heard
[1:38:54] was Hebrews series. Brother William
[1:38:57] Branam preaching on the Hebrews series.
[1:39:01] It didn't attract me to him. Something
[1:39:03] was pounding on the inside of my heart
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; that I didn't understand. But then it
[1:39:08] was when I come into this church and I
[1:39:11] come under the ministry of John Simon
[1:39:14] who had the anointed light in his day
[1:39:17] was preaching the word for the hour.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Was pointing us always back to the word.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; I fell in love with the word.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; The word became a reality to me.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Everything was the word. I would be
[1:39:31] fellowshipping on the word. I would be
[1:39:34] fellowshipping on on the anointing, on
[1:39:37] the spirit, on the the ability of what
[1:39:39] God could do in my life because he
[1:39:42] delivered me.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; He set me free.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Until you come to that place, you can't
[1:39:48] even see the prophet.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; You won't even recognize what he's
[1:39:52] really done in this hour.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; You'll just become another parrot
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; that'll just quote what he says. Oh, no,
[1:39:58] brother. Just say it the way it says.
[1:40:00] Oh, you don't really need a pastor. You
[1:40:02] don't really need, you know, you No, no,
[1:40:03] no. The five-fold ministry is good, but
[1:40:05] you know what? Put the tapes first.
[1:40:10] Oh, Jesus. Hallelujah.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that you are not walking
[1:40:15] under that kind of a of an anointing in
[1:40:18] your life?
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Because you know what that you know what
[1:40:21] that kind of thing brings? It brings
[1:40:23] legalism.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; It puts law upon your life. All of a
[1:40:27] sudden, you're not the joyful person
[1:40:30] that you're supposed to be in the Lord.
[1:40:32] You don't have the strength to overcome
[1:40:34] the things because you're relying on
[1:40:36] some, you know, some teaching, some
[1:40:38] some, you know, uh uh boundary that that
[1:40:41] you come under. And now, as long as you
[1:40:43] stay into that boundary, you're safe.
[1:40:46] You got to come out of that. You got to
[1:40:48] come and go beyond the camp. Amen.
[1:40:50] Praise God. He says, "For ye have heard
[1:40:53] of my conversation in time past in the
[1:40:56] Jews religion,
[1:40:59] how that beyond measure I persecuted the
[1:41:01] church of God and wasted it." But he
[1:41:04] goes on here and he says, next slide, he
[1:41:06] goes, "And profited in the Jews religion
[1:41:09] above many my equal in my own nation,
[1:41:12] being more exceedingly zealous of the
[1:41:14] traditions of my fathers."
[1:41:17] What he's saying there is that he became
[1:41:19] like a like a a a smart theologian,
[1:41:23] smarter than most of the other
[1:41:24] theologians.
[1:41:26] And there's people that can outquote
[1:41:28] you, me, and everybody else on this
[1:41:30] message and out quote the prophet and
[1:41:32] bring up quotes just like that. Oh, no.
[1:41:34] The prophet said this. Nope. The prophet
[1:41:36] said that. No, brother, you're off. The
[1:41:37] prophet said this. No,
[1:41:40] he became so much like that. But he's
[1:41:44] saying that that now he says, "But it
[1:41:47] pleased God." Now watch. Now watch here.
[1:41:49] This I love this. When I came to this, I
[1:41:51] was rejoicing.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; He says, "But when it pleased God,
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; oh my goodness." Listen, you might be
[1:41:59] sitting in a certain condition here this
[1:42:01] morning. I don't know whatever it is,
[1:42:03] but listen. But when it pleased God, who
[1:42:06] separated me from my mother's womb,
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; he separated you from your from your
[1:42:12] your your human understanding, your
[1:42:15] human experience,
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; your your human birth. He's talking
[1:42:19] about your human birth here. He says he
[1:42:22] says separating me from and called me by
[1:42:25] his grace.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. To reveal his son to me.
[1:42:33] Amen.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; In
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; me.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; You mean in you?
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; There's something in you that needs to
[1:42:41] be revealed to you. He didn't say Paul
[1:42:44] Paul didn't turn around and say that,
[1:42:46] you know, until he revealed his son to
[1:42:48] me. No, in me that I might preach him
[1:42:53] among the heathen. Immediately I
[1:42:55] conferred not with flesh and blood.
[1:42:57] [Music]
[1:43:00] All of a sudden now, I don't care what
[1:43:01] anybody says.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; I'm coming under the headship of the
[1:43:05] word.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; I'm coming under the leadership of the
[1:43:08] word.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; I want to know what God is doing in my
[1:43:11] day. Now, I'm not interested in in man's
[1:43:13] teachings. I'm not interested in the
[1:43:15] denominational teachings. I'm not
[1:43:17] interested in all these different
[1:43:18] teachings of of new age and understand.
[1:43:21] No, no, no, no, no. He revealed himself
[1:43:25] in me.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can't take that out of me.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; You cannot remove that from me.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; It's something that that I know that I
[1:43:33] know. And you got to get to a place
[1:43:34] where you know that you know.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; It's no longer you. It's that's why the
[1:43:39] scripture says Christ in you. Your hope
[1:43:42] of glory.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; No hope outside of that. It's got to be
[1:43:46] Christ in you. Amen. Praise God.
[1:43:49] Hallelujah.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; But here, listen next.
[1:43:53] He says, brother Bram says, "Our
[1:43:55] heavenly father, we now bring to you
[1:43:57] every hand that's up everywhere and let
[1:44:00] the Holy Ghost of God bring to them the
[1:44:02] rhythm of the word and its truth. You
[1:44:06] want the rhythm of God's word, you want
[1:44:08] the Holy Ghost, you need to you need to
[1:44:10] listen to you young people. If there's
[1:44:12] one thing that you want and you you
[1:44:14] forget about everything else, if you're
[1:44:17] not satisfied yet, if you haven't come
[1:44:19] to a place, and I'm young people, I'm
[1:44:21] talking everybody. Because there a lot
[1:44:23] of people in this place, they don't got
[1:44:25] joy. They need it to be restored. That's
[1:44:27] why David, when David cried out and
[1:44:30] said, "Lord, restore unto me the joy of
[1:44:33] thy salvation." He wasn't talking about
[1:44:36] my salvation. Restore unto me my
[1:44:38] salvation. No, the joy of my salvation.
[1:44:41] You're already saved, but you're missing
[1:44:44] out on certain things. Amen. Praise God.
[1:44:46] The Holy Ghost has all those things to
[1:44:50] bring you back into the rhythm and its
[1:44:52] truth. And they are to be molded now
[1:44:55] into sons and daughters of God. And they
[1:44:58] are to be the reflecting of the light of
[1:45:01] God upon the earth.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; They are to be manifested word.
[1:45:12] manifested word
[1:45:15] that men and women are to live the way
[1:45:17] Jesus lived and to believe every word of
[1:45:21] God and live by it like he did. And so a
[1:45:25] lot of people, you know, when they say,
[1:45:26] you know, uh um you know, live like like
[1:45:29] Jesus lived,
[1:45:31] how do you live like Jesus lived? You
[1:45:34] know, you know, be perfect as your
[1:45:36] heavenly father is perfect.
[1:45:39] All of a sudden, you know, you're gonna
[1:45:40] take that. You might look at that and
[1:45:42] say, "Oh my god, I gotta be perfect."
[1:45:44] That's not what he meant.
[1:45:46] No, sir. Be perfect like Jesus was per
[1:45:49] Listen, when Jesus came to the earth, he
[1:45:52] says, "I do nothing lest the father
[1:45:54] reveals it to me."
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; He says, "For this purpose have I come
[1:46:00] to manifest the light in a time of
[1:46:03] darkness. For that very purpose have I
[1:46:06] come." He didn't say that you had to be
[1:46:08] perfect. You'll never be perfect, but
[1:46:11] you can come under his headship and you
[1:46:14] can come under his purpose. And the
[1:46:17] moment that you come under that
[1:46:18] leadership, that purpose, that
[1:46:20] anointing, it changes everything. Jesus
[1:46:24] came to fulfill the purpose of the
[1:46:26] father. And if you receive the Holy
[1:46:29] Ghost, the Holy Ghost has a purpose to
[1:46:32] manifest in your life.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; And this is what has to surface in you.
[1:46:38] This is what is going to surface in your
[1:46:40] life. Don't worry about the mistakes
[1:46:43] because the purpose that's in you will
[1:46:45] override the mistakes.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; It'll take away the desire for those
[1:46:50] things. That's why you young people, if
[1:46:53] there's one thing you want, you want the
[1:46:55] Holy Ghost. You say, "Lord, give me the
[1:46:58] baptism of the Holy Ghost." If that's
[1:47:00] how you got to start, then let it be
[1:47:02] that way. Lord, let the that's that's
[1:47:04] what you were experiencing here on the
[1:47:05] weekend. There was a lot of young people
[1:47:07] that were experiencing the baptism of
[1:47:10] the Holy Ghost. Because when his
[1:47:12] presence comes, that's his presence.
[1:47:15] That's his spirit. That's a baptism of
[1:47:18] his presence. That's why you're It's
[1:47:20] like if you go into this tank over here
[1:47:22] and it's full of nice warm water and you
[1:47:24] get into that water, you're exper Oh,
[1:47:26] this feels good. Feels so nice. It feels
[1:47:29] good on my bones. I feel healing coming
[1:47:32] through my body. Hallelujah. You come
[1:47:34] out of the tank. You go back into the
[1:47:35] world and you're cussing and swearing.
[1:47:37] You can't even overcome your own mouth.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; But you need the baptism of the Holy
[1:47:43] Ghost because it is the ability of God
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; in you to overcome the things that you
[1:47:49] need to overcome and get out of the way
[1:47:52] so that your life can get sanctified so
[1:47:55] that so that you know things that need
[1:47:56] to come out of your life. You know, you
[1:47:58] young people, you need these things
[1:48:00] because the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:48:02] remember, made way for what? The Holy
[1:48:06] Ghost himself.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; When that happens, everything changes.
[1:48:10] You're never the same. You can never go
[1:48:12] back to the way that you were. You might
[1:48:14] make mistakes, but you'll be right back.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; You leave the house of the Lord, you get
[1:48:18] upset with the deacon, next weekend,
[1:48:21] you're right back
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; because you know that God is God. You
[1:48:24] know what you've experienced. You know
[1:48:26] what's inside of you. If they go out
[1:48:28] from us and they stay out, it's because
[1:48:30] they were not of us.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; We're not here to try and, you know,
[1:48:36] bring in as many as we possibly can.
[1:48:40] We're looking for the sons and daughters
[1:48:41] of God.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; Those that can receive the light in this
[1:48:45] hour. Amen. Praise God. And so, um, here
[1:48:49] he says, "And they are to to be
[1:48:51] reflecting the light of God upon the
[1:48:52] earth. They are to be the manifested
[1:48:54] word that men and women are to live the
[1:48:57] way Jesus lived and to believe every
[1:48:59] word of God and live by it like he did.
[1:49:02] Amen. Glory to God. Thank you Lord. The
[1:49:05] next slide he says here now we find that
[1:49:07] in each age
[1:49:10] when God said a certain thing thing
[1:49:13] would happen. Here come that man along
[1:49:16] and manifested that. That's what we've
[1:49:19] experienced and we're still experiencing
[1:49:22] it. We're still under that same uh you
[1:49:25] know way provided way on how God does
[1:49:29] and and and reveals himself and opens
[1:49:32] and manifests the word. And here come
[1:49:33] the man along and manifested that. Here
[1:49:36] come their people along and lived that.
[1:49:40] That was God himself living in the
[1:49:43] people because it was an answering of
[1:49:45] his word. God has a word for this day in
[1:49:49] this hour that I'm going to have a bride
[1:49:52] without spot or wrinkle.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; She is going to reflect the perfect
[1:49:57] light of God's word. Not because she's
[1:50:00] perfect, but because he's perfect.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; When you receive a prophet and you
[1:50:06] receive his message, you're receiving
[1:50:09] the light of the age. Amen. And then you
[1:50:13] start to reflect that light. And now you
[1:50:15] are the reflectors of that light. And
[1:50:17] that's why if you can get somebody to
[1:50:19] believe you
[1:50:22] listen, if you've really received that
[1:50:25] light and you know where you stand, you
[1:50:28] know that he's a healer, you know that
[1:50:30] he's a savior, you know that that that
[1:50:33] he's peace, you know that you you you
[1:50:36] can stand on it and you go and you
[1:50:38] testify to somebody, I'll tell you that
[1:50:40] person knows whether you really believe
[1:50:42] it or not.
[1:50:44] And if that person looks into your eyes
[1:50:47] and they say, "This person really
[1:50:49] believes it. I can see it. I believe
[1:50:53] him." If you can get them to believe
[1:50:56] you, you can lay hands on the sick and
[1:50:59] they'll recover.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; Not because you have the ability to
[1:51:02] heal.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. You're not testifying of
[1:51:05] what you can do. You're testifying of
[1:51:08] what you've got.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; You're testifying of his power. It's not
[1:51:12] I that doeth the works, but the Father,
[1:51:15] the anointing, the Holy Ghost that
[1:51:18] dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. And so this
[1:51:26] process continues to unveil itself,
[1:51:29] people catching the light, reflecting
[1:51:32] the light, manifesting the light, other
[1:51:34] people recognize the light, and they
[1:51:37] come to the light. And all of a sudden,
[1:51:39] if there's a if, listen, if there's an
[1:51:40] attribute of God in there, if there's
[1:51:43] representation in there, just the same
[1:51:45] way that he got a hold of you, maybe he
[1:51:48] had to dig through a lot of dirt. You
[1:51:50] know, some people, you know, they had,
[1:51:52] you know, I I remember brother Mike, you
[1:51:54] know, few days, I don't know, maybe last
[1:51:55] week, he says, "Oh, Lord really worked
[1:51:57] took a long time with me."
[1:52:00] He had to
[1:52:03] get down underneath all of the all of
[1:52:05] the the the rocky places in our lives.
[1:52:08] Amen. Praise God. But once once that
[1:52:11] light shines on that attribute, life
[1:52:14] comes forth. It cannot it can never
[1:52:17] remain the same. It'll come into its
[1:52:20] manifestation. It'll start to reflect
[1:52:22] the purpose of God for the age. You will
[1:52:25] become the the the the the reflection of
[1:52:28] the word in your age. You can't help it.
[1:52:30] People are going to know that you're
[1:52:32] different. And if they spend enough time
[1:52:34] talking to you and listening to what it
[1:52:36] is that you've got, they'll realize,
[1:52:38] wait a minute here, this makes perfect
[1:52:40] sense. The problem with the people, you
[1:52:43] know, that that that get hard against
[1:52:44] you is because they're still fighting
[1:52:47] within themselves.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; They're dealing with their pride.
[1:52:49] They're dealing with all the things that
[1:52:51] they need to overcome. Amen. Listen, go
[1:52:54] to the next slide. John 3:19.
[1:52:56] He says, "And this is the com the the
[1:52:58] the the condemnation that light has come
[1:53:02] into the world, and men love darkness
[1:53:04] rather than light." Just like I was
[1:53:06] saying, you're you're you're you're
[1:53:08] reflecting light. You're bringing light
[1:53:10] to your family. You're bringing it to
[1:53:12] your friends. You're bringing it to your
[1:53:13] loved ones. And they love the darkness
[1:53:17] rather than light because their deeds
[1:53:19] were evil. People listen, light always
[1:53:23] exposes darkness. Remember that. And
[1:53:26] people, they don't want to hear about,
[1:53:27] you know, oh well, you got to live that
[1:53:28] kind of way. Oh, you gota uh you you got
[1:53:31] to pay tithes.
[1:53:33] How much? Really? Wow. You know, like
[1:53:37] like I I I'm an executive, man. I make
[1:53:39] $300,000. You want me to give you 30?
[1:53:41] No. No. No. No. No. No.
[1:53:43] You know they no they haven't seen the
[1:53:46] light
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; because the light is Christ in you. Your
[1:53:50] hope of glory. He ch he is your
[1:53:52] prosperity. He is your future. He is
[1:53:55] everything. Amen. He says for everyone
[1:53:58] that doeth evil hateth the light.
[1:54:01] Neither cometh to the light lest his
[1:54:04] deeds should be reproved.
[1:54:07] So what am I saying here? What's the
[1:54:09] word saying? You're not going to convert
[1:54:11] everybody. You're not going to you're
[1:54:13] not people are most people are not going
[1:54:15] to receive the light
[1:54:18] because it's a light for this age
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; and it's not an easy light to accept and
[1:54:23] to receive. You've got to be you've got
[1:54:26] to be uh prepared ground for this kind
[1:54:29] of light.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; You got to be prepared to receive this
[1:54:34] kind of faith to cause your life to go
[1:54:36] into complete uh turmoil. Amen. Praise
[1:54:40] God. Hallelujah.
[1:54:42] Amen.
[1:54:44] So here now let's go to our next slide.
[1:54:48] We're winding this down now.
[1:54:52] We want to see here, you know that this
[1:54:55] darkness that is in the world, it's
[1:54:59] darkness that you have been given the
[1:55:02] ability
[1:55:05] to expose.
[1:55:07] Your testimony, your walk with God, your
[1:55:11] experience with the word is light. And
[1:55:14] wherever you go, whatever you do, you
[1:55:17] will expose darkness. Wherever you go,
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; you're a shining light. But here, I want
[1:55:23] you to see here back in Genesis 3 where
[1:55:27] where God has has given us a clear
[1:55:30] understanding of what is going to happen
[1:55:33] in the last days. And the Lord God said
[1:55:35] unto the serpent, because thou has done
[1:55:37] this, thou art cursed above all cattle,
[1:55:40] and above every beast of the field. Upon
[1:55:42] thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt
[1:55:45] thou eat all the days of thy life. And I
[1:55:47] will put amnity between thee and the
[1:55:50] woman, and between thy seed and her
[1:55:52] seed. It shall bruise thy head, and thou
[1:55:55] shalt bruise his heel. No matter what,
[1:55:59] the enemy is going to oppose us.
[1:56:01] Understand that. What do you think's
[1:56:03] going on in Israel right now? They are
[1:56:06] under constant bombardment because the
[1:56:09] world is actually going to turn against
[1:56:11] her. And the whole world is going to
[1:56:13] turn against the word. It It's already
[1:56:16] rejecting the word for their day.
[1:56:19] There's only a few that can receive the
[1:56:22] message of this hour, to receive this
[1:56:24] word, and to allow it to reflect in
[1:56:26] their lives and to be able to have the
[1:56:28] courage to stand in a world like this
[1:56:32] where where homosexualism and and gender
[1:56:35] identities are are commonplace. You
[1:56:38] can't speak out against it here,
[1:56:40] especially in Canada. all these rights
[1:56:42] of the people, a place where where where
[1:56:45] you know where the word where the word
[1:56:47] it condemns all those things. It doesn't
[1:56:51] line up with the word of God. And
[1:56:52] because you are a reflection of that
[1:56:55] light and its truth, you cannot expect
[1:56:59] to be so easily ex accepted. You know,
[1:57:03] you you got to be careful of of how you
[1:57:06] handle yourself as a Christian, as a son
[1:57:09] or daughter of God. to be respectful in
[1:57:12] the way that you communicate and and and
[1:57:15] bring this word of God. Amen. But it
[1:57:18] doesn't change the word. The enemy w was
[1:57:21] there at the beginning. He's going to be
[1:57:24] here at the end, but God has given us
[1:57:27] the light to expose all of that
[1:57:29] darkness. No matter where it comes and
[1:57:31] shows up in our lives,
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; we're not to live in fear.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; Fear is another thing that steals your
[1:57:37] joy. Did you know that? Fear can steal
[1:57:39] your joy away when you're fearing this.
[1:57:41] Oh, I'm I'm I'm worried about this. I'm
[1:57:43] I'm so worried about my kids all the
[1:57:44] time. I Why don't you pray and place it
[1:57:46] into the hands of God?
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; Why don't you trust God for all those
[1:57:51] things in your life instead allowing
[1:57:53] fear to control your life and and and
[1:57:55] and and take away your your ability to
[1:57:58] be effective in the kingdom of God
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; with a confidence to stand and to shine
[1:58:03] this light in this hour. Amen.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; The enemy is going to try. He's going to
[1:58:07] do everything in his power to to but but
[1:58:11] there would listen the emnity is there
[1:58:13] between the two seeds. It was there back
[1:58:15] in the garden of Eden. Why do you think
[1:58:17] Cain killed his brother? Because Cain
[1:58:20] had the light of the hour. He had a
[1:58:22] revelation of what God required. It was
[1:58:25] a lamb. It wasn't fruit because he had
[1:58:27] received light on the coming of the Lord
[1:58:31] Jesus who would come many years down
[1:58:34] thousands of years down the road. God
[1:58:36] gave him the ability to recognize and so
[1:58:39] he was able to to to to please the Lord
[1:58:43] because he had faith.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; But Cain, the enemy, the one who will
[1:58:49] fight you, does not have the ability to
[1:58:52] receive revelation.
[1:58:54] Revelation is what has given you your
[1:58:56] confidence,
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; your courage, your ability,
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; the revelation of God in you,
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; Christ in you. This is the hour that
[1:59:08] we're living in. Amen. Glory to God.
[1:59:10] Amen. Hallelujah. And the Lord. And so
[1:59:14] here now, let's go to our next
[1:59:15] scripture. I want you to see here now in
[1:59:17] Romans chapter 16 verse 20. Notice what
[1:59:20] he says. And God and the God of peace
[1:59:23] shall bruise Satan under whose feet?
[1:59:27] Your feet. Your feet. You. The grace of
[1:59:31] our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
[1:59:34] God is telling us that he has given us
[1:59:37] the ability to put that darkness under
[1:59:41] our feet.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; The enemy shall not have control over
[1:59:45] our lives. You listen. If you've
[1:59:47] received the light of the hour and
[1:59:49] you're reflecting the light of the hour,
[1:59:51] that light is God himself. It's Christ
[1:59:54] in you. And everything you need to
[1:59:57] overcome is already prepared. It's
[2:00:00] already there. You just need to receive
[2:00:02] the light, reflect the light, and allow
[2:00:05] that light to be what he wants you to
[2:00:08] be. Listen, go to the next slide. John
[2:00:10] chapter 15:26-27. He says, "But when the
[2:00:13] comforter is come,
[2:00:15] whom I will send unto you from the
[2:00:18] father, even the spirit of truth which
[2:00:21] proceedth from the father, he shall
[2:00:24] testify of me. You don't have to worry.
[2:00:28] When the comforter comes into your life,
[2:00:30] you it's just going to come to you.
[2:00:33] Whatever you have need of will come to
[2:00:35] you. and ye also shall bear witness
[2:00:38] because ye have been with me from the
[2:00:41] beginning. Listen, like we said, he hath
[2:00:44] already predestinated you.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; When God was planning this whole plan of
[2:00:48] redemption, you were in his mind back
[2:00:51] then. That's what he's telling you here.
[2:00:52] You have been with me from the
[2:00:54] beginning. Jesus wasn't just talking to
[2:00:56] his disciples that were there. He was
[2:00:59] talking to the sons and daughters of God
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; who were in the mind of God who were
[2:01:04] going to be reflecting light in this age
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; that would be that would be a reflection
[2:01:09] of him that you were always there. He
[2:01:13] was going to send you the power the
[2:01:16] ability which is himself
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; to come and take control so that you can
[2:01:22] manifest him and be the manifestation of
[2:01:25] this hour. the purpose of God for this
[2:01:28] day and this hour.
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Amen. Let's read our
[2:01:34] quote here. There's a man here that can
[2:01:36] turn on the lights.
[2:01:39] So life is only by the word of God made
[2:01:42] manifest.
[2:01:44] So
[2:01:46] you receiving this message is not just
[2:01:49] to tickle your ears. It's for you to
[2:01:52] receive it so that it can live. so that
[2:01:56] it can manifest. The word of God made
[2:01:59] manifest is life. It's going to produce
[2:02:02] a life in you. You're either going to
[2:02:04] have a life that's going to go right
[2:02:06] back out there into the world and live
[2:02:07] according to the world and you're going
[2:02:09] to be drawn to the things of the world
[2:02:11] and your all your all your your
[2:02:13] temporary joy is going to be in the
[2:02:15] things of the world
[2:02:18] without a word birth. That's what
[2:02:20] happens.
[2:02:22] Life comes only by the word of God made
[2:02:24] manifest. As long as it's just in the
[2:02:26] book like this, it still can be
[2:02:29] questioned. But when it's made manifest,
[2:02:32] then you see then you see the product of
[2:02:35] what it spoke of being manifested. Then
[2:02:38] that is light on the word on you. Now
[2:02:42] you become a reflection of Jesus Christ
[2:02:46] in the present day that you're living
[2:02:48] in. Amen. See, that's what brings the
[2:02:51] word said so. And then when it comes to
[2:02:54] pass, that is life in light. Light
[2:02:58] bringing life. Light brings life.
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; So if you've received this word, you
[2:03:05] receive the message of the hour, you got
[2:03:07] to produce a life.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; There's got to be a life in you. There's
[2:03:11] got to be a desire for the word.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. That's what he does to
[2:03:17] you when you receive this light. And
[2:03:20] listen, he goes on here. Uh there's
[2:03:22] there's a man here that can turn on the
[2:03:24] light. He goes on, he says, "There's no
[2:03:25] two or three different lights. Let's get
[2:03:28] let's get rid of all the confusion,
[2:03:29] saints. We're not looking for two, three
[2:03:32] different interpretations on the word of
[2:03:33] God. No four or five different
[2:03:35] organizations. There was one light.
[2:03:38] There is not Methodist, Baptist,
[2:03:40] Lutheran, Presbyterian. Christ is the
[2:03:43] light
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; and the light is the life and the word
[2:03:46] manifested is the light of the hour.
[2:03:50] Amen. When you manifest God sent a
[2:03:54] prophet, when you manifest Malachi 4:5,
[2:03:57] when you manifest Revelations 10 1:7,
[2:04:01] when you start to manifest Revelations 8
[2:04:04] uh Revelations 10 8-11, when you start
[2:04:07] to receive this word, which is what
[2:04:10] you've been commissioned to do, is to
[2:04:12] take this word and not only take it, but
[2:04:15] speak it, manifest it into the people's
[2:04:18] hearts. speak the word of God for this
[2:04:20] day and for this hour. Let them know
[2:04:22] that God sent a prophet. Let them know
[2:04:24] that the seals are open. Let them know
[2:04:26] these things because the Holy Ghost will
[2:04:30] guide them to the truth.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost coming into your life
[2:04:34] will only bring you back to the word.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. saints, you know, like
[2:04:41] I know my ministry is constantly trying
[2:04:46] to reach and to to testify of what of
[2:04:50] what God is doing in this day and in
[2:04:52] this hour. We need to be present truth
[2:04:56] Christians.
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; Those that have a revelation of what God
[2:04:59] is doing right now. And we need to stand
[2:05:01] on one truth. There's not one, two,
[2:05:04] three different lights. We need to let
[2:05:06] the people know that the word of God is
[2:05:09] the truth.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; That there's a word to be manifest in
[2:05:12] this day and in this hour. Amen. Glory
[2:05:15] to God. Listen, go on here. Next slide.
[2:05:18] He's continuing here in things that are
[2:05:19] to be. He says, "The gene of life, the
[2:05:23] gene of your life, spiritual life
[2:05:25] tonight was in God the Father before it
[2:05:29] was even a molecule." See, you are
[2:05:32] nothing but the manifestation of the
[2:05:34] gene of life that was in God as a son of
[2:05:38] God. And now you are expressed
[2:05:42] after his word has come in you.
[2:05:46] Hallelujah. Because you are a son or a
[2:05:49] daughter of God. Therefore, you get what
[2:05:51] I mean? Amen. See, you are in, you are
[2:05:56] now made, you are sitting in this church
[2:06:01] tonight, he says, but I'm telling you,
[2:06:02] you're sitting in this church today
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; because your duty is to express God to
[2:06:09] this nation, to this people, and to this
[2:06:13] neighborhood where we associate.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; This is the message of the hour. This is
[2:06:22] the light of our day.
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; This light has to manifest the purpose
[2:06:30] of God in you.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; You can't remain the same way that you
[2:06:35] are. You can't stay in the same
[2:06:37] condition that you are. You have to be
[2:06:40] under constant progress.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; You got to be on under constant e, you
[2:06:46] know, evolution. If you want to call it
[2:06:48] evolution, ev evolving into into a a
[2:06:52] manifested son of God that reflects
[2:06:55] Jesus Christ in the form of the bride,
[2:06:58] in the form of the church that that
[2:07:00] reflects the light of God's word, not
[2:07:03] some man-made teaching or oh, we are
[2:07:06] good neighbor ministries. Yes, we are
[2:07:08] good neighbor ministries here in
[2:07:10] Burlington, but we are a reflector of
[2:07:13] the word of God. We are reflecting the
[2:07:16] present truth for this day and for this
[2:07:19] hour. Amen. Glory to God. There is
[2:07:21] nothing more that we need than to
[2:07:25] receive the Holy Ghost for our day. And
[2:07:29] this is where we're going to continue uh
[2:07:31] next week. Amen. We're going to continue
[2:07:35] to uh look and to and to see what is the
[2:07:38] Holy Ghost because people are people are
[2:07:41] manifesting things thinking that it's
[2:07:44] the Holy Ghost, but they don't really
[2:07:45] realize what the Holy Ghost was sent
[2:07:47] for. And if you get a chance this week,
[2:07:51] go back and listen to the message. What
[2:07:53] is the Holy Ghost? Brother Brandham
[2:07:55] 1959.
[2:07:57] go back and listen to that message
[2:07:59] because there's a lot in there that
[2:08:01] Brother Brandham explains on what the
[2:08:03] Holy Ghost actually is and in this day
[2:08:06] and in this hour. And I'm telling you,
[2:08:08] there's people in this message, the
[2:08:10] majority of them are not recognizing
[2:08:12] what it is.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; Oh boy. Yeah. Well, let's see. Let's see
[2:08:19] what the Holy Spirit's going to reveal
[2:08:20] to us. Let the musicians come. Amen.
[2:08:23] Praise God. We want to know what what
[2:08:26] what the word is going to manifest in
[2:08:29] this day and in this hour. And when you
[2:08:31] come into the light of this day, it's
[2:08:34] going to manifest him.
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; You can't you can't be reflecting you
[2:08:38] anymore.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; You will be seen on the outside, but
[2:08:43] there'll be something living inside of
[2:08:45] you that's that's that's uh moving
[2:08:48] everything else aside. All your
[2:08:50] priorities are are are changing. Listen,
[2:08:52] we're getting too close to that time,
[2:08:54] saints. God is God is perfecting this
[2:08:57] bride. How's he going to perfect it? By
[2:08:59] the five-fold ministry. God is going to
[2:09:02] God is going to draw things out of our
[2:09:03] lives that need to be rooted out of our
[2:09:06] lives. God's going to expose things in
[2:09:08] our lives that need to be exposed
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; because this is the time where the light
[2:09:13] takes control and re and and starts to
[2:09:16] to to to uh scour out all the darkness
[2:09:20] in our lives.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; And if you have a true desire for the
[2:09:23] word of God, then you want darkness to
[2:09:26] leave you.
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; You don't want to carry that that that
[2:09:29] burden anymore. You want the joy of the
[2:09:31] Lord. Don't you want the joy of the Lord
[2:09:32] back in your life? Don't you want to be
[2:09:35] living a a a victorious life for Christ?
[2:09:38] Something that where you know that that
[2:09:41] uh
[2:09:42] you've got it. You're not you're not
[2:09:45] guessing. You're not you're not just

[2:14:18] Amen.
[2:14:19] God bless you. You can be seated for
[2:14:21] just a moment. Uh it's testimony time.
[2:14:25] We have a testimony. Is this Is this
[2:14:26] Natasha? Sister Natasha. Okay. Come.
[2:14:29] Come. And uh she'd like to give a
[2:14:31] testimony. So, praise the Lord. I can
[2:14:34] give a testimony this morning that God
[2:14:37] spoke to me. God not only spoke to me
[2:14:40] but further uh identified who I am.
[2:14:44] That's my testimony this morning. God
[2:14:46] bless you.
[2:14:49] God bless you saints.
[2:14:52] I just want to give God thanks for
[2:14:54] bringing me here today because I'm going
[2:14:57] to go back a little bit. When I had my
[2:14:59] first son 27 years ago,
[2:15:02] um I came home from the hospital and all
[2:15:05] was well. I was happy. Few days later, I
[2:15:08] found myself back in the hospital unable
[2:15:10] to walk for a week, paralyzed from the
[2:15:12] waist down. And from then, it's been
[2:15:14] like a real battle with my back. Been to
[2:15:18] the hospital several times. They did so
[2:15:20] many different things. They came to a
[2:15:22] conclusion there was nothing they could
[2:15:23] do.
[2:15:25] So I just kept kept on um trusting God,
[2:15:30] believing that in his time he will do it
[2:15:33] for me. Then it started with my knees.
[2:15:37] About two years ago, the doctor told me
[2:15:39] that um I'm going to need double knee
[2:15:41] replacement.
[2:15:44] So I say, you know what, Lord, I'm going
[2:15:46] to trust you and I'm going to wait on
[2:15:47] you. I'm not going to rush into the
[2:15:49] surgery. They wanted to set up a
[2:15:50] schedule for me to get a knee surgery
[2:15:52] and everything. But I trusted God and he
[2:15:54] say I'm just going to wait. And it's
[2:15:56] been a battle. Even when we have like
[2:15:57] the um washing of the saints feet, I
[2:15:59] have to use a chair because I cannot go
[2:16:01] down on my knees. Even this morning when
[2:16:04] I got up, I had to go stand under the
[2:16:06] hot water to run on my back just so I'll
[2:16:09] be able to walk to come here. But I
[2:16:11] didn't give up. Couple weeks ago, I went
[2:16:15] to the doctor and I had some X-rays done
[2:16:18] on my knees.
[2:16:20] I'll just leave that there for now.
[2:16:24] Coming up towards the meetings, I've
[2:16:26] been praying about the meetings and
[2:16:27] praying about different situations.
[2:16:30] And I said to the Lord, "No matter what,
[2:16:34] Lord, I will stand for you. No matter
[2:16:36] what, I would not give up. I will stand
[2:16:38] for you." And the devil heard that. and
[2:16:41] did the ever come in like a flood
[2:16:44] within the space of one and a half week.
[2:16:46] I had eight losses in my family. Eight
[2:16:49] people died at a certain time. I was
[2:16:52] afraid to pick up the phone in one day.
[2:16:54] My mom called me in the morning. My
[2:16:56] uncle daughter passed away. That really
[2:16:59] cut me deep because we did everything
[2:17:01] together. We grew up together. We did
[2:17:03] everything together. So that really hit
[2:17:04] home.
[2:17:06] Later around the evening, the phone rang
[2:17:08] again. And my phone don't usually ring
[2:17:09] like that in the day. Sometimes I have
[2:17:11] to pick it up to see if it's working.
[2:17:13] And I got a call again and it was my
[2:17:16] sister. My uncle's um um son passed
[2:17:19] away. So in one day, two of them. And
[2:17:22] within a space the space of one and a
[2:17:25] half week, nine people they just dropped
[2:17:28] down. I don't know what happened. But I
[2:17:30] kept on trusting God. I said, you know
[2:17:32] what, father? I said, no matter what, I
[2:17:33] would trust you. I said, "The Lord give
[2:17:35] and the Lord take. Blessed be the name
[2:17:37] of the Lord." He came up to the meetings
[2:17:40] and we had a wonderful time. Rejoice.
[2:17:43] We left here on my way home. I met some
[2:17:46] people below a tree fellowshipping and
[2:17:48] having fun and praising God. I turned my
[2:17:50] car around, went and parked it up and I
[2:17:52] joined them. We sang, we danced, we
[2:17:54] praised the Lord together. I went home.
[2:17:57] I got home and I was looking for my
[2:17:59] little cats everywhere. I couldn't find
[2:18:01] her. She fell to her death. The trials
[2:18:05] just kept on coming and coming. But I
[2:18:07] say, "Father, I would trust you." I
[2:18:09] cried because I was very attached to
[2:18:11] her. I cried. I went, I buried her. I
[2:18:14] came back. I said, "Father, you know
[2:18:16] why? The Lord give and the Lord take.
[2:18:18] Blessed be the name of the Lord." So the
[2:18:21] devil felt like that wasn't enough. He
[2:18:23] started attacking my back, attacking my
[2:18:25] knees, attacking everything. Then I
[2:18:27] remembered when I went to the doctor um
[2:18:30] couple weeks ago, the doctor said to me,
[2:18:34] I don't know why they said that you
[2:18:35] needed double knee replacements because
[2:18:38] I'm looking at this new X-rays and it's
[2:18:40] not showing that. So I give the Lord
[2:18:42] thanks for that. And I say, you know
[2:18:44] what, there is one thing I'm going to
[2:18:45] change. And I remember one of the
[2:18:46] brothers said couple weeks ago, the most
[2:18:49] dangerous Christian you can get is one
[2:18:51] on the knees. And that's why the devil
[2:18:53] came after me because before I was lying
[2:18:56] on my back and praying saying that I
[2:18:58] cannot go on my knees but I found a way.
[2:19:00] I put a bench in front of my um bed and
[2:19:03] I started kneeling on that bench and
[2:19:05] from there the attack started within
[2:19:08] within the as I said within a week and a
[2:19:10] half nine people because I changed the
[2:19:13] way I prayed. I went on my knees and I
[2:19:15] started praying and the battle kept on
[2:19:17] raging. But in all of that I found a way
[2:19:20] to go on my knees and to praise God. And
[2:19:21] I'm just want to encourage you, no
[2:19:24] matter what, get on your knees because a
[2:19:26] a Christian underneath is a dangerous
[2:19:29] Christian to the devil. So I want to
[2:19:31] give God thanks this morning. Even on my
[2:19:33] way here, I was dragging to get here.
[2:19:36] When I got in the basement, I had to
[2:19:38] start talking out and reminding the
[2:19:40] devil who I am.
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; And I started talking out loud. And my
[2:19:44] daughter was looking at me like, you
[2:19:46] know, but I had to talk out loud and
[2:19:48] remind him and started claiming my
[2:19:50] healing. And before you know it, I was
[2:19:52] able to sit down. I'm able to walk
[2:19:53] properly. I'm able to come here and I'm
[2:19:55] just want to give the Lord thanks for
[2:19:57] great things that he has done.
[2:20:03] [Music]
[2:20:04] Amen.
[2:20:06] Well, I went to the enemy's camp and I
[2:20:11] took back what he stole from me. I took
[2:20:16] back what he stole from me. I took back
[2:20:20] what he stole from me. I went to the
[2:20:24] enemy's hand and I took back what he
[2:20:29] stole from me. He's under my feet. He's
[2:20:33] under my feet. He's under my feet. He's
[2:20:37] under my feet. Satan is under my feet.
[2:20:42] Again, one more time. Oh, yes. Heat.
[2:20:44] Heat. Heat.

[2:21:13] He's under my feet. Satan is under my
[2:21:18] feet.
[2:21:22] Amen.

[2:21:25] statement now. Is that okay? We're going
[2:21:27] to have uh Sister Peace and Sister uh
[2:21:30] Sarah Hope come up. And the last time
[2:21:33] these two were up on this stage, what a
[2:21:37] wonderful special they gave last Do you

[2:21:42] Wow. Last Sunday. But God bless them as

[2:23:00] comes a night.

[2:25:46] lying there.
[2:25:51] Little girl was lying there.
[2:25:55] The people all were weeping.
[2:25:59] They just laughed at Jesus when he said,
[2:26:03] "She's only sleeping."
[2:26:06] As he took her by the hand,
[2:26:10] she began to live again.
[2:26:13] Some begin to praise the Lord. Some
[2:26:17] begin to say,
[2:26:23] "Oh, he's in the house
[2:26:27] and death has to flee.
[2:26:31] Now there is life.
[2:26:34] Where darkness used to be, now there is
[2:26:39] hope.

[2:26:51] For he's in the house.
[2:26:57] And we're like that little girl.

[2:27:07] me life again.
[2:27:10] I'm just a house of clay.
[2:27:14] Ever since that blessed day, there's a
[2:27:17] light that shines in me for all the
[2:27:21] world to see.
