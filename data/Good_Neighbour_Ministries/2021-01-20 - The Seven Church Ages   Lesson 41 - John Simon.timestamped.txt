[0:15] what then
[0:17] what then when the great
[0:21] book is open what then
[0:25] when the ones that's rejecting
[0:29] this message today
[0:32] will be asked to give a reason
[0:36] what then yes my friends
[0:40] what then we will all have to make our
[0:44] choices
[0:45] now the question is being asked
[0:49] heaven or hell christ or
[0:52] chaos i ask you tonight
[0:56] as i come in the name of the lord that
[0:58] you will receive the word of the lord
[1:02] of course we are teaching on the
[1:05] doctrine
[1:06] of hell and the
[1:09] topic is is hell
[1:12] really eternal
[1:16] i shall now read from the book of
[1:18] revelation chapter 2
[1:21] verse 11
[1:25] he that had an ear to hear
[1:28] let him hear what the spirit said
[1:32] unto the churches he that overcometh
[1:36] shall not be hurt of the second
[1:40] death amen gracious father we
[1:44] thank thee for the reading of the word
[1:47] and we ask that you will direct her
[1:49] thoughts
[1:51] in the streams of thought and channels
[1:53] where you desire us to be
[1:56] we surrender ourselves to the for
[1:58] service
[2:00] and those that should be online
[2:03] listening watching or perchance
[2:07] clicking on this broadcast may the
[2:10] great holy spirit capture their
[2:13] attention
[2:15] to the word take all the glory honor and
[2:18] praise
[2:19] in jesus name amen praise
[2:22] god hallelujah he that had an
[2:25] ear to hear let him hear
[2:30] what the spirit says unto the churches
[2:36] he that overcome it shall not be
[2:39] hurt of this second death
[2:43] now this is the spirit of god speaking
[2:47] this is the great holy spirit speaking
[2:51] and he is not speaking just to our age
[2:55] but he is speaking to saints
[2:58] of all the ages all
[3:01] of the church ages are included
[3:05] in this statement and
[3:08] this uh saying is to give us
[3:12] comfort in this time
[3:16] back then they needed it in our day
[3:20] right now we need it we need comfort
[3:24] we need his strength we need his
[3:26] guidance
[3:28] and we need to know that he is standing
[3:31] near
[3:32] with us he is saying to us
[3:36] don't you fear don't fear the second
[3:40] death
[3:41] in other words there is no hell in your
[3:45] future
[3:46] if you are a true believer
[3:50] a genuine born-again son
[3:53] or daughter of god a child of the king
[3:57] there is no hell whatsoever
[4:01] in your future don't even
[4:05] think of of hell it is now
[4:08] out of the picture he has blotted out
[4:12] every handwriting of every ordinance
[4:15] every guilt every shame and you are made
[4:19] justified by the grace of god
[4:22] and now you're headed to your father's
[4:25] house
[4:26] where there is joy and peace forevermore
[4:30] hallelujah of course we know
[4:33] the second death is the lake of fire
[4:39] remember jesus made the great statement
[4:43] don't you fear him that can kill your
[4:46] body
[4:48] but oh fear him that can kill
[4:52] both body and soul
[4:56] so he is speaking of the second death
[4:59] he's speaking of the death of a soul
[5:02] he is sticky he's speaking of the expiry
[5:07] of a soul the extinguishing
[5:10] of a soul this is what he's speaking you
[5:13] will
[5:14] not be able to be extinguished
[5:18] you will not be your life will never be
[5:20] able to be
[5:21] ended your soul cannot be
[5:24] wiped away by this second death it can't
[5:28] be
[5:28] burnt up it there's nothing that satan
[5:31] can
[5:32] do that can destroy your soul
[5:36] if you are a child of god
[5:39] there is no hell in the future
[5:43] of the true believer blessed be the name
[5:46] of the lord
[5:48] revelation 20 14
[5:52] and death and hell were cast
[5:56] into the lake of fire this
[5:59] is the second death you see because the
[6:02] grave claimed your
[6:04] your natural body and here
[6:07] your soul is claimed by those hellish
[6:11] nature and it's all thrown into hell
[6:15] death and hell thrown into the lake of
[6:17] fire
[6:18] or praise god hallelujah amen
[6:22] friends i tell you this is marvelous
[6:25] we can stand there for uh
[6:29] tonight upon the infallible unchanging
[6:34] authority of the word of god
[6:37] and say the believer does
[6:41] not go to an eternal hell
[6:45] to burn there eternally may i repeat
[6:49] this
[6:51] the believer does not go
[6:55] to an eternal hell to burn
[6:58] there eternally
[7:01] it is not in your future
[7:05] it is not in the book it can be
[7:08] found nowhere in the word
[7:12] of god amen in the first place
[7:16] hell itself is not eternal
[7:20] i repeat hell itself
[7:24] is not eternal
[7:27] or the lake of fire is
[7:30] not eternal it can't be eternal
[7:35] for it has a beginning it is written
[7:38] in matthew chapter 25 verse 41. how
[7:44] that hell everlasting fire
[7:48] was prepared for the devil
[7:52] and his angels this is not for the
[7:55] children of god
[7:56] not for the sons and daughters of god
[8:00] not for his beloved it is not for his
[8:03] elect
[8:04] it is not for the ones whom he loves and
[8:08] cares for
[8:09] it is for the devil and his angels
[8:13] were all his unbelieving associates
[8:17] hell was prepared for the devil
[8:21] and all of his own
[8:24] now we know that if it was prepared then
[8:27] it had a beginning
[8:29] it had to have a beginning and therefore
[8:32] hell cannot be
[8:34] eternal for the bible says it was
[8:37] prepared
[8:38] it had a beginning and if it has a
[8:40] beginning
[8:41] it follows it must have an
[8:45] end amen well
[8:48] some some will rise up and say
[8:52] well brother simon that sounds
[8:55] uh very uh simplistic and
[8:58] and you can say that and i can say
[9:01] something else and
[9:03] we can all have our own truth but we are
[9:06] not here to have our own truth
[9:08] we are here to believe god's truth god's
[9:11] word
[9:12] the only truth that will stand
[9:15] forever and stand the tests of time
[9:19] for heaven and earth will pass away
[9:22] but my word will never pass away
[9:27] amen now some will say
[9:30] the word everlasting really also me
[9:33] means eternal but you see everlasting
[9:38] only means ages to ages
[9:42] times and times and times
[9:45] that is what it means ages and ages
[9:50] you see because in first samuel
[9:54] god told samuel he was going to
[9:57] judge the house of eli
[10:01] forever but we know that doesn't mean
[10:06] that he will be there forever
[10:09] eternally at the house judging over the
[10:13] house
[10:14] of eli second kings 2 27
[10:18] the solomon trust out the last
[10:20] descendants of eli
[10:22] from the priesthood and that was like
[10:24] four
[10:25] generations later that
[10:28] that actually took place so the word
[10:32] everlasting
[10:34] does not mean eternal neither does it
[10:38] compare with the word eternal
[10:42] for eternal means without
[10:46] a beginning and with no
[10:49] ending amen
[10:53] now if you want to come back to the real
[10:55] meaning of everlasting
[10:57] it means to the vanishing point
[11:01] amen in other words the
[11:04] god will deal with them until they have
[11:07] vanished away
[11:09] completely gone
[11:12] now another word that is brought up is
[11:15] the word destruction
[11:17] ii thessalonians 1 9 who
[11:20] shall be punished with
[11:24] everlasting destruction
[11:27] now everlasting destruction
[11:30] has nothing to do with the eternal
[11:34] for as i have said everlasting means
[11:37] for ages and ages but there
[11:40] is an ending to that means from ages to
[11:44] ages
[11:46] now in the greek the word destruction
[11:50] does not need destroying
[11:54] destruction not destroying
[11:57] constantly burning destroying burning
[12:01] and destroying like that but destruction
[12:04] in the greek means annihilation
[12:12] so it doesn't mean destroying
[12:16] see destroying means until the point
[12:20] of decay or to be
[12:24] completely destroyed and so on
[12:28] it means it doesn't mean that it keeps
[12:31] being
[12:32] annihilated keeps being destroyed
[12:35] over and over and over
[12:38] again see so the word is used
[12:43] everlasting ages to ages
[12:46] destruction to the vanishing point
[12:50] or in other words you will be destroyed
[12:53] maybe over a period of so many ages
[12:57] but you will be destroyed to the
[12:59] vanishing point
[13:01] fear not him that can kill the body
[13:04] but fear him that can kill both
[13:08] body and soul
[13:11] o praise god when the word
[13:14] eternal is used it always
[13:18] and should apply to god
[13:22] for god is the one without the beginning
[13:26] without an ending and he
[13:29] is elohim the eternal one
[13:34] the great eternal spirit that created
[13:38] all things the one with love
[13:41] serve and worship elohim
[13:45] he is eternal nothing else
[13:48] like hell is eternal oh
[13:51] praise god forevermore all glory to his
[13:54] name
[13:55] therefore friends since
[13:58] everlasting destruction does not
[14:02] mean being destroyed over and over again
[14:05] and tormented over and over again
[14:10] then we understand that there is
[14:14] no uh no purgatory
[14:19] there is no such a thing in your bible
[14:23] search the scriptures in them you
[14:26] think you'll have eternal life there is
[14:29] no
[14:30] such a thing as purgatory there uh
[14:33] therefore there is no need for
[14:36] indulgences
[14:37] there is no need for you to uh
[14:40] pay some a man a religious
[14:44] man a person to pray you your way
[14:48] out of purgatory therefore there is
[14:51] no place as purgatory
[14:55] in this bible it's not in the scriptures
[14:59] and it is a figment of man's imagination
[15:02] and a creation of the perverted
[15:04] religious minds
[15:06] that has brought such a doctrine on the
[15:10] face
[15:10] of the earth no need for indulgences
[15:14] if that was the case then the richer a
[15:18] man
[15:18] got then if he had enough money he could
[15:21] buy bribe or pay his way out of hell
[15:26] he could just pay for the right prayers
[15:29] and
[15:29] he would get scot-free so then
[15:32] the world would be in chaos every man
[15:35] will do what is right in his own sight
[15:38] uh believing that at the end of the way
[15:41] he has enough money
[15:42] and so he'll be able to pay uh the
[15:45] preacher
[15:46] pay the priest or pay the the the
[15:48] clergyman
[15:49] uh enough money and and he can say
[15:52] prayer
[15:53] and pray you out of hell or
[15:56] purgatory my friends
[15:59] there is no one trapped
[16:03] in an intermediary state at this
[16:06] present time so we must understand there
[16:10] is no intermediary state
[16:14] where people are burning
[16:18] and burning in a boiling
[16:21] pot of lava and screaming and crying
[16:25] and then as uh john
[16:29] spoke to martin luther and said
[16:32] oh if you can see your beloved
[16:36] mother burning in the fire and screaming
[16:40] but oh just if you were to give some
[16:43] coppers
[16:44] as soon as the coin hits the bottom of
[16:47] that
[16:48] pot a prayer goes up to god and your
[16:51] mother rises up out of hell
[16:53] what kind of uh fantastic
[16:57] religious fairy tales are being told
[17:02] in the name of christ there is
[17:05] no one burning burning burning burning
[17:10] in an intermediary state in a place
[17:14] called hell and having to be prayed
[17:18] out of there neither can anyone
[17:21] pay their way out
[17:25] neither can anyone bribe their way out
[17:30] none can buy their way out
[17:34] only by the grace of god
[17:37] only by salvation now
[17:41] you choose this day whom you will serve
[17:46] this is the hour this is the time
[17:49] this is the day we must choose make up
[17:52] our minds
[17:53] make our choice go down in humility to
[17:57] the valley of decision
[17:59] and ask god to forgive you of your sins
[18:02] cleanse you make you whole
[18:05] go and get baptized or come and get
[18:08] baptized
[18:09] in water in the name not in the titles
[18:13] of fathers and holy ghosts
[18:15] but in the name of the lord jesus christ
[18:18] and you shall receive the gift of the
[18:21] holy ghost
[18:22] for the promises on to you and unto your
[18:25] children
[18:26] and unto your children's children even
[18:29] as many as the lord our god
[18:32] shall call oh blessed be his holy name
[18:36] amen hallelujah think of it
[18:39] friends when we talk of the eternal
[18:43] life we speak of the words eternal life
[18:48] we are really speaking about god
[18:52] and when we speak about having eternal
[18:55] life in
[18:55] us we are speaking about the eternal
[18:59] god coming into our lives
[19:02] and making us his dwelling place
[19:07] listen this is the record
[19:10] that god has given us eternal life
[19:14] and that life is in
[19:18] his son he that at the son
[19:23] at life amen
[19:26] oh praise god you see only the
[19:30] children of god has eternal life
[19:37] for to have eternal life is to have a
[19:41] part of god in you which will then
[19:45] make you as eternal as
[19:48] god is eternal of course your flesh is
[19:52] not eternal but your soul
[19:55] is eternal then you wake up to the fact
[20:00] to recognize that if you have
[20:04] eternal life or you claim you have
[20:07] eternal life
[20:08] now then there uh you now come to the
[20:12] consciousness of it
[20:14] but it means that you eternal means
[20:17] without the beginning and
[20:21] without an ending
[20:24] amen and so the one that is in you
[20:30] is the spirit of almighty god
[20:33] the same one that moved on the face of
[20:36] the waters
[20:38] and called for the earth to come forth
[20:42] called for the the the birds the
[20:45] the animals the fish the sea the sun
[20:48] or to comfort at his word
[20:51] that same spirit of god has
[20:54] come dwells in your life and is calling
[20:58] forth fruits of the spirit
[21:00] from this tree o praise god
[21:04] and here we are bearing fruits
[21:07] of that spirit that lives in us
[21:11] by the rivers of living waters oh glory
[21:14] to god hallelujah
[21:15] amen glory to god oh my
[21:19] i'd like to make another point here
[21:24] if hell is eternal
[21:28] then the sinner will then have to be
[21:31] eternal
[21:33] to suffer eternally
[21:36] in an eternal hell
[21:40] that means he has the same kind of life
[21:45] in him like the true believer
[21:48] has oh my
[21:53] so then we will then reduce the second
[21:57] debt
[21:59] to punishment and
[22:02] place place and
[22:05] punishment but to my understanding by
[22:09] the bible
[22:10] eternal life means you go to heaven
[22:14] eternal punishment means you're
[22:17] going to hell and if that is so
[22:23] and such a doctrine is being
[22:26] taught by great exalted
[22:30] uh scholarly uh intellectual
[22:34] smart doctors of divinity theologians
[22:38] phds all kinds of degrees
[22:41] teaching doctrines like that of
[22:45] men and women people going to a
[22:48] sinner's hell to burn
[22:51] their eternity
[22:54] then if we had to take that thought
[22:58] then hell will only be a place uh
[23:01] the difference will be of geography
[23:04] because let me say this again here is
[23:08] the christian having eternal life
[23:11] given by god to live
[23:14] in heaven and then here is the sinner
[23:19] with eternal life to burn eternally
[23:23] in hell my friends
[23:26] this is the thought then if
[23:29] that was the argumentations of our
[23:31] exalted theologians
[23:34] then we see it's nonsense for it makes
[23:38] hell
[23:39] uh and heaven just a matter of geography
[23:44] and not of the state
[23:47] and condition of the heart and
[23:50] soul of that person fear
[23:53] not him that can kill the body but fear
[23:57] him that can kill both body
[24:00] and soul just take so many theologians
[24:04] teach such a
[24:05] false doctrine that hell
[24:08] is an eternal place where uh
[24:12] a wicked person goes to burn
[24:15] eternally then you would have to have
[24:17] eternal life to burn
[24:19] in an eternal hell as such
[24:22] but that is unscriptural for only
[24:25] god is the author of eternal life
[24:29] and he only gives that life or has
[24:32] given that life to his children who are
[24:36] a part
[24:37] of him oh glory to god hallelujah
[24:41] and we know that eternal life
[24:47] it's not a matter of geography
[24:50] but eternal life is in fact is a person
[24:55] the tree of life is a person
[24:59] and the name of that person is the lord
[25:02] and savior jesus christ
[25:04] oh blessed be his marvelous and
[25:07] wonderful place i'm so glad eternal life
[25:11] is not a matter of place
[25:13] it's not a matter of geography for
[25:15] wherever i
[25:16] am that life lives in me god
[25:19] lives in you thanks be to god that he
[25:23] lives
[25:23] in our hearts forevermore amen praise
[25:27] god so it's not a matter of a place it's
[25:29] the matter of a person
[25:30] in your heart and in your life it's not
[25:33] being in the cathedral
[25:34] it's having christ in you oh praise god
[25:38] hallelujah
[25:39] it's not being at the altar it's not
[25:41] taking the host
[25:42] it's not any of those things it's having
[25:45] the person
[25:46] of christ living in you oh praise
[25:50] god forevermore my friends if you are
[25:52] not certain
[25:54] that christ lives in your heart by faith
[25:57] no other person none other
[26:00] doesn't matter how holy how blessed they
[26:03] are
[26:04] or whatever only one person
[26:07] can give you and is eternal life
[26:10] and that is jesus christ our lord
[26:14] whom we need within our hearts
[26:17] and our lives god is eternal
[26:21] and he lives in us by faith
[26:25] and because he lives we live
[26:29] because he is eternal we are
[26:32] eternal praise be to his holy name
[26:36] amen glory to god i don't know how long
[26:41] the lake of fire will last
[26:45] i don't know but revelation
[26:48] 21 8 says that
[26:52] if all sinners will have their
[26:55] part in the lake
[26:58] of fire now the true interpretation of
[27:02] that word
[27:02] english we say they will have their part
[27:06] in the lake of fire the true
[27:09] interpretation says
[27:10] they will have their time
[27:14] in the lake of fire
[27:17] so the wicked will be cast into hell my
[27:20] friends there is no cert
[27:22] doubt about that that's a fact the
[27:25] wicked
[27:25] will be turned into hell amen
[27:30] and then hell will be cast
[27:33] into the lake of fire a place
[27:37] of separation from god what a
[27:40] horrible place to be what a
[27:44] thing to contemplate
[27:48] when your end will come and you're
[27:50] gasping for breath
[27:52] when you could hardly move my friends
[27:56] be sure your soul will
[27:59] sail away to the right place i know for
[28:03] the christian
[28:04] paul has said we have this assurance
[28:08] absent from the body we're present with
[28:11] the lord
[28:12] all glory be to his name he said i am
[28:15] persuaded
[28:17] that he is able to keep that which i
[28:20] have committed unto him
[28:22] against that wonderful and that
[28:25] marvelous
[28:26] day oh glory to god hallelujah amen
[28:30] amen praise god the righteous
[28:33] has no hell in the future they don't
[28:37] fear hell
[28:38] they overcome that second death already
[28:42] because god lives in them and
[28:45] they he that live it and believeth in me
[28:48] though he die in his flesh yet shall he
[28:51] live in his soul wow for he
[28:54] is a lie forever more glory to
[28:58] god hallelujah and we don't have to fear
[29:02] because we've been redeemed by god
[29:05] we've been loved by god we've been
[29:08] redeemed by god
[29:10] and we are in his bosom and that
[29:13] makes us more than conquerors
[29:16] through him that loves us
[29:20] lord god hallelujah when we
[29:23] sinned are we were sinners we had
[29:27] a great gulf fix but thank
[29:30] god jesus christ came into our life
[29:33] and became the bridge of life and he
[29:36] bridged the gap
[29:37] and brought us back into sweet
[29:40] fellowship
[29:41] with god in the evening time oh glory to
[29:44] god forevermore
[29:46] we who were afar off
[29:49] are now made nigh through the precious
[29:52] blood
[29:53] of our lord jesus christ thank god as
[29:56] the song says
[29:57] he ran trump me he ransomed me
[30:01] yes jesus has ransomed us
[30:04] now the word ransom
[30:08] is just like saying redeemed
[30:13] he ransomed or redeemed me
[30:16] now when some years ago i was
[30:19] in the southern sudan and that was a
[30:23] time
[30:24] where people were
[30:27] caught many hundreds and thousands were
[30:31] caught
[30:32] and enslaved however there were
[30:36] wonderful men of god here in north
[30:38] america
[30:40] uh one of them carl brumback and
[30:44] uh from the great crossroads
[30:48] uh meeting place and others
[30:51] many other evangelists in the united
[30:54] states
[30:55] that pooled a lot of money
[30:58] and went over into africa
[31:01] and hazarded their lives to go into
[31:05] the uh jungles or deserts
[31:09] and meet the captors
[31:12] meet these people bargain with them
[31:15] and paid the ransom or paid the
[31:19] redemption
[31:20] price and brought those
[31:23] poor people out of their
[31:26] captivity and of their enslavement
[31:30] oh thanks be to god my brother my sister
[31:34] we were in the same position and
[31:37] condition
[31:38] we were enslaved by sin we were enslaved
[31:41] by
[31:42] habits we were bound by vice we were
[31:45] bound by our own sake
[31:47] and everything else but thank god then
[31:50] jesus came
[31:52] and when jesus came oh
[31:55] all our troubles he began to wipe away
[31:58] he bought us he paid for us he redeemed
[32:02] us
