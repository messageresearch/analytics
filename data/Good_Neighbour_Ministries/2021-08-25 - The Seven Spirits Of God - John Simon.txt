TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good evening friends once again we're happy to be in the house of the lord giving him all praise honor and glory amen here we are on another wednesday evening to spend a delightful time in the presence of our lord jesus amen let me read our scripture revelation chapter 3 verse 1 these things saith he that had the seven spirits of god and seven stars my topic for tonight will be the seven spirits of god may this bless your heart and your soul god bless you so much and may he share his grace upon us as we go into the storehouse and unlock the marvelous unsearchable treasures of the riches of god amen praise god as in the other ages here we are presented with the beautiful uh picture of christ himself the lord jesus is presenting himself and revealing himself to his own his beloved wife his church praise god hallelujah he sets forth his marvelous attributes while standing in the midst of the church of god and we know that he holds in his hands the seven star messengers that he has used through the seven church ages hallelujah now this phrase that we have just read about the seven spirits of god are found in the book of revelation at least four times mentioned would you like to place this in your notebook if not remember them revelation chapter 1 verse 4 from the seven spirits which are before the throne revelation 3 1 these things said he that hacked this seven spirits revelation 4 5 and out of the throne proceeded lightnings thunders thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps as a fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of god revelation 5 6 and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders a lamb as it had been slain with seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god set forth into all the earth now of course these verses are not contrary in any way to the word of god for we know the lord god is one lord but here now we have the mentioning of seven spirits of the living god well god is one spirit first corinthians 12 8 to 11. here we find one spirit of god manifesting himself in nine different ways with the nine gifts of the spirit of almighty god so when we say seven spirits of god seven is the number of course of perfection perfections of god seven spirits it means it's the one and the same spirit manifesting himself in seven ways seven fall ways glory to god now notice carefully the designations in revelation chapter 4 verse 5 note carefully these seven spirits are also called laps of fire lamps of fire burning before the lord well you know john always used old testament symbols uh as uh he might may have used the symbolism of the golden candlestick with the seven branches in the temple lamps of fire burning lamps of fire and when we go to proverbs 20 verse 27 remember i repeat proverbs 20 verse 27 the spirit of man is the lamp of the lord i repeat the spirit of man is the lamp of the lord now so we now find that these seven spirits are associated with man god doing something with man john the baptist in john chapter 5 verse 35 he was called that he was a burning and a shining light to the glory of god hallelujah and again revelation chapter 5 verse 6 the seven spirits of god are also identified as seven eyes in zechariah 4 10 zechariah 4 10 for who had despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of the rubble bell amen with those seven they are the eyes of the lord now it is very clear and evident to us that these words refer to men seven men who would be the eyes of the lord in the earth manifesting seven fall glory seven attributes seven manifestations of this spirit of the living god or the holy spirit amen we see the eyes of the lord and these men of course there will have to be men full of the holy ghost anointed use of him amen and their ministries will have to be a manifestation of god revealing his divine power glory to his holy name now friends putting our scriptural discoveries together it is evident that these seven spirits of god refer to the continuous ministry continuous or continual ministry of the holy spirit through the various ages in the lives of seven men which whom god ha will and has identified himself with them closely so that anyone could recognize no man can do these miracles except god be with him no man can say these things and put forth these truths except god be in him no man can foretell these things thousands and thousands of times without one mistake except god be with him these seven they are the eyes of the lord that run it swiftly throughout the whole earth god are investigating for the coming judgment amen seeing the events of us of a of an age through the eyes of the messenger god being able to see and observe these things firsthand and using these men as his eyes amen praise be to god they're called his eyes they're called his lamps amen and they're called the seven stars of god hallelujah which we already know represents the seven messengers of revelation one two chapter one two and three in there we see the seven messengers to the seven churches that were in asia minor which was really like a nursery uh to tell us give us an indication of what was to come and what would be made manifest in the ages to come the ages of the church throughout its uh its uh manifestation amen it's existence glory to god hallelujah amen yes sir and so god calls them seven stars which means you know like a star a star gives forth its light by reflecting the light of the sun after that the sun has gone down now you can of course recognize there the star natural reflects the light of the s-u-n after that the s-u-n has gone down and these star messengers of god reflect the light of the word the light of the s-o-n amen back into the church age after that the word seems to have been rejected after that the sun has gone down oh praise god forevermore amen hallelujah so the messenger to each church age is typified or symbolized in the form of a bright and shining star to reflect the light of the sun and they did this all by the power of the blessed holy spirit now what have we learned in those few remarks one we have learned that these men represent the seven spirits of god amen which is the ministry of the continuous ministry of continual ministry of the one holy spirit manifesting himself in seven ways the seven spirits of god man of continuous intercession men who stand in the gap with the word of god declaring it to their age without fear or favor and usually they always go beyond the camp they never stay within the confines of a denomination even if there were in one but like he was crucified beyond the walls of jerusalem so is it his messengers always go beyond the camp to declare the word of god and the voice of god for their age they are also called seven lamps seven laps of revelation to bring light illumination amen to the church age in which they are sent god uses them with that spirit of revelation hallelujah oh my whether it be the just shall live by faith amen or whether it be it shall be light about the evening time and the past the glory you will surely find in the waterway is the light today buried in the precious name of jesus glory be to god hallelujah those seven men god used them as seven lamps to light up their age with the revelation of the abundant truth from the word of god hallelujah amen there also we have learned here they are also called the eyes the seven eyes the eyes of the lord god's seven eyes of discernment hallelujah to discern the spirits of man and to divide between truth and error right and wrong and to point you into god's provided way and directly back to the word of god they were used as i said as god the eyes of the lord speeding through the earth watching observing seeing the nature of the composition the interaction of the age and the people the nature of that age so these eyes eyes of discernment eyes that were used in being able to know what is to be restored after that they had searched out the lost things they could restore back to its original position whatever was out of place whatever was lost it could be restored by these seven men who were the eyes of the lord hallelujah and as i have said before they are also described with the designation of the seven stars of god seven stars of reflection that they can they're reflecting back not their own light for a star has no light of its own it reflects the light of the sun after that the sun has gone down and so god has used these men praise god hallelujah to to be able to declare his word amen and reflect the image the stature of jesus christ the perfect man god that was made manifest and fleshed praise god forevermore i'm so blessed we are so blessed that the last messenger has gone on but he left a storehouse filled with all manner of wonderful food where sons and daughters of god children of the most high can go and satisfy and fill their soul with the glory divine of the goodness and the riches of jesus christ amen hallelujah glory to god now we know the apostle paul was the first messenger as galatians 1 8 says if any angel any messenger of course any viker any no matter who he is any preacher anyone hallelujah if he preaches any other gospel other than what paul preached let him be accursed that is the word of god god puts a curse through the messenger the first messenger the apostle paul of the ephesian church age god places a curse on anyone who preaches anything different than what paul preached amen paul knew that after he left the scene grievous wolves would creep in in the midst of the church there would be demonic invasion in the ranks of the church there will be enticing and seducing spirits under the guise of religion that will come into the church and they will deceive many he knew that satan himself that is paul knew would appear amongst the people as if he is an angel of light or a messenger of god angel messenger of light of god he is presenting himself also that he is a messenger of god and how much more the ministers that he has with him how much more will there they be like that that is why paul warns us that the gospel must always remain the same for god makes no mistakes god does not go correcting and correcting and recorrecting oh i made a mistake so i'll correct this part no the first word is the last word whenever god says anything his word cannot change it cannot lie it cannot pass away it is immutable it is infinity oh praise god his word remains stronger and longer in its existence for his word is the eternal living word of the living god hallelujah amen praise god now we know paul baptized in jesus name and if we are to stay with the word and not to have that curse of god come upon us then we must and should baptize also in the name of jesus christ paul also re-baptized some that were in the bible as you know in the book of acts when they said we know not of this gospel you're preaching of this holy ghost we don't know about this message that you're declaring we never heard it in this fashion before but nevertheless we believe it to be the truth amen and the bible tells us that paul re-baptized them in the name of the lord jesus christ there are millions that are baptized with the wrong baptism for those that baptized them had no revelation of what name they should be baptized in and they were baptized into titles instead of the name of the one who has those titles and the name of the one who has those titles prince of peace wonderful counselor mighty god amen lady of the valley bright my morning star and so on father son holy ghost it's the same lord jesus christ and the name of the father son and holy ghost is one name of one god and his name is jesus christ which in the hebrew is jehovah our savior amen jehovah of the old testament is jesus of the new testament our savior hallelujah praise be to god jesus christ our savior and our beloved lord thanks be to god hallelujah amen paul set the church in order back then for the gifts were going out of whack within the church he set them in order and confirmed that they should remain within the church oh praise god forevermore and they were to remain there until jesus comes back again this promise is unto you unto your children and unto your children's children even as many as the lord jesus christ shall call is god still calling as long as god is still calling these promises are to you this holy ghost is for you these gifts are for you this anointing is for you these truths are for you the word of god for this day stored up left by a servant of god in a golden pot upon the great uh ark of the covenant glory to god that we may receive fresh food in our season and walk in the light of the day praise god forevermore amen yes sir glory to his name we find friends the messengers all remaining all six of them they will say the same of what paul said because they are of the same continuing spirit the same spirit of god from age to age the same god making himself manifest and giving forth the same fire and the same light shining from the throne of the living god and signs will always follow them the power of god will always be with them did irenaeus the great sermon of god did he qualify as a messenger that saint martin qualifying as a messenger that colombo qualify as a messenger did martin luther who spoke in towns amen who prayed for the sick who believed that just shall live by faith does he qualify as a messenger what about john wesley does he qualify as a messenger in his great ministry is known and recorded how that one time uh he was going to preach the gospel and the horse on which he would ride fell sick and stumbled to the ground that's as if you have a car today and you're going to preach the gospel and the car sputters and stops and you don't know what's wrong and you are gonna turn back to go home because your car isn't working but not john wesley when that horse fell down and was not uh was sick wesley anointed the horse with oil laid his hands upon it and in the name of jesus christ oh praise god that horse got up the horse was well and wesley went on his preaching journey his circuit and preached wherever god wanted him to preach hallelujah amen seven stars seven eyes seven laps seven messengers views of gods who were all alike as paul amen and we know paul pronounced a clear curse on anyone regardless of how high profile he is positioned he is or how low he may be that anyone who said anything brought any other different message or differed with what paul preached paul said let him be accursed even if he claims to be an angel from heaven let him be accursed this this curse from the word of god out of the mouth of the apostle paul amen is upon all those amen praise god that tries to preach a different gospel and preach some kind of live some kind of a different life contrary to god's holy word oh my listen in the bible the book of revelation listen what it says revelation 22 18. if any man adds to this book what takes away from this book he would be should be plagued and judged by condemnation of god god said i will add the plagues written in this book upon him or i will take his part out of the book of life amen now friends we see that these seven spirits of god actually speak of the one great holy spirit of god working out god's will and word in different generations different ages age after age but remains the same for instance like the spirit of elijah that god used that anointed elijah and then when elijah left the scene the spirit of the lord came upon elisha with a double portion and used him for the glory of the living god centuries later the same spirit of god which is described as a spirit of elijah came upon john the baptist amen and used him for the glory of god and the bible prophesies that that same spirit was to return in the last days amen and to anoint a man that will be the eye of the lord the lamp of the lord the voice of god the star messenger oh praise god hallelujah god would use him as his eyes of discernment glory to god hallelujah in the last days to fulfill malachi 4 5 to fulfill revelation 10 7. he would receive the revelation of god from the mighty angel and reflect it back into the church age that the people might be restored back to the word until to their original place in christ going back where they came from by the holy spirit amen praise god amen so my friends the ministry of that man prophesied of in malachi 4 5 spoken of in revelation 10 7 or the scriptures are there but we we we emphasize these but i believe that that man was brother william marion branham many differ with him now they have no real uh recognition of who he really was and how he was used why are his peculiar ways why his peculiar ministry why his anointed an astounding miraculous ministry what a ministry of abundant truth being made known through him with a ceaseless flow of the mighty oceans of god's word coming through him the deep calling onto the deep and the deep in the hearts of the elect response to the word of god oh thank god forevermore that his word came to me and i responded his word came to many others and we have responded to the word of god that has filled our hearts with the glory divine oh hallelujah amen praise god jesus and god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and power and he went about doing good healing all that were oppressed by the devil hallelujah jesus went away but that same spirit that was upon him came back on the day of pentecost hallelujah you see he went up the body was left on earth to be resurrected but he gave up the holy ghost which went back and then came back down on the day of pentecost to anoint his disciples that believed his word hallelujah oh praise god amen and they went forth and began to do the same works prison doors were open prison houses rocked with the power of the holy spirit lame men walked again oh my the ministry of peter james paul stephen oh many others through the ages used of the living god with this this wonderful power of the holy spirit because jesus before leaving said wait in jerusalem until you receive the promise of the father amen not just the father's promise that the father the promise of the father that he himself will come in you and be with you to sustain you empower you use you and manifest himself through you amen glory to god hallelujah amen and so they went forth with the same spirit as a called out body of the living god amen they went out in his stead and we are to go out in his place in his stead for god's glory and for god's honor amen and that same spirit of course was in them and they will do the same works and any people group or church that that believes that they are truly the body of jesus christ the same supernatural element of the presence of the spirit of christ will manifest itself through them with them in them around them they will have that divine atmosphere that only the holy spirit himself can create by his word hallelujah amen and they will manifest the lord jesus and his works in the same way amen and so a genuine original pentecostal church must be the same way i am afraid and ashamed to say so many that follows this message of brother william marion branham this certified vindicated elected messenger of this hour at turning their noses up at pentecostal manifestations of the power of god amongst the people they're trying out the baby with the bath water not recognizing that even though he had to rebuke the excesses of gifts rebuke the excesses of the manifested fleshly manifestations among the pentecostals my friend that the original true remains the same and you will always have the fanatics you'll always have those that will be that way but let me tell you the real is still here today amen amen i know for instance many have called me and thought of me as just a pentecostal they don't i believe it that they really don't recognize the presence of the holy spirit for that's the way god presents himself as the unrecognized presence of the living god do you mean god will will leave me and and go to you and slap him on his face amen do you mean god will do act this way with you and and just leave me like that and they slapped him and threw him in prison in other words they isolated him they didn't want anything to do with him they didn't want no connections whatsoever because he was too pentecostal but that you understand the original was church genuine pentecostal church and it must remain the same but not petty costa like this modern pentecost the original one that had not just full of spirit lot of spirit lot of manifestations but also with the fullness of the word to balance that spirit and to correct those spirits in the church of the living god for jesus said the true worshiper will worship me in spirit not only in spirit and in the truth god needs both sides for you to have a spiritual balance you go this way and you take on spirit and you go off to seed and into weeds of fanatic actions and all kinds of superstitions and fast fantastic things and every little something that happens you you have to put a meaning on it over there and the other way you go the opposite way trying to be so beautifully cultured and controlled and so much you bring conduct ordering doctrine with such uh uh repression up upon the people that they are scared to manifest the gifts the lions the power the spirit of almighty god that wants to operate through them for his glory and and for his honor blessed be the name of the living god hallelujah let me tell you something friends he remains the same he does not change he is still here with us the prophet is not here but the spirit that was upon him is still here today upon some that believe his word in its fullness and we are feeding from the storehouse and receiving nutrients for our souls blessed be the name of the lord may god help every one of us to be a burning shining light for the glory of god i repeat the last day church must be with the same blueprint as the first church of the first church age it must be it cannot be just a lot of word word word and no spirit neither can it be lots of spirit spirit spirit and no real revelation we are not just called to be repeaters though we will repeat the word over and over again but we are called to be ones that god himself not you or i but god will vindicate his word amen in for instance what i mean is not somebody drumming up something but while peter yet spake the holy ghost fell on all them that heard the word amen rebelled his gifts were made certified by god stamped and approved by god god amen god testifying god speaking of his gifts let god speak whether this is true or false let god speak whether these gifts are real or whether they're makeup let god speak whether this is just words and words or he is full of words not to recognize that it is the word hallelujah making itself manifested in this day and in this hour in which we live oh blessed be the name of the living god hallelujah any church that doesn't have the spirit of god any manifestations is going to have to come before god for the way they live and the way they conduct themselves in the presence of god hallelujah thank god these men don't try to have a ministry god has them in his hands and god upholds their ministry god manifests himself through them for his glory and for his honor for they are in his hands and the hand represents the hand of power the hand of authority amen they praise god for none of them came in their own power or by their own desire but they came under uh the authority delegated authority of the holy ghost and preached under the power and authority of the holy spirit empowered by the holy spirit this and they stood up to the world and all its systems and all its errors regardless of whether they would be crucified jailed boiled in oil burned at the stake like you latimer and ridley and many other great man oh let us light a candle this day mr ridley that the they will never be able to put out or praise god forevermore may god give us more men and women like that that will stand for god's word and hold to his unchanging hands oh praise god the seven spirits of god one spirit manifesting itself himself seven ways seven attributes seven virtues seven lights seven eyes seven stars seven seven seven perfection seven thunders the fullness of the richness of the voice of god making itself known in these last days glory to god amen full of the holy ghost ought to rise by the living god hallelujah and the world would have nothing to do with them when you stand with god's truth in god's word it'll seem that way but a servant is no greater than his lord if they will put him away if they will despise him reject him crucify him so will they do to those that truly follow him you will not be elevated you are not going to be recognized you are not going to be placed anywhere for man's approval oh my but think of it choose to take the way with the lord's despised few amen let's decide in our hearts i'm going through with jesus i'm going true no matter what others do what are the paths they want to take i know what i'm looking at what i'm seeing in the realm of the spirit of this word is the truth out of god's word and i'll wall to god's unchanging word amen hallelujah hey praise god hallelujah oh brother this last day church ought to be pentecostal in power pentecostal experience and i'm talking about original pentecost acts 2 4 pentecost that puts uh oh praise god ah axe in your hand amen two axes in your hand amen and a 38 on your waist amen to blast the devil chop off his head and give the glory to the living god amen back to the word saints of god this is the day that the lord has made we will walk in the day this day and be glad i want you to see how they had tongues interpretations of towns discernments miracles healings amongst them prophecy god in the midst of the church of course a lot of churches a lot of that they're in the message will call that excess they don't want it they don't want to have nothing to do with it with their fear of going wrong they will not attempt they will not allow the holy spirit to let them leave the shore and launch out into the deep they will not surrender themselves to the will purpose and power of the living god in these last days that god can manifest himself amen i tell you not only will the church be like that but she'll be unorganized you're going to say oh what kind of a church is that what kind of a preacher is that it doesn't have any really systematic way of administrating the church or running the church everything looks uh uh timing and this and that and it looks like it's out of order oh they don't understand how god built his church other people have those gifts and god will make his man in certain ways to do his will and other parts of the body will fulfill their other parts they're just as important but god has his plans he has his purpose he has his ways amen hallelujah and he shapes us to his will amen jesus christ through the ages has been revealing himself through his messengers amen just as moses was with the children of israel hallelujah god gave a revelation to each messenger to bring that revelation and ministry to his day and to his age hallelujah praise god amen let me tell you friends it's not enough for us to have even a five-fold ministry of ephesians four it is not enough for us to have also all these manifestations in the church because even the church with the five-fold ministry may go astray then it takes god to send a messenger to straighten out the church with even the ministers the membership all takes out direct messenger from god that clergy group for god to straighten them up by his holy spirit shepherds can be wrong as well as sheep can be wrong and god has to straighten them all up god himself comes on the scene through those messengers as the great shepherd of the sheepfold hallelujah to lead his own people back to the original sheepfold and to bring them back to truth and abundant power and manifestation of his divine presence hallelujah amen he is the word and he must be recognized as the word in his people but god had placed special leadership on these seven anointed men anointed with the spirit of god chose them use them and move them according to the council and direction of his own will and purpose and they appear once in every age once a messenger has come on the scene then a whole bunch of copycats want to come off from that and you're going to end up with many many coming thinking that they now have uh they're also a messenger and they have their message or the messenger uh was a messenger to a church age so all of a sudden their messenger to a church thank god we there are no messengers or the messengers promised in the word of god the only messenger we know earthly is malachi 4 5 the ministry of brother william marion branham and the eternal messenger the mighty angel of god to the eternal church age for the members of that church age are eternal so the messenger has to be eternal the church age eternal oh the living god working through his people for his glory amen blessed be the name of the lord here we are friends we must follow the messenger as the messenger follows the pillar of fire the living god listen he that at the seven spirits of god and the seven stars god is identifying himself with man by his spirit within man and by this saying they are mine they belong to me hallelujah they may be repudiated rejected uh they may be you may question their teachings their doctrine that's all right you're questioning it not realizing you're questioning the one who sent them with that gospel with that word amen the human minds they may not even seem to be qualified they might the devil may bring up all minor excuses by saying oh he wasn't born right oh he wasn't educated oh he wasn't trained in the in the rabbinical school oh he didn't go to this bible college this university he wasn't raised over here or he's of the wrong he came out to the wrong religion or he was of wrong race or he is up of the wrong uh social background he he or she is of the wrong financial background the devil will always find an excuse to try to besmirch blacken on disqualify them but they stand like the rock of ages god's great shining lights with the word of god shining forth in all of its glory amen hallelujah nevertheless whatever we think they are still god's messengers because remember god used an abraham that lied god used a moses that got angry struck the rock and rebelled god used a jonah that disobeyed god use a samson that sinned against the lord god uses david who murdered god used a joshua a joseph god used a paul who murdered christians and god still use him my friends don't look at the the outward things god deliberately places those veils various veils that will blind the effect of people watch listen and discern the word of the lord and when doing that discern the lord's body that he is using with his word for his glory amen but remember those men's blemishes whether they be cultural whether they be natural whether it be spiritual whatever those men's blemishes far outnumber those whose histories those persons people whose records seem to be perfect all are his we all belong to him and he will judge us when we come to the end of our way amen god we stand alone to be judged by our master to stand or fall in the light of his presence and the light of his word for what we do we do by his suffering will to accomplish his sovereign purpose amen hallelujah and i want to close by saying the eternal god still stands and walks around the golden candlesticks and sends his messengers by his spirit with the word of god to an elect people of every age receive him receive it receive the word for your age receive the fullness of this day and this time and god will bless you if you're not baptized in the name of jesus christ seek out the genuine minister of god that will baptize you in the name of jesus christ if you were baptized under the titles in many of the denominational groups who don't understand the fullness of the word regardless of their so-called high educated positions they have walked over god's word and missed the fullness of truth back to the word then be re-baptized my brother be re-baptized my sister just as paul re-baptized those who were not baptized right in the bible they were re-baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ oh praise god forevermore may god bless you as you come to the waters of his word and you are washed clean by the truth that your doubts are gone them evil spirits that once held you within their grip you are free you are now loose from them and now you come for the waters of baptism that you may identify yourself publicly with him and rise to walk in the newness of life with a new light on life for his glory and for his honor amen may the lord bless you and may we come together once again next wednesday evening hallelujah to speak on the condemnation of the age of sardis may god bless you until we meet together again those of you who are in my immediate area of course you're invited to uh come to the church in person and to fellowship around the word of god hallelujah get in contact with us by our email uh get in contact with us through the deacons and then be able to draw nigh and god will draw nigh to you god bless you [Music] you
