scriptures Matthew 13 John 8 Isaiah 55 we want to continue on the series of the the power of tradition but tonight we want to title this every seed brings forth of its own age Hallelujah we've been talking about a lot of things and I can't go over them all hallelujah we're just going to bring a couple thoughts here tonight to add to it and continue the thought on Amen a little here and a little there hallelujah amen Matthew 13 23 but he that receiveth seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word and understandeth it Oh my he that receiveth seed into good ground is he that heareth the word and understandeth it everybody can hear the word but then understanding it and placing it which also beareth fruit and bringeth forth some hundredfold here's the different portions of Faith here 60 some 30 another Parable put he forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is liken unto a man which sth good seed in his field Hallelujah and we know that by while man sleep his enemy came and sold tears Amongst the Wheat and he went his way we know that the enemy is here Allelujah every time God is going to S seed in your life the enemies is going to come in and try to swow those tears amen hallelujah John 8:32 and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free he answered him we be Abraham seed and we're never in bondage to any man how sayest thou yay shall make shall be made free Jesus answered them verily verily I said say unto you whosoever committed sin which we know is unbelief is the servant of sin unbelief and the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth forever the son the Sons and Daughters of God they predestinated the elected ones abided forever and I know that ye are Abraham's seed in the flesh but you seek to kill me the reve word I know you're in the message I know you're Abraham's seed in the flesh we're all Brothers and Sisters in Christ but you seek to kill me Jesus said and he is the revealed word not just a letter because a letter kills but the spirit gives it life the revealed word hallelujah because my word had no place in you predestin ation Isaiah 5511 Hallelujah so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void so you see and what is God's word it's a seed amen it's a spoken word seed and that's what we want to talk about a little tonight that the bride is the spoken word seed okay that but it shall not but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing where I sent it or the time and season or the age that I sent it amen let us pray father thank you for your love grace and mercy we are here Lord report reporting for service both speaker and hearer Lord we have gathered together tonight Lord Jesus not to see one another not to be heard not to lift any man's name up but to lift you up and you said if I I be lifted up I'll draw all man unto thee father Lift us up into Heavenly places tonight speak to our hearts speak my Lord speak and confirm Lord Jesus our faith oh God and then we know that that Faith would become perfect we want perfect perfect Faith perfect realization of who we are in this hour so we will know what to do with the word in our lives because of the time and season amen that the word has to be fulfilled oh Grant it Lord open our understanding open our hearts I open no man shuts I shut no man opens oh God we know it's by Faith Lord and we know that that the Gates of Hell will not Prevail when you reveal what you need to reveal tonight in our hearts Grant it Lord we pray in Jesus Christ's name God bless you as you seated amen hallelujah Isaiah 59 as for me this is my Covenant with them sayeth the Lord my spirit that is upon thee and my words which I have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of thy mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seed seed sayeth the Lord from hence forth and forever more Hallelujah glory to God Amen what a day and age we're living in Hallelujah Abraham's unconditional Covenant was given in this hour in this day to us amen and we can see that the seed of God hallelujah what I want to what I what I want to bring tonight amen is let us recognize and understand hallelujah what has been spoken in this hour Hallelujah because what has been spoken is a seed and that seed is who we are in this hour Hallelujah that's why the spoken word is the Original Seed and when those seals open amen the word the revealed word was spoken what does that mean that means you were spoken your part your position your faith tonight your walk tonight your consecration tonight everything that evolves around your life your trials your Temptations your healing your persecution everything that evolves around you was spoken out of those seals and that's why he said my word has been spoken and it shall not return void that's you amen you shall not return void unto God but you shall accomplish what that word inside of you was spoken to accomplish and succeed all we have to do is connect by faith without faith is impossible to please God but when we come in connection with faith all these things amen become a reality in our lives and we recognize who we are we walk different we talk different we act different there's a different anointing and confidence and power around our lives when we speak the word of God we're not speaking just religion hallelujah oh Jesus said brother brandom said but it's different when you say oh God is revealed to me I say I say CU I believe because it's revealed to me it's what I have need of and he gave me the word by faith he gave it to me oh my it's always been the same way in every age he can't change it's got to come the same way amen hallelujah our walks have to come the same way glory to God the Capstone is the Seven Seals revealed to the bride brother bradam both had the seven was both the seven Church age messenger and the ministry and the Capstone Ministry he preached the Pentecostal message but as those seals were br breaking amen those seals were breaking they weren't open the serpent seed the church ages we can see all those things it was breaking but it was still in a Pentecostal real a Pentecostal understanding until those seals opened up that's when the age changed everything changed brother bradam said it became a new Bible the what new elevated everything got elevated got got to another dimension got to another level amen that's why God said when the enemy comes in as a flood I'll make my word more real I'll raise a standard I'll elevate my word that's what he did amen we can see the process in in brother bram's life well it it it has to be reflected in the bride why because we're going to look at a few things tonight to show you that it was spoken of the Bride it was spoken spoken of her Ministry it was spoken of her life amen we don't need Faith necessarily just on the prophet we need Faith sufficient for this hour for us for me for you in this hour to put on this word that God has a lotted what put on this word put on the seed bring the seed alive within us amen hallelujah aluah glory to God the Seven Seals opening and revealing was the Capstone Ministry calling the bride into perfect Faith you see she could never have been first of all elected and called out until that came and she could never be called into perfect Faith until those seals were open she could never come into perfect realization of who she is she could never go behind that inner Veil fully with God until those seals were open and revealed it opened the door for her amen it changed the dispensation of time it changed everything for her she went to another level from Pentecost Hallelujah now she can go behind the in Veil just like in the Old Testament Hallelujah it was death to go into behind the in Veil only the priest that was elected once a year can go behind there now Hallelujah it wasn't for the Pentecost it wasn't for Luther Wesley but now after those seals have broken for the bride Hallelujah now she has access and entry to go behind that inter Veil where the shakina glory is where the where the where the where the Mana is the eternal food of God is everything is different behind that Veil my brothers and sisters it takes us you can look back at religion you can look back at the Faith of Our Fathers back there but this faith in this hour oh my it's different it's different we see the wave sheet we can see by faith and understand by faith that something happened he even talked about it brother Bram talked about it there was a shift there was a turning in his life in his walk where everything became new and then he started speaking different Hallelujah he started speaking different everything became different the messages that he was preaching after 63 became different Hallelujah it wasn't no more preaching to the churches out there worrying about the Pentecostal movement out there it was different it was ell easier amen Hallelujah elaser introducing Isaac to the Bride of Jesus Christ now it was just Isaac and the bride now coming into relationship coming into a marriage now Hallelujah the Capstone age is always been rejected the whole age is rejected I'm talking about this age my brothers and sisters this Revelation that is that is coming forth and unfolding in the message you can see that there's a separating time you can see that the angel through the word of God that's being revealed something different is going on the bride is recognizing everybody else might be recognizing oh the message is just the message is just this is that everybody's a preacher in the message and this and that no the bride is recognizing there's a separating taking place and the word is doing it the revealed word is placing her in her position and that's what's doing in this hour not man is doing it not individuals are doing it but God by the opening of the word is doing it in this hour glory to God Amen good people but not recognizing the bright age we are here my brothers and sisters we are here hallelujah that's why when after he preached the message the token came desperation listen every individual has to get into a state of desperation you know what it's not just a time or a season of desperation brother bradam said I'm constantly in a state of desperation all the time my soul is desperate for this word the reality of this word in this hour hallelujah amen and of course this is prophesying of the day that we're now living in the oil has moved into the Capstone hallelujah it's gone seven Church ages the Holy Spirit the calf Stone the oil is in there the bride is in that chamber hallelujah amen she's not feeding off nothing but the fullness of the word now nothing in part but the fullness of the word of God in this hour amen this is the age that Believers are living in this message we have come out this message has called us out Hallelujah coming into this message is it evident that you've been called out but a lot of people have been called out but have they come in the message is a calling out and a coming in it's a calling out experience yeah you got experiences a lot of people are still living off of those experiences of of what what justification could bring in this message what sanctification can bring in this message what the Pentecostals miracles signs and wonders can bring in this message Hallelujah called out but now you have to come in now you have to come in now do you have to come in yes you have to come in but who brings you in Hallelujah he brings you in all we can do my brothers and sisters no matter how much we preach and it may sound like we have to do something but you got nothing to do with it all we can do is be surrendered vessels amen willing heart that's all we can do when he calls upon our names when he reveals and calls us we surrender we come under obedience to the call we let him do the work that needs to be done in our lives why do you think he's working so hard in your life and dealing with you listen if he's not dealing with you and you don't got trials coming upon you you're not being tested coming upon you then watch out Satan might got a hold of you you might be locked in this leoan church age under traditions in this message but if he's your life is being always turned upside down God is dealing with you because Satan don't have you amen amen the ending the oil has run out in this Pentecostal age now the foolish virgin are manifesting in this message and living off of a pass word it's a pass word everything is a password everything you need everything we need every technology you need is off of a password because everything in this Dimension is connected to this age amen hallelujah but God is showing us amen though this body is in the leoen church age amen the true birth of the seven seal birth within us has translated us out of this church age we are in Heavenly places we are Eternal beings right now oh Glory that's what the Rapture is the rapture is not just an event you are the Rapture the Rapture is on taking place inside of you now eternity is here that's why Jesus meant when he said the kingdom of God Has Come unto you hallelujah hallelujah the kingdom of God is here the ending of the seven Church ages is the beginning listen is the beginning of the word Revival for the Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah they had to come to an end the seven churches had to come to an end Hallelujah it had to change then the word the opening of the seals came the word Revival to the Bride of Jesus Christ no more she seeks after the word the past word in the church ages amen there's something in that seed inside of her that's thirsting for something more than that people can live off of Old mana and a glare of a past age but the bride is seeking for something more she wants to know where God is now she needs to know the god of Elijah she don't need to know Elijah she needs to know the god of Elijah the god that dealt with Elijah the god that BR Elijah into fulfillment of the portion of the word scripture that he was she wants that because she knows it's going to take that hallelujah it's not going to take man it's not going to take religion it's not going to take just listening to the tapes coming to church hallelujah it's going to take that him amen hallelujah that's when the Revival the word Revival started for the bride Hallelujah at the opening of those seals bringing her her word Revival and bringing her to a body change this word Revival brings Perfection it brings perfect understanding perfect faith in their position listen it's nothing short of it no man can preach it into you but this is the word seed that was spoken out of a prophet's mouth in this last day prophesying to a Pride her position given all the details when she comes forth that that's what was being spoken through the seals when she comes forth this is what she's going to look like this is what she's going to act like this is how she's going to move this is how she's going to operate amen hallelujah she walks different she talks different she acts different amen oh God she lives different everything because the description was spoken about her hallelujah amen glory to God brother brah says you know we get discouraged like Abraham time went on 25 years yeah the flesh we're all here we get discouraged we know the promises of God we've seen what God has done in our lives Hallelujah but I'm sure some of you are looking for things to be fulfilled some of you might be waiting for years for that word of God to be fulfilled and I'm not talking about material things Hallelujah he said seek the kingdom the word listen the bride wants the word to manifest in her life it doesn't mean that when things are added unto her and she's a blessed like Abraham she can be a blessing she doesn't refuse it she never refuses anything that God has for her she wants her whole inheritance everything that she got but she seeks for that word to manifest in her life and to open up to who she is in this out she wants that in desperation more than life itself More Than This Life can produce more than her own life she wants that within her oh my she understands and she starts seeing see the cardal mind will can never comprehend God but the word inside the seed there's something drawing her she knows that perfect Revelation perfect Faith perfect understanding perfection in that way is coming to her she knows it lies within the seed she knows that seed is inside of her oh God why because it's been spoken it's been prophesied of her you see the difference my brothers and sisters and listening to the message then becoming the message brother Brandon says you can gather yourself together listen to the message agree with the message H Allelujah go and fellowship around the message but but he said that ain't going to do you any good unless you become that message unless you believe that you and that message are one and the same that's the faith that Jesus had that's the faith of the seed that's in the hour today that's been spoken that I and my father are one and the same oh I do nothing unless the father show me because the father dwelleth within me that's the same kind of faith that God is speaking amen into the Bride of Jesus Christ in this hour that's the kind of faith that should be coming to you you want to know if you're born again you want to know that you're walking with God and this word is opening up to you then you see that kind of Faith come into your life not just a Pentecostal Faith a religious Faith oh my my brothers and sisters come up a little higher come up hither amen where the glories amen why settle for Pentecostal blessings when you got the heavens full of all these blessings the word of God being revealed of who you are nothing greater in this day than a new birth nothing greater than understanding that you and the father are one and the same that God has called you what can bring confidence to you what can take your walk and elevate your faith when God speaks in that word and says you are mine Hallelujah you are mine come and walk with with me my child you are mine I put my jealous love around you it's been me all your life it's been me dealing with you all your life it was me taking you out saving you why for a purpose Hallelujah why does God do all these things why does he heal you why does he deliver you why does he provide for you so you can come and recognize this amen and Manifest this word for the hour my word shall not return to me void but it shall accomplish amen hallelujah it's his word that he's looking at in this hour and that word is in US is becoming one with us hallelujah amen glory to God the Holy Ghost in This Hour through the Bride of Jesus Christ will take this message of this hour by Perfect faith and bring the church back to its original form oh yes my brothers and sisters amen we at this church this message churches are not to be set up as Pentecostal churches amen hallelujah but this bride this Revelation inside of her the Holy Ghost inside of her is going to bring back this original church amen operating and moving in the same ways that he did with the apostles back there yes we're in a different age yes we're in a Rapture age but it's going to be the same holy ghost that was moving and operating in them is going to be moving and operating in the word seed prophecy for this day in our lives to bring that Rapture to pass again oh God I'm talking about you tonight I'm talking about what was spoken the spoken word the seed word that was spoken about you this is what must come to pass this prophecy is what was spoken and won't won't return to God void but it will accomplish it's going to accomplish my brothers and sisters your greatest enemy is yourself your own understanding your own thoughts and ways that's the greatest enemy here if we can get that dealt with and out of the way Hallelujah glory to God sometimes God takes a lifetime to get us to a place a lifetime to get us to a place oh my to recognize that we're all individuals Amen brother bradam tied all the loose ends together by revealing the Mysteries who's the Mysteries you are the mystery you're the mystery of Christ in this hour the bride being revealed you are that mystery listen if you don't believe it that way then what are you believing in now it's for the Bride of Jesus Christ to bring the book of Acts the apostles that acts of the Holy Spirit to bring the church back in order the way it was set up on the day of Pentecost she will not be a parrot she will not be a parrot repeating the quotes with no understanding oh yeah no understanding of what she's saying just quote quot quot quote brother bradam said because brother bradam said because brother Bram said and no understanding taking the wrong quotes for the wrong age and the wrong season that she's living in no my brothers and sisters this age and this day in this message has the word that's allotted for now there is a past age in this message is all light the whole message is light but see that light if it's a past age word that was fulfilled in a past age it becomes a glare and that glare becomes a false light go listen to there's a man here can turn on the lights you'll see that the Holy Spirit was prophesying of this day and and what would be taking place in the message now then it becomes that glare becomes a false light what brother Tim a false light in this message yes blinding people yes because not taking the right word for the age that is allotted for this hour and what is spoken to produce brother bradam left it behind and he moved on that's why he said it became a new Bible became a new message to him everything changed for him his understanding the way he seen the word the way he understood the word it all changed and people are living off of that glare in that hour Samaritan Church age listen brother brand speaking here in very plain language very plain language we're a as simple is I can make it to you the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in his designated degree season and time each as each member came forth it became expressed and took its place in the body by recognizing his place place in the body thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride that's who she is and though she is feminine now listen she is Cho choosing and naming of someone to be a holder of an official position that's who she is for a special purpose or given to a special status that's the description in this hour of the Bride of Jesus Christ a special position and a special status in this hour that is the word that has been spoken of her in this hour H Allelujah she is also called the body of Christ this is very apparent that she to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same Source was eternal with him and now is manifesting God in a many member body whereas once God was manifested in one member even in the Lord Jesus Christ meaning when God was manifested and revealed himself in the Lord Jesus Christ as one now now that same God is manifested in a many member body called The Bride of Jesus Christ same life same actions same Holy Ghost same power same everything my brothers don't tell me you got a glass of water of the ocean it's any different than the ocean that is out there it's still the ocean it does the same thing Hallelujah glory to God Amen Hallelujah recognizing your day in its message why did they do that they want a Great Awakening they're crying and believing that there will be an Awakening they are good people why is it what is wrong they have not recognized here it comes again they have not recognized The Awakening of the Bride the bride has been awakened Hallelujah she's awakened she's not going to be awakened you know people are always looking for the Rapture for the event in the future that's human nature isn't it don't think we're not immune to it we we we we look about what God did in brother Brandon's Ministry we we we look what God did in the tapes listening to the tapes people getting stuck in God's sent a prophet stuck haven't moved on from that and we see what God has spoken and what he's going to do in the future people saying oh the big squeeze is going to bring on that that Revival in The Bride of Jesus Christ what happens right here right now Jesus Christ the same yesterday what's about today what's God doing today he just left today out then there's nothing happening today with God you see the blindness of the devil of traditions the power of traditions Church listen the church is the body of Jesus Christ it's not the building We Gather ourselves together under the anointing amen because we want him to come we don't want brother Tim brother Dany or any other minister to come we want him to come we want him to be here we don't want to gather together or or call what we called Church unless he comes he makes the difference right and your faith pulls on him tonight Hallelujah glory to God have not recognized The Awakening of the Bride by being a Christian they feel the pull of the hour but haven't recognized what's been done already past tense spoken and done I'm moved moving in what has already been done hallelujah it's already been done when Jesus said it's finished it's finished Hallelujah we waiting for healing in our bodies and it's the children's bread it's already done he can't heal you tonight because he already healed you it's already been done we got to accept recognize that it's been done then a perfect faith comes over you and you realize that and you walk out and you manifest it oh God came and manifest he already finished it he already finished and completed the work he already delivered you he already set you free those who I Justified he justified you I've Sanctified he Sanctified you those who I Sanctified I've already glorified you I've changed you oh my what are we doing then what what was Abraham doing when he was walking he was walking he was walking into the body change he is walking into translation he didn't have to do anything he didn't have to do anything my brothers and sisters all he had to do is believe all believe Hallelujah all things all the word all the spoken word of this day is possible all we have to do is believe stand on that word and believe keep walking my brothers keep going forward in your faith don't stop keep walking your attitude your motives your intentions keep walking the devil hitting every single one of the Bride of Jesus Christ so hard in this hour I don't know about you but if you're if you're walking in the the the light of the word like I am I know I am because I'm getting hit like crazy all over the place trying to do what trying to do what trying to stop me trying to stop me from going forward that's all he wants to do Hallelujah but when you're walking up that shining way and your your your your your faith every step you take you know it's faith when you get walk up in the morning you get out of bed and you walk to your vehicle whatever you're doing in in your day no matter what you're feeling how you're feeling what pain you're feeling you make those steps that's Faith that's natural Faith hallelujah it's the same way when the devil's hitting you spiritually hitting you you're hitting your character hitting your mind hitting all these things of unbelief of who you are and you get up I'm a Child of God I'm a son and daughter of God I'm predestinated for this hour to overcome I got to overcome and power Hallelujah the devil's under my feet amen I shall overcome hallelujah oh yes when he's hitting you and he's hitting you and he's hitting you and he's pounding on you and pounding on you oh listen brother brandham lost his wife lost his child you're talk about pounding and being hit he was down as down could be and Satan was just hammering him what was he doing think about what he was doing tonight why was he hammering him saying God don't love you you hear it God don't care about you hello anybody hear or that look what you've done for the kingdom of God Where's God now when all these things are happening yeah his reasoning came in and says yeah yeah and of course my brothers and sister my reasoning and your reasoning will look at these things and that's what's drove a lot of people out of the message out of the churches today because of their own reasoning oh yeah the church they don't love me they don't care about me they don't think about me they didn't they give me the appreciation that I deserve they didn't Pat me on the back give me the position I I deserved in the church reasoning oh they don't love you God don't love you you don't belong there the same devil you he hasn't changed a bit he can't change he's very predictable to the Sons and Daughters of God but what happened amen there is a birth in a son and daughter of God there's a birth that's the only thing that's going to keep us in this hour a birth a word revealed birth the seven seal birth in this hour is going to keep us in this hour and that raises up and says yes God taketh amen God doth this God allows this God allowed that like job he allowed everything to be taken away from you whatever blessed be the name of the Lord he giveth he taketh whatever he does is for my good cuz all things work together for my good cuz I believe the word that's been spoken in this hour rather you're going to believe it because listen it's not coming it's here it's here the pressure the devil has come down like a roaring lion oh that squeeze of that banana is here it's on now don't wait for the squeeze it's here now it's squeezing every single one of us tonight Hallelujah glory to God Amen I like series because you don't finish you just keep going on Hallelujah hallelujah amen let us move on here Noah's word was the truth but it won't work in this day amen that's the same way of looking in the message what I was just talking about you look in the Bible you believe every we believe the Bible is true right every single word of the Bible but when you look at Noah when you look at Moses you look at those and you say it's not this today that's not that's not for this today God's not asking me to build an ark he's not asking me to do the things that Noah did it's the truth but if you believe like some people are Believing on certain things from the past living living under the law of the priesthood living under all these things from the past you're blinded by a glare you're not producing the True Light that God has given us for this hour it's not going to produce body changed is not going to produce what he has spoken today that you and Christ are one it's the truth though just like in the message even brother Bram said out of his own mouth God allowed me to set traps God allowed me to set traps Hallelujah for make people go this way that way and then the Bride of Jesus Christ why because she sees Christ it's her in Christ amen she can't be dis deed hallelujah amen Wesley sanctification Pentecost the gifts it was the word revealed in his fullness but now it's the word revealed in his fullness the Holy Ghost himself and the bride in the last age darkness that deception between right and wrong is like a Razor's Edge brother Bram talked about it the razor's Edge oh brother sister is Razor Edge that word hallelujah you say brother

bride getting out of line and the spirit the words spoke into eternity and says get back in line as only God can put us back in line hallelujah amen glory to God Satan's Eden now now but now the devil the cunningness of the devil now makes people believe that they are Christians when they're not revelation 3:14 the leosan church age is how it will be in the last days this is how it would be Hallelujah there's no need more there's no there's no need more than ever before than a spiritual awakening oh if we need a spiritual awakening listen I need it every day I need a spiritual awakening all the time oh my if you're still in this Dimension and in this flesh there's never been a day and a need for a spiritual awakening listen this Revelation how that's how denomination spirits come in I got the truth I got the truth and they denominate and they die right there no but the real son and daughters of God the real Revelation it's like a Roman Candle it just keeps elevating it keeps breaking open it keeps revealing itself that's what it is in our lives and that's why we battle that's why we have to overcome because on every level there's a revelation waiting for us there's a portion waiting to be revealed in us hallelujah there's a manifestation in our lives being ready to reveal but we must overcome to the overcoming Comer it's granted these things we stop over overcoming you stop getting that manifestation in your life Hallelujah we always need a spiritual awakening many believe it occurs when when a spiritual awakening happens it gains awareness hallelujah oh my Satan dullen people's conscience didn't it say in the last days that the conscience to be snared with a hot iron dead but see a spiritual awakening when the word opens up to you that's when a revelation strikes you that's a spiritual awakening in your life it brings Consciousness to you it brings awareness to you aware of the word of God manifested around your life my brothers and sisters he said that the bride will have the ability to see to be aware to recognize when the word of God is coming to pass tell me how that happens brother Tim you can't give it the oil to anybody you can't explain a discernment and how these things happen you just it just happens and you see it you recognize it you understand it hallelujah it's what keeps you from being deceived it guides you and leads you and directs you Hallelujah people going off on all kinds of fact fastic things and craziness and that stuff why because they don't got this what I'm talking about here hallelujah hallelujah brings your Consciousness into awareness Spiritual Awakening experience is about gaining a deeper not a shallow a deeper and a deeper like the Bible says come out to the Deep don't come to the feet the your feet don't come to the ankles don't come to the waist don't come to the chest go over your head my brothers and sisters come out to the Deep God is calling us out to the Deep the Deep Waters of his word hallelujah glory to God Amen you got to be willing you got to be willing the angel said to Brother Brad I'm bringing simple things as God shows me here hallelujah the angel show brother bradam just be more sincere you're not sincere enough hello the angel how many know what angels are the angel said to the prophet the word prophet of the hour major prophet you are not sincere enough shouldn't that bring me it does you into desperation if the angel said that about him hallelujah oh my sinere for what what you know what God has shown you what God is revealing to you Hallelujah we are living in the most darkest evil Wicked lukewarm lazy lack have need of nothing everything age is all combined to he this is what we're battling hallelujah we're in this together my brothers and sisters we're fighting this devil this Dimension this age this flesh together this carnal mind together by bringing the word by fellowshipping by praying for one another by encouraging one another oh my brothers and sisters if your brother's down or your brother made a mistake or whatever I make a mistake whatever pray brother BR says don't say nothing against him or her pray for one another oh the love of God when the love of God starts moving that perfect love starts moving one another where there's no thought of Envy there's no thought of jealousy there's no thought of division there's no words of criticizing and being critical amongst us then the Holy Ghost will move there are things wrong there are manifestations that are wrong amongst us we are going to get out of line but it's all God is looking at our attitude God is show you my sin I'll be the chiefest of Sinners here tonight he'll show you my sin but he's going to he's going to test you he's going to test you and show you sometimes he tests me and I see Lord I don't got that kind of love I need more of that love Hallelujah you you love somebody you forgive somebody it's always the same way my brothers and sisters you can love those who love you but love those who hate you that's when this thing is getting dead God is doing a great work in your life Hallelujah is this easy no it's not easy for any one of us hallelujah and believe me the preachers that are called higher in faith are tempted even more and tried even more they are there's not no holy man here there's a holy God here but he wants to stop he wants to stop what's in me he wants to stop what's in Dany he wants to stop what's in these brothers to bring forth the word he wants to stop your fellowship he wants to stop us that's what he wants to do he wants to stop this he wants to Satan wants to prove that this word ain't going to come to pass this word is going to is going to return back to God void that's what he wants to do but God is determined Hallelujah that's why we get together together that's why we assemble ourselves together where the anointing is here and it breaks the Yoke that's why we come expecting my brothers and sisters did you come expecting that anointing to break the Yoke tonight did you come expecting to leave out of these doors different that that Yol is going to break something off your life that even though you don't feel it ah you don't see it but you're going to walk like Abraham walk and you know it's going to fall off of you that's why you come seeking for that power of God to be manifested in your life oh what a deception in this hour looking for some great preacher to pass by we don't need a great preacher to pass by we love them all God bless them and use them all we need Jesus to pass by oh yes that's who we need a church that invites him and where he's welcome is a church that's blessed prospering and bringing forth life in this hour and that's what we want let me find a place to close here we'll just have to continue this Hallelujah brother Bram said I'd rather have the right Spirit and the wrong Doctrine than have the right Doctrine and the wrong Spirit why did he say that and what we're talking about here because the right spirit will always correct the wrong Doctrine amen hallelujah but it's the opposite in this message when it comes to criticizing people oh you're off the word you got the wrong Doctrine wrong Spirit the right spirit will always correct the wrong Doctrine but the right Doctrine can never correct a wrong Spirit think about that think about it when things happen think about these things that has spoken let the Holy Spirit bring it back to your Remembrance in the time and season that you're going through something or you're being tested or there's a manifestation in your life you see the letter kills it kills my brothers and sisters the right Doctrine can kill you it says the letter kills but the spirit gives it life doesn't matter right Doctrine wrong Doctrine you don't got the right Spirit you're bringing forth death anyways Hallelujah not by might not by power but by my spirit sayeth the Lord everyone is waiting musicians come everyone is waiting for the Rapture but the Rapture is a revelation that the bride is receiving and manifesting that's the oil of the age that's what's been spoken for this age that's what's coming to pass that's where God is the foolish virgin is waiting for the oil oh my my brothers and sisters one is receiving it and bringing a manifestation and the foolish virgin is waiting for that Rapture Revelation to take place that's why it says in Matthews 24 the when it talks about the virgins give me of your oil oh my my brothers and sisters How can any bride of Jesus Christ give this oil they can't give this how can you how can you give this walk with God this years and years of God dealing with your life bringing you to a place of surrender bringing you to a place of obedience testing you and trying you bringing forth squeezing th Those Grapes squeezing the oil bringing forth the oil we have enough for ourselves and what are we doing tonight my brothers and sisters what are we doing when we gather together do you realize there's a supernatural element when we gather together where needs can be met the supernatural can come on the scene don't look at Pentecost don't look at Supernatural like that listen there's nothing greater let me tell you you can lay hands upon a sick and they'll recover and they will recover but there's nothing greater when a revelation strikes a soul there's nothing greater than that you you get healing you get Deliverance you get body change you're you're you you you get Spiritual Awakening Hallelujah you get conscious your conscience Comes Alive you get power you get confidence you get all that through a revelation and more that's what God is doing in this hour hallelujah amen amen let me just read this one last quote here and then we'll just continue this later on because I want to talk I'm talking about the Bride of Jesus Christ I'm talking about what's prophesied for with her in this hour what's been spoken about a her in this hour to bring forth brother BR is speaking here notice the harmony of the father and the son Jesus never did anything until it was first shown by him by the Father John 5:19 now listen we read all these scriptures in many other scriptures but listen to what he says here now this harmony is now to exists between the groom and his bride now all this word that has been spoken in the last day is now to exist between the groom and the bride he shows her his Word of Life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing could harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will rise it up again she will rise again just like Jesus that's why it said over and over this bride has to rise there has to come forth a bride just the same way Jesus rose from the dead this bride has to rise it's got to take place Hallelujah for the seed be planted and watered here's the secret of this the word is in the bride now like was with Mary it's been spoken my brothers and sisters hallelujah it's been already spoken it's now in her the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word hallelujah she performs in com the Commandments of the word in his name for she has thus sayeth the Lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that's planted by the water it comes to full heart Harvest serving is purpose those in the bride do only his will no no one can make her do otherwise don't tell me anybody can make you do otherwise no they have thus sayith the Lord they got the Revelation it's revealed to them or they keep still then you say be still and know that I'm God hallelujah they know that it has to be God doing the works in fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his Works while he was here on his Earthly Ministry now he works through the bride now he's manifesting through the bride let us stand Hallelujah glory to God thank you Lord amen it's the hour my brothers and sisters Hallelujah to recognize it's the greatest hour of recognizing like never before they're recognizing a lot of things out there but it's only a perversion of what God is Rec causing this bride to recognize it's the greatest thing that's why he said one of the greatest quotes that brother Bram said when she recognizes who she is she'll be an invincible Army are you potentially you are but are you manifesting an invincible Army tonight are you taking your land are you taking the squatters off your land are you doubting your doubts are you telling a devil recognizing a devil when he speaks unbelief to you what is unbelief my brothers and sisters we're so me caught up in this this H my car broke down this happened these are all things of this life what's the greatest thing that's taking place right now the devil don't care about those things he does all that stuff to distract you he don't want you to recognize who you are because you're going to be an invincible Army you're going to you're going to be that power that God has spoken in this hour in your own personal life you're going to take mountains you're going to speak to the devil you're going to cast self Devils You're Going To Tread on serpents you're going to be a hot potato in his hand oh my brothers and sisters oh Lord let's pray father we just get [Music] so excited with your word to see it come to pass in our lives Lord I pray father father I know the word has already been spoken in this hour the bride's already been called spoken predestinated Lord and here we are tonight preaching some little things on those I pray your

healing now in our bodies in the name of Jesus Christ Lord let your spirit move now upon the waters of your word in the people's hearts and let it come to pass continue to bless the ministry there's
