[41:31] him and giving him glory on this
[41:34] marvelous wonderful Sunday and while I'm

[41:40] it's like while they worshiping over
[41:43] there and giving glory to God uh
[41:50] together
[41:53] and just a
[41:55] moment
[41:57] yes and when he had found
[42:01] him that is when Barnabas found
[42:06] Paul right and when he had found him he
[42:11] brought him unto Antioch and it came to
[42:15] pass that a whole year they assembled
[42:20] themselves with the church and taught
[42:24] many people and the disciples were
[42:28] called Christians first at Antioch
[42:33] praise the Lord may God bless those few
[42:35] words to your hearts as we ask his
[42:38] Blessing now our gracious Heavenly
[42:41] Father we are so thankful for your grace

[43:04] you I will not leave you nor forsake you
[43:09] but I'll be with you to the very end of
[43:12] the age so we know that when we gather
[43:17] together uh it's not just the typical
[43:21] church service but we come in the
[43:24] presence of the king
[43:27] we come in the presence of your great
[43:31] spirit who
[43:33] dwells All Above All and in all and
[43:36] through you all so we ask father as we
[43:40] come humbly in your presence with
[43:43] worship with praise with adoration we
[43:47] ask your blessing upon the word anoint
[43:50] your people anoint your servants as

[44:02] honor to Your Great Name we ask it in
[44:05] Jesus name amen God bless you please be
[44:09] seated now we first of all love to have
[44:13] brother coffee
[44:15] come and just give a report we're not
[44:19] we're not preaching any sermon as such
[44:22] uh prepare pre prepared for hand or
[44:26] something like that we're just coming to
[44:28] talk with you is that okay amen and just
[44:31] to tell you of the Lord's uh doings and
[44:34] his workings in this great land of Ghana
[44:39] um Africa from which brother coffee
[44:42] comes brother Phillip comes brother
[44:44] Desmond comes sister Elizabeth comes
[44:47] Sister Rose Sister Mary they come from
[44:50] that land and our sister um Sheila that
[44:54] has passed on a few weeks ago uh that
[44:57] was here in the church then got very
[45:00] sick and had to be in the hospital and
[45:03] taken care of uh passed and crossed over
[45:06] she also came from there but what a day
[45:10] we're living in brothers and sisters
[45:12] praise the Lord what an hour that we're
[45:15] living in uh we haven't come in here
[45:18] just to hear words but we come to meet
[45:21] this eternal being that I believe every
[45:25] time I stand stand here you stand here I
[45:28] believe his presence is here I believe
[45:30] his power is here I believe he's
[45:33] listening to everything we say I
[45:35] actually truly believe that I'm not just
[45:39] talking I believe there's a living God
[45:43] and we serve him and he hears us and he
[45:46] watches and he knows everything the old
[45:50] saying God standing in the shadows
[45:54] watching over his own how wonderful it
[45:57] is to see that angel that brother
[45:59] Brenham had to tell uh Billy Paul look
[46:03] and over by the drapes in the hotel room
[46:08] was a
[46:09] 250b man standing with his hands folded
[46:13] in white robes it was the angel of the
[46:16] Lord and Billy Paul said and as he stood
[46:21] there he just looked at me and then
[46:24] changed into a fire
[46:26] that began to whirl around and went up
[46:28] through the windows into the heavens I
[46:31] believe we serve that same
[46:34] God he is no less the same God and
[46:37] that's why I believe that uh you are in
[46:40] a supernatural Church um there's lots of
[46:45] message churches and I'm not saying we
[46:48] are different or not different but that
[46:52] we are outstanding we don't want to be
[46:55] seen or recognize actually we want to
[46:58] have a hidden life because if we were to
[47:00] begin to tell you the stories how the
[47:02] pillar of fire appeared in
[47:05] that tree of life on the
[47:07] wall and actually appeared and then the
[47:11] picture was taken and that photograph
[47:14] was never shown
[47:16] and you know for people to uh oh my God
[47:20] that church may be no no let the Holy
[47:23] Spirit do that let the the Holy Spirit
[47:26] do things like that we are not here to
[47:29] advertise and make a big thing because
[47:32] we want to attract people but we want to
[47:34] give God all the praise and all the
[47:37] honor and the glory more of him and less
[47:40] of me amen more of him less of you amen
[47:43] that's the way it should be let's all
[47:45] Look Away to Jesus and I believe we will
[47:48] all be truly blessed the approach to the
[47:51] message now let's ask brother coffee
[47:54] under the Holy Spirit to anoint him and
[47:57] to use him to say whatever God lays upon
[48:01] his heart and then I'll follow up and
[48:04] make a few remarks and let the Lord
[48:07] Jesus have his way God bless you brother
[48:09] coffee we welcome you a mighty man of
[48:12] God uh because of um language because of
[48:16] culture because of Education things of
[48:19] that he might not appear as very much
[48:22] here and I'm just talking plainly um uh
[48:25] but you see when he gets into that land
[48:28] and he can speak to the people in their
[48:31] language and under the anointing of the
[48:33] holy spirit is a totally different man
[48:36] amen totally different and God flows
[48:39] through him and such a supernatural and
[48:42] marvelous and wonderful way you will
[48:44] want to know if it's the same BR of
[48:46] coffee that you knew over here that you
[48:49] were seeing moving under the spirit
[48:51] there but God has his own ways and his
[48:54] own plans brother coffee God bless you
[48:57] with all respects we welcome you to the
[49:00] pulpit and God bless you and use you for
[49:03] his glory god bless you good to see you
[49:06] first time we're seeing each other since
[49:07] we're back
[49:14] yes thank
[49:17] you I just want to say I really thanks
[49:20] everyone of
[49:22] you I thank my beloved pastor and his
[49:26] wife and when I was back home this
[49:31] time I really really saw as he was
[49:35] saying what God has even done that I
[49:40] myself did not know
[49:45] because preaching in message church
[49:49] maybe probably the same size or almost
[49:51] the same size of this
[49:53] church and the pastor is is not a young
[49:57] he been in the message for
[49:59] long and seeing how the Holy Spirit was
[50:04] moving in that church from the pastor to
[50:09] the Pew how the people were
[50:12] rejoicing and thanking God for the word
[50:15] that was coming my first scripture that
[50:19] I used was I think uh Psalm 10 H Psalm
[50:24] 46: 10
[50:26] and
[50:28] Hebrews I think
[50:30] Hebrews
[50:33] 11:29 I use that
[50:36] scripture that's what the lord gave it
[50:38] to me to give it to them and it was such
[50:42] a blessing and such a powerful message
[50:46] the pastor name was Pastor
[50:48] Steven the Holy Spirit
[50:51] mov and I'm not just talking about just
[50:54] joke
[50:56] were getting into the people heart
[50:59] because it was even Beyond me my
[51:02] understanding or whether I can speak or
[51:04] I can speak one point the Holy Spirit
[51:06] was even I was speaking
[51:09] English the Holy Spirit was telling them
[51:13] that even if you think you uh The
[51:16] Interpreter can't interpret it good I'll
[51:19] speak Ghana
[51:21] language I'll speak the language that
[51:23] everyone understand me and and God was
[51:26] going through the people
[51:28] heart and telling some of them the
[51:33] sisters youve been been through
[51:37] tradition and cultural SS and all kinds
[51:41] of things that has brought into the
[51:43] message has binded you but now God is
[51:47] setting you
[51:49] free and the spirit of God was moving
[51:53] beginning they were trying to like like
[51:56] uh check what I was bringing and you
[52:00] could see they have their note but while
[52:02] the Holy Spirit begin to move they put
[52:05] all the note aside they didn't care no
[52:08] more from the pastor at the back I see
[52:12] him jumping shouting the brother Pastor
[52:16] Robert that went with me oh he can wa
[52:20] and I was all over the place preaching
[52:23] like that you know what it was Thursday
[52:27] we left here 31st October reach in Ghana
[52:32] first so second I was preaching in that
[52:37] place
[52:39] and the N day which was
[52:44] Friday we were going to the market guess
[52:47] what the car the pastor was driving hit
[52:52] somebody on the ground
[52:56] crowd lots of crowd behind us and
[52:59] security all over the place abig girl
[53:02] was there Paul was there Pastor Robert
[53:06] who was driving the car was there so we
[53:10] wanted to take the person to the police
[53:12] or to the hospital but the person says
[53:16] no I can't go he don't trust the police
[53:19] much he don't trust the nurses much
[53:22] because he think the way I look maybe
[53:25] when I go there I can pay them with
[53:27] money and she won't get nothing and she
[53:30] will be left by herself so she rather
[53:34] let me give her something so that she
[53:37] will go and take care of herself and we
[53:39] could read between the line so I as
[53:43] every girl all the money has changed my
[53:46] money has I have changed Paul and the
[53:49] brother that was in the market he gave
[53:52] we gave all that we have to her and I
[53:55] give her my number that anything should
[53:59] contact
[54:00] me and the next day guess what he call
[54:04] and says he's feeling better so I just
[54:07] want to thank the Lord because I was
[54:08] even crying I know how hard Africa is
[54:12] what he going to do to survive even if
[54:15] he really get Hur but that didn't stop
[54:18] in my heart my heart was to get the job
[54:23] done amen no matter what I want to get
[54:27] the job
[54:29] done
[54:30] so that was the first message the Deacon
[54:34] the head of the deacon they were doing
[54:37] transaction like as we did with here
[54:40] which brother Danny is becoming the next
[54:44] Fe of Pastor if our beloved Pastor time
[54:49] reach then he was telling me Oh Brother
[54:53] it's good that you came it's good that
[54:56] you came this message is so good to
[55:01] us and the pastor himself was telling me
[55:05] that he want me to even dedicate the
[55:07] head of the deacon and I was saying
[55:10] what's going on I never I don't have no
[55:13] idea maybe I'll get like Pastor Simon to
[55:16] in case of anything if he can come here
[55:18] if he can come then he will give me
[55:21] advice what to do or what but grow let
[55:25] the Lord get the
[55:27] glory so Sunday morning they asked me to
[55:31] preach
[55:32] again then I as soon as I go there the
[55:37] lord gave me uh Hebrews
[55:40] 138 and second Peter I think
[55:45] 1:20 and I put it together the Holy
[55:49] Spirit while were I'm about to go to the
[55:52] pulpit there was a brother turn up in in
[55:55] the church and he says oh Brothers I
[55:58] just failed to today come and worship
[56:01] with
[56:01] you

[56:07] Spirit took over the
[56:09] service such a blessing the people now
[56:13] they know what they got on Thursday so
[56:17] Sunday they they wasn't hesitating or
[56:21] guessing or what from the pastor to the
[56:23] PE they were ready to receive the word
[56:27] so the Holy Spirit begin to pour out in
[56:32] me search even I myself things I don't
[56:36] even think all I need to do is to remove
[56:40] myself out of the way let the Holy
[56:42] Spirit do the job and I did that and God
[56:47] be to prove to them that hey this is not
[56:50] a man doing it this is me I'm here I've
[56:54] taken contr control over this church and
[56:56] I'm going to move whether you like it or
[56:58] not I'm here and I'm taking control so
[57:03] the Holy Spirit begin to speak through
[57:05] me with authority with power with
[57:08] confidence with the word
[57:10] because I have no fear and one point I
[57:13] told them hey if you have the gold and

[1:04:56] they really do
[1:04:58] respect for the word that I believe our
[1:05:03] pastor has preed us
[1:05:10] here and Pastor Robert who were driving
[1:05:14] me all the way in and
[1:05:17] out was a
[1:05:20] pastor who had his own church but has
[1:05:24] left his church trying to help me out I
[1:05:28] need car and also he he was already
[1:05:32] watching
[1:05:33] this this local church way back even he
[1:05:39] told me he was watching Pastor Simon why
[1:05:42] Pastor Simon was preaching the seals so
[1:05:45] if you check the time Pastor Simon used
[1:05:47] to preach the
[1:05:49] seals and even getting through when he's
[1:05:53] preaching the the seals is checking
[1:05:55] Pastor Simon teachings and using it for
[1:05:58] his church pastor Simon don't know I
[1:06:01] don't know when when I was working with
[1:06:04] him then he was telling me and I believe
[1:06:06] he told him later on says Brothers I've
[1:06:10] watch he says he used to go on the on
[1:06:15] the YouTube or whatever that time I
[1:06:18] think we were using cassette video
[1:06:20] cassettes and thing like that Bruce Dale
[1:06:23] so he had has been following us for a
[1:06:26] long
[1:06:28] time on Pastor salimon teachings he love
[1:06:32] it so he was telling me and he was
[1:06:35] asking me questions questions upon
[1:06:38] questions one time one point I told him
[1:06:41] I said brother you want me to preach for
[1:06:43] you but you asking so much question like
[1:06:46] this when I get there what can I preach
[1:06:48] for you again I can't preach anything
[1:06:51] cuz I already you already know
[1:06:53] everything
[1:06:55] so I cannot preach so I then I could see
[1:06:59] later I could see the Lord didn't want
[1:07:01] me to go there no more Pastor went there
[1:07:04] but he didn't want me to the Lord didn't
[1:07:06] want me to preach for
[1:07:08] him but you know what every question he
[1:07:12] was asking me he told me himself Pastor
[1:07:15] even whether he know or he don't know he
[1:07:18] says every question I ask you your
[1:07:21] pastor came he didn't know nothing
[1:07:24] he pick it up one by one spoke it one by
[1:07:30] one took it f explain things further and
[1:07:34] he says my goodness when I hear your
[1:07:37] pastor I says now I can see why you have
[1:07:44] strong word of God in you like that
[1:07:47] because it come from the pastor and he
[1:07:50] told me he says I wish I could get out
[1:07:54] all the preachers in Ghana then you
[1:07:57] Brothers you desmon all your pastor
[1:08:01] three of you could preach to the whole
[1:08:03] nation but he says let me tell you one
[1:08:06] thing he says I can receive it but not
[1:08:10] many will receive it says even within
[1:08:13] the message not many will receive it CU
[1:08:17] you you Brothers you your your calling
[1:08:21] is a very high calling the pastor has
[1:08:24] really taught you and you know the way
[1:08:29] and it's not something joke is really
[1:08:32] says I'm a pastor but I'm just telling
[1:08:34] you from the bottom of my
[1:08:36] heart so I left with him sometime K
[1:08:43] condition I preach from there I preach
[1:08:46] on Michael Church which was the place we
[1:08:51] were going to do
[1:08:52] dedication so

[1:09:08] very tough unless you you really
[1:09:10] struggle in before you can get a phone
[1:09:13] so a brother helped me with a phone I
[1:09:17] try I get Pastor Simon while they were
[1:09:21] in
[1:09:22] hotel and I told him because Michael Was
[1:09:25] preparing for the
[1:09:27] dedication and Pastor I told him Friday

[1:09:35] so he wasn't able to go Friday so he
[1:09:38] asked me I told him brother I can go he
[1:09:40] says okay go in the name of good
[1:09:43] neighbor and go and be blessing for them
[1:09:46] so I went there and I spoke the word of
[1:09:50] God and the people were so blessed yes

[1:09:57] way
[1:09:58] back and the next day

[1:17:58] joke Pastor Simon has P his
[1:18:02] heart and I know it even myself as he
[1:18:07] was saying is true I am not really
[1:18:11] educated but one thing I can say with
[1:18:15] this I have confidence
[1:18:18] amen no man on Earth come Li to me about
[1:18:22] the Bible no man again not why I am
[1:18:27] alive you can Pastor Simon thank you for
[1:18:30] what you have PR to be wherever I'm
[1:18:33] working I want to thank the Lord for
[1:18:36] that thank you all my
[1:18:39] brothers the deacons the
[1:18:42] trustees those that sit in the peill
[1:18:45] here for long let us support Good
[1:18:47] Neighbor Ministry you don't know what
[1:18:50] God will do with you I know now what God
[1:18:55] has done with me and what God is about
[1:18:58] to do with me
[1:19:00] more and I want to thank
[1:19:03] you thank you brother cof God bless you
[1:19:06] real
[1:19:07] well amen wonderful even though he's
[1:19:11] given that report you will never be able
[1:19:14] to fully grasp it all unless you could
[1:19:18] have been there because like um
[1:19:24] well one church he goes to went to
[1:19:28] extremely poor and the brother that
[1:19:32] visited us here brother Danielle that
[1:19:36] congregation highly educated phds and
[1:19:41] all kinds of uh things like that that
[1:19:44] kind of people attend that church so
[1:19:47] when he's telling you that he goes there
[1:19:49] and he starts
[1:19:51] preaching and the Holy Spirit breaks
[1:19:54] them out of all their High wisdom and
[1:19:58] knowledge and uh because these are not
[1:20:00] just people educated in the country
[1:20:02] these are people that go out with the UN
[1:20:05] and this one and that they go out and
[1:20:07] and serve in different capacities and
[1:20:10] then hearing the word preached I believe
[1:20:14] in the correct way and bringing a
[1:20:17] balance to it it just shook them to
[1:20:19] their Roots it was a real blessing so
[1:20:22] when he said he was embarrassed because
[1:20:25] one of those men wouldn't let him go and
[1:20:27] want to carry his Bible and carry his
[1:20:29] bags and what not that's what he's
[1:20:31] trying to explain to you how God brought
[1:20:34] such humility and brought such Spirit of
[1:20:37] service on them that they don't care
[1:20:40] about that they just care about
[1:20:41] fulfilling the word of God and they just
[1:20:44] stood by our precious brother we thank
[1:20:47] the Lord for his grace amen let's sing a
[1:20:50] verse from uh hear the Lord Lord of
[1:20:53] harvest sweetly
[1:20:54] calling who will go and work for me
[1:20:57] today who will bring to me the lost and
[1:21:00] dying who will Point them to the narrow
[1:21:04] way shall we sing that
[1:21:06] together here the Lord of harvest
[1:21:10] sweetly
[1:21:13] calling who will go and work for me
[1:21:20] today who will bring to me the lost and
[1:21:27] dying who will Point them to the narrow
[1:21:32] way oh yes speak my

[1:21:52] Lord speak my
[1:21:56] Lord speak and I will answer
[1:22:02] Lord send
[1:22:04] me well that sounds good and it's easy
[1:22:09] to say that Lord sent
[1:22:12] me uh as it as you
[1:22:15] know I was prepared to go and to ordain
[1:22:21] the precious brother and dedicate the
[1:22:24] church over
[1:22:27] there but on the
[1:22:30] Sunday we're going to be leaving on the
[1:22:32] Tuesday morning Sunday I'm preparing to
[1:22:36] come to
[1:22:37] church steps out of the shower and all
[1:22:40] of a sudden a pain strikes me in the
[1:22:45] back and runs right down my
[1:22:48] leg and such a bad
[1:22:51] pain that that I had to cry out for
[1:22:55] sister Simon's help and so all she could
[1:22:59] do is try to help me to the bed because
[1:23:03] I couldn't
[1:23:06] walk
[1:23:07] and could not sleep because of the
[1:23:11] excruciating pains that was going on and
[1:23:15] then I could only think oh my God I
[1:23:19] understand now what brother
[1:23:21] Tim beers has been going through brother
[1:23:26] Tim the Lord let me understand oh my
[1:23:31] goodness gracious there there's no place
[1:23:34] you stand you're in pain you you say
[1:23:37] okay I'm going to lie down or sit down
[1:23:40] to get rid of the pain you can't sit you
[1:23:43] can't lie you can't stand you can't do
[1:23:46] anything yeah it's just pain pain pain
[1:23:50] and so it was bad r really bad so that
[1:23:54] when uh sister Simon of course well how
[1:23:57] are you going to go how how who you
[1:23:59] going to be able to go uh and be able to
[1:24:02] preach there the way you preach and

[1:24:07] I promis them that I am coming and I
[1:24:10] I've got to keep my word I got to serve
[1:24:13] the Lord uh right there so we then had
[1:24:17] to call the airline and arrange for um
[1:24:22] them to create um a situation where I
[1:24:26] can have help to be able to make the
[1:24:30] flight and so they arranged everything
[1:24:33] Wheelchairs and people and everything
[1:24:35] for that now I know you see me standing
[1:24:38] here you can't imagine me sitting in a
[1:24:40] wheelchair but I had to and I was in a
[1:24:46] wheelchair um going all in pain and they
[1:24:50] made sure they walked you in and got you
[1:24:55] properly seated and everything like that
[1:24:57] and then coming back from time to time
[1:25:00] to know how you're going on on went to
[1:25:03] over there to Africa but I went in pain
[1:25:06] I want to pause there to
[1:25:09] say it made me give glory to God for uh
[1:25:14] men like brother Samuel
[1:25:17] Johnson they're old now some have gone
[1:25:21] on to be with the Lord real
[1:25:24] missionaries men that uh hazarded their
[1:25:28] lives for this gospel this message of
[1:25:31] this hour this Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:25:35] not just talking about preaching the
[1:25:37] word men uh what's uh uh Kathy's dad's
[1:25:43] name if you can
[1:25:46] remember brother madx right here in in
[1:25:51] in London Ontario man was a a high
[1:25:55] engineer of the CP Rail and when he
[1:25:58] heard this message it struck his soul oh
[1:26:02] praise God that man took his entire
[1:26:07] family and mov to the Philippines so he
[1:26:10] can be there preaching the gospel to the
[1:26:14] people and himself and brother Johnson
[1:26:16] are the reason why the message is
[1:26:19] thousands of Believers are now all all
[1:26:22] over the Philippines uh following the
[1:26:25] message along with another brother by
[1:26:28] the name of brother Hart Larry Hart uh
[1:26:31] preaching the gospel and uh so God used
[1:26:35] them it made me think of men like
[1:26:37] brother Jerry Ro it made me think of
[1:26:40] many other men that were crisscrossing
[1:26:43] the world there was nobody to pay them
[1:26:48] there was nobody to uh pay their way or
[1:26:51] their Fair
[1:26:53] they worked on trucks they truck drivers
[1:26:56] they they were Ordinary People wherever
[1:26:59] and as soon as they got enough they went
[1:27:01] they went they went they they spread
[1:27:03] this oldfashioned gospel everywhere
[1:27:07] under the power of the Holy
[1:27:09] Spirit but
[1:27:12] now what do we have brother Bram said
[1:27:16] they will become
[1:27:19] soft begin to lose the faith
[1:27:23] some will not even go preach right here
[1:27:25] in the country or in the continent
[1:27:28] unless they know where they are going
[1:27:30] will provide them with appropriate
[1:27:33] offering I've even had one told me what
[1:27:37] we gave him was not
[1:27:39] enough and that he needed
[1:27:42] more uh to meet his expenses and stuff
[1:27:46] like that so provided him more but never
[1:27:50] had him again but I just just want to
[1:27:52] know that's the spirit that's prevailed
[1:27:55] upon the people even following this
[1:27:57] message they've lost sight of what this
[1:28:01] gospel is about it's the losing your
[1:28:04] life that you can save othersen it's
[1:28:07] giving up your all that you might Reach
[1:28:10] Out And Touch others it's it's become a
[1:28:13] a joke people like myself appear to them
[1:28:15] like being foolish uh you know uh what
[1:28:19] is this you talk about faith their faith
[1:28:22] is that they have to see or raise the
[1:28:25] amount of money they need for their trip
[1:28:28] or their flight or they're not going
[1:28:31] they're not walking out by real faith
[1:28:34] and trusting God Amen I'm not here to
[1:28:38] preach about that but I'm just trying to
[1:28:40] show you that a real servant a real
[1:28:44] missionary their look is not to their
[1:28:46] Brethren not to man it's not to Earth
[1:28:49] their look is to God their their Great
[1:28:52] Master and he is the one that's to lead
[1:28:55] them and guide them in every way amen he
[1:28:58] may decide to do it through people but
[1:29:00] that's not my business my business is to
[1:29:02] obey him and to follow his pathway and
[1:29:07] so he was actually trying and testing me
[1:29:12] to see if I would really
[1:29:14] go because was easy and I would be
[1:29:17] justified to say no no no because I
[1:29:20] didn't even we didn't even go to the
[1:29:21] doctor to check up to see what's
[1:29:23] happening no go so I went I arrived
[1:29:30] there already the the airline already
[1:29:33] wired ahead and they met me there with
[1:29:36] wheelchairs everything else and make
[1:29:39] sure you got off safely and took you you
[1:29:42] get safe to the car then you're not
[1:29:45] their
[1:29:46] responsibility anything happens to you
[1:29:48] they are not financially liable they
[1:29:51] make sure that they put you in that
[1:29:53] chair take you off so I got off and we
[1:29:57] went to the hotel during the entire trip
[1:30:02] while I was there I was in that pain you
[1:30:06] see me standing here when I came back on
[1:30:10] the flight I was still in that
[1:30:13] pain I was still in that in the
[1:30:16] wheelchairs again brought me back in the
[1:30:19] wheelchairs I come into the airp Port
[1:30:22] here
[1:30:23] wheelchair again and uh make sure not
[1:30:29] only they're making sure you get out
[1:30:31] there uh is there anybody waiting you
[1:30:34] outside they won't let me walk out they
[1:30:37] put me in the wheelchair brought me out
[1:30:38] and then when they saw my son they said
[1:30:41] okay you're going to take it from here
[1:30:44] in other words their responsibility end
[1:30:47] you can't sue them for anything after
[1:30:50] that because they right and of course I
[1:30:55] got placed into the car and um not
[1:30:59] allowed to fetch any bags or nothing and
[1:31:03] uh brought came home and I'm here
[1:31:08] because by the next morning I woke up
[1:31:10] the pain was less the next day less less
[1:31:15] it's still a bit in my back right now
[1:31:18] but during the entire week the pain has
[1:31:22] been
[1:31:23] receding receding
[1:31:27] completely and this is why I say that
[1:31:30] could only be God testing me and
[1:31:33] allowing that to happen to see what my
[1:31:37] reaction would be and I want to thank
[1:31:40] God I believe I remained faithful to his
[1:31:43] word and to his
[1:31:50] promise now the first service that we
[1:31:54] went into was the dedic ordination of
[1:31:57] brother Michael uh or day and the
[1:32:01] dedication of the Church Brothers do you
[1:32:04] all have some of the
[1:32:08] slides only
[1:32:12] one oh that's very strange you see
[1:32:15] there's 21 21 pictures in that folder
[1:32:21] and and I made sure I opened it up and
[1:32:23] looked at them all before I brought them
[1:32:26] here now I got here it's only
[1:32:28] one but anyway with with or without the
[1:32:31] picture just like brother coffee light
[1:32:33] or no light preach the gospel so um we
[1:32:38] did the dedication there but I wanted
[1:32:41] you to see some of the pictures of those
[1:32:43] people when the spirit of God strike
[1:32:45] them and their way of worship and H uh
[1:32:48] how they were just dancing around and
[1:32:52] men and women and the spirit of God upon
[1:32:55] them and God just blessed the church
[1:32:59] amen and we want to give glory to God
[1:33:02] maybe you allow us to show you that
[1:33:04] those pictures another time but uh um
[1:33:08] just imagine this brother with a little
[1:33:11] a little building made out of pieces of
[1:33:15] of um wood from trees that he could
[1:33:19] shave off the trees put them together
[1:33:21] and get some touch roof on top of it and
[1:33:24] God blessing that brother using him in
[1:33:28] such a way giving him favor with the
[1:33:31] king in that area seeing the changes of
[1:33:35] the people's lives and begin to urge
[1:33:39] them even though he doesn't believe
[1:33:40] Christianity he's still an animist and
[1:33:44] traditional but um uh gave the brothers
[1:33:48] some more land because it's benefiting
[1:33:51] the people uh and God blessed him in
[1:33:54] such a way uh that the the church moov
[1:33:59] from that little place and then we
[1:34:02] assisted him as you know we blessed him
[1:34:06] and he was able to build a little
[1:34:07] concrete Church um and uh they were
[1:34:11] rejoicing at that concrete church but
[1:34:14] now the building that he now has could
[1:34:16] fit maybe four or five of those uh it's
[1:34:20] about this size
[1:34:22] big as the size of this building and
[1:34:24] it's solid concrete that God has blessed
[1:34:27] him with and it's built in such a way
[1:34:30] that he's ready to put a second story on
[1:34:33] top so that offices and um if Brethren
[1:34:38] were to go and visit there would be
[1:34:41] apartment up there and stuff like that
[1:34:44] but just for you to know just because of
[1:34:48] our uh giving him for first of all the
[1:34:52] faith the revelation of the word and
[1:34:55] then secondly we backed it up by our
[1:34:59] giving small Gifts of Faith which was
[1:35:02] able to assist them and help them with
[1:35:06] their giving also is able to come to
[1:35:10] this point through these year time
[1:35:13] through the years and we want to give
[1:35:15] God the praise and honor for that amen
[1:35:18] I'm telling you you would be proud if
[1:35:20] you would see that
[1:35:25] and so um it was necessary for him to be
[1:35:31] ordained and uh just so you know already
[1:35:36] talked with uh the lawyer over there
[1:35:39] even before I went to see him I talked
[1:35:42] with the lawyer to make um arrangements
[1:35:46] for them to properly register uh
[1:35:49] register the church there there right
[1:35:52] because they have a different system
[1:35:55] that the church um has to be uh
[1:35:59] registered and it's the
[1:36:01] church that is the place that's
[1:36:04] appointed by the government to be able
[1:36:06] to marry people not the man but the
[1:36:09] church over here it's the man over there
[1:36:11] no it's the building because uh as was
[1:36:15] explain to me we are we consider
[1:36:17] ourselves a secular society so when it
[1:36:20] comes to the stuff in the church let the
[1:36:23] elders the deacons the pastor the
[1:36:25] Bishops deal with that we not into that
[1:36:28] deal with who you want to ordain or
[1:36:30] whatever you want to do and uh but with
[1:36:33] the marriage that has to do with the
[1:36:35] society now we have to do with that and
[1:36:39] so we registered the building right and
[1:36:43] so I made sure that I arranged for that
[1:36:47] uh with the lawyer to take care of of
[1:36:51] that and thank God for your ties your
[1:36:55] offerings with some of that I was able
[1:36:58] to made sure that the lawyer was is
[1:37:03] compensated he's got to continue to work
[1:37:05] after I'm gone CU I put him in touch
[1:37:07] with the pastor and they're working it
[1:37:10] out together for the glory of God Amen
[1:37:13] so then we had the great service where
[1:37:16] we ordained the brother by the laying on
[1:37:19] of hands uh along with brother coffee
[1:37:24] brother brother Desmond brother Robert
[1:37:28] was there too and we laid hands on the
[1:37:31] brother prayed over him and ordained him
[1:37:35] we explained before doing that to the
[1:37:38] people that to be the pastor and the
[1:37:40] minister we know he's already been
[1:37:43] ordained before the foundations of the
[1:37:45] world to be your leader and to be your
[1:37:48] pastor but for the society
[1:37:53] sake for the society's sake um for the
[1:37:57] respect of the
[1:37:59] society um for his usefulness in the
[1:38:03] society and we went on further to
[1:38:06] explain that many don't understand that
[1:38:08] a church is not just a spiritual
[1:38:11] institution but it it's one also who the
[1:38:15] government recognizes deals with social
[1:38:18] issues in the society so as a result um
[1:38:24] we know that that Minister needs the
[1:38:27] respect of the society that he has to
[1:38:30] serve not only the church he has to
[1:38:32] serve but the surrounding society that
[1:38:35] he has to serve he needs to have that
[1:38:38] respect and so uh this is also necessary
[1:38:44] right if that there was not that in the
[1:38:47] world he didn't need anything else but
[1:38:50] the the problem is it is there in the
[1:38:53] world and we have to face it and so we
[1:38:57] went on to speak and show them the
[1:39:00] importance of having the local church as
[1:39:03] a place instead of going to the patris
[1:39:07] and screaming out your problems and
[1:39:09] paying $300 as a sit in the chair you
[1:39:12] can come in the church and scream
[1:39:14] Hallelujah all you want and release your
[1:39:18] repressions loose all your inhibition
[1:39:21] and praise God and give glory to his
[1:39:25] [Applause]
[1:39:27] name you see I was giving them a reason
[1:39:31] so they understood why it was necessary
[1:39:35] for him to be ordained and for us to
[1:39:39] come and uh dedicate that church
[1:39:42] building we did the dedication one after
[1:39:46] the other he wanted to do two days but
[1:39:48] in the state I was in I could not go
[1:39:52] there one day come back the next day and
[1:39:55] then do another service it had to be
[1:39:58] just one day so I did the
[1:40:01] ordination and then did the dedication
[1:40:05] of the building explaining to them of
[1:40:07] course that it's not the building that
[1:40:10] needs the blessing it's you the
[1:40:11] congregation that needs the blessing and
[1:40:14] you are the real Church all of that
[1:40:16] begin to explain and preach to the
[1:40:18] people but uh nevertheless we want to
[1:40:21] dedicate this as a place where God's
[1:40:24] spirit can come and wait on you be wait
[1:40:28] for you uh when it's Church time the
[1:40:31] Holy Spirit the prophet said the holy
[1:40:34] spirit is already in the building he's
[1:40:37] already here and he's waiting on you to
[1:40:41] come into His presence so we began to
[1:40:45] explain all of that to them and what a
[1:40:48] blessing it was praise the Lord and and
[1:40:51] we pray that God will continue to bless
[1:40:53] them in such a wonderful way and to
[1:40:55] bless that brother in such a wonderful
[1:40:58] way to grow and expand his knowledge his
[1:41:02] understanding of the message and also
[1:41:05] his Outreach by the grace of God he has
[1:41:08] a great Zeal for that um of course his
[1:41:12] church is a small church because um
[1:41:16] there are evangelists over there that
[1:41:19] are just as big and bigger than some of
[1:41:23] the evangelists over here right um
[1:41:27] because I passed the compound of one of
[1:41:30] these people and the guy's place is like
[1:41:34] one or two blocks of
[1:41:37] buildings a church building to hold
[1:41:40] thousands I thought it was a Catholic
[1:41:42] church but it was not and so
[1:41:45] on you know so these brothers I pray God
[1:41:49] will continue to give give them a vision
[1:41:52] and to help them I don't have to worry
[1:41:54] about brother Michael he's got that Zeal
[1:41:58] because from the day we met him brother
[1:42:00] with a few people and and the spirit of
[1:42:03] God run the lights through the woods and
[1:42:06] get one bulb in there to be able to
[1:42:09] preach to the people in the bush and
[1:42:11] then when he preached and the
[1:42:13] congregation raised up the denomination
[1:42:16] threw him out right and we he heard the
[1:42:19] message we preached to him him he left
[1:42:21] there went on his own and went out and
[1:42:23] this is the result as we supported him
[1:42:26] so I want to thank God for you and your
[1:42:29] support that we are able to do this for
[1:42:30] the glory of God God bless every one of
[1:42:33] you here
[1:42:34] [Applause]
[1:42:38] today praise the Lord um
[1:42:43] and uh you must
[1:42:46] understand to leave the
[1:42:49] hotel to go to to where brother
[1:42:51] Michael's Church is it's a good hour and
[1:42:55] a half
[1:42:57] travel to do
[1:42:59] that and not an hour and a half on these
[1:43:03] beautiful
[1:43:05] highways that we have
[1:43:10] no we have a good hour and a half on
[1:43:16] um roads with
[1:43:19] potholes
[1:43:22] and when you've gone about half that
[1:43:24] distance then you really hit the road
[1:43:28] where I mean I tell you there's no way
[1:43:32] to avoid the
[1:43:34] potholes there's no way to dodge them
[1:43:37] they're everywhere so uh it's
[1:43:42] just you know like that my God I tell
[1:43:46] you and then understand with the pains
[1:43:50] that I was suffering the up and down and
[1:43:53] sudden bang
[1:43:55] oh bang
[1:43:58] oh all the way my goodness and I'm sure
[1:44:02] the devil must have been causing that to
[1:44:05] say okay you you should turn back now
[1:44:07] because my goodness look at that one
[1:44:09] there that now that's a big hole you
[1:44:11] thought you had oh but we pressed on by
[1:44:14] the grace of God so that is the kind of
[1:44:18] thing praise the Lord one lady wanted to
[1:44:21] come to the service um well we had to
[1:44:25] tell her no you won't be able to bear
[1:44:28] that you won't be able to take that uh
[1:44:31] distance and that kind of uh rough road
[1:44:36] so that's the kind of thing just to get
[1:44:38] to where brother Michael is because he
[1:44:42] went where um there was nobody and these
[1:44:46] people need to have the gospel and he
[1:44:49] took the gospel to to
[1:44:51] them
[1:44:53] well our next stop was brother
[1:44:58] Steven in
[1:45:00] Kumasi where um second largest city in
[1:45:05] Ghana and there we found that he was in
[1:45:10] a a bigger place than this than this a
[1:45:14] larger congregation and this of people
[1:45:17] and that was a a a Thursday night that
[1:45:20] was not even their Sunday morning uh and
[1:45:24] uh and so he he heard the message he
[1:45:27] believed the message and we just began
[1:45:29] to preach the word of God and there
[1:45:32] again a great blessing to them and he's
[1:45:36] in the state where he was just also
[1:45:40] handing over his church to a young
[1:45:43] Minister who happened to be The
[1:45:45] Interpreter uh handing over the church
[1:45:47] to him so we were both in the situation
[1:45:51] we were in a
[1:45:52] transition so it was just wonderful to
[1:45:56] talk with him and him to talk with me
[1:45:58] and for the gospel to go forth for the
[1:46:01] glory of God Amen and so we will keep in
[1:46:04] touch with them by God's
[1:46:07] grace next place uh we went
[1:46:11] to was to brother robbert
[1:46:16] akua and this is the
[1:46:19] brother that I you know he was in the
[1:46:22] other services but I saw him jumping and
[1:46:24] shouting Hallelujah and I was saying to
[1:46:27] brother coffee brother this brother
[1:46:28] seems to have a lot more understanding
[1:46:31] than some of the others but I understood
[1:46:34] why because later on I was able to
[1:46:38] understand that he has been watching our
[1:46:42] YouTube channel he has been watching it
[1:46:45] all the time and he said pastor I took
[1:46:50] what what you teach is just almost like
[1:46:52] I preach what Paul preached I took what
[1:46:55] you taught about the seals and about the
[1:46:58] church agents and every week I will take
[1:47:01] one and teach to the congregation just
[1:47:04] the same way so the people came up
[1:47:08] hearing the same word amen and what a
[1:47:12] blessing that was when I got there only
[1:47:18] to find out that that is the very area
[1:47:23] from whence my ancestry
[1:47:27] comes was traced right to the same area
[1:47:31] but I didn't know that he was in that
[1:47:34] area and so when I got there the people
[1:47:39] or tribes in that area were able to
[1:47:43] accept me as I am one of them they were
[1:47:48] able to see me from that the that uh
[1:47:51] line and so it g opened the door for me
[1:47:54] to share with them the word of God so I
[1:47:58] couldn't bring anyone sermon I was just
[1:48:01] speaking off the you know um off the lip
[1:48:05] and town just the word and it was just a
[1:48:08] blessing to them not knowing the reason
[1:48:12] why I was so scattered and going around
[1:48:14] the Holy Spirit was dealing with things
[1:48:16] in the church uh unknowing to me and the
[1:48:20] pastor said brother he says uh I I must
[1:48:23] confess that some of what you said even
[1:48:26] speaking speaking it was direct to me
[1:48:29] and for me all right it was dealing with
[1:48:31] me privately private things that the
[1:48:34] Holy Spirit just uh Expose and help me
[1:48:38] and also things in the
[1:48:41] congregation because sometimes there are
[1:48:43] things the pastor would like to tell the
[1:48:47] congregation but if he tells the
[1:48:49] congregation some of the people get mad
[1:48:51] and leave the
[1:48:53] church
[1:48:54] so sometimes the pastor will
[1:48:57] hesitate but you see now like brother
[1:49:00] coffee I just walk in there I don't know
[1:49:03] anybody I'm just here to preach the word
[1:49:05] so I preach the word amen and even if
[1:49:08] you don't want me I'm I'm gone tomorrow
[1:49:10] but that Pastor has to remain there and
[1:49:13] face those people if he said those
[1:49:16] things right so we preached the word and
[1:49:19] it helped to clean up the church and
[1:49:22] help to deal with certain problems that
[1:49:25] uh he had to deal with the Holy Spirit
[1:49:27] that's why you have five-fold a real
[1:49:29] five-fold Ministry and the spirit of God
[1:49:32] just begin to purge and deal with the
[1:49:34] church in a wonderful marvelous way
[1:49:39] thank God for that um and he's kept
[1:49:42] calling me because I came back the first
[1:49:45] night the morning I wake up I'm not even
[1:49:47] out of bed he calls me just hungry
[1:49:51] thirsty for the gospel and the message
[1:49:54] and yesterday called me again and praise
[1:49:57] the Lord and give him the glory to God
[1:50:00] so we thank God for him so we want to
[1:50:04] now do our best to see how we can help
[1:50:08] this brother Robert um because they are
[1:50:13] worshiping in a rented School
[1:50:16] room uh hot and everything else no
[1:50:21] washroom proper washroom they have to
[1:50:23] borrow one from somebody nearby and that
[1:50:26] sort of thing so he would like to do our
[1:50:28] best to be able to help him to slowly be
[1:50:31] able to have their own place of worship
[1:50:34] and be able to give glory and praise to
[1:50:37] God but what a blessing it was praise
[1:50:40] the Lord what a blessing when I thought
[1:50:43] about it that uh our work is not in vain
[1:50:46] amen and what we do and when myself
[1:50:49] Brother D brother Tim or whoever stands
[1:50:52] here it's not just talking to you this
[1:50:56] is going out to the world Amen and there
[1:51:00] are people some I don't know like I
[1:51:02] never knew this brother but he's been
[1:51:04] listening to and and that's what he's
[1:51:07] been feeding on uh there may be in India
[1:51:09] there may be in China they may be
[1:51:11] anywhere praise the Lord all we want to
[1:51:14] do is a blessing am praise the Lord and
[1:51:17] I want you to know this
[1:51:20] this is what this church was built on
[1:51:22] and is built on because when I came
[1:51:27] here came to this
[1:51:29] country
[1:51:31] $79 Us in my
[1:51:34] pocket and from there come to the place
[1:51:39] where God called me to preach to some
[1:51:42] people in St
[1:51:45] cines and the Lord moving in such a way
[1:51:50] that after a while when we needed a
[1:51:52] church
[1:51:53] building and had no money having faith
[1:51:57] in God trusting in his
[1:52:01] word and
[1:52:03] then going to the real estate and having
[1:52:06] the real estate agent come give me the
[1:52:08] price and then telling him that I would
[1:52:11] like to buy it and still not having the
[1:52:14] money now we talking about real Faith
[1:52:17] we're not talking about you going out
[1:52:19] and said well how much is it let's go
[1:52:21] raise the money and then you call that
[1:52:23] Faith No I'm talking about nothing out
[1:52:26] of nothing God create the world out of
[1:52:29] nothing right so I'm talking about real
[1:52:32] Faith so um we made the deal with the
[1:52:35] man said okay we're going to buy it but
[1:52:37] we have nothing but then all of a sudden
[1:52:41] bang here comes a brother uh he suddenly
[1:52:46] was in prayer and he feels led to send
[1:52:48] me 15 00
[1:52:51] US and another
[1:52:55] one feels led by the Holy Spirit to send
[1:52:59] me500
[1:53:01] us and I just praise God because I know
[1:53:05] that's the Holy Spirit operating because
[1:53:06] I didn't ask them I didn't beg anybody
[1:53:09] and then all of a sudden it comes
[1:53:11] together and there's the dunk
[1:53:13] payment and we were able to pay down on
[1:53:16] that
[1:53:17] property and that was the first property
[1:53:20] and God gave us Grace and wisdom how to
[1:53:25] move that up into um Bruce
[1:53:29] Dale uh that's the church up on in
[1:53:32] Hamilton that we had on the mountain in
[1:53:34] Hamilton at that time the name of our
[1:53:37] church was the Eagles cry
[1:53:40] Ministries that's when they took the
[1:53:43] picture and the eagle was seen in the um
[1:53:48] the sign of of the church we had a sign
[1:53:51] and brother Brooks I believe it was not
[1:53:54] even one of us brother Brooks took the
[1:53:55] picture and there was the eagle sitting
[1:53:57] in the nest just looking uh like that
[1:54:01] and all these wonderful Supernatural
[1:54:04] things and then God took us from there
[1:54:08] and brought us to Walker's line because
[1:54:11] now we are on a journey right the church
[1:54:14] is now in the wilderness uh traveling
[1:54:17] and from Walker's line God gave us
[1:54:21] Grace and this uh property uh came up
[1:54:25] for
[1:54:27] sale and one of the de their deacons
[1:54:31] came to me privately said you know I
[1:54:33] just feel led to tell you that this
[1:54:36] property is coming up for sale why don't
[1:54:38] you try and see if you can purchase it I
[1:54:41] said okay I will so
[1:54:44] um when I went and spoke with their
[1:54:47] lawyer asked them and they told me how
[1:54:49] many million dollars they want for
[1:54:52] it and when I'm going and prayer the
[1:54:55] Lord says no just tell them 1
[1:55:00] million how you going to 1 million and
[1:55:03] they asking Millions for it they'll just
[1:55:06] say you're not a serious
[1:55:09] buyer but I learned to obey the spirit
[1:55:14] so that's the offer we placed in $1
[1:55:17] million and when the that was placed in
[1:55:21] within the space of a week I got an
[1:55:23] answer your your your offer has been
[1:55:27] accepted you see the preser in Toronto
[1:55:30] the head office
[1:55:32] there they even though there were
[1:55:35] developers that was offering them
[1:55:37] millions that could purchase this
[1:55:39] property and develop it and whatever
[1:55:41] else and like that they rejected all of
[1:55:45] that and they gave it to us because we
[1:55:48] were Christians we we were Believers we
[1:55:51] want to hold to God's word we didn't
[1:55:53] agree we didn't believe what they
[1:55:55] believe but they just know we are
[1:55:56] Christians and so they signed it off the
[1:55:59] presbyter signed it off to us as
[1:56:02] Believers of the word of God Amen we
[1:56:06] thank God for
[1:56:11] that and so when I went to the lawyer to
[1:56:14] sign the papers uh like that I signed
[1:56:17] the papers and everything else the
[1:56:19] lawyer has this puzzled look on his face
[1:56:22] he says he says um do you realize what
[1:56:27] really happened
[1:56:29] here I said I think so he says and
[1:56:34] that's when he told me he says you know
[1:56:36] developers were here with their
[1:56:38] checkbooks open that they could sign off
[1:56:41] all the millions they were asking for
[1:56:44] and those people turned around and sold
[1:56:47] it to you all uh for for for 1 million
[1:56:51] he says tell me the truth who do you
[1:56:56] know because you have to know somebody
[1:56:59] of influence and of power to be able to
[1:57:03] bring about a deal like this is it not
[1:57:05] you know tell me the truth I said it was
[1:57:07] just God he said oh yeah
[1:57:14] God he was so
[1:57:16] dismissive he just oh yeah God God again
[1:57:20] everything like that is
[1:57:22] God he just would't believe it praise
[1:57:25] the Lord I walked out of his office and
[1:57:28] even at that
[1:57:31] point one of those developers hung
[1:57:33] around to meet me outside with his
[1:57:37] checkbook he says do you know you can
[1:57:39] make a big profit if you just just sell
[1:57:42] me this and I can write you a check for
[1:57:44] twice the amount or whatever right here
[1:57:47] now you will have this and I just look
[1:57:50] at him because I'm looking at him he
[1:57:53] don't understand what I am seeing I'm
[1:57:55] looking at the same one that spoke to
[1:57:57] Jesus said turn on yourself from here
[1:57:59] and you can get bread you know you
[1:58:02] know this will happen or that will
[1:58:04] happen you know I said no no no I said
[1:58:07] God gave us this this is our church home
[1:58:10] you know it's not the value so much that
[1:58:12] I'm impressed with them was that we were
[1:58:15] directed to be here and that's why we
[1:58:17] are here today and that's we praising
[1:58:20] God Amen so um I want you to know that I
[1:58:25] appreciate every one of you you have not
[1:58:27] followed me because I have any desires
[1:58:30] to wealth or
[1:58:32] riches everybody wants to be able to
[1:58:35] have a good life don't
[1:58:38] you you want to live happily you want to
[1:58:41] live without care yes everyone wants to
[1:58:44] be like that but I've never for once
[1:58:49] never at any time had the inclination to
[1:58:52] look after betterment for my in terms of
[1:58:56] wealth for myself or increase or oh you
[1:59:01] know like some evangelists do hand over
[1:59:03] the church to my cousin to my my my
[1:59:07] uncle to my daughter to my son no no no
[1:59:10] no no this is got nothing of flesh and
[1:59:13] blood will not inherit the kingdom of
[1:59:15] God real love of God has to do with
[1:59:18] Brothers and sisters who are your real
[1:59:21] brothers and
[1:59:22] sisters praise God I know I'm saying it
[1:59:25] but that's not real to a lot of people
[1:59:27] their flesh and blood is more important
[1:59:29] to them than their brothers and sisters
[1:59:32] spiritually speaking one being Eternal
[1:59:35] and the other one is just temporal not
[1:59:37] that you're not to love them but you got
[1:59:39] to understand the difference one you're
[1:59:42] going to live through all eternity with
[1:59:44] the other is going to pass on and pass
[1:59:46] away amen so let's put our faith in the
[1:59:49] right place praise God it's 5 to one and
[1:59:51] now you know I'm milking it
[1:59:55] now I'm I'm going to be finish in just a
[1:59:58] minute but I'm just wanting you to know
[2:00:01] that and so I'm been raised that way I
[2:00:07] seen my mother and father didn't know
[2:00:11] about this
[2:00:13] message but still they won't join any
[2:00:16] denomination until years later when I
[2:00:19] grew up after all those home Bible
[2:00:24] readings and memorizing the Bible and
[2:00:29] worshiping by themselves and they don't
[2:00:31] know why but they don't want to join no
[2:00:35] denomination and um here it
[2:00:39] is they will be going out
[2:00:43] and my mother and my father and they
[2:00:46] weren't ashamed they go on the street
[2:00:48] and preach the gospel
[2:00:49] El they'll go out and preach the gospel
[2:00:54] to win souls to
[2:00:56] Christ and not only that they will feed
[2:00:59] the
[2:01:00] hungry uh they'll help the poor and the
[2:01:05] downtrodden sister
[2:01:08] Simon before and when we got married was
[2:01:11] a absolutely a witness of some of this
[2:01:15] where some of those people sent for them
[2:01:18] and ready to sign all their property and
[2:01:21] everything over on many occasions not
[2:01:26] once and they said no you don't
[2:01:30] understand this is not what this is
[2:01:32] about we are not here for that and it
[2:01:34] absolutely rejected it I guess some of
[2:01:38] that influence came off on me so I have
[2:01:41] had no desire to preach the gospel for
[2:01:45] profit uh preach the gospel for this or
[2:01:48] that not for fame or for whatever but to
[2:01:52] always let him have the glory
[2:01:55] amen let him be glorified listen friends
[2:01:59] this is
[2:02:00] real this is true the gospel the devil
[2:02:04] is spawning such a Web of Lies and of
[2:02:08] evil in this hour that we're living in
[2:02:10] darkness all over the land amen uh one
[2:02:15] of the messages I preached over there
[2:02:17] getting used to the dark you know and I
[2:02:20] explained to them how I was in a
[2:02:22] restaurant and you know the restaurant
[2:02:25] was dark and but when I sat there long
[2:02:28] enough waiting on a meal all of a sudden
[2:02:31] I start being able to see in the dark I
[2:02:34] could see in the dark and you know I
[2:02:36] preach like that that's what's happened
[2:02:38] with some of you you comfortable now
[2:02:40] with the darkness around you and you you
[2:02:43] because you can get along with the
[2:02:44] people around you but Jesus said
[2:02:47] Darkness will cover the Earth and cover
[2:02:48] the of people right thick darkness and
[2:02:52] so we preach along that line and we give
[2:02:55] God the grace that was able to open
[2:02:57] their eyes of their hearts and I praise
[2:03:01] God for every one of you here today amen
[2:03:04] and as I step aside on December 31st uh
[2:03:09] brother Danny uh mazili comes to this
[2:03:13] place he's coming to follow the word of
[2:03:18] God
[2:03:20] he will not be used my style or my way
[2:03:24] of preaching because I as I as I
[2:03:27] explained to him and a few of the
[2:03:29] brothers my uh our group of of of
[2:03:34] preachers the first wave that came out
[2:03:37] after brother

[2:03:46] many others he called us young men wait
[2:03:48] till until them young men come after me

[2:04:13] offshoots of this that that and all
[2:04:16] kinds of differences but um we we all
[2:04:19] preach it together for the glory of God
[2:04:21] so brother sister that wave of men God
[2:04:26] used us to chop down the
[2:04:29] forest get rid of those big old naughty
[2:04:34] trees denominational opposition Fearless
[2:04:39] to break it down and thinking not of
[2:04:42] ourselves but thinking of the Gospel of
[2:04:44] Jesus Christ amen to clear the way
[2:04:49] Hallelujah so that a next wave will come
[2:04:53] right we who cleared the off these trees
[2:04:57] and planted the seeds of the gospel and
[2:05:00] it started to come up and bear fruit but
[2:05:03] now God is looking to you for
[2:05:06] Harvesters God is looking to you to reap
[2:05:09] the Harvest amen praise the Lord and

[2:05:39] way we have the message but inside of
