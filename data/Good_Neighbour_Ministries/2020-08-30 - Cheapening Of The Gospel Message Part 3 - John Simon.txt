Cheapening Of The Gospel Message Part 3
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good morning friends it's good to be here again in the house of the lord on this beautiful sunday morning we shall read out of the book of joel chapter 2 reading verses 17 and 18. it reads thus let the priests and the ministers of the lord weep between the porch and the altar and let them say spare thy people o lord and give not thine heritage to reproach that the heathen should rule over them wherefore should they say among the people where is their god then will the lord be jealous for his land and pity his people gracious father we thank you for the reading of thy word and as we continue to minister this gospel made the holy spirit anoint the words of our lips and the thoughts upon our hearts that while we speak your word may your word enter into the hearts and minds of thy people who are listening watching everywhere and may you receive all the glory and the honor and the praise for be asking in the name of jesus christ amen and amen now last sunday we ended speaking about the elders how that when the temple was being restored and they had laid the foundations thereof how that the younger generation of that day and time they rejoiced they were happy for at least the foundations were being laid and since they did not have the opportunity of seeing or experiencing the presence of god as it was in the former house they rejoiced at what they saw thinking that that was uh equivalent to the original however the old men or ancient men as the bible says that were there the bible says that they began to weep they began to cry in the presence of god because they knew about the glory of that latter house and what it was like and that it was cheating as solomon's shields were cheated from gold to brass so was the value of their worship in the house of god at that particular time and they recognized it for they were allowed by god to taste of both times or both so they could bear witness to the fact that then that the word of god that they had received in the temple was cheapened in the presence of almighty god and that is what i want to continue to speak upon the cheapening of the gospel message the cheapening of this message of this hour the standards and the quality of it going down instead of the people taking a hold of the word of god and growing closer to him in knowledge of him and walking in the light of his word they are beginning to accept anything that sounds like the word or like the message of this day and time now we realize then that the ships are are are have been anchored too close to the shore they're anchored too close to the shore where they who are on those ships in those churches following such leaders can easily take one or two steps back and they're back into the world or they'll take one or two steps this way and they are back in the church so they can go back and forth and have that kind of an experience in the world and in the church at the same time and that's all because they have anchored their gospel ships near to the shores of the world and its things and its pleasures and the things that are of the world they are in shallow waters and this goes for ministers it goes also for believers from pulpit to pew we see this everywhere my friends god wants man of god that will tremble in his presence that will tremble at his word man that will commit their entire beings and their entire lives to him and to him alone my friends in the iron which we live man of god preaching the word of god the way god says it in his word it will more have a sinning out of the crowd effect rather than a building up multitudes pouring in crowds being drawn in to the house of god oh my friends you can always have a crowd with these shallow methods of the world these techniques and tactics of the world are being utilized more and more by ministers who claim to be the servants of the living god so we are seeing the crowds building up the churches growing larger and larger but with real sons and daughters of god there's a sitting out amen oh they feel there be that find it and there's few my friends that will walk this straight and narrow way according to this promise and this word that's been given to us in this day and in this hour honestly speaking two ministers who were friends of each other the one passing by came to visit his friend and said oh i heard you had this marvelous uh revival meeting and i'm sure that you must have had a lot of additions and you must have had a lot of people being added to your church and his friend answered him and said i'm sorry but instead of additions i've had uh some blessed subtractions uh what do you mean i mean god cut out those that are of the world of the flesh and of the devil and that were distractions and god has added only to the church such as should be saved my friends i believe that is what we need today for the church is in a sifting time the church is on the threshing floor of the holy spirit where god's holy spirit is trashing the floor and checking upon his people to see they are that they are where he wants them to be most of the time in the in the building up of a building there is usually first a tear down and then a building up let me repeat in a building up of a new building there is usually a tear down before there is a building up i believe that it's the same thing in the house of god and in the presence of god there must be a first a tearing down a humbling a repentance of brokenness a softening by the spirit of god in the presence of almighty god before we can come to a place where a proper god-given foundation led by the holy spirit himself can be given to us in this way in this hour in which we are living but what do we see we look out to the churches yonder and we see the churches growing and expanding we see thousands being added we see the religious arrogance we see the religious pride and in this message we are seeing a lot of bright pride based on how many numbers do you have and how many numbers are you growing what's happening with your church not realizing god's plan and purpose is not based upon those numbers of man but god's is based upon the fullness of his word the quality and the maturity and the ripeness of those saints that have surrendered and committed themselves to the lord and savior jesus christ so we find we end up having a house full or a church full of members members that are drawn by a lot of the religious psychology that's being preached as the word of god for our day of how to live better how to have happiness how to hold on to your joy how to your relationships how that could be one uh full of happiness yes and preaching these types of of psychology religious psychology tends to call out to the needs and desires hurts and to the hearts of people that are in the word and it appeals to them and they're drawn by that they're drawn by that not realizing that that's not what god desires for them that they're not to be chickens they're not to be feeding on some meal given to them by a man-made idea or a man-made theory something that's just cheap in the presence of almighty god just like chickens takes them six weeks to have another set of chickens take six weeks to get another multitude of members six weeks to have those chickens and if you notice chickens love to say cheap cheap cheap cheap because they're nothing but chickens and all they can do is be cheap with whatever they offer in the presence and in the house of the living god god wants people who are willing to repent people who are willing to pay the full price for there is a price for a true pentecost there is a price to be a true genuine original seed of the living god hallelujah god wants a people that will love him that will love his word that will love one another that will walk in the promised word for this day and for this hour oh friends don't you see it in your bible how when jesus came to a city and he would weep over that city and cry over that city because of the wickedness and the worldiness that he would see in it we are to also oversee and whip over our cities that our churches are in that our people are being raised in the presence of god in the people should be crying out to god and calling upon his name but his divine presence will come and confirm his word for he has said in his word if my people which are called by my name will cry will humble themselves in the presence of god then god will hear from heaven and he will heal their land god wants men that will cry out to him may god help us as preachers that will cry out and ask god to bless his people god wants man that will tremble at his word man that will tremble in his divine presence man that will tremble as they wait in the quietness and the stillness in the all of the presence of almighty god that man like that will learn to tremble in the presence of god and when those men learn to tremble and press god's presence then the people will tremble at their word because the anointing of the jew of the anointing of the presence of god will rest upon them in every possible way as it did upon isaiah in isaiah chapter 6 isaiah tells of his experience when the bible tells how that in the year that king josiah died isaiah saw the lord in the year that his good friend whom he so admired whom he's all looked up to that person that your eyes are so filled with them with admiration for them when that person is taken away moved out of the way by sickness by affliction by death so that you can see god and god alone as uzziah was filling up isaiah's sight and so isaiah could not see the lord because josiah stood between him and the lord so god had to move josiah away so that in the year that king josiah died isaiah saw the lord how did he see the lord he had a vision of the lord he saw the lord high and lifted up his train filled the entire temple and how did the angel with their wings one going this way one going that way oh my and crying out in the presence of god humbling themselves in the presence of god if these supernatural beings were humbling themselves isaiah saw that he should be humble in the presence of god and he humbled themselves and say oh lord god i am unworthy i am unworthy my words are unworthy my thoughts are unworthy my ways are unworthy oh god help me and he cried out to god and the angel of god took a a coal of fire an ember that was upon the altar of god and flew with that and placed it upon his town that he might have the fire of god upon his soul oh my friend welded the song right and said when the crawl of fire touched the prophet making him as pure as pure can be then the voice of god said who go for us then the answer there lord hear am i send me speak my lord speak my lord speak and i will do answer lord send me speak my lord speak my lord speak and i will answer lord send me oh man so many preachers no so many believers hear the call of god's voice today and may the fire of god rest upon you wherever you are across the world may the fair god reach you and rest upon your soul as you catch a true vision of the lord jesus christ and like isaiah will be able to say i have seen the king the lord of hosts when a man a woman of god a child of god can say i have seen the king not the preacher seen the king not your mother seeing the king not your father seeing the king but you've caught a vision of jesus you've seen a vision of the lord you've got your own private personal vision of him your personal relationship with him and you are drawn closer and closer to him praise god forevermore then god will use you and anoint you in a special way i want to bring an observation at this time that there is a difference between an anointed ministry and just that gifted ministry for one can have gifts but those gifts have been with the individual from the day that they were born they didn't have to repent for those gifts to be in their lives they didn't have to do anything their gifts were there by god allowing them to be there for gifts and callings of god are given without repentance and so these gifts being in some people some will use it in the world become a psychic become someone out there that foretells things a witch or or a wizard because it's a gift of god placed in the person's life but was perverted by satan and being used by satan you see but because it is a gift of god but when that genuine gift of god comes under the preeminence and the control of the holy spirit god uses that gift for his glory and for his honor to bring the attention of the people to himself that they might see jesus only that when they look through the word they will see the lord jesus only praise god forevermore but instead we find great numbers of these so-called man of god out there so-called preachers preaching in the name of the lord living in the shallows instead of living in the deep and there they have a ministry that will razzle and dazzle men and women and draw them to themselves until the men and women seize them but that is not the anointing of the holy spirit that is not the genuine thing that god wants brother sister he wants you to surrender to him so that even if such a gift be in your life that he will have the control over it and use it for his glory oh how i'm so hungry i'm hungry to see anointed ministry anointed by the living god ministry that produces repentance that reproduces change by god's power to transform ministry that produces genuine heartfelt repentance that will produce real holy ghost births genuine births of the living god that one where somebody is crying out to god while wiping the paint from off their face or the mascara from off their eyes oh lord but one where men and women will come in the prince of god asking him truly for his mercy and his love god wants preachers whose lives and ministry will produce genuine heartfelt repentance not for one day but for an eternity lies transformed by the power of god preachers who have genuinely seen the king they have caught the vision of the lord of hosts and it brings them in the presence of god and they know what sin is they know what worldliness is when a man was being in the presence of god like that and he comes out he comes out with something resting upon him something eternal something supernatural resting upon his life my friends that will bring the people closer to god hallelujah may we pray that god will give us men of god like that may we pray to god for a fresh outpouring of his holy spirit upon his church in this end time as we are fixing and preparing ourselves for the arrival of our lord for the arrival of our bridegroom for him to come and catch us away as a thief in the night and carry his waiting bride home let us pray to god that god will bless our churches that god will bless our homes that god will bless us to have softened heart humble lives humble in his presence amen we don't want our lives to be dried up with light we're filled with thorns and twistles and and tears but we want our lives filled with the good seed of the land and watered by the latter and former rains so may we ask god to sin upon us in this hour both the first rain and the latter rain the teaching rain oh and the harvest rain upon the church of god in this last day let us pray to god that god will grant us a real heart warming heart searching revival within our souls that we will come out of our our sleep and our our mystery of the christianity you claim to be in that the holy spirit will draw your soul out to him for he said if i be lifted up i'll draw all men unto myself may he magnetize you by the power of his word and may he draw you unto himself that you might have a deeper work of god take place in your life a deeper walk with god walking him walking by his side and doing his will and may he keep us broken melted softened and producing true fruits of the spirit of the living god within our lives oh what a r that we we're living in france for when i look around what do i see i see there's building going on all around the country buildings going up everywhere even in the neighborhood not far away from where we are we see homes being built jammed together cheaply built yes sir many houses being put up like that cheap materials cheap clothing cheap covering everywhere they're made to seem so beautiful giving it curb appeal but no lasting beauty god wants a christian that would have a beauty that will last for all eternity a beauty that comes from christ and christ alone not a man made beauty slammed together by man that try to put up that spiritual house of god as quickly as they can and move on to another many churches are that way they are not built upon a solid god set foundation not built upon god's true foundation many are built upon man materials man-made doctrines and man-made thoughts of what they think the god's word says when the word of god speak to us in every possible uh way i believe it's time for us to clean up the house my friends judgment begins in the house of god from the janitor from the from the pulpits right down to the pews we ought to be cleaning up house and get people back into a supernatural contact with god again until they know him in the power of his resurrection oh praise god that they may be truly born again by the genuine coming promise by of the holy spirit to indwell their lives forever and forever and that they will not stand for deacons married four or five times men of god claim to be ministers married one two three times changing wives in every way they'll do that what a shame that god's church has come to a place like that amongst those that call themselves pentecostals and amongst even those that claim and call themselves that they are of the true word of god the message of the hour and instead of living the way god wants him to live they allow worldly glamour to begin to creep in the church they allow sin to crouch at the door and carry on call themselves saints and people of god so we see a lot of cheap impersonations now taking place and going on within the house of god we see back in the bible days when pharaoh said oh moses so you are doing miracles we'll do miracles too he called for his wise man and his wise men conjured up also signs and wonders just as moses did but god wanted to show what the original was moses is serpents it swallowed theirs up together and even so in the ministry that god used of that prophet and god is using in this day by anointed men of god those so-called gifts out there in the church world in the church realm all will be swallowed up by the anointed gifts but the anointed ministry gifts used by god himself in this day and in this hour of the holy spirit now women of course are always a type of the true church of the living god [Music] and as the women have made themselves cheap in today's world the church has made herself cheap also in the church world in which we live living in they have degraded themselves women have brought their value down they have devalued themselves they've lost respect amongst men anymore it's not there anymore they become like jezebel in the bible domineering dominating controlling with arms like the bands of iron like vines that will strangle a man and control him completely until he is either lost this manhood or he has half a man like ahab was in the bible has to ask his wife everything has to let his wife represent him uh let his wife do all the purchases acting like a king talking like a king but was nowhere in the real personality of a king and there he was the shallow shell of a man acting as if he was a real man when he was nothing but a shadow and a shame of making himself i was saying my words he was an imitation of a man and we have a lot of imitations of men today instead of real men where their women can hardly find real man that will stand by them and a man can hardly find real women that will be real women that would cheaten would degrade their standards their principles their oh praise god for women like that that will stand to the word of god and will stand with the principles of this bible that we have that man that will live by the word of god until the crown they gain in the presence of the living god god is still searching and looking for men men who will live by his word god is looking for man that has real genuine god-given character character not an outward show but a real character given by god god wants to see man and the people of this world wants to see genuine display of manhood produced by the word of god sheep they're cheap though you look up there and all you could see is the devalued degraded and cheating condition of men and women of the world and even to the quality of those who claim to be christians all devalued from the original value of what god and how god made a christian is supposed to be a cheap christian you have seen those very expensive and those priceless reproductions in the various museums you have seen the original paintings and and the sculptures of the genuine original artist and you go out in the street and you see cheap reproductions of that selling for cheap cheap cheap even so you see in the church world they look back in the bible at those original god-sent prophets patriots men and women of god darkest and sarah and and mary and genuine women of god and man of god that stand the test of time that like stephen and james and peter and paul and barnabas that will stand by the word of god hallelujah oh my and people are s no matter their life no matter their ma they still will love to see men and women that will live by that word of god today in the middle of babylon they live according to the word of god my friends we see in this hour of people that have become wishy-washy a people that have become so soft a people that will put their name on the church book a people that will do a little volunteer work in the church jump up and down shake themselves in the presence of god and in the church and call that christianity called that feeling that they get that that's what makes them a christian they believe that that is what makes them a son of god but god wants real christian real rugged not some hot house tomato that the moment will preach the word of god and begin to straighten the lines out they don't want the heat of the son of god to come upon them and to write them in the hour of this this summer hour this harvest time that we are in when the grain should be written they don't want their lives to be written by the word of god that we are we are here in this present world oh praise god when that kind of a spirit of almighty god strikes the true believer it's like a burning crawl of fire like the ember that came from off of the altar and rested upon isaiah's town that same oh ember affair of god resting upon your town upon your heart my friends that burning flame of fire it'll set your soul of fire and keep you my friends until the very end of time and right into eternity and will cause you to want to make converts to jesus christ amen but luck if you are in some church you claim to be a christian you claim to be walking with god then one day the word test will come god's word is going to put you to a test it may even be putting you to a test by your enduring listening to this message here today amen because for you to listen to this today there must be something in you that will keep you listening to the word of god for the easiest thing for you to do is to turn off your your set or to walk away from it or to stop your ears and not listen to what you're hearing but if you're a real son a daughter a child of god the great holy spirit of god says the deed will crawl to the deep and the deep will respond and you'll listen to the word of god as it comes to you in this day and in this hour so you see christianity genuine christianity is not an easy thing for when joshua and caleb went over into the promised land they found they had to face amalekites jebusites midianites they had to face animal rights all kinds of these ungodly paganistic nations that were right in the same land that there were to dwell in and many times you go into the church and right in the church you'll find a lot of these pagan ungodly spirits anointing men and women who are disguised under the disguise of christianity having that cloak upon them but the spirit that's moving them is not of god but is of the devil and causing them to do ungodly things and cause men and women to faith is this christianity if if this is christianity i want nothing to do with it but they were placed there by satan for that purpose to distract you to delay you to destroy you to rob you of the genuineness but if you keep your eyes you're going to see genuine sons and daughters of god and be able to live by the word of god and so joshua and caleb as they were in that land when they came back with their report they heard their friends telling moses oh there were terrible people over there those people are are terrible they are like giants and we are like grasshoppers we don't know how we'll be able to withstand the things of the world they have such wonderful great cities out there but they're giants to us like that but there were two men standing there joshua and caleb that were standing by the word and they were not moved by the things that were in the world or the things that were happening around them for their eyes were on the word of god and so they turned around they said wait a minute wait a minute were we looking at the same thing were we looking at the same bible were we looking at the same torah were we looking at the same word were we looking at the same evidence that we are seeing out there and you seem to be seeing and saying that they are they are giants and we are the grasshoppers well we looked at them and when we saw them they look like grasshoppers to us and we appeared to us that we are the giants amen and you know when that belief that fate that sought on originating within their hearts they were able to drive the enemy out of the land and to tear down the walls that were there amongst the people of god oh friends just imagine the first original church of the living god that we had and let us compare ourselves of christianity of today with the christians of the original church as we see here in the word of the living god i believe what we are producing is nothing but a cheap reproduction of the gospel amen and amen the real church of god that first church had rugged believers that did not run from persecution did not run from hunga did not run from fear and doubt or anything like that but they stood by the word of god and gave up their lives if it cost them their lives they were not ashamed of the gospel for the gospel of god was given to them amen praise god yes sir oh hallelujah one of them that was just claimed to be a deacon and yet the bible says philip lifted up his eyes and when he looked he saw the lord high and lifted up amen amen they stared as stone stephen but he stood against sin they stoned him but he stood up against sin oh hallelujah oh praise god and gave his full testimony that i see jesus standing up standing up to welcome stephen home standing up to say i'm standing in identification along with you and he gave up him in a ghost saying lord lend not this evil this sin to their charge we don't desire any hybrid reproduction of christianity today but we want a genuine christian produced by the original scene out of the genuine god sent heaven sent word of god for this day and for this hour amen praise god hallelujah countless countless thousands of dollars that people would give for a masterpiece of michelangelo oh my but one will take just a few dollars to pick up a reproduction that they have of the very thing that michelangelo did oh praise god hallelujah amen but let's shoot for the original let us walk away from that which is nothing but a reproduction where it can only be cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap and desiring the things of the world of worms of the world and the things of this earth instead our eyes should be fixed upon jesus and jesus alone oh glory to god hallelujah be real genuine men and women of god like joshua like caleb like david when he saw lion he did not run but he said you unwashed on godly felstein raise up yourself against the armies of the living god and claim that you'll come against men and women who have been anointed with the revelation of this hour they were anointed with the word for god for this day how dare you challenge the church of the living god and so david took up one of the revelations that he had one rock revelation and placed that within the sling of the word of god hallelujah the gift god had given to him and he swung that revelation and struck it out and hit goliath right into the intellectuals hit him in the forehead and down he came to the ground and down with any so-called church fall down will any theologian fall down will any man-made teaching fall at the strike of one of these god-sent heaven-sent revelations coming from the presence of almighty god fear not brothers and sisters don't back up don't back down press forward press on in the name of the lord jesus christ and destroy the armies of satan by the power of the hosts of heaven and by the word of god where are the genuine men and women of god today where are the sons and daughters of god today that will sound the charge sound the charge sound the trumpet of god and charge into the ranks of the enemy with the word of god one god one name one baptism one lord one one faith one birth amen and say i am resting upon that here i stand so help me god i can see no other i know no other i only know just said the lord from the word of god and may god keep us wherever we are around the world wherever you are my friend around the world standing true to god's unchanging hand bless be the times that bind our hearts and christian love our all fellowship of kindred minds it given to us from god above made god's love and may god's powerless presence keep us and bind us together until we meet again around the word of the living god you may face tests temptations trials and tribulations because of believing and walking this way but all to god's unchanging hand all to god's unchanging hand o praise god may you continue to hold to god's unchanging hand and he will hold on to you god bless you god bless the time we have spent here together united as one around the word of god and may he keep us amen and watch between us until we meet again god bless you my friends god bless you and keep you may god cause his face to shine upon you and grant you peace now and forevermore amen and amen [Music] do [Music] you
