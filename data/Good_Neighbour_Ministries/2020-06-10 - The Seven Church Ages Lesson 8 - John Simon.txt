TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good night to one of the wonderful to be here with you on another marvelous Wednesday evening may the Lord bless us richly together as we look into his wonderful words of life tonight we will continue our study and the seven churches or accurately the introduction to the seven churches I must spend this time to live in some background before I actually get into the church ages H by age so I'm laying the foundations for that and then after we will go into each church age as they unfold before us male or Miss Lee bless you let us pray gracious Heavenly Father we ask thy blessing upon thy word upon this wonderful gathering of people to feed upon the bread of life many receive handfuls of loaves from heaven may man from one high be rained down upon us and to You Father will be all the praise honor and glory for we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ my topic today is our coming god I'm so glad that our God is coming for he is not a god that's an idol on a wall or just a picture in a book or a picture in ur memory but he is a living God and he promised that he would come again and our Lord is returning to the earth again our scripture is found in Revelation chapter 1 verse 7 behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all Kindred's of the earth shall wail because of him even so amen yes my friends our God is coming he is coming Jesus is coming our great Almighty God this coming in person a prophet is coming our priest and King is coming our mediator is coming we find him the perfect one all in all he Jesus he's coming even so come Lord Jesus completely Lord for the tiny the short Amen yes the scripture says he's coming and he's coming in clouds clouds of glory just as he came on now Transfiguration when his entire person became a bright shining light with clouds around him resplendent glory and power around them unfolded around him he was just wrapped up in the grace power and glory of the Living God and the body that when he comes again every eye shall see him that means that this coming is not the rapture this coming is not the rapture I want to make that clear no this is when he does our Jesus comes to take over all the kingdoms of the world for the Bible tells us that the kingdoms of the world become the will become the kingdoms of our Lord and Christ amen hallelujah and he is king of kings and Lord of lords and every eye every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord yes our God is coming yes my friends he's coming to take his rightful place of preeminence in the eyes of man in the hearts of man there it is he's coming to take his rightful position and place and as the great perfect world ruler and between his courage second coming and that time Satan of course being a poverty' being a liar being a murderer being Antichrist will produce his own false Christ the Antichrist and trying to make him into a natural world leader to be the leader of one world government that is coming up but the Bible knows all about that and prophecies of prophets pocket that this the kingdoms will become the kingdoms of our Lord and His Christ amen amen forever forever and so yes my friends that this is also the time when he returns when he comes again his second coming when he comes the they who have pierced him with their crease with their traditions with their denominational doctrines they shall mourn and weep and wail and the people shall cry out in terror because of him who is the word that they rejected no we go to Zechariah chapter 12 verses 9 to 14 and that reads according to the Word of God and it shall come to pass my friends that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem and I will pour out on the house of David the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplications oh praise God the crowd for salvation and they'll ask supplications of kram to god to hearing answer their prayer and to forgive their sins and it further says and they shall look upon me this is God speaking this is our coming God speaking and saying they shall look upon me whom they pierced they pierced God they pierced them in the side and thank God many now will not accept because the ice let me blind them of their hearts may be covered over the travail but that they they shall see him and they shall we weigh unborn because they're recognized they are rejected the Word of God which they did not recognize as the true word the true bread the gentle Shepherd of the sheep fo the chief Shepherds they failed to recognize who he was at that time him whom they pierced no you'll ask the question will rather silent when is the gospel returning to the Jews now of course when the dispensation of the Gentiles Gentiles is over that is when the gospel light will return back to the jewels I as I have a foreign mention the Sun rises in the east it sets in the west and then it returns back east again to rise again the next morning so the gospel light which came to us in the West came from the east came West and now the West finds itself politically religiously socially in a muck and mire of sin unbelief and rejection of the Word of God and because of this if the mud is written across the corbels the glory is demanded the glory is the part is gone away now and it's going away we find the Holy Spirit is seeping out leaking out of the churches out of religious institutions out of the nations that once accepted him and praise and worship him all my friends and the light of God is going back east again and returning to the Jews now from the signs of the times that we see around us it's just about that time when God's time clock is striking the mid-late out it's a new day dawning upon us a new dispensation is about to begin of course personal rapture let's go one must leave one image must be over one dispensation has to go for the new dispensation will train to come upon the sea and some friends I'll tell you it's about time that certain important events and things begin and the groundwork has been laid now for that to happen so we see according to Revelation 11:2 witnesses a revelation prophesied in the Word of God found in revelation 11 those two witnesses are supposed to return these two witnesses will be prophets sent to the nation of Israel of course I believe that those two prophets will be Moses and Elijah you say why brother salmon well how do you know that it's not late written in the Bible how do you know that we understand that Moses is recognized as the Jews Jewish people's she's law giver and Elijah the prophet it is recognized by the Jewish people as their sheath prophet so the two witnesses I believe and identifying the well be Moses and Elijah returning to the Jews for they are about the only two that the Jewish people will accept and believe to be they're genuine by the prophets praise God hallelujah and now we are ready for it for the Gentile dispensation is now on its way out it's traveling out why one age or dispensation is traveling out and going away another one is coming in and there is a kind of overlap and then the total separation will be recognized by that time when some recognize the separation and the living world and the arrival of another would be too late for them they will already have been caught in the Tribulation Period as I mentioned before events around us the Scriptures identifying and telling us by signs that we are now in the pre tribulation period and it's just about to change moving from Jacobs the time of Jacob's sorrow right into the fullness of the Great Tribulation not just turning of trouble but turning of the Great Tribulation coming upon us no the Jews the Jewish people they brought the gospel to us Gentiles who were considered dogs we were considered as nothing but yet God in His grace and in His mercy anointed the apostles of that day in time Peter being Jewish Paul the Jewish and so on now and God use them the Jewish people to bring this glorious gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ to us Gentiles here and so we find as the ages and as the dispensation changes so will the Gentiles take the gospel back to the Jews and I believe there were a lot of brothers Christian Brothers of various stripes and denominations some being used at this particular time engage in that great work of God each one has their part and their peace my friends and each one just has to be faithful and do their part so that the work of God can be accomplished now some people are against the taking the gospel to the Jews but I believe it's here in the word that we must take the gospel back to them before the time of course it is not acceptable but now is the coming now is the changing of one of the age now is the season when these things must be done and so the Word of God must the message of the hour in particular must go back to the Jews the gospel light the rising of the Sun must return and rise in Israel again so friends when all this is over the scripture tells us here in the Word of God every eye will see him this as I said is not the rapture it's the second coming of the Lord to the Jews and it says every eye shall see him all friends that means all the Jewish people are going to see him praise God I'm not going to go into talk about the Bible already prophesied in television and internet for back then they would have wondered and the amazed how is every I'm going to see them but we know even if it's not supernaturally even naturally we know that is now possible but it's already here in your Bible those two thousand years ago it was written in the scriptures that all the world will be able to see this one person at one time together it's there in the book and so they every eye is says I repeat shall see so all the Coliseum Ollis only the sleeping virgins also called the remnant of the church will see him now the Remer what is the remnant the remnant are those who lived as Christians heard the word from my friend away from my friends to speak to bring his children to him but of course we recognize that the seed shall not be heir with the shock and we also recognize that if there is no seed planted in the hearts of the individual by the brakes or when when the water former rain falls upon the sea my friends there is nothing there to be born again if there is no scene of God if there is no soul of God that lives will eternal life here there is nothing to wake up oh praise God forever but thank God for election predestined choosing one of them I believe if you trust God you will know for sure that you are one of them and so every eye will see him the Jews will see him this sleeping virgins will see him true tradition true all their Creed's and their dogmas and there similary learning from the world clock twisting the Bible consciously or unconsciously and getting aware of mrs. miles from the truth of the word of God every eye shall see him whether or not or hell you're not our God is coming I'll tell you and every eye shall see him no my friends I'll tell you that there will be at least three groups that will go through the tribulation period 1 I believe the Jews themselves will have to go through the tribulation period for that great nation it will be attainable purging for which I believe because of their national sin of the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ the national sin of not recognizing their Messiah their Joseph who God used among the Gentiles placed him among the Gentiles just to be able to preserve your life but then we find that they will have to go into the tribulation for a purging and cleansing and all by rebel of his divine person to them and by the preaching teaching and testimony of the two witnesses out of them of course welcome the 144,000 for thousands and not deceive you that not bewilder are blind you that the form 144,000 are not Gentiles they are Jews it's written in the book of Revelation and of the tribe of Judah 12,000 of this strike 12 and so names the tribes so that not Gentile be deceived into believing that they will be four thousand you as their white father them to be redeemed and brought back to his side born again free from sins what do you know light working in the shining light of the revelation of His divine presence hallelujah glory God so we find also the foolish virgins the women of the church that fail to recognize just first in his presence and the power of his word they will be everyone but they rejected blinded by their personal private interpretations and teachings and creeds and dogmas of man perverted them Oh a misdirect of them away from the genuine Word of God and so friends we understand that their friends that they are the remnant of the church that came up from the seventh church age the leftovers of the seven Church age into the tribulation again for them to be purged from their bodies and their uncleanness of rejecting God's word of that season and time we find friends also the Antichrist group the total Antichrist group that comes right up and said I don't believe in any God I don't believe in Jesus Christ various different kinds of religions that take that approach I don't even want to hear this name they wanna hear about this person or the O so far too soon I accept him as a prophet but better but I don't believe that he is God my friends every eye shall behold him and those that pierced him shallots that time recognize who he is when he comes in his power and his great glory now I told you about you will go through the tribulation but according to the scriptures of it also tells us that the Church of the firstborn will not go through the tribulation period who was this Church of the firstborn who are these it is the lens life it is who we sometimes call the Bride of Christ but what she's married to him but something I believe in his word she becomes the Lambs wife and he in the language permit his wife to go through tribulations so I believe in a pre-tribulation rapture the Bible teaches a pre-tribulation rapture the brain goes up and the and the tribulation comes in this fierceness and to reach reach and the purge my friends those that disbelieves the Word of God now at the same time while there is a time of Jacob's trouble trial tribulation and that very tiny when darkness is upon Israel the light begins to come up the Sun begins to rise and the light of God begins to shine upon them and favor them once again and that's already beginning to happen but the fullness of it cannot be fully seen until the lens wife the what we call the brightest bride is taken out of the way then we find they'll come into their glory and into their power also into the tray of the tribulation the purging as it is and what is going on the Bible tells us God is going to pour out his Spirit upon the house of Israel the same spirit the same Holy Ghost the same on this spirit that men marry Peter Peter John and all the disciples dance and praise God worshiping him speaking in tongues glorifying God in that upper room praise God hallelujah that same holy mouth will come him to anoint the nation of Israel listen to the scriptures and they shall look upon me who they appear and they shall mourn for him as one born for their only Son and there shall be an bitterness for him one that is in bitterness for his firstborn and that day there shall be morning in Jerusalem as the morning of everyone in the valley of megiddo and the lamb shall born every family apart the family of the house of David apart and their wives apart and then the family of the house of Nathan apart and their wives apart and it's one of the houses apart when he comes in clouds of glory my friends at his second coming now the Jewish people think of Pierce him shall see here as it says that he will ask the question whence cometh these ones they'll ask him Messiah in your hands side and this victor says he'll answer from the house of my friends I receive these wounds from the house of my friends what a mournful morning we begin the morning it will be great day when the Jewish people shall tear their clothing trashes upon themselves we were born in the presence of they come in come the coming Messiah none other than Jehovah my god of the Old Testament who became Jesus of the New Testament and they could not recognize that at that time that time for a small said for a bail was placed over their face but when the veil will be taken away we shall see I believe their hour of seeing and coming and recognizing is now hitting upon us listen my friends not only mournful time for the Jewish people but it will be a wonderful thing for those from the Gentile Church Oh friends because they rejected their Savior which was nothing imagination of their mind of the man that was the Prophet and message of a prophet not the Prophet but is message Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever oh what a change that will be within your heart and in your life so the chickens when they recognize them and they were left behind for they recognize their Savior world their Savior message they recognize the defendant recognized or let me say this they fail to see or value the unrecognized presence of their God in their midst in the word form or in the form of the world the only weeping and they'll be wailing the sleeping virgins will wail and you know the sleeping verses virgins you say one day they represent the foolish church as you as you know in the Bible tells of the ten virgins by twice five foolish fight that were wise took the message it took the oily they took the word for their day the Holy Spirit in the lines amen while the others rejected the anointed Word for the hour and that represents them refusing to take the oil for their day they refused to take the oil which is a symbol of the Holy Spirit within their lines their laps friends you know they the holder of the oil until it was too late praise God friends I want you to know it is not that these were bad people there were good people there were merchants which signifies clearly to us they were of a high moral order and they didn't have oil in their lamps so they were cast out and the scripture says there was wailing and gnashing of teeth now remember friends they also which pierced him now think of it the scripture singles this singly they who pierced him suggests to us my friends that he will pay special attention to those who pierced him who are they my friends did the Jews who pierce him spiritually they pierced him but normally they say oh well we never crucified Jesus it was the Romans but you see the spiritually person because they were the instigators for the weather the federal power the religious power stay behind the scenes get the suggestions and get the motives and to the Roman were meant to do that crucifixion in the position where anything takes a step back and said what we never did it but you did do it because you did it spiritually my friends and his blood is on your hands Pilate the Rubens pierced him naturally in his hands in this feet and sight as you know in the Word of God oh my friends I tell you friends think of it then they the denomination's are no piercing him for nearly cheating in the world and they are kissing him from their puppets they are piercing him by their word teaching and preaching rejecting God's prophet messenger but his ministry message they are piercing him the second prediction of our Lord Jesus Christ now recognize my friends what's going on that they are the the Joseph is him spiritually the Roman spiritum naturally now we find the denominations piercing him spiritually and naturally for the finish appears in him spiritually in the word form and then they are piercing him in the presence of his people just as he said to Paul Paul saw why persecutest thou me me for he was in his people and that is what is taking place right now my friends I tell you these virgins though they were good clean living people church-going people you could not find a Fault in their life but their mistake they rejected the messenger for their day they rejected Jesus they rejected message for the that date and that time and now this is outrage this beer appeal against with rejecting the message and the messenger of their dispensation although friends he says they will look upon me those who Pierce me will look upon me o friends I tell you this makes this more hurtful when he who came our Lord gone from his glory everliving story my garment Center came and Jesus was his name when he came to visit his friends Gentiles sing around with them but he came bringing gifts his friend to me believe and claim to be his friends yes but rejected they give up they took the gifts that he brought and yet they killed him they will talk about me whom they have pierced [Music] why do you think the very gifts that he gave to them God have mercy God help us in this hour they guessed that he gifted them by His Holy Spirit you're taking those very gifts and piercing him and rejecting him Oh what are we being and wailing when the loss will be told of their fate oh they'll cry for the Watts on the mountains but their prayers and the cries will be too late God have mercy gracious father we thank you for the mystery of the world may the spirit God take riding upon the word father and creep in the world let the word of God live within the hearts of the people and to recognize what is being said not listening to me as a man just speaking words but my words mean nothing father that falls to the ground but if there's one word you spoke with in my words men they hear your voice within my boys and you take the praise
