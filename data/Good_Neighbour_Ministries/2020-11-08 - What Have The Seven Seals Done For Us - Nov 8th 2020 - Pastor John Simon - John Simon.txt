[Applause] [Music] oh glory glories [Music] oh [Music] in [Music] oh [Music] yes [Music] oh [Music] oh come and go with me to my father's house [Music] okay praise god amen amen when you see the devil fighting you have to praise god because you know god is up to something big is that right so let's put our trust in him amos chapter 3 verse 8 the lion has roared who will not fear the lord god has spoken who can but prophesy i've been to africa and if you've been there and you ever heard a lion roar you better be fearful especially if you're out in the wild because you're not in the zoo now out of the bus or or something like that a real lion could come out and they are not joking around they'll just cheer you to pieces so when a lion's voice is hypnotic so when they're roar it gives you have a general idea of where the sound is coming from but you really don't know where they are and it causes the animals to go a while and they run and sometimes they're running right into the to the dinner table of that line so a lion has roared who will not fear the lord god has spoken who can but prophesy preach declare the word of god revelation chapter 6 verse 1. thank god we have a witness because john said and i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and i heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see let us pray our gracious god our heavenly father we ask your divine blessing on the breaking of the bread of life may the words written on the pages of this bible come to life give us light life and power give us divine understanding open the ears of our hearts and unstop our blinded eyes may our deaf ears hear the voice of god speaking in these last days as we commit ourselves to you in jesus name amen and amen the lord bless you please be seated our subject for today is what have the seals done for us you know it seems today like most people know about the seals and they may know uh you know they may have a general idea of what these seals uh do we want to talk about what have the seals really done for you it's not enough to talk about it and say the seals this and and the seven seals that and oh the thunders and i like it and whatever but what really have those seals done for us since the prophet of god opened up the word and this is the problem we face in the church and in the message that some people don't seem to know what the seals did for us they just have the general smattering knowledge of what the seals actually did for us
