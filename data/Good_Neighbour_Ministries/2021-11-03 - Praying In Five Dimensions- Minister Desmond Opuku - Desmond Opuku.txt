really teaching us something that is very powerful that there's something that lives in us which is called the holy ghost which is god himself that is changing everything that needs to be changed in our lives in order to change our bodies amen praise god it's called perfect faith it's called greater is he that's in you it's called the power of god to transform each and every one of our lives and so as we invite our brother let's sing that song greater is he that is in me you want to tell that to the devil every time you get down on your knees or you're facing a situation it's not your ability you tell listen i got nothing that i can give but there's something greater in me that can overcome whatever it is that i need to face amen praise god greater is he that is in me greater is he that is

started the work he's going to finish the work amen you know if you read today's journal it said that you know his thoughts towards us they're just bountiful they're just they're constant he he's constantly thinking about you can you imagine that that he's constantly thinking about you aren't you happy god bless you brother desmond take it away my brother god bless you [Music] praise the lord hallelujah you know i always like noise especially when we are in the house of the lord amen before we we start editing here we're gonna read uh can you put a slide number eight [Music] yes before we start can we pray heavenly father we thank you for this day father what a blessing to be here this great evening father it has not been for you where we stand this evening thank you for your grace and mercy father your believing children have gathered together assemble ourselves in your presence we invite your person to feel the entire praise help us to rejoice and praising and adore you because you are here with us we thank you we give you all the glory and honor in the name of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray amen can you put the the tape the the tape for brown or maybe i read the scripture first let's read this the scripture rebel 13 13 8 jesus christ he found it jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever amen please you may be seated do just have patience does everybody have patience praise god hallelujah thank you lord you know it always happened to brother simon when you're about to bring something there's always something there but this is a rare blessing that i want i want to pray for so that everybody will be encouraged for what is going on these 40 days of papers if it doesn't work i'll use my phone so that i can okay you can hear my my phone is it my birthday because the rear bracing reveals was in captivity it was israel and they were down in egypt and was made hard and rigor to serve the egyptians it seemed like that everybody had just grown cold did you know israel was in egypt twice as long as the united states has been a nation we're not over about 150 or 70 years old something like that and they were 420 years in bondage or down in egypt but it come up when it seemed like that all hopes is gone but there was one man and woman who seemed to have faith in a historical god that spoke to abraham in the time of crisis and they believed they could call on him and he had answered [Music] [Music] the mother and father of moses and sure some time ago i was preaching and gave a little illustration of how that amram would come home at night and he'd say joseph i am so tired and the fresh lashes on his back from a taskmaster's whip and she would sit down patiently perhaps and wash out the the places and weep and say oh abram isn't there something that can be done [Music] i would hear him say oh dear if you'd have been with me today and seen them beat them young boys trying to pull those loads but they were heartless they treat them like they were animals and that's our young man of israel isn't there something can be done that's what i wonder now to see our young teenage boys that will be the men and women of tomorrow our teams today hair down in their neck and breeches pulled out over their hips of the pistol stuck in their side a cigarette in the side of their mouths what will it be it's slavery under the devil isn't there something that can be done [Applause] and amram perhaps one of the only ones of the nation would climb up for little stair steps regardless of how tardy was there each night he'd call on the god of abraham [Music] one that he had learned that come to abraham and come to job and come to eyes and can come to jacob and hours of distress and surely if he was god in their day he'd be gone in that day and if he was god in moses day he's god today [Music] he just needs to be called up out of history and called on the scene of action and i can see and night after night no matter how tired [Music] proved his faith in that god but today the people if they don't get everything they ask for the first time they pray they seem to think that he's dead [Music] what we need is men and women today of god's spirit [Music] men and women who are determined to hold on until they see a god that really lives come into action [Music] that will not take no for an answer they're determined to stay with it if they are and the doctors said they can't get well yet something within them tells them they're going to be well hold on no matter what takes place if you've joined the churches of the denominational world until you accept all your strength from walking from place to place and you still can't find relief there's still a god that answers prayer and saves from sin amen as we can see amram on those weary nights back bleeding climbing up the steps again until two and three o'clock in the morning praying and seemed like he's just talking to the wind down in his jewish heart there burned of faith that no winds of doubt could ever blow out [Applause] that's the kind of men and women we need to rise on the scene today if he doesn't answer tonight he will tomorrow night if he doesn't answer this year he will next year for he's a god not a god but the god and we see night after night as imran climbed the steps and jehoshaphat would come up to him and say amram dear you've been up here praying all night why don't you just tell some of the boys where you're working and let them pray a while well honey what if they don't do it somebody's got to do it somebody's got to pray through that's the way every christian ought to feel tonight not waiting for somebody else but take the ourselves and go if through believe the bible to be a history it's also a prophetic book that tells that that same god shall rise in the last days it is time for him to come on scene that's what anaram know that moses had prophesied or not moses pardon me abraham have been given a promise by this god of history who hadn't answered a prayer in 400 years as far as we have record but he made a promise that he would bring them out and just seemingly we've had a silent god for a long time but the hour has come where he's going to rise on the scene one night when amram had prayed maybe for several years and his hair now was turning gray and no deliverance but just getting worse one night he got right down to business that's how we have to do it get right down to business he said what you promised this and we've looked forward to it and we see the signs all year and the time is at hand it's time for you to do something about it while he was in deep concentrated prayer praying with all his heart he looked standing in the corner he rubbed his eyes and looked again there's still an angel with a sword drawn he said deliverance is coming and you're going to bring a son into the world and he's going to be the one to deliver him see god always answers prayer doesn't he am i if we just hold on hmm praise god amen hallelujah yes this is the message today god always answer prayer jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever the same god that the prophet was talking about is the same god here today he is doing the same thing he does not change we are in the 40 days of prayer we're going to talk about how god is so good as brother tim minister last sunday god is good he never changed what he started from the beginning he is doing it today praise god we're gonna we're gonna go to slide number three when when we see it in god we see god no sorry we see it in god's creation what does the creation of god means to you tonight everything that we see around us speaks of god yes we we can talk about ourself as a human being only us can be a full sermon for what god is doing in our lives what about the stars what about the wise men the three wise men what about the moon they are all god's creation right the life we live daily speaks about god because the bible said we are the written epistles in our heart known and read by all men second corinthians 3 2 to 3. we can say we are christians not just the name christianity is the life that you live every day speaks about god speak about what you are what kind of christian you are hallelujah by coming to a church alone doesn't make you a christian our life speaks more than anything because we just read it see the life that we live daily speaks about god it's not just to uh i mean just like your hair your nice clothes and editing that makes you a message believer is god that inside of you coming out that makes you a christian because we see when we read we read the bible we see the life of our forefathers that release even when they go outside even their shadow by walking their shadow itself people can get healed so your life is always a prayer life it's a constituted life to god because we we we come over here always to service serve god right we don't come here because brother simon is here oh brother brother uh uh christopher is here or whatever the sister is no this house is the house of god we come together here every time we come together we have to prepare our ourself that we are coming to meet god and we are not coming here and go back the same way that we came so if we have been here 30-40 years there's supposed to be a change in our lives hallelujah nobody can tell you all the church door is open so i have to run because i know when i come here i get something special hallelujah because i cannot live without eating you eat two minutes a few a few let me say you eat right now four hours time your belly started grumbling why is hank you hungry you need a strength so prayer and coming to church is one you cannot come to church without reading your bible and pray prayer is a christian work it's a christian life i can come and tell you and uh or anybody come and stand here and tell you you have to pray it's something that you have to know that that's your strength that's where your life lies as a christian why do you think that paul and all of them walking and the demons free because what their their dedication to god is real it's not a joke for us to come here it's not a joke it's real but abraham said if you want to be a christian be a christian if you want to be a bomb be a bomb there is no in between hallelujah thank you lord we should always conduct ourselves obedient to the word of god not to conform to this world here the world cannot give you nothing hallelujah praise god hallelujah amen we're gonna you're gonna give me you're gonna give me slide number five can you phantom the limits and limits and bounds of the greatness and the power of god the sky is no limit for god but it lies beyond your rich god knows the world of is dead but you do not know it god greatness is broader than the earth and rather than the sea it says there is no limitation of almighty greatness and the power of god in this world or where to come there is no limitation god is what we must all what we must do is to surrender ourselves completely to him just to be a tool that he can be used when needed when as a christian as a message believer you have to adopt a life christian life that you always be ready when god needs you you are there to be used it's not just to we all gather together here this time here is not a joke the word of god is real the baton is passed to us we are running the baton right now you know when god gave the commission to moses he gave him a sign and he said if they don't listen to you i will show you the sign rebrand has sent has given us the message right now there's a sign to it but abraham everywhere he go people recognize him that god is with him if you last time somebody said even pope said everywhere his footsteps is blessed now he said i must decrease he must increase when the lord jesus christ was in the earth and john the baptist baptized him i john the balance said he i must decrease he must increase what happened so many things happen why that was the word the manifestation of the word of god people get healed people get saved people get what they want for god and god's name begin to shine now the message is in our hearts we cannot do it alone god has seen you you have to contact him how can you contact god is by prayer how can you talk to god it's by prayer you cannot just live without prayer prayer is one of the most important in the christian life do we think apostle paul knew that god god would use him to that extent he fought against god but his son was too short to fight with him he tried to injure himself god by his own theological teaching and power but he couldn't work until he met god face to face and surround fully to him what tell us there is not a joke now we have to be serious you have to surrender you cannot box with god our hand is too short to walk to god let us get ready and fight the fight god has given us everything that we need for this gospel you there is no excuse for each and everyone here the gospel is real and it's manifesting don't tell me that god is not manifesting right now he is really manifesting right here as we are sitting here right now if you don't see him or you don't see him in your life and if don't think god is not manifesting it's manifesting every day i see it other people say hallelujah glory to god you cannot do anything nothing with your own power you ha you cannot do nothing by your own power until you allow god to break and mold you and to shape you that he shape you that he want only then he can send you out to do the work that he entrusted in your hands you have to allow god to use you we are tools when god needed he can pick up anybody it doesn't matter whether he can speak english you can speak french you can speak anything that's why it's multi what uh multi-dimensional god he's not one god straight that he just he just well god is not like that anywhere it's anywhere we are all god tools he can direct you anywhere that you want so you have to allow god to use you hallelujah what made god great god the creator of heaven and earth became so low that he was wrapped with a swearing cloth if you sit down here and think that or anybody think that oh i'm better than this sister i'm better than this brother you are blocking your place we are all the same there's no difference between one another we have to treat one another equally we are all god human being this thing here we drop it out it doesn't matter whether you are rich or poor let me tell you we are who we are here you know what god said it's a war unto anyone who touched these little ones here who has taken my name my name you are peculiar people sitting down here you are not just a common people sitting down here we are special people god is bragging about you so you don't have to sit down and wait for somebody to tell you this get into your knees when you come to church and the and the the moving the moving of the spirit is going on don't sleep you're gonna miss it you're gonna miss it because as i'm sitting down here i see so many things i'm gonna give you let me tell you if i want to give you a testimony tonight it's gonna be full testimony i haven't it i am in the move of god right now and we all have to get in it so when we come inside the house here this place is on fire hallelujah we want to see god if god manifests himself through our forefathers what about us the fullness of godhead bodily is dwelling in us so there is no excuse hallelujah let us go with anointing god is ready to use us the time has come now the bride has to get up this prayer meeting here that we are we are talking about it's not just a prayer meeting it's a wake-up call for the bride of christ i don't care whatever you are this is the time now the book of art is here god is writing again whom you gotta use you and me hallelujah it's not just one person we all god has called us together what is the message the message is what is the message the message is you because if god give us a message we have to send the message out otherwise you sit it down you disobey god message he said if brother someone gives brother a message to give you to us then he can keep that message he has to bring it out god has given us a message so we have to send the message out to the people hallelujah praise god amen what happened when paul and sarah was in the jail what happened there they begin to pray and singing songs that's why when you come to church and you're singing open your lips open your mouth sing from your lungs if i knew how to if i know if i have a voice my wife cannot sleep i will sing all night to gratify the lord hallelujah but someone said you can't sing what do you do ma mafta or something like that oh when you come here you can clap your hand be happy go one else to be happy that's just that's what god gave it to us he want us to be happy brothers who don't want his wife to be happy everybody wants his wife to help you sometime i lay down my wife said coffee can i have 40 dollars i just go i don't i just grab my wallet and give me 50 i want her to be happy if you ask god you are the bride of christ can god will hold anything for you it's really the people who hold our prayers because we worship our prayers instead of them we live we put god first and give it to them we worship them we cherish them oh i pray but it hasn't happened are you focusing on what is there or are you focusing the promise of god your prayers is a promise god has already promised you god cannot do nothing if he's standing here because it's already done yes don't cherish your your problems don't cherish your pain hallelujah i i i will tell you something about that amen glory to god slide number number uh seven the word became a human bringing a being i think i can really hear better the word became a human being and being sorry the world became a human being and lived among us we saw his glory i was full of grace and truth hallelujah amen why the pharisees pray to recognize him it's because they limited him for what they had been taught by the etherical teachings they failed to recognize the prophet isaiah 9 6. they failed to recognize that scripture the god has a promise we have a promise whatever promise we have the rapture and god has prepared us why are we sitting here by ourselves we are sitting here by grace and the truth that he has revealed to us hallelujah you think everybody knows this message no you are special people that's sitting here tonight you are blessed hallelujah thank you lord in our days right now god and man has become one we always said god and man has become one i tell you a story when we went to jamaica me and brother fred brought a coffee we baptized the brother in the sea we were standing there so we have to pray for the brother before we baptize him i i have the shoe on the socks the brother have his shoes and socks we have only one in the on the right on the on the under on the shore so i said lord i just prayed my heart i said lord we don't want our shoes i don't i i i don't i don't want our our shoes and our sauce to be worked and the wave is coming wave is coming when we were when we were standing there when we stood there before the waves was coming like that so we went inside there for a little while and we lay our hand to our brother could he imagine when we finished praying while we were praying the wait never come our shoes never worked so as you are finished i told brother phil what i asked god and as soon as we did the brother in the water especially with him and i said wow brother phil we see that even the caribbean sea is happy and clapping their hands they are at the hands that the work that god is doing they are part of it let me tell you you see god everywhere if you want to see him let me tell you this message is not a joke it's real people are taking this the way that they are taking it my brother i am in it and i'm going all the way nothing can stop me hallelujah and we are the one god has handled past the baton into our house if the our forefathers did that what about you are you different paul was different let me tell you paul when god paul called paul what happened every time paul got went and preached the gospel he seemed that the following day you never see probably they wanted to kill him but in the night god comes and talks to paul and give him strength i said i love you paul i will send you here do not be afraid for anything god tells you to do don't look at yourself the time is now we are in it we see it i see somebody was sitting the wheelchair get up and walk i saw i saw somebody who couldn't stand up get up and walk we saw somebody who couldn't have a baby and we pray and the baby came and we went around and set up churches so who can tell me god is not the same like yesterday today and forever the same thing you did apostle paul met you on he is doing the same thing today if you don't see him get up get on your knees this is what you are here for pray pray pray hallelujah i saw the cancer be healed i was there he came here and stood here and testified oh that's what i said if i want to change i'm going to give testimony i have all night to give it so you cannot tell me god is not the same yesterday today and forever because what i am in it i am full of it sometime two o'clock i'm sitting down i'm lying down crying i want god to use me all the time not most most of the time by the time i wake up oh what is my mind is god god i want i want your spirit i love you you love me hallelujah i want to see you if the other people saw you what about me oh now robert met brother abraham he asked brother abraham he said the greater than ceremonies is here 1962 asked me abraham but abraham do you think god will listen to my prayer problem testing sure why not god listen to everybody's prayer so why are you sitting down here without praying you don't want god to use you who want god to use it him or her who won just raise up your hand hallelujah i want to see who hallelujah not like this not this mr bean no i want to make sure you are serious mr b day like this i'm not here for that me hallelujah that is you are ready you can be sent for the gospel that god has entrusted our hands this is real hallelujah

hallelujah you are more than your niece your mother your finances hallelujah what abraham said if you broke today you don't get it don't think that god is a prayer let me tell you is we always rock our prayer when daniel prayed and god was bringing the message mark here bringing a message what my what michael told daniel so your prayer strengthen me so prayer is very very important in your life hallelujah people have made talent not your god why your your child your father your mind you are sick oh go get tarano you refuse to wear your hand for your child your husband to pray for him or her or your baby i don't say you don't take care of you but that will be your second thing go to god first and ask her you know my wife and my children the first thing that comes to me said god pray for me hallelujah thank you i just believe and pray but no one let me talk no one time god ever failed me he never failed because he cannot do it the book of john 14 14 what he said say ask in my name and i will do it hallelujah if god will do it why have you stand there i will do it i can pray for anybody it doesn't matter who you are i will come to you hallelujah i see god every day in my life so i am in it we have to be in it hallelujah right now something is happening i believe so thank you jesus amen oh slide number number which number is this slide number 10 we see how many we we see it in how the holy spirit moves holy spirit moves can you when god comes to your life i want to use you can you recognize it i asked everybody can you recognize it if you can't recognize your lack of prayers let me tell you if you don't recognize god god speaking to you or you want to send you somewhere you are lack of prayers because you are not familiar with god hallelujah you got to be familiar with him so that when you speak you understand i don't care how many years we sit here what are 30 40 years 10 years you have to be familiar with god hallelujah so when you speak what is ready to take because as i told you from the beginning we are tools for god so if you are not ready how can you pick you up and use that too you can you gonna sit down there and be rested on your pee on the pew or your bed or your home or your work pray so that you can get familiar with the voice of god god speaking with abraham let me tell you one time i was praying in the midnight and god told me things goes get up do this do this do this everything was 100 100 100 because i feel my ears with his voice when he speak i can hear you have to hear one time i was working he said go to your neighbor something wrong i went there and i fixed what god told me to do if you are not in prayers brethren this is this is not a joke it's free because why i am in it i am in it god is real right now god is doing the same thing in the day of pentecost what happened there he's doing it because i see myself too how can i deny i see it so we have to get into it not just to come here every night could he ever think about since we came to this message here from wynonna to here we're driving all the way to highway how many years 30 to 40 years is there any scratch on us no god put a hedge around you he put a hand around you he protects you i saw by myself while i was driving in the highway with a heavy snow somebody hit my back and i just slide like this from the faster lane i go like this coming down there go across the lane all that traffic heavy traffic coming down nobody hit me until i get off the highway to the uh to the ditch then when i get ahead of ba ba ba about 50 cars let me tell you the god that we serve who can tell me it's not real how god is real hallelujah because when i talk about him because i feel it i know what he did and what he's doing what he's going to do in my life you have to surrender exactly what pointed paul tries to do in his own way he couldn't do it until god came and struck him hallelujah and sent it to ananias said go my my i i ordain somebody here to pray for you you'll be ordained to reach somebody you're not just sitting here god will send people to you but you have to recognize if god can sell 10 paul to an ass to pray for him what about you you know what god brought you here for are you ready for that you have to be ready if you are not ready you cannot do it hallelujah slide number 12. hallelujah amen he does wonders that cannot be understand understood he does so many miracles they cannot be counted when he passes me i can't i can see him and when he goes by me i don't recognize him you see when he pass you when he when he when when he

understanding i'll tell you a story let me tell you i don't care i'm not ashamed of god this god that himself whatever happened to me i would tell because everything happened to us by his purpose when i was going to africa two days for me to go to a plane i was at work i went to the washroom i heard a setting doctor told me eat fish fish is good that when i was eating fish i swallowed a bone and when i saw upon the time to bring it out it caused problem in my back so the thing is stopped there i cannot work pain agony so i ran fast to my doctor and listen my doctor the same week that you have the same the following week is retired so i went there he took the bone out and i said doctor ah you're going for retirement i see the way when i come here something wrong me you so much consent millions of people god has used you to save life so i have nothing to give it to you or what i have is the lord jesus christ i can pray for you he said no no pray for me at home i said no a gift is you have to see the gift before you i can stretch your phone and get it you don't say if somebody send you a gift you don't appreciate it like somebody's giving you a hand you say okay what do you want me to do this is a chinese maybe it's a buddhist or i don't believe nothing he said what do we want to do our city now in pain let me tell you god can send you to somebody through pain so then he

you to give you somebody you cannot use the message to sit down on the pill hallelujah why people people are prayers are sometimes blocked sometimes if they're giving their offering or their tithe their murmuring they are murmuring who gave you the car that you drive who gave you the house that you live in who gave you the crop that you wear who gave you the shoe that you that you wear who gave you the children that you you love so much by you giving offering to god all tight you memory how god gonna bless you how are you gonna see the glory of god bradley this is not a joke this is real

let me go hallelujah hallelujah thank you lord slide 13 because god is multidimensional and i never alone you never know he is in you say i will never leave you nor forsake you it's a promise so why are we sometimes i see christian so sad oh i am sad why you sad you are the happiest me when i'm sad that's whereas man i'm happy you think when i went to the doctor i was in pain but i was so happy that god the sinner have recognized god has sent me there god didn't tell me that i said the sinner has recognized that god has sent me there to to pray for him that's where my happy lies because i perform the work of god yes i perform the work of god hallelujah god can send you everywhere he can lead you everywhere hallelujah you will never alone it's a promise because sometimes we recognize we
