Saints thank you musicians praise God wonderful songs of worship amen we're so grateful for that it creates the atmosphere that will um anoint each and every one of us to receive what we have need of Amen praise God glory to God Amen Let me just make sure everything's plugged in here okay there we go amen we had to get a new computer the um the laptop was giving up the ghost it's been working hard the last uh year over a year here it's been working really hard but it's it was an old laptop and it was giving me some warnings and I said okay you know did it once did it twice I said no not waiting for number three and it'd always be right just before I was coming out all of a sudden the screen would start going crazy and I'd have to reboot it and this and that and I thought okay it's telling me 10 years you've done your time praise God so we thank God for his goodness and his grace amen and I trust that you're all excited about uh the word this morning because I can tell you I am amen I am very excited by the word of God anytime you know and this week uh has been it's been a struggle it's been a struggle to you know to just find you know the direction and and you know so many different areas and just hours and hours and hours and just not feeling you know but then all of a sudden you just keep pressing you keep pressing you keep wrestling with the angel amen and uh all of a sudden you know things start to stir within your heart and then you start to realize okay Lord um this is the direction that you want us to go and so I welcome every one of you but at the same time I want you to know that I've got nothing new everything everything's been revealed the seals are open praise God that's that's that's what's uh so wonderful about this end time ministry and uh you know that's why when brother Branham finished the preaching of the Seven Seals a lot of the people went away from him they didn't realize you know what had actually happened you know and uh uh but um Christ himself had come now to take over and anytime Christ comes on the scene in that way the people scatter there's there's confusion in the midst of the people but everything that uh the Lord wants to reveal um is is uh has been revealed through the opening of the seals and is continuing to unveil itself through the bride and this is why the enemy cannot impersonate amen that's why um we will always have a different message we are not like the rest of the churches we preach from the same scriptures we read the same Bible um you know but yet our mess message is completely different and if you go back and you you know you see everything that that took place after the opening of those seals um there's not a lot of you know you won't see a lot of what is being preached being spoken through the seven Church ages it was all you know uh around the word Around The Messengers um it was about Christ but then they couldn't really recognize the unfolding and the and and the Amor of God coming down into his people and now um the Holy Spirit and the gifts and that which took place on the day of Pentecost made way for himself for Christ himself to come and that's what the opening of the word uh through the ministry of William Branham did it opened those Seven Seals a lot of the people are under confusion about uh you know the Book of Revelation oh it's it's confusing you can't understand it you go back and you read it and you know John must have been on some sort of you know Earthly herbs maybe he was on marijuana or something and you know he was seeing all these different things but they don't realize that it was Christ in type in all aspects in symbol form and it takes the Holy Spirit it takes the spirit of God to come into now the individuals not into a church but the individuals that make up the body of Christ that make up the church and now they've come to realize that something greater is now happening in their midst and and it it'll never be like the the denominational teachings out there it'll be Christ himself again in the midst of his people amen praise God and so he's he's decided to use a five-fold Ministry you know um Jehovah Gyra Jehovah Jehovah the word Jehovah means god becoming it's God becoming so when we say Jehovah Gyra it's God becoming our provider he's constantly unveiling himself in us in our day in the circumstances that we're dealing with when we talk about Jehovah nii it's the Lord who is fighting our battles now and who will fight all of our battles for us you see it's it it's understanding that he's now present and he's he's becoming everything that he needs to become in you in me personally praise God and we need to come to that Revelation personally where we realize it's God in us and then things really start to change so this this this revelation will never stop unveiling itself never stop never stop so uh I'm not going to look for something new I'm just going to allow him to live through amen and that's what we want to do that's what that's why we come into the house of the Lord you got problems you got situations you got circumstances that you're dealing with right now and you want God to meet those needs and you you need a God that's present now amen that's going to speak to your situations now discern your your life now so that you can be set free amen amen am praise God let's go to the word of God who has a request this morning amen praise God father you hear and you see every uplifted heart and every uplifted hand Lord may you come this morning once again Lord and speak to our hearts Lord you're the only one that can bring life to the word of God and do it in such a way that every single need can be met in one service Lord you know we we have many needs but there's things that are that are right now upon our hearts that Lord one day at a time one step at a time one victory at a time lord show us and give us those victories Lord grant it this morning Lord as I yield this vessel to your service Lord May the hearts of your people be open and and willing and may they pull by faith upon your word and meet us in that place that secret place father we pray Lord we commit the service into your hands and we submit and humble ourselves to you in Jesus name amen amen praise God I want to talk this morning on the title give me your heart we're going to see how the holy spirit opens it up it's going to be different to every single one of you um it's it's something that uh you know I was I was you know struggling through and while I'm going through all of that the Lord is dealing with my heart and this is how you know this is how we know that we're dealing with a living God Amen and so let's read the scriptures and let's move along and let's see what the Lord is going to do for us Amen in Proverbs 23: 26 it says my son give me thine heart and let Thine Eyes observe my ways amen you may be seated the Lord wants us to give him our hearts you know this proverb here from Proverbs 23 it's Solomon and I imagine maybe you know if we if we could picture Solomon at this time when he was writing this you know he he may have been talking to some of his his sons you know he had a lot of them there'd be many of them born every day but in it we know that this that that the spirit of God was anointing Solomon was anointing him to write these things and to say these things and so when we read it and we look through the scriptures we know that it's the it's God it's his spirit and it's his voice speaking to us amen and we need to recognize you know what it is that that you know was really in his thoughts and in his mind at that time and when we read our next scripture um in Psalms 24 3-5 it says who shall Ascend into the hill of the Lord or who shall stand in his holy place he that hath Clean Hands and a pure heart who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity nor sworn deceitfully he shall receive reive the blessing from the Lord and righteousness from God from the god of his salvation so it won't be it won't be our righteousness it won't be our uh ability it won't be because we create our own blessings but because we have a pure heart towards God and we've we we've recognized that we've made him our absolute and our heart is where he sits we're going to look at these things as we go through this and we realize that we need his salvation his righteousness not our own ability but it's something that he's that he's willing to give if we're willing to surrender if we're not willing to give up amen praise God and so let me read this quote here brother brandham speaking here and God keeps his word he says our God he's praying now he says we come to thee in the name of thy beloved Son who has bid us to come saying ask the father anything in my name I'll do it so we come in jesus' name to re to First repent of our own sin and our shortcomings and to ask thee to cleanse us from all of our iniquity and to purge our fa thinking that we will think upon the things that are right and pertaining to the kingdom of God and so here the prophet is is praying and he's he's humbling himself and he's saying Lord cleanse us Purge us for what you're about to do for us and I believe that's the desire of every one of you this morning that you've come into the house of the Lord this morning with an expectation but but you you've you've you've cleansed your your your heart you've you've you've settled it with God that Lord I know I've made mistakes I know I'm just human I know I'm failing in a lot of areas but Lord I need you to come and here he says and may our thoughts be tonight on something that would better the kingdom of God and would better the people that are in the kingdom and may our hearts be purged from all foul things we desire to walk upright before thee with CLE Clean Hands and a pure heart but now pay attention here and he says and oh God Alone can do this amen he's the only one that can purify us Purge us cleanse Us by the blood that he's provided for us we need to realize this this is the ultimate uh key for us to come before the Lord boldly when we when we come through the blood accepting what what he has done what he is doing and we pray father to cleanse our hands and purify our hearts wash Us in the waters of separation from the things of the world how by the word amen thank you Jesus no other way it's going to have to be by the word of God Amen and here in Matthew 22 we're just laying in a foundation here for what we're going to move into in Matthew 22: 36-39 they asked the Lord Jesus a question and they said Master which is the great commandment in the law and Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets so what are we hearing here that that he's got to become our absolute amen not only in our hearts but in our soul and in our minds in our minds you see here's the here's the only place in this Dimension as a human being where you're going to have a conscious mind where you're where where it's actually going to be a mind that's against you because it's of this Dimension it's of this world it's it's what picks up all the the the communication and the frequency of this Dimension here your heart and your soul is the attribute of God that is what communicates with God that is what is connected to God that is what God has placed in you in order for you to have a relationship with him without that there is no relationship with God it is only based on what perception and what the world will teach and you'll get caught by all of those things whether it be Buddhism or or or uh different teachings of New Age and and all kinds of different interpretations of what God is and the universe and everything else that's all carnal it's all mind and it's all against God the only thing that's pure is his word and that's why he said thy Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all those aspects Mind Body Soul you need to you need to give yourself wholly and completely unto the Lord otherwise there is no real relationship I'm not talking about being just a church member here this has gone Way Beyond we're way down the road Beyond church membership Saints this is where it's you and God Alone where you've come into a relationship and you're naked before God and you're and you're only accountable to him amen praise God and so uh you know in Matthew 5:8 Jesus himself said blessed are the pure in heart pure in heart you can't mix anything in there you can't mix any man's teachings you can't mix anything it's got to be pure word of God and that's why it'll only be a bride that will receive the pure word a church a bride remember when we say bride we're always talking about the church and it'll it'll only be a pure spotless sinless virgin bride that will be able to have a pure heart and you're saying oh wait a minute here you mean I got to be perfect no you can't be perfect there's absolutely no way you could be perfect God has already provided away for us and that was by him going to the cross and taking all of our sin on him and giving up the spirit the Holy Ghost so that it could come back on us and now the Holy Ghost is what gives us the ability to believe the pure word am without the spirit of Christ the pure unadulterated holy ghost in you you'll never be able to see or receive the pure word we're going to be looking at this a little deeper in the next you know maybe into next week okay but I'm just laying in a foundation right now now notice here in when Jesus is speaking here during um The Sermon on the Mount I want you to notice that he's referencing constantly to the heart of man and he's he's moving his thoughts and all of his his preaching it's preaching Beyond this because they were the Pharisees they were they were under the law everything was based on the law of the word everything was based on the written word and and Jesus here here he comes and now he's he's like speaking and he's doing things that are that are against their law here he is picking corn on the Sabbath day and they're and and they're and they're coming to him and say what are you doing how is it that you're disciples are picking corn on the Sabbath day but Jesus could take the word in such a way that he would take it to another level watch here once the Heart Is Right the spirit is is right then our flesh and our human self comes up comes comes under the leadership of Christ so he says in Matthew 5:21 to 23 says you have heard that it was said by them of old that thou shalt not kill and whosoever shall shall uh kill shall be in danger of the Judgment but I say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in the danger shall be in danger of the judgment and who so whoever shall say to his brother raka shall be in danger of the counsel but whosoever shall say thou fool shall be in danger of Hell Fire therefore if thou bring thy gift to The Altar and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee leave there thy gift before the Altar and go thy way first be reconciled to thy brother and then come and offer thy gift so he was taking it to a level like he's he's saying you don't need to actually murder somebody to be to be brought before the Judgment you just need to hold an evil thought towards your brother or say something against your brother in your own heart and now you come under condemnation to the Judgment you've heard that it was said that of old time Thou shalt not commit adultery but I say unto you that whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart so he's taking it right to another level in other words listen you're not going to you're not going to make it based on your own righteousness you're not going to make it based on your own ability you're not going to make this you're not going to make the Rapture based on on on how how good you are how how well you attend church and how much you pray and and and no it's not going to that's not going to do it amen amen we're going to see how this he's he is the word made flesh now to dwell among his creation he's come here to speak and to deal directly with our heart our soul the attribute that's in us to bring us into our perfect revelation of who we are amen glory to God so here everything was about the law back then based on the works of the hand trying hands trying to live a perfect life but Jesus came looking for perfect Hearts he's here to purge to purify and to and to possess our hearts amen amen he's not looking for perfect lives he's looking for perfect resolution and perfect submission amen fully yielded vessels no one could ever live a perfect life you can't live a perfect life we're all born in sin we're all shaped in iniquity there's a nature that was placed upon us from the original sin back in the Garden of Eden that placed a nature of the Beast a beast nature is actually Upon Our flesh and it's all come down through the generations and that's why Jesus himself when when when when he had to come as a man he could not come through through ordinary you know he couldn't come through a through through a a sex act it had to be the Holy Ghost himself the blood of God it was both egg and Seed of God that he placed in the Virgin Mary and it was her ability her faith to be able to say be it unto me according to Thy word that brought forth the Son of God she had nothing to do with the actual body of Jesus Christ other than she was a carrier her egg had nothing to do with the birth amen when the Holy Ghost came he didn't just inseminate a seed of sperm he inseminated both Hallelujah in his own image thank you Jesus glory to God he he placed he placed his own word seed perfect and that's why when he gave up the ghost he gave up the spirit and the spirit comes now upon a virgin church that believes and says be it unto me according to Thy word she will bring forth the pure unadulterated Jesus Christ again for the rest rure hallelujah praise God and so here now we're going to look at what we originally started with here in the scripture in Proverbs 23 because it's it's in the same chapter and I want I want us to see here how it is that the Lord is dealing with us how he's how he's speaking to us here is Solomon maybe with his sons but here is God now with you and he says for as he thinketh in his heart so is he a lot of people you know they take this you know um this thought and they and they and they they take it and and and they apply it like the New Age movement does that you know what you think about all day long that's what you become no that's not it that's not what it is yes your thoughts do influence this but this ain't going to inherit the kingdom of God this is not what God came for we're way down the road Saints we're not looking for for for these bodies to be changed you know these these flesh bodies we're looking for the new body amen the one that's already been placed in us as an attribute of God right there in our hearts amen and so you know let's let's uh I'm I'm just going to read Proverbs 23 and just comment on it as we lead into this I'm going to start from verse one now here he is and he says when thou sest to eat with a ruler consider diligently what is before thee now he's just taking a circumstance here he's talking to his sons look at it that way just let's let's see it that way and he's talking to them about life because he's a he's a great king he's a great ruler he rules over a great Kingdom and he's the richest man on earth right now but one thing God gave him was was incredible wisdom and we can draw from that wisdom and we want to see how this scripture pertains here he says you know and put a knife to thy throat consider diligently what is before thee and put a knife to thy throat if thou be a man given to appetite be not desirous of his dainties for they are deceitful meat he's saying listen don't be so carnal that you're going after all the things of the flesh oh this is a nice dinner oh look at those beautiful wine glasses and oh my goodness there's more glasses here than one glass for each sip you know and all kind and you you get you get mesmerized and and God is telling us that this world we've come into a time in a season where where the world is so rich in need of nothing there's Wealth Beyond you know ridiculous amounts of wealth single individuals that are that are worth billions and and and hundreds of billions of dollars and you can imagine the the you know the in need of nothing even even you know like I mean okay we live in America and we see it even more but even the poor they can stand on the corners and people hand them money people just hand them money and they do it now as a job that's why you'll see them on all the corners because because they're getting money and some of them are going home with three 400 bucks a day you know it's just because the poor are going to be with us always and so we're living in a time where where where things are available but he says but labor not to be rich cease from thine own wisdom wil thou set thine eyes upon that which is not for riches certainly may may make themselves Wings they fly away as an eagle towards heaven eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye you know when you're working work work with Integrity do and and work with the Integrity of God in your heart he's telling you these are simple ways of us living but this is all come into something so pay attention he says uh eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye neither desire thou his dainty Meats for as he thinketh in his heart so is he you see how now see see how the scripture all of a sudden it's got a a different understanding here and other words what's in that person's heart unless the holy Spirit replaces it with an attribute unless the spirit of God comes in by a new birth into that individual and there and that heart now is filled with the sole attribute of God he's headed for Destruction because without Christ there is no salvation without God there is no salvation he you got to bring the whole thought into the context so is he he says eat and then he goes on he says eat and drink saith he to thee but his heart is not with thee there's a lot of pleasures of this life and there's a lot of things and teachings in this life but Satan's Satan's motive in all these new age teachings and even applying and taking the word of God in the way that he has here is to dece the people and make them feel like they're semi-religious see as a man thinks in his heart so is he so I can think on all the the wealth and all the pleasures I'm going to imagine myself in that yacht until it materializes before me and all Solomon said about all of that was vanity of vanities because this world is not going to get better it's right now in a massive nose dive towards tribulation and this is the only message that will bring Salvation the only message not the message that Danny misil is bringing or what the the churches are are bringing the message is Christ himself who is saying to you come unto me and I will give you rest amen he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that heareth my words hath eternal life in them if they can receive it this is a word test we're we're living in the last age of the greatest word test that is ever going to be placed upon the church and when we're talking about the word test we're not talking about denominational Church is out there like I said we are way down the road from that this is where this message this church this end time message that we are following is now going to get tested beyond what you ever could have imagined you think you're going through trials oh I got a terrible trial I got to come up with $500 next month yeah that might look like a terrible trial but let me tell you that is not really the true test that you're going to face the one that you're going to be facing that is going to that's that's going to be staring you right in the face will be the test of whether you can you can take this word and stand on this word and allow it to have absolute control over your life Oh Glory we're going to move along here there's been a growing belief within Christianity that started with the power of positive thinking from this very scripture here movements that what a person repeatedly thinks about and how they think about it will determine uh what they're becoming I'm saying to you you can maybe affect this flesh with this with this positive mental aspect and and it is good and I always preach you need to have a positive outlook as Christians especially those that are revelated by the word of God in this hour we should be the happiest people we should be able to be positive in in bringing forth a positive gospel but this this thinking of how the world is is actually quoting it and they're saying that it's actually a neuroscientific proven fact that you can change the molecules by visualizing and by doing all those things the only molecular change I'm looking for is the body change that the word of God is going to produce because any other one is going to put anybody else into a dimension that they're not going to want to be in amen I can assure you that Jesus or the word didn't pertain it in that way how it actually really is interpreted is for as he thinketh in his heart meaning that if he's an attribute of God and in his heart is the word of God and that word was placed there from before the foundations of the world you can never not believe disbelieve the word you're an attribute of God from before the foundations of the world you were ordained to eternal life before you came into this temporal life Hallelujah that's the person that you really are yes as I think in my heart I am according to the word of God glory to God Amen and so here it's not so much dealing with this human life when it comes to the spiritual things it's about eternal life this is what we're dealing with and the and the true you is who you were before you came to this Dimension that's right that's the real you your soul your attribute your part of God Amen so as we move along here we go down to Proverbs 23 uh verse 23 to 26 and watch what he says here he says by the truth he says by the truth by buy it you know like whatever you can do purchase it if you you know he's saying if if if it's possible and sell it not you know he's just using a thing also wisdom and instruction and understanding the father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice and he that Beth a wise child shall have joy of him thy father and thy mother shall be glad and she that bear thee shall rejoice my son and here's where he says my son give me thine heart that's what will please the Lord that's what will will will will bring joy that's why when when we were talking about you know a a a merry heart is good medicine and a broken Spirit dth up the bones because we know that God's God's strength is in his joy for us when God is rejoicing over us he just pours in strength he just pours in blessing he just pours in all that we have need of all of a sudden here in this life we're we're getting Victory after Victory listen you're a son and daughter of God there's nothing that could ever change that if you're a Son of God there's nothing that could ever change it you you you you can't be lost but you can live a miserable life you can choose how you want to serve the Lord you can decide how you want to waste away in this life because the revelation of who you are that can never be removed the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it but it's up to you to apply the word of God to believe God's word to believe all the things that that he says and let Thine Eyes observe my ways he says here in verse 23 give me your heart and let Thine Eyes observe my ways listen without the Lord our ways will go astray and Away amen it's as simple as that and that's why he's come to search our hearts to see who you really are amen praise God let's go to the next scripture here in Jeremiah because we're we're going to search our hearts this morning is that okay amen we're going to we're going to do like you know the heart of a deceit uh the heart is deceitful remember that you know when when we're talking about the human heart here and we're talking about human mental memories and and and things that that that we've experienced from our from our human uh experience here on Earth and the bad memories and the bad experiences and all those things all those things they they they can deceive us and desperate and it's desperately wicked who can know it I the Lord search the heart I can go deep into your heart and I can try the Reigns I canest you even to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings only God he's the only one that deals in our lives as Sons and Daughters of God and he knows exactly where you're at he knows where your thinking is he knows what you're you're focused on you know there's there's a saying that says that where your treasure is that's where your heart is we need to check where our thoughts are continually in this life what is our mind constantly on money money money beauty beauty beauty I got to look younger I got to make myself feel younger I got to look younger is that where our thoughts are because where your treasure is that's where your heart's going to be but God says give me your heart that's why Solomon said here don't don't be don't be getting too focused on all these things and all the things of this world because they're all going to fade away and they are fading away they're fading away right before our very eyes the people don't know it they think all these riches and all these things and the stock markets being so high and and and real estate prices being so high and all of these things and they're thinking that the world's just going to go on and it's just going to keep getting better and better and better I can show you in the scripture that there would be a time like we said that the world would be so rich and in need of nothing but he says come unto me come unto me and buy my wisdom and my my faith give yourself in other words buying means surrendering giving up you're giving up something God's not going to want your money God wants your spirit God wants your your will God wants your desires to be for him and not the things of the world Amen and so the word heart here in Jeremiah is talking about in Hebrew it's it's the word Leb which is considered the center of everything it's where everything happens in your life it's where you're you you don't realize it but it's you know like just take a person and let them be brokenhearted from A Love Affair and their whole world can collapse around them they'll want to commit suicide sometimes oh he left me she left me I can't live without them and right away their whole world collapses around them because it's the focal point it's the center of everything including thoughts it's used figuratively often for human feelings the will and even the intellect but listen here brother brandom's speaking here in Revelation 1961 chapter 2 he says but the nature of this man's spirit is evil now he's talking about different Natures here and the nature of this man's spirit is good he's talking about two individuals so see the nature of the spirit is the soul of the man so the nature is the soul of the individual so now God is trying to get into that into what the spirit and heart of man that's where God wants to Reign that's his throne in our lives not talking about the physical heart here I hope you you're you're you're you're you're you're you're moving in the in the spirit realm right now because our hearts these physical hearts are not not what what what he's talking about here he's talking about the actual person the attribute that you are the real person that you are he says the spirit and heart of man where the spirit lays in the heart now physically yes they've proven that there is a space in your heart and that's where life emanates and so there is an attribute of God that's in you and around you at all times and so he says here you know and science as I never finished that that man couldn't think with his heart and science to begin to find out that there's a little compartment there it is in the human heart not in animal heart but in the human heart there's not even a blood cell nor nothing they said it must be the place where the Soul occupies or the spirit just just let them alone they'll take their own silly things and prove God that's right God just makes the foolish testify of him now there it is Big headlines in the paper brother Bose's little girl said brother brandom you know what you was saying the other day said look look science has already found out said well bless God I want that sister I want I want that the soul of man is the nature of the spirit and the spirit dwells in the heart of man there's something in us there's life within us and when we give up the life when we give up the the the the life here on this Dimension that that life it moves on to another body amen and he goes on to say here and he says and then when this little angel comes into the body now pay attention that's a little angel of the earth a spirit that's ordained of God to take this body then that baby has to have a choice it makes its decision then when this takes place then you see the angel of the Lord now comes in here which is a spiritual body that Eternal so he's talking about how the attribute of God comes into us when we come into this Dimension here this is a dying spirit in a dying body but now you can't be in two bodies at one time but there can be two Natures in you at one time and that's why there's a struggle and that's why brother Braham said the greatest battle that you're going to fight is going to be right between your ears and it's constantly looking to possess your heart to try and reign in your heart to try and become the the the absolute in your heart so he says here he says now the nature of the spirit of the Lord when you're born again you're not born a physical but the baby was but what happened the spiritual Birth has come to you and while this spiritual birth is growing into your heart of God this spirit of God that God places into your heart as it grows and and and develops by the revelation of the word to come to know God and to to to to believe the word and make it the absolute in your life okay of God there is a physical or Celestial body growing to receive that spirit and when the life leaves this body it goes to that body just as when the body is presented to the Earth the spirit comes in when the spirit goes out of the body there is a body waiting so if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved there's another one that's waiting on this one amen praise God for we know that after this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting and so let's go to the next scripture here in Matthew 13 or sorry in Matthew Matthew no it's not here actually wait I got it here so we need to understand that that from our heart predes what's really in you who you really are is what you're going to express by their fruits you're going to know them by the way you communicate by the way you live by the way you express yourself people are going to know whether you are a True Believer or not he says but those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart and they defile the man for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts murders adulteries fornications theft false witness blasphemies these are things which defile a man so if there's a corrupt heart in there those are the things that it's going to communicate those are the communications those are the things that it's going to lust after and desire after but in Mark 11 it says for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto to this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in the heart have no doubt whatsoever but Shall Believe those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith and in Matthew 13: 19 when anyone heareth the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not then cometh the wicked one and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart so without Revelation you can't live this word you can't manifest God you can't be represented in the body of Christ that's going to take the Rapture because you need the heart of God you need you need the Revelation to believe the word of God you've got to be like the Virgin Mary that can say be it unto me according to to Thy word and everything comes subject to that so A word without revelation will never stand against the enemy never in Proverbs 18:12 it says Before Destruction the heart of man is Hottie and before honor is humility you're not going to do it on your own God is looking at the heart and God is looking at the humility that is being being produced from your heart we're still laying in a foundation here listen here about those those those two Natures that are in Us in the questions and answers uh brother brandham was asked about these natures and he says and isn't that just the way the people get today let God just bless a fellow and put a little confidence in him and he gets to be a know it all God wants to bless God wants to prosper God wants to give us a a perfect heart but we can't allow it to take control and to make us hoty and high-minded he's got to start an organization or he's got to do something that's different why art thou fallen from Heaven old Lucifer God has a hard time trying to get to somebody that he can deal with that'll stay humble and meek and stay in the place until God calls him to do something you believe that a man that God can bless and he'll still keep himself a man not be an angel or a God as soon as a man gets blessed and has a little something given to him he wants to become a God he wants to become an angel he wants to become some great person what I do what me and me and mine all that that's the wrong attitude God's hunting for somebody who he can bless and pour out the blessings and more he blessed the little the the little the man will become and you'll never get more of God until you become nothing you've got to belittle yourself he that will exalt himself God will bring a base he that will humble himself God will exalt you've got to get little before you can get big amen and you'll never get be bigger in your own self you'll only be as big as God will be be big in you Hallelujah you can never be more than what God wants you to be God wants your heart he doesn't want your pride he doesn't want you to come with all your abilities God places gifts in the individuals and God will use those gifts when he needs to use those gifts we got to be ready to allow him to use us in whatever aspect in whatever way he wants to use us we just got to be willing to surrender unto him amen you'll you'll you will be an expression of the word if you are a gene of God from before the foundations of the world you'll be exactly what he made you to be and he wants you to Just Surrender yourself to be that listen we make mistakes everybody makes mistakes but we got to have the right kind of heart God's looking you know he's dealing with our heart right now when it comes to humility and pride and and and and you know you know we can draw a great example from Psalms 51 where David you know he had just been you know Nathan the prophet comes in unto him after he had gone to and taken Beth Sheba committed adultery killed her husband and and and done things that were complete Abomination to God Nathan comes in and tells him what he's done but I want you to notice David if you compare you know like we don't got time to go into the full comparisons between Saul and David but we're talking about two different Hearts Saul he gets caught disobeying God and he's putting every excuse he can blaming the people PA was saying but you know the Samuel comes in and says Saul did I not tell you to take take out every everything man woman child of that Village that had to be destroyed because they were all wicked and evil right down to the very animals and he turns around and says oh yeah but you know what the the the some of the uh generals they took some of the you know the the the better-looking uh uh cows and and calfs because you know they're going to use them as sacrifices unto the Lord they were perfect no God said everything when you're gonna kick a demon out of your home or out of your village or out of your life you got to take its head off amen and every one of its little children that come with it that'll keep coming around and pulling on your leg and saying oh please please come back no out get rid of every single one and Saul he was rebellious he had a rebellious heart he couldn't what was it he wasn't able to submit and Obey and even come to a place where he could repent properly he says oh I've sin before the Lord can you just you know make a sacrifice and and and get me you know CU you know he would say I don't want to be shamed before the people so you need to like you know do a sacrifice for me and and and restore me back you know before the people so that you can stand next to me he had a rebellious Spirit but look at how David responded and we need to we need to learn something from this because like I said there's none of you that's perfect we're going to make mistakes we're going to do things that we're going to that we're going to be disappointed and and you know the enemy is going to try and come and he's going to try and and pound you with condemnation and all those things but there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ they've come into the word they've accepted the word of the Lord for their day yes and listen what he says here have mercy on me in in verse uh one of of uh Psalms 51 have mercy upon me oh God according to thy loving kindness according unto the multitude of thy Tender Mercies blot out my transgression he's asking for for for his transgressions to be blotted out Wash Me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin for I acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me listen what he says against thee and thee only have I sinned you see he got to a place where he knew that he was naked before God and unless we come to that relationship with God you can hide things from your brothers and your sisters you can say things and you can you can put a little twist to them to make it sound like this or make it sound like that but God he's he's hearing you and he's reading your heart he's he's testing your heart he's searching your heart he's looking deep within and and here David he was he was able to to stand and say only against thee have I sinned and done this evil in thy sight that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judgest in other words Lord I deserve whatever you're going to give me every single one of you deserve to be to be to to to to receive the punishment that comes from unbelief everybody out there the Bible says a man sins a man's going to die it's as simple as that but blessed be the name of the Lord that he's offered us this this redeeming blood he's saying hey hey come here give me your heart he says if you give me your heart and you surrender yourself completely unto me you'll be as white as snow as though you never done it in the first place he says I'll take your sin and I'll place it into the sea of my forgetfulness never to bring it up no more amen hallelujah this is the god that we want to serve this is what the world is missing out there they don't realize this message is the message of Salvation it's the only message of salvation amen amen glory to God he goes he goes on and he says behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me now his mother never did anything wrong what was it that his mother did that was so wrong because he he had a revelation yes of what took back took place back in the Garden of Eden that's right because it was Eve that sinned and it was Eve that went to be with with with the with the serpent right because she wanted to bring forth children yeah he convinced her hey you can be like God you can be a Creator like God and we can do it this way God knew exactly what was going to happen but here David had a revelation that he was conceived in sin and you and I were all born in sin so don't be thinking oh I did this wrong I did that wrong no all sin was taken to the cross with Jesus Christ all sin and you can be restored you can be you you can be uh Justified as though you've never done it in the first place and walk with God and have a Victorious life amen behold thou desirest truth in the inward parts and in the part Thou shalt make me to know wisdom Purge me with hisab and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be whiter than snow make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou has broken May Rejoice hide thy face from my sins and blot out all mine iniquities and then he goes create in me a clean heart take all that pain take away all that shame take away all that guilt that's what he can do for you create in me a clean heart and restore renew a right Spirit Within Me cast me not away from thy presence and let not thy Holy Spirit leave me Hallelujah huah Psalms 139 next search me oh God and know my heart try me and know my thoughts and see if there be any wicked way in me and Lead Me in the way of everlasting is that your desire this morning you want to really walk with God you have a desire to truly walk with God what an hour Saints this is going to be the most deceiving hour go to the next scripture notice here from this people's heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear you know that there's people that that that that have that have allowed their their their hearts to wax gross in other words they've heard so much about the gospel they've heard so much about Jesus Christ they've heard it from this denominational perspective they've heard it from that denominational perspective they've heard it from New Age teaching they've heard it through Buddha they've heard about this they've heard about that that they've gotten to a place where the people's hearts have waxed gross in other words they just don't even want to bother anymore that's a dangerous condition to get into it's a very dangerous place that when you get you've heard all the quotes you've heard so many of the quotes you've heard so much of the message you've heard this this teaching you've heard about that teaching you've heard about Brandon you know branhamites you've heard about the seven Thunder Doctrine you've heard that the seals are not open you've heard the seals are open that you've gotten to a place where all you do is you're just a church member as long as I belong to a message church that's going to be good enough and that's going to get me in the Rapture be careful that you don't get so complacent that your heart becomes waxed over that when the Holy Spirit now in the present stage of his ministry where he is speaking through a five-fold Ministry where he wants to speak directly to the hearts of the people and bring them out of all of the confusion because there's two spirits that are operating in the church at all times brother Bram says every Revival brings forth two Spirits the true and the false Vine amen and it's still operating and it will still continue to operate and it'll move move into this message and has already moved into this message and it's causing a lot of Confusion And A lot of people are just falling away because their hearts have grossed have waxed gross they've hardened themselves against the message and the word they're hooking up with those that are denying the cloud now well I don't know you know like did it really happen you see if if the heart is the Lord's heart and in there is the attribute of God it's already been given to the Lord there's nothing that can turn you away from this there's nothing that can change you and and and and and move you away from what God has revealed to you the Gates of Hell will not Prevail and you will you'll be sensitive to the spirit you'll be listening for the word you won't be caught into the confusion you won't be Dr away they're arguing with one another there's there's literal online online you know sword fights going on between people One Believes this in the message one believes that in the message there's confusion but that's the job of the enemy to bring confusion stay away from all of it you might have one little thing you wanted the Lord inspires you to make one statement or say one thing it'll if it's the Lord otherwise just leave it alone Hallelujah we don't want to be religious religious is is is uh uh you know a counterfeit Spirit that's what you know religion is a covering that's what religion is people are taking this message and they're making their own coverings they've got their own filters now that they filter everything through well if you don't say it exactly the way the prophet said it you're wrong never mind if you got a revelation of what the prophet said no we're not interested in your own interpretation they'll say that's your interpretation you'll know if it's you know if if if if you're an attribute of God you can't be deceived Amen period and you'll just know when you hear you'll know whether it's truth or error unless you get into a hardened condition you can be a son or a daughter of God that gets into a Harden condition where you just you pull back you don't want to serve God the way that you used to serve God you you're not willing to give your you're all you're not willing to fully surrender everything completely to him and you can get into a state Like an Eagle when it gets into a state you know where all of a sudden it's got to it's going to be smashing his head against the ground because it's gotten all crusted over because it it's allowed the trials of this life and and the snares of the enemy and all the the battles and all the mind battles to to to to put a cloud around your life get out of it come out of that condition and let the Holy Spirit move into your life amen glory to God listen in a thinking's man a thinking man's filter I believe it's up there you can put it up notice that word cannot deny itself if the word is in you it will it it'll just amen the word of God period it can never go against the word so that'll be one way if somebody says to you hey you know because remember if you get into that Harden condition like Jesus was talking about that they don't even want to hear that's what he meant by that they'll hear it but they'll just I don't want to hear it oh you're too religious they'll see the evidence of Miracles even and they'll say ah that was just you know they got lucky what do you want I hear people you know they get cancer and then they get they go to the doctor and they don't got it anymore and they're not even going to church it's true it's true but it's not about healing cancer it's not about healing the cancer it's about it's about your soul it's about whether you've got identification with Jesus Christ the word whether you can surrender yourself to the word of God and and and not allow the word to to to uh you know get you in a in in a in a mean mad condition where you're going to walk away that is he goes on here he says then it is satisfied or it's the desire it's a desire of what what made you desire it in the first place he's talking about the word what made you desire the word in the first place what what is it that Drew you to this Revelation in the first place that brought you into this ministry amen because down in your soul there was a predestinated seed which was eternal life always laying in there always was in there all that the father hath given me will come there isn't any of them that's going to be lost a thinking man's taste when a thinking man hears the word of God my sheep hear my voice a stranger they will not follow for down in there is life and life connects with life sin connects with sin and sin is so hypocritical until it thinks that it's saved when it isn't saved it's in the very depths of hypocrisy church members want a denominational filter so that they can have their own desire and still be classed religious people you hear them say oh he's very religious don't look at this as the denominations out there look at it as it right within the message here now people with religious Spirits I got a lot here now this is where it's starting to get really good but I'm looking at my time here and there's just no way that we're going to be able to get to to to go into all of this but we're going to be looking at Jacob and Esau within the confines of Papa's Church Isaac one born the Lord says I love Jacob let the musicians come and the other one says Jacob I love but the other one I hate oh we're going to look at all of that next week we're going to go a little deeper into our hearts we're going to see where we stand where we are right now in the midst of the message of this hour where people are Falling Away people are going to walk away from this message and it is the only message that brings life it's the only one that really truly is going to translate us out are you going to be able to stand right to the very end that'll be the test that'll be the greatest test oh I'm so glad I'm so glad that I've heard the word of the Lord Brother Mike aren't you happy give me a key
