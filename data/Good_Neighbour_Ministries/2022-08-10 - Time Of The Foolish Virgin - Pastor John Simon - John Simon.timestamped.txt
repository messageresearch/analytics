[30:23] so
[30:30] [Music]
[30:55] uh we'll read from matthew chapter 25
[31:02] uh reading from verses 1
[31:07] to 13.
[31:16] it's up on the screen so
[31:19] we can read it from there if we want to
[31:23] uh let us read
[31:26] together
[31:28] then shall the kingdom of heaven
[31:31] be lightened unto
[31:34] ten virgins
[31:36] which took their lamps and went forth to
[31:40] meet the bridegroom
[31:42] and five of them were wise
[31:47] and
[31:48] five
[31:49] were foolish
[31:52] they that were wise took their lamps
[31:57] that
[31:58] were they that were foolish sorry
[32:02] took their lamps
[32:04] and took no oil with them
[32:07] but the wise
[32:09] took oil in their vessels
[32:11] with their lamps
[32:13] while the bright groom carried or
[32:16] delayed
[32:17] they all slumbered and slept i wanted to
[32:21] notice it wasn't just the unwise virgins
[32:24] that slept
[32:26] all of them slumbered and slept
[32:29] every one of them even a true believer
[32:32] slumbered and slept
[32:34] never coming to
[32:36] the
[32:37] uh full understanding of what was really
[32:40] happening
[32:42] now
[32:44] and at midnight
[32:47] there was a cry made
[32:50] behold the bridegroom comet goyi out to
[32:54] meet him
[32:55] then all those virgins arose and trim
[32:59] their lamps
[33:00] and the foolish said unto the wise
[33:03] give us of your oil
[33:06] for our lamps are gone out
[33:10] but the wise answered saying not so
[33:13] lest there be not enough for us and you
[33:19] but go ye rather to them that sell
[33:22] and buy for yourselves
[33:26] and while they went to buy
[33:28] the bridegroom came
[33:30] and they that were ready
[33:32] went in with him to the marriage
[33:35] and the door
[33:36] was shut
[33:40] afterward came also the other virgin
[33:44] saying
[33:45] lord lord open to us
[33:48] but he answered and said
[33:50] verily i say unto you
[33:52] i
[33:53] know you not
[33:56] watch therefore
[33:58] for you know
[34:00] neither the day nor the hour wherein
[34:04] the son of man commit
[34:07] amen
[34:09] our gracious
[34:11] and eternal father
[34:14] we ask that your spirit will draw near
[34:18] grant us your divine presence
[34:21] just as you spoke with adam and eve in
[34:24] the garden
[34:25] may the great holy spirit come on the
[34:29] scene father
[34:31] speak to us once again lord
[34:34] in the cool of the day
[34:36] our hearts are open
[34:38] our hearts are willing our ears want to
[34:41] hear you father
[34:43] and may you receive all the praise the
[34:45] honor and the glory
[34:46] in jesus name amen praise god god bless
[34:50] you please be seated
[34:53] glory to god
[34:55] amen
[34:56] now um
[34:58] if you have a garden
[35:00] and then you know
[35:02] that whatever seeds you plant in that
[35:04] garden that's what's going to come up
[35:07] uh you can't plant limes
[35:11] and expect you're going to have apples
[35:13] and
[35:13] oranges and and sweet grapes you're not
[35:17] going to have it because every seed the
[35:20] law of god said it from the beginning
[35:22] every seed must bring forth after its
[35:26] kind
[35:28] it has got to reproduce itself
[35:32] and this is what god said whatever you
[35:35] planted
[35:36] therefore we know that when we plant
[35:39] seeds and the rain falls on the seed
[35:44] the rain
[35:46] doesn't make the seed get born again
[35:51] the rain doesn't uh
[35:54] cause the seed to change
[35:56] its origin
[35:59] the rain only brings out
[36:02] what was planted in that garden
[36:06] and god spoke until told us true the
[36:09] prophet for the spirit spoke and speaks
[36:11] through the prophet
[36:14] the spirit of god let us know that
[36:17] we are not just here now at this time
[36:22] for no reason at all
[36:24] but in future home but you are not
[36:28] creatures of time
[36:30] you come from eternity
[36:32] you're going back to eternity
[36:34] you come from the presence of almighty
[36:36] god and you're going back into the
[36:39] presence of god
[36:40] because you were in him before the
[36:43] foundation of the world you are in him
[36:46] as the original thoughts of god those
[36:49] thoughts were then spoken the spoken
[36:51] word became flesh amen it was manifest
[36:55] in one man whose name was jesus christ
[36:59] but now it's filtered down to this day
[37:02] where that word which was a one man body
[37:06] that god was in has now become a many
[37:10] member body called the bride
[37:14] this is what jesus spoke about why he
[37:16] said it is important that i have got to
[37:20] die
[37:21] for the corn of wheat must go into the
[37:24] ground
[37:25] so that it might come up
[37:27] and become up and bear fruit a thousand
[37:30] fold multiply and reproduce itself amen
[37:34] and so we are living in that day where
[37:37] we are the fulfillment of that prophecy
[37:40] the word of god coming back up again
[37:44] but listen that word when it was
[37:46] manifest was in the flesh of a man named
[37:50] jesus christ but now that word has come
[37:53] back in your flesh
[37:55] by the holy spirit of the living god and
[37:58] again it is without form of comeliness
[38:04] it's so simple
[38:07] they had no desire to even see him
[38:11] they
[38:11] they didn't think anything of him and
[38:14] you know the mocking and the scoffing oh
[38:16] we know who you are you are joseph and
[38:18] mary's son we know you used to play with
[38:20] our boy down the street
[38:23] but they don't realize
[38:25] the man on the outside didn't change
[38:29] but the man on the inside was a
[38:32] predestinated seed that come from the
[38:35] presence of almighty god
[38:38] but now the time has come or came for
[38:42] those seeds to be made manifest
[38:45] and just as the rain falls and on the
[38:49] just and when you unjust
[38:51] amen whether it's a weed or a wheat the
[38:54] rain is going to bring it up because the
[38:56] rain doesn't make or change the seed it
[38:59] just germinates it it just brings it to
[39:02] life to show its real qualities and its
[39:06] essence that's in it even so we come if
[39:10] we are true believers with the charm of
[39:13] god within us
[39:15] then the spirit of the living god will
[39:19] fall on that german gene
[39:22] whatever you want attribute it will fall
[39:25] on it
[39:26] to bring it to a manifestation
[39:29] hallelujah so that it could reveal its
[39:32] character it's to reveal its kind
[39:37] for every seed will bring forth after
[39:40] its kind
[39:41] and if it's a word kind then it will
[39:44] love the word be the word not by works
[39:49] when a baby is born it doesn't have to
[39:51] work to be a human
[39:53] it's just born a human and when you are
[39:57] a seed of god
[39:59] you don't have to cultivate
[40:02] you don't have to acculturate you don't
[40:04] have to go and educate you don't have to
[40:07] get into the bible school in the bible
[40:10] college for them to lock you into a
[40:13] religious
[40:14] mindset or system of thoughts but to
[40:17] remain in the fullness of the word
[40:21] where your mind your heart your soul is
[40:24] free to soar like an eagle and to
[40:27] receive the revelation that comes from
[40:30] the word of god amen hallelujah amen
[40:34] every seed will bring forth to harvest
[40:38] natural rain and the natural seeds are
[40:41] harvest
[40:42] the holy grass falls on the seeds of
[40:45] this hour and it will bring forth a
[40:48] spiritual
[40:49] harvest to the glory of god amen
[40:54] praise god and i'm glad we are living
[40:56] now in the harvest time do you believe
[40:59] that
[41:00] we are living in the harvest time
[41:02] because god used a prophet hallelujah to
[41:06] plant the seeds for this hour praise god
[41:10] oh my
[41:11] i'm talking about the spoken word amen
[41:14] that spoken word called out to the
[41:18] planted the already planted word that
[41:21] was in the heart of the true believer
[41:24] and when the deep called to this deep
[41:27] that was in here it has to respond
[41:31] because nobody has educated about that
[41:34] tell it anything about that it's going
[41:35] to no
[41:37] he said well how are you going to know i
[41:38] can't explain that
[41:40] hey man just like when i met my wife i i
[41:43] didn't have to have anybody explain to
[41:45] me
[41:46] you know any detail or any great
[41:48] calculus
[41:50] to know that uh something in here
[41:52] testified to me that that's right
[41:55] hallelujah it's the same way when you
[41:58] come in contact with the word of god the
[42:00] same holy spirit testifies to this
[42:04] spirit inside the soul the gene that
[42:08] german tells it that's right amen
[42:11] praise be to god hallelujah amen
[42:15] so quoting from brother branham now
[42:18] so then we see
[42:20] that when the spirit falls
[42:23] it will bring forth a harvest of that
[42:28] seed that was planted that it falls on
[42:32] whatever seed you planted when it falls
[42:34] and that is going to make it live is
[42:36] that right that's what he's saying
[42:38] therefore
[42:39] i predict
[42:41] that the two denominational groups
[42:45] pentecostal
[42:47] and
[42:48] evangelical groups
[42:50] will work together
[42:52] in a denomination
[42:55] they will unite themselves together
[42:59] and it will become a member of the
[43:04] world council of churches
[43:07] the federation of the council of
[43:10] churches now remember
[43:12] they already belong to it
[43:14] all of them
[43:16] he means individually he didn't say that
[43:18] but that's what he's talking about but
[43:20] they're gonna openly now come as an
[43:22] organization
[43:24] and they will belong to it
[43:28] all of them will be long see
[43:32] and there will come through them
[43:36] a force
[43:37] or a boycott
[43:39] see
[43:40] and will stop everything
[43:43] but
[43:44] whatsoever belongs to that union of
[43:47] churches right they will stop everything
[43:50] else except if you belong to that union
[43:53] of churches now now we know
[43:57] that the bible said there would be a
[44:00] boycott it even said it would cause
[44:03] people not to be able to buy
[44:06] not to be able to sell
[44:08] unless they had received this mark of
[44:12] the beast
[44:14] right now
[44:15] of course we know that is
[44:18] denominationalism as a whole right
[44:21] he says here romanism but romanism is
[44:24] the mother of all denominationalism so i
[44:26] know what he's saying that that's the
[44:28] mark of the beast
[44:30] now we hear this mark and the devil is
[44:33] so cunning he gives a human beings ideas
[44:36] that these marks are some literal letter
[44:38] or a number or a mark on a wall or
[44:41] something like that and a mark is really
[44:44] a spirit
[44:46] you have that spirit
[44:48] in you
[44:49] it operates through you it motivates you
[44:52] causes you act in a certain manner that
[44:55] you don't have to think to act that way
[44:57] hey man but i'm glad i have another mark
[45:00] uh i am marked you are mark if you're a
[45:03] true believer marked by the holy spirit
[45:06] the holy spirit acting and moving in the
[45:09] believer mocks that believer amen in
[45:12] other words it causes people to see
[45:14] something different they don't know what
[45:16] it is amen and you can't fully explain
[45:19] to them what it is because if you say
[45:21] it's the holy spirit they're going to
[45:22] say oh yeah
[45:24] so
[45:27] oh
[45:29] oh my
[45:30] isn't that the way it is always that way
[45:33] they try to make fun of the great holy
[45:36] spirit of the living god
[45:38] now so
[45:39] and then
[45:41] we see the image of the beast after that
[45:45] which is really protestantism
[45:49] mark of the beast
[45:50] image of the beast which is
[45:54] protestantism amen praise god well you
[45:57] run understand that uh
[46:00] the image of the beast god made man in
[46:04] his own image
[46:06] so when you say image of the beast
[46:09] we're talking now about satan trying to
[46:12] copy god and he creates a
[46:16] not a bride formed shaped and purposed
[46:20] by revelation
[46:22] but one that he organized
[46:25] as a system a denomination
[46:28] to create a religious body
[46:31] for him to dwell in speak through and
[46:34] act true but god created people that
[46:38] would be on the earth in a specific age
[46:40] at a specific time to hear a specific
[46:43] message recognize that message be
[46:46] changed by the power of god be able to
[46:48] manifest the holy spirit in their lives
[46:51] and they become what
[46:54] the image of god
[46:57] the body of jesus christ
[46:59] made manifested praise the name of the
[47:02] lord hallelujah yes now we see then
[47:07] that beast
[47:09] that beast the one with the mark you see
[47:12] has the power and the authority to give
[47:17] life
[47:18] to that image
[47:21] life to that image to speak
[47:24] hallelujah we're back to the same thing
[47:27] you have no authority to speak unless
[47:29] you get their registrations
[47:32] right now
[47:33] we are living
[47:35] in the
[47:36] uh which is my topic tonight
[47:39] the time of the unwise virgin
[47:43] why
[47:44] when
[47:45] they're allowing people to speak like
[47:47] i'm preaching now we've got protestant
[47:49] churches out there preaching now message
[47:51] church is preaching now they allow that
[47:53] it's like a cat watching a mouse
[47:56] and they just allow it to go on and on
[47:59] and when they and the prophet uses the
[48:01] term when they have united all their
[48:04] powers
[48:05] amen once they've united all their
[48:08] powers they got economics they got
[48:10] religion they got uh you know commercial
[48:13] they got all these different political
[48:15] and so on they got all these powers
[48:17] together and they got it united
[48:20] now they can come openly and tell you to
[48:24] shut up
[48:25] shut down you got nothing to say if we
[48:29] don't register you we don't give you
[48:31] permission you don't see a word
[48:35] or else you're going to be in jail
[48:37] or receives whatever you have now are
[48:40] these things mythical or reimagining
[48:42] things
[48:43] look this is a real prophet struck the
[48:46] earth
[48:47] a real prophet spoke thus saith the lord
[48:51] a real prophet walked among us brought
[48:54] the word of god and we are here tonight
[48:57] why because we are resting on that
[49:01] we're believing that
[49:02] we're trusting the word of god we can
[49:05] say like paul now he says
[49:08] you know
[49:09] if if jesus
[49:11] didn't die he really didn't die and this
[49:14] was all a story then he says you know
[49:17] then i would have lived in vain
[49:20] is that right
[49:21] oh my but thank god who giveth us the
[49:25] victory through our lord jesus christ
[49:27] amen because he didn't die in vain he
[49:30] didn't rise in vain it was not an
[49:31] imagination he lives forever more he's
[49:35] the same yesterday today and forever
[49:38] amen see
[49:40] he gives life
[49:42] to that image
[49:44] the confederation of churches
[49:47] when they finally confederate themselves
[49:51] together he gives life to that image
[49:56] now i don't know but in the middle of it
[49:59] he stops and he says here now
[50:02] there are many young people here
[50:05] listening to me
[50:06] i'm speaking one spoken word it's the
[50:08] original seeds i'm i'm quoting from page
[50:11] 65 if you'd like to know that
[50:14] listen
[50:15] there are many young people here i don't
[50:17] know
[50:19] i don't know jesus may come this very
[50:22] afternoon
[50:24] he may come next year
[50:26] i don't know when he'll be coming
[50:29] oh i if and if i do not live to see that
[50:34] day
[50:35] of his coming
[50:36] i i i want to repeat now if i do not see
[50:40] it do not let this depart from your ears
[50:45] or from your heart just remember for i
[50:49] speak in the name of the lord
[50:53] now i believe with all my heart that's
[50:56] the way it will wind up
[50:59] there will be
[51:01] like a union a boycott
[51:05] all such places as this here that we are
[51:08] in
[51:09] will be closed down
[51:11] that is not a maybe hope so
[51:15] it can be no he definitely say it's just
[51:18] saith the lord places like this that we
[51:22] are in worshiping god listen we are
[51:25] going to have to go back to the times of
[51:27] jesus do you know jesus never built a
[51:29] church in his lifetime
[51:32] what we call a church
[51:34] you know he never built a building
[51:36] no
[51:37] and literally when they believe that
[51:40] they're throwing us out of these
[51:41] buildings
[51:42] they're taking us right back to the
[51:44] original primitive way
[51:47] that jesus and the disciples were
[51:50] worshiping
[51:52] if you visit israel and you see some of
[51:53] the places where we stopped and put them
[51:56] to sit down on the rocks and then he was
[51:58] talking to them like the mountain be
[52:00] attitudes if you go to some of the other
[52:02] place capoeira and so on you will see
[52:04] it's just simple
[52:06] amen they just sat around under a tree
[52:09] or they sat wrong on some rocks or or
[52:12] you know you just talked to them but
[52:15] it's denominationalism that got us all
[52:17] worked up into this oh you gotta have a
[52:19] building or you don't have a church
[52:21] oh you got to do this you have to do
[52:23] that the devil put those markers and put
[52:27] those standards that we want to live up
[52:30] to to prove we are a church we don't
[52:32] have to do that we are the when you say
[52:34] the church we become the real body of
[52:37] christ
[52:38] and the one that is in us is jesus
[52:40] christ is the spirit of christ in us
[52:43] motivate activating moving us hallelujah
[52:46] it's the same holy spirit so wherever
[52:49] you are wherever he is wherever jesus is
[52:53] that's where there's church
[52:55] is that right
[52:57] so he's in me he's in you
[52:59] we get together amen the spirits of just
[53:02] men and women made perfect through him
[53:05] and we get together through the what we
[53:08] are pulled and drawn together because we
[53:11] are hungering after righteousness we
[53:14] have a source for the ever-present water
[53:16] from the rock we want the revelation
[53:19] from the word of god hallelujah that's
[53:21] our desire that's why we're here tonight
[53:24] praise god hallelujah we're not
[53:26] attracted by rich uh a wealthy
[53:30] expensive uh tiles on the floor and uh
[53:34] you know uh like i saw in the vatican uh
[53:37] rugs that are worth hundreds of
[53:40] thousands of dollars and
[53:42] you know all kinds of
[53:44] rubies and diamonds and everything else
[53:47] that's not what attracts us amen praise
[53:50] god hallelujah but we are retracted from
[53:53] the scintillating diamonds of the
[53:56] revelation that flashes from the word of
[53:58] god thunders and lightning coming from
[54:00] the word amen voices coming from the
[54:03] word god speaking through his word into
[54:07] the hearts of his believers amen
[54:09] yes sir amen see now
[54:12] remember that
[54:14] there will be
[54:16] a union
[54:18] and there will be a boycott do you
[54:21] believe this
[54:22] amen
[54:24] all such places as this here we are in
[54:28] will be closed down
[54:30] and you will not be able to speak unless
[54:34] you get permission
[54:37] or you will have to have a license
[54:40] from this federation
[54:43] of churches
[54:44] to even hold a service
[54:48] one service
[54:50] so
[54:51] are we coming back to the times when
[54:54] uh hebrews 11
[54:56] they
[54:57] wondered about in sheepskins and goat
[55:00] skins now we won't be wearing sheepskins
[55:02] and goat skins because we dress and
[55:05] we're clothed in a different manner but
[55:08] it's trying to tell you you're going to
[55:10] actually have to hide the worship
[55:12] you're going to have to go conceal
[55:14] yourself to worship god
[55:16] right you got to go in back in the
[55:18] catacombs again amen but catacombs you
[55:22] don't have to go to rome for that i'm
[55:23] not saying that i'm saying that you'll
[55:26] find some caves somewhere
[55:28] you'll find some trees somewhere and be
[55:31] able to worship god like some of our
[55:34] brethren over in china right now uh when
[55:37] they go into worship and you know they
[55:40] have to go into a certain place and they
[55:43] have to go in one by one so they don't
[55:47] be suspected or recognize that it's a
[55:50] gathering of people coming together
[55:53] right and they will do it in this
[55:56] non-descript house or something and
[55:59] they'll worship but they won't go all of
[56:02] them there may be five or ten of them
[56:04] and then all through the day five ten
[56:06] more comes in 15 or whatever and that's
[56:09] how they have to worship god and what
[56:12] this scripture and what the prophet is
[56:14] telling us just before our going away if
[56:18] we are
[56:20] delayed enough time here
[56:22] that we will start to see this starting
[56:26] to happen
[56:28] amen and you need to know this
[56:31] right now
[56:32] you can't have
[56:34] um
[56:36] a marriage officer's license
[56:39] to marry anybody
[56:42] right
[56:43] unless you get permission
[56:46] some group
[56:48] right now they're letting things loose
[56:50] right
[56:51] so like uh
[56:53] the group that i know of
[56:55] that uh the parents of this gentleman
[56:58] were with brother branham in the early
[57:00] days and so they formed this group so
[57:03] uh they can issue licenses to
[57:06] um
[57:07] believers brethren uh like that but you
[57:10] know what that is even slipping away
[57:14] because the government will come down on
[57:16] them
[57:18] and
[57:19] they're beginning to ask now
[57:23] do you believe in the trinity
[57:26] is that right
[57:28] or they put that in
[57:29] do you believe in the trinity uh do you
[57:32] believe this do you believe that
[57:34] and then you see they start weeding out
[57:37] because a real believer is not going to
[57:39] be putting up with that
[57:41] they're going to have to get out of that
[57:44] move out of it completely right
[57:46] and they will not permit you to speak
[57:50] or deign or anything like that it's all
[57:54] coming to our end
[57:56] is that right praise god
[57:58] and even if there's some brothers they
[58:01] got they they got their ordinations and
[58:03] stuff like that and licenses when they
[58:06] were in the denomination and they came
[58:08] out
[58:09] but they still retained it
[58:12] because they were already ordained they
[58:13] were already this and right now they are
[58:16] allowed to function
[58:18] brother branham is bringing all these
[58:19] things into view that the time of this
[58:22] unwise virgin that's here upon us
[58:25] right now
[58:27] their reigns are tightening
[58:30] and as it tightens he's showing you what
[58:32] the end point is going to be
[58:35] right but a lot of things have to start
[58:38] happening before all that comes right
[58:40] out in the public
[58:41] right so they're going to start dealing
[58:43] with these things so just keep your eyes
[58:45] watching keep your hearts watching be
[58:48] vigilant and see where the word of god
[58:51] is heading oh friends
[58:54] remember
[58:56] that is where this will all end up
[59:00] uh wind up at
[59:02] that is my prediction as a servant of
[59:05] christ with the understanding and
[59:08] inspiration of the word i tell you all
[59:12] the signs are pointing to the very end
[59:17] right praise god hallelujah so what do
[59:20] we find
[59:22] the unwise virgins
[59:24] are already crying
[59:26] for oil
[59:28] we are seeing
[59:29] all the great preachers
[59:32] before if they mention one word like
[59:35] branham the ministry will fall apart
[59:38] so they wouldn't mention his name but
[59:40] now some of them are coming out and said
[59:42] oh
[59:43] this was one of the greatest
[59:47] evangelists there ever was at least
[59:50] they're doing that far then they go a
[59:51] little further and then they'll go back
[59:53] to calling him a prophet because they
[59:55] know they can't doubt that they know
[59:58] that he was a godsend prophet uh yeah i
[1:00:01] mean let me tell you friends
[1:00:04] they
[1:00:05] would have investigated brother branham
[1:00:09] they would have gone through his life
[1:00:11] his actions his works his words and
[1:00:14] everything else
[1:00:15] to see
[1:00:17] whatever if there's any fake any tricks
[1:00:20] any hypnotism any psycho any therapies
[1:00:23] of whatever what they look up on him in
[1:00:26] every way but they can't touch anything
[1:00:31] just like when jesus came he was
[1:00:32] blameless
[1:00:34] god sent the prophet in this hour he's
[1:00:37] blameless
[1:00:38] and they wouldn't even doubt it if they
[1:00:41] recognize what it was
[1:00:44] because they don't realize that the
[1:00:46] mighty angel of revelation 10
[1:00:50] in our time
[1:00:52] when the first two polls came to an end
[1:00:56] the time came
[1:00:57] for the seven
[1:00:59] seals to be open and the seventh one to
[1:01:03] break forth to bring out the elect
[1:01:06] then that my angel cried with a loud
[1:01:09] voice
[1:01:10] and
[1:01:11] that mighty angel came down
[1:01:15] i believe arizona and i was up on the
[1:01:18] mountain very early days with brother
[1:01:20] perry green and saw the rock scattered
[1:01:23] they're in not now they're all taken
[1:01:24] away by people
[1:01:26] but here comes the mighty angel
[1:01:29] and it comes to the earthly angel
[1:01:32] of revelation 10 7.
[1:01:35] so revelation 10 1 came
[1:01:39] and moved in revelation 10 7.
[1:01:43] so looking to the unseen you'll hear
[1:01:45] brother brother branham preaching and in
[1:01:47] the middle of the preaching suddenly our
[1:01:49] voice sounds
[1:01:51] this is not william branham speaking
[1:01:55] this is the lord god almighty come down
[1:01:59] william branham has only loaned me his
[1:02:01] voice and his body amen praise god
[1:02:05] friends let me tell you
[1:02:07] some great supernatural things have
[1:02:09] happened in our day
[1:02:11] and we are blessed to be witnesses of
[1:02:13] these things
[1:02:15] god speaking through a prophet so
[1:02:17] revelation 10 1 came into revelation 10
[1:02:21] 7 brother branham's preaching changes
[1:02:24] everything changed i won't get into much
[1:02:26] of that but instead of saying uh second
[1:02:29] of coming of christ second coming of
[1:02:31] christ he's coming again oh flashing red
[1:02:34] light of his coming and
[1:02:36] all of a sudden he changed ah greater
[1:02:39] than solomon is here
[1:02:42] is that right
[1:02:43] praise god
[1:02:44] hallelujah who do you say
[1:02:47] this
[1:02:48] is
[1:02:50] oh my goodness gracious the people
[1:02:52] didn't understand what he was saying
[1:02:55] amen
[1:02:56] god
[1:02:57] in a prophet
[1:03:00] which is a body prepared
[1:03:04] and put down here in a certain age that
[1:03:07] god knows he can come to indwell and
[1:03:09] speak true
[1:03:10] amen
[1:03:11] when they say oh the prophet was just a
[1:03:14] preacher
[1:03:15] he shouldn't be able to teach
[1:03:18] if they realize who was speaking through
[1:03:20] that prophet
[1:03:22] they will sit down and let him just
[1:03:24] teach them amen praise the name of the
[1:03:26] lord oh my
[1:03:28] oh friends
[1:03:30] you see the unwise virgin has
[1:03:34] begun to cry out for oil
[1:03:38] but
[1:03:38] think of it she was a virgin
[1:03:41] and if she's a virgin it means she's a
[1:03:44] church
[1:03:46] right
[1:03:47] now revelation 17 speaks of that harlot
[1:03:51] church
[1:03:52] see oh and even john even admired her
[1:03:56] because of her great beauty and she was
[1:03:59] a beautiful thing to behold but yet in
[1:04:03] her was found the blood of the saints
[1:04:07] amen
[1:04:08] i believe it is 68 million on the
[1:04:11] mitrology of the roman catholic church
[1:04:15] that was put to death
[1:04:17] since saint augustine of hippo
[1:04:20] 68 million
[1:04:22] killed
[1:04:23] and recorded
[1:04:25] amen see because of what
[1:04:29] disagreeing with her and her doctrine
[1:04:32] that's all that's all that's right there
[1:04:35] disagreeing with her why she doesn't see
[1:04:37] the word she doesn't believe the word
[1:04:39] she doesn't really teach the word she
[1:04:42] she just
[1:04:43] preaches a lie see she just preaches a
[1:04:46] lie which you know what is a lie a lie
[1:04:50] has to be mixed with enough truth in
[1:04:52] there for people to swallow it
[1:04:55] amen so she mixed in uh a little bit of
[1:04:58] the bible here and there in biblical
[1:05:00] terms and scriptural terms uh to create
[1:05:03] a religious uh bewitching uh spirit upon
[1:05:06] the people and to draw them in in that
[1:05:09] way but let me stay with and quote the
[1:05:12] prophet because i am behind the word
[1:05:15] right now when i speak like that
[1:05:18] if i were to come out and then make that
[1:05:21] kind of a condemnation
[1:05:23] they can easily send the
[1:05:26] law enforcement to pick me up and said
[1:05:28] you called us you said this but i'm not
[1:05:31] saying anything
[1:05:32] i'm preaching right from the storehouse
[1:05:36] that's why all this was stored up but
[1:05:39] god is allowing us now to be able to
[1:05:42] recognize and see
[1:05:44] what the prophet was saying and
[1:05:46] understand what the prophet was saying
[1:05:49] in the word amen praise god hallelujah
[1:05:53] so you see it
[1:05:55] then jesus said there would come a time
[1:05:57] they would kill you thinking they were
[1:06:00] doing god a service
[1:06:02] and there would be sincere about it
[1:06:05] you see they're dead sincere
[1:06:07] because
[1:06:09] that's what they were taught
[1:06:12] and when that word that was taught they
[1:06:15] thought it was planted in them that also
[1:06:19] has to bring forth a crop see
[1:06:22] and that's why what he's saying here
[1:06:24] they killed 68 million back then they're
[1:06:27] gonna start doing the same thing after
[1:06:29] they bring that boycott and you don't
[1:06:31] heat it then it's going to repeat all
[1:06:33] over again right that's what he's
[1:06:36] talking about here it'll repeat again in
[1:06:39] that
[1:06:40] manner like that that unwise virgin amen
[1:06:45] but see the bride stands with the seed
[1:06:49] the spoken word seed of god which is the
[1:06:53] seed and it will produce what it says
[1:06:57] that it will produce i believe it
[1:07:01] i believe it praise god that's the
[1:07:04] reason i believe in divine healing do
[1:07:06] you
[1:07:07] he says i believe in visions do you
[1:07:11] he says i believe in angels do you
[1:07:15] praise god i believe in this message do
[1:07:18] you
[1:07:19] praise god hallelujah it's because it
[1:07:23] all comes from the word of god i believe
[1:07:27] it amen i believe with all my heart that
[1:07:30] this is thus saith the lord
[1:07:33] amen
[1:07:35] now see
[1:07:36] this unwise woman this virgin as i have
[1:07:40] said
[1:07:41] this church
[1:07:43] but she is unwise because she delayed
[1:07:48] she is the literary and not receiving
[1:07:52] the word of god play around with the
[1:07:54] word of god use it for money making use
[1:07:58] it for advertisement
[1:08:00] use it for millions more in our
[1:08:02] organization oh praise god use the
[1:08:06] prophet's ministry to enrich to multiply
[1:08:09] themselves and and glorify themselves he
[1:08:13] himself said it he said you know i've
[1:08:16] sent from this message
[1:08:19] millions into the oneness assembly of
[1:08:22] god this church that group this other
[1:08:24] group amen hallelujah what and they were
[1:08:27] willing for that but watch
[1:08:30] when the first
[1:08:32] and second pull was over
[1:08:34] and now he comes to the
[1:08:37] seed word preaching of the spoken word
[1:08:40] seed
[1:08:41] all of a sudden oh we thought he was a
[1:08:44] prophet he's not really a prophet he's
[1:08:45] not
[1:08:46] he has no right to teach the word
[1:08:49] you know they want more signs they want
[1:08:51] more miracles they want more healings
[1:08:53] but they don't want the word
[1:08:55] brother branham said one place he says
[1:08:58] he says it's okay in the first couple of
[1:09:00] years of jesus ministry he says
[1:09:03] he had years of what uh years of
[1:09:06] preparation
[1:09:08] and then he had years of popularity
[1:09:10] brother branham didn't say that i'm
[1:09:12] saying that now but
[1:09:13] you know you had years of popularity
[1:09:16] and then come the years of persecution
[1:09:20] is that right so now we see as we look
[1:09:22] into the word here that he is literally
[1:09:26] he is literally showing the same thing
[1:09:28] happening in his ministry and in his
[1:09:30] life right amen oh my when the angel was
[1:09:34] teaching him this and teaching him that
[1:09:36] teaching that and then he got popular
[1:09:38] with the discernment and the healings
[1:09:40] and and the calling out of the people
[1:09:42] from the congregation the names the
[1:09:44] places their address got popular and
[1:09:47] then after that what where did he go to
[1:09:49] all of a sudden he's in his years of
[1:09:52] persecution
[1:09:54] and everything's starting to come down
[1:09:56] on him amen
[1:09:58] now notice
[1:10:00] now notice she called herself a bride
[1:10:03] she calls herself a bride remember
[1:10:06] everything in this bible runs from tree
[1:10:09] see
[1:10:10] father son and holy ghost
[1:10:14] and god the father
[1:10:16] was the god
[1:10:18] that lived in the pillar of fire
[1:10:21] hallelujah
[1:10:24] he was using that to draw israel to him
[1:10:29] praise god hallelujah
[1:10:31] now god the father
[1:10:34] came down lived in the son
[1:10:38] which made him god the son
[1:10:43] see
[1:10:44] god the son
[1:10:45] now we see god the son then
[1:10:50] we know he died on a cross
[1:10:53] but when he was here in him
[1:10:56] he was the expressed image of god
[1:11:00] hallelujah hallelujah or the seed of god
[1:11:05] made manifest
[1:11:07] right in other words people have a
[1:11:09] visible perspective a visible uh a
[1:11:12] visualization
[1:11:14] of of of god and how he would act
[1:11:17] and and how he would do and stuff like
[1:11:19] that because god being a spirit nobody
[1:11:22] could see him they wouldn't know him in
[1:11:24] that way but with the actions and the
[1:11:27] life and the
[1:11:28] signs the power the creativity
[1:11:31] everything that came out of him they
[1:11:33] were able now to have some
[1:11:35] idea
[1:11:36] of god for god was expressing an image
[1:11:40] amen and jesus christ back there
[1:11:43] hallelujah now we see that now that
[1:11:47] other office the holy ghost was this is
[1:11:51] the same god hallelujah amen and now
[1:11:55] trying to bring the word the spoken word
[1:12:00] like them other two officers did before
[1:12:03] to the people and now they are rejecting
[1:12:06] it
[1:12:08] see
[1:12:09] it's the three offices
[1:12:12] or three manifestations
[1:12:15] of the one god
[1:12:17] now in action
[1:12:19] hallelujah amen you see that now you
[1:12:21] don't have to just hear the word hear
[1:12:23] the message and oh i hear the message i
[1:12:25] believe you must recognize what you
[1:12:28] heard
[1:12:29] you must have a revelation an
[1:12:30] understanding of what you heard and when
[1:12:32] you get that now then
[1:12:35] it makes you want to see the word man
[1:12:38] manifest in your life
[1:12:41] hallelujah and then the word that was
[1:12:43] written word spoken word in you becomes
[1:12:46] the living word
[1:12:48] living epistles to be read of all men
[1:12:52] see it's that way because it's now god
[1:12:57] in action what
[1:12:59] god now in his people
[1:13:02] today god in action
[1:13:06] and god is in action for it is god
[1:13:10] in the people amen praise god hallelujah
[1:13:15] god
[1:13:16] hiding i'm going to i'm i'm going to i'm
[1:13:19] going to start winding this down because
[1:13:22] remember there's a lot of inspiration
[1:13:24] height striking me here i can go talking
[1:13:26] about the badger skins of the temple and
[1:13:28] all this stuff but right now let's stick
[1:13:31] with what we are we're talking about
[1:13:33] here so now remember so they went to buy
[1:13:37] oil
[1:13:39] see
[1:13:40] but when she did she found out it was
[1:13:43] too late
[1:13:45] amen praise god hallelujah because the
[1:13:49] seeds were done planted
[1:13:53] amen you see friends
[1:13:56] people are finding out
[1:13:58] that you don't get born again now
[1:14:01] you are not really saved now
[1:14:05] because
[1:14:06] you don't get eternal life now
[1:14:10] because if you have eternal life brother
[1:14:13] branham said and the bible says you
[1:14:15] always had to be eternal
[1:14:20] and if you were always eternal there was
[1:14:24] no time when you were not
[1:14:27] there will be no time when you will not
[1:14:29] be
[1:14:30] because you're a part of him
[1:14:33] now reveal now manifest hallelujah
[1:14:36] praise god hallelujah amen praise god
[1:14:40] now i repeat you're looking at me now
[1:14:43] all you're seeing is this outward man
[1:14:45] right that's why paul had to say later
[1:14:48] on
[1:14:49] then shall we know as we are known it's
[1:14:52] only really then you're going to really
[1:14:54] know me because all you're hearing is
[1:14:56] the spirit inside speaking
[1:14:59] right and this is the house god give me
[1:15:02] to live in now
[1:15:03] amen explain to black bronc whatever you
[1:15:06] want to call it but that's the house he
[1:15:09] give me to live in and i'm living in it
[1:15:11] and speaking from my house door
[1:15:14] praise god hallelujah but i want you to
[1:15:17] know friends this is the
[1:15:20] this entire bride is the body of christ
[1:15:23] this is the son of man now being
[1:15:25] revealed in a bright form
[1:15:28] in the form of a bride making himself
[1:15:30] known in this great hour amen praise god
[1:15:34] hallelujah i want you to know it but
[1:15:36] this unwise virgin went to buy oil found
[1:15:40] out she was too lit because the seeds
[1:15:42] been done planted when were the seeds
[1:15:43] planted
[1:15:46] before the foundations of the world
[1:15:50] they were in god is that right
[1:15:53] and they came forth manifested
[1:15:57] and we know that all the seeds were in
[1:16:00] jesus christ
[1:16:02] just like all
[1:16:04] my father's generation
[1:16:07] come from him come to me go from me go
[1:16:10] down through my children and if time
[1:16:12] permits it it's going to spread out
[1:16:14] spread out that's human generation where
[1:16:17] god put his life
[1:16:19] all his germs into
[1:16:22] jesus christ
[1:16:24] the fullness
[1:16:26] of the godhead bodily
[1:16:29] and then what now my friends
[1:16:32] we see
[1:16:33] them seeds that were in him
[1:16:36] praise god
[1:16:37] he died and the seeds were released
[1:16:40] hallelujah and the jeans the germs
[1:16:45] they're all eternal
[1:16:47] come and now the the elected is lodged
[1:16:51] into the elected hallelujah praise god
[1:16:54] and now the spirit of god
[1:16:57] falls on that word
[1:17:00] it falls on the word i'm not talking
[1:17:02] about the the written word here that you
[1:17:05] just uh believe
[1:17:07] but the original word
[1:17:11] that you were chosen in him before the
[1:17:13] foundation and all those things and he
[1:17:15] dwells in you and the spirit comes to
[1:17:18] wake that up
[1:17:19] so that you like a baby whose eyes were
[1:17:22] cloudy and you couldn't fully understand
[1:17:24] all of a sudden your sights start
[1:17:26] getting clearer you start to recognize
[1:17:29] you start seeing moving objects you
[1:17:31] start putting the pieces of god's jigsaw
[1:17:33] puzzle together and all of a sudden you
[1:17:35] start seeing christ revealed in his own
[1:17:38] word hallelujah you begin to see him as
[1:17:41] he makes himself manifest i'm going to
[1:17:43] stop right now praise god
[1:17:45] yeah because i told you i would stop
[1:17:47] praise god doesn't matter how
[1:17:50] sweet and wonderful it is solomon said
