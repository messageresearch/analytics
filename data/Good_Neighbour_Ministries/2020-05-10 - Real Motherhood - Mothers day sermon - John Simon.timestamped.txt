[0:15] good Sunday morning grins brothers

[0:34] into his courts with praise be thankful
[0:41] unto Him and bless His Holy Name let us
[0:46] pray
[0:47] our gracious Heavenly Father we thank
[0:51] you for this privilege of Prayer and we
[0:55] pray today that the Blessed Holy Spirit
[0:59] will speak to our hearts and Lord Jesus
[1:03] lifter lift us up to a higher plane and
[1:07] make us stronger in the grace of God for
[1:12] we ask it in Jesus name
[1:17] today we want to celebrate motherhood
[1:23] and we want to thank our mothers for
[1:30] their selfless service undying love and
[1:36] their tender care I'd like to share with
[1:44] you a wonderful plan with this time by
[1:49] Ruth Underhill you'll always find her
[1:56] busy as she flits from room to room and
[2:02] hardly can I picture her without a mop
[2:07] or broom she keeps the floors so shiny
[2:13] you could almost see your face and each
[2:19] and every trinket was dusted in its
[2:24] place
[2:26] though constantly kept toiling by the
[2:30] work of each new day she still had time
[2:34] to read to us when we dressed from our
[2:40] play
[2:41] she still had time to tuck us in and to
[2:48] hear or childish prayers the golden
[2:52] memories of mother still hovers
[2:57] everywhere
[2:59] what a beautiful poem by Ruth H
[3:04] Underhill my mother I would also share
[3:12] with you the tribute by Patrick H Adams
[3:19] she was as good as goodness is her axe
[3:24] and all her words were kind and high
[3:29] above all memories I hold the beauty of
[3:33] her mind President Abraham Lincoln said
[3:39] these memorable words all that I am or
[3:44] hope to be I owe to my angel mother
[3:51] George Washington I attribute my success
[3:56] in life so the moral intellectual and
[4:02] physical education which I received from
[4:09] my mother how marvelous and wonderful to
[4:15] hear great men who have made their mark
[4:18] on this in this world's history saying
[4:23] such wonderful things paying such great
[4:28] and remarkable tributes
[4:30] to their darling mother now let us pause
[4:35] and read from the scripture out of the
[4:38] book
[4:39] of exodus chapter 2 verse 9 and
[4:43] Pharaoh's daughter said unto her take
[4:48] this child away and nurse it for me and
[4:53] I will give thee wages and the woman
[4:58] took the child and she nursed it
[5:02] now of course friends that's the story
[5:05] of Moses his mother the story is there
[5:10] in Exodus 2 how pharaoh's daughter went
[5:15] down sister went down to the river and
[5:17] there she saw this baby in the basket
[5:21] rescued it had it rescued then needed to
[5:26] have a wet nurse it just so happened by
[5:30] the providence and grace of God that the
[5:35] very nurse that she hired to take care
[5:39] of the child was Jacob was Moses's own
[5:43] mother chuckle Beth what a wonderful
[5:48] marvelous story and of course she said
[5:51] take care of the child and I will give
[5:54] you wages
[5:55] I believe God was speaking through her
[5:59] at that time to all real mothers
[6:03] everywhere and that's what I'd like to
[6:05] talk about real motherhood real
[6:09] motherhood so here we see this marvelous
[6:12] situation and here we are today
[6:16] celebrating Mother's Day happy Mother's
[6:20] Day to one and all but we know that real
[6:27] motherhood is just not having the
[6:31] ability to have a child because that is
[6:37] not motherhood that only proves a
[6:40] person's womanhood motherhood absolutely
[6:46] is a natural god-given instinct and
[6:51] ability that God placed in a woman and
[6:56] and is enhanced and empowered by the
[7:00] presence of the Holy Spirit in her life
[7:03] to bring up all the attributes that are
[7:07] necessary to express real genuine
[7:11] motherhood well we know in fact God is
[7:15] our mother God is our Father so a real
[7:18] real motherhood expresses a part of the
[7:23] personality of God God looks upon a
[7:27] mother a real mother that's moving in
[7:30] the spirit of real motherhood say take
[7:34] care of this child and when you come to
[7:37] the end of the way I will give you wages
[7:42] now we know real motherhood is not about
[7:48] your body it's not about your beauty nor
[7:55] isn't about your brains it's more about
[7:59] your belief system it's more about your
[8:04] foundational faith and God said take
[8:09] care of this child I've given this child
[8:12] to you take care of it and I will give
[8:15] you wages when I come o blessed be the
[8:20] name of our precious Lord Jesus who will
[8:23] reward real mother's real against those
[8:28] that are false real against those that
[8:32] are untrue to their responsibilities
[8:37] this is what we want to talk about this
[8:40] is what we're talking about here today
[8:43] no we know of course that the spirit and
[8:50] nature of motherhood will even cause a
[8:56] woman who has does not have the ability
[9:02] to conceive or to be
[9:05] child but that nature that real spirit
[9:10] of motherhood and the nature of
[9:13] motherhood will cause that woman to want
[9:17] to adopt a child to be able to project
[9:22] her love and to share her feelings with
[9:27] that child so she looked up the child
[9:30] who's possibly its own blood-related
[9:36] mother does not love that child as much
[9:40] as the one who adopted it so what is
[9:44] motherhood not just the ability to bear
[9:46] a child but it's the spirit of
[9:49] motherhood it's the nature that isn't a
[9:53] person
[9:54] it's the qualities that are within that
[9:58] individual that comes out to bless her
[10:01] immediate family and to bless the world
[10:04] for such a mother even though she has
[10:08] never born her own child can be a better
[10:12] mother many times than the one who
[10:16] actually born the child No thank God I
[10:21] want to take God that he gave me a real
[10:24] mother a mother that was self
[10:28] sacrificial a mother that was forgiving
[10:35] God gave me a mother that was very
[10:38] protective she was providing she was a
[10:45] hardworking person she was a thinking
[10:49] woman a wise woman she was loving and
[10:54] she was kind to this very day her
[11:00] reputation still echoes and resumes in
[11:05] the hearts of many who called me from
[11:08] time to time
[11:09] and everywhere she was called mother
[11:13] Simon and that was because she mothered
[11:18] every
[11:19] and any person that she met she had the
[11:23] spirit of motherhood that blessed many
[11:28] many around the world and her reputation
[11:31] was mother Simon now she's gone to be
[11:36] with the Lord and she I believe is in
[11:41] the presence of God and in heaven at
[11:43] this time but I have faith and trust in
[11:47] God we'll meet again in heaven some
[11:51] sweet day and until then may god rest
[11:55] her gallant and wonderful soul and a
[12:00] great example that she left for her
[12:04] children what a legacy for a woman to
[12:08] leave to be a real mother not to just
[12:12] prove that you're a woman but to carry
[12:17] out the rights responsibilities the
[12:19] wrong the example of motherhood that you
[12:24] can leave an enduring lasting legacy
[12:28] upon your generations to come no oh yes
[12:35] may God bless our darling mothers
[12:39] everywhere real mothers I believe are
[12:44] like thee another gospel there another
[12:48] gospel Matthew Mark Luke and John and
[12:51] mother because she is a living
[12:55] expression of the love of God when you
[12:59] see a real mother that loves her child
[13:03] and expresses the graces the dignity and
[13:07] the love that that that shows motherhood
[13:10] oh you see the love of God who said I
[13:15] will not leave you nor forsake you but
[13:18] I'll be with you to the very end of the
[13:21] age
[13:21] oh I thank God for that kind of love
[13:25] that is expressed in real motherhood
[13:30] which is only partial
[13:32] expressing the love of God for the love
[13:35] of God is boundless
[13:37] full and free it's beyond our
[13:39] imagination of what we can even think or
[13:42] what we can imagine within our hearts
[13:45] the love of God that he has sent down to
[13:48] man now the first real mother of course
[13:52] then I would want to speak about is
[13:55] Moses his mother we find that Moses
[14:01] mother was a woman of God she was in an
[14:09] Israelite a believer in one God and from
[14:15] what we can see of Moses his life in the
[14:19] Bible she was his first teacher and she
[14:25] taught him everything she knew about
[14:30] Jehovah about the scriptures that she
[14:33] knew all that she knew he learned it at
[14:37] her knees he was taunted laying upon her
[14:42] bosom he was taunted looking up into her
[14:47] kindly motherly eyes this was not the
[14:51] eyes of a wet nurse or of a servant but
[14:56] the eyes of a mother looking upon her
[15:00] son oh praise be to God may you see and
[15:05] understand what this picture is telling
[15:09] us first of all our mothers are our
[15:12] first teachers before we can talk before
[15:16] we can walk before we can do anything
[15:20] our mothers are our very first teachers
[15:24] after that then maybe your father will
[15:27] teachers and then after that our will be
[15:32] handed to over to the principal or
[15:35] school master and after that we'll
[15:39] gravitate towards our pastor or minister
[15:44] who will teach us
[15:46] of the ways of God and eternity eternal
[15:50] verities of the things of this wonderful
[15:54] book but our mothers are our first
[15:58] teachers and I'm thinking that she must
[16:03] have told her son Moses talked him
[16:07] everything and said Moses we us
[16:13] israelites had a promise given to our
[16:16] father Abraham that after 400 years how
[16:22] he would bring our people out of Egypt
[16:26] and I believe in my heart Moses you are
[16:32] not deliverer or you may be that
[16:34] deliverer my boy I want you to grow up
[16:38] believing that God can use you to be
[16:43] that deliverer
[16:45] oh if any of you know of the song the
[16:51] album called Prince of Egypt there's a
[16:54] song on there that says or ask the
[16:57] question can you be the one are you the
[17:00] one and I believe that's exactly what
[17:04] this is she was placing it in his heart
[17:08] then he was not a loser he was not a
[17:12] slave he was not just a day laborer
[17:16] he was not anything to be in the mud or
[17:21] to be a mud dauber for the rest of his
[17:23] life but for him to recognize that he
[17:27] came from from a people that were
[17:30] anointed of God and she as his mother
[17:34] would believe that he would be that
[17:38] deliverer
[17:39] so I believe that in zaptor under that
[17:43] kind of belief system this woman must
[17:48] have told her son son live according to
[17:52] the Torah live according to the
[17:53] scriptures live holy live
[17:58] keep yourself away from all the the
[18:01] unsavory things of the world and keep
[18:05] yourself clean because I believe son
[18:09] you're the one I believe that you are
[18:12] the one and God will use you what a
[18:15] thing for a mother to say and so there
[18:18] he was my brothers and sisters you do
[18:22] you see the picture of a real mother how
[18:26] she will speak to her children who shall
[18:29] encourage them not to discourage not to
[18:33] destroy not to tear them up mentally
[18:37] call them all kinds of names call them
[18:42] losers call them dumb call them fools
[18:45] call them and constantly berating that
[18:49] child what a real mother will lift up
[18:53] their child inspire them to high Heights
[18:56] greater things and be able to give them
[19:00] the courage and the confidence that they
[19:03] are able to achieve the highest Heights
[19:07] and they're able to do things beyond
[19:10] their own selves and to be a blessing to
[19:12] the entire world she taught him the
[19:15] precepts of the Word of God she told him
[19:21] how to live holy men more men mother's
[19:24] teach their children how to live and
[19:26] that they should live holy O God bless
[19:31] every mother here today that's listening
[19:33] to my voice and may the Holy Spirit
[19:36] place these words within them yes sir
[19:39] she taught him and told him how he must
[19:43] live and what God will do for him if he
[19:47] walked right top-ranked and lived right
[19:51] oh I think any good true and loyal
[19:55] mother that will take the time to pick
[20:00] up her babies or child and talk to it
[20:04] and and and tell them about the good
[20:09] life on the things of
[20:11] God the God life and the things of God
[20:14] certainly my brothers and sisters that
[20:17] is a wonderful picture for us to behold
[20:21] and not to be like some of those mothers
[20:25] who seek their real mothers but they're
[20:28] not real mothers because no real mothers
[20:31] will just take her child and plunk it in
[20:35] front of a TV screen for the entire day
[20:38] to having their impressionable minds to
[20:42] take everything that they're going to be
[20:44] singing in and after a while they will
[20:48] not be able to separate reality from
[20:51] fantasy but a real mother will take
[20:55] their child teach them talk to them and
[20:58] placement em even in them the seeds of
[21:02] hope gives them the strength and the
[21:04] courage to carry on in this dirt and
[21:08] this sinful world now we see so friends
[21:13] that a real mother will love her
[21:17] children with an undying love and try to
[21:22] help them regardless of the conditions
[21:26] they're going through we're living in a
[21:29] tough cold heartless world and they have
[21:35] to face it on in the schools in the
[21:40] streets everywhere they go and so they
[21:44] need our support they need our love they
[21:49] need to know after they have been
[21:52] berated and beaten down mentally
[21:55] spiritually and sometimes even
[21:57] physically that they can come home to
[22:01] the warmth of the love of a darling
[22:04] sweet mother that will accept them that
[22:08] will talk to them regardless of what
[22:11] they have been through over the day or
[22:14] months weeks or months and we'll try to
[22:18] help them in every way and not to give
[22:22] up on your child continue
[22:24] pre pre pre until you bring God's
[22:28] blessing down upon them pray my sister
[22:32] pray and be a real mother that will go
[22:36] into the presence of God and ask for his
[22:39] love his mercy and His grace to
[22:42] protection to rest upon your child on
[22:46] your children in these dark and dismal
[22:50] days in which we are living when your
[22:54] children get deceived by the world but
[22:58] the things that are in this world a real
[23:02] mother would throw them away or as we
[23:06] will say throw them to the dogs just
[23:09] because they have made multiple mistakes
[23:14] but whether that child whether that
[23:19] child of theirs is 5 years old or 50
[23:23] years old a real mother will want to get
[23:28] with her child sit top with the child
[23:32] maybe put their arms around that child
[23:35] and saying well mother walk I am with
[23:39] you I'll support you I'll do everything
[23:43] I can to help you
[23:45] of course there are situations where the
[23:48] child reject help the child doesn't want
[23:51] it they choose their own path and
[23:54] especially when they come of age or come
[23:57] to a certain time in their life they
[24:01] choose their life's path and there is
[24:03] nothing much you can do about that but
[24:06] you can at least continue to pray for
[24:09] them but let them know that you will not
[24:12] support evil habits you will not support
[24:15] evil actions and evil ways but you love
[24:18] them and love them fully with all your
[24:22] hearts in every way and will never stop
[24:25] loving them yes
[24:28] that's very important to know that a
[24:30] real mother regardless of whether
[24:33] they're right or whether they're wrong
[24:36] she'll try to help them
[24:39] anyhow and pray to God that God's hand
[24:43] of love and mercy will be with them
[24:46] she'll stay with them as long as you can
[24:48] and then my brothers and sisters our
[24:52] prayers annoying to them or going to
[24:55] them will rise up before God into the
[24:59] heavens as a sweet-smelling incense and
[25:02] God I believe our God that we serve will
[25:05] hear and answer prayer now let me talk
[25:10] about another mother real quick and this
[25:15] mother's name is Herodias who was the
[25:18] wife of King Herod back in my two days
[25:24] now she had a daughter and her
[25:28] daughter's name which is a popular and
[25:31] famous name salomi but instead of
[25:36] raising her daughter or her child in the
[25:40] ways of God and teaching her about
[25:44] Jehovah she started teaching her how to
[25:48] dance and dance Neelu dances of the
[25:54] world and of course with her teaching
[26:01] salami rose to be one of the most
[26:04] seductive charming dancers of birthday
[26:10] and her time until King Herod invited
[26:17] her to dance before him and there I
[26:21] believe she danced the dance of the
[26:24] Seven Veils and the dance of this Seven
[26:30] Veils
[26:31] this was just an ancient way of what we
[26:37] will call a modern day striptease and so
[26:42] salami dance before the king and found
[26:45] favor in his lewd and lustful eyes
[26:52] and there he said US ask for whatever
[26:56] you want and I'll give it to you and
[26:59] just to show you how this child was
[27:02] taught
[27:03] because right to the last moment or
[27:06] mother already told her if you can ask
[27:11] you what do you want tell him you want
[27:13] the head of John the Baptist's in other
[27:15] words telling you what the head of that
[27:17] preacher that preacher that's preaching
[27:20] against all manner of sin and iniquity
[27:22] and evil and wrongdoing and preaching
[27:26] against her life's time for she was
[27:29] living in adultery she was living up
[27:32] fast and loose life and she hated their
[27:36] preacher for telling the truth of God it
[27:39] wasn't his truth it was God's truth and
[27:42] he was saying what God said in God's
[27:45] Word and it's so enraged her that she
[27:50] literally please that that hatred that
[27:55] enragement into the heart of her child
[27:58] caused her to dance for this King and
[28:01] then ask for the head of the preacher of
[28:04] that day I don't doubt that even today
[28:07] while I mentioned the word there may be
[28:10] some that may want to ask for my head
[28:13] oh my eye I asked God to help me and to
[28:17] protect me and watch over me but not my
[28:19] literal head but spiritually I'm talking
[28:22] about so here it is friends that we see
[28:25] them that she danced like that and she
[28:29] finally got John the Baptist's head but
[28:32] history records we serve a God that
[28:37] always watches over his servants touch
[28:41] not my anointed do my prophets no harm
[28:44] and the history tells us that over
[28:50] seventy of her generations live the life
[28:57] of prostitutes and
[28:59] Dinah's prostitutes and another set of
[29:03] them live
[29:05] Harr believes that their end came on the
[29:09] gallows
[29:10] there were hum what a legacy to give to
[29:16] your child
[29:17] one mother talked her child the things
[29:23] of this world the other mother talked
[29:28] her child the things of God one became a
[29:32] great deliverer for his people and a
[29:37] conqueror under leader until his name
[29:41] resounds and is immortal to all men and
[29:45] throughout the pages of human history
[29:49] and so the other one what legacy did she
[29:55] leave for influence went out also for
[30:01] influence of lust and seduction went out
[30:06] her hatred for preachers went out from
[30:09] the way she spoke about preachers in
[30:12] front of her children
[30:13] and in his let's nap and we find out we
[30:17] find out let no doubt hard life
[30:20] influence tens of thousands who may be
[30:24] at this time in the pits of hell far
[30:29] from the presence of Almighty God listen
[30:34] the wisdom of God's Word bring up a
[30:37] child in the way that it should go all
[30:42] friends when the child gets older the
[30:45] child will not want to depart from that
[30:47] way bring up your child I know some
[30:52] mothers that were you can't say they
[30:56] were looked upon as the best of mothers
[30:59] but they would at least want to bring
[31:04] their child to church send a child to a
[31:07] sunday-school and then after a while
[31:09] they want to see and hear what the child
[31:11] was doing and maybe adhere to later they
[31:15] find themselves in
[31:16] Church because some problem came up and
[31:19] God was able to solve their problem oh
[31:22] praise be to God I certainly sympathize
[31:27] with all mothers everywhere and the
[31:31] things they go through and I want us to
[31:35] honor our mothers today I want us to
[31:38] honor our grandmothers today many of us
[31:42] may want to honor in an aunt today that
[31:48] might have raised us or helped us or was
[31:51] a bridge for us well make may we honor
[31:54] some older relative of ours let us touch
[32:00] their lives impressed us and showed us
[32:04] the way of life for us to be able to
[32:08] advance and may have even materially
[32:12] helped us in some way or D or the other
[32:16] think of it honor a mother that might

[34:25] and when you do that God's Word says in
[34:31] the book of Proverbs that your children
[34:35] will raise up and call you blessing that
[34:39] you're a blessed woman you're a precious
[34:41] woman you're a darling mother and they
[34:46] will express their love admiration and
[34:49] appreciation for all the wonderful
[34:52] things that you have done and long after
[34:56] you've gone on your name will pass on to
[35:01] your grandchildren and your great great
[35:03] grandchildren of what claim of a mother
[35:07] who you were and what kind of motherhood
[35:10] you represented oh yes that's the real
[35:15] spirit of motherhood the real spirit of
[35:19] motherhood is not to love your mother on
[35:23] this one day and to give her just
[35:26] flowers or a cake or some gift of
[35:31] appreciation and then forget her for the
[35:34] rest of the year or tuck her away in a
[35:38] nursing home and and then you hardly
[35:41] will
[35:42] here again but you should love your
[35:45] mother and honor her and respect her 365
[35:51] days a year let your love go out to her
[35:55] and visit with her as often as you can
[35:59] share your love for her one time she led
[36:04] you by the hand and walked you across
[36:07] the street or across the hall now it's
[36:10] your turn to lead her by the hand leave
[36:14] her in there with that walker in that
[36:17] walker this is your chance now for you
[36:21] to receive a blessing as the Scriptures
[36:24] have said honour thy father and thy
[36:26] mother that my days may be long upon the
[36:31] land which the LORD thy God giveth thee
[36:35] yes sir all we see men and these
[36:41] merchant Prince's have turned this
[36:45] mother's day in the day of marketing
[36:48] merchandising and money they've turned
[36:51] it into something that is commercialized
[36:54] and a plastic a fake kind of love that
[37:00] lasts for a day and and then it withers
[37:03] and dies is gone with all the flowers
[37:06] but we're talking about a children
[37:10] loving their mothers with that bitter
[37:12] love that will last and mothers loving
[37:16] their children with an undying and
[37:18] unending love annoying that if they both
[37:22] live for God they'll meet again in the
[37:26] eternities made a great holy spirit
[37:29] speak to your heart today and help you
[37:32] to make a turn they could change or the
[37:35] same Lord I want to do better Lord I I
[37:38] want to be that kind of mother I want to
[37:42] express this genuine real god-given
[37:46] motherhood that only you can teach me O
[37:49] Lord so here we are in this
[37:53] of modern-day commercial whipped up
[37:58] frenzy yes sir and the whole thing I've
[38:02] friends let me tell you this whole thing
[38:05] it is a basket case that's headed
[38:08] straight to hell because that's not the
[38:11] genuine thing they'd taken God out of it
[38:15] taken him out of the of the schools take
[38:18] them out of the courts take him up they
[38:20] did Jessie raise them from everywhere
[38:23] make him a joke on the television so
[38:26] that you know children are laughing and
[38:27] the things of God to talk about the Word
[38:30] of God it becomes so boring to them but
[38:34] back to the Bible back to the original
[38:37] faith back to the faith of your fathers
[38:40] and your mothers your grandmother and
[38:42] your grandfather
[38:43] there will be ashamed of some of us they
[38:45] will weep or as we say turning the grave
[38:48] if they see the way you're walking and
[38:51] living today Oh friends come to the Lord
[38:54] God while there is yet time to come yes
[38:57] you can make a turn yes you can make a
[38:59] change you say brother Simon I'm already
[39:01] living a good life wonderful life but
[39:04] except a man be born again he shall in
[39:07] no wise enter the kingdom of heaven I
[39:10] call you to repentance I called you to a
[39:14] place where you will bow your heart in
[39:17] your head and privately personally ask
[39:20] God dear God forgive help me Lord amen
[39:26] my friends this whole thing is headed to
[39:30] destruction and now is your day of
[39:33] escape turn to God while there is yet
[39:36] time to turn to Him come to him now now
[39:42] we know the nations of this world have
[39:44] spurned God's love mercy and His grace
[39:48] and we find out that many mothers allow
[39:56] their children to hang out on the
[39:59] streets at night running the streets
[40:06] hanging out in various corners going and
[40:11] drinking in bars or in hotels and even
[40:16] if they're not of that age they will get
[40:20] someone to get it for them and they're
[40:22] behind some bushes or or they'll find
[40:25] someplace under a bridge of somewhere
[40:27] else and I'm not here to advertise but
[40:30] that's the way that we see it being done
[40:33] and they'll have Bush parties and
[40:36] everything else where every perverted
[40:39] evil thing goes on and they there they
[40:44] are but that's that's not only something
[40:48] I want to speak about that's going on in
[40:50] the world it's going on even a mouse
[40:53] church people mothers who claim their
[40:57] Christian Mother's Christian father's
[41:00] Christian parents and that sort of thing
[41:03] is allowed to go on my friends I want to
[41:08] tell you we are living in the closing
[41:11] days of time oh we are living in this
[41:16] day of desperation and perversion that
[41:19] is here in the world today and we find a
[41:24] lot of mothers don't even know where
[41:26] their children are I believe years ago
[41:29] there was an ad and it ended always
[41:32] ended with these words and now it is
[41:35] midnight do you know where your children
[41:38] are I want to ask that question do you
[41:43] know where your children are do you know
[41:46] what they're doing
[41:47] what what they're doing with their lives
[41:50] would even you know with where they are
[41:53] where is the motherhood where's the love
[41:56] we just bring them into the world and
[41:58] allow them to just run around as they
[42:02] please and wildly and some some some
[42:05] mothers are more fearful of their
[42:08] children than their children having
[42:10] respect for them oh it's shocking it's
[42:15] really shocking the Bliss
[42:19] where we have a pandemic of juvenile
[42:25] delinquency but if juvenile delinquency
[42:30] is brought on first of all by parental
[42:34] delinquency it is the parental
[42:37] delinquency that caused the juvenile
[42:40] delinquency may God help us today that
[42:44] we may be able to pull ourselves out of
[42:46] that by the grace of God and for you to
[42:49] do that mother you will need to take
[42:54] those beer cans or the cans of beer that
[42:59] you have in your refrigerator when your
[43:03] mother or your father you're listening
[43:04] to me you need to pull out those beer
[43:09] cans out of that refrigerator and not
[43:13] pass on that type of example to your
[43:17] child now I'm a preacher so I've got to
[43:20] tell you the truth I've got to tell you
[43:22] the Word of God what you choose to do is
[43:24] entirely up to you but I must speak what
[43:28] the Word of God is saying that we must
[43:31] live clean holy lines before the
[43:36] presence of the Living God be ye holy as
[43:39] I am holy saith the Lord
[43:41] yes sir that's the truth what I'm
[43:44] talking about we need to get all the
[43:46] cards off of the table we need to get
[43:49] all of the dice
[43:51] and the casino light atmosphere out of
[43:54] the house we need to get rid of all this
[43:58] bingo spirit real motherhood goes beyond
[44:04] such things my friends it's time you
[44:07] begin to call your children at the end
[44:10] of the day before you tuck them into bed
[44:14] shailen prayer before they leave in the
[44:17] morning to go to school pray for their
[44:20] safety pray for their protection pray
[44:23] for their wisdom pray that God will open
[44:26] up their understanding if they appear to
[44:29] be a little lag
[44:30] your slaw it's not to berate them but to
[44:33] prey on us God to help your child that
[44:37] is the love of a darling mother that
[44:40] will reach out to help her offspring and
[44:43] be a blessing wherever I believe that is
[44:46] exactly what we need here today many
[44:50] so-called
[44:51] mothers and fathers let their daughter
[44:56] stay out all night long
[45:00] stay out with some cigarette smoking
[45:04] rascal whiskey drinking Brasco up there
[45:11] oh yeah he may be slick well-dressed
[45:14] well maybe even have some money still a
[45:17] rascal and allowed their daughter to be
[45:22] up there all night and come home in the
[45:25] morning half dress Harvard or not and
[45:32] then you as a mother or a father call
[45:36] yourself a Christian oh god help us Lord
[45:40] think about it mothers do you know where
[45:46] your children are parents do you know
[45:49] where your children are
[45:51] I want to thank God for real motherhood
[45:55] I want to thank God for real housewives
[45:58] I want to thank God for real women in
[46:03] whatever capacity position or position
[46:08] that they are in I'm thanking God for
[46:13] both young mothers and older mothers
[46:19] take God than a vestige or a small part
[46:25] a sliver of real motherhood still exists
[46:29] in this world to me and it gives us hope
[46:33] to continue preaching the Word of God
[46:37] declaring the promise of God in this
[46:40] dark name that many may hear
[46:43] and contoured knowledge of Jesus Christ
[46:46] thank God for motherhood in our society
[46:50] today and I want to wish all real
[46:53] mothers happy Mother's Day to all of you
