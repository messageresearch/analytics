and teaching may the Lord Jesus Christ receive all the glory and the praise blessed be his holy name we are gathered together to partake of the Lord's Supper this we do in remembrance of him as we have been commanded and as the Apostles also practiced made a great holy spirit bless us all let us pray before we read our scripture our gracious Heavenly Father we thank thee for thy word we asked the blessing upon this congregation we ask your blessing upon your called out ones we call your blessing upon the glorious Assembly of God the firstborn from on high take all your glory Lord and speak to your children in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen reading from 1st Corinthians chapter 11 verses 23 to 25 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this know ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me now brothers and sisters we are here to talk about the Lord's Supper and together around the Lord's table of course the Lord's Supper tells us a wonderful story it is the story of redemption that we can see in the emblems that the Lord Himself gave to us that whenever we look at them whenever we partake of them whenever we are together in fellowship we do this in remembrance of him because it tells us the story of how a savior came from glory came and died upon the Calvary's cross how he purchased our attention it tells the story these very emblems tell the story if we have the mind and the instruction of God to understand these emblems also point to the person of this story and that person is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ for he is the center of all things he is the wheel in the middle of the wheel he is the one that controls all things and he is the beginning he is the ending he is the same yesterday today and forever he is all in all and the entire story of redemption it just centers around here as he is the central figure of this entire story and the Lord's Supper speaks of him the Lord's Supper also my brother sisters reveals the bride as the purpose of the story why did Jesus come why did he leave this ivory palaces of glory to come the sinful earth what was his mission what was his the purpose of him fulfilling the word it was that he might come and redeem his bride who were in the devil's pawn shop of sin and so the bride is the purpose that made him live the glory of heaven and come into the sin cursed world for you and I I am so happy today that this Savior blessed Jesus this great Redeemer thought about us and came to redeem us his precious blood hallelujah glory to God amen these big limbs points to this great time of the calling out of the bride we are taking the Lord's Supper and as we take it may we meditate upon these things how this we are how privileged we are who on earth we are then the king will come to save Biggers bidders apparently beggars slaves apparently slaves my brothers but underneath that exterior their lives within the human body of chosen one part of the body of Christ the bride of Jesus Christ that called out once the ecclesia of God the real New Jerusalem the bride Church of the Living God in the last day for whom he shed his blood or the father plan to save your bed died and now the Holy Spirit is here executing the plan to bring forth as I say to you now this Lord's Supper also points to the consummation of this story what a beautiful ending story a what a story of love and redemption how the Prince of glory came to redeem a captive bride and to take her out from the prison doors the prisons and the walls of sin and to bring her out and take her back to his father's house for in my father's house there are many mansions and so we see this this this story has a beautiful ending where the bride and the bridegroom the prince of life and his wife the story ends with them living happily ever after within the millennial kingdom of God and after that into the eternity you never end the eternities way beyond tomorrow in the very presence of Almighty God oh what a day what an hour I live for the great hour of the manifestation of the fullness of the word and therefore when we come for this Lord supper we do not come with sadness we do not come with weeping and wailing but we come to have a celebration oh this Lord's Supper is a celebration of his life and of ours his life in us we celebrate this fact that God has come to take his home and his Dominion within our hearts and life aren't you happy aren't you glad that out of a 1 in a million he called you out of the miry clay when a million people perished under the throes of sin Satan and suffering at the same time he brought you out and he unveiled you that you are part of him and actually you are a part of him revealed Oh fake Spirit of God whoa for this marvelous and wonderful deposit this gift that was given to us from before the foundation of the world and because it's eternal in us we can never time for he that liveth and believeth on me shall never die takes me to God hallelujah may the spirit of Almighty God live in our hearts no and forevermore this is a great celebration we are here for the Lord's Supper this is a festival a festival a feast praise the Lord that we are here for we are not here to fast I said we are not here to fast but we are here to feast and when we eat the bread and we drink the wine we think of the supernatural spiritual feast now upon the revealed Word of God and equipment power of the Spirit of God that comes upon that word and makes it live again and that places us also at the great supper time we shall have in heaven with all the saints of all the ages o blessed be the name of the Lord Most High Florida God so we are here for a festival oh praise God we are here for a feast and not for a fast may God help you to feast upon this fact upon this word of God here today and me your sin so rejoice in him the Lord God your Savior as merry soul rejoice in the Lord praise his marvelous and wonderful name this Lord supper is also a sacrifice but not because it's a sacrifice where we see him hanging on the cross playing of the cross being pierced on the cross being much scuffed up spot upon why he was on the cross but we have it our open eyes can now see the dot which appeared because remember my brother sister let this symbol my friends we see here this symbol of the sacrificial symbol following all the substitutes until him hanging on the rear as the reality upon the cross to the true believer with open eyes we see as a scene of joy we see it as a scene of victory the Lord's Supper represents his victory his glorious victory in his love the vying for us don't bring us back to himself for God wasn't Christ redeeming the world on to himself glory be to God forevermore hallelujah amen thanks be to God yes sir we know that bliss Lord's Supper also is not a symbol of shame for hanging on the cross in the time of Israel back there back in the old days my friends was a sign of shame it was a sign of being a criminal and a cast from society one that was rejected they were not realizing they were rejecting the chief Cornerstone they were rejecting the Keystone they were rejecting the foundation stone they were for rejecting the capstone whoa praise God the glorious stone that God said I'll lay in Zion a cornerstone a beautiful stone and Jesus Christ is that stone that rock of all ages that ever-present what rock that gives us ever living water life-giving water for the soul of the true believer so this penny on the cross this Lord suffered to us is not a symbol of shame but a great symbol of glory hallelujah it's a symbol of glory it's a glorious symbol praise God hallelujah can you see it it's not shame but its glory praise God hallelujah Lord of God amen so when we look we don't just see punishment punishment on that cross we don't just see that yes yes oh praise God hallelujah according to Isaiah how that the Lord had placed upon him the iniquity of us all and Isaiah said the Lord struck him Amen God struck him he bore our sins God stricken but we do not see just the fact that God struck him and he took the punishment but we see our glorious relief a release because the day he was punished that was the day we were set free for he became poor that we may become rich he becomes sin that we may become the righteousness of God hallelujah oh he went to a devil's hell that we might avoid that praise God he took her place at Calvary so that justice may be able to be fulfilled and the wrath of God can pass over you and I and we can come into the boldly before the throne of God under the blood of Christ in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ set free by this great thing that happened upon go gatos hill so the Lord's Supper is more than just seeing brand and the way but it seems a revelation the understanding behind the symbolism of the bread and wine the Lord's Supper hallelujah praise God we see it with our own eyes and realize that is not just seeing the punishment but seeing that precious one that set us free by his precious blood praise God our eyes have been opened of your ways been opened my eyes have been open I believe that our eyes have been open by the revelation of God we have accepted the dopping of the ice-sub across our eyes my prophetic hands that is open our eyes to recognize the Word of God for there are and for this day whether our praise God hallelujah Oh may we look at him hanging on the cross and let me say this we do not only see punishment but we see atonement we see that we come back to pan at one met with God we have come back to oneness with God hallelujah plural in God God and I walking down with life's Road together walking in a fellowship in union once again like he did with Adam and Eve when he came down at the evening time at the cool of the day to have fellowship with them and here at the end of the world hearing comes and can the mighty God in Christ don't have fellowship with his beloved sons our daughters here in the evening time once again this is evening time its leader than your sink and God keeps all of his appointments and here he descends by the opening of seven seals and presents himself to his people that we might recognize that we are a redeemed people we are Atonement of people that have received a torment and we have come back into reconciliation with God the fellowship that was broken has been restored our joy of salvation has been restored our union with him has been restored how happy can we be to recognize the shining of this heaviness sunshine in the dark conference of our souls and bring us light at the may become children of the light to walk no more in darkness of an ignorance but having in us the light of Life brings God hallelujah for in us God has place a tabernacle for the Sun Oh glory God who resides and is resident within the hearts of the true believer thanks be to God hallelujah amen this Lord supper also is symbolic and points to the bond of brotherhood of all believers of all time all nations all places of all ages one loaf one cup one God one baptism one one one one less praise clock the unity of God's people in him knowing that he is in us and we are in Him praise God hallelujah the great revelation of the mystery of God that brings us place where we can say like pub oh I wish I could make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery what is the revelation what is the fellowship that this revelation of the mystery of God gets to us it brings us into an invisible union with Christ and with each other and Prescott we have communion with him and we also have communion with each other the fellowship of all the saints of all the ages don't you think the scripture is real where Paul said we are in compassed with my friends a cloud a great cloud of witnesses don't you think when we come together to celebrate and to have a festival of the Lord's Supper that they are observing and watching what we are doing and are happy and rejoicing in heaven that they've got the revelation of the last prophets message they've got the revelation of who Jesus Christ is this the revelation of the truth water baptism this caught the revelation of the opening of the word the calling out of their names they have caught the revelation of the things that are going to be and they're fully aware of the modern offense of causing them to look up for ridiculousness or to recognize modern events being made clear by the vindicated prophecy of the Son of God that he sent as his messenger in this age and in this hour praise the Lord so when we come to the Lord's table let us be conscious and aware we are not alone but we are in compass' by this in narubu host this grit of this great cloud of witnesses oh please God that our rejoicing along with us and we are in fellowship with those sins according to the Word of God shall I read now which up of Revelation chapter 19 verses 5 to 9 and the voice came out of the throne saying praise our God all his servants and ye that fear him books small and great and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of many thunderings mighty thunderings saying alleluia alleluia for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor unto Him where the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife has made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and wait for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints and he said unto me write blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he said unto me these are the true sayings of God hallelujah thanks be to God for being called to the marriage supper of the lamb of which this here's only a prefigure of that which is to come the Lord's Supper that we partake off praise God Oh hallelujah prefigures the marriage supper that is to come great supper of the Lamb praise God so this communion this great fellowship will come to its fullness when we are together again in our father's house now the family of God is scattered here and there plus 1 some writer says but Lord we love them there and wherever they are we love them dearly Oh God we're whichever the so-called pastor denomination church group wherever they are with no salvation it's not a mass event but it is an individual of fear of God speaking to our hearts and our prayer to bathe our work and our mission our zeal and our desire is to find our brothers and sisters your loved ones your hipbones your chosen ones wherever they are father and bring them pretension of your work so that we can go together and meet again in our father's house meet them in the morning by the eastern gate where there will be rejoicing and praising the Lord hallelujah then brother sister we know them with all these truths that the Lord's Supper is a solemn affair it's joyful but it's something Supper and solemn and this observance of the Lord's Supper is not based on the matter of our moves on any certain day well I I have a bad mood I don't feel like taking the Lord's Supper today or I am not feeling well and that happened in my life so today I'm going to take a pass it's not the casual affair you're identifying yourself at Christ regardless of how you feel how you your body feels your mind feels your spirit filled it has nothing to do with your moods or your condition because he can make you whole in every area and every part of your life if you come to him and turn your life completely to him and recognize what these symbols here represents my friends the Lord's Supper is not based upon emotions though it has a lot of emotions in it it is not based as I've said afore upon our feelings or upon our mood but it is based upon their obedience in the worst of Word of God for the Lord Himself has sent unto us this do in remembrance of me so it is a commend it is friends something we must do in obedience to him it is our Christian duty to obey the Word of God it is also a privilege for by doing this but coming to the Lord's Supper you are pointing symbolizing prophetically that you are one that will be sitting at the Lord's table oh praise God in eternity 'he's to come partaking of the marriage supper of the lamb or what a privilege my friends blessed are you to hear the words of this book this is are your ears blessed by the eyes to hear and to see and to know him in the power of his record resurrection glory to God hallelujah I want to send you my brother and sisters if your covenant of commitment and of consecration has been broken you may renew it now as the scripture has said Letterman or a woman examine themselves and let them drink it's a counting time take account of yourself take stock of yourself people of God children of the Lord my brothers and sisters wherever you are take account of yourself search your hearts and if you are not certain of your memory of of your ability to set your own heart say search me O Lord and see if there be any wicked way in me O Lord and set me free let this be a prayer praise God hallelujah the Lord's Supper is also a reminder that if we forgotten let us remember that the Lord's Supper is a is the seal of the order covenant of grace that God has given unto us you know it natural life the use and purpose of a seal if you have ever dealt with a lawyer a notary public and you have to have some official document with you and they were the place they are seized on it you realize that the use and purpose of a a seal an official seal is to attest to the truth of the matter it is to certify the valley validity or praise god of that will it is to make you sure and certain of the reliability of all that is written or said by the document praise God hallelujah and that seal is always fixed to the document and thank God that the Holy Spirit the white horse rider rides upon the Word of God and some seal is fixed a man upon the document of the word of the Living God hallelujah amen yes sir so the symbol of this seal of the bread and of the Wayne the symbol of the blood of this sacrifice brothers and sisters is to remind us don't you worry about anything the price of the mortgage fight her family home before your father left or died and went away or Florida God he made sure before he died and went away that he left a lawyer that can give you a document sealed with seven seals and that the seals would attest but validate would vindicate my friends it will let you know for sure that you are a beneficiary and that the mortgage for your mansion or heaven your father's house was paid for before he left here praise God so the father is showing to us that his word is valid hallelujah and is a witness the seal is a witness to his past sacrifice and all of his live that he lived in the bits of health to bring out the souls that were imprisoned then old Lord and God hallelujah and so my friends we see let the seal that it is to remind us that he purchased the home and it burst Jesus lived in it I has left it for his beloved guests loved ones as any father would do glory to God hallelujah amen so the Lord's Supper is an assurance a blessed assurance to us that the debt is paid the mortgage is paid and speaks of his purchase of our Redemption praise God hallelujah not only of our heavenly home but he paid the mortgage for this person this body this house oh praise God we redeemed by the purchase but and purchased by the blood of Christ and we are his purchased possession so let us celebrate the Lord's Supper amen by faith in our hope of glory I said by our fate in our hope of glory praise God hallelujah amen so here we are as I'm about to merge from this little sermon and talk into having performing the Lord's Supper the bread and the wine may we prepare our hearts and prepare our minds hallelujah brothers and sisters I thank God that this lets us know that we are living under God's rainbow promised hallelujah amen God's multicolored rainbow promise we
