[0:23] to be gathered in the name of the lord
[0:27] it has been indeed a very eventful
[0:32] first part of the week
[0:36] we must encourage you by the grace of
[0:38] god
[0:40] to pray for one of our precious
[0:44] brothers that is preaching the word of
[0:48] god
[0:50] in this of this wonderful message
[0:54] on the island of jamaica
[0:57] that has been imprisoned
[1:02] build out of prison now
[1:05] um free
[1:09] taken right out of his pulpit
[1:12] placed in the jail and then
[1:16] the saints bailed him out
[1:20] and now he has to wait for trial
[1:24] on friday i would like to encourage you
[1:29] in the name of the lord to be in prayer
[1:33] for our precious brother
[1:36] asking the lord to give him words of
[1:40] inspiration
[1:41] direction wisdom protection
[1:45] and that god will overshadow
[1:48] the judge and give
[1:51] the wisdom of solomon that we might have
[1:55] just fair judgment
[1:58] by god's great purp to fulfill god's
[2:01] great purpose
[2:03] that his will may be done
[2:06] and the work of god continues
[2:10] and the message is growing and expanding
[2:13] everywhere
[2:15] and our faith is rising to a greater and
[2:19] higher height
[2:20] and we thank god and praise him
[2:24] for this last day as we see the
[2:28] message on a divine ascent
[2:32] upwards onwards may we ever go
[2:37] until we step right into the realms of
[2:40] glory
[2:41] but while we still we are still here
[2:45] let us watch wait work
[2:48] and let us give glory to god
[2:51] and honor to his marvelous name
[2:55] just to remind you this
[2:59] sunday is considered
[3:02] in a world as father's day
[3:06] for the christian every day is father's
[3:08] day mother's day christmas day
[3:11] and easter too but
[3:14] since it is considered that
[3:18] we would like to speak along those lines
[3:22] of fatherhood and what it takes to be a
[3:26] father
[3:27] and may god grant us inspiration
[3:30] to speak along those lines
[3:34] in these troubled times of mixed
[3:37] messages and misinformation
[3:42] my friend may the holy spirit direct us
[3:46] to the word
[3:47] amen i'd i would also
[3:51] love to make a local announcement
[3:56] to our local church here
[4:00] in burlington in ontario
[4:04] canada that our church
[4:07] will be partially reopened
[4:11] for service next
[4:15] sunday sunday the 27th
[4:19] partial reopening
[4:23] the deacons and the deacons in
[4:26] particular
[4:28] will deal with this matter and
[4:31] will alert those who
[4:35] will have the freedom to attend for all
[4:37] cannot
[4:38] attend because of the 15
[4:43] restrictions that we have upon us
[4:46] but we are anxious we are rearing the
[4:49] goal
[4:50] we want to be together with the saints
[4:52] of god
[4:53] lifting up holy hands without wrath and
[4:56] without doubting
[4:58] giving praise and glory and honor to his
[5:01] name
[5:02] amen but now we are
[5:06] in the church ages we
[5:09] are in the study of god's word
[5:12] we are in the reception of truth
[5:15] and we are rejoicing here today
[5:19] our topic for today
[5:22] directly from the word of god is found
[5:26] in revelation
[5:27] chapter 2 verse 17.
[5:32] and we will uh say take for uh
[5:35] a theme the overcomers
[5:40] reward now
[5:43] let us read a scripture in revelation
[5:46] chapter 2 verse 17.
[5:52] he that had an ear to hear
[5:57] let him hear what the spirit
[6:01] said unto the churches
[6:04] to him that overcome it will i
[6:08] give to eat of the hidden
[6:11] manner and will give him
[6:15] a white stone and in the stone
[6:20] a new name written
[6:23] which no man knew it saving
[6:27] he that received it
[6:30] praise god righteous
[6:34] father once again
[6:39] we are privileged to approach you
[6:43] at this great in the throne room of
[6:46] prayer
[6:48] of mercy and grace
[6:51] and we have this privilege
[6:56] by the shed blood of our lord jesus
[7:00] and we thank you for this
[7:03] now father as we gather together in your
[7:06] name with
[7:07] partial human understanding
[7:11] forgive our frailties forgive our
[7:14] humanity
[7:16] and may the great holy spirit empower us
[7:19] and enable us that we might lord
[7:23] take the the portion of the word that
[7:26] is before us uh many
[7:30] have read these church age books
[7:33] but none of us if we think we
[7:37] know it or we read it before
[7:40] we know really nothing about it
[7:43] until you will take your word and speak
[7:45] to us
[7:47] so whatever father no matter how many
[7:50] years i might have read and reread it or
[7:54] anyone
[7:55] might have read it yet we account
[7:58] ourselves as knowing
[8:00] nothing unless you would speak to us
[8:02] again
[8:04] and so we want to receive this fraud
[8:06] father fresh
[8:08] from your precious presence and you take
[8:11] the glory honor and praise father
[8:14] in the name of jesus christ amen
[8:19] amen praise god
[8:24] hallelujah he
[8:27] that hat an ear to hear
[8:30] let him or her hear the word of god
[8:33] today
[8:35] may the holy spirit speak to us
[8:38] from the word
[8:41] now we know that each message
[8:45] to each age
[8:48] god always holds a carrot
[8:52] an incentive in front
[8:55] of believers to keep
[8:59] believers going to keep the saints of
[9:02] god
[9:03] always spurred on to come
[9:07] to fulfill his will and to carry out
[9:11] his word now the incentive of
[9:15] this age for the believer
[9:18] god is now presenting that to us
[9:22] the overcomers reward
[9:25] like anyone that will run in a race
[9:29] that will box in a ring anyone
[9:32] that will will take part in any sport
[9:37] they are looking forward to the
[9:40] victor's crown the overcomers
[9:44] reward now friends the scripture
[9:48] tells us hallelujah
[9:52] that uh this is what
[9:56] spurs the believer on
[9:59] we may use the word encourages the
[10:02] believer just strive to
[10:05] press the the battle to to
[10:08] go on with the lord to
[10:11] be an overcomer
[10:14] in all aspects of life whether in
[10:18] personal life
[10:19] church life whether it's since civilian
[10:22] life social life
[10:23] we want to be overcomers in the
[10:26] expression
[10:28] of the life of god in us
[10:31] and so we find that
[10:35] god offers a reward to every age
[10:40] and to every believer that will
[10:44] fight the battle stand firm with the
[10:48] word
[10:49] only believing the promise for your age
[10:54] and so a promise or a reward
[10:58] was made for this age
[11:02] and this age in this age
[11:05] the holy spirit promises
[11:09] the great reward an incentive
[11:12] to overcoming believers
[11:15] and he mentions two of these
[11:19] rewards first the hidden manner
[11:24] and secondly the
[11:28] white stone now we can make it
[11:31] three but it's mentioned so two
[11:34] hidden manner and the white stone for
[11:38] in the white stone is hidden
[11:41] a new name and that new name
[11:45] will only be known to the
[11:48] person who receives it
[11:51] because every heart knows its own joy
[11:54] the joy of salvation
[11:57] and none can intermittent
[12:00] with the joy that is in the heart of the
[12:04] true believer
[12:05] when they are recognized there made
[12:09] into a new creation a word creation
[12:13] brand new people men and
[12:17] women young people
[12:20] children changed by the power of god
[12:24] oh praise this marvelous name
[12:27] thank god and so god promises
[12:31] us hidden manna
[12:34] and this white stone
[12:37] god in in these two things
[12:41] let me touch a few things here god
[12:45] is giving us insight into the fact
[12:49] that once we have come in to his grace
[12:54] we will be having a
[12:57] constant continuous uninterrupted
[13:02] flow of revelation by the holy spirit
[13:07] once you are broken into this realm
[13:10] once the door opens once the portals
[13:15] to god's revealed truth
[13:18] once this dimension is
[13:21] open to you and you step into it
[13:25] you are now come into a time
[13:29] of a continuous flow
[13:32] of divine revelation hallelujah
[13:37] praise god secondly
[13:40] these two rewards is telling us
[13:45] that we from this moment
[13:49] we are not guilty
[13:52] because we have received forgiveness
[13:56] and cleansing by the blood of jesus
[13:59] christ
[14:00] we also have no condemnation within our
[14:03] hearts
[14:05] amen because we
[14:08] have allowed ourselves to be
[14:12] judged by the word amen
[14:16] as jesus himself said if you are
[14:20] allow yourself to be judged you will not
[14:22] be judged
[14:23] praise god you won't have to go into the
[14:26] white throne
[14:27] judgment amen because you allow yourself
[14:31] to be judged here
[14:33] on earth by the same word
[14:36] that is going to judge them amen
[14:40] back there ahead of time
[14:43] when god judges men and women
[14:47] for their sins done within this body
[14:51] now to illustrate you know in the old
[14:55] days the
[14:56] roman judges had a way
[14:59] of bringing forth judgment
[15:03] and their way was to have a
[15:07] pile of white stones on their desk
[15:11] and a pile of black stones on their desk
[15:16] and depending on the guilt
[15:19] or innocence or pardon for the person
[15:23] that is before them
[15:26] the judge will then
[15:29] call the one that is before him
[15:32] and give him a stone
[15:36] if the person is guilty then receive a
[15:39] stole
[15:39] a black stone which is a stone of
[15:43] guilt and a blackness of death
[15:47] then if the person is innocent
[15:50] he'll give them a white stone
[15:54] meaning that they are not guilty
[15:58] they are justified meaning that they are
[16:01] now
[16:02] free to go they are free praise god
[16:05] hallelujah
[16:07] and that there are accounted righteous
[16:10] in other words it's not on your record
[16:13] it's not even in the record anymore
[16:17] and nowhere on the earth can anyone uh
[16:22] bring that against you you were up
[16:24] before a judge or you were in jail or
[16:26] you were this
[16:27] no the scripture tells us here
[16:31] that the true believer has been judged
[16:34] not guilty amen not just
[16:38] pardoned but not guilty and
[16:41] justified by the grace of god
[16:44] not dwelling on this but it also
[16:49] speaks to us that we
[16:52] will we are given a new
[16:56] character a new expression of ourselves
[17:00] a new life a new manifestation
[17:04] of our walk with god and so here we see
[17:08] it friends
[17:09] we have a new character for real
[17:12] recognizes
[17:14] that our character is what paul spoke
[17:17] about
[17:18] he says it is not i that live here
[17:22] anymore not i that live
[17:25] but christ the word that lives within me
[17:29] and that's what has happened to us it is
[17:33] not i that live
[17:34] it is not you that live amen
[17:37] but the word is finding expression in
[17:40] you
[17:41] and through you and it's the word jesus
[17:44] christ
[17:44] that is living in us today hallelujah
[17:48] praise god forevermore amen
[17:51] praise god now friends receiving the
[17:55] word
[17:57] is greater than even receiving any
[18:00] vision
[18:02] and i want you to know
[18:05] the bible tells us how that we will be
[18:09] caught up
[18:10] and so shall we ever be
[18:14] with the lord but i want you to know
[18:17] that caught up being caught up is not
[18:20] something that is going to happen
[18:24] down the road somewhere that is
[18:28] when it comes to its culmination or its
[18:31] fullness
[18:33] amen that's the end point of it the
[18:36] literal
[18:37] physical caught up but by the
[18:41] revelation of this word of god
[18:44] to you you are already
[18:47] caught up and being caught up
[18:50] amen into the presence of the living god
[18:55] because right now you're being caught up
[18:58] into heavenly places
[19:01] amen in christ amen
[19:04] you're being caught up in the heavenly
[19:06] place
[19:07] of recognizing who you are
[19:11] where you come from your journey of life
[19:14] amen and where you are going that's a
[19:18] heavenly place
[19:19] and you're already being caught up
[19:21] you're being caught up by seeing these
[19:24] revelations
[19:25] of justification amen
[19:29] you never did it in the first place and
[19:32] many others but that's not our topic for
[19:34] today
[19:35] but just to show you that we are
[19:38] in the very process now we are
[19:42] in the rapture process we are in the
[19:45] caught up
[19:45] process we are in the resurrection
[19:48] restoration
[19:49] process right now the holy
[19:52] spirit with the divine convergence
[19:56] is bringing everything to its fullness
[19:59] glory to god
[20:00] hallelujah and he has placed us in a
[20:03] position
[20:04] as receptors amen of his righteousness
[20:08] of his peace of his goodness and of his
[20:11] resurrection and rapture power that is
[20:14] catching us
[20:15] up into the presence of the living god
[20:18] amen hallelujah now we know
[20:22] the bible tells us revelation 1
[20:26] i john was on the isle of patmos
[20:32] and there on the isle of patmos where
[20:35] there were snakes
[20:36] where there were scorpions like a
[20:38] believer in a world full of trouble and
[20:41] trial
[20:42] but while you are on that island your
[20:45] own personal trials and your own
[20:48] personal problems
[20:50] john said that was going on around me
[20:53] what kind of snake serpents everything
[20:56] else trying to bite me and sting me
[20:58] but in the middle of that i was
[21:02] caught up in the spirit on the lord's
[21:05] day
[21:05] glory to god of course that doesn't mean
[21:08] saturday
[21:09] that means god's day the lord's day
[21:13] hallelujah amen but he was
[21:17] caught up in the spirit
[21:20] of the in the of the lord's day amen
[21:23] and i thank god that that same
[21:26] spirit of revelation
[21:29] that caught up john and took him up
[21:33] to see all the unfolding of the word
[21:37] to the very ending of the age of
[21:40] man my friends that's the same
[21:44] spirit of revelation
[21:47] amen john type in the bride that now
[21:50] has come upon the believers praise god
[21:54] to catch them up by the process
[21:58] of revelation from the word of god
[22:02] caught up into heavenly places
[22:06] in jesus christ amen
[22:09] the revelation that was being made known
[22:12] to john
[22:14] met him raped sometimes mad him cry
[22:17] sometimes
[22:18] mad him laugh sometimes make him feel
[22:21] sad sometimes
[22:22] but he was caught up by the revelation
[22:27] amen
[22:28] and i want to repeat that is
[22:31] what is happening to us right now
[22:34] that's why sometimes we are beside
[22:37] ourselves
[22:38] because of the supernatural
[22:41] operation of the holy spirit in your
[22:44] wine skin
[22:45] the same holy spirit that dropped on
[22:48] john
[22:49] that caught john up amen to look
[22:53] into tomorrow amen the same god
[22:57] is anointing his beloved bride
[23:00] in this hour and he or she that happened
[23:03] here to hear
[23:05] let them hear what the spirit is saying
[23:08] to this age now last
[23:11] sunday i touched on
[23:14] beyond the curtain of time
[23:18] and that is exactly where this
[23:21] revelation is taking us beyond the
[23:25] curtain of time
[23:26] until we step fully over
[23:30] right now we're back and forth having
[23:33] glimpses
[23:34] come back having glimpses back and forth
[23:37] but one day we'll step right into that
[23:40] dimension
[23:41] never to return anymore but to live with
[23:44] him in the eternal ages
[23:46] to come glory to god but in that
[23:50] beyond the curtain of time
[23:54] i told you how brother branham met these
[23:56] multitudes of people
[23:58] in heaven as he was caught up
[24:01] as paul was caught up and so
[24:05] was this messenger caught up and saw
[24:08] multitudes that believed his message
[24:12] crying our precious brother and then
[24:16] when he
[24:16] he spoke about his message
[24:20] and answered the angel of god or the
[24:24] person
[24:24] speaking to him i preached
[24:28] exactly what paul preached
[24:32] and i did not divert in any way
[24:36] from what they preached hallelujah
[24:40] amen oh praise god
[24:43] and oh glory to god
[24:47] and he said i preach exactly
[24:50] what paul preached and the entire
[24:53] multitude
[24:54] shouted we are resting on that
[24:58] oh glory to god hallelujah we are
[25:02] resting on that praise god
[25:06] when once you know that you have
[25:09] received the perfect word
[25:11] amen you have received the fullness
[25:15] the seven course meal from the word of
[25:18] god
[25:19] the totality the fullness
[25:24] of all the seven messengers pouring out
[25:27] the
[25:28] seven thunders of truth through
[25:31] this last messenger amen

[25:42] you come to a place of understanding
[25:46] of patience all the get fruits of the
[25:50] spirit
[25:51] and you can say like those
[25:55] multitudes that were up there in glory
[26:01] we can say we are not there yet
[26:04] but we can say while we are here i am
[26:07] resting on that you can say it again
[26:11] i am resting on that thank
[26:14] god hallelujah amen praise
[26:17] god i believe god has a special reward
[26:22] for all of his messengers that were
[26:25] faithful and discharged their
[26:29] responsibility
[26:30] in preaching the word now those were the
[26:33] seven
[26:34] church age messenger but he's also
[26:36] speaking of
[26:37] every real preacher of this message
[26:41] every man every woman and every child
[26:45] that would testify of this message
[26:48] amen praise the lord hallelujah
[26:52] god has a special reward
[26:55] for you and i as we discharge
[26:59] our responsibility for
[27:02] we have received the revelation
[27:06] i have received it and from the day i
[27:09] received it
[27:12] i began to faithfully preach it without
[27:15] fair
[27:16] favor without any type of
[27:20] financial incentive praise god
[27:24] hallelujah not looking ahead at
[27:27] anything else but looking straight to
[27:29] jesus
[27:30] and i heard it i believe that
[27:34] and i began to preach the word
[27:37] and also to live the word
[27:41] of the living god for we are asked to
[27:44] receive it
[27:46] but and then we're asked to testify of
[27:48] it
[27:49] but then we must also become living
[27:52] voices we must
[27:53] live the word and let our actions
[27:57] speak louder than our voices
[28:01] are our spoken word amen
[28:05] god promises i will
[28:08] give them the hidden manna
[28:12] amen of course mana
[28:16] was angel's food
[28:19] manna was also perfect food for them
[28:24] they just had to eat manna and it was
[28:28] perfect food
[28:30] manna was also a supernatural or
[28:32] miraculous food
[28:34] it was a healing food it was an amazing
[28:39] food for them to eat because they
[28:42] at that manner and was never sick
[28:46] they ate that manna and it was
[28:48] miraculous effects
[28:50] within their natural body and
[28:53] in their march hallelujah
[28:57] the bible doesn't tell us that they got
[29:00] tired or or anything of that nature
[29:04] but just miraculous supernatural
[29:07] health and strength
[29:10] was excluding from them it was
[29:13] pouring into them from the crown of
[29:16] their heads
[29:17] to the soul their feet they were just
[29:20] bursting with health
[29:22] their skin oh their blood
[29:25] clear their their hearts beating
[29:28] with vitality amen and they were able to
[29:33] march and walk all day in the hot sun
[29:36] for 40 years because they were eating
[29:40] angels food amen may god
[29:43] give us strength not to walk in that
[29:46] wilderness
[29:48] but we are in the wilderness of this
[29:50] present world
[29:52] with all kinds are snakes and all kinds
[29:55] of
[29:56] poisonous snakes and all kinds of hot
[29:58] troubles
[29:59] and trials temptations all around us
[30:03] and we are required to be tried and
[30:06] proven
[30:06] in the wilderness by this prop word of
[30:09] god hallelujah
[30:11] on the hunger thirst need everything
[30:14] else
[30:14] just as they did but we are receiving it
[30:18] for
[30:18] our day and for our time
[30:22] amen praise god god's word is
[30:27] always looked upon as bread
[30:30] hidden manna hidden bread
[30:33] given to us perfect bread
[30:36] given to us now man on earth
[30:39] doesn't have a real perfect food
[30:43] they're trying to put together the
[30:45] vitamins
[30:46] that they might have the perfect element
[30:49] and every once in a while they said they
[30:51] discovered
[30:52] the perfect food but the perfect
[30:55] whole food for man is that he
[30:58] should not live by natural bread or
[31:02] things alone but by the word of god
[31:06] hallelujah
[31:07] that feeds his soul that he can grow
[31:10] into the spirit of the living god
[31:13] hallelujah
[31:14] now right after the death
[31:19] of the early church fathers
[31:22] and by that i mean john
[31:26] the revelator being the last
[31:29] apostle that actually died
[31:34] and then some of the other
[31:37] saints that followed him like polycarp
[31:41] and so on we find that after they
[31:45] left the scene
[31:48] nobody seemed to know the
[31:51] exact truth of the word of god
[31:55] like the apostles had
[31:59] and so the devil made sure that he mixed
[32:02] up
[32:02] everything and the truth of god
[32:07] was lost and in short
[32:11] this word this manner
[32:14] seem to become hidden to the people
[32:19] let me repeat seems like the original
[32:22] word
[32:24] the manna that fell under their
[32:26] pentecost to the apostles
[32:30] seem to become hidden to the people
[32:35] so god by revelation
[32:39] giving to every age god allah to the
[32:43] messenger
[32:44] and every age which is every age to
[32:49] israel god's god
[32:52] sent a messenger to us
[32:56] to bring his word and he reveal a
[32:59] portion
[33:00] of that to that messenger
[33:03] until our day when he gave the
[33:07] revelation
[33:09] through the messenger of revelation
[33:13] 10 7 how that the prophet
[33:17] in this last day will come
[33:20] and reveal not some but all
[33:24] of the mysteries and then the lord will
[33:28] come again and i want to say
[33:31] that in each age these
[33:34] messengers receive the word
[33:38] for their age let me express it this way
[33:42] you see for israel
[33:47] they receive fresh manna for
[33:51] each day that they were marching
[33:54] and they could not keep the manna over
[33:57] into a next day
[34:00] but they received fresh manna for each
[34:02] day
[34:04] for us as gentiles
[34:08] god sent a messenger with fresh
[34:12] manga of revelation for each age
[34:16] or each gentile day
[34:21] and for each age god sent fresh hit
[34:24] manna
[34:25] to each gentile
[34:30] revelator or messenger
[34:33] that he sent and as i've said to you
[34:37] in the early church ages on the
[34:39] nickelodeon ism that
[34:41] balaamism and so on a romanism
[34:44] their truth of god was mixed up
[34:48] and the manna seemed to become
[34:51] hidden amen hallelujah
[34:55] but then god promised he would restore
[34:58] the word again
[35:00] and give it to his people amen
[35:04] and so praise god god always does it
[35:07] this way
[35:09] the lord repeat give the bread
[35:12] to the disciples and tell them to
[35:15] distribute
[35:16] it to the multitudes
[35:19] and so is it in this day god gave his
[35:22] word to a messenger
[35:23] who distributed it out to the multitudes
[35:28] preachers men called to be ministers
[35:32] caught the revelation of that word and
[35:34] it is
[35:35] their responsibility now to
[35:38] share that word out to the multitudes
[35:43] that are waiting for the broken bread
[35:47] of the word of god hallelujah
[35:50] we thank god he has opened his treasure
[35:53] house
[35:54] and poured out his word upon us
[35:57] and would not do it for those who reject
[36:00] him
[36:01] and reject his word hallelujah
[36:05] amen so i thank god that what we have
[36:08] received is not
[36:09] some uh rotten stored up
[36:13] in a denomination word but
[36:16] this is the same fresh word
[36:19] that the apostles had that was stored up
[36:22] in the golden pot
[36:25] under the altar of god and the
[36:28] manna stayed fresh one portion stayed
[36:31] fresh
[36:33] hallelujah and only the high priest the
[36:35] priest could go
[36:36] in to get from that pot thank god he had
[36:39] messengers
[36:40] that he allowed to get from that pot and
[36:44] take god
[36:44] he had a messenger a high priest in our
[36:47] age
[36:48] that was able to receive the word for
[36:51] our age
[36:52] and bring it back to us fresh
[36:55] like the day it was sent from the
[36:58] presence
[36:59] of the living god hallelujah amen
[37:03] this does not speak my friend only of us
[37:05] partaking of the word now
[37:08] but it also points to the fact
[37:11] of our future partaking because we will
[37:15] partake of the word
[37:17] now and when we are tr when we translate
[37:21] or when we are brought in raptured in
[37:25] to the literal very presence of the lord
[37:29] we will continue to partake of the
[37:32] knowledge
[37:33] of the word in other words we will still
[37:36] have a thirst
[37:38] to know jesus and more about jesus
[37:43] and we will have all our questions
[37:46] unanswered questions answered while we
[37:49] are there in heaven
[37:51] and we'll be able to talk with him walk
[37:54] with him
[37:56] about queen's justice answered by him
[37:59] through the endless eternal ages
[38:02] our hearts will be filled with joy with
[38:06] the passion presence
[38:08] glory of god as we talk about the lord
[38:13] continuing to eat the word hidden manna
[38:17] hidden in his presence walking with him
[38:21] talking with him on the golden streets
[38:25] by the flowing streams of life
[38:28] revelation hallelujah flowing from the
[38:32] presence of god
[38:34] amen and our hearts rejoicing
[38:37] night and day as we walk with him
[38:40] amen sometimes we think we get to know
[38:44] a little bit of the lord down here
[38:47] and just that little bit that we begin
[38:50] to know
[38:51] about the lord down here causes
[38:54] us to feel so good make us rejoice
[38:59] and shout sometimes cry
[39:02] in the presence of the lord somehow
[39:05] sometimes pull off the road
[39:07] amen and stop by the side of the road
[39:10] before we drive again because the
[39:13] anointing hits us
[39:15] the joy the lord becomes our strength
[39:18] fills our soul and rejoice in him
[39:22] amen but think about the hour
[39:25] when we enter into our eternal partaking
[39:30] of the word of god the knowledge
[39:33] of the lord jesus christ being unveiled
[39:37] to us
[39:38] as we sit in his divine
[39:42] presence and that word think of
[39:45] it we're receiving the little we're
[39:47] receiving in this flesh
[39:49] but one day when this flesh is
[39:52] completely
[39:52] changed by the presence of god and we
[39:56] seated in the presence of the lord and
[39:59] the word
[40:00] is making himself known to us he
[40:03] himself the interpreter of the word the
[40:06] author
[40:07] of the book is making himself known to
[40:10] us and we are receiving that hallelujah
[40:13] and we have no limitations of him of
[40:16] feeling emotion or anything
[40:18] oh praise god you're limitless in
[40:21] everything you do
[40:22] say think whatever and the word is
[40:25] making itself known to us he'll become
[40:28] so
[40:28] real it's beyond anything we might have
[40:31] a dream
[40:32] i have a thought about praise god we
[40:35] might not have thought it possible
[40:37] but praise god it will be because he has
[40:41] promised it
[40:42] in our day thank god he said to the
[40:45] overcomer not only will i give the
[40:49] hidden manner
[40:51] but i'll give him a white stone lord of
[40:54] god
[40:54] and give you some insight into what is
[40:57] the one
[40:58] meaning of receiving
[41:02] that white stone and what it actually
[41:06] means praise god for in that
[41:09] white stone hallelujah
[41:12] is a new name and
[41:15] not to uh expand on that but
[41:19] name nature all that works
[41:22] runs together he'll give you a new
[41:25] name amen a change nature
[41:29] praise god hallelujah you
[41:32] recognize your change nature
[41:35] your change name praise god
[41:38] in other words you recognize who you
[41:40] really
[41:41] are to begin with and who you really
[41:45] are in time lord of god
[41:48] hallelujah we know according to
[41:50] scripture abraham's name was changed
[41:53] abram to abraham say right
[41:56] to sarah jacob his name was changed
[42:00] after
[42:00] testing trial wrestling with god to
[42:04] israel prince with god and you know
[42:08] also simon peter his name was changed to
[42:11] peter
[42:12] and for saul to paul by the grace of god
[42:16] after the great revelation and so with
[42:18] every one of us
[42:20] as the word makes itself known to us
[42:23] hallelujah
[42:24] and so today each one of us
[42:27] true believers have had a change of name
[42:32] praise god amen in other words you've
[42:35] had a change of nature
[42:38] you have a change in your actions your
[42:40] activity
[42:42] your your unconscious responses
[42:45] and reactions being changed you don't
[42:47] know
[42:48] but you know that is repentance it's
[42:51] reception by the blood of christ the
[42:53] forgiveness of god
[42:55] in your whole life that has transformed
[42:57] you
[42:58] and changed you to this hour this moment
[43:01] of time
[43:02] and space that we are living in and now
[43:05] are true we are named christians amen
[43:09] the new name is christians that we have
[43:12] received but that's only a general name
[43:14] but god will grant to you the knowledge
[43:18] of your own individual name
[43:22] amen the name christian is coming to all
[43:24] of us
[43:25] praise god but some future name
[43:28] will be made known to you as the lord
[43:31] makes it clear
[43:32] within your heart and one day we are
[43:35] going to have another change
[43:37] and it's not going to be the one that we
[43:39] just had on earth
[43:41] from from reckon you were once uh
[43:44] acting and living like a sinner
[43:47] to only know that all that time
[43:50] while you thought you were a pig you
[43:52] were not really a pig
[43:54] you are a lamb or a sheep that
[43:57] thought you were a pig amen lord of god
[44:01] you did not change from a pig to a lamb
[44:04] but you were
[44:05] always a lamb but acting and
[44:08] fooling around in a dirt and a mess but
[44:11] you are always a lamb
[44:13] acting like a pig but the power of god
[44:15] and the word make itself clear to you
[44:18] until you recognize who you were and
[44:21] begin the way
[44:22] to live the way that god wants you to
[44:26] live
[44:26] live the way the nature in you
[44:29] wants you to live live the way that your
[44:33] new
[44:33] name your new lifestyle wants you
[44:37] to live amen you certainly
[44:40] will receive a new name with this
[44:44] new change that will come in the future
[44:47] remember i'm separating it you have a
[44:50] change here on earth and you name here
[44:52] on earth
[44:53] but then there's another change the
[44:56] rapture brings another one total
[44:58] deliverance
[44:59] and you receive a new name fully
[45:03] oh praise god i want to quote
[45:06] directly from brother branham amen
[45:10] now friends it could
[45:13] well be that was our true
[45:18] original name
[45:21] that was written in the lamb's book
[45:25] of life from the foundation
[45:30] of the world and he
[45:33] knows that name but we
[45:36] do not now we don't know that name
[45:40] now you see that's blackened from us
[45:43] that's gone from our memories because of
[45:46] sin and being on the earth here but at
[45:50] one day
[45:51] in his good pleasure we
[45:55] will know that new name
[45:58] also praise god for we were the sons and
[46:02] daughters of god
[46:04] praising and worshiping god in his
[46:06] presence
[46:07] and he said it clearly in the book of
[46:09] john the gospel of john
[46:11] i know my sheep and i know them
[46:14] and i call them by their name hallelujah
[46:18] and they know me and they answer me
[46:21] oh praise god hallelujah my friends
[46:25] we can't remember all of that that we
[46:27] were once there
[46:29] and that he knew us and we knew him and
[46:31] he knew our name and we
[46:33] knew our name we can't remember it while
[46:35] we're here
[46:36] but slowly he's bringing our memories
[46:38] back by revelation
[46:40] and by catching up into uh heavenly
[46:43] places in christ
[46:45] bringing us back into familiar places of
[46:47] the world
[46:48] that we might recognize who he is
[46:52] who we are and where we come from
[46:56] for he knows our name oh
[46:59] a white stone how beautiful
[47:03] amen receiving recompense
[47:07] from the presence of god receiving
[47:12] rewards from the hand of god
[47:16] for the trials we have gone through
[47:20] for the testings we have born for the
[47:24] temptations
[47:25] the buffetings the persecutions
[47:29] that we have gone through receiving
[47:33] from the very hand of god
[47:36] the white stone now on earth
[47:40] in the days of crescent time
[47:44] that false church received their rewards
[47:47] here
[47:49] they were given out of the
[47:52] state treasury out of the government's
[47:56] treasury constantine
[47:59] gave them beautiful cathedrals
[48:03] lovely buildings
[48:06] lovely beautiful artistic statues
[48:10] and statuary or statuaries
[48:13] and these statues were usually made
[48:17] of white marble to this day you may go
[48:20] witness some of them
[48:22] made with white marble which were
[48:25] actually roman idols
[48:29] renamed as saints yes my friends
[48:34] and the church's furnishings
[48:38] to this day are exceptionally
[48:41] beautiful indeed and god but god
[48:46] was not with them amen
[48:51] but where was god if he's not in such a
[48:54] beautiful place
[48:55] not in such beautiful places with sun
[48:58] births
[48:59] high altars beautiful dressed
[49:02] priests with wonderful
[49:06] processional grounds and colors and
[49:09] statues statuaries
[49:11] and so on my friends god is not there
[49:14] with them where
[49:15] is he listen tell you god
[49:18] is with his saints some little house
[49:22] meeting
[49:23] somewhere god with his little people
[49:27] fear not little flock it is your
[49:30] father's good pleasure
[49:32] to give you the kingdom he is in some
[49:35] cave
[49:36] where the believers have to hide because
[49:39] the
[49:40] the the religious leaders are the false
[49:43] church will go and report them
[49:46] and call for their persecution but god
[49:50] is
[49:50] watching over his own and protecting his
[49:53] children
[49:54] amen what praise god amen
[49:58] the true church sometimes don't have
[50:00] beautiful buildings
[50:03] the true church don't have those ground
[50:07] choirs dressed up like angels no sir
[50:11] fine clothes the true church doesn't
[50:14] have
[50:15] those wonderful programs and beautiful
[50:18] ceremonies like that my friends
[50:22] they don't have all the fine clothing
[50:25] amen
[50:26] but god has given us a special promise
[50:30] that he has promised to believers that
[50:32] will live for him
[50:34] that he will give them rewards of
[50:37] eternal beauty hallelujah
[50:41] that will not like buildings
[50:45] not one stone will be left upon another
[50:49] but eternal rewards
[50:52] of eternal duration
[50:56] that will never fall apart but will be
[50:59] there forever and forever
[51:03] so let the wealthy look down upon the
[51:06] poor
[51:08] them give their large sums to the
[51:11] churches
[51:13] let them give it to the church knowing
[51:15] full well
[51:17] that they're going to be recognized
[51:19] actually some of them give it to be
[51:21] recognized
[51:23] amen some of them deliberately give it
[51:26] to
[51:27] get the tax breaks from the church
[51:31] just the church has just been used for
[51:34] their own means
[51:36] and so on amen hallelujah
[51:39] yes sir or that they're going to be
[51:42] praised
[51:43] by the priests pope or pastor my god
[51:47] and that's what is happening my friends
[51:50] that they will receive
[51:51] all that and they will have a statue
[51:54] maybe put up in their
[51:55] honor in public so that everybody
[51:59] could recognize their goodness and how
[52:02] they
[52:03] walk amen oh my goodness
[52:06] and so that's what would happen that
[52:09] there would be applauded
[52:10] but someday god promises in his word
[52:14] that he sees and knows everything
[52:18] that we do and we are doing for him
[52:21] hallelujah and that he wants more is
[52:24] going to command us
[52:26] like he commended that widow
[52:29] the woman that gave two mites amen
[52:33] hallelujah and placed it
[52:36] in the church and the pharisees who came
[52:40] with large sums
[52:42] and through it also and jesus said that
[52:46] woman
[52:47] gave more than them all together
[52:50] amen and he said he would reward her
[52:54] and so he will reward us in this hour
[52:58] amen for your all husbands are dead
[53:01] your all denominational husbands are all
[53:04] dead
[53:05] amen and we are now married to this
[53:09] the true revealed word of god for the
[53:12] hour
[53:12] and he has promised that he would reward
[53:15] us
[53:16] with eternal treasures from heaven
[53:20] out of the eternal treasure treasuries
[53:22] of god
[53:24] the great storehouse that god has
[53:27] yes honored blessed
[53:31] rewarded with the hidden manner
[53:35] which has started already within your
[53:38] name
[53:39] which is ready start to phase in
[53:42] itself in a white stone
[53:46] hidden in the revelation how good is the
[53:49] lord
[53:49] to us to reward us so wonderfully
[53:54] and yet we are so undeserving
[53:59] undeserving everything we receive from
[54:02] god
[54:03] we should not go around expecting
[54:05] anything back from him
[54:07] but god by his own grace
[54:10] by his own choosing turns around
[54:13] and blesses us and rewards us
[54:17] amen that we will get ready for this day
[54:20] and for this time
[54:22] and as the bible tells us don't you
[54:25] worry
[54:26] about the laying up of treasures here on
[54:28] earth where mart
[54:29] rust corrupt and destroy
[54:34] but lay up presence for yourself lay up
[54:37] treasures in heaven
[54:39] amen that's where we need to send
[54:42] our investments and our treasures
[54:45] is lay them up in heaven oh praise god
[54:49] may god bless you
[54:50] with this wonderful time of
[54:53] spending in the word of god speaking
[54:56] on this wonderful
[54:59] topic of the overcomers reward
[55:03] may you and i may we together
[55:07] receive the overcomers reward
[55:10] and live the rest of our earthly life
[55:13] with excitement with anticipation
[55:17] and incentive to receive that reward
[55:21] from the hand of the living god may the
[55:24] lord bless you
[55:25] and may you turn around and shake the
[55:28] hands of your brothers and sisters
[55:30] or give them a call encourage somebody
[55:32] tell them how much you
[55:34] love them and the grace of god be with
