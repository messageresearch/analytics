go rejoicing and receiving whatever your need is today God knows about it and he's going to meet that need hallelujah praise God thank you Lord we like you to turn to the scriptures in Hebrews 11: 25 we know we all started a little series um woman in the Bible amen and I just want to just deviate a little bit from that but on the same line I just want to give you a little uh background man of what we were studying the last time recap a little bit amen hallelujah I took you right back to the Book of Genesis the beginning the C chapter where everything was laid down there amen hallelujah praise God just just let a word of prayer before we let just's bow our hearts just's bear with me you know the enemy would love to hinder the word of God Amen but we are Overcomers amen the what what he tries we are already overcome his tactics amen so let us bow Hearts our gracious God and eternal Heavenly Father we thank you Lord that you could bring us into your house this morning Safe Lord where we can come and hear your words of Life break the bread of life to each and every single one this day Lord that they something may be said Lord father that with encourage them that would strengthen them Lord on this life's journey Lord father Lord we ask you to forgive us for all our shortcomings Lord father where we have failed in some way or the other Lord may your precious blood be applied Lord we know God that your spirit is here Lord father say where two or threes are gathered in your name you are in the midst to bless Lord father Lord God we here to feed upon your word Lord to give us strength Lord father may you continue to raise up our dear past this morning Lord father strengthen him Lord father even remember brother Tim Lord father as he's out there in the mission field Lord father bless him Lord father and bless every single one here today Lord father that may be listening into your word Lord father we commit all into your hands for your honor and For Your Glory this we ask in your precious name amen and amen and reading Hebrews 11:25 I believe it is 11:25 amen choosing rather to suffer Affliction speaking about Moses amen so he made a choice he's he made a choice to suffer with the Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season you all may be seated praise God hallelujah sinner pleasure sin is attractive amen sins look good to the the five senses hallelujah amen so I just want to recap a little bit on the lesson that we had a few weeks ago amen from Genesis all right we saw where God made Man In His Image and his likeness amen and God created him male and female he created them Hallelujah you say man was first created as a spirit being not yet as a physical being until expressed in a human body amen amen hallelujah so man was a spirit being first and then God because Man was created in image of God because God is a spirit amen so the first creation of man was in a spirit form and then he formed man from the dust of the earth and breathed the breath of life into him and he became a living soul but when man was in that body he was both male and female and then we see where God separated the feminine part of him and he placed it in an another body amen and call her woman because she came out of Man Simple teaching amen understand amen hallelujah and then we went to Genesis chapter 2 verse 16 and the Lord made a commandment to man man now remember Eve was still part of him when God gave that commandment you got that when God gave the Commandment to Adam he was both male and female so Eve was already was there in him hallelujah praise God and the Commandment was of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat so here there a choice he gave them Choice amen but of the three of the knowledge of Good and Evil thou shall not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thou shall surely die amen so when God makes a a a a law there's a penalty when you break the law and if there isn't a penalty to AOW it there isn't it's not AOW amen you go speeding on the road it says 60 or 50 or whatever the cops stop you you're speeding now there's a penalty attached to that amen you commit a crime you pay the fine or you do the time right Glory you just don't know that the Holy Spirit feeds on the w word so here was a choice you the Bible is in symbolic form right when they say a tree right a a tree in the garden right was actually a person amen but it's in symbol form and the word takes Faith or Revelation to understand the word of God amen without faith or Revelation it's impossible to please God you don't know what to believe am and only God can give you the clear understanding of his word for you to believe amen you Jesus I love to make the gospel as simple as simple as possible so that you can catch it Hallelujah to God be praised thank you Lord you see when you have the Holy Ghost man you need to be fed amen and God the Holy Ghost feeds on the revealed word that's where your strength lies amen you could just read it read it read it and you get nothing from it but it takes Revelation to give you the reason substance that is coming off to give you the strength to give you en encouragement the Assurance brother Mike was just saying you have Blessed Assurance we sing it all is well I said brother Mike like you're going right into the little study here that's the Holy Spirit guiding you and leading you in simple little ways you look for key little key little things that you know that you're are on the right Frack amen and God loves to do that us so to encourage you you know you got all kind of opposition all kind of challenges in your life I know some brothers sitting right here this morning had a hard night a hard week just to be here man ended up in the hospital for hours and hours couldn't understand what is happening men our pastor is not feeling well at home and I don't know what challenges you had this week but you here today youus Hallelujah see the god that we serve is good and he's good all the time he knows what you goes through amen and he's here to encourage you and lift you up amen hallelujah blessed be his holy and wonderful name you see you believe the spirit feeds only and only on the word of God hallelujah and the Bible said so man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God hallelujah so you feed on God's word you you listen to the tapes you read your Bible amen why are so so many weak why are so many so weak man because they do not go to the source of their strength Hallelujah you read your Bible and you pray every day that is the A B Cs of being a strong Christian to overcome the wives of the enemy Hallelujah now we see that sin didn't start here just a earth amen sin began in heaven right Lucifer was kicked out of heaven and cast down to earth Satan as he is known now saw what God was doing by having a family and we understood that God is a family man amen amen hallelujah we all love to have family we all love to have Fellowship amen don't we man you can't be like a as we say as a Onan Island you go and you seclude yourself from everything you're going to be lonely amen hallelujah so God wants Fellowship that's why he created us and placed us here amen hallelujah and we going back to where we had fallen from amen amen hallelujah praise God so you see Satan saw what God was doing and you is a copycat he can't create so he takes what God created and Peres iten you see it all around man man is taking what God created amen and perverting it why all this pollution all this Wars Gunpowder the same vehicle that you're driving it's killing so many more amen hallelujah praise God you see and it's all started from the Garden of Eden Hallelujah he could not create because he's a creation he could not get through by establishing a kingdom in heaven so he seized an opportunity where he could Mar God's creation and he is doing that all the time he wants to destroy your life he come to he wants to Mar you he want to to to to to do all everything to kill you and Destroy You amen hallelujah that's his Statics Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord excuse me so he saw an ceased an opportunity where he can Mar God's plan man you know Satan love worship it started way back in heaven he saw how the Angels were worshiping God and getting god of the great God getting all this worship and praise and everything like that and it entered jealousy entered into him amen and anytime you see somebody jealous you know that Satan in them thank you Jesus they want what you have man Hallelujah the craving for what you have and they'll do all ends to get it and that's exactly what Satan was trying to do amen hallelujah he loves worship even when the Lord himself s was here in flesh he approached the Mighty God in flesh form and say if you could bow if you Bow Down and Worship me I'll give you this got a lot of God a lot he comes to us every time thank you Jesus every time he comes to us he brings glitter glamour amen all around us shiny things amen attractive things amen hallelujah you see that's his tactics from since then and he's continuing right now hallelujah praise God see he wanted worship and that's his main worship and a lot of people worship shiing Satan under the disguise that they're worshiping the true and living Goden the songs they sing amen and all this they're praising Satan and they don't even know it and all these denomination they've been so deceived man that they do not know that they're worshiping Satan Hallelujah but we know who we worship amen we know where we came from amen we know where we going to amen amen hallelujah we worship the only true and living God and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah thank you Lord blessed be his wonderful name Hallelujah then we see s Eve Le leaving from under the headship of her husband amen and when you decide to leave the headship from under under the Holy Spirit or or under the revealed word at this hour amen you're going to end up in trouble you're going to surely end up in trouble because you want to lead your own self or you want somebody else to lead you Hallelujah so we see Eve left from under the headship of her husband and went for a stroll amen she went to explore amen she expose ourselves to the attack of Satan amen hallelujah and when you do that amen hallelujah Satan has a a right to attack you he has a right because you live from Under The Canopy your protection you see when when Satan went and challenge the Lord on job he said I can't touch that man you have a protection around him I can't penetrate that amen but if you only move that amen from around him then I going to get to him but you know some of us we actually leave it and we go out amen we go from under that protection by our own self and there you are exposed to Satan's attack on your life man H it was different with job because the challenge not wasn't between job and Satan and know it between God and Satan and God put put out a challenge to to to to Satan he said do everything you can but don't touch his life do anything you can don't touch his life and he would not curse me God was assured of that seed that was inside of job that he would not deny the word of God Amen could God put that challenge on your life today yes amen that you would not give up you would not giv you would not surrender to the lies that the enemy would would would present to you thank you Hallelujah so we see one day amen the serpent approached that you see he wanted a congregation and the first Sone that ever was preached was in the Garden of Eden so he got Eve to listen because if she was under the protection of her husband he couldn't touch her he couldn't whisper in her ears some Sweet N Things as some of us you know sweet nting a lot of people love to hear sweet nting I know amen oh you're so nice you're so goodlooking oh my the way you're dressed the way you walk the way you talk amen you see Satan is a slimy subtle amen amen hallelujah talk he could talk you into anything but you got to stop and listen and that's where it's that's where it's starts when you stop to listen to his lies and he is not 100% liying know he will take the word of God 99.99999% word and put one little doter lie inside of it how much poon you think going to kill a person man I saw a demonstration on that we had a a a back home men dangerous poison when you put one little drop of that in a whole big container water it turns just like milk you think it's milk gets white like milk you drink that and you'll see what you end up it's so deceptive so deceive just one drop of Asic one drop of that poison it will kill youen That's what Satan does amen hallelujah and that was the Commandment that was given to you the day you partake of that tree amen you're going to surely die amen but you know this slick old talker will come around you man God really didn't mean that you really didn't mean that he's hiding something from you you know your eyes going to be open you're going to be very wise amen you're going to gain knowledge you know you're going to be like the Angels you see he's preventing you from doing something you're going to be this you're going to be that amen very convincing fell man you see he could not appear to Eve as someone with a long tail and two horn and he went to the thing that was closest to the human race amen the thing that would so be deceptive talk like a man reason Like a Man look like a man and very very handsome man very very handsome young ladies young people men and young men young woman amen even the older folks amen Maybe everybody here Satan appears as an angel of Light right brother Desmond as an angel of Light man he looks so sweet you know convincing nice glowing appears like that so the only the the only creature that he could have entered in was the serent was a upright being handsome subtle Sweet Talker amen you could reason excuse me getting very thirsty yesterday amen we're going to get some Water of Life Today hallelujah praise God thank you Lord I don't want to rush am man don't just want to just speed up and just take my time and let it sing if one word one word one word destroyed man in the beginning and one word going to bring you out amen one Revelation hallelujah amen that's how God is God in Simplicity you see Satan make a nice proposition to her amen he was so convincing using the word of God just twisting it a little bit amen man the day that you partake of that the day that you do this amen you know God say you going to die no but you will not die and I always like to put this illustration man one word men not not up the whole human race amen hallelujah in other words he said you want to really be right with God take my advice listen to me God didn't mean that he just didn't when you hear that run for your life run for your life amen you know I've been a test engineer for 10 years amen and I always like to bring this little UST rtion to you I used to test automotives amen Vehicles most any of the vehicles that you see driving here all the different mix and models amen back then I was a test engineer and we would put these vehicles under some severe stress testing we would do corrosion testing and you are God's test piece you are God's test piece know and God is Pro proving you and trying you here and you know the places that we would take those Vehicles a whole vehicle they it was called The Proving Grounds amen so you have to prove that these vehicles are reliable dependable and they can endure the test of time you are here for that God has confidence in you that you going to prove who you really are by the test of time thank you you're going to get some corrosion testing all kind of acidic things going to come across your life amen some pressure testing that's the kind of testing we to do heat and cold testing amen now you only be put into coal you be apply the heat back and forth to see if you're going to last amen and that's how Satan does it man and God allows Satan to test you amen hallelujah amen praise God

you can receive something because every single one of you have a choice here this morning T said brother Chris I hear this thing so much I just shut him off yes this really you know I don't know why you know preach about some mysterious thing about you know this silence in heaven and the Thunders and this and that but you see God is a god of Simplicity the ABCs This is where the Christian walks that all those things are going to come along the road if God wants you to you it is given a Measure of Faith and what is Faith Revelation and if God wants you to know all these mysterious thing you're going to know it but we going to start on New Foundation First a form Foundation Amen Hallelujah Jesus praise God hallelujah oh praise His wonderful name we have to have eternal life in us to be Sons and Daughters of God but when we died to sin we sold out our boat right and cross the chasm and we've beyond the reach of God on the other side of the chasm for in Adam all died amen Hallelujah so from since then to now every single human being that was born was born in sin and shaped in iniquity came into this world speaking lies do you have to teach a child to lie or to steal or anything you come with that n here because due to the Fallen Adam sold us out then but now Christ has brought us us back in we have a way to get back to where we fell from amen the lordship amen all those that were predestinated in him before the foundations of the world Amen God is seeking and calling those back to him amen hallelujah amen so if you hear his voice today Harden not your heart God is calling you amen hallelujah because there is something inside responding to that call that's part of him inside of you so if you feel convicted in your heart today amen that you're not living right you're not doing the right thing God is speaking to your heart today get back to where you fall you fell from amen back before the beginning man hallelujah praise God thank you Lord you see when Adam fa he brought death upon all creation he was given free moral agency he was he had a choice you you might all say but if God knew that Adam would fall why did he create them you know you have asked yourself that question every time somebody could ask you if God knew there was sin if God knew Satan was bad why he creates Satan for see God had a plan before in his mind and he knew what because he God he knew the outcome of when he created and what they going to do because they had a choice Satan had a choice to be good or to be evil amen and you have that same Choice today hallelujah praise God praise God so it was given to them just just as us to make a choice now Adam and Eve in the beginning there was a tree of right and wrong before them and that same tree that sets before each and every one of us you say well it's their fault you say it was Adam fault and I say to you it's your fault now because you have that same choice that Adam and Eve had amen amen don't you amen you on a free more you to choose this day who you going to serve you have that choice you want to be on the road to glory or you want to be on the way to hell and it's a highway not a way a Highway to Hell broad is that way that leads to destruction and many of them are going on that road you want to that bandwagon or you want to join the few that find the way to glory amen see God I don't want to jump ahead God made a choice chose you before the foundations of the W but we went into Amnesia because of the Fall man but God when he flashes his word to you amen just as how Eve was in Adam knew the Commandment of God when she was in spirit form when we were in that form before the foundations of the world when job said when job was asked where were you where the sons of of God saled for Joy amen

face man so so you could recognize who you are amen hallelujah praise God praise God hallelujah you say well it's their fault not now it isn't it's your fault you can't place it on Adam now you've got to place it on yourself because right and wrong is set before you we've on the same basis as Adam and Eve could you say amen amen because it's your choice amen hallelujah but you see when we are redeemed we no more want our own choice amen you see how this word comes man yes you have a choice but yet is not your own choice amen hallelujah we want hisory Choice hallelujah thank you Lord now Adam and Eve wanted their own choice they wanted to find out what it was to have wisdom amen so they probed into it and what did it cause death anything that man probos in causes death you see it all around all around pollution this that yeah everything everything that they probe and open is death the the atomic the bomb the the gunpowder everything death man brings death amen because of their knowledge now when a man has been redeemed he don't care anymore for a scholarship amen hallelujah he doesn't care anymore of the things of the world could you say that love not the world or the things of the world when you love the world and the things of the world you know the love of God is nothing you that's where the test is that's where the test is have a test for water for pure water

you put the love of the world into the word and what you get the world just put it in there w o r l the so when you have the love of the world in you you know where you're at hallelujah thank you Lord he doesn't want anybody to talk to him into where to go and what to do he just no more wants to lead himself do you want the Holy Spirit to lead your life do you want more of him Hallelujah this a serious time we living in you know amen you know man wants their own way and everything right he's so proud to be proud that he he wants to go his way or no way but there's no other way but God's way because he is the truth he's the way he's life amen and not just a few days here on this Earth amen you want a few days here not man you could live it up as you want to know jump up and sing and party and everything you're going to enjoy it for a season but when that time comes you know where you're going man so many so many um um examples here from the prophet that when people leaving this life man and their soul is not right with God Amen you Plunge Into Darkness amen hallelujah praise God he just Waits and finds out the choice of his maker do you want to know what God's plans are for your life the choices that he have for you amen put everything into his hands you might not understand it no it looks strange it looks so weird and funny but when you place your life totally into his hands he will never leave you lead you astray never he will never never he promised that that he'll never lead you astray hallelujah praise God you make him as your you let him be your maker Hallelujah you see man always seek the knowledge to find a better way amen better way of doing things Hallelujah man see now when Adam sinned by heeding to his wife's reasoning instead of holding to God's word that's what made Adam sin his wife reason with Satan and then introduced the product to Adam and Adam rejected the word and sold out man you know Adam wasn't deceived he wasn't deceived he knew exactly what he was entering into he was deceived but in order not to lose his wife he had to enter in because he was demonstrating what Christ was going to do for usen he didn't want to lose his wife men and and the Lord Jesus would not lose his wife amen hallelujah he will do everything that it will take to bring her back into his side just as Eve was taken out of Adam's side Christ the word is bringing us back to his side to join him s and his wife together again hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus Hallelujah blessed be his wonderful name hallelujah thank you Lord praise God so Adam had to enter into the transgression just as Christ had to take our transgression upon himself amen just as it was in the beginning amen Eve was deceived it was blood that caused the fall and without the shedding of blood there is no remission for sin hallelujah amen you want to get a little more in depth into that amen we who are grown up should know what it is amen hallelujah amen what would cause transgression that what would cause ad adultery amen is adultery Eve committed amen she went and live with somebody else husband men hallelujah hallelujah so without the shedding of blood there is no remission for from sin amen so God had to shed his own blood to bridge that Chasm to bridge that Gap to bring us back onto himself Hallelujah that's what the preaching of the word does to every single one amen you see when he lost his life he lost his inheritance amen hallelujah because he had completely Supreme at control of the earth he was a god of Earth god of the universe but his son had this Earth under his own control amen because Adam was a Son of God and God is bringing us back into that position where he had Supreme control of the earth his Earth and you got to bring this Earth under subjection and have supreme authority of it on it so anything that comes and try to destroy this you can cast it out amen sickness disease poverty just ask what you will and it shall be done unto you what you lacking here today Hallelujah God is restoring back into that first existence that we had amen hallelujah praise God you see Adam could have say to this mountain be moved and be placed over

the authority to move that thing from your life to move that obstacle in your way amen and move on press on hallelujah thank you Lord you see Adam lost his inheritance the earth now it's passed from his hands to the one he sold it to Satan he sold his faith in God to Satan's reasoning therefore his eternal life his right to the tree of light life life his right to the Earth which belonged to him he forfeited it every bit into the hands of Satan he gave up his rightful Poss his inheritance to Satan amen but you know what God is restoring back our inheritance the purchased price has been paid hallelujah amen amen so what you claiming today amen you want your inheritance amen the price has already been paid what did devil rob you and steal from you amen he has a right now you have the authority to tell him to loose it and give it back to the rightful owner I am the rightful owner man God give you children he give you a family amen he didn't just give you them for joke amen he says
