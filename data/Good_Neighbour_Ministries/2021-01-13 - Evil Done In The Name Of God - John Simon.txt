TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] praise the lord it's good to be here another wednesday to give glory and honor to his mighty name my friends these online broadcasts are plain and simple no beauty to behold in them except for the word of god may the great holy spirit help you to get past style beauty symmetry system and that type of thing and see right into the fullness of god's great and precious word now in the book of revelation chapter 2 reading verse 10 fear none of these things which thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that you may be tried and ye shall have tribulation ten days be thou faithful unto death and i will give you a crown of life o blessed be the name of the lord amen a gracious heavenly father we have read thy word now maybe may the holy spirit break the bread of life and give us lord jesus bread that we may eat and live forever we ask this in jesus name amen praise god hallelujah amen this wonderful verse begins fear not my friends i tell you there is always a battle an engagement some spit form of spiritual warfare ahead that causes god to forewarn his people by telling them not to fear don't fear don't going to panic when you see these things around you perilous times chaos trial tribulation don't get into a panic don't you fear don't you worry but rest in his unchanging love and grace for god will take care of you till to the end oh what a savior redeemer and friend place your faith in him for he cares for you and he will see you through i would like to show to you today how satan by his evil actions through his people justifies those actions by using the defense of religion as its justification for its venomous and insidious actions all done in the name of god and that is what i would like to entitle this evil acts done in the name of god my friends god says fear not no matter if you're in the midst of deprivation lack need trouble trial or tribulation fear not now he doesn't god doesn't come out and just say tribulation is coming he's not blunt about it but he tempers it in the way that he expresses it because had he said it that way it would frighten us but he a great god like a mother time for her children to go to rest from their daily troubles trials to go to sleep and have a time of recuperation and she gently assures them by telling them well children fear not don't fear because i'm going to turn off the lights and when i turn off the lights it's going to get dark but at the same time you should disclose your eyes and go to sleep don't be afraid the lights are going out and it will be dark but one thing fear not do what your fear because you ought to remember i will be here oh thank god for his promise that no matter what happens he promised i will never leave you nor forsake you but i'll be with you to the end he will be with us all the way as uh dr pentecost has said god in the shadows always watches over his own my dear friends no matter what you or i may be going through god is somewhere in the background he is standing like the angel of god by the drapes in the room and casting his eyes upon you never to leave you never to forsake you but to watch over you with an endearing love oh the love of god this wonderful love that he has given to his children he's trying to tell us i'm here i'm with you god you fear what man can do unto you amen i'm with you and as paul said my grace is sufficient for you o glory to his marvelous name when you pass through the waters they will not overflow you your troubles will not be able to drowned you you will not be covered up you will not be carried away but you will be kept by the power of god through faith not even in death are you defeated because we are more than conquerors through him that loved us aren't you happy today that no matter what comes your way listen we are more than conquerors now i'm here i'm saying these things and it may sound easy to you for someone to say we are more than conquerors because i am not in your situation i am not in your trial i am not in your trouble i have mine and in that i know i am more than a conqueror what i am doing is calling upon you to bring up that kind of confidence and faith and trust shine light trust in god to remember i am with you i will never leave you nor forsake you but i'll be with you and through it all trust in jesus through it all trust in him and let him lead you by the hand all the way and he will safely carry you through oh glory to god even the great apostles says it clearly friends troubles will never triumph over the children of god death will not defeat the children of god for there is a resurrection and a rapture that awaits those that believe him trust in him and hold to his unchanging hand paul speaking from experience and from the unfailing realities of the living god wrote these words in romans chapter 8 verses 35 to 59 who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword as it is written for thy saint we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor deaths nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord so do not fear do not panic do not get into a frenzy oh brother sister god's love casts out all your fear right now in the name of jesus christ may the spirit of fear leave the children of god that can believe his promise in this moment while i'm speaking and ever after fear not for i am with you i'll be with you right through to the end of the age until you rapture out of here until you enter the august splendor of his divine presence he promised that he will be with us every step along this way now notice what he says here in the word the devil will cast some of you in the prison that you may be tried at that time the jews were doing it the pagan priests were doing it the political powers of the day the governors were trying to carry favor with the public because the people love the arena they love the colosseum and they hurled christians by the thousands to their deaths destroying them by lions and gladiators and every other means but what has the devil to do with this it was lions killing them it was gladiators killing them it was governors persecuting them but remember behind all of this is was this satanic sinister evil person this spirit being unseen to human eyes that we as genuine christians recognize and use the biblical term satan for he is the one as our god being a spirit being is behind the scenes and making himself manifest through his children so is satan this evil wicked ancient spirit working through those that will yield themselves to him and he will perpetrate crimes beyond belief and killing thousands using as his instruments as he did in the garden using the serpent now he uses lions he uses gladiators and any other means of torture destruction that he might wipe out every every evidence of the manifested presence of god in his children my friends he is behind it all and the reason is because he hates god he hates the children of god and anything that god loves or he sets his heart upon satan hates it remember this anything or anyone god loves satan hates and because he hates whatever god loves he comes against it with his trial and tribulation that is why one of the apostles peter belief said counted all joy when when you you brought into trial and tribulations for the trial of your faith work and patience it causes you to know that god loves you god cares about you well you say well if he cares why does he allow this because he has them all to shape you just you try you break you and make you and maul you again as the potter with the clay and this is a painful process we may not and we do not have to understand what god is doing except to rest ourselves in his unchanging and endless grace that he might make us into vessels that he wants us to be we are here to fulfill his divine purposes let him do with us as he wills amen amen so let it be glory to god amen so satan is bound to destroy when you try to live for god thank god he was behind all the groups trying to destroy christians behind the romans who tried to destroy christians he was behind that mother church with inquisition that tried to kill millions thousands during the times of the dark ages and in all ages it's the same spirit of satan whether it be uh pharaoh or nebuchadnezzar or whether it be uh hitler or whether it be stalin doesn't matter it's the same spirit of satan trying to carry out this activity of destroying the body in which god lives the temple in which god dwells to tear it down and to destroy it oh my oh brother sister can't you see it this is what he did tore down the temples of god tears up the people of god which is the physical temple of god and he is still doing it in this hour as long as he can find vessels to carry out his evil ex now this study today is done and i'm doing it on this the 13th of january 2021 now notice in revelation 13. revelation 13 for this number 13 has great significance 30th of january 13th uh chapter of revelation and this 13th of chapter of revelation we find prophecy concerning the united states of america for 13 is the number of a woman 13 is also the number of the united states of america strikingly true because that number also symbolizes the woman statue of liberty which represents the united states of america and this very number the symbol of that great nation which started with 13 colonies and the flag had 13 stars and 13 stripes and there we find as we read in the bible her destiny is in the word of god and where does god place it chapter 13 of the book of revelation we find this image mentioned within this chapter this image of the beast that was before the same beast that was in the garden of eden that wild hybrid beast and now we see in a spiritual form him raising his head and coming during the nicer council and we see in the future the same antichrist spirit of the beast this destructive ferocious evil spirit will be out and is outraging amen raging like a lion to to destroy the people of god and so he will the image being formed denominations formed like blocks of a building and after a while you'll take all the bricks or blocks and fit them together and make a shape a house an image to which he can use my friends do you see what i'm talking about that same being as behind the world council of churches and it will emerge and when it does emerge and we understand people begin to understand with their head it will be too late then recognize it now and may the holy spirit of the living god take the word of god and reveal it to you while there is yet time take your time to look into his word and to come against this ungodly satanic power against a a world council of churches anointed with this kind of evil power upon it which is not yet maybe showing its claws like a cat can be stroked while everything is fine but you go the opposite way and get the cat angry and out comes these claws that will rake and scrape and cut and tear because of the evil anger that will flow from them it's nothing but the two vines the evil vine coming against the true vine of god and a repeat performance is taking place and is about to take place with diabolical cunning and with cruel evil satanic ferocity those who fight the humble the simple people of god and scoff and try to destroy them and they try to do it in the name of religion they try to mask it in the way as if they're doing it for righteousness sake we're cleansing the church for god's sake we're doing it for jesus sake all done in the name of god all done in the name of religion wars torture inquisitions evil forcing people into systems and after a while that will take place they will form this image that will form the system and you if you refuse to be a part of that system you will not be able to buy nor sell or have a normal human life you will not be free they claim you'll be free but you won't be free because they'll force you into making a choice they will inject you whether you like it or not if you don't accept the evil injection of sin then you will not be able to eat buy sell fly conduct businesses all in the cunning-ness of satan it's for your good it's for the good of the house of god the people of god and the children of god and you are in the minority anyway and we have to take care of the majority so friends it's right upon you and you must take note of what satan is doing because he is preparing for his great big push that will accomplish his divine aims as i said they'll do it all in the name of god and in the guise and name of religion claiming that they're doing it for purity sake and righteousness sick organizing repudiating the little flock they expose themselves when they do that and therefore reveal that they are of their father the devil and that they are of the false vine the same false vine murderous spirit that was in cain that same false vine characteristics will be made and is being made manifest through them in this day and this hour either by the destruction of character destruction of the very physical person destruction of in every possible way and every dimension and that they can do it they will destroy you as much as they can oh my yes brother sister and their hatred proves that they are of that nickelodeon antichrist church and they are of that type of a canaan canis spirit that is upon them they shall cast you into prison says the word of god yes they'll drag you into courts they'll false you accuse you they'll sue you they'll try you they'll imprison you and of course they'll do it all in the name of the holy church they'll do it all in the name of religion they'll do it all in the name of jesus they'll do it all in the name of their defending righteousness they'll do it all in the name of decency because of what you may be preaching they'll do it all in the name of their outraged innocence they'll do it that way all done for a good cause this is the guys this is the evil mask that satan will use my friends to be able to commit his ferocious evil acts this is the same spirit creeping in taking prayer out of the schools taking my friends bible reading out of the schools taking out all those things out of our laws out of our uh our churches taking the out of the our leadership what is it it's satan behind it and he is yet angry angry against god for kicking him out of the heavenly places that are in christ jesus but thanks god that god through his love has brought us into his beloved and placed us into those same heavenly places and made us that you are the ones that will be in charge of the garden you are the ones that will say what you should say and receive the glory for i've placed these things under your feet thank god even satan satan is placed under our feet you will tread upon serpents you will cast out devils you shall lay your hands upon the sick and they shall recover why for we are more than conquerors through him that loved us oh glory be to god hallelujah and thou shalt have tribulation in 10 10 days of course we know that the church age of smyrna is a prototype or a a nursery of what it will be like during that time called the tribulation period so in this he's saying you will be cast into the tribulation tribulation for 10 days of course we understand that 10 days means 10 years for the efficiency smyrna church of smyrna ran from three or 2 a.d to 3 12 a.d oh praise god amen except for the mercy of god be true believers elected i'm not talking about people calling themselves christians but those that are the married wife they elected the the gods few his little flock his lambs that are despised rejected and killed all the day long in every way but thank god his love endures forever the love of god is greater far than tongue or men shall ever tell or thank god forever may his love flood your soul flood my soul flood our lives that we may walk talk live and move within this environment and atmosphere of the love of god flowing through us day by day glory to his name amen hallelujah friends the scripture further reads be thou faithful unto death he does not say be faithful until you die or until death but be faithful unto death and we we may have to seal our testimony with our blood we don't know thousands even millions have died during the ages like antipas the great martyr of god in the bible who held not his life dear unto death for the glory of god now you may think it's impossible to to be a martyr and we are all humans we we think of our flesh we think of our bodies and so on you think it's impossible but because of this perfect faith that dwells within you at that time if you are to face that god through that will raise up a standard in you that will give you the courage the faith the boldness that you will not even seek or feel but you will walk into god's divine purpose and into his will like danielle shadrach and abednego they walked into the fire singing praising and glorifying god and thank god his promise is still true i'll be with you for for nebuchadnezzar saw in the fire of fort man in the fire and that fought man the son of god jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah that same fate that empowered polycarp latimer and ridley at the stake many others that died for jesus sake that same power will anoint you be with you overshadow you and and be with you every step of the way fear not little flock it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom supreme faith will give you supreme grace to meet the challenge of that supreme hour blessed be god forever to him be all the glory and then it further reads i will give thee a crown of life this is not a promise of a man who says i'll do this i'll do that and when the time comes circumstances holds him blocks him and keeps him from doing or performing his promise this is the almighty speaking this is the great i am speaking he says i will give thee a crown of life oh thank god hallelujah my friend not even a cup of water given by someone to you passes by his eyes he will reward everyone and reward everyone that does something for his people or anything that his people does for him in his name he promises to reward them by giving them the crown of life that he gave to the martyrs in the name of the lord jesus christ hallelujah amen yes sir you can compare this to the crown that's given in the roman times in a race when they had the marathons and the winner of the marathon will be given a garland or crown platted out of palm or olive o my and they will wear it up on their heads as showing that there were winners there were winners of the olympic race well even though it may outwardly it may not seem like you are a winner if you have christ in you you are a winner uh lady you're a winner man you're a winner young person young lady young man teenager youth you are a winner if you have christ in you you are a winner for you win because the greatest winner of all time lives and moves and has his being within you this great crown spoken in revelation 2 was given to the martyrs this is the martyr's crown god promises he'll give it to you this is the crown of life and he promises that he will give it to you this crown is the crown of kings and priests to god a crown of royalty which he promises that he will give it to you thank god that this crown is not like that crown they received made of palm branches made out of olive branches that will wither and dry up and die but this crown that he gives you is incorruptible and imperishable it's an evil eternal crown that god promises that he will give to those that will believe his promise and believe his word because you have striven you have striven for him and you have given to his work and to his given your all your life amen as a living sacrifice you've given to him also thank god and he gives to you this great crown of life not like the crowns of worthy a whirly success many a crown with whirly success but that like the olympic crown the marathon crown will pass away with the evening breeze like smoke or the mists of time but brother this crown that you will receive is an incorruptible imperishable crown of royalty god promises that he will give it to you because you shed your blood for him you sacrifice for him you strive you you struggle to live for him the best you can every day of your life and he is watching and he knows everything that you are going through god knows god knows and he says fear not don't panic i am here in the darkness i am here where you cannot see me but i am watching i'm watching over you for you are my own and here you are my friends risk to receive eternal rewards for the recompense of god is not to be lightly esteemed believe in the reality of the resurrection promise believe in the reality but the rapture promised that though if you believe though you were dead yet shall you live oh praise his wonderful name that we can say lord we receive your promise and now we are resting on that may we rest our faith on this solid foundation that he has given to us amen that we are going to enter into a kingdom that is not fairy tales it's not some myth it's not of the imagination of man but it's a kingdom of substance the kingdom of eternal reality where we can rest our faith in therefore let us lay up in heaven treasures treasures that god might look upon us and see that we are his faithful servants and that we trust in him who will not fail us we trust in him who will not leave us we trust in him who will be with us right true until we finish our life's race this human race and enter into eternal glory in the presence of god may god bless every one of us here today and receive the word of god or receive it my brother my sister receive it fear not and i jesus christ will give thee a crown of life that fadeth not away amen god bless you we'll come together again for the lord supper on sunday may the spirit of god go with you every step of the way may this great anointing of the holy ghost take you and stay with you every step of the way watching over you leading you opening up your understanding and that you might grow more and more in love with him within this great romance of redemption god bless you here today amen glory to god hallelujah [Music] amen [Music] you
