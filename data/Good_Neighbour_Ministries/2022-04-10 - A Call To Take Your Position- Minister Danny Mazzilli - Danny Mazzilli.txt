word of god it just keeps on getting better and better just keeps on breaking open more and more you know it's just it's just tremendous saints what the lord is doing in this day and in this hour amen praise god i'm excited about the word of god today is everybody excited about the word if you are the word you are excited it's as simple as that because that's the message of the hour that's what it's all about saints and that's what we're going to be looking at today by the grace of our lord jesus christ god bless you all welcome into the house of the lord it's good to be here i see some faces that we haven't seen in a bit god bless you brother david i haven't seen you in a while praise god and sister hope and jose praise god god bless you all welcome welcome into the house of the lord this morning amen so this morning we're going to be um looking at uh at the scriptures we can bring up the first slide before we do we're going to go to the lord in prayer we're going to seek him and welcome him and i know he's already here i sense his presence praise god it just makes me a little nervous every time amen but praise god i know that we're in for something good amen let's pray father we are so thankful this morning lord that we can assemble in this day and in this hour knowing that you are present you have a present day ministry you are uh very mindful of your children and those that have caught this revelation lord of who you are in this day and in this hour lord where you can be found and lord we are so grateful lord that you constantly honor your word you come before we even come lord because you started this work you are the author you are the finisher lord bless us as we gather now in heavenly places anoint your word bring it to each individual in season father so that we may all rejoice together on that day granted we pray in jesus name amen praise god amen glory to god so our scripture reading this morning is from isaiah we'll be looking at a few scriptures we'll be looking at some quotes um this is going to be at least a two-part series so we'll be here on wednesday night again and we will continue and see where we can get isaiah chapter 60 verses one and two says arise shine for thy light is come and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee amen praise god the lord add his blessings to the word praise god forevermore you may be seated let's read another scripture from saint john chapter 1 verses one and two actually one to five we're going to read one to five in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made wow in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not next slide last time we spoke we spoke about that he was calling your name and so we're just going to continue on we're going to be looking uh you know deeper into what it is that you know that's actually taking place and in this day and in this hour and we need to recognize the power of the word you know we've heard it so often about he is the word you've got to recognize the word you are the word the word has come the word for this hour we keep hearing it over and over and over again and if you've heard the word for this hour is because god is calling you god is placing you god is giving you faith to recognize who you are but you see our calling an election is for a purpose if he's calling you and you've heard your name it's because god has a purpose for you amen god don't just call your name just to come and assemble in a church and you know join another church because there's 150 churches here within you know within 20 miles that you could go and and you know have ministers minister the word of god to you and you will hear the word of god amen but if you've heard your name you can't assemble anywhere but under the leadership of the holy spirit you're looking for god you're you're listening for god you're you're going to services with expectation in your hearts amen but we can't you know like but the whole problem is that we're still human we're sons of god but yet we're still human and so we've got to deal with the pulls of this life never has there been so many pulls as there are in this date in this hour my god with social media and everything else you know that's there to you know to to distract us the technology i mean the way information moves these days you know one minute you hear something and you think oh this is what's happening then the next minute you'll hear something else and oh well maybe this is what's happening and you know you're so distracted but if you've come into the word of god and you've come under the leadership of the holy ghost jesus said i will send you the comforter which is the holy spirit and it will lead you and guide you into truth all truth all truth so once you've come under that kind of inspiration and you've caught a revelation of who you are then you are you are being pulled by the holy spirit you're being led by the holy spirit you're you're you find yourself under a ministry that's holy spirit led it's supernatural you can't be under some denominational teaching you can't be under man's interpretation of the word of god you just you will not you'll never get fed there just look at your own experience and look to see what what what's drawn you here what's got you here to this day and into this hour you got to look at your your experience and what's taking place right now within your life and see the power of god bringing you over and over again into the services feeding on the word listening to the prophet listening to the word of god and the change and the effect that it's having on you amen praise god we are the body of christ we're connected to one another once you've come into the real true body of christ and the holy ghost places you into the body you come to realize how connected you are to that body how important each and every one of us is in the body how without one we can't be made perfect it's you know we've heard it that we're encamped about by a cloud of witnesses because they're they're watching they're they're they're waiting on us to come into our position so that they can be made perfect so that we can fulfill the purpose and the plan and the word for this day and this hour which is what the rapture the rapture amen praise god hallelujah let's look at the next slide listen to brother branham here invisible union of the bride of christ and that's my message to you church you that's union spiritual union by the word that you're dead to these old husbands you're born anew don't try to dig him up you know you're you've been born again by the revealing of this word when that cloud came down in 1963 that was christ coming down to his body that was god coming down to call the names of the sons and daughters of god that would be fulfilling his word in this day so so so he so don't dig don't try to dig him up he's dead if you're a born-again christian that little germ that was predestinated to you it's the word coming on word on word on word onward and come into full stature of christ that's right so he can come get his bride now we're just ready for one thing that's the coming of the lord this is brother branham back in 1965 he knew what had taken place he knew the coming of the lord was was already happening he realized what was going on but the world you know the world sees it in a different way they're all waiting on the coming of the lord but we've recognized that he's already come we're already called we're you know those that have recognized have already recognized that they've been placed positionally placed in the body there is your name on the book of life the book of life is the word of god because the word is god and god is the only thing that is life so your name was represented in the bible before the bible became onward i'm going to read that again that's beautiful your name your name was represented in the bible before the bible become onward hallelujah you were in christ before the foundations of the world you were already seen you were god knew when you were going to come into your season brother gabriel god knew exactly when you were gonna be placed as a son or a adopted as a son or a daughter of god because if you were in god that's the only way that you're gonna recognize the word because you are the word you're you're you're not you're you're not jesus christ but you are a portion of the word and that's the reason why you can recognize the word and then and then you know you're going to realize that that that you've got a part in the word and that your part has to come to life because that's the word for this day and this hour if you don't come to life if you don't get into your position you're not going to fulfill the word you're going to fulfill something else outside of the word and we know what's going to go go on outside of the word we know that it's only the bride that's going in the rapture that's that's the only ones that are going to be translated out of this dimension those that have to stay are going to go into tribulation they're going to have to be purged we looked at all of that those whose you know those that that come up in the second resurrection but we are identified by the first resurrection hallelujah so listen here listen he says and if you're here to do that won't it vindicate that word in other words your life you don't have to try and interpret your life christ in you is your hope of glory he will vindicate for himself listen what he says here he'll vindicate that word congregation says amen won't the church vindicate itself won't malachi 4 see he he's recognizing the portion of the word that he was why you don't think brother branham knew who he was he was so humble the way that he lived the way that he spoke he would not just come right out and say hey don't you know i'm malachi 4. 5 you church is out there you're all going to hell if you don't listen to me no that's not the word that's not but he knew who he was it's just like you and i we know who we are we realize the condition of the world and and that it's actually in darkness that's why this light that we are that that has come upon us has given us life because there's life in christ the life is in the word remember that the life is in the word hallelujah but darkness cannot comprehend light therefore they cannot have life so when you're talking about this word and you're trying to you know testify to people understand you can testify you can show them the word you can read them the word but don't try to make them something that they're not if there is an attribute elected seed of god in there when you speak the word when you when you start to read the word when you start to testify about the word it's not you it's the word in you and it's life it's life it comes out of you and when that life shines onto the darkness and there's election there and there's a seed there that seed just it has to look up it has to look up it has to hear it has to recognize it can't it can't help it it'll vindicate itself and all these other things perfectly perfectly vindicate itself and show that that's what it is amen hallelujah praise god next slide so this morning we're going to look at a call to take your position this is so important saints we need to recognize who we are that's one thing but then we need to realize that we've got a position in the word we've got something that god wants to do in and through our lives the author and the finisher of our faith he started a work in you he's going to finish it brother he's going to finish it one way or the other so you might as well surrender and yield yourself if you've recognized that you're in the word and that you that you've heard your name well it's like when somebody goes to the army they get into the lineup and the sergeant says corporal mozilli prison sir he's going to respond he's going to say take your position and you're going to already know because you've been in training you've been training for so many years you've been walking with the lord for so many years some of you have you know like some of you are disappointed you've been walking so long but yet you can't even do the the simple abc's sometimes the lord is calling us to take our position to recognize the time in the season and the hour that we're living in this world is in gross darkness he needs light and you are that light you are that living word that's being manifest amongst the people when you go to work on monday morning when you go do what it is that you do every single day when you go home when you talk to your wife when you talk to your children you are light you are given light you are given life and you have the ability to change the atmospheres around your life around your home around your finance are like all those things you're living underprivileged but the moment you take your position just look at a person when they get a a a you know a promotion at work they go from being a manufacturing help mate to the assistant supervisor watch that individual they start to act different they start if they've got the maturity to understand that they've been promoted there's a reason for their promotion there's a purpose behind god giving you more revelation because he's given you the responsibility to live it to to walk it to you know to talk it and to do what you know you must do as a son or daughter of god under the leadership of a god-given ministry [Music] hallelujah then the individual gets promoted to supervisor he's not the assistant now he's the supervisor three years down the road he's the vice president before you know it he's the president and he is under the board of directors you see and their position as it gets moves up they become more mature more respected more authoritative they take their position they realize it's a responsibility that they have a responsibility to fulfill that position amen hallelujah well so do you saints let's look at the next slide listen to brother branham he says here watch the church as it comes as it moves just take it in your own mind you historians that studies history look at lutheran church under justification coming just so freshly from catholicism look at it moving then look at wesley coming a little closer into sanctification weaving into the scriptures look at right in between the wesley then the next thing come in was the pentecostal age and the pentecostal age was the restoration of the gifts the spiritual gifts now look at the age coming now right up to the headstone that's leadership that's that's that's dominion god restoring back his dominion he's restoring back the the the dominion that he gave adam and eve in the garden of eden that they had the ability to speak the word and positionally place the trees and name the animals and have dominion and and have dominion over the earth now look at the age coming now right up to the headstone so what do i mean the coming of the lord and made known god in all creation is waiting for the church to positionally find its place hallelujah praise god forevermore hallelujah aren't you glad that god sent us a prophet aren't you glad that god sent us a prophet in this 20th century that that that that had that had a portion in the word that needed to be fulfilled malachi 4 5 revelations 10 1-7 he had those things that needed to be fulfilled so that it could introduce the coming of the lord the mighty angel come down that cloud that came down in 1963 was god vindicating and showing that his mind his his word the light because he was all in all he was the same one that was the elohim back at the beginning when he was elohim you were in him when he was condescending everything that that we look at in the bible everything that we see we we see jesus christ in every type in every form listen brother braham said it himself those seven seals when they when that seventh seal was open it unveiled and opened up the entire bible all the mysteries of the bible were unveiled when that seventh seal was unveiled everything that means that everything that you were everything that you were to be was being unveiled at that time all that was in there all the mystery so if it's the entire bible and brother branham says that christ the mystery of god revealed he is the entire bible he is the word he's all the mysteries he's everything all in all then what are we what are we looking for we should be seeing christ in everything it's all about the word it's all about him it's everything about him listen jesus speaking here john i'm just going to read it john chapter 12 verses 44 to 50. jesus cried and said he that believeth on him that sent me and he that seeth me seeth him that sent me now now i want you to catch something here he was the word in that day he was only saying and speaking what the word what the lord what the father elohim told him to speak because that was the word for that day so listen i am come a light into the world that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness so he was the light like we read in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and if any man hear my words and believe not i judge him not for i came not to judge the world but to save the world you see how he was not coming to judge at that time he was coming to save he was coming to fulfill his part in the word without him doing what he had to do at calvary we wouldn't be here today amen we need to see the progression of the word here we need to recognize because then it leads up to your part your position your placing listen i am come so verse 48 he that reject me and re receiveth not my words hath one that judgeth him the word so if you can't if so you know you're testifying the word you're you're trying to share the word and you know you're you're you're saying man why can't they see this why can't they accept this they actually reject it they'll tell you listen i don't believe it that's just the way it is don't you be trying to convince or or or turn somebody into something that they're not amen hath one that judges him the word that i have spoken the same shall judge him in the last day for i have not spoken of myself but the father which sent me he gave me commandment what i should say and what i should speak and i know that his commandment is life everlasting whatsoever i speak therefore even as the father sayeth unto me so i speak well what about us god has revealed to us who we are our part in the word we're not going to speak something that that that we don't know we're not listen we can quote all day long you know there's many that can quote the word quote the prophet you know but then there's another thing when you recognize that you are the word and that now the word lives in you and that it's fulfilling a part for this day and for this hour and those that have to recognize those that will recognize they will come to the word they will recognize what's taking place they will realize that they have a place in the word because out there you know you talk to people that that are denominational all their teachings are based on what they've been taught everything is based on what they've been taught you know people will say i'm in the message i'm in the message that doesn't classify you as an attribute of god i am the message that classifies you as an attribute of god you see there's a difference i am in the message there's a lot of people in the message there's a lot of people that go to church more than you and me there's a lot that that can quote the prophet better than you and me but god chooses his own he says on that day ye shall know that i am in the father he and me and i in you that's a revelation saints that's something that that that differentiates you from the rest of the world you speak another language you speak a new language the bible becomes a new bible to you because of revelations 10 1-7 the mighty angel coming down placing you eternally into that that that supernatural dispensation everything now is a supernatural dispensation it's no longer under the seven church ages under the historical teachings this goes beyond that this is the joshua commission where god himself takes you into the capstone and starts to positionally place you in the word of god by revelation not by knowledge oh i'm going to go to the church i'm going to be the trustee because i'm smart in math are you that smart in math brother mike no god places by revelation god knows his own god recognizes his word from before the foundations of the world there was an attribute that was placed inside of you and me that must fulfill the purpose and the plan of god there's nothing that you can do to stop it when you come under this when you recognize that it's not a man preaching to you but it's the holy spirit the life of god speaking to the attributes of god the life there's life in the word those who recognize who they are took their position in the word and fulfilled their word read john chapter 14 when you get a chance where jesus is speaking he says that that jesus says you shall receive the comforter the holy ghost the spirit of truth whom the world shall not know but you shall know him what is it that you shall know what is it that that that that you will know the word you'll have the spirit of truth to recognize and discern the word but look the lord is obligated to his word not man's interpretation so many men will put their own interpretation on the word they'll quote the prophet they'll use the the quotes but they don't really have a revelation of what it is that the prophet was under what kind of inspiration the prophet was under and why he was saying it there's a big difference amen praise god hallelujah life is in the word blessed be the name of the lord god so let's go to the next slide now ii peter wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things ye shall never fail amen you know so many are trying to figure out everything that's going on around other people's lives trying to interpret this and oh well you know this one here it's you know he's not and she's not coming to church because of this and because of that you know they did this or they did that this is not the hour to be trying to make sure other people's calling an election this is the time where we make sure of our calling our election our purpose and so we want to look at three things next slide that we need to do in order to fulfill our purpose the first thing you need to do is you need to find your position come into a self realization this is simple okay but i want you to catch here what the lord is actually trying to do here what do you why he is so mindful of each and every one of you because we got you know we get so distracted by the things of this life and if and if we don't get reminded about these simple things we can we can lose track and we can fall behind and we can miss so many blessings that the lord is trying to do in and through our lives and self-realization and self-identification is you recognizing who you are in the word you come to this church you know there's a lot of positions available in the church there's cleaning positions available there's ushering positions available god is looking to maybe add another deacon or add another few trustees amen god is looking to to to add to the church such as he requires and he's looking right within the body of christ he's not going to go call somebody you know that that that has the ability naturally he's looking for his word and then he's looking for that word to self-recognize self-realize you got to look at your own life you got to look at how god built you how he designed you i look back on my own life i see certain you know aspects of how the lord built me from when i was a kid how he designed my character how he designed my nature my my impulsive nature you know risk taking all of those things i realized that that you know it was because he was preparing me for this he was preparing us for this time and season he needed individuals that would fulfill his word and you know you look at the churches you know within the message and some churches you know the ones that i find interesting you know because you know sometimes you're you're listening in on other ministries and you're watching and you visit and you'll see that you know it you know a church it's got like two 300 people there but yet there's only a handful maybe one or two that you can really fellowship with around the world because you'll know within within two minutes of fellowshipping with somebody if the spirit of the holy ghost is moving in the midst of your fellowship he vindicates it himself then you look at these small churches sometimes you go in and there's you know 34. look at look at this church here in this church there's a half a dozen at least ministers able ministers able deacons able trustees able individuals right here within this little congregation of 100 maybe 150 people whatever it is but god knows his own but he's looking to put you into your rightful positions in order to get into your rightful positions you need to come and examine yourself you know a lot of people they're not getting blessed financially and they're wondering why they're sitting still they're just surviving i'm just using that as an example then you look i want you to examine yourself are you a tight payer are you an individual that gives that has the revelation of giving because if you do then god is obligated to honor his word remember that one thing god will never ever not do is honor and vindicate his word remember that amen and so self-realization and self-examination needs to look at all these areas of our lives to see why certain things are not where they're supposed to be god can be bringing you to church sunday after sunday young and old sitting behind the pew listening in one ear out the other because you have not taken it's serious your calling in your election but god's waiting for you to hear to recognize and to find your position so that he can put you where he needs you so that you can edify the body remember we were saying that we need one another we bless encourage edify rub i can i could sit here and tell you experiences after experiences where i have had fellowship beyond comprehension the power of god the anointing of the holy ghost come into you know with brothers and and sisters anointed spiritual supernatural fellowship weeping and crying praying for four and five hours and i can tell you with the same individuals how i was ready to knock them out oh yeah you see you're still human you're still human but you got to recognize you have a position and when you mature and you grow into that position and you recognize who you are and then you start to recognize how important your brother and your sister is to you and how much of an effect they can have on you okay it's powerful saints of god remember you're human and you are a son of god the human side of you doesn't like it when a brother walks by you doesn't even look at you and pretends you don't even exist that human side of you looks and thinks all right well i'm going to keep praying that human side of you doesn't like it when when you get corrected by your deacon or by the pastor doesn't like it it gets you know pride starts kicking in pride is something that must die as a son or a daughter of god it is something that must die it must never be given the ability to speak to to to uh you know to like you'll know yourself you know this is all part of self identification and self realization simple things right but when when you start to dig in a little bit you start to realize that there's things my god that demon of pride it just rises up so often you know i gotta starve it out you know how you starve it out shut your mouth you don't need to give a comment you don't need if god is correcting you if somebody's correcting you whether it's right or wrong you wait you don't have to immediately blurb out and say well this is the way i see it and this and this and this and that you can actually sit back relax let it come let it be revealed take it to prayer and let the holy spirit give you the right time and season to deal with the situation often times we're too quick too quick you know this is all part of self-examination right we want to die we want to let the power of god move in our lives you know that the power of god can move in your life right at work amen right at work the spirit of god can move and and i've seen it happen i've seen it so many times it i walk and i just think oh lord thank you so much hallelujah i'm going my god you're so real i didn't have to do a thing he just dealt with it because he saw that i had the right mental attitude towards it i saw the weakness in the individual i saw them maybe hurt from previous experiences i saw things that that you know that scarred them in the past and then the holy spirit just went and dealt with it and moved on them and their their situation they don't even have to be sons and daughters of god don't think we're this is this is your boss this is somebody that has authority over you god can move and deal with their hearts and before you know it man they're there they're repenting to you and and all you're you're not sitting there see i told you i was right you got that kind of attitude you god's still working on you say oh brother man you know hey boss i really appreciate that and you know i appreciate everything that you're doing i know you're you're doing your best i know i know that you know you you got pressures like anybody else and you know i apologize that you know maybe i got you know a little bit you know out of out of myself and this and that and all of a sudden it's just like you've just built a brand new level of confidence and that's the way the lord works with you you can build confidence with the lord all of a sudden you can know the lord is going to stand behind you he's going to help you in that circumstance he's going to deal with that situation and then you know you look at the next thing it says holding your position you gotta you gotta be consistent never mind you get excited oh i'm gonna be there saturday i'm going to clean the church and then you don't see the person for the next two years like like you got to hold your position god's looking for that consistency god's looking for that for that that that that that passion you know to really serve the lord you're not listen we serve one another and it strengthens one another it helps one another you're building your brother or your sister you're edifying you're encouraging when you're doing those things and you're holding to your position when we see you know you standing like i look at you know brother eugene there he's vacuuming every week week in week out he takes up that vacuum and it's it's why he's holding to his position you know you think oh well that's a position in the word that is that is a powerful position in the word and i know god will bless that position god will meet those needs god will anoint in certain areas that god knows that the brother needs assistance and everything else it's not because he's doing it so god says you do this and i'll do that no you're automatically blessed you're listen you're gonna get the blessing regardless you're gonna get the blessing of the rapture regardless but some of us we're gonna we're it's gonna be a fight right to the end because you're fighting because your attitude because your mental attitude is is negative you know a negative attitude can never do anything good never do anything good if there's anything you want to try and do is turn your attitude from negative to positive all you got to do is look for the good instead of the bad you can look at the day today and say oh it's cloudy and it looks like it's going to rain or you can look at it and say oh the sun's out there and it's looking to break through those clouds and it's coming you see it's how you look at things it's how you perceive everything around you and if you've got a negative attitude it never does any good to the circumstances or the situation but throw a positive word throw a positive thought into that conversation into that situation prayer positive prayer whatever it is it'll turn it around it'll change the whole thing holding your position vision of your mission knowing that god is a purpose in placing you in the body of christ and the next thing maintaining your position so you hold and you maintain you keep with passion and perseverance you start to build on your own attitude by becoming more positive by becoming more uh uh you know uh lit you know like like a leader you're you're a leader you're a positive leader so whatever you do you're doing it in a positive way and you're maintaining that positive mental attitude that that positive direction where god can place you and use you in the body of christ let's go to the next slide so self-realization listen to brother branham here he says if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army [Music] you see how powerful self-realization is how important it is for us to come into that because as a part of coming into self-realization comes self-empowerment by the holy spirit your position gets empowered by god you start to get an authority around your life like we were saying when you have that you go to work and you have that revelation your boss is your boss but god is his boss and you've got a revelation of that and so now you're different your life and everything around your life is influenced in a different way next slide catching the vision vision is the determination and the will to never give up see these are simple things but you know when you're at church sunday wednesday night comes along and you know that when you get into the house of the lord you get blessed and you gotta like you gotta i'm i'm going i'm gonna get there i'm i'm not gonna give up i know that when i get there i'm just using that as an example i'm not saying there's times when you can't get into the house of the lord you got to work you got situations whatever it is that's irrelevant but when you can be here you got to press through you've got to push through you've got to get there because remember we edify one another we need one another when i see my brothers and my sisters coming into church on wednesdays participating on the friday night prayer meetings it builds strength and faith in my life it edifies me it encourages me to keep doing it to keep pressing on to keep doing my part you know because they're doing theirs i feel motivated by them and it's not so much you're getting you are actually feeling the effects of the holy ghost coming off of their ministry when i see brother eugene vacuuming i get blessed i see the i see the the the body of christ i'm using you as an example i hope you don't mind but i see the body working i see you know the brothers in there brother coffee the sisters cleaning the washrooms all those things these are edifying parts of the body of christ they look simple to you and me but god is anointing them they are doing it and if they're not doing it by faith you will know it they'll be miserable you walk into the washroom by accident get out now that doesn't happen here but i'm saying when you're not doing something by faith then all of a sudden it's it's a you've got a different attitude you can tell when somebody is really blessed they're in their position they're doing it because of the love of god because they know that it's supernatural they know that this is not a man's calling oh brother coffee chose me to be in the cleaning crew he calls me to come and be in the cleaning crew i i should be up on the stage singing you know like like like if you truly want god's desire god's will even if brother coffee puts you into that cleaning position if the lord wants you here singing it won't be too long you'll be here because you are faithful in the simple things and the in the things where he placed you you were willing to humble yourself and and allow the spirit of god to give you and place you where he was going to test you you know it's like jesus when he we know like in in in john chapter 6 verse 65 to 70 you know no man comes to the lord except it were given him from the father if there's an attribute of god there they're going to come to jesus because they're being called they're being placed but what was it an attribute recognized the word for their day and then he turns around he looks to peter he says hey peter are you going to go too you know that was god testing peter but peter recognized no matter what no matter what the situation the circumstances no matter and he denied christ you know later on but yet he realized that he had the words of eternal life says where do i go and if you as a son or a daughter of god have come under this ministry you've never heard the word like this you're not going to go to church you know denominational church and hear the word coming forth in in in such a fashion where it just it's direct it's it's the holy spirit it's the power of god you know you're looking for the supernatural you're you're constantly listening for the supernatural watching and if you have come into that kind of a relationship with the lord you will not mind him putting you anywhere because if you have been designed in such a way to be up here to sing then he will eventually place you there because he saw from the beginning exactly what you were going to fulfill amen praise god proverbs 29 18 where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he you see you got a vision of the body you got a vision of the ministry you got a vision of your pastor you know that he's your pastor you know that he's he's the one that's going to speak to you guide you bring the word of god be the angel to the church then you know that you've got a god anointed deacon that's leading you and directing you you've caught the vision that god has get placed you under a holy ghost led holy ghost-led ministry remember the holy ghost is the president of this ministry god has the ultimate say none of us god but he gives it in his provided way and authorities and brings it down he's not the author of confusion so when you're listening and you want to hear from the yerma thundum and you've got faith in your pastor that he can speak your need and meet your needs through the word that's being preached if you came here this morning and you had certain things on your heart and it was genuine it was it was sincere i know god will speak to you i know he's already spoken to you if you came with that type of attitude and you're trusting god and so that's the way the holy spirit is gonna govern and operate and build this church each and every one of us being positionally placed and when that vision is clear to you you're going to be a happy member next slide igniting your passion these are simple things but it's important you know the word will ignite your passion you know how you get the word to ignite your passion by submitting to the word humbling yourself to the word allowing the spirit of god to place you and and do the things that he wants to do in your life passion is a powerful compelling desire to serve the lord that's not something you can make up brother tim we're passionate listen i can tell you when when the spirit of god is moving you know you get fellowshipping around the word and you start to hear things and you know you come in on a sunday and the pastor there he's he's just bringing what's on his heart and the holy spirit is just speaking to you lip to ear my god the passion that burns up inside of you it just starts stirring up inside of you because you know that's god speaking to you there's no way he could have known that he he's speaking by revelation he's speaking exactly what i had need of and you know what that does that that gives you a passion and a desire to serve the lord too many people are coming into the house of the lord unprepared you need to pray you need to you consecrate you need to come in with with you know with a desire to hear from the lord you know to hear and to receive instruction so that you can get that promotion at work god will give you what you need right here on sunday or wednesday night so that you can have the right character the right attitude even the words to speak if you are really truly surrendered and have recognized that this is a supernatural church this is not just a regular church amen praise god i'm excited about the the living supernatural body of jesus christ i believe in the power of god to bless and prosper individuals i know he can do it he does it i've experienced it the more that the more you you seek him in those areas the more you desire and you do it with the right heart and the right sincerity and the right motives you watch god pour out his blessings upon your life he knows your needs he knows what you have need of he knows you need a job he knows how much income you're going to require he knows the physical condition of your body he knows the the the mental capacity of your you know of your emotions he knows some of you are are timid he knows that some of you are bold he knows exactly the way that you've been designed because he designed you that way for a purpose [Applause] he wants you to be passionate about serving him amen colossians 3 verse 23 says and whatsoever you do do it heartedly as to the lord not unto men you see how powerful you see what the word is telling us we don't sir like that's one thing my god right from when i came into this message you asked pastor simon i was going to him and i was saying brother you know there there's i i just want to you know do this and and serve the lord and and there's these things in my life that i gotta get rid of and i'm just gonna i'm just gonna do it that's it i'm gonna get rid of this i'm gonna get right he says whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa settle down thank god i had a pastor that had wisdom and knew exactly that god he's the author and he's the finisher he starts the work and word upon word you heard the quote upon word upon word and before you know it god is going to have you exactly where he wants you to be you know one of the you know god supernaturally he delivered me from an addiction from from from drugs a very powerful drug of cocaine that was a miracle you understand that was a miracle that god knew he had to do that to catch my attention because that was it wasn't brother branham that caught my attention it was it was that that that that gentleman right there five foot seven well you look that tall [Applause] and it wasn't even him but god was speaking through those lips the night that i came into that little white church and was talking about that prostitute at the well and the life that she was living and everything and and god was speaking lip to ear i could hear the voice of god i was trying to hide my tears gabriel sitting next to me there i was going oh my god he's going to think i'm a wussy but that's the power of god that's what god wanted to do that was god calling and placing in a certain time in season and you can look back on your own life god knows when he needs to do miracles and then god knows that little by little shall i deliver them [Applause] it's just god's ways we don't need to try to figure him out but but once that supernatural element and communication comes between you and the word you can never be the same you'll never be the same person you will you will be different people will know that you are different you just need to be in their presence and they know there's something different about you why because of his presence it's not something you did it's not something you deserve it's not something that oh well i worked it up no but when you become mature and you come into this this time of your life and this time in season to walk with god and he's and he's saying to you i'm calling you to take your position is because in that body it's going in a rapture and he needs each and every one of us to be positionally placed in that body so that he can lift it off the earth you see and your position might just be in the church vacuuming but on that day right around 9 00 am when that love sweep comes down i don't care what you're going to be doing wherever you are you're going to feel the power and the anointing and the presence of god and in a moment and in a twinkling of an eye you are going to be changed and right there and then you're going to be brother sister hallelujah it's just it's going to happen that quick but it's already in progress like we heard pastor simon saying the rapture is already in progress when we actually leave here it will be finished hallelujah you know everything has preparation everything is and and we've already been pulled out of the world we've already been called out of the world glory to god amen let's look at the next slide finding your position step one ephesians chapter one we're going to close here in like 10 minutes according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will and to the praise of the glory of his grace aren't you thankful that that that god saw you and what and has a position for you that he listen the word was from the beginning and you were in him in the beginning when he condescended down and it wasn't abraham that was him in abraham expressing himself as the father of nations when he went down into joseph that was him expressing himself as jesus christ going to the cross and then being seated at the right hand of the father it was always him when he was there in joseph you were there [Music] you were there a portion of you was in joseph right because he was the word and you are in christ so you were represented there all the time but yet it wasn't your time in season to be manifest it was joseph's time in season to manifest the word it's always been the word the whole entire bible is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever everything was in the mind of god before before we were in his mind before we became word bible written word but you have a position in the word when he went down through joseph went down through all of the other patriarchs came down through malachi came down into uh elijah john the baptist when he was fulfilling all those and when jesus came to the earth you were in him you were the word in him but it was not your season yet to express your part in the word it was his time his season but he was showing how he was going to express himself in this day because everything was a type and a shadow of exactly what he was going to do when he would come into your time in your season as the bride the church the woman that's going to express jesus christ when he went to the cross and he pinned himself to the cross you were justified the same moment that he died he was wounded for our transgressions by his stripes we are healed you see it's you you need to know who you are you need to know your the authority that you've been given as a son or a daughter of god in this day everything that you were justified already back there we're going to be looking at some other things here on wednesday night but you're already justified you're sitting there and you know oh brother i gotta find my position i don't know what my position is you know i'm still dealing with this little thing in my life i'm still dealing with this little condemnation god's attribute cannot sin the word that is in you that is god cannot sin he saw beyond that he already saw beyond that so why are you condemning yourself come to the self-realization get up and get into your position god will do the rest everything that you have need of was already in the attribute of god you're trying to be something you know like you it's like when you talk to people and they say oh you know danny i know you go to church you know that's so good you know i wish i could go to church but i got a lot of things that i got to get rid of first before i go to church they got it backwards they got it completely backwards i tell them i said whoa whoa wait you need to come and hear the word of god and when you hear the word of god you're going to hear truth and the scripture says truth sets you free you need you need something more powerful than your own ability because i'm sorry to tell you but you keep doing what you're doing you're going to keep getting what you got you need to change what you're doing you know i used to hear it all the time one person said it to me one time he says you do what you got to do when you got to do it the day's going to come that you can do what you want to do when you want to do it and you know i come to realize that without the holy ghost that can become satanic with the wrong because men become prideful when they get too much money when they get you know too much popularity you know it just it just satan's loves that he loves to watch people that are starting to raise up popularity money this and that he he's just waiting for that individual he wants to be right there and he wants to infect them he wants to get them perverted he wants to get him from going from one wife to three wives he wants to you know use their money to to do all the wrong things you see but not god when god gets into your life and he desires you'll fight those things don't get me wrong you will have to deal with with with what comes with human popularity and human financial uh uh prosperity and all those things you'll get tested in all those things but greater is he that is in you greater is he that is in you when you become conscious of god in your life let the musicians come when you become so conscious of god in your life the things that you are doing that you know god is watching you know god can see god knows you god knows your situation but he sees you through the blood he sees you through the blood isn't that something miraculous that's that's the paradox saints one minute you're so condemned the next minute you're so blessed you can't figure out why but god's grace in your life because he wants to use you he wants to fulfill remember he wants to fulfill his word in you that's the whole purpose of the word coming to you the world is full of darkness but arise for thy light has come god bless you will be here on wednesday night to continue this by the grace of god you pray for me you pray for yourselves that the lord will speak and help you god has spoken to you in certain areas this morning i pray that you'll just say lord have your way i receive it have thine own way o god amen let's sing that have thine own way [Music] i am [Music] is [Music] me [Applause] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] i just
