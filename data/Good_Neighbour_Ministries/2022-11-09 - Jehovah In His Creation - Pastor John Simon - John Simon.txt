reading from verse 10. praise God glad to see all of you here tonight by the grace of God the weather and everything seems to be wonderful and looks like a marvelous season is shaping up as we go into the Christmas time praise the lord we give God the glory for that amen hallelujah now let's read uh he was in the world and the world was made by him the world knew him not he came onto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth the word was made flesh praise the Lord father we thank you so much for the reading of your word inspiring us and enlightening us and giving us strength for this hour that we may be fortified against the attacks of the enemy take praise Glory and Honor tonight as we spend some time around the sacrifice of your word and may you bless us all here tonight in Jesus name amen God bless you please be seated thank you foreign well last week we did have a wonderful time in the presence of the Lord hallelujah and uh uh if you remember we talked about the Christmas Fire book a man remembers that and the Christmas spiral was mainly talking about the in the street and what uh what a story that was well uh you know we really were speaking of Jesus being that Trump on the street Jesus was the one that did that and uh you see he had to die that he could bring us his gift that he wanted to give to us and the only way he could get it to us he had to die to bring that gift because you see like that shrimp that was on the street his daughter was not there in that Dimension that he was in she was in another dimension so to get from this one and to go to that one he have to die here so that he could take the gift of her over there he was the same because down from his glory ever living story my God and savior came and Jesus was his name to do what to bring to us eternal life now with understanding you know what I'm talking about we didn't know even what we had or anything like that but praise God hallelujah amen so he you see for him to be able to uh to get us to attract our attention to open our understanding he could not come here as a perfect man he couldn't do it so he had to die so that he could get us to believe amen praise God brother Branham so you see he had to die to get the gift of God to you amen and that's in capitals here because he recognized when he's talking about that what that is he he had to die to get the gift of God to you now let me go uh to where many sermons where he says the greatest gift you can give to God is yourself amen Surrender Your Light surrender yourself give it to God now reverse that the greatest gift that he could have given to you is what himself and that is what he did he gave himself to you so he had to die to give himself to you praise be to God hallelujah see like the had to die to get a little dog to his girl but now Christ have to die to get God to you and I just wrote in little letters his bride he had to die to get his life to you praise God tonight I'm speaking briefly on Jehovah in his creation praise the Lord now we know uh fundamentally that Jesus Christ is God for it was Jehovah for the purpose of which I'm speaking that came down and lived in a human body amen hallelujah it's and it's very very hard for some people to understand but a Jehovah the great Jehovah the god of creation the god of Eternity came down and created a body for himself amen so as John 1 14 says and their word was made flesh praise God now knowing that the word of God is eternal that word was made flesh it was temporarily made temporary you understand in other words he of Eternal came down temporarily to be in time as the Bible said that he could be tempted with the same Temptations you're tempted with tested with the trials and the there is no temptation common to man the Bible says that he did not go through so that he could be a high priest that is touched with the feeling of our infirmities now uh just uh today uh my dear wife was talking with somebody and they said oh uh such and such a person has this pain in this part of their body they have this sickness or whatever she said oh I know about that I used to have that but thank God I'm free from it but right away that person when somebody actually had the same thing and they know the pains the trials that go along with it they know this is somebody that's not just talking they can really empathize they understand it amen so he is a high priest that had every Temptation coming to man so the scripture says therefore he can be touched with the feelings of our weaknesses sicknesses problems trials infirmities he can be touched amen that's why we say the great physician now is near the sympathizing Jesus the droopy he Stoops the drooping heart to cheer you see he's took down to earth the drooping heart to cheer oh hear the voice of Jesus Christ so Jehovah literally came to Earth in the form of the man Christ Jesus and Christ Jesus or Jesus Christ was a creation of God and God lived in his creation amen we know generally God is God is in nature God is all around us and praise God in this case because it was a work that he had to do a tree couldn't do it a horse a fish nothing else could do it he had to come and live in a man amen so as a man he could carry out the great task that he has praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen praise God no wonder we use the term the fullness of God was in him in other words God as a for a prophet has said in Christ is a mystery for all God was he poured into Christ Hallelujah when he came to Earth he poured himself into Christ and now Christ went to Calvary he died for our sins and now Christ forced all of himself into his bride his true church he pours out of himself say praise God so he lives in me he lives in you he lives in his beloved elect lady his life is in her this life animation vivifies her glory to God hallelujah you see he was the creator he was God and now he made himself a being of the Earth in other words a being of time which means that have to have a beginning to become a creature of time this man that he had created the physical body that had to have a beginning in other words rather timeline is going to be born another time it's going to die right that had to be like that therefore he created himself a body to live him God live in God himself created a body for himself see yes and by doing that by this creation then he could go and save the rest of the Lost creation that he had created amen praise be to God how wonderful the Simplicity of the Gospel amen that God is giving to us praise God this is what the Christmas story is all about it's not about Santa Claus and all these things uh that's where the eyes the bells the whistles the tinsels the the the the green trees and all of that it's nice for the human being and the senses and stuff like that but for the soul that is what he come and he died for our sins in that way and we give him glory praise God no he said let me say this there is nothing that a man can annihilate there isn't one thing that he could actually annihilate you can do nothing to completely destroy anything you may take a piece of paper burn it up you might get crazy burned on a building you may burn up trees right you didn't and he let them see oh my the fire may break you may even hear them chemicals they're bursting and popping they're only turning right back to what they were in the beginning praise the lord they're going back to what they were praise the Lord hallelujah they're not inhalated amen if we lived in eternity like God hallelujah then the fire only takes it back to its original beginning praise God hallelujah that's why I keep saying over and again we are going back where we come from nothing nothing can destroy us nothing can hinder us amen we're going right back where we come from no either burn you at the stake Hallelujah that you're going back where we come from that cannot destroy anything that is why Jesus could speak with confidence and say you destroy this body and I'll raise it up again in three days he was God that's right he said I will raise it up in three days praise the Lord because they can't really destroy it hallelujah amen it has to go back when the breakings of those atoms and so forth takes place then it's go straight back to where it was praise the Lord hallelujah no matter what they do praise God now you can flex your arms brother Bill you can be a modern day Superman glory to God but not a man a steel a man of Life a man of the Holy Spirit praise God hallelujah amen see now understand you cannot annihilate anything because it's all God's spoken word in other words he spoke it all into existence he spoke the first three and then everything replicates and so what we're looking at is what he's talking about he didn't say all of that here but this is what we're looking at we're everything you see around you in other words it's God spoken word amen and they said oh we blew it up we we dropped a nuclear bomb we destroy it uh we're gonna destroy the entire world and everything else no whether Brands and future home eventually uh Heavenly bride and the Earth the Heavenly the Earthly bride and Heavenly bridegroom he says they're only going to uh judge themselves and burn up themselves they're only going to cleanse the Earth so that the bride can come back and come down on it but he says they can't destroy God's spoken word that is eternal it cannot change his word stands forever amen praise God and it says it right here he says see whatever God says stands forever and he says amen just like brother coffee Hallelujah because you cannot inhalate it Hallelujah and praise God not even this body because we are part of the earth and we can never be completely annihilated amen oh yes but the soul that sinner it shall die it shall be annihilated in other words he's saying there only God can and heal it totally anything only God can do that praise God you say well where do you get well Jesus said it he says fear not him nothing just kill your body but fear him that can kill both Body and Soul Amen in other words he can destroy Body and Soul completely praise be to God hallelujah amen but you see that's the way it is and I thank God for that pray praise God now remember God created himself a body and therefore therefore this was the creator of all creation living in his creation the Creator living in his creation Jesus Christ his masterpiece the artists living in this piece of art praise God hallelujah and that's what he did so that by this creation he might save all them that were lost Hallelujah in his creation and then he puts here I am speaking about you and I who are made creatures of time praise the Lord but the Lord knoweth them that are his is that right the Lord look at them that are his he says uh uh I I haven't come for just everybody but I come for the lost sheep praise God hallelujah glory to God see he was the creator Hallelujah and he proved that he was because he was deity mid flesh then he went into talk he says now remember he was in other words he was trying to show them that though he was in flesh standing in the earth in front of them that he was that Creator from before the foundations of the world now standing before them in a human body that is why the brother Brandon was saying here see that is why he took a piece of bread and created bread that had already been bred because he had created the first he's going into that he created that so this one that would say oh he didn't create that well he created the first one and all those ones came down all the wheat and everything came down from what he created in the original so here it is and he broke and he broke see and it just multiplied he took a fish and and another fish came and another and another and another amen and more than that he he took water and from that water he made wine out of it amen and we see him in these last days Hallelujah then he took something that was bread fish or water and created something out of it but here in these last days without anything without anything standing there he created a squirrel praise God hallelujah where remember what I say here praise God where there was nothing and there was no squirrel see he created squirrels he he's showing here he does he says he and he passed and then he says remains God but what he's saying he is still showing that he is still the same God that was standing back there and multiplying them things he's showing I'm here now and I'm doing the same thing amen praise God and I'm doing it if not a higher level because out of nothing I'm creating something praise God that is why when sister had it right when he said this is what happened in the woods and and the squirrel just appeared like that and do you want another one says yes what and there was another one he said and I shot them it was the illusion imagination and he wants her to cook them anyway so here's and she said that's right brother Brandon I believe it praise God Hallelujah and right away that's when he turned around see that's where they don't differentiate and understand what was happening and said to her I give you what is it that you want anything you ask I can give it to you that's not brother Branham that's not the human part that was the great God Of Heaven speaking through the man and saying whatever you want whatever just like you said to Solomon whatever you want just tell me and I'm going to give to you whatever you want she said I want the salvation of my two boys he said then I give them to you amen your two boys the salvation of your two boys and uh you know the story they started shouting and screaming in the back of the house there and turned their lives over to God well who could save the souls but God himself who can do that that had to be God himself speaking through the man remember to be clear not just for you but those in the land of uh the internet that he was not showing trying to show the world that he William Branham was God and we do not believe William Branham who asked God but we do believe and understand that God was acting speaking doing moving and performing miraculous wonderful acts of of our signs wonders prophecies and the life on Parallel for this day and hour to display the our Lord had come back to earth again to manifest the scriptures that he the son of man was being and his being revealed in our day and in our time praise the Lord and we thank God for it hallelujah amen praise God you see he did that then he does this now and that what does that do his Works identifies who he is that he has killed a great Creator oh the great Creator became Our Savior oh praise God hallelujah he became his creation Hallelujah for that crowned his life's testimony that he was the creator praise be to God remember in the seals how I spoke that the whole creation was lost everything was gone everything belonged to Satan because he fell heir to it Adam gave up the title Deeds and he still owns it today he still does that's the reason we have to fight and to have so much trouble now because he controls every Kingdom on this Earth he controls every government on this Earth every king that's on this Earth every Kingdom is controlled by Satan the whole world is controlled and run by Satan and the Bible itself says so amen praise God hallelujah he controls the world but thank God Christ will fall heir to it for now he is a redeemer and he come to redeem the whole lost creation Hallelujah and no one could do that but God himself praise God hallelujah amen and now that's the reason why God now does nothing outside of using a man he will always work through a man praise the Lord see because first a man is what he used to display his great attribute of being a savior hallelujah amen so since he did that after making him in his image not physically but spiritually he made him something like that and he even put him back on free moral agency hallelujah praise God he's talking about Jesus now and at the same time we are lumped in there as part of him so when I'm speaking there you understand I'm talking about him the head him and the bride that comes out of him is speaking of both with the same voice amen said see that's the the reason he had to use a man is what he had to use to display his attribute of savior he had to make him in his image make him something like him see and then what does he do put him on free moral agency to let him act any way he wanted to act right any way he wanted to he could make his own choice but and he knew that man by giving him choice man could then fall when I praise God now this looks so simple to you but when I look at that I I really never caught that in that way that is the very thing that that these people are putting a whole lot of emphasis on I took Jesus as my savior I choose This Night To they don't understand you would you couldn't even do that really if you were not belonging to God from the very beginning amen because it's not us choosing this and not choosing that and the other praise God because God endless is bringing us back to himself you're just a piece of magnet off of the original lump and you're feeling the pull to go right back to where you were that's why he used illustrations like the great magnet in that factory and when it passed over in the roof of the factory all the small pieces that were in the bottom just flew up and stuck to it that's all he's trying to illustrate you got you are of the same material you come from above you're going back where you come from this world only come to attract your attention and bring you back to God where you for in the beginning amen hallelujah see that's the way it is praise the Lord hallelujah amen he did his work of redemption by a man death came first by a man but now life comes back by the second Adam praise God hallelujah Jehovah the deity Jehovah come down and become a child Oh Glory to God when they were looking for a messiah they thought they would have a general they thought they would have a mighty man they are the mightiest person but he come first in the form of a child that he God could be in flesh so Jehovah our creator manifested In the Flesh Hallelujah so being coming as a child he also could then be in the form of sin that he might redeem The Sinner he did not sin he commit no sin but he had to be in the form of sin and like a man that he could redeem man praise God hallelujah you know those things simply he couldn't use a horse to redeem a man nothing else was equivalent uh a fish a bird no matter what the sacrifice in the Old Testament it could not and there was no perfect human being so they even tried human sacrifices with them Gods like Baal and she emotion all these other ones and that doesn't work because no human being was sinless but then to to have a sinless man he created a body lived in the body and here is a sinless perfect lamb without spot without blemish could then go to Calgary and in the form of a man dying for the sins of man Lord of God hallelujah amen praise God I'm going to close this off here quickly now he says do you realize what we are doing here where did we come from or what business we have got being down here what business you got being done here you you should have stayed back there but you know we know what the scripture says God sent you down here for some purpose that which you consciously may not be aware of but by the time you finish this Earthly life you would have fulfilled that purpose you don't necessarily have to literally know your purpose you know it's good they have these books these tapes these things teaching you that but you don't consciously have to know what your purpose is because you're going to walk right into it by the holy spirit that dwells in your life praise the Lord amen we are not here to dramatize or or practice Christianity in a way where we have to know how to act so we can fulfill that purpose we'll let go and let God the Holy Spirit lead us guide us and move us into that Divine Purpose under a state of grace hallelujah praise God or say the other way under a condition of unconscious godliness where the spirit of God takes you into that condition and that position praise the Lord that you might fulfill his purpose amen we wasn't put here by chance praise God we were put here for a purpose and we must serve that purpose but still we are back on that free moral agency where we can serve him or we can reject just like Adam was in the beginning not words God wants to show to Satan that look I'm gonna put them down here in other words he's doing the same thing like he did with job and he puts us in that position says okay go try him all you want but he he's not gonna curse me why because he was a seed of God he was a gene of God and he couldn't do it so so God have confidence in job praise the Lord hallelujah not in the manual but in the gene that was in Job that there is no way that Satan is going to be able to attempt that or do this for the seed of God could not commit sin praise be to God hallelujah amen and so we see how God works through now today through human beings now it's gone from Jesus it's come down to his people his bride and that's what he wants to work through today it's you and me Iris hands his feet his body for him to make himself manifest he'll see and he has to do that working through human beings to redeem other human beings so he can take you and work through you to redeem all Humanity if you are completely dedicated to him in everything so who are the Messiah it's for this day it's not Jesus back there it's us here today God hiding in simplicity and revealing himself in the same this is what is happening God in this hour the work of redemption through his beloved bride Hallelujah my father working until now I'm working Jesus working until now we are working we are working by the Holy Spirit finishing the work of redemption praise the Lord you say oh Jesus said it's finished from Calvary but you'll find he's he he did not complete or do everything he had to do because you read the book of Acts and you read Parts where it says and they they were doing continuing to do what Jesus left for them to do they were doing continuing his work and the brother Brandon says it too he in in the Cults here praise the Lord I don't have that before me here but he says that praise the Lord so therefore if you're a woman dedicate your morals if you're a man dedicate your morals dedicate your minds dedicate your thinking dedicate your heart dedicate your soul dedicate all that you are and let Christ work through you oh what a glorious thing yes I know we have some more Rivers we have to cross we know we have bridges that we may have to go over but put all your mind and your thoughts on the North Star Jesus Christ the center of God and don't move from it stay right with it and it will bring you straight to Christ just like it did when it went to the Meiji praise the Lord God bless you all here tonight and bless these few words to your hearts my heart and we recognize him they dumb from his glory can we come brother and sing that and and then we are dismissed from this place and I pray that that will Empower you straighten you for the rest of the week praise the Lord Hallelujah not only for the rest of week for a lifetime praise God because somewhere up the road you'll remember oh I remember brother Simon said this or that it's just these gems these germs just drop and they fall where God wants them to fall praise the Lord [Music] read [Music] my God and savior and Jesus Christ [Music] [Music] [Applause] oh I [Music] know my breath My Sunshine [Music] the great creates baby [Music] gave myself and all those [Music] wide what God is [Music] Redemption I understand [Music] God's gracious yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] my breath My Sunshine [Music] the grace [Applause] [Music] amen your dismissed [Music]
