TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] this is the day the Lord has made let us rejoice in it and be glad the Lord bless you my brothers and sisters Lord bless you friends it's good to be here on this Sunday morning giving glory and praise and honor to him that is worthy of all praise may God bless us all richly as we go into the word of God now as you may remember that in my past two sermons I preached on the subject of our changing world in doing this I used two scriptures as texts Daniele - 19 - 20 - which I will now read and it reads us now for the background the King had a dream he could not remember his dream asked his wise men and they were stopped they could not tell him or give him the interpretation Daniel was asked and he said to the king he couldn't give him an answer until he talked to his God so Daniel went and prayer with the other three Hebrew boys and during the night God revealed to him the answer and now let us pick it up from here then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision then Daniel blessed the God of heaven Daniel answered and said blessed be the name of God for ever and ever for with and might are his and he changed at the times and the seasons he removeth kings and setteth of kings he giveth wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to them that no understanding and he revealeth the deep and secret things he knoweth what is in the darkness and the light dwells with him let us pray dear God our righteous and great Heavenly Father we thank you for your love your grace and mercy may your great Holy Spirit descend upon us today wake Oh Lord awaken Zion and let the word of God go forth in the name of Jesus Christ we asked for divine approval for your glory in Jesus name Amen and amen now as I said I use two scriptures the phrase from the first scripture Daniele chapter 2 verses 19 to 22 he changes the times I also use the scripture out of Ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 1 for everything there is a season and a time for every purpose under heaven now I related the fact that from Adam and Eve right on down truly great corners of history unto 19:06 Azusa Street Pentecostal revival the world has been changing the last but unrecognized change was from the denominational the dision age to the agent time of the revealed Word of God now I have repeatedly emphasized that it was William Marion Breeland of Kentucky who God used as his prophet messenger his voice his signpost and his instrument for dispensational change I pointed out that the appearing of this 20th century prophet this Messenger of God signal the head writing on the wall as it was tongues in the time of Daniel written on the wall unknown towns were written on the wall at Belshazzar's feast today we witness the raising type of of these unknown towns in our day and in our time yes symbol of the blessing of the Holy Spirit also a symbol of judgment to come the handwriting again is up on the wall signaling the ending of the Gentile dispensation time for the Jewish Wrigleyville time for their Renaissance time for their unstoppable restoration time for them to enter into their inheritance time for global power and unparalleled influence how are they going to achieve this I do not know but it must be by the mighty hands of Jehovah that this is going to be this will come about God in his own wisdom and grace knows how to handle these situations time for their testing and time for their blessing for God's victory must blew and lost blossom and bloom and produced bountifully the fruits that God expects firm for them to produce so that when he comes again he'll find as I've said sweet fruit fruit that being sweetened under the hot Sun of trial and testing fruit that's been sweetened in the hot Sun of August spiritually speaking under the sign of Leo and the power and the presence of Almighty God oh yes for the Gentile people it will be right now it's pre tribulation time it's a sealing time and it's a rapture time the entire church is in anticipation and heart rubbing expectation of the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ to take his waiting brain away no this is not the end of the world this may friend that me repeat is not the end of the world it's it is just a bend in the history of the world it's a corner a turning point a time of change a time of spiritual change a time of religious change aa time of socio-economic change taking place right now and in particular we are experiencing a generational change oh praise God our world system is in birth pangs it's literally screaming screaming to give birth to a new age it was a new age to be born and so we see the convulsions the contortions we see my friends all these things that are taking place in the world and in the church in every area instructor of human life things are taking place that ought to arrest your attention that something is happening and that something else is fixing to take place yes sir whenever any woman is giving birth it's a dangerous thing for that woman because surely we know she's between death and life always dangerous always obtain when we are left with bated breath waiting to hear the baby's crying even so this world is in that kind of a state going through all manner of pains and changes to bring forth a new age to be born we hear and feel the beating pulse of the cosmos there is a spiritual earthquake going on I feel the tectonic plates of time are moving the pillar of fire is also moving and we must move along with the light of God or we will be left in total darkness if the modern day Church wants to stay stuck in the 7th l'audition church age and not listen to the voice of the mighty angel of revelation 10 one who used the instrumentality of Revelation 10 7 the 7th church age messenger zan my friends the light of God Ichabod is written across your doorpost the glory of God is departed and the Spirit of the Lord goes and seeks for him in that are not bound within denominational systems and and walls and tied up into all manner of wisdom and knowledge of man and the various psychologies and stuff of that nature of man but they are free to worship and praise him by the instruction guidance leadership and witness of the holy spirit of the Living God well have we heard the words of this song our God is marching on and the father said as Laureus as might have been the bass as glorious as they claim of Moses you're my zekiel even the time of the Apostles listen to Paul Paul tells us clearly that we are not to look back at the things of the past Oh Florida God hallelujah but the press to the mark of the high calling which is in Jesus Christ to look to the things that are before us look to the age that's emerging that's right before us absolutely friends political changes going on generational change is going on and the old world systems have to die so that a new world order or a new world system can be born where the two cannot exist together at the same time now there is a shifting not only of the system but there is a shifting of the roles the responsibilities and the rights it's now falling on the shoulders of our young people we must be aware of this and accept the change some are fighting tooth and nail with their entire life and future they're fighting to preserve or to resurrect fast memories of past past cultures civilizations and so on my friends you can't go forward by looking backwards and we be the only one of the animals I can identify that jumps forward ones looking backwards is mainly a frog and flies may have that ability to but only frogs do that and so let's look to the future let's look into tomorrow and see what tomorrow holds for me now his eye is on the spero and we know who holds tomorrow and so we have no fear no doubt but we press to that mark to the glory and praise of God so let me repeat some are fighting tooth and nail to preserve memories of the past they have in their minds memories of the past and they want to go back to those good old days but those good old days are past there now in the halls of memory and you can't find joy happiness or heat by trying to warn yourself at the painted fire of your memory remember this my friends fast memories can never return because in fact the spiritual and moral arc of the universe is on the move Matthew chapter 21 verse 44 Luke chapter 20 verses 17 to 18 as clearly saying to us that if we try to hinder and turn back my friends they move of God and the changing of the tidings and of the age that rejected stone will soon become a millstone and Isis scripture says it shall grind you or anything or anyone that is in its thick train to hinder it it will grind you to powder says the word of the Living God amen so we have we have seen here various junctions of time and now we are caught up in the convulsive truce of change which is always pitiful and painful now under the cover of copán 19 satan with his earthly associates whoever they are have been testing out the limits or the extent of their powers here upon the earth now it's prophesied in Revelation chapter 13 verse 11 that a day is coming when people will not be able to buy or sell without permission from these higher powers now this is written in the Bible this has been written and prophesied in your Bible over about two thousand years ago that a day was coming when people will not be able to buy or sell except by permission from higher powers now for this past three months we are literally experienced just that that we could hardly buy or sell or go anywhere or do anything or visit or whatever you could not do it simply as not the simple partial fulfillment of the Word of God for this is not the fulfillment of it but is a sign of things to come and of things that are certainly going to be now what is this man this now my friends was Satan and his Satan and his evil pernicious associate it's doing a dry run a worldwide experiment or test of how this will work during the time of tribulation or the Tribulation Period when he comes into a position of power which will be a time when none will be able to bind nor sell or any commercial enterprise without the mark of that Mystery Babylon Beast system spoken of in Revelation 13 now there's another test or trying run that is going on it's the test to see and observe their testing right now as we speak you're in this covered 19 situation using that NASA as a cover as an excuse as a clock so that they may be able to test out and to give a dry run of how a cashless society would work now helps we see the rise of digital currencies we see the rise of crypto currency virtual currencies now once these new currencies prove themselves that they are usable and that they after being conditioned become acceptable to the public secure for the banks and the higher powers and profitable for those who have vested interests that will be when does that the day when the physical dollar cash dies that's the day the dollar dies many many men have written and spoken on this matter many great men have foreseen this name spoken of this day written of this thing and they have died and passed and gone to their reward in the presence of God but the Word of God marches on the Word of God moves on and they sell it back man and did not happen in their day oh oh but no this is the day that we are living in when we will be able to witness fulfillment of Scripture and not just listen to prophecy but be a part of that prophecy and watch it as these digital currencies come into prominence my friends and when they are pronounced legal and lawful and acceptable and profitable and secure that will be the day that the physical dollar dies it will be the end of cash now friends there are now lots of tests there's lots of pilot programs going on right now while we're speaking in various countries of and betting chips into the hands and into the bodies of citizens are you listening to me friends o hear the word of God hallelujah right now ah it's a voluntary but later it will become compulsory and if you do not you want be able to access your own digital money your digital accounts you would be able my friends then to be able to buy nor sale unless you're permitted access to your own accounts your own money or your own will now this is going on right now I've seen it where certain countries the some people are embracing it with joy and say oh I have it in my hand I just have to wave it over the the machine or I just have to wave it in front of my door or whatever and there it is and so it's being tested at a high rate right now around the world not just one country many countries some countries are making it public but they're doing it others are doing it quite quietly and certissue Slee behind the scenes but it is taking place while we yet speak my friends want you to know that it will be you will let me be literally forced by law or new laws that are coming to accept this microchip in your body now this microchip will make you locatable to them it will provide them with the ability to serve and you two never know where you are at any given moment and time thus you will be trackable GPS all that stuff will be built right in to that chip there will be nowhere on earth that you will be able to run hide or avoid Big Brother that will be watching over you and being more capable being under surveillance trackable means that the entire world will be the place where it's controllable be the place where it can be manipulated it's frightening my friends but every single individual on the face of the earth will have to accept their National micro chip with all its capabilities of monitoring you its capabilities of surveilling you 24/7 it will mine to you in the streets it will monitor you in your very hopes it will monitor monitor you as it is already doing to a miniscule way online on the web whatever you doing it'll be crystal clear and you will be monitored in a magnified way on the web friends what are you listening to modern events are now being made clear by vindicated prophecy in the fulfillment of the Word of God and we are living in this season and as spoken of in the Word of God last Wednesday as I was teaching on the seventh Church ages I also mentioned how that the Bible said two witnesses will come to Israel which will be Moses and Elijah and the Scriptures clearly says that all the world will be able to see them and hear what they're saying they'll be killed in the streets of Jerusalem but the Bible tells us in three days other Lord will raise them up again and all the world shall behold his mighty hand my dear friends that was one of the indications of television of the internet the ability to be able to see a happening around the entire world instantly at the same time is in your Bible prophesied and spoken of in the Bible my friend let me say this to you well people look upon these prophets these messages of God as simpletons are men that the rugged man with her not knowledgeable not sophisticated not dignified in the way that man called dignity and all of that but they don't need such things all they need is for the wisdom of the Living God to flow through them all they need stuff to be able to surrender themselves so the Spirit of the mighty God could use them for his glory so when they are opposed you are not opposing the wisdom or knowledge of the man whether he is very knowledgeable earnest knowledge is miniscule that's not what you're really fighting or opposing you're opposing the ocean of the unfathomable infinite wisdom and power the holy spirit that feels true that servant of the Most High God amen yes sir I tell you now my friends that you will have to accept the mark of the beast you either accept them mark of the beast or you have to take the seal of God there is no time to lose while there is yet time to act choose which site you are on Joshua said I am my house we will serve the Lord my friends let it be clear to you that you must take that mark of the beast another time you will speak about that mark and what it literally is all my friends or you have to take the seal of God some say it's the Sabbath day some say the seat of God is one of slag is waved over you some say the seal of God is when you receive the right hand of fellowship some say the seal of God is when you have church membership in their particular church but according to the Word of God the seal of God is the Holy Spirit for the Apostle Paul said clearly use must not grieve the Holy Spirit by which you are sealed unto the day of your Redemption so the Holy Spirit Himself is the seal of the Living God hallelujah friends why don't you accept God's microchip instead of man's chips why don't you accept God's peace of himself a part of peace a ton of fire the holy spirit a piece of the pillar of fire a piece from off of the masterpiece may ask him to come dwell and rule and have preeminence over your life and surrender all to him will you be a unbeliever a church member or your a message believer I ask you today to make a deeper commitment and walk with God as a great servant prophet of God has said Christian do you want to be a new Christian Oh friends come up into the perfect work clean Jacob's Ladder and have the spirit of a lake of bringing revelation for you from the presence of God up and down praise God until you become a filling station of inspiration with the anointing of the Holy Spirit working and moving in a miraculous and wonderful way praise God hallelujah amen you don't have to except a man-made ship in your hands amen you don't have to accept a sonship a banya for it or in some other part of your body that's just a natural sign of the real thing coming the real thing is more spiritual it's not just a natural thing like a number written on you or something of that nature as many think it's spiritual it's supernatural and it will be their friends oh my friends think about it hallelujah accept the part of God's life in you hallelujah to be sealed by the Holy Spirit the day of redemption oh praise God have you ever heard a song by Quicksilver that says he lives in me he lives in me he to me the God of all Hitler he lives in me thanks Peter God how wonderful to know that he lives in us and the true believer can be the habitation of God by the indwelling of the Blessed Holy Spirit praise God I belong to Jesus with that chip with that piece of the pillar of fire in me I can say I belong to Jesus and Jesus belongs to me if you take or when you take the microchip of your country or your government that microchip will provide them with every detail of your entire life even to the moles on your body it will provide them with every detail about you from the time you were born to the present time that microchip has ever for said will look at you and know where you are at every given moment whether asleep sleeping or away it will also

certification and guarantee that you are a genuine citizen of your nation or government and that you belong to them and that they have all right powers and the jurisdiction over you now the microchip that is in me is different it's absolutely and totally different for it's a beast as I've said on the pillar of fire it's a piece or a chip a sniffing piece that broke off from the masterpiece it's a part of the Holy Spirit of Almighty God to the elect this this microcosm of God himself indwelling the believer this mighty microchip of God well also come to identify you of who you are yes sir the Holy Spirit searching for sons and daughters will be able to identify you look at you and certify that you're a genuine certified seat child of the Living God through the instrumentality of a spoken word of the Living God it will also mark you and seal you that you are citizens of the Commonwealth of grace and you are not from time but you come from eternity you're just passing through time and
