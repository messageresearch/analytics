you Saints amen glory to God you may be seated just for a moment Hallelujah we thank God for uh his grace and bringing us together this morning in The Fellowship of the Holy Spirit I believe that um the Lord wants to um unveil some things to us this morning um he just uh had me moving in a certain direction this week and uh I'm kind of excited so let's see what the Lord's going to do but in the meantime um I just want to remind everybody that we'll have brother kidy Diggs Minister for us this Wednesday okay I'd like everybody to be here amen praise God so if there's a way that you can be here we'll see you here Wednesday night amen we want to support the ministry and I believe the Lord will bless us and pour out a nice special blessing um we will be doing Lord's Supper um the very first Sunday of November um so just keep that in mind you will get a notice Lord's Supper foot washing uh we will do that uh the very first Sunday in November amen praise God and so let's go to the word of God this morning um you can go to the first slide there this morning um the Lord has led me this week to uh to speak on the church and Israel and uh you know I was inspired when I was doing a little bit of research about Israel being God's time piece I came across this quote here where brother Bram is speaking in um in recognizing your day in its message and I found it interesting but it struck me he says now my my subject this morning is recognizing your day and its message we see from last Sunday's lesson as we taught the Feast of the trumpets and I want to call to your attention now the time he says time of Israel In God's Time piece and that's where I drew my title from um I was inspired by that he goes on and he says now he says we are dealing today upon a Sunday school lesson that I want you to realize and recognize the time that we're living He says we're just about to run out as you see and then by this you should know the very hour and time and sign and message that you are to receive now as we started last Sunday we had been speaking on going to preach on the trumpets the last seven trumpets of the Bible and me in myself I thought they would Break Forth just like the seals but I've noticed on each one of these openings there has been a tremendous thing happening happening he and he was talking about how when you know when when the seals were open how the Holy Spirit was revealing everything that was under each one of those seals and um he realized that that something tremendous was happening and as we preached the seven Church ages and they were so perfectly until the Holy Spirit himself come down Among Us and Vindicated it and put it upon the papers and throwed it across the nation and and showed it in the moon in the heavens and proved it to us weeks and months before it happened that's just the way it would be perfectly and so notice here and and what you know I want to draw your attention to is how the Holy Spirit had shown him uh these things and what was happening in the midst of while he was ministering these trumpets and all around recog izing your day all around Israel as God's time piece and so he he continues here and he says here as the Holy Spirit was writing it here in the Tabernacle he made it known here on in the time he made it known on the moon and the sun he made it known and in the position of the Nations at this time and I want I want you to you know pay attention here pay attention and and take this and apply it to the day and the hour that we're living in and what he's saying here to the Nations at this time he made it known as the hierarchy of Rome left and went back to Palestine supposedly had been the first pope back since they claimed Peter being the pope which we know he wasn't now it was so tremendous that we see before the Seven Seals that that hid all the Mysteries me not knowing what I was drawing on the board for the church ages I never God knows just by Vision I draw it not knowing that God a year and six months later was going to vindicate it in the skies by the moon and slip it across the national papers I didn't know that I didn't know there would be a mysterious blackout in the moon to represent this Leo Dean age and so you know all these thoughts started to go through my mind of you know what we've experienced this year and what took place you know um when we had the uh the lunar eclipse the solar eclipse amen um just several months ago and how the Holy Spirit was revealing you know how he shows signs in the heavens before he reflects and manifests and brings to pass things upon the Earth and so this all just you know was breaking open this week and Saints we'll see where it's going to take us all I can say is that you know the bride is is moving in Prophecy the church is moving in Prophecy she is fulfilling prophecy in this day and in this hour and when when we look at what's going on amongst the Nations and in the world we see prophecy being fulfilled but you know a lot of people like we've heard many times they look back to see what the Lord did they're looking forward to see what the Lord is going to do but fail to recognize and see what it what it is that he is doing right now and and that's what we're excited about the Church of this hour recognizes by Perfect faith that the spirit of God is in their midst amen is in the midst of the church speaking lip to ear through the foolishness of preaching by a five-fold Ministry in this day and in this hour and that we can receive and and hear uh instruction Direct directly from the Lord amen directly from God what he's doing now are you excited I'm excited about what the Lord is doing now amen let's all stand and we'll go to our scripture so that's how um we're where we're at right now our scripture comes from Daniel CH 12 verses 9 to 12 and he said go thy Way Daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end many shall be purified and made white and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly now I want you to see what's what you know what he's saying here what you know things just pop out when when I'm reading the scripture and he says that many shall be purified and made white and tried I believe that that's been going on this is what we've been experiencing the church is being purified being uh you know our purging and our purification happens now that's why the church does not go into the Great Tribulation amen the church goes up in a Rapture amen so he says here but the wicked shall do wickedly in other words the wicked and all those spirits and powers and principalities and dominions that are doing what they're doing in the earth and the wickedness and the evil that's going on is just going to go on that's right as it is yes but we are we are uh been uh uh been given the eyes to see and to recognize and the ears to hear what it is that the Lord is revealing to us in the midst of all of this evil and none of the wicked shall understand they're not going to know what they're doing because they are fulfilling scripture they are fulfilling the word of God Amen but the wise shall understand we're going to be given the ability and the spirit of Revelation to understand and to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God and from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away and the Abomination that maketh desolate set up there shall be a th 290 days blessed is he that waiteth and cometh to the 1,3 530 days the Lord add His blessings to the word thank you Father we thank you so much we ask that your spirit of faith and revelation will stir and move in the heart of the speaker and in the hearts of the hearers Lord speak to us this morning make clear what it is that you would want us to know we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you Saints you may be seated you know when you look uh um it it talks about that when the the you know the the time of the Abomination when that does come that it'll be a about 3 and 1/2 years after that that um you know that it'll be three and a/2 years of the Great Tribulation that'll be ushered in and it'll be at that time that we will have left this Earth before that happens we will have left this earth and the world goes into three and a half years of Great Tribulation and God deals directly with Israel amen and then Israel receives their Awakening now the next scripture I'll just read it for you 2 Corinthians 3: 12-18 it says seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech and our hope is Christ if you go back and you read you know 2 Corinthians chapter 3 he's talking about the great hope that that's been revealed to us which is Jesus Christ but he says and God is Moses which put a veil over his face that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished they could not see what was coming they could not because God blinded them they were blinded to the Messiah amen so they couldn't see what it is that you and I are seeing in Christ but their minds were blinded for until so this day remaineth the same Veil untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament which Veil is now done away in Christen see our our our our blindness was lifted when Christ came and died for our sins went to the cross and brought his Spirit back upon us so that we could be awakened to know who we are amen so our blindness was lifted 2,000 years ago the Gentile church because Israel was blinded so that God could take a people for his name and that's why we've received the name of Jesus Christ because we are the wife of the groom Jesus Christ amen praise God but even unto this day when Moses is read the veil is upon their heart they're still blind they're still blind to recognize their Messiah but they're not going to be blind for long and we can see that that this blindness is going to be lifting if not already starting to just you know show signs of lifting based on the faith that they're displaying nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away when God decides to turn it to them when he decides that the Holy Spirit his his spirit is going to uh turn to the nation of Israel there will be an unblinding take place now the Lord is that Spirit without the Holy Ghost there is no Awakening because without the word there is no Awakening without the Lord there is no Awakening without the father there is no understanding there is no Awakening we know that they all represent Christ the word amen and so where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty but we all with face open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord aren't you glad that the holy spirit is speaking to us aren't you glad that he's lifted the veil from you and that now when the word of God is preached and you hear the word it it just makes sense it just stirs your heart it just it allows you to read the word of God and and the understanding just just comes from the word it just it just it becomes plain and simple to you aren't you grateful for that amen what a wonderful ful Revelation and time for the for the True Church of Jesus Christ and so when we look at the scriptures that we've read and we we look at from Genesis to revelation we should be able to see Jesus Christ from Genesis to Revelation when when when he's talking about Israel and he's talking about the Jews we should be able to see ourselves everything is prophetically uh in the scripture and when you hear Pro uh you know prophecy of Israel you should see where it applies to you amen you should see how it applies to the day and the hour that you're living in you should see how it applies to the Nations that are now you know uh in public View and what's happening globally and across the world and amen Israel is a prophetic time piece when we look at Israel we see Israel in battle and you can know that the church is in battle Israel is just a small little Nation the true church is just a small group of people it's always been a small group of people when Jesus was on the earth it was only a handful that actually recog recognized the word made flesh before them it's always been a small group and it's going to be a small group right to the end and we're a part of that small group because we've been given ears to hear we've been given the spirit of Revelation to understand the word of God for this day and for this hour Israel is a minority the true church is a minority Israel is being rejected because she is a chosen people the true church is being rejected because she is chosen as the Bride of Jesus Christ amen people don't like to hear that there's a chosen Church yeah but it's the truth it's directly from the word amen he says my sheep hear my voice and so how can people that that hear his voice have different inter interpretations on the word of God it's impossible once the spirit of God comes into you as an individual there is no way that you can deny the word of God you cannot have a different interpretation because it's the spirit of Truth in you that interprets the word amen thank you Jes Hallelujah when you truly understand that the Lord never changes his word about any that he says then you can trust 100% that the Lord will keep his word the Lord doesn't change that's why we stand where we stand amen because we know that the Lord will not change his mind about his word hallelujah and so just laying in that as a background I want you to understand where our thought is coming from today is that we're looking at the church we're looking at Israel and we're looking at it in relevance to God's time piece we know that God uh that Israel is God's time pieace but the bride also represents God's time pieace when the bride receives rapturing Faith which he's now under for a body change and the church is raptured that's going to be another sign to this earth that God's time piece is moving on amen amen and so we are represented in all of that and so today how many re how many realize that we're in the the festive Feast the Jewish feast um of rash hashana amen amen well these feasts are the peak of the high holidays of the Jewish people amen it started actually on October the 2nd and it's going to end on October the 12th with yam Kapur yes which is the time of atonement and so during that time the Jewish people go into a great time of feast and also a great time of reflection rashash Shana represents the new year it represents the creation of the universe to the Jews it represents Adam and Eve the creation back in the Garden of Eden and we know how it represents Adam and Eve we know how it represents the church Christ and the church Eve we know that all of this is part of God's Plan of Redemption you know the Jewish people have a a a a real you know genuine understanding of the word of God but they were blind it purposely not to recognize the Messiah so that we could receive our sight amen now what takes place during this festive time is the blowing of the chofar and you know listen to brother brandom here he speaks here he says now watch notice and the Lord spake Moses saying also in the 10th day of the seventh month there shall be a day of atonement notice 10th day seventh month atonement is to recognize Messiah 10 7 Revelations 10:7 was our time to recognize Messiah that he would unveil himself to us just in the same way that that as we progress the Messiah Jesus Christ will unveil himself to Israel and but listen he says but see the atonement followed watch now the atonement followed the trumpet sound see how beautiful see the atonement day followed the trumpet now the 50 days of the trumpets for us symbolize when the trumpet sounded at Pentecost we know that what that represented which was the 50 days now now after this the Jews rejected so in the time when Christ came to us to reveal himself to us they rejected the Messiah but they were blinded to do so but here now after this the Jews rejected that now the trumpets is to call them back to that atonement see the atonement they rejected and they rejected so our eyes could be opened theirs was closed and during this time these seals opened up and the trumpets blowed and now in the blowing of the trumpets just before Messiah comes cuz they've got to be in Palestine and you remember God had to harden Pharaoh's heart to run them out of Egypt and to harden Stalin musolini and all that to get them back into the promised land where the 144,000 is supposed to be and now for the first time thousands of years 2500 years that Israel is a nation with its own flag its own Army and all and it's considered in the U the UN first time it's been the oldest flag that ever flew on Earth at this time flies again the six-point star of David he said he'd lifted that end sign in the last days when she'd be coming back we're at the end there is just no doubt about it we're here that's brother Brandon from the Feast of the trumpets and so during this time of Celebration Israel goes into a time of reflection and the sounding of the of the trumpets for them because they'll sound the chofar every day while they're in this Feast of rash hashana and it'll end on the 10th day with yam Kapur and it'll be the time of the atonement and and during this this time of feast and Festival of rashash Shana the Jews are examining themselves they're repenting about the things that they that they did over the last year they're reflecting on the previous year and they're looking to see what it is that you know that that they need to uh change in their lives they're they're reflecting on on you know what's most important have they lost touch and communication with God I trust this is speaking to you this morning a time of reflection to repent to look you know to look back and say hey you know what I've lost sight of my walk with god I've lost sight with what's most important I'm not paying attention to the things that I should be paying attention to I'm doing wrong to those that I love and and you know all of these things and and you know the Jewish people they they take it very seriously and they go and they you know they try to make things right and I believe that you know um we as human beings here on this Earth we you know we get into situations and times in our lives where we you know where we where we do things that we don't want to do we say things we don't want to say and it's important for us to reflect upon those times they would blow that chofar so that the people would know hey wake up it's time to recognize the hour that we're living in it was a time where it would lead to their day of atonement yam Kapur and you know uh Israel is is going to receive their Awakening but there's still some that are in the church because we're talking about the church and Israel there's some that are still in the church that are not awake they haven't recognized the hour of Jesus Christ and the word that God has provided for for this day for the Church the true church of the bride of Christ amen and so you know we need to look and and see what it is that we need to let go of certain things we need to let go of certain things that we need to you know maybe somebody that we need to forgive you know maybe something that we've been holding and you know when you hold unforgiveness in you you know what it does it hinders you and it hinders you from being delivered from the situation that you're holding unforgiveness towards so it's important for us to reflect and look and see where it is that you know how it is that that that we've you know we've left our first love amen praise God and so at this time I'm GNA ask brother Bill to blow the chofar and I'd like him to blow it seven times representing the Seven Seals and the Seven trumpets and then one last eighth blow which represents the time that we are now living in which is the eternal etal Church age the time where Christ is reflecting and making himself known personally because that's what the great atonement is going to do to us personally to Israel as a nation in one day and as he blows the chauffeur let it draw your thoughts and your attention and reflect ref on the Lord and your walk with him go ahead brother Bill Let's bow our heads [Music] [Music] amen praise God at this time of celebration for the Jewish people in rash hashana they celebrate they come together they feast and they start the year with sweets they put out these big tables with sweets and they'll use cut up apples and honey and they'll dip the apples into the honey because they want to start the year fresh they want to start a new year sweet a reflection to them that if we start the the year in a sweet way it'll end in a sweet way and they'll come together and they'll they'll look at how they can prosper in the new year and you know that um how they can treat one another and how they can help one another in in this time of reflection as they they come to this time of atonement amen and we as Christians can learn from this that if we want a sweeter future we need to examine ourselves and have a fresh start in Christ you can start fresh right here right now today you can have a fresh start in Christ amen knowing that that the blood of Christ cleanses you and purges you of all sin and in unbelief amen praise God and so um we're going to be looking now at Genesis 15 1:3 okay now we we just kind of laid in a foundation here with Israel okay I'm just doing as the Lord kind of directed me to put this together amen and so from it you will draw from it whatever it is that the Lord is revealing personally to you amen but here we are we're living in a time where Israel is at War we're looking at Israel as God's time piece we've recognized that that um Israel is is is is God's way of telling us that have our understanding open to understand the word of God what it is that he is doing and so I thought you know and the Lord just led me he says just lay uh you know a a foundation and let the people know that what is going on in Israel right now is not something that just started this year it's not something that you know that that's just been going on since 1948 it goes back thousands of years and so today in order for us to to have a clear understanding of what is really going on we want to look at the history we want to take a look at you know the foundation and why it is that all these nations have come against Israel and here now some observations that that I want to bring to your attention before we read the scripture the population in Israel is just over 9 million people of that 7.2 million are Jews 2.2 million are Arabs and about 550,000 of them are non-jew and non-arab Israel in you know according to to to a research poll is the fifth most hated country in the world out of 30 they're the fifth most hated country you know fourth to North Korea because it's probably going in your mind third to Russia believe it or not the second most hated country in the world is the USA sad but it's true and the number one China now Israel is geographically surrounded by over 250 million mother Muslims of which a huge amount of them those that are anointed of the of the of the evil spirits and the and the the powers and the principalities that started right back from before the foundations of the world Satan and all of his angels there's a huge amount of them that want to annihilate Israel and remove it right off the face of the Earth yet for a small country they seem to have been able to hold their ground and defend themselves you go back right to the Book of Genesis and you will see how Israel was always a minority but yet God was always right there with them to defend them to stand next to them and to and you know just like when when when uh uh uh Elijah was there and uh and his uh servant was with him and and said Lord we're surrounded you know El said open his eyes Lord that he can see what is really around us I want you to know that you like Israel are a minority in this day when you stand for the word of God but yet you might appear to be a minority uity but you are surrounded by the power and by the anointing and by the angels of God in whatever situations that you deal with whatever you face you are encamped about and listen there is no doubt it's a proven fact that Israel is not alone they are a small country there are only 7 million you know Israelites in Israel but yet for a country that's surrounded by over 250 million Muslims they stand their ground amen thank you Jesus there's thousands of denominations out there but the True Church of Jesus Christ is not a denomination it is the literal mystical living body of Jesus Christ in this day and in this hour amen hallelujah amen a small country yet they seem to hold their ground they have with stod and continue to withstand terrorist attacks that are known to be backed by many Muslim Iranian Arab Muslim backed proxies we know that we're not we're not pointing to the people we're looking at the spiritual powers and dominions that operate as evil through people somebody out there that just went and committed murder that person was anointed of a spirit and many times you'll see them where they'll come out of it and they'll weep and cry not realizing what was what was on them controlling them to to do the things that they did it's because these evil spirits they're real anybody that has has evil enough to go in like they did a year ago tomorrow where they went in and they attacked innocent Israelites that were at a concert killing over 1,200 people men women and children slaughtering them in front of their parents listen I know that this is It's a touchy subject okay there's a lot of people out there that they're blaming Israel and then there's those that recognize and and we as the church we are thinking and operating from a spiritual revelation we are not operating by the flesh when we look at the people that are being slaughtered and the the bombs that are dropping and killing innocent people we feel the pain as human beings if you're not human if you're human you can't say you don't feel the pain of this this wickedness but yet evil is present evil is real and it would be foolish for us as humans and Christians to call evil good so it's not like we're saying oh it's good that you know that that that that Israel is killing these people or or anything like that no we we know that we fight not against flesh and blood we realize that for Israel right now it's it's all natural because they're defending the land that God gave them amen praise God and so since Israel's foundation in 1948 military conscription has been a Central pillar of National Defense okay Israel makes it mandatory that a man once he hits the a of the age of 18 he enlists and he goes to the to the Army for he goes and and he goes to the military for 32 months of training so that if there be a need to defend their country they got to be ready to step up and don't think you know if if you were to go to Israel I've listened to testimonies of people talking about uh being in Israel okay just over the last year while this has all been going on testifying how the young people are ready to take their place it's in them to defend their country to stand for their Nation because of what God has instilled in them by the word of God through the teachings of the word of God so it's not like these young people are not ready to take their position they're ready to go to war because they believe in what Israel stands for they believe that God gave them the land and we now are going to looking at the word of God to see how it is that God actually gave them the land and how the promise is to the nation of Israel and that the land is rightfully owned by the nation of Israel because the creator of the universe gave it to them amen so let's dig in here after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abra ABR Abram in a vision saying fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward and ABR said Lord God what Willl thou give me seeing I go childless and the steward of my house is this eleazer of Damascus in other words he was wondering well the Lord was going to you know bless him and and make him a great nation but how is he going to do it and and Abram turns around and says will you use Damascus I mean will you use Eleazar my servant to be my Heir and ab Abram said behold to me thou has given no seed and lo one born in my house is mine air so God had not given him Abraham had not had any children yet but God had come to Abraham to call him out so that he could be God's chosen people now go to the next scripture and behold the word of the Lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine Heir another words not eleazer but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine air and he brought him forth abroad and said look now towards heaven and tell and tell the Stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be and he believed in the Lord and he counted it to him for righteousness amen praise God so now let's go to the next scripture Genesis 16:1 now Sarah Abraham's Abram's wife bear him no children so there was no children yet but yet God gave and made a promise to Abraham and she had a hands handmaid an Egyptian whose name was Hagar and Sarai said unto Abram behold now the Lord hath restained me restrained me from bearing I pray thee go in unto my maid it may be that I may obtain children by her and Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarah and Sarah Abraham's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian after Abraham had dealt dwelt 10 years in the land of Canaan and gave her to uh to her husband and gave her to her husband Abraham to be his wife and he went in unto Hagar and she concealed conceived and when she saw that she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyes and so we see here now that through unbelief Sarah just didn't unbelief just didn't believe that that you know God could keep the promise of you know potentially uh she said how could it be that I can have children so the only way that I can do this is I'm going to have to you know give her give Abraham my my maid you know Hagar and Hagar went to be with Abram and conceived and all of a sudden emnity comes up into Sarah you see because when you're in sin things just don't feel right things just don't look right things don't sit right on all of a sudden you're just uncomfortable about everything and here now she's like she gets into a condition and realizes that you know what what have I done here you know now all of a sudden so let's read on Genesis 16:10 and the angel of the Lord said unto her I will multiply sorry Genesis 16 1610 and the angel of the Lord said unto her I will multiply thy seed exceedingly that it shall not be numbered for multitude now sorry here I got to go back to my notes Here what happened here okay is first of all we need to understand that Hagar became pregnant and she got all you know uh realized that that Sarah wanted her out and she got all discouraged and she you know she she went and left the tribe and was and went out into the Wilderness and the Holy Spirit God sent an angel to go and speak to her and to tell her that just wait a minute here because you are actually going to fulfill a plan that I have for the children of Israel you see God had a plan in his mind it's called The Plan of Redemption and God is going to play out this whole plan and he's going to show how it's all going to come to pass and here now she is the bonds woman that is going to bring forth a son and the angel of the Lord said unto her now speaking to Hagar I will multiply thy seed exceedingly that it shall not be numbered for multitude and the angel of the Lord said unto her behold thou art with child and shalt bear a son and shall call his name Ishmael now that child that was born to Hagar is to this day where the nations of the Muslims worldwide originated Ishmael is the son of Abraham they have a right when the Muslims say that that that Abraham is their father they have a right to say that but yet Ishmael was not the promised son let's let's read on now because the Lord had heard thy Affliction and he will be a now listen he will be a wild man he's describing the character that is going to be in Ishmael his hand will be against every man it's like you know if you don't believe what they believe and they're anointed of that spirit it's Jihad it's holy war it's annihilate them that's how they look at Christians when they stand solely and wholly on the word of God and and and and tell them this is what's true here right away they get wild amen and his hand will be against every man and every man's hand against him and he shall dwell in the presence of all his Brethren not in the presence of the Lord but here now God makes this unconditional Covenant with Abraham now let's look at covenant for a minute if you don't know what a covenant is it's a formal contractual promise between two individuals now there are two basic types of covenants in the Bible there's conditional and unconditional conditional Covenant requires actions from both parties involved in the Covenant in today's terms you could you know compare it to like a mortgage on a home the borrower of the home promises to give you money you promise to pay it with interest that's a mortgage unconditional covenants are those who the the greater of the two parties promises to do something for the person who they are entering into this promise with it's also called a royal Grant Covenant where a king gives a reward to a faithful subject for a service rendered and that Covenant is irrevocable because it's based on the word of the king and listen God made a covenant with you and me because we are the Seed of Abraham God made an unconditional Covenant that we would receive our Promised Land amen and that nothing could take it away now listen here in this in this uh in the essence of this Covenant Abraham believing the word of God as stated that Abraham believed in in verse in in Genesis 15:6 Abraham believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness God was so impressed by Abraham's faith that he gave him this promise and to Abraham's descendants forever it's an unconditional Covenant amen praise God Abraham he questioned God when he said that he couldn't have any children but God assured Abraham that this would come to pass amen amen praise God and so here now let's go to the next scripture and I will make my Covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly and Abraham fell on his face and God talked with him saying as for me behold my Covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations neither shall thy name anymore be called Abram but thy name Shall be Called Abraham father of Nations for a father of many nations have I made thee and I will make thee exceedingly fruitful and I will make nations of thee and Kings shall come out of thee and I will establish my Covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their gener ations for an Everlasting Covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee amen aren't you thankful that God made this unconditional promise amen praise God let's go to the next slide now watch and God said unto Abraham as for Sarah her name Thou shalt not call her name Sarai but Sarah shall be her name and I will bless her and give thee a son also of her and I will bless her yay I will bless her and she shall be a mother of Nations Kings of people shall be of her then Abraham fell upon his face and laughed and said in his heart shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old imagine God comes to him at 100 years old there had to be some miraculous Faith being revealed to Abraham and shall Sarah that is 90 years old bear and Abraham said unto God oh that Ishmael might live before thee you know he was he was you know kind of in his mind he was just just boggled but yet he knew knew that nothing was impossible for God and we get into Times just like Abraham here you know we can get into Times where situations around us look like oh my God like I know I believe God's word I know that there's nothing that God can't do but yet boy I don't know about this situation and all of a sudden you find yourself in a backslidden condition you find yourself doubting God and his ability to to do what he promised that he would do God God said that this church is going to go into Rapture God said that this church is not going into the Great Tribulation amen God says that he's going to take us he's going to change these mortal bodies he's going to make them Immortal we shall put on immortality it sounds Supernatural it sounds unrealistic the people might think you're a little cuckoo man you think you're going to change Dimensions you think you're going to leave this Dimension and go into another dimension what are you talking about just like Abraham but Abraham staggered not at the promises of God hallelujah amen read the next verse here from 19 and God said Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name Isaac God knew exactly what he was going to do God knew that he was going to have a nation called by his name according to his word and it was going to come according to the way he said it that's why nobody can change what God said about Israel you can you can fuss and hum and ha and and get upset and oh cut you know like Paris says cut off the arms don't send them any more ammunition don't send them any more tools for war you know cut them off we need to cut off Israel you know the there's so many people saying this is not right what Israel is doing you know listen it's the murder and the and the and and the deaths and everything else of course it's terrible but it's not we're but we're not thinking from a natural perspective here we need to see this spiritually what God is showing us in the word of God that we fight not against flesh and blood this world is in a condition right now where our family are being attacked y listen you see Israel being attacked naturally over there we are being attacked naturally over here too amen our families are being attacked they want to take the word of God out of the schools they want to place all kinds of different genders upon our children they don't realize what that does to their minds it it it it it destroys their true identity it puts them into a state of confusion where they don't know who they are and what ends up happening they get to places where students all of a sudden they'll get akas and they'll go into a high school and they'll shoot 30 or 40 people because of their mental condition that that that is being bombarded upon the people there's oppression all around us it's not just Israel at War the true church the Sons and Daughters of God that believe God's word she's trying to hold the ground around her life but thanks be to God Jesus Christ said I'll be with you even in you we will not stagger at the promises of God amen hallelujah thank you Jes and he says here I will establish my Covenant with you with him for an Everlasting Covenant and with his seed after him talking about Isaac nowhere anywhere look what he says and as for Ishmael here it is I have heard thee behold I have blessed him and I will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly 12 princes shall he beget and I will make him a great nation but my Covenant no but he goes right back he says but my Covenant and I'll just elaborate on all that is not with Ishmael my Covenant is not with the Muslim nations my Covenant is not with denomination amen my Covenant is my word and my Covenant is with Isaac Hallelujah but my Covenant will I establish with Isaac which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year you see God was making very clear here we're trying to lay in a foundation so that we as Christians can have the right understanding of this war and more than that this is only a foundation so that you can understand what it is that's happening around us but you need to see that there there's an Awakening taking place that the things that took place what I read here at the very beginning of the service what I was talking about were God showing these signs in the heavens and the solar eclipse and the and the blackout because the Gentile dispensation remember the Gentile dispensation has to come to a total completion to where it becomes where God is no longer dealing with the Gentiles and focuses completely and wholly over to Israel and we don't want to get distracted by this war we don't want to get distracted and pulled in by the political aspects of it we don't want to be drawn in to where we start to get political with our families and and and you know start to take positions and agree with this and disagree with that we need to let them know prophetically by the word of God and show them in the scripture and that's why we're going through these I know you've seen this I know you've read this but this there's never been a time such as this amen there's never been a time where where things have to be clarified where God is reminding us of his promise to you and to Israel God is reminding us the time and the season that we're living in so that we can act according ly and be aware of our surroundings what it is that God is doing in our lives how it is that the word of God is something that that we stand upon and and that we if we're going to share a word we need to share the present truth we don't want to be sharing fables we want to be sharing exactly what God is doing in this hour aware with our eyes open so that we can talk to people and and know where we stand scripturally Hallelujah so here now we'll go to the next scripture and the Lord visited Sarah as he had said and I guarantee you if there's a promise that God has given you God has promised you things in this life he will meet those promises he will provide you with those needs he will he will heal you he will restore your Finance he will restore your relationships he will restore all those things Hallelujah he said as he had said and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken for Sarah conceived and bear Abraham a son in his old age and at the set time of which God had spoken to him and Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him whom Sarah bear to him Isaac Hallelujah that was the promise of God and it was fulfilled glory to God hallah let's look at Romans 4:17 now as it is written I have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even God who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were Oh Glory to God hallelujah listen it seemed impossible to Abraham it didn't seem possible to Sarah there's things that don't seem possible around our lives I got things around my life right now that look impossible but I'm not looking at the circumstances and and I'm not looking at the word impossible I'm looking at the scripture where Jesus said all things are possible to them that believe that's what I'm looking at that's what we're trusting and call those things which be not as though they were who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father he's talking about Abraham here the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and we are Abraham's seed Hallelujah we can claim the same promises today Hallelujah the same promises that God made to Abraham to Sarah we can claim them today and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead don't look at the circumstances that look dead around you all right come on now you got to you this faith that Abraham you know this is this is a different kind of Faith this kind of Faith doesn't look at the dead this kind of Faith sees dead rise of Faith changes everything this is listen you either believe God's word or you don't believe God's word the True Church of God believes God word listen that's why you can hear Netanyahu and and those soldiers and they will they tell you straight up we will not surrender we will annihilate the enemy we will keep our land God has given us our land and we will hold our land God has given us our our promises and we will stand upon those promises and be not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb I don't care what's going on in your life you might have a child you might have something in your womb I don't care if God gets a hold of that situation what whatever the circumstances are God can change it you got a womb that won't bring forth God can bring forth because his word is is true amen if he could if he could go and take a woman at 90 years old and take that womb and and turn it and change it so that it could bring forth a living body how much more can God do it in this day Hallelujah the reality of Jesus Christ [Music] thank you Lord he staggered not at the promises Hallelujah of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness oh don't you listen don't you don't you get off of that word God says if you can stand there and and call those things the exact opposite of what they look like God is going to impute it unto you as righteousness and God is going to do that work God is going to restore that situation God is going to raise that dead situation Hallelujah he can still open the blinded eyes glory to God Amen listen to brother brandom here he says here in in um have faith in God 1958 he says my subject is have faith in God now we are taught in God's blessing word that Faith cometh by hearing and by hearing by the word or of the word we're preaching the word this morning you believe this word this morning if you believe it you can receive it you need a healing this morning you need a a change this morning whatever it is just believe it right now as we're as we're speaking here he says now faith is also an experience Hallelujah am and many times faith is had by a former experience and by a former experience makes Faith grow listen look back at what God did for you don't forget the things that God did for you God is still able to do exceeding abundantly more than what you can possibly imagine he can still do it amen hallelujah praise God you know you you got to reflect on those experiences from time to time oh yes so that you can you can say wait a minute he did it back there he can do it again right here hallelujah he says faith being the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things that's not seen so many people fail to find the real meaning of what faith is because they're looking for it to be seen but he says here some people believe that faith is some sensation or some emotion but the Bible said that faith is the substance of things HED for it's a reality in you and now you're just focused that God is going to manifest it amen that God's perfect will is going to be established that God knows what's best for me God knows what's best for you God knows your situation God knows exactly what you have need of right now and so 15 years later 25 years later after God made his original promise to Abraham that he would have a son Sarah gets the son 90 years old and Isaac is born soon after that you'll read about Ishmael mocking threatening Isaac Sarah again upset the division is there and cast out the bonds woman because the bondswoman shall not be air with the seed of Abraham this war that's taking place it's ugly it's terrible it's always been ugly war is never good but when it pertains to Israel it's prophecy and do you know that World War II also pertained to Israel it was a World War but yet it was millions of Jews that were slaughtered men women and children because of evil demonic spirits dominions and principalities people want to forget that we don't forget the Millions of Christians that were slaughtered throughout the Dark Ages it's always been the same fight from the beginning it started naturally right in the Garden of Eden with Cain and Abel really it started before the foundations of the world when Lucifer committed Mutiny in heaven and it fell down onto the Earth because in the mind of God he knew that he would be a savior everything that we have witnessed through scripture and through history has always been war between good and evil it's part of God's Plan of Redemption you cannot have good without the evil you cannot have Victory without the battle it's as simple as that and we need to recognize the day the hour the time and the season that we're living in we need to realize that this war is culminating and coming to a place where Israel is going to awaken Israel's win but at the same time the bride is awake she's aware let the musicians come she's aware of what God is doing in the church she's aware that God in the same way that that Israel is standing her ground fighting and not giving up this church will stand her ground will not give up will stand on the word of God will believe God's word will Proclaim that God sent a prophet in the 20th century by the name of William Branham because without that Prophet we the Gentiles would not have been restored back to this faith that we've been preaching here Malachi 4:5 was to restore the hearts of the children behold I send unto you Elijah I send unto you he didn't say to a nation he didn't say to the no Israel is going to receive their Moses and Elijah that's going to be the next stage of Moses and Elijah coming on the scene again to Israel but we're not here for that but God said I sent unto you the Christian Gentile Church Elijah the prophet to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers back to the original faith and that's why the Reformation took place and that's why we stand and recognize who we are and at the same time can stand and see who Israel is and how important these events actually are that are taking place around us I listen Saints I could only bring what the Lord laid upon my heart but I can tell you that the signs that we've witnessed the the the the the the blackout of the Sun and and those events that took place in 2024 and all those scriptures that we brought and how the bride now is Revelations 108 thou must prophesy again we have the ministry of Prophecy upon us and we have the ability to recognize prophecy being fulfilled and that's why the five-fold ministry will will come under the anointing of the spirit of God to recognize the hour the day the events you know prophecy Vindicated prophecy being fulfilled around us we've been given that ability by the spirit of God by the Holy Ghost because when you receive the Holy Ghost you have the ability to discern the times the seasons the players those that are that are that are fulfilling around us amen what an hour yes glory to God let's all stand let's sing that song nations are breaking Hallelujah nations are breaking Israel's Awakening signs that the
