[32:03] so tonight we're going to kind of
[32:05] continue along in um in the similar uh
[32:10] thought uh we've been we've been um
[32:12] looking at um seeing our part in the
[32:17] word of
[32:19] God and um through it all we've been
[32:22] looking at uh many aspects of
[32:25] understanding you know our position in
[32:27] the word of God and how God has uh
[32:30] called us for a purpose that we all have
[32:33] a placing in the word that it's
[32:35] important that we start to recognize
[32:38] especially as we mature um you know we
[32:41] start to feed on the meat of God's word
[32:44] we start to mature and we start to
[32:45] realize that there is something very
[32:49] purposeful in the calling of God in our
[32:53] individual lives amen and that uh
[32:57] purpose must become a reality must
[32:59] become perfect in your understanding in
[33:02] the Revelation that God is giving us
[33:04] because that is what is going to give us
[33:07] rapturing faith that is what is going to
[33:09] provide the quickening power um in this
[33:12] day and in this hour which we're now
[33:14] experiencing we're already being
[33:16] quickened by the word of God Amen praise
[33:18] God so in that um in that series uh
[33:22] tonight we want to look at
[33:23] identification of the word made flesh
[33:27] that's what we want to take a look at we
[33:28] want to we don't know how far we're
[33:30] going to get tonight but we're GNA just
[33:33] allow the holy spirit to guide us and
[33:37] Inspire us and I'm
[33:40] trusting that you came with some sort of
[33:43] expectation in your heart because this
[33:45] is this is vital when you come into the
[33:47] house of the Lord you must come knowing
[33:51] and expecting that you're going to hear
[33:53] from God Amen this is the relationship
[33:56] you know when you go to meet with
[33:58] somebody you're going to meet with that
[34:00] person because you're going to
[34:01] communicate you're going to commune with
[34:03] them and you're going to enter into
[34:05] their thoughts and they're going to
[34:06] express their thoughts and you're going
[34:07] to express yours so as we are
[34:10] ministering tonight and as as the word
[34:12] is coming forth you you speak back you
[34:16] you you say Amen you say yes Lord that's
[34:19] me you identify with the word of God and
[34:21] then all of a sudden deep starts to call
[34:23] to the deep and the deep starts to
[34:25] respond and all of a sudden this becomes
[34:28] more of a reality this is not just a a
[34:30] gathering tonight of individuals this is
[34:33] a gathering of the mystical Supernatural
[34:36] body of Jesus Christ amen praise God and
[34:39] so we want to identify with the word of
[34:42] God Amen let's look at our scripture
[34:44] tonight first scripture is from
[34:47] Ephesians chapter 5 vers 25-
[34:52] 28 we're going to take our time and
[34:55] we're going to let the Holy Spirit just
[34:56] uh show to us exactly how we are now uh
[35:01] the word made flesh in this day and we
[35:04] can identify with it amen husbands love
[35:07] your wives even as Christ also loved the
[35:10] church and gave himself for it that he
[35:14] might sanctify and cleanse it with the
[35:17] washing of Water by the word I pay
[35:20] attention here that he might present it
[35:25] to who
[35:27] to himself that he might present it to
[35:31] himself amen a glorious church not
[35:35] having spot or wrinkle or any such thing
[35:39] but that it should be holy and without
[35:43] blemish now is it possible that you as a
[35:46] human being could fulfill this
[35:50] scripture and be completely holy and
[35:54] without blemish in this hour and in this
[35:56] this day it's not possible as a human
[36:02] but as a Son of God and as an attribute
[36:04] of God and as a plan that God has has
[36:08] had in the back of his mind from before
[36:10] the foundations of the world it's going
[36:13] to happen and it is possible and it's
[36:16] going to happen but it's not going to
[36:18] happen by us looking at one another and
[36:21] looking at at one another's uh ability
[36:24] to become perfect in this flesh
[36:27] you're never going to do it that's why
[36:30] the scripture says we shall be changed
[36:35] hallelujah praise God you're going to
[36:38] need a change you're going to need to be
[36:39] translated and this body that's mortal
[36:42] needs to put on immortality so ought men
[36:45] to love their wives as their own bodies
[36:49] he that loveth his wife loveth
[36:54] himself praise God let's pray pray
[36:57] father we just so appreciate your spirit
[37:01] and your anointing upon the word of God
[37:04] lord we know that without it Lord these
[37:07] just become written words in a book but
[37:11] because your spirit gives it life it
[37:14] becomes the living manifestation of the
[37:18] word of God and it becomes more real to
[37:21] us than anything else it sets us apart
[37:24] from the rest of this world as
[37:27] individuals called by the victory that
[37:31] comes in Jesus Christ father we commit
[37:35] this service tonight we commit each and
[37:37] every one Lord remember those that are
[37:39] at home that are watching online may

[37:46] direct and deliver and heal and do a
[37:50] mighty work because it's all you father
[37:52] we will give you the glory and the
[37:54] praise in Jesus name amen amen praise
[37:57] God you may be
[37:59] seated Hallelujah imagine that you know
[38:03] the scripture says here that he that
[38:05] loveth his wife loveth himself you know
[38:08] um we're going to look at this a little
[38:11] more as as we as we move through it but
[38:13] um you know we've got some thoughts here
[38:15] that we want to bring in its in in the
[38:17] right time here but you know in the next
[38:20] scripture in the in the Book of Genesis
[38:22] chapter 2 we want to look here in order
[38:24] for us to truly understand The Plan of
[38:27] Redemption and to fully understand how
[38:30] it is that we are the body of Jesus
[38:33] Christ that we are the bride of Christ
[38:36] that we are actually now the living
[38:38] manifestation of the word made flesh in
[38:41] our day it we need to we need to first
[38:45] get the history behind it we need to see
[38:48] why God had this plan and why he's going
[38:51] to fulfill it and how it is that we are
[38:54] going to be the word in our day and how
[38:57] it is that we are the word made flesh in
[38:59] our day amen in Genesis 2: 21- 24 it
[39:04] says and the Lord God caused a deep
[39:06] sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and
[39:10] he took one of his ribs and closed up
[39:13] the flesh instead thereof and the rib
[39:17] which the Lord God hath taken from man
[39:20] made he a woman that's why it's she's
[39:23] called woman because she was taken from
[39:26] the womb of the man amen praise God and
[39:31] brought her unto the man and Adam said
[39:35] this is now bone of my bones and Flesh
[39:39] of My Flesh she shall be called woman
[39:43] because she was taken out of the man
[39:47] therefore shall a man leave his father
[39:50] and his mother and shall cleave unto his
[39:53] wife and they shall be one flesh praise
[40:00] God I want you to know here tonight that
[40:03] the Plan of Redemption that started from
[40:05] before the foundations of the world had
[40:08] a plan and you were a part of that plan
[40:11] you were in Adam before the foundations
[40:15] of the world you were in Christ before
[40:18] the foundations of the world you were in
[40:20] Elohim the self-existent one you were a
[40:24] part of God you were always a part of
[40:26] God you were always a part of his plan
[40:29] you're you're you're you're you're part
[40:32] you're you're co-partner with God in the
[40:34] Fulfillment of this Plan of Redemption
[40:37] there was never a time that you were not
[40:40] a part of God and if Adam took from his
[40:44] side a rib and created the woman and it
[40:46] says here that they too shall be one
[40:49] flesh that means that Adam and Eve were
[40:53] one God called their name Adam
[40:57] amen praise God so Adam and Eve are the
[41:02] same person Adam is Eve Eve is Adam
[41:06] because they two were one flesh God is
[41:10] expressing everything in in a in a
[41:13] spiritual form everything that that we
[41:15] read through the scriptures from Genesis
[41:18] all the way down to revelation God has
[41:21] this mystery in the word of God and it's
[41:24] all about him expressing himself
[41:26] him condescending down from the
[41:29] beginning of time you know before the
[41:31] fall took place there was no time
[41:35] because God is
[41:36] eternal God didn't need time time was a
[41:40] result of sin time was the result of the
[41:43] Fall he said the day you eat thereof ye
[41:47] shall surely die let's look at the next
[41:49] scripture we want to look at Genesis
[41:51] chapter 3 and we want to see where all
[41:54] of this started here and we want to have
[41:57] a clear understanding how it is that God
[41:59] has has given us Dominion God has given
[42:02] us a position in the body of Christ that
[42:05] that gives us full Authority remember
[42:08] everything is being restored back back
[42:11] to the original amen Adam Eve and the
[42:15] Earth everything being restored and
[42:17] remember when Adam and Eve were were
[42:20] were placed in the garden originally God
[42:22] gave them dominion over the entire Earth
[42:25] God gave him dominion over everything
[42:28] whatever he named the animals that's
[42:30] what it was if he would ask a tree to be
[42:32] moved it would have to obey it would
[42:34] move everything was by the spoken word
[42:38] everything was was in the Supernatural
[42:41] God was a Creator all he had to do was
[42:43] speak it and it would come to pass amen
[42:46] praise God but there was a there was a a
[42:50] a a part of the plan now you need to
[42:53] understand that a whole part of the
[42:55] plan that he had in the back of his mind
[42:58] from before the foundations of the world
[43:00] included Redemption it included the fall
[43:06] everything that we are that that that
[43:08] that we are reading here in the
[43:10] scripture God already had it in the back
[43:12] part of his mind he knew exactly what
[43:15] was going to happen but remember we're
[43:17] here on free moral agency God placed
[43:20] them on free moral agency that's why he
[43:21] said the DAT you the day you eat thereof
[43:24] you shall surely die so let's read it
[43:26] here now the serpent was more subtle
[43:28] than any beast of the field which the
[43:30] Lord God had made we know that the
[43:32] serpent is the devil it's not a snake
[43:36] Okay this is Bible study so we're going
[43:37] to hit on things that are going to
[43:39] expose certain things and we're trusting
[43:41] that you know as people uh you know
[43:43] listen in on these messages uh we're
[43:45] we're looking for for for Sons and
[43:47] Daughters of God that are that are under
[43:49] some spiritual Amnesia that are caught
[43:52] under the the the world systems that are
[43:54] you know they may be caught under a den
[43:56] denominational uh uh uh chain they may
[44:00] be caught under certain doctrines of man
[44:02] and and the preaching of the word faith
[44:05] cometh by hearing and by hearing of the
[44:07] word of God and we're looking to set
[44:09] captives free amen praise God we want to
[44:12] we want to see people get delivered
[44:14] praise the Lord Jesus so as we're
[44:16] ministering here as we're reading we're
[44:18] going to just interject certain things
[44:20] and he said unto the woman ye hath God
[44:23] said ye shall not eat of every tree of
[44:26] the garden now listen Satan knew exactly
[44:30] what God told Eve why is he coming to
[44:33] her and saying oh has God said he knew
[44:36] exactly what God said that's why he's
[44:38] going there to try and tempt her and to
[44:41] beguile her and to deceive her you got
[44:44] to watch that the devil he's the same
[44:48] today he's going to come to you he's
[44:50] going to say oh did did oh did God
[44:52] actually send a prophet oh oh did did
[44:55] God actually open the Seven Seals oh did
[44:58] did you know do you understand what I'm
[45:01] saying you're not to bow down you're
[45:03] you're to stay with the word of God Amen
[45:05] that's what this eve the the difference
[45:08] between the Eve that fell and the Eve
[45:10] that's in this day which is the bride of
[45:12] Christ the True Church of God is she
[45:15] will not be deceived she will not be
[45:19] beguiled she cannot and I and we're
[45:22] going to see why it's impossible for her
[45:24] to be beguiled praise God so he's he's
[45:28] telling her had God said that you can't
[45:30] you know talk to me you know I'm going
[45:32] to elaborate and the woman said unto the
[45:34] serpent we can eat of the fruit of the
[45:36] trees we can Fellowship in the garden we
[45:39] can talk you know with the with the
[45:40] trees because you know you've heard the
[45:43] scripture by their fruit you shall know
[45:45] them trees were were known as uh people
[45:50] in the Garden of Eden Trees of
[45:52] Righteousness the you know trees there
[45:54] there's uh you know you know and and the
[45:56] fruit is what what those trees bring
[45:58] forth that's why that by their fruit you
[46:01] shall know them you shall know what what
[46:04] they're saying so you can always know if
[46:06] somebody really has the Holy Ghost by
[46:08] the fruit that that they speak when they
[46:11] speak about the word of God Amen and so
[46:14] but but of the fruit of the tree which
[46:16] is in the midst of the garden which is
[46:19] you you're you're the deceiver okay
[46:22] because you're the tree that knows both
[46:24] both good and evil all right right now
[46:26] I'm elaborating here okay but she wasn't
[46:28] aware of that at at that moment God had
[46:31] said we shall not eat of it neither
[46:34] shall we touch
[46:36] it lest you die and the serpent said
[46:39] unto the woman you're not going to
[46:41] die he was you know because he had an
[46:44] understanding of God he knew God was
[46:47] eternal he knew that God you know uh uh
[46:50] was perfect there there there's nothing
[46:52] but but he also knew that if God said
[46:55] something and you went against God then
[46:58] God had to honor his word amen and
[47:01] that's why when God told them if you eat
[47:05] of that tree you shall surely die and
[47:08] die was was separation from God you're
[47:11] going to lose that connection with me
[47:14] okay but remember that connection was
[47:16] lost and it was lost all for a purpose
[47:20] amen so ye shall not uh either tell okay
[47:23] for God doth know that so he's saying
[47:25] her no no you're not going to die for
[47:27] goth doth know that in the day that you
[47:30] eat thereof then your eyes shall be
[47:32] opened and ye shall be as
[47:36] Gods you know Satan wanted to pervert
[47:39] because remember Satan wanted to be
[47:42] worshiped as
[47:44] God and the only way that Satan could be
[47:47] worshiped as God was that if he got
[47:50] others to fall to fall into sin and to
[47:54] rebel against God God anybody that
[47:57] worships Satan it's because they don't
[48:00] worship
[48:01] God that's why Jesus said seek first the
[48:05] kingdom of God and all righteousness
[48:11] will be added unto you everything else
[48:14] that you have need of will be given to
[48:16] you all that you need but the moment
[48:18] that you're beguiled the moment that
[48:20] you're you're you're you're against God
[48:22] and you're you're following Satan and
[48:24] you allow Satan to control your mind and
[48:27] to turn you away from the word of God
[48:29] now you start to worship Satan and
[48:31] that's what he wanted he wanted so he
[48:34] says the only way I can get the people
[48:35] to to worship me is I'm GNA have to I'm
[48:39] gonna have to deceive God's children I'm
[48:42] gonna have to deceive God's children
[48:44] imagine the attributes of God you can't
[48:46] deceive God's children but because they
[48:49] were created and they were placed into
[48:52] this this Garden under free moral agency
[48:55] they they had the ability to make
[48:57] decisions and God knew that Eve would
[49:00] make the wrong decision praise God for
[49:04] God doth know and when the woman verse
[49:06] six saw that the tree was good for food
[49:09] and that it was pleasant to the eyes in
[49:11] a tree to be desired to make one wise
[49:14] she took of the fruit thereof and did
[49:16] eat and gave also unto her husband with
[49:19] her and he did eat now we know that it
[49:24] wasn't fruit that she gave him that he
[49:28] gave her and that she partook of that
[49:31] fruit and ate the apple it's not an
[49:34] apple it has nothing to do with with
[49:37] with with an apple it was adultery Satan
[49:40] came to her because he needed to beguile
[49:43] he needed to create he wanted something
[49:45] that he could create he' seen that God
[49:48] had spoken uh you know uh Adam into
[49:51] existence in his own image taken Eve
[49:54] from his side spoken her her and and and
[49:56] created her from Adam he saw that God
[49:59] was creating his family and Satan was
[50:03] jealous he wanted to have his own family
[50:05] and he knew that God had said let every
[50:07] seed bring forth of its own kind so so
[50:10] the so the Beast the the serpent who was
[50:13] who who actually is the missing link to
[50:16] this very day all right scien is trying
[50:18] to figure out they're looking for ape
[50:20] that looks like a man that they're never
[50:22] going to find that Missing Link because
[50:24] that Missing Link was actually the
[50:25] serpent he was so much and so close to
[50:30] man that he was able to talk and
[50:34] actually make love with Eve in the
[50:36] Garden of Eden and that's where she got
[50:39] pregnated by uh by the serpent seed amen
[50:43] praise God and so it was not an apple it
[50:47] was an adultery it was it was a a a the
[50:51] serpent beguiling Eve to make love to
[50:54] her so that he could impregnate her with
[50:57] his own seed so that he could create a
[50:59] race of people that could that that he
[51:02] could have to worship Him amen praise
[51:05] God so go to the next
[51:09] verse
[51:10] um oh
[51:16] boy
[51:18] sorry I know it's up there but I just
[51:22] uh and so from verse um 3 uh or chapter
[51:27] 3:
[51:31] 7-12 let's read
[51:33] here so he says and the eyes of them
[51:37] both were open now remember Adam he she
[51:41] went to Adam she told Adam what she had
[51:44] done she says you got to do this you got
[51:46] to try this you you know this is this is
[51:48] incredible she experienced the Euphoria
[51:51] of uh of sexuality and you know she went
[51:54] to ad Adam now Adam knew exactly what
[51:58] she did but Adam being Christ Adam being
[52:03] being in that understanding and in the
[52:06] image of God he knew exactly what she
[52:09] did he understood what she did so so he
[52:13] made himself sin we've we've heard that
[52:15] he he didn't have to become sin but he
[52:17] but let's read it and the eyes of them
[52:19] were were both opened and they knew that
[52:22] they were naked and they sowed fig
[52:24] leaves together and made themselves
[52:26] aprons and they heard the voice of the
[52:29] Lord God Walking In The Garden in the
[52:32] cool of the day and Adam and his wife
[52:34] hid themselves from the presence of the
[52:36] Lord that's what sin does When sin comes
[52:39] into your life all of a sudden you want
[52:41] to hide you don't want to come to church
[52:44] that's why you'll notice people when
[52:45] they fall into sin if you see somebody
[52:48] that's that you know they're they're
[52:49] they're in church and then you don't see
[52:51] them for a for a you know for a period
[52:53] of time and you're wondering where are
[52:54] they what's going on it's because sin
[52:57] has got a hold of them unbelief has got
[52:59] a hold of them they listen there's no
[53:02] other place that we should be but in the
[53:04] house of the Lord now we understand
[53:06] there's times when you're sick you're
[53:08] working you're you know all these things
[53:09] that's perfectly normal but when you're
[53:12] you're you know you're you're you're
[53:14] inconsistent you're not consistent with
[53:17] God you're not consistent with the
[53:18] ministry you're not supporting the
[53:20] ministry regularly you've got you know
[53:23] all these different excuses because sin
[53:25] has got a hold of you and you start to
[53:27] hide you can't come into the presence of
[53:29] God because you know that the that the
[53:31] preaching you know which is the Holy
[53:33] Ghost himself is going to start to uh
[53:36] find you out and and and deal with that
[53:38] situation in your life praise God but
[53:41] that's what you need you need to come
[53:43] into the house of the Lord you need to
[53:45] be assembled here you need to join
[53:47] together especially even more so as this
[53:50] day is approaching where where the the
[53:52] the Sons and Daughters of God are
[53:54] actually becoming the mystical
[53:56] Supernatural body of Jesus Christ
[54:00] literally you wonder what I don't need
[54:02] to be in church I don't need to go to CH
[54:04] I can watch it online you need to
[54:06] assemble you need to be one with the
[54:09] other you need to move together into
[54:11] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Christ
[54:15] why does Christ need to preach then why
[54:18] why do we need the foolishness of
[54:20] preaching why do we need it because in
[54:23] this day and in this hour and in this
[54:26] Dimension God is going to speak line
[54:28] upon line precept upon precept and you
[54:32] being in the presence of God and you
[54:34] being that part of God that has a
[54:37] purpose you you you you've got a purpose
[54:40] in being in the in the body of Christ
[54:42] when you're not when you're listen when
[54:45] when when we're missing individuals that
[54:48] are pillars in the house of the Lord we
[54:50] we're we're affected by it we get
[54:53] encouraged when we see the the Sons and
[54:55] Daughters of God Gathering Together
[54:58] pulling on the word feeding in the
[55:00] Supernatural realm allowing the word to
[55:03] to purge them cleanse them because this
[55:05] is how the the green gets baked out of
[55:08] us the green gets baked out by the word
[55:11] coming and speaking and and and
[55:13] Discerning and and and and uh delivering
[55:16] you from the situations and the
[55:18] circumstances of your own human elements
[55:22] the things that that that you struggle
[55:24] with every day
[55:25] as a human being you need to come you
[55:28] need to be delivered you need to receive
[55:30] the word the word of God will deliver
[55:32] you praise God Amen Hallelujah and so
[55:36] you know we uh they they they were
[55:39] hiding from
[55:40] God and and they were they were uh
[55:43] hiding themselves from the presence of
[55:45] the Lord God amongst the Trees of the
[55:46] garden and the Lord God called onto Adam
[55:49] and said Where Art Thou and he said I
[55:52] heard thy voice in the garden and I was
[55:54] afraid afraid because I was naked and I
[55:57] hid myself you see when when when sin
[56:00] comes in you know you're you're you
[56:03] realize that that God you know he's he
[56:06] knows all things you know that God knows
[56:09] your situation there's nothing that you
[56:11] can hide from God Amen praise God you
[56:14] might as well settle it right now praise
[56:16] God if you want to move on with God you
[56:18] need to know that you're naked before
[56:20] God hallelujah God knows your life God
[56:23] knows your beginning God knows your End
[56:26] Amen so you might as well settle it
[56:27] right now and just say Lord I give up I
[56:30] Surrender I'm coming to you have your
[56:32] way with me have your way with my life
[56:35] Place me in the body of Christ do with
[56:37] me and use me as you see fit glory to
[56:40] God that's what he's looking for amen
[56:43] and so and he said who told thee that
[56:45] thou was naked hast thou eaten of the
[56:47] tree whereof I commanded thee that thou
[56:49] should us not eat and the man said the
[56:52] woman whom thou gavest to be with me me
[56:55] she gave me of the tree and I did eat he
[56:59] was very very conscious of exactly what
[57:03] he did let's look at this quote
[57:05] here he typed himself this is from
[57:08] Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[57:09] there's a lot of quotes and a lot of um
[57:13] I've drawn from you know this this
[57:15] message from Brother brandham Christ The
[57:17] Mystery of God revealed like I said go
[57:20] back listen to it read it it's it's
[57:23] tremendous there's so much in there that
[57:25] God is bringing to light and you know as
[57:28] we grow and as we mature and uh you know
[57:32] grow in Christ the word becomes like a
[57:36] new book every day because this is the
[57:39] Living God this is the present Living
[57:42] God Amen praise God he typed himself in
[57:45] Adam knowing what was right but walked
[57:48] out to redeem his
[57:50] wife Adam knew exactly what was right
[57:54] Adam knew that God said that you shall
[57:56] not eat of that tree Adam knew exactly
[57:59] what he was doing but Adam also knew
[58:02] that there was no way that she could die
[58:06] there was no way that he could kill her
[58:09] why because remember what we said she
[58:12] came from him she was him expressed Eve
[58:17] is Adam expressed there was no way that
[58:19] he could go and kill him and kill
[58:23] himself Christ didn't have to be sin he
[58:26] didn't have to be sin but he became sin
[58:29] because he knew that his word could not
[58:32] be broken the day you eat thereof ye
[58:35] shall surely die and it was from that
[58:38] point on that that the human race and
[58:41] everything on Earth began to die it had
[58:46] a beginning from that point and it would
[58:48] have an end because of the sin because
[58:51] of the Fall praise God and so he walked
[58:55] out and took sin to redeem his Lost
[58:58] Child amen Christ himself became sin he
[59:03] knew what Eve had
[59:05] done she deserved death but there was no
[59:09] way that he could kill her because she
[59:10] was him she was an expression of him
[59:13] praise God his own word Eve was Christ
[59:17] and he could not kill her because she
[59:20] was
[59:22] him expressed Hallelujah but you see we
[59:27] need to understand that there's a Plan
[59:29] of Redemption in order for this to all
[59:30] make
[59:31] sense we need something that that that
[59:34] brings all the scripture and all the
[59:37] purpose and the plan of God there needs
[59:40] to be an understanding of the Plan of
[59:42] Redemption in order for all of this to
[59:44] actually make sense for us uh in this
[59:47] day and in this hour as Christians and
[59:50] give us a a purpose and a and a reality
[59:53] of God of why it is that we serve God
[59:57] Amen praise God forever
[1:00:00] more The Plan of Redemption is what
[1:00:03] makes it all
[1:00:05] clear the mystery of Christ is that he
[1:00:08] always knew
[1:00:10] us he always knew that we were in him he
[1:00:14] always knew that we that that we were
[1:00:16] going to be expressed at a certain time
[1:00:18] and season in a certain dispensation in
[1:00:21] the word of God now let's go to the next
[1:00:24] uh uh slide I want to continue in
[1:00:26] Ephesians 29:33 because for here here
[1:00:30] here is where it makes it clear for no
[1:00:32] man ever hated his own
[1:00:35] flesh there's no way that Jesus Christ
[1:00:38] could hate
[1:00:40] Eve but nourisheth it and cherisheth
[1:00:43] even as the Lord the church so that's
[1:00:47] why your your Redemption and your
[1:00:51] salvation comes with no condition
[1:00:55] you're
[1:00:56] Justified you you you're you're already
[1:00:59] Justified you're already glorified you
[1:01:02] you're already perfect in the eyes of
[1:01:05] God all you need to do is believe and
[1:01:08] surrender to the word of God and let the
[1:01:11] spirit of God take possession and
[1:01:14] control of your life so that it can
[1:01:16] manifest the purpose that God placed in
[1:01:20] you to manifest so here he says uh um
[1:01:25] even as the Lord the church for we are
[1:01:27] members of his body and I want you to
[1:01:30] see here because we're going to
[1:01:32] something here members of his body of
[1:01:36] his
[1:01:37] flesh and his bones remember Adam said
[1:01:41] she's Flesh of My Flesh bone of my bone
[1:01:45] it's because she was actually an
[1:01:47] expression of Jesus
[1:01:49] Christ Christ condescending and coming
[1:01:52] into this world and into this dimension
[1:01:55] in order to fulfill the Plan of
[1:01:58] Redemption makes him and gives him the
[1:02:02] ability to actually possess you as a son
[1:02:07] or daughter of God because you are an
[1:02:10] attribute of God there's a portion of
[1:02:12] God inside of you and so you are
[1:02:16] actually the body of his flesh and of
[1:02:20] his bones amen for this cause shall a
[1:02:23] man leave his father and mother and
[1:02:25] shall be joined unto his wife and they
[1:02:28] too shall be one
[1:02:31] flesh so if you're in Christ like we
[1:02:34] claim that we're in Christ we got the
[1:02:36] Holy Ghost if the same spirit that
[1:02:37] raised Christ from the dead dwell in you
[1:02:39] it's going to Quicken your mortal body
[1:02:42] that same spirit is quickening you that
[1:02:45] same spirit is what's operating through
[1:02:47] you that same spirit is what's living
[1:02:49] through you and that same spirit is
[1:02:52] what's making and bringing the the
[1:02:54] interpretation of the word made flesh in
[1:02:57] this
[1:02:58] day
[1:03:00] Hallelujah they shall be they too shall
[1:03:05] be one flesh now this is a great mystery
[1:03:08] but I speak concerning Christ and the
[1:03:12] bride and the church remember the
[1:03:16] mystery was always in the back part of
[1:03:18] God's
[1:03:19] mind before Adam was created in the
[1:03:24] image of God God already had in the back
[1:03:27] part of his mind that this was going to
[1:03:30] be a plan and a and there would be a
[1:03:32] mystery that would be wrapped up in his
[1:03:35] plan and that mystery would only be
[1:03:38] unveiled in the days of the voice of the
[1:03:41] seventh angel all these Mysteries would
[1:03:44] be unveiled that's why God had to send a
[1:03:47] prophet amen praise God so we need to
[1:03:50] understand that there's a mystery that
[1:03:52] God is unveiling in this day and in this
[1:03:55] hour and that you're part of that
[1:03:57] mystery that you're a part of that body
[1:04:00] that you're a supernatural living
[1:04:04] mystical flesh and Bone body of Jesus
[1:04:08] Christ and when we come together we are
[1:04:11] literally
[1:04:12] Christ in Bride form fulfilling the
[1:04:16] word that's the only one that's going to
[1:04:19] take the Rapture remember it's only
[1:04:22] Christ and those that are quickened by
[1:04:25] the word in the moment in the twinkling
[1:04:27] of an eye you can't go in the Rapture
[1:04:29] unless you are the body of Jesus
[1:04:34] Christ so he's talking here about the
[1:04:38] mystery but I speak concerning Christ
[1:04:41] and the church
[1:04:42] nevertheless let every one of you in
[1:04:45] particular so love his wife even as
[1:04:49] himself and the wife see that she
[1:04:52] reverence her husband
[1:04:54] this is absolutely required in the body
[1:04:58] of Christ a True Believer somebody that
[1:05:01] has a revelation of their position in
[1:05:05] the word of God knowing that that's why
[1:05:08] we are baptized because we're taking his
[1:05:11] name remember everything that we do in
[1:05:15] word or deed or anything that we do as
[1:05:19] as human beings if we are expressing
[1:05:21] Christ then we're going to do everything
[1:05:24] thing that the word tells us we're going
[1:05:28] to fulfill the scripture when we get
[1:05:32] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:05:35] Christ and we take on his name we are
[1:05:38] identifying ourselves as his bride that
[1:05:42] we are the obedient Eve now we're not
[1:05:45] the disobedient churches that that want
[1:05:49] to take the word of God put their own
[1:05:51] man-made traditions on it and and and
[1:05:54] make it fit their lives instead of their
[1:05:56] lives fitting to the word people want to
[1:06:00] just live any way they want they want to
[1:06:02] put an interpretation on God's word that
[1:06:05] they can live any way anyhow but they
[1:06:07] don't want to come according to the word
[1:06:10] of God but when we get identified by
[1:06:13] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:06:15] Christ it shows that we are outwardly
[1:06:19] expressing the Revelation that we know
[1:06:22] that we are in Christ that we are taking
[1:06:27] his name that we are in the body of
[1:06:30] Christ we are identifying as the
[1:06:33] manifested word of God for this day and
[1:06:35] in this hour and when we do that we
[1:06:38] manifest the word made flesh and that's
[1:06:42] why we go to the
[1:06:44] baptism amen praise God
[1:06:49] hallelujah
[1:06:51] next look notice this brother Braham
[1:06:54] saying here he says but God fornew the
[1:06:56] bride in the groom God knew the bride
[1:07:00] was in the groom God knew that that that
[1:07:03] that his his Eve his restored Eve was
[1:07:06] was there it was going to come perfect
[1:07:09] amen God forsaw the bride in the groom
[1:07:12] Hallelujah see to save his wife like
[1:07:15] Adam he had to go with her Adam knowed
[1:07:18] what he was doing Eve didn't know what
[1:07:21] she was doing but Adam walked out with
[1:07:24] his wife amen she went into a spiritual
[1:07:28] Amnesia she she fell into a disbelief
[1:07:31] she fell into sin just like you we're
[1:07:34] the bride of Christ and we've always
[1:07:36] been the bride of Christ but when we
[1:07:38] came into this Dimension we fell into
[1:07:40] sin we were born in sin shaped in
[1:07:44] iniquity we were we were under an
[1:07:47] Amnesia we were we didn't know who we
[1:07:49] really were we heard about church we
[1:07:51] heard about Jesus Christ we heard about
[1:07:54] about salvation we did the the the
[1:07:56] doctrines of man we did the traditions
[1:07:58] of man if you're a Roman Catholic you
[1:08:00] would go through all the you know
[1:08:02] baptizing as a baby which is totally
[1:08:04] unscriptural first communion first
[1:08:07] communion you know when your first
[1:08:08] communion is is when you're born again
[1:08:10] and you receive the Holy Ghost and the
[1:08:12] spirit of God comes upon you and you
[1:08:14] have a supernatural communion with God
[1:08:17] not because of some tradition where you
[1:08:19] take you know kids at at the age of 10
[1:08:22] or 11 and they and and they go for first
[1:08:25] communion it's you know what it's it's
[1:08:27] all it's all rituals it's all religious
[1:08:30] rituals they appear good and you know
[1:08:33] they seem good and you know they're
[1:08:35] they're teaching you know they're
[1:08:37] teaching from the Bible they teach the
[1:08:39] Bible but it's not the word of God it's
[1:08:42] not God's provided way a baby cannot
[1:08:45] repent there's no way a baby can repent
[1:08:48] the Bible says repent and be baptized in
[1:08:51] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they
[1:08:53] baptized into the titles of Father Son
[1:08:55] and Holy Ghost because they have a
[1:08:58] trinitarian understanding of God making
[1:09:00] him three in one God is not three in one
[1:09:03] God is one there's only one God so all
[1:09:07] of these Traditions amen but Adam knew
[1:09:10] and know what he was doing Eve didn't
[1:09:13] know what she was doing but Adam walked
[1:09:15] out with his wife see and Jesus took his
[1:09:18] wife's place and became sin for her
[1:09:22] remember he became you he stood in your
[1:09:25] punishment that you might stand in his
[1:09:29] place amen God had to come down that's
[1:09:33] why you know you talk about Believing on
[1:09:35] the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be
[1:09:37] saved and you tell people you need to
[1:09:39] believe Jesus Christ as your savior you
[1:09:42] need to accept him because he's the one
[1:09:45] that paid the price he's the one that
[1:09:48] went to Calvary and took sin upon
[1:09:50] himself just like Adam he took that sin
[1:09:53] sin upon himself because he knew that if
[1:09:56] he put the sin on himself and he covered
[1:09:59] Eve that Eve could not die Eve Eve would
[1:10:03] not be destroyed his bride would not be
[1:10:05] lost amen praise God that's why you
[1:10:08] can't be lost you cannot you you cannot
[1:10:11] be lost God has already ordained it from
[1:10:15] the foundations of the world your name
[1:10:17] was written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:10:20] you heard the word and you know Faith
[1:10:22] cometh by hearing and you were a sheep
[1:10:25] and you heard your Shepherd and you
[1:10:27] heard his word and you obeyed the word
[1:10:29] of God Amen you had no choice because it
[1:10:32] made perfect sense to you it's who you
[1:10:35] are amen praise God he stood your
[1:10:38] punishment that you might stand in his
[1:10:40] place he stood in your place that you
[1:10:43] might stand in his place what a love
[1:10:46] what a fellowship amen praise God
[1:10:49] Allelujah next slide listen here
[1:10:54] now I thank God that we had a prophet
[1:10:59] because I'll tell you something you know
[1:11:01] if we hadn't had the prophet of Malachi
[1:11:04] 4:5 if God hadn't sent us a prophet
[1:11:07] there's no way we could be bringing out
[1:11:10] these these Eternal truths because God
[1:11:13] was was operating through William
[1:11:16] Branham amen praise God he was operating
[1:11:19] through William Branham to um
[1:11:26] let me read something here now listen
[1:11:30] closely here understand that brother
[1:11:34] Branham there was there was a Ministry
[1:11:37] of Malachi 45 but it was all Christ
[1:11:41] Revelations 10:7 it was all Christ
[1:11:44] remember the word of God comes to the
[1:11:46] prophet amen praise God we need to put
[1:11:49] the prophet in his proper place amen the
[1:11:53] word word of God needs to be properly
[1:11:55] placed so that we can understand this
[1:11:57] has always been Jesus Christ listen to
[1:12:00] brother Bram he says now I want you to
[1:12:02] know this this this is sure and you that
[1:12:06] listen to the to this tape you might
[1:12:08] have thought today this is from the
[1:12:10] message anointed ones at the end time he
[1:12:13] says you might have thought today that I
[1:12:14] was trying to say that about myself
[1:12:18] being that I was packing this message
[1:12:20] because brother Brandon was talking
[1:12:22] about you know the supernatural that was
[1:12:24] taking place and how it was happening in
[1:12:26] his ministry and how the Supernatural
[1:12:28] and how he could discern the thoughts
[1:12:30] and the intents of the heart listen what
[1:12:32] he's saying here he says he says packing
[1:12:35] that that being that I was packing this
[1:12:37] message you know you're packing a
[1:12:39] message in this hour brother brandham
[1:12:40] was packing a message in his day amen
[1:12:43] but he had a he had a prophetic message
[1:12:45] he was the prophet of Malachi 45 he was
[1:12:48] the prophet of of of Revelations 10:7 he
[1:12:50] was Luke
[1:12:51] 17:30 amen praise God we need to realize
[1:12:54] and recognize his position in the word
[1:12:56] of God but it was all Christ and look
[1:12:59] what he says here I have no more to do
[1:13:01] with it than nothing no more than just a
[1:13:05] voice he says and my voice even against
[1:13:08] my better judgment I wanted to be a
[1:13:11] Trapper but it's the will of my father
[1:13:13] that I declare to do and determine to do
[1:13:17] I wasn't the one that appeared down on
[1:13:20] the river I was only standing there when
[1:13:23] when he
[1:13:24] appeared hallelujah praise God I'm not
[1:13:28] the one that performs these things and
[1:13:30] foretells these things that happens as
[1:13:33] perfect as they are I'm only one that's
[1:13:36] near when he does it I was only a voice
[1:13:41] that he used to say it it wasn't what I
[1:13:46] knew it's what I just surrendered myself
[1:13:49] to that he spoke through it isn't me it
[1:13:55] wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was
[1:13:58] the manifestation of the son of man it
[1:14:01] wasn't the angel his message it was the
[1:14:05] mystery that God unfolded it's not a man
[1:14:09] it's God the angel was not the son of
[1:14:12] man he was the messenger from the son of
[1:14:15] man the son of man is Christ he is the
[1:14:20] one that you're feeding on H Allelujah
[1:14:24] that's what we're feeding on here
[1:14:25] tonight amen we're not feeding on a man
[1:14:28] we're not feeding on man's theology
[1:14:31] man's teachings we're not feeding we're
[1:14:33] feeding on the on the body word of Jesus
[1:14:36] Christ and there's only one way you can
[1:14:38] feed on that and that is by
[1:14:40] revelation God has to reveal to you what
[1:14:43] he's saying in his word God has to
[1:14:46] reveal to you your part in the word God
[1:14:49] has to reveal to you that you are the
[1:14:51] word made flesh in this hour
[1:14:53] it's not something that you can because
[1:14:56] brother brandham says it you you you you
[1:14:59] believe it and that and then you are it
[1:15:01] no no it's because God said so it's
[1:15:04] because God's God's vindicating it from
[1:15:07] his word and then he's vindicating it
[1:15:10] through a prophet and if you go back and
[1:15:12] you and you listen to the messages of
[1:15:14] William brandom you go back and you
[1:15:16] study the life of William brandom you
[1:15:18] will see the supernatural was there was
[1:15:21] more supernat natural in his ministry
[1:15:24] now I'm not saying this to to to you
[1:15:27] know to say that he was more than Jesus
[1:15:29] Christ but he produced more
[1:15:33] Supernatural raising of the Dead healing
[1:15:37] of the sick uh Discerning of spirits in
[1:15:42] 1100 tapes from 1933 all the way to
[1:15:47] 1965 there's 1100 tapes if anybody does
[1:15:50] their study and does their research they
[1:15:53] will see that it was a man that was
[1:15:56] being Vindicated by the supernatural God
[1:16:01] that the voice that was speaking through
[1:16:03] William brandom was the voice of God
[1:16:06] when he was under that anointing to
[1:16:08] discern their hearts discern their lives
[1:16:10] bring the teachings on the scriptures
[1:16:12] bring the opening of those Seven Seals
[1:16:15] brother brandham didn't open those Seven
[1:16:17] Seals hallelujah it's the mighty Angel
[1:16:20] himself it was Christ it was the Holy
[1:16:23] Spirit the mighty Angel come down put
[1:16:25] his foot on the ocean put his foot on
[1:16:27] the land and on the sea and said time
[1:16:30] shall be no more there would be no more
[1:16:33] time there would be no more ages it was
[1:16:35] now going to enter into the Eternal age
[1:16:39] we were going to come under a
[1:16:40] supernatural age where there was going
[1:16:42] to become a supernatural bride was going
[1:16:45] to come into full view Hallelujah Christ
[1:16:49] was going to fulfill his purpose and his
[1:16:51] plan and if you go back and you listen
[1:16:53] to those messages you will hear the
[1:16:55] Vindication of God you will see the
[1:16:58] supernatural you will know that it was
[1:17:00] not a man that could possibly say those
[1:17:03] things tell people where they lived
[1:17:05] where they came
[1:17:06] from pray over the dead and raised right
[1:17:09] there in front of the people that was
[1:17:12] only Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:17:15] today and forever that could possibly do
[1:17:18] that you're not feeding on a man a man
[1:17:21] his words will fail but you're feeding
[1:17:24] on the unfailing body word of the son of
[1:17:28] man amen praise God hallelujah thank you
[1:17:32] Jesus glory to God Amen thank you Jesus
