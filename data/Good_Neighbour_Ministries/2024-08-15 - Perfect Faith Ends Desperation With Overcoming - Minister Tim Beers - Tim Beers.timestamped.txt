[19:25] hallelujah all right Mark
[19:31] 5:25 and a certain woman which had an
[19:34] issue of blood 12
[19:36] years and had suffered many things of
[19:40] many Physicians think about it many
[19:43] Physicians and had spent all that she
[19:46] had and was nothing better but rather
[19:50] grew
[19:51] worse when she had heard of Jesus
[19:56] hallelujah amen she heard the revelation
[19:59] of the hour came in and pressed behind
[20:03] and touched His
[20:05] Garment for she said if I may touch but
[20:10] his clothes I shall be whole
[20:14] Hallelujah watch as we continue
[20:17] here how great our faith is and straight
[20:21] way the Fountain of her blood was dried
[20:26] up and she felt in her body
[20:29] that she was healed of that plague see
[20:32] that's perfect
[20:33] Faith that's perfect Faith right there
[20:37] and Jesus immediately knowing in himself
[20:39] that virtue had gone out of him turned
[20:43] him about and pressed and said who
[20:46] touched my
[20:48] clothes and his disciples said unto him
[20:51] thou seest a multitud thr in thee and
[20:54] sayest who touched me and he looked
[20:57] around about to to see
[21:00] her that he that had done this thing but
[21:04] the woman fearing and trembling knowing
[21:07] that she that what was done in her came
[21:11] and fell down before him and told him
[21:14] all the
[21:16] truth you see she knew what was done in
[21:19] her and he said unto her daughter thy
[21:22] faith had made thee whole go in peace
[21:26] and be whole of thy plague
[21:29] while he yet spake there came another
[21:32] ruler of the synagogue
[21:35] house how
[21:37] certain which
[21:40] said thy daughter is dead why troubles
[21:43] thou the master any further as soon as
[21:46] Jesus heard the word that was spoken he
[21:49] said unto the ruler of the synagogue Be
[21:52] not Afraid only believe and he suffered
[21:56] no man to follow him say Peter Peter
[21:58] James and John the brother of James and
[22:02] he cometh into the house of the ruler of
[22:04] the synagogue and
[22:08] seeth the
[22:12] timum and them that weep and whale
[22:16] greatly and when he was come in he said
[22:19] unto them why make ye this ad do and
[22:24] Weep the damsel is not
[22:27] dead but she
[22:29] sleepeth and they laughed him to
[22:32] scorn they laughed him to scorn here
[22:34] they are Weeping and wailing
[22:37] supposedly because somebody died and
[22:40] then somebody comes in and says she's
[22:42] not dead and they're and they turn from
[22:43] weeping and wailing to laughing there's
[22:46] got to be a problem
[22:50] there and he took the dams on on his
[22:52] hand and he said unto her tell
[22:58] didn't pronounce that right but which
[23:00] being interpreted damsel I say unto thee
[23:04] arise and straight way the damsel arose
[23:08] and walked for she was of age of 12
[23:12] years and they were
[23:15] astonished with the great
[23:17] astonishment and he charged them
[23:19] straightly that no man should know it
[23:22] and commande that something should be
[23:24] given to her to eat amen let us pray
[23:28] father thank you for your word tonight I
[23:31] pray in the name of Jesus that you would
[23:33] bless us Lord Inspire us and anoint us
[23:36] now we just commit ourselves to thee
[23:38] father we bind the power of
[23:40] Satan oh God come in our midst Lord put
[23:44] a wall of fire and a hedge around us
[23:45] Lord help us now Lord I pray in Jesus
[23:48] name you may be seated as I read a
[23:50] couple more scriptures here amen talking
[23:54] about desperation tonight hallelujah
[23:58] amen man Romans 8:26 likewise the spirit
[24:03] also helpeth our infirmities for we know
[24:05] not what we should pray as we ought but
[24:09] the spirit itself maketh intercession
[24:11] for us with groanings which cannot be
[24:14] uttered and he that searches the hearts
[24:16] knoweth what is in the mind of the
[24:18] spirit because he maketh intercession
[24:20] for the Saints according to the will of
[24:23] God for we know that all things work
[24:27] together for good to them that love love
[24:28] God and to them who are called according
[24:31] to his purpose hallelujah amen for whom
[24:35] he did forn he also predestinated to be
[24:38] conformed to the image of his son that
[24:40] he might be the firstborn amongst many
[24:42] Brethren moreover whom he had
[24:45] predestinated them he also called and
[24:47] whom he called he justified and whom he
[24:50] justified he glorified what shall we say
[24:53] then to these
[24:55] things if God be for us who can be
[24:59] against us God has placed so much in the
[25:02] word of God Amen so much
[25:06] assurance that we will overcome amen
[25:11] hallelujah that he will not fail but his
[25:14] word will not return to him void but it
[25:17] will accomplish what he set forth to do
[25:20] hallelujah it's not the word that has
[25:22] the problem it's always us amen and
[25:26] that's why God puts us allows us to get
[25:29] into States and conditions and times and
[25:32] seasons of
[25:34] desperation
[25:37] hallelujah amen Hebrews 4:11 let us
[25:41] labor therefore to enter into the rest
[25:44] lest any man fall short of the same
[25:46] example of unbelief for the word of God
[25:49] is quick and powerful and sharper than
[25:52] any two-edged sword Pierce and even
[25:54] dividing a Sunder of Soul and Spirit and
[25:57] the joints of the Merill and is a
[25:59] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[26:01] the heart you can't hide from God we are
[26:04] naked before God he knows everything
[26:08] amen hallelujah everything he but all
[26:13] things are naked and open unto his eyes
[26:17] of him of whom we have to do seeing that
[26:20] we have a great high priest that has
[26:22] passed through the heavens Jesus the son
[26:25] of God let us hold fast our per
[26:28] for we we have not a high priest which
[26:32] cannot be touched by the feeling of our
[26:35] infirmities but was in all points
[26:38] tempted like as we are yet without sin
[26:43] nothing that he has gone
[26:45] through nothing that you can ever go
[26:48] through or pass through that he has not
[26:51] experienced and he experienced it and he
[26:54] went through it without sin Hallelujah
[26:58] amen glory to God so let us therefore
[27:05] boldly unto the come boldly unto the
[27:09] throne of grace that may we may obtain
[27:12] mercy and find Grace in the time of need
[27:19] Hallelujah glory to God Amen
[27:24] desperation
[27:26] hallelujah what is the full meaning of
[27:30] desperation loss of Hope and surrender
[27:33] to
[27:35] despair have we ever been have you ever
[27:38] been desperate
[27:39] before have you ever
[27:42] experienced desperation before I hope
[27:46] tonight as we finish and leave here
[27:49] tonight that you walk out of these doors
[27:52] with hope with faith amen knowing that
[27:56] desperation worketh for for our good
[28:00] hallelujah it's a tool that God uses in
[28:03] his hand to develop and mold and shape
[28:06] us amen what does desperation feel like
[28:12] or the feeling desperation mean the
[28:16] feeling of needing or wanting something
[28:20] very
[28:21] much his desperation to survive you want
[28:25] it so badly Hallelujah
[28:28] that you got to have it to
[28:32] survive that's what desperation is man
[28:35] Hallelujah the loss of Hope and
[28:38] surrender to
[28:40] despair
[28:42] Hallelujah desperation to
[28:45] survive
[28:47] Hallelujah now brother Brandon's
[28:49] speaking
[28:51] here
[28:53] hallelujah and and Desperation most of
[28:56] my quotes are going to be taken from
[28:57] desperation and perfect Faith usually it
[29:00] takes a state of desperation or a state
[29:03] of emergency to throw us into
[29:05] desperation see it's too bad it has to
[29:08] do that but human beings are so slothful
[29:12] in their minds it takes at an emergency
[29:16] something arise and when it does then it
[29:19] throws us into that
[29:21] desperation and in desperation it brings
[29:24] out the real thing that you are amen
[29:28] amen it shows what you are made of in
[29:32] the time of
[29:34] desperation oh yes my brothers when
[29:37] you're under pressure Hallelujah not
[29:39] when everything is going good not when
[29:41] everything is smooth in your life
[29:44] Hallelujah but under that desperation
[29:47] under that state of desperation that
[29:50] circumstance that you're under that
[29:52] sickness whatever it might be tonight
[29:55] amen whatever it might be in the future
[29:59] it brings out the real that's inside of
[30:02] you and like David said Lord if there be
[30:04] any evil inside of me take it out of me
[30:07] work on me deal with me amen I want my
[30:10] lamp trimmed amen I want my lamp trimmed
[30:14] I want my lamp filled with oil in this
[30:16] hour Hallelujah you talk about
[30:19] desperation we should be in a state of
[30:22] desperation
[30:24] hallelujah
[30:26] hallelujah it usually pulls us out of
[30:30] pulls all the good things that is in you
[30:33] in time of death I've heard people when

[35:32] desperation in our soul David said my
[35:35] soul thirst it for the Living God As the
[35:37] deer paned for the water so does my soul
[35:40] thirst for the Living God in my waken

[36:12] pushing out the darkness and the flesh
[36:14] will fight the flesh is at enemity with
[36:17] God this mind Hallelujah and we fight
[36:20] for years as God molds and shapes us
[36:23] amen but that light when that light
[36:25] comes in and you've been awakened you
[36:27] been born again you are in a constant
[36:30] state of desperation for who for him for
[36:34] him to know him in the power of his
[36:37] resurrection and that is knowing you and
[36:40] knowing who you are something inside of
[36:42] you says who am I Lord hallelujah what
[36:46] am I placed here for what is this
[36:48] calling into the message which I believe
[36:51] God said a prophet what is this for me
[36:53] what does it mean for me in my life
[36:56] Hallelujah that's a constant state of
[36:59] desperation because we can never get
[37:01] enough of God his word is eternal he's
[37:03] Eternal it's constantly unfolding
[37:05] unfolding it's going to unfold for
[37:07] eternity how can you get enough am amen
[37:10] how can you say you had enough how can
[37:12] you say you know all the revelation of
[37:14] this message you do not know the all the

[37:22] amen God is revealing it and revealing
[37:24] it
[37:26] Hallelujah and number
[37:28] two and there is a desperation that has
[37:32] an end to
[37:33] it there's a desperation that never has
[37:37] an end and there's a desperation that we
[37:39] go through and we experience both of
[37:41] them that never has an end to
[37:44] it people in desperation are often
[37:47] willing and able to do things they
[37:50] wouldn't
[37:51] otherwise
[37:53] consider that's the
[37:55] truth such as breaking the law or
[37:59] begging for help depending on others
[38:01] this treacherous Behavior can sometimes
[38:04] seem not logical or reasonable but
[38:08] sometimes leads to surprising
[38:10] outcomes oh
[38:13] my have you ever walked with the Lord
[38:16] have you ever had an experience here and
[38:19] online amen that you never thought you
[38:22] would go through things you never
[38:24] thought that you know certain things
[38:26] would come in back back into your life
[38:28] and tempt you and try you from your past
[38:32] certain sins that you thought were gone
[38:34] that are still alive and they come
[38:37] alive oh my
[38:41] Hallelujah put you in a state of
[38:43] desperation makes you do things
[38:46] Hallelujah that you didn't think that
[38:48] you were going to
[38:49] do they are
[38:51] desperate for the encounter with God
[38:55] there is one woman who was subject to
[38:58] bleeding for 12 years just think about
[39:00] her now we're going to get into a few
[39:02] subjects here few people
[39:04] here she had a problem with her monthly
[39:07] cycle and could not find no relief in
[39:11] spite of seeking medical attention due
[39:14] to her problem she would have been
[39:17] considered unclean think about it you
[39:21] got to go back and look at the times
[39:24] that this was written in and what they
[39:27] went went through in the times that they
[39:29] were in to see their
[39:31] faith now her condition today wouldn't
[39:35] be it wouldn't be plagued to our sisters
[39:37] here if they had a problem there as
[39:39] unclean but back then she was
[39:43] unclean to the Old Testament standards
[39:46] she could not go into the temple she
[39:48] could not come to church because of that
[39:52] situation that sickness or have any
[39:56] physical contact with any other human
[39:58] being think about it now you starting to
[40:02] see why she did what she did by faith
[40:06] how she acted the way she acted by
[40:09] faith she was basically all
[40:13] alone cut off from God and man think
[40:17] about it that despiration feeling
[40:21] sometimes it makes us feel cut off you
[40:24] ever feel cut off and alone from God and
[40:27] man you ever feel that nobody
[40:29] understands what you're going through oh
[40:31] yes many times
[40:34] hallelujah
[40:36] amen she was so desperate for God to
[40:41] touch and to be
[40:43] healed she was desperate to find out if
[40:46] Jesus could heal her as an unclean woman
[40:49] in the day and time she would not have
[40:52] dared to approach Jesus face to face
[40:55] think about it
[40:57] it was a no
[40:58] no not face to
[41:02] face apparently she decided that she
[41:05] would try to sneak and touch
[41:07] him she wanted to
[41:10] do a drive by touch on Jesus think about
[41:15] it how
[41:16] powerful she was cut
[41:19] off from Every
[41:22] Avenue every
[41:24] privilege was cut off from her because
[41:27] of this
[41:29] plague but Faith still found the way in
[41:33] desperation Faith
[41:35] came and found the way to touch
[41:40] Jesus Hallelujah we read that story we
[41:43] wonder we we think of it so humble oh
[41:46] she knelt down and touched the Hem of
[41:49] His Garment that's not what the story
[41:51] was about if she was allowed she would
[41:54] have went face to face and asked them
[41:56] like every like so many people in the
[41:58] Bible but she was not allowed to do that
[42:01] so in
[42:03] desperation Hallelujah the Holy Spirit I
[42:05] believe spoke to
[42:08] her and said do a driveby touch Touch
[42:12] the Hem of my garment
[42:15] Hallelujah glory to God Amen what kind
[42:19] of faith is that my brothers and sisters
[42:21] sometimes we can't even drive the church
[42:23] sometimes we can't even make any kind of
[42:25] sacrifice for this gospel in the last
[42:28] days and look at her condition and her
[42:31] situation the story says she came up
[42:34] behind him in the crowd she touched his
[42:38] cloak because she thought if she touches
[42:41] his
[42:42] clothes I will be healed I love that
[42:45] fact that this woman decided to go after
[42:47] Jesus not in her desperation not in
[42:51] everything that has failed everybody has
[42:53] forsook her Hallelujah no
[42:57] hope no hope in a state of desperation
[43:00] for her but in that state of desperation
[43:03] she decided to go after Jesus she didn't
[43:07] let the devil amen persuade her to go
[43:09] back she went for Jesus no matter what
[43:13] it looked like what doubts and unbelief
[43:16] that was coming into her mind that
[43:18] she'll never be healed she's going to
[43:19] die in this condition she said no no she
[43:23] went after Jesus all the circumstances
[43:26] against her all the law against her all
[43:29] the people against her no she still went
[43:32] after
[43:33] Jesus hallelujah what a touch we sing
[43:37] that song Touching Jesus amen that's all
[43:40] that matters I don't care how you touch
[43:42] him where you touch him but touch him
[43:45] amen and your desperation will come to
[43:48] an
[43:49] end
[43:50] Hallelujah glory to
[43:53] God Amen she was gonna press through she
[43:57] was desperate to touch him hallelujah
[44:00] amen if her broken body and her soul
[44:04] could somehow get in contact with the
[44:06] essence of this man Jesus perhaps his
[44:11] his very nature would change her oh my
[44:15] what faith amen glory to God tonight
[44:20] amen oh touching Jesus that's all that
[44:25] really matters

[45:01] on Paul's suffering 2 Corinthians
[45:06] 11:27 the Apostle Paul description of
[45:09] his trials also highlighted desperation
[45:13] from physical
[45:15] deprivation in 2 Corinthians 11:27 he
[45:19] recounts in
[45:21] weariness in
[45:23] painfulness in watchings often think
[45:26] about it in hunger and thirst in

[45:34] nakedness Paul
[45:36] relentlessly missioned worked brought
[45:40] him face to face with physical
[45:44] sufferings constantly because of his
[45:47] work and his calling from Paul's words
[45:50] we can learn perseverance in faith
[45:54] despite his hardship Paul REM a
[45:57] steadfast in the mission of Faith
[46:00] serving as an example of his unwavering
[46:04] commitment oh so many people start so

[47:14] excuses but the Lord answered him back
[47:17] and said Paul my grace is sufficient for
[47:20] you in your weakness you're going to be
[47:22] made strong Hallelujah and then Paul
[47:26] says now Hallelujah my faith I've heard
[47:30] from the Lord amen in my weakness I'll
[47:33] be made strong now I'll Glory think
[47:37] about it now I'll glory in my

[1:08:36] execution a death inside of you or
[1:08:39] applying that token there will be no
[1:08:41] long-term lasting results getting

[1:09:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost every day of
[1:09:46] your life and still go to hell because
[1:09:48] it's not the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:09:49] in This Hour it's the Holy Ghost himself

[1:09:55] himself and the baptism is just
[1:09:57] blessings hallelujah
[1:10:00] amen glory to God however many cases uh

[1:10:13] word of God you
[1:10:16] understand that digs deep within us amen
[1:10:21] that word that we understand not with

[1:10:35] figure out by your intellect like Jesus

[1:10:39] revealed it unto you but my father has
[1:10:41] revealed it unto you amen you didn't
[1:10:43] come to me and say I am the Son of God
[1:10:46] on your own understanding or that you
[1:10:48] looked at me for the last three years
[1:10:49] and figured it out on your own no and
[1:10:53] that's where a lot of places are in the
[1:10:56] message today because we have all the
[1:10:58] books and the tapes we try to figure it
[1:11:00] out on our own no it's still the same
[1:11:03] thing today flesh and blood cannot
[1:11:05] reveal it the tapes cannot reveal it
[1:11:08] unto you but only my Father which is in
[1:11:10] heaven can reveal and give you the
[1:11:13] understanding that you need in this hour
[1:11:16] the tapes are good everything is good
[1:11:19] Hallelujah the letter kill it but the

[1:11:44] things in front we're going to talk
[1:11:45] about that on part two how God swws the
[1:11:48] seed and how the the enemy has so many
[1:11:52] different tactics that try to take that
[1:11:54] word of God out of of you Hallelujah

[1:15:52] perfect word and resist
[1:15:55] Satan death think about it listen to me
[1:15:58] my brothers and sisters death couldn't
[1:16:01] even stand in his
[1:16:03] presence why because people are like
[1:16:06] everybody make him he was a holy man and
[1:16:07] that we know that but
[1:16:10] see Jesus could have defeated Satan with
[1:16:13] his power but he didn't he could have
[1:16:16] defeated Satan in a lot of different
[1:16:18] ways but he didn't he took the word he
[1:16:21] took the word and defeated Satan
[1:16:26] Hallelujah because he was the
[1:16:28] word and Jesus is saying to us I want
[1:16:32] that word to become you me and you one
[1:16:35] in the same again and it's that word
[1:16:39] that death couldn't even stand in his
[1:16:42] presence sickness couldn't stand in his
[1:16:45] presence flowing from him was Rivers
[1:16:48] like virtue going out constantly Rivers
[1:16:51] going into his
[1:16:53] garments we talked about that these
[1:16:56] people lying in the shadows just put one
[1:16:59] finger on His Garment and was healed
[1:17:02] when that woman done that then everybody
[1:17:05] wanted to touch His Garment because they
[1:17:08] seen that there was virtue going out
[1:17:10] from him constantly flowing like
[1:17:14] Rivers see why because he believ that
[1:17:20] word he believed who he was he knew who
[1:17:23] he was he had perfect faith in who he
[1:17:26] was you see where that anointing is
[1:17:29] that's why brother brand preached false
[1:17:31] anointed ones at the end time because an
[1:17:33] anointing can come on the rain falls on
[1:17:35] the just and the unjust the rain the
[1:17:37] that anointing can come on without
[1:17:39] having the word who you are inside
[1:17:42] that's that that's what produced This
[1:17:45] Not That anointing out there all these
[1:17:47] false anointings out there that word
[1:17:49] that anointed word was what produced all
[1:17:52] this in Jesus's life Hallelujah and the
[1:17:55] same word brother Brandon would come
[1:17:57] into a meeting and for 50 miles 100
[1:17:59] miles people were just being healed
[1:18:01] healed healed because of that anointing
[1:18:03] when he came why because he was a holy
[1:18:05] man and that no it was a holy God it was
[1:18:07] the revelation of the word amen that he
[1:18:11] was constantly in desperation in his
[1:18:13] life dying out to making it live it was
[1:18:17] living that token was being applied in
[1:18:19] his life that's what's the anointing
[1:18:21] that Jesus produced amen now if you AB
[1:18:24] AB in me through him he brought the word
[1:18:27] to you and my words abide in you then
[1:18:31] walk in the same kind of way virtue will
[1:18:33] flow from you but if it's really there
