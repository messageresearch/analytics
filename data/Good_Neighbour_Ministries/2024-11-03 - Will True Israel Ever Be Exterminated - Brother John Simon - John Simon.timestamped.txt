[30:51] desire first of all I just want to um on
[30:54] behalf of my wife sister Jennifer and I
[30:57] I want to thank thank you each and every
[30:59] one of you for the wonderful um blessing
[31:03] that you showed us last Sunday uh with
[31:06] the dedication for the pastor and his
[31:09] wife we so appreciate everything that
[31:11] was done um the wonderful poem that uh
[31:15] the young people and our Sunday school
[31:17] children put together for us you know
[31:19] going back and pulling out all the
[31:21] titles from the messages that I'd
[31:23] ministered over the year and putting it
[31:25] together it was just beautiful and I so

[34:27] under a sacrificial lamb under the blood
[34:31] amen and we bring our children to the
[34:34] Lord and we offer whatever we offer we
[34:37] offer under the blood by accepting and
[34:41] recognizing that Jesus Christ was our
[34:45] absolute propitiation for our sin and so
[34:49] we come to the Lord by the blood of
[34:51] Christ amen that is our relationship
[34:54] that is our uh inheritance and it says
[34:57] here and brought the child to Eli who
[34:59] was the priest and she said oh my Lord
[35:03] as thy soul liveth my Lord I am the
[35:06] woman that stood by thee here praying
[35:09] unto the Lord for this child I prayed
[35:13] and the Lord hath given me my petition
[35:16] which I asked of him therefore also I
[35:20] have lent him to the Lord now pay
[35:23] attention here this is what we want to
[35:25] look at as long as he liveth he shall be
[35:29] lent to the Lord amen and he worshiped

[35:48] but also Joshua another wonderful gift
[35:52] and addition to your
[35:55] family the greatest thing that you
[35:57] Joseph Joseph and Rachel have done in

[36:03] you gave yourselves to the Lord you
[36:07] submitted to his word when it came to
[36:10] you amen and there's no greater Victory

[36:46] into Joy because of your faith and
[36:49] dedication to the Lord the Lord has

[37:02] joy amen your love for the Lord and for
[37:06] one another has produced this beautiful
[37:09] son Joshua prise God I believe the
[37:13] Lord has given you Joshua as a gift as
[37:17] it says in the next scripture in Psalms
[37:20] 127 three low children are inh Heritage
[37:25] of the Lord
[37:27] and the fruit of the womb is his reward

[37:39] gives you a child he's saying I am
[37:42] rewarding your faith you're now I'm

[52:10] 4 father we ask that your blessing upon
[52:13] the word and upon your people and most
[52:18] of all we welcome you here in the house
[52:21] of God may your presence uh settle down
[52:26] upon on your people and may the great
[52:29] Holy Spirit take the word of God and

[52:49] Hearts to be fed by your spirit this we
[52:53] ask in jesus' name amen and amen
[52:56] God bless you thank you very much amen
[53:00] and it reads out of the word of God here
[53:06] 1354 for the Lord has chosen Jacob unto
[53:13] himself and Israel for his peculiar
[53:19] treasure praise the Lord God bless you
[53:23] for the bless the reading of the word
[53:24] please be seated
[53:33] God gave me this particular
[53:37] Topic at this particular
[53:40] time uh because it's right in the season
[53:43] of the word of
[53:45] God and this is Will true Israel ever be
[53:52] exterminated no
[53:57] now we realize that Israel types the
[54:02] church and any attempts
[54:06] naturally of
[54:08] Exterminating Israel speaks spiritually
[54:13] of Satan's attempts to exterminate the
[54:17] True Church of the Living
[54:19] God brother brandham said clearly if you
[54:22] want to know what's happening in the
[54:24] world among the Nations
[54:26] watch
[54:28] Israel
[54:29] naturally spiritually if you want to
[54:32] know what's going on he says watch the
[54:36] women watch the women the way they act
[54:39] the way they dress and the things they
[54:41] do will speak spiritually of what's
[54:45] happening with the Church of the Living
[54:48] God now we know that right now most of
[54:54] the world hates Israel how many knows
[54:57] that oh man how many knows of how many
[55:02] nations that really love
[55:04] Israel no matter of fact it is said that
[55:08] Israel is the fifth most hated nation in
[55:14] the
[55:15] world and especially now Israel is at
[55:19] War we all know that uh they were
[55:23] attacked and they have been responding
[55:26] and it has brought out so much more
[55:29] hatred and vital towards uh the nation
[55:34] of Israel it's all going on right now
[55:40] even uh just uh this morning Iran has
[55:45] vowed to strike at Israel and they said
[55:49] it will be a bone breaking and teeth
[55:52] break teeth breaking attack that will
[55:55] take Place coming from
[55:59] them now we know even from the United
[56:05] Nations uh not saying it out
[56:08] loudly but the call has gone out for the
[56:13] destruction the extermination of
[56:18] Israel now we know exterminate means to
[56:22] erase we know that it means to
[56:26] wipe
[56:28] out it means to
[56:31] eradicate those are just three things
[56:33] you can think about they want to get
[56:37] them
[56:39] completely completely out completely
[56:42] destroyed and off of the
[56:45] scene but this is nothing
[56:48] new for the world has already tried to
[56:52] exterminate Israel for thousands of
[56:56] years
[56:56] years and they have been trying for
[56:59] thousands of years to get rid of these
[57:02] people whoever they think they are they
[57:05] try to get rid of them
[57:09] completely and similarly the church
[57:12] world out there has always been trying
[57:16] to get rid of the true elect seed of God
[57:21] Amen wherever they have caught the true
[57:25] genuine revelation of God for this hour
[57:29] they have tried to wipe them out all the
[57:33] prophets from the beginning of time from
[57:37] Abel right on down we come back into
[57:41] history we see men like hus Luther
[57:46] zwingley uh Hugh Latimer many others
[57:49] that were under the destructive force of
[57:54] Vengeance that come From The Heart Of
[57:58] Satan trying to destroy or to Stamp Out
[58:03] the
[58:04] manifestation living evidences of the
[58:08] Living Word of a living God trying to
[58:11] get it off completely off of the scene
[58:14] but we know the word of our God will
[58:17] stand forever it can never be destroyed
[58:22] it can never be eliminated it cannot
[58:25] happen amen we know that that he has he
[58:29] will tried he has tried he has done with
[58:33] the great
[58:37] inquisitions burning people at the S
[58:40] stake you know of the Pilgrim's Progress
[58:45] you know of John the Revelator boiling
[58:48] him in oil for 24 hours and God
[58:52] protected him in that hot oil for 24
[58:56] hours until they realized that they
[58:59] could not destroy him no matter how much
[59:03] they boil they could not destroy him
[59:06] praise be to God hallelujah let me tell
[59:09] you brother sister even if they throw
[59:12] you into Lion's
[59:14] Den the devil can't destroy you your
[59:19] flesh you are going to be fearful you
[59:21] may you may feel terrible you may feel
[59:24] horrible but if God wants to keep you
[59:27] and preserve you there's none that can
[59:29] destroy you nothing formed against you
[59:33] can
[59:34] prosper because you are the elected seed
[59:37] of God hallu the children of the most
[59:40] high oh praise God forever more yes sir
[59:45] true Israel and the true church can
[59:47] never be
[59:50] exterminated but as I've said before
[59:53] many attempts have been made to
[59:54] exterminate her let's go back and we see
[59:58] first of all in Pharaoh we see it
[1:00:02] displayed it's really the same
[1:00:06] devil it's Satan who was already in
[1:00:11] Cain and a hatred hatred for the True
[1:00:16] Believer in so much that he killed his
[1:00:20] own
[1:00:21] brother and here we see that Spirit
[1:00:24] coming down and coming and using
[1:00:28] Pharaoh as a way to express
[1:00:31] itself and there it tried again to
[1:00:36] destroy the nation of
[1:00:38] Israel this is a type of the world
[1:00:41] trying to destroy God's
[1:00:44] people and made them into slaves you
[1:00:47] know the story you read the book of
[1:00:49] Exodus if you haven't then read the book
[1:00:51] of Exodus and you'll see how they he
[1:00:55] tried to destroy the children of Israel
[1:00:59] but instead of destroying the children
[1:01:00] of Israel what happened he destroyed
[1:01:02] himself he destroyed his Empire he
[1:01:05] destroyed his kingdom just because he
[1:01:08] tried to destroy the people of God
[1:01:10] hallelujah he ended up in the Red Sea
[1:01:13] praise God hallelujah sin has tried to
[1:01:16] destroy you cigarettes have tried to
[1:01:19] destroy you drugs have tried to destroy
[1:01:21] you all all the things of the world have
[1:01:24] tried to destroy you but thank God under
[1:01:27] the Forgiveness of sins by the blood of
[1:01:31] Jesus Christ we can look back now and
[1:01:34] see all of our sins tumbling up in the
[1:01:36] Red Sea of the blood of
[1:01:38] [Music]
[1:01:40] Christ amen they're under the blood amen
[1:01:44] we've been washed and they are under the
[1:01:46] blood amen God has buried them in the
[1:01:50] sea of his
[1:01:51] forgetfulness amen blessed be his name
[1:01:55] praise God
[1:01:56] Hallelujah we see it
[1:01:58] again in the wicked and hateful spiteful
[1:02:03] Queen called aalia in the Bible you'll
[1:02:08] find her in 2 Kings
[1:02:10] 11 you'll find her again in 2 Chronicles
[1:02:15] 22 you'll find her in also in 2
[1:02:19] Chronicles chapter 23 and she actually
[1:02:24] realized
[1:02:26] that one king died she remained as Queen
[1:02:31] but the king's seed his
[1:02:34] son she was trying with all her attempts
[1:02:37] to wipe out the king's seed and the
[1:02:40] devil is still trying to wipe out the
[1:02:42] king's seed wherever they are he's
[1:02:45] trying to wipe out the king's seed but
[1:02:48] you know what in the Bible it says he
[1:02:51] had a a a wet nurse that was taking care
[1:02:54] of him and and when she realized what
[1:02:57] the Queen's intention was she took the
[1:03:00] boy and hid him right amen she hid him
[1:03:05] and so what happened is that she did not
[1:03:09] really realize where he was or if he was
[1:03:13] there anymore of if he was killed with
[1:03:15] the rest because she killed out all the
[1:03:18] rest of the seed that were there so she
[1:03:21] thought he was also killed just like
[1:03:24] when Herod tried to kill all those
[1:03:26] babies thinking he'll get to Jesus you
[1:03:29] know and Moses you know it's right there
[1:03:32] in the types but anyway we see it
[1:03:35] clearly she thought that was over and
[1:03:38] now she started to line up her son that
[1:03:41] he might take the
[1:03:43] throne what she did not know that there
[1:03:46] was a faithful priest by the name of
[1:03:49] jeod and he in the temple praying and
[1:03:53] seeking God we h understand that he
[1:03:56] organized the people through captains
[1:04:00] through men of influence and spread out
[1:04:03] secretly the word that the real king
[1:04:06] after he had come to an age where he
[1:04:09] could rule he started to send out the
[1:04:12] word and gather the people together and
[1:04:15] told them to come to the temple on a
[1:04:17] certain day and there on that day he
[1:04:22] crowned him king and the people began to
[1:04:26] praise God and shout and glorify God and
[1:04:30] the queen in our Palace heard the noise
[1:04:32] and say what is that about and he said
[1:04:35] well something is going on in the temple
[1:04:37] let's go see and she came down and the
[1:04:40] Bible says and she saw the king upon his
[1:04:43] throne the people surrounding him and
[1:04:47] the armed guards around him and she
[1:04:50] screamed to the top of her voice treason
[1:04:53] treason treason reason oh my but though
[1:04:58] the people shouted louder Heil to the
[1:05:02] king amen God saved the king and they
[1:05:06] began to praise God and the priest said
[1:05:09] to the armed guards take a hold of her
[1:05:13] and all that agreed with her yes and
[1:05:18] take off their heads amen but let it not
[1:05:21] be in the temple take them outside and
[1:05:24] get rid of every one of them amen and so
[1:05:26] they did and that was her end and this
[1:05:30] will be the end of all those that come
[1:05:34] against Israel to exterminate her in
[1:05:37] this hour for they are God's precious
[1:05:39] seed in this day and this
[1:05:42] hour will true Israel ever be
[1:05:48] exterminated yes sir we see it clearly
[1:05:52] also in the word of God this displayed
[1:05:56] in the life story of Esther and hymon
[1:06:01] how many knows the story of Esther yes
[1:06:03] sir you know about hmon okay certainly
[1:06:07] we see it how he tried to get to trick
[1:06:10] the king into destroying
[1:06:13] Israel but thank God he had an Esther
[1:06:17] praise the Lord and I'm glad in our day
[1:06:21] God has an Esther God has a people that
[1:06:25] are will to say I believe this
[1:06:28] message I believe this word I recognize
[1:06:32] the revelation of this last prophet's

[1:09:43] shazar and you know how they took uh uh
[1:09:48] Daniel and them and try to place them in
[1:09:52] Fire and place them in Alliance d
[1:09:55] and everything else and then at the last
[1:09:58] there while they were having the feast
[1:10:01] they wanted to make a a joke and mock
[1:10:04] the preacher which is what is going on
[1:10:06] today oh my friends they want to make a
[1:10:09] joke of Christianity and who is a real

[1:10:30] done in this day and in this hour amen
[1:10:34] hallelujah yes sir praise God I want you
[1:10:38] to know my friends that Israel cannot be
[1:10:42] dist
[1:10:45] exterminated the true church cannot be
[1:10:48] exterminated uh forgive me if I get
[1:10:51] excited forgive me if I get loud because
[1:10:54] I know you didn't come here for a
[1:10:56] lecture uh you didn't want uh you know
[1:10:59] let's talk about
[1:11:01] butterflies uh is that okay no that
[1:11:04] should be classic enough for you to
[1:11:07] listen to uh you know this endangered
[1:11:10] species of butterfly what you're talking
[1:11:12] about the butterflies we are the
[1:11:14] endangered species they want to get rid
[1:11:16] of us amen we are the ones endanger you
[1:11:20] think the devil loves you no the devil
[1:11:23] doesn't love you God loves you and I
[1:11:25] love you and that's the way it should be
[1:11:27] amen the devil doesn't like you praise
[1:11:30] God hallelujah yes sir oh praise God but
[1:11:34] they can't destroy the church nor Israel
[1:11:38] because of four basic reasons they may
[1:11:41] be Hest but I'm just going to mention
[1:11:43] four one because of God's promise to
[1:11:47] Abraham and to his fed
[1:11:50] seed amen amen
[1:11:53] secondly because of his his calls he
[1:11:56] calls Israel and the church the apple of
[1:12:00] his eyes amen his wife is the apple of
[1:12:05] his eye praise God he calls Israel among
[1:12:10] all the nations that they are his
[1:12:13] wife and also he calls them his Covenant
[1:12:18] people they're the ones that are keeping
[1:12:20] his Covenant and he holds them true to
[1:12:24] the word amen so as a result both the
[1:12:29] bride and Israel has an eternal quality
[1:12:34] to
[1:12:35] them and you know I say that and touch
[1:12:38] on this briefly you not you know that
[1:12:41] Jehovah's wife was in him in him in his
[1:12:45] mind right and then later on you know
[1:12:49] the process of Redemption how that it
[1:12:51] came down and he displayed how he was
[1:12:54] going to do it in Adam by putting Adam's
[1:12:58] wife in
[1:12:59] him and then when it was the right time
[1:13:03] he put him to sleep and took his wife
[1:13:05] from in him and they were of the same
[1:13:10] material amen same material because one
[1:13:13] came out of the other and so they were
[1:13:16] the same material and therefore he
[1:13:18] displayed in that what he was going to
[1:13:20] do when Jesus went to the Cross Isaiah
[1:13:24] 53 when the the Bible says for Jehovah
[1:13:26] struck him amen Jehovah struck that
[1:13:30] Masterpiece and out of it fell off a a
[1:13:34] piece from off the Masterpiece amen oh
[1:13:37] aren't you glad we are chips off of the
[1:13:39] old block aren't you happy that we are a
[1:13:42] part of God amen amen amen and so out
[1:13:47] from Jesus came his
[1:13:50] wife represented by the chemical flowing
[1:13:53] of the blood out of him brother Bram
[1:13:56] says not that blood not that blood he
[1:13:59] says that that dried up on goat's Hill
[1:14:02] long ago but the life was in the blood
[1:14:06] in the talken book he says don't you
[1:14:09] know that today the church is the blood
[1:14:12] of Christ amen that's it for the spirit
[1:14:15] is in the bride it's in the Church the
[1:14:18] true church amen and she is the blood of
[1:14:22] Christ for this hour amen praise the
[1:14:24] Lord Lord God of hosts amen so we have
[1:14:28] this eternal quality given to us by God
[1:14:31] himself because if he was eternal his
[1:14:34] wife comes from him of the same Pro same
[1:14:36] quality then she's got to be Eternal is
[1:14:39] that right amen same one so if he is the
[1:14:44] word and she came from him she has to be
[1:14:47] what the word it baffles your mind to
[1:14:50] think that you are the word made
[1:14:53] manifest with with all my flaws with all
[1:14:56] my failures with all how how could I you
[1:14:59] don't have to worry about that God says
[1:15:02] you are the word in the beginning was
[1:15:05] the word in God and the Word was made
[1:15:08] flesh first come down in Jesus Christ
[1:15:11] first in MDC and morphe come true and
[1:15:14] morphe until he becomes flesh manifested
[1:15:16] and then crucified dead buried cornner
[1:15:19] weak burst forth and a thousandfold
[1:15:23] multiplied and here we are now the
[1:15:25] evidence of the word of God made
[1:15:28] manifest for this hour praise God
[1:15:31] hallelujah here we are by his grace
[1:15:34] hallelujah amen they can't destroy
[1:15:37] Israel amen yes sir they can't do it I
[1:15:41] tell you it's so marvelous to know that
[1:15:44] we are
[1:15:46] indestructible here in this time and in
[1:15:48] this hour Hallelujah but you see there
[1:15:53] these attempts to destroy them came
[1:15:55] because first of all they broke their
[1:15:58] Covenant with God Amen you you take the
[1:16:02] Commandments and you see they break the
[1:16:04] Covenant with God they bow down to Idols
[1:16:06] they lie cheat do every possible thing
[1:16:09] they break their Covenant with God Amen
[1:16:13] they disobeyed God's prophets when they
[1:16:15] came with a message they didn't want to
[1:16:18] listen to them they disobeyed God's
[1:16:22] prophets and they because of that they
[1:16:26] descended into what
[1:16:28] idolatry Thou shalt not worship other
[1:16:31] gods beside me I'm the only one amen
[1:16:35] none before me none behind me none
[1:16:37] beside me nobody else I am the one
[1:16:41] Elohim the self-existent one the Mighty
[1:16:46] God made manifest in Jesus Christ amen
[1:16:50] hallelujah yes sir oh praise God and so
[1:16:54] because of this idolatry and because of
[1:16:58] the
[1:17:00] harlotry of
[1:17:02] Israel and type we see it in the prophet
[1:17:07] Hosea read that book and his wife the
[1:17:11] prophet had his wife and she turned out
[1:17:14] to live the life of a
[1:17:17] harlot but it was God showing that even
[1:17:20] though she did that Hosea still loved
[1:17:23] her and God showing no matter what
[1:17:26] Israel does no matter what the church
[1:17:28] does no matter what the bride does God
[1:17:31] in God's eyes you're
[1:17:34] [Applause]
[1:17:35] Justified doesn't matter who on this
[1:17:38] Earth loves you they will pass away but
[1:17:41] the Eternal God loves you from eternity
[1:17:45] back to Eternity amen thank you Lord
[1:17:49] when he was Alpha you were in him and
[1:17:51] now he is Omega we're going back to our
[1:17:54] position in him him we'll find our place
[1:17:57] in him for all God's gifts all God's
[1:18:01] elect will find their appropriate places
[1:18:04] they'll find where they are and they'll
[1:18:07] sit down in his house and with him there
[1:18:11] forever and ever praise God and so God
[1:18:14] scattered Israel do you know that yes
[1:18:18] and you know that in I think it's May
[1:18:21] 177th
[1:18:23] 1948 they were brought back to their
[1:18:26] Homeland God brought them back right to
[1:18:29] their Homeland amen and there they are
[1:18:33] back but now what is happening these
[1:18:36] young Lions of
[1:18:38] God
[1:18:40] Amen National Force brother brand
[1:18:44] brother I'm not quoting the quote but he
[1:18:46] said this National Force God used
[1:18:50] National Force to bring them back or
[1:18:53] push them back into their Homeland amen
[1:18:56] and now what is happening they are
[1:18:58] trying to use National Force to claim
[1:19:02] all the rest of
[1:19:04] it but that's not God's plan you should
[1:19:08] be asking Jehovah to restore back to you
[1:19:12] what he promised to the prophet
[1:19:15] Abraham and let him do the
[1:19:18] restoration let him do all of that for
[1:19:22] you praise God but instead
[1:19:25] right now they're rushing ahead of God
[1:19:28] using National Force to try to bring
[1:19:32] about they know it's in the word but
[1:19:34] they're trying to use National Force to
[1:19:37] bring about uh the Fulfillment of
[1:19:40] Prophecy but the unrighteousness of man
[1:19:43] doesn't work the righteousness of God it
[1:19:46] doesn't work that way amen so they're
[1:19:48] now trying to expand their Homeland are
[1:19:50] you following me here am I hope I'm not
[1:19:53] going too far you see I'm try trying to
[1:19:54] get as much in as I can take your
[1:19:58] time amen yeah I can take my time but
[1:20:02] then we'll be here until about
[1:20:06] 4:00 is that right amen and uh never
[1:20:11] mind the young ones they're supposed to
[1:20:13] be hungry but a lot of older ones are
[1:20:15] going to be hungry
[1:20:16] too and we going to be starting to hear
[1:20:19] all kinds of
[1:20:20] voices and it won't be coming from your
[1:20:23] mouth either
[1:20:26] oh my amen
[1:20:29] hallelujah but you see they're trying to
[1:20:31] use National
[1:20:33] Force to
[1:20:35] expand their
[1:20:38] territory and to F and in so doing they
[1:20:40] think they'll be fulfilling the will of
[1:20:43] God
[1:20:45] now I understand and I'm just going to
[1:20:48] say it this way because you know in
[1:20:50] these modern times you have to be
[1:20:52] careful of what you say and how you say
[1:20:54] it yes uh you know but when God wants to
[1:20:57] accomplish something it's being always
[1:21:01] that way just before Jesus come on the
[1:21:04] scene all other false Messiahs were
[1:21:06] coming yeah you had Judas macabus you
[1:21:09] had tadas you had different ones I won't
[1:21:11] name them but a lot of them were coming
[1:21:13] thinking they're the one they're the one
[1:21:15] they're the one but they were not the
[1:21:17] one until Jesus came on the scene amen
[1:21:20] and so when you see the time for Israel
[1:21:25] to come into her glory is coming the
[1:21:29] anointing the presence of God to fulfill
[1:21:32] his word starting to come down on the
[1:21:35] world the devil acting up on one side
[1:21:38] the great contest is on the great Holy
[1:21:41] Spirit versus Satan then what uh begins
[1:21:45] to happen Men start stepping up thinking
[1:21:48] they're the ones to deliver Israel I'm
[1:21:50] the one and so but you see God turns
[1:21:53] around and uses
[1:21:55] maybe a
[1:21:56] man like
[1:21:59] David he uses men that are like
[1:22:04] Warriors they don't think about anything
[1:22:07] else but they are warriors they're made
[1:22:09] for war and they're made with bloody
[1:22:13] hands they kill they destroy they do
[1:22:16] everything because that anointing that
[1:22:18] was on David rest on them to kill
[1:22:22] destroy expand grow the Kingdom amen but
[1:22:26] all that was just so that God would use
[1:22:30] that David to clear the way so that then
[1:22:35] after him will come in a man with the
[1:22:38] spirit of
[1:22:40] Solomon that can bring a semblance of
[1:22:44] peace I say semblance of Peace because
[1:22:47] you know there will be no peace until
[1:22:50] the Prince of Peace
[1:22:52] comes until Jesus comes puts his foot on
[1:22:55] Mount Zion amen and and and declares
[1:22:59] himself who he really is because you
[1:23:03] know that uh they have to believe the
[1:23:06] same seven seal that we receive amen
[1:23:09] they have to receive it but they'll
[1:23:12] receive the the the sins will be
[1:23:14] preached to them by Moses and Elijah and
[1:23:17] the Seven seal himself will come down on
[1:23:19] Mount Zion and then they say where did
[1:23:21] you get those wounds he says in the
[1:23:23] house of my friends
[1:23:25] right uh you know just like Joseph was a
[1:23:27] type of him his own Brothers put him in
[1:23:29] the pit and so his own Brothers put him
[1:23:32] on a cross and kill him and everything
[1:23:34] else in the house of my friends the
[1:23:37] Bible says they're going to weep they're
[1:23:39] going to weep for days and days and days
[1:23:42] amen because now is the time they're
[1:23:45] entering into the Feast of their
[1:23:47] atonement yes amen and there could be no
[1:23:50] real atonement without Christ right
[1:23:53] they're keeping the he's now in tight
[1:23:55] with bulls and Rams and doves and goats
[1:23:59] but when the real one comes on the scene
[1:24:03] amen then the Bible says they'll
[1:24:05] recognize it then but for now their eyes
[1:24:09] are
[1:24:10] blinded they can't see yes what is their
[1:24:14] own but at that hour their eyes will be
[1:24:18] open and they will recognize what it was
[1:24:22] amen and so we find out that they're
[1:24:25] trying to use human National Force to
[1:24:28] bring themselves back to their former
[1:24:31] glory because you know that Israel once
[1:24:35] under Solomon they ruled all Lebanon
[1:24:39] parts of Syria all the way up there they
[1:24:43] were ruling all those places that were
[1:24:45] around Jordan and all those countries
[1:24:47] round about was under the power of of of
[1:24:51] Solomon amen and David amen yes
[1:24:55] and they're thinking of their former
[1:24:57] glory and they're trying to use National
[1:25:00] Force to reclaim it my friends but you
[1:25:04] see that's not the way it will be only
[1:25:07] the power of Jehovah will bring them
[1:25:09] back to their former glory I was in
[1:25:13] Israel and I was told by some who were
[1:25:17] on the battlefield they don't know what
[1:25:20] it was but in the Yum kipur war that
[1:25:23] they Egyptians were coming down with all
[1:25:26] their tanks you know that is were like
[1:25:29] 150 millions of Arabs against the Jews
[1:25:34] that were what like two or three million
[1:25:36] at that time oh my goodness and they
[1:25:39] were sure they were going to win but
[1:25:42] when they were coming down across the
[1:25:44] desert they heard the sounds of a mighty
[1:25:47] Army bigger than
[1:25:49] theirs they did not wait to see the army
[1:25:53] they jumped out of their tanks because
[1:25:56] the tanks weren't moving fast enough
[1:25:58] they deserted they left right and Center
[1:26:00] they were in
[1:26:02] confusion and they ran away when the
[1:26:04] Israelites come they wonder what why
[1:26:06] they running what's happening then later
[1:26:08] they realize the rabbis begin to tell
[1:26:10] them no that was Jehovah fighting for
[1:26:13] his people let me tell you the battle is
[1:26:16] not yours the battle belong unto the
[1:26:20] Lord
[1:26:21] hallelujah no matter what you are going
[1:26:23] through now and you don't think I'll
[1:26:27] never be able to come out of this I'll
[1:26:29] never be able to win this battle this
[1:26:31] argument this situation that's not for
[1:26:34] you to worry about place your cares in
[1:26:37] the hands of Jehovah place your cares in
[1:26:40] the hands of Jesus for you know that
[1:26:43] Jesus is Jehovah of the Old Testament is
[1:26:46] the same Jesus after you one is the
[1:26:49] spirit the the spirit the other one is
[1:26:52] the spirit Now put on flesh for God was
[1:26:56] made flesh in Jesus Christ amen
[1:26:58] hallelujah made visible Amen in the Lord

[1:29:04] his oh praise God hallelujah hallu let
[1:29:09] me share um uh some things here with you
[1:29:13] brother brandham speaking in the seventh
[1:29:16] seal he says them learn a parable of
[1:29:22] Victory when you see the Jew je they'll
[1:29:25] be hated of all Nations for my name and
[1:29:30] so forth also again he said paragraph
[1:29:36] 186 what they won't be done away with
[1:29:41] they try to kill the Jews off the Earth
[1:29:45] they'll never be able to do it amen amen
[1:29:48] that's a prophet speaking they'll never
[1:29:51] be able to do it praise God God and that
[1:29:55] comes from the seventh seal paragraph
[1:29:58] 186 hallelujah oh praise God what an
[1:30:03] hour now we know brother sister right
[1:30:06] now why why does the world actually hate
[1:30:11] Israel is because they can look and see
[1:30:14] their
[1:30:16] wrongdoings they can see their
[1:30:18] wrongdoings in the Bible says bam looked
[1:30:22] and he could see their sin so plain that
[1:30:26] he felt that now their sins are showing
[1:30:29] now I can curse them now I can curse
[1:30:32] them because the whole world is seeing
[1:30:35] their sins is seeing their
[1:30:38] wrongdoings obvious wrong doing so now I
[1:30:40] can curse them like that and he wanted
[1:30:44] to curse them brother the quote is the
[1:30:47] Israel and the church book five
[1:30:51] 1953 amen but brother Brenham said yes
[1:30:56] they were sinning just like everybody
[1:30:59] else were sinning they were doing every
[1:31:03] vile act like everybody else was doing
[1:31:06] amen he says but what bam as a prophet
[1:31:10] didn't
[1:31:11] recognize is that though they were doing
[1:31:14] the same things though they were making
[1:31:17] the same kind of wrongdoings yet at the
[1:31:20] same time they had a pillar of fire they
[1:31:23] had a pro Prophet they had a covenant
[1:31:26] amen they had an ark of the covenant
[1:31:28] they had a smitten Rock in the
[1:31:29] wilderness they had a prophet amongst
[1:31:32] them oh praise God hallelujah brother
[1:31:35] sister I want you to know so as to the
[1:31:38] church amen doesn't mean you are free to
[1:31:41] go out and do what you want that's right
[1:31:43] but for you to have Blessed
[1:31:45] Assurance to know that you are Anchored
[1:31:48] In Christ Hallelujah no matter what
[1:31:51] mistakes you made Hallelujah you have a
[1:31:55] prophet you have a pillar of fire you
[1:31:57] have a covenant you have the blood of
[1:31:59] Christ you have the Holy Spirit you have
[1:32:02] his word hallelujah rest upon the word
[1:32:05] of God rest upon the promise as Israel
[1:32:09] cannot be destroyed so can the elect the
[1:32:13] elect can never be
[1:32:16] destroyed why you're
[1:32:19] Justified you're Justified Satan lights
[1:32:22] the fire god es you to light the fire
[1:32:25] then call call the fire engent and say
[1:32:27] look him he's the one that light the
[1:32:29] fire yeah but you're the one that
[1:32:30] tempted me to light the
[1:32:32] fire it's not really me I didn't want to
[1:32:35] do it but the Temptation made me light
[1:32:37] the fire see so that's why Paul and all
[1:32:40] these Apostles explained to us we are we
[1:32:42] we are the supernatural Sons and
[1:32:44] Daughters of God dwelling in these
[1:32:47] bodies of
[1:32:48] Flesh amen that came into existence by
[1:32:53] Satan yes by
[1:32:55] procreation not by Spoken Word creation
[1:33:00] and therefore as such we find out we do
[1:33:03] a lot of things while we're in this body
[1:33:05] brother Bram said do you know that
[1:33:07] sticky nature will be with you right
[1:33:09] till you go into the Rapture right so
[1:33:11] don't you say oh I'm going I'm perfect
[1:33:14] I'm going to be perfect you're trying to
[1:33:16] get your outward actions
[1:33:19] perfect and and that's just for other
[1:33:21] people not God God knows you
[1:33:24] he knows you that part inside you can't
[1:33:26] hide that but this outer man you trying
[1:33:29] to get that perfect for other people to
[1:33:31] see you but the real believer knows in
[1:33:34] fact Perfection dwells
[1:33:37] within it's in the seed that's already
[1:33:40] in you oh I got to get more love there's
[1:33:43] love in the seed there's perfection in
[1:33:44] the seed there is brotherly kindness in
[1:33:46] the seed there's every virtue that you
[1:33:49] see in the seed
[1:33:52] already Hallelujah you may not be
[1:33:54] manifesting it that's why Paul said work
[1:33:57] out your salvation with fear and
[1:34:00] trembling work it out so other people
[1:34:03] can see it on the outside of you it's in
[1:34:05] you but let it come out so that people
[1:34:07] can see you that it's in there praise
[1:34:10] God so Perfection dwells within praise
[1:34:13] the Lord hallelujah oh my what a day
[1:34:18] that we are living in right now praise
[1:34:21] God hallelujah let me uh fish around
[1:34:25] here I'm fishing for something here this
[1:34:27] is not a third P but I'm fishing for
[1:34:30] some quotations I need to get here
[1:34:33] praise the name of the Lord uh trying to
[1:34:36] find what I have here praise the
[1:34:39] Lord now we know I just mentioned balum
[1:34:43] and I just mentioned how much he tried
[1:34:45] to curse Israel and God says you can't
[1:34:48] curse Israel I already blessed them so
[1:34:51] how you going to curse what God has
[1:34:52] blessed
[1:34:54] God has blessed Israel Hallelujah and
[1:34:57] I'm telling you brother sister i' been
[1:34:59] there close to seven or eight
[1:35:02] times you you can't curse them you may
[1:35:06] say it with your mouth but the curse no
[1:35:08] curse can go on them right and God
[1:35:11] doesn't change his mind about his word
[1:35:14] so oh my God they're so bad now I'm
[1:35:16] going to take back my God doesn't change
[1:35:19] his mind about this word he already got
[1:35:22] them under Covenant on the promise he
[1:35:24] got them under as Legal Wife he's got
[1:35:28] them in every position and it's
[1:35:30] impossible for anyone to exterminate the
[1:35:34] nation of
[1:35:35] Israel amen no
[1:35:39] Organization no
[1:35:41] group none
[1:35:43] whatsoever Hallelujah but you
[1:35:47] see lot of this is cause if you bear
[1:35:50] with
[1:35:52] me say Satan has infiltrated
[1:35:56] Israel the nation of Israel as much as
[1:36:00] he has infiltrated the true church and I
[1:36:04] mean infiltrated amongst those who claim
[1:36:08] to believe the message yes the devil has
[1:36:12] infiltrated among those who even claim
[1:36:15] they have
[1:36:16] Revelation and he's in the midst and so
[1:36:20] we find out right in Israel right as in
[1:36:24] the church we have the True Vine and the
[1:36:27] false Vine is all right twins as a
[1:36:31] brother said and we preached some years
[1:36:33] ago twins in the beginning twins again
[1:36:36] in the end right so they're in the same
[1:36:39] church they're in the same Nation but
[1:36:42] one is true and one is false there's a
[1:36:45] True Vine and there's a false Vine amen
[1:36:48] hallelujah but you see that false Vine
[1:36:52] group don't don't think when you say
[1:36:54] false vine when you say these things
[1:36:57] that you're talking about some devil out
[1:36:59] on the
[1:37:00] street do you know that Satan was more
[1:37:03] religious than some of us in
[1:37:07] here he had a voice like an
[1:37:10] angel oh man he knows music like a
[1:37:15] master yes H he was was just so
[1:37:20] brilliant that he thought my God I got
[1:37:23] got these people worshiping like this
[1:37:25] maybe you know maybe I can supplant God
[1:37:29] and so we find out that this uh spirit
[1:37:33] of the false Vine is
[1:37:35] religious it's very very
[1:37:39] religious right and it's right here in
[1:37:43] the church and it's in Israel
[1:37:46] also as the false
[1:37:49] Vine but thank God they go out
[1:37:54] and they live a wrong life say wrong
[1:37:58] things and in Israel they'll do wrong
[1:38:02] things and what's the purpose to create
[1:38:06] a false
[1:38:08] impression of what that people will
[1:38:11] think that's what the true vine is
[1:38:13] that's what the Pharisees did they tried
[1:38:15] to let people think God was a harsh god
[1:38:18] with no love and God was like that you
[1:38:22] see but uh that was a false impression
[1:38:24] and God had to send Jesus the word to
[1:38:27] let the people see his person and
[1:38:29] personality made manifest so they can
[1:38:32] know that God is a god of love and grace
[1:38:35] and God rich in
[1:38:37] Mercy and they could recognize him of
[1:38:40] who he is praise the name of the Lord
[1:38:43] and so they create false
[1:38:45] Impressions and uh I've seen people in
[1:38:49] the church creating false
[1:38:51] Impressions you'll think that they're
[1:38:53] real believer and as soon as the hot
[1:38:57] sunlight comes and shines upon
[1:38:59] them or the gospel is preached in such a
[1:39:03] hot cutting way all of a sudden they get
[1:39:07] bitter I thought the hot sun was
[1:39:09] supposed to
[1:39:11] sweeten but all of a sudden when it
[1:39:14] shines on you you get bitter you get
[1:39:16] angry you like Cain instead of he gets
[1:39:19] an offer if you would do like your
[1:39:21] brother would I not accept you he don't
[1:39:24] care about that he he wants to almost
[1:39:27] Force God to accept his worship of
[1:39:30] flowers and fruits and and human efforts
[1:39:33] and everything else he his n you see it
[1:39:36] was from in his nature yes his nature
[1:39:40] was causing him to act that way against
[1:39:42] God and against God's word amen but
[1:39:47] that's the way they are praise God but
[1:39:50] as the word says in the Book of
[1:39:52] Revelation as the prophet says not all
[1:39:55] Israel is real
[1:39:58] Israel and not all Jews yes are the real
[1:40:03] Israel amen he even said another place
[1:40:07] they may be come from Juda and he goes
[1:40:10] back to explain where that name Jews
[1:40:12] come from how when Nebuchadnezzar took
[1:40:15] them into Babylon because most of the
[1:40:18] Jews that he brought out at that time
[1:40:20] were from the hills of Judea he called
[1:40:23] them
[1:40:24] Jews and then that name stuck to all of
[1:40:29] them that they were
[1:40:31] Jews so when they go back to the land
[1:40:35] then they're all called Jews in Israel
[1:40:38] say I'm I'm I'm a Israeli I'm of Israel
[1:40:42] but the prophet said no it's not like
[1:40:45] that right it's not like that you see
[1:40:48] the difference anyway praise the Lord so
[1:40:51] uh we find the that uh that they're
[1:40:55] not uh true Israel is amongst the Jews
[1:41:01] in Israel but not the whole thing that
[1:41:05] we call Israel is really Israel and God
[1:41:09] knows that and the prophet has said it
[1:41:12] and the quotes are here that can show it
[1:41:14] which I will not quote them all actually
[1:41:17] the brother has them if any of you would
[1:41:19] like to have a copy of that you can have
[1:41:22] it where brother brand makes this all
[1:41:24] clear I'm just hitting some high points
[1:41:26] not to keep us
[1:41:28] here all
[1:41:30] afternoon I don't want anybody to pass
[1:41:33] out I don't want have to raise the dead
[1:41:36] like
[1:41:38] Paul I just want our the devil will
[1:41:41] distract you by causing somebody to do
[1:41:44] something and then everybody's attention
[1:41:45] gone over there and then the word can't
[1:41:48] go out so let's keep our thoughts on the
[1:41:51] word okay
[1:41:54] so many of them today are saying they're
[1:41:56] Jews but they're Jews only because a
[1:42:00] rabbi look into their background and
[1:42:04] give them human evidence yes we now
[1:42:07] approve of you that you are a Jew and
[1:42:10] they put their name in the book of the
[1:42:13] synagogue or the roles of the synagogue
[1:42:16] same in the true CH in the church church
[1:42:19] world you pass through our uh catechisms
[1:42:23] you pass through our converts class you
[1:42:26] go through our rigorous training of how
[1:42:28] to be a Christian which in you know a
[1:42:31] real Christian doesn't have to have
[1:42:32] training to be a Christian because the
[1:42:34] seed is in already in him and it will
[1:42:37] teach him how to be a real Christian is
[1:42:40] of course he'll be under a pastor Pastor
[1:42:43] will be outward guidance for him and the
[1:42:46] real Pastor is above that Pastor and he
[1:42:48] is shining down the light of the word
[1:42:50] for the age and for the time and for the
[1:42:52] Seas
[1:42:53] praise the Lord so they'll give them a
[1:42:56] scholarly uh reason why they are a Jew
[1:43:00] and put their name on a book amen but
[1:43:02] you see in
[1:43:03] reality God identifies his own whether
[1:43:08] there be jew or Gentile God identifies
[1:43:10] his own and their names of the Tre elect
[1:43:14] are already in Jehovah's book of
[1:43:17] redemption from before the foundations
[1:43:20] of the world hallelujah hallelujah the
[1:43:23] names are on that book before the
[1:43:25] foundations of the world and no man can
[1:43:27] take it off amen God Alone can do that
[1:43:31] amen hallelujah so Israel types of
[1:43:34] church repeating
[1:43:36] myself uh not everybody that says they a
[1:43:39] Jew is a real Jew not everyone that say
[1:43:43] they're a real Christian is a real
[1:43:45] Christian not everyone that say I'm a
[1:43:49] message believer um that doesn't make
[1:43:51] you a message believer
[1:43:53] if you haven't got a revelation of the
[1:43:55] message you believe some mess but not
[1:43:58] the message you see so you've got to
[1:44:00] look and see what God is doing in your
[1:44:03] life hallelujah amen Revelation says
[1:44:06] they say they are Jews but they are not
[1:44:11] and they are they are liars in other
[1:44:14] words he might as well repeat what Jesus

[1:44:19] the devil and Jesus called the Pharisees

[1:48:02] amen praise God forever more hallelujah
[1:48:06] amen thank God that the true elected is
[1:48:10] brought out just like Israel was brought
[1:48:13] out a nation from within a nation
[1:48:17] yes then out of that nation that he
[1:48:20] already brought out he brought out
[1:48:23] two elect out of that so is it a lot of
[1:48:28] people thought oh we came out and we
[1:48:30] follow the message for 40 years 30 years
[1:48:32] 20 years H H I'm an elect no out of that
[1:48:37] God still pulls out his Chosen Few his
[1:48:42] elected few are pulled out of that by

[1:49:04] message Hallelujah and we stand here
[1:49:07] with our robes clean and white amen

[1:49:21] thank God that we are are the apple of
[1:49:24] his eye and we can give him praise and
[1:49:27] all and Glory Hallelujah so all
[1:49:30] Christians that go to church are not
[1:49:33] Christians I'm quoting here from Israel
[1:49:37] and the church he says here Jew not all
[1:49:42] Jews will be saved they will not be
[1:49:47] saved see they will not be I believe
[1:49:52] that you see here because of the tribe
[1:49:55] of Judah was taken by Nebuchadnezzar he
[1:49:58] called them Jews first and they were
[1:50:01] given that name of Jew and now they're
[1:50:04] called Jew see that's how it was so but
[1:50:09] but Israel is
[1:50:11] different and uh and Jew is all together
[1:50:15] different see there now he is just a Jew
[1:50:21] Paul never said said all Jews will be
[1:50:24] saved he said all Israel will be saved
[1:50:28] amen what Israel's a name that's the
[1:50:32] Redemptive name of the people see all
[1:50:36] Israel will be saved not all
[1:50:40] Judaism will be saved let me just quote
[1:50:44] that last part not all Judaism will be
[1:50:50] saved because not all Jews are the true
[1:50:56] elected Israel of
[1:50:59] God okay praise God that's in God's
[1:51:03] chosen place of worship
[1:51:05] 1965 see not all Israel is Israel not
[1:51:09] all Christians are Christians because
[1:51:11] that's the two Vines again the true and
[1:51:13] the false they're motivated by two
[1:51:16] different kinds of spirit one has the
[1:51:18] Holy Spirit and one is Anointed with the
[1:51:22] spirit of antichrist both claim to know
[1:51:26] and to be known of God both claiming to
[1:51:30] speak for God both believe certain basic
[1:51:33] truths but then they begin to differ on
[1:51:36] others since both bear the name the Lord
[1:51:39] being called Christians by the name
[1:51:42] bearing they claim a relationship to him
[1:51:46] amen see they claim that relationship
[1:51:50] God calls that relationship marriage
[1:51:53] and so because they make that claim god
[1:51:56] holds them both responsible to him amen
[1:52:00] and remember you cannot curse what go
[1:52:04] bless you can't bless what God has
[1:52:07] already
[1:52:08] cursed neither can the devil curse what
[1:52:11] God has blessed I want you to say after
[1:52:14] me I am blessed I am blessed say it
[1:52:17] again I am blessed I am blessed say it
[1:52:19] again one more time I am blessed I am
[1:52:22] blessed I am
[1:52:24] blessed I am
[1:52:26] blessed every day when I wake up I am
[1:52:30] blessed when I wake up in the morning in
[1:52:34] the morning when I lay my head to rest I
[1:52:38] am blessed bless bless amess praise God
[1:52:44] hallelujah
[1:52:46] remember this is all an individual
[1:52:50] Affair Hallelujah
[1:52:53] praise God you don't hide behind your
[1:52:56] old Mo your Old Faithful mother's skirt
[1:52:58] and think you're going to go into heaven
[1:53:00] that way no sir we one by one we gain
[1:53:05] the portals there to dwell with the
[1:53:10] Immortals when they ring those golden
[1:53:14] bells for you and we one by one we each
[1:53:20] one must know that the revelation of God
[1:53:24] has struck your soul and you can see
[1:53:26] clearly now because the rain is gone is
[1:53:30] that right oh praise God hallelujah yes
[1:53:35] sir oh my think of it now it's an
[1:53:38] individual Affair and I don't care no
[1:53:41] matter how poor you may
[1:53:44] be amen I don't care no matter how
[1:53:50] stupid no matter how how unlearned you
[1:53:54] may be how
[1:53:57] uneducated what God has blessed is
[1:54:00] blessed by God hallelujah praise God
[1:54:03] let's give the Lord
[1:54:07] Praise let's praise our
[1:54:12] god brother Simon I I don't know all
[1:54:15] those quotations like you do what does
[1:54:17] it have to do with it he says whether
[1:54:19] you're uneducated whether you can't read
[1:54:21] and write like pet uh the so-called
[1:54:24] first pope couldn't read and write
[1:54:27] couldn't even spell his name uh that
[1:54:29] doesn't matter it's the
[1:54:32] individual salvation knowing that the
[1:54:35] seed of God dwells in
[1:54:37] you and the seed of God first John do
[1:54:41] not commit sin this outside man does all
[1:54:44] kinds of thing and now we repent of that
[1:54:47] but this man here Satan can't
[1:54:49] touch that's why when you come in a
[1:54:52] presence of God you are
[1:54:54] Justified you're just as if you never
[1:54:56] sinned in the first place why because
[1:54:59] the man in sight never did anything he
[1:55:01] never did anything is is this man
[1:55:03] outside of Satan put you inside this
[1:55:06] prison and have you in it and cause it
[1:55:08] to act up and do all kinds of things
[1:55:10] then you have to come back the man
[1:55:11] inside have to come back and say oh Lord
[1:55:13] God I'm
[1:55:14] sorry I Repent thank God I'm so glad you
[1:55:18] know one thing if you if you commit a
[1:55:21] crime
[1:55:23] and they bring you up uh before the
[1:55:26] judge and the judge says you're guilty
[1:55:29] you're
[1:55:30] guilty and I'm going to send you to
[1:55:31] prison but if inide the man inside never
[1:55:36] done anything how you going to call him
[1:55:38] guilty how how can he be condemned he
[1:55:41] can't be condemned this man here is
[1:55:43] going to go back to the dust from whence
[1:55:45] it came and because of its association
[1:55:48] with the man inside God will give you a
[1:55:51] new body amen amen praise the Lord
[1:55:54] hallelujah oh my yes sir God speaking
[1:55:58] Deuteronomy
[1:56:00] 32:10 I found him Jacob in the desert
[1:56:04] lands in the west howling Wilderness he
[1:56:09] he led him by about he instructed him
[1:56:13] and he kept him as the apple of his eyes
[1:56:18] thus said the Lord of hosts after the
[1:56:21] glory had he said sent me into the
[1:56:23] Nations which spoiled you for he for he
[1:56:27] that touched you touched the apple of
[1:56:29] his eyes he says I sent him among the
[1:56:33] Nations which spoiled you that don't
[1:56:36] mean like a mother spoil a child but it
[1:56:38] means they robbed they destroyed they
[1:56:42] tried to break them bust them do
[1:56:44] everything else and God is saying but
[1:56:47] who toucheth you amen is touching the
[1:56:51] apple of my eyes amen praise God and
[1:56:55] they're not supposed to do that by the
[1:56:57] grace of almighty God hallelujah amen I
[1:57:02] want to go back to Bam here I'm jumping
[1:57:05] all around but God bless you today for
[1:57:07] your patience with me praise the Lord
[1:57:10] balam thought that a holy God would
[1:57:13] surely curse the people who had done
[1:57:16] such wrong surely God will do it you see
[1:57:20] he was money crazy
[1:57:22] we're living in a world like that isn't
[1:57:24] that
[1:57:25] right we living in that world you see
[1:57:27] the preachers everywhere money crazy
[1:57:31] filthy looker is that right there it is
[1:57:34] in the word of God we know we have our
[1:57:37] duty according to the word of God paying
[1:57:38] her tithe giving her offering that's
[1:57:40] that's different but we're talking
[1:57:42] preachers actually gone money crazy out
[1:57:45] there in those churches out there you
[1:57:48] see and every he tried to curse them he
[1:57:51] threw out a proph prophecy take up his
[1:57:54] mantle his Parable and instead of
[1:57:56] cursing he would find that he was
[1:57:58] blessing them in other words what was
[1:58:00] happening to him you know a prophet is a
[1:58:02] man that is under God's control and the
[1:58:05] Holy Spirit controls him so he would
[1:58:08] open his mouth to go curse Israel and
[1:58:11] the next thing you know out of his own
[1:58:13] mouth he's hearing himself blessed
[1:58:15] them you know and and that's what the
[1:58:18] scripture is trying to tell us you see
[1:58:21] balum fail to see what the modern
[1:58:24] preachers and modern people are failing
[1:58:26] to see in the Holy Ghost Church today
[1:58:30] amen I know they say I know a lot of
[1:58:33] them call themselves this that and the
[1:58:35] other things and I know what they've
[1:58:37] done I know what he done and what she
[1:58:39] done the prophet says I'll admit that
[1:58:42] brother amen they'll blow up with this
[1:58:45] they done that they' done this that's
[1:58:47] true they might even done it I admit
[1:58:51] what have done is wrong but where balam
[1:58:55] failed to see that there was a Brazen
[1:58:58] serpent a substitute for them he failed
[1:59:02] to see there was a smitten Rock going
[1:59:05] before them Hallelujah he saw those
[1:59:09] things going there making atonement for
[1:59:12] them God was calling it was God's
[1:59:15] election and they were God's people God
[1:59:19] had called them and separated them and
[1:59:21] put that serpent as an atonement and the
[1:59:24] smitten Rock and Baum failed to see that
[1:59:28] in the this day the modern preacher
[1:59:31] fails to see the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:59:35] the smitten Jesus Christ that we have
[1:59:38] now in this body amen one Spirit we're
[1:59:42] all baptized into one body members of
[1:59:46] one body that's what the Modern Man fail
[1:59:49] to see Hallelujah of the Holy ghost
[1:59:52] moving before us praise the name of the
[1:59:55] Lord hallelujah thank God God has chosen
[1:59:59] Jacob as a peculiar treasure to
[2:00:03] himself God has chosen you and I as
[2:00:06] peculiar Treasures unto himself one more
[2:00:11] uh one more quote to you and then I'm
[2:00:13] going to wind this all down here you'll
[2:00:16] find recognizing your D message he says
[2:00:19] National Force put them back in their
[2:00:21] Homeland
[2:00:23] and for National Force will put the
[2:00:26] nominal church back in the church in the
[2:00:30] world into that world counil of churches
[2:00:32] by using National Force but the power of
[2:00:35] God is going to put the bride into our
[2:00:37] Rapture praise the Lord hallelujah amen
[2:00:41] that's recognizing your day and its
[2:00:43] message and then W I want to leave this
[2:00:48] with you praise the Lord now in the Book
[2:00:51] of Revelation
[2:00:52] we find
[2:00:54] out that the Jews are gathering they've
[2:00:58] gathered back into Jerusalem but they
[2:01:01] don't even know their
[2:01:04] tribes and the reason why like I told
[2:01:06] you before Jews and
[2:01:09] Israelites right the true Israel and
[2:01:12] everybody calling themselves I'm a Jew
[2:01:15] uh you know you'll find among the quotes
[2:01:17] there brother Braham says no I'm not
[2:01:19] talking about those those those Wall
[2:01:22] Street greedy whatnot and he describes
[2:01:25] them Jews I'm not talking about those
[2:01:27] there are some real ones amongst them
[2:01:31] and those are elected ones elected by
[2:01:34] his hands he says and they've come back
[2:01:37] but now that they're back they've lost
[2:01:40] their tribal
[2:01:43] banners then they have lost their books
[2:01:48] and their books have been destroyed So
[2:01:51] when you say what what tribe are you
[2:01:52] from I don't know and that's where these
[2:01:56] rabbis come in and say well uh from our
[2:01:59] research from your features from how you
[2:02:01] look you are of the tribe of so and so
[2:02:03] and the rabbi tells them that and they
[2:02:04] accept it but brother B said really they
[2:02:08] don't know their tribes they don't
[2:02:09] really know where they're from I don't
[2:02:11] know one from Benjamin one from here the
[2:02:15] books have been destroyed through so
[2:02:17] many wars
[2:02:19] 2500 years only one thing they know they
[2:02:23] are Jews so they know they're back in
[2:02:25] their Homeland amen but they don't know
[2:02:29] their tribe but God knows Jehovah knows
[2:02:35] Hallelujah though they have lost their
[2:02:37] tribal banners and this or that who
[2:02:41] which is one and whether this is that or
[2:02:43] not amen they don't know whether they're
[2:02:46] from Benjamin or from Reuben or isachar
[2:02:50] or where they're from but but God called
[2:02:52] them there Revelation 7 12 God will
[2:02:57] choose 12,000 of each tribe of the
[2:03:02] elected out of all of it there is
[2:03:05] 12,000 of each tribe amen that's elected
[2:03:11] and that's where he will set them back
[2:03:14] right into order in other words this is
[2:03:17] there the proof showing that those
[2:03:20] 12,000
[2:03:23] 144,000 Jews will be called
[2:03:26] out of uh out of through Israel will be
[2:03:31] called out of what is called
[2:03:34] Judaism or from amongst the Jews and it
[2:03:37] will be
[2:03:39] 144,000 of them and right there God will
[2:03:42] then reveal to them their real tribal
[2:03:47] identities right which tribe they're
[2:03:49] really from as such amen see God will do
[2:03:53] that they're set right in order they're
[2:03:57] in their tribal order what will be in
[2:04:01] the tribal order not them regular Jews
[2:04:04] no but the ones that is elected the
[2:04:09] 144,000 will be set in order amen oh my
[2:04:15] we won't go into that that's what
[2:04:17] exactly also has to happen with the
[2:04:20] church and that's happen remember the
[2:04:22] church but with the church God has
[2:04:25] called our names already and he's
[2:04:29] telling us who we are and we don't have
[2:04:32] a number he just says there few there be
[2:04:36] right few but we know that we are a part
[2:04:40] of it and I want you to be confident
[2:04:42] that you're a part of it amen praise God
[2:04:46] hallelujah amen
[2:04:49] now he says here going to governmental
[2:04:53] Affairs right over here what are they
[2:04:56] doing they're hooking up with the Arabs
[2:04:59] don't you know God says whoever curses
[2:05:02] Israel will be
[2:05:03] cursed I said the prophet now speaking I
[2:05:08] stand with
[2:05:09] Israel can you say amen amen amen let me
[2:05:13] repeat it again I stand with
[2:05:18] Israel hallelujah praise the Lord
[2:05:22] listen what he says
[2:05:24] here every nation that turned against
[2:05:27] the Jews they s Everyone they paid a
[2:05:32] price for coming against Israel and then
[2:05:36] he goes on to talk about Muson and the
[2:05:40] other ones that tried to come against
[2:05:42] Israel and everyone sank what am I
[2:05:46] saying that every one of those people
[2:05:50] write down through history TR time
[2:05:52] through scripture that came against
[2:05:54] Israel they all paid the
[2:05:56] price all those who come against the
[2:05:59] true church PID the
[2:06:01] price and we cannot be
[2:06:04] exterminated and I close with the
[2:06:06] thought to recognize again I love this
[2:06:09] to quote it over and over again we are
[2:06:12] not creatures of
[2:06:15] time you don't come from time we came
[2:06:19] from eternity and we're going back to
[2:06:22] Eternity is that right do you know that
