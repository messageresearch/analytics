[0:58] real Church in this hour
[1:01] he wants a real
[1:02] bride oh would you take the word and cut
[1:06] our way through get out of here take
[1:10] those creeps away that the real

[1:44] God and say I am true with all these
[1:48] Traditions around me I am coming back to
[1:52] the word I'm coming back to the truth
[1:54] amen hallelujah and when I come back to
[1:57] the truth we don't want it all seasoned
[2:01] up we want that word just the way it is
[2:05] that's right that's right Hallelujah in
[2:08] other words he thinking of all these
[2:10] programs and all the fancy stuff they
[2:12] have around the word of God you know uh
[2:15] put it this way it's like you go to some
[2:17] of these great fancy churches or the
[2:20] fancy churches or like some of these
[2:22] fancy restaurants where you go and you
[2:24] pay an exorbitant some right and you and
[2:28] they give you a fancy name
[2:29] [Music]
[2:31] whatever and then the chef comes out
[2:34] with a nice you know white his nice
[2:38] napkin over his arm and he's holding a
[2:41] silver platter comes like that with a
[2:44] flare and a flourish it just like that
[2:46] and he places it before you and until
[2:49] you left with that mystery there's going
[2:51] to be a revealing now now you're waiting
[2:53] for the sermon and out he pulls the
[2:56] cover off and when he pulls the cover
[2:58] off instead of a roast docker Rose
[3:00] turkey you look and you see a small
[3:04] Medallion Medallion
[3:10] sticks is all
[3:12] right I've always told him the story of
[3:15] how many maybe a way back but they used
[3:18] to have a show what this show used to be
[3:20] called Mr T and what was that show
[3:23] anyway you know Mr T that great big
[3:26] black man with a whole lot of jewelry
[3:28] around him like that and uh you know he
[3:32] went to New York and his limo with his
[3:34] driver and he felt hungry so he stopped
[3:37] and stop at the restaurant when when he
[3:39] order us get me a steak we got to
[3:42] properly Point give me a steak and the
[3:44] guy comes back and does all this stuff
[3:47] and then he unveils and he does What's
[3:50] happen you call St he says you ain't
[3:54] getting my money man I'm going cross
[3:56] down to get me some real soul food amen
[4:01] I'm going to go cross town get me some
[4:03] real soul food and that's what we want
[4:05] sometimes you go like the Indian Chief
[4:08] and uh they said Chief how was the
[4:11] service he went to one of his foral
[4:12] church he says Lots
[4:15] Lightning L ofer
[4:17] L is that right you didn't get nothing
[4:20] from the serice he said praise the Lord
[4:22] and that's what happens they go into
[4:24] these churches they go through all the
[4:25] form Melodies they can even go through
[4:27] screaming and shouting and yelling
[4:30] falling on the ground and everything
[4:31] else but a True Believer whose ears are
[4:34] tuned to the world will realize that man
[4:37] preach this great big sermon and
[4:40] everybody is caught up with it and
[4:42] actual fact he really didn't preach
[4:45] nothing you know I went to visit the uh
[4:48] I went back to the old country many
[4:50] years ago and I visited the mother of a
[4:52] friend of mine the friend is out here
[4:56] and his mother was back there so I felt
[4:58] it was very respectful and I the lady so
[5:00] I go and just pass by and visit with her
[5:03] and when when I went there to visit with
[5:05] her she was telling me you know we
[5:08] chatted and everything else and she said
[5:10] you know she said you know one day I was
[5:13] cooking and I I placed the Cal I don't
[5:17] know if some of you don't know what that
[5:18] let me use the Canadian word
[5:20] [Music]
[5:21] Spanish they placed inside of the I
[5:25] going to say but they place it inside of
[5:29] the pan sauce not sauce pan what you
[5:32] call it FL FL one anyway she was crying
[5:36] it up she says and somebody came to
[5:38] visit me and you know I had a pile of it
[5:41] inside there and while um while I'm
[5:45] cooking I'm talking with them and uh
[5:48] we're talking and talking and then I
[5:50] realiz oh my God so I kept talking when
[5:52] I picked up the B spoon and I'm going to
[5:54] stir it she says you know I'm still
[5:56] stirring because I'm still trying to
[5:58] find it
[6:00] the whole thing went right down until it
[6:04] just came to a little handful that's
[6:05] what she meant and I'm searching for it
[6:08] within the bo but that's what you have
[6:10] to do when you go to some of these
[6:12] churches they preach and they preach and
[6:14] they preach and you for the life for you
[6:17] you're hoping that the guy will just say
[6:19] something that you can at least get a
[6:21] crown that h on to and you're not
[6:24] getting nothing is that right all you
[6:27] got is spirit is Sous Mis
[6:32] see see that's all is and you don't have
[6:34] nothing coming out from it and you
[6:36] wonder and marble that multitudes are
[6:40] running in that direction brother B said
[6:43] you see you can get a whole bunch of
[6:46] chickens every 6 weeks you can produce a
[6:48] whole bunch of chickens but you know
[6:50] what an eagle one year before you get
[6:55] one one year before you get one eag
[6:58] think about it amazing look how fast you
[7:01] can get a whole bunch of Pharisees but
[7:03] look how many years it take to develop a
[7:05] Moses or Abraham amen sometimes it's 40
[7:08] years it takes to do that that's what it
[7:11] is praise the Lord so here we are this
[7:14] is
[7:15] Christmas praise the Lord I don't see us
[7:19] having all kind of multicolored lights
[7:21] brother said that's the devil trying to
[7:25] represent the
[7:27] rainbow lights around God's Throne he's
[7:31] just a liar he's using the influence of
[7:34] that and then people he said hang palm
[7:37] trees D in Florida hang them everywhere
[7:40] there's no snow there or nothing and and
[7:42] yet they can have lights there and
[7:44] everything else and hang up all these
[7:46] lights everywhere and tinsel everywhere
[7:48] and then bringing paganism he said has
[7:51] infiltrated and mixed into Christianity
[7:53] amen and get the people to believe that
[7:55] that's Christianity that's not
[7:57] Christianity am this is
[8:00] Christianity this is Christmas God
[8:03] hiding in what Simplicity is that right
[8:07] God hiding in Simplicity not God hiding
[8:10] in a suit that's
[8:12] shiny is that right see what are you
[8:15] talking about you remember when that
[8:16] angel appeared to Mark St Martin after
[8:20] he had he had uh done something good on
[8:23] the street and that night uh uh he
[8:26] opened his eyes and there was the Lord
[8:28] standing in front of him in shining
[8:32] garments and he said Martin looked at
[8:34] him and he took a little Lo he says
[8:36] Martin don't you know me I am your Lord
[8:40] and Savior Jesus bow down and wash me
[8:44] and Martin looking again but brother B
[8:47] said the word was in St Martin and he
[8:49] realized that this being had a Crum on
[8:52] his head and the Bible said the Saints
[8:54] will from him at the End of the Age so
[8:57] Martin said you can't be him because
[8:59] what you doing with a crumb on your head
[9:02] the Saints will crumb him at the End of
[9:03] the Age disappear gone that devil took
[9:08] right off amen praise the Lord so God is
[9:10] Not featured in all this fantastic stuff
[9:13] they going on am so if you don't get a
[9:17] gift one gift this Christmas don't be
[9:20] singing the
[9:23] blues honestly goodness because you
[9:26] already got the greatest gift that
[9:28] anybody ever give you is the Lord Jesus
[9:32] Christ praise the Lord just saying that
[9:35] even if you never got any gift or
[9:38] somebody forgot you right don't feel
[9:42] slighted don't feel pushed out because
[9:45] you have the greatest gift that anybody
[9:48] can have and that gift is eternal
[9:50] life what what difference does it make
[9:54] if you have a b of gold but you got no
[9:57] water to get across the desert
[10:01] this is a story of two
[10:03] Prospectors they prospecting from gold
[10:05] and they struck gold they got it and
[10:07] they filled up their sacks and
[10:09] everything else now the boat are going
[10:10] to be rich but that night they're going
[10:13] to have to check across the
[10:15] desert and one of them decided that he's
[10:18] going to kill the other one then he
[10:19] could be poisonous Rich so he kills the
[10:23] other guy but before that happened you
[10:26] know they were drinking wine that they
[10:28] had were drinking wine that they made
[10:31] from some kind of U thing there I don't
[10:34] know how they make the tequila but
[10:35] anyway they make wine out there in the
[10:37] desert with um with the cactus they even
[10:42] know how to make a wine with that so
[10:45] they were drinking the wine and enjoying
[10:48] themselves now they're going to be rich
[10:50] and they went to sleep he killed his
[10:54] part loaded up the stuff on his um
[11:00] donkey and grabbed the water or skin
[11:05] that they had and headed out to the
[11:08] desert when he's in the middle of the
[11:11] desert got
[11:13] thirsty grabbed the
[11:16] water skin and started to drink only to
[11:20] realize that in the dark of the early
[11:23] morning he had picked up the water the
[11:27] the wine bottle and instead of the water
[11:30] bottle and the rest of the story is the
[11:33] gold didn't mean anything to him in the
[11:36] desert there because you can't eat it
[11:38] you can't drink it and he died right
[11:40] there with the sacks beside him for
[11:43] somebody else to come along and just
[11:44] pick it up that easy and that's how the
[11:46] Bible says the wicked does and the
[11:49] righteous just comes after and inherits
[11:52] it think about it amen so we don't want
[11:56] it seasoned up we just want it the way
[12:00] it is praise the Lord Jesus hallelujah
[12:05] amen last two comments
[12:09] here God knew they needed a savior but
[12:14] they were praying for a warrior to come
[12:18] and instead God gave them a
[12:21] baby they wanted a general gave them a
[12:25] laugh think about it he know
[12:29] he knew what they
[12:32] needed and that was their Christmas
[12:35] present he knows what we need he knows
[12:39] what you need today and what you and I
[12:43] need today more than above all else is a
[12:48] savior and that savior is Christ the
[12:52] Lord amen that is what we need more than
[12:55] anything else no matter much education
[12:57] whatever you have all us will come to an
[13:00] end and if you have no savior it doesn't
[13:03] make any difference but what we really
[13:05] need is to have a Savor this is the time
[13:09] to do it
[13:10] now Christmas was the birth of Christ so
[13:14] if Christmas was the birth of Christ
[13:16] would you let Christ be born in you
[13:20] again then that is Christmas that's
[13:23] right when Christ is born again in you
[13:26] that's right let Christ be born in us
[13:29] and you what is Christ Christ is the
[13:33] word amen think about him when he was
[13:37] being born it was the time of the
[13:39] decline or the fall of the Roman Empire
[13:43] look at that they were having a great uh
[13:47] a great Fandango in other words just
[13:49] like now they got commercial rejoicing
[13:51] and everything else and uh uh women
[13:54] going around more interested in sex
[13:58] appeal youth in the condition that it is
[14:02] just that the way the Roman Empire fell
[14:05] confusion among the various churches and
[14:08] religions oh think about it and increase
[14:16] taxation you know that he said as it was
[14:20] when Jesus was born the first time and
[14:22] he came the first time taxes was going
[14:26] up and then the increase and now he's
[14:30] again taxes going up how many of you
[14:35] heard about taxes going
[14:38] down your house tax going down education
[14:42] tax going down no all the time your
[14:46] taxes keep going up amen and even if
[14:49] they try to tell you oh well we will not
[14:53] uh taxes won't be raised for the next
[14:55] year or two but that w mean nothing
[14:58] because it's still going to go go up
[15:00] it's going up all the time like that so
[15:04] that's how it is Luke 2 1-7 that's where
[15:09] you'll find the scripture and it came to
[15:12] pass in the time of Herod gria that all
[15:16] the world should be taxed all the world
[15:19] and nobody's going to escape it very
[15:21] soon they're going to tax you for having
[15:22] a cat
[15:24] yeah a dog a bicycle even to have a
[15:30] phone when you pay for the phone you got
[15:32] to pay tax so what am I saying you're
[15:34] already paying tax for the phone is that
[15:36] right but everything is going to be
[15:37] taxed so uh take the word I don't want
[15:40] to expand you're spiritual it'll be a
[15:43] tax in time for
[15:44] believers not only natural tax you have
[15:47] to pay but he's telling you also that
[15:49] it's going to be a taxing time for you
[15:51] because you'll be tested all your
[15:53] friends out there jumping up and
[15:55] rejoicing
[15:57] Christmas turn on the shering gifts and
[16:00] the giv cards and everything else and
[16:03] you seem like Christmas coming and going
