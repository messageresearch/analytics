I'm good too all right amen so March break I hope you had a good week and uh you guys are just uh so the brief exhortation for tonight we called refining your gifts so refining your gifts we're going to take a scripture reading from 1st Samuel 16 15 to 23 it's going to be a brief experation basically uh recognizing what you have and everything that you're going through in your life has a purpose while you're going through what you go through um it's not you're not called by chance uh into this message right so you're not called by chance so let's bow our heads we'll pray and we'll begin Heavenly Father we thank you for your love your mercy and your grace Lord thank you for those gathered those represented here tonight Lord Jesus you bring us into a greater realization of our purpose in life what you placed in our hearts in the way of gifts Lord Jesus and father that uh gifts and callings are about repentance Lord God but we just got to give our gifts to you Lord that you can bring it to your full bring it to the full potential of why you have us here Lord you gave us you give it you gave our gifts in our lives for a reason for a purpose Lord and it's up to us to to give it to you or to keep it within ourselves Lord bless each and everyone here tonight blessed speaker Lord God hearers Lord God just let it be may your Holy Spirit just flow and just have thine own way Lord take control in Jesus Christ's name amen so it said here and Saul's servant said unto him behold now an evil spirit from the Lord troubleth thee let our Lord command thee oh sorry s all right let our Lord Now command thy servants which are before thee to seek out a man who is a cunning player out of heart cunning not just a player but a cunning player so he's refined he's been refined and it shall come to pass when the evil spirit from the Lord is upon thee that he shall play with his hand and thou shalt be well so Saul had mental illness so which is a key very very uh lot lot of uh the situations that we go through or not we as a whole but society as a whole is mental illness related right so I want to point something out to you guys very significant okay and Saul said to his servants provide me now a man that can play well not just play but play well right play well that's very key and bring him to me then answered one of his servants and said behold I have seen the son of Jesse the B bethlehemite try to say that 10 times fast that that is uh play and a mighty Valiant man and a man of war and prudent in matters and a calmly person and the Lord is with him wherefore Saul sent Messengers unto Jesse and said send me David thy son which is with the sheep and Jesse took an ass Laden with bread and a bottle with wine and a kid and sent them by David his son unto Saul and David and David came to Saul and stood before him and he loved him greatly and he became his armor Bearer and Saul said to Jesse saying let David I pray thee stand before me for he ha found favor in my sight and it came to pass when the evil spirit came from God which which came from God was upon Saul that David took the har and played with his hand so Saul was refreshed and was well and the evil spirit departed from him amen let's bow our heads father we thank you once again for the reading of your word Lord may they see the simplicity but yet the power of their gifts Lord God In The Name of Jesus Christ bless them may everyone be blessed and strengthened by your spirit Lord wash us cover us under all under the blood father in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen amen amen so when you listen to music refining your gifts refining your gifts m music usually gets people into a mental state right music gets people into a mental state whether a good one or a bad one and your gifts in particular giving unto the Lord you sing unto the Lord you Worship the Lord right it's different because you're you're worshiping God when you worship God you bring people into a mental state where they can be able to receive Faith they receive their Deliverance of whatever they're going through right and brother B mentioned the right mental state towards any promise of the word of God will make it come to pass any Divine promise of the word of God will make it come to pass but your job or your your purpose is getting people's mindset ready to receive their Deliverance that's how important it is right you might even think that that is that uh important but you have a Ministry too so everything that you be may be going through in your life all your mistakes everything that you're going through the Temptations the trials the situations the disappointments uh the isolations that you might be going through and amen everything that you may be dealing with as young people God is using that to refine you and if you're gifted and to sing gifted to to in any way possible play instruments like that it's God uses that to minister to other people amen amen amen praise the Lord and in the way of okay how many people take science isn't know about uh isn't Tak science right okay how many know people know about atoms and molecules and how they they vibrate right so this is vibrating right now by atoms and molecules Etc right the walls vibrating you can hear my voice it sends up the vibration right sends out a VI vibration you hear my voice now when you sing it sends out a vibration the beach bo uh s um um what do you call it uh yeah exactly those those uh a rock and roll band back in the days older days they they sang a song good good good good vibration right I'm not singer sorry so so good comes from the word God right good from the comes from the word God so my voice is carrying out a vibration now now they have a they actually in the medical field they have a a um they have a science called vibrational therapy I don't know if anybody's heard of that anybody heard of vibrational therapy before right so all your just say all of your okay everyone's giving off vibration right all your organs in your body has a different vibration let's just say um your liver is not doing too well or any organ in your body is not doing too well they'll get you this machine and whatever your whatever the vibrational level of the that particular organ is they will hook you up to that machine and that will they will send that vibration towards that organ in order to bring it up to that level where it's equal it's supposed to be vibrating at that equal level so if you're sick you're if that organ is sick it's actually vibrating at a lower level than normal so that machine was supposed to send VI ation out to bringing it up to a level where it's functioning normal and it's actually will be healed now from that standpoint when you give your gifts and talents to the Lord we in prayer we go through situations especially when you prayer when you pray before you start your ministry you're bringing God's going to take your voice and bring it to a different level he can pray he can sing right through you right so how do you know that you someone's Deliverance is connected with your song from an ailment that no one can be healed from or or an incurable disease then right you never know right right praise the Lord hope you guys aren't too tired I know March break you guys are probably just did nothing all week a whole lot of nothing it's okay it's all right it's all right praise the Lord so God is I'll read you a scripture here says uh Psalm 107:20 he said he sent his word and healed them so a word can be spoken a word Can Be Sung it can be said a word of kindness a word of encouragement a word of Correction right it's a word but it can be said in a certain way where it can help help somebody and heal somebody right depending how it's set a word of wisdom right a word of encouragement a word of words to a song right all right let me see in closing brief exhortation very brief praise the Lord y all okay today yes yes sir all right it's okay I know it's like Saturday evening you know I just want to chill out relax but I want to read something very significant okay very significant in 2 Kings chap 5 verse 1- 2 actually 1 to three talks about Nam a general of the Syrian Army famous General he had leprosy and back then it was incurable incurable disease back then leprosy that's it you can't you know it's uh it's like one of the incurable diseases that they have today says here now non captain of the host of the king of Syria was a great man with his master and honorable because by him the Lord had deliverance from Syria he was also a mighty man in Valor but he was a leper and the syrians had gone out by companies and brought away captive out of the land of Israel little made you know the MA's name but a little maid and she waited on non's wife and she said to her unto her mistress what to what to my Lord that the the prophet that is in Samaria for he would recover him of his leprosy the Prophet Elijah so in other words she had the answer to the man's problem you know anybody know her name anybody no but she's in there how how insignificant is that right all right so he got the answer and in verse 17 it says then he went down and dipped himself seven times actually verse 14 he went down and dipped himself seven times in Jordan according to the saying of the man of God and his flesh became the Flesh of a little child but the answer came from a little girl to point them to the answer the solution don't make yourself insignificant or don't think you're insignificant or think you know what I mean you're more important than you think you are yes that's why like I kind of brought those two little two scriptures I don't know the girl's name but everyone they knew the big dignitaries stuff like that so you might think oh makes significant this and that tell me today um anybody of these these degrees of of medical degrees cure cancer no but you you have the answer to cure cancer you have the answer to cure AIDS you have the answer to cure all these diseases and you're in high school and and and maybe not even finishing uh you know you're maybe just finishing high school or what like that or college but you have the answer to cure all these incurable diseases and God can use it through your song through your gift through a word of encouragement through your gifts okay you actually technically you're actually working on your master's degree master of all circumstances right right so you're in God's school right God is teaching you but you got to surrender your gifts to the Lord so you can reach your full potential you want to reach we want to live a full Abundant Life but the Abundant Life is In him we're all being refined I'm being refined we're all being refined we're all being changed is allow God to change you by God's help amen so in that being said um and to close off I'm not you know I'm not much of a singer but one of the you is like I go I sing a song special she yeah

all right praise God Amen you are that chosen generation praise God that God is going to use you wherever you are the age that you're at right now you need to realize that because you've heard this message that God has given us in this day you're a carrier and you've got like brother Cory said you've got a vibration moving through you that can deliver people amen deliver them from their disease
