this morning I trust you've all come with expectation in your hearts amen amen praise God I'm excited I'm excited because every time we assemble around the word of God he comes amen he's here before we get here amen did you know that he's all listen when he went to the he had a he had a need to go to Samaria he got to Samaria before the woman came he was waiting there and when she came up then something Supernatural happened amen praise God so if you've come today you might have you might have circumstance ances that you need the Lord to deal with in your life I can imagine that that woman she was carrying those water pots but there was much heavier burden that she was carrying when she was walking to that well amen and she just she just needed something beyond what she could possibly imagine to happen she had no idea what she was going to encounter that morning amen or that evening and I believe that if we've come with that kind of you know that kind of a heart to know that listen we're we're we're serving the Living God that he's he's able you know sometimes we don't see him sometimes we you know we we get discouraged we find ourselves in situations where we just need the Lord so bad and you know he just you you pray and nothing happens you pray and nothing happens you pray and then all of a sudden something starts to stir up and then you get yourself into the presence of the Lord and then all of a sudden under that kind of a burden and desperation God speaks amen amen praise God I believe this morning that he wants to speak to some of us this morning amen praise God and so um you know before we go to the word of God let's just um you know I want to share some things with you uh you know from from this week I had a you know very wonderful interesting wonderful kind of a week this week many things going on but you know um I was I was here during the week and I was studying and I was just you know praying and you know and I said you know what I got to go for a walk you know cuz I realized man I'm sitting too much you know you got to get up you got to move you got to exercise I said I'm going to go for a walk you know so I got out and I went for a walk I went down through the neighborhoods Here for a Good 20 25 minute walk and I crossed over to the other side and as I'm walking across you know I'm looking at the church and I'm and I'm just I'm just saying oh man praise God I'm looking at this church I said Lord it's incredible what you've done for us and it just started you know going through my mind on how he brought us from where we were amen and here you know uh uh here he's given us this beautiful church and you know I kept walking along and then I finally got all the way down to the lights down by Fortinos there and I crossed over and I'm walking back and I'm just pondering on the Lord and I'm looking at everything I'm looking at the homes I'm looking at the addresses on the home and I'm looking at all the different addresses and you know you're just you're just walking right and and then I started to ponder I started looking at the address and then I thought about our address and I said 5270 New Street you know just thoughts right but I said you know Lord I know that everything is in the word we are the word we are the expression of the word and every detail in our lives was in his book in the word of God and I thought you know when I started to ponder I said 5270 I started to think about chapters you know like how many books in the Bible have 52 chapters you know 52 and then I thought 70 and I thought man I don't know if there's a book that has a 70th verse but the first thought that came to my mind was the book of Isaiah and so I went immed I'm walking and I open my phone and I go to Isaiah 52 go ahead put it up and Isaiah 52 reads you know now I got 52 and I got seven to 10 because I I said well there's no 70 but then I said okay well 5 * 2 is 10 and then the next number 7 * * 7 is 70 I said okay so we'll read to verse 10 and so I read to verse 10 and it says how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good news I said Good Tidings which means good news and then I was reading there and I'm going good neighbor Ministries the Lord is good you know and I just kept reading and that publisheth peace that bringeth good tidings of good there it is again that publisheth salvation that saith un to Zion thy God reth thy Watchmen shall lift up the voice with the voice together shall they sing I believe God has raised up Watchmen in this hour God is God has raised up uh you know uh under the five full ministry that's that that are the Watchmen of this hour to bring the word of God for this hour and it was just all pouring into me and and and then for they shall see eye to eye when the Lord shall bring again Zion oh he's bringing this bride back together again he's restoring the body of Jesus Christ and they shall see eye to eye you will not get a different Revelation than I've got in this word in this message you you can't get a different Revelation because it's Christ if you're in the body of Christ you're going to catch the the United Body of Christ Revelation amen and he's the one that's going to give you the Revelation you're not going to have more Revelation you can't have more Revelation you can only have what he gives you by Revelation amen and he says they they'll see eye to eye when the Lord shall bring Zion Break Forth into Joy sing together ye waste lands of Jerusalem we know that there's a New Jerusalem that God is now forming amen the body of Christ amen for the Lord hath comforted his people he hath redeemed Jerusalem the Lord hath made made bear his holy uh arm in the eyes of all the nations and all the ends of the Earth shall see the salvation of our God hallelujah praise God I don't know if we've ever noticed that if anybody ever noticed that in the scripture but that just came all you know like a tremendous blessing as I was walking and I was pondering and I was thinking about our lives in Christ listen what it told me was that this is exactly where we're supposed to be amen this is the house of God that He gave unto us this is our home this is where we get fed this is where he wants to meet us amen praise God this is a glorious you know glorious thing to the Sons and Daughters of God when you come to realize and all of a sudden you know you start pondering about your whole life that led you here and I started to think about my whole life you know and I started to now now God is in numbers yeah God is God is is listen mathematics was not created by Newton or whoever it was that that came up with you know math formulas and this and that God is perfect and perfect in his in his numbers in his in his uh his thought there's nothing he's omniscient he's omnipresent there's nothing that that he misses I know you're standing but no I'm we're already preaching amen the Lord's already showing us here because the this whole thought is going to flow here today amen but I you know he says share that because they need to know that that this is something that that he he he did this and this is where we're supposed to be sometimes you wonder should I be at this church oh I wonder if you know if this is where I'm supposed to go or or if if you know is this real you know because sometimes you got to go back and you got to you got you got to think about where God brought you from amen I started to think about all those things and if you start to do those things you're going to see I was born in 1961 I said Lord 1952 well praise God there it is 52 right there you're supposed to be here amen amen and you see 61 was when the when the church ages the Le Dean Church age amen but this today I'm 63 and the seals were opened in ' 63 There was a there was a brand new Bible that was being unveiled in 1963 amen and God God started a whole new chapter in in in my life in in in 2024 at you know at 63 I started all these things you know like you can't I was laying in bed this morning and this is where all this started pouring in while I I was you know just waking up and the Lord was just pouring in all these things and you were you know you when when I when I started to deal with your life you know you your first job was at Caravan trailer rentals and and Caravan had three camels and the owner of the company was Gabriel alter he just reminded I know I've probably told you these things Gabriel alter and I went into that company and I I started to work at that company and I went from the manufacturing assembly line to his rightand man in the company purchasing all of his raw material spending millions of dollars at 23 24 years old like 22 years old like I was a young man and and then and then he says and you know what you had a Rebecca I said yeah he says well Jennifer was your Rebecca oh my goodness I said pray I met her right there and he says and you remember what happened like he started pouring all of these things I want you to listen I'm telling you these things because God's real you need to you need to know that he's in your life not he started in your life before you were a baby crying before before you were in your mother's womb he already knew you glory to God hallelujah praise God Amen and here we are amen here we are at 5270 New Street God is doing a new thing hallelujah praise God hallelujah you just you you just can't you just can't get away from God no once he's open your understanding and he comes to you and you know God comes to everybody at different times amen God God got to become a real he's got to become personal to you until he becomes personal to you it's just church I'm telling you now it's just it's just tradition it's just well if I go to church I'll be in the Rapture no no the Rapture is already in progress you're you're if you're if you've if you've awakened to the revelation of this word you've already been raptured you you're already out of this world you can't connect with this world you know like everything is so perfect perect you know the way God does things praise God hallelujah glory to God Amen well you know what let's go to the word shall we amen how many has a need here this morning glory to God Amen I want to remember brother Frank balisimo my business partner he had a gallbladder attack over the last few

the hospital there and I was in so much pain he says he says everything just everything's just started fading away he says he didn't know what it was he thought it was dying he didn't know when you're in that like gallbladder pain can be pretty bad amen and he says he says the thoughts just started pouring into him he's all these thoughts he says man Solomon scripture started to pour into me all vanity it's all vanity everything we're trying to do we're we're working we're trying to acquire more trying to make more trying to do this it's all vanity of vanities he says cuz he realized that that in one Split Second God can take us amen and we just you know if there's anything that we want to be prepared is we want to be prepared for that moment amen we don't want to be leav in anything undone amen praise God we want to make sure that we're walking with the Lord and that we're conscious of him and that we've made him first in our lives let's pray father we so thank you this morning

praise the glory and the honor in the name of Jesus Christ we give you thanks amen and amen praise God let's go to the word of God Allelujah amen we're going to be um we're going to be starting something uh this week um we're going to see how it all unfolds I'll be honest with you you got to pray you got to pray for me while we're ministering the word of God you got to pray that the Lord meets your needs through it because I listen when I was studying in all of this and writing and putting the quotes down in the scriptures there was so much pouring into my mind and my heart I was rejoicing I was I was getting stimulation like crazy but then you go to put it into words and it's it's almost impossible possible how do you put Revelation into words you can't put Revelation into words I realize it's Unwritten this aspect that we're looking at we you know we're going to be looking at the book and how it's ready to be revealed in the last times and what's in the book and you know one of the aspects of the book is that you know let's read the scripture and let's go from there amen praise God cuz I got you standing and I realize amen first Peter uh 1 verses 3 to 5 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy hath begotten us again you need to begotten you need to be begotten again now you can take that word again and my goodness I don't know we we could go from from Genesis to Revelation amen but you know you can be born again you can be you know there's there's just too much to get into there unto a lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead so this is a key element the Resurrection The the anointing the spirit of God to to to resurrect something that was not aware not alive amen from the dead to an inheritance Incorruptible that's what we're going to that inheritance is not just another place but it's also another body it's another aspect of our existence as attributes as uh uh thoughts and a part amateure Gods a part of God Amen praise God Incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven heaven is not some place a billion miles up there Heaven is just another dimension brother brandham says it's right here in the church it's just another dimension that you're gonna pass that if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved you're going to move right into that heaven amen it's kept who are kept by the power of God through faith listen it's Revelation that's keeping you it's Revelation that's brought you here this morning it's Revelation that's going to change your vile your mortal bodies to make them incorruptible it's going to take the power of God unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time you may be seated praise God hallelujah glory to God Amen you know it's just impossible for us to possibly you know um uh understand the book you know there's there's like there's there's there's millions of church Church es this morning all over the Earth that are reading from this very same Bible they're reading the same very same scriptures amen but yet there's something about the word of God that unless the spirit of God unless the Holy Ghost unless you've been awakened unless you've been you've been revealed unless you've been unveiled amen unless the part of you that that that God wants to use in this time in this dispensation in this hour is awakened the word of God will could will have none effect it'll be traditions of man they're reading the same book the same Bible but yet there's things within the word of God look we just drew out of this one scripture more than probably you could possibly imagine you could preach you could preach 10 sermons on this very scripture why because it's Eternal the word of God is eternal the Bible is only a written book but yet that book it contains the whole plan of God the whole uh you know God the self-existent one the whole Mind Of God is contained within that book but yet people read the scriptures and you get all kinds of different interpretations from it One Believes there's three Gods Another One Believes there's no God another one believes that there's this and one believes you baptized that way another one believes you can baptize this way but without the spirit without the the anointing of God's word upon your life it's only letters it's only religion it's only tradition you're just doing everything by works you think that oh if I go to church more I'll get more yes there's that's true truth but you got to have a revelation of coming into church you got to be coming because you're coming to meet with him not to be seen by your brothers and sisters not to be seen putting your money into the plate so that everybody can see that you give that's not what being a church a part of the body of Christ is all about amen there's so much more to the word of God Amen praise God let's go to the next scripture well before yeah let's read that scripture having made known unto us now this is this is this is you know we're looking at the book we're looking at what's going to be revealed how the word is going to be revealed in the last time because we're in the last time amen amen there's listen Revelations 10 said time shall be no more so we need to we we need to understand what took place through through that Ministry that would bring us to a place where time now yes we're living in time yes we are in time bodies this is this is what we're we're in right now but we are being translated the Rapture is in progress the Rapture is a revelation so we need to understand how it is that the Rapture is going to take place in our lives and it's not going to be by intellectual understanding I can only tell you so much and you can only read so much commentaries by men and and other but the Rapture is a Divine thought revelation of God that once it comes into you you you become the Rapture you start to Quicken you start to move out of this world's ways and the ways of this world you start to operate and move in a totally different way than the rest of the world you become strange amen very true but he it's having made known unto us the mystery of his will and his will is written in the word it's in the book everything about our inheritance everything about where we came from and everything about where we're going is all written in the book Hallelujah and we need to understand the mystery of his will amen according to his good pleasure which he hath purp purposed in himself so people want to interpret the word people want to put their own interpretation of the word there's a scripture that says lean not unto your own understanding God is his own interpreter God will interpret for himself what it is that he's doing remember this book is is is all about Christ it's all about God's plan everything from A to Z amen praise God which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times now did we not say that Revelations 10 1-7 the mighty Angel come down put one foot on the land one on the sea and say that time shall be no more so we need to move into that realm of Faith where where where time has come to an end for this world am time is still happening we're still progressing the world is moving on everything is progressing all prophecy around us is still being fulfilled but you are the church you are the body of Christ you are the bride you are the one that's going to receive a revelation for the Rapture and our focus is on the Rapture our fulfillment of scripture is going to be people are going to know that we fulfill the scripture when they don't see us anymore where they can't find us where we're going to be gone in the moment in the twinkling of an eye and this is a process this is a process and and don't ask me how this process is going to un unveil itself in your life I just know how it's working in my life you know we're just going to bring the word of God God and the word faith cometh by hearing that's why I said you need to pray you need to pray because what I what was being unveiled to me and what was stimulating me while I was studying all of this I can't convey it to you all I know is that that that God is real God God God discerns my heart he he he discerns my needs he knows exactly where I'm at he's placed me where I'm supposed to be and that gives me Faith to know that I'm in the word of God that I'm seeing it I'm seeing it so listen the dis of the fullness of times he might gather together in one not in a hundred different churches in one and that's why it's important to understand now it's not I'm not saying that this is the one place no Christ he's the only provided place where God has placed his name it's where he's placed his name it's the mystical Supernatural body of Jesus Christ amen that we might Gather in one all things where in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on the earth even now he just makes it clear here in him even in him so everything that is being manifested that that is Eternal exactly okay we need to make this clear all things that are written in the Bible are not Eternal there's a lot of characters and individuals that were written into the word of God that had a beginning and an end that was their story it started and it ended there but you as an attribute of God you were in him before you came here you were in his thoughts you were already uh having fellowship with him in his mind you were an eternal thought and you can never not be that's that's the part of the word that is Unwritten that's an element of the book that you can't put words to it just comes into manifestation God just interpet rets it in your life all of a sudden things start to happen around you I didn't understand what was going on 30 years ago I didn't understand that the that I was hearing the word from friends and people were telling me about the word and I had a nephew that was constantly telling me I need to give my heart to Christ and I had a truck driver that was telling me I needed to go to church on Saturday or I was going to go to hell I had I I had all kinds of but nothing triggered me right nothing triggered me until until this came until this Revelation came not because it was you know uh ordained in in a certain uh um experience no it was because of the time and the season that the word was going to manifest in our lives in my life it happened to start through brother Gabriel another messenger yeah you see God has his ways and times and that's why he comes to everybody individual in his time and in his season amen praise God so both which are in heaven on Earth everything that's Eternal is is Christ because he is the self-existent one having no beginning and no end so that's what we're talking about in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being pre destinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will like is there anything else that needs to be said there you see people read this scripture and they don't realize that this is the story of Jesus Christ in the Plan of Redemption and that everything that was in his mind that was in his mind that was eternal was was going to go through a plan known as The Plan of Redemption and at some point in time the water of the word was going to was going to touch and come upon your life and at that appointed time you were going to awaken to who you really are not a churchgoer not a not not somebody that that that that can that can do great works of the flesh no a son or daughter of God because you're you're only a son or daughter of God here on Earth did you know that son or daughter is just a description it's just a word it's just a a a description of what something is just like Hammer just like tool okay just like screwdriver just just like house it's it's a word that describes something but here we're known as Sons and Daughters of God when the Holy Spirit quickens you by the Holy Ghost and that attribute starts to manifest in your life and that starts to show that you're actually a son because you received the Holy Ghost you've received the spirit of God you've received the seed word has germinated that attribute that was that was waiting for its time and season let's go on so here now listen listen go to the next uh slide here so in Luke 24 25-27 then he said unto them oh fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them all the scriptures the things concerning himself he started to expound to them he you know I could imagine that that he started to tell them about I was in Moses I was the one that stood there and went up to pharaoh and said thus sayeth the Lord I am that I am he was probably their hearts were burning within them thank you Lord as they were walking along he was telling them expounding everything about himself because he is the book he is the beginning he is the end everything that that he was expressing throughout the whole Old Testament through every character and every individual was Christ it was God it was the self-existent one it was Elohim it was him expressing himself through every action and every aspect because listen go to the next slide listen to brother Braham he says Christ The Mystery of God revealed he is amen the principal theme of the entire Bible amen he is the entire Bible if you read the Bible and you don't see Christ in every verse of it go back and read it again amen Oh Glory to God and I'm telling you you listen I don't care how many Church you know they you got you've been to Sunday school you've gone to church for so many years you belong to baptist Presbyterian Methodist that's got nothing to do with it it's got nothing to do with where you came from in the church that you belong to this is a new calling this is a different calling this takes you beyond denomination this takes you beyond just churchgoing and and and church formality amen praise God hallelujah you got to be able to see Christ in every aspect of the word if you can't see Christ in every verse of the Bible then you read it you read it again because you've missed something the Bible is Christ in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the word what was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us God took himself a human body and he dwelt Among Us in [Music] time when you read in the beginning God created there is Christ see every from that to the Amen in the Book of Revelations is every word testifying of Jesus Christ Oh Glory to God let me tell you Saints I praise God you know I can't begin to explain to you this is something that you've got to catch on your own this is the word of God that that that Revelation is not something that that is conveyed it is received because he gives it thank you Jesus he lets the word go forth and then he rides a portion of that word right into your heart brother he's he he knows exactly what you need sister he knows exactly where you're at exactly how and he'll speak to you and you'll think he's talking about you know the Book of Revelation and yet as he's talking about that book there's something inside of me that's that's stirring up I can't quite I'm seeing something and and it's and it's real like all of a sudden he starts to flash back some experience that you may have had this week or some thought that you were pondering on or something that you were reading in the scriptures amen something that that you know because the body of Christ it's a supernatural body remember God is the he's he's the all in all there isn't a thought that you can think that he hasn't already thought there isn't a prophecy that you're going to see come to pass that was not already finished in his mind Hallelujah praise God you know we were talking there yesterday I was talking with brother Mike I was saying you know I said man you know when when when the elections were going on and and Trump was going to be going back you know he was he was you know in the in the the race for the for the White House God started you know speaking to my heart again about the last Trump the last Trump and I was actually going to put a a service together and then I realized that the service that Pastor Simon was going to minister was the one that I wanted to minister at because of the timing of what was being revealed to me you see everything is timing right but that's just the mind of God we can tap into those things at any time what where God wants us to allow us to tap in but it was in my mind in my thoughts and I was wondering oh praise God because I remember in 2016 when when when when President Trump was was was uh you know running for president I ministered a message on the last Trump back then and he ended up coming into Power amen and so I said well you know here it's coming back again but I couldn't quite understand it but then yesterday you know we're we're fellowshiping brother Mike says oh you know I listened to his a brother you know he's from I think Arizona and he was talking about the brother and he was saying you know he brought out a thought on on on uh on Trump you know now we know that Trump listen unless he's bir by the word of God a moment before he translates Christ is only using the vessel okay we see that God raised up many many individuals in the scriptures that were vessels of honor and dishonor amen I don't see God in that man but I see God keeping that man for a purpose that I do see amen amen but I don't see the Fulfillment of scripture other than how I tie it back to the word of God not as as an attribute of God I I'm sorry I I can't see those things not at this point okay but anyways we'll let we'll let the Holy Spirit interpret like I said but then he says yeah but the brother you know he brought out a good point he was ministering and that I believe was the mind of the Lord he says a president can only have two terms and this will be the last Trump because he'll only be able to run and be be be president in this term now that he's going to be president for four more years and so that'll make him the last Trump and how that ties back to scripture and how that pertains to us well God will interpret it but I believe he's got a great part to play in bringing about everything because he's a money man he's all about business he's the right kind of guy that can put a business deal together and man I'll tell you if anybody can put a business deal together it's Trump he doesn't care what he's got to do he can make it happen amen he has a way of putting business deals together and there's going to be business deals that are going to have to come together in order to fulfill prophecy where the where the Beast system is going to have to come into fullness and there's going to have to be a money deal and there's going to need to be uh uh you know where people will not be able to buy or sell and listen but you know what guess what we're not here for that we're gone before all of that but yet you are witnessing prophecy being Vindicated by modern events these things are this is a listen he holds the highest seat as a president on Earth because they look to the United States as the country okay now there's Russia Ria and there's China and they see themselves in certain ways but we know what brother brandham said we know exactly what the word says about America and how they started and how they're going to end amen and so we need to see prophetically where Trump fits in to the whole plan amen he fits in somewhere because we are here and these things are happening in our day praise God brother Philip amen I'm excited because I I'm seeing the word come into manifestation we we can't identify every little part but all God wants you to do is identify with the word that you are where do you fit in what are you are supposed to do in this day and in this hour how are you going to be a part of the body of Christ and manifest the word that's going to edify the body for your local church with which the whole local church is going to be caught up together we which are alive and remain shall not hinder them that sleep the dead in Christ shall rise first and we which are alive doesn't mean just us in the church here all the body of Christ wherever they all he said that he's going to bring together all things amen praise God he's going to draw them from this church that church from here from there from the north from the south from the East and the West they're going to they're going to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye amen praise God hallelujah and this is what we are looking uh toward Saints praise God hallelujah amen and so here now um let me go to uh the next so here Jesus was speaking in Luke and what what was he doing he was basically opening the scriptures to the disciples giving them a clear revelation of who they were okay who he was sorry and and and by the time that he got you know we talked about this last week when we had the Lord's Supper he was breaking the bread he was breaking the word to them he was unveiling the word to them he was making them aware of their their purpose they they they had a purpose in walking with him yes they were going to be the first church God Was preparing them giving them what they had need of opening the word to them opening their part in the word so that they could come into their position amen praise God and that's what he was doing he was expounding himself amen hallelujah and so here now in in Christ The Mystery of God revealed we want to move on here now because this message Christ mystery of God revealed I can't get enough of it I don't know about you but you need to go back and listen to it again listen to it again because it is so full of nuggets amen and and things where and and you you've heard it before you've listened to it before but let me tell you we are progressing into a season of the fullness of time and as we progress in the word of God you are going to hear things that you never heard before am because this book is it's got things in there that are Unwritten they're they're they're they're they're destined for a certain time and season amen it's it's not it's not going to be like you know don't put your own interpretation just listen feed on it and let you know go back and and and let these sermons you know stir you know go back listen and and you'll hear things that you never heard before and all of a sudden it just becomes more it makes more sense and I I'm just telling you all you're going to see is more of Christ amen and you're going to see him in you amen he goes here and he continues in the in Christ The Mystery of God revealed he says you've got to make the picture look right it's God's great picture and there is only one way you'll see it that when you see Jesus Christ there there is the entire Bible he's the principal theme of The Bible amen and so brother Brenham in 19 1963 he preached this message saying that he wanted to title this message based on the entire Bible go back listen he talks he says and I want to name it Christ The Mystery of God revealed and I want to base it not on the topic of the book not on the topic of redemption not on a topic he says upon the entire Bible right the whole book amen everything that that that we need every mystery every thing that that that we thought we knew was going to be was going to be revealed in a way like we had never heard it before but that's only if you've got an attribute if you've got election if in you was was the mind of God before the foundations of the world you were you were expressed for this time that's why in this time there will only be a group that going to receive it like when Jesus was on the earth how many actually received him like this is history there was a dozen that actually recognized and even then they had to come into their position in the word they had to feed on the word they had to be with him John would ask questions but then John that's why when you read the book of John John was was so close to Jesus because Jesus was giving him Revelation and upon revelation of of who he was and who Jesus Christ was the relationship you see that's what this is all about it's our relationship with him amen so the whole Bible was being uh this message of Christ The Mystery of God was based on the the entire word of God because he is the entire word of God he goes on and he says he is the principal theme of The Bible he was in the prophets he was in the Psalms he was in the history of the Bible the Bible is a prophetic book it's a historical book it's a book of love it's a book of songs it's a book of life and in there you find Christ he was in the prophets he was in the Psalms he was in the history and he also in the Bible is the things that is to Come Oh Glory to God you mean you mean there's things to come you mean that you mean the word is going to progress into our day and there's going to be things that that we're going to recognize and that we're going to hear in the word and that we're going to come to realize that's me that's that you mean you mean that's my time you mean my season is coming that where I've got to manifest the word of God you young people let me tell you you you you just don't realize but there's going to be a moment and there's going to be a a time if it hasn't already happened where you are going to realize that Jesus Christ is a reality and that he was not just in mommy and daddy telling you to come to church he's going to have to become real to you he's going to have to open himself up to you he's going to come into the deepest parts of your heart and your mind and your soul and he's going to discern situations and all the hurts and all the pains and all the heartaches and all the things that that that that that that have torn you apart over the years even being under you know even being brought up in this message there's a lot of young people that they were mishandled they were mishandled by their own parents because their own parents were living off law all they could do was put law put law but now the law has been set aside and Grace has come until Grace comes com into your life you'll just know everything by law you'll just oh that's because my parents said so no you need to you need to be able to say because the word says so because the word tells me who I am not my parents my parents told me I was a bum that I'd probably amount to nothing because I was I was rebelling against the word and there's things we said to our children that we need to go back and say I'm sorry we need to make those kinds of things right so that we can get things things in the right perspective so that they can have the same experience that you've got the reality of God personal he comes to everybody at different times hallelujah praise God Amen and he says here he he was the Psalms he was in the history and he also in the Bible is the things that is to come so he was before until after after what does that make him then the same yesterday today and forever he will do the same things that he's done for you he'll do them for your friends for your family for your loved ones for your children for your husband or for your wife he will do the same thing because he is not the respector of persons he said my sheep hear my voice all that the father hath given me will come not one of them will be lost I don't care you might you might say my son's a bum my daughter's not going to make it they're serpent seed they're you know this person my boss he's serpent seed this one here he's this he's that let me tell you something God took what looked like serpent seed okay I don't know about you but you just look at your own life it didn't reflect Jesus Christ at at all I I sometimes I wonder and I say my God but you know what while we were yet sinners while we were yet in that unbelief and in in that adultery and in that fornication and in that we were we were believing this and believing that he still loved you because you are a part of him you were with him when when when he was expressing all of these thoughts in his mind before the foundations of the world he he he saw you exactly the way he wants you to be and you are going to be that because he cannot he said my word shall not return void and if you are the word that went forth you can't be void you've got to express him you've got to show Christ you've got to bring him on the scene amen praise God hallelujah glory to God he's the same yesterday today and forever amen glory to God he says listen he says wherefore in First Peter and it's not up there but I've got it in my notes Here 1 Peter 1:13 he says wherefore gir up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is going to reveal himself to you personal am what is the revelation of Jesus Christ it's the opening of the word it's where the word becomes your life becomes your reality becomes your absolute amen you're not going to rely on the word of man anymore you're although you're going to listen to the word of man you're going to reason with the word of man but the word that is revealed to you remember it's revelation of Jesus Christ This Book of Revelation if you look at it the Revelation means a apocalypse people think it's a apocalypse meaning some some great you know terrible destructive events no a apocalypse if you go look at the actual meaning it's revealing it's the revealing the revealing of Jesus Christ that's why it's the revelation of Jesus Christ and the whole book of Revelation it's all in symbols it's all symbols and it's all written in certain ways and unless the revelation of Christ the Holy Ghost is in you it's just a book and you and most people they can't understand it they can't put it all together they don't understand what it means that and a lamb stood a bleeding lamb before the foundations of the world and he had a book in his hand they don't understand what that was all about but that's what we're going to be looking at here that's what we that's what's being revealed right now that's going to Quicken us it's going to give us faith for a Rapture there has to be something in the word that's going to change our mortal bodies we're going to put on incorruption because right now we're Incorruptible bodies we're we're we're having corruptible situations in our lives we're we're facing circumstances that we don't want in our lives and God's going to give us the faith to break out of those things for so that those things can fall away from our lives and that we're not going to be all caught up into those things amen he's lifting the veil so that we can recognize the Mysteries that were released when those seals unlocked the book hallelujah praise God forever more now he says here in the message the seventh seal he says now the eighth chapter only reveals the scene the scene of the seventh seal where nothing else is revealed notice that there was just a half hour of Silence when that seal was opened now nothing is not revealed in the seventh seal now he has something to now has nothing to do with the seventh chapter of Revelation has nothing to do with chapter 7 chapter 8 you see this is the whole thing that's why thank God he sent a prophet thank God he sent Malachi 4 thank God he sent Revelations 10 1-7 so that there could be a seventh Messenger on the earth that would be able to take the word just like Luther Luther was at a at a certain appointed time and season right in the Catholic church and God decides to go and visit him and open the word to him and say the just shall live by faith Martin Martin all these teachings that you've been uh under and all these Catholic doctrines and you know you got to have a a priest that's got to absolve you of your sins and you've got to go through a a a Holy Father and you've got to have a p no he says no he says the just those that are that are Sons and Daughters what you're trying to be Martin you're trying I I see that your heart is for me he says you need Revelation you're going to live by Revelation and when that struck him all of a sudden now he could read the word himself he could see himself in the word of God he could see that hey wait a minute this is all about me this is not about me interpreting it for somebody else and putting my own interpretation on it and that's why the Reformation took place and started with Martin Luther because that was the breaking away of the Holy Spirit allowing the word now to be restored so that it could come through and come down through Martin Luther then John Wesley on on on on uh uh being Sanctified by the word of God to Pentecost which was to receive the Holy Ghost and receiving the Holy Ghost makes makes way for Christ himself that's why a lot of people can receive the Holy Ghost they can speak in tongues they can get the sensations they can sing like Angels they can prophesy they can do all those things but if behind that is not an attribute God himself then that Spirit can lie that Spirit can can deceive that's why brother Bram says man he says I I seen one guy he was he was prophesying and and anointed like crazy and another one here prophesying and anointed but then God gave the prophet the ability to discern the lives and he says that man was living like a devil that man had all kinds of unbelief but yet he was in the church because he had only received a baptism and you need more than the baptism the baptism just makes you makes you susceptible for for for the word himself to come personal directly to you to where now he'll speak to you and he'll say now listen you need to go into that tub over there you need to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you you want to be my wife then you got to take my name my name is Jesus you need to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and if that attribute is not there that person will turn around and say I already got baptized I was baptized when I was a baby that's not scriptural the word is speaking to you can the word go against his own word never can do it that's why if your life doesn't reflect an uh the word of God so baptism he that believeth and is baptized how does a baby believe oh but my parents believed and so I can just live any way I want because my parents believe for me they baptize me so when I die I'm going to go to heaven but I can live any way I want but yet God wants to come into your life wants to place you into the body because you were brought here to this Earth for a purpose and you need to and until a person really discovers their purpose they can never be fully satisfied I don't care what anybody says you'll look to money to get satisfaction you'll look to sex you'll look to food you'll look to all these things and you'll get temporary satisfaction but Jesus when he went to that woman at the well he says you'll never thirst again if I give you a drink of this and let me tell you I don't thirst anymore I don't thirst for the things of the world anymore I use the things of the world for the for the benefit and for the glory of God but my purpose and my life and my whole focus is the word and what he's got planned for me and I know that that that this world is falling apart and I know that he's got something that's going to take us out of here so that we don't have to go into that amen praise God and that's his word and so that is different when you've received the Holy Ghost and the connection now wakens that you were always a daughter of God and when I say daughter of God remember Adam and Eve in the garden before before there was Adam and Eve read it go back and read the scriptures it's all there after you hear messages like this where the word is being unveiled you go back and you read it you're going to see things differently you're going to see that Adam was expressed in the very image of God he was God what he did was he expressed himself in human form as Adam and in Adam was both male and female amen because in God is both male and female but God what he did was when he took Adam he separated the female from the womb of the man and called it woman and she was now the female aspect of Adam because remember this is all about the Plan of Redemption the whole Paradox is that we got to go back to God's Plan of Redemption cuz without understanding The Plan of Redemption this is all confusing why would God allow Eve to fall why God knew that you know why allow her to fall why not just you know play out the plan exactly the way because he wanted to be a redeemer don't ask me what and why God does what he does all I know is that I'm rejoicing in the part of redemption it's is wonderful to know that that we we actually are fulfilling the portion of redemption so when Adam you go back and read it when he when he first expressed Adam it says and he called their name Adam and Eve had not even been expressed yet because God saw his Plan of Redemption God saw that he was going to have a church because Eve is an is is a is a type of the end time Church she was the one that fell at the beginning but the second the Bible says was Jesus Christ who is a quickening spirit that is going to take the bride take all the Amnesia off of her awaken her to the understanding of who she is in the word of God so that she can come into her rightful position as the bride the wife the word made flesh in her day amen glory to God hallelujah I know that's a mouthful but go back read pray and see see what the Holy Spirit reveals to you and you will see that that everything was the expression of God is all the expression of God hallelujah amen praise God so here now he says now the eighth chapter only reveals the scene the scene of the seventh seal where nothing else is revealed now nothing is not revealed in the seventh seal now has nothing to do with the seventh chapter of Revelation it's the revealing of the seventh seal is perfectly mute there was silence in heaven when that seventh seal was open why what's going on thank God we had a prophet thank God that the word has been revealed amen he goes on to say here he says and if and if I only had time I'd try a few places to show you all the way back from Genesis this seventh chapter this seventh seal is spoke of from the very beginning in Genesis this seventh seal these seals moved right on up so here he is he's saying now it's all silent it's all mute but then he says but if I had some time and this is what we're doing we're the ones that are that have the time we're the ones that have received the Revelation we're the ones that the word has been opened up to now that we can go back into the word of God and he's saying that that seventh seal was being revealed already in the Book of Genesis but yet it was the unwritten aspect of the book we're going to be we're going to be moving into because you know one of the things that that I've learned you know as a minister now is that you preach a message with the end in mind sure because you're moving towards something that that that God has revealed but God needs to bring it in a way where bite-size you can receive a a young one can receive a little bit the Lambs can receive it the sheep that you know feed my Lambs feed my sheep God wants everybody to catch their portion here amen new Believers people that are just coming in that have never heard the word in this way is because it's a time and a season for all things this is your time this is your season it's not because you you by chance no it wasn't by chance that I just went I didn't know Gabriel for ready I had no idea who he was but my partner said oh my wife deals with this guy he does he makes beautiful Furniture go see him tell him that my wife sent you he'll give you a good deal I said okay I need Furniture I had no idea that there was an attribute in that vessel that had an appointment with another attribute I had no idea but all he did was he handed me a tape he didn't understand he I said man you gave me an amazing deal this is incredible he asked me are you a Christian I said I don't know I was brought up Roman Catholic I said but if that's Christianity I'm a hypocrite man I just told him straight oh he goes that's good you know if you got to know brother Gabe to understand that he says well that's good he in his mind he was going oh my God finally somebody that that that that that that you know that that that that that's really you know saying the right thing man okay here listen to this I had no idea but there was an Awakening in a time and a season for every one of us we don't know when it's going to you could be in this message for 20 years and this morning God lifts the veil amen he could just remove the the the the the blinders on your eyes because of tradition because of things that you were taught because of how you interpret things we don't want to put our own interpretation on things we want to let the Holy Spirit just in the Simplicity unveil himself and make himself real to us personal Hallelujah he says this seventh seal is spoke of from the very beginning in Genesis so here let's go to the next slide and he says you know in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth right from the very beginning God Elohim the self-existent one if you go back and you study the actual you know words and you take God it's not God God is a word that was put into writing the actual word is Elohim self-existent one one that was was all omniscient omnipresent could create worlds because the Bible says that the worlds were framed by the word of God all God had to do was think a thought but once it becomes word it it expresses it manifests that's why you you were walking you're just a walking soul on Earth but inside of you by election by predestination from before the foundations of the world when you were coming out of your mother's womb and that baby that body was living off of the mother it would feed off the mother it would Breathe off the mother it was living off of the mother but until that baby was delivered from the womb a breath of life came into that which is the soul and that Soul had an attribute in it if it was an attribute of God the Bible says there are children of God and there are children of the wicked one that's why you got to go back to Genesis remember Genesis is the seed book for all things everything that originated originated in the Book of Genesis you got to go back there and you're going to see that Eve was not defiled by eating an apple she was defiled by a sex act with the serpent and two children were born Cain and Abel one's a murderer the other one has a revelation to bring the right sacrifice God receives Abel's sacrifice because God revealed to Abel that it was going to need to be a lamb of blood that would need to give life in order to redeem life see God was expressing the whole Plan of Redemption right back there in the Book of Genesis everything was being expressed right there Eve was a type of the church she was going to fall just like this church today you've got all kinds of denominational churches but they've rejected the word of God they they'll tell you that we believe God but then you when you tell them simple little things like baptism in jesus' name or you know Trinity and you try to explain to them that there's only one God the Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the New Testament there's no three Gods God is not going to there's amateur Gods which are the sons and daughters of God the attributes of God but it's all God expressing himself and this is the fellowship that's why there's Fellowship in the body of Christ and so here now listen to Revelations 4 10-11 the four and 20 Elders fell down before him does it say them but I thought there was three no him that sat on the throne and worshiped him it doesn't say them nowhere does it ever say them that liveth forever and ever and cast crowns Before the Throne saying thou Art Worthy oh Lord it doesn't say Lords Lord Jesus Christ Lord father Jesus Son Christ the Holy Ghost but all three are the same person his name was Jesus on Earth amen that's just a name remember you know names okay words there's so much more to words we have to go beyond the words we got to go into the logos the mind the thought that was in the word that's what that's where we awaken thou oh Lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou has created all things does it say some things all things when Jesus rose from the dead in Matthew 28:19 he come before the disciples he was in his theophany body he took he he moved into his theophany again just like under the order of of mzc we're going to be looking at all that next week but look he comes and he stands there before them and he says all power read it go back and read it Matthew 28 19 all power did he say some power he said all a l has been given unto me in heaven and on Earth is there any other power is there any other Lord no he said all power has been given unto me now go into all the world and this is where you know they take they they took the the trinitarian doctrine and the baptism in the name of the father and of the son because he goes now go ye into all the word world baptizing them in the name read it of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost and Peter was right there who they claim was the first pope which he wasn't he was right there when when Jesus said those words and you go read ma Acts 2:38 where where they went to Peter and the disciples after they were ministering and filled with the Holy Ghost preaching to the people and said what must we do to be saved Peter read it said repent every one of you turn away from your your your your Traditions your doctrines what you thought was the truth repent that's what repent means and be baptized in the name name of Jesus Christ that's what he said and 3,000 people were baptized go to Acts 19 you'll hear it again and they were he asked them how are you baptized he's asking them clearly he says I can see that you're disciples and you you're praising the Lord Jesus and everything else just like you can go into churches and they'll be in there saying hallelujah praise the Lord and you go to them you say how are you baptized now you don't want to be doing that in a way like you know you're trying to show something because this is revealed this is something that God God calls God calls so all you want to do is you want to Fellowship you want to talk about the word of God we we can't convince people you try to convince somebody to come into this church I'll guarantee you another person will convince them out yeah okay you got to let them come by their own free moral agency let the Holy Spirit speak to them by the word of God faith cometh by hearing God chose the foolishness of preaching to call his sons and daughters so that they could receive the word and come to their position in Christ amen we don't want to convince nobody but you you you you you just let them know how are you baptized and they'll tell you they they don't even know a lot of people oh I got baptized at the church you know do you remember how the minister baptized you because if the minister doesn't have a revelation to impart faith faith cometh by hearing the word and if he's got a revelation and he's baptizing you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ under a revelation of God than that anointing God is obligated by his word he says repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's God's promise that's not your promise you can't make that promise that's God's promise God calls God uh he that's why when when when the disciples were there and the people were leaving him because remember it was only a few that recognized who he actually was and they turned around said Lord how come they're all leaving how come they're going he turned around says unto you it has been given and I'll I'll just I'll elaborate on that unto you I gave the Revelation the logos the thinking the mind the thought what I meant and what I what I what I wanted to you to to see is what I revealed unto youall but he says but unto them read it it has not been given he says my sheep hear my voice and they won't follow any other once you've heard his voice and I'm not talking about my voice I'm not talking about some preacher's voice I'm talking about that voice on the inside of the inside that you know that my God this is truth I cannot deny this you you you you just realize it's it's absolute truth like I'm seeing it I can't help it that's why Jesus said when I give you that Revelation don't worry he says the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against it nobody will take it out of you because that'll be me in you on that day you shall know that I am in the father ye in me and I in you Christ in you your hope of glory your hope of Salvation it's Christ in you knowing that you've come into a relationship hallelujah praise God we're almost we're almost there so what is it it's Christ it's god let's go to the next scripture we're going to finish up off with just a few scriptures here to show you the deity of God and how God was going to operate and how he did it through Christ how he's the same yesterday today and forever and how he's going to do it through you and me everything that he did when he came here on Earth as Jesus Christ he was the second Adam remember three things got to be restored from the Garden of Eden because the original plan was Adam and Eve in the garden they were given dominion over over all the Earth go back and read it whatever Adam named it that's what it was why because he had the book he had the Revelation he had the whole plan he had the whole Mind Of God he was God expressed and he could name anything he could tell the tree to move from here and go to there he he was eternal there there was no death God said the day you eat thereof that day you shall surely die and when she went and made love with that serpent the Veil was lifted off of them because she went back and and and Adam knowing the Plan of Redemption knowing that what his wife had just done knowing that that that because she did that death had to there was going to be death because the word said the day you eat thereof you shall surely die he knew that so he says I got to give myself and that's why he gave himself with her he took on her sin like Jesus Christ when he went to the cross and he took our sin on him so that he could redeem Eve amen and Eve now was was was being redeemed and now Christ knowing what he was doing he became sin so that we could become him right but notice what they did read the scriptures they went hid themselves because they knew they were naked why does eating an apple make somebody aware that they're naked if that's the case we need to go into all the bars where the women are dressing with nothing and hand out Apples because they need to wake up they're naked but the Bible said that it that in the last days in the time of leod DEA they would be naked wretched miserable blind and don't know it but but that's not their fault they need the word and if you are the word to them then they got an opportunity to wake up out of their Amnesia of who they thought they were and come into a recognition of who they really are they're Sons or Daughters of God expressing the word amen praise God hallelujah amen glory let's go to the next scripture here in John 1 1:4 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things that were made listen all things that were made by him all things were made by him and without him was nothing anything was not anything made that was ever made now is there another Creator God Alone in him was life and the life was the light of men and listen in John 1:10 he says he was in the world and the world was made by him who's who they talking about Jesus Christ and the world knew him not glory for there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the word and the Holy Ghost and these three are one H this book is becoming more real and more real as we move along here Hebrews let the musicians come we just got a couple more scriptures in the book of Hebrews he says here um now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the what the worlds I don't know how many worlds have been in the past there may have been other civilizations and I believe there was a lot of people say oh you talk about the Bible you're so you're so shortterm minded no I'm talking about the Plan of Redemption for this world right now there is no other plan you want to go back before this world and you want to try to figure out what God did before this world go ahead but that's already done what's concerned what's concerning you now is what you need to come into context with amen through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear you cannot fathom God God is his own interpreter he will bring things to pass in his time and in his season next scripture Ephesians unto me who am less than the least of all the saints is this Grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of Christ what are the unsearchable riches of Christ the things that we've been fellowshipping on here this morning the hidden mysteries of God's word and guess who the hidden Myster are you coming into manifestation recognizing your position the world is looking for Mysteries yet one is standing right there in front of them when you're testifying of the word of God and you're telling them God has sent his word and I believe the word and the word is now living in me manifesting through me listen he says and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery this is what we this is what we're feasting on this morning morning which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in Christ it's always been in Christ and that's why the book has to be open and that's what we're going to be looking at next week he says who created All Things by Jesus Christ amen praise God Colossians 1:12 to20 but before I go there I want to read a quote here brother Braham speaking he says and I stood there a little bit till the Holy Spirit revealed it I said the entire Bible as much as being revealed to man through justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism in jesus' name and all these things has being revealed but there is secrets that's hid inside because the Bible is sealed with Seven Seals and that's why that you got to read the book of Revelation you got to see Revelation 10 1-7 you've got to recognize that God sent another messenger in the in the full restoration of the word by the name of William Branham you need to see his placing in the word of God so that you can see that through that Ministry Christ himself came down put one foot on the land one on the sea to open those seals to open the Mysteries that were in the book because the Bible said in Revelations 1:10 he stood there and he had a book open it was an open book that the mighty Angel stood there so that book contains things that we need to understand because in there is our placing in the word of God so that we can fulfill our part so that this world can go on to the next stage after the Rapture is fulfilled so he says here the Bible is sealed with Seven Seals I must go there to find it that morning who when those seven angels come down and blasted the Earth and rocks flew Every Way Seven Angels stood there and said Return to Jeffersonville from where you come from for the Seven Seals of the seven Mysteries will be opened and we thank God that the book has been opened he in Christ the mystery he has shown or revealed it in every type that it's in the Bible therefore the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ H he says the entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible and all the acts of the Believers in the Bible has been a type in type expressing what God great goal is and now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it and God's help well you'll see it right here this morning what the Lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it praise God hallelujah we are being expressed we are the word being expressed God is is is revealing himself through a people again glory to God Amen and we'll read this last scripture and we'll close giving thanks unto the Father which hath made us meat to be partakers of an inheritance of the Saints in light who hath delivered us from the power of Darkness this is our whole life this is everything from Genesis to Revelation and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have Redemption through the blood through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature Jesus Christ was the image of the invisible God and when you receive the word you start to take on the image the bride the the female part of Jesus Christ you start to take on the very image of Eve that was not deceived the one that would not be deceived the one that would not accept the doctrines of man the one that would not accept the trinitarian doctrine the one that would get properly baptized the one that would that would hear the word and and be willing to submit to the word of God hallelujah you become the invisible image the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible ible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him don't try to make this about anybody else it's all about his plan amen and he is before all things and by him by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence he wants preeminence in your life this morning he wants he wants to have total preeminence in your life so that you will surrender unto him amen glory to God for it pleased the father who's the father the self-existent one the one who planned it all the one that's expressing all of this that in him see it was all in him should all the fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross which was our way back from Earth to Eternity to reconcile all things unto himself himself it's all going back to the mind of God to the Elohim into that existence into that place that he's gone to prepare for us it's another dimension just like this one you're going to have bodies just like the ones you have now but they're going to be beond off any bodies they will not be governed by time anymore you will have eternal bodies just like the ones we're going to look at all of that next week that for by him I say whether they be things in Earth or things in heaven he's covered it all is there anything else Hallelujah give me a key for his word is working mightily in me Glory hallelujah thank you Jesus I love his word amen amen praise God go to the next slide uh he says here and John looked around and he wept because there was no man even worthy to look on the book and especially open the seals to reveal what the Hidden Mysteries was the Mysteries was in the Seven Seals and when these Seven Seals was open that opened up the entire Bible the whole book was open
