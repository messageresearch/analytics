========================================
okay without further Ado may we please read our scriptures um it's first Peter 5:8 first John 4:4 [Music] when okay it says that be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walk about seeking he made devour and then first John 4:4 ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world let's pray our gracious Eternal God you are you are the Fanon of life and The Giver of all good things father we so grateful we so thankful that you made a way for us to be here tonight father you saw it before the foundations of the world the people that you chose you selected you made a way to be here Lord I pray God that you bless every individual here Lord may you help me get myself out of the way Lord you help me to see something to bless your people may you help them to receive it oh God open their heart and my heart my mouth father to say the right way father I pray oh God In The Name of Jesus in the contrary spirit that try to raise his head up cast it out in the name of Jesus be B in the contrary Spirit may the great Holy Ghost have his free cause and set your children free in the name of Jesus for whom the Son of God has set free is free indeed Hallelujah please be seated my topic tonight is greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world I first got this thought in one of our prayers meetings I think the last one Chris was there just God played my heart to just speak a little bit more about here so my topic here is greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world Amen Hallelujah and as a son or daughter of God you have to know that God lives inside of you amen but at the same time Jus we have an enemy that we fighting every day and that enemy is a devil he has his own tatus trying to F the joy of the Believers so if a true Christian like a boxer when any boxer goes into a ring he knows his big point and whilst before even fight the best boxers they try to get a sparing partners that fight the same way as their enemy so when they get the ring before they get there they have studied and fight with that um sparing partner so that they know how to knock that um their opponent out so is every Christian you got to know the devices and the ways of the devil I'm not saying that spend all your time to stud the devil spend more time spend more time in the presence of God and let God be inside of you but at the same cling don't have to be ignorant of the devices of the enemy so that when he rises up you'll be able to him off from the sin and if you check when God first called me in Montreal there was one brother white brother that I met he told me to listen to this greatest battle ever forth and it's a very good message so listening to it most of the time and I remember one time brother to was speaking and said that that message is so good that he listened to it like once in every six months so once in a while just go back and listen to that and every time I get something new from it it blesses my so there's so much nugget in that greatest battle ever forth and said there that I don't have the quot here I think that I just there there are two fores is the devil and God Amen God is a real God it's a living God God is a person yes that when he the Holy Ghost comes it means that first personal Pro now God is a person the devil is also a person so as a true Christian always going to face this people but the greatest battle that ever fought is in your mind that's when the Battle Ground take place and the tactics of the enemy is to cause the human race to disbelieve God's word right and God also put his faith in the human heart so that you will believe human heart so you have a choice you have a free moral agency to allow God's word to be in your heart and have that faith in God's word to defeat the enemy every time or you have a choice to accept the devil's lie because remember a lie always contains about 99% truth and then he just m one little way that's what he did to deceive e in the G of he gave 99% and Mer just not that shall not that's why the whole human race is in chaos because the devil dece a Woman by just adding one little way and that has always been the same that's why the Bible said that a woman is a we vessel and being that we vessel the enemy goes that Channel all the time so he said that I suffered a woman not to preach or to ass authority over the man for for the woman being deceived fall in transgression why God knows that they have that weakness part in them so he said that they should not preach the word I'm not preaching the sisters now but I'm just um expressing my point am okay so so with that said in mind if your man every true mature man that is married you have to always be on the leg because the enemy in the Garden of Eden he went to eeve the weig vessel and you as a Christian the devil knows that you are saved that one you can't do nothing about your salvation you going to heaven no no doubt but what he does is that if he wants to get the man could not get you he go to the big vessel to try to cause to tries to bring chaos at home and if he doesn't get the woman he goes and their children and then the the husband and the wife their mind always toring on their children because what he's always have those devices so you have to wake up and recognize that it's not your wife it's not your children is the enemy try to cause so you have to go on your knees and cast him out from them because the Lord Jesus Christ cast out the devil in the name of in my name you shall cast out Devils so we have the power in the name of Jesus tonight cast out Devils from your mind from your from every part because you got a power you got power in Jesus name you got power in Jesus got power in Jesus to get everything Jesus Christ is all powerful God he's the greatest of the devil every day all what him if you don't power Hees have any power so why you give him power spend your time on chist on the word of God and have that power of God in you and you run the Bible said I resist the devil he he will flee from you so chance don't give any opportunity you have all the right you know your you protect all your weak PR say in the presence of God he can do you anything you are more than a conqueror through him who conquer the Lord and Jesus Christ he's still coming for you he hasn't changed hallelu God is good isn't it he's more than able Hallelujah and the guide of eating Hallelujah there are two things that happen sorry on calary there are two things that happen first of all the Lord Jesus Christ strip off when he was crucified he strip up all the power of the devil he is powerless he was wounded that Beast was wounded once and for all so he has no power what he does is that your power that you have when he comes and put those thoughts and doubts in your mind because the greatest B ever F say that you have you have five senses your body which is you contact by your C taste hearing and smelling those five senses and then in the soul has another five senses that is your conscious memory reasons affections and that stuff but then the spirit has only one source it's either Faith or without so God put his faith in that in that Spirit and the Devil comes and put what unbelief in there so that's where the battle goes on so you have the power to resist the devil and just stand on the word of God no matter what it comes because you always going to use your memory and he W tell you the right that you have done you only go all com and tell you your past mes but God comes and tells you your past victories so you have to dwell on the past Victory you hear from God two voices it depends on the one you more to one more to have more control so don't listen to that voice that is not Victorious voice always listen to that Victorious voice when you listen to that Victorious voice you remember become like Samson because when Samson was in when Samson eyes was all gone and there was no hope anywhere when in that Darkest Hour of his of his life he began to think on the V that he T and said where is that V where can't I have that anymore and then he repented and made things right when he make things right have the victory more than his entire life because he was able to defeat the Philistines more than every fight he has ever fight why he REM the victories and made things right so what I'm saying tonight that remember the good times with your lord Jesus Christ think on those good things with God those things that edifies those things that blesses your soul Johnson lik it why should I praise God he been so good to me for blessing one by you see what the Lord has done for God has done so much for we have to thank him and praise him every day because he so good to me he so good to you he's a wonderful God he never lost a battle just thank you every day every morning because you are victorious in Christ Jesus amen hallelujah Cal the other thing that happened was so great I was so good was God himself gave up his Spirit he gave up The Ghost and on the day of Pentecost he divided himself and came on the 120 people and multiply himself and from that time his Spirit has become available and he lives in you he lives in me that's why is greater is he that is in you amen amen am amen hallelujah that he that is in the world Amen because he is he lives inside of you the God of all creation he made himself available so that he lives inside of you and when he lives inside of you then you'll be able to do exact same thing he did when he was on this Earth because him living in you anyways and when he was he was able to tell the wind to be quiet when there was a storm on that boat he said the wind calm down and calm down why because greater is he that was in him than a wind that was giv the disciples trouble because the creator of the wind was in the Lord Jesus Christ so when he tell that wind to stop it C down there's any R in your life you have the authority to tell that R to go and is he that in the Lord Jesus Christ Lazarus who have been D 4 days and S when he said laus come forth that was more than a Manus has to come forth and what come back to life because greater is he in the Lord Jesus Christ than that thinking death and that same God is here you said oh brother Phil that was God himself yes but remember when someone like Moses when he has a battle when God promised Israel to move them from Egypt to Palestine he gave them promise after 400 years I will bring you out what was a mighty end when that time came Moses came on the scene he led them from Egypt going to promised land and and they have their first crisis there was Red Sea in front of them behind them was that Egyptian me pharaoh and his group and there was no way out I don't know he said anyone here tonight that have a situation that you can't see your way forward you can't see your way back you have a resting situation in your in your life right now I don't there anyone with any rest situation just believe that that same God who was greater than Moses on on on the he said speak and come forth and Moses said Grace his Ro and that calm down and God Cal the situation down and they were able to walk in that sea Hallelujah greater is SE that was Moses than so anyone situation that you can't go your way remember that same God that [Music] wases to stand that [Music] tonight in Jesus God is here he has changed he's a con he's the same God still conquering Hallelujah amen hallelujah God is good is am praise God hallelujah I feel good over here because I'm serving a living God he hasn't changed and after the death of Moses Joshua who was faithful to his servant Moses he also have a condition he has a situation that he fa he has a battle to go through and when the battle started he needed the son and Joshua who needed a son to stand still told the son to stand still And that son obey Joshua why because greater is he that was in josua the when he spoke that has to stand still the moon has stand still Moon don't come stand stand still because I need the victory they still they obey Joshua why because greater is he that was in josua than the son that same God is here with us greater is he that was in David than the philis that he met that g because both David has had a victory in his life before and one thing that Believers have to always remember that David never forgot David remembered that the same God that gave him victory over the B and over the lion is more than able to give him victory over that uncircumcised Philistine why because the children of Israel Joshua and all the rest they know that God is good God they know God is more than able to deliver them from the hands of the enemy but when go was standing there knowing only that God can could do it they never have the revelation of the word it wasn't revealed to them that they can defeat that go but it was revealed to him and that revation was able to defeat go and Revelation is the most important thing that every believer needs it's what the devil hates but the children of God loves it because God reveal to you you have that Authority you have the power has no CL what is going on with you because God has revealed it to you and re and because of Revelation that's why Abel was able to offer an excellent sacrifice but it was revealed to Abel what he has of what requirement that God and God testify of his gift so without Revelation you can't pleas God Amen that without faith no one can please Jesus am and you need is what the church needs all the time more than anything else because the Gate of Hell cannot Prevail against Revelation that reation is a victory so when that Revelation anything you have need of when it's fully revealed to you nothing can stand for you you be more than a conquerer no wonder when the bride recogniz who she is she will be an invisible Army you really recognize that the god that created the whole world lives inside his heart and greater is he that is in you that he that is in the world Amen Hallelujah God is good isn't it amen amen hallelujah greater is he that was in the Hebrew children when they have a situation and everything was going wrong one thing I like about those Hebrew children they believe God they trust God and I encourage the Believers it doesn't matter what situation that you are in we believe that God is more than able to deliver you from there's nothing that God canot do he can do all there's nothing that God cannot do but those Hebrew children said we know and we believe how God is more than able to deliver it but even if you chose not to we still not going to bow down to this not going to bow down to the to that situation so what I'm saying is that no matter what condition you are in God is more than able to deliver you there is nothing that God cannot do [Music] chose best for at the right time you turn everything around at the right time all things work together for good God in his own time he will make all things beautiful he's God isn't it is so great Hallelujah so what I'm saying tonight is that greater is he that is in you than every situation anyone of is facing tonight you pH I got problems I got days with my children I got days with my M like this that remember there is no situation God canot solve is he that is in you tonight that every just let that s inside of you because the god that created the whole universe he is inside of you and greater is he that's in you than every situation that you face today I remember when I have my first my second daughter Grace when she was born the doctor said that she can't hear and it bring H in her home but I pray and trust God and greater is he that was in me that that year that he said cannot hear God came on the scene pray and we trusted God the next time everything was fine tonen report listen to the true report because greater is he that is in you than any report that those doctors will tell you amen trust God his report is the best he has change amen h hallelujah thank you Lord amen God is good isn't it aen Hallelujah God is so great I love God with all my heart and one other thing to of believe us because the devil tried to distract us of our past mistakes you know there's no even a believer canot even sin right you only make mistakes and one thing that sometime people forget there is no such as a small sin or a big sin every Sin is Sin only God's period but sometimes have a white [Music] that's white what I'm trying to say is that when you did that white L you did something mistake that was little tiny in your eyes you went to God and God what forgave you because you thought something small you still ask when the Holy Ghost is in you it will convin you of every little that you do is that right so you ask God and he G you Deliverance but at the same token when you make a big mistake that God for I don't know what kind of to express it here but whatever mistake that you do in future or in the past that in the eyes of people think is so big Sometimes some preachers do some nobody want to talk to them everybody kind get away from them but if God could forgive you for that small thing then he can forgive you for the big one too the same God the same Fai that you have for that little small you got have that same faith for the big that people in yourself free from it because there's no such as a big or small remember have the same situation when he lied that white Li I'm not and the wife the TA situation he said I'm no you can call that as a small thing a white thing that God held him responsible so the little fores that SPO the V so every little thing counts so if God can forgive you for the small thing he's more than able to forgive you when by mistake by by by mistake you fall in a big situation or even by mistake in the past if you have done something that so big forgive yourself don't let that hold to you because God forgive you he from [Music] all bless I not imp who iniquity is also forg yes so you've been totally forgiv and your in the your sins are in God forgetfulness he doesn't remember it anymore so don't look back to your past yes the same thing apply to Healing so many of us when have a he you can trust to he to heal us from the headache you have a stomach and trust God for it you have can trust God for it what I'm encouraging you tonight you don't need any different fi from getting a healing from your headache than when you get a cancer the same fa if you could trust God to heal you from he when eny attack you with any sickness doesn't matter how much big that sickness is have that same faith and trust God that he can from the he can from every [Music] sickness Hallelujah so he cast everything out in Jesus name so every sickness come from bre of hell am heavy cancer whatever it all so you have a revelation for the Deliverance of your hold that same reation for [Music] deliver Hallelujah deliv you change amen hallelujah it go on to abundance he said that ask abundantly so that your joy may become full that's for your natural is amen what is it to God to bless $1 bless million to $100 can give to you the same fa that you have when you don't have food on the table that God provided when were bad stand on that same fa for better things for greater things so that your joy may become full so that you can support the work of God you only have good intentions but you have good you can be able to act on it use that finan support his kingdom because the purpose you want to be rich to support God's kingdom and this abundance God AB so that your joyu become so everything you have of he's able to give you to abundantly amen he hasn't changed amen he's the same yesterday today and forever God of abundance to give you more what you even think of imag that is what he was above all I wishper even Prosper that Prosper for it Hallelujah life of the devil if God can bless you with something can do it again AC Hallelujah is there in the Lord said how I'm going to drink a little water from Ocean you got exhaust God goodness amen so you can trust him little things trusting for big things that's why I'm saying tonight God is more than able am amen hallelujah and I think I just have my last Point God wants I go go and the last point I want to say is that this wicked devil the enemy one of his main Tes one of his devices is to call cause the Believers to distract you he causes distractions that's right I'm not saying that TV is wrong you need to have the T have the balance and was I was going to bring here that's I have this here thisone here when I first came to this country 1995 until 978 only people have and they give it to me my job side but now it's too everybody Village in Africa way they all the grand grand they all have it they start with a good thing but the enemy has been so um has used it and slowly slowly distracting Believers with it you have to wake up even myself I get up in the morning I have um place that I go for like maybe to read some scriptures after I read my Bible some of the once I go to gole to try to find it you see they bring so many news they bring so many sports you right away to read your Bible you don't think your mind just your eyes just goes on those things I have to literally push it aside and go and read my scriptures what I'm trying to say that he's using it as a distraction so you have to know how to use it and when to use it because if he can only distract you he know he can weaken you right so he uses this I'm not saying this bad with the Facebook with the WhatsApp with this and people sending every you go to people even having a dinner they still testing going to a meeting they still testing Adam send some and every time he getting out of hand and the devil is using it without even the people being aware why is he using that because he knew that a Believer will have time quiet time with God spend time with the Lord Jesus Christ they will be what hot potatoes he can't do nothing with you uses those things to distract to what take away your time your precious time that could be used to be of service to the Lord Jesus Christ he's stealing it slowly slowly slowly without you even being aware but God if you want to be able to be a hot potato to be in the presence of God every time in your life so that when you get in this situation either it is bad or good you still going to be able to thank God you have 10 million your account have Z in your account say praise God you got to spend time with your you got to go back to the T you have to listen to those T he said after long gone get into your cool place and listen to those voices have time with the Lord sister read your Bible pray every day don't let the devil steal your joy because he knows that the importance of the believer being in the presence of the king amen if being who just cast everything out and be in the presence you going to be what victorious in Christ so that's one of the P that the enemy is using in the last day to kind of take your joy I'm going to read this go God keeps his word Miss yourself together and have Union revivals get preachers who stays with God's word and not scatter about read the word some of you don't read the word once a week you ought to read chapter after chapter every day meditate if you get your head out of them old magazines and things you are reading and out of this old so many papers and so called religious lit that Ed to never be on the market that's just as bad as reading some of other magazines stuff that is false Doctrine and all kinds of dogmas and basing upon the truth why do can based upon some experience Doctrine is based on God's word not on experience people can have experiences everything so what I'm trying to say is that the T of the enemy is to distract the Believers so we have to spend time with the maker you have to wake up spend time read your Bible pray every seek God face so that you can be have a Victorious life every day in your life Hallelujah amen thank you Lord amen so without further Ado I think I'll bring the service to end and one thing I leave to everyone here is I remember greater is he that is in you he in the worldend your make [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah
