[0:00] [Music]
[0:14] good morning friends
[0:16] it's good to be here again in the house
[0:20] of the lord on this beautiful
[0:24] sunday morning
[0:27] we shall read out of the book of
[0:30] joel chapter 2
[0:35] reading verses 17
[0:39] and 18. it reads thus
[0:43] let the priests and the ministers of the
[0:47] lord
[0:48] weep between the porch
[0:52] and the altar and
[0:55] let them say spare thy
[0:58] people o lord
[1:02] and give not thine heritage to reproach
[1:06] that the heathen should rule over them
[1:10] wherefore should they say among the
[1:13] people
[1:15] where is their god
[1:18] then will the lord be jealous for his
[1:21] land
[1:23] and pity his people
[1:28] gracious father we thank you
[1:31] for the reading of thy word
[1:34] and as we continue
[1:37] to minister this gospel
[1:41] made the holy spirit anoint
[1:44] the words of our lips
[1:47] and the thoughts upon our hearts
[1:51] that while we speak your word
[1:54] may your word enter
[1:57] into the hearts and minds of thy people
[2:01] who are listening watching everywhere
[2:05] and may you receive all the glory and
[2:07] the honor and the praise
[2:09] for be asking in the name of jesus
[2:11] christ
[2:13] amen and amen now
[2:16] last sunday
[2:19] we ended speaking about the elders
[2:24] how that when the temple
[2:28] was being restored
[2:31] and they had laid the foundations
[2:34] thereof
[2:36] how that the younger
[2:39] generation of that day and time
[2:42] they rejoiced they were happy
[2:46] for at least the foundations were
[2:49] being laid and since they did not
[2:53] have the opportunity of seeing or
[2:56] experiencing the presence of god
[2:59] as it was in the former house
[3:03] they rejoiced at what they saw
[3:08] thinking that that was
[3:11] uh equivalent to the original
[3:15] however the old
[3:18] men or ancient men as the bible says
[3:21] that were there
[3:24] the bible says that they began to weep
[3:27] they began to cry in the presence of god
[3:32] because they knew about the glory of
[3:37] that latter house
[3:39] and what it was like and that it was
[3:42] cheating as solomon's shields
[3:46] were cheated from gold to brass
[3:50] so was the value
[3:54] of their worship in the house of god
[3:58] at that particular time and
[4:02] they recognized it for they were allowed
[4:06] by god to taste of both
[4:10] times or both
[4:13] so they could bear witness to the fact
[4:17] that then that the word of god that they
[4:20] had received
[4:22] in the temple was cheapened
[4:26] in the presence of almighty god
[4:29] and that is what i want to continue to
[4:32] speak upon
[4:34] the cheapening of the gospel message
[4:39] the cheapening of this message of this
[4:42] hour the standards and the quality of it
[4:47] going down instead
[4:50] of the people taking a hold of the word
[4:54] of god
[4:56] and growing closer to him
[4:59] in knowledge of him and
[5:02] walking in the light of his word
[5:05] they are beginning to accept anything
[5:09] that sounds like the word
[5:13] or like the message
[5:16] of this day and time
[5:19] now we realize then that the
[5:22] ships are are are have been anchored too
[5:26] close to the shore they're anchored too
[5:30] close to the shore
[5:31] where they who are on those ships
[5:35] in those churches following such leaders
[5:38] can easily take one or two steps back
[5:42] and they're back into the world or
[5:45] they'll take one or two steps this way
[5:47] and they are back in the church so they
[5:50] can go
[5:51] back and forth and have that
[5:54] kind of an experience in the world
[5:58] and in the church at the same time
[6:02] and that's all because they have
[6:04] anchored their
[6:06] gospel ships near to the
[6:09] shores of the world and its
[6:12] things and its pleasures and the things
[6:15] that
[6:16] are of the world they are in shallow
[6:19] waters and this goes for ministers
[6:22] it goes also for believers
[6:26] from pulpit to pew we see this
[6:29] everywhere my friends god wants
[6:33] man of god that will tremble in his
[6:36] presence
[6:38] that will tremble at his word
[6:42] man that will commit their entire beings
[6:46] and their entire lives to him and to
[6:50] him alone my friends
[6:54] in the iron which we live
[6:57] man of god preaching the word of god the
[7:00] way
[7:01] god says it in his word it will
[7:04] more have a sinning out of the crowd
[7:08] effect rather than a building up
[7:13] multitudes pouring in crowds
[7:16] being drawn in to the house of god
[7:20] oh my friends you can always
[7:24] have a crowd with these shallow
[7:28] methods of the world these
[7:32] techniques and tactics
[7:35] of the world are being
[7:38] utilized more and more
[7:42] by ministers who claim to be
[7:45] the servants of the living god
[7:48] so we are seeing the crowds
[7:52] building up the churches growing larger
[7:56] and larger but with real
[7:59] sons and daughters of god there's a
[8:02] sitting out
[8:03] amen oh they feel there
[8:07] be that find it and there's few
[8:10] my friends that will walk this straight
[8:14] and
[8:14] narrow way according to this promise
[8:17] and this word that's been given to us
[8:20] in this day and in this hour honestly
[8:24] speaking
[8:26] two ministers who were
[8:29] friends of each other the one
[8:32] passing by came to visit his friend
[8:37] and said oh i heard you had this
[8:41] marvelous uh revival meeting
[8:45] and i'm sure that you must have had
[8:48] a lot of additions and you must have had
[8:52] a
[8:52] lot of people being added to your church
[8:56] and his friend answered him and said i'm
[8:59] sorry
[9:01] but instead of additions i've had uh
[9:04] some blessed subtractions
[9:07] uh what do you mean i mean
[9:10] god cut out those
[9:13] that are of the world of the flesh and
[9:16] of the devil
[9:17] and that were distractions and
[9:20] god has added only to the church
[9:24] such as should be saved my friends
[9:28] i believe that is what we need today
[9:31] for the church is in a sifting time
[9:34] the church is on the threshing floor of
[9:37] the holy spirit
[9:39] where god's holy spirit is trashing the
[9:43] floor
[9:43] and checking upon his people to see they
[9:47] are that they are where he wants them
[9:51] to be most of the time in the
[9:54] in the building up of a building
[9:57] there is usually first a tear down and
[10:00] then a building up
[10:02] let me repeat in a building up of a
[10:05] new building there is usually a tear
[10:08] down
[10:09] before there is a building up i believe
[10:12] that it's the same thing in the house of
[10:15] god and in the presence of god
[10:17] there must be a first a tearing down a
[10:20] humbling
[10:21] a repentance of brokenness a softening
[10:25] by the spirit of god in the presence of
[10:27] almighty god
[10:28] before we can come to a place where a
[10:31] proper
[10:32] god-given foundation led by the holy
[10:35] spirit himself
[10:37] can be given to us in this way
[10:40] in this hour in which we are living
[10:44] but what do we see we look out to the
[10:47] churches
[10:48] yonder and we see the churches growing
[10:52] and expanding we see thousands being
[10:56] added
[10:57] we see the religious arrogance
[11:01] we see the religious pride
[11:05] and in this message we are seeing a lot
[11:08] of
[11:08] bright pride based on
[11:11] how many numbers do you have and
[11:15] how many numbers
[11:18] are you growing what's happening
[11:21] with your church not realizing
[11:25] god's plan and purpose is not
[11:28] based upon those numbers of man
[11:32] but god's is based upon
[11:35] the fullness of his word the quality
[11:39] and the maturity and the ripeness of
[11:42] those saints
[11:43] that have surrendered and committed
[11:46] themselves
[11:47] to the lord and savior jesus christ
[11:50] so we find we end up having a house full
[11:54] or a church full of members
[11:58] members that are drawn by a lot of the
[12:01] religious
[12:02] psychology that's being preached as
[12:05] the word of god for our day
[12:08] of how to live better
[12:13] how to have happiness
[12:16] how to hold on to your joy
[12:20] how to your relationships
[12:24] how that could be one uh
[12:27] full of happiness
[12:30] yes and preaching these types of
[12:34] of psychology religious psychology
[12:39] tends to call out
[12:42] to the needs and desires hurts
[12:47] and to the hearts of people that are in
[12:50] the word and it appeals to them and
[12:53] they're drawn
[12:54] by that they're drawn by that not
[12:57] realizing
[12:58] that that's not what god desires for
[13:01] them
[13:02] that they're not to be chickens they're
[13:05] not to be
[13:06] feeding on some meal
[13:10] given to them by a man-made
[13:13] idea or a man-made theory something
[13:16] that's just
[13:17] cheap in the presence of almighty god
[13:21] just like chickens takes them six weeks
[13:24] to have another set of chickens take six
[13:28] weeks
[13:28] to get another multitude of members
[13:31] six weeks to have those chickens and if
[13:35] you notice chickens love to say
[13:37] cheap cheap cheap cheap because they're
[13:40] nothing but
[13:41] chickens and all they can do is be
[13:44] cheap with whatever they offer in the
[13:48] presence and in the house of the living
[13:51] god
[13:52] god wants people who are willing to
[13:54] repent
[13:55] people who are willing to pay the full
[13:58] price
[13:59] for there is a price for a true
[14:01] pentecost
[14:02] there is a price to be a true genuine
[14:06] original seed of the living god
[14:09] hallelujah god wants a people that will
[14:12] love him that will love his word that
[14:16] will love one another that will
[14:19] walk in the promised word for this day
[14:22] and for this hour oh friends
[14:25] don't you see it in your bible
[14:29] how when jesus came to a city
[14:32] and he would weep over that city and cry
[14:35] over that city
[14:36] because of the wickedness and the
[14:38] worldiness that he would see
[14:40] in it we are to also oversee
[14:44] and whip over our cities that our
[14:47] churches are in that our people
[14:50] are being raised in the presence of god
[14:52] in
[14:53] the people should be crying out to god
[14:56] and calling upon his name but his divine
[15:00] presence will come and confirm his word
[15:04] for he has said in his word if my
[15:07] people which are called by my name
[15:10] will cry will humble themselves in the
[15:13] presence of
[15:14] god then god will hear from heaven and
[15:17] he
[15:17] will heal their land god
[15:20] wants men that will cry out to him
[15:24] may god help us as preachers
[15:28] that will cry out and ask
[15:31] god to bless his people god wants
[15:35] man that will tremble at his word
[15:38] man that will tremble in his divine
[15:41] presence
[15:43] man that will tremble as they wait in
[15:46] the
[15:46] quietness and the stillness in the all
[15:50] of the presence of almighty god that man
[15:53] like that
[15:54] will learn to tremble in the presence of
[15:56] god
[15:57] and when those men learn to tremble and
[16:00] press god's presence
[16:01] then the people will tremble at their
[16:04] word because the anointing of the jew of
[16:06] the anointing of the presence of god
[16:09] will rest upon them in every
[16:12] possible way as it did upon isaiah
[16:16] in isaiah chapter 6 isaiah tells
[16:20] of his experience when the bible tells
[16:24] how that in the year that king josiah
[16:27] died
[16:28] isaiah saw the lord in the year that his
[16:32] good friend
[16:33] whom he so admired whom he's all looked
[16:35] up to
[16:36] that person that your eyes are so filled
[16:39] with them
[16:40] with admiration for them
[16:43] when that person is taken away moved out
[16:47] of the way
[16:47] by sickness by affliction by
[16:51] death so that you can see god and god
[16:54] alone
[16:56] as uzziah was filling up isaiah's sight
[17:00] and so isaiah could not see the lord
[17:03] because
[17:04] josiah stood between him and the lord
[17:07] so god had to move josiah away
[17:10] so that in the year that king josiah
[17:13] died
[17:14] isaiah saw the lord how did he see the
[17:17] lord he had a
[17:18] vision of the lord he saw the lord high
[17:21] and lifted up
[17:22] his train filled the entire temple and
[17:25] how did the
[17:26] angel with their wings one
[17:29] going this way one going that way oh
[17:33] my and crying out in the presence of god
[17:36] humbling themselves in the presence of
[17:38] god
[17:39] if these supernatural beings were
[17:42] humbling themselves
[17:43] isaiah saw that he should be humble
[17:47] in the presence of god and he humbled
[17:50] themselves
[17:50] and say oh lord god i am unworthy
[17:54] i am unworthy my words are unworthy my
[17:58] thoughts are unworthy my ways are
[18:00] unworthy
[18:01] oh god help me and he cried out to
[18:05] god and the angel of god took a
[18:08] a coal of fire an ember
[18:11] that was upon the altar of god and flew
[18:15] with that and placed it upon his town
[18:19] that he might have the fire of god upon
[18:22] his
[18:22] soul oh my friend welded the song right
[18:26] and said
[18:27] when the crawl of fire touched the
[18:30] prophet
[18:32] making him as pure as pure can be
[18:37] then the voice of god said who go for us
[18:42] then the answer there lord hear
[18:45] am i send me
[18:48] speak my lord speak my lord
[18:53] speak and i will do answer lord send me
[18:58] speak my lord speak my lord
[19:03] speak and i will answer lord
[19:07] send me oh man
[19:11] so many preachers no
[19:14] so many believers hear the
[19:17] call of god's voice today and may the
[19:20] fire of god rest upon you
[19:24] wherever you are across the world may
[19:27] the fair
[19:28] god reach you and rest upon your
[19:31] soul as you catch a true vision
[19:34] of the lord jesus christ and like
[19:38] isaiah will be able to say i have seen
[19:41] the king
[19:42] the lord of hosts when a man a woman of
[19:46] god a child of god can say
[19:49] i have seen the king not the preacher
[19:52] seen the king not your mother seeing the
[19:54] king
[19:54] not your father seeing the king but
[19:56] you've caught a vision of jesus
[19:59] you've seen a vision of the lord you've
[20:02] got your
[20:02] own private personal vision of
[20:06] him your personal relationship with him
[20:09] and you are drawn closer and closer
[20:12] to him praise god forevermore
[20:15] then god will use you and anoint you
[20:18] in a special way i want to bring an
[20:21] observation at this time
[20:23] that there is a difference between an
[20:26] anointed ministry
[20:27] and just that gifted ministry
[20:31] for one can have gifts
[20:34] but those gifts have been with the
[20:37] individual
[20:39] from the day that they were born
[20:43] they didn't have to repent for those
[20:45] gifts to be in their lives
[20:47] they didn't have to do anything their
[20:50] gifts were there by god
[20:53] allowing them to be there for
[20:56] gifts and callings of god
[21:00] are given without repentance
[21:04] and so these gifts being in some people
[21:08] some will use it in the world become a
[21:10] psychic
[21:11] become someone out there that foretells
[21:15] things a witch or or a wizard because
[21:18] it's a gift of god placed in the
[21:21] person's life
[21:22] but was perverted by satan and being
[21:26] used by satan you see but because
[21:29] it is a gift of god but when that
[21:32] genuine
[21:33] gift of god comes under the preeminence
[21:37] and the control of the holy spirit
[21:41] god uses that gift for his glory
[21:44] and for his honor to bring the attention
[21:48] of the people to himself
[21:51] that they might see jesus only
[21:55] that when they look through the word
[21:58] they will
[21:58] see the lord jesus only
[22:01] praise god forevermore but instead
[22:06] we find great numbers of these
[22:09] so-called man of god out there
[22:13] so-called preachers preaching in the
[22:16] name of the lord
[22:18] living in the shallows instead of living
[22:21] in the deep
[22:23] and there they have a ministry
[22:26] that will razzle and dazzle men
[22:29] and women and draw them to themselves
[22:33] until the men and women seize them
[22:36] but that is not the anointing of the
[22:39] holy spirit
[22:40] that is not the genuine thing that god
[22:43] wants brother sister
[22:45] he wants you to surrender to him so that
[22:48] even if such a
[22:49] gift be in your life that he will have
[22:52] the control
[22:54] over it and use it for his glory
[22:58] oh how i'm so hungry
[23:01] i'm hungry to see anointed ministry
[23:04] anointed by the living god
[23:07] ministry that produces repentance
[23:11] that reproduces change
[23:14] by god's power to transform
[23:18] ministry that produces genuine
[23:22] heartfelt repentance that will produce
[23:26] real holy ghost births
[23:29] genuine births of the living god
[23:33] that one where somebody is crying out to
[23:37] god
[23:37] while wiping the paint from off their
[23:40] face or the mascara from off their eyes
[23:43] oh lord but one where men and women will
[23:47] come in the prince of god asking him
[23:50] truly
[23:51] for his mercy and his love god
[23:54] wants preachers whose lives and ministry
[23:58] will produce
[23:59] genuine heartfelt repentance
[24:02] not for one day but for an eternity
[24:06] lies transformed by the power of god
[24:09] preachers who have genuinely seen the
[24:13] king
[24:13] they have caught the vision of the lord
[24:16] of hosts
[24:17] and it brings them in the presence of
[24:20] god
[24:20] and they know what sin is they
[24:23] know what worldliness is when a man
[24:27] was being in the presence of god like
[24:29] that and he comes out
[24:32] he comes out with something resting upon
[24:35] him
[24:36] something eternal something supernatural
[24:40] resting upon his life my friends that
[24:43] will
[24:44] bring the people closer to god
[24:46] hallelujah
[24:48] may we pray that god will give us
[24:51] men of god like that may we pray
[24:54] to god for a fresh outpouring of his
[24:57] holy spirit
[24:58] upon his church in this end time
[25:01] as we are fixing and preparing ourselves
[25:05] for the arrival of our lord for the
[25:07] arrival of our bridegroom
[25:10] for him to come and catch us away as a
[25:13] thief in the
[25:14] night and carry his waiting bride home
[25:17] let us pray to god that god will
[25:20] bless our churches that god will bless
[25:23] our homes that god will bless us to have
[25:27] softened heart humble lives humble in
[25:30] his
[25:30] presence amen we don't want our lives to
[25:34] be dried
[25:35] up with light we're filled with thorns
[25:38] and
[25:38] twistles and and tears but we want our
[25:42] lives
[25:42] filled with the good seed of the land
[25:45] and
[25:45] watered by the latter and former rains
[25:48] so may we ask god to sin upon us
[25:52] in this hour both the first rain
[25:55] and the latter rain the teaching rain
[25:58] oh and the harvest rain upon the church
[26:02] of
[26:02] god in this last day let us pray to
[26:05] god that god will grant us a real
[26:09] heart warming heart searching revival
[26:13] within our souls
[26:14] that we will come out of our our sleep
[26:17] and our our mystery of the christianity
[26:21] you claim to be
[26:22] in that the holy spirit will draw your
[26:25] soul
[26:25] out to him for he said if i be
[26:28] lifted up i'll draw all men unto myself
[26:32] may he magnetize you by the power of his
[26:36] word
[26:36] and may he draw you unto himself
[26:39] that you might have a deeper work of god
[26:43] take place in your life a deeper walk
[26:46] with god walking him walking by his
[26:49] side and doing his will and may he
[26:52] keep us broken melted softened
[26:56] and producing true fruits of the spirit
[26:59] of the living god within our lives
[27:02] oh what a r that we we're living in
[27:05] france
[27:07] for when i look around what do i see
[27:11] i see there's building going on all
[27:13] around the country
[27:16] buildings going up everywhere
[27:19] even in the neighborhood not
[27:23] far away from where we are
[27:26] we see homes being built
[27:30] jammed together cheaply built yes sir
[27:35] many houses being put up like that
[27:38] cheap materials cheap clothing
[27:42] cheap covering everywhere
[27:46] they're made to seem so beautiful
[27:50] giving it curb appeal but no lasting
[27:53] beauty
[27:54] god wants a christian that would have a
[27:57] beauty that will
[27:58] last for all eternity a
[28:02] beauty that comes from christ and christ
[28:05] alone
[28:06] not a man made beauty slammed together
[28:10] by man that try to put up that
[28:13] spiritual house of god as quickly
[28:16] as they can and move on to another
[28:20] many churches are that way they are
[28:23] not built upon a solid god
[28:26] set foundation not built upon god's true
[28:30] foundation
[28:31] many are built upon man materials
[28:35] man-made doctrines and man-made
[28:38] thoughts of what they think the god's
[28:42] word
[28:42] says when the word of god speak to us
[28:46] in every possible uh way
[28:49] i believe it's time for us to clean up
[28:52] the house my friends
[28:53] judgment begins in the house of god from
[28:56] the
[28:56] janitor from the from the pulpits right
[29:00] down to the pews
[29:01] we ought to be cleaning up house and get
[29:04] people
[29:04] back into a supernatural contact with
[29:08] god again until they know him
[29:11] in the power of his resurrection oh
[29:14] praise god that they may be truly born
[29:17] again
[29:18] by the genuine coming promise
[29:22] by of the holy spirit to indwell
[29:26] their lives forever and forever
[29:29] and that they will not stand for deacons
[29:34] married four or five times
[29:38] men of god claim to be ministers
[29:43] married one two three times
[29:47] changing wives in every way
[29:51] they'll do that what a shame
[29:55] that god's church has come to a place
[30:00] like that amongst those that
[30:03] call themselves pentecostals
[30:07] and amongst even those that claim
[30:10] and call themselves that they are of the
[30:14] true word of god the message
[30:18] of the hour and instead of living the
[30:21] way
[30:22] god wants him to live they allow
[30:25] worldly glamour to begin to creep in the
[30:28] church
[30:30] they allow sin to crouch
[30:33] at the door and carry on
[30:37] call themselves saints and people
[30:40] of god so we see a lot of cheap
[30:44] impersonations
[30:46] now taking place and going on
[30:50] within the house of god
[30:54] we see back in the bible days
[30:59] when pharaoh said oh moses
[31:02] so you are doing miracles we'll do
[31:04] miracles too he called for his wise man
[31:08] and his wise men conjured up
[31:11] also signs and wonders
[31:15] just as moses did but god
[31:18] wanted to show what the original was
[31:23] moses is serpents
[31:27] it swallowed theirs
[31:30] up together and even so in the ministry
[31:35] that god used of that prophet
[31:39] and god is using in this day by
[31:42] anointed men of god those
[31:46] so-called gifts out there in the church
[31:49] world
[31:50] in the church realm all
[31:53] will be swallowed up by the anointed
[31:57] gifts
[31:58] but the anointed ministry gifts
[32:02] used by god himself in this day
[32:05] and in this hour of the holy spirit
[32:09] now women of course are always a type
[32:13] of the true church of the living god
[32:17] [Music]
[32:19] and as the women have made themselves
[32:21] cheap in today's world
[32:24] the church has made herself cheap also
[32:28] in the church world in which
[32:32] we live living in they have degraded
[32:35] themselves
[32:37] women have brought their value down they
[32:41] have devalued
[32:42] themselves they've lost respect
[32:46] amongst men anymore it's not
[32:50] there anymore they become
[32:54] like jezebel in the bible
[32:58] domineering dominating
[33:01] controlling with arms like the bands of
[33:05] iron
[33:06] like vines that will strangle
[33:10] a man and control him completely
[33:14] until he is either lost this manhood
[33:18] or he has half a man like ahab
[33:22] was in the bible has to ask his wife
[33:26] everything
[33:28] has to let his wife represent him
[33:32] uh let his wife do all the purchases
[33:37] acting like a king talking like a king
[33:40] but was
[33:41] nowhere in the real personality of a
[33:45] king
[33:45] and there he was the shallow shell
[33:49] of a man acting as if
[33:53] he was a real man when he was
[33:56] nothing but a shadow and a shame
[33:59] of making himself i was saying my words
[34:02] he was an imitation of a man and we have
[34:06] a lot of imitations
[34:08] of men today instead of real
[34:11] men where their women can hardly
[34:15] find real man that will stand by them
[34:20] and a man can hardly find real women
[34:24] that will be real women that would
[34:27] cheaten
[34:28] would degrade their standards their
[34:30] principles
[34:31] their oh praise god for
[34:34] women like that that will stand to the
[34:37] word of god
[34:38] and will stand with the principles of
[34:40] this
[34:41] bible that we have that man that will
[34:44] live by the
[34:45] word of god until the crown they
[34:49] gain in the presence of the living god
[34:52] god is still searching and looking for
[34:55] men
[34:56] men who will live by his word
[35:01] god is looking for man that has
[35:04] real genuine god-given
[35:08] character character not an outward
[35:12] show but a real character given
[35:16] by god god wants to see
[35:19] man and the people of this world
[35:23] wants to see genuine display
[35:26] of manhood produced by
[35:30] the word of god
[35:33] sheep they're cheap though
[35:36] you look up there and all you could see
[35:38] is the devalued
[35:40] degraded and cheating condition
[35:44] of men and women
[35:47] of the world and even to the
[35:50] quality of those who claim to be
[35:53] christians
[35:54] all devalued from the original
[35:57] value of what god and how
[36:00] god made a christian is supposed to be
[36:05] a cheap christian you have seen those
[36:09] very expensive and those priceless
[36:14] reproductions in the various museums
[36:17] you have seen the original paintings
[36:21] and and the sculptures of the
[36:24] genuine original artist
[36:27] and you go out in the street and you see
[36:30] cheap reproductions of that selling
[36:34] for cheap cheap cheap even so
[36:37] you see in the church world they look
[36:40] back in the bible at those original
[36:44] god-sent prophets patriots
[36:47] men and women of god darkest and
[36:50] sarah and and mary and
[36:53] genuine women of god and man of god that
[36:57] stand the
[36:58] test of time that like stephen and james
[37:02] and
[37:02] peter and paul and barnabas that will
[37:05] stand by the word of god hallelujah
[37:09] oh my and people are s no matter their
[37:12] life no matter their ma
[37:14] they still will love to see
[37:17] men and women that will live by that
[37:20] word of god
[37:21] today in the middle of babylon
[37:24] they live according to the word of god
[37:28] my friends we see
[37:31] in this hour of people that have become
[37:35] wishy-washy
[37:37] a people that have become so soft
[37:41] a people that will put their name on the
[37:44] church book
[37:46] a people that will do a little volunteer
[37:48] work
[37:49] in the church jump up and down
[37:53] shake themselves in the presence of god
[37:57] and in the church
[37:58] and call that christianity called
[38:01] that feeling that they get that that's
[38:04] what makes them a christian
[38:08] they believe that that is what makes
[38:10] them a
[38:11] son of god but god wants real christian
[38:15] real rugged not some hot house tomato
[38:19] that the moment will preach the word of
[38:21] god and begin to straighten the lines
[38:24] out
[38:24] they don't want the heat of the son
[38:28] of god to come upon them and to write
[38:31] them in the hour of this this
[38:34] summer hour this harvest time that we
[38:37] are
[38:38] in when the grain should be written they
[38:40] don't want their lives
[38:42] to be written by the word of god
[38:46] that we are we are here in this present
[38:48] world
[38:49] oh praise god when that kind of a spirit
[38:53] of almighty god
[38:54] strikes the true believer it's like a
[38:56] burning crawl of fire
[38:58] like the ember that came from off of the
[39:01] altar
[39:02] and rested upon isaiah's town
[39:05] that same oh ember affair of god
[39:09] resting upon your town upon your heart
[39:13] my
[39:13] friends that burning flame of fire
[39:16] it'll set your soul of fire and keep you
[39:20] my friends until the very end of
[39:23] time and right into eternity and will
[39:27] cause you to want to make converts
[39:30] to jesus christ amen but luck
[39:35] if you are in some church
[39:39] you claim to be a christian you
[39:42] claim to be walking with god then
[39:45] one day the word test will come
[39:49] god's word is going to put you to a test
[39:53] it may even be putting you to a test by
[39:56] your
[39:56] enduring listening to this
[39:59] message here today amen
[40:02] because for you to listen to this today
[40:05] there must be something in you
[40:07] that will keep you listening to the word
[40:11] of god
[40:12] for the easiest thing for you to do is
[40:14] to turn off your
[40:15] your set or to walk away from it or to
[40:18] stop your
[40:18] ears and not listen to what you're
[40:20] hearing but if you're a real
[40:22] son a daughter a child of god the great
[40:26] holy spirit of god says
[40:28] the deed will crawl to the deep and the
[40:30] deep will respond
[40:32] and you'll listen to the word of god as
[40:34] it comes to you
[40:36] in this day and in this hour so you see
[40:41] christianity genuine christianity
[40:45] is not an easy thing for when
[40:50] joshua and caleb
[40:53] went over into the promised land
[40:56] they found they had to face amalekites
[41:00] jebusites midianites they had to face
[41:04] animal rights all kinds of these ungodly
[41:08] paganistic nations that were
[41:11] right in the same land that there were
[41:14] to dwell in
[41:15] and many times you go into the church
[41:18] and
[41:18] right in the church you'll find a lot of
[41:20] these pagan
[41:22] ungodly spirits anointing
[41:26] men and women who are disguised
[41:29] under the disguise of christianity
[41:32] having that cloak
[41:33] upon them but the spirit that's moving
[41:36] them is not of god
[41:37] but is of the devil and causing them to
[41:40] do ungodly things
[41:42] and cause men and women to faith is this
[41:45] christianity
[41:46] if if this is christianity i want
[41:49] nothing to do with it but they were
[41:51] placed there by satan for that purpose
[41:53] to distract you to delay you
[41:57] to destroy you to rob you
[42:01] of the genuineness but if you keep your
[42:04] eyes
[42:04] you're going to see genuine sons and
[42:07] daughters of god
[42:08] and be able to live by the word of god
[42:13] and so joshua and caleb
[42:17] as they were in that land when they came
[42:19] back with their report
[42:21] they heard their friends telling moses
[42:26] oh there were terrible people over there
[42:29] those people are are terrible they are
[42:31] like giants
[42:33] and we are like grasshoppers we don't
[42:35] know how we'll be able to
[42:37] withstand the things of the world they
[42:40] have
[42:41] such wonderful great cities out there
[42:44] but they're giants to us like that
[42:48] but there were two men standing there
[42:51] joshua and caleb that were standing by
[42:54] the word
[42:55] and they were not moved by the things
[42:59] that were in the world
[43:00] or the things that were happening around
[43:03] them for their
[43:04] eyes were on the word of god
[43:07] and so they turned around they said wait
[43:10] a minute wait a minute
[43:11] were we looking at the same thing were
[43:14] we looking at the same bible
[43:15] were we looking at the same torah were
[43:18] we looking at the same word
[43:20] were we looking at the same evidence
[43:23] that we are seeing out there
[43:24] and you seem to be seeing and saying
[43:28] that they are they are giants
[43:32] and we are the grasshoppers well we
[43:35] looked at them and when we
[43:37] saw them they look like grasshoppers to
[43:40] us
[43:40] and we appeared to us that we are the
[43:43] giants
[43:44] amen and you know when that
[43:48] belief that fate that sought on
[43:51] originating within their hearts they
[43:54] were able
[43:55] to drive the enemy out of the land
[43:58] and to tear down the walls that were
[44:01] there
[44:02] amongst the people of god oh friends
[44:05] just imagine the first original
[44:08] church of the living god that we had and
[44:12] let us compare ourselves
[44:14] of christianity of today with the
[44:17] christians of the original church as we
[44:21] see here in the word of the living god
[44:25] i believe what we are producing is
[44:28] nothing but a
[44:29] cheap reproduction of the gospel
[44:32] amen and amen the real
[44:36] church of god that first church had
[44:38] rugged believers
[44:40] that did not run from persecution did
[44:43] not
[44:43] run from hunga did not run from fear
[44:47] and doubt or anything like that but they
[44:50] stood by the word of god
[44:52] and gave up their lives if it cost them
[44:55] their lives
[44:56] they were not ashamed of the gospel for
[44:59] the gospel
[45:00] of god was given to them amen praise
[45:04] god yes sir oh hallelujah
[45:07] one of them that was just
[45:11] claimed to be a deacon and yet the bible
[45:15] says
[45:15] philip lifted up his eyes and when he
[45:17] looked he saw the
[45:19] lord high and lifted up amen amen
[45:23] they stared as stone stephen but he
[45:26] stood against sin
[45:28] they stoned him but he stood up against
[45:31] sin
[45:33] oh hallelujah oh praise god
[45:36] and gave his full testimony that i
[45:39] see jesus standing up
[45:42] standing up to welcome stephen home
[45:45] standing up
[45:46] to say i'm standing in identification
[45:50] along with you and he gave up him in a
[45:52] ghost saying
[45:54] lord lend not this evil this sin
[45:57] to their charge we don't desire any
[46:01] hybrid
[46:02] reproduction of christianity today
[46:05] but we want a genuine christian produced
[46:08] by the original scene
[46:10] out of the genuine god sent
[46:13] heaven sent word of god for this day and
[46:16] for this
[46:17] hour amen praise god hallelujah
[46:21] countless countless thousands of dollars
[46:25] that people would give for a masterpiece
[46:28] of michelangelo oh my
[46:32] but one will take just a few dollars
[46:36] to pick up a reproduction that they have
[46:39] of the very thing that michelangelo
[46:42] did oh praise god hallelujah amen
[46:46] but let's shoot for the original
[46:49] let us walk away from that which is
[46:52] nothing but a
[46:53] reproduction where it can only
[46:57] be cheap cheap cheap cheap
[47:00] cheap cheap and desiring the things of
[47:03] the world of worms of the world
[47:05] and the things of this earth instead our
[47:08] eyes should be
[47:09] fixed upon jesus and jesus alone
[47:12] oh glory to god hallelujah be real
[47:16] genuine men and women of god like joshua
[47:19] like caleb like david when he saw
[47:23] lion he did not run but he said you
[47:26] unwashed on godly felstein
[47:30] raise up yourself against the armies of
[47:32] the living god
[47:34] and claim that you'll come against men
[47:36] and women who have been anointed with
[47:38] the revelation of this hour
[47:39] they were anointed with the word for god
[47:42] for this day
[47:43] how dare you challenge the church of the
[47:45] living god
[47:46] and so david took up one of the
[47:49] revelations that he had
[47:51] one rock revelation and placed that
[47:54] within the sling of the word of god
[47:58] hallelujah the gift god had given to him
[48:01] and he swung that revelation
[48:04] and struck it out and hit
[48:07] goliath right into the intellectuals
[48:11] hit him in the forehead and down he
[48:14] came to the ground and down with any
[48:18] so-called church fall
[48:20] down will any theologian fall
[48:23] down will any man-made teaching fall
[48:27] at the strike of one of these
[48:30] god-sent heaven-sent revelations coming
[48:34] from the presence of almighty god fear
[48:36] not brothers and sisters
[48:38] don't back up don't back down press
[48:41] forward
[48:41] press on in the name of the lord jesus
[48:45] christ
[48:45] and destroy the armies of satan
[48:48] by the power of the hosts of heaven and
[48:51] by the word of god
[48:53] where are the genuine men and women of
[48:55] god today
[48:56] where are the sons and daughters of god
[48:58] today
[48:59] that will sound the charge sound the
[49:02] charge
[49:02] sound the trumpet of god and charge into
[49:05] the
[49:06] ranks of the enemy with the word of god
[49:09] one god one name one baptism
[49:12] one lord one one faith one birth
[49:16] amen and say i am resting upon that
[49:19] here i stand so help me god i can see no
[49:23] other
