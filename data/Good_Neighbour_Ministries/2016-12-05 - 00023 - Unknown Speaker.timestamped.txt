[3:21] [Music]
[3:34] the
[3:38] [Music]
[3:43] to
[3:44] no
[3:48] And we backgroundise.
[3:52] Praise the Lord. Once again, we have
[3:56] come to the Lord's house
[3:59] on the Lord's day
[4:02] to partake
[4:03] of the Lord's table.
[4:06] Not in by tradition,
[4:09] not in ignorance, but with a clear
[4:13] revelation
[4:15] of what this all means.
[4:17] [Music]
[4:19] The scriptures of course tell us what it
[4:22] is.
[4:24] Now, these uh two
[4:27] brothers are going to serve the Lord's
[4:29] supper.
[4:31] [Music]
[4:33] One will go forth on one side with the
[4:37] bread.
[4:39] Please hold on to it
[4:41] while the other is serving on the other
[4:44] side
[4:46] with the wine.
[4:49] And after both sides are finished, then
[4:51] the wine will come to you. And the ones
[4:54] who have no bread will also receive the
[4:57] bread.
[4:58] Once everybody has their portion,
[5:02] you hold it in your hands and then after
[5:05] which we will take it together. Is that
[5:09] right?
[5:11] Please do not take it before because
[5:14] Paul said what?
[5:16] Have you no houses? He says did you eat
[5:19] before you come?
[5:21] Right. So let's wait one on the other
[5:25] and take the Lord's supper
[5:27] together. Amen
[5:30] by the grace of God.
[5:34] After they've done that, we'll worship
[5:36] for a while
[5:38] and also we're going to stop a chance to
[5:41] pray.
[5:43] examine yourself
[5:46] and then after which we will greet each
[5:49] other
[5:51] in Christian love
[5:54] and then I it's on my heart to pray for
[5:58] Sarah Brandon today.
[6:02] So if you don't mind I'll pray for this
[6:05] one individual. So, I'm not forming a
[6:06] prayer line, but just this individual
[6:10] has been on my heart,
[6:13] and I'm going to anoint her with oil and
[6:16] pray for her.
[6:17] Yes.
[6:18] And when I'm doing it, I want you to
[6:21] agree with me.
[6:24] Right. Agree with me that God
[6:28] will completely heal and deliver this
[6:32] young woman to a full life.
[6:34] Amen. Amen.
[6:35] Hallelujah.
[6:36] Because God has promised to the world
[6:39] they shall lay hands on the sickness
[6:45] and the promises they shall recover.
[6:50] Hallelujah.
[6:51] We obey the word by laying on the hands.
[6:55] Amen. and we believe the recovery to
[6:58] him.
[7:00] But we believe that he said also where
[7:04] two or three are gathered together in my
[7:07] name and they pray and ask together for
[7:12] anything it shall be believing of course
[7:15] it shall be granted.
[7:17] Do you believe that?
[7:18] Amen.
[7:19] Do you believe there's power in prayer?
[7:21] Amen.
[7:21] Believe prayer changes things.
[7:23] Amen.
[7:24] Hallelujah. Your prayer can change you
[7:26] from sickness to health.
[7:27] Yes.
[7:28] Amen. From want to prosperity.
[7:32] Amen.
[7:32] Every blessing that's in your heart,
[7:35] there is power in prayer.
[7:37] Brother said, you know, if you know that
[7:40] prayer brings God's blessings down, then
[7:44] why don't you pray, pray, pray for
[7:46] prayer brings God's blessings down.
[7:48] Amen.
[7:49] Is that right? So let's bring down the
[7:52] blessing of God upon the Brennan family
[7:55] and especially upon this young woman.
[7:58] Hallelujah.
[7:59] Amen.
[8:00] In the name of Jesus Christ because we
[8:02] believe in a miracle working God.
[8:05] You have seen it in this church where
[8:08] women that were pronounced by the
[8:09] doctors to be barren for the rest of
[8:12] their lives have born children.
[8:15] Yes. You have seen those sitting, not
[8:18] all of you, but some of you that are
[8:19] here have seen people that were sitting
[8:21] in wheelchairs upon.
[8:24] Amen.
[8:25] And they're still running today.
[8:26] Yes.
[8:28] We mention it over and over because it's
[8:30] a testimony of a woman with her leg. The
[8:32] doctor give up the flesh eating disease,
[8:34] eat out half of it, and she's ready to
[8:37] go. No answer. And God stopped them in
[8:40] distress.
[8:41] Yes.
[8:41] Is that right?
[8:42] Amen.
[8:43] We've seen the hand of God. Amen. So we
[8:47] believe
[8:49] and if you can believe all things are
[8:51] possible
[8:52] to not believe
[8:54] in the simplicity of this sacred moment
[8:58] the great physician can do anything
[9:02] and anything can happen. I've told you
[9:05] before. I've been to services like this
[9:06] just talking like that and boom, all of
[9:09] a sudden man coughs up against why the
[9:12] cancer was scared of the revealed word.
[9:15] Is that right?
[9:16] Amen.
[9:16] Praise the Lord. And the same way in a
[9:20] service just talking on the word. I'm
[9:22] glad to be here. Not even preaching yet.
[9:25] I say I'm glad to be here. It's nice to
[9:27] be in the country and you know God is
[9:29] still the same yesterday. Boom. The Holy
[9:31] Ghost drops. Tongs break out. People
[9:33] fall on the ground, men run to the
[9:35] altar. Just like that. See, God is able
[9:38] to do it. Rain can come out of the sky
[9:41] just like that.
[9:43] Is that right?
[9:44] Only believe. All things are possible to
[9:48] them that believe. We don't have to work
[9:49] ourselves into it
[9:52] cuz the word the word is here.
[9:54] Amen.
[9:56] We believe God's word.
[10:03] Gracious heavenly father, bless the rest
[10:05] of this service. Breast of God's
[10:09] blessing.
[10:18] Oh, gracious eternal God. So grateful
[10:21] father, so thankful for making a way for
[10:24] us to give this love supper. Lord, we
[10:27] pray oh God that you bless the bread as
[10:29] a presentation that when we take it all
[10:32] that are sick will be healed. May the
[10:35] sick be healed, may everyone be blessed.
[10:38] We thank you and we pray in the name of
[10:40] our Lord Jesus Christ.
[10:43] And now we ask our brother Christopher
[10:47] from long
[10:49] to ask God's blessing upon the wine.
[10:53] And it's real wine. It's not grape
[10:56] juice. It's real wine. It represents the
[10:59] stimulating effects of the Holy Spirit,
[11:03] the new wine that is in our life.

[18:58] For I
[19:01] have received of the Lord,
[19:03] which also I delivered
[19:07] unto you,
[19:09] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[19:13] which he was betrayed,
[19:15] took bread,
[19:17] and when he had given thanks,
[19:20] he broke it and said, "Take, eat. This
[19:25] is my body which is broken for you. Do
[19:29] this in remembrance of me. Shall we all
[19:34] stand? Those of you who are partaking
[19:36] this is the bread.
[19:40] Take
[19:42] eat
[19:45] for this represents
[19:49] his body
[19:50] that was broken for you.
[19:53] away from the bridge.
[20:04] [Music]
[20:13] [Music]
[20:18] After the same manner also
[20:22] he took the cup
[20:25] and when he had sought saying
[20:30] this cup
[20:32] is the New Testament.
[20:36] In my love,
[20:39] our redemption
[20:42] was written in red.
[20:45] Yes.
[20:46] With the blood of Christ.
[20:47] Hallelujah.
[20:49] This do ye
[20:52] as often as you drink it.
[20:56] Why? In remembrance of me.
[21:00] For as often as you eat this bread
[21:03] and drink this cup, you do show the
[21:08] Lord's death till he come.
[21:12] Wow. On one hand it shows that he dies,
[21:16] but on the other hand it shows that he
[21:18] lives.
[21:19] Amen.
[21:19] And ever more.
[21:20] Hallelujah.
[21:21] And that he's coming again.
[21:23] Let us take the coin with the
[21:25] understanding and the revelation of this
[21:28] hour. God richly bless you. Take it
[21:30] together.
[21:32] We are one in Christ.
[21:42] Let us bow our heads and pray
[21:45] while I pray. Our gracious heavenly
[21:49] father
[21:51] on this sacred Sunday,
[21:57] we come to your table
[22:00] as guests
[22:02] who have been invited to come
[22:07] and we are not resting or trusting in
[22:10] our own worthiness
[22:13] but we trust in the worthiness
[22:16] of Jesus Christ.
[22:19] And as we look and as we have partaken
[22:22] of the emblems
[22:24] of our Lord's death, may we remember why
[22:30] he died that dark day on Calvary.
[22:35] That he died to cleanse us.
[22:37] He died to heal us.
[22:41] He died to satisfy your judgment and
[22:45] your righteousness. your justice
[22:49] and we remember his eternal love and the
[22:53] boundless grace of a God rich in mercy.
[22:59] May we receive the assurance
[23:02] that we are forgiven.
[23:04] Amen.
[23:05] And that we are the possessors and
[23:07] beneficiaries of eternal life.
[23:10] Hallelujah.
[23:11] And that now in us dwells the home of
[23:14] glory.
[23:14] Amen. Glory.
[23:16] As the bread and the cup nourishes our
[23:20] body, so may your spirit strengthen our
[23:23] soul
[23:24] until the day of your coming.
[23:27] When we will hunger no more.
[23:30] We will thirst no more.
[23:33] No more pain, no more sorrow, no more
[23:36] sickness. And we will sit with you at
[23:39] the heavenly table in the presence of
[23:42] our Lord saying hallelujah
[23:46] right now.

[31:06] Amen.
[31:06] Just like I told you, it's as simple as
[31:10] that.
[31:11] One time I was in a service just again
[31:16] talking about the Lord. But it's when
[31:17] you're talking with revelation, that's
[31:19] right.
[31:20] Uh you're not you don't have to be
[31:21] sculpting big deep stuff. It's because
[31:24] of what's in you. And the Holy Spirit
[31:27] fell like that. And to my surprise in
[31:30] this message, I thought the pastor would
[31:32] rejoice and he said, "Oh my God, I was
[31:35] so scared. I felt chills going up in my
[31:37] spine."
[31:39] He was in the message and he never heard
[31:41] speaking in tongues. Wow. Never saw the
[31:44] Holy Spirit fall like that
[31:47] out of a pure blue sky.
[31:50] Never really had the experience, but he
[31:52] was preaching.
[31:53] the message. We got to come back to the
[31:56] word.
[31:57] Amen.
[31:58] Listen, if this church is the true
[32:00] church,
[32:02] it has got to produce another book of
[32:04] Acts.
[32:05] Thank you, Jesus.
[32:07] And if the if the tree ever puts forth
[32:10] another genuine branch,
[32:13] [Music]
[32:15] it'll do the same works like the first
[32:17] one.
[32:17] Amen.
[32:18] Is that right?
[32:19] Should I preach what Paul preached?
[32:22] Amen.
[32:23] And Paul preached all of this.
[32:24] Yes.
[32:25] All in believe all things are possible.
[32:27] Could you get me a bottle of oil,
[32:30] brother? Somebody else
[32:37] in my office.
[32:42] Amen. You'll find one there. And I'm
[32:45] going to ask um
[32:48] a precious sister. She's here. She
[32:54] Praise the Lord. I do right under my
[32:57] eyes. Praise the Lord. If I was not sure
[33:00] of that, I would see. But that's what
[33:02] happened. We got to try in this life not
[33:04] to be too lifted up. That's right.
[33:06] Cuz then we don't see what we need to
[33:08] see. Amen.
[33:12] The great
[33:15] Let's sing. He was for our
[33:17] transgression.
[33:19] [Music]
[33:22] He was broken
[33:26] for our
[33:28] transgressions.
[33:30] Yes,
[33:33] he was
[33:39] [Music]
[33:44] surely
[33:49] [Music]
[33:53] and by his
[33:55] [Music]
[33:59] we
[34:01] The price for healing was paid
[34:05] for healing.
[34:09] I lost true
[34:15] again just
[34:17] [Music]
[34:23] [Music]
[34:30] perfect.
[34:35] Oh yeahior.
[34:42] Too late.
[34:45] Everybody
[34:48] [Music]
[34:55] might
[34:56] [Music]
[35:09] surely.
[35:11] He wants to
[35:18] [Music]
[35:22] see our
[35:27] father in the name of Jesus
[35:31] who died for our sins and rose again.
[35:34] Amen. Isaiah 53.
[35:38] He was woken up for our transgressions.
[35:42] He was bruised for our iniquities.
[35:46] The chastisement
[35:48] of our peace was upon him.
[35:52] And by his stripes,
[35:57] his suffering,
[35:59] he was made sick that we may be well.
[36:02] He bore pain that we may go free.
[36:06] He took all of this upon himself
[36:10] and according to his word by faith that
[36:15] the Holy Spirit lives in me and lives in
[36:17] this congregation.
[36:19] As we pray together,
[36:22] I lay my hands upon this precious
[36:24] sister. Make this gospel real to her.
[36:27] Amen.
[36:28] In a way that shall never forget it.
[36:30] Yes.
[36:32] Remember her in this hour. Yes.
[36:34] May the power of God, the presence of
[36:37] the Holy Spirit lead my body and by my
[36:41] hands being laid upon her, I transfer
[36:44] this anointing and this power from me to
[36:48] her
[36:50] into her being now from the crown of her
[36:53] head to the sole of her feet to cleanse
[36:57] the blood in her body
[36:59] to cast out every virus and every germ,
[37:02] every contamination Hallelujah.
[37:05] To heal every organ
[37:07] and to bring complete and total
[37:10] deliverance
[37:12] for the glory of almighty God that for
[37:16] years to come. Many will say, "I was
[37:18] there that day
[37:20] when our sister Sarah Bre
[37:23] was healed by the power of God. A
[37:26] miracle took place."
[37:28] And they'll talk about the miracle of
[37:30] Sarah Bre. Ladies
[37:33] might
[37:36] be
[37:40] my
[37:43] victory in your hand right now. Spirit
[37:46] of the living God, come upon her.
[37:49] Save her.
[37:50] Yes.
[37:51] Heal her.
[37:52] Yes.
[37:53] Make her whole.
[37:54] Let the doctors wonder and marvel.
[37:57] Amen.
[37:57] Let me serve a miracle working God.
[37:59] Amen.
[38:00] Amen. And amen. Father, a prayer anoint
[38:04] me to be able to dedicate her babies.
[38:08] Hallelujah.
[38:08] Hallelujah.
[38:10] In the name of Jesus.
[38:14] Receive me.
[38:17] Hallelujah.
[38:18] Amen.
[38:19] If Jesus himself was here,
[38:21] Amen.
[38:22] He couldn't do anything else.
[38:23] That's right.
[38:24] Because that's what he said in his word.
[38:26] Amen. Amen.
[38:28] You genuinely do believe that trust God
[38:32] and throughout her live a full and
[38:34] complete life for his glory.
[38:36] God bless you.
[38:40] [Applause]
[38:47] I know that there are other sick
[38:49] troubled and tribes within the
[38:51] congregation.
[38:53] I pray a general prayer.
[38:55] Yes. But in another service, I'd love to
[38:58] have a healing service where we lay
[39:01] hands and pray for all those
[39:06] who have sickness, troubles, trial. And
[39:11] while you're waiting, remember this.
[39:15] The trials only came to test you.
[39:17] That's right.
[39:18] The burdens didn't come to break you.
[39:20] Amen.
[39:21] But to mend you.
[39:22] Yes.
[39:23] Sometimes God brings these things to
[39:26] give us a new perspective.
[39:28] Amen.
[39:29] That we might have the chance at a new
[39:32] beginning.
[39:32] Yes.
[39:33] Amen.
[39:33] Is that right? You know, sometimes you
[39:35] got to start your Christianity all over
[39:38] again because you thought you had it,
[39:40] God, you knew it and then you found out
[39:42] you didn't have.
[39:43] Amen.
[39:43] So, we want to start all over again. God
[39:46] bless each one of you here today.
[39:48] Sisters downstairs for the washing of
[39:52] the saint's feet. Brothers upstairs for
[39:55] the washing of the saint's feet. Of
[39:58] course, we are doing it by the
[40:00] commandment of the Lord. And uh it has
[40:03] significance.
[40:05] I've said it through the years. I repeat
[40:07] it again.
[40:09] It's not something that the other church
[40:11] is just pushing aside. But there was a
[40:13] meaning to it that whether you are rich
[40:16] or you are poor.
[40:18] Amen.
[40:18] Whether you are high or you are low, the
[40:21] Lord's supper is meant to let us
[40:23] remember where he came from.
[40:26] Is that right?
[40:27] Amen.
[40:27] Cuz here is a rich man have to bend down
[40:29] and wash a poor man's feet.
[40:31] Amen.
[40:31] I'm not talking about the pope now.
[40:33] That's just a fact.
[40:35] Right. Uh but yes, because God is
[40:38] showing you got to stay humble.
[40:40] That's right.
[40:41] Right. And in the old Pentecostal days,
[40:43] they said be humble or you're going to
[40:45] stumble, right? You humble yourself and
[40:48] allow the Lord to make you humble.
[40:50] Doesn't matter if you have billions of
[40:53] dollars
[40:55] because uh blessings,
[40:58] money, power, influence.
[41:03] It brings a certain thing that if you
[41:05] don't watch it, it brings arrogance.
[41:07] Yes.
[41:08] Brings pride. It brings a sense of
[41:10] power, control,
[41:13] but that has got to be under the hand of
[41:16] God and the direction of the Holy Spirit
[41:20] with the character to be able to use it
[41:22] for his glory.
[41:23] So he he's given this Lord's supper and
[41:25] the washing of the saints feet to
[41:27] constantly remind us that we we are
[41:31] blessed to be a blessing and we are
[41:33] called to serve.
[41:35] Yes.
[41:35] Is that right? Amen.
[41:38] That's what it is about. Also,
[41:42] as believers together, we are to look
[41:45] out for each other and wash one
[41:48] another's feet. You see, back in those
[41:50] days,
[41:53] they um they would go to the Roman baths
[41:58] and they may even take a shower. to
[42:00] maybe take a good bath there
[42:04] which is a symbol of your washing away
[42:06] s. But then when they finish at the
[42:09] Roman bath, they got to walk home.
[42:11] Yes.
[42:11] We all got to walk and get to heaven. Is
[42:13] that right?
[42:14] And in walking home, they didn't have
[42:18] Cadillacs and and Tesla cars and Toyotas
[42:22] on the road.
[42:24] The mode of transportation was camels,
[42:28] donkeys,
[42:30] horses,
[42:34] and these horses and these donkeys and
[42:37] camels, they operated on what we know
[42:40] today as methane gas.
[42:43] [Music]
[42:46] In other words, they let out a lot of
[42:49] stuff on the streets.
[42:52] And back then we didn't have boots and
[42:54] they didn't have boots and covered shoes
[42:56] like we have. They wore sandals. Just
[42:58] cut a piece of skin, put two straps,
[43:00] tied it around your leg just to keep
[43:02] thrs from, you know, going to your leg.
[43:05] So as they would walk out on the dusty
[43:08] street, they just washed. They're clean.
[43:12] And now they're walking on the dusty
[43:13] street and they're talking to their
[43:15] friends, happily going home. And before
[43:17] you know it, they step right into a fire
[43:19] of dogma.
[43:24] They got to take their foot out now
[43:27] and go to their home. If they're
[43:29] wealthy, they have a push footwash
[43:32] blocky to wash their feet. And that's
[43:36] why Jesus took that role of taking the
[43:38] towel to show you that if he could
[43:41] humble himself to be a footwash donkey
[43:45] for all of us.
[43:46] Amen.
[43:47] Go you and do likewise.
[43:48] Yes.
[43:49] Is that right? Amen.
[43:50] Can you be a footwash donkey for him
[43:52] today?
[43:53] Amen.
[43:54] Amen. Can't you get to a place where,
[43:57] oh, I'm not washing her feet because of
[44:00] this that I know of or or she did this
[44:03] or he did that. I'm not going to wash
[44:05] his feet. Nobody's going to get me. You
[44:08] see, the Holy Spirit was not to so
[44:10] cleanse your heart.
[44:12] That's right.
[44:13] To a place where you are in a state of
[44:16] unconditional love.
[44:18] Is that right? Yes.
[44:19] I don't care who it is, but you love
[44:22] everybody.
[44:23] That's right.
[44:24] So, let's wash the saint's feet. And by
[44:26] doing that, what you're doing is our
[44:28] daytoday walk. We already saved. We
[44:30] already been washed. But you got to walk
[44:32] every day on this road going home to
[44:35] glory. From time to time, you may step
[44:38] into something nasty.
[44:41] [Music]
[44:43] And sometimes you can't even wash it
[44:45] yourself.
[44:48] You need a brother or a sister to
[44:51] encourage you, to help you say the right
[44:54] amen, and wash that thing off for you.
[44:57] Say, "Brother, you're free. Don't go
[45:00] around believing that you're condemned.
[45:01] You're free." Sometimes it takes a
[45:02] brother or sister to say that. Is that
[45:05] right? So, let's do that here today, one
[45:08] for the other. God bless you, sisters.
[45:10] I'm going to pray the closing prayer for
[45:12] the service so that when you go
[45:14] downstairs wash the saint's feet, you're
[45:17] free to go. Brothers, same ups here.
[45:21] Amen.
[45:23] Our gracious God and heavenly father, we
[45:26] thank you for this for your wonderful
[45:29] presence, Father, for visiting with us
[45:33] and making us feel alive.
[45:36] Thank you for the indwelling spirit.
[45:39] Bless each one here today. Quicken us
[45:42] more and more to thy word. Open up our
[45:45] understanding. Father, as we go to wash
[45:47] the saints feet, Father, remind us where
[45:50] you brought us from
[45:53] and show us where we could appear
[45:56] and make us a blessing one to the other
[45:59] in Jesus name.
[46:01] Amen. And amen. God bless you before you
[46:05] leave
[46:08] because next Sunday
[46:12] next Sunday will be our church Christmas
[46:17] dinner which we have every year but it
[46:20] will be next Sunday after the service.
[46:25] However, because they have a policy that
[46:27] at 5:00 p.m., no one can go into the
[46:31] building before 5:00 p.m.
[46:34] So, I would like to put the service
[46:38] instead of 11 to put it at 1
[46:45] Yes. I didn't
[46:46] Sunday school.
[46:47] Thank you, brother. I didn't really look
[46:49] at this. I just glanced down, but I
[46:51] didn't look at it. We spoke about it,
[46:53] but I'm just I like to be free so I'm
[46:57] just talking. Yeah. So at 1/3 there will
[47:00] be the service so that the service takes
[47:04] so many hours by then you're finished.
[47:07] There's just a small gap in there. Uh if
[47:10] you want to catch a Tim or something
[47:12] light before you get over there for
[47:15] 5:00,
[47:17] then uh that would be a lot better than
[47:21] you know the service ending real early
[47:23] and you got 5 hours or 4 hours in
[47:25] between and not knowing what to do.
[47:28] Okay. So, the service will start at 1:30
