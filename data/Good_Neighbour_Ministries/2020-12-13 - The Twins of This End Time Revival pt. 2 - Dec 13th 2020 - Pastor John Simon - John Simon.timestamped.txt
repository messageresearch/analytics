[33:21] may the family circle never be unbroken
[33:26] praise the lord god bless you please be
[33:28] seated my own dear
[33:30] precious sister just a few years older
[33:33] than i am
[33:35] decided that she will take her flight
[33:38] i i can't say well she decided maybe the
[33:41] lord is ready for her
[33:43] in new york city where she was a
[33:45] registered
[33:46] nurse for many years she grew up there
[33:50] from very young and
[33:52] studied there and practiced
[33:55] there and retired there and
[33:59] finally the lord decided to call her
[34:02] home
[34:03] and he left him in peace
[34:06] and went to be with the lord so we give
[34:09] him all the praise the honor
[34:11] and the glory amen
[34:14] you know i just had a brief moment of
[34:17] sadness
[34:19] because we have siblings but i
[34:22] i marveled even at myself well why i'm
[34:24] not
[34:25] you know really really really broken up
[34:30] and you know like that but and i said
[34:32] what's wrong with me boy am i
[34:34] but the fact is knowing that she's a
[34:37] believer
[34:38] was a a believer of this message
[34:42] for all those years in her heart with
[34:44] the lord
[34:45] i was at peace knowing that she was in
[34:49] the presence of the lord
[34:51] and that she was in a better state than
[34:54] we
[34:55] are because she's free from her prison
[34:59] of bars and
[35:00] of bars of bone and flesh and
[35:03] so on and in the presence of the lord
[35:06] giving him glory
[35:07] we are still here because we have to
[35:09] serve god's purpose
[35:11] and we cannot leave before we finish
[35:14] god's purpose
[35:15] whatever it is you got to finish that
[35:18] before he'll call you home
[35:20] so we give him the praise and the honor
[35:22] and the glory
[35:23] to be here in the house of the lord good
[35:25] to see every single one of you
[35:28] to those who are in the homes that are
[35:32] uh shut in and are watching
[35:35] this uh online broadcast may god richly
[35:39] bless you
[35:40] everyone and uh other letters receiving
[35:44] emails you know
[35:45] various uh groups churches organizations
[35:50] around the world india africa are
[35:53] are emailing me and wanting to come
[35:56] under
[35:57] our covering as they call it our
[35:59] leadership
[36:00] uh so uh if it was of uh
[36:04] that was god's plan then we would be
[36:07] head of several groups around the world
[36:12] but that is not really what god has
[36:15] planned
[36:16] uh my business is just to get the
[36:18] message
[36:19] out and to get the word
[36:22] out and if their elected seat it'll
[36:25] strike
[36:26] that tuning fork within their soul it'll
[36:30] strike
[36:30] something within them and they'll
[36:32] recognize this is different
[36:35] uh this is something that's going not to
[36:37] your flesh
[36:38] uh you know it's not going to your
[36:41] spirit
[36:42] just to make you feel good uh or
[36:44] whatever but it's going right to the
[36:47] soul
[36:47] to bring forth a transforming eternal
[36:51] change amen by the power of god so
[36:55] we give him all the glory for it and i
[36:58] am
[36:58] thrilled beyond measure praise god just
[37:02] to stand
[37:02] here to be able to bring the word of god
[37:05] to you
[37:07] it's a real blessing uh for me to know
[37:10] that
[37:10] praise god and see believers
[37:14] uh their faith in the word
[37:17] walking in line with the word
[37:20] following the word and of come to the
[37:24] place where they're doing it
[37:26] not just because the pastor says so the
[37:30] deacon says so
[37:32] the trustee says so mother says so
[37:35] but they're doing it because they seen
[37:38] something
[37:38] in this world it's caught the attention
[37:43] of the bride class of saints
[37:47] it is caught her eyes and she can't keep
[37:50] her eyes off of isaac
[37:53] she can't keep her heart away from
[37:55] joseph
[37:56] the spirit of the living god is now
[38:00] calling his sheep he is calling the
[38:03] bride is
[38:04] calling them by their name and they are
[38:07] hearing those that have to an ear to
[38:09] hear
[38:10] their hearing and they are just
[38:13] following praise the lord
[38:15] we can't even fully expound or explain
[38:18] put in english what it is we feel within
[38:21] our hearts
[38:22] but we know it's real and we're resting
[38:26] on that
[38:27] we trust and believe what god has sent
[38:31] his servant
[38:32] and prophet to bring the message of the
[38:35] word to us
[38:36] shall we read the scripture before we
[38:39] continue
[38:40] talking as we sense this presence of the
[38:43] holy
[38:44] spirit glory to god
[38:47] and may the presence of god and now the
[38:50] holy spirit go forth
[38:52] amen give the winds a mighty voice
[38:56] glory to god hallelujah genesis
[39:00] chapter 4 verse 12
[39:04] 1 and 2 i mean sorry and adam
[39:08] knew eve his wife
[39:11] and she conceived
[39:16] and bear came
[39:19] and said i've gotten a man from the lord
[39:23] and she again bare his brother
[39:26] abel a gracious god heavenly father
[39:31] we have read from the book
[39:35] and we pray that the great holy spirit
[39:39] will now speak to us for a while
[39:42] and lord thou who are the author of the
[39:46] book
[39:46] we pray you will reveal the book we pray
[39:49] you'll give us
[39:50] understanding give us wisdom
[39:53] and father may we receive it and may you
[39:57] receive
[39:57] all the glory honor and praise today for
[40:00] we ask it in jesus christ's name amen
[40:03] and amen god bless you
[40:07] in our last sermon
[40:10] we showed how that from the
[40:14] very beginning of the world
[40:18] that there were twins in
[40:21] the bible in the garden in the womb of
[40:25] eve
[40:26] typical of the church
[40:30] as such cain and abel of course you know
[40:33] the story of cain and abel
[40:36] and of course we recognize these
[40:39] twins were of prophetic significance
[40:44] and uh we find out that there were those
[40:47] twins
[40:47] in the beginning and
[40:50] there are twins now at the time of the
[40:54] end
[40:57] the prophet of this generation has said
[41:01] every revival produces twins
[41:06] amen if that principle
[41:09] remains the same and i believe it is
[41:13] then this revival
[41:16] brought about by his
[41:19] ministry that was stirred up
[41:23] across the world by this god-given
[41:27] ministry
[41:28] fulfilling malachi 4 5 revelation
[41:31] 10 7 making the word of god
[41:34] real to us then it must follow
[41:38] logically sensibly and scripturally
[41:42] that there are twins in this message
[41:47] there are the same twins with the same
[41:51] kinds of characteristics
[41:54] as it was in the garden of eden
[41:58] one of god one born a
[42:01] son of the devil one of truth and one of
[42:05] lies
[42:07] one both religious
[42:10] both wanting to worship god but one
[42:14] doing it by a system
[42:16] of a beaut of beauty a system
[42:20] my friend of of order and stylin
[42:24] and distinction while the other was just
[42:28] seemingly raw and uncooled and
[42:32] out of line and just grab a lamb and
[42:35] take a
[42:35] rock and beat the neck and and the blood
[42:39] flow out and spraying everywhere it
[42:42] seems like there's no
[42:43] order no kind of a
[42:46] gentleman-ness about him just a a
[42:50] country boys got preaching the bible and
[42:53] talking about revelation and bang and
[42:56] hit the lamb and the blood flowed out
[42:59] and
[43:00] oh god wouldn't accept that that's out
[43:02] of order that's not even appropriate
[43:04] it's not even proper
[43:06] it doesn't sound good it doesn't look
[43:08] good it's not photogenic enough it's not
[43:11] produced for tv and hollywood or
[43:14] anything like that
[43:15] all he's talking about and she's talking
[43:17] about is the word of god
[43:19] and the revelation of the word what
[43:21] revelation is that i
[43:23] i don't even know what he's talking
[43:24] about amen
[43:26] praise god hallelujah yes we can use the
[43:29] word revelation casually
[43:31] and you can use it in a deeper sense
[43:34] recognizing it because you have received
[43:37] it
[43:38] you are have open to it and you can see
[43:41] it for the glory of god so
[43:44] every revival produces twins
[43:47] in genesis 25 21 and 24
[43:52] we find that rebecca produced twins
[43:56] jacob and esau and the bible says they
[43:59] were fighting in the church
[44:01] there were at odds within the womb
[44:05] it looks like child's play
[44:08] you know it didn't look serious because
[44:11] it was just
[44:12] a baby type of play but
[44:15] later on we were going to see how that
[44:17] would ripen
[44:19] when it comes down to the harvest time
[44:22] now the birthright is prominently
[44:25] mentioned
[44:28] in the story of jacob and esau
[44:32] of course esau felt that
[44:36] he had the right to that work right
[44:41] just by the fact of entitlement
[44:45] he had to get it because he was the
[44:47] first son
[44:48] so he didn't have to fight for it he
[44:51] didn't have to strive for it
[44:52] he didn't have to do anything for it
[44:55] because he was going to get it by
[44:58] the right of those laws in that time
[45:01] of entitlement through the laws of work
[45:05] right
[45:06] so he just took it casually that it
[45:09] would automatically
[45:10] fall into his lap as we say it was fall
[45:14] into his lap that way and that's how he
[45:17] took it
[45:18] casually amen so we find out friends
[45:22] that because of that he began to despise
[45:26] the birthright
[45:28] he began to undervalue
[45:31] that but right and then after a while he
[45:34] was
[45:35] ashamed of the birthright my god
[45:39] hallelujah but on the other hand
[45:42] jacob because he knew in the first place
[45:47] it wasn't his right to get it he knew he
[45:49] had to fight for it
[45:51] he knew he had to it doesn't matter what
[45:54] he suffered
[45:55] whether it's hunger what is shame
[45:58] whether his reproach
[45:59] what is mocking what is coughing what is
[46:02] name calling whatever price he
[46:06] had to pay he had to get have that word
[46:09] right
[46:11] amen type of the elected praise the lord
[46:14] hallelujah oh my praise god
[46:18] and when we begin to see
[46:21] the application to our day and time
[46:25] that to every age there was
[46:29] a birthright promise or
[46:32] promise of a new birth
[46:36] through the medium of for instance
[46:39] looter the just shall live by faith
[46:42] that was the only way you could get the
[46:45] birthright promise fulfilled in your
[46:48] life
[46:49] is by being receiving believing
[46:53] and receiving the promise that god made
[46:57] manifest
[46:58] through luther at that time and so on
[47:01] through the messengers down to pentecost
[47:05] where it was accepted and allowed by god
[47:10] that they would speak in towns and
[47:12] perform
[47:13] miracles and have the the the operation
[47:17] of the gifts and that was accepted
[47:21] at that time like the lamb like the
[47:23] blood the natural blood was accepted
[47:26] until the reality comes you see
[47:29] so it was accepted with those original
[47:32] uh old-fashioned pentecostals
[47:36] that took the word of god for that hour
[47:39] but from the time a messenger broke on
[47:42] the scene
[47:44] and the word began to go forth
[47:47] a dispensation changed the word
[47:51] was made manifest praise god
[47:54] brother branham said what a lot of them
[47:56] never realized
[47:58] is that we are not building a house
[48:01] amen we're not building a wall
[48:04] we are here to build a house of the lord
[48:08] he said if you're building a wall you
[48:10] just keep going straight
[48:12] but when you're building a house you
[48:14] have to know how to turn the corner
[48:17] and it takes a good stone mason to know
[48:20] how to put those bricks and turn the
[48:22] corner
[48:23] and a lot of people because they have no
[48:26] revelation
[48:27] they take the written word and say i'm
[48:30] staying with the word that's good
[48:32] but they're going to follow that word
[48:34] straight
[48:35] straight and not recognizing that the
[48:39] word
[48:39] turned the corner but they keep going on
[48:43] like that and then claiming that they're
[48:46] following
[48:46] their word but the word of a past day
[48:49] not the word of this hour
[48:51] not the word of today see and so they're
[48:54] blinded to the very
[48:56] word that they claim they're following
[49:00] hallelujah praise god it came down
[49:04] luther wesley pentecost and
[49:08] now it's the revelation
[49:11] of the word it's the birthright promise
[49:14] of this age the holy spirit comes and
[49:17] tests and tries you
[49:19] to see if that gene or that spirit is in
[49:22] you
[49:23] amen that you will be able to be a
[49:27] receptor
[49:29] of revelation from this world
[49:32] not to inculcate it receive it
[49:35] build up yourself in it by intellectual
[49:40] not by logic not by analysis
[49:44] debate none not by any of those sciences
[49:48] or means of thinking that they school
[49:52] you with that when you approach anything
[49:55] you approach it
[49:56] with that schooling in mind of how you
[49:59] come to it
[50:01] but you you you are as a believer come
[50:03] to this knowing nothing
[50:05] i don't know nothing and this god that
[50:08] is of heaven
[50:09] praise the lord will make himself known
[50:13] to you blessed are you who are
[50:16] eyes amen he has not revealed these
[50:19] things to the wise and the school and
[50:22] the prudent
[50:23] but he's revealed them to babes and
[50:25] sucklings
[50:26] and such as with lord amen glory to god
[50:30] hallelujah
[50:31] amen praise god let's get into
[50:34] the word amen hallelujah
[50:38] so receiving and believing
[50:42] the word the promised
[50:45] word for your age gives you
[50:48] the birth right or the
[50:51] right to be born again
[50:55] hallelujah because it's only by
[50:57] receiving
[50:59] that word for that age your age
[51:02] that you are born again hallelujah
[51:06] glory to god amen oh god is good praise
[51:10] god i i just realized i left all the
[51:13] quotes
[51:14] at home but praise the lord i'll i'll
[51:16] just
[51:17] do the best that god knows everything
[51:20] lord of god i was just about to turn to
[51:22] a coat and realize i don't have them
[51:24] oh praise god amen i'll do the best with
[51:28] what's in me here
[51:29] praise god hallelujah just put your
[51:32] spoon in the pot and whatever comes out
[51:34] you just enjoy it and
[51:36] give god the praise and the honor and
[51:39] the glory amen
[51:40] hallelujah amen praise the lord
[51:44] now we did not know
[51:47] this truth for all these ages
[51:52] because not until this age
[51:55] did god allow the revelation
[51:59] of the mystery of the anointed ones
[52:03] to be made known unto us
[52:06] that a person could have the baptism of
[52:10] the holy ghost
[52:12] every day of their life and still go to
[52:15] hell
[52:17] oh we hear a lot of emphasis
[52:20] on people receiving the baptism the holy
[52:23] ghost
[52:25] but you see we're not talking about the
[52:28] baptism holy ghost just you get it as
[52:31] they got it back down there
[52:33] in recent pentecost 1906
[52:36] amen you see that's not going to give
[52:39] you
[52:40] this amen you it certainly will give you
[52:43] it'll make you jump shout you'll get
[52:46] healed you'll see
[52:47] signs you'll see wonders you'll be
[52:49] astonished you'll be astounded
[52:51] and it's the truth it's wonderful but
[52:54] it's limited
[52:55] it hasn't caught up to that place
[52:59] where the word itself is your central
[53:03] vision where you look away from
[53:06] everything else
[53:07] and you look to jesus and you see
[53:11] jesus revealed in his
[53:14] own word amen praise god
[53:19] you can have the holy ghost anointing
[53:22] you and you're not born again
[53:25] what an amazing statement when i first
[53:28] heard that
[53:30] got the holy ghost all your life and you
[53:34] could be insane
[53:35] he said another place you could be
[53:38] insane
[53:39] you could be completely out of it you
[53:42] don't know what you're doing
[53:43] but yet you got the holy ghost amen
[53:46] praise god
[53:48] oh my you know when i was just
[53:51] young in the ministry praise god i was
[53:54] preaching with
[53:55] fire and brimstone about the baptism in
[53:58] the holy ghost i was in pentecost
[54:01] and i was just preaching the word 14
[54:04] years old
[54:05] prostitutes fishermen drunk men
[54:08] businessmen high profile
[54:12] business people principles of high
[54:16] schools and ever
[54:17] were getting converted people were
[54:20] getting
[54:21] healed they were coming with buses from
[54:24] many miles away until the whole
[54:27] town was in revival and the spirit of
[54:31] god was
[54:32] moving in a mighty way oh praise god
[54:35] hallelujah
[54:36] but one day god wanted to take me higher
[54:41] and a good friend we came
[54:44] through high school together and
[54:46] everything else
[54:47] and he sees what god is doing so he said
[54:49] oh pray for me
[54:50] i want to receive the holy ghost amen
[54:53] and we
[54:54] laid hands on him and we're going to
[54:56] pray that the holy ghost will come upon
[54:58] him
[54:59] and all of a sudden hallelujah he
[55:01] shouted he began
[55:02] speaking in towns and everything like
[55:05] that
[55:06] and while he was speaking in towns
[55:09] oh my goodness i can't tell you how i
[55:12] know
[55:14] and the other brother that was with me
[55:16] he can't tell
[55:17] but we both open our eyes from praying
[55:20] and we just happened to look at each
[55:22] other and we didn't have to speak
[55:24] because it's like i knew what he knew
[55:28] and he knew that i knew
[55:32] i saw it too that that was not the holy
[55:35] ghost
[55:36] even though he was speaking in tongues
[55:38] like you wouldn't believe it
[55:41] he was speaking in towns and
[55:44] i realized that's not the holy ghost
[55:46] because inside is spoken said
[55:49] that's not me and so
[55:52] in the name of jesus christ come out of
[55:55] him
[55:58] oh you caught me
[56:02] and then you know i was uh back
[56:06] there and such and i was in france i i
[56:08] was in israel i was in england and i did
[56:11] this this that
[56:12] and then i came down here and met this
[56:14] mother working in the field and the
[56:16] child was
[56:17] under a tree where a certain act took
[56:19] place and i had a right to
[56:21] to possess and take the child as my
[56:24] house and
[56:24] and so on we didn't want i didn't want
[56:26] to hear that we just began to rebuke
[56:28] that devil
[56:29] but the point i am making is that from
[56:33] that moment while i didn't know anything
[56:37] about no
[56:38] messenger no prophet nobody i didn't
[56:41] know i'm new to pentecost i'm young i'm
[56:44] just there
[56:45] but right then it was revealed to me
[56:49] that tongues was not and could not be
[56:53] the the infallible initial
[56:56] evidence of the presence of the holy
[56:59] spirit
[57:01] and so with that understanding
[57:05] of course that start bringing me
[57:08] into conflict with the founders
[57:13] of the denomination and the teachers
[57:19] then you will find out in the early days
[57:23] of the message now
[57:25] after i caught it came in praised the
[57:28] lord
[57:30] we were preaching the word and while we
[57:33] were preaching the word
[57:35] there were trinitarian preachers going
[57:39] out there and having
[57:40] masked miracle ministry revivals
[57:44] people were being healed by the hundreds
[57:47] and the
[57:48] thousands and i would go to those
[57:50] meetings and see
[57:51] those things taking place and we claim
[57:54] we have the word and i know that it used
[57:58] to happen a lot with me
[58:00] it was still happening but on a more
[58:02] limited sense because my focus
[58:04] changed to the world not to the
[58:08] production of miracles and signs and
[58:11] wonders
[58:12] and and these things though it's true
[58:15] and it was there
[58:17] but at that time of course i couldn't
[58:19] understand
[58:20] here's a trinitarian preaching father
[58:23] son and holy ghost three gods in one
[58:27] and all that sort of stuff and still
[58:29] having signs wonders and miracles
[58:32] and ah you're wondering to know how can
[58:35] they do that
[58:36] but after that prophet preached on the
[58:39] anointed ones at their
[58:41] time you could recognize that a man
[58:45] might not even be
[58:46] born again and have the baptism holy
[58:49] ghost
[58:50] down right upon his spirit
[58:53] and still be able to produce things
[58:55] oneness
[58:56] and miracles hallelujah
[58:59] and go on like that and still go to hell
[59:04] because he has reckoned he has not
[59:06] recognized
[59:07] the word of god for his hour
[59:10] still baptizing the people and titles
[59:13] of father son and holy ghost
[59:16] and not realizing the word for his
[59:20] day and for his time and sometimes it's
[59:22] fearful even people in this message that
[59:26] claim they are believers they take it so
[59:29] lightly oh it's a wonderful brother
[59:31] it is like cain is to a bell
[59:34] but he's baptizing in the title of
[59:36] father son and holy ghost
[59:39] but he is holding on to the trinity
[59:43] he is not seeing one god oh
[59:46] my think about it praise god so
[59:50] we're making a a distinction that you
[59:52] could see the difference between these
[59:55] twins
[59:56] because twins usually look so close
[1:00:00] like a blade of grass and a blade of
[1:00:04] wheat
[1:00:05] that when they are very young you can't
[1:00:07] see
[1:00:09] or know much of the difference
[1:00:12] but with maturity then you begin to see
[1:00:15] a distinction
[1:00:17] beginning to take place and i believe
[1:00:19] it's now beginning to happen
[1:00:21] right within the confines of the message
[1:00:25] of god for this hour amen
[1:00:28] yes sir praise god hallelujah oh my that
[1:00:31] man praying for sick
[1:00:33] people getting healed and everything
[1:00:35] else what are you gonna say about that
[1:00:37] but keep your eyes on the word
[1:00:40] hallelujah oh praise god amen
[1:00:44] oh praise god that message if you have
[1:00:47] the time
[1:00:48] go back and read it how he pours his
[1:00:51] reign on the just
[1:00:53] and on the unjust prophet said when the
[1:00:56] holy ghost rain
[1:00:57] falls the true believer says amen glory
[1:01:00] to god he says and the wheat is just as
[1:01:03] thirsty and
[1:01:04] and hot and they're gonna cry praise god
[1:01:06] hallelujah
[1:01:07] and jump for joy also but what
[1:01:11] life is the rain producing in one and
[1:01:14] what
[1:01:14] life is it producing in the other one
[1:01:17] it's what
[1:01:18] seed of life was buried
[1:01:21] in there before the foundation of the
[1:01:23] world
[1:01:24] that the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:01:26] manifests
[1:01:28] and makes real that people can see
[1:01:32] what was underneath the earth
[1:01:35] they can't see that until the rain falls
[1:01:38] on it
[1:01:39] so when the rain comes on it the thing
[1:01:41] makes itself manifest
[1:01:43] and then you're able to recognize what's
[1:01:46] hiding
[1:01:47] what nature what character what person
[1:01:50] is hiding back of that skin veil that
[1:01:54] dirt ashes to ashes just thus
[1:01:57] from whence we came it begins to make
[1:01:59] that known
[1:02:00] to the people amen praise god hallelujah
[1:02:04] oh praise god god is here calling out to
[1:02:07] his genuine elect brother sister
[1:02:11] he is trying to identify to the entire
[1:02:15] world
[1:02:16] or show to the world this bride
[1:02:19] these believers that they're different
[1:02:23] hallelujah but notice when
[1:02:26] god sent a joshua and a caleb
[1:02:30] he sent them a moses he sent them to
[1:02:33] moses
[1:02:34] hallelujah and they were called out
[1:02:39] what called them out the message of
[1:02:42] moses
[1:02:43] something about moses called them out
[1:02:47] amen but watch not they were not the
[1:02:50] only one
[1:02:52] uh you know captured by moses's message
[1:02:56] there were many others that came out of
[1:02:59] egypt the same time that came out
[1:03:03] the bible tells us he had a mixed
[1:03:05] multitude
[1:03:08] amen hallelujah they came out together
[1:03:13] and that mixed multitude we know are the
[1:03:16] ones that perished
[1:03:18] within the wilderness because they had
[1:03:22] to have a time
[1:03:23] of life and so in the 40-year
[1:03:27] journey through the wilderness here were
[1:03:30] the twins
[1:03:31] walking side by side
[1:03:34] joshua caleb and the other
[1:03:38] twins hybrid religion twins
[1:03:43] mix multitude twins
[1:03:46] that were walking side by side
[1:03:50] amen there they were brother sister
[1:03:54] hallelujah thank god
[1:03:58] that this little bride of this hour
[1:04:02] recognizes she can't lead herself
[1:04:06] and according to malachi 4
[1:04:09] 5 he promised to send a man
[1:04:12] that will he'll pour his word
[1:04:16] through him his spirit through him
[1:04:20] he'll be the man with the water pot that
[1:04:23] the holy ghost can pour out
[1:04:26] of the word for the hour upon
[1:04:29] the people amen praise god
[1:04:32] and so god sent a man
[1:04:36] that could explain or expound some of
[1:04:39] the mysteries
[1:04:40] uh to us hallelujah and
[1:04:43] all she had to do is to show
[1:04:47] that she had that gene quality in her
[1:04:51] to receive and understand the word for
[1:04:55] her day
[1:04:56] and for her hour coming through the
[1:04:58] mouth of that messenger
[1:05:01] praise god to identify her and for her
[1:05:04] to recognize who she was
[1:05:07] oh praise his name hallelujah amen
[1:05:11] oh praise god oh my god don't you
[1:05:14] understand brother
[1:05:15] brother branham is dead and god it's not
[1:05:17] brother branham that leads you to the
[1:05:19] promised land
[1:05:20] it's the revelation of the word that
[1:05:23] takes you to the promised land that
[1:05:25] takes you into the rapture
[1:05:27] that takes you into the presence of the
[1:05:29] lord you're now to be led by what
[1:05:31] the pillar of fire giving you light
[1:05:34] giving you
[1:05:35] power amen that you might walk in the
[1:05:37] light of the day amen
[1:05:39] hallelujah praise god here
[1:05:42] i think i have written here uh oh my
[1:05:46] god leading his army from victory to
[1:05:49] victory
[1:05:51] from revelation to revelation
[1:05:55] a songwriter says his army shall he lead
[1:05:59] till every four is vanquished and
[1:06:02] christ is lord indeed
[1:06:06] amen hallelujah at the same time
[1:06:10] god brought moses leading
[1:06:14] joshua caleb on a mixed multitude out
[1:06:18] jesus in his day had
[1:06:21] judas and the rest of his disciples
[1:06:25] all were following him and the bible
[1:06:28] tells us
[1:06:30] have i not chosen you
[1:06:33] judas was chosen do you realize that
[1:06:38] he was chosen but
[1:06:41] one of you is a devil
[1:06:44] oh my praise god
[1:06:48] what does he mean by chosen chosen in
[1:06:51] eternity chosen in time
[1:06:53] different but the fact is a lying spirit
[1:06:56] went up before god in the time
[1:07:00] when ahab wanted to know what to do and
[1:07:02] said lord
[1:07:04] choose me send me them let me go down
[1:07:07] and lie in them prophet's mouth
[1:07:10] and and god all them different spirit
[1:07:12] evil spirits asking to be the one
[1:07:15] and you know whether it's live murder
[1:07:18] this
[1:07:18] that but god shows and says okay
[1:07:21] you lying spirit go down and you go lie
[1:07:24] in their mouths
[1:07:25] amen so you see even that lion spirit
[1:07:27] was chosen
[1:07:28] for the job that he did amen you see
[1:07:32] my god it's that way i'm saying that
[1:07:35] judas
[1:07:35] was chosen and he was chosen to be the
[1:07:39] one
[1:07:40] that will test try prove the word
[1:07:44] and be right there as a familiar spirit
[1:07:46] step by step
[1:07:48] along with the word of god
[1:07:51] for that hour and praise god
[1:07:54] so we see judas so god
[1:07:58] will always give the bride somebody that
[1:08:00] will
[1:08:01] lead her amen
[1:08:04] and that they will pay attention because
[1:08:07] they'll realize after a while it's not
[1:08:10] just the man
[1:08:13] it's just not the man talking that man
[1:08:16] may talk of himself for
[1:08:18] for a second whatever he'll talk but
[1:08:20] then later on they'll realize something
[1:08:22] happen
[1:08:23] it's god talking through that man
[1:08:26] because the words are never failing
[1:08:29] they're coming to pass
[1:08:30] and they're way beyond the meaning
[1:08:33] the opening the revelation is way beyond
[1:08:36] the words of a man
[1:08:38] it goes right back into eternity amen
[1:08:41] that it isn't a man because it's god
[1:08:43] says so
[1:08:44] amen praise god hallelujah praise
[1:08:48] god aren't you happy that we are here by
[1:08:50] grace
[1:08:52] we are not here by choosing we are not
[1:08:55] here because we feel that
[1:08:57] you know we prayed a little more than
[1:08:59] somebody else that's why the holy ghost
[1:09:01] accept us
[1:09:02] we studied a little bit more we we went
[1:09:05] into the message a little
[1:09:07] many more years and whatever we did
[1:09:10] it's not by works of righteousness
[1:09:13] which we have done or we are doing
[1:09:16] though we should do works of
[1:09:17] righteousness
[1:09:18] but it is not by works of righteousness
[1:09:21] it's not by charity it's none by any of
[1:09:24] these things
[1:09:25] or human effort but by his grace
[1:09:28] and by his mercy that he chose us
[1:09:32] and placed us in his body amen to be
[1:09:35] one with him and bring him all
[1:09:38] the glory amen praise god and if you're
[1:09:41] truly born again

[1:16:47] oh glory to god hallelujah the cross
[1:16:50] over into it praise god hallelujah
[1:16:54] amen i tell you friends we thank god
[1:16:57] that we
[1:16:58] we sold out everything else to get this
[1:17:01] revelation
[1:17:03] let me give you an example here i was
[1:17:06] following the ministry of a
[1:17:08] mighty man of god mighty in the message
[1:17:12] worldwide ministry oh my
[1:17:15] the world was shaking under the seven
[1:17:18] thunders and the power of those seven
[1:17:20] thunders because it was genuine that it
[1:17:23] really did catch something real and it
[1:17:26] opened it up for
[1:17:27] all the rest of us but the fact is i was
[1:17:30] following that
[1:17:32] and i was very close to this brother
[1:17:36] i would be in his home his children
[1:17:38] would be around me we would be
[1:17:39] talking we'd be sharing praise the name
[1:17:42] of the lord
[1:17:43] i preached in this church when he only
[1:17:44] had about a hundred people
[1:17:46] oh my he end up with thousands in the
[1:17:49] church
[1:17:49] but the fact is that um he had a meeting
[1:17:53] here in
[1:17:54] montreal and i got on a greyhound bus to
[1:17:56] go up there
[1:17:57] and i'm in the bus and while i'm in the
[1:18:00] bus you know
[1:18:02] the journey is long and so you get kind
[1:18:04] of sleepy dosy
[1:18:05] and so i start to kind of slip off and
[1:18:08] between sleep and wake
[1:18:11] i heard a voice genesis 1 11
[1:18:15] every seed brings forth after its kind
[1:18:18] whose kind are you going to be one of
[1:18:21] his
[1:18:22] or one of mine and you see i'm in that
[1:18:25] state i'm not thinking i just
[1:18:27] automatically answer yours lord
[1:18:31] and when i said that then i said well
[1:18:33] who am i talking to
[1:18:35] and i said who am i talking to them like
[1:18:38] come to myself
[1:18:39] and i realized that that was the lord
[1:18:42] talking to me
[1:18:43] get away from that thing are you going
[1:18:46] to come out in his image
[1:18:49] you're going to be after that kind you
[1:18:52] got to follow the word
[1:18:55] and then you'll be a seed or come in my
[1:18:58] image
[1:18:59] and here i was right at the very
[1:19:03] top of that movement already
[1:19:06] taking some of the meetings where the
[1:19:07] brother couldn't go
[1:19:10] and then all of a sudden they notice you
[1:19:13] step back
[1:19:15] oh my humanly speaking is like
[1:19:19] it's not logical it's not sanity you're
[1:19:21] just about to be like really successful
[1:19:24] and
[1:19:26] so on and you step right back
[1:19:29] and even the sister of mine who has gone
[1:19:31] on for many years
[1:19:32] oh they start to call me names and
[1:19:35] everything
[1:19:36] else you know why why don't you just get
[1:19:39] there go visit the church and
[1:19:41] you know they'll they're gonna ask you
[1:19:42] to preach and all these thousands of
[1:19:44] people are gonna
[1:19:45] hear and i said no you don't understand
[1:19:48] she doesn't know that behind the scenes
[1:19:50] i went to the brother
[1:19:52] i didn't tell him my experience but i
[1:19:55] just said brother
[1:19:57] i can't follow you anymore
[1:20:01] right not what you're saying is wrong
[1:20:05] but i have my own leading
[1:20:08] and inspiration by the holy spirit that
[1:20:10] i must follow
[1:20:13] oh my and that kicked up a racket
[1:20:16] but you see that's what the true
[1:20:18] believer has to do
[1:20:20] you just keep following the word so you
[1:20:23] can enter
[1:20:24] into the fullness of your birthright
[1:20:27] that you could have the right birth amen
[1:20:31] praise the name of the lord so brother
[1:20:33] sister
[1:20:34] that it is what it is today because
[1:20:37] the revelation is life
[1:20:42] is that right and without that
[1:20:44] revelation you're not
[1:20:46] going in the rapture for the rapture
[1:20:49] itself is a revelation
[1:20:52] and without it and the ability
[1:20:56] given to you to receive
[1:21:00] revelation and to live by revelation
[1:21:03] speak by revelation all that you do by
[1:21:06] the revelation of the holy spirit
[1:21:10] you'll miss the rapture and you will not
[1:21:13] be a part of it
[1:21:15] praise the name of the lord jesus we are
[1:21:17] not in the pentecostal age anymore
[1:21:20] how many knows that the church ages are
[1:21:23] over
[1:21:24] i don't even need to give you quotes
[1:21:26] there are so many places that tell you
[1:21:28] that that the church ages are over
[1:21:31] and done with then if they're over what
[1:21:34] did god bring us out just
[1:21:36] the church is the roof and then you're
[1:21:37] gonna wander about yes you would
[1:21:40] if you don't know what's the next step
[1:21:43] right but praise god
[1:21:46] he brought us out that he might bring us
[1:21:50] in that he might bless us
[1:21:53] is that right praise god i said he
[1:21:56] brought us out
[1:21:57] that he might bring us in that he might
[1:22:00] bless us
[1:22:00] praise god in the promised land that we
[1:22:03] have entered him to lord of god
[1:22:05] hallelujah
[1:22:06] amen praise god forevermore
[1:22:09] amen praise god so we find out that
[1:22:12] a lot of people today are preaching
[1:22:15] messages for another age
[1:22:20] and of another age
[1:22:23] say oh boy but they're preaching a lot
[1:22:25] of revelation a lot of
[1:22:26] quotes and everything else like that
[1:22:28] that's wonderful marvelous
[1:22:30] and everything else like that praise god
[1:22:33] hallelujah
[1:22:34] but you see even brother branham himself
[1:22:38] many things that he spoke under the
[1:22:41] understanding
[1:22:42] of the scriptures that he had at that
[1:22:44] time
[1:22:46] were wrong and contrary to the word
[1:22:52] contrary to the word he himself said so
[1:22:55] by the way
[1:22:57] amen but when that those seals got
[1:23:00] opened
[1:23:02] and the angel of god the holy spirit
[1:23:05] began
[1:23:06] to teach him you know the quotes where
[1:23:09] he looked up and said
[1:23:10] oh my god i realized then that
[1:23:14] charles and ella branham were not my
[1:23:17] real
[1:23:17] mother and father in other words they're
[1:23:19] just mother and father for his flesh
[1:23:21] but his real mother oh great jehovah
[1:23:24] hallelujah i'm coming to thee lord
[1:23:28] he said and from that moment the bible
[1:23:30] became a new bible oh
[1:23:34] praise god hallelujah that bible become
[1:23:37] a new bible
[1:23:38] he had entered into the new land
[1:23:42] because the seals opened up and he
[1:23:44] walked into
[1:23:45] that new promised land praise
[1:23:48] god and then he himself began to preach
[1:23:52] truths that contradicted
[1:23:55] things that he preached under the first
[1:23:58] and second pull
[1:23:59] or in the other ages it began to
[1:24:02] contradict it
[1:24:03] you know like love perfect love
[1:24:08] is the evidence of the holy ghost
[1:24:13] then another time he says well it's the
[1:24:16] fruits of the spirit
[1:24:18] you got to have the entire statue of a
[1:24:21] perfect man
[1:24:22] add to your faith this ad and when you
[1:24:24] get the whole thing
[1:24:26] then you got the holy ghost you see
[1:24:30] praise the lord but then he said but
[1:24:34] when an angel he said yes i i
[1:24:37] taught those things and i said those
[1:24:39] things but when an
[1:24:40] angel come down from heaven and stand up
[1:24:44] in front of you
[1:24:45] and said did not our lord say when he
[1:24:49] the spirit of truth is come
[1:24:52] what will he do he will guide you into
[1:24:54] all truth
[1:24:56] guide you in the world and show you
[1:24:58] things to come
[1:25:00] there is the evidence according to the
[1:25:02] lord himself
[1:25:04] oh praise god hallelujah all
[1:25:07] my brothers and sisters and this is
[1:25:10] where a lot of them get entangled
[1:25:12] because they take all those things the
[1:25:14] entire message from a to z
[1:25:17] and they throw them all together and and
[1:25:19] they want to
[1:25:21] take some from here and take some from
[1:25:22] there and mix it all together
[1:25:24] and bring it out and don't realize that
[1:25:27] because of not having a
[1:25:29] a clear revelation or understanding
[1:25:32] that they are placing misplaced in the
[1:25:35] word
[1:25:36] or dislocating the word of god
[1:25:40] amen praise god hallelujah
[1:25:44] oh my so thank god that across the
[1:25:47] bridge
[1:25:48] the sun is shining for me today amen
[1:25:52] it's shining for me today as a
[1:25:54] songwriter says an old one i just
[1:25:56] remembered
[1:25:57] heavenly sunshine heavenly sunshine
[1:26:01] flooding my soul with the glory divine
[1:26:04] oh my hallelujah heavenly
[1:26:08] sunshine shining down and
[1:26:11] bringing the word to a crystal clear
[1:26:15] understanding to us amen hallelujah
[1:26:18] oh glory to god let's go back to these
[1:26:20] twins amen
[1:26:22] uh praise god hallelujah let's go back
[1:26:24] to these twins that we're watching
[1:26:26] because we've we got to watch these
[1:26:29] twins and see
[1:26:30] amen hallelujah that the twins
[1:26:33] sometimes are some twins
[1:26:36] you look at them and you could right
[1:26:38] away you can tell a difference
[1:26:40] and you know that they're twins that are
[1:26:42] so close
[1:26:43] that they could stand right in front of
[1:26:45] you and you can
[1:26:47] hardly tell the difference voice
[1:26:50] looks everything same right
[1:26:54] oh my goodness because they're twins now
[1:26:57] we're talking about
[1:26:58] you're distinguishing now between the
[1:27:00] twins
[1:27:02] right you're distinguishing between the
[1:27:05] 10
[1:27:05] twins now you can find the scripture
[1:27:08] where the bible says
[1:27:09] but joshua and caleb were of a
[1:27:12] different spirit they might look the
[1:27:16] same
[1:27:17] but one got a different spirit
[1:27:20] the mother or the father more than
[1:27:22] likely will know the difference between
[1:27:24] those ten
[1:27:24] twins not because of just looks
[1:27:28] but one has a different spirit
[1:27:32] one has a different attitude
[1:27:35] a different approach all together
[1:27:38] hallelujah different from all the rest
[1:27:41] of
[1:27:42] them amen hallelujah so we find out
[1:27:45] friends here now we come down all the
[1:27:46] discerning of spirits
[1:27:48] not just looking on faces and not just
[1:27:52] talking like that but put in our faith
[1:27:54] in the word of god
[1:27:55] amen hallelujah praise god
[1:27:58] hallelujah oh my so the only way we can
[1:28:02] differentiate today
[1:28:03] is by discerning the lord's body
[1:28:07] being able to discern these enticing and
[1:28:09] seducing spirits
[1:28:11] praise god and discernment only comes or
[1:28:14] is in you
[1:28:16] by hebrews 4 12. amen
[1:28:19] for the word of god or the gene in you
[1:28:23] is quick and sharper
[1:28:27] than any two-edged sword
[1:28:30] i don't know how i'm going to know but
[1:28:33] when it's needed i'm i'm going to know
[1:28:36] is that right i'm going to know
[1:28:40] how you're so certain i have faith in
[1:28:42] him
[1:28:44] that i will know what i need to know
[1:28:47] when i need to know it
[1:28:49] and so i rest amen praise god
[1:28:53] even if it's taught that oh i got it
[1:28:55] over him or i deceived him or i fooled
[1:28:57] him
[1:28:57] that's fine it's when the end of the
[1:29:01] race is not losing
[1:29:02] one battle my friends is the winning of
[1:29:05] the war
[1:29:06] praise the lord so so go ahead but i'm
[1:29:09] gonna rest
[1:29:10] in him and let him take the glory amen
[1:29:13] praise the lord so we got to watch this
[1:29:16] spirit
[1:29:17] because this spirit is the same spirit
[1:29:20] that was
[1:29:20] on judas that is on the people the
[1:29:24] impersonators the copy cats
[1:29:26] the liars the one that is the ones that
[1:29:29] sit close by you and they're marking
[1:29:32] your mouth
[1:29:34] they're watching every action and
[1:29:35] attitude
[1:29:50] mine
[1:30:01] amen praise the lord so here it is my
[1:30:05] brother sister
[1:30:06] oh my that he was just there
[1:30:11] trying to uh absolutely
[1:30:15] uh do that that spirit of judas
[1:30:19] uh doing that you know and it was satan
[1:30:22] it's really a satan all the time you
[1:30:24] know you realize that
[1:30:27] let me just quickly do this michael
[1:30:30] and lucifer up in heaven war
[1:30:36] cane and a bell down in the garden
[1:30:39] war crow on the dove
[1:30:43] in the ark and then you go on
[1:30:47] and jacob and esau fighting
[1:30:51] and i'm not going to hit everyone let's
[1:30:53] go over to jesus and then we end up with
[1:30:55] jesus and judas
[1:30:57] and then you can go to paul watch the
[1:30:59] twins there
[1:31:00] paul is preaching under the same time he
[1:31:02] said but i want you don't know there is
[1:31:04] bread brethren sheeps and uh wolf in
[1:31:07] sheep's clothing
[1:31:09] they're they're acting like they're
[1:31:11] sheep but they're ravening wolves
[1:31:13] right amongst you announce you and i was
[1:31:16] there in the church
[1:31:18] right so i want you to be aware the
[1:31:19] twins are here they're coming
[1:31:21] down through the ages oh my
[1:31:24] oh glory to god hallelujah so we must
[1:31:28] recognize this
[1:31:29] praise the name of the lord hallelujah
[1:31:32] amen
[1:31:33] yes yes sir so he uses
[1:31:36] judas just the way that he used the
[1:31:40] serpent
[1:31:41] right he used the serpent and so he used
[1:31:45] judas now in that kind of a way
[1:31:48] praise god i think it's souls in prison
[1:31:51] now
[1:31:52] uh page 185 uh
[1:31:55] whether the scripture says the same
[1:31:59] quote says same spirits
[1:32:03] now living in the same kind of people
[1:32:07] condemn the people see
[1:32:11] condemned that could never be saved
[1:32:17] hallelujah what they got the holy ghost
[1:32:21] but could never be saved what they're
[1:32:24] speaking in tongues but could never be
[1:32:26] saved
[1:32:27] they're doing all these things but they
[1:32:29] could never be saved
[1:32:31] yes condemned people condemned he says
[1:32:36] you see because they were condemned
[1:32:40] before the foundation of the world
[1:32:44] like judas iscariot was
[1:32:48] born a son of perdition
[1:32:52] yes judas was born a
[1:32:55] son of hell perdition
[1:32:59] a son of satan that's what
[1:33:02] he was born hallelujah just think of it
[1:33:06] esau sought repentance with tears
[1:33:11] but he couldn't find it you see he
[1:33:14] wasn't
[1:33:15] born according to the word of god he
[1:33:18] wasn't
[1:33:19] among god's chosen few
[1:33:23] praise the name of the lord hallelujah
[1:33:25] uh
[1:33:26] you've got to remember judas was
[1:33:27] religious wasn't he
[1:33:30] judas was not unbeliever outside running
[1:33:33] around no
[1:33:33] he was one that was actually following
[1:33:37] jesus and he could make claim that he
[1:33:40] was a christian
[1:33:41] christians weren't called christians
[1:33:43] back then but i'm saying
[1:33:44] that he could make the claim that he was
[1:33:46] a christian
[1:33:48] and he was following jesus and was
[1:33:50] operating the gifts
[1:33:52] for the bible tells us he went out with
[1:33:54] the 70
[1:33:55] and they were healing the sick cleansing
[1:33:58] the lepers
[1:33:59] raising the dead and they come
[1:34:02] back to jesus you rejoice saying
[1:34:06] that this happened and jesus turned to
[1:34:08] them
[1:34:09] and said oh my rejoice not because you
[1:34:13] get
[1:34:13] all those healings and miracles what you
[1:34:15] need to rejoice about
[1:34:17] is that your names are written in heaven
[1:34:21] in other words you're elected you're
[1:34:23] chosen by god
[1:34:24] you're elected and your name is in the
[1:34:26] book but here it was
[1:34:28] judas was not there whatsoever
[1:34:32] amen praise the lord and that's one
[1:34:34] thing about the judah spirit
[1:34:37] it can't go on with the message
[1:34:40] it can only go so far
[1:34:43] and then it has to peel away from it
[1:34:46] for the seed shall not be air with the
[1:34:49] shock
[1:34:51] or turn it the other way the shock shall
[1:34:53] not
[1:34:54] be air with the seed amen
[1:34:57] see praise the name of the lord he can't
[1:34:59] go on
[1:35:00] hallelujah he can follow it when you see
[1:35:04] but when you're teaching oh jesus is a
[1:35:06] prophet
[1:35:09] he can follow it through there oh look
[1:35:12] at the miracles that jesus
[1:35:14] is doing my look at the breaking of the
[1:35:17] bread
[1:35:17] look at the this and that but when jesus
[1:35:20] got up and started saying
[1:35:21] i and my father are one
[1:35:26] i am that jehovah or the old testament
[1:35:29] now here standing in front of you
[1:35:33] and i'm proving it that no man could do
[1:35:35] these miracles
[1:35:37] except it's god amen
[1:35:40] oh my he can only go that far and he
[1:35:43] couldn't swallow it
[1:35:45] he can only come that far and can't see
[1:35:49] the word making itself manifest in the
[1:35:51] bride
[1:35:52] he can't see the son of man now being
[1:35:55] revealed
[1:35:56] he can say it you can talk all them
[1:35:58] things even what i'm saying he could
[1:35:59] talk it
[1:36:00] but to actually have it experientially
[1:36:03] and to have it in reality that's another
[1:36:05] matter altogether
[1:36:06] praise the name of the lord oh my my
[1:36:10] my lord of god hallelujah i'm not going
[1:36:12] to keep you forever and ever
[1:36:14] so um praise the lord hallelujah brother
[1:36:18] sister
[1:36:18] what a day we are living in
[1:36:21] you remember i'm just remembering when
[1:36:23] when they came back then jesus also told
[1:36:26] them
[1:36:26] he says i had joy with you
[1:36:31] before the foundation of the world
[1:36:34] if i were to paraphrase i had joy with
[1:36:37] you but you can't remember
[1:36:40] and you see you're suffering from
[1:36:42] spiritual amnesia
[1:36:44] the shock of sin on the human race you
[1:36:46] can't remember
[1:36:48] but i had joy with you before the
[1:36:51] foundation of the world
[1:36:53] when the sons of god were shouting for
[1:36:56] joy
[1:36:56] and praising god hallelujah they were
[1:36:59] suffering
[1:37:00] from spiritual amnesia in every
[1:37:04] possible way amen so you see friends
[1:37:08] that spirit of judas
[1:37:12] couldn't really follow the message
[1:37:15] all of the way and it will only
[1:37:18] receive certain things but then it'll
[1:37:21] start saying oh but you're going too far
[1:37:25] it's too much the other side amen
[1:37:28] see because satan has a trick
[1:37:32] he has a strategy even in this message
[1:37:37] and this strategy is that he is not mad
[1:37:41] at you you can preach all you want about
[1:37:43] all these ages that pass
[1:37:45] but when you start to preach present
[1:37:47] truth
[1:37:49] when you start to preach the word for
[1:37:51] this hour
[1:37:53] oh i bring it down more when you start
[1:37:56] to preach
[1:37:56] the revelation for this moment amen
[1:38:00] that the moment you need it it's there
[1:38:03] that he can't follow
[1:38:04] he can't understand that because he
[1:38:07] can't get it
[1:38:08] it just comes to you and brother branham
[1:38:10] said you know
[1:38:11] when god reveals something to you as
[1:38:13] long as you don't say it
[1:38:15] the devil is confused he doesn't know
[1:38:17] what to do and how to act
[1:38:19] he says just do it and before he can you
[1:38:22] have done it before he can do anything
[1:38:24] amen praise god so upon this rock i'll
[1:38:27] build my church
[1:38:29] and the gates of hell will not prevail
[1:38:32] against it
[1:38:33] what rock the rock of supernatural
[1:38:37] revelation moment to moment to moment a
[1:38:41] moment
[1:38:42] to every true genuine believer
[1:38:45] amen oh my god that because that's why
[1:38:48] he is the great
[1:38:49] i am amen
[1:38:52] the present tense god that's making
[1:38:55] himself known
[1:38:56] to his children to his people in this
[1:38:59] hour
[1:38:59] and in this time praise the name of the
[1:39:01] lord oh glory to
[1:39:03] god hallelujah o praise god
[1:39:06] no matter how much judas tried to
[1:39:08] imitate them rest of apostles
[1:39:11] it only worked out for a while it only
[1:39:14] worked for a while
[1:39:15] and it had to come to an end amen
[1:39:18] praise god that devil in this age now
[1:39:22] doesn't mind he will encourage anoint
[1:39:26] and allow those preachers to get a lot
[1:39:28] to say about the
[1:39:29] ages that already passed that are behind
[1:39:33] us
[1:39:34] and he wants you to keep you out
[1:39:38] of the message of this day
[1:39:41] the message this angel mighty angel's
[1:39:46] message or this last day messenger
[1:39:49] praise the name of the lord that's what
[1:39:51] he wants to do
[1:39:52] keep you there amen praise god
[1:39:56] and so if he can keep you back there
[1:39:58] you're trapped in those edges
[1:40:01] you're trapped in the edges there he is
[1:40:04] not for anybody trying to
[1:40:08] bring you out of the wilderness
[1:40:11] and bring you into the promised land
[1:40:14] of this capstone message amen
[1:40:18] don't want you in the present word of
[1:40:20] the hour
[1:40:22] where the promises come to their
[1:40:25] fullness within your life
[1:40:27] whenever you have need of them and
[1:40:30] to come to a place where you are living
[1:40:33] in a
[1:40:34] contin and consistent
[1:40:39] state of receiving revelation
[1:40:43] not that you receive one revelation over
[1:40:44] here and you study that
[1:40:47] but that you're living in a stream
[1:40:50] of consistent and constant
[1:40:53] revelation that you don't have
[1:40:57] any control over because the tide goes
[1:41:00] out
[1:41:00] and comes in as he wills and you're just
[1:41:03] resting in his hands
[1:41:05] isn't that wonderful praise the name of
[1:41:08] the lord
[1:41:08] oh my friends oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:41:12] can i get just let me see if i can get a
[1:41:14] little more time here

[1:41:19] amen
[1:41:20] praise the lord jesus hallelujah
[1:41:23] amen amen praise god
[1:41:27] take enough of the message and then the
[1:41:30] rest of it you can't stomach
[1:41:32] you're puking it up you saw all of a
[1:41:35] sudden you find the prophet's message is
[1:41:37] wonderful but this part
[1:41:40] this piece over here can't take it you
[1:41:43] start to
[1:41:44] puke it up amen praise god you can take
[1:41:48] healing
[1:41:49] let me quote him he says here uh
[1:41:54] imagine judas could take part of it but
[1:41:57] the rest of it he could not stomach
[1:42:00] they can take healing they can take all
[1:42:03] them
[1:42:03] other things but when it comes
[1:42:06] to seeing god speaking
[1:42:10] squirrels into existence he didn't say
[1:42:14] i spoke squirrels into existence
[1:42:18] he said but when it comes for them
[1:42:20] seeing
[1:42:22] god speaking squirrels
[1:42:26] into existence oh my goodness
[1:42:30] hallelujah think about it my friends
[1:42:34] and now god's speaking the word and he's
[1:42:37] creating a bride
[1:42:38] not squirrels but a bride right in front
[1:42:41] their eyes
[1:42:43] and they can't recognize it because
[1:42:47] i don't see any change i didn't see
[1:42:49] anything happen oh my
[1:42:50] it's like brother branham said i just
[1:42:52] spoke and the next thing
[1:42:54] there's a squirrel there i he didn't
[1:42:56] even see or
[1:42:57] feel or no it just was there and praise
[1:43:01] god that's what's happening right now
[1:43:04] with the spoken word with the revealed
[1:43:07] word that's what it's doing praise the
[1:43:10] lord jesus
[1:43:11] and i'm glad i'm a part of it
[1:43:15] amen hallelujah amen yes sir
[1:43:18] praise god hallelujah oh my
[1:43:22] you can have all the written words you
[1:43:23] want and go to hell
[1:43:25] you can have the knowledge of the six
[1:43:28] seals and still go to hell
[1:43:31] amen but what god wants you to have is a
[1:43:34] clear
[1:43:34] crystal clear revelation of him
[1:43:38] and his word so let me emphasize we are
[1:43:41] watching spirits
[1:43:43] we're watching people's spirits
[1:43:46] we're not just watching their face or
[1:43:48] anything like that
[1:43:50] or watching the person because if you
[1:43:52] look at that
[1:43:53] a person could be a good person the
[1:43:56] person could be better morally than you
[1:43:59] that person could have like brother
[1:44:01] branham said he said some of the
[1:44:02] christian signs have more patience than
[1:44:05] than us sitting here some of them have
[1:44:07] more love
[1:44:09] they got those things in them like that
[1:44:12] but
[1:44:12] that is not what shows whether or not
[1:44:15] you
[1:44:16] have it praise the lord more
[1:44:20] obligation to their families taking care
[1:44:22] of their loved ones
[1:44:24] amen better than a lot of us
[1:44:27] here praise the lord amen
[1:44:30] glory to god but one thing we have
[1:44:34] is a un remitting thirst and
[1:44:37] hunger for this revelation of the word
[1:44:42] of the living god amen hallelujah
[1:44:45] and you know the time is coming some
[1:44:47] people are going to lay aside
[1:44:48] these books of this message and start to
[1:44:52] think
[1:44:52] i got to make something better of my
[1:44:54] life
[1:44:56] right i got to make something better in
[1:44:59] my life
[1:45:00] and they want to get rid of the
[1:45:03] word and the tapes uh that they have
[1:45:07] and they go out there to get a little
[1:45:08] more profit a little more gain
[1:45:11] a better quality of natural life
[1:45:15] not knowing that that natural life is
[1:45:17] only for 70 years 100 years
[1:45:20] and you're weighing that against a life
[1:45:22] of eternal life
[1:45:24] for endless endless years to come
[1:45:28] amen praise the name of the lord
[1:45:30] hallelujah
[1:45:31] but friends i tell you and more than
[1:45:34] that the
[1:45:35] people that claim they think they're in
[1:45:37] the bride they might look slow
[1:45:39] they might look like they're sluggards
[1:45:42] they may not look
[1:45:43] good they may not uh have an outward
[1:45:47] representation amen but i tell you
[1:45:50] something
[1:45:51] in their heart god looks at them and he
[1:45:54] sees a princess
[1:45:56] he sees a prince with god he sees kings
[1:46:00] he sees
[1:46:00] priests when he looks at them because no
[1:46:04] matter how
[1:46:05] outside all the mistakes all the jumbled
[1:46:08] up failures
[1:46:09] even in that god allowing that to get
[1:46:12] satan's all muddled
[1:46:13] well he can't be a christian oh she
[1:46:15] can't be and maybe that's the very one
[1:46:18] is that right because god uses all those
[1:46:21] things
[1:46:22] just to hide himself behind the scenes
[1:46:26] that they can't recognize him of who he
[1:46:29] is oh blessed be the name of the living
[1:46:32] god
[1:46:32] hallelujah you got to look sometimes you
[1:46:35] know we don't
[1:46:37] we don't act like bride be true to
[1:46:39] yourself
[1:46:42] sometimes we we don't act like bride you
[1:46:45] may catch yourself afterwards
[1:46:47] and and then come back and and say
[1:46:50] forgive me lord
[1:46:52] and like that and so on but sometimes we
[1:46:54] don't even act like brides
[1:46:57] and some of those people could go on
[1:46:59] through their life
[1:47:00] with a with a control and action
[1:47:04] and attitude and live in such a way that
[1:47:06] they look way
[1:47:07] better than you you can't even class
[1:47:10] yourself with them but god isn't looking
[1:47:13] at that
[1:47:14] he is looking past all that he sees the
[1:47:17] blood
[1:47:19] he sees the promise he sees that
[1:47:23] gene seated in there hallelujah
[1:47:27] he sees a queen a king a prince with god
[1:47:30] in there that's what he's looking at
[1:47:33] amen
[1:47:34] praise god hallelujah doesn't matter how
[1:47:36] much hunger how much thirst what you got
[1:47:38] to suffer
[1:47:39] but your faith is in the lord and savior
[1:47:43] jesus christ hallelujah it's jubilee
[1:47:46] time
[1:47:47] i said it's jubilee time why because we
[1:47:50] are now
[1:47:51] free i don't know if you recognize how
[1:47:53] free you are
[1:47:54] but i recognize that i am i've been set
[1:47:58] free by the grace of god
[1:48:01] not freedom for folly amen
[1:48:05] not receiving my liberty as i've often
[1:48:07] said it over and over
[1:48:08] to go and perpetrate lawlessness
[1:48:12] but god has given you that feeling
[1:48:15] and that spirit to know that you can act
[1:48:18] move do because he is back of you
[1:48:22] he is walking with you every step of the
[1:48:24] way i'm winding this up now here
[1:48:26] praise the name of the lord he is back
[1:48:28] of us
[1:48:29] every step of the way praise god
[1:48:32] hallelujah
[1:48:33] we've been resurrected in jesus christ
[1:48:37] we raised up in jesus christ hallelujah
[1:48:40] and praise god i know for a fact
[1:48:45] that i will be but i am now in the
[1:48:49] resurrection
[1:48:50] it's going on now when i'm in it
[1:48:54] and when the whole thing comes to its
[1:48:56] fullness and it culminates
[1:48:57] i am still in it praise god
[1:49:00] but i am in the great marching on the
[1:49:03] great parade of saints
[1:49:05] right now while that rapture is taking
[1:49:08] place and that resurrection has taken
[1:49:10] place
[1:49:11] i've been raised up by the word of god
[1:49:14] hallelujah to see the day in which i'm
[1:49:17] living in
[1:49:18] praise god hallelujah oh my
[1:49:21] praise god and it's not just because my
[1:49:24] friends
[1:49:25] i'm better than anybody else but because
[1:49:28] somehow
[1:49:28] there happen to be something in me that
[1:49:31] sees the
[1:49:32] word in my day look
[1:49:36] when i go back the holy spirit takes me
[1:49:38] back
[1:49:39] like in prayer and said do you remember
[1:49:42] when you were
[1:49:44] just a child and they were singing
[1:49:48] jesus savior pilot me over
[1:49:51] life's tempestuous sea
[1:49:54] do you remember when you started crying
[1:49:59] because you started to see that
[1:50:02] i am the pilot that was supposed to
[1:50:06] lead you over all the trials and
[1:50:09] troubles
[1:50:10] of your life that was to come and that's
[1:50:13] the truth
[1:50:14] i never remembered but all of a sudden
[1:50:16] he brought it back
[1:50:17] he said i started to talk to you then
[1:50:21] lead you and guide you and if some of
[1:50:23] you will look back in your life you'll
[1:50:25] see that god was
[1:50:26] way back he's been talking to you
[1:50:29] but you don't realize that it was him
[1:50:32] leading and guiding you
[1:50:33] out of all kinds of dangers that already
[1:50:36] tried to come
[1:50:37] into your life amen praise god
[1:50:40] hallelujah
[1:50:41] oh my talk about the evidence of the
[1:50:43] holy ghost
[1:50:44] the evidence of the holy ghost my the
[1:50:47] evidence that the holy ghost was already
[1:50:50] in you the holy ghost the evidence that
[1:50:53] that gene
[1:50:54] was already there praise god hallelujah
[1:50:58] so friends let's wind this up it's not
[1:51:01] how good you're living it's not how
[1:51:04] moral you're living we are supposed to
[1:51:07] live morally
[1:51:07] we're supposed to live holy we're
[1:51:09] supposed to live true
[1:51:11] but your salvation is not based on that
[1:51:15] right it is not by works of
[1:51:18] righteousness
[1:51:19] that we have done but according to his
[1:51:21] grace
[1:51:22] and his mercy that he saved us
[1:51:26] hallelujah it's by catching every word
[1:51:30] and holding on to every word
[1:51:34] by revelation you're going to find
[1:51:36] somewhere i think it's in the future
[1:51:38] home
[1:51:38] where he says look the evidence of the
[1:51:41] holy ghost
[1:51:42] is to understand receive
[1:51:45] and understand the word of god for your
[1:51:48] age your day and then when you got it
[1:51:52] go out and live it praise god
[1:51:56] hallelujah the real evidence of the holy
[1:51:59] spirit
[1:52:00] i've seen people speak in tongues run
[1:52:03] the floors and everything else
[1:52:05] and two mornings later you realize that
[1:52:08] no that's not the holy ghost that's
[1:52:11] that's the devil
[1:52:12] back there so let's keep our eyes on
[1:52:15] jesus
[1:52:16] keep our eyes on the word
[1:52:19] and stay separate from the things of the
[1:52:22] world
[1:52:23] and let him have his way with you praise
[1:52:26] god
[1:52:27] so you are born again if you can
[1:52:30] hear the word of god
[1:52:33] for your day receive it in your heart
[1:52:36] and life
