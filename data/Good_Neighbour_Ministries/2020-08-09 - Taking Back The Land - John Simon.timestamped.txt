[17:29] wonderful
[17:30] opportunity and season that we

[17:37] though we though the family of god is

[18:12] may you breathe upon it
[18:15] and bring it to life again
[18:18] in the name of our lord jesus christ
[18:21] amen
[18:22] and amen
[18:26] it is found in the book of proverbs
[18:30] chapter 24
[18:33] reading from verses 30 to
[18:36] 32 and the scripture reads
[18:41] i went by the field of the slutful
[18:46] and by the vineyard of the man
[18:50] void of understanding
[18:53] and low it was grown
[18:56] over with thorns and
[19:00] nettles had covered the face
[19:03] thereof and the stone wall
[19:07] thereof was broken down
[19:12] then i saw and considered
[19:15] it well i looked upon it
[19:20] and received instruction
[19:24] praise god now shall we turn also
[19:29] to the book of
[19:32] jude and we will read
[19:37] verses 1 2
[19:41] 4 jude the servant of jesus christ
[19:46] and brother of james to them that
[19:49] are sanctified by god the father
[19:53] and preserved in jesus christ and
[19:56] called mercy unto you and
[19:59] peace and love be multiplied
[20:04] beloved when i gave
[20:07] all diligence to write unto you
[20:10] of the common salvation it
[20:14] was needful for me to write unto you
[20:17] and exhort you that you should
[20:21] earnestly contend for the faith
[20:25] which was once delivered
[20:28] unto the saints
[20:31] hallelujah my friends thank god
[20:35] for the nation of israel thank god for
[20:38] his people
[20:39] of whom i will commit today by his grace
[20:43] and making the application to ourselves
[20:47] and to the church of god of course
[20:50] we all know the story of the
[20:54] uh of the the wonderful story
[20:58] of how god brought israel out of
[21:01] egyptian bondage they
[21:04] were bound they were made to
[21:08] work they were in slavery enslaved
[21:12] their firstborns were being
[21:15] killed by pharaoh's midwives
[21:18] uh until god turned the tables
[21:22] and said since you want to destroy
[21:25] and kill off the uh the
[21:28] the young ones of the jews and to
[21:32] take them kill them out from the roots
[21:35] then
[21:36] god turned it and placed a pestilence
[21:40] upon pharaoh's kingdom you know that ten
[21:43] plagues
[21:44] but pestilences plagues came upon them
[21:48] and god using the pestilence
[21:52] which was horrible which was terrible
[21:55] but
[21:55] god was actually using instrumentality
[21:59] of a pestilence of plagues to deliver
[22:04] his people so by faith we understand
[22:08] god brought them out by
[22:11] a mighty hand redemption
[22:14] true blood and power god brought them
[22:17] out
[22:18] hallelujah but you see friends god did
[22:21] not
[22:22] bring them out to take them into
[22:25] the wilderness to wonder about
[22:28] but he brought them out that he might
[22:31] bring them
[22:32] in that he might bless them
[22:35] shall i read now i want you to know
[22:38] friends
[22:38] clearly in the word of god here
[22:42] that we understand that redemption
[22:46] then has two parts this is what we
[22:49] learn right now god brought israel out
[22:53] that he might bring them in that he
[22:56] might
[22:57] bless them god brought us out
[23:00] from worldliness from sin from
[23:03] churchianity
[23:04] from whatever conditions we were in god
[23:07] brought us out but he just
[23:10] bring us out for us to water from church
[23:12] to church and
[23:14] wander around in religious cir circles
[23:17] searching for you know not what but he
[23:19] brought you
[23:20] out that he might bring you into
[23:24] the promised land of his
[23:27] word that he might open up your
[23:30] understanding that he might lead you
[23:33] through
[23:33] the wilderness of this world with all
[23:37] its
[23:38] troubles and trials all the
[23:41] tribulations the heat the thirst the
[23:44] hunger
[23:46] like that that you might one day walk
[23:50] into your promised land
[23:53] his promised land promised by the word
[23:56] of god
[23:57] amen for you see coming out is not
[24:00] enough
[24:02] a lot of people have come out from the
[24:04] world
[24:06] and they are wandering in the wilderness
[24:10] of sin still with all kinds of murmuring
[24:14] spirits complaining spirits on them in
[24:18] the church
[24:19] in the group and still with
[24:22] their spirits upon them he brought
[24:25] us out hallelujah he brought me out
[24:30] true grace hallelujah
[24:33] grace law praise the lord
[24:37] and i tell you friend the law condemns
[24:41] but grace defends let me repeat
[24:44] the law condemns but grace
[24:48] defends the law convicts
[24:52] but grace pardons and cleanses
[24:56] and justifies thanks be to
[25:00] god for the precious blood oh precious
[25:03] is the flow that makes me white as snow
[25:07] no other fount i know nothing
[25:11] but the blood of jesus hallelujah
[25:15] now for them to come in they were
[25:17] brought
[25:18] out then he might bring them in
[25:22] for him to bring them into the promised
[25:25] land
[25:26] there were three things that they must
[25:29] do
[25:30] and three things that god gave to them
[25:33] hallelujah in order for them to conquer
[25:37] the land now let's study this at this
[25:40] particular point in time
[25:42] first of all the book of joshua if you
[25:45] were ever to
[25:47] study the book of joshua it'll be joshua
[25:49] chapter 1 to 5
[25:52] entering the land joshua's chapter
[25:55] 6 to 12 overcoming the land
[25:59] and joshua chapter 13 to 24
[26:03] occupying the land so
[26:06] you see friends in order to enter
[26:10] overcome
[26:11] and occupy we have a command
[26:16] we have a promise and we have
[26:19] some problems and we must overcome
[26:22] those problems before we can
[26:25] enter into god's promised land
[26:29] first of all in joshua chapter 1 verses
[26:32] 1 to 9
[26:33] israel and joshua were commanded by god
[26:38] to go in and take the land
[26:41] possess the land god told them that
[26:45] plainly this land is your land
[26:48] go into the land and
[26:52] take the land drive out the inhabitants
[26:55] thereof
[26:56] for that land is now your
[26:59] land now i'm typing canaan
[27:03] my friends the land of canaan to
[27:06] the land of this nation i'm typing it to
[27:10] the land of our churches
[27:12] i'm symbolizing it as our homes
[27:16] a place of peace and tranquility
[27:19] i'm symbolizing it as our
[27:22] own lives our own lifestyle our hearts
[27:27] oh praise god i'm also typing it
[27:31] as this message this
[27:34] word that is coming forth to you
[27:38] god's promised land which he
[27:41] promised that he would restore his
[27:44] word with and upon his
[27:47] people glory to god i read
[27:50] of the promise that was the command here
[27:52] is the promise
[27:53] deuteronomy chapter 8 verse 7
[27:57] for the lord thy god bringeth thee
[28:00] into a good land a land of
[28:03] brooks of water of fountains and depths
[28:06] that spring out of
[28:08] valleys and hills a land of wheat and
[28:12] barley
[28:12] and vines and fig trees and
[28:16] pomegranates a land of oil and
[28:19] olive and honey a land wherein
[28:23] thou shalt eat bread without
[28:26] scarceness hallelujah thou
[28:30] shalt not lack anything
[28:33] in it a land whose stones
[28:37] are iron and out of whose hills
[28:40] thou mayest dig brass glory to god thank
[28:45] god
[28:45] we also of course in this age had a
[28:48] promise according to malachi chapter 4 5
[28:50] how that god would send the line to the
[28:53] prophet who would restore the
[28:55] faith of the of the children of the
[28:58] fathers
[28:59] the children back to the fathers lord
[29:01] and god
[29:02] so our hearts are to be turned back our
[29:05] promise
[29:06] back to the original faith the original
[29:10] word what was taught preached
[29:13] lived demonstrated by
[29:16] the apostles glory to god hallelujah
[29:20] but with that friends we also have a
[29:23] problem
[29:24] because the devil is not going allow
[29:27] going to allow you
[29:28] just to walk in and take the land
[29:32] or or take these promises just
[29:36] because you have a right to take them
[29:38] because remember
[29:39] he's been sitting in that land
[29:43] for so many years and now you're going
[29:46] to
[29:47] be coming in to kick him out you want to
[29:50] kick him
[29:51] out of this land you want to kick him
[29:53] out
[29:54] of your home you want to kick him out of
[29:57] your lifestyle
[29:58] you want to kick him out of your heart
[30:01] your experience
[30:03] you want to kick him out even from
[30:05] invading
[30:06] our churches and this message of
[30:10] the owl look the problem is that the
[30:13] land is occupied
[30:14] amen the land is occupied the the
[30:18] great tree that jesus saw that grew from
[30:22] a little
[30:23] mustard seed found that it had all kinds
[30:26] of
[30:26] unclean birds and wicked unclean spirits
[30:30] roosting in the branches so is it with
[30:33] the church today
[30:35] and friends right in the very
[30:38] house of god the church of the living
[30:40] god
[30:41] we find that there were any spiritual
[30:45] enemies or against which we will fight
[30:48] we are not
[30:49] fighting people flesh and blood but
[30:52] against
[30:53] principalities powers and spiritual
[30:57] wickedness in high places now remember
[31:00] that even jesus had a congregation
[31:03] wherein he said have not i chosen you
[31:07] all of you but one of you is a devil
[31:10] right in jesus's little church
[31:13] there was a devil that that is one
[31:17] that had the seed of the serpent
[31:21] in him but at the same time
[31:24] peter one day said lord lord
[31:28] don't go up don't go up and jesus said
[31:31] to him
[31:32] get thee behind me satan you see one
[31:36] was a son of the devil the other one was
[31:39] temporarily used of the devil
[31:42] so looking jesus could see
[31:47] the devil working in both situations
[31:50] but he could differentiate and discern
[31:54] the difference between them but right in
[31:57] his church
[31:57] and even so today we have with the
[32:00] church
[32:01] my friends has got to drive up a whole
[32:04] lot of canaanites that are in the church
[32:08] because they can whatever they they do
[32:11] they can only do by night
[32:15] they can do by night and then we have to
[32:19] drive out
[32:20] a lot of hittites they're the ones that
[32:24] are in the church and all they're doing
[32:26] is sitting tight
[32:28] they're holding on there's a lot of ammo
[32:31] rights
[32:31] also in the church that's got to be
[32:33] driven out
[32:34] whatever the pastor says whatever the
[32:37] deacons tell them
[32:38] they are more right i am more right
[32:42] so they are amorites and they're always
[32:45] right and fighting and fussing
[32:48] and kind of on right within the church
[32:51] body
[32:52] we also have parasites or parasites
[32:55] that are in the body of the church
[32:58] some that just come into the church to
[33:00] be able to use
[33:02] the the facilities they uh take
[33:05] advantage of the generosity
[33:07] the giving the love the mercy and the
[33:10] grace of god
[33:12] and god's people and and and to misuse
[33:15] it
[33:16] and then we have another group here my
[33:19] friends
[33:20] that i can see on our uh jebusites that
[33:24] the bible speaks of them as jebusites i
[33:27] see them as those when a young convert
[33:31] comes in
[33:32] that will jab you in your sight so that
[33:35] you can't see the rest of the world
[33:37] and actually turn you away or turn you
[33:40] off
[33:41] of the message of the hour because of
[33:43] that jab
[33:44] in your sight and then
[33:47] within the the very uh group the very
[33:51] church of god wherever the church of god
[33:55] is the church is also filled with
[33:58] a lot of media nights uh you know
[34:02] they are in there in the church but
[34:04] their
[34:05] life is just filled with a lot of media
[34:08] and tv they're caught up with every
[34:12] rotten show amen they're caught up with
[34:16] every ungodly
[34:18] thing that comes on the television
[34:20] screen
[34:21] and i'll call them right now midianites
[34:25] now we understand also that they are
[34:28] more bites also in the church the pastor
[34:32] the membership can do as much as they
[34:34] can
[34:35] for them love them care for them and
[34:38] at the end of the day they'll turn
[34:41] around
[34:42] and bite for their call
[34:45] more more bites so the they have more
[34:49] bite
[34:50] they have more anger to them more
[34:53] vengeful spirits anointing them
[34:56] and so we have these more bites and then
[35:00] we have the hivites they love to fight
[35:03] they all wear that chest is always
[35:05] heaving with anger and temper
[35:08] and they're always ready to fight and
[35:10] these are all
[35:11] uh spirits personalities characters
[35:15] that are in the land that has to be
[35:18] taken out and i'm i let me not leave out
[35:22] the amount of kites
[35:23] because those are the ones filled with
[35:25] arrogance and pride
[35:27] they're like for high flying kites so
[35:29] they're called malachites
[35:30] so here we are dealing with all these
[35:33] nations
[35:34] that are in the land that god says
[35:37] before
[35:38] victory before possession before
[35:41] claiming your inheritance you must drive
[35:45] out these kinds of characters these
[35:47] kinds of
[35:48] nations spirits that are within the land
[35:52] now let me speak of that day and that
[35:55] time
[35:56] and the people of that day we understand
[35:59] that the people of that time that
[36:02] inhabited the land of canaan
[36:05] there were a wicked and idolatrous
[36:09] people
[36:10] they worship mammon i don't think
[36:14] they're much different
[36:16] than our world today wicked
[36:19] and idolatrous they love screen idols
[36:23] they love uh they love all manner of
[36:26] idolatry
[36:27] whether it's a a religious person
[36:29] becomes their idol
[36:31] but they love to worship idols
[36:34] and worship things and possessions
[36:37] their lovers of all these things my
[36:41] friends
[36:41] but here it is they worship mammon
[36:45] they worship bill bill
[36:49] mammon yes worshipping almighty dollar
[36:53] they'll do anything for a dollar my
[36:55] friends
[36:56] here we find it they worship bale
[36:59] and his wife the sex goddess asteroth
[37:04] oh god help us their worship was made
[37:08] up of terrible orgies
[37:11] their temples instead of being centers
[37:15] of worship of jehovah the one true
[37:18] god their temples were centers
[37:22] of vice dedicated to
[37:25] a bale and these gods of nimrod
[37:30] and so on tended by
[37:33] temple prostitutes
[37:37] and prostitute priestesses
[37:40] and sodomite priests oh
[37:44] god have mercy newborn babies were taken
[37:49] and placed in the fiery arms of baal
[37:52] sacrificed to him when a house
[37:56] or home was built back then
[38:00] in that land of canaan when the pagans
[38:03] ruled they would place a child will be
[38:08] killed a baby or child would be killed
[38:11] and placed within the foundations
[38:15] of that home as a sacrifice
[38:20] that would bring luck and build
[38:23] blessings upon them oh
[38:27] yes my friends just as today a people
[38:30] that love
[38:31] witches love witchcraft
[38:35] wizards they love to seek out
[38:39] psychics they love my friends
[38:42] to seek out mediums and to
[38:46] follow the pseudo sciences
[38:50] of astrology
[38:53] palmistry and horoscopes
[38:57] they follow star maps they pray to the
[39:01] dead
[39:03] they worship their ancestors
[39:07] and even later call them saints
[39:11] these were some of the evil
[39:14] ways of those nations
[39:17] that were in canaan now to obtain the
[39:21] land
[39:22] these evil ones had to be cast out
[39:26] they had to be destroyed deuteronomy
[39:30] chapter 7
[39:31] verses 16 to 24.
[39:34] god told israel this land
[39:38] has to be cleansed and its
[39:41] wicked inhabitants must be wiped out
[39:45] no sympathy nor mercy was to be shown
[39:49] and none were to be left alive
[39:52] my friends that is simply saying that we
[39:56] should go through our churches our
[39:58] nation
[39:59] our homes our hearts our lives our
[40:02] experiences
[40:04] and not one sin one
[40:07] unbelief should be left behind but we
[40:10] should be able to say
[40:11] search me o lord and
[40:14] know my heart today try
[40:17] me o savior oh and cleanse my
[40:21] heart i pray oh praise god

[40:34] who how were they going to trade them
[40:36] out but they were going to trade them
[40:39] out

[42:59] examine ourselves we must spy out
[43:02] the land search our hearts our homes
[43:06] search through our practices our
[43:08] fundamentals
[43:10] of our churches the foundations are to
[43:13] be searched
[43:14] upon what foundations we have built
[43:17] on whether upon the rock revelation
[43:21] of god's word unchanging word or upon
[43:24] the seeking sins of minds
[43:26] thoughts theologies and principles oh

[44:48] spirits of pride any spirit of
[44:52] self-importance and greed
[44:55] spirits of bondage any strongholds
[44:59] within our lives now i'm going to pause
[45:01] here you'll say
[45:02] well brother simon why are you saying
[45:05] spirits of this and spirits of that
[45:08] that's old-fashioned
[45:10] and and really it's a neurosis or it's a
[45:13] psychosis or it's
[45:15] it's some other a wonderful term that we
[45:18] placed upon it
[45:19] because they have named these diseases
[45:22] they have named these emotional problems
[45:24] and gave them beautiful wonderful
[45:27] medical names
[45:28] but when jesus was here upon earth he
[45:31] says
[45:32] he had a devil jesus look
[45:36] come out your lame spirit come out
[45:39] your deaf spirit this do you dumb
[45:42] spirit come out in the amen hallelujah
[45:46] jesus called these things spirit
[45:49] spirits for every disease has a
[45:52] perverted
[45:53] kind of a life that keeps it alive and
[45:56] that a life it's not something you can
[46:00] see
[46:01] even a germ that you can see with the
[46:03] microscope
[46:05] that's a spirit is that is what gives
[46:08] that life
[46:09] you see so so we are not uh when a real
[46:13] anointed
[46:14] man of god is praying for the sick
[46:17] or casting out devils or preaching the
[46:20] word under the anointing
[46:22] of the holy spirit he is casting away
[46:25] the
[46:25] life the life the evil life the wicked
[46:29] life the pernacious life
[46:31] that dwells in that body
[46:34] or whether it's a micro body
[46:37] infinitesimal
[46:39] or whether it's a growth whatever the
[46:41] size is
[46:42] he is actually coming against and
[46:45] attacking
[46:47] that within the land of that person's
[46:50] being
[46:51] and casting it out in the name of jesus
[46:54] christ
[46:55] and while i'm yet speaking if thou canst
[46:58] believe
[46:59] all things are possible through him
[47:02] amen that rose from the dead is alive
[47:05] forevermore
[47:06] and who said in my name they'll cast out
[47:09] devils
[47:10] and the casting out of devils is the
[47:12] first of all
[47:13] cast the unbelief out of your heart
[47:16] and believe in your heart that all
[47:19] things are possible
[47:20] and that all is well all is well
[47:24] and god will make it so by his word
[47:28] glory to god hallelujah amen
[47:32] tense twelve spies went out
[47:36] ten of them said
[47:40] it's a good land but we can't
[47:44] we cannot take this land oh i don't love
[47:48] cans cannots or can't at all
[47:53] for all things are possible the people
[47:56] are giants

[48:00] gross grasshoppers but thank god for the
[48:03] chosen ones the blessed few uh
[48:06] joshua and caleb who said no

[48:16] those people
[48:17] and you're calling them giants and that
[48:20] we are the grasshoppers
[48:22] but we beg to differ we are the giants
[48:25] spiritually
[48:26] and they are the grasshoppers because we
[48:29] come in the
[48:30] name of jehovah the name of the lord
[48:33] and the battle is not ours but the
[48:36] battle
[48:36] is the lord's i believe they had it

[49:11] you live
[49:12] nonchalant you'll live uh just your
[49:15] normal life going about us
[49:18] if nothing had happened because you're
[49:20] trusting in his mercy and his grace
[49:22] you're trusting in his miracle working
[49:24] power you're
[49:26] trusting in his promises that he will
[49:29] bring you through whatever problems
[49:32] you may be going through yes praise god
[49:36] hallelujah
[49:37] let me say the words of god servant and

[54:06] god forevermore and finally my friends
[54:10] control coming from head office
[54:13] headquarters
[54:14] rather than coming from heaven while
[54:17] they were in that upper room
[54:19] the bible reads and suddenly there
[54:23] came a sound of a mighty
[54:26] rushing wind from heaven and filled a
[54:29] place where
[54:30] they were sitting we need another mighty
[54:33] rushing wind to blow out the chaff
[54:36] that's in the church of god
[54:38] in the house of god in my life in your
[54:41] life
[54:41] in anyone's life that needs a
[54:44] transforming
[54:45] touch from the hand of the living god
[54:48] hallelujah
[54:49] as i am talking more and more about
[54:52] money
[54:53] and profits less rather than being
[54:56] true prophets of the word of god more
[54:59] interested in numbers
[55:01] and the word of god is pushed aside
[55:04] for some kind of an emotional feel good
[55:08] experience yes sir men
[55:11] now my friends going in this
[55:15] church and serving in various offices
[55:19] that has no evidence and surely
[55:22] lack a genuine new birth from the
[55:25] presence
[55:26] of almighty god here it is
[55:29] we also have in the church men
[55:33] beginning to go into the churches
[55:36] dressing and adorning themselves
[55:39] like women and women dressing
[55:42] and adorning themselves like men when
[55:46] god in the book of deuteronomy said
[55:49] it is an abomination for a
[55:53] woman to put on anything that even
[55:56] looks like what a man wears or
[55:59] puts on it's in your bible i'm not
[56:02] making that
[56:03] up that's not my just saying it it's in
[56:06] your bible you can search those words up
[56:09] and you will find it in there oh
[56:12] glory to god hallelujah what's being
[56:15] permitted
[56:17] in the churches women
[56:20] walking into the churches in shorts

[56:27] matter of sex
[56:28] exposure of where
[56:32] some of them taken their cue
[56:36] from those sex goddesses
[56:40] in hollywood and instead
[56:44] of walking in the beauty of holiness
[56:50] they're walking in the beauty of
[56:52] hollywood
[56:54] alex loose lazy
[56:58] lusting church members going to church
[57:02] with
[57:02] eyes filled with adultery and
[57:05] fornication
[57:07] dirty and unclean spirits controlling
[57:11] and possessing them and calling
[57:14] themselves
[57:15] sons and daughters of the living god
[57:18] religion now big business
[57:22] there it is my friends but the church
[57:25] has got to come back

[57:31] you must come back we must
[57:34] restore our homes back back to the land
[57:39] israel must go back to the land
[57:42] that god has given to her
[57:45] the land god has given to the church is
[57:48] the new
[57:49] found land of his word the word of god
[57:52] revealed in this hour god has given that
[57:56] to us
[57:57] hallelujah i tell you in the name of the
[58:00] lord
[58:00] israel's peace policy of
[58:04] uh you know land for peace will never
[58:07] work
[58:08] because it's plainly in the word of god
[58:12] we know there's going to be more that's
[58:14] easy anyone can say that
[58:16] there's going to be more wars upcoming
[58:20] for israel because they have not
[58:23] yet come in to possess all
[58:27] of their prophetic god-given possessions
[58:31] they are only sitting on a small part
[58:34] of it and other parts at the present
[58:37] time
[58:38] are overrun by other
[58:41] nations round about just as much the
[58:44] church have
[58:45] are much of our possession much of god's
[58:48] hidden chosen ones still within
[58:52] those ranks their amount still
[58:55] controlled by denominations
[58:58] but they must be called out by the word
[59:01] of god
[59:02] and the voice of god for this day and
[59:05] for this
[59:05] hour we know clearly friends
[59:09] that even great solomon's temple has got
[59:12] to be restored
[59:14] i want to tell you in the name of the
[59:16] lord i don't know
[59:18] how it's going to be restored oh
[59:21] but god said it would be restored
[59:25] and preparations are being made for
[59:28] its restoration signs of the red heifer
[59:32] are starting to be seen red
[59:36] heifers starting to turn up in israel
[59:39] but under inspection of the eagle eyes
[59:42] of the
[59:43] uh anointed rabbis when they
[59:46] check them there might be a white hair
[59:48] here or a white hair on the tail or
[59:51] a white ear on the ears or a white ear
[59:54] or gray hair
[59:55] somewhere on the body but god will
[59:59] restore back to them the genuine
[1:00:03] 100 percent red heifer
[1:00:06] that will be sacrificed back there again
[1:00:09] within solomon's temple and as they get
[1:00:13] closer and closer to the appearance
[1:00:16] of the real genuine red heifer
[1:00:19] they also see that the sign
[1:00:23] of the messiah the coming of the messiah
[1:00:26] is at hand oh how it ought to trill
[1:00:30] every jewish heart how it ought to trill
[1:00:33] every christian heart how it ought to
[1:00:36] thrill
[1:00:37] every believer's heart to know that we
[1:00:40] are
[1:00:41] living in an hour when modern events
[1:00:45] are being explained and made clear
[1:00:50] by the vindication of
[1:00:53] bible prophecy for the manifestation
[1:00:57] of the word is the interpretation
[1:01:00] of the word all glory to god forevermore
[1:01:04] may the holy spirit take his word
[1:01:07] and unfold it and unveil it
[1:01:10] before our very eyes in the hour
[1:01:13] in which we live praise god hallelujah
[1:01:17] my friends years ago

[1:01:25] the jungles
[1:01:28] i can't say woods those were jungles
[1:01:31] we crossed the river and there we
[1:01:34] cleared some land and started a farm
[1:01:38] but because we could not go
[1:01:41] over as often as we would like to go
[1:01:46] weeks will pass and then we'll go again
[1:01:49] and when we got there
[1:01:50] sometimes there was a problem because
[1:01:53] in the warm humid climates
[1:01:57] of some of these southern nations
[1:02:01] things grow as quickly as you can
[1:02:05] grow quickly as weeds and the weeds will
[1:02:08] come up so
[1:02:09] fast that the land will be taken over
[1:02:13] with weeds
[1:02:14] may i say that's what's happened to
[1:02:16] israel
[1:02:17] that's what's happened to the church
[1:02:19] that may be what happened in your life
[1:02:22] that's maybe what has happened in your
[1:02:25] home
[1:02:26] until it has been taken over by all
[1:02:29] manner of weeds meaning entanglements
[1:02:32] all manner of entanglement has taken
[1:02:35] place
[1:02:37] and here we are in this hour we find it
[1:02:40] friends praise
[1:02:41] god that that is what solomon saw
[1:02:44] how that that or wonderful garden was
[1:02:48] taken over with weeds but when we
[1:02:52] go into the book of jude we
[1:02:55] read where the scriptures but we must
[1:02:58] earnestly contend for the faith that was
[1:03:02] once delivered unto us the faith
[1:03:05] the word of god the original
[1:03:08] that was delivered to us we must fight
[1:03:12] for it
[1:03:12] oh glory to god we must live for it we
[1:03:16] must let god have his way within
[1:03:19] our hearts and within our lives glory to
[1:03:22] god hallelujah
[1:03:23] now we know of course this piece
[1:03:26] of bible imagery uh here
[1:03:30] holds truths and lessons and examples
[1:03:34] for us here today and one of those
[1:03:38] lessons the main lesson
[1:03:40] is spiritual neglect
[1:03:44] always leads to defeat
[1:03:47] and bondage worthiness
[1:03:51] apostasy and backsliding
[1:03:57] let me repeat the lesson
[1:04:00] we're learning here today is that
[1:04:04] spiritual neglect
[1:04:07] leads to defeat
[1:04:10] bondage worldliness
[1:04:13] apostasy and
[1:04:16] backsliding through careless living
[1:04:20] through spiritual laziness the weeds
[1:04:23] creep in
[1:04:25] the message invaded with weeds
[1:04:28] all fought manner of worms
[1:04:31] caterpillars cracker worms pineal worms
[1:04:35] bugs eating at their roots
[1:04:39] to kill a tree eating at the foundation
[1:04:43] of the church of god for this hour
[1:04:46] yes sir oh glory to god think of that
[1:04:49] naughty problem that situation that
[1:04:53] israel has
[1:04:54] her ancestral lands now
[1:04:57] occupied by others lands which
[1:05:01] god took our father abraham
[1:05:04] and placed him there and said look as
[1:05:08] far as your eye could see from from the
[1:05:11] sea
[1:05:12] here till that way it all belongs to you
[1:05:16] and your seed abraham forever
[1:05:20] glory to god and while israel
[1:05:24] through her disobedience to god
[1:05:27] was temporarily driven out of her land
[1:05:32] tested and tried and as it were walked
[1:05:35] through her
[1:05:36] fiery furnace of the wilderness of zion
[1:05:40] and found herself in a
[1:05:44] state of a holocaust millions
[1:05:47] perished but then god
[1:05:51] said when that was over he'd gather them
[1:05:54] back to their land again upon the wings
[1:05:58] of eagle slain now you must understand
[1:06:01] back then the largest bird the prophet
[1:06:03] could visualize was an
[1:06:05] eagle he could not say that it was
[1:06:08] planes
[1:06:09] but but but all he could call it was
[1:06:11] eagles
[1:06:12] but we know in our day god brought them
[1:06:16] back from the east the western north and
[1:06:18] the south
[1:06:19] and brought them back to their own land
[1:06:22] on the
[1:06:22] wings of great eagles
[1:06:26] speaking iron eagles airplanes
[1:06:31] brought them back to their land
[1:06:34] hallelujah
[1:06:35] and their flag the six-point flag of
[1:06:38] david is flying over their land they're
[1:06:41] back
[1:06:42] there here and there again by god's
[1:06:45] promise
[1:06:46] of his word oh praise god
[1:06:49] and she must do what she has to do
[1:06:53] but in god's time she must take
[1:06:56] back the land that rightfully belongs to
[1:07:00] her
[1:07:00] i know it would be easy but she must
[1:07:04] take it back
[1:07:06] amen she knows her rights
[1:07:09] then she'll know how to take
[1:07:12] a genuine stand by the word of god
[1:07:17] hallelujah there's always
[1:07:20] similar situations friends when the
[1:07:23] enemy armies of satan
[1:07:26] have come and invaded and
[1:07:29] occupied
[1:07:32] our great land of faith
[1:07:37] amen satan has even invaded this
[1:07:41] faith that once did was delivered unto
[1:07:44] the
[1:07:44] saints and took away our spiritual land
[1:07:48] and gave to us three gods
[1:07:52] gave to us father son and holy ghost
[1:07:55] baptism
[1:07:56] gave to us half-dressed women
[1:07:59] gave to us a media tricks instead of
[1:08:03] the only mediator between god and man
[1:08:06] which is christ jesus gave to us
[1:08:09] many other unscriptural
[1:08:13] ungodly things that are not
[1:08:16] even found in the bible he has stripped
[1:08:19] it away
[1:08:20] taken away and stolen even in our
[1:08:23] individual eyes

[1:08:38] devil has stolen it away from within the
