[0:00] [Music]
[0:14] glory and praise be to god
[0:17] here we are
[0:18] on another
[0:21] wednesday evening
[0:24] to raise our hearts in worship and
[0:27] praise to god
[0:29] we give him thanks
[0:31] for bringing us through this
[0:35] week
[0:36] protecting us leading us and guiding us
[0:39] may the lord certainly encourage our
[0:42] hearts
[0:43] as we look
[0:44] into the perfect law of liberty praise
[0:48] his wonderful
[0:50] and precious name
[0:52] amen
[0:54] now as we
[0:56] go in the presence of the lord
[0:59] we would
[1:00] love to read from revelation chapter
[1:03] 3
[1:04] reading verse 17.
[1:09] because thou
[1:12] i am rich and increased with goods
[1:17] and have need of nothing
[1:21] and knows thou not
[1:24] that thou art wretched miserable naked
[1:29] and blind
[1:31] our dear gracious loving heavenly father
[1:35] with joy we draw night to thy august
[1:39] throne
[1:41] may the holy spirit father quicken us
[1:44] together
[1:46] bless the heart of all the saints
[1:49] that are watching and partaking
[1:52] around the world
[1:54] near and far
[1:57] may you minister as you
[2:00] reach out
[2:02] to call out you're elected of this last
[2:05] day
[2:07] for when the last one comes in
[2:10] the rapture goes up
[2:13] and we are trusting father
[2:16] in every
[2:17] service
[2:19] in every
[2:20] point of time space on our walk
[2:25] that you will bring us into contact
[2:29] with that
[2:30] lost
[2:31] seed
[2:32] lost and
[2:34] the last of the lost
[2:36] may you draw them into your kingdom
[2:40] and your name be glorified
[2:44] and a great meeting in the air
[2:47] when we are there together again
[2:50] giving praise to your name
[2:53] thank you father
[2:55] glory to your marvelous name
[2:58] in the name of our beloved
[3:01] lord and
[3:02] savior
[3:04] jesus christ
[3:06] amen
[3:09] tonight
[3:11] i'm talking about the danger
[3:14] of self-diagnosis
[3:18] well we've just come through
[3:21] uh
[3:22] two years of
[3:24] the covet plague
[3:27] and
[3:28] we have all been affected by it in some
[3:32] way or the other
[3:35] physically mentally emotionally
[3:38] or socially or family
[3:42] situations whatever we have been
[3:44] influenced in some way shape or form
[3:50] and during this period of time
[3:55] a lot of there has been a search
[3:58] for a cure
[4:01] something that will
[4:03] end
[4:04] the reign
[4:06] of this plague
[4:08] in the bodies and minds of men
[4:12] scientists have searched
[4:15] and searched
[4:17] and researched
[4:19] until they were able
[4:21] to find
[4:23] a vaccine
[4:25] medicine
[4:27] something that will be able
[4:29] to stay or to hold back the onslaught of
[4:34] this evil thing
[4:36] but during this time
[4:40] there have been a lot of people
[4:43] who have thought they
[4:45] did not need science they did not need a
[4:47] scientist they did not need a vaccine
[4:50] they did not need any medicine
[4:52] and so
[4:54] they decided
[4:56] that they would uh
[5:00] prescribe something for themselves
[5:04] they will find their own cure
[5:09] and any
[5:11] knowledgeable any doctor will tell you
[5:15] as any lawyer will
[5:17] only a fool
[5:19] will take himself to be his own lawyer
[5:23] and so is it
[5:25] that the doctors will prescribe the
[5:28] scientists will recommend
[5:31] but yet there are
[5:33] multitudes of people
[5:35] that decide they don't need the wisdom
[5:39] they don't need the
[5:41] hours of research they don't need the
[5:44] knowledge
[5:46] they can
[5:48] self-diagnose
[5:50] they can prescribe for themselves
[5:54] they can find the answer for themselves
[5:57] so they don't need any help
[6:01] i know of one person
[6:05] that decided to self-diagnose
[6:09] and it wasn't long after
[6:12] the man was dead
[6:16] there have been other cases
[6:19] where people have self-diagnosed
[6:22] and find
[6:23] found themselves with worst ailments and
[6:27] worse conditions
[6:29] on their lives
[6:32] so there is great danger
[6:36] in a person
[6:38] self-diagnosing
[6:41] self-prescribing
[6:42] and not waiting for those with the
[6:45] knowledge
[6:46] to do that
[6:48] but here tonight we are not speaking on
[6:52] natural
[6:53] self-diagnosis
[6:56] we're speaking on the
[6:59] self-diagnosis
[7:01] of the church
[7:03] the church's
[7:05] spiritual estimate
[7:07] of herself
[7:10] so full of pride
[7:13] so
[7:15] uh caught up with her own
[7:18] narcissism her own
[7:20] uh
[7:22] her own
[7:23] estimate of her beauty and attraction
[7:28] the church looks into the mirror
[7:32] and
[7:33] comes back with her own diagnosis
[7:36] not what
[7:38] she would be told but what she thinks
[7:40] about herself
[7:43] and so here in revelation chapter 3
[7:47] verse 17
[7:49] the church gives her own
[7:52] diagnosis
[7:55] and
[7:56] god responds by saying yes
[8:00] you have a diagnosis of yourself
[8:03] but we can't trust that
[8:07] let me do a diagnosis
[8:09] which we will talk about later but here
[8:12] our scripture picks it up
[8:15] because thou says
[8:18] you see they were speaking they were
[8:19] giving their diagnosis
[8:22] of their spiritual
[8:24] condition
[8:26] they were saying to themselves
[8:29] we have now become the mouthpiece of god
[8:33] amen
[8:35] romans 12 6 tells you
[8:38] that we are not to be wise as the
[8:40] scripture says in your own eyes
[8:44] be not wise in thy own eyes
[8:48] so man many times will think that way
[8:52] but we are not to be wise in our own
[8:54] wise
[8:56] and paul the great apostle says
[8:58] they that compare themselves
[9:01] among themselves are not wise
[9:06] certainly as we look into the word of
[9:08] god
[9:10] we find out friends
[9:13] that
[9:14] the church says that she speaks for god
[9:17] but god
[9:19] says no you're not
[9:21] that is your estimate
[9:24] of your self
[9:26] see
[9:27] the leodysian church age
[9:30] the edition church says
[9:32] i am rich
[9:34] i am increased with goods
[9:38] i have need of
[9:40] nothing
[9:42] hallelujah
[9:43] i am rich
[9:45] i am wealthy
[9:46] i'm prosperous i'm powerful
[9:50] oh praise god
[9:52] he is boasting
[9:55] in the face of god and his word
[9:59] when in the
[10:01] epistle of james chapter 2 verses 5 to 7
[10:06] the bible says heart
[10:09] my beloved brethren
[10:11] had not god chosen the poor of this
[10:15] world
[10:18] uh have you not has he not promised
[10:22] in faith that they are heirs of the
[10:24] kingdom
[10:25] which he has promised to them
[10:30] but you have despised the poor
[10:33] do not rich man oppress you
[10:37] and draw you
[10:39] before the judgment seats
[10:43] oh my
[10:45] see they're blaspheming this worthy holy
[10:48] name
[10:49] by which they're called amen now by no
[10:54] means
[10:55] am i or anyone else suggesting
[10:59] that rich men on women cannot be
[11:02] spiritual that is not what i'm saying
[11:05] but most of the time
[11:07] the heady
[11:09] wine
[11:10] of uh
[11:12] uh
[11:13] of wealth
[11:15] and prosperity
[11:16] seems to throw
[11:18] most people off kilter
[11:21] and they draw away from god draw away
[11:25] from his spirit
[11:26] move out of his presence
[11:29] and begin to despise the poor the
[11:32] uneducated
[11:34] they have no patience
[11:37] with those who they can't see eye to eye
[11:40] with
[11:41] the virtues seem to pour out of them and
[11:44] be gone
[11:45] and they seem to want to achieve their
[11:49] own ends now
[11:51] by themselves
[11:53] and uh
[11:54] without any
[11:56] contact whatsoever
[11:58] with those kinds
[12:00] so-called of so-called people
[12:04] they're very very few
[12:06] rich men and women today
[12:09] they're actually spiritual
[12:12] and humble enough
[12:14] to listen to god's word
[12:17] through the bible through his servant's
[12:19] true nature through
[12:21] his voice amen yes sir
[12:25] and when we look at the true church god
[12:28] already prophesied
[12:30] that the true church will actually be
[12:32] dominated mainly by the poor
[12:38] it'll be
[12:39] taken up with a lot of those that are
[12:43] poor
[12:45] now if the church then becomes so full
[12:49] of wealth
[12:50] we can only see what the scripture said
[12:53] ichabod
[12:56] is written across her
[12:58] portals
[13:00] the glory of god has departed
[13:03] as much as the wealth pours in the glory
[13:06] departs from it
[13:08] talk about wealth in this modern church
[13:10] today
[13:12] there has never been so much wealth as
[13:15] we see around
[13:17] beautiful sanctuaries
[13:20] being built
[13:22] and they're built at such a furious rate
[13:27] multiplied churches everywhere
[13:30] costing millions of dollars
[13:34] this created the situations where
[13:36] denominations are vying uh competing
[13:40] with each other to see who will build
[13:43] the most unique
[13:45] the the most
[13:46] attractive eye-catching
[13:49] uh
[13:50] buildings and structures
[13:53] out there
[13:54] yes
[13:56] lovely yes
[13:57] oh my something else
[14:00] and they build beautiful education
[14:04] centers
[14:05] estimated at millions and millions of
[14:08] dollars
[14:10] and they only use the building
[14:13] for
[14:14] a few hours a week
[14:17] maybe more than that
[14:19] but uh they just use it for a short
[14:22] period of time
[14:25] and we see
[14:27] that they expect to educate
[14:29] the children
[14:32] and give them religious teaching
[14:36] uh and take away the
[14:38] uh
[14:39] teaching of that the parents
[14:42] should be able to provide
[14:45] they become the religious kindergarten
[14:48] and the ones to rear and mold
[14:52] the minds and hearts
[14:54] of the children
[14:57] the day
[14:59] and so money
[15:01] has poured into the church
[15:03] instead of god's might and power
[15:07] money
[15:08] has taken over their minds
[15:11] instead of the revelation of the mystery
[15:13] of god
[15:15] and is poured into these different
[15:19] denominations
[15:21] who now own stocks
[15:25] and bonds
[15:28] and factories
[15:30] and some even own oil wells
[15:35] they're not depending on god anymore
[15:38] depend on our own wisdom
[15:40] our own ability
[15:43] to be able to maneuver
[15:46] and do
[15:47] a business
[15:49] and things of that nature nothing is
[15:51] wrong with business but they are doing
[15:55] that
[15:56] and they are using the power of that
[16:00] to
[16:01] forget the power of god in the presence
[16:04] of the holy spirit
[16:07] yes sir
[16:09] owning factories
[16:12] owning
[16:13] oil wells
[16:15] owning insurance companies
[16:19] amen
[16:20] and pouring money
[16:23] into welfare
[16:25] and charities
[16:28] of that nature
[16:30] pouring money
[16:32] into
[16:33] retirement funds everywhere
[16:37] that sounds good
[16:39] but it becomes a trap
[16:41] and a snare
[16:43] to many ministers and believers
[16:46] because if there's a minister
[16:48] and after a while he begins to see holes
[16:52] he begins to see openings
[16:55] in the fundamentals
[16:57] the foundations
[16:59] of what he was taught
[17:01] and he begins to see the truth in god's
[17:04] word
[17:05] and wants to break away
[17:07] you see he becomes trapped
[17:10] by that pension fund
[17:13] that they had established in his name
[17:16] in that particular denomination
[17:19] because if he leaves the denomination
[17:22] he'd lose a suspension fund
[17:25] they'll support him no more
[17:27] he'll lose what they were that they
[17:30] should be giving to him
[17:32] oh my friends
[17:34] that poor
[17:36] fellow
[17:38] is then trapped
[17:40] into that situation
[17:42] where he will be put out
[17:44] as a beggar in the streets
[17:48] and then he decides i'd better stay
[17:52] with my denomination
[17:55] for all the years i've put in
[17:58] uh so be able to reap or to receive
[18:02] my
[18:03] attention
[18:05] and so
[18:06] he yields to the pressure
[18:08] of that pressure group
[18:10] that had this
[18:12] trap or snare
[18:14] set up
[18:15] for him
[18:17] friends
[18:18] we're living in the last age
[18:22] and we know it's the last age
[18:24] for israel is back in her homeland
[18:29] they're getting themselves ready
[18:32] for the third temple
[18:35] coming of the red heifer
[18:37] watching for the appearing
[18:40] of elijah again to them
[18:43] and then the messiah oh
[18:46] their hearts
[18:47] yearn their hearts are filled with
[18:50] expectation and joy
[18:53] for the gentile dispensation
[18:56] is coming to an end
[18:58] and as
[19:00] the gentiles go out
[19:02] the jews come into power
[19:05] naturally and spiritually
[19:08] coming into power amen
[19:10] and we believe
[19:12] and teach
[19:13] that jesus is really coming
[19:17] for us for a rapture
[19:19] to take his waiting bride away
[19:22] hallelujah
[19:23] and then he'll go out and talk to his
[19:26] brethren
[19:27] my praise god hallelujah oh
[19:31] something is wrong
[19:34] when
[19:35] they claim jesus is coming soon
[19:38] but they're building and building bigger
[19:41] bigger
[19:42] richer better everything else and yet
[19:45] claiming there's going to be a rapture
[19:47] we're leaving soon but they're putting
[19:50] down massive structures everywhere
[19:54] contrary to their confession
[19:58] oh my
[20:01] religion today
[20:04] has come into
[20:06] a condition
[20:08] of making itself transforming itself
[20:12] into big business
[20:15] using religion
[20:18] a great
[20:20] uh
[20:21] industries
[20:23] have raised up
[20:26] from religion
[20:28] oh praise god
[20:31] something is wrong
[20:32] somewhere
[20:34] they act and do and live
[20:37] as if the coming of the lord is hundreds
[20:39] of years off
[20:41] so they have enough time to to do all
[20:44] this building and buying and selling and
[20:47] and uh
[20:48] making of records and books and
[20:51] histories and uh building up great
[20:54] profiles and whatever because back of
[20:58] their mind with their lips they're
[21:01] saying jesus is coming soon but with
[21:04] their hands their works they are proving
[21:08] that they
[21:09] maybe he's coming hundreds of years from
[21:11] now but friends
[21:13] they're those of us who believe jesus is
[21:16] coming soon
[21:19] it may be morning night at noon
[21:22] but the coming of the lord is right here
[21:25] with us
[21:26] and we want to give him praise glory and
[21:29] to acknowledge the divine presence
[21:32] among us
[21:33] now it's our departure with him
[21:36] to live forevermore
[21:38] is divine presence
[21:40] but when we look what do we see
[21:44] religion has become big business
[21:47] with business managers
[21:51] and financial managers
[21:55] do you think this is what god wants and
[21:57] god desires
[21:58] of the church of the living god
[22:02] my friends
[22:04] consider in the word of god
[22:07] what about the book of acts
[22:09] did you did this teach us that the
[22:11] apostles
[22:12] force trained those those seven deacons
[22:17] train them as business managers first
[22:21] before
[22:22] they can handle the finances of the
[22:26] apostolic church in those primitive
[22:30] times
[22:31] was it so my friends but the bible tells
[22:35] us they sought for men
[22:38] full of the holy ghost
[22:40] not full of finance but full of the holy
[22:43] ghost
[22:44] men full of the holy ghost
[22:46] and of faith to serve the lord
[22:49] hallelujah amen surely my friends
[22:53] god is saying to them you say
[22:57] i am wealthy
[22:59] you say
[23:00] this is your diagnosis
[23:03] that i am rich
[23:05] and i'm so rich
[23:08] that i have need
[23:10] of nothing
[23:11] i don't need nothing they don't need
[23:13] god's help anymore they don't need god's
[23:17] presence with them anymore
[23:20] they just want to be religious
[23:22] they want to be thought of as good
[23:25] people that that helps the poor don't i
[23:27] do this don't i do that don't i do the
[23:30] other oh
[23:31] but my friends genuine faith
[23:34] genuine desire
[23:36] to walk with god and to serve him in the
[23:39] fullness and the power of his
[23:41] resurrection
[23:42] the air is filled and polluted
[23:45] filled everywhere
[23:47] with religious radio programs
[23:52] filled with television programs
[23:57] all manner of church
[23:59] endeavors
[24:01] all manner of programs
[24:03] and various plans
[24:05] costing millions and millions of dollars
[24:09] selling this and selling that and this
[24:12] is on sale well it costs money to
[24:14] produce so we have to sell it for so
[24:16] much
[24:17] and and sales religious sales are going
[24:21] on
[24:22] everywhere and wealth is pouring into
[24:27] the modern church and the membership is
[24:31] increasing
[24:32] along with the masses of money that is
[24:36] coming in and yet the work of evangelism
[24:40] and the work my friends of reaching the
[24:43] loss at any cost is not being done
[24:48] oh
[24:49] look into god's word and see what we we
[24:52] can see here
[24:54] amen oh my friends the apostles did more
[24:58] work that they can ever dream or think
[25:01] of without any money without any human
[25:07] might without any kind of of influence
[25:11] of man that did it under the power of
[25:14] the holy spirit for this not by
[25:17] financial might mental power mental
[25:21] might but by my spirit saith the lord
[25:24] god hallelujah amen now we are ending up
[25:31] with multitudes of paid preachers
[25:35] paid assistance
[25:38] paid ministers of music
[25:42] paid ministers of education
[25:45] paid youth leaders paid choirs paid
[25:49] custodians paid programs and paid people
[25:54] to produce uh dramatic sets and people
[25:59] to
[26:00] be
[26:01] masters of of entertainment and
[26:04] programming and that like
[26:07] all costing millions and millions of
[26:10] dollars and they justify it in the name
[26:15] of the lord amen yes my friends
[26:19] even their power is decreasing while
[26:22] they increase on that side
[26:25] their power is decreasing with god
[26:28] and yes indeed the church is rich and
[26:32] richer than she ever was
[26:36] but the power of god is not there
[26:39] for the glory is departed
[26:42] the dove of peace has taken her flight
[26:45] no more
[26:47] oh
[26:48] is the holy spirit dealing with the
[26:51] modern church
[26:53] he has come to be dealing now with the
[26:56] individuals
[26:58] that may be in the midst
[27:00] of those churches
[27:02] god moving by his spirit
[27:05] but not by the amount of money
[27:08] that you have
[27:10] absolutely
[27:11] god is not moving
[27:14] by the trained talents
[27:16] that may be in the church
[27:18] but is moving by the gifts of the spirit
[27:22] that he has implanted
[27:24] within the hearts of his believers
[27:27] the world
[27:29] and the church
[27:31] is consumed
[27:34] with a diabolical
[27:36] urge and hunger
[27:39] for money
[27:41] seems like the god mammon
[27:44] has taken over the minds of men
[27:48] and the churches
[27:50] have gone all out to get as much money
[27:53] as they can
[27:55] and as much membership
[27:57] as they can
[27:59] but now they have refined
[28:03] their targeting
[28:06] they have developed systems
[28:09] plans
[28:10] programs
[28:12] and pits
[28:13] to be able to target the wealthy
[28:16] the rich
[28:18] and those that have spheres of influence
[28:22] and everywhere
[28:24] they're doing every possible thing
[28:28] as women of today are doing
[28:30] to make themselves even more attractive
[28:34] and
[28:35] to make themselves so appealing
[28:39] that the rich
[28:40] will
[28:41] feel proud
[28:43] to walk into a proper church
[28:47] that is well decorated
[28:51] beautiful
[28:52] in its exterior
[28:54] the shape of the church
[28:56] the dress the look of the church
[28:59] the paints they the
[29:01] carpets the beautiful tiles
[29:04] they're all
[29:06] something that will
[29:07] infuse and influence the senses of man
[29:12] that is their visual atmosphere
[29:15] that they want
[29:16] when god deliberately let the lord jesus
[29:19] be born in a manger full of straw
[29:23] and the smell of human
[29:25] of animal uh excrement
[29:28] the god who allowed all the holy spirit
[29:32] to come down in the upper room
[29:36] uh
[29:37] in a humble atmosphere
[29:39] man unlearned and untrained
[29:42] god knowing that will deliberately
[29:45] throw off
[29:47] some of those whose minds are set in one
[29:50] direction
[29:51] and only
[29:53] the humble
[29:54] only those who are willing to walk god's
[29:57] way
[29:58] can become overcomers to overcome that
[30:02] and still walk in the light my friends
[30:05] oh
[30:06] instead we find they go after the rich
[30:12] they want their church to have the most
[30:14] cultured
[30:17] the best dressed the best
[30:20] uh those with the best manners
[30:23] and talents
[30:25] in the church
[30:26] oh
[30:27] those who have worldly prestige and
[30:31] standing in the society
[30:34] this is what is the desire of the modern
[30:36] church today
[30:38] that's what we can see
[30:40] amen
[30:41] oh can't they understand friend
[30:44] that if wealth is they
[30:46] is the measuring stick of who is a real
[30:49] believer and a member
[30:52] then my friends i tell you then the
[30:55] world already has god
[30:57] because they're more rich
[30:59] sinners out there rich more rich
[31:02] unbelievers
[31:04] uh that you can number on your you can
[31:06] you can't without number
[31:08] so
[31:09] those that are in the church are much
[31:12] fewer than those that are outside and if
[31:15] wealth was the measure then the world
[31:17] already has god
[31:19] but that is not the case
[31:21] because the word told us already
[31:25] clearly my friends
[31:27] that thou says i'm rich
[31:31] thou says
[31:33] i am increased with goods
[31:38] amen
[31:39] but listen friends
[31:41] you may have natural goods but you don't
[31:43] have the spiritual goods you may have
[31:46] natural wealth but you don't have the
[31:49] spiritual will
[31:51] oh you laugh at that you market that oh
[31:54] you can go talking about spiritual
[31:56] wealth but you don't have money you
[31:57] don't have position you don't have power
[32:00] you don't have these natural things
[32:02] listen to the real believers those
[32:04] things are good and god bless you if god
[32:08] has given them to you
[32:10] but the most important thing if we lose
[32:13] all else we don't want to lose our
[32:16] salvation we don't want to lose our
[32:19] revelation and understanding of god's
[32:22] word we don't want to lose our spiritual
[32:25] sight we don't want to lose the
[32:27] spiritual riches of god to pour out of
[32:30] us we're not here to try
[32:33] uh
[32:34] catching or trying to get a drink of
[32:36] water by using a basket we are here my
[32:41] friends to drink from the springs of
[32:44] salvation the refreshing waters of the
[32:47] word of the living god
[32:49] amen
[32:51] hallelujah
[32:53] look at this
[32:54] let us consider
[32:56] this last day leo decian boast
[33:00] a lukewarm church
[33:03] a church which god said i spit you out
[33:06] of my mouth
[33:08] and yet they're boasting
[33:11] but we are rich
[33:13] thinking that that will make god want to
[33:16] accept her
[33:18] and to have a union with her no
[33:22] god doesn't want that kind of a church
[33:25] with that kind of a character
[33:27] he wants a church with a cat of christ
[33:31] that will stand firmly with him
[33:34] a real help meet of the word that will
[33:38] stand by the word of god and walk with
[33:41] him step by step amen
[33:45] yes friends
[33:46] hallelujah
[33:47] they want influential men
[33:51] in their society
[33:53] in their church
[33:55] and they
[33:56] put them in the positions of influence
[33:58] and power in the church
[34:02] not knowing
[34:04] you have read in your newspapers you
[34:06] have seen it on the internet
[34:08] some of the wealthiest richest men in
[34:11] the world
[34:14] caught
[34:15] and caught up
[34:17] with wife swapping
[34:21] the human trafficking
[34:26] drug
[34:28] dealings
[34:30] all manner of sexual
[34:32] immorality on their private yachts their
[34:35] private jets their private islands their
[34:39] great big resorts
[34:41] oh the world looks up to them
[34:44] but my friends rotten to the core liars
[34:49] cheats
[34:50] killers murderers and everything else
[34:54] all
[34:56] bands of children
[34:59] that they bring into their midst to
[35:01] defile to corrupt
[35:03] to spy and sell
[35:07] young men young women
[35:10] caught into their nets of evil
[35:12] everywhere
[35:14] prostitution oh
[35:17] taken to a place where they try to make
[35:20] it acceptable to the world
[35:22] and these modern day prostitutes to
[35:25] natural things
[35:27] they try to make them admire
[35:31] when they my friends
[35:33] live such a corrupt life
[35:35] contrary to god's word
[35:38] amen
[35:40] lying stealing gambling
[35:43] filled with drug addiction
[35:45] needles sticking
[35:47] using all manner of chemical agents
[35:50] within their lives and within their body
[35:53] amen and then the church goes on
[35:56] claiming
[35:58] oh what a fine generation this is
[36:02] what a blessed generation this is
[36:06] look how prosperous they are
[36:09] oh
[36:10] if we can have believers become
[36:13] prosperous like that
[36:16] if they can present that kind of
[36:19] oh my friends what a lie of satan
[36:23] and many times they'll they'll pick up a
[36:26] bible holding it in their hands
[36:29] to try to influence others to think
[36:34] that they are such
[36:36] christians and believers
[36:38] when they're rotten to the core
[36:41] and the church
[36:42] the conservative church
[36:45] blinded by the
[36:47] things of the world instead of being
[36:49] able to discern the revelation of the
[36:52] word of god they're blinded by these
[36:54] things with their sea with their natural
[36:58] eyes
[37:00] the entire church has become defiled
[37:05] claiming all these fine wonderful things
[37:09] and yet
[37:11] the churches
[37:14] are not responsive
[37:16] to the hunger and the cry of the lost
[37:19] that is out there
[37:21] and they
[37:23] have turned the church over
[37:26] instead of turning the church to the
[37:28] hands of the great physician
[37:31] to prayer to fasting
[37:33] to the power of god
[37:35] they have turned the church over to the
[37:37] doctors
[37:39] they have turned the people
[37:41] instead of casting evil away from the
[37:44] people
[37:45] they have turned the people over to the
[37:47] psychiatrists
[37:50] of such a manner yes sir
[37:54] talk about being and yet they speak of
[37:56] being spiritually rich
[37:59] amen
[38:01] but we know
[38:02] from their actions and attitude they may
[38:05] be naturally rich but they are
[38:08] spiritually bankrupt of the word of god
[38:11] and the revelation of the holy spirit
[38:15] hallelujah
[38:17] just look at the people who pass by
[38:20] just look
[38:22] go to the corner as one prophet said
[38:25] he said i stood
[38:27] by the by way
[38:30] and i watched as the people pass by
[38:34] oh
[38:36] is it nothing to you he said
[38:38] who passed by
[38:40] of what jesus christ has done for you is
[38:44] it nothing to you but today it seems as
[38:48] if it's nothing to the people
[38:51] they can dismiss him they can dismiss
[38:53] his serpents they can dismiss the word
[38:56] they can dismiss everything because they
[38:58] look on it as foolishness ignorance and
[39:01] uh
[39:02] you know it's rough it's crude it's not
[39:04] cultured it's not smart it's not wise
[39:07] it's not polished it's this is not the
[39:09] kind of thing it it ought to be
[39:11] beautiful not to be nice it's not to be
[39:14] uh this way it ought to be structured it
[39:16] ought to be systematic
[39:19] such ways like that you know
[39:22] and they miss the entire
[39:25] plan of god
[39:26] amen just look at the people
[39:31] all claiming to be christians
[39:34] but they're not even their natural
[39:36] appearance
[39:38] proves
[39:39] that they're not christians
[39:41] and they are not real christians
[39:44] amen
[39:45] look at how they act
[39:47] look at the places they go to
[39:50] look at the friends they have
[39:53] look at their tastes
[39:55] look at their desires
[39:57] look at what ah they're pulled by
[40:01] instead of pulling in the presence of
[40:03] god they're pulling the presence of
[40:04] other things they're not contrary to the
[40:07] word of the living god amen
[40:11] and you cannot see
[40:13] the real evidence of the holy spirit
[40:16] in their lives are upon their hearts
[40:19] you cannot see it at all
[40:22] amen
[40:24] so
[40:25] fundamental churches to death claiming
[40:28] that they are filled with millions of
[40:30] people
[40:32] that are truly saved and even so-called
[40:37] filled
[40:38] yet when you go what do you see
[40:42] you see
[40:43] these so-called spirit-filled women
[40:47] going around
[40:48] with their hair chopped off when the
[40:51] bible says the long hair on a woman
[40:55] is her glory amen
[40:58] they wear shorts
[41:01] slacks going to church
[41:03] amen
[41:04] wearing shorts and slacks
[41:08] halter tops
[41:10] and briefs
[41:12] and bikinis
[41:14] and all
[41:15] painted face jezebel to the word of god
[41:19] as god calls it amen
[41:22] and refuse to be adorned
[41:26] in modest
[41:28] apparel
[41:30] they
[41:31] believe it's
[41:33] fantastic to flaunt
[41:35] their
[41:36] sexuality
[41:38] to be able to be attractive to the world
[41:43] i know
[41:44] they don't set the styles
[41:46] those styles are set in places like
[41:49] hollywood and france and the catwalks of
[41:52] uh modeling and stuff like that it's set
[41:55] by that but they have to accept those
[41:58] styles
[41:59] and live
[42:01] and dress themselves by those so-called
[42:05] styles that they have
[42:07] but the scripture tells us
[42:11] that if a man lusts after a woman
[42:15] just look upon her with lust desire and
[42:18] that kind of a motive he has already
[42:21] committed adultery within his heart
[42:25] and if the woman deliberately dresses
[42:28] with all manner of such appeal and
[42:31] sexuality
[42:32] she becomes a partner in crime
[42:35] a partner in sin
[42:38] amen even though she be unaware yet god
[42:42] will hold both are comfortable in his
[42:45] divine in his sight
[42:48] this kind of preaching
[42:51] seems to people today to be
[42:53] old-fashioned
[42:55] they don't want to hear this kind of a
[42:57] preaching
[42:58] they didn't listen to noah
[43:01] they did not listen
[43:03] to all the prophets of patriarchs
[43:07] the apostles in the bible
[43:10] they called paul a woman hater
[43:13] called brother branham
[43:15] a woman hater
[43:17] they don't realize
[43:20] it's not them that said it it's written
[43:22] in the word of god
[43:24] thou shalt not put on a garment
[43:27] that pertains to a man
[43:30] for it's in the word of the living god
[43:32] hallelujah amen but you are dead wrong
[43:37] when you don't accept god's truth and
[43:40] you take the way of the world
[43:42] bible forbids you to cut your hair off
[43:47] the bible forbids you from wearing man's
[43:51] apparel amen
[43:53] god gave a command and said you are to
[43:56] wear your hair long and you are to wear
[43:59] it
[44:00] amen
[44:01] for your glory and for his glory amen
[44:06] for your here is your covering
[44:08] not some hat on your head or cut off
[44:11] your hair and then put on a hat no he
[44:15] says you grow the hair long for the long
[44:18] year is your beauty and your covering
[44:23] hallelujah because when you cut off your
[44:25] hair you are giving the signal that that
[44:29] you're not coming under any authority of
[44:31] god or any man but you are under your
[44:35] own leadership and your own authority
[44:39] and you don't care about taking any
[44:41] man's job any man's position
[44:45] or anything else like that but i want to
[44:48] urge you tonight repent and turn to back
[44:51] to god come back to your original
[44:53] position and be
[44:55] who god wants you to be he made you
[44:58] female not male and he made the male
[45:02] male
[45:02] not female let us go back to the
[45:05] original and be who god wants us to be
[45:09] amen it's bad enough
[45:13] but not only
[45:15] is a society invaded by these kinds of
[45:19] spirits
[45:21] the pulpits have become invaded
[45:24] positions of power in the spiritual
[45:27] realm have become invaded
[45:30] yes my friends and so it's everywhere
[45:35] when god never ordained any woman to
[45:38] preach
[45:39] or teach or usurp authority
[45:43] over men
[45:44] yet
[45:45] the very church that claims it obeys god
[45:50] is ordaining women
[45:52] placing them in those positions
[45:55] contrary to the very word of god not
[45:58] listening to what god says to them and
[46:01] doing the total opposite to the word of
[46:03] god
[46:04] amen
[46:06] woman cannot possibly have a place in
[46:08] the five-fold ministry for god himself
[46:11] said i
[46:12] will not suffer a woman to teach
[46:15] nerd to usurp authority no sir
[46:19] hallelujah ephesians chapter four
[46:21] absolutely you're not to do it and
[46:24] sisters i encourage you listen to the
[46:27] word of god
[46:29] listen to the simple bible
[46:32] oh my yes i tell you somebody
[46:36] has made a mistake
[46:39] somebody got blinded and went off from
[46:43] the correct
[46:45] direction of god's word
[46:47] somebody allow themselves to be fooled
[46:51] absolutely
[46:53] you better wake up before it's too late
[46:57] wake up
[46:58] before let your eyes be opened my
[47:01] friends
[47:02] you see because satan has attempted
[47:06] and is attempting
[47:08] to fool the daughters the sister the bro
[47:12] the sisters the women of today just like
[47:15] he fooled eve back in the garden of eden
[47:19] he is bringing his evil trick his
[47:22] sinister lies bringing them on the scene
[47:25] again
[47:27] oh
[47:28] you say
[47:29] but uh brother simon i have need of
[47:31] nothing
[47:33] you may have needs
[47:36] your church may not be the biggest
[47:39] you may need this you may need that you
[47:41] may need the other but i have needed
[47:44] nothing i've got everything
[47:46] you can that's okay you can boast about
[47:48] that you can talk about it but i have
[47:51] him
[47:52] amen hallelujah listen i have need of
[47:56] nothing
[47:58] oh
[47:58] praise god in other words you're telling
[48:01] me i have everything
[48:03] i have everything and so uh you think
[48:07] you have everything and yet while you
[48:09] are saying that
[48:11] you lack the presence of god amen you're
[48:15] saying
[48:16] i got everything now i i don't need
[48:18] anything more
[48:19] i i don't need any more of that word of
[48:23] god because i i got everything already
[48:27] that i need that is your diagnosis that
[48:31] is your theory that is your estimate of
[48:35] yourself but god says noise down not
[48:39] you're miserable you're wretched you're
[48:41] naked you're blind but the the
[48:45] the part of it that is so bad is that
[48:48] you don't even know it because you feel
[48:51] so self-confident you believe that you
[48:54] know
[48:55] when you don't know and you're contrary
[48:58] to the word of god what a complacent
[49:01] last dead church that figures that she
[49:04] has it all
[49:06] amen
[49:08] figures that she has the revelation
[49:10] figures that she have the power
[49:13] she figures that she has the truth and
[49:15] the bible says and knows them not
[49:19] you don't have it whatsoever
[49:21] they wrote their manuals
[49:24] base their faith on their manuals their
[49:27] fundamental instead of upon the
[49:30] raw
[49:32] plain pure
[49:33] word of god as was given to the apostles
[49:37] i say to you back to the primitive
[49:39] church
[49:40] back to the apostolic church
[49:43] back to the apostolic way but of course
[49:46] in this modern satan's eden
[49:50] in which we live
[49:51] satan has made it such a way that that
[49:54] seems
[49:56] like an anomaly in the midst of it all
[49:59] hallelujah
[50:01] my preaching even now would seem like
[50:03] old-fashioned it doesn't fit in to the
[50:07] society and into the measure or
[50:09] standards of the day but friends we are
[50:12] not called to measure up ourselves to
[50:15] the world or to the standards of the
[50:17] world we are here to keep god's
[50:20] plumbline standard of his unchanging
[50:23] unswerving word and his truth which will
[50:27] never die but will bring to pass the
[50:30] things he has spoken amen amen now
[50:34] they're trying to prove it all that they
[50:38] are trying to prove to the world they
[50:39] have it and they have enough of it and
[50:42] they have more than enough of it but you
[50:45] compare this 20th century church
[50:48] with the
[50:50] church of the book of acts chapter 2
[50:52] verse 4 and what do we see where is the
[50:56] power
[50:57] where is the love
[50:59] where is the fellowship where is the
[51:01] moving of the holy spirit i mean genuine
[51:05] moving not the engineered
[51:08] moving of man not by the systems of man
[51:12] with uh the manipulation of masses of
[51:15] people but by the
[51:17] original spontaneous combustion of the
[51:21] holy spirit coming down and moving
[51:24] amongst the people oh my where is that
[51:28] purified church
[51:31] that was refined and purified by god
[51:36] in which you could not have ananias and
