everything else but I'm trusting in God just as much as you are and if you've got the faith this morning I believe we can leave here rejoicing amen praise God so let's go to the first scripture um before we do that let's just pray our great prous father Lord how thankful we are this morning Lord this is really a a a privilege father to be here this morning once again Lord because we know there's a supernatural element that brings you on the scene and that is faith in your people and I know this house is full of Faith this morning Lord there are hearts and lives that are crying out to you by Faith Lord they know that you're a reality but yet Lord there's situations in their lives and their circumstances around each and every one of our Lives Lord that that that we're pulling to the Unseen this morning we're we're looking to the Unseen this morning and we're going to Lord we're going to draw upon your life and your spirit and your anointing to come and anoint us to speak and anoint us to receive and to hear all that we have need of Lord father we commit this service all those that are listening in online Lord may your your anointing your spirit go directly to their hearts even now Lord and capture them Lord and let your word find a resting place within their hearts we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen praise God St John chapter 11 verse 39-41 Jesus said take ye away the stone Martha the sister of him that was dead saith unto him Lord by this time he stinketh for he hath been Dead 4 days Jesus said unto her said I not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou would see the glory of God then they took away the Stone from the place where the dead was laid you may be seated brother brandham here says in uh 1962 he says have not I sent thee he said I believe that you are the Son of God you now he's he's repeating what Martha said here bring it into context if you ever get anything from God you've got to believe God's servants God's word see and he was the word I believe just tell me what to do where you where you have laid him where have you laid him down he went to the Grave weeping like a man when he got down there what did he say now do when you get there see you got something to do you know said take ye away the stone if you want to see a miracle you sick people tonight if you want to see a miracle take away the stone take away that stone that sin that lays at the door what is it say brother Brenham I don't I don't do nothing but if you don't believe it can't happen amen take away the stone of unbelief and watch what happens just take away that stone and when she obeyed and the word of and when she obeyed the word of the Lord she saw a miracle praise God forever more amen hallelujah glory to God today you know um we want to take a look briefly here and then we're going to really get into um you know the the the final thought of what I've got here today but this morning I I want to start by you know looking into some of the stones that we need to roll away in our own lives you know life you know throws all kinds of Curves and you know we look back on our lives and we see all kinds of situations that are placed upon Our Lives growing up you know uh things that that are generational things that we come out of scar s and all kinds of situations that we deal with in life but then then we come to a place where we are introduced to the word of God Amen and when you come into a place where you're introduced to the word of God God says I'm going to roll away every stone every you know every um every shame every guilt every fear and every doubt everything that that that you know that that was placed upon your life as a result of your upbringing and your experiences you come to God and you come to the Living God and and you know we're talking about the resurrection here we we've been talking about Christ in the power of his resurrection we've been talking about him being uh the the resurrection and the power now in our lives right now and we need situations that that you know that need to be dealt with in our lives right now and so we come into this experience and this walk with God and he says I can deal with all of that I can roll away every stone that that that that's holding you back from being all that I want you to be not what you want to be it's not about what what you know the plans that we have he says I got plans for you amen I want those plans in my life I want those miracles in my life I listen if he wants me to roll away some stones that I got to deal with situations in my life I got to get rid of unbelief I got to I I got to resist the enemy I got to resist the devil amen praise God and so I want to look at just a few things that you know that the Lord just gave me some things that he says just bring these things you know because these are areas we're all human we're all dealing with th things in our lives amen praise God and God wants us to be set free you know so so the first thing that you know that that he brought to me was Pride or self-sufficiency these are stones that that that need to be rolled away in our lives and what happens is as we you know mature and as we become adults and we you know things come upon our lives and and we start to take on certain ways and attitudes and and the moment that you start to think that you can do life on your own that's the moment that you start to walk away away from God Amen there is absolutely no way that you can do it alone you see one of the things about coming to Christ he says he that's heavy laden let him come unto me he said come unto me I will give you rest amen you know but people want to do it on their own people want to hang on to their Traditions they want to hold on to all the things that that that they thought was the truth and meanwhile it's it's hindering them from moving on with God Amen you can expect your walk with God to begin to deteriorate the moment that you think you can do it on your own you'll never do it remember this is a call in this hour it is Christ come down to gather each and every son and daughter of God into the body of Christ it's the body of Christ CH that's going to go in the Rapture it's the same spirit that raised up Christ from the dead if it dwells in you so this is a body movement and you think that you can you don't need to go to church you don't need to belong to a Ministry you don't need to be under the leadership of the holy spirit in a in a god ordained Ministry you are doing it you're going it on your own you're G to be you you you've missed the boat you've missed the boat you need to be a part of what God is doing in this hour we're going to move on so we'll burn out from trying to do things on our own power especially spiritual things and when we're worn out and we're tired it puts a distance between us and God you don't feel like it you know when you get worn out you don't want to go to church you don't want to Fellowship you don't want to read the word you're discouraged you're knocked down because you're trying to fight a battle on your own you can't do it you need him amen praise God listen in John 663 Jesus said this he said the spirit gives eternal life but the flesh human effort it doesn't accomplish much it's by the spirit you can accomplish all the Natural Things of this life what is it that you would gain the whole world but yet you would lose your soul praise God in our human effort we cannot please God it's only faith that pleases God you want to try and pray 12 hours a day you want to go to church seven days a week like our Catholic friends do you know they think that by going to church and by saying more hail Mar's and more our fathers that that's going to produce Jesus Christ in their life no it's not what the word of God says amen it's not what the word is producing in this hour amen praise God hallelujah but when we lean on the holy spirit for everything all things when we esteem ourselves small and in need of help then almighty God comes and takes over he realizes that you're humbling yourself to his program remember this is about his plan amen this is about the Plan of Redemption and our role in the plan you can go to the next slide I believe that's you know recognizing our role in Redemption that's what this is all about amen praise God so you can pray all day long you can do all that you want amen but it's not gonna it's not going to please God by you worshiping him in your flesh you need to worship Him in spirit and in truth amen in Psalms 10:4 it says the wicked through the pride of his countenance will not seek after God God is not in all his thoughts imagine that you see because his thoughts are on his own ability I got to go to school I gotta you know I I got to get this degree I got to get that degree you know degrees in knowledge and and in this world they're good if you're looking to improve your financial ability and capacity in the work space but when it comes with God if you get too too uh um in in information filled and uh science and and too many degrees and it it starts to take you away from God because science is not with God it tries to prove that God doesn't exist amen it's the opposite of the supernatural it relies on all natural it wants to EXP explain everything naturally you cannot explain God he is Supernatural amen amen so when Pride cometh then cometh shame but with lowly is wisdom when you humble when you trust when you obey the Holy Spirit just comes amen praise God Proverbs 1618 to 19 Pride goeth Before Destruction and a hottie spirit before a fall better it is to be of humble spirit with the lowly than to divide the spoil with the proud praise God we need to roll away the stone of Pride amen glory to God impatience there's another one you know if you look back in the in the scriptures you go back into the Old Testament you look back at Abraham you look back at all the prophets they had to be patient they had to wait on God because they knew that it was only God that could do what God was showing them so as God is showing you your part in the word of God and you're you're placing into the body of Christ you're going to need to be patient you're not going to you don't need to be going ahead of God Amen you look at Joseph you look at Moses you look at no Noah they all waited on God if there's anything you need in order to walk with God and to walk well with God it's patience it's to them that wait upon the Lord he renews your strength he doesn't answer prayer when you want it to be answered amen he answers it exactly when you need it amen praise God Hallelujah the Bible says that without faith it's impossible to please God and so you you know trying to do things on your own and trying to figure things out on your own because of your impatience you're just you're just pushing the situation further down the road God's still going to accomplish everything that he needs to accomplish in your lives amen the Bible says in Hebrews uh Hebrews 6:15 and so after waiting patiently Abraham received what was promised and if we wait patiently and we serve the Lord patiently where God wants us where God's placed us where God has given you Faith to to to to do great things you'll know naturally where God is blessing you prospering you don't be looking anywhere else just look at where you are what you're doing and if God is blessing you then you're receiving Faith to do it joyfully you're doing it with praise you're doing it with Thanksgiving you realize that the Supernatural is all over your office all over your position because you've submitted to it you're being patient to the Lord and you're allowing him to do it amen praise God if you are impatient person like me sometimes we all are come on everybody's got moments where they you know they just don't understand what's going on they get impatient they get angry they even get angry with God okay but it it gets you nowhere it just gets you discouraged praise God but you know then you know it causes seeds of unbelief to begin to sew in your heart you got to be careful because the enemy is looking for ways to plant seed of unbelief in you and so he looks when you get weak he looks that when you get impatient he looks to see when you start to say things that you shouldn't be saying you get into gossip instead of Fellowship you know we we need to be careful of all those things these are stones that need to be rolled away in our lives so that we can come out and be who we are and what God has made us to be roll away the Stone of impatience you know another thing the need to know everything we don't need to know everything we don't need to oh the the the seals the seals are open and you know the word is progressing and and you know everything's moving on and you know I I need to know what God is doing right now I you know God is moving right now listen relax he's doing it amen he's doing it I want us this morning to put on our simple thinking caps simple thinking caps amen we don't need to know everything we need to know him Amen in the power of his resurrection amen you cannot understand everything that God does and the sooner we accept this reality the better for us mystery is a part of our walk with God hallelujah listen you know I don't want to get ahead of myself I'm going to wait till we get to that part we cannot know all things the Bible says in Isaiah that as far as the heavens are from the earth that is how far God's thoughts are from our thoughts amen what you're saying to God is that you want to be in control when you're in pay you want to be in control I want to call the shots I want to say the way it should be you know you got to be careful wives with your husbands husbands with your wives you know that you know you know you start to talk about things you start to plan things and before you know it if you sit back one of them's calling all the shots why because they want to be in control they want to know that that everything's going to be the way they want it they want to they don't want to leave any part of it to God's God's plan God's surprises God's ability to to to do things that that'll go Way Beyond what you thought was possible Amen brother Mike went on a trip to Arizona he thought he was going just on a trip but God had something else in mind amen I don't know what it is but I know something happened because when you go by faith you're going to receive something you're going to see things I remember our first trip to Arizona there's a supernatural element around it and I knew right away oh you're going there something good going to happen Hallelujah because God moves in great ways when you're going under Faith under expectation under the knowledge of what God has done in our day that God had a prophet a Vindicated Prophet that he sent to the Earth just like Moses just like Elijah just like Ezekiel all these prophets of God that God had prepared and when the people recognized the the ones that recognized that they rejoiced in the word of the Lord and Supernatural took place all around their lives amen praise God glory to God we need to allow God's uh Mysteries and God's ways to work in our lives God knows your life God knows what you need Down the Road God knows exactly the turn that's coming but you sometimes you want to go so fast you want to you want to hit the the the pedal to the metal and before you know it right by the turn and you miss that blessing Hallelujah roll away the stone of needing to know everything people pleasing here's another one you see like look at these things like they're just simple things but God struck my heart he says just bring it just bring it PE I learned this one right from the mouth of the Lord Jesus right here in St John chapter 5: 41 I receive not honor from men Jesus was not interested in men honor praise God he was only looking to do one thing and that was to please the father please God fulfill the word that was destined in his life amen glory Jesus said I don't care about this is a contemporary English version now Jesus said I don't care about human praise the Apostle Paul repeats it over and over in his letters that he only seeks the approval of God and not men Galatians 1 10 Apostle Paul says am I now trying to win the approval of human beings or God or am I trying to please people because if I were still trying to please people I would not be a servant of Jesus Christ think about it you want to please your family you want to please your friends you know they have events and they have them on Saturdays and and then Sunday you know like they'll have it on Sundays and right away they'll expect you to be there but you know where your place is it's in the house of the Lord that's right that's where you please God and when you're there and they see you standing on God's word and that you're you've put God first in your life and that you're desires not to please man but to please God they see something in you that makes them realize that wow they're really serious about serving God yes we are amen now there's times where things will happen of course there's times you're going to go on vacation there's times you're going to miss certain events it's going to happen but your desire your heart your motives are not that and and nine out of 10 times you're going to be pleasing God and and not worrying so much about pleasing people amen praise God sometimes we do make you know concession but our concession is is also with a motive that God will do something and show something and reveal something to them amen because this call it's a supernatural call listen in in Galatians 1:10 now in uh the the original version for do I now persuade men or God or do I seek to please men or if I yet pleased men I should not be a servant of Christ but I certify you Brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man so in other words he's making it very clear here listen I wasn't you could tell your family your friends listen nobody convinced me to go to that church nobody convinced me to be a part of that message Ministry and what God is doing in this hour when I saw recognize your day and its message something struck my heart something became a reality what do you mean recognize your day your day you see that's what's happen happened that's why you're so zealous for the Lord because you've recognized your day like Paul he says it wasn't man that convinced me he says for I receive for neither for I neither received it of man neither was I taught it now imagine Paul who was a theologian of the theologians he was taught under gilia himself on the word of God and knew God and knew the word like like could quote the scriptures and everything else and here he turns around and he denies any teaching of man but he says but by the revelation of Jesus Christ he made that clear that's how I stand and why I please God Amen Hallelujah most important opinion to us always must be what God thinks what God wants what he desires in our lives amen praise God hallelujah we need to roll away the stone of people pleasing praise God self-centeredness everything is not about you if you can never see yourself if Beyond yourself your walk with God will be hindered you got to be able to see God's plan God's desire God's goals God's purpose all those things have to be the Center focus of Our Lives not self-centered it'll hinder others too when all you want to talk about is yourself how's that going to how's that going to bless God praise God Amen we are called to be a part of the body we are called to serve others your desires cannot be the most important thing to you there there there must be room for others amen there must be room to listen this is a supernatural body Body of Christ that's moving under the unity of the spirit and the spirit can never go against itself so when you feel certain feelings within you that are putting you against a brother or a sister that's the devil plain simple I don't care call it whatever you want now sure there could be flaws on the brother or the sister there could be situations that they're dealing with but you you if you're more mature and you're you're able to see beyond that and to see the real plan of God and the purpose of God you'll see beyond the mistakes you'll see beyond the weakness you'll see the purpose of God you'll pray for them you'll project love into their lives you'll project love into their situations you'll do nothing but kindness you'll you'll say things that are only going to be kind you're going to you're going to lift them up more than you're going to lift yourself up you're going to you're going to do things that are going to bring you into that perfect Unity with God so that you can be that expression to them and so that God can be pleased with what you're doing we need to roll away the sewn of self centeredness distraction if there's ever been an age of distraction it's right now my God distraction in Matthew chapter 6 Jesus tells the parable of the sore and in it he mentions a class of seeds Mark 4:18 still others like seed swn among Thorns hear the word but the worries of this life the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word making it unfruitful there's so many things that can cause us to take our eyes off of the Lord Jesus but what he's doing in our lives we need to focus on that we can't allow the distractions of this life and and this this is the age of information this is the age where your phone is constantly in your hand the only time it's probably not in your hand is when you're in church and if you're in church and it's in your hand it's because you're taking notes praise God right because I know I have it in my hand sometimes praise God but you know there's so much distraction and if we're not careful we get distracted constantly and the minute that the enemy can get your your thought off into another place right away he cuts the channel between you and God it's as simple as that distraction so many distractions Jesus mentions three things that can distract us from God worries of this life and we all got them and don't tell me they don't distract you because they do they do got him in my life right now there's distractions there's situations my children this that thinking about you know like the setup with the garden centers and all these things that are going through my mind and the transition and and and being here at my post of Duty and all those things are constantly bombarding my mind over and over and over again and it's trying to distract me from doing what God wants me to do amen but it's it's it's the cares of the this life but one thing that always brings me back God is in control amen God started this work God is working everything out so that in the end he's going to get the victory amen and I benefit just being a part of the victory that's all because I've surrendered I've allowed him to do his whatever he needs to do in my life I've put your word before my face constantly oh God like David said so that so that the enemy cannot distract but he will but I will not allow it when he does I will resist him it's it's just part of who we are I say it all the time the enemy listen the devil's we hear all the time you know I'll hear a report of this my wife will tell me oh this is going on right now and this is this is what you know the the enemy is saying and this is I said yeah he's doing job he's doing his job you ever watch The Road Runner you remember the the rooster used to clock in and the minute he would clock in boom he was after that Road Runner and he was knocking him down left right and Center distracting him doing everything that he could to try and stop him he's doing his job our job is to resist the enemy our job is to put the word in front front of us replace the lie with the word because the word will overcome every circumstance and every situation praise God if we desire God above everything else it's I in our hearts that will cause us to prioritize and focus on god let's ask the Lord to rest our hearts on him and let's roll away the stone of distraction finally let's go to the next slide next go ahead now I've read this before but I connect this with tradition and religion you know people say boy you're really religious no religion is people's opinions of who God is and everybody's got a different interpretation on who God is religion is something that you connect yourself to as a human and you make it your Doctrine your teaching your understanding but let's read this cognitive dissonance sometimes people hold a core belief that is very strong and when they are presented with evidence that works against that core belief the new evidence cannot be accepted what a stone what a stone it creates a feeling that is extremely uncomfortable and it is called cognitive dissonance and because it is so important to protect the core belief people will rationalize ignore and even deny anything that does not fit in which that core belief even if it is the truth even if it is what will set them free from the chains of Sin from the UN which which we know that sin is unbelief now you you've read this before I've brought this before but it's a powerful statement and as we're going to move on now to the next you know to the next aspect of this uh service I want us to to to to get set in our minds and prepare our hearts and those that are out there that are listening in and listening in onto this service here your your your life is controlled by your thinking what you think about all day long is what you become amen and you you you're you're a creature of habit and you're a creature that loves to look for the easiest way you're looking for the easiest way and when truth gets presented to you it's it you know and and it's not in line with what you have been taught well wait a minute I was brought up uh baptism we baptize babies there's nowhere in the scripture where anybody ever baptized a baby it's as simple as that and if you're if your foundation see we don't we're not religious we are not religious this church is not religious it is spiritually filled with the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost leads you to the word of God and the word of God cannot lie and that's why we don't trust in our own ability as Men We Trust in the spirit of God leading us to the word and then when our experience is equal to the word then God says amen God blesses it amen praise God so let's go to the next aspect of this service okay praise God let me bring up my now let me take a quick drink and let's read our scripture for the Lord himself sorry for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with these words now as we move into this aspect of the service we've just looked at rolling away stones in our own lives amen but let me tell you God has given us a word for this day and for this hour that also gives us the ability as Sons and Daughters of God as Christians to roll Stones away in other people's lives here's now where we're going to come into this into the part of recognizing our part in The Plan of Redemption remember this this is a call to the body of Christ brother brandham now I'm going to just laying in a foundation here the first thing comes when he starts now listen to brother brandham this is the rapture message the first thing comes when he starts descending from Heaven there's a shout from the scripture that we just read now we read this also on the on part two we're just going to move along now and we're going to take it into the end this will be the end of this series and he says here a message comes forth first now lamp trimming time rise and trim your lamps watch what was it the seventh not the sixth the seventh behold the bridegroom cometh rise and trim your lamps and they did some of them found they didn't even have any oil in their lamps see but it's lamp trimming time so there's a shout there's a message that went forth that we've received in the 20th century God sent us a continuation of the Reformation I've mentioned it many times over and for those that are listening in you need to go back and study the reformation and you need to go back and study the life of William Branham and his part in the reformation and how he was actually a prophet to the 20th century to the Gentile churches that were here on the earth so that so that all this disorder all this religion all this interpretation of man could be could be fixed and bring us back to the word that's why everything that we talk about is search the scriptures go back to the word see if your experience is lining up with the word so the first was the message coming forth the second is a voice of the Resurrection the same voice that loud voice in St John 11 verse 38-44 that called Lazarus from the grave getting the bride together and then the resurrection of the Dead see that to be caught up with it now watch three things take place so here now that's why we've been ministering on this on St John 11 is because we're actually in a walk to the resurrection we've already been resurrected but yet we're still walking to the resurrection because not only was was Jesus is going to call Lazarus which was the a type of the sleeping Saints those that died before us that believe the word those Christians that died for this word they called them Heretics the Dark Ages they burned them to the stake they did everything to get rid of the spirit of God that was in those people but those were actually Sons and Daughters of God go back and read the exposition of the seven Church ages go back and read that and read on how all the messengers that that God had sent there was a messenger to each of those seven churches William brandham was the messenger to the seventh Church age okay but you'll look back you'll see Martin Luther Wesley you'll see Columba you'll see St Martin Paul he was the first messenger in the book of Ephesus in to the Ephesian church this is all church history it's all available to anybody to go back and research and search the scriptures to see if what we're saying is truth or not amen but here we're talking about H H walk into a resurrection and Martha she had received the instruction to roll away the stone and this is telling us that we've got a part to play in this whole Plan of Redemption amen and so uh that's why we we are on a walk we're a type of Martha we're a type of Mary we're walking together some are really into the law some are really into Grace but we're still walking towards the resurrection amen and we're looking to to to find that last one because Jesus said all that the father hath given me will come not one of them will be left behind and we have a part to play in that we're we're we're there testifying of what God is doing in this hour amen and so here now he says he says the next is what was a trumpet a voice a shout a voice a trumpet now the third thing is a trumpet which always is a feast of trumpets is the calling the people to the feast and that'll be the bride's supper he goes on to say that's the calling of the churches second Thessalonians is talking about calling those that are alive and remain shall not hinder them that that that that sleep and and we have to meet up with those that are alive and remain we need to reach them with the message of this hour they need to know that God is doing something in this hour and will call them into the body for the Rapture because this world is is going into tribulation don't tell me it's not it's all around us more than ever it's screaming around us sir it's never screamed like it's screaming right now I was telling my wife I said my God you know 10 years ago we were thinking about you know the tribulation and and wars and and Israel and and and what we saw scripturally because everything that's going on in Israel is in the scripture everything it's scripturally prophesied from before the foundations of the world amen and it's all there and it's all playing out right before us and here we are now witnessing it we're seeing it as clear as clear can be but there's a call to the bride there's a call to the church when I say bride I'm talking about the church the real Church the body of Jesus Christ not church denominations let's go on and then and then he says so he says that'll be the bride supper the the Lamb's supper with the bride in the sky see he's talking about that meeting in the air the first thing comes forth is his message calling the bride together the next thing is the resurrection of the sleeping Saints those that are that that are asleep now there's some that are asleep that have died but yet there's some that are still asleep that need to be awoken right here in this generation that are stuck in denomination stuck in Tradition they've got all kinds of stones rolled over their lives and they can't see the truth and God is telling you roll away that stone some of the people that we got to deal with you know that you know like maybe their lives are are a mess but don't worry like you know like Martha said but you know there's a stink don't worry about the stink let them come in God will clean them up you ever get a fish and pull it out of the sea and start cleaning it it stinks that's the way it is until it's clean and then it's cooked and then it's delicious Hallelujah and that's how God works with his people amen he's dealing with lives situations and there's a lot of fish that still need to be clean there's trout out there amen and we've got our part to call and to do and to live before them so that they can recognize what God is doing in this hour and that's that's the thing that's taking place friends he says we're right there ready now the only thing the church coming out has got to lay before the sun to ripen amen praise God let's go to the next slide but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you so what is it that we've got that they need those that need to come in the Holy Ghost the quickening spirit the spirit of God but here I'm going to go on here I'm going to read listen brother Bram speaking here in uh the rising of the sun he says now notice it was the first corn of God's wheat that had been raised from the dead he's talking about Christ God's first corn of Wheat by God's quickening power God had quickened his life raised him up from the dead and he was the first fruits of those that slept the first fruit he was that Chief that's why they had to wave that sheath for he was the first one that come to maturity when we're talking about the word that's why when we talk about Christ there is no other way that man must be saved but by Jesus Christ The Life of Christ Jesus said I am the resurrection so he can raise them up and I am the life the eternal life that that that gives them and and shows that eternal life is in them amen praise God so it was waved as a memorial of Thanksgiving to God believing that the rest of them would come it was a sign and today because he was the first Son of God to come to full maturity to be in God he was plucked up from the earth and is waved over the people he's talking about the crucifixion talking about how Christ had to die that's why it's all about it's all about the resurrection everything changed because of the Resurrection amen praise God oh glory to God he says oh what a glorious Lesson by the quickening power the first one although he had he had been typed and many times he was shown throughout the back listen if you go back and read the Old Testament you see Christ from from Genesis to revelation if you don't if you don't see him in every verse in every uh chapter you're missing something because it's all about him the whole book is all about him amen what a glorious Thing by the quickening power he had been typed and many times as well see later that he was typed but this was really the first fruits of them that slept he was waved over the promised seed that had promise of life he was waved at the day of Pentecost when there came a sound from heaven like a waving Mighty rushing wind and was waved over the people the Pentecostal people that was up at Pentecost waiting for the blessing to come and to be waved again we realize in the last day according to Luke 17:30 in the son of man in the sun day again in the day that the son of man will be revealed or waved again over the people this is brother brandom and 1965 in the message it is the rising of the sun it was an Easter message he was talking about the resurrection of Jesus Christ and how the word was now on display again and now it was being waved before the people again in the life and Ministry of William Mariam Branham not that he was God no sir it's listen the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us Jesus Christ listen you have to you you've got to you've got to put it all into perspective the father is the Elohim the self-existent one the Lord the Almighty the the the the the logos amen and he expressed from his thought he expressed and put into expression a son and called his name Jesus every thought that was in the logos went into Jesus and whatever was in Christ he pours now into the church through the Holy Ghost so understanding now that when you look at the word you you know we look at the word and you take for example go ye into all the world baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit and and Jesus spoke those words and he knew exactly what he was saying because he was the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and so the logos the thought that he had in the back of his mind was was placed into him and what he was speaking now was the word and when he said baptize in the name of the father and the son and of the Holy Ghost and somebody goes and baptize somebody into those titles that's not the word what he meant by that was the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost and we know that that's the Lord Jesus Christ father son Holy Ghost same person not three in one you see and that's why the word that was being waved now before the people in the ministry of William Branham to restore the hearts of the children Malachi 4:5 back to the Fai of the fathers that was to restore us back to the word amen so that our expression our experience our walk as Christians is according to the word not according to doctrines of man that's why when we say to somebody there was nobody ever baptized as a child and every single baptism was done in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we're only repeating the word because on the day of Pentecost in the book of Acts 238 when Peter who was present there with Jesus when he says go ye into all the world baptizing them in the name of the F Peter caught the Revelation that the name of the father and the son and the was Jesus Christ that was the the the the body that God created in order to be on earth so that it could go to the crucifixion so that a resurrection could take place and the and the reason we're here today is because of the Resurrection amen it's all about the resurrection everything's about the resurrection and God is resurrecting Sons and Daughters of God bringing them into their maturity placing them under the the the the the leadership of the word and teaching them according to the word and now your experience is based on the word not on doctrines of men so when somebody comes to you and says it doesn't matter how you're baptized they're they're they're denying the word like they don't understand that they they think it's okay because remember cognitive dissonance right they believe something it's a core belief they're going to hold to that thing no matter what they're going to want to stay with that thing even if it means their own salvation but let me tell you if there's an attribute of God because Jesus said all that the father hath given me will will will come not one of them will be lost I don't care who they are that's why you don't need to get into arguments with people you don't need to try to convince anybody when you are a part listen if when Jesus went to the Cross you went to the Cross amen because you were in him from before the foundations of the world you needed to be expressed let's move on here let's look at the next um scripture here okay St John 11:43 let's read this because it's there and when he thus had spoken he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes and his face was bound about with napkin Jesus said unto them loose him and let him go then many of the Jews which came to Mary and had seen the things which Jesus did believed on him amen praise God now watch he says I'm going to read a quote here okay here it is it is the rising of the Sun as Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth although typed in many places he was the first fruits of those that slept in the the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church there will have to be a sheath waved again in the last days Oh my he says waving of the sheath what was the sheath the first one that come to mature the first one that proved it was a wheat that proved it was a sheath if you are a seed and you are a weed wheat wheat not a weed you don't want to be a weed a wheat then you are going to bring forth the Life of Christ you can't bring anything else forth because you're a wheat you were a wheat from before the foundations of the world you are an attribute of God you are a seed of God and when the word gets called in its time and in its season there's no way that you can miss the word amen praise God he says here Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waved over the people and the first time there will come forth for the bright age for a resurrection out of dark denominal denominal ationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power and being waved over the People by the same signs and wonders that he he did back there look what he's talking he's talking about denom denominal denominational systems you know they tried to bury Christ in that grave they put the you know it was the Roman Stone that that they that they used to roll over that that uh that grave there and and it was it was uh uh trying to block every possibility of of allowing that life to to to be raised you know because they were afraid by by by chance that this Supernatural that was taking place in his life that was proving himself over and over he had raised the dead he he's the one that called Lazarus from the dead they they didn't like what took place you know that the the calling of Lazarus from the dead was the very last Supernatural event that took place before he went to Jerusalem to go to Calvary that was that was the last Supernatural event that of the raising and that's just a type of those that which are alive and remain they're going to be called out of the graves amen they're going to be called out of those denominational Graves praise God you're going to need to tell your friends and your and your family about you know about God calling out a people that are going to hearken to the word of God they're not going to be caught by their own traditions of man they're not going to allow the word of God to control them they're going to realize that they can actually walk in the light of God's word for this day and for this hour listen to brother brandom here he says here sorry it's right here praise God just be patient with me I'm still getting used to all this equipment up here and trying to use it in the right way praise God so there are denominational stones that are going to be rolled away he says because I live also speaking to his wife because I live ye shall live what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus by God's quickening power he was waved to them the word which he was was waved back to them on the day of Pentecost the word made manifest now and as I say it's to be waved again in the last day now for instance amen and so he goes on here and he says uh and when in the in the message in 1962 the restoration of the brid tree now to rid him out of their sight they hated him so bad because he tore up all their organizations and this message when it is testified when you're out there and you're testifying of God's move in your life and how God has resurrected you and and drawn you out of denominational doctrines of man and has brought you back to the word of God it brings a reproach they get upset they can't help it because it's it's going against everything that they believe but he tore up their organizations to rid him out of their sight they buried him and rolled a great big denominational Stone over the door so he'd be sure not to rise again now then what did they do they took that precious tree cut it down hanged it on a man-made tree that's right cut the life out of it and hanged upon a man-made tree for a mockery that's what they did at Calvary then they didn't like it too many people standing there crying about it so they took him off they said we'll make our denomination so tight that they'll never get them holy rollers in here oh boy so they scooted him back into the hole of Joseph of uh armea and they rolled a great big Stone took a century of men to roll it up there did you ever see see the other night in the picture the big path they rolled the stone up on weighs tons rolled their big organizational Stone up there so he could not raise up but did that hold him no but I will restore sayth the Lord let's hit that text now and drive it I will restore sayeth the Lord I'll restore him in three days I'll raise him back up again they couldn't hide him in that rock they couldn't hide him out out of their sight they couldn't get him off the off their hands I will restore him sayeth the Lord and in three days he rose up and was restored again praise God hallelujah and he's risen up in your life through justification through sanctification through the baptism of the Holy Ghost all three stages have taken place in your walk as a son or a daughter of God go to the next slide it says here in Acts 18 but ye shall receive Power Glory to God God promised that you would receive power that you would receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost to give you the strength the confidence and the courage to stand on this word amen after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the earth amen praise God forever more glory to God you are now walking in the light of God's word you are now filled with the spirit of God Jesus said in St John 1:7 but if you walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another how can somebody that's walking in darkness have have fellowship with somebody that's walking in the light it can't happen there's no Fellowship when when when your foundation is based on man's teaching and man's Doctrine there's no Fellowship because Jesus is the light listen what he says here he says but if you walk in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin and that's the thing that people need to understand understand that when they come to the light it purges them it justifies them it cleanses them it gives the opportunity for the Holy Spirit to now move in their lives wash away that denominational thinking wash away all that tradition out of their lives in s in St John 8:12 Jesus spake again and he said unto them I am the light of the world Amen he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but has shall have have the light of life there's no life outside of Jesus Christ and his word amen that's why when when when somebody's willing to take a doctrine of of of a church a teaching of a church a following of a church an interpretation of God's word based on man's writings there's no way that the light can be there this is a call out of Darkness and into light God is calling the people out of Darkness it says walk in the light a lot of people just want to come to church they just want to sit in church they want to leave and they want to forget about everything it didn't say sit in the light it said walk in the light you got to walk with God you got to you got to put action behind your testimony you got to let the Holy Spirit work in your life let him move supernaturally by you stepping out on faith it takes Faith to step out on God's word and to walk out of the darkness you ever try to walk in the dark it's not easy sometimes the liks go out and you got to walk and now you've got to rely on on on your on your your faith you got to rely on what you know and God he doesn't he doesn't allow you to sit in darkness in in in uh in this world not if you're a son or a daughter of God he comes into your life in order to Quicken your your mind so that you put on the mind of Christ and now you see through the darkness you see through all the the lies all the the teachings of man amen listen to brother brandom he says here in the in uh Christ is the is revealed in his own word God is revealed in every age by his promised word to that age I'm gonna repeat that that's a profound statement God is revealed in every age by his promised word to that age do you know that God has a promised word to this age right now there's a word that that that that's coming to us that's perfecting us for the Rapture it's the word that's going to give us our Resurrection our translation we've already been resurrected we've already been snatched out of the world you know how it says you know he'll take one he'll leave one that's already happening and those of you that have already experienced that you know that God took you out and you know 30 years ago God pulled myself and my wife out of the life that that that we were living all the friends and the families we still have relationships with them but but they don't see this that we're seeing fully but that's not that's not our business our business is to live this life and allow the Holy Spirit to display itself and if God wants to reveal because it's not you that found God it's God that found you it's God that called you it's God that that he says they'll my sheep hear my voice this is not about getting as many people to join the church as possible possible we bring them into the church they come under the the the the atmosphere of the of the word of God the spirit of God starts to speak and and starts to reveal things through the word of God and if there is a seed in there remember the seeds have to come to maturity so if there's a seed in there and it sits under the under that light long enough it needs light you can never grow a seed in the dark they stay in the dark they'll never grow they reject and they no you tell them search the scriptures look to see what it says about baptism look to see what the scripture says about receiving the Holy Ghost and and how Jesus said I'll give you the comforter which is the Holy Ghost and it will guide you into all truth look into that Search the word and see if that's not going to change your walk or your experience to where you are now going to look to the word you're now going to search the scriptures to see if your salvation based on the way you've interpreted it is going to work out for you because it's not too late if you're an attribute of God you can't miss this you're going to have to come you're going to have to surrender you're going to have to give into this because the spirit of God says I will not leave you comfortless I'll be with you even in you he says I'm coming after you Hallelujah I don't care who you are you're out there listening in here today and you may have heard something through the word of God I challenge you to search the scripture go back to the word of God study the seven Church ages go back and read the the revelation of the Seven Seals go back and and study the word of God prayerfully and see if God doesn't reveal to you and place you into the light of this hour amen glory to God there's a promised word for this age glory to God and I'm glad that God has awoken me to this promised word in this hour because it's what called me out it's what gives me confidence to stand here and to minister this word and to testify and let the people know that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and if you're going to walk in the light of God's word then your life must produce the word it's as simple as that it's the word that is being produced in this hour it's the word that that that is going to be displayed to the people and the word for this age is going to produce a church that is going to separate themselves completely from denominational man-made teachings man's control listen the World Council of churches is going to try to close up any churches that are that are like heretic type churches you know they might even classify us that way but that doesn't matter because we're not worried we've got somebody standing with us amen amen we've got the word of God that stands with his own word he's not going to he's not going to uh uh judge the world based on their interpretation oh there's a hundred ways to get to God and so God is now the author of confusion no and will allow you to go through Mary here and allow you to go through Buddha there and allow you to go through Muhammad over here and what what kind of confusion is that God is going to judge this world One Way by his word amen he is going to make his word so plain and so simple and he's going to use you and me to be the simple uh conduits that are going to bring forth this word in this day and in this hour we're not bringing forth a complicated word this is a simple word brother Gabriel Hallelujah it had to be real simple to get a hold of a couple Italians like this let me tell you okay that we're brought up under the traditions of man and all kinds of tradition but once that word comes you know once that word Shines on a seed that seed has to respond amen that seed has to come to life that seed has to go and say wait a minute here we I need the Holy Ghost I remember when that struck me so hard I said I went to Pastor Simon I said I need the Holy Ghost I realized that that was that that was the spirit that could overcome the drug addiction in my life I said oh that's that that's the power that delivered the woman at the well that delivered the the blind man that delivered the the the the one with epilepsy the one that Rose him from the dead that's the power it was the power of the Holy Ghost that did those things and I realized I need the holy ghost in my life and when he came he kicked out the enemy amen hallelujah and he's still doing it today he's still the same yesterday today and forever amen praise God hallelujah glory to God Amen let's invite the musicians to come now so what is it Saints this Resurrection is now in us this is what is being displayed before the people you go back and study the Seven Seals and you will see that when brother brandham came to the seventh seal there was silence in heaven when he read from the book of Revelation when they opened that seventh seal it's because Christ himself self had left to come down into the Earth they're looking for the second coming of Jesus Christ I say to you he's already come and he's already here and he is calling a people he is filling a five-fold Ministry with his Spirit he's anointed pastors teachers evangelists Apostles and Prophets to minister the word of God in order to bring a bride a Church remember he's calling a church out of the church he's not dealing with people as as many he's dealing with you individual he's calling individuals this is a walk of you and Jesus Christ amen praise God this is not a a a body a a a single man movement this is a body movement that's led by the headship of the Holy Spirit which is Christ and in 1963 when that's Supernatural Cloud appeared over sunset Mountain that was Christ himself coming down supernaturally to meet with the body of Jesus Christ the church to call them out to give and to become the leadership a lot of people will look at that cloud but because the spirit of the Loos is not in them because remember you need the Loos in you which is the thought of God the thought of God will only recognize the word those that can that do not have logo ghost that do not have the spirit of God will look at that cloud and say just another Cloud just a cloud that appeared could have been done by planes by the jet stream but you that have the logos that have the word in you that is the holy spirit will look at that cloud and when you turn it to the right you'll see exactly what it is it's the head of Jesus Christ coming to the body of Christ in order to bring us together for the Rapture of the church this has been going on since 1963 it will culminate in the Rapture it will finalize we that are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them all those that are from the previous ages will be caught up together to meet the Lord in the air thank you that's the scripture for this day praise God and I'll just read one final quote before we close here and you can go to it Christ The Mystery of God revealed 1963 we have his name is that right we took his name we stand with his name brother Mike I am the bride I took his name in baptism his name is Jesus Christ we are Mrs Jesus that's who we are amen we took his name and is that right amen the congregation said we should bear his name and remember we are now

Vindicated vindicates to the world that we are alive in him glory to God Amen The Same Spirit that raised Christ from the dead it dwells in us praise God hallelujah amen glory to God Amen thank you

do your debts are paid they were paid at Calvary amen praise God Hallelujah glory to God and then we'll be here on Easter Sunday amen glory to God we'll be here to talk about everything changed
