by opening of those seals it's now released and the mission of the Holy Ghost is to get a bride evening messenger you know the message evening messenger he's come he said I've come to hunt my bride and what and raise you from spiritual death into life take you right back into glory amen that is why you're here praise God that's why we're serving God glory to his wonderful precious name I'm going to start uh uh wrap up I'm going to come back on this subject in the next uh part two of The Rapture in fith do you mind that amen but I'm starting to wrap this up now praise God he went to Sunday school so I'll have to question you to see if I taught the word well how many FS do we have one come on say back you know you know I see on the game shows um how many F do we have is it one you're not there to question me I'm asking you it one you're certain say what praise God then you certain what you sing it with a little Tremor in your voice I think you're not too certain you have to be certain one praise God hallelujah amen what kind of a faith will it take for us to get out of this Rapture age amen praise God and where can we find that faith today which church can we find that faith fa in where can we find that Faith amen the prophet said that faith is lying in these messages that's the importance of why we ought to listen to those tapes why we are to read the the spoken word books and why we ought to read our Bible amen the message books are not the Bible amen amen the Revelation the prophet God came out of the Bible amen but the Bible is in a condensed form is that right and then he took that like Jesus when he came to the law uh he said I didn't come to destroy that I come to magnify right he came to magnify it's the translation there I come to magnify now make it a little more plain right that's what the prophet message did to this Bible he came to magnify it praise the Lord and then he turns around wait till them young man come and when they come along they going to take this word and they're going to break it down praise God so you can understand praise God so all the time he's making it clearer clearer clearer down to the stage praise the Lord now how do we get this Rapture in faith how do we get it by hearing ah Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word revelation of the word of God com by hearing prophesy hearing means understanding right faith comes by hearing the word of God with your ears you understanding amen and that's where you able to rest your belief on Amen praise God hallelujah how did he not typ the bride by pleasing God Walking with God Amen now go back and think about when brother Brandon was told by the Holy Spirit to go down there and deliver that um well he didn't know that yet was just go down walk down in the city and he walk and walk and he's walking a long time and he start we human beings we get a patient and he's walking a long time and like he's not doing nothing much being the message for so many years I'm not seeing the rain open in the skies and Thunderbolts and lightning I I I didn't see brother Simon speak on arm yet since I've been in the church or leg go back on somebody that had no leg or or some man with one one I socket was empty and all of a sudden the ey socket come back then I can believe oh my see that's the th F we talk rapturing faith is that right see see but he's talking to us of a different thing here amen faith comes by hearing the word of God and Enoch uh pleased God that's the way he did he T the right by pleasing god with rapturing faith praise God let me move on Amen praise God so um how how is it that we can obey the word you can only obey the word after hearing the word or getting a revelation of the word of God hallelujah amen praise God not you brother Philip I'm looking at you but it's not you so don't get nervous praise the Lord how long did he not please God how many years years you sure this man is able to please God for 500 years you sure it's not two years you sure that I can't poast I've been in the message for 50 years or I post I you know I I I I am more solid than you because I be listen you can be in the message for 100 years and you're still in Christen because that ation part didn't open up fully yet is that right praise God it's only then you can take in the nutrient is when God opens up that word like that praise God hallelujah amen so he pleased God for about 500 years of course you must be catching that five is number of Grace okay so you understand that praise the Lord hallelujah uh did he not get all of this rapturing fith in one day or in one night suddenly woke up and I F this is what tell took him to about 500 years for this rapturing fi to accumulate is that is that right yes and it's the same thing with us in other words it's not telling you that you got to wait 500 years but it takes time to be holy it takes time for to build up listen you can get you can get a whole Brew of chickens in 13 weeks is that right but it takes a whole year for an eagle to get one one eag takes a year for them to get one eag look you can get a you can get the Judas or one of these evil spirits in all time you can get a g just give him some money right this one do that easy but it take years for God to build Abraham it take 40 years for God to build a Moses and then him out is that right so when God is building his church God called God train God said now you understand it takes time to be holy praise the Lord hallelujah amen so you got to understand what the Bible is trying to tell you here just like not walk with God you take the time to walk with God and it's not going to happen overnight like that but little by little by little by little what Isaiah said precept upon precept line upon lying here a little there a little what is it it's like God it's like your human body by eating you're adding cells cell cell s on top of cell cell on top of cell building you up and making you grow in Grace praise the name of the Lord that's why you come to the house of God Fe on the word of God and be buil up in this Most Holy face the glory of God hallelujah amen amen yes sir so he didn't get it to in one day or one time but he walked with God for more than 500 years and while he's walking he's obeying the word amen and by obeying the word God's GPS amen God's positioning system deliberately guides him he didn't depend on anything else all he depend on is the word and the word is going to guide you right straight into a Rapture yes is that right you can literally close your eyes like all of these self-guided cars they have today and don't have to worry about accidents no more because you're headed for heaven and H and the Holy Spirit of you is going to take your there praise God hallelujah hallelujah I'm praise God forever more praise God praise God praise God hallelujah amen praise God so is the is there a climax for the bright today you believe that this faith that we in is going to clim amen praise God forever more we looking at amen look clim there right you he says we are now walking on the r of edge glory to God you can fall this way you can fall that way amen so therefore the true Christian keeps their battles yes right straight to the middle of the road by the grace of God they don't lean this way or that way but they walk right straight to the middle of the road Hallelujah so the whole thing is a climax praise God oh my praise God so what is Rapture in faith what is it Rapture in faith Revelation more Revelation is needed is that right in this hour to believe and Obey more of the word amen certain parts of the word that wasn't revealed to you before you couldn't obey because you didn't have a revelation on it what did I know about seven seventh angel what did I know about the about Revelation 10 coming to Revel I'm going into Revelation 7 to fulfill God is his own interpreter the unveiling of the Mighty God what did I know all these things could I speak like that before I was a ministering the assem of God but could I speak like that before no I didn't have any clue nothing until God sent up prop and said thus say the Lord reading your Bible of Adam and Eve and the serpent seed and the serpent and Eve I had no idea until the prophet said no it wasn't an act she committed a sexual act with serpent that was not a snake at that time he was a looking like a man that's why God said from today you will go on your belly th say the Lord that settles amen prop say thus sayth the Lord you can rest on that praise God hallelujah what what would do we know about things like that listen let's not take this message simple let's just not take it ordinary and start just resting it on the bookshelf or put it over there and it does it start to become that meaningless to you it's powerful huj it's up today praise God hallelujah I can't preach more ser in one day but I wish I could preach 10 maybe in the whole day and I had the strength to be able to preach 10 in M day and people willing enough to listen because when I read stuff in the papers like uh two days ago the scientist got a breakthrough in Europe where they are now able to create babies in a in a tum without human instrumentality they're literally able to not create designer babies is that right so a black woman can go say I want a blond child is that right I'm just making that extreme so you can understand this is what they're looking at this they can make a lot of money with that you know how much money those guys they can be get very rich right but what will it gain a man if he gains the whole world ping around God's laboratory yeah that's the prophet of God said he said they're going to make a big mess because they're fooling around in God's laboratory right and they don't know what they're playing with it's like kids playing with dynamite or and they don't know what they're playing with they're trowing a grenade and they think it's a ball a cricked ball and they can just slap with a back or something in the AR right that's what they're doing right now the whole world is going crazy theming is going wet amen hallelujah amen now let me let me now ask you a question personally now do you have more Revelation today than the day that you came into the master can you honestly say that that you understand a lot more and you're getting every day you're getting more and more Revelation from the day you came into this [Applause] listen Lord faith is required but we not saying like some people are pulling away that is some kind of a different Faith it's the same Faith praise God but you're looking at it from a different point of view because it's a spiritual revelation of the will and the word of God Amen being in 100% agreement with him fi for this out Me Not Looking Back oh when brother was here when brother was there when brother Paul Jones brother Phil fer chers or one of these Great Men pus or one of these Great Men of the past maybe had little things here and there but what they were saying was essentially true it's not even looking back on those things you understand we we we looking ahead they are some of those men the bridges and the ladders that we climb up on to be able to get revelation of the word and they already serve that purpose you can't keep looking back even at the prophet himself you can't keep looking back looking back Amen in other words it's like we not a FR frog F froggy F where where you're looking backwards but you're jumping forwards if you do that you're going to crash you're going to have problems amen you got to look Keep Your Eyes Upon Your word of the Living God hallelujah amen praise God and every day as you walk your faith is going to get stronger why because we are Abraham seed and the Bible says as Abraham was going old living longer yet he sted not because of unbelief am because his got stronger and stronger instead of him you know some people get older the being in the message longer and the fa get got to start questioning this questioning that more and more instead of their faith building up and getting stronger they start getting weaker but every see their fth get stronger right I'm stronger amen I'm stronger that of rapturing starts to change their body while they they start getting caught up in the Revelation first and then the Revelation begins to change that oh praise God forever more what are we talking about praise God we talking about things that they can't even dream to talk about amen hallelujah amen brother BR said rapturing faith is laying in these messages hallelujah amen if that's the truth then feed on the messages feed on the messages hallelujah praise God hallelujah what kind of offend are you being built up in right I trust TR and I believe and I am certain that I'm preaching the kind of faith that will build you into Rapture rapturing faith if you will receive it if you will believe it if you will obey it if you will just this message is not just it's not just fun and fellowship and and stuff like that but brother along with all those things which is wonderful it's a serious commit to listening and receiving the word for your listen to The Prophet no matter how many years you been listen listen to The Prophet that's where it lays it's laying in the messages right praise God I'm just an every other minister that's really truly anointed it's just the voice to be able to pick up the word and speak it so that you buying Revelation through the Holy Spirit can tap into the Unseen part of the word right that's what we have been used for praise God so no Pastor no Minister can give you Revelation you have to catch Revelation amen by the Holy Spirit you are the grace of God hallelujah amen oh praise God and uh let me get this away I'm closing now I'm closing don't get to the point where you say stop trying come on CU you know I make so many mistakes I stop so much and you know people arue with me some people in the message attack me and I don't know as much I don't know what to do praise God hallelujah what you need to do is live close to him and he will defend you right walking close to him he will defend you I think I told these brothers you know um I I you know my age I'm not going to tell you that when become like L don't tell the AG praise God but imagine my size now imagine when think about when I was like maybe s or 8 years old how small I was and those guys have want to bully me around and I have to back up because those guys are big and Bly and they're pushing you around and they're doing that because maybe you were doing well in school and they they either jealous or something they but anyway uh but when school was over and everybody's going out like when I stand near my brother ell brother I near him when the guy goes by who what you talking to today I look back there I know he's standing there as long as he's standing there you ain't going to do nothing much to me praise God that's what I'm trying to tell you you need to live close to the Lord hallelujah he said I'll be with you even to the very end of the age amen I will leave you I will leave you by yourself for the devil to continuously bully you but I'm going to be with [Applause] you so give Fai chance give the word of chance amen don't become an unwise virgin but be a wise virgin that will believe the word of God hallelujah God bless you all the musicians come here now praise God listen what kind of Faith what kind of a faith do you think to laugh to literally know that you are going to be there but that's the problem a lot of people in the message but today they feel safe tomorrow they feel lost today they feel safe the next day they feel condemned is that right Hallelujah my God you got to get to a place where you are certain amen right I'll see you in the Rapture I'll see you in the Rapture I'll see you in the Rapture I'm sweet name amen I'll see you in the Rapture I'm certain praise God oh but I know you you did this you did that you I don't care what I do is that right amen praise the Lord I don't care maybe maybe tomorrow the next day maybe uh maybe still up to do something oh you're a minister you can't oh no he still human doesn't matter who it is but doesn't matter what I know that the word of God Is Anchored In My Soul praise the Lord hallelujah because I know that I am certain of God and that's why I live the way he wants me to live I live the way the word says I should live Hallelujah I have eternal security amen amen I said I have eternal security that Jesus is mine and I am he nothing is going to shake me off of that thank [Applause] you Hallelujah remember the raptures of Revelation the reor is Faith Hallelujah and you got to have that kind of Faith to go out to here
