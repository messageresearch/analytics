turn to the word tonight God bless you Saints thank you [Music] amen hallelujah we want to continue tonight on the series of the power of tradition we want to talk about um as we said we went in through the the traditions of the Elders of the Pharisees and Sadducees and in the days of Jesus how they didn't recognize the revealed word for their day we took it down through the Dark Ages the nicadan spirit through the Catholic church we seen that Wesley uh Luther Wesley and Pentecost still carried a lot of traditions over amen like we know Luther he smoked the pipe he hated the Jews right but Faith was revealed to him that just shall live by faith so we can see that the Traditions were being carried over and we understand that in um in the last day we have the message and the message is two parts coming out and going in and we realized that brother Brandon was the seventh Church age messenger amen so he was preaching to the Pentecostals and a lot of his message was Pentecostal until it became a new book Hallelujah until the mighty angel came down we know the seals were breaking but then they were opened Hallelujah so we want to we want to just recap those things and we realize that which age that we are living in we're living in a different age today hallelujah it's very important to recognize the age and the time that we're living in this is the bride age hallelujah amen glory to God which the Holy Ghost can do only the Holy Ghost can do in this age that no man can do and bring you into that Capstone we understand that there are a lot of people in this message that are preaching Pentecost costal and a glorified Pentecostal message with the quotes but the Bride of Jesus Christ and that's what we want to focus now onto the Bride of Jesus Christ can only feed on him the mighty Angel she can't feed on men anymore like they did down Through the Ages but they only can feed on the Living Word of God hallelujah amen and that's where we overcome that's where we get perfect Faith that's where we get rapture in faith and that's where we get ready to leave this place amen hallelujah amen just a little overview here just to bring back you know it's a little time in between when I preach so we're going to go to um my title tonight is the bride will have the quickening power in the calf Stone she will have this quickening power that is promised to her that is prophesied to her in this day and age Hallelujah she's going to have it hallelujah amen let's go to acts 10:38 amen I just don't know which direction this is going to go in tonight but let us take it because we know we understand we want to talk about the quickening power we want to talk about I got a couple more messages along this line we want to talk about the Mysteries and we want to talk about the Thunders Hallelujah we we know like the church ages they all blend together so it's not separate separate separate they all blend together but they all they also are a different work of the Holy Spirit each and every one of them amen acts 10:38 how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power so the Holy Ghost and with power we understand that when the spirit of truth comes it'll guide us and lead us into all truth the evidence of the Holy Ghost is when the spirit of Truth the spirit of Revelation comes so with the Holy Ghost and with power who went about doing good and healing all that were possessed of the devil for God was with him and we Are Witnesses of these things which he did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem whom they slew and hung on a tree him God raised the third day and showed him openly not to all the people but unto Witnesses chosen before God hallelujah I believe we are witnesses chosen before God in this hour to see the things that we have seen we didn't see a prophet's Ministry and a prophet's life amen just to be glorified in a church amen but that was showing to us that we can understand and recognize what God will do in the future works of the church in the body of Jesus Christ amen chosen before God even to us who did eat and drink with him after he had Rose from the death and he commanded us to preach unto the people and to testify that he is which was ordained of God to be the judge of the quick and the dead let us turn to Luke 24:49 Hallelujah glory to God Luke 24:49 I send the promise of my father upon you we already know that that's already been spoken but T ye in the city of Jerusalem until ye be endured with power from on high oh God we can't do it without the power of God we can't do it without the quickening power of God the quickening spirit in this hour it's impossible to bring this word alive in us without it John 1613 one more scripture here how about when the spirit of Truth is come to you personally individually he will guide you into all truth and he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come Hallelujah amen my brothers and sisters we have been anointed to shift atmospheres and to break strongholds in this hour we've been anointed in this hour Hallelujah glory to God Amen let us pray father thank you for your love grace and mercy thank you for the reading of your word but most of all thank you for your spirit for your presence oh God for you have promised in the last days you'll pour out your spirit upon All Flesh Lord we know that these promises are for us tonight Lord we got faith in that tonight Lord You Lord you said where two or three are gathered where two or three with this kind of faith is in the midst then you draw near oh God and you come Lord and meet our needs Lord and our need tonight Lord Lord is just to get out of the way to receive to get into a place that to hear your voice oh God Lord grant these things Lord break the power of Satan tonight Lord break every atmosphere here father we have gathered together as Eagles together to Feast on the Living Word of God that comes from you tonight Lord oh God Shake every weariness every tiredness oh God in this place tonight father Lord and let us rejoice in your spirit and be refreshed with the word of God God tonight Grant these things Lord we ask in Jesus name God bless you as you seated hallelujah hallelujah glory to God quickening power amen we've been anointed to shift atmospheres and to break strongholds glory to God the quickening power is in the revealed word hallelujah I know they talk about the spirit out there they talk about being slain in the spirit Hallelujah but we're talking about the revealed word that's where the quickening power is in this hour in this day amen when the bride receives Revelation from the word of God especially from the word of God that's ordained for this day and this age that's what quickens her amen because there's a promise given to her in these last days and she must fulfill F that promise that has been given to her because it's been prophesied by a prophet about her to fulfill certain things in the word of God and only she can fulfill that Hallelujah and it's going to take Faith not only Faith but perfect Faith amen why is it perfect Faith because amen it's all been revealed it's all been been been revealed to her in these last days no secrets anymore to her Hallelujah to the Bride of Jesus Christ amen and I'm not talking about is for the all message for the whole message all message churches and everybody's in there no it's for the individual that God knows that is chosen amen hallelujah yes we can understand and see that all the Mysteries the prophet's message revealed all the Mysteries and fulfilled amen in the last days you'll know that when God sends a prophet all these Mysteries shall be fulfilled amen and you can know all the Mysteries all you want but there's something greater than knowing all the Mysteries Hallelujah there's something greater than that because a lot of people think they know all the Mysteries but it's not the Mysteries it's the life Hallelujah those Mysteries were revealed and they were fulfilled and they were restored Amen to lead us to the life of Jesus Christ the token in this hour that's what is supposed to lead us to Amen to the quickening power that's lies within the word the revealed word of the hour hallelujah amen remember this is in not in the hands of man this is in the hands of God hallelujah brother Bram in his hands he revealed the first pole he revealed the second Pole but he had nothing to do with the third pole he revealed up to the six seals but the seven seal he had nothing to do with it amen because it was left in the hands of the mighty Angel Jesus Christ himself hallelujah amen and that's where we are in this day and age Hallelujah only he can come hallelujah amen thank you Lord that's the hour we're living in we want to speak on the quickening power tonight Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah who wants that quickening power in their lives who needs the quickening power we all need the quickening power in our lives amen hallelujah it quickens us hallelujah into Heavenly places amen God is preparing us now for that time where the seals will be fully open to the individual you say brother Tim the seals are open yeah they are open but are they open to you not only that I said is this is this revealing is in the hands of God no man can work this up Hallelujah though you know all Mysteries all this all that amen but if you don't have charity you don't have the love of God Amen which is the life the token of God inside of you you have nothing hallelujah amen glory to God God Amen to bring her and her body you see Quicken her by his Spirit to bring life again in this hour Hallelujah glory to God the word of God Paul wrote here for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even dividing the suer of Soul and Spirit and joints of the Merill and is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart Hallelujah the word of God the word of God quickened the word of God brought to life in US amen is a discerner of all things where is that word today where is that word that God is spoken and prophesied where is it supposed to be it's supposed to be in living vessels in me and in you operating and manifesting in our lives glory to God that's what I want I want to see that word come alive inside of me amen then all these situations and all these issues of the flesh all these circumstances of Life all these things of sin and weaknesses in our body will come subject to that word we concentrate listen we concentrate on on on on the symptom amen uh uh on the branches but go to the root we want the root get down to the root of the problem amen and what is the root of the problem unbelief Hallelujah unbelief you do these things you doubt you fear you do all these things because of unbelief but we want that quickening power that is Promised amen that's what I pray Lord I want that quickening power that is Promised in my life Hallelujah to overcome glory to God amen amen the word Quicken is used in the King James version of the Bible and it means revive make alive if something is living it has been quickened something is to bring to life or restore to its former flourishing condition Psalms 2511 in the King James version says Quicken me oh lord for thy name's sake for your name's sake Lord preserve me amen for the sake of your name oh Lord Restore Life and new strength and energy and that's should be us in our faith amen hallelujah we cry out to the Lord Quicken me oh Lord preserve me strengthen me Quicken me energize me in your presence Lord glory to God I got a battle amen I got a word to overcome in my life and I need that oh Lord I Need That quickening Power Glory to God Amen Believers in Christ are spiritually quickened by God at the moment of Salvation you are quickened who were dead in sin and trespasses amen Ephesians 2:1 and Believers look forward to being spiritually quickened after death of the Resurrection if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you he that raised Christ from the dead shall Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you oh my is is this just quotes is this just reading the Bible or is this reality amen is this real in our lives this is the word of God that we must take in prayer in the spirit of God you can't get nothing unless you get into the spirit hallelujah oh I pray I pray do you pray in the spirit do you read the word in the spirit do you Worship in the spirit it's in the spirit that the word is quickened amen hallelujah am amen God's quickening Our Lives can affect us in many different ways by the power of God we can be quickened revived restored from sickness from discouragement from fear and of course from death oh yes amen this quickening power is going to destroy the power of death in this hour amen hallelujah when when when when when that last Trump sounds I believe that last Trump is sounded amen and the dead shall rise amen and the Lord will be waiting for us in the sky those who are alive and remain shall be what caught up quickened to meet the Lord in the air this is the hour this is the time this is why I get excited this is what I'm waiting for this is why I wake up every day amen and fight the devil on every hand and speak the word and believe the word every day this is why I come to church this is why I assemble myself together Hallelujah this is why I pray not to stay in this world not for the events of this world but to watch this prophecy come to pass in our lives amen hallelujah amen hallelujah and he can grant life for us for as the father raiseth up the dead he Quicken them even so the son whom he will John 5:21 the holy spirit gives life it is the spirit that Quicken the flesh that profits nothing he gives life oh brothers and sisters is that what we need in this hour I'm just trying to break something through here amen hallelujah God quickens us according to his word Psalms 119 in his loving kindness he quickens his associated with with his Tender Mercies his righteousness with his Joy he quickens Us in order to keep us on a Godly path Hallelujah the most darkest Wicked is age that we ever had in all of history is here now he quickens us he turns our eyes away from beholden vanity and Quicken thou me in thy ways oh Lord and to preserve a people who are called upon him he quickens us who we call upon thy name Psalms 80 Hallelujah we ask the Lord to Quicken our thoughts the Bible says bring every thought in captivity to the word of God we know we have a carnal mind and we know that this carnal mind this man can never do that but if we ask the quickening spirit amen the quickening power that has promised to us to do it he can bring every thought captive remember this word of God being fulfilled in our lives is not done by human it's not done by works it's done by the spirit of God not by might not by power but by my spirit sayth the Lord we need that quickening power in this day and age Lord the forces that are coming against us amen oh God oh my Lord Jesus we ask him he quickens our hearts when we are pulled by the enticement of this world so that we remain faithful to his word Psalms 80 but if the spirit is grown in us hallelujah he does that inside of you already oh Oh My Oh Glory to God brother Brown is speaking in all things here 1962 second Timothy 3 the Holy Spirit warns us that in the last days that the church would get away from the sincerity and the faith now he's not talking about the denominations he's talking about the church and the church is the message of the hour he said in this last day they will get away from that I'm not talking about the bride Hallelujah there's two different classes of people here the church we know that in every Church there's three types of Believers the make believer the unbeliever and the real believer amen you classify by Revelation who you are and what you see in your own life I can't do that amen hallelujah amen they'll have a form of godliness but they'll deny the power the quickening power that went with the right thing yes sir God hates a powerless religion experience and any religion today that hasn't got Christ in it is powerless Amen in 2 Timothy 3 1-4 he gives Timothy a long list of sinful behaviors and attitudes that are contrary to the word of God he tells Timothy to avoid these these states of these Christians this is Paul talking in the Bible to avoid certain Christians that are walking this way they have a form of godliness but who act like as unbelievers and they deny the power of godliness they deny the power that has been given in this hour to change us amen oh my listen brother Ram says God's word is God's word you can't compromise with it you can't change it you can't alter it it is God's word oh but the craftiness of man they take God's word and now they're taking the quotes amen and they're they're kind of polishing it this way and that way and what is it going to produce if it's not God's real word of God being spoken it's not going to produce the Bride of Jesus Christ brother Brandon warned in the spirit he says I'm afraid that ministers are not leading people to Christ they're leading them to a church but we got to lead people to Christ the life of God Amen the overcoming power Hallelujah rebuking sin getting our lives right amen not hide in sin not cover in sin but expose in sin that's what I want in my life for Lord David said if there be any evil any sin in me Lord take it out expose it bring it to the surface he says I don't want to go on that day Hallelujah I want to get it right here I want to get everything right here and the devil is so cunning moving in many different ways in this hour in this day and age to try to cover that sin to try to cover that unbelief that life but God is trying to unfold it God's trying to speak and expose it because there's got to become a bride hallelujah amen amen listen here then we'll move on those who have a form of godliness and those who make an outward display of religion they present themselves as Godly but it is all for a show wow all for a show there is no power behind their religion as evidence in the fact that their lives are unchanged oh my God can you imagine that this word of God that we have in this hour the anointing on the fivefold ministry the preaching of the word and their lives are unchanged I can't imagine it because all I can see in my life yes I got mistakes I fall down but I get back up because I cry out to the Lord hallelujah when I'm in pain I cry out to the Lord and He hears My Cry he speaks to me lip to ear Hallelujah he comes in ways to meet with me and show me things to come he comes in ways to speak with me so I I am not perfect in this flesh but inside in my heart I'm perfect like my father is perfect because I want what he wants what he has spoken about me I want to walk this walk I want to talk this talk I want to see Christ manifested in my flesh I want to see him overcome how can I overcome by him who is already overcome Hallelujah I need more of the spirit of God hallelujah yes the Holy Ghost has come to my life and give me the new birth but I need to constantly be filled with the Holy Spirit in my life the challenges are getting more and more as we go cuz this flesh is trying to hold you down down Hallelujah the devil's trying to hold you down he doesn't want you to go higher he'll make a treaty with you he'll make you feel comfortable oh most people are most comfortable in this message I believe God sent a prophet I believe the quotes I listen to tapes every day so comfortable but only God knows only God knows Hallelujah if that sin is being dealt with in your life life only God knows if you're surrendering not to God Only God knows if you're overcoming in your life only God knows if you're under obedience to the word of God hallelujah amen let's move on here the power of God should accompany the form of godliness is shown through the Holy Spirit and the results in a transformation of Our Lives lives the Holy Spirit indwells Believers 1 Corinthians 6:19 enables him to Bear certain fruits of the spirit like Joy like love peace patience kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness and self-control Galatians 5:22 we know that all that lies within the seat of God hallelujah that's why it says work out your own salvation don't work out my salvation I don't want you thinking about my life hallelujah it's none of your business about my life it's none of my business about your life but we have to work on our own salvation with fear and trembling Hallelujah glory to God Amen Hallelujah brother Bram speaking here in perfect Faith now remember they had power now we're going to make little turns here like I said nothing is cut in stone he's talking to the church here now they had power Jesus given them power to heal the sick and to raise the dead and cast out Devils just a few days before that they had the power but here we go now but they didn't have the faith to use that power oh God you see how it all ties together together amen there's a church the bride today these are his words the holy spirit is here with the power I believe he's here with the power oh God I believe he's here with the power I've seen his power move and operate Hallelujah but you haven't got the faith to move it we need that faith in this hour to move it Hallelujah we need him to come all we can do is be sincere all we can do is give our lives to him continue surrendering Our Lives to him amen calling upon him this is lamp triming time this is the hour that God Amen is trimming our lamps and we have to keep oil this fire of Revelation alive in our lamps amen we got to con be filling it and feeling it in this hour because God is fixing to move Hallelujah God is fixing to move to do great thingsall Hallelujah listen this is not over amen this is just winding up it's just ramping up Amen in this hour oh God see what I mean it takes Faith to move it like the word you got the fire in the gunun and the fire has to get to the powder the powder got the power but it's got to have the fire to light it off and the same thing the powers in the Shell but it needs Faith to charge it and throw it out oh my glory to God that's what it takes see perfect Faith to unite the power of the Holy Spirit which we have now since it's been Upon Us amen Faith to ignite to see great things in our faith we have it now my brothers and sisters hallelujah it's here now God has given us now God has restored everything the word of God to us now it's not up to anybody else but ourselves to take that word amen and produce that anointing in our lives to bring that anointing upon us and bring It Forward in our lives amen glory to God hallelujah smeared in church age here unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to Reign the reason for this is character simply never is made without suffering character is a victory not a gift and a man without character cannot Reign because power apart from character is satanic but the power of God Amen with character is fit the rule and that's what's happening in this hour God is building character through our suffering Amen in this hour to bring us to that place to rule oh hallelujah amen now my brothers and sisters Joshua Joshua in this age the holy SP Spirit was telling the people how do you bring this quickening power on how do you get into an atmosphere that we've been taught by the prophet not only by his life but by his words Joshua was telling the people to consecrate and that word is like in this hour in the day and age that we live in there's so many excuses in all of our Lives to kill that word consecrate Hallelujah but Joshua's telling the children of Israel if you want to see the glory of the Lord you're going to go see the glory of the Lord you're going to go see the pillar of fire you got to consecrate yourself you got to wash be clean it that doesn't change my brothers and sisters Hallelujah consecrate yourself Joshua says for tomorrow the Lord will do amazing things amongst you as he has promised to do in his word he's saying tomorrow but the Lord has given us a prophecy for this day and age that he's going to do great things amongst us this ain't it this is not all of it my brothers and sisters God is still fixing to move to do great things in our lives there's still more of those seals to be revealed and open to each and every one of the Bride of Jesus Christ we have to get to that place my brothers and sisters of rapture and condition hallelujah amen we don't want to be like them like in the Bible where they where where where God delayed his coming and what happened to them they started drifting away they start moving away where's the promise of his coming where's the promise of the rapture but this is the hour where the Bride of Jesus Christ recognizes that God is working in her life and also God is about to do great things and still ready to move in her life and fulfill more of this word of God hallelujah oh my and I think that's where the people get lost they get down they start looking for great sermons great messages to tickle their ears it's here right here oh the word the word the word but not understanding amen that the word has to be quickened and come alive but it only can be quickened in this time and it season and in the hour that only God knows what he's doing God didn't ask us to know everything Hallelujah even Jesus himself said he didn't know he says be ready be filled be your lamps trimmed and clear be filled with oil be walking in the fire of God amen amen hallelujah amen oh my the devil cools everybody down I know what I'm talking about I've gone through it you don't think I haven't been cooled down Amen brother Brown says I back slide time a thousand times a day I guide backside uh 2,000 times a day these are things that happen amen cuz we're in a body of Flesh Hallelujah I'm not glorifying the flesh I'm not making excuses for the flesh it is the Flesh and the flesh is the flesh amen but I'm looking to the promise Hallelujah I'm looking for God to fulfill the promise above my flesh above my circumstances above my weaknesses above my sins above everything because I believe the blood of Jesus Christ covers Us amen I believe the quickening spirit is here to Quicken us out of every dead every dead thing in our life Lord carnal mind flesh is all dead it's all death pleasures of this life pleasures of this world entertainment of this world the bride still feasting off of these things Hallelujah God waiting on waiting on the bride to get herself ready for what get her ready people misinterpret that you can't do nothing without God you can't do nothing without him revealing things to you but make yourself ready make yourself prepared as you know that you can do as a yielded vessel to God in your life consecrated dedicated to God not feeding off the things of the world Hallelujah you still love those things Hallelujah that is still in your heart then that's what you got to get out those desires God cry out for that quickening spirit of God to get those desires of those things out of your heart or else you're just doing it by law you're just doing it by works but inside you're still dead you're dead with those desires of the world and those things of the world Hallelujah but we have a quickening spirit here we have a quickening power we got a promise in these last days amen that if you're sincere and you consecrate amen hallelujah that he'll deliver you he'll set you free from these thingsall he'll change your lifeall Hallelujah there is a true amen experience with God a true birth in this hour hallelujah amen you see the devil attacks he attacks our consecration life he takes away the power from a child of God now listen brother BR is speaking here in the revelation of Jesus Christ now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts amen remember the vision when brother BR was caught up to heaven and the angel was standing right there we're not we're not just talking man's opinions here when the angel was standing right there and he said' will Paul be judged he saides Paul and his people will be judged for what he preached and brother Bram said I preach what Paul preached Hallelujah so brother bradam looked back to the early church the book of Acts and how they manifested in the spirit I believe if we get off of our high and mighty quotes and all these stuff the message and we go back to the the book of Acts and we see how the original Church operated how they functioned how they move how they lived their lives how they gathered themselves together how they prayed in the Holy Ghost how healing and power and miracles and life-changing situations were there amongst them it'll be a whole different story here instead of hiding behind quotes hiding behind you're in a message Church where's the power of God in our lives where is the quickening spirit that is promised to us we hear testimonies amen hallelujah I know it's not all about healing amen but that just shows when the power of God is confirming through signs and wonders there's a life inside there there's a life quickening that individual that's moving through them hallelujah amen let me tell you one thing there's a lot different when the Bride of Jesus Christ in this hour is moving moving and operating and laying hands upon the sick and they're recovering and healing then what's out there those Benny hings and all that stuff there's a totally

spot then he goes right to wag in war in that area to try to break you down isn't that the truth every single one of us he goes he knows the weak areas he he knows those areas that he can go and try to break you down first thing the devil tries to do is put a wall between you and God oh yeah if he can break the confidence that you have in your in the word of God there he goes amen there he goes he's got an upper hand that's what that's always his strategy to put up a wall between you and God whatever it might be in your life oh God ain't listening to me oh God is forsaken me he tries to do everything to point you away from God and say God is not with you because he knows if he can do that then he has free spot with that area in your life and he'll just go to work and attack that area Hallelujah soon as he breaks your confidence in God hallelujah that's why this word is trying to build you up amen Revelation build you up but listen it's got to come with much suffering Pentecost a true experience costes plenty in our lives and my brothers and sisters I don't care about the age I'm not here to tell you how to do it amen but we got to do it we got to do it we got to get to that place amen where we pay the price that needs to be paid in our individual life to get to that placed with God hallelujah glory to God Amen you feed on that word do you do you feed on the prayer do you desire to get into his presence do you know his presence Hallelujah people come into message churches hearing about the prophet hearing about all these great things and not knowing his presence listen I didn't know nothing about the prophet when I came in but all I know is I was experienced the supernatural in my life Supernatural Deliverance I was seeing this word of God and what was spoken I was seeing it displayed taking place and Chang in my life Supernatural deliverances Hallelujah where I'd wake up one go to bed one morning one night and wake up change the next night Hallelujah and all the time crying out to God crying out out for his word to be manifest amen crying out for him to reveal himself to him to me oh God you see what we're dealing with in this day you see what the preachers are dealing with with the atmospheres hallelujah oh my the age that we live in lukewarm lazy Hallelujah we all struggle with these things but listen the Bride of Jesus Christ is going to overcome these things amen Hal Hallelujah something inside of her it's not her something inside of her is going to push her out it's going to push her to another levels push her and keep pushing her and pushing her amen until that promise that's inside of her is fulfilled in this hour and this day and age amen hallelujah glory to God Amen it's through God's word that the Holy Spirit Comforts and sustains Us in time of Trials and afflictions Psalms 11992 where the writer is saying in effect if God had quickened me when I was in trouble I would have I would have perished if he hadn't quickened me but God had quickened me and he did it through his holy word in such times we should always turn to the word of God Amen there's nothing else to turn but the word of God Amen brother Brandon speaking an identification of Christ of all ages 1964 remember in the beginning God gave Adam and Eve was to stay behind his word hallelujah Satan he just misquoted one phrase of it and if one little phase cause all this trouble sickness heartache and sorrow one little phase will keep us out of it it takes away your passion for the spiritual things when you see prayer as a burden Hallelujah because of your job because of this day because of this age reading the word of God studying the word as a burden you're under attack from the enemy Hallelujah you're walking in the flesh and not in the spirit what do we do we cry out Hallelujah when a devil gets you alone without any overseer Hallelujah you are surrounded by the enemy to kill your walk putting you back into Old Lifestyles and habits I've seen it over and over in this ministry people leaving the overseers of the church the pastor the ministers Hallelujah leaving the fellowship going out there like a lamb amongst wolves Hallelujah that's why the Bible says don't forsake the assemble yourself together hallelujah it's it's not about this building it's not about your your your offices and in the church or your duties in the church it's about assembling around the word and the anointing of the word hallelujah it's not just me tonight it's me and you under the anointing of the word the anointing breaks the Yoke amen it breaks bondages you can come in here bound you can come in here you don't even know what you're bound with Hallelujah but you can't break free but you come in here the anointing breaks it hallelujah hallelujah if you cry out to God if you repent of your sins God let it go and let God have his way huj amen amen amen he'll just make you lukewarm out there a lukewarm believer religious twice as dead as you were when you were a sinner think about it twice is dead when you were filled with the love of God and you love to fellowship and be in his presence to hear his word to pray to forsake fleshly habits worldly pleasures there is only safety in Fellowship of the Holy Ghost with the chosen ones there's only safety there Hallelujah I've heard it all let me tell you I've heard all the excuses in this hour and with this internet thank God for the internet hey but the internet is a web it catches you Hallelujah it catches all kinds of things amen hallelujah hide behind your web amen because when you come into the presence of God is not you're coming into a presence of man but in the presence of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah when the Holy Spirit is gathering amongst with the Saints he can come amen we believe in that amen we believe that there's an invisible guest here that goes up and down the pews of your heart that can speak into your heart beyond words that a a minister can speak his presence is here to speak to you Hallelujah he has a voice and he speaks into Hearts still today amen he uses the foolishness of preaching Amen to create an atmosphere that he can come in and do and speak whatever he wants into your heart preacher might not have been speaking on a certain topic and he's talking to you about that topic Hallelujah remember David and when the prophet came to him and and described the man that took the the the the the man's last sheep in that he says kill that man he says David you are that man Hallelujah that's when God comes Hallelujah when you think you're right when you think you're walking right and then God comes and shows you something different Hallelujah that's the power of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives amen hallelujah we walk as individuals that is true but We Fight Together We join our faith together one to cast out a thousand two will cast out 10,000 you think it's just some some uh uh pride thing to where the Bible says come to the elders let them anoint you with oil let them pray over you God spoke that the elders didn't speak that God spoke it come amen come believe in the word of God that God said if you come and you obey and you subject to yourself then he'll come on the scene Hallelujah his main purpose the devil is to push fear into your heart he wants to launch You Into Darkness away from the protection of Jesus how the devil uses fear and unsettling images to stabilize a believer's mind pushing them further from God he has got a hold of your mind and only the power of God can set you free hallelujah amen how does he do that he can't he can't do that for long when you're fellowshipping here when you're fellowshipping under the word of God hallelujah amen that's where we want our faith we want our faith in the holy spirit this church what we call this church was built upon the holy ghost yeah men have stepped in in place and preach the word of God but it's always been the leadership of the Holy Ghost amen when man didn't know where to go when man didn't know what the next step was and what direction they go in the Holy Ghost was here to direct and give at the pointed time and season where to go and what to do that's what we believe in that's what we trust in more than ourselves and our abilities Even in our gifts in him the holy spirit so if that is the truth my brothers and sisters and if you believe in that that's why we assemble ourselves together here hallelujah believing that when we come together the pillar fire is going to meet us here that's what happened with the children of Israel they wanted to meet with the pillar of fire they looked and and and before they gathered around the the Tabernacle they look for that pillar fire to come down that's what we want that's what produces the change that we need in this hour amen hallelujah amen hallelujah do you see these signs in your life how can you break free from them how can you be free from the enemy's cage first you need to remember your maker remember your God oh everybody remembers God out there I serve God I'm walking with God hallelujah amen but you're like a goat Spirit you're remembering God and I'm walking with God but God ain't a goat Spirit God has assembled himself in the Bride of Jesus Christ he's assembled himself and chosen ones you know what those chosen ones love the fellowship they love to get together Hallelujah they love to fellowship amongst one another pray with one another Hallelujah break bread with one another that's where God is hallelujah amen hallelujah remember your maker when a devil attacks you many close to their hearts to God many running close to the hearts of God not to Mortal man but to God hallelujah hallelujah we must humble ourselves and return to him Hallelujah and he can lift us up yes you have fallen into your old habits but you shouldn't stop it shouldn't stop you from coming to Jesus once you just as you are come as just as you are he's not ashamed of you he's willing to deliver you from the enemy's oppression listen my brothers and sisters we we have to constantly be doing this we fall we make mistakes we get ashamed of ourselves but come to God Amen

people come to God over and over back and forth because they don't stay long enough they don't stay in die long enough and let God work they let God start to work and then all of a sudden they start
