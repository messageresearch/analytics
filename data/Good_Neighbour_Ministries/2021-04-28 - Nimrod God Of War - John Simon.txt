TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] it's good to be back with you on another wednesday night here is our bible study and may the lord bless us together as we enter into the word of god for these brief moments our scripture is found in genesis 10 verses 18 8. begot nimrod he began to be a mighty one in the earth he was a mighty hunter before the lord wherefore it is said even as nimrod the mighty hunter before the lord and the beginning of his kingdom was babel and eric and akkad and kalne in the land of shinar our subject today is nimrod god of war let us pray gracious father we ask your blessing upon this the word of god that we bring to your people to thee be the glory to thee be all the praise we lift you up father we exalt and adore you we magnify you by your words by our lives by everything we do and say may you be glorified father we humble ourselves in your presence that we may be used of of you as sons and servants of the living god captives to the word of god in jesus name we ask it amen and amen praise god hallelujah now nimrod god of war uh in doing this teaching we must touch briefly on history and we must must touch in particular on the history of nimrod himself the origins of polytheism the belief in many gods and the origins of mary olitree uh like you would say idolatry mary olivery and we will touch on the origins of ancestor worship ancestor washing now the neaness of history is the nimrod mentioned in the bible genesis chapter 10. now one pompeus speaks now nina's king of assyria quoting from history pompeus speaking nina's king of assyria changed the ancient moderate ways of life by a desire for conquest or war he was the first who carried war against his neighbors of course the first person for war was satan in heaven and now he's found some of his lineage on the earth one nimrod whom he is going to use and will be the first and is the first to start war and conquests of war on the earth now there it is he conquered all nations from assyria to libya as these men for these men pompeo is speaking he conquered for these men knew not the arts of war you see he attacked nations who did not know how to organize they did not know how to arm themselves with all manner of uh knowledge of warfare uh but uh so they were at a disadvantage and he attacked them and was able to conquer them another historian speaking theodorus ninus was the most ancient of assyrian kings mentioned in history being of a war-like disposition he trained young men rigorously in the arts of war he brought babylonia under him while yet there was no city of babylon you see now this nina started out to be great uh see he started out to be great now he built the city the the bell babylon or babel he's the one who built that city to that extent and you see he became great and became its king genesis 10 speaking of nimrod in the beginning of his kingdom and the beginning of his kingdom was babel and eric and acted on khalna in the land of shinar okay now we found out certain things here nimrod develop arts of war or strategies of war now recognize this that we know in history there are others like um the chinese general great a man who wrote a great book on the art and strategy of war but the original of all warfare all strategies and later on we will find out he started to invent evil things or weapons of war back then and you will understand what why for the bible calls him that he was a mighty hunter a mighty hunter before the lord now watch carefully now i believe that nimrod gathered his arts of war from satan who inspired him and the inspiration might have gone along these lines oh uh nimrod you are the most skilled hunter on the earth you know the strategies and the ways of animals how to trap them how to find them how to kill them you know the ways uh to do that and then the devil switched his thoughts think of it nimrod if you can capture animals in their dens if you can kill them by hunting them don't you see if you hunt men you will be just as successful i will make you a successful man if you will hunt men and the thoughts seem to make sense to nimrod because he knows the strategies already all he has to do is switch it over into the hunting of men so he began to apply all the principles and knowledge that he had from hunting and turned it towards hunting men through his arts of war and that is how big he became a god of war or the god of war upon the earth because later he was worshiped as a god and that is the reason why i took this as a topic nimrod god of war and he is the originator he is the evil inventor and creator of war he was the first to ever gather multitudes of young men and begin to bring them like an army he formed the first army and disciplined them by it said by drilling he started drilling and going through parades practice of various uh ways of defense and attack uh various arts of war and there through his drilling uh his training he instilled discipline and began to form squads and troops later on as you know we have battalions and so on but he started all of that and started that uniformity and militarism the spirit of war that dropped from heaven from satan inspired men of the earth and he then took that kind of evil inspiration and began to use it for his benefit to enrich himself to empower himself to elevate himself to godhood where he could have man following him and worshipping him there he is nimrod god of war of course babel was not yet a city babylon was not yet a city and from bay belt he built the kingdom of babylon and later became king of babylon the realize nimrod was the son of cush who was the son of ham and there in egyptian culture bell is called hermes and hermes is crush let me go back over that in egyptian culture bell is called hermes and hermes is cush and the bible tells us that cush begot nimrod now hermes means son of him and cush was the son of him now according to further history hermes was called that which means son of him he was the ancient prophet of idolatry he began to insert or uh instill the practice of idolatry on the face of the earth for before that time there was the knowledge of only one god one eternal self-existing being called god the eternal elohim and so he was with the spirit of rebellion broke away from the things of god and began to teach the people differently that there is not just one god there is many gods and these three are the most premium or prominent gods that you should worship and so he instilled idolatry and from that it produced the doctrine that we know today as the doctrine of the trinity on all forms of satanic worship that flowed from that now the hermes is interesting you see after god confused the languages of men at babel hermes or cush the father of nimrod made it his great effort to unite those languages in rebellion to god he told the people how he could he he could unite their languages cause them to understand each other uh right and when they understand each other they can continue their building of this great babel right to the sky regardless of what elohim said to them and there we understand that in fact was a cunning attempt of satan working through cush to uh get the people to rebel against god and the way of god god divided their tongues and now he is telling them it's a good thing like he told eve it's a good thing if i can unite you so you can understand each other and we can bring you into a unity but it's a false made unity which is not of god this is what is happening to the denominations this is the great division of tongues god cause allowed that to happen but he know in our modern age is forming a world council of churches and his attempt is to unite the tongues the united nations unite these demon nations and get them to speak or say the same language in other words we will put one doctrinal statement and everybody will have to ascribe to that statement and therefore we will be speaking as one of course they're not saying they will not stand for anyone else to disagree and tell them that's not the truth the truth is there is one god and his name is jesus christ same yesterday today and forever amen we know friends god started one original church one original faith and as in genesis so is it in the new testament that one original church was divided up into nations denominations and cause religious chaos and confusion for every one of those denominations are speaking different tongues different languages different doctrine different teachings contrary to each other but now he is telling them he's going to bring them into a unity he's going to use the world council of churches to do that you see he unites them by discipline by uh trying into jail all those who will not say what he is saying what he is teaching see god unites by the revelation of his word unites by his discipline and rigor and false sense of unity arising from his denomination denominationalism yes my friends and he does it just like nimrod did why do you nominational discipline i remember many years ago as a young man uh getting into a denomination and hearing them saying don't you mix and mingle with those other churches out there i or don't you speak to them don't do this and don't do that but god's hand was upon my life already and so i didn't care about that i was friendly with everybody but when it came to what i believed i told them what i believe and some turned away from me and others still good friends of mine but they know what i stand for and i'm not pulling any punches i tell them what's the truth and praise god there's a way you can tell people the truth with love paul said speak the truth in love you don't have to be obnoxious and overbearing amen we can disagree but you don't have to be disagreeable you just have to have the love of god in your hearts and realize that the people in themselves they themselves have been led astray by these teachings of man contrary to the word of god yes so they give them religious training training for baptism training for uh confirmation training for this and training for that discipline for this and discipline for that drilling this and drilling you into bible verses and drilling drilling drilling drilling all the time until everybody becomes into a uniformity and saying the same thing amen listen my friends one god and the true prophets will say the same thing but they're saying it not because it was drilled into them but they receive it by revelation from the presence of god and because god cannot change his word his first revelation is the original revelation founded in the word of god amen so we find out armies who history also calls mercury bell and he was also called uh janus these are all names of of the one person see cush who had these names in various uh cultures like that and so he introduced himself of hermes also means interpreter of the gods or interpreter of the words of god so he introduced himself that he is going to in interpret god's word for the people bell now court which is cush the father of nimrod was the ring leader that led the people away from the true god and encouraged the people to see him as the interpreter of the gods he is the one who encouraged them to go ahead with the building of the tower of babel and initiated all of that building but his son was the one that actually built the city of babylon he also encouraged the confusion and division of men at first so hermes meaning confuser and interpreter so on one hand he seems to interpret on the other hand he seems to be confusing this is very much from which the word came called hermeneutics hermeneutics which is something i studied while in the denominational uh college yes that is what they're teaching to this day in the religious universities and colleges hermeneutics teaching man how to be interpreters right and you see my friends god is his own interpreter he will make the word of god plain and clear to you if thou canst believe all things are possible to them that believe praise god made this study from history and the facts that we are seeing make sense to you and lay a foundation for what next we will be studying in the future now friends this is what the theologians of today are uh presenting themselves as that they are the interpreters of the word and uh if they can interpret any which way they want to interpret it but god's word does not change it remains the same you cannot interpret it differently but you stay with the word for god's word is not a private interpretation but by the holy spirit bringing the word to ca pass so kush now named hermes carl bell also named janus yes he actually was the originator and father of this polytheistic system which nimrah took up and expanded it for it was only one place in the earth but nimrod through war and true going to the various nations was able to expand it yes clearly friends we see here this confounder of the nations this one who destroyed the people by his strategies of warfare that he used now janus one of his names means two-faced so he is the two-faced god and that's what satan is religious on one side and the devil and ungodly on the other side and you'll find that in his children also very hypocritical because on one hand act like a christian move like a christian then go out amen like i say to my people singing the songs in the church reading out of the bible praising god on a sunday and then go out and live like a devil on the monday tuesday wednesday thursday come back again to be like a christian be like an angel on the sunday and go back to being a devil on the monday my god have mercy but that is what we face in our world today so this two-face janus this hermes this thief and liar this one who loves warfare and thank god we fight not against flesh and blood but against principalities powers and spiritual wickednesses in high places my god thank god forevermore amen so here we find out that it is said that he constantly rebelled against the one true god now believing in one god is called monotheism mono m-o-n-o-t-h-e-i-s-m which is completely opposite to poly theism right so he was rebelling against one god and the doctrine and teaching of one god so this worship of many gods we find out where it came from it came from kush nimrat's father was in babel which nimrod came later and turned into a magnificent city called babylon and went out from which was the beginning of his kingdom went out from there with his arts of war which he learned the techniques and strategies from his hunting days of hunting animals and turned his hunting abilities to hunting men and killing men and therefore he conquered everywhere that he went and by starting that religion of the worship of many gods then he became known as father of the gods because he started that religion so he is the father or elder or ancestor of that particular religion of polytheism now there we find out friends from there came ancestor washington because they began to worship him from there came the communion of saints because their worship their ancestors even after their dead of course we know in our bible for you to speak to the dead or pray to the dead the bible calls it necromancy it's witchcraft it's called necromancy and the biggest witchcraft operation we have today is praying to the so-called saints which are dead and we are not to pray to the dead somebody says oh well brother simon jesus died how come you pray to him well he said i am he that was dead but behold i am alive forevermore so he is not dead he lives forever more it's as much as saying you can kill god you can't god is not dead jesus christ is not dead and god can't die it's impossible so we pray to him who the eternal one and bless his holy name every other man you will read it in the bible and he you he lived for so many hundred years and he died so and so was great in the land and he did this this there's a history about and he died and you will read that throughout the bible come into human history you read the same thing and he died and over and over again he was a great warrior he was a great general he was a great king and he did this and he accomplished that and he died but of jesus christ hallelujah that killed him at calvary but behold he rose from the dead and says i am the resurrection and the life he that liveth and believeth in me though he was dead yet shall he also live oh praise god i'm so glad we serve a mighty god an ever living god an eternal god to him be all the praise the honor and the glory it was crushed who first introduced the belief in three gods a triune god or a god in unity tree gods in unity each equal to one another so they called it almost with of the same substance together the one god now that's what they he introduced and he taught that a father son and spirit he taught it in the form of father son and spirit of course now we have it as the father the son and the holy ghost but back then when he started it it was father son and spirit right and then he also knew about the seed of the woman promised by god in genesis chapter 3 i believe verse 18. and so something had to come out of that he had to have a representation and a picture of that well it came to pass that nimrod with all his so-called greatness died and his wife as we said before was semiramis and samuramas made herself mother of the son mother of cush's son that is her claim of course she was married to that son but now she says she is the mother of that son that means she became and elevated herself to the position of mother of the gods because cush who was the father of the gods was now dead nimrod the son of the gods was now dead and now here she comes mother of the gods exactly as we see churches today are propounding and defying mary and claiming that mary was without sin and that mary is the mother of god and claiming that she is the one that was actually uh caught up into the heavens supernaturally and therefore we look back and see the contrast with the bible and see how the doctrine of the holy assumption of mary being assumed into heaven it didn't come from the bible it came from babylon it came from the ancient past thousands of years ago in the darkness of idolatry and paganism here comes this evil doctrine now accepted in the modern times paganism has intertwined itself into christianity until christianity is now bastardized and it's been infiltrated and polluted by the sins of man and sins rooted in the idolatries of the past of course soon they have her as the one trampling on the serpent's head and the bible says he the messiah will trample on the serpent's head but if you were to go searching a lot of the history books and look at the pictorials different places you will find they have mary stamping on the serpent's head contrary to the word of god but in agreement with babylonian history and depiction they called her queen of heaven samurais was called queen of heaven today they have mary she is called queen of heaven they made semiramis divine today they're preaching talking that mary is divine and are so blasphemous to say that she is the mother of god she is not the mother of god how could god have a mother the eternal being the eternal one amen god has no mother no sir we will not discuss that now but that is contrary to the word of god amen mary who was the mother of jesus the body that god used to express himself they have now elevated uh mary and they said mary has immortality in other words she has eternal life just like jesus or god god has they made her immortal and she i think it was september 1964 they were discussing that to confer think about that man is going to confer on other humans immortality oh just think about that my friends then they call her mary the media tricks the media tricks now we know the bible tells us there is only one god and one mediator between god and man and his name is jesus christ amen and amen praise god hallelujah mary the mother so-called of all believers and now she is also called mary the mother of the church if there was ever a such a thing as babylonian ancestor worship going on in religion it is right now in the religion that issues forth from rome not only was ancestor worship originated in babylon but so also was the worship of nature mother earth mother nature father nature uh you know they began to worship nature and people began to worship trees and animals and different things of that nature and many gods the soon the sun the moon were identified later on as gods worshipped by egyptians and other cultures begin to worship them and so here it was friends when the sun began to be worshipped an egyptian called the sun ra and then we find he was called beal according to ancient history the sun god was baal right you will read of him in the bibles in your scriptures and you'll read it there and there it is friends and finally satan's heart's desire was fulfilled to be worshiped as a light giver reaching his light is not the true light but the light he gives is darkness in the hearts of man when he seduced the whole world like he seduced eve now he is using those same lies and rumors and darkness to seduce the entire earth in which we live now how did pergamos become the seat of babylon the seat of satan now babylon fell after a while militaristically it fell and when it fell at that time they had a the new king was attolos atulos and he was the pontifex maximus which means to say priest king or king and priest pontifex maximus anatolus who was the king of babylon the pontifex maximus of babylon or shall we say the priest king of babylon he fled to the borders of rome and fled with his pagan priests and with all their writings and so-called sacred mysteries and set up his kingdom just outside of the roman empire and tribed under the care of the devil right there my friends in conclusion we found out the origins of satanic warship we have discovered who how christian nimrod introduced the various idolatry the arts of war the strategies the drilling how to set up an army it was nimrod that first did it according to the bible we found also the origins of polytheism and science and invention what the bible tells us about the inventors of evil things the origins of polytheism or the trinity doctrine we also found the origin of ancestor worships today it's called communion of saints dead saints now think of it you should not pray to the dead we should not talk to the dead oh well that's for them to bring up different things in the bible that's another matter of discussion but jesus is alive thanks be to god amen they introduced meditative worship on the earth all these religions with meditative type of of worship on the earth they introduce the worship of mother earth and the worship of nature they also most importantly introduce woman worship the worship of women and this is what satan did by placing samurais who later is now called mary they are equating her to mary and worshipping semoramus under the giants of worshipping mary who is not to be worshipped only jesus christ is to be worshiped for if i be lifted up i will draw all men unto me there's only one god on the side me there is no other the only one god to be glorified and magnified but the introduced or there in putting in the minds of men by and women or people by worshiping mary subconsciously people are made to worship women or to worship a woman and come to that place where they can now place her in a position of rulership and dominance like that in that way also we learned how their worship of the red dragon the worship of serpents as we saw in the temple in pergamus that they literally were worshiping a living serpent in bergamos this is a lot of history here but i hope that you have noted these things and that they have laid in your hearts some foundations that we might understand the rest of the church ages and the times in which we live that we will be able to understand it better and some of the things around us may the lord bless you thank you for your time thank you for receiving into your heart the word of god for this day and for this hour we will be back next week to continue our study in the church ages trusting that god will bless us together as one in jesus christ and may god bring us to a place where we will begin to study how god denounced pergamos and the unbelief that was in pergamos where satan's seat was god bless you real good and let us come once again next wednesday around the word of god to continue our study of the seven church ages god bless every one of us one and all everywhere that we are god bless you take care [Music] you
