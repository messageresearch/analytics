[0:38] as I'm reading this scripture just keep
[0:41] that in your minds
[0:43] why do the Heathen rage and the people
[0:46] imagine a vain thing
[0:48] Kings of the earth set themselves and
[0:51] the rulers take counsel together against
[0:54] the Lord and against his anointed saying
[0:57] let us break their bands asunder and
[1:00] Cast Away their courts from us he that
[1:04] sitteth in the heavens shall laugh the
[1:06] Lord shall have them in duration
[1:09] then shall he speak unto them in his
[1:13] wrath and Vex them in his sore
[1:16] displeasure
[1:17] yet have I set my king upon my Holy Hill
[1:21] of Zion I will declare the decree the
[1:25] Lord hath said unto me thou art my son
[1:29] this day have I begotten thee ask of me
[1:33] and I shall give Thee the Heathen for
[1:36] thine inheritance and the uttermost
[1:38] parts of the Earth for thy possession
[1:41] Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron
[1:44] Thou shalt Dash them in pieces like a
[1:47] Potter's vessel
[1:49] be wise now therefore O ye Kings be
[1:53] instructed ye judges of the Earth
[1:55] serve the Lord with fear and rejoice
[1:58] with trembling kiss the sun lest he be
[2:03] angry and ye perish from the way
[2:06] when his wrath is kindled but a little
[2:09] blessed are all they that put their
[2:12] trust in him God bless you Saints enjoy

[34:25] recognize these things glory to God we
[34:29] want to talk uh today if you don't mind
[34:33] on this deceiving hour
[34:38] for we live in a very dark and dangerous
[34:42] time
[34:43] a matter of fact the Bible itself calls
[34:46] it in the last days perilous times shall
[34:50] come prophecy shall come and we you can
[34:56] read that chapter you will see all the
[34:58] things it's telling you supposed to take
[35:00] place in this day that we are living in
[35:04] and uh I'm glad that I can be here to
[35:09] identify
[35:10] um with the word of God
[35:13] in the sense that we not just I we are
[35:17] the Fulfillment of that word
[35:20] we are the living revelation of that
[35:22] word
[35:23] amen we are we are part of the prophecy
[35:26] and we're living in the Fulfillment of
[35:28] the prophecy and so our hearts rejoice
[35:32] in him in his great grace and uh Mercy
[35:37] praise the Lord
[35:39] I am just going to uh read Matthew 24.
[35:50] and we are going to read from verse 22.
[35:54] right on to verse 28.
[35:59] glory to God of course you know no one
[36:02] scripture can cover everything you want
[36:05] to say because now the scriptures is
[36:07] just a great circle on ending
[36:10] right praise God hallelujah okay let's
[36:14] read from the screen or from your Bible
[36:16] if you have it it's better for me to
[36:19] read from the screen because these days
[36:21] you know with the it's okay I can read
[36:24] it but it's easier for me to read it up
[36:27] there let me put it that way praise the
[36:29] Lord
[36:31] amen and accept those days should be
[36:34] shortened there would be no flesh saved
[36:39] but for the next sake
[36:42] those days shall be shortened
[36:47] then if any man shall see unto you law
[36:52] there is Christ
[36:54] or there believe it not
[36:58] for there shall arrive
[37:02] false christs
[37:04] and false prophets
[37:07] and shall show Great Signs
[37:11] and wonders in so much that if it were
[37:16] possible
[37:17] they shall deceive the very elect
[37:23] behold
[37:24] I have told you before
[37:27] in other words I told you beforehand so
[37:29] that you are warned you know what to
[37:32] expect
[37:33] you know what to watch for or what to
[37:36] look for I'm going to stop there so that
[37:39] we can go on into the word of God let us
[37:44] pray
[37:46] our gracious father before this
[37:49] righteous meal that you have prepared
[37:51] for us we pray that you will bless us
[37:54] bless our hearts bless the ground may be
[37:58] quickened to the word to receive the
[38:00] word and Lord let let it come to life
[38:04] let it live and let the word become
[38:06] clearer and clearer and clearer to us
[38:09] until we walk into the perfect light so
[38:11] you'll be all the glory praise and honor
[38:13] in Jesus name amen God bless you
[38:17] hallelujah amen
[38:19] oh my
[38:21] what an hour that we're living in
[38:23] but we are looking back and we're
[38:25] looking at the scripture
[38:28] that we just read
[38:31] because obviously
[38:33] people were already being deceived
[38:38] right in the day when Jesus was here on
[38:42] Earth
[38:43] now
[38:44] bear in mind that Jesus is the word
[38:49] all of the word of God
[38:52] and while he was here the same Satan who
[38:57] confronted him on the mountain
[38:59] is now was now confronting him
[39:04] uh
[39:05] in his ministry while upon the Earth
[39:10] when they could not defeat him the word
[39:13] they couldn't defeat him the Living Word
[39:16] then they had to or Satan had to
[39:22] um renew his strategy
[39:25] of being able to Blind them deafen and
[39:29] deceive people away from that word
[39:34] so many people were deceived and many
[39:38] were being deceived we have the same
[39:41] thing in our day many are already
[39:43] deceived and many are also being
[39:47] deceived
[39:49] now Jesus has told us that with the
[39:54] coming of the son of man that's the
[39:57] coming of Christ in the form of the son
[40:00] of man coming in the coming of the son
[40:04] of man here again
[40:06] uh well there will arise a time of great
[40:10] deception here upon us
[40:14] and he made it clear and I'm going to
[40:17] make it clear here by his grace that
[40:21] this deception now he wasn't talking
[40:23] about the deception in his day because
[40:26] he was on the scene and he could deal
[40:29] with that while he was here on the scene
[40:33] but he was prophesying in that hour of
[40:38] the coming of the son of man and you
[40:41] know the scripture where he says as it
[40:44] was in the days of lot
[40:47] so shall it be in the day of the coming
[40:52] of the son of man or the day when the
[40:55] son of man would be revealed
[40:58] amen praise God and he is saying that
[41:02] that will be a day of great deception
[41:07] and prophesying ahead of time again so
[41:11] that we are aware of what the deception
[41:13] will be
[41:15] he said it but come during the time of
[41:18] the Pentecostals and the Pentecostal age
[41:22] so well where did you see that where did
[41:24] Jesus say that well listen Matthew 7
[41:28] beware of false prophets
[41:31] if you ever had them it's in this day
[41:34] everybody is a prophet and they really
[41:37] don't even know what a who a real
[41:40] Prophet is
[41:41] many of them are mistaken a gift of
[41:45] Prophecy
[41:46] for a prophet who is a gift of God to a
[41:50] generation
[41:52] total difference
[41:54] right so it's a difference not just
[41:57] people that receive gifts to prophesy
[42:01] amen but the entire man
[42:06] that was sent is the gift of that the
[42:09] age or generation that the people are in
[42:14] listen to the Lord himself
[42:17] beware of false prophets
[42:21] who will come to you
[42:24] uh acting like Christians
[42:27] where we know sheep is is the people of
[42:30] God
[42:30] uh sheep you know your people are like
[42:33] the sheep or the pasture many scriptures
[42:36] will tell you that he's really telling
[42:38] you in this hour people are going to
[42:40] come under the guise of Christianity is
[42:43] that right but they're going to be false
[42:46] prophets
[42:47] right now he's going to describe them a
[42:51] little more you shall know them by their
[42:55] fruits
[42:56] do men gather grips of thorns
[43:00] or fix of Twisted Teslas even so every
[43:06] good tree bringeth forth good fruit but
[43:10] a corrupts three bringeth forth evil
[43:13] fruit a good tree cannot bring forth
[43:15] evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree
[43:19] bring forth good free
[43:23] every tree that bringeth not forth good
[43:26] fruit is Hyundai
[43:28] is that right it's going to be cut off
[43:31] it's going to be cast in the fire okay
[43:33] no matter how religious it looks no
[43:36] matter how nice it looks no matter how
[43:38] Cherry tablet looks this tree is after a
[43:42] while after its many branches it's gonna
[43:44] put out and all the fruits it's going to
[43:46] bear that's going to be cut down
[43:51] wherefore by their fruits you shall know
[43:54] them
[43:55] now listen
[43:58] not everyone that said unto me Lord Lord
[44:03] not everybody that says Jesus is Lord I
[44:07] believe in Jesus not everybody that say
[44:10] uh oh
[44:12] um you know Jesus died for my sins or or
[44:15] ran to the Altar and say I'm born again
[44:18] and that not everyone that says these
[44:22] things is truly born again
[44:24] and he's saying You must be aware of
[44:27] this because at that time the deception
[44:30] will be so strong that only this Holy
[44:34] Spirit himself will be able to
[44:36] differentiate it which means you don't
[44:38] go around judging people no but let the
[44:42] Holy Spirit do that for himself but I'm
[44:45] here to make you aware we are living in
[44:49] this power that is a deceiving hour and
[44:52] let God bear me with us here today and
[44:55] may the Holy Spirit of the Living God
[44:57] take his word and bear witness to what
[45:00] I'm saying not because I'm saying it or
[45:03] I'm anybody because this invisible this
[45:07] great one he is the one he is the word
[45:11] he gave his word and his word cannot
[45:14] return to him boy
[45:16] I believe it no you listen and now many
[45:22] will say to me in that day Lord Lord
[45:26] have we not prophesied preached in thy
[45:30] name
[45:32] and in thy name now we're talking about
[45:35] this this deceiving hour he is
[45:38] identifying what hour it will come in it
[45:43] will come in the hour the same time
[45:45] while the son of man is being revealed
[45:48] or revealing himself
[45:50] this devil will also start to bring in
[45:55] his Spirit of deception in a stronger
[45:59] way now we know the mystery of iniquity
[46:02] we know the trail of the serpent we know
[46:05] how that the darkness of sin and evil
[46:08] Started From The Garden of Eden we
[46:10] watched it travel down all of the ages
[46:14] until this hour that we're living in and
[46:18] we are encouraged by the Lord that we
[46:22] should be vigilant
[46:24] our eyes should be open we should be
[46:27] sensitive to the Holy Spirit we should
[46:30] let God have his way within our life and
[46:33] recognize what he is doing not yesterday
[46:36] we can give all the Bible studies on
[46:38] what happened to our thousands of years
[46:40] ago uh oh but what is God doing now
[46:45] is that right
[46:46] the Great
[46:47] I was or The Great I Am see God is an
[46:53] ever-present God
[46:55] he is not a dead God but he is a living
[46:58] God that is why Hebrews 13 8 says Jesus
[47:03] Christ the same yesterday today and
[47:08] forever the Eternal one the perfect one
[47:13] the reason one
[47:15] Christ who lives forever
[47:18] [Applause]
[47:19] more hallelujah praise God Amen no uh
[47:24] how they'll say have we not prophesied
[47:26] in thy name amen we're talking about
[47:29] these wolves in sheep's clothing
[47:32] we're talking about these uh Christians
[47:36] that outwardly amen Christians that will
[47:39] come sin have we not cast out even
[47:42] devils
[47:43] in thy name
[47:46] an invite name done many wonderful works
[47:51] miracles signs wonders they're gonna do
[47:56] them right oh my and then will I profess
[48:02] and say unto them I never knew you
[48:07] depart from me you workers of iniquity
[48:11] now now let's go to this what is
[48:14] inequity what is Iniquity
[48:17] iniquity is knowing what you ought to do
[48:21] and refusing to do it not doing it
[48:24] you're absolutely not doing it just like
[48:27] okay in knowing what to do but in
[48:30] Rebellion he doesn't want to do it he he
[48:32] just fought against it is that right
[48:34] listen now children of Disobedience what
[48:39] does that mean
[48:40] children of rebellion
[48:44] because Disobedience even to a simple
[48:47] appearance telling a child to do
[48:49] something and they don't do it and they
[48:52] refuse to do it it's a form of rebellion
[48:57] right God telling his children his
[48:59] people what to do how to do it and they
[49:03] don't do it and refuse to do it it's a
[49:06] form disobedience is rebellion okay oh
[49:12] my oh praise God now I'm quoting brother
[49:15] Branham saying here I looked that up in
[49:18] the dictionary to be sure
[49:21] for Rebellion is repelling against what
[49:25] you must rebel against something now
[49:28] rebel against what he said that is
[49:32] rebelling against the revealed word of
[49:36] God
[49:37] amen hallelujah now I want you to see
[49:41] there not that there they weren't
[49:44] rebelling against the written word
[49:46] they can give all kinds of Bible studies
[49:49] and all kinds of teachings on the
[49:51] written word
[49:52] that is fixed it cannot change the word
[49:57] of God doesn't change it's written it's
[49:59] here it doesn't change so he can get he
[50:03] can Rebel uh he can now go ahead along
[50:07] with the written War but when it comes
[50:11] to the revealed word that is being a
[50:15] momentum moment revealed from this word
[50:19] then he can't deal with that right he
[50:23] can impersonate this but he can't
[50:26] impersonate that and so it gets him in a
[50:30] a terrible state of being he doesn't
[50:33] know what to do amen remember
[50:38] revealed against they that rebelled
[50:41] against the revealed word of God I'm
[50:45] trying to pull myself here together
[50:47] right because I'm I find I'm being
[50:49] quickened okay and then it makes me talk
[50:52] faster so I'm just just trying to come
[50:56] to myself here amen listen
[51:00] Rebel rebelling against the revealed
[51:04] word of God
[51:05] just like King
[51:08] he rebelled against
[51:11] Abel's
[51:13] revealed revelation
[51:18] Abel's Vindicated
[51:22] revelation
[51:23] revindicated of God that it was
[51:26] righteous it was right it was true
[51:31] but he revealed he rebelled against it
[51:34] you see and Cain rebelled against it and
[51:39] slew his brother
[51:41] because of the Revelation that his
[51:44] brother had let me say this again you
[51:48] must understand when the Bible just says
[51:51] by faith Abel amen offered a better
[51:55] Sacrifice by faith what is Faith
[51:59] Revelation because of Revelation on the
[52:03] word the written word not that there was
[52:06] any in that day but because of the
[52:08] Revelation written word we can offer a
[52:11] better sacrifice
[52:13] but at the time when the Bible says that
[52:17] Abel revelation of knowing that it was
[52:21] Lamb's blood amen that had to be shared
[52:25] there was no writings
[52:27] there was nothing for him to refer to
[52:30] so how did he know
[52:31] you see that is the knowing that only
[52:35] comes from God that Daniel speaks about
[52:38] in Daniel 12 there will be a people that
[52:41] will come that will know their God
[52:45] God is the word they will know their God
[52:49] hallelujah praise God and I thank God
[52:52] that he sent a prophet in our generation
[52:54] and that the word of God has come to us
[52:57] and that word continues to unfold like a
[53:00] Roman Candle it keeps exploding and
[53:03] expanding and growing by the grace of
[53:05] God and that's why we are here this
[53:07] morning not just to listen to dead words
[53:10] but to listen to him the Living Word
[53:13] bring his word to us
[53:15] speak to us Quicken us straighten Us in
[53:18] this hour and the day in which we are
[53:21] living amen praise the Lord hallelujah
[53:24] now praise God of course we let me
[53:28] repeat again brother Venom didn't say
[53:30] that he they rebelled against the
[53:33] written word no sir but they rebelled
[53:38] against the revealed word of the Living
[53:41] God and that's where you always find the
[53:43] rebellion and the Rebellion comes
[53:46] because he doesn't know what to do with
[53:48] it he doesn't know where it's coming
[53:50] from he can't position himself that he
[53:53] could receive some of it and that he
[53:55] becomes jealous of the persons that are
[53:59] receiving that Revelation from the
[54:01] presence of almighty God just like he
[54:04] did with Abel jealousy caused them to do
[54:07] that and now it's the same thing coming
[54:09] again jealousy again because God is
[54:14] doing the same thing out
[54:17] Hallelujah he rebelled can't rebelled
[54:21] against the revealed word why did he
[54:25] rebel against it one he despised it
[54:29] how could it be a lamb
[54:31] oh this bloody rough crude kind of
[54:36] worship that he is presenting that to
[54:38] God and I have my flowers and my Altar
[54:43] and my candles and I have my beautiful
[54:46] Saturns and my you know purples and
[54:50] greens and Browns and I have my tiled
[54:54] floor and my plush seats and I have a
[54:58] wonderful attendance of people who are
[55:01] not of the lower class and the lower
[55:04] order but of the higher order
[55:07] how can that even compare with my altar
[55:12] My Worship my offering and then he comes
[55:15] out of nowhere where with this rough
[55:17] crude bloody having a lamb taking a rock
[55:21] sharp like a knife and hitting that
[55:24] Ram's neck until the thing is bloody
[55:27] bleeding the blood's praying on him
[55:29] everywhere until he himself is a bloody
[55:33] mess and then you have to tell me God
[55:37] accepts that the fire falls and drops on
[55:40] that sacrifice and leaves mine right
[55:43] there he doesn't recognize that those
[55:46] beautiful flowers are good
[55:48] but they are the works of his hands
[55:53] this other one
[55:55] by revelation
[55:58] God I can't explain fully what that is
[56:01] to you you have to receive that from God
[56:04] hallelujah just as much as I have told
[56:07] you and I've said to you even if your
[56:10] back has turned and someone is behind
[56:12] you
[56:13] you know
[56:15] but how do you know how do you know
[56:18] nobody has to tell you but you
[56:21] absolutely are positive and sure that
[56:24] there is someone standing behind you and
[56:27] you know it
[56:28] no Revelation is akin to that
[56:32] right not saying it's the same thing but
[56:33] it's akin to that you are believing and
[56:37] knowing something you have not seen you
[56:39] have not heard you you you just know
[56:43] we say oh well well uh you love your
[56:45] wife yes of course I love more how do
[56:48] you know her you don't have to just
[56:49] writing on a piece of paper there's
[56:52] something between you and her that goes
[56:56] back and forth that you are certain
[56:59] and the True Believer the spirit of God
[57:03] lives in this world going back and forth
[57:05] between your heart and the word of God
[57:09] nobody has to tell you but you are
[57:12] second of God you recognize who you are
[57:15] you recognize who he is and together you
[57:19] can say I am my father are one amen
[57:25] praise the god of Heaven hallelujah amen
[57:29] yes sir he despised the word the
[57:34] revealed word of God because it did not
[57:38] come in the manufactured human way of
[57:42] coming so he totally despise it in that
[57:46] way and because it despises it he
[57:49] disobeyed it
[57:51] and you also dissipated because of who
[57:56] that word was coming through
[57:59] why him not me you know because of
[58:02] course he thinks he he's more cultured
[58:05] he's more civilized he is more
[58:08] understanding and everything else like
[58:11] that and I bet he was more of a
[58:13] gentleman than than this rough crude
[58:16] Abel and so uh he just couldn't receive
[58:19] that he just could not see that not
[58:22] knowing that right through the Bible
[58:24] from start to end God always used the
[58:27] most unusual characters
[58:29] foreign
[58:31] is that right
[58:32] oh my it could never be how could it be
[58:36] a hairy guy like that with a a stinking
[58:40] camel skin stinks without your own odor
[58:45] mixed into that
[58:47] and that is all the clothing Elijah had
[58:50] forget this fanciful pictures of Elijah
[58:53] with his hand pointing you know artistic
[58:58] not cultural pictures and artistic
[59:00] pictures but the real fact the man lived
[59:03] in the desert and if you went to the
[59:05] deserts of Judea as I have and some of
[59:08] you have you will understand there's
[59:11] hardly any water anywhere and he had
[59:14] nowhere to go take a nice bath and a
[59:17] shower
[59:18] thank you
[59:20] I'm sorry I'm preaching like this
[59:24] oh my praise God hallelujah amen now but
[59:28] that isn't
[59:30] that isn't and that is why they also
[59:31] have a wrong picture of Jesus
[59:34] because Jesus is going wrong speaking
[59:36] great educated Greek and Roman and this
[59:39] and that uh we we know that Dr lamsa and
[59:42] many other other teachers let us know
[59:45] that he he spoke the Plain Street
[59:48] language
[59:50] amen sit down with the fisherman and
[59:54] they're laughing and they're talking and
[59:56] one of them say you know they're joking
[59:58] and then they turn around to Jesus who
[1:00:00] was sitting amongst them you know he
[1:00:02] wasn't sitting in a way to say I am the
[1:00:05] almighty God amongst you know he was
[1:00:07] just an ordinary man
[1:00:09] made himself of no reputation
[1:00:12] and one of them slapped him on the
[1:00:15] shoulder and said what do you think
[1:00:15] about Herod and Jesus turned I said how
[1:00:19] dare you ask me a question like no he
[1:00:22] said Herod he's nothing but a fox
[1:00:25] ah
[1:00:27] right oh my what is the truth
[1:00:32] nothing but a fox and they all laughed
[1:00:34] like that praise God you see but you
[1:00:37] must understand
[1:00:39] that God's uh children and his servants
[1:00:42] God deliberately uses them as a veil
[1:00:47] and he hides behind that Veil
[1:00:50] as it was in the temple with the badger
[1:00:53] skins the goat skins that were hanging
[1:00:55] there and the glory was behind those
[1:00:57] scans God does the same thing in our day
[1:01:01] in the most unsuspecting ways except we
[1:01:05] have spiritual eyes to recognize and see
[1:01:08] what God is doing not back there but in
[1:01:11] this hour this time what is God doing in
[1:01:15] this season and time your wind blows
[1:01:18] worth less than no man knows where it
[1:01:20] goes so are the sons of God born by the
[1:01:23] spirit of the Living God hallelujah amen
[1:01:27] yes sir so later not King now but later
[1:01:32] on we see that same Spirit of rebellion
[1:01:36] that Spirit of Disobedience that Spirit
[1:01:39] of iniquity amen that began working
[1:01:45] true Judas
[1:01:48] who was now with Jesus
[1:01:51] rebelling against Jesus who was the
[1:01:55] revealed word of that hour
[1:01:58] revealing the word and he's rebelling
[1:02:01] against the word maybe not openly he
[1:02:05] wasn't coming out and said Jesus I don't
[1:02:06] believe what you're teaching he didn't
[1:02:08] no no no no no no he was quietly
[1:02:11] listening to every word
[1:02:14] Jesus saying so that he could just make
[1:02:19] a critique on that
[1:02:21] right the Bible puts it this way
[1:02:24] they marked his mouth
[1:02:26] that means they had pen pencil and
[1:02:28] whatever and they just take notes on
[1:02:30] what he was saying and ready to take
[1:02:33] that and use the ever karmeneutic
[1:02:36] apologetic every logic every whatever to
[1:02:39] to break it down and prove it was not so
[1:02:42] uh of that nature like that but that
[1:02:45] Spirit had got a hold of Judas
[1:02:48] and was working through Judas you know
[1:02:51] what the Bible tells us he was the son
[1:02:53] of perdition
[1:02:54] he was born to deceive
[1:02:57] he was born to be a liar he was born to
[1:03:00] do that in that hour when Jesus was on
[1:03:04] the scene Hallelujah imagine that the
[1:03:07] word revealed the word Vindicated amen
[1:03:12] and the word living in that hour and he
[1:03:15] was rebelling against the revealed
[1:03:18] Vindicated living word for that day and
[1:03:22] for that hour and he was fighting it
[1:03:24] resisting it rebelling against it
[1:03:26] Hallelujah that's what he was doing
[1:03:29] right there amen yes sir oh my I quote
[1:03:35] again now the Roman caterpillar started
[1:03:39] eating on the tree the bright tree
[1:03:43] and Paul said I am persuaded that after
[1:03:48] my departing
[1:03:50] men shall arise
[1:03:54] amongst you
[1:03:56] you didn't say most viruses it is their
[1:03:59] Master's addresses he did not say among
[1:04:01] the epicureans the stoics or The
[1:04:03] Libertines or some other group no but
[1:04:06] they will arise from right amongst you
[1:04:11] you who are Christians amongst you
[1:04:15] Christians amongst you who I'm preaching
[1:04:18] to and I'm teaching the word of God Amen
[1:04:21] from amongst you will arise men
[1:04:25] Hallelujah well and I'm not sure
[1:04:29] Brethren uh like with sheepskins over
[1:04:33] them amen and with but with a wolf
[1:04:37] spirit on the inside
[1:04:39] oh my that will always try to be drawing
[1:04:43] you away
[1:04:45] amen after them
[1:04:48] you see for Paul continue to speak for
[1:04:52] the spirit of antichrist that you heard
[1:04:55] was to come into the world is already
[1:04:59] in the world
[1:05:01] and now working now working
[1:05:05] in the children of disobedience
[1:05:09] again I repeat this obedient to what
[1:05:11] this obedient to the revealed word
[1:05:15] they'll agree with you on you can quote
[1:05:18] scriptures and everything else that's
[1:05:20] wonderful and we should and we should
[1:05:21] always every Christian should read their
[1:05:24] Bible pray every day
[1:05:26] amen singing spiritual Psalms worshiping
[1:05:30] and glorifying God
[1:05:32] but what I'm saying is the very
[1:05:35] instrument the very thing that you use
[1:05:38] or you see God making himself known to
[1:05:41] you through the word he turns around and
[1:05:44] uses that very instrument as a means of
[1:05:48] Deceit deception to delude and to divide
[1:05:53] and destroy my think about it now we see
[1:05:57] it here clear in the word amen all my
[1:06:01] not not your 7 21-23 not everyone that
[1:06:07] said unto me Lord Lord shall enter into
[1:06:10] the Kingdom of Heaven as we read before
[1:06:13] but him that doeth the word that with
[1:06:17] the will of my father this is what the
[1:06:19] scripture says but I'm letting you come
[1:06:22] to understand what he's saying but he
[1:06:24] who does the word who obeys the word who
[1:06:27] lives the word of my father that's the
[1:06:31] ones right oh praise God for many will
[1:06:35] say to me in that day Lord Lord have we
[1:06:40] not prophesied in thy name
[1:06:44] and in thy name they're emphasizing
[1:06:48] their Christianity that they are also
[1:06:50] Christians okay and in thy name we have
[1:06:55] cast out devils
[1:06:57] and in thy name we have done many
[1:07:02] wonderful works miracles we've done
[1:07:05] miracles
[1:07:06] now people accept Miracle signs wonders
[1:07:09] tongues speaking in tongues and all
[1:07:11] these things as the evidence and uh it's
[1:07:15] absolutely not
[1:07:17] it's absolutely not the evidence
[1:07:20] acts 4 well I was I I was the Assembly
[1:07:24] of God I was in their Bible College and
[1:07:27] I was believing the same thing and one
[1:07:30] day while I was just a teenager oh my
[1:07:34] praying for this uh School mate for mine
[1:07:40] and the devil started speaking in
[1:07:42] tongues beautiful towns uh but in the
[1:07:45] middle of that let me say this and you
[1:07:49] received once something revealed to me
[1:07:51] that's not me that's him
[1:07:55] so we turned around and say Satan in the
[1:07:58] name of Jesus Christ we rebuke you in
[1:08:02] the name of Jesus Christ and that devil
[1:08:05] laughed laughed out loud
[1:08:08] also you caught me you caught me then he
[1:08:11] tells you know where he was from in the
[1:08:13] days of Jesus and he goes through his
[1:08:15] whole history down in France than in
[1:08:17] England it's gone in the country there
[1:08:19] and how he got into this person but the
[1:08:22] fact is what I'm trying to tell you it
[1:08:25] was right then the Holy Spirit revealed
[1:08:27] to me not all tongues
[1:08:30] is the tongues of the Holy Spirit
[1:08:34] not all tongues is the tongues of God
[1:08:39] some it's nothing but Devils get amongst
[1:08:42] the people unlocking the people of God
[1:08:44] and mocking the word of God under the
[1:08:48] guise of speaking in tongues amen praise
[1:08:52] God I can't go and say well all tongues
[1:08:54] is up there no you can't say that it's
[1:08:56] in the Bible but the fact is that is not
[1:09:00] the initial evidence
[1:09:02] because then it will be a faulty
[1:09:05] evidence
[1:09:06] but we know that receiving the word of
[1:09:10] God by Revelation in your heart is the
[1:09:13] evidence because you can't receive that
[1:09:16] word unless God had placed something in
[1:09:20] you where the Deep calls to the Deep
[1:09:23] and a deep must respond Hallelujah for
[1:09:27] what you're born to you're born to this
[1:09:29] word you're born to what God called you
[1:09:32] to be amen not what I want to be or what
[1:09:36] you want to be what what God wants you
[1:09:38] to be amen
[1:09:39] hallelujah o praise God I feel the pull
[1:09:43] I've Heard a Voice amen and it told to
[1:09:47] me the love and grace of almighty God
[1:09:50] hallelujah amen yes sir praise God so in
[1:09:55] this scripture what do we see Jesus is
[1:09:58] highlighting the fact that though these
[1:10:00] people were religious
[1:10:02] amen and all these people who are
[1:10:06] Spirit-filled
[1:10:07] oh my
[1:10:09] these people were Spirit-filled
[1:10:12] and and claiming to know him claiming
[1:10:16] that they're born again and everything
[1:10:17] else like that amen uh and then they
[1:10:21] begin to pile up their works and and we
[1:10:25] did this in your and your name and we we
[1:10:29] did this we cast out Devils we look I
[1:10:33] have seen and met with men uh ministers
[1:10:38] that got all kinds of gifts signs
[1:10:41] wonders miracles
[1:10:44] amen but it's another thing when God
[1:10:48] begins to reveal then once that devil
[1:10:50] gets mad what's that devil look you know
[1:10:54] some of you know of the case here a
[1:10:57] minister came by and they said oh he had
[1:10:59] a great gift and he can you know he's
[1:11:02] coming down the road and he can tell you
[1:11:04] what's up there and what's there and and
[1:11:06] so he came to preaching the church and
[1:11:08] in the middle of preaching
[1:11:10] I'm sitting listening rejoicing make
[1:11:13] everybody and all of a sudden that's not
[1:11:15] me again
[1:11:17] that's not me
[1:11:19] that's so so so so so so so so
[1:11:23] after it's finished he comes down you go
[1:11:26] into the office say well
[1:11:28] um sir I perceive that you are
[1:11:32] and identify what he really how dare you
[1:11:36] well tell me I'm this and I'm that I've
[1:11:40] been to other bigger churches and and
[1:11:42] they never I said but you're not there
[1:11:45] in the bigger churches you are here
[1:11:49] my deacons are here you want me to look
[1:11:51] foolish
[1:11:53] then just expose me if I'm telling a lie
[1:11:57] just say it's a lie and then I'll be
[1:11:59] exposed and I said but you know why
[1:12:03] you're not
[1:12:04] doing that because it's the truth and
[1:12:07] you know when you talk against that who
[1:12:10] you really are talking against right so
[1:12:14] he stays quiet like that I said well you
[1:12:17] know I can't let you stay around here
[1:12:19] you have to leave and of course you have
[1:12:22] to leave and of course
[1:12:25] three about three weeks later
[1:12:28] the RCMP comes to me and says we have
[1:12:31] this reference and so in jail
[1:12:34] because he did this this this exactly
[1:12:37] the same thing that I told him and he
[1:12:40] was saying oh I don't do that I am I'm a
[1:12:42] real man of God and isn't that they had
[1:12:44] him in jail
[1:12:45] oh my brother sister that's not to
[1:12:48] highlight me what's that for you to
[1:12:52] understand that there is a true and
[1:12:55] living God Satan has confused the issue
[1:12:58] by putting hundreds of thousands of
[1:13:00] these people talking about Miracle signs
[1:13:03] wonders healings this that the other and
[1:13:06] meanwhile God just has a simple
[1:13:10] ordinary View
[1:13:13] amen and works by that for his glory not
[1:13:18] for their Glory but for his glory that
[1:13:22] we might know that he is the great one
[1:13:24] he is The Great I Am we are nothing we
[1:13:27] are just Sons and Daughters walking in
[1:13:30] his will but he is the Mighty God all
[1:13:33] hail the power of Jesus name
[1:13:36] all praise God let Angels prostrate fall
[1:13:39] bring forth the Royal diadem and crown
[1:13:43] him Lord of all
[1:13:46] amen
[1:13:48] religious
[1:13:50] Spirit-filled
[1:13:52] claiming to know him
[1:13:54] claiming for what they did
[1:13:57] and what they did in his name
[1:14:00] but Jesus makes it clear
[1:14:02] in that hour because he's talking about
[1:14:05] the same hour when the son of man comes
[1:14:08] same hour like in the days of lot these
[1:14:11] things are going to happen and behold I
[1:14:14] have told you in other words beforehand
[1:14:16] so when it starts happening
[1:14:19] modern events
[1:14:21] can be made clear by this prophecy
[1:14:25] and you would recognize what is
[1:14:28] happening here because he says You must
[1:14:32] recognize they are nothing but actors
[1:14:35] they are impersonators
[1:14:39] and they are deceivers but I've told you
[1:14:43] beforehand that you might recognize
[1:14:47] Interlopers or those who try to climb
[1:14:51] through a window or crank through get
[1:14:53] through some other way to enter into his
[1:14:57] kingdom but Jesus said I never knew you
[1:15:01] is that right oh my we don't want to go
[1:15:05] off on that now but just to give you an
[1:15:08] Insight I never knew you
[1:15:11] Hallelujah the Bible talks about those
[1:15:14] whose names
[1:15:16] already on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:15:19] before the foundation of the world
[1:15:23] their names are written there already in
[1:15:26] the page white and fair in the book of
[1:15:29] his kingdom their names are there amen
[1:15:32] and so these ones your name isn't there
[1:15:35] you're posing you're acting you're
[1:15:37] impersonating you're deceiving you're
[1:15:40] even producing all kinds of uh made up
[1:15:42] proof that you know like that but I
[1:15:45] don't see your name on the page
[1:15:47] yeah
[1:15:48] let me go another way so if you did all
[1:15:51] these great works like Paul said in uh
[1:15:54] First Corinthians 13. uh you did all
[1:15:57] these works and all these Charities and
[1:15:59] all that it profited nothing
[1:16:02] your name isn't on the book
[1:16:05] so what is that
[1:16:07] now I want you to know this is the
[1:16:09] bright age
[1:16:11] we have already come through the seven
[1:16:14] Church ages
[1:16:15] all right and we are now in the bright
[1:16:19] age and as we said uh the last night
[1:16:22] this is the Harvest Time
[1:16:25] all the seeds uh natural and spiritual
[1:16:29] that were planted in Genesis down
[1:16:31] through the ages are now coming to their
[1:16:33] fullness and fruition is that right and
[1:16:37] now the Angels the servants The
[1:16:41] Messengers
[1:16:42] of God
[1:16:44] are here to pick up that Harvest and
[1:16:48] that's why we want to thank God that all
[1:16:50] the other other all the other Ages were
[1:16:54] believing Jesus will come in their day
[1:16:56] and take the bride away take the
[1:16:59] believing Church away amen but because
[1:17:02] we know we are there past the last
[1:17:06] Church age we know this is the rapture
[1:17:10] age this is the time when he promised he
[1:17:14] would come again and we are not guessing
[1:17:16] we are not hoping we are not maybe so
[1:17:19] but we haven't assurance
[1:17:22] foreign
[1:17:22] we have an assurance from him amen that
[1:17:27] is coming again to pick up his bride
[1:17:31] amen hallelujah praise God hallelujah
[1:17:35] now this age has been called by God's
[1:17:39] servant
[1:17:40] at judician age
[1:17:44] we know there's not really any words
[1:17:46] like that there is no but uh Judas
[1:17:50] Tyrion age uh yeah judiciarian age Amen
[1:17:57] in other words it's different from all
[1:17:59] the other ages that have already
[1:18:02] passed because all the other ages that
[1:18:06] pass
[1:18:07] had churches with the bride in them
[1:18:13] no matter how rotten no matter how evil
[1:18:16] no matter what they've done what
[1:18:19] whatever took place just like Jezebel in
[1:18:22] the Bible
[1:18:23] when Elijah thought I'm the only one
[1:18:26] that believes you oh great Jehovah I'm
[1:18:29] representing you God says that's
[1:18:32] wonderful and you're doing good work but
[1:18:34] I have some more in Jezebel's Palace
[1:18:38] there
[1:18:39] they're right out there
[1:18:41] right in the midst of that idolatry
[1:18:43] right in the midst of all that mess and
[1:18:46] they're eating from our table also and I
[1:18:49] want them to stay there until I'm ready
[1:18:51] to call them out
[1:18:53] is that right God has it that way even
[1:18:55] now
[1:18:57] amen praise God and so we see that the
[1:19:01] church seven churches they had churches
[1:19:07] plus the bride in the church
[1:19:10] but once the church ages have come to an
[1:19:13] end
[1:19:14] and we have moved from and the angel
[1:19:17] already cried Revelation 10 at that time
[1:19:21] time shall be no more not speaking about
[1:19:25] all time for the Earth but the time
[1:19:29] allotted for the church ages is now over
[1:19:33] past right and so then the bride steps
[1:19:38] off the end of the cliff and she already
[1:19:41] start moving into what we will use a
[1:19:44] human term
[1:19:45] Eternal Church age
[1:19:48] she not you can have something Eternal
[1:19:50] and at the same time being an age but
[1:19:52] that's just a term that we can
[1:19:55] understand but you're broken to Eternity
[1:19:58] by the grace of almighty God but when
[1:20:02] you break into that realm of
[1:20:05] Eternity no church can follow you there
[1:20:09] is no church over there the churches
[1:20:11] path it's the bride over there and she
[1:20:15] is walking under that Eternal presence
[1:20:18] and power of almighty God
[1:20:21] and she has kept not by uh Doctrine
[1:20:25] she's not kept by ministers and Priests
[1:20:29] having to watch uh every move you make
[1:20:33] and listen which they're doing their job
[1:20:35] and they're supposed to do their job but
[1:20:37] I'm just saying that the time comes when
[1:20:40] you're no more under School Masters and
[1:20:43] so on right where where nobody has to
[1:20:47] tell you what to eat and what not to eat
[1:20:49] and what to drink and what not to drink
[1:20:51] and these types of things right but
[1:20:55] praise God now when the bright crosses
[1:20:58] over amen there there is no church
[1:21:03] it's only the bride
[1:21:06] it's really only the bride existing in
[1:21:09] that realm because to be in that realm
[1:21:11] you've got to have eternal life
[1:21:14] to be in that realm you've got to be a
[1:21:17] germ of God a gene of God a son a seed
[1:21:21] son or daughter of the Living God that
[1:21:24] you have to be there praise God how you
[1:21:27] how they're going to be there so they
[1:21:28] can't be there whatsoever amen so it's
[1:21:32] only the bride up there now praise God
[1:21:36] in this church age so then the battle
[1:21:40] comes down now
[1:21:42] between not Satan hiding behind churches
[1:21:47] not Satan hiding behind church members
[1:21:50] using them as a veil but but it's Satan
[1:21:55] now has to come in the open uh to come
[1:21:58] against the bride and to fight against
[1:22:01] her amen yes sir as it is mentioned just
[1:22:06] as Eve had to come but face to face with
[1:22:11] the devil Genesis
[1:22:14] so will this eve at this end time have
[1:22:19] to come face to face with the evil one
[1:22:22] again
[1:22:24] right she got to have that battle with
[1:22:27] him again but this one will overcome
[1:22:30] because this one has the word
[1:22:34] this one has the sword of the spirit
[1:22:36] therefore she will overcome by the grace
[1:22:39] of God hallelujah amen yes sir Satan
[1:22:44] deceiving and impersonating and
[1:22:48] pretending to be a bride because now he
[1:22:51] can't he can't try to you know show
[1:22:54] himself like he's a church because the
[1:22:57] real bride recognize how he used the
[1:23:00] church our churches and work through
[1:23:03] them right in that way so he's got to
[1:23:06] change his strategy so he is also coming
[1:23:09] as a right too
[1:23:11] so he he is like you're right I'm right
[1:23:14] she might be a bridesmaid but he doesn't
[1:23:16] care he's going to still say he's the
[1:23:18] bride but anyway he's claiming that he
[1:23:21] is bright like that amen hallelujah but
[1:23:26] let this be known the servant of God for
[1:23:30] this hour has said did the real
[1:23:33] deception did not start until after the
[1:23:40] seals were broken
[1:23:42] deception was there all the time but now
[1:23:45] everything is coming into this
[1:23:46] consummation
[1:23:48] and therefore Satan got to come to a
[1:23:51] point where he started accumulating his
[1:23:53] evil to come against the sons and US of
[1:23:56] God for in them is all the righteousness
[1:23:59] all the Revelation all the word of God
[1:24:02] through all the prophets is accumulated
[1:24:05] in the bright Church of the last day for
[1:24:10] him to raise for him to fight against
[1:24:12] that he's got to accumulate his evil and
[1:24:15] everything else together to be able to
[1:24:18] come against her
[1:24:19] but we we serve a God who knows better
[1:24:22] than that for when the enemy comes in
[1:24:24] like a flood I will raise up a standard
[1:24:27] against him one shall chase a thousand
[1:24:31] true shall Chase ten thousand
[1:24:33] that is the promise of God we have in
[1:24:35] this world and we are resting on that
[1:24:38] amen thank God forevermore hallelujah
[1:24:41] amen yes sir praise God now you've got
[1:24:46] to realize just as I've hinted to a
[1:24:48] Spoke just now that Satan now has been
[1:24:51] accumulating
[1:24:54] natural wisdom
[1:24:56] intelligence
[1:24:58] he's been accumulating all the craft and
[1:25:03] shrewdness that he can accumulate down
[1:25:07] through all these ages mixed in with a
[1:25:11] lot of logic and lots of Reason uh
[1:25:16] reasoning powers and Gathering all these
[1:25:20] Powers together to come against the
[1:25:23] Bride of Jesus Christ praise the Lord am
[1:25:26] I really making sense to you here praise
[1:25:29] the Lord Oh Praise this wonderful name
[1:25:32] amen hallelujah now why is he doing this
[1:25:36] why is he all of a sudden getting
[1:25:38] frantic and starting calling up all his
[1:25:41] troops and Gathering his wisdom his
[1:25:43] knowledge because he's got to come to
[1:25:46] fight against faith
[1:25:48] for its wisdom versus faith
[1:25:53] and so he's got to have that all put
[1:25:58] together but all these things God if he
[1:26:01] receives if the devil reads his Bible he
[1:26:04] will know it's useless for it is not by
[1:26:08] might nor by power but by my spirit see
[1:26:12] it in the Lord God has promised that in
[1:26:15] his word amen by his Spirit God will
[1:26:20] fulfill his blessed holy word amen yes
[1:26:24] sir I'm so thankful for that that God is
[1:26:27] so great amen hallelujah now remember
[1:26:31] when Moses came in before pharaoh
[1:26:35] and when Moses came he took out his rod
[1:26:40] and with his rod
[1:26:41] he threw it on the floor
[1:26:44] and and they jumped back because the Run
[1:26:46] came into a snake oh my oh my well of
[1:26:52] course Jenny's and jambres Moses they
[1:26:54] said well what is that you think you're
[1:26:56] the only one can do that and they they
[1:27:00] just come out and they throw their rods
[1:27:02] on the ground but the rods became snake
[1:27:05] too is that right oh confusing the issue
[1:27:10] Satan always likes to confuse the issue
[1:27:15] and um
[1:27:18] what should I say
[1:27:20] create a circumstance of discrepancy
[1:27:24] where people begin to doubt the word
[1:27:26] because they're not sure because you
[1:27:28] have all these other alternatives
[1:27:30] is that right you have uh I mean you
[1:27:32] just yesterday I went to the grocery
[1:27:35] store and old man was there complaining
[1:27:37] look how many of these things they have
[1:27:40] all of them look the same but yet they
[1:27:42] they're slightly different you know
[1:27:46] you see you see why is it create a seed
[1:27:49] of discrepancy he created a seed of
[1:27:51] discrepancy where he can't be sure
[1:27:53] unless your mind your heart is on the
[1:27:58] original word and you don't take your
[1:28:00] eyes off the word but to keep looking at
[1:28:04] the word you keep looking away to Jesus
[1:28:06] you recognize him and you're still right
[1:28:09] with the word you don't sweat to the
[1:28:12] left hand nor to the right hand but to
[1:28:14] press on with Jesus and Jesus alone oh
[1:28:17] praise God I'm so glad I can say I'm one
[1:28:20] of them
[1:28:21] I said I'm glad I can send one of them
[1:28:25] amen one of God's despised few that
[1:28:29] stays with the word of God hallelujah
[1:28:33] I want you to know praise the Lord that
[1:28:37] Through the Ages
[1:28:39] Satan has actually mastered the
[1:28:43] manipulation of Miracles
[1:28:47] is that right
[1:28:49] Oh my he is mastered how to produce
[1:28:53] miracles
[1:28:55] he's even mastered tongues
[1:28:59] oh my they can we have uh brothers that
[1:29:05] were here that were in some of their
[1:29:07] great so-called Revival meetings and
[1:29:10] people claiming they get in the Holy
[1:29:12] Spirit falling on the ground and
[1:29:13] quacking like a duck
[1:29:15] rolling around and Hee Haw like a donkey
[1:29:20] another one hissing like a snake or
[1:29:23] claiming to receive the Holy Ghost
[1:29:24] ultimate they don't really know the Holy
[1:29:28] Ghost do you think any spiritual
[1:29:30] manifestation is the Holy Ghost but it's
[1:29:33] not amen because you've got the Holy
[1:29:36] Spirit and you've got Satan's Spirit
[1:29:37] working out there and the Holy Spirit
[1:29:39] God has to show you how to cut away and
[1:29:43] the difference in the midst of all that
[1:29:46] amen praise God hallelujah amen praise
[1:29:51] God so we see when his master tongues a
[1:29:54] mastered manipulation of Miracles
[1:29:58] but now he's come down to the real thing
[1:30:02] he can impersonate all those but now the
[1:30:06] challenge to him is this age now
[1:30:09] is to impersonate the word
[1:30:14] he has now to impersonate the word how
[1:30:17] are you going to impersonate the word
[1:30:19] unless you become the word
[1:30:22] or be a part of the word
[1:30:25] that's the only way amen praise the Lord
[1:30:30] hallelujah so we find out to conquer
[1:30:33] that his wisdom has increased
[1:30:36] to such an extent
[1:30:39] that he can literally
[1:30:42] 99.9 percent
[1:30:45] impersonate this message
[1:30:48] this form of Christianity he can
[1:30:51] impersonate it
[1:30:52] right you know some of the uh
[1:30:57] Christian Science as said
[1:30:59] can show more love
[1:31:02] and display more patience godliness
[1:31:06] some of those priests
[1:31:09] can show more of those virtues
[1:31:12] alter their lives
[1:31:15] than many so-called Christians
[1:31:17] isn't that right oh my look at those
[1:31:21] back in Jesus today those rabbis could
[1:31:24] you know take up
[1:31:27] a needle and stick it in the Torah and
[1:31:30] quote every verse without even turning
[1:31:33] the page and tell you where that thing
[1:31:35] is touching amen praise God challenge
[1:31:39] him the word well he they had wisdom of
[1:31:43] the word but he was the word
[1:31:46] and that's a huge difference amen oh my
[1:31:49] goodness praise God now we see here so
[1:31:53] close amen he's going to impersonate it
[1:31:56] so close until the natural person with
[1:31:59] your natural eyes you can't tell the
[1:32:01] difference
[1:32:03] you can't do it it's the Holy Ghost is
[1:32:06] going to have to come now and reveal
[1:32:09] that to you
[1:32:10] now under this atmosphere realizing can
[1:32:13] go on and talk and make known the word
[1:32:17] of God to you for another two hours or
[1:32:20] so
[1:32:23] not that I'm going to keep you for that
[1:32:26] time
[1:32:27] I'm conscious and aware of the moving of
[1:32:30] the Holy Spirit and so therefore I'll
[1:32:33] just share some more with you uh as we
[1:32:36] move on Hallelujah so we can't as humans
[1:32:41] just see that impersonation with our
[1:32:44] natural eyes or with natural uh wisdom
[1:32:47] amen praise the Lord but Satan's problem
[1:32:51] is when he had the written word there's
[1:32:54] something tangible he can look at and he
[1:32:57] can be a copycat
[1:33:00] he can impersonate it
[1:33:03] but when the word starts to come to an
[1:33:06] individual or individuals by the god
[1:33:11] Supernatural process of Revelation not
[1:33:16] from a bible school not from a college
[1:33:18] amen I I had all of that but the fact is
[1:33:23] that's not what Revelation is
[1:33:26] Revelation is God speaking to the
[1:33:30] individual
[1:33:31] praise God individual and Satan has no
[1:33:35] way of breaking into that encrypted
[1:33:37] communication
[1:33:40] foreign
[1:33:41] oh my it's beautiful it's just wonderful
[1:33:45] hallelujah amen but he has a problem now
[1:33:49] where the written word
[1:33:52] has a morphid itself
[1:33:56] into the unwritten word
[1:34:00] amen
[1:34:01] and how is he going to copy the
[1:34:04] unwritten word uh I'm talking so much
[1:34:08] that the you know the seven Thunders
[1:34:10] when the seventh thunder sound you heard
[1:34:14] the sound but what did the voice say
[1:34:17] what what I'm saying is he doesn't know
[1:34:20] what the voice said or is saying but he
[1:34:23] knows there was a sound
[1:34:25] there's a sound there's a gospel sound
[1:34:28] it's a Bible sound and he can go on with
[1:34:30] all of that and the titillating uh the
[1:34:33] ears and minds of the people but for the
[1:34:36] real truth and the revelation of God's
[1:34:38] word to penetrate the hearts and lives
[1:34:41] of the people that is not the doing of
[1:34:43] man that's the doing of the Holy Spirit
[1:34:46] and if I stand here and I spoke to you
[1:34:48] no matter what I say to you here and the
[1:34:51] Holy Spirit was not here and he doesn't
[1:34:53] confirm the word it doesn't mean that
[1:34:56] amen praise God hallelujah amen God
[1:35:00] wants to take me here like you did
[1:35:01] Philip and put the American talk to
[1:35:03] thousands of people in a Revival breaks
[1:35:05] out amen praise God he wants to take me
[1:35:08] and put me in a house where I witness
[1:35:09] only to two people they get comforted
[1:35:11] amen praise God whatever God wants
[1:35:15] that's what I want that's what you
[1:35:16] should want that's whatever every one of
[1:35:18] us should walk
[1:35:20] praise God glory to God hallelujah so he
[1:35:24] can't see the unwritten word he can't
[1:35:27] know the unwritten word but he can make
[1:35:29] a 99.9 educated guess
[1:35:34] of what it is
[1:35:36] and then try to let you talk to you and
[1:35:38] act in such a way as if I got it too I
[1:35:42] know it too I I receive it too I receive
[1:35:45] the same you see there's all kinds of
[1:35:47] Christians
[1:35:48] but in the midst of that you have
[1:35:50] believers
[1:35:52] you have unbelievers and you got
[1:35:55] make-believers
[1:35:57] and you the holy spirit of God has got
[1:35:59] to distill crystallize all of this and
[1:36:02] make it clear to you and I I can't do
[1:36:06] that as a pastor or as a preacher the
[1:36:08] Holy Spirit has to do that on an
[1:36:11] individual basis
[1:36:13] through the believer praise the name of
[1:36:15] the Lord hallelujah my next thought was
[1:36:18] here the hour is dark and God has just
[1:36:22] now started
[1:36:25] to show to us Satan's deceiving
[1:36:29] activities
[1:36:31] within what we call the message
[1:36:36] is that right let's let's end here uh
[1:36:40] for today by the grace of God and may
[1:36:42] the Lord richly uh bless every one of us
[1:36:45] here in the house that don't watch uh
[1:36:47] Washington come here music praise the
[1:36:50] name of the Lord let's Worship the Lord
[1:36:52] of wild would you mind
[1:36:56] hallelujah amen
[1:37:01] thank you
[1:37:06] I repeat we are not here to produce a
[1:37:11] nice religious presentation
[1:37:15] it's not something that we are we're
[1:37:17] here to produce a beautiful singing uh
[1:37:21] preaching something that can go on the
[1:37:23] internet and bring in thousands more of
[1:37:25] people and that sort of thing no many of
[1:37:31] you know that that's not what I am about
[1:37:33] right not at all but we are here to for
[1:37:37] God to call in
[1:37:39] his Chosen Few
[1:37:42] his little flock
[1:37:45] the speckled verb
[1:37:48] and so on that is what we are here for
[1:37:51] and that's not something we can do he
[1:37:54] knows his own
[1:37:56] and he said I have them in the palms of
[1:37:58] my hands and no one is going to take
[1:38:00] them out
[1:38:01] why because they are kept by the power
[1:38:05] of God through faith
[1:38:07] amen praise the Lord hallelujah
