uh hiding in our sister's heart but God plac it on her heart now and finally she's unveiled it and so here we are we're able to have the blessing and the enjoy and prise and we want to thank the Lord for that amen well um last week we started started out by um starting to tell you that we'll be talking about the signs of times and uh actually in fact let's read first of all out of Matthew 24:4 Matthew 24:4 let's I'm going to read from verse three and we land verse four uh as he sat upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world and Jesus answered and said unto them take he that no man see for for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many and you shall hear wars and rumors of wars and see you may not troubl for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet and Nation shall rise against Nation Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be famines pestilences earthquakes and diverse places these are the beginnings of Sorrows amen praise the Lord father we have just read your word and we ask your blessing of Honor that you will break the bread of life to our hearts and give us strength for the journey give us oh God understanding that we might grow in your grace we wait upon your your coming father and while we wait we're feing upon the word of God we ask you to break it like you broke it by the Sea of Galilee and we ask your blessing now in Jesus name amen praise the Lord God bless you please be seated now we're not going to be um extra long or anything like that a middle of the week you you have lots of stuff in your mind or unless the Holy Spirit move in some special way and keep us here until midnight other than that we stay with with the um sensible actions that we should take amen now uh what we want to talk about is the in the in this age in that we living in and under the inspiration of the message that we are in the atmosphere around it the atmosphere in the entire world is using Brother Brandon's own words you must not misinterpret the word of God very true I'm talking about the dangers of misinterpretation danger of misinterpreting the word it's not that you don't have the word you may even have the true word but you end up misinterpreting the original word that you had because you're not looking at it and seeing it in the right way now we this age of living in is filled with a lot of that uh Believers are putting the emphasis in on different things that are not very not as important as it should be like the one man that was arguing with brother Brandon about how Jesus is going to come and U you know he said well it's not whether he's coming on a cloud it's not important that he's coming on the wind it's not important whe he's going to step from star to star or whe he's going to come down from heaven in The Chariot the main thing is he's coming but what I'm so use Believers get sidetracked and because they get sidetracked and that's a trick of the devil to make you think you got a revelation in the word uh and I'm thinking of a a certain brother that used to be us years ago and he Lov to dig into what he thought was deep stuff when he read A Thousand Years is as the day with the Lord of course she grabbed this computer thousand years is a day did that means that uh a thousand years is an evening gone or whatever he brought it down that therefore 1 hour is equal to so much so much you know and therefore he started to calculate and that means that the coming of the Lord should be around such and such a Time by his calculation then he'd have studies that he would do on the devil he studied the devil and the devil's Behavior and the devil's character I said brother you're you're heading for trouble that's right it's in the Bible I mean know who the devil is but why waste yourself studying about the devil why don't you study God you know I said if you have a white sheet of paper and I took a pen and just put one spot you don't have to ask me what's black because the spot appears and you right away you recognize it other than that you're heading for trouble and you going to misinterpret the word uh you look around there is millennialist people that believe that Jesus W come to the Millennium the Rapture would took place uh there's premillennialists like us we believe the Rapture is coming before the millennial right we believe that absolutely that he's coming before the Millennium praise God but there's actually people that teaching that Jesus is not coming after the Millennium uh of course some believe that they they're going up their their Rapture is going to be with the Jews and that they um to be saved you got to be a member of the honor of for C or else you're lost that's you have a witness doctrine of course and of course when they come to my house with that they don't come anymore I asked them I said well are you one of those 144,000 they said well well well no because those are the ones sealed the forign you know one this I said well what if you're not a 100 part one of them what are you doing here what do you have to say what what actually you have to offer you see you have to be certain of God you can't guess about what you're doing you got to know who you are and you have to know that you know a Believer ought not to be opera on Spirit of giil a Believer are not to be operating on a spirit of condemnation amen we have not to be operating on the spirit but I'm hanging on I'm hoping and I trust I'm going to make it true no the prophet of God said you got to get to a place where you are sear of God search of God the word the Revelation the truth that it is thus say of the Lord and you can say like those thousands that were up there beyond the ve when they said he said I teach what Paul teach they said and we are resting on that praise God that's the way we ought to be resting on that that is th say the Lord nothing else we don't have to worry about nothing else amen praise God because we know he was he was a true Prophet amen there's no question about it and if he's a true Prophet don't you see how foolish you are just the question what the prophet is saying better you say I didn't understand what he was saying but don't say he was wrong don't say he didn't know what he was saying don't say well God you know called him to be a preacher and he tried to go out there and become a teacher and that's the reason why he messed up not knowing that a prophet a a genuine Prophet is really God in a body making himself man now don't get me wrong I wasn't I'm not saying brother Bram was God but I'm saying that the prophet is a divinely ordained body placed in a certain age so that when God comes to interpret his word for that age he has a body waiting that he can use it for that hour is that right and he he told us he would have that that he'll come manifest himself through Malachi 45 amen praise God so brother coming on the scene when he open this out to speak it wasn't brother Bram saying oh this is God speaking no it was God speaking through the prophet the spirit speaks through the prophet and saying thus sayth the Lord hallelujah in the old messes call looking onse used to have them in a big real to real text you can actually hear in the in in a part of that sermon I remember the beginning when he was making some comment all of a sudden a voice spoke out this is not William bradam speaking this is the Lord God Almighty come down William BR only Lord be his voice and his body thus sayth the Lorden who is saying thus say the Lord the Lord is s me right and that's the same thing with Moses Moses opened his mouth to say well God told me that he was I am that I am I am that I am sent me but it wasn't like that just in the word when Moses opened his mouth to speak the voice spoke out and said I am that I have amen but Pharaoh couldn't understand that God hiding in a human Veil and therefore they misinterpret the word and there's a lot of misinterpretations going around right now but it must be because Jesus said in Matthew 4 there will be false Christ amen false Christ it means false anointed ones praise the Lord you said anointed ones oh there must be the Antichrist no Prophet said in uh in the uh book of the message he was speaking on the message he start the rain falls on the just and the unjust amen the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit falls on the just and the unjust both on the SE and the nonse he said but the nonseed has nothing in them to be rebor but the seed has something in it to be rebor but the anointed ones at the end time that's the message I was just trying to find where he said that he said that it's the same genuine holy ghost that falls on the believer falls on the other on it's the same rain fall on the weed and it falls on the we it's not a different Holy Spirit dropping on those Pentecostals it's how they interpret and manifest their anointing that comes on them the anointing drives us to the world that's right their anointing drives them to signs and wonders amen they're lust and thirst after that we thirst after the word because we're in a higher uh demena yes amen we're not in the first P second P anymore we in the third p amen CH is the Myst God revealed listen what he said he said watch 2:00 the second p is over the t is at hand he said did you hear the music it went into a higher octave right there glory to God hallelujah and that the entire bride and the understanding and interpretation of the Bride went into a higher OCT by Revelation for the word of God Amen praise God that's where we are here today brothers and sister Hallelujah we not Supernatural we're caught up already in the mystery amen amen you are a part of that mystery amen is that right you're a mystery to them is that right but you're a revelation when they need Christ amen so God hides in you and me and he hides himself and reveals himself true you and me when he chooses to do so oh praise the Lord Jesus Hallelujah so we are surrounded by misinterpretations and everything else now um we know that that has a reason and that's a purpose God uses that to do what like it said in the book of Psalm how that that which we must be shaken will be shaken is that right so that the things that should will remain but the foundation of God standed sure and the Lord know why because the Keystone the Cornerstone was laid in you before the foundations of the world to God hallelujah you have Blessed Assurance not because you're handing on and holding on but because you got a anchor a seed that was plac in the soul before the world a seed was there ready W the to do what anchor you to the word of God without that you be acting like everybody else but that's keeping us God true great Revelation that's how we kept praise the Lord glory to God Amen so the misinterpretations around you when they come don't let the devil use it to scare you realize that God is using it to shake the old tree so that the roots can go down deeper it didn't come to break you it came to make you is that right amen that's what it comes for so when you look around and you see all the misinterpretations and this one is fall away from the message they don't believe the prophet or he was wrong with here he was wrong with there listen the best thing you can do is shut your mouth brother BR said if you don't understand the best of don't say nothing amen amen right don't say other than that if you're going to say something say well I don't understand but before when I got in the message I heard the message being preached I heard serpent seed not preached but reading it in the books about serpent seed about one God water baptism I didn't understand everything but something coming out of those books and those messages and those tapes hit my soul and I believ everything before I understood is that right before I understood it intellectually I believe it in in the room Hallelujah the man in engine room grab the whole of it andc me and it willon let me go I'm still here run for Jesus keeping me alive am praise the name of the Lord God hallelujah amen so don't let these misinterpretations that going on around on the internet many knows about that all on the internet people that were in the message for 25 years I say oh I wasted my life I thought it wasn't truth God help you5 years and here's one that just come in just the other day and they say oh my God I never heard anything like this praise the Lord hallelujah you see it's clear unto you is given to the the mystery of Amen King that is not praise the Lord uh one will be two will be in a bed one will be taken the other left two will be in a field gospel field amen they in the same church amen sitting in the same f one will be taken on the order of death Hallelujah you think it's waiting till you know who will be left behind they're being left behind right now by the Revelation Gap taking place right now you're left behind right now amen you don't really know it but you you better realize it you're left behind the Revelation Gap is increasing increasing increasing it's too late it's God and you didn't know about it praise the Lord so uh I'll make the point again do not be shaken or worried about all these Devils that are flying around amen hallelujah am praise God Amen some of you know that late last year uh couple of Brothers turned up here oh this is wrong that is wrong and I I don't see that in the scripture and this is not right what about this and what my goodness hallelujah amen well you know I don't have too much patience with the [Music] devil amen praise the Lord thank you Lord so so of course the first thing I said I said first of all uh you're talking to somebody older than yourself listen to how disrespectful you are you tell me that's the spirit of God Amen I said secondly you're talking to a Elder in the gospel and you you have to have respect you don't even have that and you calling that the holy spirit amen I said cly you're how long you're in message oh I've been in message 3 years and I know the word really oh you went 3 years mhm wonderful praise God Amen I said there you go again see so I said all I'm going to ask you is that don't bother coming back here because the deacons already are going to be told that you shouldn't set foot here in regards because I've got I've got young lambs and sheep and different ones coming up and I don't want you to friend to spread your foot on mouth disease you know uh uh this kind of stuff like that so that's it and so we said that straight by the grace of God but these Spirits are flying around amen you know a couple of weeks later I went up to brother Brooks to minister there and he say oh you know brother Simon do you know so and so certain Brothers came up to my church he said and the funny thing they arrived when I wasn't there and he started saying all kinds of confusing stuff and he said one of the deacons had the presence of M to call me I was he was way away somewhere else he said put him on the phone and brother Brooks did the rest so they hit the road and they left there about a month later but Elijah gets here praise God brother I want to know about two brothers you know that came by here you know do you oh I said oh my goodness I said brother I should have maybe called you ahead of time and kind of forward you or something like that and the next thing you know I'm heing they're up in new BRS with they up down here there over all over the place and but I'm not focusing on them I'm just saying that is the evidence that there is a spirit of misinterpretation seduction and illusion that's loose and it's operating right now and you need to do what hold to God's unchanging hands hold to God unchanging hand no worry about these things taking place upon you you see the word for the hour you're blessed just by your eyes being open bless are your eyes bless your heart because you yes here praise God Lord praise God sometimes we come to church and become so uh we so used to the message we think we're just as simple Ordinary People you know we just Christians are we walking around like that no you are a different part of the human race you are a part of the super race you are the super for the Y you are the fleshing red light that is coming call out by the grace of God hallelujah praise God you walk into any place and no matter how you try to hide after a while they going to know who you are right they know what kind of person you are they first of all say you different something about you watch it it's the genuine Holy Spirit and the devil go near it that's the reason people fear it but it's good amen hallelujah now I want you to know that the first misinterpret of the word was Satan brother says that clearly that Satan was the first one to misinterpret the word and he misinterpreted to Eve and he said now we see there the result of misinterpretation was what sin and the and death and sickness and suffering of the entire human race amen now Satan did that we see the evidence of it so therefore you know that any misinterpretation of the word that will be the fruits of it and that is what it will Bear right I think he says choosing of a bride he was saying he says we must be able to have the have the word of God pre straight direct is that right amen amen hallelujah he said because if you're going north you can't afford to Veer just even a little teeny bit he said down here it looks like nothing but if you keep walking in that little teeny uh thing he says by time you get a way up you're 200 miles up from you're supposed to be right because when you started you misinterpreted is that right you weren't going in the right direction not the place he puts it this way he says you got to line up your back side and your fright is that right praise God you understand what he's saying you got to line up history and you got to line up modern events being made clear by history you got to line the C things up in other words when you look at what's going on in the world today you are able to interpret it supernaturally by what the prophet has brought and interpreted the the trail of the serpent is that right the path of the the of of iniquity trail of iniquity of ungodliness and also of godliness amen the two seeds coming down we follow the path all the way and we look through history and he's given us all the CES so we can look at the day and interpret what's going on now Hallelujah and so we are a blessed people we are a blessed people Hallelujah Lord thank you Lord we we we actually know the news not just reading today's news but we know the news before they amen hallelujah we know one day we going to see a bigline say Angeles Sun the SE amen we we know these things because Prophet spoken thus say the Lord amen praise God so uh don't uh approach the word from the point of view because holy men of God did not write the me the word by private interpretation but they wrote the scriptures as they were inspired by the Holy Ghost so in the words I like the Bill Anderson song where he says I hel a pencil but he wrote this song I can do nothing alone I can do nothing alone I weak but my savior is strong I only held a pencil but he is the one true me that wrote this that's how they wrote the Bible it was men holding the P oh yeah he wrote it I saw him with the yeah but it was God writing it through them is that right Hallelujah wow praise God they are misinterpreting the word for the hour I better move on Hallelujah look where we at here now praise God Amen so we see here that you got to and understand uh also to be able to interpret and recognize your day and the message of your day to interpret the hour and the seasons that you are in is that right if you don't know what the season is that you are in you will misinterpret the word by trying to interpret a Lutheran lifestyle is that right in h a Capstone age or you're trying to live a Methodist lifestyle you see you're interpreting the word for that hour but not for this hour there's people writing the message they still interpreted interpreting Malachi 4:5 7 Church age I'm not understanding that sunset Mountain he came down is that right shout boys trumpet and the prophet who was bringing the word a prophet is interpreter of the word now God took him away because he wants to move that visible uh personage out of the scene so that we could look away to Jesus amen is that right we can look away to Jesus because he came down to do what to become that God is his own interpreter and he will make it CLE that he could whisper this bright ear lip to ear by revelation of the word of God that's right and she can now have confidence in the Revelation she is getting not only basing your salvation on what brother Bron told you that was a foundation for you to get your own faith amen is that right amen faith comes out of Grace is that right you can't have faith without Grace said no man can study himself Pi up a revelation he says Revelations by Grace God gives you a revelation by Grace therefore these are the words that he said not brother Brandon but his grace is greater than your faith amen amen praise the Lord God's grace is greater than your faith praise the Lord because without Grace you didn't have anything to believe on Grace made Faith possible Revelation possible Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ and then Faith come and set all that amen so his grace is greater than our faith praise the Lord now see why we need need to understand and and not allow the devil to cause misinterpretations to upset you is because we are we we are now in the time where the Gentile Church age is starting to phase out as you know that the ages don't end abruptly like this this right they don't just end that's Pentecostal interpretation they think the raptures will to come only on a certain day and end like that and by the next morning tribulation begins but we know that he talks about the blending of those ages they overlap is that right and they run right out right like that time shall be no more that's not same time um natural time by the clock is going to stop The Day the Earth Stood Still he's not telling you that but he's saying time shall be no more it's the the time for this prophecy to be fulfilled the time is up it's got to be fulfilled amen this is the hour when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son amen so you understand that so we have got to understand clearly here that the ages are the age being in the Middle where the age is changing now this whole thing is going back to the Jews amen praise the Lord amen praise God listen to what he says here notice here that the trumpets is a called Together For A Feast for a war for a person or for some sacred day or something like that oh yes see now you got the background now of the seals and the church after that we're going into the trumpet the Trump trumpet sounded trumpet in not war or a feast day and so on or what it means is a gathering together of the people the trumpet hallelujah praise God now you understand that the same another place he said the same seals that were open to us and the same thing that he preached he says to us there the seals and it's the revelation of Jesus right but when it goes over to the Jews and the two witnesses deliver it that's the Feast of the trumpets to them right now we are feasting on what a seven course meal by the greatest Chef the world has ever seen we're feasting on that se course meal right now and when the trumpet that trumpet sounds we raptured out the here right that's what he's talking about he said it speaks of War but also speaks of the Gathering Together of people and right now it's a uniting Time praise God it's a uniting time so we are uniting by the pull of the holy spirit amen not by people Gathering us some conventions but we are united by the Holy Spirit just like the wise men were United they didn't know each other one up in India the next one in Persia the next one and something pull their spirits and they start traveling to find this word this newborn message this word of God for the hour traveling and you know you know I've said it before brother BR Watchman watch what of the night how that as they travel on the earth them three stars up there representing the men on the earth that's why your your your your whole um what you call it your your signs of your life is tied right back here amen so while they're moving those Stars moving on the up there they're moving on the earth here and what happened those stars have to unite to become one big star is that right it's a prophet made us know that we thought it was one big bright star but he understand no it was Jupiter Venus and Mars all come together one star God is one God whatever came together as one Hallelujah but the thing about it when they were moving in the heavens the men were moving on the earth and when those stars come together like that these people that didn't know one another their paths crossed and they met amen hallelujah and they found that they saw the same thing believe the same thing and heading in the same direction they come from the East and the West they come from the land ofar to Feast with the king the D's guest how blessed these FS are we're United not by man putting us in a church building and saying oh you are no it's the Lord Jesus Christ himself by the opening of the word that United you United us together Hallelujah we would have never even dream to know one another just sitting here is a miracle Prophet said you think you just walked in here in a building like this he says your Holy Spirit Led your here tonight sons of God are led by the spirit of God Amen the footsteps of the righteous are what ored ordered of the Lord amen you were ordained to be here at a certain time certain place Hallelujah ordained to do that and here you are the Fulfillment of Prophecy it's becoming unto us to fulfill all righteousness everything written in the word of the Living God hallelujah amen so we he says Paul said when the trumpet gives an uncertain sound you who can prepare themselves for war or for peace or whatever who knows we have to know what the trumpet sounds and when the trumpet sounds we see something in the Earth today we see great trouble everywhere everybody knows it everybody is come the age has become neurotic the whole world is now a neurotic world I'm speaking from Feast of the trumpets here I think is Page 135 amen oh oh my everybody they have become thetical world and we know there is something wrong he says even to them there in the Pentagon and everywhere we know there is something wrong new not place he said it shall come to pass the whole world will go you know why they it's just like in demon possession I've seen people uh cast out the devil from somebody and it jumps on a person because they're not covered by the blood right is that right they're not protected by the blood all of a sudden this person was insane the next thing you know they have a clear mind next thing you know somebody scream over there they become insane because that devil that was making that person sayane jump and get on the other person that had no covering they have no covering at all amen and that's what's happening with us by the prophet bringing the message amen you been washed in the blood and not only that uh you've been given back your right mind Hallelujah because he brought you out of insanity insane in sin not much difference there he brought you out and Paul said now we have the mind of Christ and because you have the mind of Christ it anchors you and everything that's going on around you amen not that the devil is going to try to harass your mind and give you a little thing and this like that but he can't actually take control of you that's right because you have the mind of CHR amen Christ in you your hope of glory amen without him we can do nothing without him we'll surely fail without him we like shift with a mind that's loose and drifting amen without the sail but with him we are anchored we Anchored In Jesus who be fear no B of we praise the Lord hallelujah amen praise the Lord so he says we got now there are three must in Scripture that you must not do you must not interpret misinterpret the word Christ is revealed in his own word page 72 you must not misinterpret the word you must not misplace the word and you must not dis dislocate the word amen so you must not misinterpret the word of God but you must understand what it is praise the Lord now I won't go into all these quotations that I have here where he said he said they started out first by Mis misinterpreting him the person Jesus Christ that misinterpreted him and then in another message called God being misunderstood it's actually the same thing they misinterpreted him of who he was they misinterpreted his actions they calling me El every other name like that they didn't know who he was so misinterpreted the very God that they serving and they're misinterpret the very Bible that they're reading the very message that they're reading they misinterpret the word of God for the hour you must not misinterpret the word you got to have the right interpretation and for you to have the right interpretation in the word you got to have Revelation is that right Hallelujah W people were back in the days of Luther and while they were in the back of Luther Wesley came Wesley came because they had no revelation of Wesley they remained manifesting Luther's message and though it was right in their age when they brought that over in the age of from Luther and they brought it over in the age of Wesley it became a misinterpretation of the word for that day is that right and all these all these uh people right down from Luther Wesley Methodist all of them come right down and they miss the prophet's message they're trying to live a Christianity which is a misinterpretation of the word are you follow amen they living a Christianity that is a misinterpretation of the word praise God you got to know uh what your lines are you got if you if you're an actor in the play and um you have Act One 2 three write up to act 78 whatever you the the the whole book of Acts anyway so there you are and um you just step on the stage you not you don't have any understanding of the script you have no revelation of the script and you stepping out on the stage when it's not your time that's right or your time is passed and you going to step out on the on the stage and you misinterpreting you you're you're interpreting something and your interpretation might be beautiful there's a lot of people out there that look like real Godly Christians you couldn't touch them is that right oh yeah but they are trying to project a past age into the present age when they failed to recognize their day and the message for them and because they haven't recognized that they're sincere they're genuine but all they're producing is a misinterpretation of the word of God and that's what they're giving to the people and it's so seductive that a lot of people buy into that is that right am praise the Lord hallelujah wow think about it listen what did the prophet say the angel tell the prophet don't get your lines Tangled in these kind oftimes is that right well you can call it officient line there but that's not the line that he's really talking about it's your lines from the play that you're supposed to speak when you step out is that right praise God brother Brandon I believe that sister hatti right is that right said you said the right thing you said the right thing Our Lives w tled she said what she was supposed to say at the right time she she had it right she had it strength praise God and when you do that the right word gives you a right work amen no wonder her son's got born again praise the Lord hallelujah but you see you suppose I were to come and I'm speaking Lutheran lines in Act 7 I'm trying to speak you got the line tled up amen you've got to have the word for the hour revealed to you you to be able to speak it amen by the anointing of the holy spirit is that right Hallelujah we are not operating under the inspiration of brother William Mar BR there a lot of people still trying to do that walk head this that everything we are under inspiration of the mighty angel that came down and the mighty angel is the Covenant angel that he said is no one other but Christ himself that's inspiration amen and his Spirit quickens the word for the hour his Spirit quickens the word for the hour makes the word live again so that we can produce a book of thoughts no acts our actions interpret the word amen praise the Lord Jesus hallelujah amen praise God for more just give me a little bit more time you don't mind praise the Lord so we have got to listen carefully and we have to exercise uh great wisdom in listening to what we are hearing and uh and what uh people are telling us not that every time you hear something wrong you're ready to jump at it no BR already give us a little hint he said you you have a whole pie there you eat the p and you spit out the SE is that right oh I scared to pass by the Catholic church because of end up going back and and you know doing an well you're not really born again because instead of you be scared of the devil the devil to be scared of you they are to be asking you don't bother coming back thank you Jesus no it's true thank you Lord they want to be ask you not to come back amen because there's something about you that disturbing the atmosphere whatever praise the name of the Lord Jesus Hallelujah because I've had that happen to me where I go someplace and the and the Witcher the wizard said I can't do nothing until you go away you got to get out get out of here before I can do anything right because a lot of Believers don't know their power and their Authority and their person and who you are amen we are the sons of God we are the sons of God
