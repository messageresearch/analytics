[18:47] revive and drawing Closer to You Lord
[18:51] that's all we are here for Lord to be
[18:53] drawn closer to you in Jesus name
[18:56] amen um okay as we have two
[19:00] scriptures um it's taken from
[19:03] John chapter
[19:05] 16 I think vers um 20- 24 and Revelation
[19:16] 197 if you got it say Amen
[19:29] John
[19:31] 6 okay Revelation 19:7 let us be glad
[19:36] and
[19:37] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[19:39] marriage of the Lamb is come and his
[19:41] wife had made herself ready John 162 to
[19:46] uh
[19:48] 24 verily I say unto you that ye shall
[19:52] have ye shall
[19:55] reap and
[19:56] lament but the world shall rejoice and
[20:00] he shall be sorrowful but your sorrow
[20:03] shall be turned into
[20:07] Joy a woman
[20:09] when a woman when she's in travail has
[20:14] sorrow because the hour is come but as
[20:17] soon as she is delivered of the child
[20:20] she remembered no more the anguish for
[20:23] joy that a man is Born Into the
[20:26] world and ye now
[20:30] therefore have sorrow but I I will see
[20:33] you again and your heart shall rejoice
[20:37] and your joy no man taketh from
[20:40] you and in that day you shall ask me
[20:45] nothing very verily I say unto you
[20:48] whatsoever ye shall ask the father in my
[20:51] name he will give it to you in the last
[20:54] verse he have you asked nothing in my
[20:58] name
[20:59] ask and you shall receive that your joy
[21:03] may be full let's pray Heavenly Father
[21:08] please bless the reading of the word and
[21:11] bless our fellowship with you in Jesus
[21:14] name amen please be
[21:17] seated one thing that we have to be
[21:20] conscious of and aware is
[21:23] that anytime we come here I believe
[21:27] Jesus Christ is here before even get
[21:29] here because the prophet said that if
[21:32] you are the angel of the Lord if you
[21:36] keep consistent time he always going to
[21:39] be there before you you get there so we
[21:42] are not here to see one another we are
[21:45] not here for any other thing else but to
[21:49] Worship the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[21:52] that's our own purpose to be drawn
[21:54] closer to him to live here better than
[21:57] we came
[21:59] and in every sermon you get what you
[22:03] expect either you live here more closer
[22:05] to God or you live here more away from
[22:08] God it depends on what you expect and
[22:11] you get what you expect so as we read
[22:15] from Revelation 19 it says that the
[22:18] marriage of the Lamb has come and his
[22:21] wife had made herself ready so the
[22:25] marriage take place if I'll title it I
[22:28] would say the bride or the wife had made
[22:32] herself ready that should be my title
[22:35] she has made herself ready amen that
[22:38] should be my T So as we read from John
[22:43] I'll come back to that title but as we
[22:46] read from John 16 he said a woman when
[22:50] she's in travil has sorrow but as soon
[22:53] as she is delivered of the child she
[22:56] remembered no more of the anguish for
[22:58] joy that a man is Born Into the world
[23:01] braam talk about it in birth pains
[23:04] that's how the world is now so when any
[23:08] woman is given birth during the time of
[23:12] the labor the intensity increases with
[23:15] time the pain increases with time so
[23:19] before the child comes he going to go
[23:21] through from certain levels it's going
[23:24] to go Papa until the the child comes so
[23:27] is our world now the world has had this
[23:31] first world war second world war and
[23:34] that destraction is been rampant because
[23:37] the first world war was different kind
[23:38] of missiles um bombs and thing but
[23:42] second world war they went more higher
[23:44] with atomic bomb and he destroy
[23:46] heroshima in hagaki in Japan and the
[23:49] third world going to be worse and the
[23:52] Bible said that he going to what get W
[23:54] going to have
[23:56] farming and and
[23:59] earthquake in various places so this
[24:02] world is not going to get better if you
[24:06] looking for a better on this Earth no
[24:09] it's the new world to come because it's
[24:11] giving that pressure is giving way for a
[24:14] new world to come and that world is the
[24:17] Lord Jesus Christ coming only he can
[24:20] have peace the Prince of Peace that is
[24:22] all is botom up to is preparing for his
[24:26] second coming you know the first the
[24:29] second coming has come already in 1963
[24:31] when the SE were revealed but you
[24:34] looking for that time to what catch up
[24:36] the bright to meet us in the air and
[24:38] then we're coming back for three and a
[24:39] half years with those times after the
[24:41] tribulation time but what is happening
[24:47] that is
[24:48] that a lot of people has forgotten that
[24:52] scripture that said there's going to be
[24:54] fing there's going to be pestilence it's
[24:57] not going to to get better I believe
[25:00] that that's the reason why if you check
[25:04] after the co the co came all those Prime
[25:09] Ministers and the presidents in all the
[25:12] various countries majority of them when
[25:15] they went back to the second election
[25:17] most of them lost their seat why they
[25:20] lost the election because the people are
[25:22] thinking that it's getting worse so
[25:25] change of government will bring a better
[25:29] life for them that's what America they
[25:32] chose Trump for the second time because
[25:34] when he came for the first time they
[25:37] compared when he left and Biden came
[25:41] things are getting worse so they want to
[25:45] go back and have a better life but the
[25:48] Bible said he going to get works and
[25:51] work people had is not going to was also
[25:54] cold The Love Will was cold so it's is
[25:58] never going to get
[26:00] better and the pressure will keep on
[26:04] what mounting
[26:07] increasing and how we going to
[26:10] survive the Bible said let let your
[26:13] heart be trouble believe also in me if
[26:17] you believe in God so for the believer
[26:20] our faith our anchor is in the Lord
[26:23] Jesus Christ amen he we said that a
[26:26] th000 will fall on your left 10 will
[26:28] fall on the right it will not come near
[26:31] you only with your eyes will you see the
[26:34] what the reward of the wicked so you
[26:37] don't have to be worried about what is
[26:40] going on but it's never going to get
[26:45] better that one I can assure you that
[26:49] but it depends on where your confidence
[26:52] lies right whom are you
[26:56] trusting because a true bride of Christ
[27:00] your confidence is in the word of God
[27:03] your confidence is in God and we believe
[27:06] that he is the source of our supply and
[27:10] he supply all our needs amen so we are
[27:14] not looking at the economy because right
[27:17] now what are they doing with all this
[27:21] tariffs everything they doing is
[27:23] bringing the pressure economic pressure
[27:27] on the people people are losing their
[27:29] jobs in numbers they just started people
[27:32] are losing their jobs in numbers why
[27:36] it's a pressure on the people but he's
[27:40] everpresent help in times of trouble so
[27:44] all that we have to do is just rely on
[27:48] his word and that word of God will bring
[27:50] us through every condition no matter
[27:53] what how W it gets to the word of God
[27:57] will bring us out because our confidence
[28:00] is in that word and that word is greater
[28:03] than anything said the Heaven and Earth
[28:05] will pass away but God's word will not
[28:08] pass away all this birth place is going
[28:11] to let this Earth pass away but the word
[28:14] of God will still remain sure so our
[28:18] confidence is not in each other our
[28:21] confidence is in the word of the Living
[28:24] God he's the same yesterday today and
[28:27] for forever if he brought those Saints
[28:31] before us back when they were in trouble
[28:34] he going to bring us also back because
[28:37] it's the same God who was in Moses when
[28:41] he delivered the children of Israel from
[28:43] the hands of Egyptians when he came to a
[28:46] pharaoh who did not know Joseph and he
[28:50] was so mad and increased their labor and
[28:53] everything God raised up Moses and he
[28:56] delivered the children of Israel from
[28:58] the hand of that enemy and that same God
[29:01] is here with us doesn't matter how the
[29:04] pressure mou doesn't matter how wor it
[29:07] gets to that same God will deliver us
[29:10] and we are not going down we are going
[29:12] to be raptured to meet the Lord in the
[29:13] end amen that's our purpose that's the
[29:16] Fulfillment of the scripture for our day
[29:19] amen that one day we going to be
[29:22] raptured Hallelujah because we are not
[29:25] going to All Die amen we're going to be
[29:27] raptured me the Lord in the air amen
[29:30] he's the same yesterday today and
[29:33] forever amen so what has happening it's
[29:37] a pressure
[29:39] time it's a pressure time if you
[29:44] watch on the Friday 28th
[29:48] February that is when um 19
[29:52] 2025 those um alignment of those planets
[29:57] it aligned back back in 1963 and the
[30:00] same night that have that um ziny and
[30:04] Trump in the White House the big
[30:08] argument and Mr Trump is trying to be a
[30:12] peac man trying to have peace all over
[30:15] the world which he's trying his best to
[30:17] do to have peace that's what he is doing
[30:21] but there is never going to be a perfect
[30:24] peace until the Prince of Peace comes
[30:26] the Bible said when they said Peace PE
[30:28] then the sudden distraction will comes
[30:31] but if you watch zalinski stood on his
[30:35] ground that he will never sign for it
[30:40] unless they gave him security
[30:43] guaranteed and then after three couple
[30:46] of days they redrew all their help all
[30:50] their aid to Ukraine and this man had no
[30:54] choice than to sign the deal prepare to
[30:57] sign that deal
[30:59] um I'm not blaming the man though but
[31:01] I'm just saying that that's the way the
[31:03] enemy works we are going to face
[31:07] pressure upon pressure as time goes on
[31:10] so you have to be ready I have to be
[31:14] ready there's a part you and I have to
[31:18] do because it's going to be a time as
[31:23] our Prophet let us know they're going to
[31:25] put pressure on us
[31:28] either to give in to baptize the name of
[31:31] the father Son and Holy Ghost to take
[31:32] all their doctrines but we won't take it
[31:35] I'm going to read just one uh scripture
[31:39] here this thing here marriage of the
[31:42] lamb um paragraph
[31:45] 110 just to build up my point
[32:01] okay
[32:03] so what is it going to
[32:06] do is going to bring pressure so we have
[32:10] three pressures economic
[32:12] pressure religious pressure political
[32:16] pressure and religious pressure so all
[32:18] three will unite to be one and place on
[32:21] the people so when it comes to religious
[32:26] pressure because
[32:28] listen those churches he calls them that
[32:31] they have what Esau
[32:34] spirit and what did Esau
[32:37] did Esau sold his birth right when he
[32:42] has a famine when he was anger when he
[32:47] has no food to eat and that is what is
[32:51] even happening right now a lot of people
[32:55] because of pressure and because of fing
[32:58] because of financial difficulties they
[33:02] have chose to solve it by themselves by
[33:05] taking more hours at job taking two job
[33:08] taking three jobs thinking that they can
[33:10] solve it themselves but the Bible said
[33:13] that seek ye first the kingdom of God
[33:16] and his righteousness and all other
[33:19] things shall be added what unto you so
[33:22] as the time is getting worse and
[33:25] pressure is mounting the desire of of
[33:27] the believer is to be draw more closer
[33:30] to Jesus Christ is they seek the kingdom
[33:33] of God let that power of God um sanctify
[33:37] yourself rededicate yourself let God
[33:40] take control he will take care of you he
[33:43] will supply all your needs you don't
[33:46] have to compromise because of famine you
[33:50] don't have to compromise because of
[33:52] pressure stand on the word of God and
[33:55] God will stand by you because the
[33:57] children of Israel the three Hebrew
[33:59] children they stood by the word of God
[34:02] and in time of trouble when it seems all
[34:05] was lost God was there to deliver them
[34:08] and that same God is here tonight it
[34:11] doesn't matter what you go through
[34:13] doesn't matter what I go through we
[34:15] shouldn't bite down to the enemy because
[34:17] we going to go and face troubles it's a
[34:20] trouble time time I here it's pressure
[34:23] for you to give up it's pressure for you
[34:25] to give up on the word of God that is
[34:28] what is happening but a true child of
[34:31] God will stand by the word of God Amen
[34:33] zeli couldn't stand all the way amen but
[34:37] the bride of Christ will stand all the
[34:38] way like when I spoke about the last
[34:42] couple of weeks but um I've decided to
[34:45] follow Jesus Christ if you listen to
[34:48] that song before it came that person
[34:51] that man when the Indian guy when the
[34:54] missionary brought that word to them and
[34:57] he accepted it the chief told him to
[35:01] recount and he said you not recount if
[35:04] you do not recount I'm going to kill
[35:06] your wife he never gave up I'm going to
[35:10] kill your children he let them kill
[35:12] their children I'm going to kill you he
[35:14] said kill me and he was killed but the
[35:17] man realized that there's a power behind
[35:20] that man that could stand firm for the
[35:23] word of God and he became a Christian so
[35:26] when your trial came when your
[35:28] persecution came stand by the word of
[35:31] God and God will stand by you there's no
[35:34] one who has stand by the word of God
[35:36] that God never stood for him there are
[35:39] so many people that gave up their life
[35:41] for this gospel that we are enjoying
[35:44] amen but when they gave up their their
[35:46] life for this gospel they went to a
[35:48] better place because here is not our
[35:51] home you are here for tomorrow we
[35:53] comeone tomorrow even if nothing happens
[35:56] how long are you going to be here for
[35:57] for by 90 95 go you can't do anything
[36:01] you can't even enjoy your food even
[36:03] after 50 go you can't even e certain
[36:05] type of food so what are you here for
[36:09] what are your purpose on this Earth our
[36:12] main purpose is to Worship the Lord
[36:14] Jesus Christ our main purpose is to be
[36:17] there for one another our main purpose
[36:20] is to pray for one another our main
[36:22] purpose is to make ourself ready amen so
[36:26] that when God wants to use us we'll be
[36:29] ready for the battle that's our purpose
[36:32] on this Earth amen that's what I believe
[36:35] Esther did yes sir amen she was ready
[36:40] Hallelujah in marriage sa of the lamp
[36:45] Okay paragraph 17 said God calls you as
[36:50] an
[36:51] individual and it's you that got to
[36:55] clean up
[36:57] because he's taking a people from
[37:00] Gentiles for his name's sake his bride
[37:04] the Gentile Esther cleaned herself she
[37:08] cleaned her heart that's what she
[37:12] cleaned that's what the church needs a
[37:15] heart cleaning how do you clean your
[37:18] heart BR Abraham wash by the water of
[37:22] the word through the blood of Jesus
[37:25] Christ amen ES urge herself her heart
[37:29] before God walk up with a Meek and a
[37:32] humble Spirit the church is going to be
[37:36] the bride of Christ now remember Esther
[37:40] refused the worldly Ador she took the
[37:43] spirit in her heart to go before the
[37:48] king amen
[37:51] hallelujah amen so what am I trying to
[37:56] say if you have have that Spirit of
[37:58] Esther in you you what clean your heart
[38:02] you make your heart ready you're going
[38:04] to prepare yourself your heart you going
[38:06] to reconsecrate yourself so that when
[38:09] God is ready to use you he'll use you
[38:13] there's no competition we not comparing
[38:15] ourself one to the another all that you
[38:18] have to do to be ready to be ready to be
[38:21] used of God Amen and God is not going to
[38:24] use us at the same time so you have to I
[38:27] have to be ready and let his perfect
[38:30] will to be done our former pastor always
[38:32] says that in the Bible you can read
[38:34] about somebody only one
[38:36] time and that's all God wants to use
[38:39] that person for just one minute just one
[38:43] time for that purpose so you maybe all
[38:47] that even God called you to do is to
[38:49] just play the drums that's all your
[38:51] purpose so prepare your heart come and
[38:53] play the drums no competition amen just
[38:57] make your heart right if God wants to
[38:59] use you he use you but your heart has to
[39:02] be right you have to be at the right
[39:04] place at the right time and when he
[39:07] wants to use you to raise the debt he
[39:09] use you to raise the debt he wants you
[39:11] to give money to somebody who let you to
[39:13] do it he plac it in different places
[39:16] offices different H ranks and people to
[39:21] be the rich people so that they can what
[39:24] present the word of God to them people
[39:26] some people you make them lower to reach
[39:29] the poor he makes some people he he
[39:31] makes everything beautiful in his own
[39:33] time so all I'm trying to say that you
[39:36] recognize why you are here your purpose
[39:39] on this Earth and Lord work towards that
[39:42] and let God use you for his own Glory
[39:46] and Honor make yourself ready so that he
[39:50] can use you because if you are not ready
[39:53] when the time comes he'll baptize you
[39:54] and use the next person because that's
[39:56] why John the God is able to raise what
[39:59] souls to raise children for for Abraham
[40:03] so you we need God more than he needs us
[40:07] so we have to make ourselves ready
[40:10] because it's an opportunity he has given
[40:12] to us amen so don't think that if I'm
[40:15] not there nobody can do that job and
[40:18] don't get into your head that I'm the
[40:20] only person doing it and this will
[40:22] happen this no God is able to raise up
[40:26] people like to do that all that he wants
[40:29] a willing heart you have to have a
[40:32] willing heart to do it everything you
[40:34] have to have to do with with your all
[40:36] your heart all your mind all your soul
[40:39] the Bible say you shall love the Lord
[40:40] with all your mind all your soul
[40:42] everything within you that's what you
[40:44] have to love the Lord of God with amen
[40:47] so don't leave anything undone yes you
[40:50] have to have a willing heart and through
[40:53] that God will bless you abundantly
[40:56] because he said that so that your joy
[40:58] May what may become full he wants to
[41:01] bless us more abundantly he said I'll do
[41:04] exceedingly more than what you can even
[41:06] think of or even ask he's God of
[41:11] abundance some he said that a little
[41:14] fish say I'm going to drink all the
[41:16] waters the ocean how can you drink all
[41:17] the water the ocean you cannot overflow
[41:20] or you
[41:21] cannot overflow you cannot restrict God
[41:26] abundance he's a god of abundance ask
[41:29] abundance so that your joy may become
[41:32] full the same God that heals you from
[41:35] headache he's able to heal you from
[41:38] cancer he's able to heal you from any
[41:40] kind of disease if thou can believe all
[41:43] things are possible there's no there's
[41:46] no like big sin or Big H big sickness or
[41:50] big it's everything comes from sin is
[41:52] unbelief so it's all from the Devil is
[41:56] that right so there's no like this
[41:59] sickness is small this sickness is Big
[42:02] so I can trust God for healing for the
[42:04] small sickness I can't trust him for the
[42:06] big sickness the same faith that God
[42:10] gave you to overcome the small sickness
[42:13] that same faith will overcome the big
[42:15] sickness it will overcome everything
[42:18] amen believe God have confidence in his
[42:21] word amen with faith all things are
[42:25] possible all things amen amen He's Able
[42:28] tonight even to raise the dead amen
[42:31] whatever you going through tonight if
[42:32] thou can believe God will answer it it's
[42:35] according to your faith not mine your
[42:38] faith tonight your desires said you give
[42:41] you the desires of your heart tonight
[42:43] what are you Desiring tonight for what
[42:46] is it in your heart God is able to bring
[42:49] it to pass don't look at the
[42:51] circumstances don't look to those
[42:54] uncircumcised Philistines amen h
[42:57] Moses said that those Egyptians you see
[43:00] see them no more amen no more see them
[43:03] no more God is able to do it he's an
[43:07] awesome God he's on time God Amen he's
[43:11] still on time you'll be there right on
[43:13] time whatever you're going through
[43:15] tonight just believe it keep it in your
[43:18] heart and trust God thank you Lord and
[43:22] he'll give you the desires of your heart
[43:24] because he's the same yesterday today
[43:27] and forever if he did it back down for
[43:30] them if he here he would do it again
[43:33] because the same God who created the
[43:36] whole
[43:37] universe he came the fullness was in
[43:40] Christ reconcile the world to
[43:43] himself and we are part of that God you
[43:47] are not the fullness but we are part so
[43:50] if you are part that whatever you need
[43:53] he Grant it to you he said that act so
[43:55] that your joy
[43:57] may become fool a child who cries
[44:01] constantly they get what they want hey
[44:04] if you you newborn baby you put computer
[44:07] there or whatever Gadget and tell her
[44:09] tell that child that when you're hungry
[44:11] ring that Gadget he won't go to lose
[44:13] that the only way that the child knows
[44:15] what he can get
[44:17] is cry like a thing like that they said
[44:20] whatever you do you have to stop and
[44:22] take get get attention to that child so
[44:25] what you have to do is to cry onto the
[44:26] Lord
[44:28] because listen you cannot put your trust
[44:30] in any human being oh yeah they will
[44:32] fail you they will disappoint you no
[44:35] human being can help you but the Lord
[44:37] Jesus Christ can help you so we have to
[44:40] cry onto him because you care for us
[44:43] even in this part of the country like
[44:46] maybe in Africa sometimes they go and
[44:48] they cry to this person oh give me this
[44:51] borrow me this money borrow me that and
[44:53] they'll give food or but I know here
[44:56] people does that
[44:57] but don't get me wrong here is you have
[45:02] to trust
[45:04] God because sometimes even the people
[45:07] that you are trying to depend on
[45:09] naturally they want to help you but they
[45:12] might not be in the position at that
[45:14] time to help you so our confidence has
[45:17] to be on God all the time yes because he
[45:21] will never fail us nor forsake us he
[45:24] promised I'll be with you even in you
[45:28] until what the consumation of the time
[45:31] so God that created the whole universe
[45:35] he's in you tonight he's in me tonight
[45:38] people are trying to look back to the
[45:41] the the great the calvary for the cross
[45:44] Look to Him they remember that he has
[45:46] put on a skin and he's walking on the
[45:48] AIS sitting on the aisle with a bhead
[45:51] somewhere over there head bhead but that
[45:54] God is hiding in in him amen because
[45:57] he's the same yesterday today for he's
[45:59] hiding in the in the heart of the
[46:03] people you God disguise
[46:07] himself and reveal himself when he chose
[46:11] to and the whole plan of God all this is
[46:14] based on what
[46:16] revelation of the word of God so the
[46:19] more God reveals himself to you the more
[46:22] everything becomes easier so but it's by
[46:26] grace
[46:27] and grace and grace alone you cannot
[46:30] work yourself into Revelation but the
[46:33] bride of Christ is now resting all is
[46:37] well we have heard the message Shalom
[46:40] and all is well let's trust in him that
[46:45] all is well let's rest in the promise of
[46:48] god let's rest do not worry yourself God
[46:52] is in control amen he'll make all things
[46:56] is beautiful in his own time no matter
[47:02] what you are going through I Life is In
[47:05] His Hands Hallelujah we cannot even walk
[47:09] unless what he hold our hands you cannot
[47:12] do anything without him we ourselves we
[47:16] are nothing but he in US make the
[47:20] difference you are nobody but somebody
[47:24] has got inside of you to make you want
[47:27] somebody because he is in you he is
[47:31] greater than everything you going
[47:33] through greater is he that is in you
[47:37] than he that is in the world and that
[47:40] greater is the Lord and Savior Jesus
[47:43] Christ he's never lost a battle he's
[47:47] never lost a patient he's never lost a
[47:50] case am so why are we worried
[47:55] tonight don't worry worry everything
[47:58] going to be all right hallelujah praise
[48:02] our God our God is great amen
[48:08] hallelujah praise
[48:10] God so what I'm trying to say back to
[48:14] that religious
[48:16] pressure with Esau
[48:19] spirit so he said that in paragraph 190
[48:24] the S marriage of the uh lamp is going
[48:28] to produce still born baby when a baby
[48:32] is born the doctor has to give like that
[48:36] Spanky to what to cry and to revive and
[48:41] life comes into that baby but if you hit
[48:45] and he cann't cry it me that that baby
[48:47] is a stillborn baby so those P CA size
[48:51] those
[48:52] um people that system is producing what
[48:56] a still born baby an EC ecclesiastical
[49:01] system that is going to bring all the
[49:05] denomination together to produce an
[49:09] Esau that hates Jacob I mean I hope you
[49:15] see it a still born dead
[49:18] denomination all of them going together
[49:22] to what hate
[49:24] Jacob but the Bible say Jacob I have
[49:27] loved isau I
[49:29] hate and Jacob T the bride of Christ it
[49:33] was the works of Jacob between Jacob and
[49:38] Esau Esau was more gentleman than Jacob
[49:43] and he was doing all the work taking
[49:44] care of his father and everything and
[49:47] Jacob was a
[49:48] rascal but behind that Rascal was the
[49:52] seed of God so when he came to the best
[49:56] right
[49:57] he never played with it that birth right
[50:00] was everything to Jacob and that birth
[50:03] right is everything to a true sign of
[50:05] God it doesn't matter how the person has
[50:09] meded people still do every B thing on
[50:12] the earth when that word of God is
[50:15] presented to him a true genuine seed of
[50:19] God will grab it and accept it and move
[50:23] with it like the woman at the world
[50:27] all her outside was covered married
[50:30] divorc six times five times going to
[50:33] take somebody's wife but when her heart
[50:36] was revealed when she
[50:40] recognized the word for her
[50:42] day oh man she ran with the
[50:46] message she ran she took away all
[50:49] everything all her earings and
[50:51] everything and run with the message said
[50:53] come and he see a man have seen who have
[50:58] told me all by heart isn't the very
[51:01] Messiah and she
[51:03] witnessed and because of a testimony it
[51:07] brought a lot of people to the Lord
[51:10] Jesus Christ so our testimony is what
[51:13] has to bring people to Christ because
[51:16] the same Holy Ghost you were dead in sin
[51:19] and trespasses doing all kind of stuff
[51:22] kofu was saiding I used to go to Every
[51:24] Club in Toronto here he goes over there
[51:26] but when the spirit of God grabb his
[51:29] heart he won't go back to those things
[51:31] anymore no I've have decided to follow
[51:34] Jesus no going back to the world no
[51:36] turning back all those things are back
[51:39] those are the old philli old Kofi old
[51:43] Des past D those in our old self you
[51:46] don't even it's not even come into our
[51:48] mind anymore because God has delivered
[51:51] from all those things we are New
[51:53] Creation in Christ Jesus amen moving
[51:57] forward and and and going forward with
[51:59] the word of God we are going forward

[52:05] our life is in Christ amen and the true
[52:09] Son of God or daughter of God does not
[52:12] depend on yesterday's

[52:20] for yesterday tourist experience is good

[52:37] from God yesterday experience is good
[52:40] but you want a present day experience
[52:43] present tense he's a present tense God a
[52:46] lot of people are driving in a red
[52:49] mirror always looking back always
[52:51] looking back the only time we go to the
[52:53] back is to draw experience for what has
[52:56] done for us to move us forward to
[52:59] believe and have confidence that the
[53:02] same God that delivered us back from
[53:04] that back then is able to do it again
[53:07] and again and again and again so we are
[53:10] not focusing on the past we are focusing
[53:13] on the present we are focus on what God
[53:16] is doing now fulfillment of that word in
[53:20] our life now amen yesterday was good but

[55:18] child your son everyone is sick take
[55:20] that sword pray for the person you face
[55:23] any situation take that sword and move
[55:26] for forward I mean one the greatest
[55:30] weapon that Christians have is
[55:34] prayer yes sir but sometimes we neglect
[55:38] it when you get in trouble you try to
[55:41] solve it ourselves but when he get in
[55:44] any trouble any problem our first thing
[55:47] is prayer because that's a weapon that
[55:51] God has given to us amen and that weapon
[55:54] Will Conquer everything
[55:56] one time even prayer change the mind of
[55:58] Christ of God so said that if prayer
[56:02] will bring God down why don't you pray
[56:05] and pray and pray amen prayer will bring
[56:08] God anointing that prayer will change
[56:10] situation prayer will do so many things
[56:13] to you that's our our spiritual warfare
[56:17] When you pray and make yourself ready
[56:21] then God can use you for his glory and
[56:23] honor it's so simple because he wants to
[56:27] use us more than what we want to that's
[56:32] why Des talk
[56:34] about aen Allan when he went to bra
[56:38] Braham he said BR Braham can God use me
[56:42] he said God can use
[56:44] anybody God is willing to use
[56:47] anybody but we have to be ready we have
[56:51] to be ready the only thing is we don't
[56:54] have to compete
[56:57] or how God used brother Billy might not
[57:01] be the way he going to use me so you
[57:04] don't have to worry about how God is
[57:06] using Billy that's right which area how
[57:09] God wants to use me that's what I want
[57:12] to know that's what I have to know
[57:15] that's what I have to be ready for
[57:17] Hallelujah so when the time comes he
[57:19] will come and grab me and use me to do
[57:22] that provided I'm ready provided my
[57:25] heart is Cle
[57:26] my listen don't let the enemy tells you
[57:32] anything all that God is looking for is
[57:35] the desires in your
[57:37] heart and once you
[57:40] desire to please God to be used of God
[57:45] any negative thing that comes to your
[57:46] mind reject it is not part of you am God
[57:51] is looking at your desire am your desire
[57:55] is to please God
[57:56] your desire to do his will that's what
[58:00] he's looking at he's not looking at your
[58:02] mistakes he's not looking at your faults
[58:05] because he knows we are human because we
[58:08] have this we make a lot of mistakes he's
[58:12] not looking at that no sir he's looking
