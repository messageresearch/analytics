[29:14] morning you may be seated just for a
[29:16] moment
[29:19] amen we want to give the Lord praise and
[29:22] glory it all started uh about a week ago
[29:27] last Friday when when um we were having
[29:29] our prayer meeting and brother
[29:31] Christopher and sister farita had
[29:33] brought up a request that brother
[29:35] Christopher was not feeling well um they
[29:38] both were kind of under the weather but
[29:40] uh you know brother Christopher's blood
[29:42] pressure had spiked all of a sudden out
[29:45] of nowhere and so the request came and
[29:48] we started to pray and we believe the
[29:50] Lord and then as the week progressed
[29:52] well things
[29:55] uh developed into an attack on our
[29:58] precious brother amen uh he wasn't
[30:01] feeling well uh Thursday he decided that
[30:05] or actually on Wednesday he decided that
[30:07] he would go to the hospital so they went
[30:09] to the hospital they checked in they
[30:11] started doing tests for some reason his
[30:14] blood pressure was not coming down and
[30:17] um uh they said well we're going to have
[30:20] to keep you uh they kept doing blood
[30:22] tests and checking they couldn't find
[30:24] anything uh finally at around 2: a.m. on
[30:27] Thursday morning uh brother Chris you
[30:31] know sister farita just left at about
[30:33] midnight and around 2: a.m. brother
[30:36] Christopher started to really feel
[30:38] terrible started to sweat immediately
[30:41] called the nurse and that's the last
[30:43] thing he remembers he went into a
[30:45] cardiac arrest and his heart stopped and
[30:48] luckily by the grace of God we know that
[30:51] it's God that led them to go to the
[30:54] hospital he was at the right place at
[30:56] the right time and divine intervention
[30:59] the doctors the Lord could use them
[31:00] right away to bring him back and to um
[31:04] stabilize him and bring him right back
[31:06] again I received the call it was around
[31:08] 2:30 in the morning I told sister farita
[31:12] after we prayed I said I'm on my way and
[31:15] uh you know I said Lord what's going on
[31:19] you know what I mean and and it just
[31:20] like you know it's it's a times like
[31:22] that where you
[31:24] really you you you focus into that
[31:28] relationship with the Lord you know and
[31:30] as I'm driving to the hospital you know
[31:33] I I said well I just hit my
[31:36] uh radio to put on some music and the
[31:39] songs I was listening to some uh gospel
[31:43] songs from the tidwells all week and it
[31:46] was one song After the other that the
[31:49] Lord was just showing me all is well
[31:53] there's nothing that that you know and
[31:56] all I could see was brother Christopher
[31:57] at the the hospital in the hospital bed
[32:00] and he was fine and that's what I was
[32:02] seeing while I was driving to the
[32:04] hospital and so when I got to the
[32:05] hospital I walked into the room there he
[32:08] was he looked over and he looked he I
[32:10] said praise God brother Chris I said how
[32:13] you feeling he says I'm feeling fine I
[32:17] said glory to God I said you look good
[32:20] you know he looked he looked like he
[32:22] didn't look like he'd just come out of a
[32:24] war for his life that's for sure and we
[32:27] know that that was the supernatural move
[32:29] in hand of God Amen praise God and so um
[32:33] you know from there you know he got
[32:35] transfer the next day they did an
[32:37] angiogram they checked his heart all
[32:39] they found was a one artery was a little
[32:41] bit plugged okay but that was not the
[32:44] cause of the cardiac arrest the doctor
[32:47] said clearly this was caused by improper
[32:52] medication the medication that he had
[32:55] received was not the proper medication
[32:58] and it and it didn't respond well with
[33:00] his body and it and it was just an
[33:02] attack of the enemy but God is always
[33:05] one step ahead amen amen praise God and
[33:08] so we want to give God the glory this
[33:10] morning that brother
[33:14] Christopher is now

[38:12] is just going to take us into another
[38:14] area um along the same lines that we've
[38:17] been uh but we want to talk about the
[38:19] Word of Promise amen and we want to uh
[38:24] allow the Holy Spirit to speak to our
[38:27] hearts
[38:28] and give us the strength that we need
[38:30] amen you
[38:32] are ye are our epistle written in our
[38:36] hearts known and read of all men for as
[38:40] much as ye are manifestly declared to be
[38:43] the Epistle of Christ ministered by US
[38:46] Written not with ink but with the spirit
[38:50] of the Living
[38:51] God not in tables of stone but in
[38:55] fleshly tables
[38:58] of the heart amen you may be seated
[39:01] praise
[39:02] God you know Paul was excited that um
[39:05] you know that that he as a minister
[39:08] would be ministering the word of God and
[39:10] that he knew that the that the word was
[39:12] having an effect on the people and the
[39:15] Lord knows that um you know he has uh
[39:18] designed it by the by the uh Ministry of
[39:22] preaching the word that we would receive
[39:24] what we have need of amen and word of
[39:27] God in this hour is uh is is so powerful
[39:32] it is much more than what the world you
[39:34] know the Christian Church world and the
[39:36] denominational teachings are making the
[39:39] word of God the word of God is the power
[39:42] of God it is the transforming power of
[39:46] God it's not something that just changes
[39:49] the flesh but it goes to the innermost
[39:52] part uh of the heart of the being of the
[39:56] Soul so that you are transformed and so
[40:00] that you actually become written
[40:02] Epistles the word of God in this day in
[40:05] this hour is not going to just set
[40:09] people free from sin and unbelief and
[40:14] from uh you know sickness those are
[40:17] those are just um aspects of the
[40:20] benefits of the word of God but the word
[40:23] of God for this hour is going to be
[40:25] written into the heart
[40:28] of the Sons and Daughters of God that it
[40:30] will bring forth the literal body of
[40:34] Jesus
[40:35] Christ it will bring forth the True
[40:39] Church the true church that was that was
[40:43] um the church that is of the word amen
[40:47] that is going to produce Jesus Christ
[40:50] once again in these last days because
[40:53] the church is out there they're
[40:55] gathering together they're preaching
[40:57] doctrines but most of them are doctrines
[41:00] of man we're not interested in the
[41:02] doctrines of man we are interested in
[41:05] the word that changes transforms and is
[41:09] going to produce the Rapture the body
[41:12] change the supernatural perfect faith
[41:15] that is going to translate us out of
[41:17] this Dimension that is now going into
[41:20] total chaos amen we are in a world we
[41:24] are in the last days we are in the time
[41:27] when everything goes into total chaos
[41:30] but God said he's going to have a bride
[41:32] he's going to have a church his Plan of
[41:35] Redemption will be fulfilled and there
[41:37] will be a people that will be able to
[41:40] receive that word and bring that word
[41:43] into full
[41:44] manifestation right before the very eyes
[41:47] of the world Amen praise God and so as
[41:51] we look into this we want to go to our
[41:53] next
[41:54] scripture in Romans chapter 9
[41:59] 9 we read from this scripture last week
[42:01] and we just want to we want to draw from
[42:04] it you know as as you know as I was
[42:06] studying all of this this week it just
[42:08] the word just keeps breaking open and
[42:12] everything starts to tie in everything
[42:14] starts to come together from Genesis all
[42:17] the way to revelation we start to see
[42:20] how these two Spirits have been
[42:22] operating right from the very beginning
[42:24] amen and how the the enemy is to you
[42:28] know Satan wants to have his bride he
[42:30] wants to have his people but his bride
[42:33] is going to be an intellectual bride
[42:35] it's going to be a bride that's going to
[42:37] be based on works it's going to be one
[42:39] that's going to be based on law uh you
[42:41] know because listen let's look at the
[42:43] scripture we're going to expound more as
[42:45] we go not as though the word of God hath
[42:48] taken none effect for they are not
[42:51] Israel which are
[42:53] Israel neither because they are the Seed
[42:56] of Abraham
[42:57] are they all children but in Isaac shall
[43:02] thy
[43:05] seed singular be called that is they
[43:10] which are the children of the flesh
[43:13] these are not the children of
[43:16] God but the children of the promise are
[43:20] counted for the
[43:23] seed plural uh singular not plural
[43:27] singular for This Is The Word of
[43:30] Promise at this time will I come and
[43:34] Sarah shall have a
[43:38] son
[43:41] amen next slide here brother Bram
[43:44] speaking now I took I took a lot of this
[43:46] context and everything we're going to be
[43:47] speaking on this morning from this
[43:49] message the seed shall not be air with
[43:52] the shuck it's about a 60-minute sermon
[43:55] if you get a chance this week
[43:57] go back and listen to it after today
[44:02] it's going to it's going to really break
[44:04] open even more and it's going to become
[44:07] even more glorious to your soul amen
[44:10] praise God now here he says here the
[44:13] seed starts in the promise and we're
[44:16] talking about the the the Word of
[44:21] Promise the seed starts in the promise
[44:24] and Abraham here slightly doubted by Ish
[44:29] now he's not talking about that Abraham
[44:31] doubted but it was Sarah that actually
[44:33] doubted and Abraham listened to his wife
[44:38] and
[44:39] participated and I want to show you the
[44:42] three stages of these of this seed and
[44:46] that we're going to speak of which is
[44:48] not air with the Shu three
[44:52] stages so it's not just uh now it it's
[44:56] not just going to be be Cain and Abel
[44:58] it's not just Jacob and Esau it's not
[45:01] just Isaac and Ishmael but there's
[45:03] actually three stages here okay that we
[45:06] are going to be looking at but these two
[45:09] Spirits operating within these three
[45:12] stages now we find that in the beginning
[45:15] here that God gave Abraham the promise
[45:19] he gave adam the promise first and that
[45:23] was or the Covenant was on condition
[45:27] so when Adam received the Covenant the
[45:31] promise it was based on if Thou shalt do
[45:35] this then
[45:37] this will not happen in other words you
[45:40] can eat of all the trees that are in the
[45:42] garden but the day that you eat thereof
[45:46] you shall surely
[45:48] die so there was a promise of eternal
[45:51] life but the moment that any unbelief
[45:53] would come in death would come in
[45:58] and so he says if you will do this but
[46:01] when he gave it to Abraham it was
[46:05] unconditional thank you Jesus it was a a
[46:08] promised word that was totally
[46:12] unconditional to his
[46:14] seed amen amen I have already done it he
[46:20] never what he did it was unconditional
[46:23] he gave to Abraham now and through that
[46:27] Abraham having the promise therefore we
[46:31] have to be Abraham's
[46:33] seed it was not only to Abraham but to
[46:37] his seed after him now if you'll notice
[46:41] it wasn't seeds after him but seed after
[46:46] him amen praise God forever more and
[46:51] so now we want to look at our next
[46:55] scripture in Galatians 3:
[47:00] 18-31 now to Abraham and his seed were
[47:04] the promises
[47:05] made he saith not and to seeds as of
[47:09] many but as of one and to thy seed which
[47:14] is
[47:16] Christ so the whole promise was based on
[47:20] a
[47:21] promise of the coming of Christ that
[47:26] that was the promised seed that was the
[47:29] one that would inherit the kingdom of
[47:32] God that was the one that he was talking
[47:35] to and so he says and this I say that
[47:37] the Covenant that was confirmed before
[47:40] of God in Christ the law which was 430
[47:45] years after cannot disol that it should
[47:49] make the promise of none effect so in
[47:52] other words we're not going to be
[47:54] looking that that anything Chang changed
[47:57] even though the children of Israel went
[47:59] into bondage for 430 years and all the
[48:03] things that that took place with Jacob
[48:06] and Esau and all the way down through
[48:09] all the unbelief all that the enemy did
[48:13] that he tried to deceive the Sons and
[48:15] Daughters of God and constantly bringing
[48:18] them into bondage and bringing them into
[48:20] sin they went into the Wilderness for 40
[48:23] years they fell in the wilderness in in
[48:27] the in the in the valley of sin they
[48:30] they fell in unbelief amen praise God
[48:34] that promise was not based on on human
[48:38] uh
[48:39] uh completion it wasn't based on on all
[48:43] the things that we see back through the
[48:45] scriptures where man
[48:48] fell amen for if the inheritance can be
[48:52] of the law it is no more a promise
[48:57] so it wasn't based on the children of it
[48:59] listen the law was brought for the
[49:01] purpose of bringing man
[49:05] under obedience to
[49:09] God they they they they went wild
[49:13] because the lineage of Cain was a wild
[49:16] lineage it was a beastly nature it had
[49:19] no desire to serve God and the moment
[49:22] that it was mixing with the the Sons and
[49:24] Daughters of God unbelief was would set
[49:27] in and and that's why God had to bring
[49:30] the law in order to bring control over
[49:33] the beastly nature of the of the of the
[49:36] people because all were born in sin all
[49:40] came under the curse of the original sin
[49:43] and so that's why in you and me in in
[49:46] this condition in a human uh uh body we
[49:50] are going to have to struggle with that
[49:52] Jacob and Esau's spirit that Ishmael and
[49:55] Isaac's spirit that is constantly trying
[49:58] to pull us away from the word of God
[50:01] Amen but God has a promised word in this
[50:04] hour that he is going to have a bride
[50:07] without spot or
[50:09] wrinkle she will
[50:11] overcome the bonds woman amen let's
[50:13] let's let's move on for if the
[50:15] inheritance be of the law it is of no no
[50:18] more a promise but God gave it to
[50:20] Abraham by promise wherefore then
[50:24] serveth the law
[50:27] you know this is uh Paul speaking to the
[50:29] Galatians because there was a struggle
[50:32] between law and Grace and that struggle
[50:35] is going to be in you until you leave
[50:37] this place you're going to have to
[50:39] overcome that struggle that is within
[50:42] your nature that nature that that was
[50:45] injected into you because of the
[50:47] original sin and that's why a new birth
[50:49] is required it was added because of
[50:54] transgression that's why the law was
[50:56] added because of
[51:00] unbelief till the seed should come to
[51:04] whom the promise was
[51:07] made did you hear that y
[51:11] until the seed should
[51:15] come to whom the promise was made and it
[51:19] was ordained by the angels in the hand
[51:22] of a mediator now a mediator is not a
[51:25] mediator of one
[51:27] but God is one and so here now what he
[51:30] was saying here was like Moses Moses was
[51:33] the mediator at the time God gave him
[51:36] the law and God would bring them the law
[51:39] Thou shalt not do this Thou shalt not do
[51:41] that thou shalt not do this and so the
[51:44] law and Moses became the mediator for
[51:47] the
[51:48] people because they would have to
[51:51] because of their their their unbelief
[51:53] and their sin they would have to make an
[51:55] offering unto the Lord Lord that's why
[51:58] when when when they sinned back in the
[52:00] Old Testament they knew that they had
[52:02] sinned they would have to take a lamb a
[52:04] goat something that they would have to
[52:07] uh uh offer it on the Altar and the life
[52:10] of the Innocence of the animal would
[52:13] cover the the the sin and the unbelief
[52:16] that was in the
[52:20] individual but then there was a seed
[52:23] that would receive promise that it would
[52:25] not re require the blood of bulls and
[52:30] goats and that's why the promised seed
[52:33] was Christ and that's why without Christ
[52:37] I don't care what the world wants to uh
[52:40] do about the end time and what is going
[52:43] to happen to the earth and the Great
[52:45] Tribulation that's coming and how the
[52:47] Earth is you know they they talk about
[52:49] uh you know that it's going to be a a a
[52:51] weather event it's going to be
[52:53] earthquakes it's going to be that the
[52:55] Earth is going to no they need to know
[52:57] that it's all based on the prophecy of
[52:59] God's word and that there's only one way
[53:03] to Salvation and that is through Jesus
[53:06] Christ everything in the Old Testament
[53:09] was talking about Jesus Christ the
[53:12] Messiah that would come to take away the
[53:15] sins of the world the reason why they
[53:17] had to use the the the blood of of bulls
[53:21] and and goats and and and sheep on the
[53:23] altar was because the the of the
[53:26] original
[53:27] sin being a blood
[53:29] sin amen but Jesus Christ would reverse
[53:35] that curse by his blood not by human
[53:39] blood but the by the blood of God and
[53:42] that's why without the blood of Jesus
[53:45] Christ without Calvary there is no
[53:49] salvation amen all that were under the
[53:52] Old Testament all that were under the of
[53:55] the law of the Old Testament
[53:57] they had to use a a a blood sacrifice to
[54:00] cover their sin but when Christ the
[54:02] Messiah came he abolished all of
[54:07] that amen and he went directly to The
[54:10] Mercy Seat like we were talking about on
[54:12] Wednesday night and he's he was on The
[54:15] Mercy Seat making intercession now for
[54:19] the Gentile seven Church ages
[54:23] amen amen praise God all those that were
[54:27] under the blood all those that were that
[54:30] were that were using blood sacrifice in
[54:32] the Old Testament when Christ came he
[54:35] abolished the need for the blood of
[54:38] bulls and goats and those people don't
[54:41] need intercession anymore because he
[54:45] made the ultimate sacrifice and they're
[54:48] already dead they don't need
[54:50] intercession but through the seven
[54:52] Church ages there was intercession
[54:54] required until the coming of the Lord
[54:58] the second coming of the Lord which took
[55:00] place in
[55:01] 1963 and that's why in
[55:04] 1963 he could leave The Mercy Seat he
[55:08] could leave because he he was the lamb
[55:10] that took the book amen praise God he
[55:12] was the one that took the the the book
[55:14] of redemption he was Seated on the
[55:16] throne making intercession for all those
[55:18] seven Church ages right up until
[55:21] Pentecost amen but right when Pentecost
[55:25] and and God sent the seventh angel
[55:27] messenger and that messenger under the
[55:30] anointing of the spirit of God was given
[55:33] the commission to go back to
[55:35] Jeffersonville that the Seven Seals were
[55:37] going to be opened and the Mystery of
[55:40] God was going to be revealed that was
[55:42] the second coming of the Lord Jesus
[55:45] Christ and people that don't recognize
[55:48] that coming to this day are going to
[55:50] miss everything and everything that
[55:52] they're doing all the teachings that
[55:54] they're giving in the churches they can
[55:57] try to figure out the Book of Revelation
[55:59] they'll never do it because it's only by
[56:02] faith it has to be revealed by faith
[56:06] amen praise God you got to know how to
[56:08] approach God you've got to be ordained
[56:11] of God from before the foundations of
[56:13] the world to be able to receive the pure
[56:16] unadulterated word of God for this day
[56:18] and this hour which gives you the birth
[56:21] amen the only way you can get the birth
[56:24] in order to to be a trans ated in the
[56:27] Rapture is to receive the word for this
[56:30] day and the word for this day is Christ
[56:34] hallelujah praise God forever more amen
[56:38] so the
[56:39] mediator up until right up
[56:43] until the seventh age God had men that
[56:47] he would have to anoint with the word of
[56:50] God for that particular day and that's
[56:52] why when you go back and you study the
[56:54] seven Church ages you you'll see that
[56:56] there was seven
[56:58] Messengers that God had to anoint in
[57:01] order to break them from their
[57:03] Traditions to to to escape the the the
[57:07] the the seed of the serpent the the the
[57:11] the the the the seed the the the mark of
[57:13] the beast because the mark of the beast
[57:16] was actually to to get the people to
[57:19] disbelieve
[57:20] Christ that's what the mark of the beast
[57:22] is that's why in ad 325 when when they
[57:26] had the the the nian council meeting
[57:30] what what what did the Catholic church
[57:31] do they injected their own
[57:34] interpretation on the word and they
[57:36] started to take away the deity of God
[57:40] the moment you pull the deity of God out
[57:43] of the
[57:44] scriptures you don't know who you're
[57:46] serving you know not who God is you
[57:48] don't know who you're going to where
[57:51] where you're going to receive your F
[57:52] your your salvation from is it going to
[57:54] come from God the Father is it going to
[57:56] come from the son or is it going to come
[57:59] from the Holy Ghost which
[58:02] one you see if you don't know the very
[58:05] foundations of the word of God that God
[58:08] is one you're lost right from that point
[58:12] on Hallelujah so every mediator that God
[58:18] sent through these Messengers amen they
[58:21] could only receive a portion of the word
[58:26] not the fullness of the word because God
[58:29] was in a state of reformation God was
[58:32] restoring the word that's why if the
[58:34] corn of wheat didn't die there would be
[58:37] no Resurrection there would be no Holy
[58:40] Ghost remember God Jesus Christ was not
[58:45] the son of
[58:46] Joseph and
[58:48] Mary no sir we're going to be looking at
[58:52] that this is the this is the the the the
[58:54] whole element that that we want to bring
[58:56] forth
[58:57] here Jesus Christ was the blood of God
[59:01] he was seed male female both both seed
[59:08] and egg came together and it was God and
[59:13] it was placed in the womb of Mary amen
[59:16] praise God and she had the right kind of
[59:19] Faith glory to God Amen and so there was
[59:23] there there wasn't a perfect word
[59:26] restored yet and that's why this battle
[59:31] that's still going on between these two
[59:34] Spirits
[59:36] amen they still go on to this
[59:39] day it's a fight it's a constant fight
[59:42] the battle is within
[59:44] you and sometimes right within your own
[59:47] church because that's where the enemy is
[59:50] going to deceive how could it be so
[59:52] deceiving that it would be uh that it
[59:54] would deceive the very elect if if it
[59:56] were possible it's going to have to look
[59:58] just like the real thing yes amen praise
[1:00:01] God hallelujah and so Christ knowing
[1:00:05] that that that each messenger would only
[1:00:09] have a portion he knew that the people
[1:00:11] through those ages would still continue
[1:00:14] in sin like Luther he broke away from
[1:00:16] the Catholic Church by justification but
[1:00:19] yet he was still smoking he was still
[1:00:21] drinking there was no there was no uh
[1:00:23] you know sanctification so the Christ
[1:00:27] was Seated on The Mercy Seat making
[1:00:29] intercession for our our ignorant sin
[1:00:33] sins of ignorance like we said on
[1:00:35] Wednesday that back in the Old Testament
[1:00:37] the The Book of Numbers a high priest
[1:00:39] would go Before the Throne make a
[1:00:42] sacrifice for the ignorance of the
[1:00:44] people for the sins of ignorance that
[1:00:46] they didn't know what they that they
[1:00:47] were sinning and that's what was going
[1:00:50] on all the way through those seven
[1:00:52] Church ages but then when Christ who
[1:00:56] took the
[1:00:57] book and and left the throne in
[1:01:02] 1963 because in Revelations 10: 1-7 it
[1:01:05] said that a mighty angel came down put
[1:01:09] one foot on the sea and one foot on the
[1:01:11] land and he had in his right hand a book
[1:01:14] that was open amen he had left the
[1:01:17] throne because if you look at the
[1:01:19] seventh seal all it says there there was
[1:01:21] a half hour of Silence amen because now
[1:01:25] he was coming down to to to put it all
[1:01:28] together Amen to bring forth the
[1:01:31] fullness of the word to unite with a
[1:01:34] perfect virgin born church that would
[1:01:37] not be be uh uh injected with man's
[1:01:41] interpretation she would not receive
[1:01:43] man's doctrines amen praise God he was
[1:01:47] now coming down to unite with that
[1:01:50] church for his Redemption time had come
[1:01:54] amen and that's the hour that we're in
[1:01:57] we're in the hour of complete and total
[1:02:00] Redemption of the Sons and Daughters of
[1:02:03] God being restored right back to the way
[1:02:05] we should have been before the
[1:02:09] fall amen praise God listen here so
[1:02:14] Christ
[1:02:15] now the atonement and this is important
[1:02:19] you need to see this the atonement now
[1:02:23] that's why all the churches out there
[1:02:25] until they come to
[1:02:27] realize because they're still waiting on
[1:02:29] the coming of the lord they're still
[1:02:32] waiting for him to come into the clouds
[1:02:34] and they're going to see him and they
[1:02:35] figure that their bodies are going to
[1:02:37] rise up to meet him in the air in his
[1:02:39] coming he's already
[1:02:41] come and the reason why he came was so
[1:02:45] that now he could possess a bride amen
[1:02:49] possess a church and that church now
[1:02:52] becomes his
[1:02:54] voice becomes his feet his arms his his
[1:02:59] his mercy
[1:03:01] seat so if people want to know now that
[1:03:04] you know you talk to people and they're
[1:03:05] they're talking about Christianity they
[1:03:08] they believe in Christianity they want
[1:03:10] to know about the Lord but they don't
[1:03:11] realize that he's left The Mercy Seat
[1:03:14] he's no longer making intercession for
[1:03:16] the denomination he's making
[1:03:18] intercession now for that last one he's
[1:03:22] looking for that last one and the only
[1:03:25] place where intercession and atonement
[1:03:27] can now be found is in the true church
[1:03:30] for the word of God for this hour
[1:03:33] Hallelujah she's Anointed with the word
[1:03:37] she realizes who she is she's come into
[1:03:40] a place of of deity she realizes now
[1:03:44] that that there's only one way that that
[1:03:46] that salvation can be found and that is
[1:03:49] not by by joining a church it's by
[1:03:53] receiving the Holy Ghost the word of God
[1:03:55] for your day in this hour amen we're not
[1:03:58] talking about baptism of Holy Ghost the
[1:04:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost it'll do
[1:04:02] things for you oh yeah it'll set you
[1:04:05] free in areas it'll heal you but baptism
[1:04:08] is not enough amen baptism was only to
[1:04:11] bring this this sinful nature Under The
[1:04:15] Obedience of God's word so that it could
[1:04:17] draw your attention he said I will send
[1:04:20] you the comforter who which is the Holy
[1:04:23] Ghost and he will do what guide you back
[1:04:26] to
[1:04:27] truth because it's the truth that's
[1:04:30] going to give you a body change it's not
[1:04:32] going to be some teaching of man it's
[1:04:35] going to be the ultimate word the truth
[1:04:37] the the the the absolute Supernatural
[1:04:40] transforming power if this spirit that
[1:04:44] raised Christ from the dead dwells in
[1:04:46] you it'll Quicken you it'll translate
[1:04:50] you out of your unbelief we're not
[1:04:52] looking for baptisms of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:54] anymore did that under Pentecost but the
[1:04:57] Holy Ghost the baptisms of the Holy
[1:05:00] Ghost were for one purpose so that the
[1:05:03] baptism could introduce you to The Giver
[1:05:07] Hallelujah glory to God The Giver of the
[1:05:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost it's got to
[1:05:12] bring you into that contact that Unity
[1:05:15] that invisible Union of the Bride of
[1:05:18] Jesus Christ amen so he goes on to say
[1:05:22] here in our in our uh next quote he says
[1:05:25] that's what the church is doing today
[1:05:27] for Jesus is the word and he is the
[1:05:31] bridegroom now pay attention and the
[1:05:34] bride is part of the
[1:05:37] groom so therefore the word that is to
[1:05:42] be fulfilled this
[1:05:44] day is the same part of the word that
[1:05:49] was fulfilled in his day
[1:05:52] am Adam and
[1:05:54] Eve you see word upon word amen glory to
[1:05:58] God now pay attention he says here same
[1:06:03] word same experience same life for when
[1:06:08] God separated Adam he was both we find
[1:06:11] out Adam was Spirit to begin with he
[1:06:15] made man in his own image created he
[1:06:18] male and female and then in Genesis
[1:06:21] chter 2 and on he created man out of the
[1:06:25] dust of the earth Man was created in
[1:06:29] God's image God is a
[1:06:32] spirit so when Adam was in the in the
[1:06:35] image of God before God took of the Dust
[1:06:39] of the earth he was male and female it
[1:06:42] was Adam and Eve he called their name
[1:06:46] Adam they had supreme authority and it
[1:06:49] was God Amen it was God expressed in
[1:06:53] human flesh amen out of the D
[1:06:56] so he's a spirit man then when he become
[1:06:58] flesh man animal Flesh on the earth he
[1:07:02] is he is showing portraying here the
[1:07:06] bride oh my it was not until after the
[1:07:11] dust of the earth that he created
[1:07:14] himself a body that the woman Eve
[1:07:16] actually comes on the scene the bride
[1:07:19] the female aspect of
[1:07:22] himself it's it's himself amen and that
[1:07:26] was that's portraying here the bride he
[1:07:28] never taken and made another being but
[1:07:30] he took part of Adam the original
[1:07:34] creation took from him a rib from his
[1:07:36] side and took what the feminist Spirit
[1:07:39] out of Adam left the masculine spirit in
[1:07:43] there and placed it in the feminis part
[1:07:48] therefore part of his Spirit part of his
[1:07:51] body flesh of his flesh bone of his bone
[1:07:55] word of his word life of his life and
[1:07:58] that's the way the bride is to
[1:08:01] Christ thank you Jesus do you see
[1:08:05] it so this is not just joining
[1:08:09] church this is not just being you know
[1:08:12] able to keep all the scripture all the
[1:08:15] listen I'll tell you there's people out
[1:08:17] there in the in the denominational
[1:08:20] churches that can live holier than you
[1:08:25] they can keep the law much better than
[1:08:29] you because they figure that their
[1:08:32] salvation is based on the law like the
[1:08:34] seven-day Adventist you talk to them
[1:08:36] they tell you oh you don't keep the
[1:08:37] Sabbath you're going to
[1:08:39] hell you're not you're you're you broke
[1:08:42] the law of the Commandment that thou
[1:08:44] shalt not do anything on the Sabbath day
[1:08:47] and that's why to this day they still
[1:08:49] believe that that that by keeping the
[1:08:51] Sabbath they're entitled to Salvation
[1:08:54] when Jesus Christ Christ himself rebuked
[1:08:56] them and said I am the Sabbath I'm the
[1:09:00] reason why there is a Sabbath I'm the
[1:09:03] purpose of the Sabbath glory to God Amen
[1:09:07] praise God and so here now we come to
[1:09:11] realize that that they don't understand
[1:09:15] that the word has been fulfilled in our
[1:09:18] day by the opening of The Seven Seals
[1:09:22] and the importance of that and that's
[1:09:25] really that's the message that that of
[1:09:28] the hour for us me as a minister you
[1:09:31] know I I go to studying and I I say Lord
[1:09:34] you know there there could still be one
[1:09:37] or two or we don't know how many you've
[1:09:39] got your you said all that the father
[1:09:41] hath given me will come we don't know
[1:09:44] where they are there still could be some
[1:09:46] that are still you know uh you know
[1:09:48] under some denominational teaching so
[1:09:51] when we bring the word of God we've got
[1:09:53] to bring it in such a way that there
[1:09:55] there's some Simplicity because really
[1:09:57] it is simple this word we should not
[1:10:00] make it
[1:10:01] complicated because it was revealed to
[1:10:04] to babes such as these it's actually
[1:10:06] hidden from the wise and The Prudent
[1:10:08] Jesus himself said that these scriptures
[1:10:11] no matter how much they see it they
[1:10:13] could have eyes to see but they don't
[1:10:14] see they have ears to hear but they
[1:10:16] don't hear but he says but unto you he's
[1:10:19] talking personal he's talking
[1:10:21] individuals he's talking election amen
[1:10:25] unto you it has been given to know the
[1:10:27] mysteries of the kingdom and that's why
[1:10:29] when we talk about the mystery of the of
[1:10:32] the seventh seal and the opening of the
[1:10:33] word it's it's it it it means something
[1:10:36] to us because we' we've crossed over
[1:10:40] we've crossed that Chasm of time when
[1:10:43] the angel came he said time shall be no
[1:10:45] more amen we're no longer under the the
[1:10:49] the the the time of of leoda we are in
[1:10:53] leoda but we are actually in a bride age
[1:10:57] we've crossed over into the supernatural
[1:11:00] bride age where the word of God now has
[1:11:02] become a reality to you
[1:11:05] personal amen praise God
[1:11:08] hallelujah and so here now let's read
[1:11:12] our next scripture we're going to try to
[1:11:15] we we're only going to get so far today
[1:11:17] there's there's so much more here now
[1:11:19] brethren in Galatians 4
[1:11:23] 28-31 now we brethren Isaac was are the
[1:11:26] children of Promise we're the children
[1:11:29] of promise okay you got to understand
[1:11:33] that we're not the children of the
[1:11:36] flesh there's the children of
[1:11:39] unbelief which was
[1:11:41] Ishmael then there was Children of the
[1:11:44] flesh which was through
[1:11:46] Isaac which produced
[1:11:49] Israel okay Church
[1:11:52] natural we are of the promised seed
[1:11:56] we're not of any of those seeds we of
[1:11:58] the promised seed which was Christ
[1:12:01] remember that that's the three aspects
[1:12:05] Church unbelief Church natural Church
[1:12:09] spiritual amen brings us to where we are
[1:12:12] but as then he that he that was born
[1:12:16] after the flesh persecuted him that was
[1:12:19] born after the spirit even so is it
[1:12:23] now we are struggling against this Same
[1:12:26] Spirit and we will struggle with it
[1:12:29] until we are changed out of this
[1:12:31] Dimension that's why you're going to
[1:12:34] have to
[1:12:34] overcome that's why to this to to to
[1:12:37] those that overcome in this age will I
[1:12:41] grant to sit with me in the throne what
[1:12:44] is the throne the throne is the place of
[1:12:48] authority the throne is a place where
[1:12:50] God rules and what happens after the
[1:12:53] Great Tribulation we go into 1,000 year
[1:12:56] Millennial peace amen and where do the
[1:13:00] Sons and Daughters of God go to rule
[1:13:03] with him on the
[1:13:06] throne amen so we need to see okay
[1:13:09] nevertheless what sayith the scripture
[1:13:12] cast out the bonds woman and her son for
[1:13:15] the son of the bondswoman shall not be
[1:13:18] air with the son of the free woman so
[1:13:20] then brethren we are not children of the
[1:13:23] Bond woman we we are of the
[1:13:27] free amen because of the because Sarah
[1:13:32] by
[1:13:34] faith okay Sarah by
[1:13:37] faith received the strength in her body
[1:13:42] to bring forth Isaac but it still came
[1:13:45] through
[1:13:46] sex which was the original
[1:13:48] sin and therefore it only brought Church
[1:13:52] natural based on a promise that God had
[1:13:55] given Abraham that his seed would would
[1:13:58] would multiply and and be blessed and
[1:14:01] would be God's chosen people on the
[1:14:04] Earth he even blessed Ishmael and
[1:14:07] ishmael's people became more than the
[1:14:12] children of the free
[1:14:13] woman as we've heard amen praise God and
[1:14:17] so here
[1:14:19] now let's move along
[1:14:22] here because I want to get to a certain
[1:14:24] place
[1:14:26] now now listen here next slide he
[1:14:30] says hold
[1:14:34] on he says oh word
[1:14:37] Believers give my message now hang on go
[1:14:42] back go back sorry I'm one step ahead
[1:14:46] here I've got to go to my notes so here
[1:14:49] now now
[1:14:51] we
[1:14:53] Brethren as Isaac okay we read that okay
[1:14:56] so this is a type that's being fulfilled
[1:14:59] in the church today and even in our own
[1:15:02] flesh like we were saying this struggle
[1:15:05] between the bonds woman and the free
[1:15:07] woman and you as a Believer are going to
[1:15:10] struggle with this this this struggle
[1:15:13] and and especially now even more so as
[1:15:16] we come to the very end of the end time
[1:15:19] to where the struggle now is Right
[1:15:21] within the womb of the message of the
[1:15:23] hour because remember we're way down the
[1:15:27] road if there's elected seed somewhere
[1:15:29] out there in the denominations then
[1:15:31] they're going to need to hear the word
[1:15:33] of God they're going to need to respond
[1:15:34] to the word of God and they will come to
[1:15:37] this Revelation if they are Sons and
[1:15:39] Daughters of God that were in the Lamb's
[1:15:42] Book of Life before the foundations of
[1:15:43] the world they got to come to this they
[1:15:46] can't miss it there's no way that they
[1:15:48] can miss it but this is the very meaning
[1:15:51] of of of what Christ is doing in this
[1:15:55] day and in this hour that he's trying to
[1:15:57] show himself in a people that have
[1:16:00] received the word for their day that
[1:16:02] it's actually him in them it's the very
[1:16:05] essence and the Very meaning of of what
[1:16:08] Christ is trying to reveal through the
[1:16:10] message of this hour amen and so it
[1:16:13] means that God's seed or word has to be
[1:16:17] in us if we're able to
[1:16:20] respond you could never respond to this
[1:16:23] message and be set free unless there was
[1:16:26] an elected seed attribute of God in you
[1:16:30] because we live by faith living by when
[1:16:33] you live by the law it it actually
[1:16:36] doesn't allow Revelation to come into
[1:16:38] your life the moment that you're
[1:16:40] constantly oh you got to do this you got
[1:16:42] to do that you can't do this you can't
[1:16:45] do that you're actually you're you're
[1:16:47] you're you're shutting out the ability
[1:16:50] to receive Revelation which comes by
[1:16:52] Grace so you need to settle down you
[1:16:55] need to allow the Holy Spirit to to
[1:16:57] speak to you you know amen the Lord was
[1:17:00] always very clear in scripture when he
[1:17:01] said the promise word would be would be
[1:17:05] to whom the promis word would go to the
[1:17:08] promised seed amen and the promised seed
[1:17:11] is Christ and that he would come forth
[1:17:14] to bring forth a bride in his very image
[1:17:18] so the promise of Salvation can never
[1:17:21] come by the law it has to come by the
[1:17:24] word
[1:17:25] by Grace amen amen you can't get it any
[1:17:29] other way but you know what people they
[1:17:32] seem to feel a lot safer when they're
[1:17:33] under the law because they know they
[1:17:36] can't do this and they know they can't
[1:17:38] do that and that's why like we were
[1:17:39] saying last week our children cannot be
[1:17:42] brought up under that kind of of
[1:17:44] constant you know School Master yes the
[1:17:47] school Master when you first came to the
[1:17:49] message you came under the school Master
[1:17:52] you were you were uh you know all of a
[1:17:54] sudden because you were like a pagan you
[1:17:55] were wild you were out of control you
[1:17:58] know you come to the Lord and you come
[1:17:59] to realize my God there's unbelief
[1:18:01] everywhere around you and so God had to
[1:18:04] use the school master and the teaching
[1:18:06] of the law to bring order into your life
[1:18:10] but your salvation and your relationship
[1:18:13] does not come by law you can never be
[1:18:15] saved by the law the law will only
[1:18:19] punish you if all you want is law then
[1:18:22] you and and if all you're doing is
[1:18:24] placing that on your children and
[1:18:25] placing that in your ministry and
[1:18:28] placing it upon the people then you're
[1:18:30] constantly having to punish and and and
[1:18:33] that's not the word for this hour no sir
[1:18:37] amen glory to God that's the same way as
[1:18:41] as bringing organization into the church
[1:18:45] and we're not interested in organizing
[1:18:47] because that's the mark of the beast the
[1:18:50] moment that they organize and try to
[1:18:52] take the word and organize the word it
[1:18:54] brings it under under the mark of the
[1:18:55] beast it brings it under the teachings
[1:18:58] of man and they're trying to do it even
[1:19:00] in this message amen how do they do it
[1:19:03] in this message you know they they they
[1:19:06] say well it's it's safe to only say what
[1:19:08] the prophet said even if you don't have
[1:19:11] a revelation of what the prophet said
[1:19:13] just say what the prophet said well in
[1:19:16] the beginning when you come in under the
[1:19:19] school master and you're listening to
[1:19:21] the messages yes you're you're you're to
[1:19:24] you're to hearken to it because it's God
[1:19:27] actually delivering you it's it's God
[1:19:29] bringing the Holy Ghost into your life
[1:19:32] because remember the message of the hour
[1:19:34] is the Holy Ghost and when it comes into
[1:19:36] your life it starts to purge your life
[1:19:38] starts to clean your life starts to deal
[1:19:40] with all the unbelief in your life
[1:19:42] starts to set you free from all the
[1:19:44] things but the moment that you make
[1:19:46] brother brandom the prophet the
[1:19:49] absolute instead of the word as your
[1:19:52] absolute
[1:19:55] where do you end up you end up maybe
[1:19:57] under a seven Thunder Doctrine or you
[1:19:59] end up the seal the seven seal is not
[1:20:02] open or you end up to where oh no no no
[1:20:04] I don't need to go to a church I don't
[1:20:06] need to be under the leadership of a
[1:20:08] pastor I can make voice of God my pastor
[1:20:11] yeah you could there's people that
[1:20:13] legitimately can do that and it's
[1:20:15] because of where they are or whatever
[1:20:17] but until God raises up a minister or a
[1:20:19] five-fold Ministry where you can go and
[1:20:22] receive the word for the perfecting of
[1:20:25] the Saints that's perfectly fine but God
[1:20:28] is always going to make a way according
[1:20:31] to his
[1:20:32] word amen and so you cannot make William
[1:20:36] brandham the absolute it's like making
[1:20:38] Martin Luther the absolute or making
[1:20:40] John Wesley the absolute or saying oh it
[1:20:44] all it all finished up in Pentecost all
[1:20:46] we need to do is go back to Pentecost
[1:20:48] all you need is the evidence of the Holy
[1:20:50] Ghost is to speak in tongues or to have
[1:20:52] healings we're not going back to p
[1:20:54] Pentecost Pentecost is Leo deia There's
[1:20:58] No Redemption there there's no atonement
[1:21:01] there there's no Revelation there it's
[1:21:03] all the teachings and the doctrines of
[1:21:06] man and they've gotten so far away from
[1:21:09] the word of God they don't know that
[1:21:10] they've made the word of God of none
[1:21:14] effect hallelujah we're moving forward
[1:21:18] Saints we don't want we don't want to
[1:21:21] organize this
[1:21:23] message God is is not looking to
[1:21:25] organize this message the holy spirit is
[1:21:28] coming to a church that's why when Jesus
[1:21:32] Christ you know let's read on here I
[1:21:34] don't want to get ahead of myself amen
[1:21:37] why does the scriptures tell us that
[1:21:39] Christ hath redeemed us from the curse
[1:21:41] of the law being made a curse because he
[1:21:45] took everything that was the sin that
[1:21:48] was the result of the law that man would
[1:21:51] fall into sin and unbelief he took it
[1:21:53] all to the cross so that he could make
[1:21:56] that ultimate sacrifice so that you
[1:21:59] don't have to live by the law anymore
[1:22:01] I'm not talking about living you know
[1:22:04] disgracefully either but we're
[1:22:07] free we should be living free we are
[1:22:10] children of the free amen amen we're not
[1:22:13] under the bondage of of the law where
[1:22:16] where everything is do do and don'ts if
[1:22:20] you don't do this then this is going to
[1:22:21] happen if you don't do that no what's
[1:22:24] listen what about the
[1:22:26] relationship what about the the the
[1:22:28] reality of God in your life becoming
[1:22:31] personal to you to where you can go
[1:22:35] through situations and you can see him
[1:22:37] moving in your
[1:22:39] life amen praise God hallelujah listen
[1:22:44] because of the original sin we have a
[1:22:46] carnal nature that's on us and that
[1:22:50] carnal nature is going to be your enemy
[1:22:52] it's going to fight you until the Holy
[1:22:55] Ghost brings it under full obedience to
[1:22:57] the word of God Amen and that's why you
[1:23:00] need to assemble that's why you need to
[1:23:02] feed on the word of God that's why you
[1:23:04] need to know what it is that that you're
[1:23:07] actually feeding on you need to go back
[1:23:10] recognize the day that scripture has
[1:23:12] been fulfilled realize that the seals
[1:23:14] have been opened why was what was the
[1:23:16] purpose of the opening of those seals
[1:23:18] the purpose was so that Redemption could
[1:23:21] be completed so that Redemption could be
[1:23:24] done and and and so that the church that
[1:23:27] that's been talked about that I will
[1:23:29] restore sayeth the Lord all of that had
[1:23:33] to take place in order to bring us to
[1:23:35] where we are right now amen praise God
[1:23:38] and so we need to understand you know uh
[1:23:41] what law and and and Liberty is you know
[1:23:44] Cain was was law Faith was able Abel
[1:23:49] expressed Faith Cain expressed thew
[1:23:52] serving and and worshiping God God all
[1:23:55] by law and all by rules and by Beauty
[1:23:58] and by his own interpretation we're not
[1:24:00] to interpret the word or put our own
[1:24:03] private interpretation on the word of
[1:24:05] God Amen praise God message
[1:24:08] Believers that are living now under the
[1:24:12] law thinking that they're free but
[1:24:14] they're actually under law because
[1:24:16] they're taking the prophet they're
[1:24:19] taking his message they're making it an
[1:24:22] absolute they're making it a Doctrine
[1:24:26] they're allowing the people to to to
[1:24:28] only you know like you know you hear
[1:24:31] testimonies and the testimonies are a
[1:24:33] result of someone listening to the tapes
[1:24:36] only and they glorify that now don't get
[1:24:40] me wrong I've been blessed and and
[1:24:43] healed and God spoke to me and still
[1:24:46] speaks to me through those
[1:24:48] tapes I will never say that that that
[1:24:51] the that the voice of God doesn't still
[1:24:54] speak the voice can speak through
[1:24:56] anyone the voice of God is Not Just
[1:24:59] bottled up into tapes the voice of God
[1:25:02] is a living God that's present in a
[1:25:05] five-fold Ministry in you and in me if
[1:25:08] you've received the pure and adulterated
[1:25:10] word of God for this hour then he's in
[1:25:13] you amen praise God
[1:25:18] hallelujah we just can't go any further
[1:25:20] here because now we're going to we're
[1:25:23] we're going to go in so we're going to
[1:25:24] have to wait until the next time let the
[1:25:26] musicians come I said we would be
[1:25:28] finished by 12:30 amen praise
[1:25:32] God but
[1:25:35] Saints this
[1:25:38] revelation of who God is actually coming
[1:25:42] to in this hour and who he's unveiling
[1:25:45] himself to and why he
[1:25:50] requires pure now I'm not talking about
[1:25:53] pure lives
[1:25:55] you can never live perfect don't even
[1:25:57] think for one minute that you can live
[1:25:59] perfect that's why he went to the Cross
[1:26:03] to bring sin and nailed it to the
[1:26:08] Cross you can't be perfect but there is
[1:26:12] a perfect
[1:26:14] word which is Jesus
[1:26:16] Christ and he wants to come and dwell in
[1:26:20] you he wants you to know that you know
[1:26:25] who you are so that you will not come
[1:26:28] under the
[1:26:30] bondage of the
[1:26:32] bondswoman the nature of Ishmael the
[1:26:36] nature that Cain injected into Eve we're
[1:26:39] going to be looking at all of that the
[1:26:41] next time we come together and we're
[1:26:43] going to be looking at the reason and
[1:26:45] the purpose why God had to come to a
[1:26:48] virgin why it was that he went to the
[1:26:50] Virgin Mary there was something in the
[1:26:53] virgin Mary that that that that would
[1:26:56] that would be required in order to bring
[1:26:59] forth Jesus Christ the the the the pure
[1:27:03] word the pure
[1:27:05] sacrifice the ultimate Perfection of
[1:27:08] God's word come now into you and me as
[1:27:12] the Sons and Daughters of God Amen

[1:42:15] privilege and honor to present to you uh
[1:42:19] this blessed play by our our very own
[1:42:22] Sunday school children
[1:42:24] they have been so dedicated and
[1:42:26] committed the play is
[1:42:28] about the greatest gift which is the
[1:42:31] gift of Salvation and this is what they
[1:42:34] wish to convey in their message and in
[1:42:37] display and hopefully it is a blessing
[1:42:40] to each and every one of you and again
[1:42:43] we are so proud of everyone who have
[1:42:45] dedicated your time and countless hours
[1:42:48] despite everything the obstacles that
[1:42:51] came in their way with flu and traveling
[1:42:53] and everything it has been a little bit
[1:42:56] delayed in timing but nevertheless I am
[1:43:00] proud to present God's lambs of Good
[1:43:04] Neighbor
[1:43:22] Ministries
[1:43:52] e e
[1:44:42] so what do you think Miss John mon to do
[1:44:46] for this holiday project build a snowman
[1:44:48] at a math homework no Liam she said it
[1:44:52] had to something meaningful for
[1:44:54] Christmas not another excuse for you to
[1:44:57] slack
[1:44:58] off we could build a big gingerbread
[1:45:01] house ever like one so big we can
[1:45:04] actually live in it that's preposterous
[1:45:07] do you even know how much gingerbread
[1:45:09] that would take the structural Integrity
[1:45:11] alone relax Aiden he's dreaming big it's
[1:45:15] Christmas me I'd vote for something
[1:45:18] practical like a giant Christmas Pizza
[1:45:23] because nothing says Christmas spirit
[1:45:25] like a greasy slice of pepperon can we
[1:45:28] make it with candy canes that' be the
[1:45:31] coolest pizza ever candy Cates are cute
[1:45:34] Ethan but she said had to be something
[1:45:38] meaningful actually what if we did
[1:45:41] something to help people like collecting
[1:45:43] toys clothes for families who may not
[1:45:46] have much this Christmas I could build
[1:45:48] my I could build my my favorite truck it
[1:45:51] still looks new even I played with it a
[1:45:53] lot that's a great idea Ethan giving
[1:45:56] something you love is a great way to
[1:45:57] show
[1:45:59] kindness and we it's like being little
[1:46:01] angels can be dress up
[1:46:04] too I'd be the Archangel Michael I bet
[1:46:07] he have the biggest Wing is a huge sword
[1:46:10] big guy huge sword totally my body
[1:46:14] that that's a nice idea but what would
[1:46:17] we call it the charity drive of
[1:46:19] Awesomeness that's not bad but let's
[1:46:23] have a name that's about something
[1:46:24] deeper it should represent the true
[1:46:27] meaning of Christmas what do you mean
[1:46:30] something deeper are you saying
[1:46:32] Christmas isn't just about getting
[1:46:40] presents nope it's about giving love and
[1:46:43] the greatest gift of all you mean a
[1:46:47] unicorn no she beats Jesus exactly Jesus
[1:46:51] coming down to earth to be our savior is
[1:46:54] that is the greatest gift because God
[1:46:56] gave gifts to the world giving is a
[1:46:59] great way to show God's love so no
[1:47:02] unicorns then absolutely no unicorns we
[1:47:06] can focus on helping others by
[1:47:08] collecting toys clothes and food for
[1:47:10] families and shelters and by giving to
[1:47:12] food banks oh I love it we can wrap up
[1:47:15] everything in pretty paper and make
[1:47:17] cards too so collect items wrap them up
[1:47:20] and deliver them I'll make the spread
[1:47:23] sheets for the assignments wow Aiden you
[1:47:26] really know how to take the fun out of
[1:47:30] fundraiser that's a great idea Aiden
[1:47:33] let's call it the greatest gift project
[1:47:37] that's perfect because it's exactly what
[1:47:39] God did for us he gave himself as the
[1:47:41] greatest gift to show his love fine but
[1:47:44] I'm still dressing up as Archangel
[1:47:46] Michael I want that huge
[1:47:48] sword as long as you don't eat all the
[1:47:51] donations Liam hey I only did that
[1:47:56] once sounds like you all came up with
[1:47:58] something amazing care to share we're
[1:48:01] calling it the greatest gift project
[1:48:03] it's a way of giving for those in need
[1:48:05] and the way of showing God's love I love
[1:48:08] it excellent idea children and we all
[1:48:10] know that our Salvation through the Lord
[1:48:12] Jesus Christ is the greatest gift ever

[1:52:21] e e
[1:52:53] survive Christmas without EA the
[1:52:54] gingerbread ornaments okay barely but I
[1:52:59] still deserve a
[1:53:00] medal or a plaque that says Liam
[1:53:04] resisted sugar for 12 days probably more
[1:53:07] like 12
[1:53:09] hours speaking of Christmas wasn't the
[1:53:12] greatest gift project amazing I still
[1:53:15] can't believe how much we
[1:53:17] collected my TR is one of those boxes do
[1:53:20] you think the kid who got it liked it
[1:53:22] I'm sure they did Ethan you probably
[1:53:24] made their whole
[1:53:25] Christmas I've got the number we donated
[1:53:28] over 50 toys 30 coats and enough canned
[1:53:32] food to stock an entire
[1:53:34] pantry and here I thought spreadsheets
[1:53:37] were boring whoa that's a lot we're like
[1:53:41] superheroes exactly super Liam saves a
[1:53:44] day one canned Peach at a time hey it's
[1:53:48] not just about the stuff we gave it was
[1:53:50] all the people we met all the families
[1:53:53] were so happy to receive our packages I
[1:53:56] could still remember the look on their
[1:53:57] faces they were totally in awe I didn't
[1:54:00] think it was theoretically possible for
[1:54:02] someone to open their mouth that
[1:54:06] wide seriously though I think about why
[1:54:08] we did this project to begin with to
[1:54:10] show God's love and to spread Sparkles
[1:54:13] and happiness not everything needs
[1:54:15] Sparkles Ethan says the guy who labeled
[1:54:18] the donation bins with glitter pens
[1:54:20] glitter pens areac Aiden said they're
[1:54:24] easy to read Aiden said it worked didn't
[1:54:28] it you both did great everyone did you
[1:54:31] know it wasn't just about giving I
[1:54:34] learned a lot too like what I mean I
[1:54:37] learned all the blessings I take for
[1:54:39] granted and I mean I have so much I
[1:54:42] wasn't able to help those who didn't
[1:54:44] even have warm socks me too I thought
[1:54:47] Christmas was about what I can get now
[1:54:50] it's even more meaningful the more I can
[1:54:52] GI I learned that I'm a natural packing
[1:54:55] gift boxes seriously my bows work
[1:54:59] perfect don't fush it Liam I learned
[1:55:02] that the best gifts isn't about what we
[1:55:04] can buy at the store but how we can show
[1:55:07] God's love in actions and words I think
[1:55:10] I learned that even little things matter
[1:55:13] a small gift can make a big difference
[1:55:16] wow Aiden that was almost
[1:55:21] deep don't get used to
[1:55:25] it good morning kids good morning
