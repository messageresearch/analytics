[0:00] [Music]
[0:13] good evening friends it's good to be in
[0:18] the house of the Lord I'm happy to be
[0:22] here in the middle of the week for our
[0:27] Bible studies let us pray
[0:33] our gracious Heavenly Father bless our
[0:38] Bible study tonight may this lesson be a
[0:42] blessing to every heart may every child
[0:48] of God receive the Word of God and
[0:53] rejoice and give him praise for this
[0:57] great day and for this hour we bless
[1:01] your Holy Name in Jesus wonderful and
[1:06] precious name Amen and amen
[1:10] well tonight I will continue in our
[1:16] introduction to this seven church ages
[1:20] this will be part two now I'm reading
[1:25] from Revelation chapter 1 verses 1 to 2
[1:30] the revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[1:35] gave unto him to shew unto his servants
[1:41] things which must shortly come to pass
[1:45] and he sent and signified it by his
[1:50] angel unto his servant John who bare
[1:57] record of the word of God and of the
[2:01] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[2:05] things that he saw and now I'll read
[2:10] another scripture out of the Gospel of
[2:16] Luke chapter 10 verse 21 in that hour
[2:24] Jesus
[2:25] joist in spirit and said I thank thee O
[2:31] Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that
[2:35] thou has hid these things from the wise
[2:39] and prudent and has revealed them unto
[2:45] babes even so father for so it seemed
[2:50] good in thy sight o praise be to God
[2:57] now in last week's study which we began
[3:04] the introduction to this marvelous book
[3:09] of Revelation I pointed to the fact that
[3:15] John was only an inspired scribe but
[3:23] Jesus Christ Himself was the author it
[3:29] is usually said and many times I've
[3:32] heard it where Pope have said to me odd
[3:36] men wrote the Bible it was just men that
[3:40] wrote that Bible right but we understand
[3:45] clearly that the Bible itself tells us
[3:50] that holy men of God wrote and spoke as
[3:55] they were moved by the Holy Spirit they
[4:00] were inspired so it was not men that
[4:05] actually wrote the Bible men were
[4:08] scribes of the Bible but it was God
[4:12] Himself who wrote a true inspired and
[4:18] surrendered men about himself and his
[4:23] own Word and future things that were to
[4:28] come now there's a beautiful song that
[4:32] I've always loved and it's a song that
[4:36] was sung by the country-western singer
[4:40] bill and country singer Bill Anderson
[4:44] and that song says I have the pencil but
[4:50] he wrote this song I can do nothing
[4:54] alone I held the pencil but he wrote
[4:59] this song I can do nothing alone
[5:04] I meant clear also the teaching on the
[5:10] importance of Revelation to the true
[5:14] believer and in doing so I indicated
[5:18] that I was and I'm now speaking not just
[5:22] about the book of Revelation itself but
[5:27] I'm speaking about the god-given gift of
[5:31] Revelation for unto you it is given to
[5:35] know the mystery of the kingdom but unto
[5:39] them it is not given Oh under you it is
[5:44] given to know the mystery or the hidden
[5:47] things of God the hidden things of God
[5:51] but unto them it is not given it is not
[5:55] given to wise men it's not given to the
[5:58] theologians it's not given to the
[6:01] prudent but it is given to those that
[6:04] are like babes in other words those that
[6:08] are willing to learn God's holy spirit
[6:13] revealing reveals himself in simplicity
[6:17] and is recognized and known in the same
[6:22] way I'm speaking about the gift of
[6:26] revelation I'm speaking about
[6:29] individuals for people that God will
[6:33] give this faculty of Revelation in their
[6:37] soul that they would recognize his word
[6:42] well did he say my sheep hear my voice
[6:46] and the stranger the
[6:49] will not follow revelation the
[6:52] supernatural ability and capacity to
[6:57] recognize and receive revelation from
[7:01] the presence of Almighty God this is a
[7:04] the revelation I am talking about not
[7:08] about the just the book but to
[7:12] understand the book to receive the
[7:15] things that are written in the book to
[7:17] be blessed by the book as you read the
[7:20] book as we study the book we need this
[7:23] faculty this capacity this recognition
[7:27] of what God Spirit is doing in our
[7:31] spirit now we understand that this is
[7:35] also revelation can be also called this
[7:39] sixth sense the sixth sense where we go
[7:44] beyond our five senses and the sense of
[7:48] faith comes into action of course the
[7:53] word faith means a revelation it does
[7:56] not only mean to believe for before you
[8:01] can believe there must be something that
[8:03] you must believe in and that has to be
[8:07] revealed to you
[8:09] so grace is fates foundation God reveals
[8:14] himself to whose whomsoever He wills by
[8:18] his marvelous grace for he said to this
[8:22] very book of Revelation I all the keel
[8:24] David I open and no man shuts I shut and
[8:29] no man opens now I I just spoke to you
[8:35] saying a balla had this supernatural
[8:38] ability you'll find that in Hebrews
[8:41] chapter 11 verse 4 where it says Abel
[8:44] offered a more excellent sacrifice a
[8:48] better sacrifice than Cain oh how
[8:53] wonderful no Bible was written no
[8:56] scrolls were read
[8:58] but but by this of faculty disability
[9:04] God made known to him exactly what he
[9:10] was supposed to offer and what he was
[9:14] supposed to do so by faith by revelation
[9:18] if I knew what he was supposed to do he
[9:24] knew who he was who his brother was
[9:27] where he came from
[9:30] and who was his father blessed be the
[9:33] name of the Lord I emphasize to you that
[9:38] revelation is the key to truly
[9:42] understanding the entire Bible and every
[9:47] word that is in it now by telling this
[9:52] god-given gift of being able to read
[9:57] between the lines and to perceive or see
[10:03] the hidden meanings out of God's Word
[10:07] then friends there you will be the
[10:11] condition or a state where a brace where
[10:15] you have eyes of an open and a humble
[10:19] and surrendered heart to God and you
[10:25] will understand that if the Bible was
[10:28] given to men by inspiration and by
[10:33] revelation then it must be received by
[10:37] revelation it must be accepted by
[10:40] revelation it enters our hearts and our
[10:44] lives by revelation all glory be to God
[10:48] oh we saw how Satan hates this quality
[10:53] of Revelation he hates this ability to
[10:57] receive revelation and because it
[11:01] reveals his origins it reveals his
[11:06] shameful fall from the heights of glory
[11:09] and he was
[11:11] down let me use up a phrase that's a
[11:15] little clearer he was kicked out of
[11:17] heaven just as much as you as a true
[11:21] believer has the right to kick him out
[11:24] of your life kick him out in your
[11:26] consciousness kick him out of your
[11:28] affairs have faith in God
[11:31] only believe all things are possible to
[11:34] them that believe yes so he hates
[11:38] revelation because it reveals to you his
[11:42] original
[11:43] his shameful degradation it reveals
[11:48] still his works his awful terrible
[11:53] murdering lying destroying ways it makes
[11:57] clear to you all of his total defeat by
[12:03] Michael and all of the other angels who
[12:06] defeated him and cast him out of heaven
[12:10] with all of his lies and so he got the
[12:14] name the father of lies and came to
[12:18] earth with vengeance in his heart for
[12:21] all of God's people the whole human race
[12:24] as well as God's elected seed that is
[12:29] within the human race so he hates
[12:33] Revelation with a passion because it
[12:37] also shows his final destruction and the
[12:43] very end of his existence for he is not
[12:47] an eternal being he is not an
[12:50] all-knowing being he is a creature and
[12:55] so his final end is coming and he will
[13:01] totally be dissolved he will lose total
[13:04] existence along with all of his
[13:08] followers that follow in his footsteps
[13:12] acts after his actions and received him
[13:16] as their representative my dear brother
[13:20] my dear
[13:21] tonight you can clearly see why Satan
[13:25] hits all revelation you see this ability
[13:30] to receive revelation to disability to
[13:34] receive present troops and present truth
[13:38] exposes him and that is why Jesus said
[13:42] to Peter he said clearly to him thou
[13:46] wert simon simon barjona flesh and blood
[13:51] has not revealed this unto you but my
[13:55] father in heaven has revealed this unto
[13:58] you and upon this rock will I build my
[14:02] church and the gates of Hell shall not
[14:05] prevail against it
[14:06] Jesus has built his church on the
[14:10] rock-solid foundation of the revelation
[14:14] of himself who is the word no that is
[14:19] that is something that must be meditated
[14:23] upon think upon these things let the
[14:26] Holy Spirit make clear to you his word
[14:30] here tonight all Satan hates revelation
[14:34] but we true believers we love it with
[14:38] all our hearts now we see in the church
[14:42] age book page of 15 listen no Satan hits
[14:51] this book of revelation of Jesus Christ
[14:53] in the church he hates revelation he
[14:57] knows that Jesus Christ is the same
[15:00] yesterday today and forever and he
[15:05] changes not he knows Satan knows that a
[15:11] whole lot more than doom than 90% of the
[15:16] theologians listen he is a being that
[15:20] was in the presence of Almighty God
[15:23] worshipping up there and was kicked out
[15:26] and has so many thousands of years of
[15:31] distance and then a theologian will go
[15:35] to a school for you know five years 10
[15:38] years 20 years whether he studied for 25
[15:41] or 50 years of his entire life and hopes
[15:43] to compete against a Satan in in this
[15:48] type of situation condition the world
[15:51] conditions that we are in the only
[15:54] person that can defeat him decisively
[15:57] and cast him out the only person that
[16:00] can overcome him
[16:02] is Jesus Christ was already defeated him
[16:05] rose up in power and said I am the
[16:08] resurrection and the life in another
[16:11] place he said I have overcome the world
[16:14] all thanks be to God and we overcome the
[16:19] world by he that has already overcome
[16:22] living within our hearts glory be to his
[16:25] marvelous and blessed name Satan knows
[16:29] that the original church with the power
[16:34] of God is the is a blueprint for all of
[16:41] God's body all of his body that is a
[16:45] blueprint for his church but man has
[16:48] changed that blueprint and made at every
[16:51] other church body shape form
[16:56] organization system what however you
[16:59] want to term it they have changed it and
[17:02] split it up into parts now my brothers
[17:07] and sisters Satan knows that when the
[17:10] truth church begins to recognize that
[17:13] are and who she is then we know that
[17:17] he's in real deep trouble because the
[17:21] Holy Spirit working through the church
[17:23] will bring him to account of the Word of
[17:27] God now the book of Revelation shows how
[17:31] the Antichrist spirit will come into the
[17:34] church the violent if you file it and
[17:38] would do everything to destroy God's
[17:41] people and so he fights no
[17:45] of God in every possible way that's what
[17:49] he does that's what his job is to
[17:51] continue to fight the Word of God but we
[17:56] are here standing by the side of the
[17:59] word of God and we stand with the word
[18:03] he knows what the true church should be
[18:07] he knows what kind of character she
[18:11] should have he's fully aware of what
[18:16] works the greater works that the church
[18:20] is supposed to perform under the power
[18:23] of the Holy Ghost under the presence of
[18:25] Jesus Christ living within her life he
[18:29] is aware fully of the church what action
[18:33] she and she should have what kind of a
[18:35] life that she should live yes sir and he
[18:39] is aware of this ability to receive
[18:44] revelation how it exposes him it exposes
[18:49] all of his attempts to destroy the true
[18:53] church God's people
[18:55] it shows and reveals and exposes his
[19:00] constant attacks discrediting the Word
[19:05] of God but belittling the Word of God
[19:09] and by making fun of the word of God and
[19:15] trivializing the Word of God this
[19:18] happens all the time you see it
[19:20] sometimes on TV or you hear it on the
[19:23] news yeah as the Bible already predicted
[19:26] thousands of years ago how that there
[19:28] will come in the end there will come
[19:31] puffers there will come a curse who will
[19:35] say where is the promise of his coming
[19:37] where is this promise of this rapture
[19:40] what about this resurrection you're
[19:42] talking about what of this judgment
[19:45] you're talking about they'll say oh
[19:47] there's no such a thing oh yeah you're
[19:50] just
[19:51] just religious but we are not just being
[19:54] religious
[19:55] we recognize that day the message and
[19:59] they are in which we are living in and
[20:01] we know we are living in the shadows of
[20:04] a coming god we know we're living in the
[20:07] shadow of the coming of our Lord to
[20:10] catch his waiting bright away Satan is
[20:14] furious because of this exposure this
[20:18] revelation of all his works from Eden to
[20:22] this time and into the things that are
[20:26] going to be he is fully aware that we
[20:29] are conscious those who are regulated by
[20:32] the Word of God are conscious of him and
[20:36] can anticipate his works and his actions
[20:39] and the end of the defeat him and
[20:41] destroy him
[20:43] in everything that he tries to do Satan
[20:46] knows that if the people get the true
[20:51] revelation and God anoints them and they
[20:58] become a church anointed by revelation
[21:04] present truth by Jesus Christ himself in
[21:10] the present stage of his ministry that
[21:13] kind of a church will be an invincible
[21:18] army that he cannot defeat he cannot
[21:22] prevail against her in any way yes sir
[21:26] when that church when this church in
[21:30] this day this people this bright this
[21:33] bunch of Revelation believers wherever
[21:37] they are scattered wherever they are
[21:40] some are still in denominations they
[21:42] haven't recognized themselves they
[21:44] haven't recognized their position in
[21:46] Christ some learn various countries of
[21:49] the world speaking different languages
[21:51] but one language they speak is the
[21:54] language of truth the language of
[21:57] revelation the language of
[21:59] opening of the word and the empowering
[22:01] of the Holy Spirit and when the last
[22:04] date church is anointed by this word of
[22:09] God that to be open unto us then we find
[22:13] out when she recognizes realizes what
[22:17] God is doing when she recognizes the
[22:20] importance of the placing and the use of
[22:25] Revelation and that she is of the
[22:29] continuation of the book of Acts
[22:32] then her walk her talk her very the very
[22:37] actions will produced such a vindication
[22:40] that the world will recognized that
[22:44] these are a different people anointed by
[22:48] the pure hand of God and the Spirit of
[22:51] God
[22:51] fools true her for she is just a vessel
[22:56] for his glory and for his honor when
[22:59] that church begins to recognize what she
[23:02] is and who she is
[23:05] that she is a part of the word she is a
[23:08] part of the body of Jesus Christ and
[23:10] that she is him now being revealed
[23:14] Christ is the mystery now being revealed
[23:19] oh thanks be to God that Christ is
[23:23] revealing himself in his own word and
[23:26] that those who have eyes to see and ears
[23:29] ears to hear hear the work of the Lord
[23:32] and recognize your day and a message for
[23:36] your day thanks be to God
[23:38] when that church begins to recognize the
[23:41] word she should be what she should be
[23:44] standing for then she'll drop all her
[23:48] treats
[23:49] she'll drop off her spotty garments of
[23:52] all kinds of litanies and fundamentals
[23:55] and standards and practices of man and
[24:00] the systems of
[24:01] and spotty unclean perverted doctrines
[24:05] given through the centuries and using
[24:08] that to be credibility because yeah it's
[24:11] been around for so many years it's
[24:14] become when allies told over and over
[24:17] again after a while masses of people
[24:20] begin to believe it as truth but the
[24:23] true believer can cut through the veneer
[24:27] of lies and cut to the bone and be able
[24:31] by Hebrews 4:12 the Word of God is a
[24:35] discerner and it's even discern between
[24:38] truth and error lies and truth the
[24:42] Spirit of God in the believer is capable
[24:45] of doing that know what I'm speaking
[24:48] about here the church then we begin to
[24:51] understand what she is capable of she
[24:55] will begin to understand her potential
[24:59] her capacity and her power that Satan
[25:03] cannot withstand now there's a story in
[25:06] the Bible which is the story of Samson
[25:09] I'm sure many of you are aware of the
[25:12] story of Samson and there was one
[25:16] turning when the Philistine army went
[25:21] out to capture Samson just as much as
[25:25] all the demons of all past ages have
[25:29] accumulated in this last day called the
[25:32] division age and the accumulation of
[25:36] demon power is now coming like a flood
[25:40] and gets the Church of the Living God
[25:43] even so these overwhelming forces of
[25:49] over a thousand Philistines came against
[25:54] Samson and Samson had to fight against
[25:59] them and looking around for a weapon he
[26:03] found on the ground the jawbone of an
[26:07] asked that that ass had died and the
[26:13] jawbone was
[26:14] rotten one touch from him it would fall
[26:20] apart but here with the anointing of the
[26:24] Holy Spirit came upon Samson and Samson
[26:30] picked up that jaw bone oven ass and
[26:33] begin to smite the Philistines with the
[26:37] power of Almighty God in him and it's
[26:41] recorded in Scripture
[26:43] on that day that Samson one man
[26:47] destroyed one thousand Philistines with
[26:51] God's help with God's power with God's
[26:53] Spirit with God's anointing upon him he
[26:57] destroyed a thousand Philistines that
[27:00] day a thousand Philistines and let me
[27:03] emphasize Philistine warriors these were
[27:06] not farmers they were different ladies
[27:10] and gentlemen these are not powder puffs
[27:13] these were northern and veteran warriors
[27:18] coming against Samson and Samson came
[27:22] against them with this dry brittle jaw
[27:27] bone of an ass that was laying on the
[27:30] desert floor for years and years big
[27:33] data and the Spirit of God so anointed
[27:37] him it flowed into that jaw bone of an
[27:40] ass and he smoked and slew one thousand
[27:44] Philistines of course that was only a
[27:48] type and a shadow but what God's
[27:52] anointed church what do and should do in
[27:58] this age and in this hour the words of
[28:02] the Bible as I've spoken before have
[28:05] become dry and dead true the dark ages
[28:09] of the church and to a great that steps
[28:12] till drive in its dump given the
[28:15] national habit
[28:16] there it is dry brittle oh my friends
[28:22] that dry bone was like that but thanks
[28:25] be to God that brittle that does that
[28:29] not jump off that was back then which I
[28:34] am assuring to you was the Word of God
[28:36] through the ages that land there within
[28:40] these Muslims of call the church is
[28:44] called denominations called sanctuaries
[28:47] called whatever names that they were
[28:50] given dried up and dead oh we see in
[28:56] their in their activities of mysticism
[28:59] monasticism
[29:01] and finally in our day a whole host of
[29:05] denominationalism they have made the
[29:08] Word of God dry and brittle in the eyes
[29:11] of the people but oh how the Word of God
[29:15] comes alive in the hands of fate faint
[29:19] of courses of Revelation in the hands of
[29:22] one anointed but faith in the hands of a
[29:26] church anointed with acts 2:38 acts 2:4
[29:32] x1a anointed by the Holy Spirit and when
[29:36] they take that word of God in the hands
[29:39] of Revelation oh oh praise God then that
[29:44] true church that was once blinded and
[29:48] has caught the relations of the last
[29:51] prophets message that does the
[29:54] invincible church once not dry brittle
[29:58] bone now becomes a supernatural weapon
[30:02] in the hand of faith of such a church
[30:05] that church will be able by having one
[30:09] of their believers will be able to
[30:12] destroy and chase 1,000 demons and two
[30:18] of them together will chase 2,000
[30:21] disbelieving theological demons of hell
[30:25] away from the
[30:27] of God yes Satan hits Revelation but
[30:30] thanks be to God
[30:32] we love it he hates it but we love it
[30:37] for Revelation is supernatural and he
[30:40] can't get it for God reveals to
[30:44] whomsoever He wills for unto you it is
[30:48] given it's a gift it's given to know to
[30:53] know the mystery the hidden things of
[30:55] God but unto them it is not given Oh
[31:00] blessed be the name of the Lord
[31:03] revelation friends helps us to
[31:07] understand and discern between good and
[31:11] evil what is good and what is evil and
[31:14] makes plain to us the hidden things of
[31:18] God that was hidden for ages and for
[31:22] dispensation as Paul said Oh glory to
[31:26] his marvelous wonderful name by the use
[31:29] of this supernatural weapon oh thank god
[31:33] this weapon of Revelation we are able to
[31:37] stun and see Satan's activities too Anto
[31:44] sense his presence we also were able to
[31:48] recognize his when the truth his spirit
[31:52] right recognize two spirits
[31:56] working within the framework of the
[32:00] Church of the Living God
[32:02] now as Cain and Abel were born in the
[32:09] womb of King there were twins and they
[32:13] were in the womb of Eve together so are
[32:19] twins
[32:20] within the body of the modern day Church
[32:26] twins in the beginning twins in the end
[32:29] but the Spirit of the Living God is here
[32:33] to discern the Lord's body the Spirit of
[32:36] God is here to create the situation
[32:39] operation from unbelief and for the
[32:42] believer to recognize oh praise God so
[32:46] these two spirits are at work within the
[32:50] church body in this last night one God
[32:54] one of Satan twins in the beginning and
[32:58] here come the twins again in the end all
[33:02] children of God wherever you are this is
[33:06] the art of the manifestation of the
[33:09] certified seed sons and daughters of the
[33:12] Living God oh come and go with me
[33:16] tonight to my father's house where there
[33:19] is joy and peace oh there is love and
[33:22] grace and fellowship enjoy an
[33:26] understanding and light for me a
[33:28] children of the light we do not walk in
[33:31] darkness but the people who sentence
[33:34] spiritual ignorance on darkness have
[33:36] seen a great light and are walking in
[33:40] that light today oh the evening lights
[33:42] of common is a fact that God and Christ
[33:46] are one Oh Lord of God come my brothers
[33:49] my sisters across the world across the
[33:53] nation wherever you are come and enter
[33:56] with me into this glorious Liberty of
[33:59] the manifestations of the sons and
[34:02] daughters of God truly truly Satan hates
[34:06] the light of Revelation but we love it
[34:10] we love it and we love it because it
[34:13] empowers us to discern him it empowers
[34:19] us to discern his Antichrist spirit he
[34:23] may be did you know that Satan is a
[34:26] religious being lots of people will say
[34:30] oh there is no god but Satan is
[34:32] religious enough to know right that
[34:35] there is a God and that's why he
[34:37] trembles for his end is at hand so the
[34:42] Spirit of God in the true believer is
[34:44] able to deserve
[34:47] by the word by spiritual gifts by
[34:51] anointing that various means Satan his
[34:54] activities his works his presence his
[34:57] actions in this religious operating in a
[35:01] religious realm with his religious
[35:05] enticing spirits and seducing spirits
[35:10] blinding and deceiving and misleading
[35:14] the minds and the hearts of men all
[35:17] thanks be to God for the lesser the holy
[35:20] spirit of truth that John the Apostle
[35:23] speaks of how that when he the spirit of
[35:27] truth is come he will guide you into all
[35:30] truth and show you things to come we
[35:33] love revelation don't you I love
[35:36] revelations because Satan and his
[35:40] cronies all his followers all his imps
[35:45] become powerless and paralyzed
[35:48] under the bright revealing spotlight of
[35:51] God's Word being made manifested oh
[35:55] thanks be to God we love revelation I
[35:59] love revelation because it causes us to
[36:03] be able to checkmate Satan
[36:08] checkmate his evil moves whether with
[36:12] the word whether in the church body or
[36:15] whether in life we are able to recognize
[36:19] his activities his movements and to
[36:23] checkmate him and to stop unlock his
[36:27] evil moves and what all of his plans
[36:32] that he planned meticulously and yet we
[36:36] we we water in and out of them we walk
[36:40] in the fiery walk out of the fire and
[36:43] none of our clothing none of our being
[36:46] is burned or smoky or worldly or touched
[36:50] by him Oh blessed be the name of the
[36:54] Lord we are able by this facility to be
[36:57] a
[36:58] to uncover all his schemes on all of his
[37:04] manipulations and the strategies we are
[37:07] able to recognize his undermining of the
[37:12] kingdom of God and rebuke him
[37:14] in the name of Jesus Christ saying the
[37:17] Lord rebuke thee in Jesus name we love
