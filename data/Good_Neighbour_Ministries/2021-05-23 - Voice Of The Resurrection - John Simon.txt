TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good sunday morning friends once again we are gathered together to give glory to his marvelous name as a people assembled in his name to give him praise honor and glory praise be to god now i would like to recognize that this day is the memorial day of pentecost it's called pentecost sunday a immemorial to the day when the holy ghost fell upon the apostles on the day of pentecost in the upper room my visit there to that room in jerusalem was certainly a life-changing experience and a wonderful thing to be there i give god the glory for the marvelous and wonderful opportunity to visit the upper room may god take our hearts and our souls back to the upper room again not so much to speak with towns but to be able to receive the word like they did until they got so excited they could hardly hold their speech may the lord help us this marvelous wonderful and glorious sunday that we have come together as seed saints sons and daughters of god in a marvelous fellowship here upon the earth once our fellowship which we cannot remember from the dim past of the eternities when we lived in the mind and presence of god glorifying and praising him all day long but now being here upon this earth trapped in a human body we do the best we can in the frailty of human nature and human flesh but i certainly recognize today the memorial day of the very first original pentecost but for today i'm not thinking about the holy ghost coming down my thought is about the bride of christ going up and my topic is voice of the resurrection our scripture for today is found in 1st thessalonians chapter 4 from verse 13 to 18. shall we read but i would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also with sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this i say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words our gracious wonderful heavenly father may the great holy spirit take these words from human lips and further transform them into instruments of your voice give the winds a mighty voice let the holy spirit send forth your truth and light piercing the darkness near and far father wherever light is needed shine into the dark corners of every heart and every place of the earth may men and women come to recognize you as the great shining light the one who sits upon the throne yes lord we bow down before you we adore you we magnify you we give you all the praise the honor and the glory this day we pray may you gush forth your spirit and your word that we might live under its refreshing graces and rise up to call you blessed in the name of jesus christ whom we love and serve amen and amen praise god my brothers and sisters friends wherever you are in this scripture that we have just read god himself is speaking to us through the apostle paul about the rapture mystery now throughout the church ages and since the days of paul no one fully understood the rapture process of the rapture the unfolding of the rapture until brother william marion branham came on the scene sent by god to fulfill malachi 4 5 revelation 10 7. now brother branham was the one which revealed this rapture mystery in its simplicity at the time when he unfolded it many of the preachers didn't want to hear the rejected hymn and even now some still reject him the prophet to this 20th century sent by god calling him names as much as they called jesus names but nevertheless he was sent by god authorized anointed by the living god and vindicated by the spirit of god to bring this revelation of the rapture to us for a mystery is something that is hidden as uh a revelation is something that opens up and reveals that secret or that mystery now the revelation of the rapture understood by him and taught by this 20th century prophet he revealed that it first of all would be a secret rapture it will not be as many have visualized it and have dramatized it or have drawn it in pictures showing folks coming out of their graves and night gongs and slowly rising i should say white guns are slowly rising into the skies and going into the presence of god and the whole world watching on while they're going up and and then some of those believers waving and saying well you should have listened to me you would not be left behind now look i'm being caught no that's not how it's going to be the prophet revealed it would be a secret rapture for jesus himself said he would come as a thief in the night okay he made it clear that this rapture would be in three stages and clearly he said the shout the voice the trumpet of course we understand that we want to examine this we want to examine it in the form of the voice of the resurrection jesus is descending paul draws the picture of jesus descending coming for his bride and as he comes for his bride he gives a shout and then the voice and then the trumpet now brother sister why does he come secretly and why is this a secret because first of all we ought to read revelation 5 1-5 in which a cry goes out throughout heaven of if there is one that will take the book out of the hand of him who sits upon the throne and would take the book and open the seven seals that seals up the book which is to say that the the word of god was sealed through the seven church ages sealed with seven seals and who will come take the book and will open these seven seals oh no man was found worthy a voice said no man was found worthy to open the book and the bible says john wept for no man no pope nope protestant no catholic no denominationalist no man whether he's interdenominational whether he's a superintendent a bishop an archbishop apostle whatever he wants to call himself the bible says no man was worthy none could open the book and if anyone tells you they can break those seals of themselves they cannot do it matter of fact it's already been broken by the holy spirit but can only be perceived by those who have already been given this seed germ of god or the master key in their soul to unlock the secrets of the word of god that you might ignore him in the power of his resurrection and in the fellowship of his sufferings and there came a bloody lamb and that lamb which we know the lamb was jesus christ a bloody bleeding lamb what fought a battle and ice preached on that how he went down in the hell and fought the great battle against satan and took away the keys of death hell and the grave amen and came up bringing captivity captives and giving back gifts unto men and coming back down in the form of the holy spirit to anoint his people and his children as they walk with him and in him so now here he comes he who has taken the book the seven sealed book is descending and he is descending as our kinsman redeemer to redeem us for the purpose of redemption the purpose to take his children out of here amen thank god for him as our great kinsman redeemer that will be another study but let's leave that now meaning that he is our brother he is our blood relations oh praise god descending to take us just take the study of the kinsmen redeemer and you'll know what i'm talking about those those believers who are aware of it rejoice in your soul your kinsmen redeemer has come is coming to redeem you through marriage by the invisible union hallelujah of this word of god and your soul that you might be born again truly born again not by the words of man not because you you're or you're crying because your old mother died or your old mother comes and say come to jesus and then you have a sentimental feeling no but you come with a clear understanding and revelation of why you must repent why you must be born again why must you must experience a supernatural awakening of this seed that god planted in you from before the foundation of the world oh glory to god our kinsman redeemer hallelujah is coming down and he's coming down my friends to claim his purchase possession because he has purchased us like uh like ruth was purchased hallelujah amen he's coming to purchase us by his precious blood not with silver and gold but with the precious blood of the lord jesus christ come in to claim what is his amen your praise god doesn't matter how many years you spent in the devil's pawn shop a man amen glory god and you couldn't come out because nobody could pay the redemption price to take you out of that pawn shop with all those dead rotten things in there oh my god left you and allowed you to be in something on the national pawn shop oh my and you were there like a show piece in that pawn shop but nobody could pay the redemption price to take you out but take god one day one day one came praise god and revealed his word to your soul paid the price on canvas cross pay the price and brought you out hallelujah amen and now he owns you you belong to him and and he belongs to you praise god he comes to claim his purchase possession hallelujah well you know claiming uh it's something else that is why young men or men and women shouldn't go around kissing kissing kissing kissing like that because an actual fact a real kiss is a claim in other words a man kisses a woman he's claiming her as his own these frivolous social so-called dignified kissing and kissing it's not scriptural oh my glory to god hallelujah and saw friends a man kisses a woman he's claiming her as his own and so by seven kisses seven thunders of the word of god god is making his claim through the voice hallelujah through the shout and through the trumpet that's going forth in this day and in this hour to make a people wake up and cut to themselves and become aware that the power of the holy spirit is in the land oh praise god the fig tree and the turtle dove is in the land again it's springtime again and the holy spirit is here to raise his children up amen quicken those who are dead in sins and trespasses quitting those who were dead on the dead doctrines oh my god he's here to quicken your heart your mind your soul open your spiritual eyes that your natural eyes open your spiritual ears that you might hear that your soul might understand glory to god and you might enter into the revelation of the word by him who is the way or gate the truth and the life praise god hallelujah amen oh here we are come down to do what to be kissed by the sun you're here not to be kissed like the oranges in florida with the s-u-n that you could be a sun-kissed orange but you are here to be the sun-kissed bride of jesus christ kissed by the s-o-n lord of god hallelujah claiming you that you are his and his alone praise god no wonder he said i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you but i'll be with you to the very end of the age when men and god becomes one when man and god unites again and there's a uniting time there's a oneness with god the great holy spirit calling to his people the shepherd's voice has gone forward he's calling to his people come home from home come home come home at supper time oh it's going home time at last lord of god amen amen praise god claiming his own amen thank god that we've been kissed by the s o n the son amen the word has been revealed to us praise god and now we are sun-kissed christians walking in the light of our day hallelujah the lord descending as kinsmen redeemer coming to claim his own and he's coming my friends to also call his children from the very dust of the earth praise god voice of the resurrection to call those who have a are already dead are in the ground are in the ground out there but he is also coming to call his children his seeds his seeds that were in him that was manifested through the church and by the revelation of the word he is coming to call them from not that dirt but from this dust of the earth to call you to consciousness and awareness of who you are that you are not just a creature of time but you come from eternity and by the grace and power of almighty god you're going back to eternity again or the great holy spirit has come to call his own oh praise god hear his voice obey his call surrender your will or let him have his preeminence over you that you may become the children of god you may become captives of christ hallelujah that you may become those that are completely surrendered to him to call you out of this dust of this earth where you were spiritually buried oh praise god if you were in a denominational dirt or in the dirt of denomination he is here by the word to call you out of that dirt to come into life praise god to come alive in the word of god and in the power of the holy spirit oh praise god forevermore amen oh you say brother simon don't get so excited just relax my friends i just can't relax in an hour like this i can't help being excited and trailed beyond boundaries with joy unspeakable and full of glory because i know that he is descending to reverse the curse that was here given to us by adam and eve the entire human race cursed with sin with pain with sickness with affliction with all manner of possession oppression depression everything came upon us and is on the entire human race but thanks be to god glory to his name that he has returned lord of god to do what reverse the adamic curse oh praise god from death to life hallelujah from sin to righteousness from darkness to light from chaos to christ to walk in the light of the day oh praise god hallelujah he is here to reverse the curse amen the head for this church body or his body is coming down it's descending looking for a resting place like the capstone on the pyramid the head is coming the lord is coming the king has come in to rest upon his body amen glory to god hallelujah yes sir amen that wonderful headship that we have in christ our only true leader is jesus christ whether he is in the form of jesus christ the flesh when he was on earth or in the form of the holy spirit when he returned back in spirit form same jesus christ same god amen but now in spirit form he is our leader we are not led by man but sons and daughters of god are led by the spirit of almighty god hallelujah glory to god to his holy name amen the dynamics is coming down to his mechanics life is coming to the body and the dynamics is coming into the mechanics to make this mechanics live again walk again move again hallelujah and we who are here and are alive the spirit is here to start to quicken you for the rapture and the resurrection glory god hallelujah you're not going to be just raptured on one raptured like that my friends oh praise god one day we're certainly going to hear a trumpet that's the way they visualize it you know and and all of a sudden we all go up at the same time it's not like that it's not in the word of god oh no no no my friends amen but where change has already begun oh my any of you who have gone into an aeroplane are you seeing the spacecraft take off the spacecraft just doesn't go through and it's got no it first goes slowly it's speaking up speed it's being quickened it's getting quicker and quicker so that's what's happening with us mind soul body everything is being quickened you had he quickened by his holy spirit the holy spirit is quickening us by the voice of the resurrection for the rapture which is now in progress oh praise god we are being changed for you shall be changed oh praise god paul said amen how are you going to be changed when you're going to be changed not just like that one day but you are now being changed your disposition your name your entire being is being changed until one day the process will be complete from the inside to the outside your soul change your spirit is being renewed and then your body resurrected raptured or raptured out of here by the grace of the living god and we are in the midst of the process right now as the holy spirit is moving with his mighty wings across the face of the waters of the peoples of the earth calling those to his uh their attention calling them back to himself back to the word back to christ back to the original faith to walk in the way that he has ordained for us oh glory be to god hallelujah amen many of us know it and you know it whenever a king is coming he always has a herald or a forerunner somebody goes before and tells the crowd stay aside oh in the modern times you may have a biker of riders going ahead and you know the president is coming royalty is coming the king is coming and they're telling you stand back stay back the king is on the way he's coming cleared away hallelujah amen the king is coming and that's what john the baptist did in the book when he came physically saying the king is coming amen oh messiah is on the way praise god hallelujah john said i am the voice i am the voice lord of god preparing the way of the lord and brother branham literally said it's not me i'm not talking about me i am only the voice i am the voice hallelujah praise be to god we have had a voice in our day our generation sing prepare the way prepare your heart prepare your church repair your home prepare your life the lord is on the way the coming of the lord is at hand he's on the way make way for the king is coming lord god hallelujah amen because he was a herald in our day to preach the word of god preparing the way for jesus christ the seventh seal to come upon the scene with the opening of the word of the living god february 20th 1955 brother branham spoke on the second coming of the lord april 17 1957 jeffersonville indiana he preached the second coming of christ january 1st 1958 chicago illinois he preached the second coming of the son of man then january 62 he spoke the sign of his coming 30th of december 1962 sirs what is the time is this the time oh my praise god all that was to say behold the bridegroom cometh from your going out to meet him prepare yourself prepare your heart prepare your home prepare yourselves the coming of the lord is at hand amen the coming of the lord is here oh praise god go out to meet him amen and so what happened god's prophet brought forth the revelation of the seven seals and of course the seventh seal was the revelation of the secret coming of the lord in word form now of course we know that in tucson arizona where this the wonderful marvelous picture of the cloud that i normally would wear if you will notice it is in the face of christ but white hair white clouds around him forming his face now you might look at that and think that was a beautiful artistic drawing of of of some man it was not it's the supernatural artistry and the supernatural representation of god representing revelation 1. standing there with the white here the supreme judge the god the king of kings the almighty god first and the last beginning in the end o praise god root and branch same yesterday today and forever jesus christ who never changes the omnipotent god one god hallelujah here he is descending for his own the hour has come the power of god and the holy spirit god coming for his children oh praise god coming to make up his jewels oh get ready brother sister get ready sister oh praise god hallelujah he's preaching he's coming he's coming the bright room is coming but certainly my friends it changed in june of the same year he started preaching not that he's coming but a greater than solomon is here is now here praise god here in word form in revealed word form oh praise god june he 28 flashing red light of his coming amen then he preached on the token amen praise god the token meaning christ himself here on the scene then he speaks on the indictment how you're going to indict somebody for this crucifixion in our day and in our time that they have crucified and are crucifying the word of god again in this day and in this hour from their pulpits not from god's hill but from their high and mighty puppets with the spear truss and the and the sword piercings by taking this very bible taking their their spears and criticizing calling it names piercing it everything else and then turn around and say oh i believe god and while the jews were saying we believe in messiah they were killing the very messiah on the cross while he was hanging there saying father forgive them for they know not what they do and here it is again these churches doing the same thing crucifying the word of god again calling it names calling it be elsa bob calling him that he didn't know who his father was in other words where did you get that from what is that oh my goodness gracious back to the bible search out these things whether they be of god or not they're in your book they're in your bible you've just got to search it hallelujah amen amen he's coming he's coming then all of a sudden he says a greater than solomon is here he's here so spiritually messiah is on earth now jesus is here his appearing in our midst by supernatural occurrences showing to you that his appearances is preparing us for his physical coming his personal coming again to take us out of here amen and he's here to call his children out of the dust of the earth by his spoken word for this hour and for this day bringing this bringing this and bringing us into the manifestation of the third pull or praise god like the first adam should have done using his spoken word to bring forth his child but instead god's program was temporarily derailed by the cunning fertility and intellectuality of the serpent in the garden which was not a snake at that time it was still uh the missing link that they are searching for as revealed by the servant and prophet of god this missing link is the serpent it stood up like a man it talked like a man it walk like a man it looked like a man the only thing it did not have is a soul because it was an animal it was an animal it is an animal between man and the rest of the animals and beasts and so he was able to contaminate the entire human race with his seed along with eve committing adultery amen contrary to the word of god bringing forth nothing but canaan uh a cane and canaanite business and all of that and leading into babel babylon and all the confusion and the nominations that we have here today oh my friends here it is in the word of the living god the gods program which he had in the beginning was upended amen god's program was thrown off kilter like this earth one day is going to be shocked into going off kilter and the weather patterns which are already changing and becoming extreme are going to get worse oh my friends it'll be like nothing you've ever seen before amen oh you said brother simon if god's program uh got off track how could it get back on track again and what part do we play in this amen praise god now genesis 1 god was creating but at the end of the sixth day after god had made adam and eve he stopped at that point with his program of creation and told them multiply and replenish the earth genesis 1 28 go out multiply and replenish the earth you see when god says that in the word we are thinking now humanly we are thinking now naturally down through the centuries how it's been handed down that they would produce children a certain way as we in our time and through the centuries have produced children that's the way we think god was speaking but you see my friends god wasn't speaking like that god was speaking to adam to do like i did i reproduce myself in you how by my spoken word speaking the two of you into existence molding and shaping you by the spoken word like us we are here in the word and the word of god is now molding and shaping us according to his spoken word amen hallelujah and so god made adam at that time with his bride in him amen adam's bride was already in him and so even so when jesus came his bride was in him praise god so eve was taken from adam's side and there less feminine feminist spirit was taken from adam and given its own body amen when it was taken from adam god did not pick up a separate piece of dirt but it took a part of adam to create eve which is a symbol that the true church will not be something created by man or manhandled but it will be a part of the original christ the original anointed word is what would make up the bride or the wife of jesus christ he took a part of adam to make eve god takes a part of his word to make the bride or to create the bride praise be to god he took the feminist spirit out of adam and place it in this wife this body now called eve so praise god that's why man shouldn't have any of that feminist spirit and women should not have any of that manish male spirit that kind of aggressive uh spirit that's in a man amen i'm not talking about being overly aggressive i'm not talking about there's just the spirit and action and attitude of a man he doesn't have to do anything for it to make itself manifest or ex he just stands there and he is a man she stands there and she is a woman because the spirit that god placed there one is feminist and one is man amen and so god took the feminist out of the man placed it there in its own body amen and so praise god hallelujah god was showing them the secret of of reproduction how he multiplied himself in the form of adam and eve by his spoken word and now there were supposed to go out and do the same by adam's spoken word just like how god gives us his word we as his bride church take his word and we speak it to be able to call and create call from the dust of the earth and create other sons and daughters of god so adam should have spoken his word of what he wanted son daughter to eve and then eve would take adam's word first adam's word like we are taking second adam's word and speak it and it would create or call that son or that daughter into existence by the power of god's eternal word or hallelujah amen amen praise god i thank god my brother sister that eve came from god splitting adam you know men thought it was a great discovery when they were able to split the atom atom but it was a greater thing when god split adam amen and made man and woman male and female praise god created he them all praises marvelous name and here we are at the pentecost there was a dunamis an explosion a spiritual explosion why god was creating a bride amen because the first one fell in the garden amen oh my god and here he was creating another one oh my lord hallelujah that she might stand by his word she must carry out his word speak his word and give glory to his marvelous name amen amen there were one in person and when there were one in person in adam because remember at one time eve was in adam and when you looked you saw only adam because she was in him she was there already but she was in him amen but when you looked you only saw adam and they were core equal core equal together there of one name of one accord because there were one amen and the bible tells us in genesis 5 1 to 2 and their name was called adam their name was called adam she was not called eve or named eve until after the sin in the garden amen oh think of it and so uh when she was called eve it was not even god that called her eve it was adam called her eve which means mother of all living amen he didn't say mother uh that she was that he was the father or she was the mother of his sons both his sons but there it goes praise the lord amen mother of all living praise god and so my friends at that time there were still living in god's eternal day they were still in an eternal day amen but remember time had not yet begun it was not being yet counted and recognized there was still living in an eternal day but when they sinned of course they fell they fell from that eternal day into time and time began and once time begins aging begins if there was no time then nobody could count any age and we would be ageless we will be going on and on and on but no age but the moment time began aging began sickness sin began all manner of things begin and you know aging leads to death amen because what happened they cross the line they cross from eternity over in the time and the timeline between the two realms was broken their oneness with god was broken adam lost his life spiritually speaking he became lost he lost his life and i've said this before i'll say it again then he lost his wife and she then was not counted cro equal with him anymore he lost his spiritual inheritance of having dominion over all the entire earth and that's when they both had separate names after sin after the fall after time began then they both had different names now you have adam and you have eve oh my think about it amen you'll find my friends genesis 3 20 it was not god that named eve but adam that named her eve now praise god thank god anyway i praise god and thank god for my fifth rib i thank god for my precious wife amen praise god because that fifth rib i understand protects your heart and oh glory to god a real wonderful precious wife a wonderful wife always wants to be protective of her husband and she wants to always defend him and that rib just lays across that heart and protects it lord of god hallelujah god give us women like that god give us wives like that god give us laws that will go back to obeying the word living by the word with dignity with integrity with excellence with worthwhileness worthiness let the joy of god fill your soul faithfulness fill your life and walk in the great character of jesus christ o beauty the beauty of holiness praise god the beauty of god-given modesty glory to god that's in this bible in the word of god hallelujah glory to god look uh i i'm just feeling the spirit here i just don't want to go off in different directions i'm seeing so many things while i'm speaking on it so let me just stay clear on the path that i am right now praise god hallelujah now adam was given eve to reproduce himself and that's what a man is given a bride for or has a bride for esto reproduce himself the second adam who is jesus christ also was given a bribe which we know the church the true church the revelated church the one who obeys his word listen to his word lives by his word lives in his presence and walks with him amen any woman can claim their mrs jesus any woman could put up a signboard saying they're christian saying they're they're this or whatever but it's the one my friends that lives with him in his house in his presence with his name upon her with his robe of righteousness on her with the with his ring on her finger well spiritually speaking amen oh praise god and she is the one that's gonna get the limousine or the chariot ride into glory from the presence of almighty god because she is the one he's coming for oh glory to god the lord himself shall descend with a shout the voice of the resurrection hallelujah and the trump of god amen amen glory to god hallelujah amen so praise god jesus christ himself was a spoken word seed sun just like the first adam was see adam was created and placed on the earth by god's spoken word and never passed through a woman but because of sin to redeem us back jesus god made himself into flesh called the begotten son begotten because it had to pass through the woman called mary amen that is why the bible speaks to us in another place that this is the beginning of the creation of god not that this supernatural spirit of god can be created but it's talking about that body that was created amen hallelujah and so that is how he came on the scene when adam's bride was in him they were called adam and when jesus bride is in him and when we are in him we are called christian we are called his name mrs jesus christ hallelujah lord of god amen what are we here for we are here to live lives to be the bride of christ so that he the word will be able to reproduce himself through astro testimony through the blood of the lamb amen and the word of our testimony he will be able to reproduce himself oh thank god he's reproducing himself thank god he's manifesting himself thank god is the same yesterday today and forever a god who cannot change who cannot lie a god who is omnipotent on the present the almighty the mighty god in christ amen hallelujah amen yes sir praise god hallelujah because he's the spoken word seed son and she came from him then she has to be a spoken word seed virgin bride amen by the word of god but the word has wiped out everything from her life and brought her to a place of spiritual virginal purity by the word of god that was quickened to her glory god hallelujah amen oh praise god hallelujah brother sister uh this thought is now going into a another little direction here and i'd like for us to pause at this point in time ah i'll just want you to salivate over the seven course meal that the lord is enabling me to place before you the next course is yet to come let's wait for the next course next sunday and hear what the word of god will be to say to us but for what you've heard here today let us go out and reproduce let us go out and multiply ourselves and when i say that i'm not speaking about physically i'm speaking spiritually i'm speaking about winning others to christ and i don't mean wrestling them to the ground arguing with them over scripture lassoing them you know i'm branding them with a church brand or a church name on there on their hide no sir that's not what we're here for we are not here to persuade we are not here to convince anybody we are here only to share and if there is any seed life hiding behind that skin then the seed of god that was planted there before the foundation of the world because like he said to jeremiah jeremiah i knew you before you was even in your mother's belly i know you because you first of all jeremiah was in him and then he placed him where he was to be born through a certain mother certain father just like with us so we are here now and now my brother sister he has to allow the word of god to be spoken to bring us to life again to spiritual resurrection by the spoken word of god to recognize that you are not just a church member you're not supposed to be just a church member you're a son of god you say oh but i'm a servant of god we are not just servants of god we are sons and daughters of god and because we are sons and daughters of god we want to serve god oh praise god but we are not here as just servants of god we are called to be sons daughters children of the most high and paul as the as the book of acts tells us for we know amen that god has made of all men of one blood and they are the offsprings or children of the almighty praise god so skin color tone whatever makes no difference who you are where you are king commoner prince popper down in the ditcher up there in in the ghetto or up in the palace doesn't make any difference praise god it's what's behind your skin what god place in you that seed that germ life that god placed there when it hears this word amen and i'm confident of it that this is the word of god for this hour whoever it is when they hear this word it wakes up something in you you come awake and you begin to realize who you are that i'm not just a creature of time i come from eternity and i'm going back to eternity i come from god and i'm going back to god hallelujah i'm just doing time i'm just passing through time and i've come from eternity i'm passing through time and i'm going back to eternity back to god that's what jesus was saying when he said i come from
