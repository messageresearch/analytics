[17:30] Take up your cross

[18:51] on the cross. Take up your cross and
[18:54] fall
[18:56] by.
[18:58] Oh my
[19:02] god.
[19:09] [Music]
[19:16] [Music]
[19:26] We are often exhausted and driven on the
[19:30] restless sea of
[19:33] the skies and how the soft
[19:38] [Music]
[19:47] we will understand.
[19:49] [Music]
[19:51] One of the days we understand it by and
[19:55] by
[19:58] when the morning comes when all the
[20:07] we will tell the story
[20:11] how we
[20:13] [Music]
[20:15] understand
[20:16] [Music]
[20:20] our trials. Start on every
[20:24] and we can understand
[20:27] all the ways that God is leading
[20:32] from the sky. But he guide us
[20:37] and we
[20:40] and we understand.
[20:44] [Music]
[20:47] Oh my
[20:52] go
[21:14] and by and
[21:21] and all the saints of
[21:26] Oh, we will tell the story
[21:31] of your
[21:35] understanding.
[21:38] I'm justified. I'm justified.
[21:43] I'm justified.
[21:47] I'm not done in the first place. I'm
[21:51] justified.
[21:53] I'm justified.
[21:57] I'm justified.
[22:01] Haven't done it in the first place.
[22:04] You're justified.
[22:05] [Music]
[22:07] I was sitting alone and wondering about
[22:11] what I'm supposed to do.
[22:14] I can't deny the times I've made
[22:17] mistakes. I can't hide it from you. Can
[22:19] you? But I know that deep in my soul and
[22:24] he's sorry, honestly.
[22:27] So I cried and said, "Forgive me, Lord.
[22:31] Forgive me. He will
[22:34] justify
[22:37] justify.
[22:41] I'm not
[22:44] justified.
[22:47] Justified.
[22:50] I'm justified.
[22:54] I haven't done it in the first place.
[22:57] I'm justified.
[23:00] So often I'm so discouraged when I count
[23:05] the times I fall. Oh, he promised I'd be
[23:09] victorious when I don't know. And I
[23:15] heard
[23:16] screaming his voice.
[23:20] He said, "You have done it in the first
[23:23] place. You justify
[23:26] God. I'm justified."
[23:29] Hallelujah. Just
[23:32] [Music]
[23:37] place you just
[23:39] [Music]
[23:47] haven't done it in the first place to
[23:51] justify.
[23:53] He looked at your perfect picture with
[23:58] all things sparkle.
[24:01] He didn't see you from where you are now
[24:05] from eternity.
[24:07] He said you just dropped in that body.
[24:10] You bypass your
[24:16] first.
[24:19] Oh glory justify.
[24:22] Hallelujah.
[24:24] Justify
[24:25] [Music]
[24:29] the first place you justify.
[24:40] I believe I need
[24:45] one more time.
[24:47] Justify.
[24:50] Justify.
[24:57] Justify.
[25:00] [Music]
[25:04] Justify.
[25:07] You haven't done it in the first place.
[25:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank God for that. Amen.
[25:16] You haven't done it in the first place.
[25:18] You're justified.
[25:20] And God will make a way.
[25:26] When there seems to be no way,
[25:32] he works in ways
[25:35] you cannot see.
[25:38] He will make a way for me.
[25:44] He will be my guide.
[25:48] Hold me closely to his side
[25:54] with love and strength.
[25:57] For each strength,
[25:59] he will make a way.
[26:03] [Music]
[26:04] God will make a way.
[26:12] God will make a way.
[26:17] It seems to be no way.
[26:21] He works in ways we cannot see.
[26:27] He will make a way for me. He will be my
[26:33] God.
[26:36] Hold me closely to his son. Can you put
[26:39] the voice up for me? with God and
[26:42] strength for this day.
[26:46] He will make a way.
[26:50] God will make a
[26:54] way.
[26:56] Oh my
[26:59] in the river.
[27:04] [Music]
[27:06] River in the desert will last
[27:11] sever.
[27:15] [Music]
[27:23] He will do something new today.
[27:32] God will make a way
[27:36] where he seems to be no way.
[27:40] He works in ways you cannot see.
[27:45] He will make a way for me.
[27:50] He will be my guide.
[27:54] Hold me closely to his side.
[27:58] With love and strength for each new day,
[28:03] he will make a way.
[28:06] [Music]
[28:08] God will make a way.
[28:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:16] And he'll make a way where there seems
[28:19] to be no way. We cannot see it, but he's
[28:23] going to make a way. Okay, please be
[28:25] seated.
[28:27] Um, pastor Danny couldn't make it today
[28:30] and he sent his greetings and uh, how
[28:34] many enjoy the word for Sunday?
[28:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah, we thank God for sending the
[28:39] brother in our way. Um,
[28:43] okay. So,
[28:46] can you please stand up again and let's
[28:49] pray and read the Bible? Sorry.
[28:54] Oh our heavenly most gracious eternal
[28:58] God and

[29:03] week people working and everything and
[29:06] we come here Lord only you that
[29:08] strengthen us and give us faith won't

[29:13] children Lord we're not here to see a
[29:17] man we are here to hear your voice
[29:21] take me aside side and help me get
[29:24] myself out of the way. Lord, if I've
[29:26] done anything wrong, please forgive me,
[29:28] Lord. I'm I'm nothing but you are God
[29:30] that controls everything.
[29:33] Close my mouth from saying it in contra.
[29:36] Help me, Lord. And help your children,
[29:39] Lord, that they won't leave you the
[29:41] same, Father. anything unlike the father
[29:43] we come against it during the day
[29:46] whatever that has gone through Lord um
[29:49] as we may made mistakes here and there
[29:51] but we here Lord that the blood of
[29:54] Christ cleanses us from all unbelief
[29:59] please come and visit us and come
[30:02] against anything like Christ in Jesus
[30:04] name amen
[30:06] I have
[30:08] two scriptures
[30:11] Um first one will be taken from Joshua 1
[30:15] verse 1-9
[30:17] and then the second one is from Matthew
[30:20] that's where my topic is
[30:25] okay
[30:28] in Joshua chapter one
[30:32] you see from the Bible here it's all
[30:35] over the place now that's fine
[30:39] sometime like to read from the Bible
[30:41] We're going to have it print out, but I
[30:43] like to read it from the Bible in Joshua
[30:46] 1 verse 1-9.
[30:49] Now, after the death of Moses, the
[30:51] servant of the Lord, it came to pass
[30:54] that the Lord spake unto Joshua, the son
[30:57] of Nan, Moses, my servant, is dead.
[31:03] Now therefore arise, go over this
[31:06] Jordan, thou and all these people on the
[31:09] land which I give to them, even to the
[31:12] children of Israel.
[31:16] Every place that the soul of your foot
[31:19] shall tread upon, that have I give it
[31:22] unto you, as I said unto Moses, from the
[31:26] wilderness,
[31:27] and this Lebanon, even unto the great
[31:30] river, the river Ephra, all the land of
[31:33] Hetes, and unto the great sea, toward
[31:36] the going down of the sun, shall be your
[31:39] coast. Amen. There shall not any man be
[31:44] able to stand before thee all the days
[31:46] of thy life.
[31:49] And you given us a promise.
[31:52] As I was with Moses, in other words, as
[31:54] I was with Abraham,
[31:57] &gt;&gt; I will be with thee.
[31:59] &gt;&gt; I will not fail thee.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; Not forsake thee.
[32:03] &gt;&gt; That's the promise they bride.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; Be strong
[32:08] and of a good courage. This is speaking
[32:12] to you, not anybody else. For unto these
[32:15] people that shalt thou deise for an
[32:18] inheritance of the land which I swear
[32:21] unto the fathers to give them. Holy be
[32:24] thou strong and very, he added, very
[32:29] courageous, that thou may observe to the
[32:33] to do according to all the law which
[32:35] Moses my servant
[32:38] commanded thee to turn not from it to
[32:40] the right hand or to the left that thou
[32:43] may what? Prosper whatsoever thou goest.
[32:48] As far as that you are courageous and
[32:51] you observe according to the law which
[32:52] Moses has done, you God is going to
[32:55] prosper you whatsoever things you do.
[32:58] This book of the law
[33:00] shall not depart out of thy mouth,
[33:04] but shall meditate
[33:07] therein day and night,
[33:11] &gt;&gt; that thou may observe to do according to
[33:13] all that is written therein. For then
[33:15] thou shall make thy way prosperous. It's
[33:19] emphas here. And then thou shall have
[33:21] good success. Have not I commanded thee?
[33:26] Be strong and of good courage.
[33:31] Be not afraid. It's fear that is more
[33:35] among the people now. But God is
[33:37] encouraging us. Be not afraid.
[33:43] Neither be thou dismayed. And I said,
[33:45] "Not worry, for the Lord thy God is with
[33:49] thee, whatsoever
[33:52] thou goest." Then Joshua commanded the
[33:55] officers of the people say, "Okay." um
[33:58] the next scripture that I'm going to
[34:00] dwell my subject on is Matthew 9:15
[34:04] to 17.
[34:06] And Jesus said unto them, "Can the
[34:09] children of the bride chamber mourn as
[34:13] long as the bridegroom is with them? But
[34:15] the days will come when the bridegroom
[34:18] shall be taken from them. Then they
[34:20] shall fast." If you read uh verse 14
[34:23] before that, it was the disciples of the
[34:27] John the Baptist came to ask him why his
[34:30] his disciples are not fasting. Okay,
[34:34] that's my grease. Put it on still.
[34:40] Then came to the of John the B. Okay,
[34:42] saying, "Why do we and Pharisees fast
[34:45] off, but thy disciples fast not?"
[34:51] Okay. Verse 16. No man putth a piece of
[34:55] new cloth onto an old garment. For that
[34:58] which is put in to fill it up, taketh
[35:01] room for the garment, and the rent is
[35:03] made waste.
[35:05] Neither do men put new wine into old
[35:07] bottles. Else the bottles break, and the
[35:11] wine runeth out, and the bottles perish,
[35:15] but they put new wine into new bottles,
[35:19] and both are preserved. Heavenly Father,
[35:22] may you please bless the region of the
[35:25] world and bless your children in Jesus
[35:29] name. Amen.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; Please be seated.
[35:37] Okay, if I will title it, I I will say
[35:42] you cannot mix
[35:45] uh law with grace
[35:49] or
[35:51] In other words, the past age, you cannot
[35:55] mix the past age with the present age.
[35:59] So, grace and law cannot exist together.
[36:03] And um Abraham
[36:06] elaborated here very well in parados
[36:12] verse paragraph 62-64.
[36:15] Now we find Joshua representing grace or
[36:19] some propiation that it could not exist
[36:22] in the same time that the law was
[36:26] existence.
[36:28] Neither does any message
[36:31] that forwards the people
[36:33] on ever coincide with past message.
[36:39] It will not do it.
[36:42] That's where we have trouble today.
[36:45] Jesus said, "Does any person take a new
[36:49] piece of garment and put it into an old
[36:54] or put the new wine into an old bottles?
[36:58] They perish. It burst them open. They
[37:03] can't stand it." And Joshua could not
[37:07] all become into his ministry until after
[37:09] Moses was gone. So you see the very
[37:12] first verse here, Moses, my servant is
[37:15] dead. Now arise and take this book to
[37:18] the promised land. Moses representing
[37:21] the law has served his time. The law has
[37:26] served its time. Amen. So in other
[37:29] words, as we read, you cannot
[37:34] h put a piece of garment into an old one
[37:39] or you cannot put a wine into an old
[37:42] bottles. A
[37:45] best.
[37:47] Amen. You cannot miss the ages of sword
[37:50] together.
[37:52] So um I'm just going to touch a little
[37:54] bit of natural point then I bring it
[37:56] back to the spiritual application.
[38:00] And the other time I was talking to my
[38:04] wife and I was telling her that
[38:07] in life
[38:09] the way our parents
[38:12] raises up
[38:14] we cannot apply this application how our
[38:18] parents raise us up to our children
[38:22] because it's a new age. It's a different
[38:26] atmosphere, different spirit, different
[38:29] everything. You try to bring that your
[38:33] the way your parents raise you up to
[38:35] apply for this age, you're going to
[38:37] crush the children and you can even what
[38:40] even lose them because we are in a
[38:43] generation that the people are weak and
[38:46] soft but increase in what wise in
[38:50] knowledge. So the way that the old time
[38:55] they raise the people and sometimes with
[38:59] the cane and all those kind of laws
[39:03] and it worked back then.
[39:06] But you take that same principle to
[39:09] apply it to our natural life, you're
[39:12] going to make a big big mess. You're
[39:16] going to get yourself in big trouble.
[39:20] And
[39:22] You cannot also
[39:26] solve today's problem
[39:30] basing it on the past problem. Like for
[39:34] instance, Abraham talk about countdown
[39:38] how that um
[39:42] first the gospel went with the
[39:46] innovations.
[39:48] How in the beginning they were using
[39:51] horse and boggy that time was Methodist.
[39:55] um
[39:57] yeah that was I think Hen Bogy was um
[40:02] was Luther
[40:04] then it goes on they move into cars
[40:08] Wesley and then automobile that's became
[40:11] more advanced then they came to airplane
[40:16] and now they go into the space
[40:18] &gt;&gt; so what the car or the if now you have
[40:22] to go and use a horse and buggy
[40:25] to drive on the high. People say you are
[40:26] crazy because it worked back then in the
[40:31] horse and boggy age. It was perfect. But
[40:34] you cannot transport it to present
[40:37] stage.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; That's why you have to know what God is
[40:42] doing in your time. The present stage of
[40:45] his ministry will meet present
[40:48] conditions.
[40:50] So you cannot carry that even the
[40:52] warfare.
[40:54] Remember that the
[41:00] the
[41:02] machines or the ammunitions that they
[41:05] used in the first and second world war
[41:07] you cannot take them and apply it here.
[41:11] It is a different age. You need a
[41:14] different condition. And I think that's
[41:16] why initially Russia was losing the war
[41:19] because they were using the the second
[41:21] world war armored car and everything. It
[41:25] was good for back then but here it's not
[41:27] good. Here this time they have a more
[41:30] precision weapons direct. It will come
[41:33] to your house with your name on it and
[41:35] take your head off.
[41:38] It's very precise.
[41:41] They have precise ammunition. They have
[41:43] drones. They have everything. So you
[41:47] cannot go and use that AK-47 and that
[41:51] thing to come and fight. Even if you
[41:53] look at the guy who unfortunately
[41:57] assassinated um Charlie K. He was so
[42:01] precise
[42:03] that that thing can go right and hit to
[42:06] kill him. So is the sons and daughters
[42:10] of God. Our sword has to be sharp.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; We have to short sharpen our sword which
[42:17] is the word of God to meet present
[42:19] conditions.
[42:21] The conditions that we did in the past
[42:24] it might not work this time. So it has
[42:27] to be more sharpened. Amen. No wonder
[42:30] that the scripture said that I wish a
[42:32] man pray always. before if you check
[42:37] those
[42:39] um Daniel and the rest
[42:42] they have a prayer time 3 91 12 whatever
[42:47] but you come to the New Testament Paul
[42:49] is saying that I wish a Christian pray
[42:52] always lifting up holy hands praising
[42:55] God not that you're going to be like
[42:58] always going to confine a place in other
[43:00] words he's trying to say that prayers is
[43:03] not confined find in a place.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; Before it was good. Those times before
[43:09] even the Holy Ghost were given they can
[43:11] be confined this that. But now we are in
[43:14] a new age. We are in a different times.
[43:18] The thing is different. So we have to be
[43:21] sharp and trust God for everything. So
[43:25] what is happening that you cannot
[43:28] bring past message to present tense
[43:33] &gt;&gt; is not going to work. There has to be a
[43:35] change. That's why the Bible took his
[43:38] time and said that Joshua
[43:41] Moses my servant is dead.
[43:46] It means that he's sleeping.
[43:49] Let my servant Moses have rest and
[43:53] sleep. He has done his part. But now the
[43:57] baton is in our hands.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. As I was with Moses, so I shall be
[44:03] with you.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; He's the same God that was in the
[44:07] prophet. Amen. Doing all those mighty
[44:10] works. But he's finished with the
[44:12] prophet. It's now the time of the bride.
[44:15] Remember
[44:16] the John the Baptist disciples
[44:20] they went to the Lord Jesus Christ and
[44:22] told him that why your disciples are not
[44:26] fasting. In other words, they were
[44:29] trying to take their doctrines the way
[44:32] John the Baptist was doing things and
[44:34] trying to push it to Jesus Christ to
[44:36] give it to his disciples. They said why
[44:40] we and the Pharisees we are fasting but
[44:43] your people are not fasting. He said
[44:45] that as far as the bridegroom with the
[44:48] chamber they don't do not fast but when
[44:50] he's taken out they will fast. In other
[44:52] words he was trying to tell them it
[44:54] wasn't time for that. And him being the
[44:57] Lord, he knows when the time comes. And
[45:02] those disciples are going to fast. They
[45:04] are going to fast with a revelation,
[45:08] with understanding. They won't just go
[45:10] and fast, fast, fast, fast like the
[45:12] Pentecost does. You have to fast with a
[45:16] revelation. God has to tell you to do
[45:19] it. And when he tells you and you are
[45:22] doing it, it's not going to be a hustle
[45:25] like some people like talk about they
[45:28] going to like um slamming cause they
[45:31] fast fast fast fast. But if you check in
[45:35] the Bible the scripture says that
[45:39] after the 40 years then Jesus what?
[45:42] Hunger. In other words, during all those
[45:46] 40 days, sorry, after 40 days, not 40
[45:48] years, forgive me. After 40 days, he
[45:51] hungered.
[45:53] So that means that be between the first
[45:56] day to 40 days, he wasn't hungry.
[46:00] A true fast, you are feasting with God.
[46:03] Maybe might be a little bit hungry here
[46:05] and there, but it shouldn't be something
[46:06] that is going to be too much like the
[46:08] Pentecostals does. And if you find
[46:12] yourself that you fasting and you
[46:14] feeling too hungry, then it's time for
[46:16] you to cut it off. Maybe God want you to
[46:19] cut it off. Amen. So anything that re
[46:23] without revelation is sin.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; And you cannot
[46:29] mix law with grace.
[46:32] And it's grace is what? Grace is
[46:36] unmmerited favor.
[46:39] So God has given us grace. You cannot
[46:42] bring the law to mess up with the grace.
[46:46] And that's what most people are doing.
[46:49] And they making the people's life
[46:51] miserable because they have put because
[46:55] somewhere here it says that the law make
[46:59] you a prison. Let me see if I can find
[47:01] it.
[47:07] Yeah. I said the law brings us to
[47:08] recognize we are wrong.
[47:11] But it's grace that forgive us. The law
[47:14] has no hope of redemption because to
[47:18] complete it, it has no grace in it
[47:22] because the law only points that you are
[47:24] a sinner.
[47:25] But grace tells you how to get out of
[47:29] it. Law is the policeman that puts you
[47:32] in jail. But redemption is the one who
[47:36] came paid your fine and out of and into
[47:40] the grace. So in other words, law will
[47:42] put you into what? Prison.
[47:46] So the people are not free.
[47:50] They are obeying the law
[47:53] in prison. In other words, they are not
[47:55] free. They think they serving God by
[47:59] obeying those laws. without obeying the
[48:02] Lord. They don't feel confidence. They
[48:04] think that something is wrong. But the
[48:06] hour has come that the true worshippers
[48:10] will worship God in truth and in spirit.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. That means that by revelation of
[48:16] the word of God.
[48:18] No wonder Abraham said that even if I
[48:20] tell you not to wear pants and you just
[48:23] go and stop wearing pants because I have
[48:28] told you it will not do you no good
[48:31] because you have to understand why you
[48:34] are not wearing those pants. You have to
[48:37] have a revelation why you are not doing
[48:39] that. You can't go to a place say why
[48:42] you not wearing pants. My church say you
[48:44] don't wear pants. That means don't know
[48:46] what you are doing. You yourself have to
[48:49] understand why you are not wearing that
[48:51] earring. You have to have a revelation.
[48:54] It brings me back when myself and braofi
[49:00] about maybe 10 years back a friend of
[49:03] mine that I witnessed to in England.
[49:07] um his uncle saw that there's been a
[49:11] change in that person's life and then
[49:15] his uncle lives in New York, he lives in
[49:18] England. His uncle lives in Virginia, he
[49:21] lives in England and then his uncle said
[49:25] that Ben, how come you changed like
[49:27] that? You were not like that before.
[49:31] And he said that a friend of mine in
[49:33] Canada has told me about the Lord Jesus
[49:35] Christ. I have been baptized in his name
[49:38] and God is taking care of my life. And
[49:40] then he said I want that portion. So he
[49:43] spoke to me and then I said I don't have
[49:47] to talk to him on phone because Virginia
[49:49] is not far from here. It's very close.
[49:52] So we can just go ourselves. to our told
[49:54] Kofi and myself and Kofi, we rented our
[49:58] car, we rented hotel, everything off to
[50:03] Virginia.
[50:04] When we went
[50:08] the man, his wife
[50:11] worked in pharmaceutical and a pharmacy,
[50:15] but the kind of pharmacy job she does,
[50:19] she is a research in pharmaceutical
[50:22] companies. So she goes to China all over
[50:26] the place and she could even be a senate
[50:30] be a senate in US. So she was big up
[50:33] there. We didn't know nothing about it.
[50:37] So we began to tell them by the word of
[50:39] God. I started I spoke and Kofu also
[50:42] came and began to speak. Whilst he was
[50:45] speaking, he told the lady
[50:48] that we are not telling you not to wear
[50:50] an earring,
[50:53] but the Bible said you don't have to
[50:54] wear it. But not but I'm just letting
[50:57] you know because in the old times when
[51:02] somebody is a slave and after 50 years
[51:05] he chose to be a slave they put things
[51:08] in his year and then she become a slave
[51:11] to his master for the rest of her of his
[51:13] life. So it signified that and then in
[51:16] the paris it was sign of homosexual when
[51:18] they were in the ship. So we told her
[51:21] that and the lady said, "Oh man, I
[51:25] believe everything you guys have told me
[51:27] from the beginning. Everything is
[51:29] perfect, but this word you telling me is
[51:31] not true. I'll never believe it. It's
[51:34] wrong. You guys are trying to push them
[51:36] on me." And you said, "Sister, we are
[51:39] not here to challenge you. And we are
[51:42] not here to tell you not wear an earring
[51:45] because even if you take it, it's not
[51:47] going to do no good. You are a standard
[51:49] to begin with and even if come to church
[51:52] you are we will expect you to wear it
[51:55] until God speak to your heart. So we cut
[51:57] off the conversation
[51:59] and then they made a coffee for us like
[52:03] on this table like that. We were about
[52:06] 12:00 we were about to go back to our
[52:09] hotel. So they make that h coffee and
[52:13] tea for us. Whilst we were drinking the
[52:16] tea like me and Kofi was here on the
[52:19] table the lady was sitting something
[52:20] like that all that we hear he scream
[52:24] with a loud voice and take that thing
[52:28] not and she said now that I'm free why
[52:32] because she challenged the word of God
[52:35] and God has to come down and prove to
[52:37] her that what we are saying was truth if
[52:41] she doesn't take it all year was like a
[52:43] fire in in a year ring she just take it
[52:46] out. So but what we are trying to say is
[52:48] that anything without revelation is sin.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; And you explained to the lady and later
[52:56] she said that man whatever you guys have
[52:59] told me is the absolute truth and the
[53:03] prophet that we talking about people
[53:05] said they are prophet but she stayed
[53:09] there all night and she said that she
[53:12] came with his gate. He was born with a
[53:16] prophet.
[53:18] That's why he from her own mouth. He
[53:21] said we brother Abraham is born with
[53:24] that gift. Not just a normal prophet
[53:28] that is saying out over there. This a
[53:30] true prophet of God. Why God
[53:33] demonstrated to her that he is the same
[53:36] yesterday, today, and forever.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; Because he's a God that if you challenge
[53:42] him, he will show up. Amen.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are not serving a God on the
[53:46] wall.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; We are serving a living God.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; And he's the same yesterday, today, and
[53:52] forever.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; He never lose a battle.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. God loves all challenges. He will
[53:59] show up.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; He is God that never change.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; He's the physician that never lost um
[54:08] lost a patient.
[54:10] And he's the same yesterday, today, and
[54:13] forever.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; So our God is an awesome God.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So what am I trying to say?
[54:23] It is a different age.
[54:27] Luther,
[54:29] Methodist, Pentecost,
[54:32] and then now the age is changed.
[54:38] We living in that age is eternal church
[54:40] age which is the eighth day. Amen. We
[54:43] are no more in the seventh age again.
[54:47] Yes, physically we are in the licia but
[54:50] our soul has been transported to the
[54:55] eighth day the eternal church age. Amen.
[54:59] That's where we are now. Hallelujah. Now
[55:03] he said we approaching the seven se. You
[55:06] have just put the start of the perfect
[55:08] man. You have just finished the seven
[55:10] church ages and this a message on
[55:13] teaching that ties the man in that is
[55:16] going to be redeemed by the blood of the
[55:19] Lord Jesus Christ and is going to be in
[55:21] that church age that eternal church age
[55:25] at the end of the seals. Amen. So we
[55:30] have moved
[55:32] physically we are in the seventh church
[55:34] Jerusalem Lucia but we have moved to the
[55:37] eighth day. Amen. The e day also have a
[55:40] messenger that is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[55:43] So God is telling us now that he's in
[55:46] control.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; So we have to rest on his word. This is
[55:50] no time of working for your own or
[55:54] trying to base it on law or west. It's a
[55:58] resting time.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; He wants us to rest and then he takes
[56:02] control. That's why the Bible said that
[56:04] come unto me all ye that is heavy laden
[56:08] and I will give what? Rest unto your
[56:11] soul. Amen. The time that the bride of
[56:14] Christ is resting on that said the Lord.
[56:18] He's resting on the word of God. Because
[56:21] listen,
[56:23] the
[56:26] Satan's attack has increased.
[56:30] Is that right? So, we all know that the
[56:34] prophet said that there are over 2
[56:37] million demons,
[56:40] 200 millions were demons re um
[56:44] released in the river Eupher.
[56:48] So you cannot
[56:51] approach this year, no this age that we
[56:54] are living in with a past age anointing.
[56:58] It will not work. You need God himself
[57:03] &gt;&gt; to tabernacle in your heart
[57:05] &gt;&gt; to fight your battles because he said
[57:07] that you are the temple of God
[57:10] &gt;&gt; and the spirit of God dwells in you and
[57:14] in me. He said, "I have it. The most
[57:17] high does not dwell in a house made of
[57:19] hands.
[57:21] Heaven is my throne and earth is my
[57:23] foottool. What house will you build me?"
[57:26] You are the house of God. It's now that
[57:28] you are sons and daughters of God. Now
[57:31] you are going to be you are. So he's
[57:35] giving you the assurance, giving you the
[57:37] power. He's given the authority.
[57:39] Everything that you have need of to make
[57:43] up the journey is in you right now.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; It's you have to activate it.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; It's not anybody. I I nobody can give to
[57:52] nobody. That thing is in you. You got to
[57:56] recognize who you are.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; That you are a son of God.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; That God who created the whole universe,
[58:05] he dwells in you. Amen.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; You are the tabernacle
[58:10] &gt;&gt; that God dwells in now.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And listen, what the world is
[58:16] looking for is not just words. They want
[58:19] a reality.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; They want to see people who come with
[58:23] the reality of the word of God.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; That they have been with Jesus.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; That they want to see reflection of
[58:30] Christ in our lives
[58:32] &gt;&gt; because they are fed up with the words.
[58:35] The west alone cannot do it. It has to
[58:38] take the revelation of the word. It has
[58:41] to take the manifestation of the word of
[58:43] God in our lives. Is the life behind the
[58:47] name that demons fear and tremble.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. So whatever that you said that you
[58:53] have, it has to put on display
[58:56] &gt;&gt; because he's the same yesterday, today,
[58:59] and forever. If you say you have met
[59:01] him, then your life has to prove it.
[59:05] People wants to see the hands of God in
[59:09] your life. And when they see God in your
[59:12] life like that, then they will cry for
[59:14] that God that you have.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; That's what the world needs
[59:18] &gt;&gt; to see the manifestation of the Holy
[59:21] Ghost in our lives. And then they will
[59:24] recognize as they told Peter and John
[59:27] that these people are ignorant unlearned
[59:32] but they have been with what? Jesus.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; That makes the deal.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; That's what it has to show. There's a
[59:41] time if all that we have need of is in
[59:45] us then is the time we have to take up
[59:49] that sword and cut off the Amalachi's
[59:51] head
[59:52] &gt;&gt; with the word of God. Don't be shining
[59:54] as pastor someone preached long time.
[59:56] Don't be shining on the sword and keep
[59:58] it up and always shine it. No, you got
[1:00:01] to take that sword and cut Amalachi's
[1:00:04] head off. Yes,
[1:00:07] sometimes going to get bruised. you're
[1:00:10] going to get hurt.
[1:00:12] But remember, greater is he that is in
[1:00:14] you than he that's in the world.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Abraham gave an example, one of the
[1:00:19] kings in um
[1:00:22] Rome, I forgot the name, I think Caesar
[1:00:24] or something. He said one time he wanted
[1:00:28] to in greatest battle ever fought, he
[1:00:30] wanted to honor his soldiers and most of
[1:00:33] them came with their shining sword and
[1:00:37] dressed up nice and battalion. They walk
[1:00:39] like that. They matching and they have
[1:00:42] everything. He saw one of them right at
[1:00:45] the corner there bruised with a hurt all
[1:00:48] over him. And he said, "Hey, where did
[1:00:50] you get this wound from?" He said, "I
[1:00:52] got on the battle." He said, "This is
[1:00:54] the man that I want." He took him and
[1:00:56] ride with that man because he has been a
[1:00:59] battlefield. Amen. So God wants people
[1:01:02] who are in battlefield who are fighting
[1:01:05] on the word stand on the word of God and
[1:01:08] doing damage to Satan's kingdom. We
[1:01:11] cannot come and listen the word go home
[1:01:13] listen go home listen go home and be fed
[1:01:16] so much as Peter said that we are so
[1:01:19] much overfed.
[1:01:20] Amen. And we become like that. We have
[1:01:24] to exercise the word of God. Exercise
[1:01:27] that work of God that God has given to
[1:01:29] us. Put it into practice.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Don't just only come and eat and eat and
[1:01:34] eat and become like that and then you
[1:01:37] don't exercise, you don't do nothing.
[1:01:39] Use it to work.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you are the son and
[1:01:43] daughter of God. The whole heaven is
[1:01:45] waiting on earth.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; You are the best. I was talking to a
[1:01:49] brother yesterday that God reserved the
[1:01:51] best for us.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. You look into it. All the great
[1:01:56] prophet Isaiah, Jeremiah, Jacob, Peter,
[1:02:00] John and even our men our prophet of God
[1:02:04] they are all resting and they are what?
[1:02:06] Waiting on us.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; It means that we don't look ourselves
[1:02:11] that we are something. We are nobody but
[1:02:15] somebody is in us and that somebody who
[1:02:18] is the Lord Jesus Christ have made us
[1:02:20] somebody. Amen. the whole of them they
[1:02:23] are waiting on us.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; It's time we have to pick up the salt.
[1:02:27] It's time we have to witness. It's time
[1:02:30] we have to do the best that we can to
[1:02:32] bring the last one in so that we can go
[1:02:35] because I'm fed up in this world.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; This world is not my home.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm just a pilgrim. I'm just
[1:02:43] passing through. If heaven is not my
[1:02:45] home, then Lord, what should I do? Amen.
[1:02:48] No wonder Abraham and the rest they seek
[1:02:50] a city to come. Amen.
[1:02:54] There's a corrupt the sin. Everything is
[1:02:56] so corrupt. Amen. That sometimes you
[1:03:00] can't even stand it.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; But if you can't stand it and I'm not
[1:03:05] saying that we are um trying to escape
[1:03:10] from this world that we are miserable
[1:03:12] people. No, God has blessed us
[1:03:17] abundantly, both natural, spiritual,
[1:03:19] everything. But still, we are fed up
[1:03:22] with this world and the things going on
[1:03:24] here. It's time to go home to a heavenly
[1:03:27] king, a heavenly kingdom where there's
[1:03:29] no pain, where there's no kiss, where
[1:03:32] there's no gray hair. Somebody was
[1:03:33] saying that when you know you for a long
[1:03:35] time, you have a nice black hair. All
[1:03:37] this, why is it black hair? Gray hair
[1:03:38] all over the place. You are here today,
[1:03:40] you gone tomorrow. By the time you wake
[1:03:43] up, you just check the timings going
[1:03:45] just like that. 40 hit you 30 50 that
[1:03:49] you going. Amen. And then you take the
[1:03:52] place of your parents,
[1:03:54] they become an opera.
[1:03:57] Amen. And you look at my goodness, I can
[1:04:00] remember everything. So what I'm trying
[1:04:02] to say that once we have an opportunity,
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; once we have our health, once we have
[1:04:09] everything, let's give our all to Jesus
[1:04:12] Christ.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Let's surrender all to him.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; So that he when he needs to use us, we
[1:04:20] are be ready to be used.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. All that the scripture is, we have
[1:04:24] to be ready. Amen.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; So when you are ready, when the Lord
[1:04:29] needs to use you, he's going to use you
[1:04:31] at the right time. It doesn't become a
[1:04:33] competition because it's him doing it
[1:04:36] and he knows that you are ready for the
[1:04:37] battle. So he will come and anoint you
[1:04:40] to do what he has to do. Amen. So it's
[1:04:43] time we take our sword. It's time we do
[1:04:47] all that we can for the kingdom of God.
[1:04:50] Because listen, without you and me, the
[1:04:53] last one is not coming.
[1:04:57] If you know you cannot go, send
[1:05:00] somebody.
[1:05:03] Send money to v missions.
[1:05:05] Amen. Or when they when we go on the D
[1:05:09] side, it will be your sweat of your
[1:05:12] money that bring the person in. You pray
[1:05:15] for those on the mission side because
[1:05:17] listen, the bra ministry all the time
[1:05:20] they have a prayer meeting. People
[1:05:23] always praying for the service.
[1:05:27] You say brother Phillip I cannot
[1:05:29] witness. I cannot do that. At least you
[1:05:31] can pray.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; You can pray every time for the service.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; If you want to see God, if you want God
[1:05:39] to manifest and take the gifts that he
[1:05:42] has given us aside and use them and move
[1:05:47] mighty, we have to also do our part.
[1:05:50] Amen.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; By praying for the service.
[1:05:53] Amen. Remember in the time of Solomon,
[1:05:57] they prayed and the presence of God was
[1:05:59] so much that the place became smokey
[1:06:02] that they could not even what minister
[1:06:05] anymore. And God is more than able to
[1:06:09] repeat those things again
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; because it's the same yesterday, today,
[1:06:13] and forever. It's up to us what do you
[1:06:17] want? If you desire him, he going to
[1:06:20] come. He'll show himself
[1:06:23] once your heart is clean and your motive
[1:06:25] is right. It's not for something that
[1:06:28] you want to achieve to be puffed up or
[1:06:31] to lift yourself up. But the more that
[1:06:35] God use you, the more you even humble
[1:06:37] yourself because you realize that you
[1:06:40] have nothing to do with it.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; It's him that doing it.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; It's him in control.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. It bring you rest.
[1:06:51] It doesn't bring competition.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; It bring you rest because you know it's
[1:06:56] God doing it. Amen. It's not by power or
[1:07:00] by might but by my spirit says the Lord.
[1:07:04] Amen. It's God's spirit. We are feeding
[1:07:07] on unfailing reality of the living God.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our God is good.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:07:16] forever.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Let's give God an
[1:07:21] applause.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:07:26] Amen.
[1:07:28] Hallelujah.
[1:07:30] Praise God. Thank you, Lord.
[1:07:35] Amen.
[1:07:37] Our God is good.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And
[1:07:42] one other thing
[1:07:47] that
[1:07:49] um
[1:07:51] one other thing
[1:07:54] you see when we read in Joshua
[1:07:57] it says that every place that you put
[1:08:01] your feet that place is given to you.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; So it means that footstep means
[1:08:07] possession.
[1:08:09] You got to make a move. You have to
[1:08:12] what? Put your foot forward and do
[1:08:15] something because an idle hands God will
[1:08:18] not use it. He said the hands that does
[1:08:20] not work that hands should not even eat.
[1:08:25] But we talking of he said Phillip you
[1:08:27] talking about grace grace grace grace
[1:08:31] grace. So if the grace of God what do we
[1:08:35] have to do? You have something to do.
[1:08:38] You have a part to do too. Grace, can
[1:08:41] you please put on this paragraph 73 to
[1:08:44] 75 for me in the um in the paradox?
[1:08:59] Yeah. He said, "And they if they are
[1:09:03] ready, I can't get h I can't get enough
[1:09:07] of this. I really I know I came across
[1:09:10] it and I fall in love with it and they
[1:09:15] if they would have continued on the
[1:09:19] promise wasn't given to them under the
[1:09:23] law.
[1:09:25] The promise was given before the law
[1:09:30] without any condition to it.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because remember when he came to
[1:09:35] Abraham it's not what you have done. God
[1:09:39] said I there was no condition. He told
[1:09:43] Adam if you do this if you do not do
[1:09:45] that. But Abraham God did not give me
[1:09:48] any condition. So when it come to
[1:09:51] Abraham the seed of Abraham it gave them
[1:09:54] without any conditions to it. I have
[1:09:57] given you this land go on over onto it.
[1:10:02] But before they got to the promise, they
[1:10:05] decided there was something they must do
[1:10:10] themselves.
[1:10:12] That's the problem. Every time we want
[1:10:15] to put our hands to touch it to make
[1:10:19] sure that we're doing something. Verse
[1:10:20] 74.
[1:10:23] And that we still find that among human
[1:10:27] beings
[1:10:29] we prone to be that way. There is
[1:10:32] something we got to do. We feel that we
[1:10:39] got to have something into it also.
[1:10:43] Yes,
[1:10:45] you do have something into it.
[1:10:48] That is your surrender of your own will.
[1:10:54] That's the part we have to do. Your own
[1:10:58] ideas
[1:11:00] to the will and idea of almighty God and
[1:11:05] is finished.
[1:11:07] That's all there is. Just like he is
[1:11:11] promised. Don't think of nothing else.
[1:11:15] walk by it and God does the rest. So we
[1:11:20] have a part to do.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Our part is to surrender our will to his
[1:11:26] will. No one said my ways are higher
[1:11:30] than your ways and my thoughts are
[1:11:32] higher than your thoughts as heaven is
[1:11:34] higher than so. My thoughts and my ways
[1:11:38] are higher than your ways. So we have to
[1:11:42] get to that place that we surrender our
[1:11:45] own will to the will of God. And what is
[1:11:49] the will of God is a re is the word of
[1:11:51] God is a revelation part of the word of
[1:11:55] God. Even the Lord says by when he was
[1:11:57] here
[1:11:59] in the
[1:12:01] Gethsemane,
[1:12:02] the Bible said that he prayed earnestly
[1:12:06] that even his sweat became blood
[1:12:11] and in the end he said, "Lord,
[1:12:14] not my will, let thy will be done."
[1:12:19] How many of us are willing tonight to
[1:12:23] die to our own ideas and ask God that
[1:12:27] his perfect will be done in everything
[1:12:32] that we do because we don't want our own
[1:12:35] ways. We want God ways to be our way.
[1:12:38] Even though the road may be rough and
[1:12:41] steep, but when he leads you, that is
[1:12:44] enough. Amen. So I want God's way to be
[1:12:49] my way is his way is perfect.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. But so many times we try to add
[1:12:58] our own thoughts, our own ideas, mess it
[1:13:02] up with the word of God and come with
[1:13:05] traditions and cultures, missing all of
[1:13:08] them in the word of God. God want to get
[1:13:11] rid of all those cultures and traditions
[1:13:14] and everything and have that pure word
[1:13:17] of God in our heart and relax on that so
[1:13:22] that his perfect will will be done in
[1:13:25] our lives because so many times we are
[1:13:28] full of it our own race our own thing
[1:13:32] David one time try to just
[1:13:38] that's why the Bible said that Let her
[1:13:40] kill it. But the spirit that giveth life
[1:13:44] because in those times when David got
[1:13:47] the um anointing to bring the ark, yes,
[1:13:51] it was the word of God. Yes, it was the
[1:13:53] word of God that the ark has to come
[1:13:55] back to Israel. But he failed to contact
[1:13:59] what the high priest, the those areas.
[1:14:02] He just contact his generals and he did
[1:14:05] it and two people died of it.
[1:14:08] That wasn't God's perfect will.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; And as a Christians, we don't want God's
[1:14:13] permissive role because he gave his
[1:14:16] permissive role to Balam.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; And Bam was so full of it that when even
[1:14:23] his donkey was talking to him, he didn't
[1:14:26] even see that it was God speaking
[1:14:29] through that donkey. Amen. So we don't
[1:14:33] want to get to a place that
[1:14:37] we get so much um I don't know what word
[1:14:40] to use but we get so much um sidetrack
[1:14:46] or what consumed with our own ideas that
[1:14:50] we broke everything out.
[1:14:52] Let us be open
[1:14:55] and let us see what God will have us to
[1:14:58] do with it. What is perfect will for us?
[1:15:02] Because without God's perfect willful,
[1:15:04] we're gonna make break mistake. We have
[1:15:06] made mistakes in the past, we still
[1:15:09] going to make mistakes. But it's time as
[1:15:12] sons and daughters of God to sit down
[1:15:15] and make sure that in all our decisions,
[1:15:18] we include God in it
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; and look for his perfect will. Because
[1:15:25] sometimes
[1:15:27] uh even myself made me say we prone to
[1:15:30] listen to man so much sometimes. It
[1:15:33] doesn't matter how high the person in
[1:15:35] checking with the word. Check your heart
[1:15:38] what God is telling you what your heart
[1:15:40] feels what God is revealing to you about
[1:15:43] the situation and check it in the word
[1:15:46] of God
[1:15:48] and let God's perfect will be done. If
[1:15:51] David would have consulted
[1:15:54] the high priest, those two people would
[1:15:58] not have lost their life.
[1:16:01] So in everything, check it back. Even in
[1:16:05] the church when you got a revelation,
[1:16:08] God has given us a pastor.
[1:16:11] Check it back and see if it's line up
[1:16:13] with his vision.
[1:16:15] Because if somewhere said that you
[1:16:18] cannot go higher than your pastor. So
[1:16:21] you have a revelation something to do
[1:16:23] with the church don't just run it off
[1:16:25] with your friends or your brothers and
[1:16:27] act on it. Always run it through him
[1:16:30] through your deacons everything and
[1:16:32] check it up. Then God will confirm
[1:16:34] because he has given those officers to
[1:16:37] you.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you respect them and you obey
[1:16:41] them and you believe that God is hiding
[1:16:43] there, God can use those offices to help
[1:16:46] you.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; But if you think that you know more than
[1:16:50] that,
[1:16:51] just like um
[1:16:55] brother Des said last week, what's his
[1:16:57] name? um
[1:17:00] uh
[1:17:01] in Moses time
[1:17:05] um in Moses Korea in Dayton they think
[1:17:10] they know more than Moses because why
[1:17:14] one time Moses father-in-law visited him
[1:17:19] and he saw that there was so much load
[1:17:21] on Moses he said I take your anointing
[1:17:24] and let it go on the 70 elders and God
[1:17:27] gave them that spirit on them and when
[1:17:30] God began to deal with them, they forgot
[1:17:33] that it was through Moses that God gave
[1:17:36] them the anointing. So he think that
[1:17:38] they are powerful. They more than they
[1:17:40] know more than Moses. And what happened?
[1:17:43] God has to open the door and swallow all
[1:17:45] of them.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; So if you are a member of the church,
[1:17:49] don't think you know more than your
[1:17:50] pastor. If you know more than him, God
[1:17:52] will have made you that pastor.
[1:17:55] So let's just rally behind him and do
[1:17:58] not cause any confusion.
[1:18:01] Rally your revelation in line with his
[1:18:05] thought so that we all going to be in
[1:18:08] harmony and have things going on because
[1:18:12] there is no time to waste. All the
[1:18:16] scriptures, everything
[1:18:19] that has to fulfill
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; for us to go home has all been
[1:18:24] fulfilled.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; There's nothing left by the coming of
[1:18:28] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; And we are going to take up the rapture.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are in the process leading to
[1:18:37] an event.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Everything points to that.
[1:18:42] The whole world were framed by the word
[1:18:45] of God and that is holding the whole
[1:18:47] world. But now the whole world, the
[1:18:51] third world, all those things are not
[1:18:54] happening because you and me are here.
[1:18:57] Amen. He's the same yesterday, today,
[1:19:00] and forever.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; And back to when the Lord Jesus, the
[1:19:06] Bible said that he prayed earnestly.
[1:19:09] And if he prayed earnestly, what about
[1:19:13] you and me?
[1:19:15] We need to pray sincerely. We need to
[1:19:19] pray earnestly. We need to be serious
[1:19:21] with our prayer life. Amen. No wonder
[1:19:25] the Bible said that Elijah was a man
[1:19:29] subject to like passion like you and me.
[1:19:34] and he prayed earnestly that it should
[1:19:37] not rain for three and a half years and
[1:19:39] it never rain. So in other words, God is
[1:19:43] trying to tell us if we have the same
[1:19:47] faith and believe and we pray sincerely,
[1:19:51] there's nothing that God is going to
[1:19:53] withhold us. Somewhere it said that
[1:19:56] there's no good thing that God would
[1:19:59] withhold from those that walk what?
[1:20:02] Righteously before him, he will never
[1:20:05] withhold any good thing from you.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Just cheer up and relax. All is well.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; All is well.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; All is well.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. The woman his daughter was even
[1:20:19] dead. She never considered that. Amen.
[1:20:22] The prophet asked him her, "Is anything
[1:20:25] everything well with ye?" "Yes." "With
[1:20:28] your son?" "Yes." "All is well." That's
[1:20:32] the faith that we have to have. No
[1:20:34] matter what condition we go through, no
[1:20:36] matter what happens, have confidence
[1:20:39] that all is well.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; As we rest, said that I will never
[1:20:42] forsake thee, nor leave thee. I'll be
[1:20:45] with you even in you. Amen. And the
[1:20:48] Bible said that
[1:20:50] all that was in Christ, all that was in
[1:20:53] God, he poured into what? Christ. And
[1:20:57] all that was in Christ, he poured into
[1:20:59] what? his church that is you and me his
[1:21:03] bride.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. So all the heaven everything is
[1:21:08] inside of you. It's you have to activate
[1:21:11] that gift. It's you that have to bring
[1:21:14] it to pass. It's your part
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; to bring it to pass. Pray, seek God, do
[1:21:20] all your part. Don't be scared.
[1:21:23] And one time in Brabraham ministry, he
[1:21:28] was saying that um a missionary was
[1:21:32] going somewhere
[1:21:34] and they told him that oh that place you
[1:21:38] go in there this I forgot the exact word
[1:21:41] they used. In other words, there was
[1:21:43] like mosquitoes or some bad animals that
[1:21:46] going to harm the man. And the man said
[1:21:49] that if God is sending me then that
[1:21:53] place is the best place for me to be.
[1:21:55] Amen. So what am I saying? If God is
[1:21:58] leading you to where it doesn't matter
[1:22:00] what the situation is the best place for
[1:22:02] you. I believe that because God was for
[1:22:06] Daniel. Lion's den was the best place
[1:22:09] for them to be at that time. The lion
[1:22:12] could not do nothing to because God was
[1:22:14] behind Daniel.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. The E Hebrew children, they were
[1:22:19] in the fiery furnace
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; because that was the best place for them
[1:22:23] to be at that time.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Even the people who were trying to put
[1:22:28] them in that fire, they killed some of
[1:22:30] them. Amen. But God, the son of man, the
[1:22:34] false man was in the fire.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if God is with you wherever you
[1:22:40] are, you don't have to be afraid. No
[1:22:43] matter if they said cover I remember
[1:22:45] when the co came. Sorry when the cover
[1:22:49] came
[1:22:51] in it
[1:22:58] in its fierest time when people were
[1:23:01] scared to go anywhere the Lord put in
[1:23:05] brother desper myself to go to Jamaica.
[1:23:08] We were not scared about the co because
[1:23:12] that was the best place for us to be at
[1:23:13] that time and people were even shocked.
[1:23:17] Why are you guys going there? Because
[1:23:19] God sent us there. Amen. He was with us.
[1:23:23] Even though everybody was scared,
[1:23:28] but because
[1:23:30] God sent us to that place, it was the
[1:23:34] best place for us to be.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. So wherever God is sending you, no
[1:23:40] matter what the circumstances, no matter
[1:23:42] what the obstacles, no matter how it
[1:23:46] seems bad the situation is is the best
[1:23:48] place for you to be there because God
[1:23:50] will be there at that time to help you.
[1:23:52] Musicians, can you prepare to come?
[1:23:54] Amen. He's on time. God,
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. He will not be there. He'll be
[1:23:59] there right on time. He may not come
[1:24:01] when you want him to, but he'll be there
[1:24:03] right on time. He's the same yesterday
[1:24:06] to them forever. Ah, God is awesome.
[1:24:09] Amen. Hallelujah. No matter what. Amen.
[1:24:12] I want God's way to be by way.
[1:24:14] Hallelujah.
