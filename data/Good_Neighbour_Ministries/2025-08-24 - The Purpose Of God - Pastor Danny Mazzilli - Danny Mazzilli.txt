It's good to see each and every one of you. We certainly appreciate having had the time. You may be seated for a moment. God bless you, saints. Thank you, musicians. Praise God. We certainly appreciated our time of rest. We want to thank God for his goodness. Amen. For allowing us this time. I'm just plugging in here because the charger. Just need the charger here. Praise God. Still not showing. Amen. Praise God. Well, we'll leave it. I'm sure we'll be fine. So, how many likes the new wall? &gt;&gt; We want to thank God for uh for having it done so quickly. Um, brother Alvin uh was able to bring his brother-in-law, Das, and one of his technicians, Nazil, to come and um get this wall done in two miraculous days. Amen. Two days. They put it all together. And um and then we want to thank God for um for the uh East Porters AV uh company here in Burlington. they were able to uh install our new projection system. As you can see, it is pretty much like a 4K quality. Okay. And understand that you know what it is, whatever we're projecting, the quality of, you know, the imaging that we're projecting, that's what the projector will project. So, you know, if we're still using some older technology in any way, shape, or form, then it's going to reflect, you know, in the way that it actually shows. But you can see, you know, even seated right at the very back that it is very clear and um much clearer. You can read everything much clearer. And I trust that um as we move forward, it'll be tweaked and and enhanced even more and you know allow us to uh uh you know improve. Everything is in a in a um transition. The sanctuary is still going to, you know, get some new lighting, some, you know, we're gonna have a cross going over here. Uh, you know, there's going to be more um that's going to just create the atmosphere that we want in the um in the actual physical um sanctuary. We know that the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost is uh what we come to really uh feed upon and to uh add to because we're each and every one licks a fire that have an anointing and a and an expectation and a purpose that's built and designed into our lives to come and worship the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And so we certainly um look forward to this just as the transition uh comes along and matures, we continue to grow and mature into what God wants to do in each and every one of our lives. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And so um just a couple of quick announcements. You can go to the next slide. um GN Youth Ministry uh youth camp Friday, August the 29th. That's next weekend. How many's aware of that? &gt;&gt; Special services. Amen. We have a lot of people that are going to be joining us. Okay. I've been hearing from ministers and and uh so there's there's going to be um there's going to be uh uh a pull. I believe that the Lord is already pulling on the hearts of the people. You know, I reached out to one minister that I, you know, thought, "Oh, I got to reach out to him yesterday." And I I reached out. He said, "Oh, brother, I've got plans. We're going to be there. We we we heard about it weeks ago." I said, "Praise God. Wonderful." And so, I'm just I'm very grateful that um you know, for it's got to be 27 or 28 years. I I keep forgetting, you know, how many years in a row that we've been running this um this youth ministry. But um you know every year the Lord has always been good to us &gt;&gt; and um you you can see that it's not something that yeah we do our part and God wants us to step out and throw up the rock and and get things in motion and invite the minister and you know be led and be in prayer about it and everything else. But then it still takes him to come and cap it off and and do a a a great work and set captives free and liberate our young people and and uh you know and and you got to understand that that this has been evolving over the years. This has been evolving in in the level of maturity um and the season and what it is that God is wanting to do in our young people. Amen. And so, you know, every year we always have a theme. And, you know, this week it started to come upon me. And the and the thing that the Lord brought to my heart was preserving the word. And how is it that we're going to preserve the word? It needs to be brought and taught to the young people. It needs to be preached to the young people. the same word, not a different word, but a word that that is the that that is the same yesterday, today, and forever, but in season to meet the needs of the current uh sons and daughters of God that are that, you know, attributes of God that are locked up in young bodies that need to be awakened to their true purpose and understanding. So, so we're looking this week and even this sermon today, you know, they they were on my mind. They were in my heart, the young people. And and um you know, uh I'm trusting that this is going to be like a like a you know, uh um you know, like you know, the the the jumping board to starting things, you know, like you dive into it and uh you know, you got to start somewhere. And I trust that this service today somehow will speak to the hearts of our young people, those that are present and those that are online and and uh you know there's no old people when in the Lord. You know that, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. So don't be thinking, you know, when I say young people, I'm discounting you that have been you know that you're in your 50s, 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, whatever. The word is still the same word &gt;&gt; and it's doing the same thing. It's calling sons and daughters of God into their purpose, into their placing in the word of God. Amen. That's what we're going to be looking at today as we as we we look into the word of God. Amen. And so, we're excited about what the Lord is going to do for our young people. We're looking forward to it. I'm asking you to pray, fast, believe for these meetings this weekend that the Lord will will do a mighty work and and show that truly he's interested in preserving his word and bringing it to life even into the youngest that are amongst us. Amen. Praise God. Because he's God. He can do that. Amen. Praise the Lord. Next slide. I want to let you know that this Wednesday's service is going to be cancelled in preparation for these meetings so that you know people can focus um direct their thoughts, their their positions because every single one of us that are members of Good Neighbor Ministries are on call for this weekend to stand in their post of duty and in their voluntary post of duty. Wherever the Lord has shown you to go and take your position in order to to fulfill God's purpose and desire for these meetings this weekend, I'm trusting that every single one of you are ready and willing and allowing. And if you do that, you will see God move in miraculous ways in your life this week and into the weekend. I promise you. All you need to do get into the channel where God wants you to be. Watch out. You'll see things have to move. Everything has to come into position so that you can fulfill your purpose. Praise God. That's what we're that's the that's how we believe God. We're not just having an event. We're not just throwing together meetings. We're not just having an annual uh you know special meetings for our young people. We are we are under the inspiration of the word of God for this hour to fulfill God's plan and purpose in bringing his word into manifestation in a world right now where many young people have no direction. No. Uh under great depression under under total uh mis misleading uh teachings and and uh and you know uh organizations that are leading them completely away from their true nature, their true purpose which is only found in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we want to we want this to be a lighthouse this weekend. We want it to to to stir the hearts of the people. We want to see young people being stirred by the word of God. Not going after the gifts, not going after the emotions, but going after the giver himself, &gt;&gt; coming into his presence with expectation that he can discern your needs no matter what condition. Amen. Praise God. And so we look forward to that. How many enjoyed the services with uh brother Simon uh a week ago Sunday? He brought a beautiful message on standing on the rock. We know that that rock is something that if we're not standing on that rock in this hour where the world is completely falling apart. We're going to be tossed to and fro. We're not going to know what's up, what's down. We're not going to know who we are. But thank God for the rock of revelation that he's placed within this body and within our hearts to serve him with all that we have within us. Amen. So I I really appreciated that message and uh I really appreciated brother Tim's service um message last Sunday um you know that the seventh seal sets you free and uh you know I've always enjoyed brother Tim's personal testimony. It's always been a blessing. I remember, you know, back in the late 90s, him and I went on a on a missionary trip. It was our first missionary trip, and I was I was ministering at the time. Brother Tim was not actually uh called to to the ministry as of yet, but he, you know, he was with me and and I was ministering the word, but every service and we did we we went to like I think seven or eight different places and we ministered almost seven or eight or nine times, something like that. It was a lot of services and before every service I would have brother Tim come up and give his testimony. And let me tell you, every service I wept hearing the testimony that was coming forth because I knew the reality of God and what he had done in him. I knew that that's the same God that I know. And and and and it was always a tremendous blessing. And here now we see him, you know, maturing and coming into his into his maturity in the word of God and God dealing. Listen, that that work that he started way back then when when he said to him, uh, you'll not find me here. Well, that that that's still progressing in his life and in your life and in my life. &gt;&gt; Okay? Because there's places that we go sometimes in life, you know, along, you know, the the journey that we have and the walk that God has placed. It doesn't matter if you're here for you're you're serving the Lord and in this message 10, 20, 30 years, it's irrelevant. You will find that there are areas that you will not find God because of your own ideas, your own interpretation, your own, you know, thoughts of how things are supposed to work out and how things are supposed to be. And yet God, because he's placed that portion of himself in you, that experience continues &gt;&gt; and it evolves &gt;&gt; and it brings us to times like this in our lives. And I believe that, you know, Tim brought out, you know, a beautiful thought and and and and process by which God is delivering his people and bringing them into the liberty of the Holy Spirit and especially under the opening of the word because that is what truly sets us into our rightful position as sons and daughters of God and free. &gt;&gt; Free. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, praise God. I trust that you enjoyed that. I really enjoyed it. I was so blessed. Sister Jennifer and I were just really blessed. And so, we thank God. You know, we were on vacation, but we never stop feeding on the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No, sir. How can you can you go a day or two without eating? Sure, you can do that for a couple days. You can fast if you've got a purpose for it. But if you don't have a real reason for it, your stomach's going to hurt. Your body's going to react. you're, you know, so you need to feed, you know, and this word that we're feeding on in this hour, it's fresh. &gt;&gt; It's not stale. Amen. That's why this whole church, this whole ministry is based on the supernatural present stage of the ministry of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. So, this is Let's all stand and let's go to the word of God. We certainly want to remember um brother Bill uh you know that the Lord will finish the work. I believe that that he's already started the the process of healing in his body. We want to remember sister Sheila continue to pray that uh you know till complete and total victory. Amen. This is a great battle. These are these are sons and daughters of God that are standing on the word of God. You hear their testimony. They're not giving up. They're not bowing down. They're not they're they're they're not discouraged. They they are pressing on. They're pressing through. Amen. Praise God. And this is what we're doing. And so, let's remember them in prayer. And if you've got a need this morning, then raise your hand unto the Lord and say, "Lord, remember me. Father, truly Lord, this this opportunity every time that we come together like this, Lord, where you know a man stands behind the pulpit and Lord has been prepared and has taken the time to uh you know look into your desire, your inspiration, what what you would have for the people, Lord. And then the people, Lord, they've been toiling all week and they've been dealing with all kinds of situations in their lives. And Lord, it seems almost like, you know, Sunday comes or Wednesday comes and and the battle is so great, Lord, that it's so difficult even to get into your presence, even to come into the house of the Lord, Father. But Lord, is it ever worth it every time we come, Lord? I know for sure today, Lord, that your presence is here, that your desire is here, that your your your uh uh purpose and your desire for each and every individual, Father, if if if each one of us can just Lord, put aside everything now. Set aside our thoughts of the week and set aside our thoughts of the morning and the burden that lays heavy on our hearts, tiredness. Lord, we we we speak your word this morning in the name of Jesus Christ. And we bind these powers, these principalities, these oppressions that would try to hinder the people. Father, Lord, let there be liberty in the atmosphere this morning so that your word can have liberty, so that you can you can speak to to personal needs and and situations and you can speak life into those uh situations. You can bring healing to bodies that need healing. You can bring restoration to relationships that are broken. Lord, you can bring uh total liberty in in finance. Father, these are things that you're mindful of. You said that that that that above all things you would that we would prosper even as our soul prospers. Lord, you know that you've already got our soul. You've already taken it, Lord. You've already uh ordained it to life, Father. But Lord, we're the these souls. are still locked into these human realms of of flesh, Father, and they fight. They they they resist, Lord. They're at emnity, Father. Even our thoughts at times, Lord, are not our own thoughts. We know they they they are of the enemy, Lord, to try and turn us back. But your purpose is greater than all of that, Father. And that is what we look to uh uh you know, to to look into this morning, Lord, that you would open this up in a greater way. Lord, we've talked about the purpose-driven life. We've talked about all these things, but Lord, there's more to it, Father. There's a purpose for each and every one of us today, &gt;&gt; right now. &gt;&gt; And Lord, that's what we're interested in knowing, Lord, that you would come and meet that need. Lord, take control of this vessel. Anoint it to speak. Anoint every vessel that's here and online to to receive. Father, open the understanding. Only you can do that. Grant it, Father. We commit this service into your hands in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So, we're looking at um the purpose of God. I believe, like I said, that this is going to be a springboard for the services that are up and coming. I believe that God has a purpose in bringing our young people together, in bringing us together. And I believe that that purpose is for us to recognize our purpose &gt;&gt; so that we can live it. &gt;&gt; Recognize and act upon the word of God that God has made available to us in this day and in this hour. We can talk about purpose all day long, but until we come into that place where we where we where where we tap into the purpose of God and his desire, that changes everything, saints. And so, let's read our scripture from the book of Acts. But before that, I'd like um actually, yeah, we're going to read the book. Yeah, we'll read that and then we'll play the video. We've got a very short video that we want to play. And it says here in the book of Acts 13:36-39, it says, "For David after he had served his own generation by the will of God," I I emphasize that because you can take that and you can change will to purpose. You can change will to the plan of God. You can change that to the thoughts that the Lord had about David uh before the foundations of the world. Amen. And he fulfilled and served his generation by the will of God fell on sleep and was laid unto his fathers and saw corruption. But he whom God raised again saw no corruption. He's talking about Jesus Christ. Be it known unto you, therefore, men and brethren, that through this man, Jesus, is preached unto you, the forgiveness of sins, and by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses. Blessed be the name of the Lord. The Lord add his blessings to the word of God. You may be seated. A Glory. Hallelujah. You know that's that's just wonderful. You know when we look at this scripture here and you know uh you know the book of acts is is not about the acts of the apostles not about the acts of the disciples or the common people. It's it's about the acts of the Holy Spirit moving in and through the people, placing them, giving them position in the word of God and giving them a word and a message that they would take into all the world. Amen. Praise God. Before we go into the actual service, I just want to play this video. It'll give us an opportunity to test our new projection system and at the same time give us a little quick inspiration. &gt;&gt; We all want a life that matters. So we pour ourselves into our work, our relationships, our experiences, and our achievements, always searching for some deeper sense of meaning. But in the pauses between our striving, we still feel like there's something missing. What if the problem isn't our desire for purpose, but in where we're looking to find it? Real fulfillment starts with a shift in focus. It happens when we respond to the love of God that's never stopped reaching toward us. Because true purpose isn't something we earn. It's something we find when we surrender. This is where you step into all that God has for you and into all that he desires for your life, no matter what the cost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Well, that was nice and clear. Now, we trust that the word of God is going to be nice and clear. Amen. Praise God. So today I'd like to look at you know uh the purpose of God and you know living a life of purpose you know purposeful living. Amen. Glory to God. But you know in order to do that we need to recognize what our purpose is where we fit. How we fit into God's plan in this day and in this hour. The scripture that we read here, you know, it it defines what the meaning to live for God is and to live, you know, your purpose in your generation. You know, David lived his purpose in his generation. And David was not perfect in his generation. So, we're not looking at, you know, a perfect life. We're not looking at a at a life that, you know, that has to be absolutely perfect and so supernatural in everything that we do and religious. We're not looking for that. We're looking for a natural life that that has a supernatural element built into it to recognize God's desire and purpose for you. Amen. What a statement was made about David that he served his purpose in his generation. Would you like that statement to be said about you? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. This description defines the type of life that we as Christians should strive towards, motivating us and moving us forward down the path that the Lord has for us. Can you imagine this being said about us? If the Lord should terry and some of us have to go by the grave, I would want to hear that said about me, about you that you served your purpose in the generation that you were called to this message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise God. that that at our graduation service that would be said, well done. &gt;&gt; Well done in serving the Lord in in in letting go of everything. Like the video said, at whatever cost once the purpose of God was revealed and made known, everything else had to come subject to that purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. that we served God's purpose for this generation in our homes, in our communities, in our workplaces, in whatever area that you've been placed here in this life, people will look and say that person served God. They had a purpose in serving God. Every time we would talk about things, they would inject just, you know, lightly inject, you know, God has a plan. God has a purpose in all of these things. Amen. But what happens when you don't have purpose? You know, I remember as a young person that um I had, you know, ever since I was like early teens, I just wanted to be a successful businessman. I would have lawnmower business. I would have paper roots. I would be shoveling snow in the in the winter. I I'd be painting people's homes. I'd be looking, knocking on their doors, trying to, you know, because I had this desire because I was brought up in a family where nothing was given to me. When my dad said, "You want this, you got to work. You want money, you got to go do this. You got to go and work for your money." And so I, you know, as as young, you know, we're taught that in this world, you got to work and you've got to strive. And you know, as I got older, you know, into my late teens, I I started to, you know, you know, look deeper and I' I'd look into, you know, um, different, uh, you know, programs on, you know, on how to develop a successful attitude and how to, you know, develop, uh, you know, um, a mental attitude that would that would bring success into my life. And I started taking all these different courses, you know, as I got into my early 20s. and I'd be listening to these, you know, um, personal development motivators and and they would excite me because I would be able to grasp, you know, a little glimpse. And one of the things that they always made very clear that I can remember was a was a was a a thread that ran through all of those teachings was you need to set goals. if you have no goals or purpose because a goal what it does is it sets something you know a destination for your life and in order for you to have you know like so they would tell you you know like you got to write your goals you want to you want to earn a a $100,000 a year you need to write yourself a check and place that check on the wall and you need to look at that check every single day and you need to affirm it in your mind and in your thoughts that I am going to earn $100,000 per year. I will earn 100. And then as your goals started to grow and your your vision started to expand, you would you would you would set these higher goals for your life. And you know, you'd you'd put pictures of of boats and and houses and and cars and and money. You would you would put all these things around you, you know, uh because and and this is all scriptural, you know, like David said, you know, let let me see you on the doorpost. Let me see you here, there, everywhere, Lord, you know, but it was a perversion. It was a total perversion because no matter what and especially if you're a son or a daughter of God, and this is the element that we're trying to discover here, that because we are sons and daughters of God, we need to discover his purpose for our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. and all that I was doing in in all of those trainings and developing and many of you have probably done it and you you know you still may be doing it and that's good because now you've got a revelation on it. There's nothing wrong with positive affirmation. There's nothing wrong with visualizing. God is a visualizer. God saw in his mind &gt;&gt; exactly what he was going to create &gt;&gt; and it manifested and you as a son or daughter of God have that same image built into you as an attribute of God. &gt;&gt; Once you come into your total, you know, understanding of this, it changes your your your entire life. Once you realize that that the one that that created the universe has a purpose to dwell in you in this hour and you have the ability to speak God's thoughts into the circumstances and the situations but with character &gt;&gt; with understanding with revelation not with with the teachings of man like this that I just mentioned to you. It's all based on man's teachings, man's ideas, and and you set goals. But goals are important in the mind of God. God sent forth attributes which were were his thoughts and his goals into each and every generation. And each generation would bring forth the purpose of God in that particular generation. And that's why David when when God chose David from a from a from a you know from a young shepherd in the field who was just a young you know man. God saw in David before anybody else could see it. He saw that there was a king there. &gt;&gt; Amen. That there would be one after his own heart. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That there would be one whom he would use. But David was also just a man. Amen. And that's what we need to understand that that we're still human beings here on this earth and we have to deal with situations in our lives and we have to overcome things in our lives in order to get to the place where God's purpose can start to take control and have total preeminence in our lives. Amen. So many of these teachings would use the scriptures like as a man thinks in his heart so is he. And they would teach those, you know, I'd listen to some, you know, uh, personal development speakers that were actually ministers. Zigg Ziggler, he's one of the ones that comes to my mind. He was a he was a a minister and yet he was a a a professional development speaker on on positive mental attitude and how to bring how to bring prosperity into your life and all of those things. you know, seeing yourself imagining all these things. But but as a son or a daughter of God, this when when I came to the Lord 31 years ago ago, all those things that had been laid in as foundations as I was coming to my calling, my my placing in the word of God until God, all those things, they all made sense when God gave me the first revelation on himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I was desiring to satisfy a thirst. And if you've got a thirst for God in your soul and you don't understand that thirst because you're still unsatisfied, you're still in a condition that that that even though you come to church every Sunday, every Wednesday, you come in, you get you get the anointing on you, you rejoice, and then a few days later, you're miserable, you're depressed, you're wondering whether God even called you. you get into these conditions. What is it? It's because you fully have not come into that that that that absolute purpose and plan of God. You haven't recognized it yet and you haven't surrendered your life to the things that are keeping you bound in this world. Amen. We need his purpose. God's purpose overrides all your goals. &gt;&gt; Amen. When I came to realize, I said, I remember I remember telling Pastor Simon when when when when this revelation came on my uh in my life and it transformed my whole life, everything all I could all I all I desired was to to to make sure that everything around my life would only look at that purpose that the coming of the Lord that that God was real that he'd actually called he'd actually called me and called my family out of this world. I didn't want anything else. I just wanted to serve God. I wanted to let go of everything. I said, "Brother, I'm going to sell the businesses. I'm going to I'm going to get rid of all these things." You Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, brother. Slow down. You see, because because that awakening when it happens, you know, it it it brings his purpose to the forefront and then all of a sudden everything else around you just becomes secondary. That's how you know that you've that you've genuinely come into a a a relationship with the Lord, you know, like it's it's something that that you you realize that you're it's not a sensation. It wasn't a sensation. It wasn't a uh you know, that that that I met a a supernatural angel that that spoke to me. It had nothing to do with all that. It was a divine revelation of something that had taken place on the inside of the inside that no man can explain that. &gt;&gt; It's called the purpose of God. &gt;&gt; It's called the attribute of God. Every single attribute that God sent forth had a purpose instilled within that attribute. It had a time and a season when it would come into manifestation. And so this element takes place in every single life that once you are truly born again and your experience with the Lord is is it it has become your absolute then all the purposes all the goals that you had that's why you know a lot of the people like you know I remember in the early days like I was very active with friends, traveling, going golfing three times a year away, golfing three times a week, you know, going to the bars, very active, had a wide, you know, surrounding of friends in many areas of my life. And I remember when that time came, it was like they everything just faded out. It just completely faded away. And people were wondering, "What's the matter with you? You're not coming this year. Are you you you're the life of the party a lot of the times with the jokes and with the this and you know, come on, Dan. You're not No, I No, I'm not that person anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Purpose changed. The goals changed. &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, all those desires for for riches and and for wealth and all those things. Now God brings that all into balance as we mature and as we grow in the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because those things are also part of serving the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. when when when you know, brother Simon was bringing all those series on prosperity and like how God wants you to prosper and all of those things. I remember I I was feeding on that word because I had to override a lot of of a lot of the mental legalism that I that I had taken into my mind because that's what happens, you know. you know, uh, and and that's that's what this whole message has gone through. And that's why there's a mess within the message is because a lot of a lot of people took the things that were spoken by the prophet and made those things either too liberal or totally legalistic to the point where people got into total confusion. &gt;&gt; And now they're not serving their purpose. They're not recognizing what it is that God wants them to fulfill. I thank God for a a pastor that over the last 30 years was was balanced, that was able to walk down the middle of the road and look at all of these factions. Look at this thunder movement. Look at this Peruia movement. Look at this. The seal ain't open. The seal is open. all these things allowing us to be to be uh you know like like uh uh weathered and and and and matured through it all by allowing ourselves you know that he wouldn't he wouldn't point us to it. But he wouldn't he wouldn't like take it and say you got to stay away from that. You that's wrong. That's no no no no. He would just preach the word. &gt;&gt; And this is what we need to understand in this hour that the word and the purpose of God in this hour is for us to preach the word. &gt;&gt; The word that is in season. &gt;&gt; Amen. not to be filtered or or or or placed under a legalistic interpretation or to you know everything is finding the middle of the road. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And so this is why you know our lives you know we're overridden by the purpose of God. But let's let's look at the next scripture here. We're going to move along here. in the book of Ecclesiastes. Well, actually, before we go there, before we go there, just go back for a minute. I want to read a couple of things here that I found very interesting. um because we're going to be looking at Ecclesiastes because, you know, Solomon brought out some beautiful thoughts and understanding on, you know, the purpose of life and how, you know, you can find that that there's a lot of vanity in life if you're not looking in the right places. But, you know, but if if we just look for a few minutes here at a life without purpose, you know, sometimes I get ahead of my notes. You know, during times of war, prison guards were known to give prisoners the task of digging a great big hole. He would give them shovels and a big burlap bag and sacks to dig and carry the dirt to the other side of the compound. Generally, this was done during the heat of the day because these were prisoners of war. And the prisoners would work for months digging these holes. And when the job was finished, the prisoners would feel a little satisfaction. The hole's been completed. The dirt pile is moved where they wanted it. But moving the dirt, okay, but then the prison guard would give them a new burlap sack and tell them to refill the hole with the dirt that they just moved. And it would take them weeks and months to do the same thing. And now they're doing it arbitrarily. So some of the prisoners couldn't handle it. If they had been moving dirt for for for a reason, if there was a purpose for moving the dirt, well, then there would be some satisfaction. But moving the dirt for no reason at all for months without any purpose would would drive them completely insane. And this is something that we need to just draw a little thought from there that you know without a purpose, without having some sort of of clarity, we can get into a rat race where we're doing the same thing over and over and over again. You Oh, I go to church. I am I'm one of the best church members. I'm there every Sunday. You know, you're doing it over and over and over again, but you haven't discovered the purpose of why God is speaking to you personally and placing you and positioning you for the rapture. As humans, we weren't built like this. We need to know that there's a purpose in whatever we do. So, living without purpose is insanity. Actually, there's a book in the Bible that gives us insight, and this book is from the book of Ecclesiastes. And so, now, you know, I believe that the Holy Spirit inspired Solomon with these inspirations. And so, now let's read, you know, the first scripture. It says, "Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher." Vanity of vanities. All is vanity. What profitth had a man of all his labor, which he taketh under the sun? One generation passeth away, another generation comes, but the earth abideth forever. The sun also rise and the sun goes down and hastes to his place where he arose. You know, you know, they say Solomon was one of the wisest men that ever lived and he tried living his life for various purposes. He tried living his life for possessions. So he went out and accumulated great wealth. He was actually considered the wealthiest wealthiest person in the world uh to to ever live. But what he found is that living life for the purpose of possessions is a wasted life. And we can get caught up in, you know, in everything being possession, everything being, you know, getting ahead financially, getting ahead bigger house, getting ahead with, uh, you know, with with better clothes and and and and all these things. We can get we can get off track by those things. Those things when they line up with the purpose of God, they fall together perfectly. &gt;&gt; All those things. That's why the scripture says, "Seek first the kingdom of God." Next, Solomon tried living a life for prestige and power. He actually became the most powerful man in the world. Kings and queens came from around the world just to see his magnificence and hear what he had to say because he had such wisdom and understanding. But Solomon found that living for power was unfulfilling. Finally, he tried living life for pleasure. Nothing was withheld from him. He had 700 wives and over 300 concubines. He also built entire cities just to hold his sports cars, his chariots, his horses. But again, he found it all in vain and without value. Praise God. Solomon lived for everything the world values but found that he had no real purpose with this kind of understanding. Solomon under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit wrote the book of Ecclesiastes and he talks about what happens when we don't know the real meaning of life. That's what we can draw from these scriptures to cause us to look into the real purpose that God has for each and every one of us. what his purpose. Solomon gives us five tragic consequences of living life without purpose. This is all laying in a little foundation here so that we can springboard from here because a lot of our young people, they don't realize that the the the world that's around them and and and all of the media and all of these, you know, these sites, they they're creating worlds that don't exist. They exist in in in in one in a million because they're stars or because they're they've made, you know, great wealth and and those are one in a million that reach those levels. But yet they want these people. These people go out and they and they and they set up their Instagrams and all these things and they get followers. And what they're trying to do is they're trying to capture the minds of our young people to create uh futures and lives that don't really exist. Getting them to to create a future without God. Amen. A life without purpose is totally useless. Vanity of vanity, says the preacher. Vanity, it's all vanity. This word vanity is not what many people think because it has nothing to do with having excessive pride in oneself or one's appearance. Rather in the Hebrew language the word means useless, meaningless that all these great achievements of you know fixing your face so that you can you know you so that you can look younger and and and and wearing clothes that are that are like sexier and you know so that you can attract the right person and and and having great possessions and fancy cars and all those things. Without God's purpose in your life, young people, you will be drawn into a life of hardship. Sure, one out of 10, one out of a hundred are going to make it and they're going to say, "Oh, yes, I'm happy." But then look at them maybe five or 10 years down the road and see if their life is still a life that has purpose and destination to it. see if they're if the direction that they're walking in is leading them into a better life or a broken marriage &gt;&gt; or a dysfunctional relationship with their friends, their families, their parents, &gt;&gt; vanity. It's all meaningless. And what Solomon is saying is that living a life without the purpose of God is useless and without meaning. The problem is that far too many people simply want to only do enough and they want a quick way to get to where they want to go. They they they want a quick fix. &gt;&gt; That's why nowadays the women, they can go into a beauty parlor. If they've got a sagging face over here or they've got something wrong over there, they can go in and get a quick fix. &gt;&gt; But they don't realize that they're just setting themselves up for something down the road. Amen. We're not looking for quick fixes. We're looking for the plan and the purpose of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when his purpose becomes the forefront of your life, then your your own beauty is not is not based on your outward appearance. &gt;&gt; The true beauty now becomes your character, &gt;&gt; your your your nature. &gt;&gt; The nature of God starts to express itself through your life. And people start to realize a beauty that's on you that goes beyond human beauty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's when God's purpose. So we need to understand that that you know living this kind of a life for desiring things can lead to absolute heartache and destruction. Life without purpose is tiring. Look at he says it here. The sun also rises and the sun goes down and hastens to the place where it arose. The wind goes towards the south and turns around to the north. The winds whirl continually and comes again on its circuit. All the rivers run into the sea. Yet the sea is not full to the place from which the rivers come. What's he saying? Life without purpose is a life that goes around in circles. And Solomon gives us three examples of this sort of circular living. First is the rotation of the sun. He says it just keeps coming and it keeps going. Things don't change and you're living a life and you're caught into this circle of life that is useless. And he gives it the example through the wind. And then he gives the example through the rivers. Another way to say this is that it's like we're on a great big treadmill. Using up a whole lot of energy and going a whole lot nowhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know if you ask people right now, you ask people how you doing? You know what most people are going to say? Oh brother, I'm tired. Oh man, I'm tired. You know, you know why they're tired? Because they're just doing the same old thing and they don't have a purpose. We need to refocus ourselves into the purpose of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It'll change everything. It'll it'll it'll put a light onto your feet because now God's God's now saying, "Yes, you've caught my thought. You've caught my desire. You've caught my purpose for your life." Amen. Glory to God. Let's go to the next slide. Ecclesiastes 1:8-9. All things are full of labor. Man cannot utter it. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. The thing that hath been is that which shall be, and that which is done is that which shall be done. And there is no new thing under the sun. People are striving to find something new to do. I got to get a new house. I got to get a new car. I got to get a new, you know, every week they want new clothes because they get, you know, they they figure the clothes will make them feel better, look better, all these things. Always constantly looking to to to do things in order to produce things. But all things are, you know, Solomon is saying that without purpose, there's never going to be a satisfaction. That is nothing of this world can satisfy what the human soul desires. That attribute that God has placed in you desires the word. &gt;&gt; You may not know it yet, but when you come into these services and you come under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and the Lord starts to water his word, he starts to water that attribute that was placed in you before the foundations of the world. The purpose of God starts to light up in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. When we see no point to life, we become restless. You know, consider the TV remote. You know, these are things that I picked up here. He says, you know, the average person will change channels 325,000 times in their lifetime. &gt;&gt; Some people do it in a week. &gt;&gt; Nothing makes me happy. &gt;&gt; Praise God, brother. G. &gt;&gt; You can never totally satisfy a son or a daughter of God until God's purpose is in them. &gt;&gt; It settles everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't see any purpose in life. Then we get restless and life will be unfulfilling. Life without purpose is insignificant. He goes on, you know, if you read the whole chapter, he goes on, there is no remembrance of for former things, nor will there be any remembrance of things that are to come by those who will come after. You got to live a life and you know, listen, a generation goes by, two generations go by, three generations go by, by the time you get to the second and third generation, you don't remember those people. you don't remember uh you know the significance of their lives. Their lives just pass. In other words, they if if they had no purpose, if they had if they had not lived in their generation according to their purpose in God, they are forgotten. And we've got a a generation of young people that are now in the third and fourth generation just like they were back in in when they came out into the into the wilderness. There there came a generation that forgot Moses &gt;&gt; that that knew not Moses. And here we are. We're talking about preserving the word in our young people. They need to know that God sent a prophet. They need to know the purpose of God sending a prophet. They need to understand the dispensational changes and and the fulfillment of the purpose of God in each and every one of those dispensations and individuals that God used to bring us to this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This message was brought to us by individuals that had to sacrifice their lives to the purpose of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have this message today because of those individuals. We have this message today because of those that even went off the word. &gt;&gt; Those that that that went off into certain, you know, uh teachings, whether it be the thunders or the perusia, those things were there. God permitted those things to to come into the message in order to allow the the genuine reality of the message to surface &gt;&gt; so that the real so so that the real truth could could be made known. They were partial truths. They had a purpose. They God permitted it. God allowed it to come in order to to meet and and to and to deal with with certain other standards that were coming up within the message to try and bring it down. &gt;&gt; But God would always raise a standard &gt;&gt; by his word. And how would he do it? He'd go to certain individuals &gt;&gt; and he'd awaken his purpose in them. Hallelujah. Fame is fleeting. What what you know what use is 15 minutes of fame, you know, or five minutes if if you're lucky, you break a record and and it's a broken record and you know 20 minutes the two three days later it's forgotten. People looking for fame. That's not going to bring us happiness. That's not going to bring us what God desires to accomplish in our lives. Amen. Regardless of what you've accomplished, most of it will be forgotten over time. Consider the names that that grace various buildings and schools. Most of them have no idea who these people are. They go to those schools. They don't know who this person is. They have no idea because time disintegrates all of those things. But the word of God will remain. &gt;&gt; You could gain the wealth of the world like Elon Musk and yet deny that God even exists. &gt;&gt; Life without a purpose. Jesus said in Mark 8:36 37, "For what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul?" &gt;&gt; Or what shall a a man give in exchange for his soul? This is the reality of the sons and daughters of God. Amen. Life without purpose seems insignificant when compared to eternity and the plan that God has for our lives. It's uncontrollable. Let's go to our next slide. All things are full of labor. No, next one. Sorry. I commune with my own heart saying lo I am come to great estate. But here Solomon he came to a place where you know he started to commune within himself. And every single one of us must come to a place like this in our lives and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem. Yay. My heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge. And I gave my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly. I perceive that this also is vexation of the spirit. For in much wisdom is much grief, and he that increasth knowledge increased sorrow. So you can become the smartest individual. I'm going to have every degree that I can possibly get. I'm going to have LLDs, PhDs, all these, you know, MDs and all these, you know, things. Uh, bachelor of arts and all these things. Young people, these are these are okay, but you need to look to see how they come in line with the purpose of God in your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Think about, you know, you want to go out and you want to be like a a a a hip-hop singer. &gt;&gt; You know, you you you want to rap, but hey, you want to rap gospel music and you think, well, this is well, I'm I'm I'm rapping gospel. That doesn't line up with the purpose of God. that doesn't have the spirit of God on it. You could have a gift to sing. You could have a gift of the Holy Spirit. You could have a baptism of the Holy Spirit all 10 times a day and still have a soul that's bound for hell &gt;&gt; because you haven't you you you you haven't discovered that there's an actual attribute in you that has a purpose. And when that purpose comes to the surface, that rap music's got to go. &gt;&gt; Because it brings it subject to the purpose of God in your life. &gt;&gt; It cannot remain in your life if the attribute has been awakened in your life. Amen. You can learn all the greatest things that you could possibly learn. What good is it going to do you? it all. He came to a point where it was all vanity. Here's the sum total of it all. Life without purpose is pointless. Listen to now. These are some individuals that are well-known psychiatrists and philosophers and everything else. And here's what they came to realize about life with all the knowledge that they could acquire and gain and everything else. You got Isaac Aszoff, a prolific science fiction writer. As far as I can see, there is no purpose to life. That's what he came to. A prolific writer. Then you got Carl Jung, a psychiatrist. I don't know what the meaning or purpose of life is, but it looks as if there was something meant by it. Albert Ellis, as far as I can tell, life has no special or intrinsic meaning or purpose. Thomas Nagel, an economist, I'm afraid the meaning of life still eludes me. It's it's any wonder then that our culture has turned its back on God because they look to these great philosophers and these these individuals that that have tried to discover the purpose of life and they found that they cannot discover anything that relates to their real genuine purpose and God's purpose in this life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Another one says Bertrand Russell he was a philosopher and an atheist. He says unless you assume a God the question about life's purpose is meaningless. See he came to a place that you that without God there is no purpose. &gt;&gt; That's because he's an atheist. Sigman fraud fraud. The idea of a purpose stands or falls with the religious system. He came to a place where you know oh unless you you actually believe in a god then you can have a purpose. That is the purpose to know that there is a god. Amen. Praise God. Our society is saying if that if God does not exist then we are nothing more than an evolutionary ancient an evolutionary accident. If God did not create us then life has no meaning or purpose and that life really doesn't matter. Basically, the world's approach to life and finding purpose is bankrupt. Which is why we see so much chaos that's taking place in our churches and in our schools and in our political systems these days. Praise God. Let's go to our next scripture. We're going to wind down here now. We're going to look at Ephesians chapter 1 verses 4 to 5. according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy. I emphasize the word holy because I want to bring up the definition of it. And without blame before him in love, having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will. Next slide. having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself. Remember everything started in him. And when he created Adam, Adam was a reflection in the image of God. &gt;&gt; And within Adam was a purpose to express God. Amen. And so we need to realize that that it's his purpose now that has come down into this generation that we're living in right now, this time and season that he wants to reflect in and through our lives. that in the dispensation of the fullness of times, he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth, even in him, in whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to what the purpose of him who workketh all things after the counsel of his own will within the attribute of God that he's placed inside of you is his will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His desire for your life, &gt;&gt; his purpose and his plan for your life, &gt;&gt; when you receive the Holy Ghost, when we look at the word holy, go to the next slide here. I want you to see the definition in the Bible. Holy fundamentally means separated, set apart or distinct. This concept applies to God in his perfect moral purity and uniqueness from all creation and to people or things called to be holy through being set apart for God's use. that attribute that God has placed in you when when when when he's talking about giving you the Holy Ghost, he's not and when he and when you hear him say, "Be ye holy as your heavenly father is holy," he's not talking about you taking on a holiness that that is like God. &gt;&gt; The word means being set apart for the use of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And your purpose as a son or a daughter of God has a time and a season to come into full manifestation &gt;&gt; where you are going to reflect what it is that God wants to accomplish in this generation. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; And this is the generation for the rapture. &gt;&gt; In that attribute is placed the purpose of God to set you apart from the rest of the world. That's why you go to churches, you've got you've got thousands of different denominations. They're all claiming that they receive the Holy Ghost, but they don't understand what the Holy Ghost is. They think it's a sensation. They think that it's something that comes on them and makes them speak in unknown languages. Yes, it can do all of those things, but it's not the evidence that God is with you. It's not the evidence that you are a son or a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; The evidence that you are a son or a daughter of God is when the Holy Ghost comes upon you and takes you out of the world. Remember we were saying earlier how when the Holy Ghost came into my life, I didn't understand what was going on, but everything around me started to fade away. Why? Because in that attribute that was in your life when God called you, there was a purpose &gt;&gt; to set you aside for his use. &gt;&gt; Not to give you a religious spirit, not to give you a spirit where you're condemning everybody. You got to receive Jesus. You're going to hell. You're this and you're that and and get you into a a state of confusion where you're where where you're causing more confusion than anything else. No, it was for you. The Holy Ghost and the spirit of God coming upon you was to bring into action the attribute purpose of God so that you could fulfill and be set aside and set apart for the use of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what the Holy Ghost was given for. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we look back into the Old Testament, you take you take the word Holy Spirit and you take the word Holy Ghost. You will find that you will not find Holy Ghost anywhere in the Old Testament. You'll find Holy Spirit in the Old Testament. You'll find Holy Spirit in the New Testament. Holy Ghost is in the in the New Testament. And I looked it up yesterday on the on my concordance and Holy Ghost came up 89 times in the New Testament and it didn't show up anywhere in the Old Testament. Why? Because the spirit of God, it was known as the spirit of God in the Old Testament. And always the spirit of God was about God coming to man, anointing individuals in order to fulfill the purpose that he had for that individual at that time and that season. But then you'll notice that it's mentioned as Holy Ghost in the New Testament. The Holy Ghost is because it's now the it's now the person of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. You'll you'll you you'll see scriptures where it says that that the Holy Ghost had not been yet given because he had not ascended yet. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And so now we come to realize that that there was something that God was doing. Remember this is all based on God's plan that he had right from the beginning that he wanted to he wanted to dwell in man. He wanted to have possession of man. He wanted to rule &gt;&gt; and reign with his family here on the earth. &gt;&gt; But there was a process by which he would bring his word. &gt;&gt; In the Old Testament, the spirit of God would come upon the prophets. &gt;&gt; They would prophesy. They would speak things. They would know things because God was anointing them with the ability of the of the discerning and the ability to open the word and and unveil the word to the people of that particular age to draw them to the attention of what God's purpose was in that time. Well, here we are now and we're living in a day where people are all talking about, you know, have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed? And a lot of people don't understand what it what the Holy Ghost actually is. The Holy Ghost is not something that's that that's about sensations and speaking in tongues and and and prophesying. It's about God coming to you individually as a as a as an individual and opening your understanding to to his purpose for your life. &gt;&gt; Being set apart for his purpose. Let's go to the next scripture. And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to whom whom uh to to who are called according to his purpose. everything that's going on in your life, every circumstance that when you come into a a a recognition of who you are as a son or a daughter of God, regardless of the things that you've gone through, what you've come through, what you're what you're dealing with right now, let me tell you, if if the if you've been awakened to God's purpose in your personal life, you will look at every single thing and know that it's working for good. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's coming for a purpose to bring you into your position so that you can fulfill the portion of the word that's going to bring the rapture in this dispensation. For whom he did forno, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover, whom he did predestinate them, he also called. In whom he called them, he also justified. in whom he justified them, he also glorified. Listen, everything that you have need of is already in you. &gt;&gt; You've been justified. You've been you you everything that God knew you would require in this day in order to fulfill his purpose, he placed it inside of you. &gt;&gt; It must come to the surface. It must override the situations in your life. It must override even your mistakes. &gt;&gt; Amen. all the things that you that you struggle with in your life right now and you're wondering why am I not, you know, why why why am I not, you know, fulfilled? Why am I not feeling the peace of God? Why am I not feeling the liberty that I should as a son or a daughter of God? It's because you haven't fully discovered why God gave you the Holy Ghost. He didn't give you the Holy Ghost to come and sit in a church and just be a church member and and be on one of the committees. He gave you the Holy Ghost so that you could fulfill his purpose. And you knowing that and having a revelation of that gives you perfect faith to change your body &gt;&gt; to move you out of this dimension to give you the faith that you need for this body to be changed. &gt;&gt; It ain't going to happen because of some scientific understanding. It's going to happen because the word said so. &gt;&gt; Because the word is is purpose. His purpose is in the word and nothing can change what God has purposed within his word. Romans, he's already done those things. Now look, let's read on. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Who shall separate us from his purpose? There's nothing that can separate you from God's purpose. &gt;&gt; I'm trusting I'm speaking to some people here this morning that maybe there's s there's sin, you know, knocking at their doors. There's there's situations that are that are that are holding them back, making them feel like they like they like they can't fulfill God's purpose. They it's not clear in their minds what it is that that God because because I've got too many things. I've made too many mistakes. Shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword separate us from the love of God? &gt;&gt; You know what his love for you is, right? His purpose for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nay, in all these things we are what? More than conquerors through him that loved us. Amen. &gt;&gt; For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come. Listen, I don't care what's going to come into your life. If you've come into God's purpose, you know where you stand this morning. &gt;&gt; You know that that nothing can come into my life that it's not going to work for good. &gt;&gt; I've I've got an absolute this morning. I know that the word is a reality in my life. There's nothing that's going to get me looking left, right, or center. No power, no principality. Oh, demons are going to come and get you. They're going to get you in your sleep. Oh, I had a dream last night that a demon attacked me. Oh, I'm I I probably under attack. Oh, I better watch out. There's something going to come. Oh, there's a blow coming my way. What is that? That's all fear. &gt;&gt; It's all fear. You cannot allow fear to control a son or a daughter of God. Not in this hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not when you've been anointed with the purpose of God. It'll override those things. &gt;&gt; Look what he says here. He says, he says, "Nor height, nor depth, nor any creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is where? &gt;&gt; In the anointed body of Jesus Christ our Lord." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Nothing can separate us. Let's read let's read this uh quote here. Listen to brother Brandham. Perfect strength by perfect weakness. He says, 'Now we are very grateful that we still have a kind heavenly father who looks over our mistakes. Thank you Lord. And doesn't reckon them to us. I was reading over in the book of Romans the 4th chapter where Paul wrote the divine commentary on the life of Abraham. Now, we know that Abraham many times got kind of flustered like we do. But when but when his commentary was written, there wasn't any of his frustrations mentioned. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You see, never mentioned them at all. Said Abraham staggered not at the promises of God through unbelief, but was strong giving praise to God. See, and that's the way I hope mine will be wrote down in there. It's not my mistakes and everything, but just what I try to do, the intention of my heart to do for God's people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's that's the kind of purpose that God has placed within us that it overrides our mistakes. It overrides the things that we think have control over our lives. But here, go next slide. We're winding down here a few more minutes. That's the reason our sins today would be every No, sorry, John. I I hit the thing twice. Ye have not chosen me. Okay, let's let's let's make this clear. Jesus is making it very clear here that you don't choose me. I choose you. &gt;&gt; I choose you. I choose you &gt;&gt; for a purpose. &gt;&gt; I got a purpose to to fulfill in your life that's going to override your entire life. I don't care where you came from, what situation you're in right now. I don't care where you think you've been, where you think you you think, oh, that's too deep. That's that's I've gone too far. I've gone too far. I can never come back to God. Never mind. I have chosen you. you I but I chose you and I ordained you that ye should go and bring forth fruit. &gt;&gt; Not only he's going to call you with his purpose, but you're going to bring forth a manifestation &gt;&gt; of his word, his purpose that your fruit will remain. It's not going to be something that you're going to that you're going to come to church and you're going to last for a year or two. No, no, no, no. You're going to remain. You might go through some battles. You might go through some situations, but the purpose in my attribute that I've placed in you, it will not return unto me void. &gt;&gt; It will accomplish that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name, he may give it you. Go to the next slide. He says here in a testimony upon the sea, that's the reason our sins today would be everyone condemned. We'd all be condemned if we look at all our sin. But God can't take us because because he does. He hurts Christ. Imagine we're part of him. We're the bride. Don't you see? So there it is. So grace, I love this statement. So grace holds us in our mistakes until we see better. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Listen, sometimes you can get blinded by the light. You can get blinded by the by the you know by by by the trial by the situation that you're dealing with. You can get to a place where you know you know I got deceived. I fell into sin. This situation happened. I couldn't control myself. Listen, you are being held by grace because God's purpose cannot return void. It has to come to him. It has to accomplish his purpose and his plan. Amen. And he says, "I'm so thankful for that." Amen. Praise God. Let the musicians come. I want to read this. I was really blessed when I read this in questions and answers. Here's somebody now that's coming to brother Brandham with a question. He says, "I lived many years in sin until I found the Lord. Please, Brother Brandham, I have sinned again and I am not worthy to come before you in this holy place. Please tell me if I can be restored holy again. Please help me, brother Brandham. I have a I have a devil in me." You know people can get you know like this person is being sincere. Help me. Will you lay your hands upon me and restore me again? And brother Ram says now there is a question. I never noticed it when I read it a while ago. There is a question now that the person and now if the person is present now here he goes on. Next slide. He says let me just read it to you. I have lived many years in sin until I found the Lord. Please, brother Brandham, see I have sinned again and I'm not worthy to come before you in this holy place. Please tell me if I can be restored whole again. Listen to what he says. Yes, &gt;&gt; you have not sinned, my friend. Why could he say that? You got to you got to get the thought behind what he's saying here, okay? He says you you never he says uh please tell me okay so far he says yes you have not sinned my friend so far in God you have not you have not sinned my friend so far in God but what you could be restored in other words you could never sin too much as a son or a daughter of God I'm not saying go out and sin here let's get this clear here. I'm talking to people that are that are in that condition right now that are in a they they may find themselves in a circumstance and you know, we're looking for that last one. Okay, saints. &gt;&gt; We we got to get this word out to the people. We got to let them know that there's a way back. Amen. Because if there's representation in there, they're going to hear this word and there and something's going to awaken just like it happened to you, just like it happened to me. &gt;&gt; Okay? I wasn't expecting it to happen the day that brother Gabriel, you know, finally picked me up and brought me into the house of the Lord. I had no idea. And my life was was was a mess. But when he wants to call, you can't go too deep into sin. Hallelujah. He says, see, but as long as there is something dealing with your heart, you're still in line of restoration. Guilty of the least is guilty of the whole. &gt;&gt; I have sinned many times every day. Every one of us do things that we don't want to do. But that attribute in you cannot fail. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm going to end it with this &gt;&gt; psalm. It says, "The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he delightth in his ways, though he fall. &gt;&gt; You know that God still delights in your ways, though you fall. Though you make mistakes, God delights in you because he's purposed himself in you. He's placed himself in you. He shall not be utterly cast down, for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand. I have been young and now am old, yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread. &gt;&gt; Saints, you can never get away from God's purpose in your life. Regardless of your situation, regardless of your mistakes, regardless of your thoughts, regardless of your upbringing, regardless of the mess that maybe is happened within your mind, young people, you know, uh even young people that have been brought up into this message, not understanding the real purpose of the Holy Ghost, which is to awaken within you God's purpose for your life, to fulfill his plan, his desire for you. That's what we want to recognize, his life, his purpose, so that we can live it. Amen. Praise God. Let's sing that song. Create in me a clean heart. David, you know, David cried out. David had the Holy Spirit, but he didn't have it in the way that we're receiving it now. Did you know that? He had the anointing of the Holy Spirit on his life. That's why when he sang this song, he sang it. He says, "Take not thine Holy Spirit away from me." Because the Holy Spirit, we need the Holy Ghost. Because the Holy Ghost is what gives us the ability to overcome this dimension. The Holy Spirit, the the Holy Ghost is is God himself. When you receive that, that can never go to that that portion of him in you can never go to hell. If he's in you, that's why he says on that day ye shall know that I am in the father. He in me and I in you. You hear the scripture. It says Christ in you your hope of glory. What is it? It's him in us. Create in me a clean heart. Oh God, and renew a right spirit within me. This is something that you can desire. Create in me a clean heart. Create in me a clean heart. [Music] Oh God, and renew right spirit within me. Oh, cast me now away from thy presence, oh my Lord, and take. That's the joy of my salvation. Your spirit is the joy of my salvation. Lord, created me. Restore to me the joy, the joy of thy salvation and renew my spirit within me. [Music] Let's pray. Heavenly Father, I know there's a lot said here today, Lord. I don't even I know that Lord, I I did my best. Lord, I I just I bring the word in the way that I see the word and the best that I can possibly convey. Father, this word of life that burns within our hearts, oh God, burns within my heart, Lord, it'll take you now, Lord, to to go into every heart and every life and get them, Lord, to the attention of your purpose. [Music] A real desire for your purpose, which is the Holy Ghost in this day and in this hour. That is your purpose to recognize the word for our day. Lord God, may your spirit go out into every heart and every life this week after this word has been spoken. Lord, may things be brought to our remembrance, Father. that there's nothing that that can override your purpose. While we face situations and circumstances and Lord, having to go to work and maybe deal with a person that that that really gets on our nerves. Lord, may we just look and remember that this is working for good. This is working your purpose in my life. This is going to bring to pass what what what has been promised, Lord, according to your word in this hour. that there's going to be a church without spot, without wrinkle that's going to stand on the word of God. That's going to be changed in a moment and in the twinkling of an eye. Lord, that is going to be the reward of the church in this dispensation. Father, that they're not going to have to be drawn into the into the tribulation that this world is right now, Lord. Even right now, you don't have to be a genius to figure that out, Lord. All we have to do is look and you know read the newspapers and listen to the news and hear how this world is completely collapsing around us where systems are falling apart now the people are falling into financial difficulty like never before. Lord I'm seeing it in the real estate markets and in the uh in many areas father where where there's distress in the hearts of the people father they don't know where to turn. They're looking to the government. They can't find an answer. They're looking to their friends. They can't find an answer, Lord. But you are the answer. You are the purpose. You are the plan. You are the desire that that that can be placed into the hearts of the people that can change their lives and give them a future, Lord, where they can be happy, they can be joyful, they can they can have an effect. Lord, place place a a spirit of of of uh of testimony upon our lives that we can share these testimonies. Lord, we should be able to share with the people the joy of our salvation. We should be able to share with the people how how glorious it is to serve you, Father. That it is that it's good to be a Christian. That it's good to serve the living God. That there's that there is a future in serving the living God. Even our young people, Father, they need to know that there's that there's a a life that they can live, that they can have a real genuine, happy life as a young person here on this earth. They can even get married. They can have children. But Lord, they need to find your purpose in their lives first and then everything else will follow. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; I believe that with all of my heart. Lord, may this weekend that's coming, Father, these upcoming meetings, may there be such an outpouring of your purpose into the hearts of the young people that they will desire you, Lord, the person of the Holy Ghost. Not a sensation, not some vision or some dream, but the person. Lord, you come into their hearts. You come into their lives. You make yourself real to the individual. It'll change their lives. It'll they'll never be the same again. Father, that's what we desire for our children, for our young people. Father, Lord, help each and every one of us this week to fall into our duty, fall into our position, be ready, willing, desiring uh to have a passion to serve the body of Jesus Christ. This is the the message of the hour, Lord. To serve one another, to edify one another, to nourish one another by the word of God. To testify to to our friends, to our family members, to our uh to even those that we that we cross paths with. Lord, sometimes it just a person comes into our life and they're in need. Father, may we let them know that you're a living God that's present and let us have the testimony of Jesus Christ upon our lips. Granted, Father, this is our desire, Lord. We commit ourselves to your service. Lord, may you just bless, prosper, strengthen each and every heart here today. Lord, may they go out and live your purpose in their lives. Grant it.
