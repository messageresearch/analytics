TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good evening my dear friends how wonderful it is to gather with you together in the house of God on this marvelous Wednesday evening may the Lord bless you real good we will now read our scripture and do our short brief study reading from Revelation chapter 1 from verse 5 unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and had made us kings and priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion for ever and ever amen god bless you tonight praise God I'm so happy to be in the house of the Lord realizing that as our scripture has says that he has loosed us from our sins the word moost or washed us from our sins really means he's looseness or freed us from our sins there there we are brothers and sisters reduced loose from those sins which means that we were once tied up we were once shackled we we were shackled and we were chained but now we are loosed this also gives us the picture that we were imprisoned but now by the power of the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ your most I'm most from my sins loose from the past loose from everything else this also gives us the the thought of let's say you have a garment and that you love that garment you love to wear it as we are told to put on Christ but we you know we love to wear a certain garment and you may be at a wonderful dinner and something stains your garment that you are wearing and but everything you have trade you could not get out the stand you've tried every chemical every man-made chemical every thing that was in the store and you could not get the stain out until one day you thought about it let me not just use the regular detergent I need to get some bleach to deal with this stubborn stain and there you place that piece of clothing into the water and they required amount of bleach and after a time you'll notice that the bleach seems to break up all the chemicals of that stain and until the stain begins to vanish away from your piece of clothing in actual fact the bleach moost the dirt or the stain from the fabric of the clothing and that is the sense that we have here today that he had mousse or washed us in his own blood may I say watch this in his own bleached blood the bleached blood of Christ has washed us and cleansed us completely perfectly and and set us free to worship Him and to praise his holy and precious name Lord a god did you really catch that he has washed us the book of Revelation chapter 1 verse 5 says in his old blood in his own blood he has washed us oh praise be to God I thank God for that now we understand that he did not wash this with human blood no human sacrifice or blood could wash away our sins but it took the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ Himself to wash our sins away thanks be to God it would have said we were not saved by the will of man or the blood of man oh praise God but here we see we are saved by the blood of God God's own blood which kid has the power and the ability to bleach us from every sin stain upon our hearts upon our lives we were not my friends saved by any other blood but the blood of God Peter calls that blood of God the blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah Paul called it the blood of the Lord Lauren a god and he also called it the blood of Jesus oh the blood of Jesus washes white as snow now see clearly not three persons one persons what God the blood of God the blood of Jesus hallelujah the blood of our Lord one God not three but one God that died on the cross and bled there for our sins one person there is the great revelation that Jehovah God came down and done from his glory everliving story my God and Savior came and Jesus was his name and this great Jehovah came down and by the means of the virgin birth was able to make himself a body thanks be to God yes sir and God made that body or as he would have said to Solomon he built his own house and God came down and lived in his own house or Tabernacle written with God's house God's tabernacle is Jesus Christ God was in Christ reconciling the world not to express the second person or a third person but unto himself that he was reconciling the world yes sir and that blood that marvelous wonderful blood that flowed of Calvary was the blood of God Himself that came to redeem us amen for God had to be in that body that he himself made he being a spirit could not bleed of his spirit but through the instrumentality of the body that he made for himself that body could bleed chemical blood that we human beings can see and identify but something visible that God himself had bled for our sins thanks be to God hallelujah now if we're to go to the Old Testament we may see this truth amplified through tapes through the type and a shadow of Adam and Eve being in the garden when Adam and Eve first sin of course that news went straight to heaven let us see it as an angel going into the presence of God to announce that his children on earth had sinned against him no what was your reaction the reaction was that God send another create another human being and send him or her down to do the redemption that God called out to Michael or some other great angel and send them down to do that great redemption oh my did God send his son if he had a second person to accept that he send the son but no God came himself into the garden to redeem his lost son for Adam said he heard the voice of God walking in the garden and the voice crying with a brokenness Adam Adam where are you where are you that's their fellowship meeting that they would have every evening when God and Adam and Eve would have their time of fellowship with the cathedral of the under the cathedral of the sky and so there they were God having such great love within his heart would not entrust the redemption of his creation there's redemption of his son if his daughter under any other but he entrusted it to himself as much as he said to Abraham I swore by myself God swore by himself God came down himself to go the redemption praise being a God that we have his personal attention his personal action within this great process of redemption so we are redeemed unto himself and we are redeemed by the blood of God his self thank God so this eternal God came down and dwelt in a mortal body in order to take away our sin he became the Lamb of God he became the Lamb of God to be able to shed his blood and enter beyond the veil to make sacrifice for our sins consider this my friends then if we are saved by the blood of God if we have been washed and loosed freed set free from the shackles of sin the habits of sin all the desires of sin free set free by the grace of God then it was the blood of God then it had to be perfect blood perfect blood and if the blood that perfect blood is losing us from our sins then my friends we are loosed by the power of this blood we are loosed from our bondage of sin from the power of sin from the very defilement of sin we have been set free by the blood of God which is the blood of our Lord the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and this loosing is perfect and complete for we are perfect in him on the other righteousness of God in him we were chosen in him and in him we have redemption through Jesus Christ our Lord but a shed blood of the Lamb of God hallelujah and therefore there is no condemnation there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus thanks God hallelujah amen amen who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justify it or in other words it's God that has declared us righteous it is God hostak that has declared us sinless washed most freed by the blood of God himself who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died hallelujah Romans eight the 33 to 34 amen praise God and it took his death to give us this great prescription of the blood for when the people in the book of Acts realized that they were infected with the virus of sin they asked doctor Peter Simon Peter what shall we do to be saved and dr. Simon Peter answered repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and furthermore there is no other name given under heaven whereby we must be saved but the name of Jesus Christ our Lord hallelujah glory to God so friends I tell you don't listen to men for we have been made free and guiltless or our guilt free condemnation is gone the blood of Christ has washed it away from us and set us free sitting sinless and faultless before the truth of Almighty God you are loosed but a blood of Jesus Christ thank God hallelujah man I want you to know wherever you are all men listening to me here tonight you are loosed by the blood of God woman Thou Art Loosed by the blood of God young people you are loosed from every habit every sin every flaw you are loosed by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ thank God hallelujah so don't allow yourself to be tied down by the traditions of man by the Creed's of man or by various Church darkness don't allow that anymore and don't be led astray by listening to those who denied the power of the blood denied the power of the world and deny that Jesus is our God our Savior our healer God our Baptizer with the Holy Spirit God our coming God our soon coming King none other but the Lord Jesus Christ himself Oh glory to God hallelujah so here we stand or here we sit or here we we are in the presence of God as God's free men and women God's free children his free people set free and loose by his own precious blood thank God amen now in the next verse revelation 1:6 reading half of that verse and had made us kings and priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion for ever and ever amen glory to God he had made us again he loosed us now it's him salvation is of the Lord salvation is not of works it's not a man it's not by merit it's not by anything it's not even by our sincerity salvation is by God's works in our life he has made us kings and priests unto the Lord salvation is his doing and salvation is all of grace it is by the grace of God not by works hallelujah thanks be to God amen I'm glad Martin Luther recognized that and had a revelation and broke from his traditions and his darkness and the old Creed's and walked away into the freedom of the revelation of the word of the Living God for he had made us kings and priests unto God hallelujah redeemed us and loosed us and did all of that friends and made us to be kings and priests so that now we are spiritual Kings oh thank God we reign over a spiritual Kingdom you may not realize it but we are in total Dominion and authority over the kingdoms of darkness over the kingdoms of this world over everything we are kings unto the Living God anointed by the Holy Spirit behold mark 16:15 behold I give you power power over all sickness all the day all those powers you do power to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover recover sickness germs demon powers all other things come under your authority which was taken away from Adam Adam lost his inheritance there in the garden but here Adams inheritance and the inheritance of this second Adam is restored back to the people of God the trimming of God we are in a place where we are restored back into our divine authority which God gave to us so here we are a spiritual Kings ruling right now and reigning with him over a spiritual Kingdom where our commands must be obeyed and every other power upon this earth even those so-called princes and powers of heavenly places are in subjection to us they are defeated by Jesus Christ and he has given us his authority to rule and reign over them now we are drawn spiritual kings now and we will be kings in the Millennial Kingdom to reign upon this earth with him Colossians 1 3 the scripture says who had delivered us from the power of darkness and that translated us into the kingdom of his dear son so right now we are reigning spiritually with the Lord Jesus Christ and whoever discovers sin over our flesh and over the world systems and over the devil and all of his influences and we are and we're showing that we have conquered and defeated Satan by the part to display and manifests the life of Jesus Christ which Satan has tried to prevent you and I in every way from doing that but by victory over him this glorious victory and the love divine we are able to manifest the life of the Lord Jesus Christ and show him forth to the people that they can recognize that Christ in you God lives in you and makes himself known through you Christ in us working willing and performing things for his own purposes and for his own good pleasure yes my friends even now we are a spiritual kings and priests seated in heavenly places in the Lord Jesus Christ and giving glory praise and honor to his marvelous name not only has he loosed us washed us freed us not only had he made us kings to rule and reign with him but my Lord is so gracious he has made us priests unto Him and again let me stress he has made us not by our just our desire not by our will power not by our might not by any hour even our own choices but he has made us priests yes priests unto him and you know what priests do priests up give offerings on behalf of the people they stand as intermediaries they stand in the gap Oh for the glory and praise of God and so he has prease puts us into the position for his purpose so we was saved with a purpose we have created for a purpose and here he has made us priests that we might offer him the offering of praise that we might praise his holy name and that our offering of praise will go before him like a sweet smelling perfume acceptable in his presence Oh glory to God he has made us priests that we may offer not just our praise but our lives as living sacrifices holy and acceptable to God which is but a reasonable service after what our he has done for us at dark Calvary we are here as priests also that we may worship Him we may glorify him along with the twenty-four elders and along with all those thousands upon ten thousands in the heavens above that give glory to the name of this great and mighty God hallelujah for thou art the Lord God Almighty we lift our hands and worship to thee to give your glory and honor and praise hallelujah yes sir so we given the offering an offering by being in the spirit while we worship we give him this offering my friends by being in the truth while we worship being made sure we are in the revelation of God while we're worshiping and not to be those who know not what they worship but some that worship Him with a lot of spirit a lot of emotion but they lack the truth then there are those who are filled with the truth but they left spirit but right down the center of this narrow way goes a little slop that worships him and gives him the offering of worship by worshipping Him in spirit and in truth give living lines of intercession living prayer lives genuine prayer lives which is nothing less to have a prayer life is to have a consistent life of prayer all things be the God petitioning us priests and interceding for others praying for others requesting for others with such humility with such love and grace not thinking of oneself but reaching out to the Lord on the behalf of others that he may bless them and you know when you pray with that sincere prayer of a righteous man when love projects grace takes over and when grace takes over miracles happen healing happen healings happen all kinds of supernatural takes place because of the the Spirit of the Living God working in the length of the believer who he had made chosen shaped and formed and presented the personality and their and their position to be priests unto him that is why my friends the things of this world holds no attraction for us there is no magnet in the world for us that will pull us away for if he said if I be lifted up I will draw all men unto myself hallelujah I trust he draws you here tonight to himself or draws you a closer to him if you are a believer closer to him in your walk with Him closer to him in your talks with him your fellowship with him your prayer with him that he will draw you closer deeper higher every day walking in this wonderful precious way Thanks being a god hallelujah we are a peculiar people we are that speckled bird spoken of in the Bible speckled by the blood of its mate Oh glory to God and loosed by his blood set free by the blood of Jesus Christ because He died for us we do not let friends have to bear that condemnation anymore we are a peculiar people chosen of God and crawled by the spirit set up part vessels for his glory and for his honor here we are brother sisters Lord and God people that are his new creation my father worked Hitler to and now I work my father worked in the natural creation to bring that into being now I work for the spiritual creation the new creation and I want to say I'm a new creation I'm a brand new man I've been washed in the blood of Jesus I'm born again by the grace of God I hope you are of the same creation of the blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah and so we are created in him to be like him to walk like him Oh as the songwriter says to be like Jesus to be like Jesus on earth I'd long to be like him all true life's journey from Earth to glory all I ask Lord is to be like him may God help you may God forgive you may God wash you may God cleanse you and present you faultless before his throne so that we all can be like him god bless you my friends good to have been with you here tonight for this short study and next week we will continue as continue to introduce this subject of the seven churches which we will get into age by age later on but right now we present this to prepare your hearts prepare your minds for pin your thoughts for the word of God which is to come may God bless you and we'll see you again here next Wednesday night at 7:30 God watch between us until we gather here again [Music]
