you yours included because we share the same trials and the victories and yes we don't always like the trials but without the trials we won't have the victory we couldn't have this personal experience with this amazing God and to know him as God and to be a part of this God and the benefits that of kn knowing this God and how great he is to us it just blows my mind my heart just begins to psate with joy as yours and so he laid this song upon my heart I I really didn't practice I just spoke to Abigail this morning so Grace if you can please put up this song that we all know isn't he wonderful you know Satan is a fraudster I have you have blessings that the Lord has allotted for you and he wants to come into your account and take what belongs to you and you have to fight for everything that he has already given you he it's not that he's going to give you he's given it to us already it's yours and it's mine just think about that I didn't have to work for this he just gave it to me God gave me this salvation and I didn't deserve it I didn't do anything for it and he gave it to me he said I will give you a portion of my life and with it comes the benefits of everything that this God is to us when you think about that you're richer than you think I don't care what the bank says well I kind of have to do but you're richer than you think I began to spend the wealth and Riches of this Lord even before I knew him he didn't just put a canopy over my life today he did it before the foundation of this world you had full coverage before the foundation of this world so if that's not

um to minister a couple of services here and um our title is come and see come and see and so we're we're um invited to come and see um and to encounter and to witness the power of God in our lives to be able to partake of the greater things that we as Sons and Daughters of God have have inherited this is our inheritance this is who we are and by responding to that invitation we can uh see our lives being transformed we can experience his love we can be changed we can be delivered amen I want to encourage you to embrace this journey because it's a journey of Revelation it's a Journey of Faith amen knowing that following the Lord Jesus Christ means we can truly see amazing things in our lives and partake of the greater things that he has in store for us amen praise God and so our uh scripture this morning is from St John you can go to slide number four chapter 1 ver 32-42 and John bear record saying I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove and and it Abode upon him and I knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom Thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost and I saw and bear record that this is the Son of God again the next day after John stood and two of his disciples and looking Upon Jesus as he walked he saith Behold the Lamb of God and the two disciples heard him speak and they followed Jesus then Jesus turned and saw them following and saith unto them what seek ye they said unto him Rabbi which is to say being interpreted Master where dwellest thou he an he asked them a question and they respond to him with a question I believe they were excited they wanted to know listen where are you going because wherever you go we are going to follow amen glory to God he saith unto them come and see they came and saw where he dwelt and Abode with him that day for it was about the 10th hour one of the two which heard John speak and followed him was Andrew Simon Peter's brother he first findeth his own brother Simon and saith unto him we have found the Messiahs which is being interpreted the Christ and he brought him to Jesus and when Jesus beheld him he said Thou Art Simon the son of Jonah Thou shalt be called sephus which is by interpretation a stone let us pray father we're grateful this morning Lord and one of the things that we're most grateful for father is that one day you spoke to our hearts and you said come and see and Lord You've opened our understanding beyond anything that we could have possibly imagined and Lord you continue to do it you continue to move through our lives and our and our walks with you father that Lord you have become alive in our lives and a living testimony in the midst of our lives and the people that that we that we move around and and and fellowship with here on this Earth Lord may you take control direct us and guide us in these few thoughts Lord may your anointing just come and Lord refresh us with your presence and Lord may we see and may we sense your your anointing like the video said come and experience the Living God Lord grant it today Father meet every need in our midst in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you Saints glory to God what a what a an interesting thing when when you see how Jesus you know starts out his ministry and you know one of the first phrases that he makes when when um you know he comes into his public Ministry he's asked you know he's asked where you know Lord where where are you going he turns he says he ask the people he says what are you looking for and the first thing they say is Lord where are you going we wanna we want to be with you we want to know you but what's interesting what's more interesting is that we see that they received this this call upon their lives it came through John the Baptist it came came by them following him first it came because John had entered into his ministry he had come into His placing of the word of God and when someone gets into their position in the word of God and have recognized the Living God they start to become like a beacon they start to become like a a place where people can get answers and where people can receive Direction and instruction and so you know um I want to look at today I want to take a look at you know this whole uh principle that that the Lord Jesus has given us to follow him and to come and see and you know I want to lay in some some simple principles today around witnessing and how witnessing is is a powerful part of our Lives once we've become uh awakened to the word of God for our day and for this hour and so you know one of the things um you know as I was uh doing some study I came across certain polls and studies now I want you to understand you know to to be a witness in this day and in this hour in a world that we're living in where everything is really against Christians yeah it's it's you know we've come to a place where you know it's becoming harder and harder harder for people to testify you know about Jesus Christ and about his salvation and that he is the one and only true way to Salvation you got to be politically correct these days in the things that you're saying you got to be careful what you're saying because people get offended you know when you when you try to express you know your Zeal and your desire for them to come to know the Lord Jesus Christ and you know when you're living in an age where you know more than 60% of adults in Christian churches say that they don't share the gospel one of the main reasons is because they don't know methods to do it in today's culture they they're finding it difficult to to be politically correct in in the way that they bring Jesus Christ to the people you know um but but uh there was a research done by LifeWay research and it was entitled evangelism explosion study of America Christians openness to talking about faith and it was a survey done in 2022 and the survey found that 54% of the participants said they are either willing or eager when asked what they think about telling others about Jesus Christ so half of them were willing and eager however 52% of Americans who identify as Christians believe that encouraging someone to change their religious beliefs is offensive and disrespectful this is the kind of world that we live in and 66% of the Christians are not familiar with ways by which they can share Jesus Christ to the people but we know that the greatest way is to live his word amen is to be a living testimony of Jesus Christ amen to to to express him in our daily lives to share that he's a Healer when you come across somebody that's sick to share that he's a savior when you come across somebody that's down and out to share that that that that he can take away your sin because of your shame because people are are are are in shame and you know they don't know how they can come out of their shame and and out of their their their sin and and all the mistakes that they've made in their lives but when we share that Jesus Christ is a is a savior and he's a he's he's the only one that can actually forgive your sins to the point where they would be remembered no more that's powerful when you can share that testimony 68% of those pulled responded and believe that it is the responsibility of the pastor to equip the congregation to share the gospel and 69% agreed that it's the responsibility of Christians to encourage non-christians to trust Christ as their savior the survey revealed that 70% of Christians have not shared with a stranger now on how to become a Christian in the past six months so they they asked him in the last six months how many of you have actually shared your faith and 70% of them said they had not 93% say they are at least somewhat open to having a conversation about faith with a friend but only 52% actually shared a story about their faith in God additionally 57% say they have not invited a friend to church over the last six months you see it's becoming more and more difficult to share Jesus Christ but today we want you to know that all you need to do is come and see come and see that the Lord is good come and see that he's still God he's the only one that can save he's the only one that can heal he's the only one that can wipe away your sin amen hallelujah see the real reason that people don't witness Christ is because we're at war with this sinful nature you see you're born in sin you're shaped in iniquity and you're speaking lies until you receive the new birth you are at war with this flesh and your and your human nature your carnal mind is at enity with God and we're constantly being distracted Ed by the lust of the flesh or by the pride of life or by the Temptations that are constantly being thrown Upon Us in social media I mean you can barely go down the street and not get hit with a billboard of of uh of something that's you know either a a woman that's not fully dressed or just the way that that that things are being uh you know advertise these days it's a constant Temptation Upon Our flesh but we need to recognize that and we need to put on the helmet of faith we need to allow Jesus Christ to come into our lives so that so that he can set a new standard in our lives God will never tempt you with those things go to the next Slide the scripture says in James 13:14 let no man say when he is tempted I am tempted of God God is not going to tempt you God is not going to test you in those areas it's the enemy and it's it's your own lustful desires it says here I that for God cannot be tempted with evil evil not neither tempted he any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed and allows those enticements and those Temptations and those lusts to take us over amen there's also other issues that are at work in today's world and and what we're seeing is that there's no fear of God there's no real fear of God the reality of God we claim that we'll all stand before him you know in the Judgment but yet we're living like we really don't believe that he's real that's why you'll talk to people about the Lord Jesus he has not become a reality to them yet but it takes him revealing himself to you personally when you open yourself and you and you come and see that the Lord can do some great things in your lives am a while back there was a story in the newspaper we're talking about how how there's you know how God is not you know it's he's not real to the people and so a while back I found this on the internet a while back there was a story in the newspaper of the US Naval Academy in Ann Anapolis Maryland about a group of ships that were on a training Mission these are naval ships they had been in Maneuvers when a huge storm Came Upon them nightfell invisibility was poor it was foggy and raining so the captain remained on the bridge keeping an eye on things and all of a sudden the lookout on the bow reported light bearing steady on the starboard bow which means that something was headed straight for the ship the captain called for the signal man and said signal that ship we are on a collision course we advise you to change course 20° back came the signal we advise you to change course 20° the captain had the signal send another message I am a captain of the United States Navy change course 20° the reply came back I am a seaman second class you change course 20° by now the captain was Furious he yelled to the signal men tell them we are in a battleship change course 20° back came the reply I am in a lighthouse and the captain quickly changed his course you see God is a lighthouse amen he's the same yesterday today and forever he does not change the Bible tells us that God is a lighthouse because he never changes he's 13 he's Hebrews 138 the same yesterday today and forever this is the foundation and this is the one thing that that that people individuals are failing to rec recognize that Jesus Christ like it says right back there on the wall he's the same he does not change and so it really doesn't matter how the world changes around us and what becomes acceptable by culture and by by by government we've seen that they've let down all the bars we've seen that they've that they've you know passed bills and rights you know gay rights and you know gender rights and all these different things we've seen them that they've passed all these things and it goes to show that God is not real to them amen but when God becomes a reality to you because now this reality is not so listen God is not trying to convert governments God is not looking to convert Nations he's only going to convert one nation and that's the the nation of Israel because they are his chosen people and according to scripture God will deal with them directly right now he's dealing like we were preaching over the last few weeks about the Gentile dispensation he's dealing with Gentiles when Jesus came he came and he realized that they did not receive him the the Jewish Nation this the the the nation of Israel could not receive him as a nation but he said said we he would go to the Gentiles to take a wife out of the Gentiles to call a church out of the Gentiles amen and so no matter how much they change the laws of society and turn them against God God will never change his word God will never change his position amen glory to God Amen God is still the same his commands are still the same his character is still the same his attributes are still the same amen and what God calls evil and what God calls good doesn't change with the times amen praise God and so we'll either turn and and Obey God's word or we'll be crushed by God's word amen will be crushed by the prophecy that is coming down upon this Earth Jesus Christ is inviting you this morning to come and see and to come and and experience the reality of what it is to know him in the power of his resurrection thank you Jesus Hallelujah so here now we see Jesus entering into his public Ministry and he's and and and and what's he doing he's immediately calling disciples immediately unveiling himself making himself known and only a few actually recognized who he was and what we want to look at is that these principles of how Christ calls has not changed the way he did it 2,000 years ago he does it today he does not change amen praise God and what we're going to be looking at specifically are three principles okay and they are around witnessing and how you know how we can even notice and recognize how it how it moved through the disciples and how you may or may not be conscious of it now but it's actually moving through you amen it's the way that God is reaching his sons and his daughters and so um in in researching other studies which I found on the internet regarding Christian churches I found that most of them List personal evangelism as the most neglected by Christians today people are afraid to to witness and to let people know that Jesus Christ is a reality but let him come in one time let him change your life in the same way that he did when when blind barus was standing on the side of the road and said Son of David have mercy upon me let that happen just once I promise you you will be a true witness am you will become a true witness and you will you you will not be able to contain what God has done in your life amen praise God hallelujah when we look at John the Baptist we look to see how he was actually expressing these three principles the first thing we see here is that John the Baptist wasn't just ministering or speaking he was walking what he was speaking he was he told them who he was they came to him they asked him who are you you know what are you all about and he all he could tell him was what the word said I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord he was one that God had anointed to prepare for his first coming amen remember he said he's just a forerunner he told him I am not the Christ I'm just trying to point people to him amen now he gets the opportunity to prove that John's got followers John had people that he had actually discipled because he had you know he had been ministering and and and crying out that the king is coming prepare the way the king is coming and we got the same message the king is here our message is that the king is here you need to receive the word for your day and recognize that Jesus Christ can come into your life into your personal walk and change you today amen amen praise God hallelujah so he had these he had these followers he got these disciples he gained recognition and now the question was is he going to be able to let go of what he built see a lot of preachers will build churches and they want to they want to build thousands and thousands of people into the church but they want them to follow them and they're not telling the people what they need to hear they're not telling them about Sin they're not telling them about what it really is to be a woman or to be a true man as a son or a daughter of God they're afraid to tell them the truth which is what is going to liberate them but they are teaching teaching them like the blind leading the blind amen and not leading them directly back to the word of God and if the blind lead the blind they'll both fall into the ditch but here John the Baptist you know he recognized and so he displayed the very first principle he had the right motives in his heart he knew that his his calling was one thing to point individuals to Jesus Christ and we as Sons and Daughters of God we have one calling Upon Our Lives and that is not to point people to a church to a membership to a building but they need to be pointed to Jesus Christ who is the only one and true savior amen the first principle let's go to the next slide it is never about us it's all about Jesus that's principle number one it's not about us but it's about what Jesus did for us we tell them our testimony we let them know what God has what God has done in our lives and how he's changed and how he's delivered us from from you know addictions and and from from Pain and broken relationships and and healed our bodies when when there was we were given up by the doctors the doctors said no hope but yet he was their hope amen Not only was he their hope he was their deliverer amen amen it's all about Jesus we must Point people to Christ John makes it clear when he says I must decrease so that he can increase he recognize what he had to do he had to let go of his past let go of of of you know his disciples let go of everything that that that he had you know known he had to let it all go so that Jesus could increase so that the people's eyes would be taken away from him and put on Jesus Christ he's the one who forgives our sins he's the one who heals us John pointed his disciples to Jesus Christ so pointing his disciples to Jesus Christ the Savior showed that he was successful in pointing others to Christ and Andrew and other disciples left John and recognized who they needed to follow it's like in this day we need to recognize who we are following we're not following William Branham just like John the Baptist he was the spirit of Elijah to come and turn the hearts of the people to hear the coming of the Lord he was the voice announcing his first coming but when he had fulfilled his his ministry he decreased so that Christ could increase and today we're living in a time where this message is in that same condition and people are not realizing and recognizing that the second Elijah like it says the one that would turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers and the faith of the fathers back to the heart of the children that Ministry has been fulfilled and when he came to fulfill that Ministry it was for one purpose to point the people to Jesus Christ and that they should follow him and here we have perfect examples in Andrew because what did Andrew do the first thing that he did was he went immediately and told his brother Simon and I want you to notice what what takes place you see when when Andrew was awakened to the reality of God and that now he was following the Messiah the Christ the anoint he was God made flesh he recognized that the word that was in the beginning had been made flesh and was there right before them and immediately he went to tell Andrew he went to or Andrew went to tell Simon and then you'll see that Andrew he brought many to Christ he brought Nathaniel to Christ he brought many to Christ BEC oh no Philip actually brought Nathaniel sorry but these disciples they they got converted and the first thing they did was they LED them immediately to Christ they didn't run them back to John the Baptist and if you're running people back to William brandham you're missing the the the the the the transition and what God is actually doing in this hour you could never leave will just like we couldn't leave out John the Baptist he's part of the scripture he had his part in the word of God and he fulfilled his part in the word of God Amen but then he had to decrease so that Christ could increase so that Jesus Christ could take over because it wasn't it wasn't uh you know William Branham that forgave my sins I know there's a lot of people that even want to make him deity they want to make him God they want to listen to the tapes and only the tapes and that is and what he says is what it is and nothing more nothing less if what he says is with the word it's thus sayeth the Lord it's as simple as that and there wasn't one time that when he did say thus sayeth the Lord that it was wrong because God was standing behind his word for that day amen and today now we are progressing and we and we need to look at the examples that we're seeing here from the scripture because remember Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever when he came on the scene and they asked Jesus uh you know and Jesus asked them where they're going and they asked Jesus where they're going Jesus didn't turn them to say well go back to John the Baptist the only time he told the people to go back to John the Baptist is because John had gotten into a condition while he was in jail and he had the he actually had to send out a message to say is is he really the one and Jesus says you can go and tell him you can go and tell him that yes I am the one and people need to recognize the hour that we're living in so that they can get with the program they can walk with God in this day and in this hour so that they can receive the rapturing faith that you need in order to be changed and translated because the message for this hour power is the rapture he's already come and you didn't know it he's already in the church and he's Gathering his people he's already perfecting Sons and Daughters of God and bringing them into the unity of the faith so that they can unite into the body and when that last Gentile gets into the body in the moment and in the twinkling of an eye that body is going to be changed and if you're in that body you're in the safest place on Earth right now come and see and so principle number two next slide says make sure you are seeking Jesus for the right reasons see a lot of people they're seeking Jesus for different reasons you know because there's a few different jesuses out there Believe It or Not amen but you know he asked them what are you looking for what seek ye you got to know what you're looking for you gotta you got to know what God requires in this day and in this hour it's not just joining Church people feel Justified because they belong to the Catholic church or the Baptist Church or the Presbyterian church or the Pentecostal Church even in churches within this message feeling Justified that they just belong to that church so if they just belong to that church that believes that God sent a prophet they're going to go in the Rapture people that came out from Martin with Martin Luther came out of the count Catholic Church they had to recognize why they had come out if they were only just following him because he was German and they were German then they're going to miss the real experience you see Luther experienced Jus he he experienced justification by faith he received his own revelation of who Christ was and that's what Drew him away and pulled him out of the Catholic church because he met the Personal Jesus am and you need to meet the Personal Jesus and today there's people right within the confines of this message that have not met the Personal Jesus because all they can see is is is Elijah the prophet and they're missing the one that he's he's only the signpost that was pointing them to Christ so there's you know different Jesus is now the reason we're saying this because it's so [Music] important the first recorded words of Jesus in John's gospel was what is it that you're seeking and it's important for us to ask that question why are we seeking the Lord what is it that we are looking for you know is it wealth is it health you know is is it the Prosperity Gospel that you're looking for because you're not going to find Jesus there there's a lot of churches that are built on the Prosperity Gospel this church is built upon the word of God am this church is the word of God Amen this church cannot deny the word of God it will not put Prosperity before the word first comes the word and everything else follows the word we're not looking for a Prosperity Gospel we're not looking for a savior who who doesn't who doesn't uh uh condemn sin sin is unbelief in the word of God it's not cheating lying stealing those are not sin those are the attributes of sin those are the results of you disbelieving the word of God when a man or a woman commits adultery it's because they don't believe God's word it's as simple as that and they need to know that it's a sin they need to know that there is sin they need to know that that that that you can't just live any way that you want and still call yourself a Christian Jesus said come follow me when you follow Christ you're following in his footsteps he knows that you're human he knows that you're still in a human vessel and so he knows that you're going to make mistakes so don't think that I'm here trying to preach a a gospel of perfection the word is perfect but you and I we could never be perfect like we said earlier we are we are drawn by our own lusts and and enticed by the Temptations that are constantly around us our carnal mind is constantly at enity against the word of God and so we need to realize that that that we are fighting a real battle but he said I'll be with you I'll be in you I'll be there to take you all all the way through amen praise God so we're looking for that for that's you know the new age Jesus is the one that doesn't condemn sin oh you can be you know you're you're just a part of the universe and you can you know oh well if you make a mistake in this life you'll get a chance at another life they'll tell you about reincarnation that's the new age Jesus that's not the Jesus that we follow we follow the Jesus of the Bible the one who is the same yesterday today and forever amen so what are you looking for what do you expect from following Christ what are you seeking it's a great question because it's it's it it gets right to the motivation of your heart it gets right to where you are right now and you know like sometimes you meet people and you got to get them to that place where they can be completely honest and and right from the depths of their heart bring out a real motive for coming to Christ some people wait until you know it gets to the absolute emergency situation you know like our brother coffee here listen he's been serving God he's been praying he's been a part of The Prayer Ministry he's given testimonies over and over where God delivered him he knows that God is a deliverer amen even at the even right there at the at the cusp of where he was crossing over between death and life he still knew that Christ was in control that he was still more than able and if it was God's time to take him so be it and that's the way we should we should have the that kind of a relationship with Christ that we don't fear death We Don't Fear the things that this world can throw upon us whether it be natural disaster or whether it be sickness because remember what we said earlier God is a light house he's a steady place that we can turn to amen he doesn't change the listen the conditions around our lives might change all of a sudden sickness might come through the front door but Jesus doesn't change he's still the same he stays right there right where he was right where he was from before the foundations of the the world where he says I am the Lord thy God that Health thee and so he doesn't change but circumstances might change around our lives and I know brother Gabriel he was in that situation when he got to Italy where where he was in so much pain he didn't know where to turn he didn't know what to do but God was more than able to come on the scene and deliver him thank you Jesus [Applause] and so we don't want to be approaching God as a stranger we want to approach him by a relationship something that's real in our lives it's a reality that we can know that listen situations will come emergencies will come circumstances will rise up the enemy will tell you that you're lost the enemy will come and tell you that you're not a son or a daughter of God but it's at those times where he says be still and know that I am God I don't change if I revealed myself to you the first time and I told you the first time that you are my child and that you are saved stand right there let the circumstances be what they are but you stand thank you Lord hallelujah so Jesus asked them you know what are you seeking and they answer the question with a question where are you staying but their answer question shows their motivation they're saying Jesus we want to spend time with you we want to get to know you better we've recognized that you are the Messiah because John told us all about you he said that you would do this that that you would do that and that's exactly what you're doing because how could Andrew you know go to Simon Peter bring Simon right back to Jesus and right there and then Simon Peter had a call upon his life how did he receive that call when Jesus says hey Simon hey I your name is actually sephus which means Stone in other words I'm giving you revelation of who you are and immediately Simon Peter recognized that whoa hang on a minute this is this is a reality and until you've had that kind of an experience where you come into church or where you where you come to a place and God speaks to you and reveals himself to you discerns your life tells you where you were tells you the condition that you were in in and tells you now that you have been delivered until that time until that experience takes place he can't really become the reality and the and the and the real true Living God in your life that's the kind of experience that we want that's why Jesus said come and see and when you come to Jesus you're going to see whether he is a reality or not but you need to come face to face you don't come with your own ideas you don't come with your own doctrines you don't come because your your your teachings tell you this that that he's a trinity that he's this or no no you come to God and you come you come pure of heart you come with the right motives you come with the right reasons and then God can look right into your heart you see when brother brandham was standing in all of those prayer lines he was waiting for the Holy Spirit to make contact with the spirit that was in the individual brother brandham stood in those prayer lines and hundreds of thousands of people were healed throughout his ministry we don't know how many thousands of people but it wasn't William Branham that healed any of those people it was was always Jesus Christ the angel of God the mighty Angel himself that would connect with the spirit of the individual just like Jesus when he did it with Simon Peter he connected immediately with it with his spirit and told him who he was and at that moment Peter knew who he was he understood that Jesus was a reality that he was that he was not just just a preacher you know a lot of people can hear uh me speak on the word of God and you know and they can hear the Zeal and and and what you know the the passion that I have for the word of God but until they experience that passion and they experience Christ in the power of his resurrection in their personal life they cannot know the True Deliverance and we are listen we're no better than anybody else we need to we need to you know some some people are so quick to judge you know they'll see something and they'll they'll see like you know somebody that's you know not properly dressed or you know they you know oh and and they might even see you with them oh yeah and they're going to say oh yeah oh oh yeah he's a pastor look at who he's hanging out with meanwhile Jesus when he was here on the earth he had a group around him that the people were saying look at this he's hanging out with prostitutes what he's going to Peter's house does he know who Peter is does he know who Matthew is he's he's he's he's taking all our money you see Jesus himself said I did not come for the righteous I have come for those that are sick and need a healing they need Deliverance he's still in the saving business he's still he's still the same God that that wants to speak to individuals and bring them to him first yes once you've come to him and your eyes of understanding are open and you've and like like John said he's the one that will baptize you with the Holy Ghost ghost you see John recognized he was baptizing them into the water he was baptizing them for for the Forgiveness of their sins but there was one that was going to come that would baptize with the Holy Ghost which is the spirit of God his own Spirit God's Own spirit in you and it's that that delivers you from your sickness it's that that delivers you from your bondage it's that that delivers you from your sin it's that that delivers you from the mental oppression and the and the and the uh mental health issues that you're going through right now it's by receiving the Holy Ghost that's why John said you need to receive the Holy Ghost he's the one that will baptize you with the Holy Ghost that's why it's so important to follow him and have the right reasons for approaching him Hallelujah praise God Amen Jesus says come and see and they go and they stay with him for the rest of the day their desire was to know him better to have a personal relationship with him because they knew that he was the Messiah the Savior the one that would bring the kingdom of God to the Earth let's go to the next slide principle number number three says when you have come into a genuine personal relationship with Jesus you just can't keep it to yourself that's a reality and anybody that's ever experienced that Born Again experience where he opens your understanding to see the word of God like you have never seen it before you know I can only share my own experience I know that you know when I came to the Lord and you've heard it many times it wasn't because I recognized that God had sent a prophet it's because I was in a condition God allowed me God allowed you and many of us to get into certain conditions in our lives where he could get our attention and when when when when he drew my attention by delivering me supernaturally from a drug addiction and then placed his Spirit upon me I became like a house on fire I couldn't help it nobody could tell me that he was not a living God because that's what we're being invited to come and see the Living God not some man-made teaching not some interpretation New Age interpretation not some Prosperity Jesus the Living God and that experience was genuine in my life to the point where for the next number of years I was a firehouse out of control people thought I was a bit out of my mind but that reality could never be taken away from me and I wanted everybody to know I wanted everybody to know that hey he's real this Jesus that they've been you know I was a kid in Catholic School in Catholic Church I was an altar boy I would go up there and I would ring those bells and I would go into the back there where the priests were and I would grab the wine as a kid and I would try to sneak some of the wine I I was living that God that they were talking about that they would do certain things about that people would talk about I never knew him but now I know him now I know that he's real now I know that he's a reality and not only that but he's got a message in this day and in this hour that is going to translate the true Christian Church out of this Dimension which by the way I don't have to tell you that the world is falling apart just turn on any news station and listen for a couple of hours and you will find out that this whole world is in chaos Wars there's serious Wars going on right now there's the biggest war taking place right now in the Middle East that is going to lead to something of mass mass tribulation that's not because I'm saying it it's because every prophecy and the way that is Israel is fulfilling prophecy has been written thousands of years ago and we can read it right in the Bible right in the in the Old Testament and in the New Testament we can read word for word exactly what is taking place right now in the world that was written thousands of years ago and exactly how it's going to play out and the reason why we can see it as clear as we do and we stand upon it is because he's placed his spirit in us to recognize the word and that's why you cannot convert people this is not about converting people to Christ this is about invitation this is about inviting them to come and see and come and experience what it is to receive the Holy Ghost I remember I remember when I started coming to church and and and and the word started to unveil itself to me and and I went to Pastor Simon and I I went directly to him and I said pastor Simon I want the Holy Ghost you've been talking about the Holy Ghost as the power it's it's what delivers it's what sets you free it it's what transforms you gives you the ability to see and to recognize I want that and he looked at me he goes brother you got it you got it it's all over you he's already done it he's awakened you but that should be the desire when when you come to Christ you should have that desire to to want his spirit in you because it's the one that's going to deliver it's the one that sets you free it's the one that's going to make this old body young again thank you Jesus it's the one that's going to change and take this Mortal and make it Immortal you either believe God's word or you don't believe God's word once you start to read the word by the Holy Ghost in you that's what the spirit says gives life to the word of God once that begins to take place everything becomes real to you everything that the word says about the change in Corinthians that in a moment in the twinkling of an eye we shall be changed and we will move from this Dimension right into another dimension a lot of people are already listen if you do your research they're already recognizing that there that there are other dimensions outside of this Dimension God has given you an attribute like a ticket that will transform you in a moment into that other dimension and then this world is going to go into total and complete complete chaos I'm going to wind it right down here and we'll continue next week listen to brother brandom here from convinced then concerned and I believe it's important that we as individuals be convinced not because somebody convinced you not because somebody you know forced you you oh you got to come to this church this is the listen yeah you want to invite them to church because you don't know what's behind that Veil you don't know if God has placed a portion of himself in there because Jesus says my sheep hear my voice no man comes to the father but by me in other words you can't come to me in the fullness unless I draw you unless I call you that's important to understand that's when you become convinced listen and these disciples brother Bram speaking here in the message convinced and concerned 1962 he says these disciples took right off after Jesus let the musicians come and he looked around he found them and he said what seek ye they said Rabbi being interpreted Master where dwellest thou he said come and see now that's a wonderful invitation come and see I like that that's what philli said to Nathaniel when Nathaniel said could there be any good thing come out of Nazareth he said come and see so then come find out don't sit at home and criticize come find out see come see for yourself now they said it now now they said it was evening time so Andrew stayed all night oh that's a good way he stayed until he was convinced what that man had told him that night what he had said to him or what he did there was something that completely convinced Andrew that he was the Messiah you see you got to stay with Jesus long enough a lot of people they just don't want to sit and listen they don't want to sit and and and and read the word of God they don't want to read the word and then go and pray you know that that's how God speaks to you I'm challenging you here today and those that are out there on on the air take the time to sit long enough to allow his voice to speak to you through the word of God and through prayer then you will become convinced that he's a reality amen and so he was the Messiah the next day really early I imagine he grabbed his coat and hat and took down cuz Peter was going to be fishing down on the river and he said come see who we found it's the Messiah he was convinced when he was perfectly convinced that it was the Messiah he was concerned about his brother oh praise God let me tell you I remember I went right to my family I I wanted every single one of my brother my sister my mom my dad we brought my mother to the church we baptized her we did everything that we you know we were concerned because you know to us this was a reality and and the world was going to start going into a a terrible condition and and Jesus was the only way true and life and so we would we would we would be so concerned we want to tell everybody just like here he says that's what's the matter tonight people are not convinced of the message people are not convinced about the Holy Ghost if you really get convinced then you're concerned you'll do everything you can do ever what you got to do with say well brother brandom I'm not a preacher well you can do something too remember one time I had a meeting there was a farmer got saved and filled with the Holy Ghost and he only had nothing but his experience with a truck but he hauled so many to the meeting he got 30 more filled with the Holy Ghost reminds me of brother Gabriel he got so blessed and anointed by the word of God that he had a van that could fit 12 13 people and I was one of those people that he put into that van and said come on man come and see what God can do amen he didn't know that I needed Deliverance he didn't know that I was that I was caught up on in a drug addiction he had no idea but Jesus knew Jesus knew the time Jesus knew the season and Jesus knows each and every one of us exactly where we're at amen praise God and he's going to use whatever you make available to him all you need to do is be become convinced first that he's a reality and he only had nothing but his experience in his truck and he hauled so many to the meeting he got 30 more filled with the Holy Ghost before why he was convinced and when he was convinced he was concerned a little daughter got healed he had sick people every night a truck full of them bringing them from everywhere got 30 got the Holy Ghost see he was convinced that it was right so he was concerned about somebody else and we're and if we are convinced that Jesus is coming soon we'll be concerned about our loved ones we'll be doing all we can to get the gospel out next week we're going to continue with this and we're going to we're going to look at the greater things that God can do and how he's doing it and we're going to bring it more I this was just to lay in a foundation of the principles and to to show you that that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever these principles do not change we need to come to him the right way and when we come to him the right way and we know that it's all about him then it leads us to to to you know lead others to Christ we check our motives and and we know why we've come we recognize why he's called us and we lead others in the same way this is not just about preaching the Seven Seals even though that's what we're preaching it's not about all the great Mysteries and about condemning you for the way that you're living right now and condemning you for for not recog izing this or recognizing that this is about you experiencing the love of God so that you can humble yourself before him and be filled with his spirit hallah and when that happens everything else automatically takes over that's where he starts to take over and then all of a sudden you become like Andrew these two men had previously been following John the Baptist but spending one evening with Jesus they immediately go out and tell everybody that they possibly can when's the last time you invited somebody into the house of the Lord don't be ashamed invite them don't be ashamed to come come with the right motive in your heart God will speak to you God will do something miraculous for you amen glory to God hallelujah praise God let us stand next week we're going to look at the promises of greater things amen we're going to experience some of the reality of what God wants to do in our lives and what he is doing to bring this mystical Body of Christ back in unity glory to God father Lord this is a very simple but profound word of God it shows how you have never changed you're still a lighthouse you're still a stronghold you're still the same God and you don't change and that's what gives us the confidence to
