to the word this morning amen father we are truly grateful this morning Lord to be assembled in your presence once again Lord it's it's what changes everything it's what changed our lives it's what a truly has brought us to the uh reality of your presence and and that you are God and that you alone stand father and that there is none beside thee none before thee none after thee you are the living one and true God and so we ask your presence this morning to come and anoint the word and just Inspire our hearts as we speak Lord and Inspire Our Lives as we hear the word of God this morning may it translate us change us and give us what we have need of in this hour in Jesus Christ's name amen praise God let's go to the first slide this morning we're going to continue along the lines of the thought of rapturing faith we'll be looking at part three today and our thought this morning is the voice of the Thunders and we're going to be looking um at the word and uh you know we need to realize that this message that God has given us um that has called us out is a unique message it's not something that uh you know that is being preached in all the churches out there um we are a church that have been called by the Living God when somebody asks oh you know what is your church I tell them we are a continuation of the book of Acts it's not the acts of the people but it's the acts of the Holy Ghost in the people and that is our experience that the Lord is continuing his program his plan that which he ordained for this world at this time and so we have recognized that God has done marvelous things that he's the same yesterday today and forever that he sent us a prophet in the 20th century and that we have recognized that God does nothing unless he first reveals it unto his servants the prophets that's what makes him the same yesterday today and forever a lot of people when you tell them you know that that God is the same yesterday today and forever and when he does something he doesn't change the way you can trust him is to know that he does things the same because he is the same amen amen praise God and so uh that reality is what transforms us as children of God to recognize that that we have a part in the word of God that God is doing something today and we're a part of that and that's what gives us Supernatural Faith to overcome the age that we're living in praise God so we're going to read this morning let's go to our first scripture a very familiar scripture Revelations 10 verses one to seven and the scripture says and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the son and his feet as pillars of Fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roarth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and right them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that are therein that that they're in our and the earth and the things that they're in our and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no more but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets our next scripture go to the next slide is from Deuteronomy 29 verse 29 it says the secret things belong unto the Lord our God but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever that we may do all the words of this law God bless you you may be seated amen praise God uh last week we were we were looking at um you know the maturity of the bride and we were looking at how the bride is coming into a level of maturity to recognize her placing in the word her position in the word and you know I want to read from a scripture here in Saint John chapter 12 verses 23 to 32 Jesus answered them saying the hour has come that the son of man should be glorified now you got to recognize the time and the season that Jesus was in he was in the stage where he was going to go into where he was gonna actually give himself at the cross he was going to back to his position as the father and here he's talking about verily verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die in abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit well we are that fruit vote because of the result of him going down and the seed that will come forth in the end will be the same seed that started in the beginning the same word that was there in Genesis Elohim was God the self-existent one is the same one that's going to finish up the whole program of God and everything that he had ordained that he had seen in the in his mind all that he had uh focused that he had that all that was done before the foundations of the world we're going to see it being fulfilled in our part in the word of God and how he's going to do it in and through US amen and so he says here he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal If any man serve me let him follow me and where I am there shall also my servant be if any man serve me him will my father honor now is my soul troubled and what shall I say father save me from this hour but for this cause came I into the world he knew his place he knew why he had come he knew why he had to go to Calvary he understood it there was nothing that would keep him from it amen but listen father glorify thy name then notice came there a voice from heaven saying I have both glorified it and will glorify it again he was looking down through time he was seen this day he was seeing the hour that that he was that that that everything would culminate to he knew that he had a purpose he knew that he wanted to redeem his sons and daughters he saw you he saw me he saw each and every one of us amen but notice here the people therefore that stood by and heard it said that it thundered others said an angel spoke to him Jesus answered and said the voice came not because of me but for your sakes now is the Judgment of this world now shall the prince of this world be cast out and I if I be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me praise God and so what I want you to note there is that when the Lord spoke it thundered it thundered and it wasn't for for Jesus sake but it was for our sake when the Thunders came forth that we've heard here from the scripture that we read there's a message within those Thunders there's the unwritten aspect of the word that is doing something in each and every one of our lives right now preparing us for one thing the rapture the body change the translation amen John was told don't write it he heard the Thunders uttered their voices and was about to write but what what could be the reason that he was told not to write it there's a reason to everything that's what we're going to be looking into we're looking into this thought and this understanding of the of the Thunders and the voice and we know that brother Branham said that when the Thunder went forth it was the voice of God it was the voice of the Resurrection there's a voice there's a supernatural voice right now that's thundering from this this Pulpit from every anointed Pulpit every Son of God under the five-fold ministry that recognizes their position in the word of God knows that God is thundering forth a message that is going to translate us that's going to give us the kind of faith that we need in order for these vile bodies to be changed in order for us to overcome the circumstances that we are dealing with right now in each and every one of our Lives because we got to deal with these circumstances we're human beings we're looking for a way to get out to to get by to to make enough money you know to to fulfill the goals and the desires that are in our hearts but God has such a greater calling Upon Our Lives he's got such a greater uh purpose for each and every one of us and he knows that you're going to need a special kind of faith to in order to overcome this Dimension amen glory to God Amen but he didn't write those things for a purpose those things are supernaturally revealed you cannot you cannot learn these things you cannot theologically teach yourself or go to a School of Theology to to learn and to receive the Revelation that God is placing in this day and in this hour the kind of Faith the rapturing faith that we need in order to fulfill the body change amen praise God hallelujah hallelujah so listen to brother Branham he speak he speaks here in the first seal he says the voice is a thunder The Voice came from where from the throne where the lamb had just left as intercessor so we realize now that when the time of the opening of the seals came there had to be an angel on the earth a messenger on the earth that would be the anointed word in order to bring about the opening of those seals remember the seals only covered they were they were sealing the book but inside the book there was Supernatural Faith Supernatural rapturing faith that would be released to the children of God at an appointed time and season it was not going to be any time before God's appointed time according to his word the other thing you need to note is that there's nothing that that was written under those seals that was not already written in the book so we're not looking for some you know uh new man to come on the scene we're not we're not there's nobody uh you know and certainly not me you know coming here to say that I've got something I've got a supernatural Revelation that I'm going to give you here today that is going to give you rapturing Faith No Sir everything that you have need of is already in you everything that you have need of God gave it to you from when before the foundations of the world anybody that's going in the Rapture their names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life when before the foundations of the world so we're not bringing anything here and we're going to say oh brother you are going to go in the Rapture and sister you're not going to go in the Rapture that has nothing to do with it the word attribute that's in you right now has already got a destination printed right into the genealogy of it there's nothing that can change your destination if you are ordained for the Rapture you can't miss it if you wanted to Hallelujah but what you need to come into is the season and the recognition of the word that's being fulfilled right now so that like brother Branham listen when brother Branham came to the opening of those seals he said this is the greatest time of my life he says of all the things that God has done for for us through the meetings and the the healings and the people that were raised from the dead the blinded eyes that were open he says it was marvelous but this there's never been a time like this why because he came to realize that he was that angel he was that seventh eighth Earthly angel now it wasn't brother Branham that opened the seals remember it was the mighty angel that came down put his foot on the land in the sea and said time shall be no more it was Christ coming down it was Christ himself that came down that that was going to open the word and release the names that were written in the Lamb's Book of Life hallelujah praise God so here he says now he is standing here to take his position he's left the throne as intercessor now at some point well first of all there's not going to be anybody added or taken away from the Lamb's Book of Life can we can we make that clear okay so so so intercessor Jesus when when the mighty angel came down he's come down now to claim his possessions he's he's already made intercession intercession was done from before the when the bleeding bloody lamb stepped out from the throne and had a book John was was crying because he he wanted to know if his name was in the book he needed to know that somebody could open that book that somebody could release and and he wanted to see if his name was in that book because he knew that something Supernatural was taking place he heard those Thunders he saw what was being written he saw he saw it but he was told don't write it you see everything was there a so so there's nothing new here that we're trying to bring but we're trying to bring each and every one of us into the place where we can understand where we're at brother Branham knew where he was at listen listen here he says now he is standing here to take his position and his claims but the thunder came from the inside of the throne thundered out and the lamb was standing out here the Thunder where the lamb had left the father's Throne to go to take his own throne Glory now don't miss it friends he says we all know as Christians that God swore to David that he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne and give him an everlasting kingdom here on Earth see brother Branham was seeing the Fulfillment of all the Prophecies of the Old Testament he was recognizing that something now was taking place of tremendous significance he did it and Jesus said he that overcomes the Antichrist and all the things of the world shall sit with me on my throne what have we seen in the church ages what did he say in the seventh Church age he said he that can overcome shall sit with me on my throne he's talking about a people that are going to sit with him that are going to rule with him for a thousand years remember this doesn't all end in the rapture and the whole thing's finished no that's just going to be another stage of the culmination of the Fulfillment of his complete plan amen there's still going to be another thousand years left here on this Earth after the Rapture of the three and a half years and the tribulation of the three and a half years we go for three and a half years but we come back got to see the big picture here God's preparing a people to rule to sit with him on his throne amen praise God and so listen so he did it and Jesus said he that overcomes the Antichrist and all the things of the world shall sit with me on my Throne as I have overcome and have sit down on my father's Throne now someday he rises from the father's throne and goes to take his own Throne amen now he comes forth to call his subjects how is he going to claim them he's already got the book of redemption in his hand so he's the only one that can claim his own amen he's already got the book of reject Glory he says oh I feel like singing to him soon the lamb will take his bride to be ever at his side all of hosts of heaven will assemble be Oh Glory to God soon he's taken his bride oh it will be a glorious sight all the saints in spotless white and with Jesus we shall Feast eternally you know you're often wonder and you think man what are we going to do for eternity has no beginning and no end well you're getting a little glimpse of it right now you're feasting on Revelation you're feasting on the glory of God the presence of God that all things can can be possible in your life right now everything that you desire as a son or a daughter of God you've got to recognize your position and that all that everything that you have need of is already provided Within you as an attribute of God Amen praise God oh my talk about sitting now in Heavenly places what will it be if we can feel this way sitting down here on Earth before the Rapture comes in this condition that we're in now and we can enjoy and stand up around walls and Stand in the Rain just to hear this what will it be when we see him sitting there oh my oh it'll be a glorious time amen praise God forevermore let's go to the next slide so Revelation uh brother Brown 1961 he says here now the voice of the throne notice in this Throne Before the Throne was the Seven Stars the voice of the Stars the voices you see there are more in the Revelation four or five here we find out and out of the throne preceding Lightnings Thunders and voices not one voice voices plural what was it God's speaking to the church reflecting himself through the seven spirits amen God can reflect he it's all God we need to come to realize that this program that God has designed it to fulfill his word is Christ in you your hope of glory it is the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwelling in you that is going to Quicken you and take you from this Mortal to immortality and so God speaking to the church reflecting himself through the seven spirits when the true anointed of God speaks it's the voice of God to reject it is to remove the Candlestick see voices the voices of the seven churches over here in the corner the voice is speaking with thunder and lightning and so we need to recognize the importance of recognizing William Miriam Branham as the seventh Church age messenger that God sent in order to fulfill Malachi 4 5 and Revelations 10 7. go to the next slide there was two Ministries of William Miriam Branham one was the messenger of Malachi 4 5 and Revelations 10 7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers now by the by the revealing of the word by the opening of those Seven Seals there was released a supernatural understanding of the word of God things that brother Branham himself said that had not the angel there were seven angels that came to meet him every night while he was opening those seals and he says if the angel had not come to reveal to him what was actually written under that seal he'd have made a mistake and he wouldn't have brought forth that that white horse rider was actually Satan going out to conquer you see that was one of the Mysteries that was written under the word but it was always in the word it was just that it wasn't revealed everything that we have need of is all in the word it just wasn't revealed yet and so when those seals were open uh so so so when those seals were open brother Branham actually fulfilled Malachi 4 5. by turning the hearts of the children it was a supernatural Faith now that was being revealed through his ministry the godhead all those things were being revealed through his ministry right from when he started out and it was a supernatural Revelation that was being released to the Sons and Daughters of God and because you were an attribute of God ordained to this message ordained to this calling this dispensation you recognize the word you don't know how you recognized it you didn't understand how you recognized it but something in you thundered within your heart something spoke to you and said that's the truth that makes sense so the opening of the word released a faith to turn you back to the word of God to the pure word of God a lot of us were in denominations in Catholic churches and Baptist Churches Pentecostal churches we have been going to church it's not a matter of going to church it wasn't a matter of reading from the Holy Bible anybody can read from from the Bible and many people are reading from the Bible but there's there's something in the Bible says the spirit gives it life if the Holy Spirit was ordained in you which is that attribute that is the Holy Spirit by the way the attribute of God in you is a portion of God himself the Holy Ghost he interprets his own word that's why as an attribute of God you can't sin you can't disbelieve how can God disbelieve himself if you're a portion of God how's God going to disbelieve himself this your struggles your battles as a human being every day it struggles it it's that enmity against God your Colonel mind at times tries to figure things out but the moment you try it to allow your carnal mind to figure things out you're going to blow up especially when it comes to this this is something you just got to relax you just got to let the Holy Spirit do what he started in your life this is not something you started you didn't start this you didn't deserve this you didn't do anything to deserve this I never did anything to deserve this most of us deserved a lot worse I mean bad not a lot worse this is the glory of God we deserved to be to be completely cast out but God's grace came into our lives because of because of an attribute that he had placed there because he he saw you from before the foundations of the world and he placed your name on the Lamb's Book of Life knowing that when the word would come to you you would accept it [Music] you can't reject this word amen praise God and so he he will reveal the Mysteries the second thing so one he turns the heart back to the children and and two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it will be these divinely re uh revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers exactly so so when those seals were open and they're still opening they're still unveiling they're still unfolding as you as you want you know if you want to describe it because we're still here the the culmination is going to be the Rapture of the church because the mighty Angel comes to claim his possessions amen for the Rapture of the church then goes to the Jews and the tribulation and everything else but right now what are we concerned about the rapture what are we concerned about we're not to get concerned about anything else but to get into our position as Sons and Daughters of God in order to receive rapturing faith for a body change and so brother Branham realized he realized at that moment when he was entering into that season of Revelations 10 1-7 he saw the significance he saw that the mighty Angel himself was in that cluster of seven angels when when the cloud came down and and and and it come to him on Sunset mountain and those seven angels stood before him there was a great Thunder at that moment God was revealing to brother Branham right there and then goal West he says we're going to be opening up those Seven Seals it was the time of his policing it was the time of his crowning of his of his his uh portion in the word of God where he was going to go now and and be that seventh angel that seventh Earthly angel that would be the one that God was going to speak through remember he's the voice of God he was projecting the voice of God Amen and that's what he was he realized now he he was coming into his position this was his time this was the greatest time of his life it was going to be the the the the culmination of everything for him and you'll notice that when that time came into his life everything started to change around him Hallelujah go to the next slide so who's revealing the Thunders and the question here he's uh he he's he's given a question have the seven Thunders which equals seven Mysteries already been revealed were they revealed in the Seven Seals but are yet but are yet not known to us as the Thunders yet see there was the people were were in a state of confusion they didn't understand what was actually going on have the Thunders been revealed listen he says no they were revealed in the Seven Seals that's what the Thunders was about the Thunders when when the mighty Angel uh when when John heard the seven Thunders and the Seven voices the the voices that thundered out he actually saw everything that was written in he actually saw everything he saw the the white horse rider who it was he saw everything because everything was in the word but God said well hold on a minute you're not writing that part because we're not there yet we're not there yet we haven't come to that season yet there's things that are taking place right now that's leading us to that place and we need to realize that there's a season for everything that's why a lot of people they're getting confused that you know there's there's controversy around the Thunders the Seven Seals and the Seven Thunders and were they open and were they not open and and all kinds of of controversy and individuals that are stepping out and claiming that they know what it is that they expect brother Branham to come back or that they expect another Messenger to come and bring the the the the the teachings on what was in the Thunders God is the only interpreter of his word amen the Thunders can only be interpreted by The Thunderman himself Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah and everything that was under those first six seals it's been revealed it's all going to play out still but it's already been revealed what's going to take place we know now who the white horse rider is the red horse rider the black horse rider the pale rider that's still writing today he's ridden right into this message as a matter of fact trying to do the same things that he's always done deceive the people get them to to look to somebody get them to look to a to a a big preacher or or a famous preacher or somebody that that that's been around longer and knows things no no no no no All Eyes On Jesus all eyes on the word amen don't look anywhere else don't you look to anyone else don't you look for any interpretation on the word of God God is going to interpret it in your own life just look at your life look at your own life who got you to where you are today Hallelujah brother it ain't no man that's going to get you to where you are today sure you obeyed God you came under a Ministry you came subject to your pastor because he's the candle that God placed in the church and when you do that God honors his word and feeds you because you're under obedience to his word he's only honoring his word when you get when you become somebody that you can't come under subjection to a pastor you got trouble paying tithes it goes to show there's something there that needs to come up hither Hallelujah an attribute of God cannot rebel against the word of God Amen the word of God is Supernatural if you believe God and you know that God knows you knows all about you knows where you came from where you're going knows what you're hiding and what you're exposing well he knows everything about you when you come to a place where you're naked before God you will come subject to the Lord himself you will do what God has revealed to you in your heart to know that this is how I'm going to receive my rapturing faith people think that they can just bypass God's program and go in the rapture if they're rebelling against God's program it shows that they're not even in the Rapture because the Rapture is a revelation Hallelujah and it's a revelation of the body of Christ and the supernatural body of Jesus Christ bringing his attributes all together into one body and what what happens when you try to bring a cancer into the body it starts to affect the body you think God's going to do that no no what God does is he removes the cancer brings it in that's what he did to you that's what he did to me before we when when we came to the Lord there was all kinds of Cancer all over us death it was all over our lives but God says I've called you for a purpose and when that purpose is established and you know that you know that God is God and he starts to work on you he starts to mold you he starts to shape you through the fivefold ministry he starts to give you Faith to recognize the body and that the body edifies itself the body nourishes the body how can how can a Believer be against believer there's something wrong there's something wrong there's a devil there that needs to be cast out burnt out and prayed out because God does not divide against himself anytime there's confusion in any kind of a situation in your walk with God let me tell you who the author of that confusion is Satan himself Hallelujah Hallelujah so here he says no they were revealed in the Seven Seals that's what the Thunders was about they was to reveal the seven Thunders that had uttered their voices and no one could make out what it was listen now John knew what it was but he was forbidden to write it so don't let anybody tell you that somebody's going to be coming along and is going to give the understanding and the Revelation on the seven Thunders okay it's already it's already there there's nothing to be looking for some other messenger the mighty Angel is the messenger the Eternal messenger of this hour for an eternal bride amen he's here right now his voice is calling out your name he's he's positionally placing you in the word of God by the word that's going forth and you're recognizing oh I see I see who I am I see my position in the word of God Amen John knew who it was but he was forbidden to write it he said but the seventh angel the seventh angel in the days of his sounding the seven Mysteries of the seven Thunders would be revealed and the seventh angel is a messenger of the seventh Church h c now a lot of people put that totally on brother Branham that he's the one that's revealing the Thunders no he was the Earthly angel in order to fulfill Revelations 10 7. it was the mighty Angel himself those seven angels that came down on Sunset mountain and told Brother Branham it was time for the opening of The Seven Seals it was Christ himself now coming to reveal and coming to bring forth rapturing faith for his church for his elect for the ones that he came to claim he was coming himself he was not going to put this in the hands of anybody Hallelujah glory to God Amen and brother Branham realized that recognize that and saw that it was the time it was the time that that that changed his whole life that he says it's a new Bible why do you think that when you came to the Lord and you started to read the word it was like wait a minute here I've I've read this before but I didn't see this before this is alive this this is for now this isn't for yesterday this is for now everything becomes now why because Christ is present he's Eternal there is no time or space in Christ you as a human being you put time and you put space on everything and that's why you get confused at times that's why you get discouraged at times you get discouraged with your flesh you get discouraged with your performance you get discouraged with your relationships but Christ he he's present he says he that's heavy laden let him come unto me I will give him rest now right now he can give you rest right now he can provide your needs right now because everything that you have need of is already in you if you've recognized this message this is a supernatural message this is not another Christian Church sermon this is Supernatural this is Christ himself come to call you out of your circumstances to give you Faith to overcome the circumstances amen hallelujah glory to God hallelujah thank you Jesus amen you know go to the next uh scripture some people were actually saying that brother Branham because of his Supernatural experiences and and how God was with him so much the supernatural that that they thought you know brother Brandon you you can write another book Beyond The Book of Revelation you could write another book you could add to the book based on what God has revealed to you but brother Branham knew that you could not add anything to the word there's nothing that you and I could possibly add to the word of God it's Eternal it's it it's perfect there's nothing that brother Branham could have added because it wasn't brother Branham it was Christ it was God interpreting his own word amen hallelujah but man's thinking uh you know but you cannot add and look at for I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book we're not looking to add anything we need to make that clear we're not looking for for any man's interpretation on this message we're looking for God to interpret it clearly to us as individuals and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God will take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book next slide listen William Branham eligible to write a Bible look look what he says now someone had been many has been saying to me and theologians said brother Branham if the Lord God said if if with your experience that the Lord has given you for his people humbly saying this said you'd be eligible to write a Bible yourself see what they didn't realize and what they were confused by was that he was the interpretation of the Bible and when people were seen the supernatural that was taking place in his life they were not seen that it was the word himself it was Christ in him it's always been Christ in the word it's any time that you are interpreting God's word if you get healed you're a written epistle at that moment you're a written epistle that can be read of all men because you are the interpretation of healing in the Bible when when when healing takes place in your life you're realizing that it's the word that's being interpreted in you that I am the Lord thy God that healeth all of your diseases he didn't leave any disease out he said all so all you've got to do is believe the word walk with the word know that you actually are the interpretation of the word in this day according to the revelation of the message of the hour okay because you need to come subject to the word you can never make yourself more than the word the word is interpreting himself through your life so brother Branham says here he says his people humbly saying that you could write your word that God has manifested I said that might be true see he was trying to catch me see and I said but you see I couldn't do that he said why couldn't you you have all the qualifications I said but you look one word cannot be added or taken away see and he said well then them seven Thunders you see said wouldn't them seven Thunders blasting out wouldn't that be a revelation be given to some man you see you see how the enemy wants to you know get you confused like we need to keep this simple okay I know we're talking about the Book of Revelations we're talking about some thunders we're talking about seals you know uh you know all these half hour of Silence when the seventh seal was we're looking at all these things but you need to understand like I said right at the very beginning we are not a common denominational Church we are the interpretation of the book of Acts being continued into the 21st century we need to recognize that the Book of Revelation just look at the name it's the Book of Revelation Revelation is something that is revealed it's an end time book it's all about the end time everything regarding the church in the end time what day are we living in the end time why are we reading these things why are we looking into these things because they pertain to the people that are in the end time we need to recognize the importance of these truths and so here now he says that it's all revealed in there no sir it would be adding something to it and taking something from it it's all revealed in there and the Seven Seals opened up the revelation of what that was Hallelujah so it's nothing new it's not something that that that that that is going to be revealed by somebody or some group of people or some pastors it's Christ himself it's still the word unveiling himself in this hour All Through the Ages men were guessing at it but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin the sound the Mysteries would be finished and anybody that goes back and actually studies William Miriam Branham and looks into his life and his ministry they will see that he fulfilled exactly those scriptures of Malachi 4 5 Luke 17 30 Revelations 10 7. you will see it clearly in the word of God and it's important that people know that when you when you give a testimony about how God you know uh interceded in your life a part of your testimony is recognizing what God has done in your day what God has done through the Fulfillment of the scriptures and how William Miriam Branham was us was was that was an absolute element that you cannot leave it out because it's what leads us to where we are today it's it's because Christ was revealing his own word and he wants to do the exact same thing for you and me Hallelujah so it's already been written next slide in the Feast of the trumpets he said that this in that day that he see him come down and he eat up the little book and there was he put one foot on the land and one on the sea and swore by him that lives and ever and ever that time shall be no more and when he did seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders uttered their voices John said he was about to write and he said don't write it see and he sealed it what is it what it is is a revelation on what has been missed back there to bring it's already wrote here it's in here it's it's to reveal what's already been written in the word we're not adding nothing so you are written in the word you coming into your season and recognizing your day and its message is you coming into manifestation of the word for this day it's you recognizing that you're a part of this great Plan of Redemption Hallelujah because you can't add one thing to it or take one thing away from it Hallelujah everything is producing now rapturing Faith for the bride Hallelujah now let's go to the next slide and then there's coming forth seven mysterious Thunders that's not even written at all that's right and I believe that through those seven Thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing faith everything that was written under those seals has been released but there's something under the seventh seal that is now being released that's what we are focused on we already know what's under the six the first six seals it's history now it's not that it's history but it's going to be but we know what's going to be taking place we know that the the the the plagues we see the the the the white horse rider and what it's become today and we know where where it sits and we understand the the deception that's in the world that all would be deceived except those whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life everybody's in a in a level of deception the Bible said all a-l-l how are we going to change that you can't change that I can't change that there's nothing that we can do to change that the whole world is under deception except if your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life from before the foundations of the world people need to know this you talk about this and they go what do you mean all or you mean all the churches are deceived yeah all the churches he said all I don't know you want to read the scripture you you interpret it for me all are deceived except those who's written in the Lamb's Book of Life what's the Lamb's Book of Life well that's what that's what we've been given that's the that's the Revelation that we've been given that's what separates you from the rest of this Christian world that's what's separated listen when Jesus came to the Earth he walked with 12 disciples he walked with 12. there was there was there was hundreds of thousands millions of people on the Earth at the time but yet there was only a dozen people that actually recognized that the word was made flesh before them that the word was interpreting what it was supposed to produce in that day and they failed to recognize it well the same thing is happening today that's why when you're walking you know you humble you know simple but you've been given this Revelation on the message of this hour and you don't realize just what you are a carrier of you don't realize what's in you you don't realize that that you're going to be changed that you're not going to go you see the world falling apart all around you but you realize that because of the grace of God the spirit of God that raised Christ from the dead it's dwelling in you you've been awakened you've been born again that's what you know that's what the new birth is all about when the new birth takes place everything becomes new the Bible becomes new it becomes real Christ becomes real to you Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah he says and there's coming forth seven mysterious Thunders that not even written at all that's right in order to get the bride together for rapturing Faith because what we've got right now we wouldn't be able to do it a lot of people don't realize the importance of this Revelation on what God has done in our day in sending us a prophet in opening those Seven Seals in revealing the mystery truths that were written in the word of God people don't realize what's what's there they don't they don't they don't recognize why because they're not ordained to it but unto you it has been given to know these Mysteries unto you it has been given to know and look at Jesus he says but unto them it has not been given imagine this is the day that we're actually living in Hallelujah right together because what we got right now wouldn't be able to do it there's something we've got to step further we can't have enough faith for Divine Healing hardly we've got to have enough Faith to be changed in a moment and be swept up out of this Earth and we'll find that after a while the Lord willing will find where it's written amen hallelujah go to the next slide let's look at now the reason for the Thunders now there was some reason that God let this seven voices be thundered because it must come see for we find that Christ the lamb took the book in his hand and he opened that seventh seal but you see it's a hidden mystery no one knows it but it's right along with what he said no one would know his coming you see that seventh seal is actually the coming of Jesus Christ to the Earth a lot of people are way they're waiting on the coming of the Lord oh we're waiting on the coming he's going to come in a cloud guess what he already came in 1963. he already came in a cloud in 1963. and he's here right now claiming his possessions he's here right now maturing a church a bride a people he's he's now come into a a new age he's in an eternal age because he's an eternal messenger Hallelujah he's already come and they missed it you see the supernatural opening of that seventh seal was Christ himself coming to the Earth no one knows it but it's right along with what he said no one would know his coming they also would not know about this seven Thunder mystery so you see it's connected together that much we have an understanding of it today because the rest of it all unfolded but this is not unfolded but sitting in my room I heard this oh not heard it rather but seen it unfold to this seven Thunders see brother Branham he actually saw what was going on he realized that it was the time for Christ to come and claim his possessions he knew that's why he was such he was under such expert he could come tonight he realized that it had entered into that season it was Christ now himself the Mighty God himself had come down to claim his possessions to brother Branham that was now that was that was right now this this is going to happen right now but it wasn't yet because there was a bride that needed to be called he came to call those whose names were written in the book remember he came with the open book the book was open now he's releasing and calling the names that were written in the book aren't you glad that you heard your name aren't you thankful that he's come and that he's got a plan and that his desire is to call you and to place you and to use you for his glory amen but sitting in this room I heard this and and not heard it but rather seen it unfold to this seven Thunders now that's as far as we can go right there and now I trust that each and every one of you will serve God and we'll do that which is right love him all your life and serve him and God will take care of the rest go to the next slide and then when you see this coming to pass then know the time is nigh see Israel gathering in its own Homeland but you notice he omitted the revelation of this seventh seal he didn't give an interpretation on the seventh seal why did he not give an interpretation on the seventh seal because they were going to interpret themselves they were Satan has always been an impersonator he's always infiltrated the church and what does he do he gets the people off saying something gets them to pervert the word slightly enough that it just gets him off track and puts the Holy Spirit out of the church and Satan he's the same too he uses the same old tactics but God knew and said no I'm not going to allow this there's nothing to reveal here I'm going to reveal it by interpreting it I'm going to show that there's a people on the Earth that are going to manifest me in the form of a bride the true church there's a lot of churches out there that are claiming we're the bride of Christ we're the bride of Christ you can't be the bride of Christ unless God calls you unless God chose you listen when a woman goes and says I'm taking you as my husband that's a little bit perverted that's not the way it usually happens okay but we're living in a world where anything's possible now with Jesus all things are possible and with this world in the condition that it's in all things are possible too and we're witnessing it but that's not the way it works he chooses he says I chose you from before the foundations of the world it's not you chose him oh I went to The Altar and I gave my life to Jesus Christ and now I'm saved no that's not the way it works it's because God calls you God calls you by your name discerns your life exposes who you really are and that causes you to come to the Altar and repent and rejoice to know that your name has now been called Hallelujah that's what John was looking to hear he wanted to hear his name written in the book Hallelujah glory to God and that's what's taken place in your life it's because God chose you God God didn't want to any demon power to play around with his bride he wasn't going to let anybody pervert his his sons and daughters because he knew that this world would be in such a condition of total deception that they would themselves if it would even deceive the very elect imagine that kind of a deception that it would even deceive the very elect if it were possible but it's not possible because you're an attribute of God Hallelujah glory to God he says here therefore we're this far and the rest of it will be known right around about the time that Jesus appears on Earth again he's here he's here Saints appears for his bride or whatever takes place at that time now until that time let's just all pray live good straight Christian lives looking forward for his coming Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord glory to God Amen blessed be his wonderful name listen here as we wind down here uh brother Branham speaking here in an exposition of the seven Church ages the laodicean age a momentary consideration of church history will prove how accurate this thought is in the Dark Ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people now we're talking a little bit about Christian Church History here but God sent Luther with the word the Catholic Church basically had control over the word in the Dark Ages and they were controlling and there was there was so much done there was there was millions of Christians that were that were slaughtered okay under the hand of religious organized churches and the word was now going to reform itself and bring itself to where we are today I want you to see something God sent Luther with the word the Lutheran spoke for God at that time remember any time that God goes into a messenger it's the voice of God speaking through that messenger to call out the elect of that age we need to understand a bit of this church history so that we can understand where we are today but they organized and again the pure word was lost for organization tends towards dogma and Creeds and not the simple word they could no longer speak for God then God sent Wesley and was The Voice with the word in his day because they organized under Luther God sends Wesley to speak his word to bring them one step further the people who took his Revelation from God became living Epistles read and known of all men for their generation when the methodists filled God raised up others and so it has gone on through the years until this last day there is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age so we need to realize Who We Are the importance of our calling for us to recognize who we are in the word of God puts us into a position of perfect faith in the word of God and Supernatural things will just happen around your life things will fall away your obedience to the word of God you're you're coming subject to the word of God you attending Services you pain your tithes you loving your brothers and sisters you participating as a member of the church you being an usher you being a trustee you being a deacon you being a prayer Warrior whatever God has placed you in the body of Christ to do that is your perfect faith for perfect Revelation in order to receive rapturing faith it's as simple as that don't be looking for some great thing that you need to do all you need to do is come under subjection to the word of God and you become the final voice for the final age yes sir the church is no longer the most peace of God it is its own mouthpiece God is his own mouthpiece in this day and in this hour it's not going to be any man that you're going to follow you're not going to follow any man whatsoever you're not going to be looking from for some other messenger you're not going to be looking to to follow some certainty oh you only got to listen to the tapes no you don't only got to listen to the tapes you do need to listen to the tapes but you do also need to come under subjection to the five-fold ministry where the mighty Angel himself can speak and discern your situation for this week for this week for next week for tomorrow for today to heal you and provide for you what you have need of that's the supernatural element that's available to you as a son or daughter of God and he says here yes he says so God is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride he's talking about this age that this whole age that are claiming Christianity claiming that they know God they haven't come to this Revelation and until they do Unfortunately they get left behind and they go into the tribulation that's what the word says that's not what I'm telling you Hallelujah he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her yes it is for it says in the last chapter of Revelations verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come once more the world will hear direct from God as at Pentecost but of course that word bride will be repudiated as in the first age so don't expect people to just accept what you're saying God sent the prophet what do you mean God sent a prophet God sent lots of prophets no no God sent us a prophet in this day you need to recognize the importance of that because it leads us into our day and us having the ability to recognize who we are in the word of God amen glory to God go to the next slide so what actually happens when we awaken what is it that's actually happening we've heard from our theophany remember the attribute of God is what God is taking the attribute of God is your theophany if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved God has another one waiting so when you come into the revelation of this message and you see it I see it I recognize it it's God I'm a Son of God I'm Justified as though I never did it in the first place God is going to glorify this body God's going to change this body you've come into direct contact with your theophany the attribute of God that's in you then after you recognize the very word of God was Eagle food then you left the other things you see everything else just Falls away from you you've then been formed into the living image of the Living God you heard from your theophany if this Earthly body be dissolved we have one waiting feel like you need to understand the process of the rapture it's not something that's impossible it's something that's going to happen and all God is going to do is translate the theophany the attribute that's in you into that other dimension and you're going to be in full contact and actually that theophany is going to come down and take these bodies and transform them and turn them into Supernatural bodies because we're going to be coming back to this Earth for another Thousand Years and you're going to need a body on this Earth for another Thousand Years except it's not going to be one that's going to die it's not going to be one that's going to grow old it's going to be a supernatural body Hallelujah glory to God Amen thank you Jesus go to the next slide so now we understand the supernatural Cloud that came down in 1963 was God coming down in his theophanes God coming down to reveal himself God coming down to open his word god coming down to claim and this Supernatural event you can research it go into Google and research a high cloud ring of mystery it'll come up and you can read all about it and see that the Supernatural coming of the Lord has already taken place amen praise God glory to God but they couldn't recognize it the theophany listen uh next Slide the theophany sorry there's a scripture reading Revelations 10 8 to 11. we're winding this down another five minutes I want you to see your position in the word of God your time your season why it is that God is feeding you the word of God why it is that God has given you that open book God has revealed to you what's what's what's hidden in the mysteries of those seven Thunders and you've been feeding on it year after year that week after week feeding on the books listening to the tapes what's been happening you've been feeding on the book you've been eating the book in Revelations 10 8 to 11 is your ministry it is our ministry it is the time for us to prophesy the word of God and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go take the little book which is open the book was open now everything was revealed glory to God in the hand of the Angel would stand upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it and it shall make thy value bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again you are living Epistles red of all men you are the Living Word in this day and in this hour you are the ones that God is using you are the final voice which produces the Rapture of the church Hallelujah the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead is in you now calling calling when you're testifying to somebody when you're when you're telling them about what God did for you it's actually a supernatural Thunder that's voice of God coming out of you speaking to individuals giving them faith that they never knew that they could possibly have but it's only because they are attributes of God you cannot call and add to the church nobody's going to add anybody to the church every son and daughter of God that God has has already been written in the Lamb's Book of Life they Jesus said all that the father hath given me will come Hallelujah glory to God blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah let the brothers come for the for the baptism amen praise God it's just recognizing now that this is your time this is your time when you recognize your part in the word that you have a part in the word that's going to bring the Fulfillment of the Rapture that's going to give you perfect faith for the next stage of God's Ministry which is to take us into that meeting in the air Hallelujah there's just so much that that the word is doing in each and every one of our lives but we need to recognize the Simplicity of God's word and the importance of feeding on God's word amen praise God forevermore bless the name of the Lord let us pray let us give thanks father Lord we know that these are many uh quotes and scriptures that we've read over and over and over again Lord but we know that there's things in this word father that no man can put words to it takes you by divine revelation to speak to the hearts of your children to call every son and daughter of God to perfect every life that is need of perfection that is a need to be perfected for this church will go one day to that great meeting in the air father anoint each and every one of us Lord to fulfill our part to

ahead brother Philip thank you praise God hallelujah we thank God for Brian Max's life as brandani said when one sinner repented all the Heavenly hosts rejoice so if you are rejoicing the Heavenly Host let's give God Applause amen okay without wasting much time I read couple of scriptures then after I finish we pray that we go inside the water our first scripture will come from say look chapter 24 verse 47-49 . in Luke chapter 24 verse 47 to 29 . amen and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning that Jerusalem and ye are witnesses of these things and behold I send the promise of my father upon you better ye in the city of Jerusalem until ye be and you retire from on high and in Colossians 3 17. Colossians chapter 3 verse 17. it says that everything you do in works or indeed do it in my name and then the last that means that the name is very important he said everything you do in works or indeed do it in my name giving thanks to God and the father by him so everything should be in his name in the name of Jesus every knee shall bow offense in heaven and on Earth that name is above all names and in Acts chapter 2 verse 37 to 38 they asked Peter men and Brethren what shall we do and he said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and Nisha received the gift of the Holy Ghost amen so upon this word it means that if you generally repent which our brother has done and we baptized in Jesus name God will fill him with his spirit so you can go inside the water now and then we pray can you all join me whilst we pray for our brother can all join me who has the profile brother oh a Heavenly most gracious Eternal God your word clearly said that when one repented all the Heavenly hosts is rejoiced Lord as the words came forth that no one comes to you except you call him and your name their names are written the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundations of the world oh God we know that baptism doesn't save but it's an outward expressing what has already taken place inside the brother that's expressing for the people to see oh God know him very well that you promise that when the people repent gently from their hearts and be baptized in your name you fill them with your Holy Ghost as we come in to baptize the brother father I pray that your great Holy Ghost will come and fill him with yourself so that he won't be the same person but from today gonna be a new person and live a new life amen okay but I'm asked you came here by your own free will today yes no but is it your free your own free will and do you renounce Satan and all his activities okay so upon confession of your faith I'm going to baptize you in the name of Jesus Christ the name above all names the names that demon fear and tremble amen that name will cast out everything amen okay come a little bit forward neither and then bring yourself down baptized in Jesus name upon confession praise the Lord [Applause] praise God Heavenly Father we pray that your holy spirit will move in his life in a marvelous and in a wonderful way we commit him into your Divine hands For Your Glory and fear honor in the name of Jesus Christ amen the Lord thank you [Music] thank you always cheers [Music] foreign [Music] Jesus [Music] [Applause] and his friends [Music] to love you you appreciate it [Music] I love you I adore you I love you before [Music] and you [Music] [Applause] know [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] everything [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Holy Spirit to me [Music] anxiety [Music] and like the woman at the well I was seeking oh poor things that could not satisfy come on everybody [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] I want to know [Music] [Applause] when I was singing [Music] and then I heard my savior [Music] [Applause] [Music] my day [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] and take me [Music] praise God just a few quick announcements Saints this Saturday we will be having brother George Smith visiting with us and we'll be ministering the word and we will have visiting a Brethren coming from grace and truth and from the spoken word Tabernacle in Scarborough that will be joining us amen and they've got some singers that will be coming from the spoken word Tabernacle that will be joining us and singing with us and doing some specials and so forth um so we'll have that special service on Saturday night on Sunday morning we will be here at our home Church there will be Services brother George Smith will be going to Grace uh Tabernacle in Brampton we will be having our regular scheduled Sunday service here however if anybody wants to go to brother Gerard's Church details are on the bulletin board for the Sunday afternoon service if they would like to you know see brother George Smith again on the Sunday afternoon anybody that would like to go there are welcome to attend that service at this at um the Spoken Word Fellowship brother Gerard Samuels pastor of that church okay so you can get details for that but we'll see you here Saturday night 6 30 okay service will start and we look forward to that we'll be here Wednesday night service at 7 30.
