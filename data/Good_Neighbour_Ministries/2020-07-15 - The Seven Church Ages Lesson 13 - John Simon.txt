The Seven Church Ages Lesson 13
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] welcome to the house of god it's good to be here this evening as we looked into god's unchanging and invaluable word found in the book of revelation chapter 1. i'm reading from revelation 1 verses 10 to 12. i was in the spirit on the lord's day and i heard a voice behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying i am alpha and omega the first and the last and what thou seest write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in asia onto ephesus onto smyrna and onto pergamos and onto thyatira and onto sardis and on to philadelphia and onto laodicea and i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candle sticks our gracious heavenly father we thank you so much that you gave us your unchanging word may the great holy spirit now bring the word to life as we look into this perfect law of liberty and out of it may you receive all your glory and all your praise for we surrender ourselves to thee for service in the name of our lord jesus christ amen and amen the topic tonight is the voice like a trumpet john heard behind him in the vision a voice behind him sounding like a trumpet us astentorian voice for he was in the spirit and when you start in the spirit you hear the things of god you see the things of god and what a an experience it is also for he was transported into that wonderful great day of the lord and there he was in the presence of god with the future uh about to unfold before his very eyes now god while he was in the spirit and that's the place all of us should be is in the spirit and then god was able to teach john teach him thanks be to god isn't that the place we all should be in what a place how we need in this hour the teaching of the holy spirit himself god himself coming to interpret his own word to the believer oh what a comfort what a strength what an encouragement when we we know that the children of god in that day will be taught of the lord himself and are being taught of the lord now it says that john heard a voice did not say it was a trumpet but that voice sounded like a trumpet now if it was like a trumpet we know that when ever a trumpet is blown it denotes urgency it's a call to attention it's heraldry like a herald goes before the coming of the king and says clear the way make his path straight the king is coming the king is coming let everyone pay attention because the king is coming i'm so happy that in our day god has sent a herald according to malachi chapter 4 verse 5 to clear the way all the uh the baggages out clear the high places out make the low places plain and straight carry away all the things that were contrary to god that our eyes may be open that we may welcome the coming of our beloved the coming of the lord jesus christ how happy we ought to be at the return of this blessed king so the trumpet sounds urgency the trumpet sounds the heraldry of the worst messenger and the word of god and also i want to make note of israel the nation of israel their affinity to trumpets for in the bible we know they are they have their silver trumpets blown by the prince we know brother sister that in the last day as time begins to blend back into eternity that they will be partaking fully of the feasts of the trumpet feast of atonement oh what a great time when they will be come back to a place to recognize their messiah and enter into their atonement by the very word of god that renewed and brought us to our atonement that very word which to us takes us to the wedding supper of the lamb and we are feasting upon that word now a seven course meal served by the hand of jesus christ himself through the ministry of his messenger all glory be to god hallelujah but to us it's the seventh seals reveal revealing what christ is the mystery of god revealed now to them it will be the feast of the of the trumpets out of the feast of the trumpets will unfold to them the marvelous revelation of jesus christ the jehovahness of jesus that the jesus the jehovah of the old testament is that jesus of the new testament and it will place their faith in this messiah whom a fourth time they had rejected but now because god says there's a time for everything there is a season for everything and in the fullness of time god sends both his son so in the fullness of their time god will break the scales from off their eyes as he did in typical form on paul a song and take the scale off of their eyes the veil will be lifted and they will be able to say i can see clearly now the gloom is gone the clouds are gone the fog is gone all of the distractions are gone and when they look they will see only jesus only jesus why for only jesus can satisfy their longing and their expectations and their waiting and their suffering right through the holocaust and many other tragedies and trials and tribulations through which they have come as a nation but there will that will all come to its culmination when they enter into the great revelation of jesus christ their messiah their lord their master and their soon-coming king who is also the king of all kings and the lord of lords for the kingdom of this war kingdoms of this world will become the kingdom of all lord and of his christ thanks be to god hallelujah amen amen so hearing this voice behind him this voice of urgency this voice proclaiming the coming of the king amen trumpets also symbolize when israel heard a trumpet it means it's time to assemble it's time for the the tribes to assemble whether it's around the tabernacle or whether it was around moses or the high priest when those trumpets sounded it was a sign for them to assemble and when the gentiles hear the trumpet voice of the holy spirit speaking through a prophetic ministry in this hour it's a time to assemble it's the time for oneness it's a time to return back for it's the jubilee trumpet for the gentiles and they hear the blowing of the trumpets of liberty they hear the blowing of the trumpets and knowing their hearts that even though the devil held them captive made them prisoners to himself it is time for them to walk out of their prison doors and walk out of their habits walk out of their sins trials and tribulations and walk into the glorious freedom of the lord and savior jesus christ hallelujah the voice like a trumpet is also a call to worship oh praise god for this last day called to worship to worship him in spirit and in truth not a one-sided worship not an unbalanced worship not fleshly worship with strange fire but my friends genuine worship where jesus said that we must worship him and the father seeks those to worship him that will worship him in spirit and also in the truth there's a lot of worshiping in the spirit a lot of emotions a lot of running around a lot of speaking in towns worshiping in the spirit but also friends we need to worship him in the truth then on the other hand there are many that have received the message of the messenger and they are worshiping in the truth but with a hardly any spirit hardly any spirit any kind of life to them but just an emotionless uh one that has no real revelation upon it no fire has fallen upon that truth no fire has fallen upon the altar and therefore they worshipping me in the truth but without the spirit but a real genuine balance worship is to worship god in spirit and in truth thanks be to god hallelujah also the voice like a trumpet a trumpet sound is also a call to arms it's a call to let you know we are about to be engaged in a war i have heard that voice i hope you have and we know that we are not called to a picnic or to a barbecue or to a church potluck sapa but we are called to fight against not against flesh and blood but against principalities powers spiritual wickedness in high places and thanks be to god we have the victory before we have already before the war is even over we are assured we have the victory for we are more than conquerors through him that loved us praise be to god hallelujah now i'd like to make an observation [Music] that if john was in the spirit or when john was in the spirit and he was transported into the future and john city heard a voice behind him now if he heard the voice behind speaking then the voice that john heard was the voice of the lord jesus christ speaking to all of the church ages all of the ages of the church and giving to each messenger his message for each church age so john being in the future but hearing the voice behind him could hear the voice of jesus christ speaking to the church ages speaking first of all to the patriarchs way back in the old testament he heard the voice this same voice this voice of melchizedek that spoke to abraham the voice that spoke to job all of the patriots that same voice he heard it speaking to the prophets and through the prophets and then that voice we began to hear it speaking in the new cup under the new covenant to the seven messengers of the seven church ages hearing that trumpet voice behind him through all of these ages so i can say he heard the voice of history he heard the voice of experience praise god hallelujah oh glory to god and then he must have heard the voice voice in revelation 19 i believe where he said and i heard the voice amen after the voices in heaven had said for the marriage of the lamb is come and the wife was made herself ready he said he heard the voices saying amen hallelujah and then voices like thundering waters oh glory to god hallelujah it's the voice of god the very voice of god with the bible says break at the cedars in lebanon the voice of god hallelujah that roars like a lion the voice of god the bible says psalm 44 6 that he spoke and the earth moved it trembled at the voice of the living god hallelujah and john was hearing this voice behind them this very voice that made the earth heave and move and tremble at the voice of god and it will in the future at the time of the judgment the voice of god will cause the rocks to break and try to hide themselves but none can hide from the trumpet voice of jesus christ this is the same voice that said to the deaf the blind the lame the dead speak to them rise take up your bed and walk that same voice that trumpet voice which the bible said he lifted up his voice and said lazarus come forth that very voice is the voice that will be heard at the day of the resurrection when he said the lazarus is as much as if he will say to us come forth hallelujah and all the dead that died in the lord will come forth he was just demonstrating that he is the resurrection and the life and at the sound of his voice it gives life to even dead things and bring things to life and so the dead will come back to life in the resurrection by the trumpet voice of jesus christ the living god hallelujah i want to say yet also he heard that voice of many waters and that was the voice of the people of god in other words it was living voices but we will speak of that praise god hallelujah it calls you to attention something important is about to comfort pay attention pay attention to the word of god shake yourself out of your stupor and come to yourself and recognize that it's god speaking by his word it's an urgent call to pay attention to god's word god's word comes sometimes startlingly to shake us to awareness and to awaken us to his presence to recognize him in our day and in our time praise god hallelujah then if the trumpet voice was something forth like that to john and john was in the future when he was hearing that voice then he was hearing the voice of prophecy it was prophecy and he was hearing this voice which was not only the voice of the resurrection but the voice of prophecy the word of prophecy and by being having that prophecy being told to john who is a type of the bride or of the wife of christ it was god allowing john to be come or john a type of the bride to be aware of what is to come and by being aware of what is to come in the future john could be prepared also for what is to come thanks me the god that god never leaves his people without a witness god never takes anyone to judgment without first giving them a warning and thanks be to god it's written in the book hallelujah and blessed are your eyes that's it blessed are your ears that hear the word of god and the voice of god in these last days listen revelation chapter 1 verse 11 i am alpha and omega the first and the last what thou seest write in a book and send it onto the seven churches which are in asia on the ephesus on the smyrna on the bergamos onto tyra onto sardis onto philadelphia and antolio di praise god he is the first and he is the last he is same on the beginning of all things and i am the finality of all things i am the author and i am the finisher after all everything else has passed away back into nothingness he remains standing firm for he is our god who changeth not the author and the finisher of our faith glory to god hallelujah the one true god the one true and only god whose name is jesus christ for the word god only means object of worship and lots of people like to say oh god said this god told me that which god there are many gods many lords but there is only one true god and his name is the lord jesus christ hallelujah so the voice of the word of god speaking to john hallelujah meaning to let him know not just prophecies at hand but truth is at hand reality is at hand the unfailing reality of the living god is at hand so pay attention to the word of god what a thing what an experience to be in the spirit caught up by the spirit of god and to be in the presence of the lord under the anointing waiting in his presence and to hear from the lord himself listen listen to the instructions to john three full instruction what thou seest first of all john was to see these things were done for him to see not only meaning that john should be to be there to observe or to spectate but he was to understand he was to visibly see and inwardly to understand what god was saying to him and in type what god was saying to the entire church of all ages first he had to see and secondly god said what thou see us right john was supposed to write right in this marvelous book of revelation hallelujah that's the second command what does yes cs write and then he said send it unto the churches praise god well some of those churches not just the the uh churches that were there at the time that uh held the character of the ages that were to come but that also has a double meaning of going to those churches at that time yeah around the asia minor of praise god and thus it also means that that letter that john wrote which is this book of revelation is supposed to go to the churches even in history or the future at the time when john was there which means to us and here we are reading out of the book of revelation those very things that john was commanded by the divine inspiration and anointing to write within the book oh blessed be the name of the lord glory to his holy name my friends how marvel it is to know that that great voice of god that sounded off the word of god in the garden of eden to adam and eve glory to god when they came down and had a gospel meeting fellowship with god sitting down and god speaking to his children in the evening time that voice will once more be heard in the land the voice of the turtle dove heard in the land once again the queen of the great dove of peace oh the wings of a snow white dove god sent down this pure sweet love a sign from above oh praise god on the wings of a dove oh glory to his god what a what a place of rest to be what a place of peace to be under the wings of the great snow white dove of god hallelujah that voice that spoke peace that voice that spoke fellowship that spoils that spoke redemption to them in the garden of eden that same voice roared upon the mountain of sinai speaking with thunders and thundering on lightnings and judgments of the living god and commandments oh my god that voice the same voice it spoke there oh glory to god but thanks be to god there was an age of grace coming and we heard the same voice again upon the mount transfiguration speaking grace grace grace that hip stone which is jesus christ crying out grace grace grace mercy pardon hallelujah for he was the fulfillment of that headstone that that that cornerstone that would come forth in zion crying of grace grace grace and that great that great stone this great person jesus christ upon the monk transfiguration was conformed by the voice saying this is my beloved son hear ye him why he is the word so hear what the word of god is saying and the word speaks not judgment but us back there and commandments but grace mercy pardon freedom liberty redemption oh praise god unto him who washed us and loosed us from from our sins in his own blood unto him with praise and honor and glory forever and forever blessed be the name of the lord god oh that voice that was heard in the excellent glory in the presence of god is again sending forth praise god but it's sounding forth within this seven church ages at that time oh praise god hallelujah and uh and from that time and you know the seven church ages if you do not know came from john's time paul's time when paul was as the main messenger of the ephesians church age which later on we will take them individually and begin to teach upon them their implications what their confirmations their vindications whatever it is that they are expressing and type and in reality we will try to make it clear as taught by the holy spirit through the prophet of god in this end time praise god hallelujah and we know we're at the final part of these church ages for we are now living in the age of laodicea we are now living in the last church age there are no more church ages for the gentiles after this as i have said before after the gentile seasons of time and dispensations are over it all is now beginning to return back to our jewish brethren to welcome the coming of their king hallelujah so that voice is sending forth again to these seven churches well praise god and the seven churches as some of you will know in the form of the pyramid it expresses and types and shows the fullness and finality of the person of the lord jesus christ himself and it gives us an insight into the final the full and final revelation of jesus christ to his church in these last days praise be to god listen to god write the visions john write divisions make a record of them make this record for the ages that are to follow for john was in the spirit spiritually physically john was in the ephesian church age john was in the ephesian church age and so god is saying right john for the ages not only for your age but for all the other church ages that are to come for these are true prophecies and they will surely come to pass we know god's word must surely come to pass for heaven and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away so john write them first of all see what i'm saying write them and send them making them known to the people praise god hallelujah so that they can know and be prepared and be aware of what is to happen what is to take place in their day and in their time that they will have at least a general awareness of the nature of their age of some of the activities that will be taking place in their age and so on so that the church of god is left with awareness prophecy modern events being made clear by the fulfillment and the vindication of prophecy in our day so that we may recognize our day and the message that god sent for our day praise be to god and just as much as the bible tells us john recognize the voice oh praise god if you are a son a daughter a child of god you will also recognize that voice for as you know in the book of john i believe it's chapter 15 he says my sheep hear my voice my sheep know my voice that oh praise god if you are a seed son oh a certified seed son and daughter and child of god then my brother sister you will know the voice of god you will recognize that voice and in closing you may say brother simon how am i going to recognize a voice like that oh will you ask a baby how will it recognize its mother's voice does the baby need theology does the baby need to have an education before it knows how to recognize it its parents voice it does so by what god already placed in it the ability god placed an ability in that child before it was even born to recognize the voice of its parent and even so within the heart of a believer before the foundation of the world god placed that innate ability that inspiration to recognize the voice of your heavenly parent praise god hallelujah so here we are being called upon to recognize that trumpet voice are you recognizing god's call to you a call to duty a call the mission a call to assembly a call to spiritual warfare a call to prepare yourself for the coming of the king call my friends to be ready to hear that voice of of the voice of the resurrection that can raise you up spiritually now that you can live above sin and worldliness and the forms and the systems and the things of the earth that same voice that will also raise you up if you die before god he comes personally then if you are dead the dead will hear the voice of the son of man and shall live oh glory to god may the holy spirit bless you real goodnight brothers and sisters may you be inspired maybe you be be just enthused and anointed by the holy spirit be filled with the holy ghost may god open your eyes may god open the doors and the gateways of your inspiration within your heart and receive the blessing of the lord and if you're an unbeliever receive it o sinner receive it oh unbeliever receive it in the name of jesus christ turn your life around hallelujah and walk in the light of the day and god will bless you now and forever and throughout eternity may god bless you in jesus name amen and amen and god may i thank you for being here and receiving the word of god faithfully on this wednesday night in the middle of the week to receive some more spiritual gasoline with a spark plug upon it to give you some power to meet the challenges of this hour look god's spirit go with you as you take the name of jesus with you god bless you my brothers and sisters amen and amen [Music] i
