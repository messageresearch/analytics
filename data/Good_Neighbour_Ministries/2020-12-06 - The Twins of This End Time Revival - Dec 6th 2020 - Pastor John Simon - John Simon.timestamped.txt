[34:42] bubbling under
[34:43] all of that i had a desire to
[34:48] praise the lord and this is my testimony
[34:53] so i'm here with a song that's been
[34:56] placed on my heart
[34:58] for his beloved that is you
[35:02] and i don't know what what the purpose
[35:05] of it is
[35:06] god knows because he gave it to me
[35:09] and it certainly has a purpose
[35:12] you're the reason i'm part of that
[35:15] reason

[44:52] apply it to their hearts
[44:54] amen may god watch over all

[45:26] now last week we gave out some of these
[45:30] beautiful pins of the cloud

[45:36] yours just ask
[45:37] one of the deacons and you will be able
[45:40] to receive
[45:42] one of them praise the lord amen god is

[45:51] the directive

[45:56] and uh you know the area out back
[46:00] there uh not to come in
[46:03] um and they can watch it online
[46:06] and we can get the word out that way and
[46:09] just for you who are
[46:11] in the immediate area so we want to
[46:12] thank the lord
[46:14] that he has kept us so far
[46:17] covered by the blood of jesus christ and
[46:20] protected
[46:21] by his word today we
[46:24] have a thought we'd like to share with
[46:27] you
[46:28] and follow up and that is
[46:31] found in genesis chapter 25
[46:35] verses 21 and 24.
[46:38] the reason why i don't want to read that
[46:41] long scripture just let's read the two
[46:43] verses
[46:44] and we'll begin from there
[46:47] genesis chapter 25
[46:52] praise the lord
[47:00] verse 21
[47:03] and isaac entreated the lord
[47:06] for his wife because she was barren
[47:10] and the lord was untreated of him and
[47:13] rebecca's wife
[47:15] conceived verse
[47:18] 24 and when her
[47:22] days to be delivered were fulfilled
[47:24] behold
[47:26] they were twins in her womb
[47:30] praise the lord let us pray
[47:34] our gracious heavenly father we thank
[47:37] you for the reading of the word
[47:39] and now we ask that the great old time
[47:42] holy
[47:43] spirit oh god
[47:46] come and anoint the word of god
[47:49] and give forth your light and truth
[47:53] and send out o lord jesus
[47:56] this blessing of the word upon your
[47:59] people lord
[48:00] breaking chains of the mind and of the
[48:03] heart
[48:04] and setting your people free that we
[48:07] might
[48:07] rise up on wings of eagles to serve you
[48:11] in the freedom and the glorious liberty
[48:15] of the sons and daughters of god to
[48:18] thee be all the praise honor and glory
[48:21] in jesus
[48:22] name amen and amen praise the lord god
[48:25] bless you
[48:26] amen you may say brother simon why are
[48:28] you so excited
[48:29] i'm excited for what i see in the word
[48:33] and we should all be excited about what
[48:36] we
[48:36] see in the world because
[48:40] the highlight of our lives is
[48:43] this gathering together amen i said the
[48:47] highlight of our
[48:48] lives is this gathering together
[48:51] in the presence of the lord in christ
[48:55] and under the great anointing of the
[48:58] holy spirit
[49:00] of the living god around the present
[49:03] revealed truth of the word that he has
[49:06] given to us
[49:08] we are blessed of god and we are honored
[49:11] by the holy spirit
[49:13] yet we are invited into his presence
[49:16] glory to god
[49:18] so here we are today and god
[49:21] taking us from the depths of his
[49:24] mind and bringing us into the shallows
[49:28] of mortal life that we might express
[49:32] him that others may see and know
[49:36] him that he is alive forevermore
[49:39] praise god and so our purpose on this
[49:43] earth
[49:43] being here is that we are
[49:47] eternal beings from his presence
[49:50] that are trapped in a body that only has
[49:53] a time frame
[49:56] in that brief period of time we are
[49:59] here to express him we are here to
[50:02] express
[50:03] eternal life we are here to express
[50:06] to them what endless life is
[50:10] all about and this is just a small
[50:13] portion of it that we are allowed to
[50:15] live whether 21
[50:17] 50 70 80 90 whatever
[50:20] we are only allowed to express it in
[50:23] such a portion of life
[50:24] that he has given to us but whatever the
[50:27] time he has apportioned to us
[50:30] we are thankful to god that we were
[50:33] chosen in him before the foundations of
[50:37] the world
[50:38] to be here in this season in
[50:41] this time to make his name known we have
[50:44] a
[50:45] mission we have a name amen and we have
[50:48] a word to declare
[50:50] and we give him all the glory and praise
[50:52] praise god
[50:54] the only way friends
[50:57] that you can express that life that is
[51:00] in you
[51:01] is first of all you got to hear it
[51:06] because faith cometh by hearing and
[51:09] hearing by the word of god not just
[51:11] hearing anything but hearing
[51:13] the true word of god amen
[51:17] you got to hear it and then you got to
[51:19] believe it
[51:20] praise the lord hallelujah but how
[51:23] you're going to believe it everybody
[51:25] says they believe it
[51:26] everybody thinks they believe it and
[51:29] there's many
[51:30] churches out there even believers in
[51:32] this message
[51:34] i believe it i believe the message i
[51:36] believe the prophet
[51:37] but they don't recognize that to
[51:41] really and truly believe you can't
[51:44] really truly believe without
[51:47] a revelation
[51:50] for faith itself is a revelation
[51:54] to believe you got to have a revelation
[51:57] so if you
[51:58] didn't have a revelation then
[52:01] it's all right you can say you believe
[52:04] but that
[52:05] your so-called belief has no foundations
[52:09] your so-called belief has nothing to do
[52:13] no thai post that you can tie
[52:16] to and know for sure that that's where
[52:20] you
[52:20] are so that claim to believing
[52:24] whether in the message or out the
[52:26] message is
[52:27] just human presumption
[52:30] it is not definite being certain of god
[52:35] because you have received a revelation
[52:38] from him out of the word
[52:41] and that makes you certain of god
[52:45] that makes you positive because you
[52:48] know it's from this word and god
[52:51] allowed you to see it
[52:55] you didn't study your way into it you
[52:57] weren't persuaded into it
[53:00] nobody can actually like enlighten you
[53:03] on it they can just give you
[53:05] enough to wave that wave sheath in front
[53:07] of your eyes that you can start seeing
[53:10] like images passing and then focus after
[53:13] a while you catch
[53:14] something and you grasp it for your life
[53:17] amen
[53:18] you're never going to let it go because
[53:21] the talents of the great
[53:22] eagle just grabs a hold of it and you're
[53:25] not going to let it go
[53:27] because you're a child of the king and
[53:29] you're
[53:30] born for that purpose for his glory amen
[53:33] hallelujah so we are not here uh
[53:37] claiming anything by just human
[53:41] belief which is nothing but intellectual
[53:45] presumption
[53:46] because uh in your mind you can hear
[53:49] it and but because you know english you
[53:53] can take it in
[53:54] and that's it but there's something on a
[53:57] higher dimension a higher level
[53:59] there's something that god set in this
[54:02] world
[54:03] to grab a hole of the soul and to never
[54:06] let it go
[54:07] and when that deep crawls back to this
[54:10] deep
[54:11] when that word from before the
[54:13] foundations
[54:14] called to this amen it will respond
[54:18] back to it for my sheep here my voice
[54:21] and a stranger they will not follow
[54:24] praise god hallelujah oh praise god
[54:27] my thought and topic for today
[54:31] is the twins of this end time revival
[54:36] twins of this end time revival
[54:39] well you know it's written in the word
[54:42] of god
[54:43] praise god brother branham said it
[54:46] plainly and clearly
[54:48] every revival produces twins
[54:52] if we want to stop and say oh that
[54:54] stopped up to the pentecostal
[54:57] age that produced twins all the other
[55:00] ages produced twins
[55:02] but this message is so wonderful
[55:05] marvelous
[55:07] and a blessing that there can't be
[55:10] impersonators in this there can't be
[55:13] twins in this there can't be anything
[55:16] like that
[55:17] no no no we've got to follow the
[55:20] continuity
[55:21] of the word of god because a
[55:25] principle it was on a guideline was
[55:28] laid down in the bible in the word of
[55:32] god
[55:32] in the book of genesis and we see it
[55:35] from the very beginning from the time of
[55:37] eve hallelujah
[55:41] praise god because you know and we won't
[55:45] go into that topic itself that's another
[55:47] topic
[55:48] but she had twins right from the very
[55:52] beginning
[55:53] and that principle tells us clearly that
[55:56] if there were twins in the beginning
[56:00] which those twins were at type
[56:04] and they were also prophetic for what is
[56:08] to come
[56:10] and we can use the term a prophetic type
[56:13] okay but it tells you that down through
[56:17] every single age of time
[56:20] there was going to be twins one
[56:23] good one evil one of god one of satan
[56:27] amen it's gonna be right like that from
[56:30] the beginning
[56:31] right on down through to the end
[56:35] and now so in this age
[56:38] we have an end time twins
[56:41] in this message
[56:45] and in this end time revival
[56:48] this revival this
[56:51] move of god is not my friends like
[56:55] exempted from having
[56:59] these twins operating
[57:02] in their midst genesis 25 which we just
[57:06] read
[57:08] tells us that rebecca
[57:11] had twins in the womb
[57:14] and the bible is by type by symbol
[57:18] prophecy telling us there is
[57:22] going to be twins in the church
[57:26] there's going to be twins inside
[57:29] of what you claim to be the message
[57:33] and that is it's just there
[57:37] but one thing you must understand
[57:40] both of these twins
[57:44] are striving for one and the same thing
[57:48] both want to get a hold of that
[57:51] birthright
[57:53] whether they're king or they're able
[57:57] they want to have god's attention they
[58:00] want to have his blessing
[58:02] they want that book right whether
[58:05] they're good
[58:06] or whether they're evil but we know only
[58:09] one is going to get it
[58:12] one has a uh an
[58:16] intellectual right to it
[58:19] if anybody should get it as him because
[58:21] he studied more than i
[58:23] right he read more books he listened she
[58:26] listened more tapes that woman really
[58:28] even prays more than i and everything
[58:31] else if anybody's gonna get it they're
[58:32] gonna get it
[58:33] and that's the the way it was let's say
[58:36] set up back in the time of of the law
[58:40] that the eldest one or the one that
[58:43] is born first he automatically would get
[58:47] the word right
[58:48] he would have to get the birthright and
[58:51] the birthright
[58:52] was the blessing of his father with a
[58:55] double portion
[58:57] of the inheritance would be his right
[59:01] for him to receive there
[59:05] but god himself
[59:09] shows that he makes a difference even
[59:12] there
[59:14] praise god so
[59:17] another thought i want to share here uh
[59:21] never mind if this sounds kind of rough
[59:23] to you but just listen
[59:25] every single age has
[59:28] a abort right promise or the promise to
[59:33] abort right
[59:34] deepwood right praise the lord now
[59:38] praise god in other words if you give
[59:39] them one in that first age you gotta
[59:42] keep doing it
[59:42] god doesn't change uh it may be some
[59:45] appearing like in a different way but
[59:47] this is really the same thing
[59:49] right but he'll do it through every
[59:52] single age
[59:53] praise the lord praise god so here we
[59:57] want to look at
[59:58] jacob and esau praise the lord you want
[1:00:01] to join me in that
[1:00:04] jacob and esau these twins
[1:00:07] if you read it in genesis 25 you'll read
[1:00:10] about them
[1:00:11] there but here we find out that
[1:00:15] jacob the elected
[1:00:18] or type of the elected he
[1:00:21] valued that but right so much
[1:00:25] he had a desire and he valued it above
[1:00:29] everything else in his life
[1:00:32] no matter what he had to suffer no
[1:00:35] matter what he had to go
[1:00:37] through no matter how he had to humble
[1:00:39] himself
[1:00:41] no matter what he had to have
[1:00:44] that work right and he was willing to
[1:00:47] pay
[1:00:47] any price to be able to get
[1:00:51] that book right now when we look at his
[1:00:54] twin
[1:00:56] praise god and you know what twins are i
[1:00:59] don't want him going through that so
[1:01:00] you take that spiritually and see the
[1:01:02] two in the church and they look like
[1:01:04] twins
[1:01:04] you can't tell the difference if this
[1:01:07] one's a christian and that one's a
[1:01:08] christian disclaimer believer that one
[1:01:10] claims to be a believer but
[1:01:11] twins so alike that you can't hardly
[1:01:15] tell the difference but there
[1:01:17] is a difference because god no two
[1:01:20] things are made alike by god
[1:01:22] each one is a masterpiece in its own
[1:01:25] right
[1:01:26] by his marvelous and wonderful
[1:01:29] grace praise the lord hallelujah amen
[1:01:32] you see but here is esau
[1:01:36] and he also had a desire to get that
[1:01:38] work right
[1:01:40] he had the desire to but he had like a
[1:01:44] a more casual desire to get that
[1:01:48] birth right at the time see praise the
[1:01:51] lord
[1:01:52] now friends he
[1:01:55] really first they said he had a casual
[1:01:58] desire
[1:02:00] secondly the bible tells us he despised
[1:02:03] it
[1:02:04] amen he didn't want that real
[1:02:07] responsibility on his shoulders
[1:02:10] uh he and not only that he was ashamed
[1:02:13] of it
[1:02:15] he was ashamed of that right
[1:02:18] that he had to uh take on actor
[1:02:22] at that particular time praise
[1:02:25] god hallelujah now we find friends
[1:02:29] that we can understand his attitude to
[1:02:32] this work right
[1:02:33] because it's revealed in his actions to
[1:02:36] it
[1:02:37] amen hallelujah praise the lord
[1:02:41] because as you know he let go
[1:02:44] of the birthright at a very
[1:02:48] cheap price the price
[1:02:52] of a of a plate of stew
[1:02:58] he let it go for a plate of stew
[1:03:01] somebody
[1:03:02] handed him a well uh presented plate of
[1:03:06] theology
[1:03:08] and he was willing to eat that up
[1:03:11] and let the real thing go by
[1:03:14] because this one looks so appealing to
[1:03:18] him
[1:03:19] praise god nothing against the french
[1:03:22] but let me tell you french italian when
[1:03:24] they put together
[1:03:25] a dish you know it's a whole lot of
[1:03:28] style
[1:03:30] amen but you can get a sliver of a cake
[1:03:33] or a sliver a small portion of
[1:03:37] meat called a steak like that
[1:03:41] you know it reminds me of what's his
[1:03:44] name again
[1:03:44] mr t going into new york
[1:03:48] with his limousine and his driver and he
[1:03:50] just stops and
[1:03:51] goes into a restaurant and he says give
[1:03:54] me a steak
[1:03:57] and he's waiting finally the guy comes
[1:03:59] with a platter
[1:04:01] covered with a white cloth then the guy
[1:04:03] takes the
[1:04:04] thing places it on the table and he
[1:04:06] whips off the clot like he's going to
[1:04:08] surprise you
[1:04:09] when he rips it off mr t goes and looks
[1:04:12] at he said what's that
[1:04:16] he said your steak sir he said that
[1:04:18] ain't no snake for me
[1:04:19] man he says that is no stick i'm getting
[1:04:23] out of here
[1:04:24] i'm gonna go get me some real soul food
[1:04:30] why because that's take that he he
[1:04:33] served a little filet mignon
[1:04:36] that was just like that at this big man
[1:04:39] is sitting there waiting for a steak
[1:04:41] he'll give him a little filling in y'all
[1:04:44] so
[1:04:44] i don't care about the style i want
[1:04:47] something that can
[1:04:48] feed me amen i want something that can
[1:04:51] be solid in my stomach amen
[1:04:54] praise god hallelujah amen but you see
[1:04:58] esau sold out his birthright for style
[1:05:02] and fashion he stole it out for
[1:05:06] one little plate or stew like that
[1:05:09] amen he see he was more concerned
[1:05:13] of being known that he's a christian
[1:05:19] he's a real christian man real christian
[1:05:22] woman
[1:05:23] he's sold out from getting the real
[1:05:27] thing
[1:05:27] my friends because everybody will look
[1:05:30] at him and say oh
[1:05:32] he has a good morals he's a good living
[1:05:35] womp
[1:05:36] she's a good living woman a good living
[1:05:38] man the morals are so
[1:05:40] good and praise god wonderful
[1:05:44] oh my look at that boy he saw how what a
[1:05:47] good boy he is
[1:05:48] takes care of his blind father
[1:05:53] and he works so hard and he
[1:05:57] gives money to help in the home
[1:06:00] help out with the upkeep of the house
[1:06:04] you see he was really outwardly
[1:06:08] a good boy a good young man
[1:06:11] and more than that he loved to do a lot
[1:06:14] of works in the church where he
[1:06:16] took care of his father's business he
[1:06:19] made sure
[1:06:20] that his father's business was running
[1:06:23] real
[1:06:24] good but jacob
[1:06:27] he was nothing but a trickster you see
[1:06:31] he he he was a trickster
[1:06:35] but the difference there is even though
[1:06:37] he was a trickster
[1:06:39] that there was a seed of god planted in
[1:06:42] him
[1:06:43] before the foundation of the world
[1:06:47] hallelujah and that made the difference
[1:06:51] he didn't know and nobody knew what it
[1:06:55] was
[1:06:56] that even though he was a trickster he
[1:06:58] was a con man
[1:07:00] he was he was lousy he was a mother's
[1:07:03] boy he was
[1:07:04] everything but there was something in
[1:07:06] him
[1:07:07] a hunger a thirst there was a drive in
[1:07:10] him
[1:07:11] that was driving him to get that birth
[1:07:14] right
[1:07:15] i have to know that i got it
[1:07:18] i gotta know for sure praise the name of
[1:07:21] the lord amen
[1:07:23] no matter what it was that his chief
[1:07:26] his chief's desire was to know
[1:07:29] that he had that birthright praise the
[1:07:32] lord
[1:07:33] oh my my my i don't know about you
[1:07:36] but that's my chief desire i'm thanking
[1:07:39] god because i know i got it
[1:07:42] i said i'm praising god because i know i
[1:07:45] got it
[1:07:46] you have got to know for yourself i'm
[1:07:49] not the pastor here going to announce
[1:07:50] that you got it
[1:07:52] but you must know that you've got it and
[1:07:54] you hold on to it
[1:07:56] and don't sell it out because it's your
[1:07:58] birthright
[1:08:00] you have a right to it because it was
[1:08:03] predestinated to you
[1:08:05] from before the foundation of the world
[1:08:07] glory of god
[1:08:08] hallelujah amen my god
[1:08:11] regardless of what the true elect has to
[1:08:14] go through
[1:08:16] they're not selling it out no matter
[1:08:18] what
[1:08:20] even if they have to go through derision
[1:08:23] mockings laughings
[1:08:27] scoffing if they have to go through
[1:08:30] trial
[1:08:31] tribulation no matter what it is
[1:08:35] they'll humble themselves and they'll
[1:08:37] wait because they want to
[1:08:39] grab a hold and to hold on to
[1:08:42] that but right whatever the cost
[1:08:46] hallelujah
[1:08:47] amen they got to have the promise
[1:08:50] for their age they've got to have
[1:08:54] that brought right promise for their age
[1:08:58] and to keep holding on to god's
[1:09:01] unchanging hand
[1:09:03] now if we look at the types in the word
[1:09:06] of god
[1:09:07] israel being a type of the natural
[1:09:11] church you know that
[1:09:12] israel and the church oh my their type
[1:09:15] of the natural church and their
[1:09:19] drive was to get into where
[1:09:22] canaan's land or the land of promise or
[1:09:26] the promised land
[1:09:28] that was their desire
[1:09:31] to get to that land so when they came
[1:09:34] out of
[1:09:35] egypt moses
[1:09:38] knew that he had twins on his hands
[1:09:42] he knew that he had those that were real
[1:09:46] jews and there were jews
[1:09:49] but only according to the flesh
[1:09:52] they didn't recognize who he was they
[1:09:54] didn't recognize what the pillar of fire
[1:09:57] was all about
[1:09:58] they have known not his promises his
[1:10:01] signs and wonders
[1:10:02] in the mir and miracles in the
[1:10:03] wilderness and what
[1:10:05] they meant those signposts where they
[1:10:07] were pointing
[1:10:09] they didn't recognize what god was doing
[1:10:12] and so you had the church natural and
[1:10:15] you had the elect spiritual
[1:10:18] all in the midst the bible puts it this
[1:10:20] way and it came to pass
[1:10:22] there was a mixed multitude
[1:10:26] a mixed multitude came out with that
[1:10:29] moses
[1:10:30] and i'm saying to you in this day in our
[1:10:32] day
[1:10:33] when there was one who who spoke
[1:10:36] as it was with moses so shall i be with
[1:10:39] thee
[1:10:40] one came out and brought a message and
[1:10:43] again twins came forth in this
[1:10:47] end-time revival amen both
[1:10:50] what wanted to come out of denomination
[1:10:54] both wanted to be led out by
[1:10:57] the prophet moses out from under
[1:11:00] the hand of pharaoh both had that desire
[1:11:04] to get out and to pass through that
[1:11:07] wilderness
[1:11:08] and to come to the place where they can
[1:11:11] apprehend or
[1:11:13] hold to the promise of god for this hour
[1:11:16] and for this day but only one
[1:11:19] to one was predestinated that they
[1:11:23] would have the birthright and the other
[1:11:26] would have the desire
[1:11:27] and would even seek repentance and works
[1:11:31] with tears
[1:11:32] and will not be able to receive it so i
[1:11:35] say to you who
[1:11:37] may know in your heart that you one that
[1:11:40] has received it from god that you want
[1:11:42] to thank him and praise him and glorify
[1:11:45] him
[1:11:45] because you're one out of a million that
[1:11:48] god by his holy spirit
[1:11:50] has elected you that you would
[1:11:54] understand and see and know
[1:11:57] the mystery of the kingdom of god
[1:12:01] for unto you is given but unto them
[1:12:04] it's not given to you it's like you know
[1:12:07] it's natural
[1:12:08] it's like second nature you see you
[1:12:11] don't even know how you see what you see
[1:12:13] you know how but how i know what
[1:12:16] you don't know you know but you know you
[1:12:19] don't study to know
[1:12:21] not that you didn't read or you didn't
[1:12:22] listen or and you do that
[1:12:24] but i didn't do that so that i could
[1:12:28] know or whatever
[1:12:29] it was just made known to you by the
[1:12:31] holy spirit
[1:12:33] the preacher's preaching is coming forth
[1:12:35] and all of a sudden you caught that you
[1:12:37] caught that you caught that
[1:12:38] nobody can give you that only god can
[1:12:41] give you that
[1:12:43] only god can lay that in you and that is
[1:12:46] the thing we ought to give god praise
[1:12:48] and thanks for
[1:12:50] and why i say that because it appears
[1:12:52] like it's so
[1:12:53] normal but it's normal for a human being
[1:12:57] to walk and talk
[1:13:00] amen but try to get an animal to walk
[1:13:03] and talk you literally got to put them
[1:13:05] down
[1:13:06] and use a system to train them
[1:13:10] and lay out they lay out all the
[1:13:12] principles that they have to live by
[1:13:14] walk by and this and that the other but
[1:13:17] when that holy
[1:13:18] spirit gets a hold of the true believer
[1:13:21] amen
[1:13:21] and they let go and let god have his way
[1:13:25] he will lead them and guide them every
[1:13:27] step of the way
[1:13:29] all they got to do is keep walking keep
[1:13:32] walking
[1:13:32] and as you walk the holy spirit will
[1:13:36] lead you by his mighty hand oh praise
[1:13:38] god
[1:13:39] amen so you know what we're under here
[1:13:42] we're under the same pillar of fire
[1:13:45] we're under the same light of god it's
[1:13:48] not
[1:13:48] shining up above us but it's revealing
[1:13:51] itself to us through the word of the
[1:13:53] living god
[1:13:54] hallelujah amen praise god
[1:13:57] and i'm telling you friends that when
[1:14:00] a prophet came in our day and a bride
[1:14:03] an elected group came out when the
[1:14:07] entire group came out there were
[1:14:11] impersonators come out is that right
[1:14:14] hallelujah and those impersonators
[1:14:18] didn't just vanish in the wilderness on
[1:14:20] the first day
[1:14:22] they stuck with their impersonation
[1:14:25] for 40 years one whole generation
[1:14:30] when they get to the river then a great
[1:14:33] separating time came hallelujah
[1:14:37] and you know that god knew that
[1:14:41] some fell along different times along in
[1:14:44] the wilderness
[1:14:45] for you know the bible tells us clearly
[1:14:48] and you can find
[1:14:49] in first corinthians how the bible tells
[1:14:52] us and
[1:14:52] for some that were on that journey he
[1:14:56] was not well pleased or
[1:14:59] well it's faith that causes us to please
[1:15:02] god
[1:15:03] if it tells you that for with some of
[1:15:05] them he was not
[1:15:07] well pleased it means that he's telling
[1:15:09] you they had no faith
[1:15:11] or they didn't have the faith that he
[1:15:13] was looking for
[1:15:15] amen praise the lord oh my praise
[1:15:18] god but now it tells you that
[1:15:21] israel journeyed until they got to a
[1:15:25] place called kadesh
[1:15:26] barnia amen praise god
[1:15:30] and kadesh bornea is where god told them
[1:15:35] i brought you in the wilderness i
[1:15:38] deliberately
[1:15:39] brought you into the wilderness with
[1:15:41] trials
[1:15:43] troubles heat hunger thirsts
[1:15:46] scorpions all kinds of things but i
[1:15:49] brought you
[1:15:50] under those conditions to try you
[1:15:54] i brought you out to prove you amen
[1:15:58] brother branham proving his word to
[1:16:00] prove everybody claims to be a christian
[1:16:02] but god is going to prove his word
[1:16:04] amen he's going to prove who is his word
[1:16:07] that has that
[1:16:08] gene that germ inside of them
[1:16:11] and so god doing that to he said i
[1:16:14] brought you out to prove
[1:16:15] you praise god hallelujah and back then
[1:16:19] to prove them god gave them
[1:16:22] natural tests he made them hungry
[1:16:28] he made them thirsty for water
[1:16:31] and he said i did that because i wanted
[1:16:33] to
[1:16:34] to prove you and see your attitude
[1:16:37] i wanted to see your reaction
[1:16:40] what reaction you're going to take when
[1:16:43] i do these
[1:16:44] things hallelujah oh my and you know
[1:16:47] what the bible tells us
[1:16:49] tells us clearly it it made it so clear
[1:16:53] that some began to murmur
[1:16:56] and some began to complain
[1:17:00] my god just think about god uh
[1:17:03] putting us in the wilderness and
[1:17:05] allowing kovit to come
[1:17:08] amen i tell you it'll bring out
[1:17:12] certain qualities in you if you're not
[1:17:14] watching
[1:17:15] it's going to expose a lot of things
[1:17:19] from inside of you it's going to reveal
[1:17:23] a lot of things that you think you got
[1:17:25] covered up and hidden up
[1:17:28] it's all going to be expressed praise
[1:17:31] god
[1:17:32] because our test is not a natural test
[1:17:34] for bread and water
[1:17:36] but we are going through spiritual tests
[1:17:40] amen uh praise god
[1:17:43] amen and we are going through the
[1:17:45] wilderness of this world
[1:17:47] to be tested by the word
[1:17:51] and this word brings reproach brings
[1:17:54] shame brings all kinds of things so you
[1:17:57] are
[1:17:58] tested on your stand how you're standing
[1:18:01] and how you're living
[1:18:03] for this word and by the word of the
[1:18:06] living god
[1:18:07] hallelujah amen god wants this
[1:18:10] like he said in deuteronomy i'm proving
[1:18:12] you to see when you really love me
[1:18:15] when you really want to keep my
[1:18:17] commandments my word
[1:18:19] amen i'm going to see if you're a
[1:18:21] compromiser
[1:18:22] or you're a real believer because if
[1:18:25] you're really believing nothing can move
[1:18:27] you
[1:18:29] because you're a part of me you're part
[1:18:32] of the rock
[1:18:33] and the rock doesn't move everything
[1:18:36] else moves around it but the rock won't
[1:18:38] move
[1:18:39] and you are founded upon that rock lord
[1:18:41] of god hallelujah
[1:18:43] you won't even give up one word
[1:18:45] hallelujah
[1:18:46] oh my praise god hallelujah
[1:18:50] but when this covet comes and trials
[1:18:52] come and
[1:18:53] tribulation comes some people if you
[1:18:56] don't watch it they give up because of
[1:18:58] some persecution
[1:19:01] others my friends give up
[1:19:05] because they're afraid of losing
[1:19:09] fellowship oh i will get the fellowship
[1:19:13] with the brothers once over here i won't
[1:19:16] get fellowship with this church over so
[1:19:18] and so
[1:19:19] i won't get fellowship with this other
[1:19:21] one over there listen praise
[1:19:23] god it's wonderful we have we love
[1:19:26] fellowship
[1:19:27] and we ought to have fellowship but the
[1:19:30] real
[1:19:31] fellowship each one of us should have is
[1:19:33] fellowship with him
[1:19:36] praise god is to have the fellowship
[1:19:39] with
[1:19:40] him praise the lord amen
[1:19:43] yes sir praise god so we won't deny
[1:19:46] nothing because
[1:19:47] we are part of that elect and we won't
[1:19:49] give up one
[1:19:50] inch hallelujah i said not
[1:19:53] one inch not one blade of grass this
[1:19:56] land is our land and it belongs to us
[1:19:59] this word belongs to us and we're not
[1:20:02] giving up
[1:20:03] one inch of it amen praise
[1:20:06] god joshua caleb going to that promised
[1:20:08] land you think any giant could come tell
[1:20:11] them
[1:20:11] they're going to take one part of it no
[1:20:13] sir they were going to possess their
[1:20:16] possessions
[1:20:17] and hold on to it for the glory of god
[1:20:20] amen and praise god hallelujah
[1:20:23] not mother not father
[1:20:27] amen not sister nor brother
[1:20:30] it's to put them out or they're going to
[1:20:33] give up that
[1:20:34] birthright for anything else amen praise
[1:20:37] god because the real true bride of
[1:20:40] christ
[1:20:41] holds that birthright higher than her
[1:20:43] own life she holds it higher than
[1:20:47] anything else
[1:20:48] in her evaluation that's the way she
[1:20:51] puts it
[1:20:52] god above everything else seek force the
[1:20:55] kingdom above everything else
[1:20:58] and all other things will be added unto
[1:21:01] me praise god hallelujah amen praise
[1:21:05] god glory to his wonderful name
[1:21:08] now uh going back to the fact that every
[1:21:11] age has a promise
[1:21:13] luther's age had a birthright promise
[1:21:20] anyone that did not catch the revelation
[1:21:25] that the just shall live by faith
[1:21:29] by revelation amen not by a litany
[1:21:34] not by a canned service
[1:21:37] put together in a book that can be done
[1:21:40] year after year after year
[1:21:43] nothing of that sort but that
[1:21:46] just shall live by revelation
[1:21:50] that is what rotten luther was really
[1:21:51] saying right
[1:21:53] we know how it's written there but
[1:21:55] that's what he actually was saying
[1:21:57] that the just shall live by revelation
[1:22:00] because that's what was happening he
[1:22:02] he was reading the word one day and all
[1:22:04] of a sudden
[1:22:05] it was revealed to him that that's the
[1:22:08] way
[1:22:09] god wants to deal with his people
[1:22:12] praise the lord and so that was the
[1:22:15] right promise and every believer that
[1:22:19] came
[1:22:19] and claimed that they really
[1:22:23] would receive his message had to get the
[1:22:26] same revelation he had
[1:22:28] he might have told them and they could
[1:22:30] repeat it with their mouth
[1:22:31] but they had to have it in it
[1:22:34] experientially
[1:22:36] they had to have it as an experience
[1:22:39] by god revealing to them
[1:22:42] i don't want you to have these grandiose
[1:22:44] ideas that you're going to be in your
[1:22:46] room
[1:22:46] and then all of a sudden you hear a
[1:22:48] voice and it tells you my son
[1:22:50] my word is this and no it's nothing like
[1:22:54] that
[1:22:55] it's just you and you by with god
[1:22:58] maybe you're reading your bible one day
[1:23:00] or you're listening to preacher
[1:23:02] or you're talking to a brother there's
[1:23:04] so many
[1:23:05] uh you know
[1:23:08] epiphany you can have an epiphany just
[1:23:12] like that
[1:23:13] the holy spirit making himself known
[1:23:17] to his children to each one it's a
[1:23:19] different
[1:23:20] thing to me it's different to you it's
[1:23:23] different
[1:23:24] but it doesn't matter as long as you get
[1:23:26] it and as long as
[1:23:28] god makes himself known to you and that
[1:23:30] you just don't get it one time and then
[1:23:32] it stopped and you say i got it no
[1:23:34] but it becomes a continuous because a
[1:23:38] rock follows you everywhere you go
[1:23:40] and it's always ever present water in
[1:23:43] the rock
[1:23:44] and it's always the word in the present
[1:23:47] stage of its ministry
[1:23:49] present tense truth amen for god is
[1:23:53] always moving on
[1:23:54] hallelujah amen thanks be to god amen
[1:23:58] yes praise god hallelujah so we know
[1:24:01] then
[1:24:03] that when luther declared his message
[1:24:07] out of his message had to come twins too
[1:24:10] because the prophet said every revival
[1:24:12] produces twins
[1:24:14] now we know he didn't go into things
[1:24:16] like go into it
[1:24:17] and break it down but here we are
[1:24:20] telling you
[1:24:21] that when luther came out he came
[1:24:24] out with genuine true believers that saw
[1:24:27] the word of god
[1:24:28] and he also came out with the
[1:24:30] impersonators who went
[1:24:32] on and formed the lutheran denomination
[1:24:36] one stand with the word
[1:24:40] and the others believe and claim to
[1:24:43] believe
[1:24:44] that they stayed with the world with
[1:24:46] luther's word too
[1:24:48] but they went out and formed that
[1:24:51] denomination and had themselves called
[1:24:53] lutherans see so there was twins
[1:24:57] in his day also you can follow it down
[1:25:00] through wesley
[1:25:01] how he preached the word of
[1:25:03] sanctification and so on
[1:25:05] and uh until it comes right on
[1:25:08] down to pentecost
[1:25:12] where the identification was
[1:25:15] you operate the gifts of the holy spirit
[1:25:20] that was what was for that day that it
[1:25:23] would
[1:25:23] operate like that in that day oh
[1:25:26] my think about it praise god
[1:25:30] hallelujah and so friends
[1:25:33] which i know and i've seen with my eyes
[1:25:36] and heard with my own hairs
[1:25:38] oh that people were receiving
[1:25:41] gifts and operating gifts
[1:25:45] and receiving the holy spirit and yet
[1:25:48] they were not born again
[1:25:51] they were not born again and yet they
[1:25:54] were dancing in the spirit
[1:25:56] jumping praising god genuinely sincere
[1:26:00] just like he saw bible says sincere he
[1:26:03] wasn't joking
[1:26:04] he was searching for repentance he just
[1:26:07] didn't have a seat
[1:26:09] so it doesn't matter how much he jumped
[1:26:10] how much he searched how much he cried
[1:26:12] how much he hollered
[1:26:13] or on the floors how many miracles he
[1:26:16] performed
[1:26:17] how many crowds he could gather it
[1:26:20] didn't matter
[1:26:22] he did not have that deposit of god
[1:26:25] the gift of god is eternal life through
[1:26:28] jesus christ
[1:26:29] amen by grace hallelujah that he
[1:26:32] received it
[1:26:33] and so my brothers and sisters
[1:26:37] they received the operation of these
[1:26:40] gifts within their lives
[1:26:44] and back then everybody was striving
[1:26:47] i was striving and i'm saying that
[1:26:50] because i was like at the tail end
[1:26:53] of old pentecost you know seeing some of
[1:26:56] the things that were happening amongst
[1:26:58] them
[1:26:58] and how god was moving in a mighty
[1:27:02] mighty way effortlessly without
[1:27:06] human works the holy spirit would be
[1:27:09] moving up amongst them praise the name
[1:27:12] of the lord
[1:27:13] and they did get the baptist holy spirit
[1:27:16] to come on them
[1:27:17] it did come but thank god he
[1:27:20] sent a messenger in our day
[1:27:24] because with the opening of the seven
[1:27:26] seals
[1:27:27] and with the mysteries of the mystery of
[1:27:30] god
[1:27:31] being made known and declared
[1:27:34] and by the preaching of the anointed
[1:27:36] ones at the end time
[1:27:39] we come to understand you can have the
[1:27:42] baptism of the holy spirit and i hear a
[1:27:44] lot of brothers talk about getting the
[1:27:46] baptist holy spirit
[1:27:47] he said you can have it on you everyday
[1:27:51] your life and still go to hell
[1:27:55] he wasn't preaching that under the first
[1:27:57] and second poll
[1:28:00] but later on he comes to preach the
[1:28:02] anointed ones when those seals open
[1:28:04] and said oh you can have the
[1:28:08] baptism of the holy spirit on you every
[1:28:11] day of your life
[1:28:12] and still go to hell oh
[1:28:15] my we say oh how could that be
[1:28:19] how could it be then he began to break
[1:28:21] it down because he see
[1:28:23] now it's made known to him for him he
[1:28:25] said the bible become a new bible
[1:28:27] the whole thing began so often he says
[1:28:29] what the baptist holy spirit come
[1:28:31] and settle down to their spirit
[1:28:36] but there's it can't go on whatever
[1:28:39] soul that is there because they're
[1:28:42] nothing there to
[1:28:44] rebirth there's nothing there to
[1:28:47] revive nothing there to bring to life
[1:28:51] so it come and anoint their spirit
[1:28:54] and anoint them enough that they could
[1:28:56] discern they could do miracles they
[1:28:58] could
[1:28:59] they can outdo you you know all kinds of
[1:29:01] gifts and
[1:29:02] movements of the holy spirit and things
[1:29:05] like that
[1:29:05] praise god but one gift that you have
[1:29:09] amen that that they don't have
[1:29:12] and they're looking at that and wanting
[1:29:14] to know what is it and the gift that you
[1:29:16] have is that you can hear the word
[1:29:19] you can grasp the word you can receive
[1:29:22] it praise god
[1:29:24] and it's crystal clear to you
[1:29:27] amen praise god you say oh i believe the
[1:29:31] message oh there's a lot just that
[1:29:33] statement
[1:29:35] if you know what you're really saying uh
[1:29:38] oh praise
[1:29:38] god hallelujah amen i thank god
[1:29:42] hallelujah because i know many back
[1:29:45] there that spoke in tongues
[1:29:47] amen but they weren't born again
[1:29:51] i think i told you here how uh how
[1:29:54] one of my uh schoolmate who later became
[1:29:58] a big
[1:29:59] interpreter and translator in the
[1:30:01] government or
[1:30:02] whatever else you know uh we
[1:30:05] he want us to pray for him to receive
[1:30:07] the holy ghost to
[1:30:09] praise god so we lay hands upon him and
[1:30:12] oh my the
[1:30:13] baptism came on him he started speaking
[1:30:16] in towns and everything else
[1:30:18] but he's speaking in tongues
[1:30:21] but let's say something just
[1:30:24] told me and the brother that was with me
[1:30:29] that's a devil that's not the holy ghost
[1:30:34] even though he's speaking in towns and i
[1:30:37] looked at we didn't talk
[1:30:38] i just looked at him and he looked at me
[1:30:40] and we were kind of startled
[1:30:43] and then i said then you spoke to that
[1:30:45] devil
[1:30:46] and say you devil you try to deceive us
[1:30:51] that you are the holy spirit and you're
[1:30:54] a devil
[1:30:55] and you're speaking in towns and the
[1:30:58] devil just
[1:31:00] just laugh and then he begins to tell
[1:31:03] his history and so on which i won't go
[1:31:05] into
[1:31:06] where he came from and listen uh oh my
[1:31:10] and from that day i was still in
[1:31:12] pentecost
[1:31:14] i knew tongues couldn't be the evidence
[1:31:17] so when the prophet's message came and
[1:31:19] he spoke ah
[1:31:21] now you got a confirmation here's a
[1:31:24] prophet saying it now
[1:31:26] you see you can even believe it but
[1:31:28] you're still not
[1:31:29] certain amen but a prophet comes and
[1:31:32] says
[1:31:33] thus saith the lord amen that makes you
[1:31:37] certain of god hallelujah my brother
[1:31:40] sister
[1:31:42] i tell you i knew that and of course you
[1:31:45] know
[1:31:46] when a seal breaks when something like
[1:31:48] that breaks it starts to bring
[1:31:49] disturbance
[1:31:50] because imagine you go in the
[1:31:52] denomination and you're going to their
[1:31:54] foundational
[1:31:55] doctrine to tell them that that's
[1:31:58] not scriptural who are you you're not
[1:32:02] even a theologian you don't even have a
[1:32:04] dd brother philip
[1:32:05] oh can you tell me that we you know
[1:32:08] oh so that was something else but i'm
[1:32:11] saying
[1:32:12] to you my friends is that the
[1:32:15] prophet made clear that later
[1:32:19] that the evidence because you know which
[1:32:22] i won't touch on
[1:32:23] that one time he preached that it was it
[1:32:25] was love
[1:32:27] you know another he preached it was the
[1:32:29] fruits of the spirit
[1:32:31] like that and that's why they don't
[1:32:34] understand brother branham's
[1:32:35] message is out there like that and
[1:32:37] they're reading from 1940
[1:32:40] 45 or 44 and they're coming down
[1:32:45] and they're taking it all and jungle it
[1:32:46] together
[1:32:48] and they don't understand that he was
[1:32:50] growing also
[1:32:52] just like anybody else he was growing in
[1:32:55] his understanding of what god wanted to
[1:32:57] do with him and through him
[1:32:59] and so later on he says oh myself and
[1:33:02] brother vale were talking
[1:33:04] and we were talking about love and this
[1:33:06] and that and i said you know
[1:33:08] that seems to be the foundational thing
[1:33:11] brother vale
[1:33:12] i believe love is the evidence and we
[1:33:14] held to that
[1:33:15] that love is the evidence but somewhere
[1:33:18] else listen what he says
[1:33:19] but when an angel of god from heaven
[1:33:23] comes
[1:33:23] down and stands before you
[1:33:26] amen and tells you it's not love
[1:33:30] did not our lord say when he the spirit
[1:33:34] of truth has come
[1:33:36] what will he do what's the evidence he
[1:33:38] will guide you into all
[1:33:40] truth and show you
[1:33:43] things to come there is the evidence
[1:33:47] according to the lord himself this is
[1:33:50] the angel speaking to him
[1:33:51] oh my he says what are you going to say
[1:33:53] then oh my goodness
[1:33:56] so the to receive the holy ghost
[1:33:59] is to receive a understanding
[1:34:02] of the word of god hallelujah revealed
[1:34:06] to you by god himself
[1:34:08] and then in the future whom he says and
[1:34:10] then go out and live it
[1:34:13] hallelujah how are you going to know
[1:34:17] to live it if you don't have a
[1:34:19] revelation of what you're supposed to be
[1:34:21] living
[1:34:23] you're just living hoping to hit it hit
[1:34:26] the bull's-eye or hit it this way or
[1:34:27] that
[1:34:28] but the real believer knows that once
[1:34:31] they have
[1:34:31] caught the revelation by the holy spirit
[1:34:34] now
[1:34:35] they just walk they just walk
[1:34:39] praise god oh my goodness i walked into
[1:34:43] that
[1:34:45] you know what they're not going to fall
[1:34:47] down there and cry
[1:34:49] they're going to rise and try again they
[1:34:52] just keep walking
[1:34:53] because they know the lord is with them
[1:34:56] and he promised he would never leave
[1:34:58] them
[1:34:59] but he'll be with them to the very end
[1:35:01] of the age
[1:35:02] and now they understand that that means
[1:35:05] that because i'll be
[1:35:06] in you and with you for the end to the
[1:35:09] very end of the age
[1:35:11] because he was with you all the time all
[1:35:14] the time
[1:35:15] it was in you but then he had to make
[1:35:17] you aware
[1:35:18] that i am when you i'm with you every
[1:35:21] step of the way praise
[1:35:22] god hallelujah he's in your falling
[1:35:25] you're standing he's in your sleeping
[1:35:27] he's in your waking
[1:35:28] he's in your everything he's everything
[1:35:31] to me amen
[1:35:33] i said he's everything to me oh praise
[1:35:36] god hallelujah amen yes sir
[1:35:40] oh praise god amen and then you know
[1:35:45] that once you are conscious of having
[1:35:47] that word right in you
[1:35:50] in other words you have the right birth
[1:35:52] everybody's saying they have it but
[1:35:54] you know that you have the right birth
[1:35:56] praise the lord
[1:35:58] so here it is brother you start to
[1:36:01] realize
[1:36:02] that then even while i'm living this
[1:36:05] life his life my mistakes then are
[1:36:08] covered by his blood
[1:36:11] because it's his life that i'm living
[1:36:14] and he already shed his blood
[1:36:16] and it cleanses us from all sin
[1:36:19] all the mistakes praise the lord
[1:36:21] hallelujah
[1:36:22] you gotta you don't let me say that
[1:36:26] because praise the lord you in other
[1:36:29] words you've been issued a pardon
[1:36:31] before you even went and committed any
[1:36:33] crime
[1:36:35] just think about it
[1:36:39] you you've been issued a partner and you
[1:36:42] didn't commit the crime as yet
[1:36:43] amen but god being god he looks ahead
[1:36:47] and he knows everything we're gonna do
[1:36:48] praise the name of the lord and already
[1:36:51] issue
[1:36:52] you a pardon so you come in the world
[1:36:54] already pardoned
[1:36:56] you come in the world already justified
[1:36:59] you never sin in the first place the
[1:37:02] sins you
[1:37:03] made which is what uh which i paused
[1:37:05] here satan always gets us with that to
[1:37:08] make you condemn yourself
[1:37:09] because we we we come in and get trapped
[1:37:12] in the human flesh and you will make
[1:37:14] mistakes
[1:37:15] i don't care who you are he said i look
[1:37:18] dumb and i look for one righteous and
[1:37:20] there was not
[1:37:21] one righteous not one
[1:37:24] what but lord there's priests there's
[1:37:26] high priests there's all kinds of
[1:37:28] kings and good people yes there were
[1:37:31] but there's still subject to making
[1:37:34] mistakes hallelujah oh praise
[1:37:38] god but thank god in us
[1:37:41] there is a germ there's a gene there's a
[1:37:44] seed of god
[1:37:46] and as first john says the seed of god
[1:37:49] does not commit sin
[1:37:53] doesn't mean your flesh out here don't
[1:37:56] commit sin
[1:37:58] but that man inside there don't want to
[1:38:01] commit sin
[1:38:03] he has no desire to sin that's why the
[1:38:07] bible says
[1:38:07] but if you sin you see how it puts it
[1:38:11] because it knows your will but you don't
[1:38:13] really want to
[1:38:14] but if you sin you have an advocate with
[1:38:17] the father
[1:38:18] jesus christ the righteous hallelujah
[1:38:20] praise
[1:38:21] be to god hallelujah we're not excusing
[1:38:24] sinning
[1:38:25] but we're making clear to you that you
[1:38:28] are not
[1:38:29] done in guilt and condemnation and
[1:38:32] wallow in the valley of despair
[1:38:34] but rise to the mountain tops of hope
[1:38:37] and help
[1:38:37] because our god is our help amen praise
[1:38:41] god i look onto the hills from where's
[1:38:43] come at my head
[1:38:44] my help comes from the capstone my heart
[1:38:48] comes from him
[1:38:49] he is the same yesterday the day and
[1:38:51] forever
[1:38:53] amen praise god hallelujah
[1:38:56] glad i'm inside the age of grace praise
[1:39:00] god i'm not here by my good works
[1:39:03] i'm not talking like this because of my
[1:39:05] own
[1:39:06] study of my own morals or your own
[1:39:08] morals
[1:39:09] i am here you are here but for the grace
[1:39:12] of god
[1:39:14] it's the grace of god what grace
[1:39:17] through his choosing one
[1:39:20] conscious of it no nothing about it but
[1:39:23] i just
[1:39:25] i don't know why he loved me amen
[1:39:29] why did he have to have his mind his
[1:39:31] thoughts on me
[1:39:32] that's what brother branham said amen
[1:39:35] it could have been a million others but
[1:39:38] you
[1:39:39] were elected and that makes you who you
[1:39:42] are by his grace not that you were
[1:39:45] better like abraham better than anybody
[1:39:48] else
[1:39:48] but god in his own mind knows why he
[1:39:51] chose you
[1:39:52] and that's his business of why he did it
[1:39:55] and so that's why we are here and that's
[1:39:57] why we walk so humble
[1:39:59] and matter of fact you almost walk
[1:40:01] hidden
[1:40:03] as the bible talks about god's hidden
[1:40:05] ones
[1:40:06] you don't even want to be known
[1:40:08] recognized for nothing
[1:40:10] because there is nothing there except
[1:40:13] for he himself if you want to recognize
[1:40:15] him amen
[1:40:16] praise the name of the lord amen praise
[1:40:19] god
[1:40:19] we haven't come here now to add on some
[1:40:22] works
[1:40:25] we're not here to add on works on it
[1:40:27] amen
[1:40:28] praise god hallelujah the reason why
[1:40:32] brother brother we are getting
[1:40:34] revelation
[1:40:35] is because we're living so holy
[1:40:38] we're living good oh
[1:40:41] my brother you get revelation because
[1:40:44] you're
[1:40:45] fasting and praying for 14 days oh
[1:40:48] you're separating yourself before god
[1:40:51] and by yourself and that's why the bible
[1:40:55] breaking up and opening up to you no
[1:40:58] that's not the reason why it's open to
[1:41:01] you
[1:41:02] because god knows you and knows what
[1:41:04] he's placed in you
[1:41:06] and even if you did nothing he would
[1:41:08] still open the word of god to you
[1:41:11] when the time comes for you to know he
[1:41:13] said they will
[1:41:14] know when it is time for them to go
[1:41:18] amen god will make his word known praise
[1:41:21] the lord
[1:41:22] amen praise god i want you to get this
[1:41:25] idea
[1:41:26] we're not getting anything by works
[1:41:30] by any merit anything we
[1:41:33] earn we're all getting it by
[1:41:36] grace grace
[1:41:40] hallelujah praise god there's a capstone
[1:41:46] and what did the bible says and when he
[1:41:49] restores the capstone it will
[1:41:51] come down crying grace grace
[1:41:55] grace grace hallelujah his grace and
[1:42:00] mercy
[1:42:02] has brought me through it's his grace
[1:42:04] and mercy
[1:42:06] sometimes i wonder lord how you have
[1:42:08] patience with me how you have grace with
[1:42:10] me
[1:42:10] i i don't even know how i'm making it
[1:42:13] true but but lord i'm just making it
[1:42:15] through by your grace
[1:42:17] it's just you that's keeping me alive
[1:42:19] it's just you that's watching over me
[1:42:22] it's just you that's covering me under
[1:42:23] your blood it's just you that's leading
[1:42:26] and guiding me every step of the way
[1:42:29] i can't claim anything it's just by the
[1:42:32] grace
[1:42:33] of almighty god when we look around
[1:42:36] us everything around us people around us
[1:42:40] believers so so-called around us seem to
[1:42:42] be falling away from us
[1:42:45] falling away from us and around us
[1:42:49] and god continually leading
[1:42:52] us into deeper and deeper truths and
[1:42:56] revelations of himself
[1:42:58] oh my oh praise god the seed
[1:43:02] will not be heir with the shock and
[1:43:05] god is fulfilling his word in this
[1:43:09] last day in which we live praise the
[1:43:11] lord amen
[1:43:12] yes sir praise god hallelujah
[1:43:16] oh my how wonderful is it isn't it
[1:43:19] wonderful to you
[1:43:20] oh it's marvelous and wonderful to me

[1:43:32] it's settled in heaven you might go
[1:43:34] through all kinds of different actions

[1:43:38] going to come to one end anyway
[1:43:40] that he's looking at so it's settled in

[1:44:33] glowing with the light of god around you
