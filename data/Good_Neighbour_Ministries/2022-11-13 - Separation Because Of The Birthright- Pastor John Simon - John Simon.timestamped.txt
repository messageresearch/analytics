[40:47] I want to see also I'm very proud and
[40:50] thankful to every one of you that
[40:53] supported the effort for the family
[40:58] they needed like helpers people to work
[41:01] whether it's in the kitchen whether it
[41:03] was to give to help the support because
[41:06] they had much more people than they had
[41:09] planned for
[41:11] and they thought they just have a few
[41:13] hundred and maybe they had you know
[41:16] maybe half a half a thousand maybe about
[41:18] 500 people and some did not even come to
[41:22] the reception which um you know people
[41:25] were outside from the funeral
[41:28] um having to watch on uh remotely and
[41:32] some others had to go home and just
[41:34] watch it being streamed and Mr Johnson
[41:38] let me know that
[41:41] um after it that people they were
[41:44] texting him constantly from England
[41:46] Jamaica other countries
[41:49] um like that they were so blessed by the
[41:52] entire service and so we thank God for
[41:55] that and uh amen
[41:57] [Applause]
[42:03] and I want you to know that the church
[42:06] was behind that all the way and even now
[42:11] that they had more people and believe
[42:13] that we will try to uh uh kind of brace
[42:17] up that family just a little more right
[42:20] because it just at the last minute you
[42:23] know uh running out of a few essentials
[42:26] in the midst of everything and then
[42:28] there had to be a an effort to get
[42:31] things going so uh we we I want you to
[42:34] know we did our part
[42:36] uh you might not know it but we've done
[42:38] our part and we'll continue to do so in
[42:41] about a week's time a couple of us may
[42:44] just go up there and uh talk with the
[42:47] family again sing pray and God bless
[42:49] them right praise God you we can't be
[42:52] with them every day every night from

[43:31] the Lord amen
[43:35] foreign
[43:45] God
[43:48] verses 19 to 24. let's read God's word
[43:54] and these are the generations of Isaac
[44:00] Abraham's son
[44:02] for Abraham begot
[44:05] Isaac
[44:07] and Isaac was 40 years old when he took
[44:12] Rebecca to wife
[44:14] the daughter of betuel the Syrian of
[44:18] padhana ram the sister Taliban the
[44:22] Syrian
[44:23] and Isaac entreated the Lord for his
[44:27] wife because she was barren
[44:31] and the Lord wasn't treated of him and
[44:34] Rebecca his wife conceived
[44:38] and the children struggled
[44:41] together within her
[44:45] and she said if it be so why am I thus
[44:49] and she went to inquire of the Lord and
[44:53] the Lord said unto her two nations are
[44:56] in thy womb
[44:58] and to manner of people shall be
[45:01] separated from thy vowels and the one
[45:06] people shall be stronger than the other
[45:08] and the Elder Shall Serve the young girl
[45:10] and when our days to be delivered were
[45:12] fulfilled behold they were twins in her
[45:16] womb praise the Lord God bless his word
[45:18] father we thank you for the word that
[45:22] you've given to us and now as we pick up
[45:25] that word we pray that the word of God
[45:29] will transmute transform itself and
[45:32] reveal itself to your children who are
[45:36] equipped and sent here with the ability
[45:40] to receive it in the way you want them
[45:42] to receive it father bless us today we
[45:46] pray in Jesus name amen and amen God
[45:50] bless you all praise the Lord
[45:55] now um we know um we have been preaching
[45:59] the word in such a way
[46:01] in a way it's pointing out the
[46:04] separation uh that is taking place uh
[46:09] right now not human Separation by us
[46:13] separating ourselves from anybody
[46:16] but the Holy Spirit doing his own work
[46:20] but at the same time what God is
[46:22] actually doing
[46:24] uh to create or to cause that separation
[46:28] is to uh pinpoint
[46:31] where the Antichrist is hiding in the
[46:36] church today
[46:39] because the church is now in the Harvest
[46:43] time or what you may say is the grand
[46:46] age
[46:47] when the word comes to the place where
[46:51] it is ripened and it can be uh visibly
[46:55] distinguished one from the other
[46:59] and a youthful days when we was wheat is
[47:03] planted you can't tell the difference
[47:06] between wheat and grass
[47:08] because all the blades come up looking
[47:11] the same
[47:12] when they come to maturity then the
[47:16] difference starts becoming apparent
[47:19] it's becoming real until you can't even
[47:23] avoid seeing the difference
[47:25] and this is what we are talking about
[47:28] with this series of messages
[47:31] is God by the holy spirit is trying to
[47:35] identify to us
[47:38] the spirit of the Antichrist which was
[47:43] always in the womb of the church
[47:47] it was always there quickly as the
[47:50] scripture says here and
[47:52] Rebecca conceived and the children
[47:55] uh were fighting
[47:58] together in her
[48:01] they were fighting right in the womb
[48:03] praise God now we don't want to this
[48:06] would be a message because you got to go
[48:08] back in the mind of God what fighting
[48:10] was taking place in heaven and come on
[48:12] down and all that but the fact is the
[48:15] Bible is telling us in a short precise
[48:17] Dynamic way
[48:19] that the children were already fighting
[48:23] and they were fighting struggling in the
[48:26] womb now just naturally imagine that
[48:29] with a woman with two with twins in the
[48:32] womb and they're kicking and fighting
[48:34] and everything else she must have had a
[48:36] time of her life uh oh my but there it
[48:39] is
[48:40] and uh uh she said if this be so why am
[48:47] I enough in other words if this is the
[48:49] Lord doing this
[48:51] why why these children peaceful they're
[48:54] fighting something is going on here if
[48:57] this is the Lord it should be peace it
[48:59] should be nice it should be wonderful
[49:02] the same thing naturally this is the
[49:05] Church of God and if this should be the
[49:08] house of God why is it not peace why why
[49:13] do you have to always
[49:15] be on guard be vigilant and to recognize
[49:19] what Spirits here or people you are
[49:23] intermingling with we'll get to that in
[49:26] a minute because we realize that here
[49:30] that this is rarely a uh uh what should
[49:34] I say God projecting the fact that the
[49:39] time will come when
[49:41] himself and Satan will actually be
[49:45] fighting within the confines of the
[49:48] Church of the Living God
[49:50] and he wants us to know that that is
[49:53] going to happen but it's been prefigured
[49:56] and presented to us in the in this way
[50:00] that we creatures of Senses can
[50:04] understand what was going to happen and
[50:08] is happening now in our day
[50:12] no Brother Bruno Mars said Satan and the
[50:15] bride will have to come face to face
[50:18] again just as Eve came face to face with
[50:22] Satan in the Garden of Eden but she was
[50:26] defiled or beguiled as the Bible says it
[50:30] and there we understand all sin started
[50:34] praise God hallelujah but now it's not
[50:38] the spirit anymore of let's say is a
[50:42] fighting Jacob it is but it isn't uh
[50:47] Jacob and Esau coming with satanic power
[50:51] in this hour we find out if Satan
[50:56] fighting against God
[50:58] and he's fighting against God in the
[51:01] church
[51:02] and it's going on while we speak
[51:05] Hallelujah now God fighting against
[51:09] Satan how's he doing it
[51:11] God Christ in his brain
[51:15] fighting against Satan praise God
[51:19] because the bride has now become the
[51:22] word
[51:23] and the word is fighting against
[51:25] unbelief
[51:27] the word is fighting against lies the
[51:30] word is fighting against Darkness the
[51:33] word is fighting against anything
[51:34] contrary to himself amen hallelujah and
[51:40] I want you to know as we've preached the
[51:43] past weeks Satan is here
[51:46] trying to impersonate the word
[51:50] in his men and women that he may be
[51:54] using in this hour
[51:57] so there's a face-to-face fighting going
[52:00] on
[52:01] and it's going on between God and Satan
[52:06] amen so it's not men that are fighting
[52:11] but his spirits in men that are fighting
[52:15] do you get this we're not we're not
[52:17] fighting anybody but it's spirits in
[52:19] people in men that are actually fighting
[52:24] amen praise God now you understand then
[52:28] what I'm saying is that each one has
[52:31] temples
[52:32] and God has temples
[52:35] and Satan has his temples
[52:38] and God in his Temple is again fighting
[52:41] against Satan in his temples
[52:44] and the temples are men no ye not
[52:48] you know your body is the Temple of the
[52:51] Holy Ghost so these temples are actually
[52:55] fighting against one another in that way
[52:59] hallelujah amen praise God and then
[53:04] Satan will say to you
[53:07] it's in the Bible
[53:09] what are you talking about
[53:11] but then the word will answer and say
[53:14] yes it's in the Bible but I say it's
[53:17] written
[53:19] I know it's written but this is what it
[53:22] is just us oh it's no different but it's
[53:25] the same thing but one is written and
[53:27] one is by Revelation
[53:29] and the revelation of the word right of
[53:34] the word of God is what causes a
[53:37] separation
[53:38] the separation is caused by the
[53:41] birthright and whenever somebody gets
[53:44] the right verse it will start to create
[53:48] a separation praise God hallelujah amen
[53:51] oh my praise the Lord so he he stood up
[53:56] Satan on that mount of Temptation he
[53:59] stood right in the face let's look at
[54:02] how thirsty as we say he is that he
[54:06] stood right in front of the word himself
[54:10] and he is withstanding the word himself
[54:13] and he is telling the word what is
[54:17] written about him
[54:19] and say in his written Jesus said yes
[54:22] but it is also written and he take it
[54:25] further to show him what you say there
[54:27] that's what it said on his you stop
[54:29] there but if this is it more more and he
[54:32] can go on forever and Satan gotta go
[54:35] back he's trying again it is written in
[54:37] the Bible the Bible says so and so amen
[54:41] praise God but Jesus said but look at
[54:43] what you say is written it means this
[54:46] this this this this this that party in
[54:48] written amen but it is written oh my oh
[54:52] yes and then finally he had it he said
[54:55] tempt not the Lord thy God thank God
[54:57] Amen praise God and put him down praise
[55:01] God and they're saying the same thing
[55:03] now to us oh look in the Bible where did
[55:06] you get that I never heard that before
[55:08] that's not my problem if you never heard
[55:10] it before
[55:13] is it the truth or is it not the truth
[55:16] amen amen if it's not the truth you got
[55:18] it right to take the take the word where
[55:20] you're saying it's written and so it's
[55:23] not the truth but if it's the truth just
[55:26] like with Stephen you can't withstand
[55:28] the word by which Stephen's smoke you
[55:31] can't go against it because it is the
[55:33] truth the prophet said truth escape the
[55:36] truth and it don't change it Remains the
[55:39] Same as it always was praise the Lord
[55:42] God hallelujah amen glory to God I want
[55:46] to know is the truth praise God I tell
[55:49] you friends in this hour where the
[55:51] deception is so close where would we be
[55:53] without Jesus where we would we be
[55:57] without him uh we would be fun trying to
[55:59] use human senses to differentiate and to
[56:03] detect because it's so close amen praise
[56:07] God and here in Cain and Abel we see
[56:10] that separation when the birthright
[56:13] became apparent that aimed to Abel that
[56:16] he already had it that it was in him he
[56:20] caught Revelation in that hour without
[56:22] there being any written word around
[56:26] and God revealed to him that it was a
[56:30] lamb that was to be killed Hallelujah so
[56:35] Abel had a revelation not only of his
[56:39] sacrifice that was going to be made but
[56:42] he had a revelation of Z sacrifice that
[56:46] was going to be made for all the rest of
[56:49] the seed that were like him
[56:51] and that's what he understood by faith
[56:54] April brought forth a better a sacrifice
[56:58] amen hallelujah amen and when he saw
[57:02] that that uh it's the lamb that would
[57:06] take or pay the price for sin he ceased
[57:09] from his works because there's nothing
[57:13] he can do like game to prove or work
[57:16] something up it was the work of God so
[57:20] he entered into the believer's rest
[57:24] I hope you have entered into the
[57:26] believer's rest
[57:28] for the True Believer she says from
[57:31] their own works and they enter into the
[57:34] rest of God what rest resting on the
[57:38] word hallelujah oh praise God that's
[57:41] where we are resting today we're resting
[57:44] on the word of the Living God hallelujah
[57:47] amen oh my yes sir he knew of a short of
[57:53] us surely by the Revelation that he
[57:56] caught that it was not by works of
[57:59] righteousness by which we have done but
[58:02] by his mercy and Grace that we have
[58:05] saved this morning Hallelujah by his
[58:09] mercy and Grace we are seated we are
[58:11] standing we are talking we're rejoicing
[58:14] we're singing because of the grace of
[58:16] God to our souls Hallelujah
[58:21] amen and God Vindicated his sacrifice
[58:25] don't worry children I'll tell you this
[58:28] bride the Vindication of this bride and
[58:31] what the bride is expressing is going to
[58:33] be fully Vindicated amen it's starting
[58:36] to but it will be fully when the Canton
[58:39] and become apparent to all
[58:42] amen we all start from the same starting
[58:45] point like he said in the marginal
[58:47] divorce but he says when you're close
[58:49] together you're going from many miles
[58:51] you're still pretty close you know but
[58:53] it's just slowly
[58:55] it starts he says by time you get 50
[58:59] miles out or 100 miles out the thing is
[59:01] so far apart you can't even you don't
[59:04] have to guess but there is a big huge
[59:07] difference both call themselves
[59:09] Christian but it starts out so and
[59:11] everybody's innocent everybody is
[59:13] wonderful it's nice but then slowly you
[59:16] see you see something going like this
[59:18] amen it's not Apparent at first but then
[59:21] later on you see the Gap becomes so wide
[59:23] that you can recognize it for yourself
[59:27] amen praise be to God hallelujah now
[59:32] we know there is another separation
[59:37] see and that is between Abraham and lot
[59:44] amen luck was a colonel Seeker amen he
[59:49] always was
[59:51] thinking about this big thing thinking
[59:54] about that big thing always thinking of
[59:57] big things and things with a lot of
[1:00:00] tinsel on it now uh we're not preaching
[1:00:04] about Christmas but the prophet talks
[1:00:06] about cancer being on it in other words
[1:00:09] they have got to have their Church
[1:00:12] filled with a lot of shiny things and
[1:00:14] tinsel things and if they're going to
[1:00:17] have a program or they're going to have
[1:00:19] it they have to put all kinds of stuff
[1:00:21] trying to attract people's attention
[1:00:25] amen but you see it's the opposite
[1:00:28] it wants to be God once the height and
[1:00:31] simplicity not to attract people's
[1:00:34] attention he only wants to attack the
[1:00:36] brain's attention
[1:00:38] the rest of it is only going to be
[1:00:40] trouble the rest of this is gonna be
[1:00:42] death and trial and he don't really want
[1:00:46] that see that Spirit of love
[1:00:49] wants the big things something with a
[1:00:53] lot of things lot on it see because it's
[1:00:58] just like a monkey
[1:01:00] yeah that's not me saying that the
[1:01:02] prophet is talking about there's a lot
[1:01:04] of Monkey Business going on within the
[1:01:07] message
[1:01:08] where people are being caught up with
[1:01:11] bright objects bright things bright
[1:01:14] individuals who are bright shining
[1:01:17] personalities they're caught up you know
[1:01:19] there's things where we talked about
[1:01:21] that the time will come they get caught
[1:01:23] up with personalities and celebrities
[1:01:25] and start to drift from the word because
[1:01:28] they're following that instead of
[1:01:30] keeping their eyes and being led by the
[1:01:33] word of God but they don't have faith in
[1:01:36] their own faith so they want to put the
[1:01:38] faith in some mind that he must be right
[1:01:42] they are I follow him because he must be
[1:01:45] right but you see we want you not just
[1:01:49] to follow me or any man else but to keep
[1:01:54] your eyes on the word we are teaching
[1:01:56] and let the word lead you and guide you
[1:02:00] through for the glory of God
[1:02:03] so you have your individual Revelation
[1:02:05] individual salvation but you know the
[1:02:08] word of God says he puts you on the
[1:02:10] Shepherds and pastors but the real
[1:02:12] Pastor is the one above yeah
[1:02:16] because he leads that Pastor the pastor
[1:02:19] leads you amen praise God but you are
[1:02:22] really in the original you're led by the
[1:02:26] holy spirit amen and he will always lead
[1:02:30] you to the perfect light of the word of
[1:02:32] God see them things are just like a
[1:02:36] monkey and I don't know about you but
[1:02:38] when I look around there's a lot of
[1:02:40] Monkey Business going on
[1:02:42] always wanted to have these bright shiny
[1:02:45] things all and he says it here and
[1:02:48] always reaching out for bright things
[1:02:52] all around them see oh my that Spirit
[1:02:56] hasn't left the Earth that spirit is
[1:03:00] with them people even here today
[1:03:03] do you believe that
[1:03:06] oh we have this big convention oh we
[1:03:09] have oh you know who that's going to be
[1:03:11] this is going to be brother soon so oh
[1:03:14] man you've got to go to this one if you
[1:03:17] miss that oh you're gonna miss out on
[1:03:19] some you see it just in the real
[1:03:21] believer listens for the word doesn't
[1:03:23] care brother who is talking
[1:03:26] I don't care what name he puts on it
[1:03:29] I bring it back to we have uh oh this
[1:03:32] brother has this Mighty gift this
[1:03:34] brother is a great preacher and I listen
[1:03:37] to some believer bring them in and while
[1:03:39] they're talking the holy spirit says
[1:03:41] there homosexuality is there oh over
[1:03:44] there there is this there and then you
[1:03:46] have to stop it quietly they don't know
[1:03:48] you stop it so they think it's normal
[1:03:51] huh may you stop it behind the scene
[1:03:53] because you recognize what's hiding back
[1:03:55] of the veil what God is saying that is
[1:03:58] happening and going to happen in a
[1:04:00] bigger scale it may not be publicized
[1:04:03] but he is going to discern them things
[1:04:06] in his own body
[1:04:08] Hallelujah and buying them and cast them
[1:04:11] out for the glory and praise of the
[1:04:14] Living God hallelujah amen you see them
[1:04:18] that them spirits
[1:04:21] will always reach out like that for
[1:04:23] bright things in other words then he
[1:04:26] says like like lot going to that City in
[1:04:30] other words bright lights they like to
[1:04:32] go over those bright lights and
[1:04:34] everything everybody is so well-dressed
[1:04:37] and looking shiny uh you know the Lord
[1:04:40] himself was of no appearance don't want
[1:04:42] no no attraction to him except you're
[1:04:45] attracted by what you see in him the
[1:04:48] whole praise God hallelujah amen see
[1:04:51] them people like that they want the
[1:04:55] biggest churches in the city
[1:04:58] they want the most intellectual pastors
[1:05:02] see they they want the best dressed
[1:05:07] people that want where the mayor goes
[1:05:10] see it's still that same Spirit
[1:05:15] Hallelujah and
[1:05:18] remember this
[1:05:20] he says
[1:05:21] they're really did have the book right
[1:05:27] Pentecostal had the holy spirit for
[1:05:29] their age is that right but they didn't
[1:05:32] recognize the fullness of it
[1:05:35] and then they find out but by their
[1:05:38] action when the birthright come to them
[1:05:41] in another shape and form they rejected
[1:05:43] showing that they didn't really know
[1:05:46] even what it was when they got it the
[1:05:49] first time so here he says it let me say
[1:05:51] it in his words uh really they already
[1:05:55] have the book rights to begin with
[1:05:58] and call themselves a church
[1:06:01] but they lose it
[1:06:04] because they despise it amen see they
[1:06:09] despise it completely and they didn't
[1:06:13] because it was their nature to do that
[1:06:16] when the time came
[1:06:18] Hallelujah when the things start to
[1:06:22] reveal and The Germ the gene of God
[1:06:25] starts to be watered by the water from
[1:06:29] the prophetic Rock and they start coming
[1:06:32] to life then we find out right there the
[1:06:37] difference started slowly to be made
[1:06:41] manifested but it's in their nature he
[1:06:45] said to do that
[1:06:47] and to reject that birth right see all
[1:06:51] my because there is the spirit of The
[1:06:55] Crow and the dove
[1:06:57] oh Hallelujah Then There It Is they
[1:07:01] crave that because that is what they are
[1:07:05] that is what they are amen and you are
[1:07:10] acting according to what you are amen
[1:07:14] it's not something you put on something
[1:07:16] you make up that is what you are
[1:07:20] Hallelujah there are see one wanted to
[1:07:24] get away from it but the other one you
[1:07:27] couldn't even keep him away from it
[1:07:29] because that's why the election of God
[1:07:32] hallelujah the election of God you
[1:07:35] couldn't keep him away from it oh
[1:07:38] Hallelujah he is born Now by a spiritual
[1:07:42] man amen or a spiritual woman something
[1:07:48] in him calls for that he's talking about
[1:07:51] born by the spiritual man Christ and a
[1:07:54] real spiritual church that's what he's
[1:07:56] talking about here not talking about a
[1:07:59] natural spiritual man and spiritual
[1:08:00] woman and that way and because of that
[1:08:03] he Longs for it I hopes you can
[1:08:06] recognize it I hope this gets you down
[1:08:09] to a place where we can see what I mean
[1:08:13] by capping this all off he's capping it
[1:08:17] off capping off his messages amen praise
[1:08:21] God now
[1:08:23] as long as there were associated
[1:08:26] together the church natural and the
[1:08:29] church spiritual
[1:08:31] they never did get the blessings
[1:08:34] Jacob was never blessed until he
[1:08:38] separated himself from Esau do you
[1:08:42] believe that
[1:08:43] amen and Abraham was never blessed until
[1:08:49] he separated himself from lot
[1:08:53] amen I want you to see the blessing come
[1:08:56] by the separation and the separation
[1:09:00] come by Revelation or the birthright
[1:09:03] amen Separation by the book right
[1:09:07] hallelujah amen yes oh my now Jesus and
[1:09:13] speaking of the second coming he said as
[1:09:16] it was in the days of Noah they shall be
[1:09:19] eating and drinking oh my marrying and
[1:09:24] giving in marriage but when he spoke of
[1:09:27] the days of lot he's never said it like
[1:09:31] that
[1:09:32] amen
[1:09:34] he never said it like that he said as in
[1:09:38] the days of lot so shall it be now you
[1:09:43] see that one was for Revelation to be
[1:09:48] revealed because that's the same day
[1:09:50] when the son of man is being revealed
[1:09:53] and this is all wrapped up in what he's
[1:09:56] saying here in that day that's different
[1:09:58] from what he's talking about uh uh Noah
[1:10:01] there there's of Noah amen but thank God
[1:10:05] I'm glad we are here and God has
[1:10:07] fortified that that if the enemy comes
[1:10:09] in like a flood the spirit of the Lord
[1:10:11] is able to raise up a standard of the
[1:10:14] word against him
[1:10:17] this is the day of Revelation
[1:10:20] do you believe that I said this is the
[1:10:23] day of Revelation
[1:10:24] not just natural education not
[1:10:27] memorization not just teaching you
[1:10:30] tactics of how to memorize Bible verses
[1:10:33] and pieces and stuff like that and that
[1:10:36] word written word is going to be your
[1:10:38] sword or walking with a cross on a pole
[1:10:42] before you is going to scare the devil
[1:10:44] away no we're past all that now Christ

[1:13:57] the Bible but they're missing something
[1:13:59] that's in there

[1:14:05] a revelatory spirit of Jesus Christ can
[1:14:07] recognize it amen oh you can't hide it

[1:14:34] of any person personalities or
[1:14:38] individuals while I'm talking like this
[1:14:40] because the devil will want to come to
[1:14:44] your mind and say oh maybe he's talking
[1:14:47] this way thinking this way that way no

[1:15:08] sort of thing but to point you to the
[1:15:10] word amen and all we are trying to do is
[1:15:14] to point out and identify the works of
[1:15:17] the Antichrist so you are not caught off
[1:15:19] guard
[1:15:21] amen praise God hallelujah amen amen
[1:15:25] praise God and the Antichrist is in the
[1:15:29] message
[1:15:31] right Among Us
[1:15:33] amen and just like the spirit of Jesus
[1:15:38] right amongst the other Apostles right
[1:15:41] amongst the other believers and he was
[1:15:44] so close that he was trusted
[1:15:48] he was genuinely sincerely trusted
[1:15:52] amen and walked amongst them Hallelujah
[1:15:56] Oh my Jesus himself said that Judas
[1:16:00] Ministry was not inferior to the other
[1:16:02] ones
[1:16:03] he said have I not chosen you all of you
[1:16:08] in other words all of you even Judas who
[1:16:10] was chosen one was chosen to receive the
[1:16:13] word and one was chosen to deceive
[1:16:16] because he was born the Bible says he
[1:16:19] was born that way to be have that spirit
[1:16:22] in him praise God and uh they say oh but
[1:16:27] I got the Holy Ghost well Judas had the
[1:16:29] Holy Ghost Ministry
[1:16:31] he was casting out devil because he's in
[1:16:33] the sick he was going around with Jesus
[1:16:35] doing everything and it outwardly
[1:16:37] appeared uh genuine wonderful but it's
[1:16:41] not just having a holy ghost Ministry
[1:16:43] amen it's making sure God showed you
[1:16:48] Mercy by blessing his germ this Gene his
[1:16:53] seed in you that you are not one in a
[1:16:56] million
[1:16:58] could have been anybody else hallelujah
[1:17:00] amen praise God and me or in one of us
[1:17:04] we have the germ the gene representation
[1:17:08] to Salvation
[1:17:10] and one have another seed contrary seed
[1:17:15] in them representation to condemnation
[1:17:18] but thanks be to God I am here to
[1:17:21] represent Jesus Christ you are here to
[1:17:24] represent Jesus Christ you are here to
[1:17:27] manifest Jesus Christ for the glory of
[1:17:30] God hallelujah amen yes sir o praise God
[1:17:35] hallelujah you the spirit had to come to
[1:17:38] a stop
[1:17:40] I thank God what did the prophet of God
[1:17:44] say said here wisdom versus Faith he
[1:17:47] says you see do you know he said Satan
[1:17:50] knew just as much of the world as Jesus
[1:17:52] knew
[1:17:54] he's talking with a written word there
[1:17:56] you know
[1:17:57] so that that's not in the book but you
[1:18:00] understand he's really talking about the
[1:18:01] written word because Satan can't really
[1:18:04] know the word as much as Jesus because
[1:18:07] he said one knew the word but the other
[1:18:10] one himself was the word
[1:18:13] and that's the great difference one
[1:18:16] Speaking from from his knowledge of the
[1:18:19] word and the other one is living the
[1:18:21] word he's the Living Word so it's a
[1:18:24] great difference there praise God and
[1:18:27] the rain has fallen under just a new
[1:18:30] unjust in our day the ministry of the
[1:18:34] Prophet came and it shined down and
[1:18:37] rained down on this day on every person
[1:18:41] that was there amen praise God and
[1:18:44] whatever Revelation you've got it's got
[1:18:47] to be revealed to you by God himself you
[1:18:50] remember Jesus came and he said to them
[1:18:52] who do you think is I the son of man am
[1:18:57] in other words even though I'm standing
[1:18:59] here before you looking like a man who
[1:19:01] do you really think I am
[1:19:03] that's the question you really was
[1:19:05] asking you know because he was always
[1:19:07] doing his signs and wonders to give them
[1:19:09] some you know wake up their spiritual
[1:19:12] Amnesia to to start to remember when
[1:19:15] they were with him before the
[1:19:17] foundations he did a Wonder here A Sign
[1:19:19] there something here just to wake up
[1:19:22] that spiritual Amnesia to begin to start
[1:19:25] to recognize who he was and something
[1:19:28] like broke through on on Peter oh
[1:19:33] don't want the Christ the son of the
[1:19:35] Living God I see it now oh please God
[1:19:38] hallelujah listen where it came from yes
[1:19:42] Peter flesh and blood has not revealed
[1:19:45] this on you
[1:19:47] where it come from but my Father in
[1:19:49] heaven
[1:19:51] has revealed this it's the same thing
[1:19:54] happening now PM picked it up by
[1:19:56] education we don't pick it up even by by
[1:19:59] religious teaching you got it my
[1:20:02] heavenly father has revealed this unto
[1:20:06] you
[1:20:06] everything oh praise God forevermore
[1:20:10] hallelujah oh thank God I'm so glad that
[1:20:14] this is what God has done amen because
[1:20:18] it makes you recognize what the word you
[1:20:21] recognize also the anointed word for
[1:20:24] your day and for your hour praise God
[1:20:27] you know the difference from the holy
[1:20:29] spirit amen praise God and there that
[1:20:34] also identifies your election
[1:20:37] because he came to you
[1:20:39] amen what you're singing about that he
[1:20:42] came to you and why did he come to you
[1:20:45] he said that come for the lordship amen
[1:20:48] that's what he came from came for prays
[1:20:51] that he loves everybody he loves the
[1:20:53] whole world but he came to the lost
[1:20:55] sheep
[1:20:56] came to bring them back to where they
[1:20:59] came from praise the Lord hallelujah I'm
[1:21:02] so thankful to God for his marvelous and
[1:21:05] Wonderful Grace hallelujah oh praise God
[1:21:09] I'm glad our father has come to us to
[1:21:12] reveal to us himself the spoken word to
[1:21:16] us that we might know him praise God do
[1:21:19] you know he all the stuff was set
[1:21:21] plainly out in the openness now making
[1:21:23] clear
[1:21:24] that his church
[1:21:27] he builds his church on Revelation and
[1:21:30] by Revelation everything about this
[1:21:33] church Brick by Brick and it's by
[1:21:36] Revelation every time he put Revelation
[1:21:38] between to cement the things together
[1:21:41] and the whole Foundation was was
[1:21:44] Revelation everything he built his
[1:21:47] church on Revelation by Revelation to
[1:21:50] the glory and praise of the Living God
[1:21:53] hallelujah amen yes sir praise the Lord
[1:21:57] here oh praise God let me just jump over
[1:22:00] some things here that he praise the Lord
[1:22:04] that we might move on and get through
[1:22:07] this praise the Lord hallelujah now we
[1:22:11] know
[1:22:13] according to I'm quoting brother Branham
[1:22:15] here now he's saying here now about two
[1:22:19] two thousand years ago
[1:22:22] this Deception come to a head
[1:22:26] and uh it came to a head and it was
[1:22:30] headed up in two men
[1:22:33] one of them named Jesus Christ and the
[1:22:37] other one named Judas Iscariot
[1:22:41] Hallelujah now Jesus Associated the the
[1:22:46] second coming
[1:22:48] that these two Spirits again now would
[1:22:53] be just a lot different than they were
[1:22:56] back there when he was now here it is
[1:23:00] where I want you to put on your glory
[1:23:03] Gardens
[1:23:05] these two Spirits are going to be
[1:23:07] different because Satan come and lived
[1:23:10] in a man that was just a carnal church
[1:23:14] member
[1:23:16] he lived in a carnal church member Judas
[1:23:20] Iscariot
[1:23:22] in the carnal church and he was a friend
[1:23:26] to the church all the time he was not
[1:23:29] some enemy fighting the church he was a
[1:23:31] friend to the church all the time but he
[1:23:35] come in and deceived or thought that he
[1:23:39] was deceiving his brother amen he came
[1:23:44] in tested the good things of God he
[1:23:47] heard all the preaching they got the
[1:23:50] same word from from the of the pulpit
[1:23:53] chastened of the good things of God and
[1:23:56] move right along in the spirit seeming
[1:23:59] to be went out and even went out and
[1:24:02] preached the gospel and him cast out
[1:24:04] Devils but down in him all the time
[1:24:08] he was Judas to begin with what he had a
[1:24:13] germ from Satan in him and one had a
[1:24:18] gene from God in Him Praise the Lord
[1:24:21] hallelujah amen do you know I think it's
[1:24:25] in perfect let me see a perfect faith
[1:24:29] brother Branham said do you know
[1:24:32] that
[1:24:34] they were afraid of the very message
[1:24:38] that they got a hold of
[1:24:40] and I know that thought of course coming
[1:24:42] from when they cross the sea and and and
[1:24:45] then they cry out and asked the Lord to
[1:24:48] come and help them in the storm and when
[1:24:51] he did come they said oh he's a ghost
[1:24:54] they were afraid of their very answers
[1:24:57] to their prayers and that happens in our
[1:25:00] day too that happens to us praise the
[1:25:03] Lord amen amen praise God yes sir and so
[1:25:07] when Revelation comes uh you would be
[1:25:10] shocked you are rejoicing over it and
[1:25:13] there's a lot of people afraid of it
[1:25:15] they're scared of it they don't want
[1:25:17] nothing to do with it because it would
[1:25:20] tear down all their long-held beliefs
[1:25:23] amen praise God hallelujah praise the
[1:25:27] Lord Jesus
[1:25:29] amen
[1:25:31] praise God hallelujah
[1:25:34] amen amen just give me a minute here
[1:25:37] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah I
[1:25:40] just want to get to
[1:25:44] a germ of things here
[1:25:48] now we know
[1:25:50] that the Holy Spirit has been leading us
[1:25:53] into the depths of the word just little
[1:25:57] by little
[1:26:00] and uh presenting by presenting the word
[1:26:03] to us
[1:26:05] in uh a new light
[1:26:08] but just like the prophet said the Bible
[1:26:10] become a new Bible it doesn't mean the
[1:26:14] Bible changed but he's seeing the Bible
[1:26:17] from a new light when he reads the
[1:26:20] verses and reads the things in it it
[1:26:23] comes with a new light on it praise the
[1:26:27] Lord and makes itself known to us that
[1:26:30] we might know him whom to know his life
[1:26:34] eternal praise the Lord amen and we know
[1:26:37] that any elected son or daughter God
[1:26:40] will see the word like that and will
[1:26:43] always be lined up 100
[1:26:45] with the word of God now watch this
[1:26:52] we are now in this time
[1:26:55] we are coming to the making of the
[1:26:58] hundred millionth
[1:27:00] over here
[1:27:02] we are come right down to the sharp edge
[1:27:07] of the Gospel The Razor's Edge amen
[1:27:12] then a two-edged sword
[1:27:15] cutting even to the asunder of the bone
[1:27:19] and discerner Hallelujah he says God let
[1:27:23] it go through to them go through
[1:27:26] hallelujah it's a discerner of the
[1:27:29] thoughts of the mind that's the gospel
[1:27:31] the power of God the word of God made it
[1:27:35] made manifest is the gospel Hallelujah
[1:27:39] have you if the I want you to know if
[1:27:42] you caught what he really said there
[1:27:45] praise God and what we are doing now by
[1:27:49] the spirit to detect these men are in
[1:27:52] spirits in there see because it's the
[1:27:55] word now Discerning those spirits
[1:27:59] is the word doing that
[1:28:02] Hallelujah I I just got some things
[1:28:05] written here and there's so spidery that
[1:28:08] I've got to look carefully before I can
[1:28:10] tell you what I've got written here
[1:28:12] beside uh brother Brown may have a
[1:28:15] quotation and then what I see I might
[1:28:19] make the notes beside it and say what
[1:28:22] it's like amen praise God and imagine
[1:28:26] that the word discerns the spirit and
[1:28:29] then when you see them spirits come up
[1:28:32] and then they reject the unwritten word
[1:28:38] you quickly recognize or what kind of
[1:28:41] spirit is back there no matter how nice
[1:28:43] it looks on the outside you're looking
[1:28:45] at the word it denies the revealed word
[1:28:49] and it identifies that spirit that is
[1:28:53] back there because the word in you is
[1:28:57] Discerning that Spirit five minutes he
[1:28:59] said two minutes he said you'll know
[1:29:01] what spirit is in that person that's
[1:29:04] back there amen why because it's the
[1:29:07] word that is in you hallelujah amen
[1:29:10] praise the Lord hallelujah now we know
[1:29:14] the holy spirit being in the head that
[1:29:19] life from the headship has come down
[1:29:22] into the body
[1:29:23] amen and I believe this is the time when
[1:29:27] the Holy Spirit is working through this
[1:29:29] body and not that body to fulfill
[1:29:32] Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ is the same
[1:29:36] yesterday and today and they don't
[1:29:39] recognize it because it's not coming
[1:29:41] like Jesus with the long hair and the
[1:29:44] you know the groups From Galilee and
[1:29:47] that sort of stuff because just like he
[1:29:49] changed his form in the Melchizedek uh
[1:29:52] you know uh and Martha he's done the
[1:29:55] same thing now
[1:29:57] but it's coming as we said before and
[1:30:00] over and over again in the form of a
[1:30:03] bride
[1:30:04] because this is not the head Eve was
[1:30:07] taken out from Adam and she looked as if
[1:30:11] she was separate from Adam but it
[1:30:13] actually she was a part of Adam amen and
[1:30:19] she was a manifestation of him being
[1:30:23] revealed and now this many membered
[1:30:27] Bride is a manifestation of him being
[1:30:31] revealed hallelujah or praise God so the
[1:30:35] head is now revealing or manifesting
[1:30:38] himself through his right body
[1:30:43] glory be to God hallelujah amen praise
[1:30:47] the Lord and so I can confidently say I
[1:30:51] I'm not up here to discern diseases
[1:30:55] I'm not up here to try to discern all
[1:31:00] kinds of spirits and people though the
[1:31:02] holy spirit will do that whether I like
[1:31:04] it or not or you like it or not but we
[1:31:07] are not that is not the emphasis when
[1:31:10] brother Brennan was here God had to do
[1:31:12] that during those ages to capture the
[1:31:15] attention of the Bride because he was
[1:31:18] scattered everywhere
[1:31:21] and he had to do that to get grab their
[1:31:24] attention in that kind of a of a way
[1:31:27] Hallelujah so we are not here to discern
[1:31:30] X
[1:31:32] and pains
[1:31:34] and tell you and it's amazing how many
[1:31:38] of you have seen the prophet uh under
[1:31:41] the spirit of a discernment how many of
[1:31:44] you have seen that and heard the voice
[1:31:46] of God speaking through him and calling
[1:31:49] the people amen because it wasn't him
[1:31:52] people didn't understand it wasn't him
[1:31:54] it was the same Jesus that was there
[1:31:56] thousands of years ago come back and
[1:31:59] using a man's Temple and speaking out of
[1:32:02] him and that is why one time the voice
[1:32:05] said this is not William Branham
[1:32:08] speaking William Branham has only loaned
[1:32:12] me his body
[1:32:13] amen it was God I am the Lord come down
[1:32:17] amen that same God has come down not to
[1:32:22] William Brown but to a great body and
[1:32:25] using her praise God not to discern
[1:32:28] disease but now it's come down for you
[1:32:32] to discern the Antichrist spirit
[1:32:36] amen in the Lord's body
