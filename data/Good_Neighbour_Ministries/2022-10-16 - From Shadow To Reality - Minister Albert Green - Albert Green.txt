the Elder in Trinidad and Minister the gospel with a worldwide Ministry amen and God is using and that's the truth God using him uses him wherever he goes taking the gospel with faith and confidence I've known him for many years as you know I've been the Trinidad ministered in his church there and in the other churches by the grace of God so I'm thankful that our acquaintance is not Johnny come lately but it's something that's endured through the many years I'm not saying I'm ancient of this but at the same time it has endured through the age uh up and down trials on every hand but God has led us this far praise the Lord Amen brother amen I just got to see you here is a saint now that's been walking with the Lord for quite a long time and we give God all the glory praise the Lord and we'll recognize everyone in here but God bless you Sister but we are happy that we can be gathered in His Marvelous and wonderful name praise God sister June of course brother uh Glenn brother green will introduce her his beloved wife is second half uh is you know he's that completes him it's the hardest wife so if he comes here without her we only have half the man so but I'm glad we have the whole man right and that God can use him in a wonderful way now we come in here now today each one of us is an individual Consciousness in the eyes of God and in the mind of God we all have our individual experiences and conditions that we have passed through that we are going through and we have all have an individual walk and that is why we don't compare ourselves with each other and we don't uh look at all these little things that we used to look at because we were still babes in Christ or immature in Christ and not grown up in him but at this time we know it's an individual walk and everyone has the answer for themselves not my brother not my sister but it's me oh Lord I'm standing in the need of prayer and I pray that every one of you will pray one for the other and even while the minister comes pray for him even while he's preaching in your thoughts in your heart just say a little prayer bless him Lord use him Lord I have this need just speak through him and speak to me whatever it is I don't care what it is nothing is impossible with God is that right so God bless you as we now let this wonderful servant of God come to this platform we don't have a show we don't have an internet presentation here we don't have anything to display a human uh proficiency or anything of that nature but we are here to present the invisible person of Jesus Christ who we believe is here with us I believe he's on the scene I believe is the same yesterday today and forever and I believe it's about time the holy spirit will come use our brother and bring to us not the word only that we hear but the Living Word that can affect our lives and change our lives and make us presentable in the presence of God to you brother green God bless you my beloved brother uh it's nothing more the same but to let the Lord have his way using you my brother it go right ahead thank you blessings you may be seated for a moment to give me a chance you know brother assignment fall in the line of many of us who like to say good things about people nothing is wrong with that so I appreciate all his greetings and I was I happened to have been here twice once when the building was not completed and I happen to have been here for a beautifully dedication of this building by the role if something has happened changes has happened because I'm seeing it as a new building and new something new around so I appreciate the beauty of your structure beauty of your building and I know there's some thing more beautiful here is you the character of God's people amen so being with you really carry great memories uh matter of fact this church has been the first church I have ministered to in Canada I used to be coming to barahara's meeting and Toronto was just a stop across because my nephew is here and and I had the privilege of ministering with you all many I think it was 1997 for the first time so I do carry fond memories and I was telling brother John and some of the scenes here uh it was in 1995 when I was very green I was at the greenness of green boat in Utah now and in the ministry brother John Simon was happened to be one of our first visitors with us he came particularly after the death of barabooja and he wanted to come and had some fellowship with us I know better John you're not aware but just daughters here you're not aware so I work at my congregation [Applause] imagination right they say when you go to Trinidad the church you go to he's your pastor okay so there are some people when they're in Trinidad they visit us so I happen to be their Pastor so our relationship has been great uh continued brother and brother Tim and ourselves we have been to the islands and meetings and over the years they all carry foreign memories in as much as I carry fun memories of being here they carry fond memories of us being together Glory maybe you all stand second Corinthians chapter 5 we want to read alternately versus one to nine maybe about our hearts Heavenly Father we thank you for the songs we thank you for the worship thank you for the prayers of the Saints and even has pastors requested of your people Lord God as they listen to the word that Lord God that they pray for the speaker the Lord God good speaker and hearer is in need of you this morning I need to speak Lord your word and the hearer need to hear your word and this all comes from you so we are totally dependent upon you and we are trusted in you bless every brother bless every sister bless the ministry here Lord and what you have allowed them to achieve and their good continue to bless pastors the officers of the church all the rules that they play and they will continue to play for the furtherness of your work in Jesus precious name amen and amen yes I bought a John want me to introduce my wife I am an extra foot my wife is an introvert everybody know me so maybe the quietest lady around I don't know where she is good because this good lady has been my wife for the last 49 plus years a new sisters are full with gender biases and female and one of my nieces asks in her how she could bear with me the older please they don't wonder how much weedness be with them how you could bear with Uncle and tolerate him for all those years but she had been my wife and God bless her and she has been a blessing to me okay wonderful let's go for what we're here for now read alternately for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle will dissolve we have a building of God a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens foreign naked no he that had wrought us for the same same thing as God who also had given unto us the earnest of the spirit foreign [Music] God bless his precious words to our hearts you be seated by God's grace the Lord help us this morning I would like to seek take an inspiration this morning from the message Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ quote number one wonderful God's Prophet said so we are really Shadows of light we are shadows of light now you are reflecting a life from somewhere are we going if you are a Christian and this being a shadow is only proved there is a life where you can't die because this life has debt in it but it is a shadow because you are living moving creature with abilities succeeding move and talk and five senses of the body but yet to know that they are dying and there's so much trouble you know it it can't it can't be it's a reflection see there's life and death mixed together so God's Prophet is identifying to us that we are shadows of light amen that this this means this life is a shadow I trust the Lord will help us this morning I want to take a look at moving from Shadow to reality amen this life being a shadow what is a shadow a shadow is described as a semblance a shadow is described as the dark portion of a picture God's Prophet call and Shadow a forecast of an object what do you mean to say you are not you you are not you do you you watch the mirror do you you look after in the mirror and Etc and Etc that is not you you are a shadow but we are a movement from Shadow to reality so let's go on as we you get the picture so your shadow gives a conception of what you look like that and you you look like that that is why when you leave here you only carry your looks did you hear when you leave this earth there's nothing of this Earth You Carry all they end up with is your image because this is what you look like amen so the shadow trees content 18 19 10 or 20. how much God has allowed you to have this Shadow is not the real thing amen this Shadow is not the real thing amen the shadow is a negative side of the object our modern children don't know about negatives and you live in a new age and you have a whole new age right but we who are to deal with Shadow negatives we gotta look because the negative is not depicted so we're looking at the negative and we it happens dizzy because a negative young people you don't know what we're talking about right it comes like I was preaching on the five wives and five foolish virgins and I had to find a lamp because this light can help you I had to find a week you know because all you don't know we're talking about well you get a big black well we didn't get light soon and the Bible when the Bible talk about having a lamp it was not kind of lamp so we're going so bear with us in case you're getting prettier your grandmother might tell you what what a negative happened to me what the camera used to do and what we used to have as a negative are we going okay so the shadow is the negative side of the object get the picture we're talking about me and you okay so what we are in now is the negative side of the object amen it's a pattern amen it is not the real thing when we get that grabs that we could get to understand what the psalmist David meant when he said amen thy loving kindness is better than life he said he's speaking of the lord lord your loving kindness is better than life what it is better than life it means to tell us this morning there are two types of life what people call life this morning is really debt because this life is so great when you get further people take a gun and blow off your head so what is life what people call life is a life of birds X different kind of emotion lives is what the scripture referred to as a way that seemed right amen because this life is a life of perversion so then there are two kinds of life there is God's life and human life that is why we could grasp now when God's Prophet said under your own understanding there are some people who own dramatized seed of human life they only have human life but if I thank God this morning we have human life and God's life blessed be the name of the Lord amen because there is nothing greater than to have this morning the life of almighty God you know God's Prophet will tell us no matter what you accomplish no matter what we get in this life no matter what no matter how great we are and what we do in education and what we do in wealth and what we're doing nothing could come near to what God has done to you that is all that is real life nothing could come not nothing could come near nothing could come even near to what God has done for us glory to God so this life is Prophet is showing us is a shadow amen this life is a perverted thing that is why we want to get 16 again all of us want to be 17 Again all of us ought to be 18 Again belong to be 20. you know the picture you have a 20 put it up put it up keep it frame it because you'll never see that again Your Shadow start to burn out you're like a candle you know after 20 you're burning down and makeup can't help cosmetic surgery cannot help Europe I used to boost myself as being one of the most best workers in the world one day one day a Young Man passed I said wait I get involved so you're going down you're not going up you're going down right it is a shadow it is not the real thing so I appreciate sweet 17 or sweet 18 or 320 yeah don't don't think you're gonna stay so yes you could be so again [Applause] this is not the game but in this one no you can't make it amen because love one another how much we want to love one another when I reach a certain age or we reach a certain age or some people join us somebody had to help us across the road you know what a nice woman but let me help you so let's go so that is why with this life three squantene will long to get back young again we always reflect when I was when I was what I used to do yeah Iran now we are the Guardians and all kind of thing what do you used to do the life always a life of provision amen so in this life we have ends and we have outs we have UPS we have dogs amen God's profited the message Shalom quote number two are we getting it this morning [Music] what a wonderful thing that is especially when an old man like me stand here and the old man who was saying this was 54. not 74 like me good old man the old man was 54. and the woman is saying what a wonderful thing that is especially when an old man like me stand here and think of the life that is fading away that is gone in the past and we are facing an eternity a future of an eternity and knowing if this life alone is what I had hopes in I'll be the most miserable person but knowing that this light can only be a shadow of what we had to come it's a reflection amen it cannot be the perfect thing God will make nothing God will make nothing perfect it is not the perfect thing that God made God don't make anything that perishes God is eternal and therefore this life that we now live is only reflecting what is ahead of us I want to remind ourselves this morning we are not going to heaven we are not only going to heaven we are reflecting heaven [Applause] right now why you think you heard it will tell you about Heavenly places it is not tomorrow when you get a concept of heavenly places do not beg you to come to church because you get to realize this is the best place you could be in in Canada this is the best place you could be in Toronto you're a place where God is in control it is a place where God's word is being spoke this is a place to fall under evenly atmosphere if the influence of this place is a blessing that is why God prophesied when you don't feel you come come you don't feel Japan still come because there's a blessing to come here there is a blessing to come into the house of the Lord I never tell you the churches have men I tell you the place where the word is in command the world rules here as a matter of fact amen then God Prophet said you see this fulfilled here is the nearest place to have this because what comes out from here is the word of God and that is what you need to hear that is what to get you out of this shadow Hallelujah Get You Out of The Shadow you could move from Shadow to reality right now right now somebody in here could move from natural life to spiritual life right now somebody by receiving the word can get over themselves Hallelujah he said his word and his word delivered him right now you could be delivered right now you can get a victory right now you can have salvation right now [Applause] that is correctly open to us you realize how important it is to find yourself in the house of the Lord bless the Lord Glory Glory we are reading from the message called shalom shalom Shalom is not a topic like brother green want to preach on a topic you know Shalom is that event something has taken place that give you shalom you can have peace you could have as God's Prophet said exactly what God intended in the Garden of Eden you could enjoy it now in this perverted body the body is in Satan Eden but the gene the real you is in glory so right now you have peace with God right now he walks with me and talks with me it's not a song it's a reality what what Adam was supposed to enjoy you could enjoy now having a relationship not with the church but with the pastor this is not an individual matter you are having a relationship with almighty God [Applause] I want to tell your sins back home he'll be getting the right kind of relationship yeah everybody didn't imagine up with the word nobody didn't want to fight no no but nobody everybody has a goal in their life they were enjoying their salon all right let's go on by the grace of the Lord Glory Hallelujah so therefore this life that we now live is only reflecting what is ahead of us the original one amen this life there's a song of precious Brothers singing things that would be the real me not just me there's a real me that real me is what the message called The Creator is he that is in you that is the real me this is not me that is why we are taught in the word amen your greatest enemies you you're working at with pongs are enemy these bombs are your enemy not your friend do you think that I waste most of my time to think about who don't like me is me don't like me this thing has hindered me this body understand me to hate you the world never tells me that did she never tell me that the real me never tell me that but this is a gossip against that fella this body understand me here filth sea field don't go to church tonight go and sleep go and watch some some something to watch this body is different you know that's why when the world said kill yourself not suicide I go and say where do you see we at a higher level here Apostle Paul call it I Die daily for daily you have to crucify daily after ill myself because I recognize I am walking with my enemy not my friend that is why the word in me brings this fella under control he has to be on the subjection amen amen he's the king and I am a subject [Applause] somehow you're gonna feel if you're pulling on me if you leave me so I won't finish so let me finish right we thank God for his house thank God you know in crooked language we say that um it was a good pitch those who know cricket so let's go by the grace of the Lord hurry this right let's go so God is eternal therefore this life we now live is only reflecting in the life that is ahead of us the real one that cannot die the body that cannot prayers the life that cannot be taken and therefore the scripture is right where they say that we have everlasting we have eternal life we shall never die see because you become when you are born again you become a part of God you are forever for eternity never to fall amen you are bad cause you are his son amen so it is a wonderful thing amen our hope is not in this life our hope is in the life that is to come amen so God's Prophet is identifying to us to examine this life that God doesn't make anything that perishes amen so this life this morning is a shadow and the greatest thing we have is life we don't have nothing Christian and rifle other than God's life but naturally God's Prophet is identified to us to examine ourselves that this life that we think so much of we we worship ourselves we praise ourselves we do all kind of thing with it it is a shadow we want to think about the real thing no church not only this life is a shadow everything around us is a shadow is a shadow a type of the things Supernatural the things Eternal the things on the other side when you see a tree a tree is a shadow he ain't real you know he's not a real tree the real tree is a tree of life amen the tree is a shadow it represents another tree we are having some fellowship with the brothers yesterday husband and wife marriage is a shadow that is not the real marriage the Real Marriage am I going are we all right invisible Union the invisible Union of the bride of Christ is the real marriage this one is only a shadow may I remind you if he does that shape up with his shadow we can't get any real water [Applause] [Music] are you in church are you in church it no sense this morning I claim to be bride of Christ you know in the real thing now and I can't handle my physical marriage back home I say it's time to drink my water because everybody gets silent all right but take note of it please it is very important that we take note because this marriage our marriages is a shadow of the real marriage amen and we want the real marriage get it correct I think assistant When You See Your Shadow it reflects you let me say it plain and nice and crude good good my relationship with my wife and my wife relationship with me is indicative indicative of my relationship with God get more quietness nobody why are you strangling me for but think about it I am preaching on that right let's go that's a hard one so everything I wrong is that shadow the Natural Body is a type of the spiritual body amen hallelujah is a a type a shadow of the things to come what Isaiah tells us in Isaiah 55 amen and verse 2 it tells us wherefore do you spend money for that which is not bread and your labor for that with satisfied not hack intelligently unto me and eat he that which is that which is good and let your soul Delight itself in fatness amen so why are you gonna spend money for that which is not bread amen what it means to you know a lot of us I think there should be a song in the world something like that people running after Shadows you're spending everything after Shadows you're spending money you're spending time after Shadows so don't spend it after Shadows seek the reality amen okay so when we look at the Shadows amen there is a real expression somewhere right to find a shadow there had to be an image you can't get a shadow without an image so the shadow is said there is an image that is coming amen is a reflection of what is ahead amen so this life God's Prophet identified to us is a shadow and if this life is a shadow there is a real life somewhere [Applause] this life is a reflection of what is ahead of us it reflecting the life that cannot perish a reflecting the body that cannot die amen is a shadow of the things to come so beyond the shadow there is a body made without hands Beyond The Shadow there is an immortal body amen so on this Earth we are here and as Believers amen we thank God that God has opened that to our eyes because the world lives how they want to live but we have a different image we know we know we have a different purpose we know God has a purpose for us here we are in a negative form amen this is just the shadow glory to God we live in an age that all of us here have a cell phone and all of us here know the significance of a charge you could be going on the road and you forget your food or you forget your charge but you're like official order of water you have to run down I have to be charged I had to answer my phone I had to make calls I need to be always charged I thank God what God's Prophet said your own glorified body is standing near you right now in Jesus Christ to give this shadow to what to give this Shadow a child your own glorified body is near you right now the holy spirit in you it gives you a charge there are time you get any dumps there's a time you're done there's a time thing not what they ought to be but over you're gonna plug in plug in and you end up like the African slave you could walk straight glory to God Hallelujah so your Shadow this morning on the wall gives a picture of what you look like amen it tells what you look like amen this Shadow it tells us about the negative part of your journey not the positive part because his shadow don't look good the shadow don't look good you Shadow tell you all the wrong things you do you say I don't tell you about all your scars the devil like to remind you of all the things you lose in 1901. it comes to you it gets you depressed sometimes whether you received or you received whether God dealing with you or and dealing with you because is your Shadow you're focusing in but when you get into the deed and you get to realize you read somewhere in the world will tell you you did not do it that was not you that's not the real you [Applause] as a matter of fact during you was not supposed to come the way you came thank God for his word thank God for his word amen amen so this is the negative part of the journey and where there is a negative there is a positive quote number three the message masterpiece we realize that we are here in the negative form however we want to let it be revelated in our lives the only thing good we have in this part of the world is the word of God the only thing positive we have is the word when you get that picture you gotta understand what I try to develop in our hearts The Importance of Being feeding the soul don't feed the shadow you could be feeding the shadow a lot of time and he created a monster should I even tell you and we ought to remind ourselves the shadow is very religious you know we want to get the real thing the message Masterpiece let's get going we realize that we are here in a negative form and as long as there is a negative there has to be a positive there cannot be a negative without a positive see because is the positive that makes it negative so don't worry about this negative you have for you to be negative and hard of a positive there is a positive is the positive that makes the negative let's go on and see a picture Oh Glory like you had a negative pity of some object there has to be an object somewhere to strike the light that lens they wouldn't if that there wouldn't be a negative so when we see our life here is negative amen knowing that we are in the image of some life somewhere that we know that there's a positive somewhere that the light has struck and it's reflected something here in the earth identifying we are only here only that reflection the genuine object is somewhere so God's prophecy is identifying to us this life is the negative there to have a negative you have to have a positive amen this is not the genuine object that's why the Apostle Paul said even this life alone we are hope we have all men most miserable there is a genuine object we are talking about moving from Shadow to reality amen amen the genuine object is somewhere if that isn't I am the worst deceived man in the world I've spent my life in vain but I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that is it's it's there that's why we are here so there is a genuine object somewhere by the grace of the Lord so this life is only the shadow this life the whole life everything we show off about is not the real life it is all is the negative part of the pit here someday the picture will be developed hey hi you I don't know what to do any more than this but when I used to be out there the world more model now you know when they do extreme that's something they call a dark room yeah you know what I mean in to do developed tears that's what they call a dark room

thing amen this picture is the main thing then in the resurrection those gases and acids and things come right back in this place and develops the spirit now this picture was not taken when he was 16 or 18. okay it wasn't taken when he was 16. because when he was 16 you could have a fault in your body you could have a good effect maybe he wasn't hearing well you you remember Sarah she was sterile

okay you can't get a picture it's only God have access to that 16 18 and 20 but the one God talking about you can have it but you better get that vision get that vision that you were in the thoughts of God that God have you in mind God have you in his thoughts when you get that Vision nobody could stop you from serving God nobody could hinder you nobody no obstacles could interfere with you nothing could trouble you because you know you are part of God's plan you know amen that all that's going on in this world and in this life is only a shadow but the reality is the main thing is God's Gonna picture you yeah Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord amen when was it taken before there was a foundation of the world and it was put in God's Great file and the only thing it did was feature itself here for you to make a choice amen you come into the world you come the wrong way you know they all you could remember okay coming to the world Amen but God the negative part amen him for knowing it makes him he Forno you it makes him a redeemer okay then the picture is absolutely so this is the negative the negative part of life is where you live in now amen so grabs that this morning by the grace of the Lord what we are living in is the negative part of life and anything if there's a negative there got to be a positive before there can be a negative therefore if this is a negative there got to be a positive somewhere and this and the real thing it is a foreshadow of the real thing that is to come and the art you got it you got it so he said I don't care what they do with this you they could destroy they cannot destroy that profile that picture in God's Great gallery they could hate you they could burn you they could curse you they could destroy you but you got the kind of feel that profile they cannot interfere that profile let faitha rise this morning let Faith arise this morning show us the reality that is ahead of us amen you could burn it up feed it the Lions do it anywhere you want to it will come forth again as sure as two twos is for just as sure as God spoke it it will come amen and amen amen quote number four be why it had to be Shepherds oh blessed be the name of the Lord amen glory glory glory glory God's Prophet expounded on the same thought he said God is one and God is the only one that has eternal life and he is eternal and anything that our beginning has an end amen anything that has a beginning has an end and if you are just a member of a church it has a beginning but the word of God has no beginning amen glory and church it had a beginning okay if you're a member of a church that are beginning right and when you are born of the word you are born when you are born of God you are born of the word then you become a Son of God and your name was put on a lamb book of life before the foundation of the world and you the color of your hair the color of your eyes you yours you have the statutes that you are in God seeing you before the foundation of the world and this is the reassuring part he's seeing you a human being like you are and though there come a million years nothing can keep you from coming to that Perfect Image that God holding of you [Music] nothing nothing could stop that picture from coming to reality nothing could stop you from coming to that image that God had ordained of you from the beginning Hallelujah oh church is such a reality some glorious day this negative will be developed some glorious day the negative and the positive shall come together you know when you meet your childhood has no Shadow again you know negative and positive some glorious day is going to come together we are going to our body we shall never be sick a body that never be old a body that will never have a heartache the negative becomes the positive the shadow becomes reality The Immortal spirit will take hold where we shall never die Glory that is why this morning that is why we want to get back young again we want to get back home again all of us long for that privilege amen when you pass your youthful age you long for the day that I could come back like that the day what I all I have now is history I could never get a present tense of my past I passed the point of no return there's no return those days were just great days that you could think about you could reminisce about you could talk about it and talk about your experiences but they are not yours it is no history but there is community and that is what this scripture answers for we know if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolve we have a building yeah amen we have a building amen if this our Earthly as God's Prophet said is not only if it's when because it's going to be dissolved we have a building amen we have a house not made with hands we have a reality we shall live here to go to a youthful place we are going to a youthful place never to be old again Hallelujah the Apostle book continue he said in this be groan in this we groaned honestly Desiring to be clothed with our house which is from heaven so there's a groaning there is a broad end we are growing for deliverance in these bodies we groan we live in a world a deceit we can't handle it we live in a world of sin we grow it oh Lord how much longer Lord when it is we're going to leave this place we need stability of humiliation we want we have grown in I want to be included with immortality I want to be clothed with immortality Hallelujah we cannot be satisfied we are growing because we are living in Satan Eden we can't be satisfied we are not happy with Satan either we groan in his body Amen to be crowded we groan for reality I say we've grown to see him as he is Hallelujah we grow on our blessed body the Blessed body we have waiting for us our body that we have that cannot perish a body that we have that is above temptation Hallelujah we are destined to a place we are just died and never to get old we understand we groan in these Tabernacles amen what is this cause in it is that life pressing on the negative this is the negative there is a life in you there's a life in me and it's present I'm gonna come out I want to come out pressing on the negative by the grace of God groan amen hallelujah what it is that causes us to grow on church is that new life that life is in US so since this life is a negative this life is just a shadow of someday debt someday a body change will develop this bit here somebody that will take you that will take me Hallelujah to the theophany that we came from Hallelujah someday amen that is why Church debt is really a scarecrow to the believer that believers because that is what take us develop the picture David what will take us to the geophony that we come from Hallelujah so that is just a scarecrow just to scare amen but is all yes I do writing this psalmist give it to ye do I walk ye do I walk in the shadow of death you mean to say he's telling us that you see death that are lighter if you have total darkness you can't get Shadow model light in order to get Shadow amen so you're able to tell us amen death is just a shadow amen it is just a shadow so to those of us we have long past our youthful days one day we have a better life speak for myself I speak it for everybody I want to remind I am feeling sorry for me you know I want to remind those who who haven't reached who still have the youthful days is that is what you're going to that is what you're going to do you're going to it so don't you you'll realize it after 21 you you don't know it but the prophet already taught us it after that you reach your best to help you out after that we pull this morning of a promise amen we have a change of these worn out bodies beyond the shadow that we live in Beyond this Shadow there is a change there is coming a day amen the object will blend foreign there wouldn't be no Shadow again we will have the reality the Earth's coming today the negative will become the positive yeah man they've come here today negative and positive becomes one church and Christ becoming one we see it in in True Church ages where God's Prophet will show us is a justification what a little shadow sanctification was a deeper shadow glory to God the baptism of the Holy Ghost was yet a deeper Shadow but now we have the person of Jesus Christ [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we got reality Hallelujah Glory as they go through the ages to bring forth reality we must be able Even in our lives now to sense reality in our very lives we are here to experience the reality code number five Paula prisoner but if you are reflecting by your mortal life by your mortal life your trees content the light of Heaven then you are reflecting eternal life God then when you

reality this journey this word that we love and we serve God is taking us to the light that you are reflected but if you have the world you reflect that you got no more go the other way but the darkness so we are in a reflection we see that I saw as the Holy Spirit reflect light and life so does death reflect Darkness so everybody is in a reflection we thank God we are reflecting his light hallelujah amen we are reflecting the life for a place that you cannot die the Old Testament is a reflection of the Gospel the Moonlight is a reflection of the sunlight so the light that the moon has he's reflecting the light of the Sun in the absence of the Sun so the Moonlight is not a perfect light it is a reflection of the sunlight when the sun come up the Moon is not needed we are here with the Moon the bride is the Moon we are not reflecting ourselves we are reflecting the light of the Som we are reflecting his light Hallelujah he is mwn Moon he's not a real light the real light is the

yeah what you are somewhere else you ain't just come I said you ain't just come you are here what you are not where you're going to be you know what you are somewhere else your life that you live here is reflecting what your inheritance is when you live here oh brother so even in the shadow that we live in we have to give a reflection what are you reflecting what am I reflecting Hallelujah these lives reflect our inheritance when we live here hallelujah our lives not our emotions Our Lives Hallelujah God's Prophet will tell us he said he exalt us don't judge your life by how much power you have to perform miracles don't judge your life by that don't judge your life by power to perform Miracles amen don't judge your life but how much knowledge you have of the world it is true we live in a very knowledgeable age at the flick of a switch we could do anything we want to know but don't judge yourself by the power you have to perform miracles don't judge yourself by your knowledge of the word look back take an inventory what kind of fruit the life you know live is bearing Lord help us to judge ourselves help us to judge ourselves he said because God will reflect himself to those who will humble themselves to his word if I were to humble myself to his word God will reflect himself to me Lord help us hallelujah help us Oh Glory in as much as the choice of a wife reflects what is in a man amen what who a man marry it reflects what is in them even Choice reflects your ambition Choice reflects your character amen so we are called to be reflection of Jesus Christ we are called to reflect this morning the word made manifest do I see I see my life do I can reflecting Jesus Christ can I see his life reflected in US because God said he will reflect his Prophet told us he reflect himself in someone who will humble themselves to God's word so this morning in as much as we in a move from Shadow to reality it beholds us to examine ourselves and see this morning how do we how are we seen in God's mirror in God's mirror do I reflect the son of God in God's mirror do I reflect a daughter God we got to examine what we reflect the message identification code number seven God's Prophet said not with our message can we stand by the looking glass of God's word and see Christ reflect in our lives can we bear such and reproach of the message that we are standing for here someone can say something about it and yet you just open your mouth and say nothing about it he was an example because God was reflecting his character in him and then if we are Sons and Daughters of God God reflects his character in US then we become like him that's my heart's desire and I think is every believer's desire to become more like him Glory so this morning our outside reflects our inside our outside reflects our inside our lives this morning in this journey or from Shadow to reality Our Lives reflect what we stand for code number eight would not really read it all but it is a point where Abraham was making his son Joseph was reported where he hit someone and someone hit him you know like you know a little childhood fight hit for hit I hit you you hit me back and he called Joseph and said Joseph he says too much to tell a little child but you're going to put it before them put the word before them he said Joseph what you did reflect on your mother what you did reflect on your father what you did reflect on the church you say no I said more 80 year old boy is too much to give him but you got to put the word before him that we are in a reflection and what we do does not is not only it doesn't end with me what you do does that end with you it Bears a reflection not only on mother not only on father not only on church but it Bears a reflection on Jesus Christ it behooves us this morning to look at ourselves hallelujah our lives should be the reflection of the image of Christ we are not here to wear sandals we are not here to reflect his physical image but our souls reflect that Holy Spirit image Hallelujah you know it is said that parents have a tendency amen when a children asleep have a tendency to look at their children and then look at them and they will discuss it I can see videos of Mommy I can see features of daddy Hallelujah God want to see reflection of you himself that is what oh great heavenly father wants to see that reflection the reflection of himself it comes like the time of of adoption that the father God said yes the teacher could say the Holy Spirit could say that is your boy that is your son that is your daughter Hallelujah glory to God Amen so as we continue in life's journey and as we wait for the shadow to come to a reality we don't know when it's going to come for me we don't know when it's going to come for you but as we wait for these Shadows to come to reality Hallelujah we should see God being reflected in me God being reflected in you amen what you stand for being reflected in you because is that word is what's going to change you is that reflection going to come to reality is that life going to change your body is that life blessed be the name of the Lord Glory think about it we just sing a song trim your feeble lamps my brother amen some poor sailor temper scores somebody's Eternal destination could be resting upon you somebody could be looking at the way you live somebody could be looking at you

[Music] said let's give God a clock and I thank the Lord uh I just made a note where brother green said God saw you in his mind before the foundation of the world and that's the picture that God has of you the picture that he already had in his mind is what he's he is seeing of you so this outside man is producing a false picture to the people around the real you is on the inside of you as our brother has said and we thank God for that amen it's not what you see or hear about me he is not what the devil rumor but it's what God saw in his mind about every one of us that's the real thing amen and that's what we should trust God I'm so glad that we are in the last stages of the gene the seed of God that has been in us and when that comes to the last stage what does it do it pushes aside the fault that's on the outside of it as the brother said the inside man has to push away all the Flesh and self and push it away so it can emerge and manifest and make itself declare and that's what we're doing right now we're throwing off the old man and putting on the new man this is Jesus Christ so that the real Gene seed of God in us can be revealed Hallelujah then the Bible say in a different way yes mortal must put on immortality thank God Hallelujah it must put on immortality and I'm glad for that that we are not going to be as we are from glory to glory he's changing words

has done within your life praise the Lord you know I had an old aunt and her her a topic her song us you know never grow all never [Music] land [Music] [Music] I have heard all of them [Music] [Music]
