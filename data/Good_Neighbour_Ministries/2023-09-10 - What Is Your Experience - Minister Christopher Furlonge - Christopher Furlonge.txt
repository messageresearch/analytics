your experience be an obstacle for you to be moving on Amen Hallelujah don't let your experience be a blockage in your life Hallelujah don't let your hurts or or things that happen in your life block you from moving on with God Amen Hallelujah and as we read amen therefore being justified by Fai we could even stop right there right there right there amen therefore being justified by faith and we all know that faith is a revelation and Faith only comes from God Amen Hallelujah so you are Justified but why God what God reveals to you amen hallelujah and what do we have we have [Music] peace with God through the our Lord Jesus Christ and what is peace there is no hindrances no more sin no more obstacles we can have free fellowship with God am when you have peace with God my my I don't

tell you this word is so sweet just I want to go slow absorb it just take the substance the real thing let God reveals it reveal it to your heart this morning amen amen hallelujah wherein we stand and what we do Rejoice my in the hope of the glory of God and not only so so we have more things coming more benefits to this Hallelujah but we glory in Tribulation so it's that two side to the coin amen two sides to the is going huh you have joy on one side and now you have tribulation on the next side but you know when the tribulation come you're glory in it you're happy amen what did the the word said rejoice when you fall into fiery Temptations and tribulations amen Rejoice amen also knowing that tribulations what it work at patience and you're always crying I want some patience patience but you can't get the patience without the tribulation so some hard times go strike you people will come against you all kind of things going situations are happening around your life that's going to cause some disturbances amen and that is going to work out patient God knows what you have need of today for this journey you need you need to you need to be polished up a little bit in this side your temper needs to be you know tempered you're too hot headed amen hallelujah so God knows how to work out every single one of us hallelujah also knowing that tribulation WTH patience and patience what experience so you want a real true experience with God now there is stages of this Christian walk hallelujah amen thank you Lord Jesus and experience hope amen maybe I'll be seated and we're going to continue Hallelujah continue reading praise God see my little thought here for you today and ask yourself it's a question what is my EXP experience you know as we heard last weekend amen praise God you know all the the the the the the experiences that you have it's a learning experience for you how to live how to move on amen hallelujah praise God thank you Lord Jesus blessed be his ho holy Wonderful Name continue reading and hope maketh not asham because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us amen so the Holy Ghost is what a gift to you you don't have to work for it MH amen you can't buy it amen hallelujah it's a free gift unto you but there are step steps before you receive that gift amen hallelujah don't want to jump ahead too much just want it to be simple that every single one of you here could understand break it down simple amen I don't come with big re rations you know big understanding big things that would kind of make your mind a little bit you know confus or anything like is I want to present the Simplicity of the Gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen because all them things could come on after amen hallelujah so the simpleminded ones could understand it amen hallelujah for when we were yet without Strength In Due Time Christ died for the rich man for the good man for the righteous man the one who could pay his way into the kingdom he died for theod died for me he died for you every single one of of us my for scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet poor Advent Here for a Good Man some would even dear to die so we all know not one is righteous how can un righteous are dirty thing make something clean you see man you see under the Old Testament in the Old Testament the blood sacrifice was only given as a covering for sin amen it could just cover their sin but you need to have a n change and without the shedding of blood there is no remission for sin so God was just giv in type in the Old Testament of what he's going to do in the New Covenant in the new in the New Testament amen hallelujah praise God but God commended his love towards us that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us so God expressed his love for each and every one of us here this morning that he died for you he died for me you see when Adam was created you see Adam represented the whole human race all God's seed was in Adam all the G matized seed that God was going to be sending throughout the ages was in Adam amen and he was a representation of you and me so may be asking this morning right why did we have to die when Adam sinned you ever ask yourself that question and a lot of people might ask that you know he did the wrong why we had to pay for it but we he was representing Us in him so when Adam fell we all fell in him amen amen hallelujah praise God so Jesus now the Lord himself God himself had to come and pay that penalty for all those seed jamati seed that was in Adam he had to pay the price to reconcile us back to him because God cannot die hallelujah amen and when you see us go that way he had to do something it was all in his plan his Plan of Redemption amen because in God there were attributes of being a savior we hear these things over and over again but someone here this morning needs to hear that yes siren Hallelujah that Jesus pay the price for you that you could go free you can't do it amen you couldn't pay that price amen so God so loved the world which world he said Jesus died for the whole world yes he did but but he died for those that were lost am Amen to bring them back because as I said God cannot die amen and he said I have every single one of them and I have to redeem them I have to bring them back I have to buy them back I have to take them out from the prison house Satan's prison house so the penalty for that blood caused sin so blood had to be shed to redeem back us to him amen hallelujah amen you see this is simple isn't it isn't it simple the Simplicity of God the gospel amen hallelujah praise God thank you Lord Jesus much more then being now justified by his blood now what is it meaning are Justified amen imagine this amen you did something wrong man and when you go up to the judge you going to say what is the accusation where's the evidence I don't see no evidence of this person doing wrong thing and that what Jesus do all the wrong that you did amen is been blotted out hallelujah amen it's not there in God's books it's not is him in his mind so Satan have no thing to bring up and accuse you of because it's all blotted out you're going to say what kind of Judges is come on he's an unjust judge you mean to say I bring up accusation at this person and the lawyer for this person don't have any evidence to show that the person did wrong glory amen so what is the accusation there's none Satan has nothing he could accuse he accuser of the Brethren but he has nothing no evidence to accuse you [Applause] of Amen my hallelujah praise God thank you Lord Jesus and here we read in in verse 12 in Romans wherefore as one man sin entered into the world and death by sin so death passed unto all men amen that's it Hallelujah so one man calls everything amen and why the whole world have to go through the whole thing so one man had to redeem all the Lost amen hallelujah praise God now we speaking this morning and what is your experience think about about it Hallelujah we have so much experience that life as we say life is a life this life is full of experiences amen you could experience hurt in your life you could experience joy in your life you could experience peace in your life amen but do you want to experience the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ the peace of God that passes all understanding do you want to have that that that that Assurance deep down in your heart amen that you are a son and a daughter of God Amen do you want to experience that and a lot of you here this morning have that experience but don't let that experience get cold don't let it die out keep feeding that experience amen and how do you feed that experience amen it's by the word of God Amen Hallelujah because Satan is a liar and he's the father of Lies amen and you'll always come and try to tell you that you're not what you are amen all the time he will tell you that you see that thing happened to you 20 years ago that's no more because you did all this here in your walk you you did this you made this mistake you made that mistake but if you have a true Born Again experience you get a tist you get grounded amen you know what you went through you know you had a personal life changing experience with God and Satan cannot take that away from you he cannot sir amen so every time he come around comes around and try to lie to you amen take him back for where you started he can do that for me Hallelujah say you could do that for me it's only the supernatural power of the Holy Ghost through by God's grace that did that for me you could stop your lying you could stop your drinking you could stop all these these things that were bugging you down amen hallelujah it's only God could have released you from Satan clutches amen only God could have done that and you know that because you tried in your own way because the desire for those things was still there when you tried it but when God's holy spirit comes into you to be be born again to have a n change hallelujah praise God hallelujah it's only when you have that nature change you have no more desire to do those things you still have the desires to do those things go check your experience go check back your experience amen hallelujah amen and may you get the right experience to get a born again lifechanging experience that will take away the desire for all the things of the world Hallelujah if you love I always say if you love the world w r n l d you take off the L which is the love of the world you get the [Applause] Worden hallelujah amen so feed on the word yes sir amen and the desires from the world will be gone that's the secret of being a Christian amen hallelujah feed on the word hallelujah you see in John 31-7 if you give me slide number four Hallelujah I just want to take my time amen hallelujah here we have a Pharisee Man by the name of Nicodemus he was a ruler of the Jews and he came to Jesus by night and a lot of us a lot of us amen had to come by Jesus by night this are night time that we living in a dark time we living in you don't want to come in the public you want to come in secret amen hallelujah you don't want to openly confess that Jesus is Lord but when he come let's read amen hallelujah praise God the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi so he recognized who Jesus was man we know that thou art a teacher come from God Amen for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him so he recognized the power of God amen amen being being displayed through some members being displayed through this preacher through this son or this daughter of God Amen because your life is a preacher and a teacher amen hallelujah you don't have to be standing here to be a preacher let your life be the teacher and the preacher let your life be a true representation or example to the people out there hallelujah amen you don't have to say one word to them by the way you carry about yourself by the way you speak amen hallelujah that atmosphere that you carry with you they know they know that God is with you and you cannot do this thing by yourself it's only the spirit of God the Holy Spirit could make you live like that because you could try how much you want amen if you're trying your own strength you're going to fail for sure hallelujah praise God and Jesus said unto him verily verily I say unto you except in man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of heaven so what so if you want to be born again amen first you got to seen God has to open up your eyes of your understanding and he is the only one that can open it up because he said when I open no man can show shut and when I shut no man can open you could testify how much you want you could pray how much you want for somebody you could preach and you do all that to somebody unless God opens up their eyes that's iten unless he opens it up you can do what you wanten Hallelujah only God can do that amen and when he opens it amen I tell you it's going to be an experience they're going to have and when you get that experience no man can take that away from me no one no one thank you Lord Jesus and that is what the Lord was telling Nicodemus amen hallelujah praise God you see Nicodemus said unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born Jesus answered verily I say unto thee except a man be born of the water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the Kingdom so there are stages to this Kingdom into this experience amen folks God has to open up your eyes amen and then you got to be born by the water and by the spirit amen hallelujah you need to repent go be baptized in the name of

through the crowd press your way through the opposition thank you and some sometimes it's the ones that even right around you go hinder you the ones that you think going to help you is the ones that would disappoint you just like the woman from Canaan she had a need wasn't for her own self was for a daughter who was sick with a devil am man she went to the disciples you know and you know the disciples were Jesus bodyguards right because as soon as the the soldiers came for Jesus Master Peter Mr Peter pull his sword take one he was going to take the man head off right but he just take his
