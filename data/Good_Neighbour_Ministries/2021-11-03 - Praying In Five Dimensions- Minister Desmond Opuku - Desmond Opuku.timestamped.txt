[20:28] you know it always happened to brother
[20:30] simon when you're about to bring
[20:32] something
[20:33] there's always something there but this
[20:36] is a rare blessing
[20:39] that i want i want to pray for so that
[20:42] everybody will be encouraged
[20:44] for what is going on
[20:47] these 40 days of papers
[20:59] if it doesn't work i'll use my phone
[21:03] so that i can okay you can hear
[21:13] my my phone
[21:15] is it my birthday
[21:33] because the rear bracing
[21:51] reveals
[21:58] was in captivity it was israel
[22:02] and they were down in egypt and was made
[22:06] hard and rigor to serve the egyptians
[22:10] it seemed like that everybody had
[22:13] just grown cold
[22:15] did you know israel was in egypt twice
[22:18] as long as the united states has been a
[22:20] nation
[22:23] we're not over about 150 or 70 years old
[22:26] something like that and they were
[22:28] 420 years in bondage or down in egypt
[22:33] but it come up
[22:35] when it seemed like that all hopes is
[22:37] gone but there was one man and woman who
[22:40] seemed to have faith in a historical god
[22:45] that spoke to abraham in the time of
[22:48] crisis and they believed they could call
[22:50] on him and he had answered
[22:51] [Music]
[22:58] [Music]
[23:01] the mother and father of moses
[23:05] and sure some time ago
[23:07] i was preaching and gave a little
[23:09] illustration
[23:12] of how that
[23:14] amram would come home at night
[23:17] and he'd say joseph i am so
[23:20] tired
[23:22] and the fresh lashes on his back from
[23:26] a taskmaster's whip
[23:29] and she would sit down patiently perhaps
[23:32] and wash out the
[23:34] the places and weep and say oh
[23:37] abram
[23:39] isn't there something that can be done
[23:43] [Music]
[23:45] i would hear him say oh
[23:47] dear if you'd have been with me today
[23:49] and seen them beat them young boys
[23:53] trying to pull those loads
[23:55] but they were heartless they treat them
[23:57] like they were animals
[23:59] and that's our young man of israel
[24:04] isn't there something can be done
[24:08] that's what i wonder now
[24:10] to see our young teenage boys
[24:13] that will be the men and women
[24:16] of tomorrow our teams today
[24:19] hair down in their neck and breeches
[24:22] pulled out over their hips of the pistol
[24:24] stuck in their side a cigarette in the
[24:27] side of their mouths what will it be
[24:30] it's
[24:31] slavery under the devil
[24:36] isn't there something that can be done
[24:40] [Applause]
[24:41] and amram perhaps one of the only ones
[24:45] of the nation would climb up for little
[24:47] stair steps
[24:49] regardless of how tardy was
[24:52] there each night he'd call on the god of
[24:55] abraham
[24:56] [Music]
[24:57] one that he had learned that come to
[25:00] abraham and come to job
[25:04] and come to eyes and can come to jacob
[25:08] and hours of distress and surely if he
[25:11] was god in their day he'd be gone in
[25:14] that day
[25:16] and if he was god in moses day he's god
[25:20] today
[25:22] [Music]
[25:24] he just needs to be called up out of
[25:26] history
[25:28] and called on the scene of action
[25:34] and i can see and night after night no
[25:38] matter how tired
[25:40] [Music]
[25:42] proved his faith in that god
[25:45] but today the people if they don't get
[25:48] everything they ask for
[25:51] the first time they pray they seem to
[25:54] think that he's dead
[25:55] [Music]
[25:57] what we need is men and women today of
[26:00] god's spirit
[26:01] [Music]
[26:03] men and women who are determined to hold
[26:05] on until they see a god that really
[26:08] lives come into action
[26:11] [Music]
[26:13] that will not take no for an answer
[26:18] they're determined to stay with it
[26:21] if they are
[26:23] and the doctors said they can't get well
[26:26] yet something within them tells them
[26:28] they're going to be well hold on no
[26:31] matter what takes place
[26:35] if you've joined the churches of the
[26:38] denominational world
[26:40] until you accept all your strength from
[26:43] walking from place to place
[26:45] and you still can't find relief there's
[26:48] still a god that answers prayer
[26:51] and saves from sin amen
[26:55] as we can see amram
[26:58] on those weary nights
[27:01] back bleeding
[27:02] climbing up the steps again until two
[27:05] and three o'clock in the morning
[27:08] praying and seemed like he's just
[27:10] talking to the wind
[27:13] down in his jewish heart there
[27:16] burned of faith
[27:19] that no winds of doubt could ever blow
[27:22] out
[27:22] [Applause]
[27:24] that's the kind of men and women we need
[27:26] to rise on the scene today
[27:30] if he doesn't answer tonight he will
[27:33] tomorrow night
[27:34] if he doesn't answer this year he will
[27:37] next year
[27:40] for he's a god
[27:43] not a god but the god
[27:48] and we see night after night as imran
[27:51] climbed the steps
[27:52] and jehoshaphat would come up to him and
[27:54] say
[27:56] amram dear
[27:57] you've been up here praying all night
[28:02] why don't you just tell some of the boys
[28:05] where you're working
[28:06] and let them pray a while
[28:09] well honey what if they don't do it
[28:12] somebody's got to do it somebody's got
[28:15] to pray through
[28:18] that's the way every christian ought to
[28:20] feel tonight not waiting for somebody
[28:23] else but take the ourselves and go
[28:29] if through believe the bible to be a
[28:31] history
[28:32] it's also a prophetic book
[28:36] that tells that that same god shall rise
[28:39] in the last days
[28:41] it is time for him to come on scene
[28:44] that's what anaram know
[28:47] that moses had prophesied or not moses
[28:50] pardon me abraham
[28:52] have been given a promise by this god of
[28:54] history who hadn't answered a prayer in
[28:56] 400 years
[28:59] as far as we have record
[29:02] but he made a promise
[29:05] that he would bring them out
[29:10] and just seemingly we've had a silent
[29:12] god for a long time
[29:15] but the hour has come
[29:17] where he's going to rise on the scene
[29:21] one night when
[29:22] amram had prayed maybe for several years
[29:26] and his hair now was turning gray and no
[29:29] deliverance but just getting worse
[29:32] one night he got right down to business
[29:35] that's how we have to do it
[29:38] get right down to business
[29:40] he said what
[29:42] you promised this
[29:45] and we've looked forward to it
[29:47] and we see the signs all year and the
[29:49] time is at hand
[29:50] it's time for you to do something about
[29:53] it
[29:54] while he was in deep concentrated prayer
[29:58] praying with all his heart he looked
[30:00] standing in the corner
[30:02] he rubbed his eyes and looked again
[30:05] there's still an angel
[30:08] with a sword drawn
[30:11] he said deliverance is coming
[30:14] and you're going to bring a son into the
[30:16] world and he's going to be the one to
[30:19] deliver him
[30:21] see
[30:22] god always answers prayer doesn't he am
[30:26] i if we just hold on hmm
[30:32] praise god
[30:35] amen
[30:38] hallelujah
[30:43] yes
[30:45] this is the message today
[30:47] god
[30:48] always answer prayer
[30:54] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[30:57] and forever
[30:59] the same god
[31:01] that the prophet was talking about is
[31:03] the same god here today
[31:05] he is doing the same thing he does not
[31:08] change
[31:10] we are in the 40 days of prayer
[31:15] we're going to talk about how god
[31:18] is so good
[31:20] as brother tim
[31:22] minister last sunday
[31:25] god is good he never changed what he
[31:27] started from the beginning
[31:29] he is doing it today
[31:33] praise god
[31:35] we're gonna we're gonna go to slide
[31:37] number
[31:39] three
[31:46] when when we see it in god
[31:49] we see god
[31:51] no sorry we see it in god's creation
[31:56] what does the creation of god means to
[31:59] you tonight
[32:03] everything
[32:05] that we see around us
[32:08] speaks of god
[32:11] yes
[32:14] we we can talk about ourself
[32:17] as a human
[32:19] being
[32:21] only us
[32:22] can be a full sermon
[32:24] for what god is doing in our lives
[32:28] what about the stars
[32:32] what about the wise men
[32:34] the three wise men
[32:37] what about the moon
[32:40] they are all god's creation right
[32:44] the life we live daily
[32:49] speaks
[32:50] about god
[32:52] because the bible said
[32:55] we are
[32:56] the written
[32:58] epistles in our heart known
[33:01] and read by all men second corinthians 3
[33:06] 2 to 3.
[33:10] we can say we are christians
[33:13] not just the name christianity
[33:17] is the life that you live every day
[33:20] speaks about god speak about what you
[33:23] are what kind of christian you are
[33:26] hallelujah
[33:30] by
[33:31] coming to a church alone doesn't make
[33:34] you a christian
[33:38] our life
[33:41] speaks
[33:42] more than anything
[33:45] because we just read it
[33:47] see the life that we live daily
[33:50] speaks about god
[33:52] it's not just to
[33:55] uh i mean just
[33:57] like
[33:59] your hair
[34:00] your nice clothes
[34:02] and editing that makes you a message
[34:04] believer
[34:06] is god that inside of you coming out
[34:10] that makes you a christian
[34:13] because we see
[34:15] when we read we read the bible
[34:18] we see the life
[34:20] of
[34:22] our forefathers that release
[34:26] even when they go outside
[34:28] even their shadow by walking
[34:31] their shadow itself people can get
[34:34] healed
[34:36] so your life is always a prayer life
[34:40] it's a constituted life
[34:43] to god
[34:46] because we we we come over here always
[34:49] to service serve god right
[34:52] we don't come here because
[34:57] brother simon is here
[34:59] oh brother brother
[35:04] uh
[35:06] uh christopher is here or whatever the
[35:08] sister is no
[35:10] this house is the house of god
[35:13] we come together here every time we come
[35:16] together we have to prepare our ourself
[35:19] that we are coming to meet god
[35:22] and we are not coming here and go back
[35:24] the same way that we came
[35:27] so if we have been here 30-40 years
[35:30] there's supposed to be a change in our
[35:32] lives
[35:33] hallelujah
[35:35] nobody can tell you all the church door
[35:37] is open so i have to run because i know
[35:40] when i come here i get something special
[35:43] hallelujah
[35:45] because i cannot live without eating
[35:51] you eat two minutes
[35:55] a few a few

[35:59] time your belly started grumbling
[36:03] why
[36:04] is hank you hungry you need a strength
[36:09] so prayer
[36:12] and coming to church is one
[36:14] you cannot come to church without
[36:18] reading your bible
[36:20] and pray
[36:22] prayer is a christian work
[36:25] it's a christian life
[36:27] i
[36:28] can come and tell you and uh or anybody
[36:32] come and stand here and tell you you
[36:34] have to pray
[36:36] it's something that you have to know
[36:38] that that's your strength that's where
[36:40] your life lies
[36:42] as a christian
[36:44] why do you think that paul and all of
[36:47] them walking and the demons free because
[36:48] what
[36:50] their their dedication to god is real
[36:54] it's not a joke
[36:57] for us to come here it's not a joke it's
[36:59] real
[37:01] but abraham said
[37:03] if you want to be a christian
[37:05] be a christian
[37:07] if you want to be a bomb be a bomb
[37:10] there is no in between
[37:13] hallelujah
[37:15] thank you lord
[37:18] we should always
[37:21] conduct ourselves obedient to the word
[37:23] of god
[37:25] not to conform to this world here
[37:28] the world cannot give you nothing
[37:32] hallelujah
[37:34] praise god hallelujah
[37:38] amen we're gonna you're gonna give me
[37:40] you're gonna give me slide number five
[37:53] can you
[37:55] phantom the
[37:56] limits and
[37:58] limits and bounds
[38:01] of the greatness
[38:03] and the power of god
[38:06] the sky is no limit for god
[38:10] but it lies beyond your
[38:13] rich
[38:14] god knows
[38:16] the world
[38:19] of is dead
[38:21] but you do not know it
[38:24] god greatness is
[38:26] broader than
[38:28] the earth
[38:29] and rather than the sea
[38:35] it says there is no limitation of
[38:37] almighty greatness
[38:39] and the power of god
[38:40] in this world or where to come
[38:44] there is no limitation
[38:48] god is
[38:51] what we must all what we must do
[38:54] is to surrender ourselves completely to
[38:56] him
[38:58] just to be a tool that he can be used
[39:01] when needed
[39:04] when
[39:05] as a christian as a message believer
[39:09] you have to adopt a life christian life
[39:12] that you always be ready
[39:15] when god needs you
[39:17] you are there to be used
[39:20] it's not just to
[39:22] we all gather together here
[39:25] this time here is not a joke
[39:28] the word of god is real
[39:31] the baton is passed to us
[39:34] we are running the baton
[39:37] right now
[39:38] you know
[39:40] when god gave the commission to moses
[39:45] he gave him a sign
[39:47] and he said if they don't listen to you
[39:50] i will show you the sign
[39:52] rebrand
[39:53] has
[39:54] sent has given us the message right now
[39:57] there's a sign to it
[40:01] but abraham
[40:03] everywhere he go people recognize him
[40:08] that god is with him
[40:10] if you last time
[40:12] somebody said even pope said
[40:14] everywhere
[40:17] his footsteps
[40:19] is blessed
[40:22] now he said
[40:25] i must decrease he must increase
[40:30] when the lord jesus christ was in the
[40:31] earth
[40:33] and john the baptist baptized him
[40:36] i john the balance said
[40:39] he i must decrease he must increase what
[40:42] happened
[40:44] so many things happen
[40:47] why that was the word the manifestation
[40:49] of the word of god people get healed
[40:53] people get saved people get what they
[40:56] want
[40:58] for god and god's name
[41:00] begin to shine
[41:02] now the message is in our hearts
[41:07] we cannot do it alone
[41:10] god has seen you you have to contact him
[41:13] how can you contact god is by prayer
[41:17] how can you talk to god it's by prayer
[41:21] you cannot just live without prayer
[41:24] prayer is one of the most important
[41:30] in the christian
[41:32] life do we think apostle paul knew that
[41:35] god god would use him to that extent
[41:40] he fought against god
[41:46] but his son was too short to fight with
[41:49] him
[41:51] he tried to injure himself god by his
[41:54] own
[41:55] theological teaching and power but he
[41:58] couldn't work until he met god
[42:01] face to face
[42:02] and surround fully to him
[42:05] what tell us
[42:07] there is not a joke now
[42:09] we have to be serious
[42:10] you have to surrender
[42:12] you cannot box with god our hand is too
[42:15] short to walk to god
[42:18] let us get ready
[42:19] and fight
[42:21] the fight god has given us everything
[42:24] that we need for this gospel
[42:27] you there is no excuse for each and
[42:30] everyone here
[42:33] the
[42:34] gospel is real
[42:37] and it's manifesting
[42:41] don't tell me that god is not
[42:42] manifesting right now he is really
[42:45] manifesting right here
[42:47] as we are sitting here right now
[42:51] if you don't see him or you don't see
[42:53] him in your life and if don't think god
[42:55] is not manifesting it's manifesting
[42:57] every day
[42:59] i see it
[43:01] other people say
[43:03] hallelujah glory to god
[43:08] you cannot do anything nothing with your
[43:10] own power
[43:16] you
[43:16] ha
[43:18] you cannot do nothing by your own power
[43:20] until you allow god to break and mold
[43:22] you
[43:24] and to shape you that he
[43:27] shape you that he want
[43:29] only then he can send you out to do the
[43:31] work that he entrusted in your hands
[43:35] you have to allow god to use you
[43:38] we are tools
[43:41] when god needed
[43:43] he can pick up anybody
[43:46] it doesn't matter whether he can speak
[43:48] english
[43:50] you can speak french
[43:52] you can speak anything that's why it's
[43:55] multi what uh

[44:06] anywhere it's anywhere
[44:08] we are all god tools he can direct you
[44:11] anywhere that you want
[44:14] so you have to allow god
[44:16] to use you

[51:20] isaiah
[51:21] 9 6.
