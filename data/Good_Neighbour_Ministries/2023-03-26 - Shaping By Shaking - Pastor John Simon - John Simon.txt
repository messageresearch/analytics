we welcome uh is that Mr Trevor Johnson we're seeing there oh God bless you good to see Johnson family good to see every one of you here in the house of the Lord and blessed be his name for his Tender Mercies to every single one of us amen the weather is changing and we're going to see no doubt some of our Brethren and that have tried to escape from the Winter's cold especially some of the older ones and no doubt in a month or so they'll be returning here to be in the house of the Lord praise the Lord amen we are here together to Worship the Lord aren't we amen we are here to magnify and glorify his name um can I have some music I know I'm calling you back but can I have someone play some music oh the sisters yeah I see praise the Lord you can play the guitar or piano or you know he plays the stuff at his fingers or some when he's ready his toes everything so he's able Praise Him no no no we're together again thank you praising the Lord we're together again [Music] some people going to happen [Music] cook is in store we're together again [Music] [Applause] everybody we're together again just praising the Lord we're together again [Music] something good going to happen something good is in store we're together again just praising the Lord one more time to live together again just praising the doors we're together again [Applause] [Music] going to happen some days [Music] just praising the Lord amen we're together again just praising the Lord now those words don't mean uh you know the normal what we used to sing or think about but we're singing praising praying preaching with understanding amen let me save you together again we know what we mean we know that we were in the house of God in the heavens together and therefore brought together from from the East the western North in the South that's why brother Branham loved that song because he recognized that those elected saints of God those ones that were with him his children that were with him and in him are called together when they hear the familiarity of the voice that called them and spoke to them in the morning coming in the evening time under inspiration of the evening Messenger to call us and bring us to attention of his word and now that we are here as Spirit beings that were once in God the great spirit sent down to the Earth to live down here and to be in human bodies with a plan with a purpose for his glory and then now that we are made manifest In the Flesh the flesh fails us was our brother preached the other night the flesh may be failing you but your real identity is you're not identified by your actions on the outside and the things that happen in your being on the outside you're identified by the spirit of God working through you by the seed of life by the gene of God making itself manifest through you and I'm so glad for that that we don't live on the condemnation but we live under grace justification just as you're never done it in the first place because you never did the spirit and you never did your flesh your body you get influence your imagination your your memories your thoughts everything else took you off from the word of God but the word of God comes and God sends his preachers this men of God whoever they are and tries to bring us back to line us up with the word so that he can take us back where we come from but we say we are together again that's because here we are gathered together in this house uh you know we may not be all that we want to be on the Earth we're trying to be the best that we can be on the earth and we may never be fully what we want to be but we are who God says we are my son my daughter my child it doesn't matter how the devil tries to paint you blacken your name whatever he wants to do whatever he wants to call you he can call you what he wants he's only going to do that for age of time but time passes and blends right into eternity amen and that will all pass away praise the Lord hallelujah thank you so much God bless you all appreciate you amen God bless you thank you so much for the music we appreciate you all amen God is good isn't he praise the name of the Lord he's the same yesterday to the end forever praise God last week we started on the subject of God uh you know shaping The Living Stones not not rocks that were put in the Solomon's Temple back there but living stones placed into his Heavenly Temple where he you know Solomon said I'll build you a house you're gonna build me a house the heaven the heavens can't contain me I own everything so are you going to build me up anyway go ahead but that's not my house right so God built building his house built his house and is building his house and we know that each one of us is one of those stones that comes for to fit in God's Temple he tries to fit you in the Earthly house the church right down here as an example or a symbol of how he will fit us into his Heavenly uh his Heavenly Home his Heavenly house which the Bible says you are the Temple of the living God as a book of Revelation says the voice cried out from the throne saying and now the habitation of God is with men and I will dwell in them and they shall be my people and I will be their God hallelujah so he has this Great temple yet we are living in but uh for us to take our place positionally in the body of Jesus Christ he has to shape us and last week we touched on the fact that God uses uh his stone masons to to shape us and sometimes the pastor preaches a messaging or says something that God will make him even say some things deliberately to get you mad to get you angry sometimes you get you sad you know God will make that man say all kinds of things that you don't know what in the world what's wrong with this person the person themselves don't know what's wrong with them because it's not that you know the man is God but the devil is in the world and he's so cunning that he will play with people's mind and say oh that's just him trying to make an excuse for his foolishness or his this or his death oh my goodness and it's something there to sit and listen and know what the devil is doing and you have to leave it alone and how people's minds are working and going like that my goodness it's something else but that's the way God works he's shaping us and using the ministerial gifts that he has placed in the church to shape us amen praise God so it is important that we submit ourselves to the ministry gifts of God not as the man But as God working through those men for his glory and for his honor amen so of course a lot of uh of ministers take abuse take advantage of that and and a spiritual child abuse goes on and we're not here for that we're never here for that but any parent knows no matter how they love their child and if they do really love their child then their love will be both comforting and they're going to be corrective it'll also know when to warn and when to whip you know God does that and that's the way he does praise the Lord amen let's read our scripture first uh before we start talking about these things and make a go one step further and um I wanted to end it all today but um there's one more uh message that has to comfort from this I pray the Lord will make the way for that we'll read out of uh Hebrews chapter 12. and reading from verse 25 right to 29. let's read together see that ye refuse not him that speak it for if they escape not who refuse him that spake on Earth much more shall not re-escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven you know that's talking about those that refuse when he spoke from Earth to Moses and they refuse and reject that and saying all and Moses you go and carve that stuff yourself and bring it down the air because you want to have influence and you want to bless the this and that the people and so on like that we like the devil does he puts it off on demand and God says no you refuse him back there but now that messenger from Heaven has come down and he's speaking again and when he speaks with much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven amen praise the Lord glory to God whose voice then shook the Earth but now he had promised saying yet once more I shake not the Earth but also the heaven praise God Amen and this word yet once more signifies the removing of those things that are Satan or supposed to be shaken as those things which are made that those things which cannot be shaken shall remain blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah amen wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our God is a consuming fire praise the Lord a gracious Heavenly Father uh simply we we have just read your word and father we ask that the great Holy Spirit who moved on the face of the waters in rev Genesis 1 the spirit of God moved upon the face of the word Waters and then God said let there be light grant that father that the same angel that moved upon the waters in the times of Jesus that stepped forth and asked do you want to be healed do you want to be well and this one who stirred the waters thank you Lord is here again with us today and we give you a blessing and praise and honor as we come together in Jesus name for his glory amen and amen God bless you please be seated uh you know uh first of all I spoke of God shaping his stones on his kingdom and from the point of view God using men to shake shape these Stones um for to fit into his kingdoms but we know that God also shaped the Earth the entire universe and the World by his word he shaped it by the sharp tool of his word and the voice of God as the book of Psalms will tell you shake at the Earth the Thundering voice of the Lord causes the mountains to quake and the cities of Lebanon began to break because of the voice of the Living God Amen Hallelujah you know in the beginning God spoke the word and scientists will tell you all of us there was a Ice Age there was ages where God carved and chopped out the Earth by using earthquakes and using uh you know these various elements Amen to cause some parts to go low and other parts to go high and become a mountain but he uses that by his voice and his voice shaped the entire Earth and the universe it placed every tree and every object that he wanted right where it ought to be he knew where he wanted a certain type of Pine Tree on top and if you brought it down to the valley it would survive because it wasn't made to survive down there in the world it was made to survive on the mountain top so God caused the entire Earth the world to be framed by his voice which is the word Hebrews 11 3 for we understand that by faith the worlds were framed by the word of God the worlds were shaped they were framed by the voice of God hallelujah and he says we know that by faith that's how we know by a revelation he knew that the world was shaped and formed by the word of God now just as much as God shape the world the natural world by his voice by his word God is taking the bride to another level not where only man being used to shape those stones but he is shaping the Stones by his own voice he's shaping it again and doing it for his glory so I want to talk about God's Champion by shaking he is shaping Us by shaking us just as much as he did the same thing in the world out there praise the Lord now to quote brother Branham getting into the spirit oh there's my friend Joseph goes Boze he always told me years ago brother Branham we always I always have this feeling in my heart that I want to see Chicago shook I want to see Chicago shock amen and I turned to him and said Brother Joseph Brother Joseph your great desire has already been fulfilled you see uh but you see you don't fully understand it you see oh my because when you talk about shaking a city shaking a nation that doesn't mean God is going to shake that Atomic father that is out there running around it means that he is checking his bride amen the bride is the one that gets the shaking that's not that ecclesiastial group it's not the body of Christ the church world no matter what denominational dams they give themselves that's not what he is shaking no sir see he is shaking his elect and that's the one the body of Christ that shakes he shakes to get it back in line again with his War he wants to get her back in line with his word now you can think on that they were once in line but now they're out of line and he's bringing them back in line with his word now brother bran was speaking again I am convinced that Chicago has already been shook amen not the Canon father not these great buildings they have out there great skyscrapers up and down the street not these women immorally dressed not these men these drunks and carrying on them who even call themselves Christians and going to church and then go eat some light bread and make something out of that I don't believe in that stuff go into the church belching whiskey all kinds of stuff on their breath think of it then go out and take communion and then have their name on the church book amen and then call themselves Christian I don't believe in that I believe the Church of Jesus Christ is a called out group do you believe that I believe that the Church of Jesus Christ is a Sanctified group Sanctified by the blood of Jesus Christ I believe she is set aside for service I believe the things that we are now seeing if you can understand that is the appearing of Jesus Christ in our midst today do you believe that [Music] hallelujah amen praise God hallelujah now you see what he's talking about that um you know uh one time he asked brother Billy Paul he says all the meetings were wonderful how many people do you think understood what I preached on and he turned around and said well you know oh they all understood that's why they were shouting and praising God and giving glory in the spirit of God falling like that and the other and he says how many do you really think understood what I preached about and Billy Paul said I don't know I don't know he says only that many and you're talking about thousands and thousands of people in there when he said that but let's go on and you'll understand further here amen hallelujah now he was trying to tell brother uh Madison Bose Chicago has already been shook but uh you are looking and saying that you're waiting for it to be shaken it's already been shook it's just you didn't recognize that it was shook because the shaken is not those thousands of people that were shaking under the holy ghost in the building is the ones that he elect in there that were shaken by the word of God because that's when the spirit began to shake some people loose from denominational ideas and beliefs they had in their mind and the Word was shaking them to pull them away from that that they can recognize the word for their day recognize what God is doing and are they our time by his Great and Mighty Holy Spirit hallelujah amen and I believe the same thing is happening today do you believe that amen because you know many people who still claim to be the bride and in this message they're still looking for a shaking coming up the road somewhere up there but uh that's not bad but the fact is you're doing that because you've been trapped by a Pentecostal view of what's supposed to happen what do I mean the Pentecostal view of what they thought was going to be the Rapture was was was a lightning or a trumpet blown or or on a certain morning and all of a sudden Graves crack and as the graves crack people are rising up with white knight gongs on and slowly going drifting up into the heavens we come to understand by the opening of the World by a prophetic Ministry that's not the case amen that's not the case absolutely not that's not the way it's going to be but for many years that's the way we viewed it even when he came in the message we viewed it that way until he preached they about the Rapture and the trees stages of the Rapture the show The Voice the trumpet The Crawling Away by the grace of God then we begin to glimmer of understanding of what it was but while we were in this message we still have the Pentecostal point of view because that's the only frame of reference I'm going to slow down a little bit because I want you to get what I'm saying see we come with that background of a Pentecostal environment we're looking at things with that Focus so when God says this we see it that way but that's not the way of the word right listen praise the Lord so we understand that because praise the Lord so we we think that we got to have a shaking in the bride with filled with a lot of emotions and there will be emotions and there will be a lot of emotions praise the name of the Lord see but you see the end time evangelism is shaking the Bride of Jesus Christ and it's already shaking the bride right now preaching like this is already shaking the brain you might not recognize it but it's shaking the brain the Devils who uh and whips who sit around and hang around the church building on the church house praise God yes sir don't you think you alone come to church the devil is in church regularly more than you he's always there he's ready there to listen he's ready there to obstruct to undermine he's always there trying to undermine the kingdom of God to sort doubt fear or whatever it can but I want you to know this my friends many people are acting and saying that way because they don't already recognize like brother Branham said to brother Madison what has happened and what is happening by the grace of God hallelujah we're already sitting right here but let me tell you Philistines are running left and right devils are scattering everywhere because of this word they don't want to deal with this word of God it scatters them left right and Center amen and the bride of Christ is the one that's receiving that word I think there's a song that goes something like God's church is the power that's shaking this hour is that what it says but that's not so that's what uh when I was studying there brother to me says that's not so in a way that's so but that's not what it is God's word is the power that's checking this hour amen that day of redemption is nigh God's word is what shakes the Church the true elect bride of Christ is shaking by the word nothing else influences her nothing else causes her to move anyway but God's word checks the Bride of Jesus Christ amen praise the name of the Lord yes sir o praise God I tell you right now she's being chopped she's being healed out she has been shaken by the word of God hallelujah amen look over here I want to go to this marvelous wonderful book here I didn't have to bring it in but um you know I was getting frustrated searching and searching for the quote on the computer so I just shut it down and went to find this old book here uh where he said now when a mother Eagle builds her nest she gets Vines and sticks and leaves and pieces of wood and even Briars Thorns she is very careful she doesn't want her babies to be pierced by the Briars or have pieces of sticks poking and poking at them now remember uh maybe about 20 minutes before he had said you know God is the is a great the great ego do you know God is a great Eagle then he moves on and he's now talking about an eagle again but he's saying this Eagle likes to build her nest and when they build a nest they put the young ones in the nest but they make sure that the nest is nice and comfortable that they can fit in there see oh my so what does she do she finds a lamb and slays it amen he's talking about God and Jesus Christ and why Jesus Christ had to die but he's telling just the story and if you're not listening you won't understand what he's talking about you think he's talking about an eagle in the tree or something but here it is now she finds that lamb shreds it takes the skin to the nest and works it around until she has that Nest real cozy and they feel comfortable her babies are now comfortable see and that's what God does oh my when God sees we are born again he watches during the service to see how we will act and what we will do during that service don't you ever forget that but he will prepare a nest for you there in his kingdom have you been comfortable in this church have you been comfortable under the ministry of the word of God praise the Lord hallelujah now then we understand after a while she watches her Eagles and when they are fully feathered when she begins to think now they are starting to mature sufficiently then she deliberately begins to shake that nest and that's what the spirit of God wants to do in our hearts and in our lives is to shake the nest and by shaking unless he shapes the bride he shapes those little ones the character their strength their confidence their faith and their own ability amen praise God hallelujah or yes amen so she will shake the nest doing what she's shaking loose shaking all the loose feathers that are on them all your loose ideas God wants to shake them loose that we must recognize young changing word of the Living God Amen why is she doing that she's getting them ready for a flight but it is to be there so low flight you see every true servant of God has to do the same thing he has to shake loose all those around him not alienate but shake them loose because they have to step out on their own praise the Lord hallelujah not run back to Mama and ask her should I flap my wings no they don't have time for that you're falling fast and if you don't somehow flap them you're going to crash on the rocks or something so so so she she deliberately shakes The Nest throws them out of the nest shake it say you know praise the Lord God Will Make A man of God see all kinds of things what shake your shake you in the nest cause you to run out there and say what is that I can't take that no more but it's the spirit of God shaking the nest so that you will now want to make a soul of light praise the Lord hallelujah yes oh my she's shaking that Nest getting them ready for their soul of light and them little Eagles somehow they know are doing that something is fixing to happen because they are also eagles they feel the blast of the mighty rushing Winds of God and the nest is him for a shaking amen I believe this Nest is in for a shaking it has had a shaking it's having a shaking it's in for us shaking by the grace of God Hallelujah then she gives a certain scream and those baby eagles oh my know how to place their feet in her wings you see brother Branham says you know those feathers are a type of the promises of God now they're taking the promises for themselves they're holding to the word for themselves they are their faith is standing braced not their mother's Faith brace them like you brace a plant until it comes to full strength no the mothers the pastors strengthened Faith braced you until you get to that point but when you get to that point then he wants your eyes on Jesus Christ so he's got to shake your loose that you recognize Jesus Christ amen Look Away to Jesus amen blessed be the name of the Lord God your mind she shakes them off then off they go and when they get up high amen when she gets them up there realize you would think oh my but she then shakes them off amen when they're at that height he says it again here right when they are in the middle of the air at that height then she shakes them off amen but she doesn't leave them he says she's circling and she's watching she's watching how they're how they adjust to the shaking off how they adjust to the soul of flight that they're now got to make God is shaping them by shaking them off and that's what I'm talking about here today sometimes that's the way sometimes a parent has to do with with their children they have to say well enough is enough I'm not paying you no more attention but even though they say that they're still watching from the side of their eyes amen praise God but God has to shake us off I mean we genuinely have to stand on our own praise God not looking back over your shoulder at the pastor not looking over the shoulder over here to see if brother so and so not looking over here to see if Daddy or Mommy no but now you're standing on your own two feet while you're coming to maturity you're coming to the maturity of the word of God and that's where the word of God is taking us right now into Divine maturity amen of character and identifying whose character you have in you amen praise the name of the Lord shopping and shaping and bringing her to a right place into the house of God hallelujah remember when she shakes them off she doesn't just leave them but she makes a big circle but she is watching see she's watching and she leaves them that they will come together and get one great big old-fashioned Pentecostal Jubilee among themselves when they begin to recognize I can do what Mama used to do I can do what Daddy used to do I can do it I can do it like you like the all you know the story of the old little train so I think I could I think I could and then when he made it to the top I know I can I know I can't I know I can amen you made it over the other side by the grace of the Living God hallelujah amen oh my praise God hallelujah he says remember Joseph said to me I want to see Chicago shook and I also said to him Brother Joseph God Don't Lie you have already seen Chicago shock amen but you see the natural man I didn't see any building Shake right I didn't see I just see people coming into meetings and they were shaking and this and that and the other but you know because people are buildings right so so I didn't see building Shake I didn't see people shake like that and everything else like that but you see oh my but you see now I want you to know Joseph I Joseph don't you realize that it is shaking it's already shaking God is Not shaking the rubbish that is out there that he's going to destroy you know in Israel we passed over the valley of gehenna that is where in the old days they took the rubbish and burnt it and that is what in a way he's not saying that telling that whole thing but that's what he's thinking about all the rubbish that's on the earth amen uh it's going to be going into gehenna or hell where it will be burnt amen my you see the rest of that is already being destroyed going to be destroyed but the bride is checking there was only 120 out of the millions in an upper room when their shaking came amen yes sir oh my that's right that's what he does the shaking is in the people that's where the real shaking goes on it's in the elect praise the name of the Lord hallelujah where is the shaking going on within the hearts of the elect I don't know about you but it shook me away from all my Pentecostal beliefs not only that I got him a message and bit by bit he chipped he chipped he checked and began to shake me away from my old message beliefs that were contrary to the word of God oh my God checking us and shaping Us by the revelation of the word of God God's word is the power that shaken this hour the day of redemption the Rapture is nigh brother sister hallelujah amen so the shaking is in the hearts of God's people praise God remember down there there was a Baptist preacher in the Bible whose name was Apollos that's not brother Branham is saying that here amen whose name was Apollos and he hadn't received the Holy Ghost and wasn't baptized in the name of Jesus Christ Paul passing through the upper course of Ephesus find this church and it was a mighty Church the Bible speaks of it amen and this he said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed and therefore he says remember he said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe in the middle of them while they were shouting while they were praising God while they were having a wonderful time and saying oh my and he comes saying have you received the Holy Ghost isn't that so much something like today while people shouting and having a great time nothing's wrong with that but he said with all of that is good but have you received the Holy Ghost you see because they are thinking the Holy Ghost supposed to be like it was on the first day of Pentecost and they didn't even understand that because what the apostles really got brother Branham said was the Revelation from Heaven struck their hearts and they got so excited to try to talk to one another they couldn't speak to one another it wasn't the tongues that showed they were filled with the Holy Ghost but the reception of divine understanding by Revelation filled them with the Holy Ghost then that brought the emotions and that brought the praising on the shouting of the glory of God hallelujah that's why Paul was saying he says if your Shout Shout with the understanding you're saying sing with the understanding if you read pray whatever you do do it with the Revelation in you why are you doing it or else you just shout into the wind you're just beating uh keep him a whole lot of noise and it's not the real Holy Ghost amen praise God Amen yes sir so the real revelation is Revival is a Revival caused by Revelation within the hearts of God's people praise the name of the Lord and that's why uh you don't have to see me walk up here and first perform a miracle before you start praising God for his word because the word of God as it comes forth within itself you recognize there's something going on and your natural mind can't grasp it and you never will grasp it because Paul calls that the mystery of preaching amen the mystery of preaching is the holy spirit working and doing that praise God so the bride's Revival is now going on what is going on with him praise the name of the Lord within the hearts of men praise God so because why I don't know about you but I have been shaken by by your pouring of the word of God upon my life upon your hearts what I see God doing in your life I received an outpouring of that brother sister praise the name of the Lord amen praise God hallelujah amen so I I praise him because he has chapter shaped us healed us oh my body are pouring of his word that we might be brought into Conformity of the image of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen this is a kind of an image he was showing you parts of his personality that that uh of course he can't show you all being God God is everything but he just showed you the main parts of his personality and and even if you get that it it will help you praise God it will help you to really be Christ's light but you don't get that by going out on the street and I'm buying it or adding it to yourself it's it's the gene the seed of God in you which is Jesus part of himself within you when the Revelation moisture of the word strikes that it comes to life and when it comes to life every day like every plant will do it begins to add a leaf a bond a leaf and it begins to add because it comes from within itself not from outside but from within itself it begins to grow and express and manifest and then you can see the identification of what kind of a plant it really is what kind of a seed did it come from Hallelujah because the holy spirit is doing that praise God when Paul told them have you received the Holy Ghost they said we were baptized under John amen and they said that he said that don't work no more God you've got to be baptized all over again praise the Lord oh my I was baptized when I came in a message amen that don't work no more amen now you you got to receive the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost praise the Lord praise God now just look on that thought receiving the Holy Ghost how it was looked at by Wesley amen he believed you have to express a Sanctified life and that proved you that the Holy Ghost and come to the lutherans the Westlands you come down to Pentecostals we receive the Holy Ghost you have to speak in tongues amen you come down to the message now and the prophet says no you have to express a christ-like life it's not the tongue of the shoe it's the whole shoe it's him you know not part the peace here and a peace there and a peace there instead you create a Frankenstein I mean National presentation uh no you you have to present Christ and then you know he'll turn around and say but how are you going to present Christ it's like a a dirty pot trying to produce something pure no you come predestinated with that seed of life within you and what you have to do is to believe the Waters of the world let therefore present water from the rock drench your soul and bring forth the life that is already in you and when that begins to express itself which is Christ in you your hope of glory when it begins to express itself that is perfection already dwelling deep within that Perfection will Express all these virtues and it says automatically automatically it will begin to express itself many many places you can see he says you don't go to a sheep and says oh produce wool or you go over to a dove and say produce oil you know no he says it just naturally automatically produces oil and produces wool as it eats as it grows it begins to produce it because that's what it is you are a son you're a daughter of the Living God Hallelujah with the Holy Spirit waves and waves of the oceans of the Holy Spirit sweeping of your soul after a while what does he do it produces back what you really are what the seed is and where it come from Hallelujah and that's how God identifies his own go back look at the messages think on them Christ is identified by his own characteristics amen so so we'll know God will know Christ is in you when he sees you're bringing forth his characteristics praise the Lord shaking think of it God shaking them God don't shake that out there health is going to shake light when it begins to receive that right oh my just think of it Hallelujah the only ones that are really shaken today and I don't mean have to walk around being a shaker as I used to call those people long ago they walk in the wrong shaking all the time like that to show like they're under the power of the Holy Ghost so they're shaking shaking shaking no but praise God the only ones shaking within their heart is the Bride of Jesus Christ for you to shake loose from some of the things that you held dear it only took the the Hebrews 4 12. the sharp word of God to surgically take that tumor out to take out the cancer to take out all of those things planted in our hearts and Minds by the devil the evil one amen he said and everyone an enemy has done this amen so the word the scalpel of the word of God has come to what Shoppers you must shape us and Deliver Us and set us free set you lose from every bondage the devil place on your mind your body whatever it is hallelujah oh praise God forevermore amen praise God before they even get to hell they're gonna start shaking because all the things they're laughing at we are saying I gotta live my life don't worry with them oh I don't listen to that nonsense you know have a good time they're gonna start shaking you know why we don't have to do nothing they're going to see hell on Earth the Bible says in in Isaiah hell has opened this mouth and pushed itself upon the Earth it started to manifest right amongst the people have you ever seen we thought we were there were bad men and women back in the old days they were bad but nothing like what we're seeing that their devils are walking the streets demons are walking on our streets my men are walking in our streets people fit for the mental institution are walking on the streets hallelujah it's going on right now and let me tell you Jesus said it will wax worse and worse as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the day when the son of man is being revealed oh my my my oh my God think of it in the Bible when those men came to us to uh lot's house lot says oh I have I have visitors here which were the two angels I've visited us here uh you know uh and I said no I'll give you my daughters you know take my daughters they said no we don't want your daughters we want the man we want those two men we want to know them amen you gotta understanding you know what I'm talking about we want to know them give us the man oh my it's only because those men were Angels by said they raised their hands and blinded them amen and Jesus turns around and says as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be again when the son of man is being revealed the evils and the accumulation of sin and Evil on this Earth is going to be getting worse and worse until you have yourself don't want to be here no more you're going to be able to not only sing it but in your heart this world is not my home I'm just a passing through my treasures are LED up somewhere beyond the blue the Angels beckon me from Heaven's open door and I want be at home in this world anymore it almost feels like that right now but we're getting closer and closer to it every day amen and when they go through that phase they go through that phase of evil and I even I haven't even gone into all the things that going on right now buying and selling a human parts there are all kinds of evil selling of men and women all kinds of things going on in the world that the world doesn't hear or know anything about it's in the dark the devil is operating and it's all happening brother sister oh my but praise God but then they are going to have their greatest shaking with the oncoming of the Great Tribulation amen by that time we are gone praisal I said by that time we are raptured out of here [Applause] no man wants his wife to get troubles and problems and this and that brother Branham said look just like the natural man if he's thinking that way what about God God is Whitehead bride is not going through any tribulation he is going to see to it she doesn't go through any tribulation but he'll take her out of here before the tribulation comes glory to God aren't you happy here today let's give the Lord a hand right now when the tribulation the knowledge judgments Begin to Fall the burning of Mr Babylon oh my goodness all the gods fires and brimstone dropping from the heavens glory to God now we say fire and brimstone maybe it was the literal one then but now fire and brimstone the bombs you know coming and dropping upon the upon uh mystery Babylon upon Babylon and destroying her in one hour fry the whole thing oh yes brother sister oh praise God but we'll look to the heavens God is just letting us know what's happening amen but only the bride is getting our shaking now and our shaking is by the word amen oh praise God shaken by the word praise the Lord hallelujah but I'm afraid many message people don't understand yet maybe they will but yet they don't fully understand even me talking now in this way to you many hearing me on line many hearing me preach the word they have no conception of what you're talking about and they will even say what is he talking about what does that mean what is that you see what you are either in the veil or you're outside the veil you're either in the ark or you're outside the ark whatever the case is but let's look here we find that there are a lot of message people amen because you know the deception is not out there that is open for any real spiritual believer to recognize the sin the evil is of evident the real deception now is right in the garden it's right in the message the devil walking right up and down seeing whom he can devour who he can deceive who he can throw off your mind in this area that way this way or the other way praise God but it's home time now let's Rapture time now it's evening time and we're all going home by the grace of God Amen when they're going home they're staggering while they're going home under the The Hangover that they got from the old Pentecostal wine they drank so much of it that they're going home all right they're going back to the presence of God but they're staggering while they're going because they're under the influence of the old Pentecostal uh hangover that they had amen and and they're going around oh praise God there's a great Revival coming you know they're drunk you know something is wrong it's a good man but oh man staggering not on the on this going on right now but how is it I'm not seeing signs I'm not seeing wonders I'm not seeing Miracles we got to see that uh you know you see oh my brother sister we don't have to see anything all he wants us to see is him the word and he took me to Book of Revelation and says how did the overcome and they overcame him by the word of God and by their testimony it's the word of God that overcomes the devil oh my praise God not the written word but the revealed word The Living Word overcomes the devil or my praise God forevermore yes sir she's getting her shaken now praise God oh praise the Lord amen you know how many ministers and Brethren I meet so oh my I'm looking for that great day where the Holy Spirit Will demonstrate himself when there's going to be signs wonders and stuff like that and whether Brandon said this over here the heavens will open up and speak on harms and legs they are don't see the whole picture where he says many of the things I said and done were deliberately said enough to pull your spirit out to see what's back there what's hung over what's holding on to you amen you he wants you to see him only let my eyes see Jesus on it amen praise the name of the Lord amen praise God you don't understand and I I didn't bother with all these quotes you can find him yourself where brother Branham said they do not understand that it's not going to happen over here it is going to happen under the two witnesses Revelation 13 this is going to happen under them to reduce because they're going to receive what we received you know he preached to us the word Jesus Christ is the Messiah they're gonna go back and preach to them that Jesus Christ who was the word is your Messiah and you were blind you didn't see him amen he says that will be there Jubilee Praise God and that's where the signs and the Wonders are going to take place amen praise God we already had our first phone we already had our second Pole now it's the word itself amen [Music] that thing comes to its maturity in the fullness of the word and all this word is going to do is keep going higher and higher and when he says higher and higher he says remember God always hides in simplicity you're gonna appear like it's nothing but that's when it really is the powerful at once even when you go to let's go to ammunitions do you know the smaller they make something is the more powerful it becomes when they break down those atoms right down to neutrons two runs down onto Cobalt down down the smaller they can get to the smaller part of it the explosion becomes worse and that's where God's word comes down in Revelation to his people amen praise God hallelujah amen so the evening time evangelism is what then not shaping it's shaping the bride but is shaking her by uh shaping her by shaking her loose loose from our own thoughts from her own ideas from her own theories do you know you say oh you're talking about Panic no even you coming to this message you study brother Brown's message and you start to develop some of your own ideas you start developing your own theories and you you're certain that it's right but the point about that is that even that you gotta surrender and let the word the Holy Spirit begin to clean by the word begin to shape Us by his word Lord of God shaken us out of all of our conceptions praise God hallelujah and all kinds of vines that were wrapped you were wrapped up and Tangled Up In until he has to say it don't it don't pay to get your lines Tangled in these kinds of times you can't allow to get them tangled up oh my so the word comes to do what shape Us by shaking us loose amen praise the Lord we've been bound too long in all kinds of things like that amen see others shout when they see signs wonders and miracles and if they're coming here they're going to wonder why you shouting because they don't understand they're seeing the greatest Miracle take place of the unwritten word manifesting itself and in and expressing Itself by Revelation they can't see that Hallelujah my praise God hallelujah amen now uh we of course we Shout when we see the miraculous unfolding of the word not the Miracles of science wonders and so on Matthew 21 1 to 11. let's just look quickly at this aren't you happy for the word of God I'm going to quote brother Branham here and you have the scriptures up there okay he says now on that great day their anticipation was high and over the top of Mount olives Come A Little White Donkey walking down the hill to them oh my and there it was people when they saw that see praise God when those people the people fanatically screaming pulling off Palm leaves off of the trees throwing their clothes on the road and screaming Hosanna to the son of David that comes in the name of the Lord his rider on that little mule that little donkey was none other than God's anointed Messiah of the hour praise the Lord why do they Shout why did they Shout oh not they didn't want to go back under the first pole yes they shouted under that because he had all kinds of signs wonders Miracles and thousands of people following him oh my they didn't want to go back to the second ball when he had discernment he could tell the secrets of the heart and he'll make the people's flesh quick and oh visible evidence you see they didn't want to go back to visible evidence of seeing this and seeing that and all that to satisfy the flesh no what we are aspiring to is to make the world live again that while Peter yet speak the Holy Ghost fell on them that heard the Lord caught the revelation Holy Spirit fell on them then when he falls on them anything the skies will anything can happen you don't have to worry about the rest of it the Holy Spirit takes care of that amen but I can't change my focus to signs wonders Miracles I'm watching to see this happen I'm watching no no no I'm watching to see the word made manifest and then all them things just spark right off of it just comes out like that praise the Lord I've told it many times and I still tell it again it's happened many other times uh speaking one time just like this not preaching about healing and all of a sudden one man in congregation he coughed up the cancer right on the floor isn't that me is the word the devil is scared of the word as it shines the light upon the day and the hour that we are living in of that people get up and run out the doors and the demons talking out to them oh we don't want that we and you know it's not the person that the voice changed the devil upon them praise the Lord some Believers have seen it preaching the word of God they fall on the ground and they're moving like a snake right on the floor by because the Holy Spirit but the anointed word of the Living God makes the world manifest hallelujah oh my goodness praise the Lord oh praise God now see then God what was God doing what was the attraction on the mountain on the hill it was God making history let's just change that word it's the word history it's the word making his appearance it's the word that is making himself manifest hallelujah oh praise God hallelujah that was the word that was none other than God's anointed Messiah of the hour and this is the anointed word of the hour and making themselves long making themselves manifested Hallelujah the word unveiling himself to the world Amen again God's word is the power that is shaking this hour amen yes the bride has another Revival yet oh no amen there's been no Revival there's been no real Stir of God right uh the to the bride as yet amen now let me tell you we are looking for that we are looking for it now but it will only take those seven centers to wake her up again it'll take the unwritten word it'll take that it will take the revelation of the word to really wet the bride up that's what brings the right Revival that's what brings her Revival within our heart that's where the quaking the shaking that's where it goes on praise the name of the Lord God hallelujah so them seven unknown tunders yes and he will send it o praise God hallelujah oh my oh praise God now he says there are people around me around him there that are believing that there will be some Awakening and they are good people see but what have they done they have not recognized The Awakening of the Bride they have not recognized The Awakening of the Bride amen but by being Christians they can sense and feel the pull of the hour but they haven't recognized or seen clearly what's being done amen that's what making them feel that way because they know there's something supposed to happen something is supposed to take place but they are really looking for it somewhere off in the future they're looking for it to come in the future amen oh my let me read the whole sentence they're looking for it to come way off in the future when it's already happening right by you now it's happening right by you now but they're hungover of how Pentecost used to make itself manifest demonstrate itself uh we look at that that way we have to see it that way and then we think that's really it amen praise God he says now that's the same thing that they're dealing them all this when they were believing in the coming of a messiah they believed there would be a forerunner to come but he was already there right amongst them and they didn't know it and didn't recognize it what's he talking about he says look he says when it says behold I send my message my for my face I'll make the high places law and the Lord places high he says you see they believe that mean the mountains gonna drop down and all the value is going to raise up and that's good he says no that wasn't it what he was telling you is that when the word Jesus comes on the scene all these high and mighty rabbis that look like they're great and everything else is going to bring them low it's going to expose them it's going to reveal to the people where they really are amen and the common people who hurt him gladly they are going to be raised up by the preaching of the word of the Living God hallelujah he said the same mistake is being made again today looking for it far off and having the Mosaic influence on them looking with the expectation of that kind of a thing and not seeing what was taking place right then amen when he preaches that in the message called recognizing your day and its message but when the real spiritual bride and I'm closing now when she begins to have a Revival when she begins to have a Revival see that's when she begins to come back amen he comes back then she begins to line herself up with the word of God hallelujah praise God are we lining ourselves up with the word of God are we lining up with the message of the hour amen watch then watch what happens then amen because then that there come a message at that time that will seep out there catch that bride catch that woman elect amen praise the Lord oh my you think he was talking about his message catching the brain no what he's talking about there is the messenger from heaven praise the Lord you've heard some of you have heard that message many years ago when the Holy Spirit began to break these things on me and show him look I have seven messengers of Earth and they all came seven of them to each Church age and then brother Brown said but this one that came to me he wasn't a messenger of Earth he he was the Lord From Heaven amen praise God and then in the church in the Statue of a perfect man he says I'm waiting I'm watching for them men and women that of this of the this this beyond the church ages oh the these who will be in the Eternal Church age that will come at the ending of the seals praise the lord well we know that the seals ended or not ended but they came forth in the auditions or change and the Eighth Day coming to into Force and the eighth day he called the Eternal Church age but he says he says but his church is you got to have a messenger and these seven were men of earth but this one he wasn't a word this one come from Heaven this was the Lord himself so we know that the even this messenger from heaven was the Lord himself this messenger that's talking to us by the word and bringing the message to the bride that he was talking about here now watch now he is supposed to receive that amen at that time there will be that message that will sweep out to catch that bride catch that woman elect at that time amen catch her praise God how catch her attention that's how the mess is going to catch her catch her attention amen at that time the Eternal messenger of the Eternal Church age that we call we all call that the Eighth Day this message that is now going forth is to attract the bride's attention of the day so that he the Prince of Life can sweep her off her feet and sweep her into Glory all thanks be to God what a great hour that we are living in I'm so thankful that he's the same yesterday today and forever and we can Fellowship around this forever and for a long long time but the physical frame can't take the preaching like this for hours and hours I know those
