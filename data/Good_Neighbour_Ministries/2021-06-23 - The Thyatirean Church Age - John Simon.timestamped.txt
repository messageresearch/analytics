[0:00] [Music]
[0:15] good evening
[0:16] my dear friends i'm so
[0:19] happy and thrilled to be
[0:23] with you here this evening
[0:26] as we study
[0:31] siren church age
[0:34] this age in this age we begin to see
[0:38] the identification
[0:42] of the originators
[0:45] and the institutors of
[0:49] denominational religion
[0:52] as the bible calls her mystery
[0:56] babylon the mother of harlots
[1:00] let us enter into our bible a teaching
[1:04] from the word of god
[1:05] as spoken by the
[1:08] seventh angel william marion branham
[1:15] the fulfillment of malachi 4 5
[1:19] and the spirit spoke through him saying
[1:23] these things but first
[1:27] let us read from the book of revelation
[1:30] chapter 2 verses
[1:34] 18 to 29
[1:38] and it reads thus
[1:41] and unto the angel
[1:44] of the church in siatira
[1:47] right these things said
[1:52] the son of god who had his eyes
[1:57] like onto a flame of fire
[2:00] and his feet are like fine brass
[2:05] i know thy works and charity
[2:10] and service and faith
[2:14] and thy patience and my works
[2:18] and the last to be more
[2:22] than the first
[2:26] notwithstanding i have a few things
[2:29] against thee
[2:31] because thou sufferest the woman jezebel
[2:37] which call it herself a prophetess
[2:42] to teach and to seduce
[2:46] my servants to commit fornication
[2:50] and to eat things sacrificed
[2:55] onto idols and i
[2:58] gave her space to repent
[3:02] for her fornication and she repented not
[3:06] behold i will cast her into a bed
[3:12] and them that commit adulterate her
[3:16] into great tribulation except
[3:20] they repent of their deeds
[3:24] and i will kill her children with death
[3:28] and all the churches shall know that
[3:32] i am he that searches their reigns and
[3:36] hearts
[3:37] and i will give unto everyone
[3:41] according to his works
[3:44] but unto you i say and unto the rest in
[3:48] tithira
[3:50] as many as have not this doctrine
[3:54] and which have not known the depths of
[3:57] satan
[3:58] as they speak i will put upon
[4:02] you none other burden
[4:05] but that which you have already
[4:08] hold fast till i come
[4:13] and he that overcome it and keep it
[4:16] my works unto the end
[4:20] to him will i give power
[4:23] over the nations and he shall
[4:26] rule them with rod of iron
[4:30] as the vessels of potter shall they be
[4:33] broken to shivers
[4:35] even as i have received of my father
[4:40] and i will give him the morning star
[4:45] he that hat an ear let
[4:48] him hear what the spirit
[4:52] said unto the churches
[4:55] our scripture reading for tonight
[4:59] let us pray our gracious
[5:02] god our loving heavenly father
[5:06] we thank thee for the gift of the holy
[5:09] spirit
[5:11] and of the word of god the bread of life
[5:16] as we feast upon the word today
[5:20] may your blessing come upon us
[5:23] enrich us encourage us
[5:27] and strengthen us causing us to grow
[5:31] into great trees of righteousness
[5:34] for thy glory honor and praise
[5:38] in the name of jesus christ our lord
[5:42] amen and amen
[5:46] the church age of sayathira
[5:52] now it is called the psia siren
[5:56] church age because god
[5:59] chose this city
[6:03] of tiotara
[6:06] as a as a representative
[6:10] or as a nursery
[6:14] of what was to come
[6:18] when that church age
[6:22] comes to its maturity from infancy
[6:26] to maturity so if we are to study we
[6:30] must begin
[6:32] by understanding the characteristics
[6:37] of the city of thyatira
[6:43] now concerning this city of satire
[6:46] historically
[6:48] speaking it was the least
[6:51] not worthy of the seven
[6:54] cities that god chose
[6:58] as representative cities
[7:01] and churches in those cities
[7:04] to represent the seven ages
[7:08] or the seven church ages we call them
[7:12] that were to come in
[7:16] other words these churches
[7:19] that were in asia and asia minor
[7:24] were like this seed bed or nurseries
[7:28] for the growth of the various
[7:32] spirit life and
[7:35] also of the word of god
[7:38] that was already planted in them
[7:43] and we are now here in the
[7:47] seventh church age at the end of the
[7:51] seven church age
[7:52] looking back and seeing the unfolding of
[7:56] prophecy
[7:58] and the fulfillment of the word of god
[8:02] right before our very eyes we are a
[8:06] blessed people
[8:08] we are a privileged people we are found
[8:12] standing in the gap looking
[8:15] backwards at prophecy spoken
[8:20] watching it unfold kind to its maturity
[8:25] in our day and our time and blessed to
[8:29] be
[8:29] able to look ahead
[8:32] to the future and see the future
[8:36] things or the things that are going to
[8:41] be
[8:43] we are blessed to be able to see
[8:46] and to understand that we may
[8:50] escape by the rapturing grace of god
[8:55] into the presence of god where we will
[8:59] continue
[9:00] to witness the unfolding of the
[9:03] earth history
[9:06] and all of the satanic manipulations
[9:11] that is taking place and will take place
[9:15] on the face of this earth and we will be
[9:18] given a grand stand
[9:20] amen we're in the lower seats now
[9:23] but one day we'll be called up higher
[9:27] and when we are here when we hear that
[9:29] voice saying
[9:31] come up hither then we'll answer the
[9:34] call
[9:35] there we will be with the other
[9:37] witnesses
[9:39] who will be able in the grandstands of
[9:42] heaven
[9:43] to be able to look down and to see the
[9:46] unfolding
[9:48] of the tribulations of the
[9:52] judgments the battle of armageddon
[9:55] and the things that must yet come to
[9:57] pass
[9:58] but for now we are looking at this city
[10:02] of science cyathira situated
[10:07] on the confines of miceae
[10:11] and eonia it was
[10:15] typically and i call this a type a
[10:18] spiritual eye will see this
[10:20] this city types a church and the city
[10:24] happens to be
[10:26] right at the confluence
[10:29] of several rivers
[10:32] several rivers flowed out
[10:36] from this city surrounded by many rivers
[10:42] and those rivers we're filled
[10:46] with religious all these
[10:50] the spiritual eyes sees them escapes
[10:55] because we know from out of the
[10:58] mother harlot church
[11:01] came all of the denominations
[11:06] of which god said i'll give you power
[11:08] over
[11:09] these nations and out of these
[11:13] many rivers of religion
[11:16] flowing from mystery babylon
[11:20] comes all of these denominational rivers
[11:25] filled with blood sucking and money
[11:29] sucking
[11:30] leeches that will take the very
[11:34] life out of you unless you can discern
[11:37] detect them
[11:39] and get them off of you and i know one
[11:43] good thing to make them
[11:44] fall away from you is fire
[11:48] and that's what we need in every heart
[11:51] and in every life
[11:52] is the fire of god to fall upon the
[11:55] altar of your heart
[11:57] oh praise god may the fires of god
[12:01] as we sing the song burn burn holy
[12:05] spirit burn in me set
[12:08] my soul on fire filled me
[12:12] with the holy ghost and with god's
[12:15] full desire amen make me
[12:19] like the christ of old healing and
[12:22] raising the dead amen oh
[12:25] give me the power of the holy spirit
[12:28] like jesus
[12:29] had amen may the holy may god
[12:32] fulfill his word bless his people
[12:36] in in a mighty marvelous and wonderful
[12:39] way
[12:41] now this city as many and most
[12:44] denominations are was
[12:48] well off very well off financially
[12:52] and it was well off financially
[12:55] listen which is spiritual heirs
[12:58] because the
[13:03] corporate interests for this
[13:06] also in there was the birth and growth
[13:10] of corporations coming
[13:13] from the guilds of
[13:16] the potter's guild of the potter's guild
[13:20] of the tanner's guild of the weavers
[13:24] well guild of the dyers guild of the
[13:27] rope makers
[13:29] carpenters guild rope makers guild
[13:33] it's like saying unions or it's like
[13:36] saying
[13:37] corporations they united themselves in
[13:41] secret
[13:42] orders that they can control
[13:45] all commerce and collect all
[13:48] monies and then the la the largest the
[13:53] the monies and the from that they will
[13:56] drop tons of it upon the of the the
[14:00] siren false church
[14:03] of their day and time
[14:06] and it was from this city that in the
[14:09] book of acts we hear
[14:12] of the lovely sister in the lord
[14:16] that has gone into the presence of god
[14:19] sister lydia who was a seller
[14:23] of purple and she came from there
[14:27] and she lydia was paul's first
[14:32] european convert
[14:35] so there it was and so the spirit of god
[14:39] of course chose this city as the one
[14:43] containing the spiritual elements
[14:48] spiritual elements in it
[14:51] see by the fourth age because
[14:54] of its religion
[14:58] well you must understand
[15:02] that the major religion of
[15:05] thyatira was the worship
[15:10] of apollo try mianos
[15:14] they worship the god apollo
[15:19] and this was united
[15:23] with the emperor worship cult
[15:26] they also worship their leader they
[15:29] worship the one who was the leader of
[15:32] the country
[15:33] and that was a a cult to the
[15:37] god apollo
[15:40] and of course apollo was the
[15:44] s u n god he was the
[15:47] sun god here we go again here comes the
[15:51] sun god in opposition to the
[15:55] s o n of god and we differentiate
[15:59] between the two
[16:01] all right now he
[16:04] apollo the s-u-n god
[16:08] was supposedly in a form of a trinity
[16:11] where he was the second figure
[16:15] of that mythological
[16:18] trinity that they made up
[16:22] he was second to zeus
[16:25] zeus who they claimed
[16:28] was his father okay
[16:33] and of course he was known as the
[16:35] averter of
[16:36] evil and he presided
[16:39] over religious law you know as we
[16:43] believe in jesus the word comes from him
[16:45] and so this apollo was supposed to be
[16:49] the one
[16:50] from which their religious laws flowed
[16:53] from
[16:54] a total impersonation of the truth
[16:58] but here it is he also was the one to
[17:02] dispense
[17:04] expiation which is to say forgiveness of
[17:07] sins
[17:07] forgiveness of mistakes forgiveness of
[17:10] your
[17:11] wrong he was to be the one to make
[17:14] amends for
[17:15] for your for anyone's guilt or wrong
[17:19] doing from this of course you you can
[17:21] think on that comes their confessionary
[17:24] and so on and so on and confessing to
[17:27] priests of of that nature but
[17:30] praise god forevermore brother sister
[17:34] i want to tell you that this is the
[17:36] truth
[17:37] from the word of god now plato
[17:41] said it this way he explains to men
[17:45] the institution of temples sacrifices
[17:50] services to deities rights
[17:54] connected with death
[17:57] and the after life
[18:00] he also communicated his
[18:04] knowledge and he did this
[18:07] communicated his knowledge of the future
[18:10] and his father's will
[18:12] to men doing it through profits
[18:17] and through oracles
[18:20] my friends doing it by oracles
[18:25] now know this here in
[18:29] this ritual the ritual of
[18:32] contacting apollo was
[18:35] done by a prophetess
[18:39] and her name was called
[18:42] jezebel how significant
[18:47] when you think of who jezebel was
[18:50] in her bible in the old testament
[18:54] but that is to come we will take study
[18:57] on that
[18:58] later on but here she was
[19:03] jezebel who claimed that she was a
[19:07] prophetess
[19:09] and like a type again
[19:12] she sits ruling in the church
[19:16] on a three-legged chair
[19:19] a tripod this is the foundation of
[19:23] denominationalism
[19:25] this is the foundation of mystery
[19:28] babylon the mother of harlots
[19:30] with the tree two-legged
[19:33] chair of the trinitarian
[19:37] doctrine that is contrary
[19:41] to the original word of god
[19:45] here we see again in the word
[19:48] she delivered messages while she was
[19:52] under a spell of enchantment
[19:55] she went into trances
[19:59] and she would deliver these messages
[20:03] from the god apollo
[20:08] but let me say the grip
[20:11] of this false religion
[20:15] was very strong upon the people
[20:18] of that day and time
[20:22] its power was formidable
[20:26] and there my friends you had to
[20:32] you had to believe or you would have
[20:36] no way to strive in that society
[20:39] of that time for they
[20:43] systematically set it in such a way
[20:49] for some to remain poor if they believed
[20:53] on jesus christ
[20:55] and followed the way of the word and the
[20:58] true church
[21:00] and for others to grow filthy
[21:03] rich
[21:03] [Music]
[21:06] by joining themselves
[21:10] to jezebel in her tripod chair
[21:13] and her set up of
[21:17] the economic and commercial and
[21:20] educational
[21:21] systems of that day
[21:24] we should reflect whether that does we
[21:27] see
[21:27] many of the same things in our day
[21:31] and in our time now
[21:34] of course her power did not rest
[21:37] exclusively in the realm
[21:41] of the mystery behind
[21:45] her religion but it also
[21:48] lay in the fact that no
[21:51] one could belong to the
[21:56] gills these orders
[21:59] corporations that you could not belong
[22:03] to one of them
[22:05] unless you first submitted
[22:09] to belong to the temple of
[22:12] apollo and to come under
[22:16] the woman jezebel and her leadership
[22:22] and anyone who refused to join with them
[22:28] and to be with them in their so-called
[22:31] religious
[22:32] feasts idolatrous
[22:36] feasts that they had at that time
[22:40] and their lawless
[22:43] lewd or licentious
[22:47] uh orgies
[22:51] that they would have at that
[22:54] particular time you would be
[22:57] barred if you did not join in with them
[23:01] be barred from the unions barred from
[23:04] making
[23:04] a really good way of life or living
[23:08] you'd be kept away so in order to be
[23:12] a intrica to be in the social
[23:16] and economic commercial life
[23:21] of that that that nation
[23:24] that city you had to be
[23:28] a practicing pagan
[23:31] idolater along with the rest of them
[23:35] then the church would help you
[23:39] then the third tyrion priestess
[23:43] and the priests below her would help you
[23:47] if not you were on the outside
[23:51] and any scraps may fall your way
[23:54] like the beggar at the rich man's table
[23:58] there it is
[24:02] most uh striking
[24:06] and most direct
[24:09] this sayacira the word the name
[24:14] thyatira actually means
[24:18] dominating female
[24:22] thus we find this age
[24:25] is characterized by
[24:29] denominate dominating
[24:32] females of course we know
[24:35] a woman types the church
[24:39] it will seem at one woman as if i'm
[24:42] speaking
[24:43] of women in general
[24:46] but i'm also speaking of
[24:49] the church the modern church that is in
[24:53] the world today
[24:54] so i'm speaking with a two-pronged
[24:57] effect here
[24:59] that you may see through the darkness
[25:03] and catch the glimpses of light
[25:06] or lightning coming off of the throne
[25:10] of almighty god
[25:13] yes we find
[25:16] that as a dominating force
[25:20] she would invade all
[25:24] areas of life
[25:28] conquering all and despotically and
[25:33] domineeringly control wherever she can
[25:36] control
[25:38] let me say according to god's servant
[25:41] and prophet quote
[25:44] a dominating female
[25:47] is the greatest curse in the world
[25:51] of course to repeat it the
[25:55] worst the world's greatest curse
[25:59] is a dominating female
[26:03] of course the wisest man that we know in
[26:07] this world
[26:09] was solomon the judgment of solomon is
[26:12] revered
[26:14] solomon said i applied my heart to know
[26:18] and to search and to seek
[26:21] out and the reason
[26:25] of things and to know
[26:28] the wickedness of folly
[26:31] even of foolishness and of
[26:35] madness and i find
[26:39] more bitter than death
[26:42] the woman whose heart
[26:45] is snares and nets
[26:49] and her hands are as bands
[26:53] see who so pleased god
[26:57] shall escape from her now of course he's
[27:00] speaking of a
[27:01] natural woman but this is speaking to
[27:04] us also typing denominationalism
[27:08] speaking of the control and and
[27:11] and and the whole the place upon the
[27:14] people
[27:16] oh let us read the scriptures but the
[27:19] sinner
[27:21] the sinners shall be taken by her
[27:25] behold this i have found
[27:29] see at the preacher counting one by one
[27:34] to find out the account which yet
[27:37] my soul secret but i find not
[27:42] one man amongst a thousand have i
[27:47] but found woman among all those
[27:51] i have not found you'll find this
[27:54] scripture
[27:54] in ecclesiastes chapter 7 verses 25
[27:59] to 28. of course
[28:04] the great apostle paul has said to us
[28:09] most clearly and authoritatively
[28:14] for he said not i what i am telling you
[28:18] now
[28:19] is not me just me paul speaking
[28:23] these things are the commandments or the
[28:27] word
[28:27] of the lord in other words this is
[28:30] just said the lord paul said
[28:35] i suffered not a woman
[28:39] to teach or to
[28:43] serp authority
[28:46] oh my friends that is in your bible
[28:51] from the very garden of eden
[28:54] onward the
[28:58] spirit of woman evil
[29:01] woman placed there by the serpent
[29:06] has constantly and successfully
[29:10] tried to take control over man
[29:14] amen and even today
[29:18] we find it's this has become a woman's
[29:21] world
[29:23] uh where in actual fact
[29:26] men appear like ahab to be sitting in
[29:29] the throne and in the places of power
[29:32] but really it's that little woman behind
[29:35] the scenes
[29:36] that actually pulls the strings
[29:40] and moves those so-called
[29:43] mighty men so we find in the world today
[29:48] has become a
[29:49] woman's world and the modern day
[29:53] gods of money
[29:57] the modern day goddesses
[30:00] the beautiful women so called
[30:04] of hollywood not the holy words of god
[30:08] but hollywood and so-called
[30:12] fallen stars from the presence of
[30:16] almighty god
[30:18] making their goddesses this
[30:21] modern wicked corrupt and perverted
[30:24] age naked women
[30:27] we you we would say half dressed
[30:31] but now it's come down to total lewdness
[30:35] an absolute nakedness and as
[30:38] prophesied by the prophet of
[30:42] malachi 4 5 it will come to pass
[30:46] he said he saw it in the vision
[30:49] women dancing loudly
[30:52] with nothing but a fig leaf in front of
[30:55] them
[30:56] oh god have mercy if it's not
[31:00] fully yet here it's partially here
[31:03] it is on the way it's
[31:06] almost here run for your life samson
[31:10] run amen flee into christ
[31:14] amen flee into the word of god for
[31:17] safety and for deliverance lord of god
[31:21] amen yes sir i want you to know my
[31:25] friends
[31:27] that a woman of course
[31:31] it's not meant to be a dominating
[31:34] person she's made with a
[31:38] feminine spirit a female
[31:41] spirit which is different to the male
[31:44] spirit and you can see it from
[31:48] childhood the difference the spirit
[31:52] in a boy to the spirit in a girl
[31:56] spirit in the mail and the attitude and
[31:59] spirit
[31:59] in the female women were not
[32:03] made to be dominating let me say
[32:06] something here but the devil in his
[32:10] satanic eden
[32:11] of today has shaped the society
[32:16] to push and press women into certain
[32:20] situations
[32:22] where they have to be aggressive
[32:26] or they they're pushed out of the
[32:28] society
[32:30] or they can't make any grounds they
[32:32] can't gain anything
[32:33] now i'm not saying that's right or
[32:35] that's good but the devil has created
[32:38] the
[32:39] atmosphere where some women can
[32:42] not make it unless they become
[32:46] aggressive
[32:47] and begin to act like a man
[32:51] oh my friends a woman was not made to be
[32:55] that way
[32:57] you were not made to be that way
[33:00] you were made to be a lady a real
[33:04] woman to have the feminine
[33:07] spirit which the scripture says
[33:11] it's submissive to the male
[33:15] and this is commanded by the word of god
[33:18] to her
[33:20] a woman of course who is truly female
[33:23] all-female will be of that kind
[33:27] of a submission
[33:30] but listen when i speak of a woman
[33:33] being humble and submissive to her
[33:36] husband
[33:38] for the bible says you're not submissive
[33:40] just to
[33:41] everybody but to your own husband
[33:45] amen now listen that
[33:48] woman now speaking to men is not
[33:51] supposed to be a dishrag
[33:53] or a doormat it doesn't mean that
[33:57] but you who are strong should have
[34:00] love understanding and pity
[34:04] and be able to help
[34:08] straighten and walk with such a one
[34:12] such a woman whom the bible says she is
[34:15] placed
[34:15] as i help meet she is not placed as a
[34:19] doormat
[34:20] and so we must love them and take care
[34:24] of them
[34:24] protect them provide for them
[34:28] and let them know that they are under
[34:31] your shelter your protection and by
[34:35] god's grace his direction through you
[34:38] with them amen yes sir
[34:42] but what do we find
[34:45] is that they want to dominate over the
[34:47] mail
[34:50] and no real female wants to dominate her
[34:54] husband
[34:56] when a woman marries a man she wants a
[34:58] real
[34:59] man as i've said before not a mango
[35:04] not a mouse not a not a tobacco
[35:07] leaf that moves with the wind not a
[35:11] piece of chocolate that will melt with
[35:13] the heat of trouble or trial
[35:15] but some someone that will stand like a
[35:18] rock
[35:19] and be a gentle man amen
[35:22] a man but a man that knows how to be
[35:25] gentle
[35:27] at the same time he knows how to be firm
[35:29] and
[35:30] when to be firm he's not aggressive he's
[35:33] not growling and
[35:34] grumpy all the time but he knows
[35:37] when this is supposed to be
[35:42] no of course the one she wants to
[35:45] rule over the mail when he is supposed
[35:49] to be head of the household
[35:51] uh uh how could that be and the worst
[35:55] curse in this world repeat
[36:01] is a woman that wants to dominate
[36:04] over men or to act
[36:08] or be like man
[36:11] a woman like that is the worst
[36:15] imitation or impersonation
[36:19] of what it means to be a man and they
[36:22] will
[36:22] never be able to do it let's just make
[36:26] themselves to be a laughingstock
[36:30] and trying to act that way before them
[36:35] they will have the impression that
[36:36] they're taken seriously
[36:40] but behind them it's another matter
[36:42] because a man
[36:43] knows a real man and he also recognizes
[36:48] who and what is a woman
[36:52] now when a woman breaks that image
[36:56] that god made for her
[36:59] she is perverted she has perverted from
[37:03] the true will
[37:05] and way of god and any man that lets a
[37:09] woman take authority over him
[37:12] tie him like a string around her
[37:15] finger like that my friends
[37:18] then we find out that he is perverted
[37:22] in that way if he would allow that
[37:25] and that is why the bible tells us in
[37:28] the book of deuteronomy
[37:32] that she should not wear
[37:35] the clothing or that which pertain it
[37:39] to a man or in the new testament
[37:43] the bible tells us she should not cut
[37:47] off her well hair don't want to go into
[37:50] this but in the old testament a woman
[37:53] cuts off her hair that's like a
[37:54] she's telling the world she becomes a
[37:56] harlot
[37:58] and now you know they bring it into all
[38:01] manner of styles and everything else
[38:03] until it becomes it's okay just cut off
[38:05] your hair do whatever you want
[38:07] it's your life your world and you do
[38:09] whatever you want
[38:11] right and that's the way it has become
[38:13] but that is
[38:14] not the word of god the word of god
[38:17] tells you
[38:18] the woman's hair is her glory amen
[38:21] hallelujah and she should not cut it off
[38:25] amen and the opposite to the man of
[38:28] course
[38:28] that the man is supposed to cut his hair
[38:31] to show that he is not
[38:33] under any other person's
[38:36] man's or woman's authority amen
[38:40] but he should be clean shaven and oh
[38:43] praise god forevermore
[38:45] so she is never to wear the garments
[38:50] that even pertains or looks male
[38:54] she is not to do it and she's not to cut
[38:58] off her hair
[39:01] and she's not to intrude into male
[39:04] authority one time
[39:09] i was confronted by a so-called
[39:12] woman preacher who said to me i heard
[39:17] that you teach that what no woman
[39:21] should preach in the pulpit i said yes
[39:24] ma'am
[39:26] she said how dare you for a
[39:29] you know a woman prophesied in the book
[39:32] of acts
[39:33] philips daughters prophesied in the book
[39:35] of acts and she start
[39:37] to bring all these various things how
[39:39] jesus spoke to the woman and
[39:41] she ran and told the disciples how he
[39:44] has risen
[39:45] so a woman can preach and so on i said
[39:49] well
[39:49] you may say that you may even quote
[39:52] those scriptures
[39:53] but the great apostle paul
[39:56] on the inspiration said she shall
[40:00] not teach she shall not teach
[40:03] nor she should not usurp
[40:08] authority she said well my husband is
[40:11] right here
[40:12] and and and i am the preacher of that
[40:14] church and he i said well
[40:16] he may be here and you may
[40:19] claim you are the preacher and you may
[40:22] even be a better preacher
[40:24] it is not a matter of your talent it's
[40:26] not a matter of your ability
[40:28] it's not a matter if you're able to do
[40:30] it you you
[40:31] you're able to have that kind of talent
[40:34] but
[40:34] god is saying if you're going to be
[40:37] obedient to him and follow his word
[40:39] she shall not teach i said the reason
[40:43] why
[40:44] is because teaching presupposes
[40:48] that the one that is teaching has some
[40:50] authority
[40:52] over those that are receiving the
[40:54] teaching
[40:55] and she shall not teach and you shall
[40:58] not preach
[40:59] according to this word of the living god
[41:02] now of course i couldn't go into all of
[41:04] the reasons
[41:06] other reasons that are clearly in the
[41:08] word of god and that is a topic in
[41:10] itself
[41:11] that we will discuss as time goes by
[41:16] but of course she got angry and mad and
[41:20] carry like that you know women calling
[41:22] themselves
[41:23] deaconess this and deaconess that and uh
[41:26] calling themselves missionary this and
[41:28] missionary that
[41:29] i said well a woman can testify
[41:32] when it says teach there it's not
[41:35] talking about teaching your kids
[41:37] it's not talking about talk teaching in
[41:40] sunday school
[41:42] it's talking about getting up and
[41:44] presenting yourself
[41:45] as a teacher of the word
[41:48] as a minister the minister of the word
[41:51] of god
[41:52] no the word of god says she shall
[41:56] not teach nor your serp authority
[41:59] amen over any such
[42:03] position amen praise god hallelujah
[42:07] and so we find help here today we have
[42:11] an age where women have invaded the
[42:14] pulpit
[42:16] and that is a perversion of the word of
[42:18] god
[42:19] but they're not supposed to be there in
[42:22] the first place
[42:24] but to be in submission to the word
[42:28] and i'm saying that because i'm thinking
[42:30] the church
[42:32] ought to be in submission to jesus
[42:35] christ the male
[42:36] the head who is the word which is a
[42:40] symbol
[42:41] of the woman to be in submission
[42:44] to the male but as i said before
[42:48] that male will treat her with the
[42:51] greatest love like jesus treated us
[42:54] and treats us with the love and
[42:57] protection
[42:58] that he is willing to let down his life
[43:00] for us
[43:02] that kind of a love that will never die
[43:05] will last forever oh praise god the
[43:09] bible says and loving his own
[43:11] he loved them to the very end oh glory
[43:15] to
[43:15] god amen may the great holy spirit
[43:19] show you what i'm talking about amen
[43:22] this is commanded
[43:24] and it's something that believing
[43:28] sisters and even unbelieving women
[43:31] if they have any uh reasonable sense to
[43:35] them
[43:36] they will obey the word of god they will
[43:39] obey even
[43:40] nature what nature tells them
[43:44] in that way a woman is never to do that
[43:48] and to take authority perverting herself
[43:52] and vetting the pulpit
[43:55] like that she must not do it
[43:59] but stay with the word of god
[44:02] when she does it she shows what kind of
[44:05] a spirit
[44:06] she is really got on her and that spirit
[44:10] is nothing but an
[44:12] anti-christ anti-war
[44:14] spirit that is upon a woman like that
[44:17] that may
[44:18] get angry and fuming even as i'm
[44:22] speaking on a topic of this nature oh
[44:25] my i've had some get up and walk out in
[44:29] a huff and a
[44:30] puff like a like a frog bullfrog with
[44:33] their faces
[44:34] all made up angry because they are
[44:36] hearing the word of god
[44:38] the way they should hear it medicine
[44:41] that you should take
[44:43] you don't like it but it's medicine that
[44:45] you ought to
[44:46] take it drink it it will purge you and
[44:49] make you
[44:50] good make you healthy make your whole
[44:53] and get all that
[44:54] uh denominational and worldly nonsense
[44:58] that's been placed lodged into you the
[45:01] word of god is here to root it out and
[45:04] take it out from you
[45:05] and make you into the beautiful lovely
[45:08] creature
[45:09] you are supposed to be according to this
[45:12] word
[45:12] of god which says let god be true
[45:18] and every man's word
[45:21] a lie yes sir
[45:25] the seeds of that false
[45:28] catholic church buried in her
[45:33] to rebel against her husband
[45:36] the word fight against the word
[45:40] do everything to rebel against it
[45:44] but a real woman will obey the word of
[45:47] god
[45:48] but in the beginning it was not
[45:51] so amen
[45:55] in the beginning god created them bought
[45:58] male and female
[46:01] we won't talk about adam and steve
[46:05] because we know that god only made adam
[46:09] and eve now my friends
[46:12] here we find that god made them male
[46:16] and female he made the rooster and the
[46:19] hand
[46:20] the duck and the drake the cow
[46:23] and the bull and so on but when it came
[46:28] to man god
[46:31] the bible says created only one
[46:34] he only created adam there's nowhere
[46:37] you'll find the scriptures that at the
[46:39] same time
[46:40] he created male and female
[46:44] he created adam
[46:47] and then out of adam
[46:52] god took a by-product or a part of
[46:56] adam that's why when a man
[46:59] finds his true mate and they come back
[47:01] to being
[47:02] one amen it's just like
[47:06] eve was separated from adam that he
[47:08] could ever make
[47:10] and then the end just like the church
[47:14] we have been separated from the lord
[47:16] jesus
[47:17] but in the end when he calls us back we
[47:20] are going
[47:21] right back to him and we will have a
[47:23] complete total
[47:25] oneness with god and in god
[47:28] one with him again a praise
[47:32] god hallelujah amen so
[47:35] when the woman stepped out
[47:40] she was a
[47:44] byproduct from the original creation
[47:49] we are by products of the original
[47:53] world and have been brought here
[47:56] on the scene that is why we are in flesh
[48:01] because we are in type the weak
[48:04] part of the word that
[48:07] is subject to temptation as
[48:11] eve was subject to temptation
[48:15] also it's all in the types
[48:18] like that and so she
[48:21] also was vastly different
[48:25] from the other females that god had
[48:28] placed
[48:29] upon the earth because
[48:32] we find out she could be seduced
[48:38] these other females could not be really
[48:41] seduced
[48:43] and the reason for that that is because
[48:46] god
[48:47] set times and
[48:50] seasons for them to come
[48:53] into a specific mating season
[48:58] some month some year someday
[49:02] like that but with this
[49:05] by-product it was different
[49:09] with this woman this by-product it was
[49:13] different
[49:14] she was made different so
[49:17] she could be like that at any time
[49:22] until the time of life
[49:26] her time of life has passed away from
[49:28] her
[49:30] then no more but during that span that
[49:34] she has
[49:35] she is absolutely different from all the
[49:37] other females
[49:39] that god made who has set times and
[49:41] seasons
[49:42] making seasons that he set but the time
[49:45] for mating for a
[49:47] natural woman at any time
[49:50] as we can see with just common sense
[49:54] and this is the weakness
[49:58] that satan saw that he
[50:01] that uh and allowed him to be able to
[50:04] attempt
[50:06] and to seduce her
[50:09] amen and so my friends
[50:13] we see clearly in the word of god
[50:16] the fulfillment of scripture
[50:19] because here we see
[50:22] that then an evil woman
[50:27] becomes a picture of a picture of
[50:30] vulgarity
[50:32] looseness foulness lewdness
[50:36] licentiousness on one hand
[50:40] she's looked upon something filthy and
[50:43] dirty
[50:44] evil but on the other hand
[50:48] a good woman is looked upon
[50:52] as the thing of of cleanliness
[50:56] a thing of beauty amen
[50:59] a thing that is a symbol of holiness
[51:03] and a receptacle for the holy spirit
[51:08] amen look on one hand
[51:11] that false woman church
[51:15] is called a harlot
[51:19] drunken with the blood of the saints
[51:22] and a drinking from a cup of
[51:25] fornications
[51:27] so she's a harlot she's a drunkard and
[51:29] she's a fornicator
[51:31] according to the word of god this evil
[51:35] woman a type of evil women
[51:38] here we find satan made her
[51:41] that way satan influencer
[51:44] to have that kind of a record
[51:47] of harlotry drunkenness and
[51:51] fornications oh god have mercy
[51:55] so on one hand you see
[51:58] the woman evil becomes that way
[52:04] on the other hand the woman accepts
[52:07] the word of god and she's considered the
[52:11] bride of christ
[52:12] hallelujah on one hand
[52:16] the what god calls her mystery babylon
[52:19] mother of harlots the abomination
[52:23] before god and she's on the other
[52:26] hand the good woman that believes the
[52:29] word the true church
[52:31] is called the new jerusalem
[52:34] the mother above hallelujah
[52:37] on one hand we look again this evil
[52:41] woman
[52:43] is seen as foul and wicked and
[52:46] lewd to the word of god
[52:50] and she will be cast into the lake
[52:54] of fire because that's the only fit
[52:57] place to put her she's not locked away
[53:01] in that lake of fire
[53:03] then she'll be running the streets and
[53:05] running the bars and
[53:06] running the bat dance everywhere my
[53:09] friends
[53:10] the only way is for god to place her
[53:13] there
[53:14] but thank god the good woman that holds
[53:17] to the word of god
[53:18] our place the bible says is in heaven
[53:21] for in my father's house
[53:23] there are many mansions if it were not
[53:26] so
[53:27] i would have told you amen
[53:31] so one is sent to hell the bride of
[53:34] satan
[53:36] oh the bride of the so-called
[53:40] jesus part of the spiritual frankenstein
[53:43] a man made up of little pieces little
[53:46] denominations their denomination
[53:48] patchwork together
[53:49] to make this beast this misra babylon
[53:53] the art we're living in but the other
[53:56] one the good woman the true church
[53:59] she's exalted to heaven glory to god
[54:02] and she is in her fitting place to sit
[54:06] beside the word
[54:08] as a part of the word and to be the
[54:11] queen in the presence of almighty god
[54:14] the true queen
[54:15] glory to god amen so back to our subject
[54:19] in this manner
[54:22] this age speaks
[54:26] to the fact of dominating females
[54:31] and that she is mystery babylon
[54:35] she is the great
[54:38] of revelation she is
[54:42] jezebel
[54:45] promoting herself as a prophetess
[54:48] who speaks for god when god says she
[54:52] shall not teach nor usurp authority
[54:55] why because the true female spirit
[55:00] is submissive to god
[55:03] and his word for he is the head
[55:07] and the headship of the body and she has
[55:10] no
[55:11] word but his word no thoughts but his
[55:13] thoughts
[55:14] praise god hallelujah his no leadership
[55:17] but his leadership
[55:19] amen or praise god but what about this
[55:22] false church
[55:24] what has she done she cast out the word
[55:27] just like many will kick out and kick
[55:29] away their husband
[55:31] oh cast out the word amen
[55:34] all my friends destroy bibles
[55:38] burn bibles burn
[55:42] prophets burn apostles burn holy men and
[55:46] holy women
[55:48] at the stake burn them
[55:51] kill them destroy them in every way
[55:55] slain many amen
[55:59] put in prison and persecute
[56:03] laws that teach the truth of god's word
[56:08] and take it even further put many of
[56:11] them to death
[56:13] because they reject her trinitarian
[56:16] doctrine
[56:17] and her way of walking yes
[56:21] she has lots of power she controlled
[56:24] presidents
[56:26] emperors governors judges
[56:30] she controls all kinds of political
[56:33] powers
[56:34] armies princes nations amen
[56:38] while insisting that she is the true
[56:41] body
[56:42] of jesus christ but my friends
[56:45] she's been seduced by the devil
[56:48] amen she's accepted for her leadership
[56:53] vikers of christ so-called popes
[56:57] so-called cardinals and bishops
[57:00] where all my friends all
[57:03] turned away from god's word seduced by
[57:07] the devil
[57:08] and she in turn is telling the same lie
[57:11] they
[57:12] told her and seducing others
[57:15] into idolatry in every possible way
[57:19] become the pride of satan producing
[57:23] nothing but bastard born children
[57:26] to the word of god they are not of the
[57:30] word they are
[57:31] not children of the word but she is
[57:33] making that claim to christ
[57:36] that they are his children and he is
[57:38] saying no
[57:39] because they do not conform to
[57:43] my word their bastard born
[57:46] to the word of god so here we have these
[57:50] so-called uh denominational religions
[57:53] contrary to the word of god claiming
[57:56] that they are the children of god
[57:58] they are sons and daughters of god but
[58:01] living contrary
[58:02] to his word amen yes friends
[58:06] she has dominated through the dark ages
[58:11] hundreds of years over 900 years
[58:15] she has plundered
[58:18] she has persecuted
[58:21] jailed killed burnt at the stake
[58:26] amen kill out the arts
[58:29] and the sciences killed out
[58:32] all manner of of of
[58:36] natural excellence she has destroyed
[58:40] but this is our way she killed the
[58:42] prophets
[58:44] killed the patriarchs and the prophets
[58:47] killed holy men and then shall turn
[58:50] around
[58:52] dig their bodies up and then deem them
[58:55] as saints
[58:56] they were already made holy by god they
[58:59] were already prophets of god
[59:01] they were already god anointed man
[59:03] doesn't need anybody to raise them up
[59:06] dig them out of their graves put them
[59:09] into a into a beautiful place and then
[59:12] they're going to raise them and say we
[59:13] are for the arts we are for the sciences
[59:16] we are for this but in the original they
[59:19] killed it they'll kill those who would
[59:22] create
[59:23] plain submarines uh helicopters and
[59:26] everything else then
[59:27] later on they praised them as if they
[59:30] were originated from them always the
[59:34] case
[59:35] my friends and they produced nothing but
[59:38] death until the very light of the truth
[59:43] was almost entirely gone
[59:46] and only a barely a sliver of light
[59:49] remain the oil
[59:53] and the wane of god almost ceased to
[59:56] flow in that day
[59:58] but god promised he would never leave
[1:00:00] himself
[1:00:02] without a witness and though she
[1:00:05] dominated
[1:00:06] all the world kingdoms and demanded
[1:00:09] of all men pay a
[1:00:13] homage and respects to her
[1:00:18] there was one little group
[1:00:21] no matter how much she boiled no matter
[1:00:23] how much she
[1:00:24] burned no matter not she jailed no
[1:00:27] matter how much she put in prison
[1:00:29] no matter how she persecuted they would
[1:00:32] not bend they would not boil their will
[1:00:35] not
[1:00:36] burn but they'll stand by the word of
[1:00:39] god
[1:00:39] and hold to god's unchanging hand amen
[1:00:43] and god kept his little flock
[1:00:46] amen yes sir and this
[1:00:50] so-called church of rome
[1:00:54] was just as heathen a screen
[1:00:57] italia in the old testament
[1:01:01] who tried to destroy all of the royal
[1:01:05] seed that was in her day and she almost
[1:01:09] succeeded
[1:01:11] but god reserved one god hid
[1:01:15] one and kept that little one away from
[1:01:19] her
[1:01:19] oh thank god amen and
[1:01:22] he was faithful and so in this art day
[1:01:27] god has preserved and is preserving
[1:01:31] a little flock protecting them
[1:01:35] watching out for them putting a shield
[1:01:38] around them
[1:01:39] he is their rock their soul sword
[1:01:42] their shield he is their full
[1:01:45] armor to unseen harmon to protect them
[1:01:49] hallelujah and so god
[1:01:52] is preserving his little flock
[1:01:57] through this long dark night
[1:02:01] this loud deceit night of darkness
[1:02:05] all might and we know
[1:02:08] he preserved them through the thyatira
[1:02:12] night and out of that god began to raise
[1:02:16] up
[1:02:18] raise the rising of the sun the peeping
[1:02:22] out
[1:02:22] of the sunlight through the ministry
[1:02:26] of martin luther of whom we shall speak
[1:02:29] on
[1:02:29] later and anyone who knows
[1:02:33] anything about this pagan church
[1:02:36] who claims christianity but is a
[1:02:40] perversion of the word of god
[1:02:43] anyone who knows their form of worship
[1:02:46] can tell
[1:02:47] why the city of saiathirah
[1:02:50] was chosen by the holy spirit to
[1:02:53] represent
[1:02:54] what he will say and what he would do
[1:02:58] in the dark ages that was ahead
[1:03:02] of them and now this is all
[1:03:05] made manifest and it's unfolding before
[1:03:08] us
[1:03:09] and in our modern times it's right
[1:03:12] before
