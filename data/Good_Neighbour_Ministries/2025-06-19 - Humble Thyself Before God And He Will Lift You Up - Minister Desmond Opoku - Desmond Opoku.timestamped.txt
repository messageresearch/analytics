[19:44] And they crucify him
[19:47] and parded his garment casting lots that
[19:51] it might be fulfilled which was spoken
[19:54] by the prophet.
[19:56] They padded my garments among them, and
[20:00] upon my vesture did they cast lots. And
[20:04] sitting down they watch him there, and
[20:08] set up over his head his accusation,
[20:12] written, "This is Jesus, the king of the
[20:15] Jews."
[20:18] Then were there two thieves crucified
[20:21] with him, one of the right hand and
[20:25] another on the left.
[20:28] And they that passed by receive him,
[20:31] wiggling their heads,
[20:34] and saying,
[20:36] Thou that destroy the temple, and
[20:40] buildeth it in three days, save thyself.
[20:45] If thou be the son of God, come down
[20:48] from the cross. Like also the chief
[20:51] priest, mock him with the scribes and
[20:55] elders said, he save others himself he
[21:00] cannot save.
[21:02] If he be the king of Israel, let him now
[21:06] come down from the cross
[21:10] and we will believe him. Wow.
[21:18] He trustth in God. Let him deliver him.
[21:22] Now
[21:24] if you if he would have him, for he
[21:29] said, "I am the son of God."
[21:32] The thieves also which were crucified
[21:35] with him cast
[21:38] the same
[21:40] in the teeth. Now from the fifth hour
[21:46] there was darkness over all the land
[21:49] unto the 9inth hour.
[21:53] And about the 9inth hour Jesus cried
[21:56] with a loud voice saying Eli
[22:02] that is to say my God my God why hast
[22:06] thou forsaken me?
[22:08] Some of them that stood there when they
[22:12] heard that said, "This man called
[22:16] Elias."
[22:17] And straightway one of them ran and took
[22:21] a sponge and filled it with vinegar and
[22:24] put it on a reed and gave him to drink.
[22:30] The rest said, "Let it let be let us see
[22:34] whether Elas will come and save him.
[22:38] Jesus when he had cried again with a
[22:42] loud voice yelled up the ghost and
[22:46] behold the veil of the temple was rent
[22:51] in twain in the top of the bottom and in
[22:55] the in the and the earth ditch quick and
[23:00] the rocks red. May the Lord add his
[23:03] blessing. You may be seated.
[23:09] Hallelujah.
[23:14] You know
[23:16] it's the same thing today.
[23:20] The people do not understand who God is.
[23:25] You know, the people who mock him wasn't
[23:29] the just normal people walking on the
[23:32] street.
[23:34] It was those people who believe God
[23:38] that mock him.
[23:43] And when the when he yell up the ghost
[23:46] and the earthquake,
[23:48] they found out it's not just a man
[23:53] hanging there, but was God himself.
[23:56] Hallelujah. They begin to tremble.
[24:01] The same thing is going to happen right
[24:03] now. People going to begin to tremble.
[24:07] Hallelujah.
[24:09] Thank you, Lord. Tonight, my message is
[24:14] humble thyself before God and he will
[24:17] lift you up.
[24:20] Humble thyself
[24:22] before God and he will lift you up.
[24:26] Our
[24:29] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ came to
[24:31] earth to save his own.
[24:36] He came to do what? To save his own,
[24:41] not everybody.
[24:44] And the Bible said when he died, what
[24:48] happened?
[24:53] the veil that was in the temple.
[24:58] He granted two pieces.
[25:01] Before that, nobody can go behind.
[25:06] But after he gave up the ghost,
[25:10] everybody can go in.
[25:13] Can go in.
[25:16] So right now the veil is rented.
[25:22] The Lord Jesus Christ in pray
[25:27] the judgment is upon the people.
[25:31] You have a right to accept him
[25:35] being God. Hallelujah.
[25:41] God the creator of universe heaven and
[25:44] earth.
[25:46] If you Genesis
[25:48] 1:1,
[25:55] he was the creator of heaven and earth.
[25:58] Genesis 1:1. And he is the You want me
[26:02] to read it? Let me read it so that you
[26:04] understand what I'm saying here.
[26:09] In the beginning, God created heaven and
[26:12] earth. Who created heaven and earth?
[26:14] God.
[26:16] He created heaven and earth. The same
[26:18] God who came down
[26:24] because of me and you.
[26:27] Amen.
[26:29] Because we were in him before the
[26:32] foundation of this world
[26:35] and a part of him was lost.
[26:39] So he has to come down.
[26:43] You see I as right now
[26:47] when you are here something hurt your
[26:50] finger
[26:51] the whole body feel it. Am I right?
[26:55] So when we
[26:58] we get out from his side to here he
[27:02] found out his son Doris sons and
[27:06] daughters missing. So he has to come
[27:09] down
[27:11] to seek us.
[27:18] He came down
[27:21] duly
[27:24] because of you.
[27:27] He came down.
[27:30] But if you look around this world here,
[27:33] never mind what he did.
[27:36] You see around now, men have became
[27:39] wicked more than ever before.
[27:45] wicked
[27:48] and filth
[27:50] that God you know
[27:53] you know when when the Lord Jesus when
[27:56] God was bringing the Israelite from
[27:58] Egypt
[28:00] they make him so sick he wanted to what
[28:03] kill everybody
[28:06] but he can't we were part of him he is a
[28:11] merciful God,
[28:14] he's a merciful God. If God look this
[28:17] way right now
[28:20] and if is not mercy and the grace, you
[28:24] think we can stay here, the whole earth
[28:27] will be wiped out.
[28:29] See what happened to Sodom?
[28:32] They make him so sick.
[28:36] Why he went there? He went there and
[28:39] destroyed them with binstorm of fire.
[28:44] Is it not the same thing they doing
[28:46] right now?
[28:49] Why is he waiting? Because you and me
[28:53] is waiting till that day
[28:58] when the time come
[29:02] then they will know
[29:04] who God is.
[29:07] Hallelujah.
[29:11] When God call you,
[29:17] don't think God calls you by mistake.
[29:21] You are not sitting here by mistake.
[29:25] You are sitting here because you are his
[29:29] son sons and daughters.
[29:33] You cannot come. You know when he was
[29:36] hanging the cross, you think everybody
[29:40] can go over there and and plead him? No.
[29:44] The same people whom he took their
[29:49] fathers from the Egypt Canaan and
[29:52] brought them Canaan and they believed
[29:55] that they were worshiping God. They were
[29:57] mocking him
[30:00] because they were not part of him. If
[30:03] they if right now
[30:07] if they were part of him they will
[30:09] accept th this message of this hour.
[30:14] This message
[30:17] William was the true prophet of God.
[30:23] God vindicated him.
[30:26] The same people do think
[30:32] when the Lord Jesus Christ was on the
[30:34] cross and the people was walking at him.
[30:38] Let me tell you the same priest today
[30:43] what they doing now if they were there
[30:46] they would do the same thing as the
[30:48] Pharisees and Stri did right there.
[30:51] They did not know him.
[30:55] Hallelujah. So when God calls you, he
[30:58] calls you.
[31:01] You are blessed people sitting every
[31:05] day, every night, every week. You think
[31:08] you came here by yourself? No.
[31:12] God caused you to be here.
[31:19] God knows his anointed children.
[31:26] Don't think
[31:28] you are just a normal people walking in
[31:30] the face of the earth.
[31:34] Peter,
[31:35] Paul,
[31:37] all those people that were sitting
[31:39] there, God called them follow me.
[31:43] They were special people that God chose
[31:46] them that time.
[31:49] The same thing applies to you. You are
[31:51] special people that God chose you right
[31:54] now. Amen. There's no different call
[31:59] that he called them. Come and follow me.
[32:03] The same thing he calls you, he calls
[32:05] you by your heart. Come and follow me.
[32:09] The minister didn't come here to call
[32:12] you to come and sit here.
[32:15] It's God himself calls you.
[32:19] And if if God calls you, there is a work
[32:22] for you to do. Hallelujah.
[32:25] Amen. Glory to God.
[32:34] Hallelujah. I believe God have something
[32:37] special for you.
[32:42] There were publicans that is the
[32:45] outsiders and they were priests. And the
[32:48] Christians, you know
[32:52] how many people are mocking this
[32:54] message?
[32:56] Even the people whom God called, they
[32:59] think God call. You see, if you force
[33:02] yourself to come to God, it's a
[33:05] different story.
[33:08] You cannot stay.
[33:11] If God calls you, he holds your hand.
[33:14] You cannot get out to go. But if you
[33:17] hold God hand, you can take your hand
[33:19] and go somewhere that we want to go.
[33:22] Thank God holds our hand. Hallelujah.
[33:26] He holds our hand. That's why he said
[33:29] whatever I have here, nobody can take it
[33:32] away from my hand. Glory to God.
[33:35] Hallelujah.
[33:37] Let me tell you, we are peer people
[33:40] walking on the face of the earth. You
[33:42] don't think that you're somebody
[33:45] but God, if God is in you,
[33:48] you're more than majority.
[33:51] Hallelujah.
[33:53] Let me tell you, the same anointing
[33:57] that was back there, the same anointing
[34:01] is here today,
[34:03] never change.
[34:05] Come and follow me.
[34:08] Do you think it's easy for them to
[34:10] follow? Well, if you watch those movie,
[34:13] I don't know if he whispers. When Jesus
[34:16] speak, nobody can go speak once.
[34:20] When he speak, you have to get up cuz
[34:23] it's not you. There's something inside
[34:26] here that quicken that's quickenh
[34:30] with that word there. It's the word that
[34:33] calls you. The word of God that calls
[34:35] you. That's right.
[34:37] It's not somebody who witness to you.
[34:40] Because is the word that is in you. When
[34:43] that word quicken what is in you, it
[34:46] right there. What happen? It wakes up.
[34:51] Hallelujah.
[34:52] Spiritual aminesia. Bang. You know when
[34:56] the the the the you ask the sisters who
[34:58] has children
[35:00] when the baby come first, what did they
[35:02] do? Bang.
[35:05] Life come in.
[35:07] Same thing applies to us.
[35:10] Let me tell you when I heard this
[35:13] message
[35:15] I didn't know nothing about it but
[35:17] rather something prick my heart
[35:22] then I begin to ask myself Lord am I too
[35:25] late to surrender my my myself to you
[35:29] inside not I talking I was talking
[35:32] inside with him
[35:36] I ran he think it's me because I came
[35:40] first and I ran. I don't want to come
[35:42] back again.
[35:44] But later because men are stubborn.
[35:49] So later he came back. He didn't come
[35:51] back. He came back and spoke the same
[35:54] word in my heart. And that word
[35:57] quickened my heart. Then I ran
[36:03] before the pastor. I said, "Lord, am I
[36:08] this question here?" I said, "Lord, am I
[36:11] late to surrender myself to thee?
[36:16] Am I late?"
[36:18] I could find I I I I was real. No, I'm
[36:22] not just making up. This is what I said.
[36:25] So, I pack my all my stuff. I hid in my
[36:29] car. Nobody tells me what to do. God
[36:32] told me what to do.
[36:36] Because a sinner you got to be washed
[36:39] before you can come to God. So I came
[36:43] and I brought shorts. That time I don't
[36:46] know nothing. Brother Simon said no come
[36:49] back next week bring proper stuff
[36:53] and wash
[36:55] in the water so that you can sit under
[36:59] the presence of God to grow. Hallelujah.
[37:06] The same way he called them, the same
[37:08] way he called us, the same Holy Ghost
[37:11] that was upon them, the same Holy Ghost
[37:13] is on you right now. Never change.
[37:19] But human being sometime we are so
[37:24] stubborn.
[37:26] That's why I said humble thyself in the
[37:29] presence of the Lord and you what he
[37:32] will lift you up.
[37:37] If you force a fruit
[37:40] to ripe always sour, you never get
[37:43] sweetness from that fruit. But if that
[37:47] fruit stay
[37:49] on the tree and ripe
[37:52] at a ripe environment, you take that
[37:57] fruit and you eat it, you feel it, the
[38:00] sweetness and the juice that is inside
[38:03] the sweet that that fruit. So do you.
[38:08] You stay in the presence of God. You
[38:12] humble yourself to stay in the presence
[38:14] of God. You will ripe and the sweetness
[38:18] of God will spring forth through you.
[38:20] Hallelujah.
[38:22] Glory to God. Amen. Hallelujah.
[38:26] Do not rush yourself. Humble thyself
[38:30] before God.
[38:32] And God will lift you up each and
[38:35] everyone. God is going to use us.
[38:39] He didn't call us. You got to say it's
[38:42] me.
[38:45] Is there anything too hard for God?
[38:49] You sitting down here you think oh poor
[38:52] me you have been in the church so long
[38:54] sometime the minister preach I can't
[38:56] understand I have so much mistake. God
[38:58] doesn't care about your mistake. He
[39:00] calls you. He knows your time. He's the
[39:04] he know the time that he going to use
[39:06] you. You are a tool that is in the box.
[39:12] Hallelujah.
[39:14] When every time God need that he go when
[39:18] God need something he go to that tool
[39:20] box pick up that tool and use it.
[39:24] Hallelujah.
[39:26] And you cannot use the tools all the
[39:29] tools at the same time. One by one. One
[39:32] by one. And the job will be done
[39:35] perfectly.
[39:36] Glory to God. Stay in the presence of
[39:39] God and shine.
[39:42] God never loses his power.
[39:46] Oh, God is so sweet.
[39:49] That's why the song writer sing
[39:52] so sweet to trust in Jesus. Hallelujah.
[39:57] If I know how to sing, I will sing and
[40:00] dance and jump right here now. God
[40:02] didn't give you thy voice, but he give
[40:05] you a powerful voice that I can I can
[40:07] kick devil out. Hallelujah.
[40:11] Everybody has their own thing. Somebody
[40:12] can use a song and kick the devil out.
[40:15] And somebody can use his powerful voice
[40:17] and kick the devil out. Each and
[40:20] everyone is a tool that God can pick it
[40:23] up anytime that you need. Amen. Don't
[40:26] think you're not important, you young
[40:28] people. Hallelujah. God has something
[40:30] for you to do. Have patient in the in
[40:33] the presence of God and get ripe.
[40:36] Hallelujah.
[40:38] Everybody has their own position.
[40:41] Glory to God. Amen.
[40:46] Thank you, Lord.
[40:51] The Holy Spirit
[40:54] is in the church using
[40:57] men and women.
[41:00] Don't think you're a woman so you cannot
[41:05] stand on the pulpit to preach.
[41:09] Every one of us has their own position
[41:15] and own time when God going to use you.
[41:22] You know, even don't think I have no
[41:26] education.
[41:28] I don't speak English. God doesn't care
[41:31] about your English or Spanish or
[41:34] African.
[41:36] God can speak any language.
[41:40] God can send you to way down in the
[41:42] jungle.
[41:44] Why? Why do you think God speak the God
[41:47] make people make his people speak in
[41:50] tong then people understand who
[41:52] understand speaking nobody understand
[41:55] only God understand they speak and he
[41:58] interpret for the people
[42:01] it's not a it's is a gift
[42:05] that God
[42:07] has for his people for the time to use
[42:11] he will use it.
[42:14] Hallelujah. It's not abusing. How's the
[42:18] other church is abusing?
[42:21] Make it so common and and and you don't.
[42:25] Hallelujah.
[42:30] God
[42:32] is in his people.
[42:36] Every one of you, God is in you.
[42:41] Don't think that God forget you. God
[42:44] never forget you.
[42:47] Hallelujah.
[42:50] God is in his people
[42:53] through the Holy Ghost manifesting the
[42:57] word of God to the people.
[43:00] The Holy Ghost is in you.
[43:04] Who is the Holy Ghost? God himself.
[43:09] Holy Ghost speak
[43:12] every language.
[43:15] When God want to speak to you sometime
[43:18] he can speak to you with audible voice
[43:21] any shape or form that he want to speak
[43:23] through you.
[43:25] He can speak to you while you are on the
[43:28] bed or leaning on on the side of your
[43:30] bed praying.
[43:33] He can talk to you this this this this.
[43:38] But if you stay ripe long in the
[43:42] presence of God
[43:44] and you ripe, you can hear that voice
[43:48] through your heart what God is speaking.
[43:52] And you have to act right there. Don't
[43:56] doubt sir. Don't doubt. When God speak,
[44:00] you got to believe. You are believers.
[44:03] You worship God. Satan has no power over
[44:06] you. Amen. To distract you when God want
[44:10] to use you. Hallelujah.
[44:13] God want to use every one of us. But you
[44:16] have to humble yourself. The gift is not
[44:20] for you. The gift is for the glory of
[44:23] God. Amen.
[44:25] You know
[44:27] when
[44:30] sometime even the believers in the
[44:33] message God use somebody
[44:36] to pray for somebody and he healed or do
[44:40] something and in manifestation comes now
[44:43] and the person started glorifying God to
[44:46] the people. What God did through me,
[44:48] what God is. Sometime people criticize
[44:53] that person. Why are you talking too
[44:56] much about this? But we go to the Bible
[44:59] and quote Elijah, Elisha,
[45:03] Peter, John, what they did say, but God
[45:07] have now such as I have taken your your
[45:12] your bed and go and we rejoice and God
[45:15] used your brother and he came in mercy
[45:17] two or three times. People get offended.
[45:22] Why?
[45:24] You are the children of God. God can use
[45:27] you anytime that he want.
[45:31] Hallelujah.
[45:33] God is still moving. Why we cherish
[45:36] 2,000 years years ago and even 1 year, 5
[45:41] year, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, 30
[45:44] years, the person still bringing that
[45:47] testimony all the time to glorify God.
[45:50] Why this brother bringing this
[45:51] testimony? And we still cherish
[45:56] 2005 and 2010.
[45:59] It's not the same Holy Ghost in you
[46:02] manifesting the same thing right here.
[46:06] Why don't you rejoice? Let me tell you,
[46:09] if God use me every day, I will speak it
[46:13] until your ear drum break.
[46:17] Hallelujah.
[46:20] Because it make me excited because I
[46:23] cannot do it. There's something that get
[46:26] hold of me. make that thing happen. Yes
[46:29] sir. Hallelujah. The person has nothing
[46:33] to do with that. No sir. It's God. If
[46:36] you want to see God, you will see God.
[46:39] Hallelujah.
[46:41] We are his presence. Let us write right
[46:46] here in this church. God will manifest.
[46:50] Your own eye. You will see something you
[46:52] never see before. Amen.
[46:56] I'm telling you it's coming.
[46:58] If you want to be a part of it, prepare.
[47:03] People got to stand and run because they
[47:06] never see it in such fashion.
[47:10] God never change. Right now, this is the
[47:13] bride time. This is his wife time. The
[47:16] power is in your hands. Hallelujah. The
[47:20] power is in everybody's hands. Not only
[47:22] the pastor, not only the minister, but
[47:25] it's for everyone.
[47:28] Hallelujah.
[47:31] Oh, thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah.
[47:34] Hallelujah.
[47:36] Do something for God to take hold of it.
[47:41] Hallelujah. You know what, Abraham? He
[47:44] said sometime when he's in the bush and
[47:48] you want to see the manifestation of God
[47:50] he just pick up
[47:53] pick up the leaves
[47:56] boom and throat on air rather we
[48:00] whirlwind took that thing and start
[48:02] moving start moving hallelujah
[48:06] thank you Lord do something for God to
[48:10] get hold of it and you see the power of
[48:13] God. Amen. In your own. Not only in the
[48:16] church, everywhere you go. Because God
[48:19] is with you everywhere.
[48:22] Hallelujah. Not only in the church.
[48:26] Everywhere.
[48:29] Even in the church, in the message,
[48:33] God used the minister,
[48:36] powerful minister.
[48:38] And sometime people get overboard.
[48:42] Some minister get like a crown in their
[48:45] head thinking they have the Holy Ghost
[48:48] in the suitcase and when they pick up it
[48:51] the Holy Ghost jump and everybody
[48:54] follow.
[48:56] Holy Ghost is everywhere not for one
[48:59] person. Hallelujah.
[49:03] Believe the man of God who God has given
[49:06] to you to feed you.
[49:09] Hallelujah. Trust in God through him
[49:13] and you will see the power of God in
[49:16] your own life.
[49:18] Hallelujah. God doesn't do anything for
[49:21] nothing.
[49:23] God sometime changes things. You may
[49:27] think it's wrong, but let me tell you,
[49:30] you cannot change God.
[49:32] God is God.
[49:35] The same God of universe is in you.
[49:39] Hallelujah.
[49:41] Holy Ghost is in you. Hallelujah.
[49:45] Blessed be the name of God.
[49:48] And sometime
[49:51] God use people
[49:54] and the same people that they claim to
[49:56] be your brother and your sister, they
[49:58] get jealous.
[50:00] Why? Because they are lazy.
[50:03] They don't see God enough to get their
[50:06] own position to know where God had his
[50:10] own position where God will use him
[50:12] mightily.
[50:14] But you use somebody
[50:17] they get jealous.
[50:19] That's not from God.
[50:22] You're going to get jealous and sit on
[50:24] the pew until your hair grow your hair
[50:27] grow
[50:29] and you don't see the power of God using
[50:31] you because why? You don't want to work
[50:34] somebody work. You don't like it and you
[50:36] jealous. Jealousy is not from God. It's
[50:40] from Satan.
[50:42] Love
[50:44] is from God. The love of God to edify
[50:49] the church. God is using the brother or
[50:52] sister get up. You know
[50:56] Paul, Peter and all of them if you read
[50:59] the Bible when they go around and they
[51:02] come and they bring the report the Bible
[51:06] say they all gathered together and
[51:09] rejoice
[51:10] the work that God has done through them.
[51:14] Amen. Hallelujah.
[51:18] When where in the Bible you ever see God
[51:22] use Paul, Peter, Philip, anybody that
[51:26] one jealous one another, they all
[51:28] rejoice together.
[51:32] When God use your brother or you sister,
[51:35] rejoice.
[51:38] Your time will come.
[51:41] Just stay in his presence
[51:44] and God will honor you. Let him lift you
[51:47] up. Humble yourself.
[51:52] Hallelujah.
[51:56] Can you don't know that even this
[51:58] message
[52:00] the ministers that God called them to
[52:03] preach to you and me
[52:06] sometime they get around and fight
[52:10] because everybody think that he knows
[52:12] one more than the other. When did Paul
[52:15] told Peter I I know more than you? When
[52:20] when did Philip told
[52:23] Matthew I know more than you? Is the
[52:25] same Holy Ghost. If God rich in mercy,
[52:29] God give you more wisdom. Don't think
[52:31] that you're higher than the other one.
[52:36] God is God. He knows your heart. Before
[52:40] you speak, he knows.
[52:43] Hallelujah.
[52:46] Let God lift you. Let God lift you up.
[52:52] Humble yourself in his presence.
[52:55] Hallelujah.
[52:57] Do something. Pray for something. Help
[53:01] somebody.
[53:03] Then you're going to see the hand of
[53:05] God. God is love. God is not hatred.
[53:10] When you have God in you, all the hatred
[53:13] gone,
[53:15] the love of God is perfect.
[53:19] Hallelujah.
[53:21] Amen.
[53:25] Thank you, Jesus.
[53:30] As you sitting here, I want one hand
[53:34] that goes up and said, "God cannot use
[53:38] me." Let me see how many hands.
[53:42] No, not even nobody.
[53:45] That means
[53:47] God has spoke to you.
[53:51] God can use you any way or shape or
[53:55] form. It doesn't matter whether you can
[53:58] speak English, you your English doesn't
[54:01] come too good like me. I say B and C and
[54:05] everything mess up. Hallelujah. But I
[54:08] don't care like that. I don't care
[54:11] whether my English what you know what
[54:14] they did.
[54:16] Oh, you miss your grandma. What this?
[54:18] But when God come and say your number is
[54:21] this, your my number is your number is
[54:22] this. You have this sickness when you
[54:24] were a baby and you that's that's where
[54:26] the the grammar grammar comes.
[54:31] I don't cover your grammar
[54:34] and all your quotes that you're going to
[54:37] bring the people if there's no life
[54:40] behind that code is nothing because that
[54:43] code has a power behind that quote.
[54:46] Every code that you you you you you give
[54:49] from brother Abraham there's a power
[54:51] behind that.
[54:53] Hallelujah. And there's a love, God love
[54:56] behind that word
[54:58] that will bring the manifestation of the
[55:01] word of God where he can pray for for
[55:05] his nighting girl. A person who has no
[55:08] bone flesh in the bone
[55:13] and he said you going to leave.
[55:16] How you leave?
[55:18] Where is that grammar?
[55:21] Where is that grammar that people
[55:22] talking about? You need God, not a
[55:25] grammar.
[55:27] You need God in your life. You need the
[55:30] Holy Ghost in your life.
[55:33] I don't care how much drama I have. I
[55:36] have God in me and I believe in him.
[55:40] Hallelujah. Because I see the
[55:42] manifestation of the word of God. People
[55:45] got healed cancer
[55:48] so many times. Not one time. I can give
[55:52] you a testimony from morning to the
[55:55] evening. The same thing that will happen
[55:58] in the days of Paul, Peter, I I see too.
[56:03] So when I talk about God, I know God is
[56:07] real.
[56:10] I don't just talk and jump here. I talk
[56:13] because I believe and I know God is
[56:16] real. Abra Abraham can pray for people
[56:22] to go and get up.
[56:26] It's not the same Holy Ghost. You think
[56:28] it's brother Abraham? He say it's not
[56:30] me. You know, he said it's not will
[56:33] Abraham has loan his spirit to me to
[56:36] use. Why don't you loan
[56:39] give your spirit to God to use you?
[56:43] You sisters sitting here, I gave you a I
[56:48] gave you a message. The dove and the
[56:50] lamp. Can you put that tape where that
[56:54] woman,
[56:57] a sister
[57:00] going and he pray for somebody, a baby
[57:04] who has leukemia,
[57:06] he's taking that baby to brother Abraham
[57:08] to pray for.
[57:11] and the sister.
[57:13] God place that test in the heart of that
[57:18] sister to pray for that woman.
[57:22] Oh, glory to God. You sisters, you have
[57:25] a position.
[57:27] Don't think that you cannot stand here.
[57:29] You have a position to pray for the
[57:32] gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[57:35] Don't think that you are nothing. You
[57:38] are more than what you think.
[57:41] Anything happens, stand on your grounds,
[57:44] call on him.
[57:46] Elohim, the Lord Jesus, the only one,
[57:49] true God. Amen. Hallelujah. He will be
[57:53] on the scene. He said, "You call me, I
[57:55] will be there. Whatever you ask, I will
[57:58] do it. Don't fall for."
[58:01] Hallelujah. Can you pray that tape?
[58:05] And then that is the end of my message.
[58:43] I'm telling you. Um,
[58:46] it was raining real hard and the place
[58:49] was packed and they were standing around
[58:50] the walls. Um,
[58:54] and so they there's Billy had give out
[58:56] prayer cards and then and there was a

[59:07] what it is you know sitting there little
[59:09] Christian saint sitting in front and she
[59:12] had this mother had no place to to um to
[59:15] uh sit down with the baby and this
[59:17] little mother began to feel sorry for
[59:18] that baby and that little woman walking
[59:21] back and forth And the Holy Spirit said
[59:22] to the mother, "Pray for that baby." Oh,
[59:25] she said, "I couldn't ask that woman.
[59:26] Pray for the baby." Oh, it's best to do
[59:29] what God tells you to do. And so when
[59:32] she said, "Next time she comes by, I'll
[59:33] ask her if I can pray for the baby." And
[59:35] when she come by, she's packing a prayer
[59:36] card. Oh, she said, "I wouldn't ask to
[59:39] pray for that baby." Well, Brother
[59:40] Brandon's going to pray for that baby.
[59:41] Like that meant any more than anything
[59:43] anybody else. Said, "Brother Brandon's
[59:44] going to pray for that baby." So the
[59:46] Holy Spirit kept dealing with her and
[59:48] time lingered on. I hadn't come yet. And
[59:50] so um then the little woman said uh just
[59:53] got so convicted said sister would you
[59:55] like to sit down with the baby? Oh she
[59:57] said I don't want to take your seat dear
[59:59] and probably that little mother's
[1:00:01] compassion more for that baby than what
[1:00:02] mine would have been. And she said
[1:00:04] sister said take this seat and sit down
[1:00:06] but said I want to tell you I know
[1:00:08] you're a Christian. She said yes ma'am I
[1:00:10] am. And she said I'm a Christian too.
[1:00:12] Said God just kept speaking to me. Pray
[1:00:14] for that baby. Said you got a card
[1:00:16] there. Said brother Brandham's going to
[1:00:17] pray for that baby. She said, "I hope he
[1:00:19] calls my number tonight. I'm here to
[1:00:21] with my baby." And said, "It's seriously
[1:00:23] sick." And um and said, "I hope he calls
[1:00:25] my number." And she said, "Well, you sit
[1:00:27] down here and let me pray for the baby
[1:00:29] so I can just get it off my heart."
[1:00:31] Said, "Because I feel condemned if I
[1:00:32] don't do it." She said, "Why certainly,
[1:00:33] honey, you pray for the baby." And she
[1:00:36] prayed a little prayer. They said, "Lord
[1:00:37] Jesus, you was warning my heart and I
[1:00:39] just laid my hands over on the little
[1:00:40] baby and if it's doing wrong servants to
[1:00:42] pray for her, don't don't let it
[1:00:44] reflect. Lord, I'm just trying to ease
[1:00:45] my feeling." That's the Holy Spirit
[1:00:47] telling that little woman that. So, she
[1:00:49] prayed for the little baby and the woman
[1:00:51] gave the lady with the prayer card and
[1:00:53] the baby in the seat and the little lady
[1:00:55] climbed up and stood up in the balcony
[1:00:56] way up there. Well, after a while, the
[1:00:59] rain let up a little and I got in, come
[1:01:01] in, walked the platform, preached a
[1:01:03] little while, called a prayer line, and
[1:01:04] I just called about 10 cards or
[1:01:06] something like that causes all to be in
[1:01:08] discernment. And sometimes that way when
[1:01:10] I get down to 10, I'm I'm pretty near
[1:01:11] gone if it's a fresh meeting. So then
[1:01:13] when they they I told them I said now
[1:01:15] friends you it's your faith you got to
[1:01:17] believe it. So when when they called the
[1:01:20] number I believe for from 20 to 30 or
[1:01:22] something like that or 30 to 40 whatever
[1:01:24] it was that little woman was about
[1:01:26] fourth in line that baby that little
[1:01:27] mother felt real good then. So up come
[1:01:29] the little baby and the mother and the
[1:01:31] little thing had a blanket over it like
[1:01:32] this and it was real sick. So I come up
[1:01:35] to where the prayer line was going on.
[1:01:37] When I come up I said how do you do? I
[1:01:39] got it on tape. See that's how I know
[1:01:40] all about it. So I said, "How do you
[1:01:42] do?" And she said, "How do you do?" I
[1:01:44] said, "I suppose we're strangers one." I
[1:01:46] was trying to contact her spirit then.
[1:01:47] See? And um she said, "Yes, sir, we
[1:01:49] are." I said, "You're not here for
[1:01:51] yourself. It's for your baby." She said,
[1:01:52] "That's right." I said, "It's got
[1:01:54] leukemia." And she said, "That is right.
[1:01:56] The doctor says just give it a few
[1:01:57] months to live." I said, "Well, wait a
[1:02:00] minute."
[1:02:01] I said, "The baby's already healed.
[1:02:03] There's a little woman I just prayed
[1:02:05] for. It's got a a little gingham dress
[1:02:07] on." I said, "She just prayed for the
[1:02:09] baby a few minutes ago." I said that's
[1:02:10] her stand out right there. Her name's
[1:02:11] Miss so and so and so and so.
[1:02:14] Hallelujah. Then obedience is better
[1:02:17] than sacrifice. Now that same spirit
[1:02:20] that witnessed you tonight,
[1:02:22] I am the dove. You see,
[1:02:26] Holy Spirit's in you.
[1:02:29] Don't underestimate yourself.
[1:02:32] Don't think you cannot stand here. You
[1:02:34] don't have a voice like me. So you
[1:02:36] cannot sing. So nobody see you or you
[1:02:40] cannot preach.
[1:02:42] You are angel God's in investigation
[1:02:47] angel.
[1:02:49] Sisters
[1:02:51] I encourage you do your work and let God
[1:02:56] lift you up. Don't put yourself down.
[1:03:01] Let God use you.
[1:03:04] God bless you. This is what I have.
[1:03:09] Sister Sister Sheila,
[1:03:13] can you come to the pulpit as
[1:03:17] I said?
[1:03:24] Amen. Brother Phillip,
[1:03:28] come ahead. Brother
[1:03:31] Sister Sheila Elanga is here with us
[1:03:33] this evening.
[1:03:35] The enemy has been afflicting her for
[1:03:39] few years now since she decided to come
[1:03:42] to the Lord.
[1:03:44] But the Lord knows all about her
[1:03:46] situation.
[1:03:48] He continually
[1:03:50] shows himself
[1:03:52] over and over again the enemy is going
[1:03:54] to fight.
[1:03:56] But like we heard here tonight,
[1:04:00] it's something
[1:04:02] that has to be revealed to our sister.
[1:04:07] And once it's revealed in her heart,
[1:04:11] that Jesus Christ is her only healer,
[1:04:18] that it's her absolute.
[1:04:20] There's no doctor that can do anything
[1:04:23] unless God uses the doctor. Doctors can
[1:04:27] set a broken arm, a broken leg, fix a
[1:04:32] broken nerve,
[1:04:34] fix a broken heart, but it's God that
[1:04:37] heals the vessel. It's God that heals
[1:04:42] the body. He is the Lord God that health
[1:04:45] all of our diseases.
[1:04:48] And if we can just come to a place where
[1:04:50] we know that where it's there's no there
[1:04:54] there's no doubt there's no compromise.
[1:04:58] Let the doctors do what the doctors need
[1:05:00] to do. But God is God. Amen. He changes
[1:05:05] not. Amen. Praise God. But the word of
[1:05:09] God tells us that we can uh take oil and
[1:05:14] we can anoint the sick with oil.
[1:05:18] We can pray over them
[1:05:21] and God will forgive them. God will heal
[1:05:24] them when when he decides.
[1:05:28] It's not in our
[1:05:31] time. It's in his time. He'll make all
[1:05:35] things beautiful in his time. Amen.
[1:05:38] Praise God. Open that.
[1:05:44] Sister Sheila, according to the word of
[1:05:46] God, I anoint you with oil representing
[1:05:50] the Holy Spirit. And as servants of the
[1:05:53] living God, we lay our hands upon you
[1:05:56] and we pray and we believe. Father, in
[1:05:58] the name of Jesus Christ, as your
[1:06:00] servants, Lord, as the word has come
[1:06:03] forth here tonight, Lord, we heard the
[1:06:06] testimony of a simple woman that that
[1:06:09] Lord, it came so strong upon her heart
[1:06:12] to pray because you had come, Lord.
[1:06:15] You've come into our midst here tonight
[1:06:17] to vindicate yourself. Lord, you are the
[1:06:20] only God that health. You're the Lord
[1:06:22] God that health all of our disease. Lord
[1:06:25] Jesus, above all things, you would that
[1:06:28] we would uh prosper in health, oh God.
[1:06:31] Lord Jesus, Father, we lay our hands
[1:06:34] upon her in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:06:36] And Satan, we adjure you by the word of
[1:06:39] the living God to leave this vessel,
[1:06:42] leave her atmospheres, leave her
[1:06:44] bloodstream, leave her brain cells,
[1:06:47] leave her nerve endings, leave every
[1:06:49] fiber, every atom and every molecule of
[1:06:52] her body in the name of Jesus Christ. We
[1:06:55] curse your activity. We bind your power
[1:06:58] and your influence upon this vessel
[1:07:00] tonight in the name of Jesus Christ. And
[1:07:03] Lord, may your spirit and your anointing
[1:07:05] come upon her, oh God. Lord, may it rest
[1:07:07] upon her mind, her heart, and her
[1:07:09] spirit. Lord, may it move into her home
[1:07:12] and into her children, into her husband,
[1:07:14] Patrick. Lord, may your spirit and your
[1:07:17] anointing move in such a way, Lord, that
[1:07:19] every unbelief will leave the home. Oh
[1:07:22] God, that you're nothing but perfect
[1:07:24] faith will abide in that home, in her
[1:07:26] heart, in her mind. Bring perfect
[1:07:28] harmony. Bring bring a harmony between
[1:07:31] her and her husband. Lord, let your
[1:07:33] spirit take control. Great Jehovah God,
[1:07:36] vindicate yourself, Lord. Show yourself
[1:07:39] that you are God. There's none above
[1:07:41] you. There's none beside you. There's
[1:07:43] none before you. Lord God, you are the
[1:07:45] only one that we look to tonight. Lord,
[1:07:48] vindicate yourself, Father. Take the
[1:07:50] praise, the glory, and the honor in the
[1:07:53] vindication of our sister's healing in
[1:07:55] her body. Oh God, Lord, you said signs
[1:07:58] and wonders shall follow them that
[1:08:00] believe. Father, we are believers
[1:08:02] tonight. Lord, this house believes
[1:08:04] tonight, Father, every vessel in this
[1:08:07] place, oh God, in the name of Jesus
[1:08:09] Christ, if there be any sickness among
[1:08:11] us, leave the people, Satan, in the name
[1:08:14] of Jesus Christ, we claim our healing.
[1:08:16] We claim our our our deliverance in the
[1:08:19] name of Jesus. Lord, we give you praise,
[1:08:22] glory, and honor tonight. Father, may
[1:08:24] you receive the glory in Jesus Christ's
[1:08:28] name we pray. Amen and amen.
[1:08:32] Praise God forever more. God bless you,
[1:08:35] sister. Go believing.
[1:08:39] Help her, sister. Take her right home.
[1:08:42] Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. Thank you,
[1:08:45] brother Desmond, for the word of God
[1:08:47] tonight. Amen. Praise God, saints.
[1:08:51] We rejoice in the Lord, knowing that we
[1:08:55] serve a living God who's present. He's
[1:08:59] an everpresent help in a time of
[1:09:01] trouble. Regardless of whatever comes
[1:09:04] into your Listen, either you believe
[1:09:06] this word or you don't. It's as simple
[1:09:08] as that. We've come to the time and the
[1:09:11] season of this word vindicating and And
[1:09:15] uh God is his own interpreter. He's
[1:09:17] going to interpret it in your life.
[1:09:20] Your life is going to bear record
[1:09:23] whether this word is real to you or not.
