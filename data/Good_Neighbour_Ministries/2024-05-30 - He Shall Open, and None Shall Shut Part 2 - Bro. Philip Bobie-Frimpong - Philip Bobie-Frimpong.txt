every day I see is how open me Faithfully to overcome my trials guiding me constantly me Victory it's a reality something keeps holding me amen you are not kept by Own Strength it's something that keeps on holding you me the scripture said where two or three are gathered in my name I'm in your presence God is not looking at the majority numbers you're looking at individual who has a right so without wasting much time you're going to pray oh our gracious Eternal God I'm so grateful father I'm thankful I appreciate you for making a way for us to be here tonight dear Lord search my heart and search your people's heart if anyone of us have offended you done anything wrong please forgive us oh God we have that confidence that your blood it washes us from all sins so father we approach thy throne of grace knowing that you will hear our cry father may you take me aside and once more speak to your bride we thank you and we love you in Jesus name amen please we can go um it's not been easy trying printed my quotation and everything trying to let my daughter print it and when we about to come you couldn't find you couldn't print it the printer has been working throughout the week but nothing could be printed so I know maybe if I need I might let her put it on board or I just going to leave it so it is what it is God knows best we not going to worry about it the enemy is just always try to what distract but you have to ignore his distractions and move on Amen Hallelujah okay so our scripture tonight is taken from I have three scriptures and then I'm going to continue what we started on the May 15 um okay so three scriptures Matthew 171 to13 Hebrews 122 and Revelation 3:7 okay Matthew 171-3 and after 6 days Jesus thed people James and John his brother and bringing them up into an high mountain apart and was transed before them and his face this shine as the sun and his rment was white as the light and behold there appeared unto them Moses and leas talking with them then answered Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here if thou will let us make here three Tabernacles one for thee and one for Moses and one for elas then then answered Peter and said on while he yet spake Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased hear ye him I'm going to stress more on the verse five and when the disciples heard it they fell on their face and were so afraid and Jesus came and touched them and said arise and be not afraid and when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no man save Jesus only and as they came that the become more understanding with time and you read it becomes so I don't know how to express it but this Bible has become a new Bible to me and as they came down from the mountain Jesus shed them saying tell the vision to know man until the son of mine be raisen again from the dead and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that elas must first come and Jesus answered and said unto them elas truly shall first come and restore all things but I see unto you that elas is come already and they knew him not but they have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them then they understood that he spoke unto them of John the Baptist Hebrews 122 looking onto this say the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and he sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God and then the same scripture last week Revelation 3:7 and to the angel of the Church of in Philadelphia WR these things said he that is Holy he that is true he that had the Key of David he that open it and no man shout it and shout it and no man open it that'll be my part two of what I did last week Heavenly Father may you bless the reading of their word in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen please be seated okay um so I'm going to recap a little bit from the previous week we talk about he that open it and no one can sh it and when you sh it no one can open it and you talk about how God reveal himself to an individual it's not he that rth but God who is rich in Mercy and then we concluded in Isaiah 20:22 saying that he that he shall open and no one can shut and he that shut no one can open he has it on his shoulder that means that he took a responsibility of ourselves like when you get married and you take a responsibility of that woman he took all responsibilities came and died on Calvary Forest so I'm just going to still read the same quote that I read then I go on my thing the other day I was talking and we were thinking of scriptures um pama's local canum caterp paragraph 55 there it is and happened to and I happen to think I don't care how clear it is how much the scripture teaches it you'll never be able to say it until God himself show it to you don't care how clear it is and the whole Bible is built and the whole Church of the Living God is built upon a spiritual revelation of the word why did Abel offer a more excellent sacrifice than Kain why didn't Abel follow Kain he had most beautiful ch but it was revealed to him when Jesus came from man transgression and they said who th man say I the son of am one said elas and one said you are prophet and so forth he said but who do you say I am Peter said thou are the Christ the son of the Living God he said blessed art thou Simon the son of Jonas for Flesh and Blood never revealed this to you you never learn it with some books or some seminaries or s station of man M schem but my Father in Heaven has revealed that to you and upon this Ro I will build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it there you are spiritual revelation of the word of God and then you also talk about for you it is given to what understand the mystery of the Kingdom to them it's not given so what I'm trying to say is that um as you read scriptures remember God does not deal with the majority he deals with individual who have a pure heart and when he has a church of 500 one day he said except you eat of My Flesh and drink my blood you have no part in me and they left it was left with 70 and he said the son of man who is now standing here in heaven and they say they never heard this saying so they left him and it was left with 12 and one of them was a devil and then in man transgression it has three of them John Peter and James and that was hope faith and uh charity then the crowd th down later on then he asked them who do you say I am the son of man I am so right now it became individual from 500 to to to 70 to 12 to three and then it has th down to you as an individual tonight who do you say this is what time are you living in what part of the scripture are you fulfilling what is going doing in his present day Ministry who do you say this is this is not a group Affair it's an individual Affair God call us individually going to face him individually one time there was a somebody that um somebody winess to I think winess to him I did not know I met him at the library and he was telling that oh that church everything they spoke is truth but I brought my wife he prayed for me and my wife came from Africa over here and my wife doesn't like the church so I'm going to stay home home and follow my wife to bring peace and I said brother we don't do it that way because you as an individual is going to face God you are not going to face god with your wife you take the stand and God who created that wife of yours is more than able to turn him to turn her around but you first have to stand for the word of God it's a test to you because listen is good to have a wonderful family in this life but no wonder the scripture said that I rather go to heaven with one Blind Eye than to have all my eyes and miss this eternal life miss this heaven so nothing in this life can be compared to the Salvation of our soul when it comes to Salvation an individual this is life and death you don't compromise it on your wife or your husband or your children or anyone else this is you and God it is me I standing here in the need of prayer me that need the grace of God in my life every day it's me that I'm asking God for his abundance Grace it's me I'm standing here needing God it's not you and your brother it's not you this thing he said two in the B I'll take one and I'll leave one the crowd is thinning we don't have to joke with our Salvation this thing God has given to us is more than the whole world no wonder he says that when one Soul repented the whole Heavenly Host Rejoice this is an individual Affair is not a group and it's never going to be a group so let's serve God the best that we can whilst we have our living amen praise our God hallelujah amen thank you Jesus our God is good amen yes and then I'll come back to the scripture that we read in Matthew 17 verse4 I think verse three and behold there appeared unto them Moses and elas talking with him then answered Peter and said unto him Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here he was excited amen so many times we get excited when we have revelation God reveals them to the excitement becomes so great and I believe that Peter was excited he's always been excited anyway amen and he said if thou will let us make their three Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses and one for elas while he yet spake Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them which Behold a voice out of the cloud said this is my beloved Son hear ye him in other words Peter was trying to make a tabernacle or make um a worship whatever to to what for Moses and Moses what the law Giver before Genesis before Exodus 19 they did not have a law God gave them Grace by a prophet pillow of fire and everything and they asked for the Lord because remember when God called Abraham he gave him unconditional what Covenant unlike Adam and Eve said that if thou do this if thou do this if thou do not do not partake of the tree if you partake of a tree this will happen that will happen but when it came to Abraham God gave him what an unconditional covenant not Abraham do this or that but I God have done it all so being a royal Seed of Abraham we have the same Covenant of Grace it's not what you have done or what I have done but the grace of God but the children of Israel because they wanted to have something to do with it so they asked for the law and they couldn't keep the law because the LA will always point you to your mistakes to be a sinner what the that's what the Lord does it point you to the school Master follow this thou shall not do this thou shall not do that th shall not do this and even in this this message a lot of people I'm afraid a lot of people are following this word without their own personal revelation because somebody tell them wear a long skirt they wear the long skirt don't cut your head they don't cut it's all good and the man put on nice suit nice pants it's all good to dress right but somewhere braah was even saying that if I tell you do not wear pants and some something in your heart do not tell you don't do do do that don't do it do it of revelation of understanding when God reveal it to you and you understand what you are doing then you can stand on it because then you know what you are doing just like the Hebrew children they knew what they were doing they know who they were following so when the time came that they said they were going to bend them because they have a revelation of God that they are serving they could stand there and said that we know our God is able to deliver us but even if he chose not to you are not going to bow down to that image so it is a true Christian who has had understanding of the word of God he doesn't follow it by the law because no one can follow The Ten Commandments that's why he said that my yoke is easy he that is heavy laden come unto me and I will give you rest into your soul that rest is the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost in you will help you to overcome because it's not by power or by might but by my spirit says the Lord so when the spirit of Christ in you there the his Spirit who is the ho holy ghost that will help you to overcome that will help you to live beyond this flesh that will help you to overcome things that you naturally cannot overcome because we ourselves we cannot do it but with the grace of God with the help of Christ in us he help us to overcome our our Temptations to overcome things that we cannot overcome so what the people need most is to be born again to have the true revelation of the word of God for their day so that they can live what walking in the line of God because they are not being told what to do they are doing it from the depth of their heart it's just like paying tight just like coming to church just like praying just like um fasting all those things are good but has to be done with a revelation because we doing all those things out from the depth of your heart to love of God with faith you know what you are doing then you don't look at your circumstances and look at your pocket and look at the bills and said oh my paycheck is maybe $100 how can I pay $10 with this economic condition but if you have a revelation you know that it's God who gave you the strength even to go to work it's God who has given your health tonight it's God who is protecting you it's God he that started that good work in you is able to take you the end so you don't look at your circumstances but you look at the promise of God and Believe on what that word said because that word is your absolute so nothing else should hinder you by pleasing God that's what the Bible said that it's impossible to please God without what faith and faith is a revelation by it all the elders he gave us s Samson of of Abraham every one of them they were only able to please God by faith so the thing has to revealed to you know our Pastor said all the time when God asked Abel to make that sacrifice there was no Bible written but by inspiration from God he was able to what offer an excellent sacrifice so with that inspiration from God you cannot please him he said no one comes to the father except I draw him first you are predestinated you are part of him you are elected so elected child or daughter of God God will reveal himself to you he won't hide himself from you when the time comes for you to know he will make it plain to you because he's the same yesterday today and forever as he did to the elders you're going to do it to you and to me God hasn't changed amen he will never forsake you nor leave you amen so back to what Peter said he wanted to build another Tabernacle for Elijah Elijah was Justice judgment God's justice I don't I cannot stand God Justice or God judgment I want his grace and grace and grace alone the Judgment of of God the jti of God that's why the Bible said that he that believe on me has has has passed from Death unto life and shall not come into what any condemnation amen you cannot do by our own righteousness he said your own righteousness is like onto F racks but his righteousness it helps you to live above sin so Christ who is righteous God living his righteous life through you it makes everything become simple so we are not asking God for law or for justice but I want the grace of God grace and grace alone the Capstone the cry it went on the capsu was Grace The Headstone Grace Grace Grace Grace is UN merited favor something that you and I have not worked to what to Merit it because the law the children of Israel they follow every bit of the law but when Christ the word came they could not recognize him they were emphasizing more on washing of their caps of their uh catary all those things and that was all good but when the effect of perfection came they said one time why your disciples eat with um unwashed hands he told them it's not what goes into the mouth not what it's not what um goes into the mouth that def a man but what comes out of the man that defies them not the washing of the hands but is the inside inside because that's why we are Sav from the inside out the do is wash from the inside or cleanses it from the inside and they were emphasing too much on the outside do not do this in Africa somewhere it have become so bad that the women they think because they don't cut they don't H do do anything to their head they make it natural that qualifies them to go to the Rapture no if you do not want to keep your hair naturally that's fine but don't use it as a doctrine that is what is happening a lot of people are using the word something that they feel comfortable to do to be a doctrine that shall not do this you have to do this you have to do that no if it's good for you do it like vegetarian if you want to eat your vegan go ahead and eat it don't push it on me that's what is going on with all these genders whatever gender you want to have is your pro it's your problem you want to be this gender that's fine don't push it on me lead me to live my life and do what God has revealed to me as individual to do it's not a collective H it's individual work with the Gentiles so those things are all good but don't make it as a law and put it on the people that's what is happening out there but God has set us free the blood of Christ has set us free from all things you are free whom the son of man has set free is free and free indeed you can eat anything said let no one judge you in meat or in anything you bless it and eat it I'm not saying that you have to eat um unconcern you have to be selective what but just the main emphasis is bless your food and eat it that's it don't let nobody judge you by what you eat just try the best to e the best that you can because the system and everything is not good but let no one judge you you have to do what God revealed to you and it became so bad that even our own brother Peter hide and go and meet with the Gentiles and Paul has to rebuke him you see it's easy for the people to what um criticize it criticize that but they don't look into themselves to see what where they stand what that somewh they said that he that tells you don't steal does he steal he that tell does he do all that is no more law we pass from law to Grace he who is doing it is it's not you or me it's God's Grace Grace Grace Grace Grace that is greater than all my sins Grace that will take us through hallelujah amen praise our God our God is good amen thank you Jesus I'm still over here and verse seven and Jesus came and touched them and said arise and be not afraid and when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no man save what Jesus holy amen Jesus holy it is Jesus Hallelujah he has touched the Hem of my garment and his blood has made me whole when the eyes were open it was only on Jesus we thank God for sending us Vindicated Prophet Malachi 456 Revelation 10:7 Amos 37 God s with the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost apart from the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ never happened on the face of this Earth brother William myON Braham to reveal the seven SE and all those things but when you look in John somewhere he said that arm your fellow servant worship God we worship the Lord Jesus Christ and we thank God for sending us a prophet so that our eyes can see can have understanding of what is going on now but we are not worshipping the prophet we put him in his proper position know that he is a seventh angel but our our worship is only to the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he is every he pointed us to Christ he never pointed us to himself elas was a man subject to like we are he prayed endless that not rain and rain did not come he identifies us and everything that this message preach is pointing us to Christ never to himself and we thank God for him we thank God for the ministry but just like elazar and Isaac and Rebecca God sent his Prophet to find a bride like Ela found that Bride for Isaac and when elizar brought Rebecca to Isaac it was a love affair between Rebecca and Isaac so it's a love affair between the bride of Christ and the and Christ amen we thank God for the messenger we thank God for the message amen that has opened up eyes of understanding without this message none of us can know anything could have heard anything the godhead SE marriage and divorce all this things God used the prophet to make it plain to us and he that receive um give the prophet um prophet's reward refuse the receive the prophet's reward so we accept him and give him his place and thank God for him and God is going to give us that reward but we worship Jesus Christ it's Christ and Christ alone that's why if you check in the um future home of the Heavenly bride and Earthly messenger groom he said that God redeemed the Earth with what the same three stages and four stages justification sanctification baptism of Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost himself like in the the in the Earth you tap is like Noah God sent the rain to justify the people at that time and then he came and shed his blood to Sanctified then another 6,000 the 6,000 years he's going to use what come and destroy all the atmosphere here then after that we go to the Millennium which the seven Church age and the Millennium we are going to work we're going to plant we're going to do everything but when he comes to in the new Earth and the new heaven Heep preparing from Heaven that thing that time with the time like the eighth messenger like the convocation the first day became L the the seven the seventh goes the eighth day like the first day and then the eighth day is like the first day again after the convocation the 5777 is 49 when it enter the 50th it goes back to day one and the Lord Jesus Christ rose up on the what the eth day so the Eighth Day is himself Eternal Church age messenger is Christ himself this no he has no man hands on it it's Christ Alone he is the one is our messenger he's the one leading us he's the one guiding us he's absolute amen he let all those seven churches ages do all that they can Luther Luther wesle Pentecost and and the and the Pentecostal but when it came to the E day day he said I go and prepare a place for you amen a new Heaven and new earth is God himself on the throne he share not his glory with anyone he's the Lord Jesus Christ he's the one I worship he's the one that I praise he's the one that give my all he's my absolute amen I thank God for this salvation oh he came from Earth from heaven let it Stone above to die to save you and me if it wasn't for the love where would I have been the love of God when you stood behind pilot he opened not his mouth he was thinking of you and me he have the right to marry bra he chose not to when he saw all those things coming when he went the tomb and died he rose up so that you and I can live he went through all that knowing that he was coming here to die for you and me but if it wasn't for that love where would I have been it wasn't for that love the Love on Calvary the love that he showed towards me he didn't have to but wasn't for that love he left all everything to come and die the most what shameful death for you and me how howah should we do when you go through a little thing we cry we mourn so much look at what he went through no matter what you going through tonight remember he has gone through for you he came to die so that you can live he chose to become poor so you can become I'm rich he became sick so you can be made whole no matter what the doctors are telling you don't listen to the doctor's report believe the true report by his stries Billy you were healed he's the same yesterday today and forever that love of God if it wasn't for that labory where will you have been and if you see what he has done for us then it also should encourage us even love our enemies and pray for those who despitefully uses amen because God allow his reain to fall on the just and the unjust he didn't send a rain only for his just people for both just and unjust that means that we should also also what help and do good to anyone regardless first you help those in the same Faith but your good to the people outside there should not discriminate if they are not Christians so what help them anyhow because listen if you are living the time of Jesus and you are a Christian and May be before the teeth on the cross was on the cross and said remember me in his time if you had come and steal something from you or he has done something wrong with you if you are gone with your naked ey you C the man do everything but if you have the spirit of Christ no matter what the people has done for you just forgive them before he forgiv us forgiveness forgiveness is the key you don't forgive because someone tell you to forgive but unconsciously from your heart you forgive them then you get the blessing you pray if you can let God help you so that you can forgive the people from your heart because you don't know whom you are dealing with no wonder Steven said do not hold this charge on them because Paul at that time was Saul he was part of those who were persecuting Steven but the grace of God that was in steeven heart he asked God not to what hold it to their account forgive them for they do not know what they are doing so let's have forgiveness spirit and forgive the people regardless of what they do to us because our God he said if you do not forgive our heavenly father will also not forgive you your sins so how do you expect something from God when you hold something against somebody in your heart regardless what they have done for you you have to forgive amen our God is good I haven't even gone to um most of the things I want to say okay let's keep on going okay and then when and as they came down from verse 9 from Mountain Jesus shed them saying tell the vision to no man until the son of man be raisen again from the dead and his disciples asked him saying why then they say why then say the scribes that elas must first come you see even though the Disciples of Jesus Christ they walk with him they fish with him everything but they Mi that what Ministry of John the Baptist so they were asking him that if you are going to the cross and to be risen again then Elijah must first come before that thing happens scripturally but that thing has happened gone and they did not know it so it is happening in our time in our day God has sent a Vindicated Prophet to fulfill Malachi 4:56 Revelation 107 Amos 37 all those scriptures and the people in the denominational world they don't have a clue what has happened and this thing has happened and gone throughout the whole world only the elected few eyes have been open that's why to you it is given to know the mystery of the Kingdom to them it is not given so that the eyes is the eyes will what will not be open and their ears will not be what um their ears can cannot hear so they will not hear and their eyes will not be open to noise so that they can be converted but for you it is given to know the mystery of the Kingdom it's God who open your understanding and shatter the understanding of those dominal world so that alone should let you be what happy and move on say that you are precious in the eyes of the Living God Amen nothing should let you down and those denomination people their eyes have what shut Grace can you put on that quotation for me to read and go on with my word and then what am I saying when it an absolute verse 205 to 200 to 205 and then when you come to even around the ranks of the message the Bible said many are called but few are chosen as the brother um said in last week that everyone that has received this message are called to recognize what the prophet is doing but the bride is within the message amen the same way they ask that the scripture say why do elas must first come so I'm afraid people around the scrope of the message one day those who are not the True by elest of God will wake up and said why does the scripture said Rapture must first come and the Rapture has come and gone and they did not know it no one I said that could be pass through like their nose and they won't even know know it but every scripture has been what fulfilled that's why he says somewhere that before there will be a drop of BB before this third word take place you'll be what you'll be caught up to be the Lord in the air there are so many scriptures that when that has to happen before the tribulation times it has to happen for the bride to go so those who are around the message that knows the letter this that that but do having got because he a foolish virgin and wise virgin all of them are Christians they all have done everything but the difference is what oil oil being the Revelation the true revelation of the word of God they don't have it but they have the letter said the letter kth but the spirit giveth life so they don't have that thing so that that piece of the Chinese G what come and C them up and take them to the the presence of God to that Rapture but they will recognized one day and they wake up and realize that that Rapture is gone because remember it's not going to be a public show he said two in the bed I'll take one and I'll leave one can put it on for me Grace and then it's not a many member body okay yeah there's isn't one thing left as I see in the prophet word one thing left one thing hindering that's not the one but that's okay one thing hindering the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ this very hour not one thing left in the Bible everything that's not the one but that's fine everything has been fulfilled waiting now for the coming and how should we okay that's fine so what I'm trying to say is that by time they realize that everything is what is gone and then we be in the presence of the Lord hallelujah amen praise God hallelujah thank you Jesus hallelujah praise our wonderful God our God is good all the time Hallelujah okay just put the one that you put on for me to read just make it big so what I'm trying to say is that we have to be what ready every time no matter what comes our way we have to be ready just like um the sister who was one time going to um New York he was from Ireland going to New York and when she was going the ship the ship was about to sink and when that thing happened the people were panicking because remember before they were singing jazz and they were making they were dancing and everything the ship but then the captain told them in the next half an hour this ship is going to sink and right there the people stop from their just music to sing Amazing Grace when people see death are coming the attitude changed just like 911 when that thing happened all the Bible was told out in New York but within a what a month or two they forgot about everything so we have to pray up because Prayer Changes Things and if Prayer Changes Things why don't you pray pray and pray so that sister was what prayed up so the captain went to her and said that Hey sister what is going on everybody is shaking and sinking and you are laughing and as if nothing is happening and she told her that why should I worry said do you know what is happening she said yes I know this s this ship can sink in 30 minutes or we can overcome it and I'll be in New York so either this ship sink in 30 minutes I'm going to have two two daughters one of them is in glory so if this sink ship in 30 minutes I'm going to meet the one in glory if it does not sink and it survive the sink I'll be in New York I'll see my other daughter why should I worry so I'm telling you tonight why should you praise God we have this assurance because listen this is not the time that you going to say maybe just we have to be certain of God now the absence from here presence with the Lord it doesn't matter what you go through you have to be prayed up you have to be ready I know that absence from here going to be present with the Lord Death is what most people fear even the prophet job they were all scared of death but when the Lord Jesus Christ came he took the key of death that key from the devil he he conquered hell grave and and he conquered death health and Grave he conquered all three he said because I live you shall also live also so you shouldn't be sced of death in any day you should be ready because it can happen today or tomorrow any moment as brother Des always give an example that we were here with brother Daniel one Sunday the following Monday he was gone so we have to be ready no matter what we have to be ready and expect the coming of the Lord because he's the same yesterday today and forever amen our God is good we thank God for opening our eyes of understanding when he shut no one can open when he opens no one can shut and by his grace and mercy our eyes of understanding he has opened up at last amen and true jubilees this amen our God is great he's an awesome God he's the same yesterday today and forever amen so I'm going to conclude by saying that God has a purpose in Saving you and me he has a purpose in Saving you he has a purpose in Saving me and he didn't save us to let us drawn he didn't bring us this far to leave us he bring us to take us to all to himself to glory and he has a purpose in Saving you delivering you from alcohol delivering you from all kind of life and bring you to a New Found land who is the Holy Ghost himself and now he's the anchor he's the one that is leading us you are predestinated you are elected bride to receive this word for your day many even the prophets of they all long to have heard this but God preserved to his last day bride we should be encouraged by this have consolation absent from here presentence with the Lord Within tle of an hour you going to meet the Lord in the air there is going to be a meeting in the air in the street by by amen I'm going to meet you over there Hallelujah so let's be happy and glorify God knowing that one of these days we're going to be changed but I encourage you because there is not one thing left all the prophets the prophecies has been fulfilled for the left what the coming nothing but the coming of bride remember Israel types the bride and if you check I was listening to a thing yesterday that they have been what attacked by seven fronts heah Hamas h htis um in Yemen some of them in Iraq Iran people in Iraq all of them attacking Israel and if you see that there's attack on Israel naturally it means that a spiritual warfare on the bride and what should the bride do because everything that happens in the natural realm it takes place in the spiritual realm face so spiritually we have to be on the Forefront praying because our armor of defense is prayer that's the greatest weapon that God has given to the bride so we have to pray pray pray pray because there is a battle going on our eyes cannot see it spiritual but it's going on so we have to be prayed up and very soon as the biggest guess early us everyone is deserting them the prophet told us it's going to be a time that Israel will go along so is the bride of Christ there's going to be a time you're going to betrayed as Judas betrayed Christ so is Judas the Bible is going to betray the re the red bright so we have to be ready we have to be spiritual awaken and be conscious of what is going on and not to take things like Grace can you put me that one the one you put to back let me read it first and close with that you can't put it on okay that's fine so I'm just going to conclude to encourage us to know that our God loves us and he has opened our eyes of understanding when he shed it no one can open and when he open no one can s but to you it is given to know the mysteries of what the kingdom he has opened our eyes of understanding so you shall be thankful and praise th God Amen that's what I have for tonight amen okay let's pray oh our gracious Eternal God I'm so grateful I'm so thankful for everything you've done father I give you
