[2:02] amen
[2:06] i read our scripture
[2:09] in revelation chapter 3
[2:13] verse 10
[2:16] because thou has kept the word of my
[2:19] patience
[2:21] i also
[2:22] will keep
[2:24] thee from the hour
[2:27] of temptation
[2:29] which shall come
[2:32] upon all the world
[2:34] to try them
[2:36] that dwell
[2:38] upon the earth
[2:40] amen
[2:41] what a blessing
[2:43] to be even reading
[2:45] from this book
[2:47] and
[2:48] the to receive
[2:50] the
[2:51] light of understanding from the word of
[2:54] god
[2:57] because thou has kept
[2:59] the word of my patience
[3:02] i will also keep thee from the hour
[3:07] of temptation
[3:09] god is saying simply
[3:12] if you will
[3:14] i will
[3:16] he is saying
[3:17] if you will keep my word
[3:20] then i will stand
[3:23] uh by you
[3:25] i will you stand by my word
[3:27] and i'll stand by you
[3:30] you keep my word and i will keep you or
[3:34] preserve you
[3:36] through this time
[3:38] of temptation that is coming up on the
[3:41] face of the earth
[3:44] now we know and realize
[3:48] as i was just reading this morning of
[3:52] a new development
[3:54] of a
[3:56] beautiful motor car being made
[3:59] that can now go
[4:01] a thousand miles
[4:04] on one electric charge
[4:07] and
[4:08] it can do it at top speed
[4:12] we are certainly living in an age
[4:15] of speed
[4:18] and uh we see it
[4:20] in planes
[4:22] they're getting faster
[4:24] we see it in cars faster
[4:27] there we see it in the rockets
[4:29] they're shooting to the moon and
[4:32] everywhere that we can find
[4:36] and when we think even
[4:38] the blazing fast speed of our internet
[4:43] that we are receiving today we are left
[4:46] absolutely amazed
[4:48] by what we are beholding as we see
[4:52] prophecy
[4:54] being fulfilled
[4:57] taking place emerging
[5:00] right before
[5:01] our very eyes
[5:03] yes
[5:05] indeed
[5:06] we're living in an age
[5:09] of instant
[5:10] everything
[5:13] instant
[5:14] the
[5:15] we love in our day
[5:17] because of this
[5:18] motivation and this culture
[5:21] of speed and haste and hurry and hustle
[5:25] and bustle
[5:28] as the scripture prophesied that would
[5:30] be in this day
[5:33] that it shall come to pass
[5:36] men shall go to and fro to and fro
[5:41] god prophesied that already in his word
[5:46] prophesied in the book of daniel
[5:48] how there will be cars in the streets
[5:52] and they will be running on something
[5:54] called
[5:55] highways
[5:57] and they will have car lights eyes
[6:01] brighter than the eyes of dragons
[6:04] you see that's all they knew at that
[6:06] time so that's how they can express it
[6:09] but we understand
[6:11] that that prophet looked ahead in time
[6:15] and saw cars
[6:18] he said i see them jostling
[6:20] chariots jostling in the streets traffic
[6:24] jams
[6:25] men women running to and fro everywhere
[6:29] uh the bible tells us so we are living
[6:32] in an age of speed
[6:34] and of instant
[6:36] everything we have no patience
[6:39] we are in a hurry
[6:41] we want to get there fast
[6:43] we we we want to have our breakfast we
[6:47] oh we can't wait uh like the old days
[6:50] where they boiled oats or they boiled
[6:53] something and they have to wait and put
[6:56] in the spices and wait until it's done
[7:00] no we want to be able to quickly put
[7:05] some um cereal in a bowl
[7:08] pour some hot water on it and right away
[7:11] everything puffs up everything is just
[7:13] opened up and there you go you have
[7:17] instant cereal
[7:20] we want to have breads instant
[7:24] even our coffee no time to boil brew and
[7:27] all of that you know and even if we do
[7:30] say we brew it's a quick brew it's
[7:33] better be fast or it's going to be left
[7:36] right there none of this boiling and
[7:38] straining and whatever else and waiting
[7:42] for it to properly
[7:44] brew itself like that no
[7:46] we have to have it uh coming through a
[7:49] machine where we can have instant
[7:52] coffee instant tea instant hot chocolate
[7:57] everything has to be speed with fast why
[8:01] because we live in an age of constant
[8:04] pressure
[8:06] and pressure
[8:08] is upon us in every possible way
[8:13] and a pressure that we must let off well
[8:15] we as believers believe
[8:18] we let off that a lot of that pressure
[8:21] by our faith in the word of god
[8:24] and by prayer in the presence of god
[8:28] oh meditation in the presence of god
[8:32] we let we let off the pressure
[8:34] we heal our hurts
[8:36] and
[8:37] we let go our fears
[8:40] and all the things
[8:43] we forgive
[8:44] and free ourselves from the attachments
[8:48] of this life and of this earth
[8:51] and let off the pressure the bands of
[8:54] evil that tried to bind and constrict
[8:57] our minds and we are set free by the
[9:01] grace of almighty god
[9:05] god is saying in his word
[9:08] if you keep my word
[9:10] i will surely keep you
[9:13] oh my brother my sister friends wherever
[9:16] you are
[9:17] do all you can
[9:19] to read your bible read your bible pray

[9:37] revealed to you keep that and god will
[9:40] keep you as he has promised amen god is
[9:45] saying let me bring you into our time
[9:49] if you have safeguarded
[9:52] the word
[9:53] that you have received all believers of
[9:56] this message
[9:58] if you have safeguarded
[10:00] this message that you have received
[10:04] a man within your heart
[10:07] if you have driven away
[10:10] the birds
[10:12] on the
[10:13] on your hearts altar of sacrifice
[10:17] as our father abraham did
[10:20] these evil thoughts these
[10:23] uh demonic
[10:25] inspirations suggestions
[10:28] and evil
[10:29] that will come to your mind to drive god
[10:33] out of your thoughts
[10:34] to put the word out of your thoughts
[10:37] some trouble some trial some person that
[10:40] disturbs your peace of mind
[10:43] oh
[10:44] you stood by the word
[10:46] you stand by the word and god said if
[10:49] you drive the birds away
[10:52] if you cast away these things from your
[10:56] heart and cast your cares upon me oh
[11:00] praise god he'll stand by you heal all
[11:04] you
[11:05] in his mighty hand and preserve you and
[11:09] protect you in this time of trouble and
[11:12] trial he will keep you
[11:15] there in his great love amen
[11:19] god's word in us
[11:23] is a rich deposit of truth
[11:27] hallelujah
[11:29] which we have received from heaven above
[11:32] when we thank god for it amen hallelujah
[11:36] and god is trusting you and i
[11:40] as believers
[11:42] that we will keep
[11:44] and preserve the truth of god
[11:47] within our hearts
[11:49] and not lose it
[11:51] not lose it by the cares of life
[11:55] by the pull of prosperity
[11:58] not by the attractions of the and
[12:01] pleasures of the things of this world
[12:04] but that we keep the truth keep the word
[12:08] of god that god has placed within your
[12:12] heart and within your soul o blessed be
[12:15] his name don't you lose that pearl of
[12:19] great price
[12:22] don't you lose the pearl of great price
[12:25] but oh my friends
[12:27] this treasure we have
[12:30] of the rev revelation
[12:32] hallelujah of the word of god within
[12:36] your heart and within your soul
[12:39] god is saying
[12:41] hold on to this pearl of great price
[12:45] hold on to it
[12:47] preserve it keep it
[12:49] within your heart this treasure that you
[12:54] behold within our orton orton vessels in
[12:59] our bible we are told by the lord jesus
[13:02] christ himself
[13:04] how that a certain woman
[13:06] her husband
[13:08] went far away from home of course a
[13:10] symbolic type of the bride and jesus
[13:14] christ or you may want to say the church
[13:17] and jesus christ
[13:19] and the husband
[13:20] goes out of town
[13:22] as jesus has gone to heaven and left his
[13:26] bride behind
[13:27] and here she is
[13:29] she's keeping house
[13:31] and back in the eastern days
[13:34] look and maybe even to this day in some
[13:38] countries because of the culture
[13:40] instead of a ring on the finger
[13:43] there were
[13:44] a band
[13:46] of of coins
[13:48] on a chain
[13:50] on the top of their head
[13:52] on their forehead
[13:55] and the loss of one of those coins
[13:59] are to put it this way if that woman was
[14:02] found unfaithful unclean in any way
[14:05] the priest would take away one of those
[14:08] coins
[14:10] so that on his return
[14:12] when the husband comes he'll find one of
[14:15] the coins gone
[14:17] and realize what acts actually happened
[14:22] in his wife's experience
[14:26] in this case
[14:28] this woman lost the coin
[14:31] right in the church right in the house
[14:35] in her own house
[14:37] she lost that coin
[14:40] and god is saying to us
[14:44] keep the word
[14:47] don't lose the word
[14:49] don't drift from the revelation of the
[14:52] word
[14:53] but stank firmly by the truth until the
[14:56] crown you gain
[14:58] hold to the god's unchanging hand
[15:02] don't swerve to the left nor to the
[15:05] right
[15:05] but you're not your trust in kings
[15:08] horses rich men powerful men men of
[15:12] persuasion uh men of influence but put
[15:15] your faith in your trust in the
[15:18] unfailing realities of the revealed word
[15:21] of god for this day and time for let
[15:24] every man be a liar
[15:27] and let god's word be the truth
[15:32] this woman lost the coin
[15:35] the bible says she did not just sit down
[15:38] and weep and cry but she began to
[15:41] clean up her house as we ought to clean
[15:44] up our lives
[15:46] she started to scrub and
[15:48] and
[15:50] use her broom and dust and everything
[15:52] else searching for the coin wherever it
[15:56] might be lost wherever you might have
[15:58] lost some coin out of your experience
[16:02] out of your life your walk with god i'm
[16:06] praying and i'm asking god and i'm
[16:09] speaking to you now and saying oh my
[16:13] dear brother my dear sister may the holy
[16:17] spirit speak to your heart speak to your
[16:20] life and may you be able to recapture
[16:23] oh
[16:24] the fervency of your first love all the
[16:28] the graft the great desire
[16:30] that you have had for god the passionate
[16:34] love that you had for your husband
[16:37] christ the word may the great holy
[16:40] spirit of the living god speak to our
[16:43] hearts tonight and may he my friends
[16:47] bring us back to the place where we said
[16:49] lord i'll stand by your word and god
[16:53] answers if you will
[16:56] i will if you will stand by the word i
[17:00] will keep you i will preserve you in the
[17:03] hour of temptation that lies right ahead
[17:09] now what does the bible mean
[17:12] when it says
[17:13] the hour
[17:14] this word patience
[17:18] he says
[17:19] you know
[17:21] in hebrews 6 13 to 15 and i'd like to
[17:24] read that
[17:26] for when god made promise to abraham
[17:30] because he could swear no greater
[17:34] he swore by himself
[17:37] in other words he used himself as the
[17:39] guarantor there was no one else greater
[17:42] than he that could guarantee his word
[17:46] his promise
[17:47] what it is that he wanted to accomplish
[17:51] amen saying surely
[17:53] blessing
[17:55] i will bless thee that's a promise to
[17:57] abraham and to abraham's seed
[18:00] and multiplying i will
[18:04] multiply thee
[18:06] and so
[18:08] after that he
[18:10] abraham had patiently
[18:13] enjoyed he obtained the promise
[18:17] you see
[18:18] praise god the spirit of god is speaking
[18:23] about the word of god which is given to
[18:26] us
[18:27] but we must learn
[18:30] not to just rush around rush about
[18:32] expecting everything to happen instantly
[18:35] instant porridge instant ancestor prayer
[18:39] instant healing instant miracles we have
[18:43] gotten ourselves into a a cycle where we
[18:46] expect everything instantly and we do
[18:50] not give god the chance to work a
[18:54] miracle we do not or give ourselves the
[18:57] chance to become still that we might
[19:00] know that he is god oh my friends he the
[19:05] word of my patience
[19:08] keep the word of my patience
[19:11] and so we understand that this patience
[19:14] is speaking off
[19:16] is to have the patience to endure
[19:21] while you are waiting
[19:23] on the fulfillment
[19:25] of the promise
[19:27] that is within the word of god
[19:30] hallelujah amen oh my i tell you friends
[19:35] let us endure
[19:38] let us
[19:39] persevere
[19:41] let us hold fast
[19:44] and let us wait upon the lord that we
[19:47] might mount up in a rapture with wings
[19:50] like eagles hallelujah or praise god
[19:54] forevermore this is the way god teaches
[19:58] his people about patience using abraham
[20:03] as an example of how to endure
[20:09] and have patience
[20:11] wait for the promise that god will
[20:14] fulfill his word
[20:16] in a physical manifestation
[20:19] amen
[20:20] that's what we always want to believe
[20:23] instant everything when abraham could
[20:25] wait for 25 years
[20:28] before he could have the son of the
[20:30] promise
[20:31] when he could wait on god to fulfill his
[20:35] word listen friends every time we pray
[20:41] in this age
[20:43] the instant after we pray we expect a
[20:46] physical manifestation
[20:48] that her eyes can see we can feel and we
[20:51] can testify to that we got the answer
[20:54] when we breathe
[20:56] and we don't learn patience that way
[20:59] amen
[21:00] we could have more patience in life
[21:03] if we learn to wait on god
[21:06] in the book of hebrews
[21:08] chapter 11
[21:10] verse 17
[21:13] it reads
[21:15] by faith
[21:16] abraham
[21:20] when he was tried
[21:22] offered up
[21:24] isaac
[21:25] hallelujah you see he had
[21:28] patience
[21:30] and if you want to know more about
[21:32] patience
[21:33] you can listen
[21:36] or read
[21:38] the sermon
[21:40] the stature of a perfect man and have a
[21:45] full
[21:47] understanding
[21:49] on what patience is
[21:52] may god help us everyone here today
[21:56] and so after
[21:59] i want you to see this now
[22:02] after
[22:03] god fulfilled his promise he had waited
[22:06] for 25 years now here comes the son he
[22:09] has the son and after he has the answer
[22:14] to that promise
[22:16] in his hands god said go to the mountain
[22:20] sacrifice it
[22:23] sacrifice
[22:25] isaac
[22:26] the very thing you prayed for believed
[22:29] for endured for have patience for and
[22:32] now it's here and now god's asking you
[22:36] to lay it down at his feet once again
[22:40] and as humans many times you don't want
[22:43] to let go
[22:45] you just got the blessing you don't want
[22:47] to let go
[22:48] oh my you see abraham was tried
[22:53] after he received the word of promise
[22:58] most people think that before once we
[23:00] pray in the name of jesus over the
[23:03] promises of god that there could be no
[23:06] trial
[23:07] anymore
[23:08] after we receive our answer
[23:13] but the word tells us
[23:15] abraham was tried
[23:18] after
[23:19] he received the promise of god and that
[23:23] is exactly true just as it was with
[23:26] joseph
[23:27] that the bible tells us in psalm 105
[23:31] verse 19
[23:33] the word of the lord tried him
[23:37] the word tries the word will try a
[23:41] believer that way
[23:43] so that they can build up for their
[23:46] faith and their patience to be able to
[23:50] continuously receive great exceeding
[23:54] wonderful promises out of the word of
[23:58] god
[23:59] from time to time we pray
[24:04] and we get the answer
[24:06] but we must learn to receive patience
[24:10] within our souls
[24:13] and by patience we will be able
[24:15] to possess
[24:17] and control the life you now live on
[24:19] this earth
[24:20] and the life to come
[24:22] but with patience you possess your soul
[24:26] and we begin to lose
[24:28] your soul lose yourself when you're
[24:33] caught up in the the tizzy dizzy uh
[24:36] things of this life and you're carried
[24:39] away by them and you've come out of
[24:42] focus off center and your foundations
[24:45] are are shaken and you are left out
[24:49] there
[24:50] not certain of god
[24:52] listen my friends
[24:54] god says because you have taken my word
[25:00] and hereby you have become patient
[25:03] because you are held to the word and
[25:06] never swerved to the left and the right
[25:09] i will keep you
[25:12] from the hour of temptation
[25:16] which shall come upon the earth
[25:20] to try the purpose of that hour of
[25:22] temptation is to try
[25:26] them that dwell upon the earth my
[25:30] friends
[25:31] that is a promise
[25:34] that speaks
[25:35] about the ending of the gentile
[25:38] dispensation
[25:41] which will
[25:43] finally
[25:44] consummate or
[25:46] or uh
[25:48] it will come to its climax
[25:52] at that time
[25:54] through the bride being caught up in a
[25:57] rapture
[25:59] and when the bride is caught up in the
[26:01] rapture
[26:03] the tribulation officially begins
[26:08] because i believe
[26:10] as we talked before
[26:12] edges overlap
[26:16] and while one is coming in
[26:20] another is going out
[26:22] so while the bride is going up in coming
[26:26] going out of here the tribulation is
[26:30] coming in
[26:31] and when you look at the systems the
[26:34] events the atmosphere on the face of the
[26:37] earth
[26:38] you realize
[26:40] that
[26:41] the tribulation
[26:43] is already coming in
[26:46] its influences
[26:48] it's darkness
[26:50] it's penchant for sin
[26:53] for evil
[26:54] the poison spawning wickedness
[26:58] everywhere
[27:00] and at the same time
[27:02] the bride of christ
[27:05] these are they who washed their robes
[27:08] and made them white in the blood of the
[27:11] lamb and they will walk with him through
[27:13] this world in white even though that
[27:17] spirit of tribulation is already here
[27:21] and works and is working within the
[27:24] hearts and minds of the children of
[27:28] disobedience oh my
[27:31] and that is why god says
[27:34] terrible time is coming
[27:37] a time of trouble is coming
[27:41] a time of tribulation is coming
[27:46] a time of severe temptation is coming
[27:50] but you have my promise
[27:53] anchor your soul to the word of god
[27:57] if you have his promise
[28:00] you
[28:01] make him that type host of your soul
[28:06] oh
[28:07] the anchor of your heart
[28:10] so that when the buffeting and the
[28:12] trials and the tribulation and the
[28:14] storms of life will come you are
[28:17] anchored in jesus and the storms and
[28:20] temptations of life you'll brave amen
[28:24] you'll overcome because of his presence
[28:27] power in your life and in your the
[28:30] patience that you have to endure the
[28:33] mockings the scoffings and all the other
[28:36] things that went on you held to god's
[28:39] word you're holding to god's word and
[28:41] let us continue to hold to the promise
[28:44] of the word of god in the midst of it
[28:47] all listen to the word of god
[28:51] i will keep thee
[28:53] this is a promise this is god speaking
[28:57] this is not an earthly king
[28:59] not just any man speaking
[29:02] but the eternal suffering god
[29:06] is speaking
[29:07] and saying i
[29:09] with all my power with all the hosts of
[29:12] heaven with all the armies of god with
[29:16] all the supremacy
[29:18] i will keep thee
[29:21] from that hour of temptation
[29:24] hallelujah amen
[29:27] my friends
[29:29] many interpret that scripture
[29:33] to say the church will
[29:36] go through the tribulation
[29:39] but i'm here to disagree with that
[29:42] and to tell you
[29:44] the true bride church of jesus christ
[29:48] shall not go through the tribulation
[29:52] let me repeat
[29:54] their true elected bride church of jesus
[29:58] christ
[29:59] shall not go through
[30:01] the tribulation
[30:03] period
[30:05] for they missed it
[30:07] he did not say
[30:09] i
[30:10] will keep thee
[30:12] in
[30:13] the hour of temptation so that you can
[30:16] go through it
[30:18] but the scripture says i will keep thee
[30:20] from the hour of temptation
[30:24] you will not even be able to pass
[30:27] through that
[30:29] we will come right up to the tribulation
[30:32] we will come right up to that hour of
[30:35] temptation
[30:36] and when it comes and tries to overtake
[30:40] or take us up they're not going to close
[30:43] us up because we're going up in a
[30:46] rapture in grace of the lord jesus
[30:48] christ hallelujah
[30:50] this temptation my friend
[30:54] will be exactly like the temptation eve
[30:58] had in the garden of eden
[31:02] when she was tempted by satan
[31:04] not some figment of the imagination
[31:08] not some mythological being with a fork
[31:10] tail
[31:11] and horns
[31:13] but a a snake
[31:16] a character
[31:17] looking like a man
[31:19] but with the nature and spirit and
[31:22] cunning and subtlety of a snake
[31:26] he's a snake
[31:27] a liar murderer and cheat to begin with
[31:32] and we are supposed to be tested and
[31:35] tempted
[31:37] by that
[31:38] evil spirit being
[31:42] embodied in human flesh
[31:45] again
[31:46] meeting him meeting the church
[31:49] face to face
[31:51] to tempt her
[31:53] as he tempted eve
[31:56] the temptation then
[31:59] we will not now discuss
[32:01] but to show
[32:03] everything morphs everything changes
[32:06] everything progresses to its
[32:08] magnification
[32:09] and it comes to its fullness
[32:12] so when we look here in the word of god
[32:15] amen
[32:17] we find out
[32:18] that
[32:19] just as she was tempted
[32:22] by something that seemed as if it would
[32:24] give her more freedom
[32:27] and give her more
[32:29] light
[32:31] actually in fact
[32:33] it seems so reasonable to her
[32:37] and from the standpoint of human
[32:40] thinking it will seem to be so right
[32:44] and everything else so enlightening and
[32:47] life-giving
[32:49] that this time when satan brings it he
[32:52] will not just fool one individual woman
[32:55] but he will deceive the entire world
[32:59] but thank god
[33:01] these whose those whose names are
[33:04] written in the lamb's book of life from
[33:07] before the foundation of the world the
[33:11] bible says they shall not be deceived
[33:14] the bible tells us that it is impossible
[33:18] for him to deceive the elected
[33:22] now in the word of god
[33:25] the prophet of malachi 4 william marion
[33:27] branham
[33:29] by revelation
[33:32] through the anointing of the holy spirit
[33:35] has made known to us clearly
[33:38] how this temptation will come about
[33:42] and that is what i'm now
[33:46] presenting to you
[33:48] that you may have a crystal clear
[33:50] understanding
[33:53] that my friends
[33:56] this ecumenical move
[33:58] that has already started
[34:03] it seems like a blessed thing for the
[34:06] church naturally speaking
[34:09] it seems like a wonderful thing for the
[34:12] church
[34:13] beautiful
[34:15] it even seems
[34:17] on the surface as a scriptural thing
[34:21] that christians ought to want desire
[34:25] and follow
[34:28] but don't be fooled by it
[34:31] and elect will not be fooled by it but
[34:34] can see in it
[34:36] nothing but a trap
[34:38] that is set right there
[34:42] certainly
[34:44] they present themselves saying
[34:46] we want to
[34:48] be agents to fulfill our lord's prayer
[34:53] which when he prayed saying
[34:56] o father
[34:58] let them be one
[35:00] even as you and i are one
[35:05] you see
[35:06] they're they're believing by taking that
[35:10] scripture
[35:12] and then trying to get the church to
[35:14] come into one world church
[35:18] they will be fulfilling the word of god
[35:23] but but god
[35:25] doesn't need the so-called righteousness
[35:28] of man
[35:30] to fulfill or bring about his word
[35:35] i also want to point to the fact because
[35:38] they have no revelation of the true
[35:41] oneness of god
[35:45] their idea of having one world church is
[35:48] on a false foundation to begin with
[35:53] here my friends
[35:56] that there might be one
[36:00] we find out to accomplish that
[36:03] they will work themselves into a
[36:04] position
[36:06] to become politically strong
[36:10] while the elect is running from politics
[36:14] they are going to behind the scenes
[36:16] appearing religious but mingling and
[36:19] mixing and blending themselves into
[36:24] politics
[36:25] out there which the bible tells us and
[36:28] teaches us whoa
[36:31] politics is of the devil
[36:34] satanist behind it
[36:36] it's based on lies and deceit yes that
[36:41] is the word of god but they will mix
[36:44] themselves and are mixing themselves and
[36:47] are already
[36:49] mixed into politics in every
[36:53] way
[36:55] and they are growing themselves that
[36:57] they might become so strong in politics
[37:01] so that they may bring pressure
[37:05] on the
[37:06] governments of the world
[37:10] and cause them i use the word cause here
[37:14] but you can use the word and pressure
[37:17] them
[37:18] prod them
[37:20] or my friends
[37:23] push them
[37:24] as they did
[37:26] with the crucifixion of jesus
[37:29] to cause all men
[37:33] to join
[37:35] with her
[37:37] the false church
[37:39] the false vine
[37:41] the one world church
[37:43] yes
[37:45] and
[37:46] to join her
[37:48] directly
[37:50] or in
[37:52] directly
[37:54] by adhering
[37:56] to certain principles
[37:59] that they
[38:00] will lay out and draw up and and show or
[38:05] give to governments
[38:08] because as religious authorities
[38:11] they will present that
[38:13] to them governments will accept it
[38:16] uh because these
[38:18] are supposed to be religious authorities
[38:22] and they will have
[38:24] these governments
[38:25] enact them or pass them
[38:28] effectively into law
[38:31] so that they can enforce them
[38:35] so that no
[38:37] body no people no organization no group
[38:42] listen
[38:44] this is prophecy
[38:47] prophecy and progress
[38:49] this is the word of god fulfilling
[38:52] itself
[38:54] we're looking at it now and we look
[38:56] ahead and we see the
[38:58] ripening of the fruit until it rots
[39:04] no one will be recognized
[39:07] no group will be recognized
[39:09] as actual churches
[39:13] until they come under the direct
[39:17] influence
[39:18] of all the principles and objectives
[39:22] of this false church
[39:25] that claims to create a one world church
[39:29] so here we see a prophecy
[39:34] of church
[39:36] the church
[39:37] the world the
[39:39] world system of churches
[39:41] denominational churches
[39:44] rising to a place of political power
[39:49] so as to influence
[39:52] the law making
[39:55] and church recognition
[39:57] by their great power
[40:00] influence and pressure
[40:02] that they will and are bringing to bear
[40:06] upon various governments into the world
[40:09] but thank god
[40:11] the elect is not left in the dark
[40:15] for a prophet has spoken the voice of
[40:18] god for these last days
[40:20] warned us ahead of time
[40:23] shine the light
[40:24] in the darkness of his dizzy trap that
[40:27] he is setting to catch the
[40:31] those that are not watching what is
[40:33] going on
[40:34] we have been warned
[40:36] a light has been shined a light of
[40:39] prophecy from the mount of the prophet
[40:42] of malachi 4
[40:44] shining upon this
[40:46] wicked trap
[40:47] set my friend's hair upon the earth or
[40:50] in the ground oh but thank god the elect
[40:54] will not be fooled by leaves of religion
[41:00] spread on the ground cover that spot
[41:04] spread on the twigs and on the brambles
[41:07] as to make it look natural
[41:10] but the
[41:11] eyes of the elect
[41:13] on the inspiration and revelation from
[41:16] the word of god coming from the
[41:19] storehouse of the prophet of malachi 4 5
[41:23] they see the trap and they will not be
[41:27] deceived but they will hold to god's
[41:29] unchanging hand
[41:31] the church world
[41:33] is headed to religious domination
[41:37] church domination
[41:40] and their council their evil so-called
[41:43] council
[41:46] my friends will not allow
[41:49] little groups
[41:52] small groups
[41:54] who differ from them
[41:57] will lose their charters
[41:59] lose any recognition
[42:03] lose licenses
[42:05] lose rights and privileges
[42:09] there they will even come to the point
[42:13] of persecution which they will not call
[42:15] persecution they will call it keeping
[42:18] the law like they did when they
[42:19] crucified jesus they were crucifying a
[42:21] criminal they were just keeping the law
[42:24] but they were crucifying their word
[42:27] and here my friends
[42:32] they will come down to the point where
[42:34] churches will even lose their property
[42:40] they will lose spiritual rights
[42:45] and when i say lose spiritual rights
[42:47] they lose their spiritual rights to even
[42:50] speak to people about faith religion
[42:53] born again
[42:56] holiness
[42:57] jesus christ one god
[43:00] original sin
[43:02] the truth of god's word the trace and
[43:05] the serpent right down to his tricky uh
[43:08] business that he is doing in this hour
[43:11] you will lose your right to speak the
[43:15] truth of the word of god you will not be
[43:20] able to preach
[43:23] nor teach
[43:25] to other people
[43:28] the things that we have learned
[43:31] oh my friends
[43:33] as it was with the apostles
[43:37] so will it
[43:38] be with the bright church of jesus
[43:41] christ in this last day
[43:44] for as soon as they had the great
[43:46] revival up there at pentecost
[43:51] came out of pentecost walked into what i
[43:54] would say walk into a
[43:56] an eternal day the eighth day
[44:00] and as they walked out
[44:02] right in front of the church
[44:05] right in the shadows of the cathedrals
[44:08] there lay a man that was sick and
[44:12] crippled up could not walk god's way
[44:15] could not walk and he was
[44:19] they left him there a beggar
[44:21] passing in and out
[44:23] left him a beggar oh
[44:26] and he asked for help for peter and paul
[44:30] silver they said to him sir sir uh a
[44:34] copper a copper if i can have a copper
[44:36] well to show you these preachers were
[44:38] not uh preachers of great elegance
[44:41] dignity
[44:43] man of luxury man of money they said
[44:46] silver and gold we have none
[44:50] in other words listen sir we are broke
[44:56] shall i repeat that it's in your bibles
[44:59] in your scripture
[45:01] where peter and john said sir we are
[45:05] broke
[45:07] but such as we have we give to you in
[45:11] the name of jesus christ rise and walk
[45:15] hallelujah and you know the rest of the
[45:17] story the bible tells us that he leapt
[45:20] up he ran he shouted and the crowds
[45:24] began to gather and the news began to
[45:27] spread abroad of the mighty works that
[45:31] god has done for he like 40 years old
[45:34] and he was like that condition from the
[45:37] time of his birth and here he was
[45:41] shouting and running and praising god
[45:45] and the leaders the religious leaders of
[45:48] that day
[45:49] as will the religious leaders of this
[45:52] day
[45:54] while this word this
[45:56] message
[45:58] sermons of this character
[46:02] from not just myself
[46:05] many men of faith
[46:07] that stand by the word of god and the
[46:10] promised god of god for this hour
[46:13] we may even say things differently
[46:16] but we're looking ahead there's a
[46:17] rapture coming
[46:19] there's a tribulation coming
[46:22] israel's revival
[46:24] rise of the red heifer back to the third
[46:28] temple the power of god the coming of
[46:31] the lord jesus hallelujah second coming
[46:34] oh my friends i tell you great things
[46:38] lies ahead in these days that we are
[46:41] living in
[46:43] let's look to the word of god
[46:45] but just as they did to the apostles
[46:48] back there
[46:50] for setting the people free
[46:52] as we set people free by them coming to
[46:56] know the truth or have a revelation of
[46:58] the truth
[47:00] oh my what did they tell them they did
[47:03] not rejoice with them and say oh praise
[47:05] god people are are being set free their
[47:09] eyes are being opened
[47:11] god is revealing himself no
[47:13] they don't want you to see they don't
[47:16] want you to read your own bible for
[47:18] yourself they want to to
[47:21] interpret it for you and speaking in an
[47:24] unknown language or tongue
[47:27] and then you really don't know what you
[47:29] heard or what you receive
[47:31] my friends
[47:33] back then
[47:35] the bible said we can't deny that these
[47:38] things happened
[47:39] but all we can do is at least block them
[47:43] or stop them
[47:44] from going about preaching in the name
[47:47] of jesus
[47:49] so they're called the apostles
[47:52] and they issued that trust
[47:54] and that threat hangs about
[47:57] above
[47:59] the bride church of this last day like a
[48:02] cloud
[48:03] if it's not evident it's coming
[48:06] it's coming
[48:08] like the sick darkness of egypt it's
[48:10] coming
[48:12] the angel of death is surrounding
[48:14] everywhere
[48:16] don't you preach no more that one god
[48:19] doctrine
[48:20] don't you preach about
[48:22] eve in the garden of eden and her
[48:26] original sin that it was not her eating
[48:29] an apple but having sexual affair with
[48:32] the serpent who was in the form of a man
[48:35] until then he was cursed and be made
[48:38] into what we know as a snake
[48:41] oh god have mercy don't you preach such
[48:44] things don't you preach about one god
[48:48] when we are teaching uh that there is
[48:50] three and and miraculously they become
[48:54] one when the bible tells us hero is real
[48:58] the lord thy god is one lord one lord
[49:02] hallelujah and that lord that god
[49:06] made himself a flesh body
[49:09] not another god but he came into god in
[49:13] flesh appearing jesus christ the same
[49:16] yesterday today and forever to walk
[49:19] amongst men and be called emmanuel
[49:24] god with us oh blessed be the name of
[49:27] the lord so
[49:30] i'm showing from the word of god
[49:33] i'm preaching from the things that were
[49:36] left in the storehouse
[49:38] and i'm telling you that we will be
[49:41] obstructed hindered and even jailed
[49:45] for speaking
[49:47] the truth
[49:48] of the word of god that has been
[49:51] restored to us
[49:53] as the apostles were

[53:12] increases
[53:14] it'll be harder and harder
[53:17] for groups
[53:18] for individuals pastors preachers
[53:21] teachers evangelists to resist it
[53:25] anymore
[53:26] or else they will lose their privileges
[53:28] their tax privileges their religious
[53:31] privileges
[53:32] they'll lose it all
[53:34] it'll all disappear
[53:38] and so
[53:40] many will be captain
[53:43] i will keep thee from that hour of
[53:46] temptation
[53:47] that will come and is coming upon the
[53:50] face of the earth
[53:52] many will be tempted my friends
[53:55] to go along
[53:57] if you can't beat them join them that's
[53:59] what a lot of them will begin to think
[54:02] and so they will feel it's better to
[54:04] serve god
[54:06] publicly
[54:07] amen
[54:08] in the framework of that or coming
[54:11] organization
[54:13] than not to serve god at all
[54:16] publicly
[54:17] but they air
[54:19] they are in total
[54:21] spiritual and religious and christian
[54:23] era
[54:24] to the word
[54:26] they are like eve in the bible believing
[54:28] the devils lie
[54:31] oh my friends
[54:33] and they began not knowing that you
[54:35] already switched their service to satan
[54:38] appearing as an angel of religion of
[54:41] light and of god
[54:43] and they may even raise him up in the
[54:45] temple and worshipping us god even want
[54:48] to call him jehovah
[54:51] my but the elect will not be deceived
[54:56] those whose names were back in the very
[54:59] genes of god mine of god and are down
[55:03] here on this earth in a human body with
[55:06] divine purpose for the glory of god to
[55:09] bear witness to the promised
[55:12] word for this age
[55:15] for the
[55:19] the furthermore will be kept
[55:22] not just from the hour of temptation
[55:25] that shall be kept from
[55:28] the image of the beast
[55:30] amen
[55:33] because
[55:34] my friends that temptation will morph
[55:38] that temptation my friends will
[55:41] transform itself
[55:44] they try to transmute the old alchemists
[55:48] from dirt into gold they're going to
[55:51] transmute
[55:53] this movement
[55:55] of one world church
[55:57] into one world order
[56:01] one great
[56:02] image to the beast
[56:04] let's not speak of the image danielle
[56:07] saw those things you can do yourself
[56:09] searching in the word of god
[56:12] amen
[56:13] my friends coming that image comes with
[56:16] fullness
[56:17] and here it is that image erected to the
[56:20] beast
[56:22] it will not
[56:23] affect
[56:24] the bride of christ because he promised
[56:27] i'll keep you from
[56:29] not in or during but from the hour of
[56:34] temptation
[56:35] and so the bride will be caught up in a
[56:39] rapture
[56:40] in the presence of the lord all thanks
[56:43] be to god we already have an escape
[56:46] route
[56:47] we have my friends a way made for us
[56:51] we can start right now climbing jacob's
[56:55] ladder from earth to glory into the very
[56:59] presence of almighty god
[57:01] this delightful wonderful
[57:04] winsome moment of love when
[57:07] all my praise god when rahab met isaac
[57:12] in the fields here comes the bride who
[57:15] meets jesus in the air by his rapture in
[57:19] grace and power hallelujah brought there
[57:22] by the holy spirit amen let me tell you
[57:26] what started out as a little seed of
[57:28] evil in the in the ephesian age
[57:32] will now raise its head
[57:35] as the monster of satan
[57:39] to defile on his defiling and will
[57:42] deceive
[57:43] the whole world
[57:45] amen
[57:46] for the world system
[57:49] we see out there
[57:51] of the catholic church and the
[57:54] president's protestant church systems
[57:58] merging
[58:00] melting blending together
[58:03] forming this great monster
[58:06] and i tell you they will control
[58:09] the wealth of the entire world prophecy
[58:12] again from the prophet of malachi 4 5
[58:17] right straight from the storehouse
[58:20] amen yes sir they'll control the wealth
[58:25] of the entire world system hallelujah
[58:30] and that will be a trap
[58:34] because then
[58:35] men and women churches
[58:38] will be tempted
[58:40] by the religious
[58:42] recognition trap
[58:44] they will be tempted
[58:46] by their wealth
[58:48] trap oh
[58:51] the the
[58:52] the pull for them to
[58:54] join that system just let me attach
[58:57] myself to that system and i'll become
[59:00] wealthy and the wealth will pass through
[59:02] my life my hands let me attach myself i
[59:05] got recognition
[59:07] i'll be recognized you see the great
[59:10] hour of temptation
[59:12] by being with that system
[59:15] but let me tell you my friends
[59:19] that system will begin to kill them
[59:23] amen
[59:25] by refusing them privileges of buying
[59:27] and selling
[59:29] whereby they could make a living in
[59:32] other words it will kill them physically
[59:35] it will kill their businesses
[59:38] it also will kill out their churches
[59:41] it will destroy their way of making a
[59:44] livelihood
[59:46] yes
[59:47] this spirit is already here upon the
[59:50] face of the earth and beginning to do
[59:53] these things in such a cunning way on
[59:56] the different names that makes it look
[59:59] and seem reasonable and acceptable but
[1:00:02] it's a work of the devil it's satan
[1:00:06] already working and moving up on the
[1:00:09] face of the earth my friends yes
[1:00:14] rome already
[1:00:16] has acquired
[1:00:19] an israel
[1:00:20] acquiring
[1:00:22] most
[1:00:23] of the gold of the earth
[1:00:27] you say oh
[1:00:28] the church rome doesn't have it but let
[1:00:30] me tell you they're doing it under so
[1:00:33] many names like a hydra headed monster
[1:00:36] that you are not aware that they're
[1:00:39] sucking and vacuuming all the gold of
[1:00:42] the earth is going to roam
[1:00:46] yes
[1:00:47] and they will control all the supplies
[1:00:49] of gold
[1:00:51] and they're close to it if not already
[1:00:55] on the other hand
[1:00:57] the jews
[1:00:59] have all the bonds
[1:01:01] all the paper mortgages everything else
[1:01:05] in their system
[1:01:08] and we find out after a while rome
[1:01:10] wanting to have supremacy
[1:01:13] will begin to call in all the paper
[1:01:17] and began to demand
[1:01:19] gold
[1:01:21] oh my
[1:01:23] let me tell you my friends
[1:01:25] in other words they're gonna smash the
[1:01:28] present
[1:01:29] world money system
[1:01:32] and that's going to fall with a great
[1:01:34] crash
[1:01:36] but they have to have destruction before
[1:01:39] reconstruction
[1:01:42] and so they have to destroy it
[1:01:44] and they'll reconstruct it in their own
[1:01:48] image
[1:01:50] yes my friends
[1:01:52] oh
[1:01:53] and as that system falls
[1:01:56] i tell you
[1:01:58] with that system falling the jews jewish
[1:02:01] people
[1:02:02] will be trapped
[1:02:04] with all their wealth
[1:02:06] all their human wisdom they will be
[1:02:09] trapped
[1:02:10] but they
[1:02:12] will
[1:02:13] see it beneficial to themselves
[1:02:16] to come into an uneasy alliance
[1:02:21] with rome
[1:02:22] they won't want to do it
[1:02:25] they'll do everything to avoid it
[1:02:27] but they will come into an uneasy
[1:02:30] alliance
[1:02:32] with rome
[1:02:34] and then
[1:02:35] that harlot church called mystery
[1:02:38] babylon mother of harlots
[1:02:40] will take over the world
[1:02:43] she will take it over
[1:02:46] it's in your bible it's spoken
[1:02:49] by the 20th prophet 20th century prophet
[1:02:52] william marion branham
[1:02:55] in this day in this hour it's already
[1:02:58] been spoken
