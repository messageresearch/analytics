the Lord thank you Lord the last time we we met we promised that we're going to do a little study on tonight is study night amen so praise the Lord and we're going to do a let's study tonight taken from let's read our scripture tonight this study here tonight is the ancient Galilean wedding compared to the biblical Rapture and the marriage Feast of the Lamb amen praise God and taken from first Thessalonians reading from five to one amen Hallelujah but of the times and Seasons brethren you have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not Escape but ye Brethren are not in the Darkness that day that that day should overtake you as a thief amen Hallelujah that's all pray tonight gracious God and a Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for your love your grace and mercy towards

father that something may be said Lord to encourage a soul to oh God to do something special for them Lord father Lord Jesus we ask the Lord that you continue Lord to your presence to be amongst us Lord give utterance law to your word tonight Lord as we just do a little study in your presence Lord we thank you Lord as we commit all things into your hands in Jesus name we pray amen and amen you all may be seated tonight amen Hallelujah praise the Lord thank you Lord Jesus we see Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea to Mary and Joseph as his natural periods man say do he didn't come from from Mary but he was just he passed through Mary and they were just yet to nurture him and grow him up amen praise the Lord he grew up amongst the common folks and was very familiar with all the customs and culture of that time amen just as we grew up in any culture amen we get accustomed with the culture the language the environment and everything man Hallelujah a key to understanding the Bible is the fact that Jesus and his disciples were galileans except for Judas could you put slight tree from it please we see in John chapter 1 45 and 46 man Philip Fong Nathaniel and said unto him we have found him of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did right Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph and Nathaniel said unto him can there any good thing come out of Nazareth Philip said unto him come and see amen come and see amen so someone else have told you about the message a man testified to you a witness to you amen and you must have had questions in your heart amen any person invited you come and see for yourself amen amen is not what somebody else gonna tell you but come and have your personal experience Hallelujah praise the Lord and natanya said unto him can there any good thing come out of Nazareth amen Philip said to them come and see what did Nathaniel mean by that amen and I did a little research and read a few commentaries around along that subject man you see Galilee stood out from the rest of Israel they did not blend in well the region was viewed as remote away from the center of Jerusalem and those who have been in Jerusalem knew know that for a fact it's quite a distance away from Jerusalem itself which is very hectic and busy and all the Commerce and everything that is there amen hallelujah so when Nathaniel When Praise the Lord whenever he asks nathanielas you know could any good thing come out from that place amen because it was no entire region that the people were not well off common folks men Hallelujah they were not sophisticated amen hallelujah praise the Lord one author wrote the province of Galilee is spoken as having at that period one of the most obscure and despised of the Roman Empire another Nazareth has The Misfortune of Being represented as then as an insignificant Village whose inhabitants were ignorant and they were considered immoral by the by by their comparison to their teachings and whatever man Hallelujah so it was not like a known Factor among the people nothing good could come out from that place you know it's just like you know some cities being despised you know like the slums and whatever what what could come out from as we might say sometimes we might we talk about the queens or some other platter the world of country that you know they look down they look down on them Hallelujah now Jesus spoke to his disciples and to his congregation in the Galilean language and used as we may say simple down to earth illustrations to get his message and teachings across to the people amen hallelujah you see us follow as well fishermen farmers he grew up as a carpenter amen they were like you know come on folks amen so in the book of Saint Luke we read the Common People heard him gladly Hallelujah today we may say oh that's just a common bunch amen but Lord that Bunch that heard you when you were in the flesh the common people they heard you gladly the haughty the rich and many of those who would not hear you the king's the potentiates the priests of the day would not hear you but such people as us heard you receive your message here to the call Hallelujah you see what is hidden from the wise and the prudent the higher name mighty Hallelujah God reveal it unto babes and as such as we learn so if you have a receptive Heart Tonight God is willing to receive reveal himself to you Hallelujah blessed be his wonderful name thank you Lord Jesus you see he spoke in parables so the the the simple could understand a sore went for to so seen he spoke about a mustard seed he spoke about putting a whole piece of garment into a new piece of garment you see these people knew about all these things and they could understand the simple things not highfaluted language in Greek and this and that and all this my my and I have the people more confused they're speaking in a different language and expect you to understand who knows nothing about that language that's why it's happening we go to some recently to our church and they speak in the Latin and the what and whatever you can understand head no tale of what they're saying so you're more confused when you come more than when you went in men so whatever they say you're just received and that's what's happening out there the judge people just gobble up this thing and without researching it and searching it out for themselves for the truth men and the truth is going to set them free amen they're not teach they're not telling the people go search it out in the scriptures and they have their own scripture in order to back up for them teaching they change it around to suit themselves amen hallelujah Hallelujah blessed be his wonderful name Hallelujah one of the most prominent of the Galilean customs were their weddings man we see I believe before we perform this first miracle at our wedding and we see in the end before he left he spoke about wedding about bride being caught up with bridegroom and if we go to the Book of Revelation we see the same thing this started off in the Garden of Eden as a family husband and wife and it's going to be ending up as a husband and wife too Hallelujah glory amen thank you Lord Jesus Hallelujah you see the reality of the Rapture is foreshadowed by the ancient Galilean wedding traditions and I just gonna take you through a little bit of that here tonight and I hope you just grasp it and see how it just fits in right and that's why when Jesus Illustrated these things the people knew what he was saying man Hallelujah thank you Lord blessed be his name Hallelujah could you just take a side oh it's up already so the three stages of a typical Galilean wedding was the contract the consummation and the celebration and that could be breaking down broken down into very uh other parts amen and we'll go through them as we know it before our marriage in our customs we have an engagement and in those times they called it the contract a man and a woman is going to enter into a contract and that's what marriage is all about a man and a woman going to be entering into a contract I going to take this woman or the woman said I'm going to take this man and we're going to live the rest of our lives together no matter what happens This Modern Times And this custom started way back amen hallelujah and Jesus was accustomed to the traditional way that was happening Amen in a wedding that's why when you spoke as we're gonna see amen he typically typifies and he fit everything and followed what their traditional wedding system was all about Hallelujah we anointed he has the engagement or the best total between a Young Bride and a groom we see in the ancient Galilean wedding during this time a wedding was the biggest event for anyone and if I could go back to even to my country when we had a wedding you know I have to invite anyone and from the village you know or from The Villages are wrong every as long as they know there is a wedding in town they're showing up and your and you better have enough food it's not too little chickens and things it's cows and goats and chickens and the whole works and everything has flowing the liquids flowing [Laughter] my mind will understand that and some are you here going to understand it too amen really saying you know some people we had a teacher who was a fluid mechanic teacher and he used to hit the bottle regular so one day that took him out the students took him out for they had a graduation celebration right and you know they had a good time right and at the end of it he couldn't the teacher the lecturer he couldn't come out and they start to make it fun with him he said man you cannot hold your liquids you know it was too much for him fluids too much fluids he couldn't hold his liquid that's a joke my my praise the Lord you see whether you were invited or not everyone participated we know about that here you have to have special written invitation and you have to reply to that invitation before you could even enter it my but you know something we have an open invitation amen now we got to respond and after that invitation to this wedding man that we have been speaking so much about my but it's not just an Invitational Luna there's many other little things attached in the invitation that we're going to list just now Hallelujah Hallelujah the bride receives the proposal or the Covenant just as a young man would propose to a young lady amen hallelujah so she's been proposed to we accustomed to artists customary and I loved at these traditions and Customs has passed through to the ages in different cultures in different religions amen because I could remember when I went through this little study I could remember certain sectors or religious sectors in my country perform the same kind of a traditional rituals that these galileans were doing amen so these Customs were handed down men praise the Lord after the proposal amen and the Covenant gifts were exchanged amen Hallelujah and we might know it here at the Dory amen and they'll give that before it was an incentive right to know to the young lady that listen this man could take care of me my is our Lord able to take care of us amen some people only like the gift center but they don't like to give up they have a gimme gimme attitude amen hallelujah praise the Lord and we see that all are wrong the one the gifts they want all the money they want the house they want the land but they don't want to love the man they don't want to submit to him they don't want to have headship amen hallelujah amen hallelujah Glory glory to God thank you Lord Jesus you see God does not force himself upon anyone you have to be you have been given a choice man choose this day who you're going to serve when we talk about predestination and all this thing you see God already knew in his he already seen the past the present and the future and he knows what choice you're gonna make amen so when you already know it's not a program you to to accept him he know you have a free will you're going to love him and receive him amen worship Him amen that's why you place your name in the Lamb's Book of Life he note what choice that you're going to make amen and he placed a certain Joe machine as we listen and Sunday inside of you so that John C got to respond to that call when he makes it [Music] man that's why he said I ain't going to lose any because he knows it's he knows man that you must come Hallelujah thank you Lord see the bride needs to drink from the cup of wine for the Betrayal or the engagement to progress amen so she has to drink from this cup that's been presented to her at this time amen and you're going to see how the Lord portrayed that amen in the Last Supper slide number five please the groom seals with this when the bride knee drinks from this cup she accepts his proposal amen the groom sees with this you are now consecrated to me by the laws of Moses and I will not drink from this cup again until I drink it with you in my father's house you see at the Last Supper Jesus offers his disciples a cup of wine which symbolizes a New Covenant he had with them after the disciples drank from the cup in Matthew 26 29 Jesus said these familiar words to them as the traditional groom from the ancient wedding said to his bride but I say to you I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day I drink it with you in my father's Kingdom you see that this cup was given to his disciples to represent a new covenant a new contract symbolizing what the the traditional wedding in a Galilean ceremony was all about amen he would pour out his blood and propose an engagement by pouring and drinking the wine and giving it hit to his disciples at the Last Supper Jesus spoke as a bridegroom just as the ancient Galilean wedding bride sealed the betrothal by taking the cup of Joy which they call it men which was as Jesus said he took the wine amen just as she would take the cup of joy we partake in the New Covenant that Jesus gave us by taking it in communion the cup signifies the acceptance of his terms as a bridegroom man so when you accept him into water baptism all that is part of the Wings amen when he calls you you didn't choose him I know he chose you and you know as we say I choose Jesus as my savior you choose him to no is he made the choice it was his choice to you and it's only by Grace you save my Hallelujah praise be to the name of the Living God now the groom must live be betrothed his bride until the day of the wedding is consummated so we see after this little ceremony he has to leave what did Jesus we're going to call go into a little bit man next we see the groom prepares a new place in the ancient Galilean wedding tradition the groom will then leave the bride and go to his father's house amen you know I would have loved them do I like I like a ladies a diagram and show you these steps at these stages but I by God's grace I I wasn't able to do it and save it amen but God Knows Why so it's a little teaching if you have a tonight see some of your writing and stuff like that which is good for memory and to do a little comparison and a little study on your own too don't take it from my cell phone and you could go back and read it for yourself listen to this steps by steps and compare it how Jesus just went step by step that's why his disciples knew what he was speaking and all the people around him knew what he was speaking about because customary amongst them amen amen hallelujah Hallelujah in the upcoming months the groom will then add rooms to the father's house preparing a place for the bride you see in those days they had a communities or communes like we say so if you had one head of a household and children after them he just keep adding homes adding buildings adding and this was like a big Community family community I guess when you're going to Africa you see many like that everybody there's one that's how I believe how the the the live over there too and many other countries amen they keep adding because they have vast property and they just keep building building building so when Jesus said I go to prepare a place for your mind in the upcoming months wow amen hallelujah the the that prepare rooms amen prepare a place for the bride new furniture tables stools Etc he will prepare the wedding feast too with oil lamps with rocks amen that will be taking place in that new home now Jesus warned his disciples slight sick man in John 14 3 Jesus won his disciples prior to his crucifixion that he would have to leave them amen after the communion amen and he started to speak with them he said listen I gotta have to leave you alone guys I'm leaving you all but gives them this beautiful assurance that the groom gives the bride during the ancient wedding let us read it in John 14 3 and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am dear you may be also hope you're getting it my it excited me when I was doing this man praise God Jesus states that he will return and take his bride that's where he is amen where he is going to be you're going to be this introduces the Rapture to us amen that he will return for his bride and I love to say not bright wife amen hallelujah Jesus promises that you return for her Jesus tell his bride that there will be those and Earth that will not taste that but until the bride is reunited with the groom much has to take place the bride must prepare for the hour of the coming of the groom material and fabric must be bought for the wedding this took lots of time in the first century and the bride is to be pure and Vigilant as she waited for her groom regardless of how long it takes my you see the groom does not know that they are the hour Amen in their custom so if you have the bride we have the groom and we have the fathers the parents amen Hallelujah neither the groom a bright nudity deity hour the wedding would take place the bride always had to be ready this may seem a little bizarre but it's part of the ancient Galilean wedding tradition no one in entire town knew when the wedding would take place except one person the father of the bridegroom only Galilean weddings had this custom to them it was a surprise wedding the father makes the announcement and the day and the hour son go get your bride the father makes the final inspection to see if all is ready for the bride only he knows the day or the hour slide 7 Jesus tells us no one knows the day or the hour but concerning that they are now no one knows not even the angels of Heaven nor the son but the father only my in Matthew 23 36 man the bride and groom are yearning for what their Union amen the bride and grew my union for their Union but must wait for the father's call what a day that will be when my Jesus I shall see when I look upon his face amen the one who saved me by his grace hallelujah oh what a day of rejoice in that gonna be Hallelujah man are you yawning to meet him foreign Glory Glory you see the bride and groom are yearning for their Union amen our task is not to be focused on his return but to consider the preparations for the return of the groom to us amen we are always to be ready and be viligent and be pure you see the groom returns amen and they are in the ancient Galilean wedding traditions Scholars have found out that the hour of the wedding would be in the middle of the night and that takes me back to a young man I have attended many of those weddings back in my country friends and people from the neighborhood where we're at amen at midnight or close to midnight the bridegroom right they would come and most of the times he would come riding on a white horse well decked off and nice and and they were simple people and the wedding chariot was a heart what right and if we didn't have like electric lights and all these fancy lights we had because we call um take a piece of cloth stick it in a bottle with kerosene or some kind of oil or something and like that and I had that decorated all for lights to for them to to see where they were going at the night my and those weddings were at the middle of the night we can't see and I've witnessed many of them quite a few in my life my time amen so we see here in their Customs most of the times The wedding will at midnight Hallelujah praise the Lord remember the Lord that is why they needed oil in their lamps to be ready to be lit and the bride and the bridesmaid are to be redressed and ready amen the groom would come to his bride in the night the conditions for the bride was to always be pure and to sleep in her wedding dress and her bridesmaid was there to assist her when the groom comes unexpectedly an hour that they don't know up so they always had to be ready man Hallelujah will you be ready when Jesus comes will you be born again or washed in his precious blood will your garments be spotless will they be as white as snow would you I would ask that question would you be ready when Jesus comes amen hallelujah we sing it but we've got to live it amen hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus said his return is Aza teeth in the night amen Jesus warned his disciples to be ready for his second coming in in sec in first Thessalonians 5 1 and 2. just as the bride we are not to fall asleep spiritually as others do but to be pure and ready at all times because the groom will appear at any moment man in the ancient ceremony the father makes the decision he wakes up the groom and the groomsmen and say go get your bride now is the time he blows the trumpet because what we call the sofa so far and blessed to wake up the whole village the bride and her bridesmaid wake up and I and execute their preparedness from the Trump wakes up the bride and the tongue and only those who are prepared will attend the wedding my after a year or so awaiting amen preparing the bride and groom are finally together United forever the bride is then carried away in the to the Grooms amen lifted in the air oh my God [Music] the young man was either just put him on a horse or they put them on their shoulders amen or they have this this thing that's set up with poles put it both of them together and carry them through the village and to their destination to their home so when Jesus said we will be caught up to meet him in here they knew what he was talking about because I know about the Customs that were happening around them my mind escorted back to the father's Palace or place as all she had to do was to be ready men you see Jesus spoke about the ten brides and virgins amen here we see there were 10 bridesmaid man in the night they need to prepare themselves with oil in their lumps and waiting for the arrival of the groom and all of them amen supposed to be ready amen hallelujah but in the parable that Jesus spoke about five already and five want my they were occupied with other things amen they were distracted with other things amen Hallelujah that they were not prepared when that knock came when that voice was spoken there's a less time to move time to go man they were not ready amen I pray and and with all my heart that when that call is made every single one of us here tonight will be ready Hallelujah to take that flight amen hallelujah do you have that oil in your lamp man don't let it run now don't let it run down keep topping it up keep filling it up then hallelujah praise the Lord you see the father's house in the ancient Galilean wedding is where the marriage supper takes place my Hallelujah with all that have heard and beckoned to the call in the darkness of the night many will be left behind and the door will be shut to them and be out of the feast if you were locked out there was no getting in no getting it if you have been left behind if you weren't ready amen hallelujah amen you can't take that flight no it's preparation time amen now is the time to be ready man Hallelujah praise the Lord thank you Lord Jesus Hallelujah now the marriage takes the sorry the marriage supper takes place in the father's house so when we read in the scriptures amen hallelujah let us be glad and rejoice in slide nine and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife had made herself ready the marriage supper is not on this side the marriage supper is in him Hallelujah and you're not going in as they are just Brighton you go in India as his wife because no Hallelujah when I and I spoke on it before I mentioned it before the marriage takes place here the marriage takes place right here when you made that commitment to the Lord for him to be your lord and your savior and put a man your life in his hand amen say Lord I want you to be the head you made a commitment you made a covenant with him you made a marriage agreement with him you went in water baptism you took on his name when I'm in a natural wedding when a man when a woman marries a man and he takes her his name so when you took his name in water baptism amen hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus amen the marriage ceremony is here and then you have an intimate relationship with him amen the person that is growing inside amen the person that is going inside one of these days full manifestation Hallelujah is going to be revealed you're carrying something inside of you amen the man called Christ Jesus being born again in your heart and is coming to a maturity So when you say be perfect it's not this has to be perfect is that which is inside you is going to be perfect and made the full Perfection and manifestation Hallelujah and that's the parties coming forth Hallelujah and I'm going to conclude now it's a little study I mean I could have gone way more expanded way many more but I just don't want to give too much man in conclusion everything on Earth is a foreshadow of what is to come we are chosen as the Bride of Jesus Christ and we are meant to dwell with him for eternity the father's house in the Galilean wedding is the perfect picture of what heaven is going to be like The Father's House amen praise the Lord the groom goddess his bride brings her to the father's house for the marriage supper married forever many will be left behind in the in the Rapture and will be shot out of the marriage supper and be this time to God's Wrath and Earth therefore take it be pure be ready for the coming of the Lord is at man so let us be sad when you want to trap you I don't want to I want to see if you're still awake let us be glad and rejoice [Music] you should be rejoicing night and day as we walk this Pilgrim with Abraham was seeking a city whose Builder and maker was God amen amen are you seeking that City tonight amen are you excited to go to that City Hallelujah amen if you're not excited get excited man Hallelujah for their marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife had made herself ready so be ready or not he's coming ready or not amen hallelujah amen get ready Jesus is coming soon blessed be his wonderful name for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and the voice of the archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet our husband to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord were for Comfort one another with these words Hallelujah Hallelujah so this little study amen which I promise and it could have been much I didn't want to take too much and go into all the too much details but just wet your appetite a little bit Amen to see when Jesus spoke it sounds so simple come on what it means by that but they knew they knew what he was speaking about and they got excited amen hallelujah praise the name of the Lord Lord bless you all tonight for these few words amen thank you amen can't do it no go on go go dig in the scriptures man see yourself man it's put it with your experience the things that you go through and see it lines up you know so every day living experience with the Lord come on no big no Fancy
