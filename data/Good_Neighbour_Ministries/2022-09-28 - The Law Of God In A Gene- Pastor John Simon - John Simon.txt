have the rest of the week in front of us and I pray the Lord and bless you in every way as you approach the challenges and blessings of this week let's just pause for a minute and pray for the people in Florida where the storm is now going over them we know we have a lot of our churches and Brethren down there but regardless even if they weren't there we just pray for the people if they can't be saved spiritually at least may God save them naturally right now with the trials of life that they're going through praise God hallelujah our gracious Heavenly Father Wireless Tempest is Raging around around them while oh God the wild winds blow Darkness all around we see father those that did not heed the warning now being caught in the midst of all this but we plead and ask for mercy and Grace father uh as Jesus himself said father forgive them for they know not what they do may the great Holy Spirit now move over that region and watch over your beloved you're elected your true children your seed wherever they are father because there were so many lepers in Israel but Elijah only healed one so many sick were there but Jesus only healed so many the elect the flock of God amongst you granted father wherever they are that you will keep them preserve them and protect them and hide them in the cleft of the rock truly hide them Lord hide them till the Tempest be overpassed we give you glory and honor in Jesus name amen praise the Lord hallelujah may the Lord bless you out of the prophecy of Joel chapter 2 uh reading the 25th uh verse this is a well-known scripture and it reads and I will restore to you the years that the locusts had eaten and the conquer worm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you praise the Lord father we thank you for this the reading of Thy word we pray Lord now you would lead us into the things things of life and enrich us strictness father as we go forth back into this world with all of its strife and struggles and our lives to shine and to bring glory to you for we ask it in Jesus name amen the Lord bless you praise the Lord now this uh maybe a sermon that you may say I've heard it already but truly uh brother Branham said these things but he still left it uh left these things that these young men that he promised in this word in his prophecy that they will come and I'm only hitting the highlights but they'll break it down so that you'll have a better understanding praise the Lord so and because these things are not coming into their application right uh he was speaking and putting those things out some of which applied back then but in the spirit of Prophecy he was also putting out the word in every way that will apply to the lives of the elect for this hour amen so he's speaking about restoration and uh using Merriam Webster's Dictionary he asked uh what restore means what does it mean what does it mean and he says here now the the right definition for restore it means to return something back to its original owner amen praise God it also means to bring back to its former state foreign or bring back to its former condition then we can enforce a claim for something to be restored amen praise the Lord of course you do that if it belongs to you right if it belongs to you you force it to be restored back that's just a little definition of uh what restore means praise God then he goes to the fact that he's talking and he's saying well you know uh there's a brother the other day that lost his vehicle and he couldn't find it he didn't know where it was and so brother sutman and and some of the others four or five men they came to me and uh brother Branham what can we do he says well let's pray and he said we knelt and we prayed and pleaded this man's case before God Amen we do that right here in the prayer meeting and we see the hands of God praise the Lord Jesus amen and so I took the Word of Promise and sent it forth and the great Holy Spirit took that word and served as Solomons a vision then broke and I saw that man going towards Bowling Green Kentucky with a yellow shirt on driving the Holy Spirit Then Came Upon him and began to condemn him see and he turned around about halfway I saw him come back and parked that car on a certain Street over the river and I told them where it was and the the breadman I told him he said thus say it the Lord and they they started out on the road and there was the car accepting we're on the road there half empty with gasoline the amount they used up you know to drive around you see he says what was that what really was that what is it it was enforcing the claim it was saying to the devil give back that which you took or what he took away give back praise the name of the Lord see that is it what it's talking about when it says restore it's Satan is being told restore give back what you took away or tried to take away you see oh my now if Satan robbed you of your privileges amen and we as Believers have privileges from God in his word and we have got to enforce our claim because Satan is not just going to come and give it to you he wants to keep it as long as he can and if you don't go and say give me back what I had loose what I had loose that bag loose this hand it back to me restore it back and if it's a personal thing within your own self your mood whatever it is God wants you to be able to tell Satan let go and let me restore back to my former state my former condition that I was in I want the joy I want the peace I want the love I want the grace I want your hand on my life I want to be restored back to my former estate my former condition that I want to be in or praise God hallelujah amen you see when you do that I want you to know without being a son or daughter of God you have a right by the Holy Spirit to enforce the claim of God and bring it back hallelujah oh praise God if you're reflected you have the same right give me back my health what right you've got to hold on to my health when Jesus already the Bible says by his stripes we are healed when the lamb has already paid the price on the cross what right do you have to hold on to my healing hold on to my help my being what right of you to have this pain this ache whatever it is what right you have no rights because the lamb paid the price the lamb died for me and by his name by his stripes we are healed amen we are delivered him and we demanded so for the glory of God hallelujah amen yes sir you see you have that right as a son or a daughter of God amen if he's Afflicted you made you sick you have a right to enforce the laws of God by his stripes it says we are healed you have that right to to not just repeat the words but we're just I'm going to get to that in a minute you see now but the fact is we have the right you believe it I believe it we have the right to uh of course make that claim Hallelujah bring him back Satan turn us loose Satan you're you're trying to take him out yonder to death but reclaim him to come back in the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen and that's the right we have and that's right is being enforced by believers get away from this idea that the entire bride is going to enforce these claims that as a church the group is going to do it listen this thing is happening already and it's happening so simple and so humble if you're not watching it will go right past you do you know Believers are now raising the Dead but because it's not making a big splash it's a big advertisement and a big show nobody knows anything about and that member a Believer or Believers may not want to even tell anybody about it just want God to be glorified because if God knows the works that he is doing then God will take the glory and God will reward and bless that believer that saint that son that daughter that child of the Living God Hallelujah yes that is that's what I'm talking about enforcement Amen to restore things back to their natural condition again Hallelujah A Woman's Health restored back a man's health restored back a man is sick of baby is sick a woman may be sick they are out of their natural state they're out of their natural conditions Hallelujah then we have the right to enforce our Acclaim and bring them back to their original position for it already tells us by his stripes we are healed Hallelujah yes and you have a right to enforce that law you have a right to enforce that law and the law Giver the Holy Spirit himself is here the great agent of God and see it's done that way listen close now we the only way that he can walk work and this law can work is when you let him work amen and you've got to believe it for there is a law praise God if I ever get see there's a law and a law given almost amongst everything praise God everything has a law amen you know that over months we have been looking at the God's law of a seed right God's law of a seed well tonight I just want to say it this way or uh cause it to be this topic God's law in the gene amen one is a natural seed Genesis 1 11 every seed must bring forth after its kind Hallelujah now uh that's not just for the natural seed that was natural seed was only to show us the power of the law in a gene a person with the gene of God in them are the ones that have the right to enforce and claim that by the word of God for the promises unto you the word of God is unto you Hallelujah and only you with the gene life of God in you has the power to Quicken that word for the word to come to life and for the world to move and to bring to you that which you desire amen praise God now this is no formula that I'm giving here for power with God or spirituality it's either you have eternal life which is a gift of God or you're a church Gore uh you may be religious you may be in the message but if that life is not in you you're just a church Gore and you want to enjoy religious worship and religious readings and religious uh preaching and wonderful sermons and everything else that's marvelous wonderful but without the spirit of Revelation without being certain of God in the recognition of the gene or a peace of God is within you then you are just going through emotions and and things like that only the gene The Original Seed of God can be certain of his word certain of God certain of the claims and only they will have the right when they wake up to recognize that they are amateur amateur Gods common geodes the children of the most high with the right praise God Hallelujah to speak the word believe the word receive the promise of the word and force it in the name of Jesus Christ somewhere where brother Branham said he was in South Africa and looked through his his binoculars and there in his moleculars he saw the a lion had killed some animal but he said he hadn't completely killed it he deliberately left it so he could still jump and move but it couldn't get away or go anywhere because he was right there but was giving the Cubs to a chance to practice their hunting and he was looking through his glasses while the lion cubs are jumping on the thing and using their claws and everything else like that like they think that they are real lions and real hunters and everything else well it's like Zach brothers and sisters we are mini Gods Messiah X amen and God that let the prophet said Jesus didn't finish everything on the earth that he had to do before he left the first time he left some of that word to be fulfilled now in this hour this day that we are living in and you and I and those who truly believe are the ones selected for this time this purpose to fulfill the rest of the word amen hallelujah amen there's a law amongst everything do you know that even the fish has a law amen praise God Amen Hallelujah okay I'll leave that alone you see a fish can stand up here in water and he has a lot within him he could just let go and when he lets go of what's in him it can make him sink right to the bottom amen and he'll just let go Amen to the Bottom of the Sea and that even won't bother him a bit right it won't break one cell in his body doing that now you see if you try to do that that law is not in you Amen in other words what he's saying there you have a different law that law is not in you God didn't make you to be a fish but the law for whatever God Made You and place you don't hear for that law is already in you and that Lodge is trying to show us just like the fish is able to uh enforce that law in himself the law that is related to you is already in you and that's the law that you have got to allow that to work amen praise God hallelujah amen now that law is not in you it's not in our natural being for us to do that to go like a fish in that way you see you can't do it but a fish can do it because that law is in him how to deflate himself of air and such a way that he want was open you see he he is made that way already and he knows that he has made that way hallelujah what I'm saying is that people were believing all the time but and people were following the message all the time but we have come to know that the gene of God is in US we have come to know that the seed will bring forth after its kind we want to expand but you stop and think what the Jesus these seed we are seeds but he is the original seed look what came out of his life and every seed been forth after its kind so there's healing in you there's Deliverance in you that's casting out the devils in you oh there's power within you it's not some effort you have to put out some fasting or prayer to bring it down it's already in You by the grace of God is to recognize it Hallelujah the fish he says knows it and because he knows it it can work he begins to know it and it starts to work in him and takes him down amen praise God hallelujah oh praise God the fish doesn't have to go on exercise did the fish have to exercise his lungs to practice having his lungs inflate and deflate in the right way before he goes down no it's natural in him he didn't have to think about it he doesn't even think of himself that well I'm a fish I'm supposed to do that I'm sure if a fish could think that he wouldn't have to think that because he was mad that way and we weren't Dead The Way We Are Made We Are Who We Are by the grace of God Paul said I am what I am by the grace of God it's nothing that we do or I can do but it's what he has done what he is doing in us and through us for his own Glory hallelujah amen hallelujah what's that fish now that fish before he goes down to the depths of the ocean he has to go over to Neptune University and study is that right he goes there to study how to inflate and deflate before he goes to the bottom of the ocean no no no no no no no it's natural to him it's automatic to him that life is in him to cause him to be able to do that whenever he wants for the glory and praise of God hallelujah now Prophet is using fish and so on like that but these are all types and shadows that he is literally using for those who are supposed to see we'll see and who are not supposed to see and understand well not see and understand they'll think it's childishness they'll think it's nothing to that or some imagination what are you talking about Hallelujah but he's trying to get us to clearly see not the law in a fish not just the law in the natural seed but the law that is now working in the genes in the seed of God there's a law working for his glory and for his honor Hallelujah oh yes we see it now for that law was in Christ Hallelujah that law was in Christ now the law is in man amen now you see he's speaking but he's speaking General right now that's General uh if if people want to take that and just take it generally but we know now what he was talking about the law has now come and it's now in man it's found the genes it's supposed the the people it's supposed to be in and the genes are there in the earth amen you can bury that man to the deepest grave you can put him to the deepest sea hallelujah or the lowest hell there's a law of the spirit of God in him that will raise him up again Hallelujah That's the Law of the spirit of God in a form of a gene hallelujah amen given to each elected person to raise them up again we have a guaranteed Resurrection because of the presence of the gene of God or the seed of life that dwells within us for his glory and for his honor praise the name of the Lord amen hallelujah amen praise God so anyone that knows or certain that they have that Gene of God within them has a right to enforce their claims you have a right to enforce any claims you see in the word amen because we have boundaries amen praise God I told it so many times but I'll tell it again it's just a natural thing where in the early days in Pentecost you know uh Faith was something you just talked about great faith and this brother was saying Oh Brother Simon I really believe in God for a car I got to get a nice brand new car and then he was in we were done in the marketplace because we were preached everywhere preaching in the marketplace and he went and he saw a beautiful car that's the car I like he laid his hands on the car oh God I claimed this car in the name of Jesus then he heard a voice saying get your cup which is hand off of my car how could God give you a car that you already gave me right see he had the wrong idea of what it is to take the word and claim what you are but when that law of God is in you it directs you it guides you and takes you to what is yours you see when that law amen praise God when you say law is it the word amen it was the law in the Old Testament is the word over here so don't get mixed up by him going back and forth using that word amen now we know that this is how it is that once that spirit that law of that spirit of God is in you that will raise him up again what's going to raise him up my mind is not going to raise himself up but the the spirit Paul causes the quickening power is already there and because it's there doesn't matter if you die proven by the typology of Elisha when he was dead and the true man a dead man in his grave and he dropped on the body of Elijah and the Bible says he bumps right out of the grave and started running amen why because he there was life in the quickening power the law of life was still in the bones that were laying there in the graveside and I believe that same law of life is in every one of us here tonight every believer every true seed of God wherever they are if they're truly believe it and God catches something in your heart where you're certain and no not a fanatic but you are certain of God hallelujah then we find it begins to work through you becomes activated was laying in you all your life but only on potential amen the potentials of God but now everything is coming into acting everything is coming into life everything is coming in the movement for the glory of God hallelujah now he said do you know that a bird also has a love amen now its body is material it's but it's EarthBound and it sets on the earth here but yet it knows that it has a law already within it that when it is ready it can spread its wings and fly out the sight oh I hope you are becoming conscious of that fact that you have you know already that that law is in you and whatever you you're ready that you can take your flight amen not in the natural air but you can be caught up with the Lord and meet him in the air praise the Lord for his glory amen you see that's against all their science amen that's uh they will say it's Earthbound Hallelujah they will say gravitation can hold it back here but with that it can defy gravitation Lord of God hallelujah with God's life God's seed in you you can defy gravitation not to put on a show but when God is ready he will break every gravitational pull and take us out of here amen you see because it already has the right you've got the right within you already to lift itself right off of that and go right on out because it has to put that law that's in itself to work and it's built that way to possess that law amen aren't you glad with God made us that way that we were purposed by him for his glory now we have also Allah I believe that we have a law and that is the law of life within us the only thing you have to do amen you see you've made and born and he already placed us here in the body of Jesus Christ as sons and others of God so then if you know that you don't have to knuckle down to the devil anymore amen he can't turn it back you already songs you are ready daughters you are ready children he can't turn it back no matter what trial whatever situation he brings towards you amen don't you knuckle down to the devil because we got a law in us hallelujah that law of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah the only thing you have to do is to know how to know how to let go and let God have his way let the gene go to work let go and let God have his way you see but you keep fighting it you keep fighting it and when you do that it will never work it won't but when you let go and let God Rest in him then it'll go to work praise God hallelujah amen praise God I thank God now just think of it he says here if that little fish says oh wait I've got to exercise I've got to catch my breath real good let me breathe in a little oxygen Let Me In Me and see if I can go down and if he does that it won't work he'll burst right open because he's not certain you're not confident amen see now what if that word was to say Amen oh I'll see how fast I can run on the road down here and maybe I can run so fast that I'll take off oh my I wonder if I could be really successful here if I could really run on the earth and become so successful until I'm ready no amen see he won't do it he'll fall down he's got to know amen oh my he's got to know how that law in him can control him amen praise God and the same way it is with us it isn't what we fight it isn't us pulling right it isn't us worrying right oh or if this don't happen if I don't get this if I don't get that it's just to know that the law of life is already in you and then let go and let God work amen hallelujah then when you do that he will take you to your healing if you do that he'll take you to the baptism of the spirit or anything he has promised in his word for them claims he is given them to us and by letting go we are letting God take us to it amen let go and let him take you to it praise God for all my I know I've preached on these things from different angles and different ways but we see now the clarity because we go back and read some of these messages read before but the Bible becomes like a new Bible even the message becomes like a new message you start seeing all kinds of things in it that God had there all the time but you couldn't see it before the time now is the time and the word is making itself clear amen praise God oh my it's just like you see letting go and letting God you know praise God letting Gene go and let God work through it if an officer was to take a fellow who stole your property taking him to jail and you kept pulling the officer back saying well I don't know whether he should you should do this or do that you see you don't do that let the officer just do his job let him go let him do his work praise God amen so just say what you want and then let the officer do his work amen that's the way you do it praise God oh my God will rise up within you and he will do his work praise the Lord O praise God now we're going to touch on this again next week and from a different angle because we're going to start talking about uh how the the Sun the the rising of the Sun how that forces or enforces the claims through the law that God already put there in the sun to force everything to come back to life we'll talk about that next week by the grace of God but tonight we just touched on the law of God working with that Gene amen God's word the gene is part of the word and the full all the rest of the word it's all one together and one can always touch the other one can always enforce the other and we give God glory and praise amen hallelujah may the Lord bless you all uh tonight praise the Lord and straighten you and Quicken you and let's pray that God will grant us the word for Sunday I really need that a God will bless us this I hope this will just refresh you that you can go out this week and when the devil tries to talk to your mind you can enforce your claims is that right praise the name of the Lord God bless every one of you praise God hallelujah brother Bill brother Bill thank you praise the Lord shall we all stand how gracious God and heavenly father thank you for these faithful here tonight in the Simplicity of the moment may the great Holy Spirit take his word and apply it to the heart and the minds of all the hearers here tonight online wherever they are

and praising your name in worship on Sunday morning as we lift holy hands without wrath and doubting giving praise and honor and glory to God in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen God bless you
