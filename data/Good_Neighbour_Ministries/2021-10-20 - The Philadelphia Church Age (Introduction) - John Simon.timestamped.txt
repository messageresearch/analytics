[4:06] we will approach this marvelous subject
[4:09] of the philadelphia church age
[4:13] and our scripture is found in revelation
[4:16] chapter 3
[4:18] reading from verse 7. let's read
[4:21] together
[4:24] and
[4:25] to the angel of the church in
[4:28] philadelphia
[4:29] right
[4:31] these things said he
[4:33] that is holy
[4:36] he
[4:37] that is true
[4:41] he that had the key
[4:44] of david
[4:47] he
[4:48] that openeth
[4:50] and no man shattered
[4:53] and shattered
[4:55] and no man open it
[4:59] i know thy works
[5:01] behold i have set before the unopened
[5:04] door
[5:05] and no man can shut it
[5:08] for thou hast a little strength
[5:12] and has kept my word
[5:15] and has not denied
[5:17] my name
[5:20] behold
[5:22] i will make them of the synagogue of
[5:25] satan
[5:27] which say
[5:29] they are jews and are not
[5:33] but do lie
[5:35] behold i will make them to come
[5:39] and worship before thy feet
[5:42] and to know
[5:44] that i have loved thee
[5:48] because i was kept the word of my
[5:50] patience
[5:51] i also
[5:53] will
[5:54] keep thee from the hour of temptation
[5:59] which shall come
[6:00] upon all the world to try them
[6:04] that dwell
[6:06] upon the earth
[6:09] behold i come quickly
[6:11] hold fast which thou asked
[6:15] that no man take thy crown
[6:18] him that overcome it
[6:20] i will make a pillar
[6:23] in the temple of my god
[6:26] and he shall go
[6:28] no more
[6:29] out
[6:30] and i will write upon him the name of my
[6:34] god
[6:35] and the name of the city of my god
[6:40] which is
[6:42] new jerusalem
[6:44] which cometh down out of heaven from god
[6:48] from my god and i will write upon him my
[6:52] new name
[6:54] he that had an ear to hear
[6:57] let him hear
[6:59] what the spirit set unto
[7:03] the churches
[7:06] now philadelphia itself
[7:09] was 75 miles
[7:12] south
[7:13] of sardis we've just finished the sardis
[7:17] church age
[7:19] and uh as we explained
[7:22] these church ages were a microcosm or a
[7:25] like a little nursery for the seeds that
[7:29] were beginning at that time
[7:31] of the world that would mature
[7:34] in these last days
[7:36] and we have just gone through sardis
[7:38] now
[7:39] we are at the city
[7:42] of philadelphia
[7:44] which prefigures the church age of
[7:47] philadelphia
[7:49] of course it was the second largest city
[7:54] in lydia
[7:55] and built
[7:57] upon many hills
[8:00] and was famous
[8:03] famous for what
[8:05] it was famous
[8:07] for being a wine growing district
[8:12] and its coins bore the head
[8:16] of the god
[8:18] bacchus
[8:19] and the
[8:20] priestess
[8:22] bakanti
[8:26] of course was a priestess of bacchus
[8:31] this city was peculiar
[8:33] because in particular this city
[8:37] was populated by jews
[8:41] and also
[8:43] by christians
[8:45] of jewish descent
[8:48] then
[8:50] it was also populated by
[8:52] converts many converts
[8:56] from heathenism
[8:58] and paganism
[9:01] this is
[9:03] a city that suffered also
[9:05] from many
[9:07] frequent earthquakes now i'm laying the
[9:09] foundations for what will be taught for
[9:13] the rest of this church age so let us
[9:17] place our hearts and our thoughts and
[9:19] minds on these facts receive them
[9:22] and see later what we'll be able to
[9:25] express from them
[9:29] even though this city
[9:31] had many earthquakes
[9:33] do you know that it's the longest
[9:36] uh existing city among those seven
[9:41] cities
[9:42] because right now the city still exists
[9:47] but it exists under
[9:49] than the turkish name
[9:53] alas here
[9:55] or
[9:57] city of god
[10:00] oh my
[10:02] it's a city that minted its own coins
[10:07] and the minting of the mintage of that
[10:09] city
[10:10] suggests
[10:12] the deity
[10:14] of the city tobacces in other words the
[10:17] god
[10:18] of that city
[10:20] was bacchus
[10:22] and his priesthood priestess
[10:24] baccante
[10:26] now of course
[10:28] bring back to your memory
[10:30] backus is the same one as nina's
[10:36] which is the same
[10:38] as saying nimrod
[10:41] let me repeat
[10:42] bacchus is nimrod
[10:45] that we read off
[10:47] in the book of genesis
[10:49] in our bible
[10:53] now this was a peculiar coin
[10:57] they minted their coins as many nations
[11:00] do
[11:02] with a face or a name or some other
[11:05] important object on that coin
[11:09] in this case
[11:11] they minted the coin
[11:13] of court with two sides
[11:16] backless
[11:17] on one side
[11:19] and
[11:20] his priestess or and prophetess
[11:24] bakante
[11:26] on the other side
[11:29] this is certainly something we ought to
[11:32] pay some attention to
[11:35] because really if you threw that
[11:37] coin
[11:39] in the air and fell to the ground it
[11:41] didn't really matter
[11:43] which side
[11:44] of the coin was showing
[11:47] whether bacante or bacchus
[11:50] for he was the leading
[11:52] one behind the scenes and before
[11:56] in the front of it also and behind it
[12:00] therefore it didn't matter
[12:03] whether the face of bakante showed
[12:06] or the face of bacchus shown
[12:09] because he
[12:10] backus was still
[12:13] in control which of course this as a
[12:16] pre-figure
[12:19] or pointing to
[12:21] the
[12:23] rhombish
[12:24] religion
[12:26] of jesus
[12:28] and mary
[12:30] jesus on one side mary on the other side
[12:34] but really my friends
[12:37] as we look at it we'll find out
[12:39] that this not only speaks of rome
[12:44] as one city one place
[12:47] or one religion but it speaks of the
[12:50] great harlot
[12:53] spoken of in revelation
[12:58] and this
[12:59] harlot certainly had daughters
[13:03] because they were produced by her
[13:06] harlotry of our fornications
[13:10] and she became a mother
[13:14] her daughters are now
[13:17] coins of of the same mintage or as we
[13:21] say chip
[13:23] off of the old block
[13:26] on one side of the coin
[13:29] they'll worship and talk about the
[13:31] worship of jesus
[13:33] but on the other side of the coin
[13:36] they'll be stressing the worship of mary
[13:40] and it comes back to the same things
[13:43] for
[13:44] when they
[13:46] give the worship of jesus
[13:49] but yet distressed the worship of mary
[13:54] and her creeds
[13:56] not jesus's teachings
[13:59] but her
[14:00] creeds her
[14:03] dogmas
[14:05] hard balls
[14:07] our tenants
[14:10] and then turn around
[14:13] and sell them to the people
[14:18] deceiving them
[14:22] that by keeping these tenants these
[14:24] dogmas
[14:25] they would enter into salvation
[14:29] insisting
[14:32] that she
[14:34] mary alone
[14:36] has the true light
[14:39] contrary to the word of god
[14:42] contrary to the bible
[14:46] how remarkable
[14:47] that that age
[14:50] was
[14:52] characterized
[14:53] by the coin
[14:56] for the mothers and daughters are doing
[14:58] the same thing
[15:00] they're all buying their way into
[15:04] trying to buy their way into heaven
[15:09] they're using
[15:11] the purchase price of
[15:13] money
[15:14] and not blood
[15:16] they will enter by
[15:18] how much
[15:19] monies
[15:20] they give and spend
[15:23] for good works
[15:25] rather than by
[15:27] the blood of jesus christ
[15:30] that was shed for our salvation
[15:33] and given for our sins
[15:36] for he was wounded for our
[15:38] transgressions he was bruised for our
[15:41] iniquities
[15:43] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[15:46] him and by his stripes
[15:49] we
[15:50] were healed
[15:52] we are healed
[15:54] we are delivered
[15:56] we are saved
[15:58] because
[15:59] of his great sacrifice
[16:02] at mount calvary
[16:05] now they've changed the
[16:08] uh price tag
[16:11] the price tag is no more
[16:14] the sacrifice
[16:15] of jesus christ
[16:18] but my friends no more that
[16:21] the price is based on money
[16:26] money and not
[16:28] the power of the holy spirit
[16:32] and so
[16:33] we see here
[16:35] the god
[16:36] of this world
[16:38] maman
[16:39] has blinded
[16:41] their eyes
[16:43] and if the blind leaders lead the blind
[16:47] jesus said they will all fall into the
[16:51] ditch together
[16:54] these dealers
[16:55] in debt
[16:57] d-e-a-t-h
[17:01] they're dealing death they are merchants
[17:04] of death my friends they are traffickers
[17:08] in sin and suffering
[17:11] and divert the people away from the word
[17:14] of god
[17:16] but thank god their dealings will end
[17:20] soon
[17:22] for soon that great city
[17:25] of mr babylon
[17:27] the city that sitted on seven hills
[17:30] and one hour the bible says
[17:33] she'll be birthed
[17:34] and the
[17:35] merchants
[17:37] and the rich
[17:38] of this earth will wail and scream and
[17:42] cry
[17:43] because of her passing
[17:46] oh it will be sudden judgment upon her
[17:50] it'll be the hand of the mighty god in
[17:53] christ
[17:55] amen
[17:56] and soon their dealings will be over
[17:59] for this is the age when the spirit of
[18:02] god cries out behold i come quickly and
[18:07] we answer and say even so
[18:10] come lord jesus
[18:14] now
[18:15] you say brother simon
[18:17] how long
[18:18] did this church age of philadelphia last
[18:24] it lasted
[18:26] from the year 1750
[18:30] to 1906
[18:33] which is approximately 156
[18:37] years
[18:39] the meaning of the name of that city
[18:42] is
[18:44] the city of brotherly love
[18:47] philadelphia
[18:50] which
[18:51] uh means
[18:53] love
[18:54] of the brethren or love of the brethren
[18:57] so the city
[18:59] of brotherly love
[19:03] now each age
[19:06] that is featured
[19:08] explained and revealed to us
[19:12] has a messenger
[19:15] you cannot have an age
[19:17] without a messenger sent from god
[19:21] to unfold the word to display the spirit
[19:25] to make known his mighty name
[19:29] in this age
[19:31] that
[19:32] messenger's name
[19:34] is
[19:35] john wesley
[19:39] john wesley was born in epsworth
[19:42] june
[19:43] 17
[19:45] 1703
[19:48] and he was one
[19:50] of 19 children
[19:54] of his mother
[19:56] susanna
[19:58] wesley his father's name being samuel
[20:04] his father was a chaplain
[20:06] in the church of england
[20:08] but
[20:10] wesley's life
[20:12] was not really influenced by his
[20:14] father's
[20:16] uh
[20:17] teachings
[20:18] uh religious leanings
[20:21] it was mainly influenced
[20:24] by his mother's susanna by her
[20:28] exemplary life
[20:31] a life of modesty a life of holiness
[20:36] a life of prayer
[20:38] a life of sacrifice
[20:41] a life of dedication
[20:43] oh what a woman
[20:45] anointed of god used of god
[20:49] may she be a marvelous example
[20:52] in the bible we may have sarah
[20:55] oh we may have many others with
[20:58] exemplary life
[21:00] in our time through these ages we've
[21:03] seen many other wonderful women of god
[21:07] and amongst them
[21:08] susanna wesley
[21:11] a woman of exemplary life and character
[21:16] that influenced
[21:19] the life
[21:21] beliefs
[21:23] and actions
[21:24] of her son
[21:26] you see mothers
[21:28] you have a wonderful ministry
[21:31] you may not go to a pulpit as the bible
[21:34] tells us clearly she shall not teach nor
[21:37] usurp authority
[21:39] amen god's word said so
[21:42] now
[21:43] she may not preach teach
[21:46] like that from a pulpit
[21:48] but her life
[21:51] is a talking
[21:53] chip
[21:54] to her children
[21:56] her testimony her teachings her examples
[22:00] her advice her wisdom
[22:03] oh what a wonderful marvelous
[22:06] opportunity
[22:08] of you my blessed sisters
[22:11] in molding
[22:13] in shaping
[22:15] and forming those uh beautiful
[22:19] uh and marvelous impressionable children
[22:23] into the image
[22:25] and stature
[22:26] of the perfect man
[22:28] christ jesus
[22:32] john was a brilliant scholar
[22:36] and
[22:37] he did his scholarship most of his
[22:40] scholarship
[22:41] at oxford
[22:44] uh himself and charles
[22:48] and they joined up with a group that was
[22:51] really spiritual young men
[22:54] praying together fasting together
[22:57] seeking god together searching the
[23:00] scriptures together finding the truth
[23:03] amen
[23:04] not going to make doctrines but
[23:06] searching the word and
[23:08] drew and so while they were doing that
[23:11] they drew up a guide for themselves
[23:16] a spiritual guide
[23:18] of works
[23:19] and faith that they should do and one of
[23:22] them was to do giving to the poor
[23:26] to visit the sick
[23:29] and the fatherless
[23:31] to visit the prisoners
[23:34] was because they had it
[23:37] written up and drawn up that this is
[23:39] what they all agreed to do
[23:42] they were called
[23:44] methodist
[23:46] methodists so this is where the the the
[23:51] name of methodism came from
[23:55] and it was used
[23:57] in terms
[23:59] of derision
[24:01] it is not something
[24:02] us today
[24:04] when one say oh i'm a christian there's
[24:06] a pride
[24:08] that goes along with that it wasn't so
[24:10] in the book of acts they had to hide
[24:13] they had to run they had to be in fear
[24:16] of their lives they were sought out to
[24:19] be tortured
[24:20] and the name christian was a derisive
[24:24] term
[24:25] oh
[24:26] now methodism back then was a derisive
[24:31] term they were mocking them putting them
[24:35] down
[24:36] for what they were doing but today it's
[24:39] name
[24:40] full of religious pride oh i'm a
[24:43] methodist
[24:44] i'm a free methodist i'm a grace
[24:47] methodist i'm uh whatever amen in that
[24:51] way
[24:52] let's back to the original back to your
[24:55] face back to the word of god back to the
[24:58] way god has called you amen the original
[25:02] way amen you may call it primitive but
[25:05] may god help us if we could just
[25:08] recapture primitive christianity like
[25:11] paul had like peter had like philip had
[25:15] like stephen had stand on the word of
[25:19] god until the crown you of life you gain
[25:22] amen praise god
[25:25] no now wesley
[25:29] was a very much
[25:31] much imbued with a vision
[25:35] and a call of god
[25:38] and the hunger to reach the lost
[25:41] and so he traveled to america
[25:44] and went to the state of georgia
[25:47] there to preach the word of god as a
[25:49] missionary among the indians
[25:53] but
[25:54] his time there
[25:57] was a total failure
[26:00] but while on his trip to america
[26:04] he met some people called
[26:07] moravians
[26:09] and was so impressed
[26:11] with their
[26:13] sense of peace
[26:15] and godliness
[26:18] and meekness
[26:20] and courage
[26:22] in all circumstances
[26:26] and so
[26:29] he said i went to america
[26:33] to take the gospel
[26:36] and now i return to england crying
[26:40] i went to america to convert the indian
[26:43] indians
[26:44] but oh
[26:46] who shall convert me
[26:48] this
[26:50] is what john wesley
[26:52] said
[26:54] now he's back in london
[26:57] back in london
[26:59] he again met some moravians
[27:03] and peter pohler showed him
[27:08] the way to salvation
[27:11] and he was truly born again to the
[27:14] dismay of his brother charles
[27:16] but lit who became angry with him but as
[27:20] he began to see the word of god he
[27:23] himself became converted by the great
[27:27] holy spirit
[27:29] amen
[27:30] so wesley now began to preach the word
[27:33] of god
[27:34] he began to declare the gospel in those
[27:38] pulpits and churches
[27:40] that were open to his access
[27:44] but after a while they soon threw him
[27:47] out he was put out of those churches
[27:50] couldn't preach there anymore wondering
[27:53] to know
[27:54] what he could do with his life
[27:56] but he soon received an invitation from
[28:00] his good friend george whitfield
[28:04] who invited him to come go preach with
[28:08] him
[28:10] george richfield
[28:12] was not preaching in churches so much
[28:15] he was preaching in the outdoors
[28:17] and thousands would come to hear him and
[28:20] it says to this move of god
[28:23] he invited john
[28:26] wesley
[28:27] john wesley was at first incredulous
[28:31] he couldn't believe what was happening
[28:34] there was the bible bible days were here
[28:37] again
[28:38] and when he
[28:39] began to preach
[28:41] and god's holy spirit began to move in
[28:45] such a wonderful way amen he began to
[28:48] see the working of the holy spirit of
[28:52] the living god
[28:53] amen and he turned wholeheartedly to
[28:56] preaching the gospel in the open air
[29:01] now
[29:02] the work began to take on such
[29:04] proportions
[29:06] that he began to send out
[29:09] a lot of
[29:10] his
[29:11] men and followers
[29:13] to preach the word
[29:15] it seemed like another pentecost was on
[29:20] the scene again oh god may we have
[29:24] another pentecost may we have another
[29:28] ministry of christ among us hallelujah
[29:31] amen
[29:32] the spirit of god began to raise up men
[29:36] overnight
[29:38] overnight and they began to preach the
[29:41] gospel
[29:42] doesn't tell us they went to the bible
[29:45] college they did not tell us they went
[29:47] to oxford or somewhere else but they
[29:50] preached the gospel as the spirit struck
[29:53] their soul
[29:55] amen hallelujah
[29:57] amen and the spirit began to attempt to
[30:00] teach them to preach the word it seems
[30:03] like overnight
[30:04] amen
[30:05] of course
[30:07] violent opposition started
[30:10] from the
[30:11] various
[30:12] uh
[30:13] powers church powers
[30:16] that be of that time
[30:19] amen
[30:20] and the spirit of conviction
[30:23] through john wesley's ministry
[30:27] seems like a return to pentecost
[30:30] the spirit began to strike the people
[30:33] while he was yet preaching
[30:37] and
[30:38] it seems like their knees would become
[30:40] weak
[30:41] and they would fall to the ground
[30:44] crying out or in distress
[30:47] over their sins
[30:49] i'm not talking now about the religious
[30:52] show
[30:53] i'm not talking now
[30:56] about uh copycat ism
[30:59] i'm talking about the genuine presence
[31:02] of the living god
[31:04] oh my that would strike the people amen
[31:08] and they'll fall under the influence of
[31:10] the holy spirit
[31:13] now wesley was an extremely strong man
[31:18] he slept no more than six hours a day
[31:21] he rose up and went out and preached
[31:24] every day as far as we know of his life
[31:28] from five o'clock
[31:30] in the morning amen and he would preach
[31:34] four times in a single day year after
[31:38] year
[31:39] so that we know that year after year he
[31:43] would preach
[31:45] hundred sermons or more
[31:48] think of it
[31:49] the man was anointed and blessed by god
[31:54] given supernatural strength to be able
[31:57] to accomplish this
[31:59] but not only that
[32:01] he traveled for thousands of miles
[32:05] and he did it on his
[32:07] his fateful horse
[32:10] of course you know one time his horse
[32:12] got
[32:13] seemingly sick fell to the ground and
[32:15] couldn't take him on the circuit john
[32:18] wesley did not hesitate he anointed his
[32:21] horse with oil laid his hands on the
[32:23] horse and
[32:26] called it back to to health and life and
[32:29] the horse rose up and wesley went on
[32:33] with his ministry truly a wonderful man
[32:36] with the miracle ministry and gifts of
[32:40] the holy spirit which are denied by many
[32:43] in this our day and in our time
[32:47] he sent out also
[32:51] many circuit riding
[32:52] preachers
[32:54] the various outstations
[32:57] to go spread the gospel of jesus christ
[33:01] hallelujah
[33:03] it is said he traveled 4
[33:08] 500 miles
[33:10] each year
[33:12] by horse
[33:14] think of it that was the age of the
[33:16] horseback uh now they had gone through
[33:19] the bicycle but now it was the horseback
[33:22] uh the other ages of the airplane and
[33:24] the rocket that was still to come but
[33:27] here it is my friends
[33:29] he was a believer in the power of god
[33:32] hallelujah he was a man that prayed for
[33:36] the sick and sought with great faith and
[33:40] received wonderful results may god help
[33:44] the methodists of this hour to have that
[33:46] kind of faith amen to believe the holy
[33:50] spirit and believe the living god would
[33:53] so stir them with so anoint them so use
[33:56] them like they use this wonderful man of
[34:00] god that god used in many of his
[34:03] meetings
[34:05] wesley
[34:07] saw the manifestation of the nine gifts
[34:09] of the holy spirit in his life
[34:12] which is denied
[34:14] or you'd be thrown out to some of those
[34:16] churches if you were going to some of
[34:18] them that call themselves real
[34:20] methodists they'll throw you out of
[34:22] there but thank god there's still a few
[34:24] a faithful few among the methodists in
[34:28] this modern age that holds to god's
[34:31] unchanging hands of of health of
[34:35] holiness of his faith of his word and
[34:38] are pressing on the upward way new
[34:41] heights they're gaining every day amen
[34:44] wesley was never in
[34:46] in favor of organization
[34:51] his associates
[34:53] did have a united society
[34:56] but wesley did not believe
[34:59] in organization
[35:01] this united society was a company of men
[35:05] having the form
[35:07] and seeking the power of godliness and
[35:10] united together in order to pray and to
[35:14] receive the word of god for exaltation
[35:18] and to watch over one another in love
[35:22] that they may help each other
[35:25] to work out their salvation with fear
[35:28] and trembling
[35:31] hallelujah
[35:32] now wesley recognized
[35:36] that after his death
[35:39] then the movement
[35:41] that
[35:42] had followed him would be organized
[35:47] and the spirit of god would leave them
[35:50] with a dead form i believe that has
[35:53] happened
[35:54] they've left with the form of that he
[35:56] left that left with the skeletons that
[35:59] he left
[36:00] but not with the meat
[36:03] of the uh on miracles and manifestations
[36:06] of the ministry that god flew through
[36:10] this marvelous man
[36:13] of the living god
[36:15] listen
[36:16] he once remarked
[36:18] i do not fear the name
[36:20] methodist
[36:23] that it would ever leave the earth
[36:26] but i fear that the spirit might take
[36:29] its flight
[36:31] oh my god i believe the spirit of the
[36:34] living god has taken its flight from
[36:37] what we call
[36:38] modern methodism
[36:41] during his
[36:43] lifetime
[36:47] wesley
[36:48] estude wealth
[36:50] he bypassed it
[36:52] he did not look upon it as something for
[36:55] him to run or chase after
[36:59] but he did have a saying
[37:02] that is known to this day
[37:05] to real
[37:06] christians he said and let me say it
[37:11] get all you can
[37:14] save
[37:16] all you can
[37:18] and then
[37:19] give
[37:20] all you can let me repeat
[37:24] john wesley said
[37:27] get all you can
[37:30] save all you can
[37:33] then give all
[37:35] you can
[37:37] oh how strange
[37:40] if wesley were to come back in our day
[37:44] and see the denomination that bears his
[37:47] name of methodist today they're
[37:50] certainly not poor
[37:53] they're certainly not walking away from
[37:56] the things of the riches of this world
[37:59] they are rich they are endowed with gods
[38:03] but as the scriptures as miserable naked
[38:07] and noise now that you're blind lukewarm
[38:10] and far from the truth that this man
[38:14] preached out of the word of god
[38:17] oh my the life and the power of the holy
[38:20] spirit as it was in the life of john
[38:23] wesley is missing in their midst today
[38:27] oh may god help just a few men just a
[38:31] few women just if some methodist
[38:34] somewhere because wesley would turn in
[38:37] his grave if he could see what he's
[38:40] seeing happening today oh god rise up on
[38:43] your generation let there be a wave of
[38:46] the holy spirit across the hearts of the
[38:49] people that they may recognize that you
[38:52] are the same yesterday today and forever
[38:56] and would return to their roots back to
[38:58] the word of god
[39:00] back to the root of david may they bear
[39:03] the fruits of god's word through really
[39:06] spirit anointed and spirit given
[39:09] ministry amen
[39:12] wesley
[39:13] never desired
[39:15] to build any work
[39:18] on a denominational or sectarian basis
[39:23] although he was an armenian in his
[39:25] beliefs
[39:27] he did not want to separate his brethren
[39:30] from his brethren
[39:32] on the grounds of the doctrines that he
[39:35] was teaching neither do i
[39:38] amen
[39:39] all of my brethren
[39:42] i'm in love with all of my beloved
[39:45] brothers and sisters in the various
[39:47] churches denominations wherever whoever
[39:50] they are i may not agree or espouse what
[39:53] they may believe or may teach
[39:56] but we are together brethren and we must
[40:00] hold to god's word and his unchanging
[40:03] hand
[40:04] amen more praise god let's base our
[40:09] eternal life upon god's word faith
[40:13] and works
[40:14] amen
[40:16] living the life of christ
[40:18] rather than accepting a creed a dogma or
[40:22] some doctrinal statement
[40:24] now in closing let me say to you
[40:28] john wesley died
[40:31] at the age of 88 years old after all
[40:35] that writing and preaching
[40:38] and and the strength of the man
[40:41] preaching
[40:42] living working
[40:44] teaching the word of god he died at 88
[40:48] years old having served god as few men
[40:52] can or would dare to think they can and
[40:56] i say to you
[40:57] i salute
[40:59] john wesley god bless him god rest his
[41:04] gallant soul may god bless all those who
[41:08] follow his teachings which points right
[41:11] back to the bible back to the word of
[41:14] god back to the original
[41:17] faith back to the book of acts back to
[41:20] the upper room may the holy spirit
[41:23] galvanize and magnetize the mind the
[41:26] heart and the life
[41:28] and practice

[41:32] the word of god here today may god bless
