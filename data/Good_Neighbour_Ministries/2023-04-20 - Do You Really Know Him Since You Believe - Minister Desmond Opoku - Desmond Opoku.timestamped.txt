[27:30] Matthew Saint Matthew
[27:33] thank you Lord
[27:36] now in the morning as you return onto
[27:41] the city
[27:42] he hanged
[27:44] and when he saw a victory
[27:47] in the way he came to it and find
[27:51] nothing there on but lives only
[27:55] and said unto it let no food grow in
[28:00] grow on tree henceforward forever
[28:04] and presently
[28:07] the fig tree
[28:09] waited away
[28:14] and when the disciples saw it they
[28:17] marveled saying how soon is the Fig Tree
[28:20] wooded away
[28:24] Jesus answered and said unto them
[28:27] very I say unto you
[28:30] if you have faith and that not
[28:34] you shall not only do this which is done
[28:37] to the Fig Tree but also if you shall
[28:41] say unto this mountain
[28:44] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[28:48] the sea it shall be done
[28:51] and all things whatsoever he asked you
[28:55] shall ask in prayer believing he shall
[28:59] receive
[29:00] may the Lord add his Blessing to the
[29:03] reading of his word
[29:04] you may be said see that Hallelujah
[29:11] this is this was a a marvelous
[29:14] story
[29:16] that we read there
[29:20] the event happened when he was working
[29:24] with his disciples along
[29:27] the road
[29:30] and the Bible said he was hungry
[29:35] to find something to eat by they
[29:37] couldn't find nothing
[29:40] and when that thing happened
[29:42] remember that he was he was working with
[29:46] his disciples
[29:48] that they've been with him for a long
[29:50] time
[29:51] day in Day Out
[29:56] Hallelujah
[30:00] day in Day Out
[30:02] they saw so many things that the Lord
[30:06] Jesus Christ did
[30:10] but they still couldn't and couldn't
[30:13] understand
[30:14] why why that thing happened so fast
[30:18] before that
[30:19] he has 10
[30:22] 5 fishes
[30:24] then bread for the people to eat he walk
[30:28] along the sea
[30:31] he spoke to them so he spoke to the wind
[30:34] the wind stopped
[30:36] for all these things here they couldn't
[30:40] they couldn't understand so my topic
[30:44] today is
[30:46] do you really know him since you believe
[30:51] it's a question do you really know him
[30:55] since you believe
[30:58] we know we've been here for a long time
[31:02] so many years 30 20 40 whereversoever
[31:07] but I believe by this time
[31:12] everybody understand who the Lord Jesus
[31:16] Christ is
[31:17] you know
[31:22] the the Lord Jesus Christ will make a
[31:25] statement right there
[31:27] he said
[31:32] very I say unto you if you have faith
[31:34] and don't that
[31:37] that
[31:39] that is the key faith and that
[31:44] faith is of god that is not of God
[31:48] if you dab God you cannot receive
[31:51] nothing
[31:53] why do people why are the people in the
[31:56] presence of Lord Larry night and day
[32:00] after afternoon morning and everything
[32:03] May distilled
[32:07] lack
[32:09] sometimes wisdom and understanding of
[32:12] the word of God with so many years why
[32:16] we can ask ourselves why
[32:20] the same thing happened to the disciples
[32:22] they saw so many things let's talk about
[32:25] the the disciples that time we can say
[32:29] oh
[32:33] that time they were living off
[32:36] from the presence of God
[32:39] the Holy Ghost was not given yet
[32:42] so they were living for what they see
[32:45] what they saw
[32:47] every day in their lifetime
[32:50] but right now
[32:52] the Holy Ghost is given
[32:55] so there is no excuse
[32:58] so it's very very very very very
[33:00] important
[33:03] you know you cannot get nothing from God
[33:07] for dieting
[33:09] nothing
[33:13] because
[33:15] God he said only believe all things are
[33:20] possible and he may declare
[33:23] if you have faith
[33:26] and you tell this monkey to be moved and
[33:29] you don't doubt it will happen
[33:33] so
[33:34] this word here
[33:37] is the key word faith is the key word
[33:40] brother that is poking
[33:42] that faith is the one that is taking us
[33:45] home
[33:46] so if you know you are lack for some
[33:50] faith
[33:51] please
[33:52] the time is approaching
[33:57] why the people lack of faith because
[33:59] they do not stay in the presence of God
[34:03] lack of prayers
[34:05] lack of fellowship with God hallelujah
[34:10] you need to have fellowship with God
[34:15] you cannot you can you will not you will
[34:19] not know God without talking to him
[34:23] because you can see me here you can see
[34:26] me every day without having fellowship
[34:28] with me you see me brother Desmond you
[34:31] don't know me
[34:32] the only person who knows me well well
[34:35] is Sister Elizabeth
[34:39] Hallelujah
[34:41] she know the food that I like
[34:45] she knows my footsteps
[34:48] the Lord would want you to know his
[34:50] footsteps
[34:52] he loves you so much
[34:55] Hallelujah
[34:56] our God is good
[34:58] thank you
[35:01] this brethren
[35:03] saw so many miracles
[35:06] but they fail to recognize who the Lord
[35:10] is
[35:12] so when that thing happened what
[35:14] happened because why because they were
[35:17] adapting they don't have fully
[35:20] understanding of who he is
[35:23] so they depend upon what it did what he
[35:26] do he does daily
[35:29] Hallelujah but we don't depend upon what
[35:33] he does say that the Holy Ghost is in us
[35:35] already
[35:37] hallelujah thank you Jesus
[35:41] they failed to recognize him
[35:45] thank you Lord
[35:47] that statement that he made was
[35:50] was very very crucial faith and that
[35:55] Hallelujah
[35:58] as human
[36:01] we live
[36:03] in the spiritual relief two things faith
[36:07] and that
[36:09] either you believe God or you don't
[36:12] believe God
[36:14] in your soul what do you have there
[36:18] faith and that
[36:21] that we know that is
[36:24] not of God
[36:26] God is faith
[36:28] Hallelujah
[36:30] thank you Jesus the dance is the enemy
[36:34] either you believe that of faith
[36:40] you know
[36:43] Abraham
[36:45] through faith
[36:48] he begot Isaac the promising
[36:52] he never
[36:54] staggered started with
[36:58] with that
[36:59] he hold on
[37:02] as we always said
[37:05] Abraham
[37:07] he was so old
[37:10] nobody would like him what kind of
[37:11] regular could he imagine somebody who is
[37:14] about maybe 90 years old right now
[37:19] as we always said how can that 90 year
[37:22] old man can have a baby you you think
[37:25] about it even me now 66 or something I
[37:29] don't desire to have a baby
[37:31] I have all already
[37:35] and about 90 years old
[37:39] with a woman maybe 75 years old
[37:43] but he held on Step By Faith Abraham
[37:46] received the promised son
[37:49] Faith he never adapt he believed when he
[37:53] met God know what time he ever adapt
[37:57] the word of God is absolute
[38:00] you take God you live you reject God you
[38:04] die
[38:06] and we thank God the mercy and the grace
[38:09] of God he as far we have found Grace in
[38:13] his sight and we are sitting here glory
[38:15] to God not so many people has that
[38:19] glory to God not so many people has that
[38:25] Abraham believed God and it was counted
[38:29] unto him for a righteousness
[38:34] thank you Lord
[38:36] maybe I cannot read this Roman Roman 4
[38:40] 20.
[38:54] Roman 4 20.
[39:00] mm-hmm
[39:06] he is staggered not at the promise of
[39:10] God through unbelief
[39:14] he is Target not
[39:19] at the promise of God through unbelief
[39:25] but was strong in faith
[39:30] you know unbelief can cause your big
[39:32] trouble you will never receive your
[39:34] promises
[39:35] Hallelujah
[39:40] but was strong effect giving glory to
[39:42] God and be fully persuaded that
[39:48] what he had promised he was able to
[39:52] perform
[39:55] God has promised us that we are going
[39:59] through rapture
[40:02] so that promise
[40:04] God speak once I always say
[40:07] he can speak and come back and speak
[40:09] another thing he speak once and that's
[40:13] it he promised us already
[40:15] and thank God
[40:19] he has ordained us
[40:21] it's not our own work
[40:24] here ordained us
[40:27] whether you like it or not you ordain
[40:29] you
[40:32] so you have to stay with the word of God
[40:37] the word of God is real
[40:40] it's not just you see everybody come and
[40:43] stand here don't think he just stand
[40:46] here just like that God ordained that
[40:49] person to stand here
[40:51] whether you like it or not I'm I'm
[40:53] standing here
[40:55] whatever comes from my mouth
[40:58] as I pray and God give me the message so
[41:02] I have confidence for what I'm speaking
[41:04] right now
[41:06] because you have to know that every
[41:08] preacher does stand on the pulpit bring
[41:13] forth the word of God he's going to
[41:16] answer one day
[41:18] and that person that preacher have to
[41:20] know that the people that is speaking to
[41:23] is God children
[41:25] you cannot fool around
[41:27] you have to be serious because it's life
[41:30] and death
[41:31] is somebody's life somebody's salvation
[41:36] Hallelujah
[41:37] I tell you I struggle I pray almost one
[41:41] week to bring this message
[41:44] was not easy but I was happy
[41:48] that God put something in my heart to
[41:50] share with my brethren it will encourage
[41:53] us to even one step
[41:56] we are not we are moving forward
[41:59] Hallelujah
[42:01] it's a precept upon precept
[42:04] Hallelujah

[1:20:07] Hallelujah
[1:20:33] zechariah's the priest the husband of
[1:20:35] her cousin he doubted that same Angel
[1:20:38] when he said after the days of the
[1:20:40] administration at the temple he would go
[1:20:42] home and live with his wife Elizabeth
[1:20:45] and she'd bring his son and he said I'm
[1:20:47] too old it can't be done oh he just
[1:20:50] doubted it and he had Abraham and Sarah
[1:20:52] to look at he had Hannah at the temple
[1:20:55] in Eli her husband to think of
[1:20:58] but that callous priest doubted God's
[1:21:03] word
[1:21:06] but his brother sakarian said the other
[1:21:08] day over in the island when I saw my
[1:21:11] mother-in-law die five days before it
[1:21:14] happened and my brother-in-law had a
[1:21:17] hemorrhagen blood out from his mouth
[1:21:19] just according from his mouth
[1:21:21] brother Stein Moore said let us go in
[1:21:23] and pray that this won't happen I said
[1:21:25] it won't do one bit again
[1:21:28] God has already said it it's got to
[1:21:31] happen
[1:21:34] God when he says anything it's
[1:21:36] impossible for it not to happen
[1:21:38] therefore When God says in the books all
[1:21:42] things are possible for them that belief
[1:21:45] is about to happen
[1:21:48] no way to explain it away you can't
[1:21:51] believe God will perform every promise
[1:21:54] that he made
[1:21:57] then
[1:21:59] when she never waited little Mary didn't
[1:22:03] now she had to believe something had
[1:22:05] never happened
[1:22:06] but look at her little childish heart
[1:22:08] I'm going to thank her to be just a
[1:22:10] young woman about 18 20 years old
[1:22:13] she never taken the seconds off
[1:22:16] as soon as she's seen and know that was
[1:22:19] the angel of the Lord
[1:22:20] that know these things and told her
[1:22:23] exactly according to the scripture she
[1:22:25] had been thinking on and told her her
[1:22:27] name
[1:22:30] she know that messenger come from God
[1:22:34] and the scripture that she had been
[1:22:36] thinking of was confirmed right there to
[1:22:39] her Mary
[1:22:42] the Holy Ghost will come upon you
[1:22:46] as if Almighty shall overshadow thee and
[1:22:50] that Holy thing that will be born will
[1:22:52] not be a man but he'll be called the son
[1:22:55] of God
[1:22:57] she threw her little hands up the tears
[1:22:59] running out of those beautiful eyes said
[1:23:01] this hold the hands made of the Lord
[1:23:04] bid unto me according to Thy Word
[1:23:07] she didn't wait till she was positive of
[1:23:10] this she didn't wait till she felt life
[1:23:12] or some kind of a sensation to prove
[1:23:15] that she was to be a mother she just
[1:23:17] took his word and that was enough amen
[1:23:20] that's what God wants you to do tonight
[1:23:22] not wait till you feel better not wait
[1:23:24] till you can move your hand better and
[1:23:26] walk a good step not wait till the
[1:23:28] doctor says you're improving but take
[1:23:30] off at his word
[1:23:33] that's the only way to please him take
[1:23:35] his word that's the way Miracles are
[1:23:38] performed when God is touched by his
[1:23:40] word The Impossibles Are Made Real when
[1:23:43] God is stuck at his words not questioned
[1:23:45] just keep it from your mind
[1:23:48] behold the hands made of the Lord while
[1:23:51] she was so happy about it she just
[1:23:52] couldn't stand still and nothing had
[1:23:54] showed up yet
[1:23:56] but she knew it was going to be called
[1:23:58] God's heads off
[1:24:01] if Christ says these signs shall power
[1:24:04] them that believe if they lay their
[1:24:06] hands on the sick they shall recover
[1:24:09] take him out his word don't doubt
[1:24:12] anything just for I don't believe him
[1:24:14] it'll be all right God's promised it God
[1:24:17] will perform it God watches over his
[1:24:19] words to keep it
[1:24:21] and to answer prayer
[1:24:23] then she started on her way she heard
[1:24:26] good news of her cousin Elizabeth an old
[1:24:31] thingy
[1:24:32] see
[1:24:34] he just believed his way
[1:24:36] God promised it he will perform it
[1:24:39] you don't pray for something God has
[1:24:41] already said it
[1:24:43] are you going to pray that it will not
[1:24:45] stop no
[1:24:48] God said he said it
[1:24:50] praise the Lord
[1:24:52] so this is what I have for you
[1:24:55] tonight
[1:24:57] hold on the word of God
[1:24:59] don't doubt
[1:25:01] know him

[1:25:43] as the meeting finished
[1:25:46] and I step out I was gonna go
[1:25:49] my way everybody goes their way

[1:25:55] you will never meet again
[1:25:58] like this normal

[1:26:03] then I look at them I begin to cry
[1:26:07] I don't know
[1:26:09] who

[1:26:14] I just believe he said that something is
[1:26:17] going to happen
[1:26:19] and I Cry I Cry everybody start crying
[1:26:23] they thought something was wrong with me
[1:26:27] but God has spoke to my heart
