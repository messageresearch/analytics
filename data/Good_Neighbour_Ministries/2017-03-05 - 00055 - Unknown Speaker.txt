========================================
in Africa so that you learn real discipline. You have a deacon there, have a beacon there, have another one there, another one there. And if it's a big combination, have another one covers the middle part. And each one has a special long rod. And somebody with behavior, you [Music] just or they preach for hours on and you start falling asleep. man or woman. Praise the Lord. Bring you back to your senses. Praise God. But they they give you literal discipline in that kind of form. But I'm saying you got to have some spiritual discipline. You got to have parameters to anything that you're doing. And if you go too far, you need to expect that somebody is going to correct you or whisper in your ear or tell you something. And you can't start to huff on a puff like a, you know, blow the house down or, you know, puff up this little toad, you know, all smoke like that and ready to bust out as you call it, you know. No. Praise God. Need I don't want you to go to the opposite way either. where you all the thing on your sword and you just wait till you can get out of air shot when none of the believers can hear you and then you go up who they think they are but whatever else who I just come there they should be glad I come to that church you come to the church think about it praise the Lord you are honored to come in the presence of the Lord any church that's really dedicated to the glory of God amen praise Praise the Lord. You're just so full of yourself that you think that way. Praise God. Are you listening to me now? Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. Glory to God. Now listen to God's prophecy. He says, "Now when you enter this sanctuary, you are to keep still one to another and worship God. For if you want to visit each other, there is places that you can visit each other with, but never in here walking around where the rest of the people can't hear themselves think. Is that right? You know what I'm talking about. It's all right to wear all kinds of shoes, but it's not good when you're making sure that we know you're coming. I know God says we are a Christian army, but you don't have to stop. You don't have to stop for us to know your God. Praise the Lord. Matter of fact, let all the earth keep silent before you. Tiptoe softly in the presence of God. You're going out tiptoe softly. You're showing reverence for God. It's not because I'm the man standing here and you have some resentment against me. I can show him that, you know, I can walk out to I come in when I want to dare him to say anything. You're not daring me. You know, if you're in God's house, praise the Lord. And we here to give God praise, honor, and glory. Praise God. Hallelujah. We should not make such noise and things. I've seen in churches until it has made me feel real bad because people do not come into the sanctuary of the Lord to meet each other. When we come, we come to worship God. Amen. Amen. You want to visit, go to your homes or somewhere else. This sanctuary is dedicated to worship. You want to fellowship, stand outside, talk anything you want to as long as it's right things and holy things. And you can go to one another's homes or go visit some other places round about. But when you enter this door, we are to come in here and be quiet in the presence of the Lord. Amen. Is that right? Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Praise God. Now that God, he didn't have a 4A, but we have a 4A. And the foyer was built particularly and deliberately for that to avoid people talking and fellowshipping inside here and that you would go out in the foyer after the services ended and there you can talk and you can fellowship. Now if other people want uh that are impressed and touched by the Holy Spirit want to stay within the house of God and in these pews or come to the uh platform kneel here as if it was an altar in the presence of God, they should have that right to be silent and meditating. Uh if you want to spend five minutes, 10 minutes before they get up and go out, they have to have that right. While the music is still being played softly, your the bands are still playing softly. They ought to have that right. Right. And you can go out in the party, talk and fellowship out there. I said talk and fellowship. I didn't say shout and yell. I said talk, fellowship, not shout and yell. Praise God. The deacons know and the trustees know to close this the inner door. Praise the Lord. Just to dampen whatever sound is coming from that may be outside. Praise God. And that the people can have that. Now we are transforming even how we our attitude. My topic actually today is how to behave in the house of God. how to behave in the house of God. Hallelujah. Amen. Yes, sir. Now go there and listen and win. He says the trouble is we do too much talking and don't listen enough in the presence of God. When we are when we come in here, we are to wait upon him. Amen. Praise the Lord. Come in. No wonder we had a revival going on up there on the mountain when the church was on Bruce Dale until it became so jam-packed. Over 450 people pack people down in the basement, cars up and down the street until the neighbors begin to complain. And after a while, we couldn't sustain it because we couldn't expand. We couldn't buy any of the property. And so we we were kind of in a situation where we were forced that we we had to move. And uh just about that time is when uh we had a little uh church split and some people went off and some remain. And this nucleus is here and we're trying to grow ourselves just back to what God did in our lives. But there were prayer things going on. The Holy Spirit was moving in a wonderful way. They take a picture and at that time they were called the eagles cry. uh to to the photographers a surprise. There was a eagle sitting in a nest right into the sign. Some I believe some believers even have it today supernaturally. Not somebody photoshopper or painting something. It was right there and and and things like that were happening. People have come against the message were dropping dead. People were being healed. People were coming with wheelchairs and rising up out of it and walking in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Miracles were taking place. The hand of God was moving in a wonderful precious way. And that was the order that we used to keep just like what he said here. The presence of God reverence. Come on in the sanctuary. True. People tiptoe in. And they were tiptoeing in not only because I preach a message like this because of what they were seeing happening. I didn't have to tell them there's something is what some of them used to say. Something is in that building. Something is in that place. But we know it's somebody. Amen. But brother Ben said, when you start going to a certain place, whether in your closet or whether in church, and you uh decide you're going to meet him at a certain time every day or whenever you want to worship, he said he'll come there and be there before you even get there waiting on him. So the Lord will be in here. Praise the Lord. And when people become conscious of God and just think, But it's not an office building. It's another building. You just barge uh like that. Not recognizing that you are coming not only into a building, but you're coming in here in an atmosphere so you can get your yourself into the spirit and presence of the Lord. Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Now for you to do that, let there let uh brother Olrich would come in and he would play the song. Now back then they didn't have all the stuff we have now. Now we we can have the brothers long before the service start before have prepared worship music that's soft and low. Worshipful, plain in the background so that when you step into the doors, the atmosphere is already there and you can enter into it and add your prayer, your thought or the prophet said open your Bible quietly. Not just open your Bible in that kind of an atmosphere, you want to be as reverent as possible. you don't feel like praying or you prayed enough, then you can quietly begin reading your Bible. Soft music. The ushers are to stand at the door and see that nobody come in here and talks or you have done your talking outside and then you come in. [Music] If you desire to silently, you can come to the front and pray silently. When you're finished, you walk back to your seat. You may want to open your Bible. What your neighbor does, what they do is up to them. You have nothing to say to them and nothing to do. You want to talk to him. You say in your heart, I'll see him or her outside, but right now I'm in here to worship God. Amen. Is that right? In other words, he's saying don't let the devil distract you cuz he'll deliberately make somebody else unintentionally. The person doesn't mean anything, but they'll do this or they'll do that. You know, when you want to come to church, from the time it comes Sunday or whatever to come to church, the devil is going to start putting distractions. your brand new car that's supposed to work 100% with your eyes closed. You just how come this thing is not working right? Or you do something that cost something else. You're never parked in front of your garage or parked in front of your driveway and can't get up to get you stirred up so you may come in the house of God all fired up the wrong way. The devil has all kinds of tricks, right? And you got to do what? And then he'll follow you all the way. If you do make it and you get in the house of God after you pass through the the valley of worry and the valley of worry valley of sleeping or everything else and you're still in the house of God, then he doesn't stop. That monkey sits on your shoulder trying to whisper in your ear. And then you you know your neighbors are there going about their business simply and then he's going to come say you know she turned that Bible too loud you know you should really stop turning that Bible too loud and and if you bother with them you going to be irritated and think it's the person that you should be irritated with. It's not difficult with the person that's trying to work on you. Right? So then we have to watch all this and just give you a few minutes. But that's exactly what the devil does. So they're to stand at the door, see nobody talk. If you want to talk to him, say in your heart, I'll see him or her outside, but I'm in here to worship God and read his word or sit here silently. And then with the music of Major Alrich or Sister Gertie, Sister Gertie with the old piano, she would come in and play softly in the background at the cross where some sweet soft music is to be played until the time for other service. And then reverently the song leader gets on and begins to lead congregational songs. And then in the midst of that, if someone has an outstanding soul, they will come and sing it. And then the music will continually play. And then I would hear that and know that it was my time to come out. In other words, some kind of a system need to be set up so that when the pastor is in the back there either by these days they have a monitor they can put on a monitor. I don't have one there back yet but they're working on it to put it on. So I know exactly when I have to come out or we have a visiting speaker. They know when they have to come out because it will be right there. They'll have some kind of a means by which they could know. Amen. Praise the Lord. And then the minister walks into the congregation in the middle of a people that was praying and worshiping God under the anointing of the spirit. I tell you, when you do like that, you are bound to hear from heaven. Praise God. Hallelujah. There is no way to keep from it. But if the minister walks into a bunch of confusion, when you are confused, the congregation confused, then the spirit of God is grieved. Hallelujah. We do not want to do that. We want to come here to worship. We have our own lovely homes. You can go there, visit with your friends, go somewhere else. But this is God's house. And there's little children now. Now, little babies, I mean, that they cry out in the services. Sometimes it's a drink of water and sometimes they need attention. They don't know no different. That's the way babies do. That's the way they get the attention that they need something. So, if we by the grace of God now know enough and we have dedicated a room and we call it a cry room, we call it nursery. But it's right straight there. And mothers can take their babies there. Praise God. If they begin to cry. We also have the foyer. Some mothers want to be in the washroom too. So instead of going down necessarily into the um nursery, they'll go out in the foyer in there where we have to monitor out there and everything that's in there is shown up there and they can uh you know feed their baby or get the baby quietened out there by the grace of God. Now uh I know you may be getting restless a little bit now but let me know let you know this is necessary. I don't have too much more to say, but uh this is necessary. You need to hear this. Praise the Lord. Glory to God. Hallelujah. So uh so then um you mothers if your baby starts whimpering, remember there's other people there and it bothers them because they come here to hear the service, right? So mothers, if your baby really start whimpering, I don't think he's talking about the baby just little baby sound, but he's talking about the baby start wailing and crying and keeping a whole lot of noise. And then you see, you've got the room, you can take them there for every real mother wants to take her baby to church, right? So, in that room, we have a speaker that has a control where we can turn the volume up or down. There's a toilet there, water basin, everything for the mother's convenience, chairs for you to sit, a place to change, change room, your baby, and everything. It's sitting there. It's all fixed. Let's use it for the glory of God. Amen. Amen. Amen. and mothers when we use it. Let's not leave it in a mess. But let's clean up after our babies, clean up after our children, clean up after ourselves. Praise God. Hallelujah. And then sometimes we have teenage children and sometimes adults that want to pass around notes to one another in the congregation or begin to joke, laugh, cut up in the sanctuary. Now come on. He says you're old enough to know better than that. You young people, if you expect to be a real man someday and raise a proper family for the kingdom of God, then you you young woman expect to be a mother, raise a family, then start off doing it right right now in the beginning. If you see it act right, do right. It'll turn out right. Can you say praise God? Don't wait then when you start right now. Hallelujah. Amen. For I have seen churches where children were permitted to run all over the sanctuary. And the adults stand at one corner of the sanctuary and shouting to the children at the other end of the sanctuary calling out, hollering. He didn't say yes. He said hollering across the room to one another. That's a good way to ruin the service. that's coming even on the other night. Amen. Praise the Lord. Not even at the end of this service, we're going out and if people start shouting to one another, he said that's a good way to ruin the service or even the next service that's coming up because it's too much of a strain. Amen. So go out. Hallelujah. Now then, if you do right, the gifts will begin to fall down among you. The gifts will begin to start to reappear. You believe that? Amen. Praise the Lord. I trust this is the way it ought to be. When people have a new church, they begin to get too starchy. See, this is a place to come worship. and spiritual gifts will begin to come among you. And so when they come amongst you, then Satan will come in and try to take away some shows some kind of a flaw, bringing some kind of a fraud. Like I said, he's come with his tricks because he realized God's getting ready to move. So when God gets ready to move, he's right there to to see if he can obstruct or or subvert or do this or whatever. Hallelujah. But now when these gifts begin to appear, we begin to worship God. Then we must dedicate ourselves that from here must go out the word of the living God around the world and around the globe. Do you believe that? Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. We always say we're going to take the word to the world. Now we have a place to dwell in a roof on over our head, a clean nice church to sit in, but let us dedicate ourselves newly to the task and consecrate ourselves to the Lord Jesus Christ. Praise the Lord. Very important that we do that. I'm winding this up now. Just I know it's now 1:00 on the dot. I just need about 5 minutes more and wind this up. He says, "Now in this church, we are blessed with brother Neville, a real pastor, a real pastor, a wonderful man of God." Amen. He knows the message and he holds with it all he's got. He's gentle. I would say, brother Brad, he's even sometimes a little afraid to speak to the people. Oh brothers, I don't mean that but I all I mean is that he's you know brother talk. I just means that he is gentle. He doesn't speak up and speak out you know to say them sharp cutting things like sit down or keep still. I've noticed that and even listens. But it so happens that God made me so I can do it. Praise the Lord. And I want you to remember that these are just not my words. You listening right? This is all being taped. Everything is being taped. And let every deacon stand to their posture duty. Remember, you are here under a commission directly from God to hold your post and position sacred. Every trustee just the same. Amen. Amen. the pastor. It isn't the pastor's place or the deacon's place uh the pastor's place to do these things and to get there to even say that. See, the deacons, they are the ones that are the policemen of the church. Can somebody say amen? Praise God. I think we have time to put in to our budget um to get some handcuffs. Is that right? Praise the Lord. Don't take me literal now. We use the Holy Ghost to handcuff you with handcuffed by the Holy Ghost. In other words, you become a prisoner of Christ. We don't need to uh do anything. But here it is. He said, "Now you are on the commission to hold your ghost sacred. Now, young couples come outside and sometimes they blow their horns. Some things like that. A mother sends her daughter or her son out there, send them out there. And what happened? She goes out of the church, go out with some renegade kid and run out there sitting in a car while her father thinks she's in church. Like that. We've had uh of course we've had um people leave this church because I will not pull up the pack. Uh the the young kid uh leaves and have a couple of the girls in the church out in a nice car cuz they were well off and they could buy a real fancy car where a normal kid can't buy. and and and they're in there in the dark parking lot uh chatting away and um they expect myself or the demon to put up with that and and then start wagging their finger in my face and don't you don't tell my child don't speak I said well no that doesn't work like that here we're sorry that you're unhappy the way we operate here but there's a lot of places we want you to be happy and there's a lot of places that you may be happy under those kinds of conditions and you were free at any time to go to such uh you know to such a place but it's not going to happen here and so quietly you know they left and so it's the same thing right now um that kind of thing should not go on here whether it's in a car or anywhere else parents bring you here to worship you need to stay in the house of God and worship God and give him glory right here amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen The deacons ought to see to that and tell them you either come in here, sit down, or I'm going to take you in my car and take you home to your mother or take you home to your parents right away. Praise the Lord. Remember, love is corrective. Genuine love is corrective. And you must stand that correction. Mothers, there's a place for you here. And if the deacon speaks to you, stand the correction. Young kids, no different. Young adults, same adults, you no different than to run around over the building, talk over the building, carry on conversations in the auditorium. Don't you do that. It's wrong. It's dis it isn't pleasing to God. For Jesus said, in closing, it is written, "My house shall be called a house of worship, of prayer, a house of prayer for all nations." what they were buying and they were selling and he platted ropes and ran them people out of the auditorium. We certainly don't want that to happen in this sanctuary. So let us dedicate our lives, our church, our tasks, our service and everything that we have to worship God and dedicate ourselves and dedicate this building to the glory of God. Will you agree with me? Amen. Let us change our approach, our attitude and let us bring the glory and presence of God down where God can come and meet with us and we can fellowship with him. Shall we stand as we look to the Lord in prayer? God bless these words. How we ought to behave in the house of God. Now, heavenly father, we thank you for the going forth of thy gracious law, thy word of truth. Father, in this this teaching moment, may the word of God sink deeply within our hearts as lives are being uh refreshed for th those who already knew this but kind of uh uh Lord God l on it. May the spirit refresh their action and to the heart. For those who are now being shaped and formed, may the spirit of God like the great master sculpture take the word of God and shape the lives and change the hearts, change the minds. And father, may we save it in ourselves from today, I'm going to act different. I'm going to be different. I'm going to treat the house of God differently. I'm going to make it a place of worship that's clean naturally, consecrated spiritually. For I now dedicate myself and my service onto the glory of God. Amen. Father, may each one pray a similar prayer within their hearts. that we will all enjoy the fruits which will be the power and glory of the spirit of almighty God working among us and creating this church as a lighthouse in this community. A place where the word of God can go out. Bless us each one today. Bless our families as we go on the road. Protect us. Take us safely to and fro. Father, and in all that we do take praise, honor, and glory in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, the word of God. Amen. And amen. God bless you real good. I trust that you've taken this message seat, sincerely, and seriously into your hearts and that you will act upon it. Can I have your promise that you're going to act on the word of God? Amen. Let us keep this as a genuine center in the house of God. And we want to beautify it even more than this to keep it the way God wants us to keep it. Amen. The Lord bless you. We'd like to announce that next uh Sunday we are going to have a visiting preacher uh out of Connecticut coming to minister for us. Brother Elijah gift will be ministering next weekend Sunday only for the glory of God. Amen. No service on Saturday night. So don't turn up in the parking lot looking at the sign saying clothes for the season because uh nobody will be here. Uh just um come on Sunday morning, worship fully like we said into the house of God and let us raise up holy hands without wrath or doubt. Brother Elijah Gibbs. And please don't forget me because I'll be here on Wednesday night with a little d uh Bible study and we trust that you will come uh you'll be surprised sometimes the Bible study because we have a little more time to dig a little deeper how how wonderful it is to be in the Bible studies. So we want to invite you to be there and we trust God will richly bless you when you listen and obey his word. God bless you, brother Mike, our wonderful, sweet singer of Burlington, Washington. Praise God. God bless you, brother Mike. Amen. God bless you, saints.
