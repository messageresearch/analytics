[24:45] amen now the Lord has given me a new
[24:48] song and so before I sing I would love
[24:50] the opportunity to share a testimony of
[24:52] how the phone came to be
[24:55] and you may recall that last fall we had
[24:58] the 40 days of prayer theories that we
[25:01] ministered on and then through that we
[25:03] had started these small groups and had
[25:05] you know the Bible study through that
[25:08] and our small group that we had a group
[25:10] of sisters together
[25:12] seven of us and if you've been with such
[25:14] a blessing at the end of the fury we
[25:16] decided that we wouldn't end our small
[25:18] group that we would continue because it
[25:20] was just such a refreshment for us to
[25:22] come each week and be able to share in
[25:24] the word and move the fellowship
[25:25] together even share what's in our hearts
[25:27] you know our burden that the scripture
[25:29] tells us you know bear one another
[25:31] burdens right so even today by God's
[25:34] grace it's been more than a year later
[25:35] our Sisters still meet weekly and it's
[25:37] just been such a wonderful blessing and
[25:40] you know there was one it's a Thursday
[25:42] night that we meet so one particular
[25:45] first day after our fellowship you're
[25:47] not just so excited with the love of God
[25:49] that we shared in our prayer and
[25:51] everything that we did and the melody
[25:53] for this chorus just poured from my
[25:55] heart I just started singing it I was
[25:57] actually in the kitchen doing dishes and
[25:59] the song just came to me I wonder you
[26:01] know some of my sisters how many of you
[26:03] have wonderful fellowship with the Lord
[26:05] right there in the kitchen it often
[26:06] happens for me personally so I just
[26:09] started singing the chorus and then I
[26:11] was like wow you know maybe I should do
[26:12] do something with that so by the grace
[26:15] of God you know from there the Lord
[26:16] placed a song in my heart and so I just
[26:19] like to take this opportunity to
[26:20] publicly thank my dear sisters in our
[26:22] fellowship they're taking sister Carol
[26:24] Sister Patsy sister Johnson sister Gita
[26:27] our precious sister Amanda right here
[26:29] and myself of course by God's grace and
[26:33] they've just all been such a blessing
[26:35] you know all of us just can encouraging
[26:37] each other we can just see how much the
[26:40] Lord has encouraged us and enriched our
[26:42] growth our growth together in him and so
[26:45] I feel like this song is also you know a
[26:47] testimony to them because the Overflow
[26:49] of the love that they shared with me and
[26:52] the expression of their love when they
[26:53] pray and they pray with their whole
[26:54] heart and that overflowed into the song
[26:57] so that's why I want to just give thanks
[26:59] for their lives and that the Lord will
[27:01] continue to bless them and that the Lord
[27:03] will continue to bless each of you and
[27:04] you of you all for his glory amen may we
[27:07] all walk in God's love of a thing in

[41:51] you so much
[41:55] welcome brother
[41:57] Tim Sister Laura Lee happy to have you
[42:00] here in the house of the Lord I have to
[42:02] see brother
[42:03] the brother
[42:06] Leon's family here
[42:08] and all of you gathered in the house of
[42:11] the Lord it's Thanksgiving time
[42:13] praise the Lord however our Thanksgiving
[42:16] is not according to tradition
[42:18] our tradition our Thanksgiving is
[42:21] according to the word
[42:23] amen we thank God for the pumpkins and
[42:26] the eggs and the and the rabbits God
[42:29] bless them uh they're there for us to
[42:33] eat and enjoy praise God so we give him
[42:36] thanks for all those things but that is
[42:39] not what our Thanksgiving is about amen
[42:42] we have the light of the world in us so
[42:44] we don't need the candles we don't need
[42:47] those things even though they're there
[42:49] but we are here to rejoice in the light
[42:52] of the God's word the day and the hour
[42:56] in which we are living in and I thank
[42:59] God that this is not a fantasy
[43:04] you're not in a Christianity where your
[43:07] mind is just going back and seeing
[43:09] lovely pictures of Jesus walking on the
[43:12] blue Galilee and that's nice but we're
[43:15] not going by that we are going by
[43:19] something that's being made known and
[43:22] revealed to us now
[43:25] and I can't give that to you
[43:29] no nobody can give it to you
[43:32] no man can educate you into it by
[43:36] Christian Bible studies and teaching
[43:39] none can bring you to that place
[43:42] God just breaks it on individually
[43:47] and as Judas was born to be the son of
[43:50] perdition
[43:52] this other group was born as Sons and
[43:55] Daughters of God
[43:57] it's nothing that they're going to do to
[43:59] become that uh nothing that they can do
[44:03] to change that they are who they are by
[44:07] the grace of God
[44:10] praise the Lord I have you standing
[44:11] while I'm already talking but Lord bless
[44:14] you real good for being here and we
[44:17] thank God that we are all on the journey
[44:20] traveling home praise God God bless you
[44:23] let's let's go to the word of God Amen
[44:27] you know the word is the most essential
[44:29] thing of course I enjoy the worship the
[44:34] singing and every Revival inspires songs
[44:38] brother Branham said that people get
[44:41] inspired so they write songs they sing
[44:43] songs and every Revival brings its own
[44:45] hymns and people get inspired by the
[44:48] word of God may God bless every one of
[44:50] us here today as we look into the word
[44:53] of God Hebrews 4 verse 12 and 13. we're
[44:58] just going to use that and speak for a
[45:02] while
[45:03] I want you to recognize that even though
[45:05] you might real say well brother Simon
[45:08] seems to be repeating himself that's
[45:10] true and the reason why some messages
[45:14] that I might have even preached before I
[45:17] I'm given new a light on some of those
[45:21] things and so I have to say it again in
[45:24] another and different way to bring out
[45:27] that facet of light that may be coming
[45:30] out of God's prism of Truth so we give
[45:33] him all the glory amen uh the new and
[45:36] the old mixed together God's word
[45:40] ancient word with light for today God
[45:43] bless you our father we thank you as we
[45:46] are about to read the word and speak the
[45:48] word give a voice to the word we pray
[45:51] that the holy spirit will bless us
[45:55] together and raise us up in Heavenly
[45:59] places in Jesus Christ For Your Glory
[46:02] for your honor and for your praise in
[46:06] Jesus name amen
[46:08] and amen praise the Lord hallelujah
[46:11] thank you Lord draw near and give glory
[46:13] to your name hallelujah praise God
[46:16] hallelujah Hebrews 4 verses 12 and 13.
[46:23] for the word of God is quick
[46:28] and Powerful
[46:30] and sharper than any to edged sword
[46:35] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[46:40] Soul and Spirit
[46:42] and of the joints and Marrow
[46:45] and is a discerner of the thoughts
[46:49] and intents of the heart
[46:52] neither is there any creature that is
[46:55] not manifest in his sight
[46:58] but all things are naked
[47:00] and opened unto the eyes of him with
[47:04] whom we have to do
[47:07] amen praise the Lord the Lord bless you
[47:10] we want to take a thought here of
[47:12] Walking On The Razor's Edge
[47:17] a gracious father once again I praise
[47:21] and thank you and I just just anoint my
[47:25] lips and the ears of these ears as we
[47:28] give you glory amen the Lord bless you
[47:30] please be seated
[47:32] amen
[47:35] now uh last Sunday uh on I spoke on the
[47:41] subject of this deceiving hour this
[47:45] deceiving hour in which we live
[47:49] and uh just to mention this to you as
[47:53] soon as I was finished ministering the
[47:55] word
[47:56] here talking about this deceiving hour
[48:00] of the of the deception coming and being
[48:06] so close that a human senses can't just
[48:11] discern it you may discern it from time
[48:13] to time but in reality at the height of
[48:16] it the human senses will not be able to
[48:19] discern it
[48:22] and as soon as I was finished preaching
[48:25] and left the pulpit walked down as soon
[48:29] as I hit the door to enter the office I
[48:31] thought so that
[48:33] turn look at YouTube on your phone
[48:37] well I don't usually do that every time
[48:40] I come off the pulpit like that but the
[48:43] thought comes uh
[48:46] turn on YouTube so I did that and as
[48:50] soon as I turned it on there came up on
[48:53] the screen brother Harold Beckett of
[48:56] South Africa preaching on the twins
[49:00] the two Vines
[49:03] this deception of the two Vines
[49:06] and the twins and I just said praise God
[49:10] hallelujah I thank God for a wonderful
[49:14] confirmation and I believe I was also
[49:17] saying to you remember when these things
[49:19] are being revealed to us it doesn't mean
[49:22] that uh I I the days are gone when men
[49:25] start oh I'm the one that got this God
[49:29] revealed this and I'm the one no God is
[49:33] reaching out to his elected few wherever
[49:36] they are that truth is going out
[49:40] and it's radiating to his elected few
[49:43] whoever and wherever they are
[49:46] amen and we thank God for that and
[49:48] that's not the whole message they've
[49:51] been emoting those things
[49:53] but we don't know that that's the truth
[49:55] amen until God reveals it Hallelujah but
[50:00] now while speaking on that subject
[50:05] we began to tell you how that Satan has
[50:09] actually mastered
[50:11] all the manifestations that were given
[50:15] to each age
[50:18] he has mastered those manifestations
[50:21] he has gone through mastered production
[50:24] Americans
[50:26] is mastered tongues he can speak tongues
[50:31] of men and of angels
[50:33] he can speak those fluently his mastered
[50:37] miracles
[50:38] so much so that in the Book of
[50:41] Revelation the Bible tells us he is
[50:45] actually going to produce lying wonders
[50:49] is that right
[50:51] lying wonders there will be wonders
[50:54] there will be miraculous but they will
[50:58] not be pointing back to the word it will
[51:01] not point to the word but away from the
[51:04] word it may point to a great man it may
[51:07] point to a holy man but it will point
[51:10] you back to Jesus Christ who died for
[51:13] our sins raised again for justification
[51:15] coming again for a Rapture and we give
[51:18] God the glory and the praise for that
[51:21] amen hallelujah and he has mastered them
[51:25] all true to the last age that we're in
[51:29] he's mastered all the Pentecostal
[51:33] manifestations
[51:35] and he has now come up through all those
[51:39] seven Church ages growing stronger and
[51:43] stronger in his delusions
[51:46] until now he the seven churches are over
[51:52] and he has also tried to climb to the
[51:57] top of the pyramid
[51:59] now we know when he gets to the top of
[52:03] the pyramid then he finds out that he
[52:07] has a problem
[52:09] because he has impersonated
[52:13] and copied
[52:15] all the things that were done in the
[52:18] other ages see but now
[52:22] he has come face to face as in the
[52:27] mountain of Matthew 4 verse 4 he has
[52:31] come to the top of the mountain
[52:34] to him the Mount of Temptation and trial
[52:38] but he's come face to face with Jesus
[52:41] Christ
[52:42] and now he is challenging Jesus Christ
[52:47] amen
[52:48] the word incarnate
[52:51] for this hour
[52:53] Jesus Christ
[52:55] the coming of the son of man
[53:00] Christ coming again but in the bright
[53:03] fall
[53:04] are in the form of a bride right and now
[53:10] but it's still him in her
[53:14] as she came from his side now he lives
[53:18] in her and she is now manifesting the
[53:23] word that had come to her heart
[53:26] and we as Believers are to live and
[53:30] manifest and make real the word of God
[53:34] that has come into our heart
[53:37] amen and so he has that problem amen
[53:42] that now he is not facing him
[53:47] Jesus 2 000 years ago
[53:51] but he is facing the same Jesus in the
[53:55] True Church of Jesus Christ the true
[53:59] bride of Christ
[54:00] he is still facing him
[54:03] in her praise God but not him it's now
[54:07] her
[54:08] hallelujah it's not uh him back there
[54:13] but him here today
[54:15] in this form of a bride and he has to
[54:20] face her and she has to face him also
[54:24] face to face in that challenge she lost
[54:28] but in this challenge the bride wins the
[54:32] battle amen hallelujah praise the Lord
[54:36] because now we see he has an impossible
[54:40] task
[54:41] and the task is not to impersonate gifts
[54:45] like wonders tongues all these wonderful
[54:48] things of God but now he has to
[54:50] impersonate the very word itself
[54:54] he has to try to impersonate Jesus
[54:57] Christ himself now he's standing back
[55:00] and watching now because for him to do
[55:03] that he's got to have the Life of Christ
[55:06] in him
[55:07] and if it if it were possible he would
[55:11] be converted
[55:15] but
[55:18] for him to be converted
[55:21] you see but that's the problem he's
[55:24] faced with now that how is he going to
[55:28] impersonate the word itself now the word
[55:31] itself not some fake word he knows the
[55:34] fake from the real he made them up
[55:36] himself so you can't fool him with that
[55:38] he knows when he's facing the real thing
[55:40] right uh years ago uh again I was just a
[55:45] young man and
[55:47] um I think it was my father uh trying to
[55:50] cast a devil out of a woman that we knew
[55:54] we all knew her there and uh the devil
[55:59] told him says Mr Simon you're a good man
[56:02] at that time he didn't come to the
[56:03] message yet uh but you're a good man you
[56:07] live a holy life but you are not able to
[56:10] do this
[56:12] and then he so he set for another
[56:14] preacher a preacher that he knew and the
[56:17] preacher run and came while the preacher
[56:19] was like the distance of the back door
[56:21] of the church there the devil started
[56:23] laughing
[56:25] ah he says why are you coming what are
[56:28] you coming to do you just like me
[56:30] in other words what's in you is one of
[56:33] us
[56:34] so so what you're going to tell me right
[56:36] so there you go that devil on that
[56:39] preacher was deceiving so many people
[56:41] and they did not know the difference but
[56:44] uh the other devil knew that that was
[56:48] just like him praise God so he has an
[56:52] impossible task upon his hand now to
[56:55] come and try to impersonate the word of
[57:00] God hallelujah and we know that only the
[57:03] Holy Spirit can discern the difference I
[57:08] want to share with you this a wonderful
[57:10] uh saying or quote
[57:13] from trying to do God a service without
[57:17] it being God's will
[57:19] Now watch how close
[57:23] we get to that Razor's Edge now
[57:28] what the razor's Edge
[57:31] the difference between right and wrong
[57:36] and remember when you get there it will
[57:40] fall on one or the other side
[57:44] uh you can't be on both sides you're
[57:47] going to fall one side or the other side
[57:50] it's either with the elect fuel which
[57:54] will be a minority people don't want to
[57:57] face that fact
[57:59] they are believing the devil's lie that
[58:03] the church or the Church of Jesus Christ
[58:06] has to be a big beautiful church with
[58:09] hundreds of thousands of people well
[58:12] they might it must be true it must be
[58:14] right because how many of them are in
[58:16] there and it's the total opposite
[58:19] because Jesus himself says fear not
[58:24] little flock it is your father's good
[58:28] pleasure to give you the kingdom
[58:31] everywhere he referred to the church he
[58:34] said it will be a minority
[58:37] it will be a faith just for you praise
[58:41] God of course we know a few in
[58:43] comparison to the billions in the world
[58:45] doesn't mean really two but it means a
[58:48] small minority and I don't mean this
[58:51] church or any other little church but I
[58:54] mean the true bride of Christ Within
[58:58] These groups or wherever they are like
[59:02] uh I I told you where it was said he
[59:05] said and the bride will be here there
[59:09] out there anywhere praise God she's
[59:14] scattered out there praise the Lord and
[59:16] we not to assume uh because we are
[59:20] living an obviously visible Christian
[59:23] Life that uh like Elijah we are the only
[59:27] ones no no no no no no no that's not the
[59:31] way it works God says I have some out
[59:33] there they are still in those
[59:34] denominations
[59:36] they're still eating Jezebel's food at
[59:39] her table
[59:40] they're still taking those things but I
[59:43] have them there for a purpose
[59:45] I have them there amen praise God so
[59:49] don't think that you're alone you're not
[59:51] alone I've got witnesses out there
[59:53] praise God hallelujah amen let me
[59:57] continue here he says no it'll fall on
[1:00:00] one or the other side till it comes down
[1:00:04] sometime like a horned razor between the
[1:00:10] difference between right and wrong
[1:00:14] it's it's got to be every word not just
[1:00:19] almost every word but every word and
[1:00:24] it's got down to that today
[1:00:27] amen remember let me repeat not to the
[1:00:31] lutherans not to the methodists not to
[1:00:34] the Pentecostals see not to them now the
[1:00:37] Pentecostals he was the messenger of the
[1:00:40] Pentecostal age he was uh the angel of
[1:00:45] the seventh Church of Revelation amen
[1:00:48] and yet he says it's not to that
[1:00:52] Pentecostal age amen it's coming to the
[1:00:57] old outage
[1:00:59] the honed out age the age that comes
[1:01:03] with the word that brings it right to
[1:01:06] the razor's Edge
[1:01:08] it's coming to that in this age and that
[1:01:13] age where the Antichrist anointing will
[1:01:18] be so perfected right it'll be so
[1:01:21] perfectly
[1:01:23] perfected it would that it would deceive
[1:01:27] be very elected if it were possible
[1:01:30] you oh my some will fall on the wrong
[1:01:34] side and if they don't watch you see
[1:01:37] because now it's become like a wedge
[1:01:40] amen hallelujah a later we'll talk about
[1:01:44] that how a wedge is a separator but
[1:01:47] watch amen be careful we are not
[1:01:51] remember I'm telling you we are not
[1:01:54] living anywhere in the Pentecostal age
[1:01:59] anymore now
[1:02:02] amen praise God brothers and sisters we
[1:02:06] we are passed out of that church age
[1:02:09] and a lot of people are saying that now
[1:02:11] when I was saying it years ago many were
[1:02:15] chuckling laughing saying what are you
[1:02:17] talking about what now they're saying
[1:02:20] the same thing and they're speaking it
[1:02:22] with confidence now they're recognizing
[1:02:25] it but back then it sounded like if it
[1:02:28] was just Folly oh my amen see they've
[1:02:33] Fallen the wrong sign now be careful we
[1:02:36] I want you to know we are now past that
[1:02:40] age
[1:02:42] amen we've passed that age in the same
[1:02:47] way that we have already passed the
[1:02:51] Lutheran age and them ages hallelujah
[1:02:54] praise God now you can check that your
[1:02:57] self praise the Lord so Satan got this
[1:03:02] problem on his hands
[1:03:04] he got to impersonate something
[1:03:07] but how are you going in person need
[1:03:10] something if the real is not the same
[1:03:14] you got to have the real before you can
[1:03:17] have a copy
[1:03:19] if you don't have the real then you
[1:03:21] can't have a copy
[1:03:24] so he has a problem here now for him to
[1:03:29] impersonate the real true word of the
[1:03:32] hour and as I mentioned now the seven
[1:03:35] Thunders have sounded the seventh
[1:03:38] Sundays of Revelation which you know is
[1:03:41] the voice of that Great Mighty angel of
[1:03:45] Revelation chapter 10 who stood there
[1:03:48] one foot on the land one on the sea had
[1:03:52] a little book in his hand with the book
[1:03:55] now open raised up to heaven and shouted
[1:04:00] with a loud voice
[1:04:02] time shall be no more
[1:04:05] and the Bible says and when he spoke his
[1:04:09] voice was like seven Summers rolling
[1:04:13] amen seven Thunders ruling Hallelujah
[1:04:17] and that would happen in the days of the
[1:04:21] voice of the seventh angel
[1:04:24] when he shall begin to sound the seventh
[1:04:28] will unlock the seals but on Earth there
[1:04:31] would be revealed to a man Anointed with
[1:04:34] the power of the Holy Spirit of the
[1:04:36] Living God
[1:04:38] and we thank God that that has come to
[1:04:41] pass Hallelujah we praise God for all
[1:04:44] that but we are now in this deceiving
[1:04:47] hour
[1:04:49] Hallelujah and it's so dark
[1:04:52] in this hour that we are living in but
[1:04:55] we have to praise God that in the
[1:04:58] darkness we have a man here that can
[1:05:01] turn on the lights
[1:05:03] no matter how dark the room is there's
[1:05:06] the switch turn on the light
[1:05:09] and there's a man here who can turn on
[1:05:12] the light for he said I am the light of
[1:05:15] the world he that followeth me shall not
[1:05:18] walk in darkness but he shall have the
[1:05:20] light of life amen so the deception is
[1:05:24] getting worse darker as dark as the
[1:05:27] darkness that was in Egypt that could be
[1:05:30] felt since that the darkness is around
[1:05:33] us but in the middle of that all
[1:05:36] hallelujah thank God that God's children
[1:05:40] are promised that they will have
[1:05:43] Supernatural light amen that will show
[1:05:46] them the way out of this dark and sinful
[1:05:50] and Troublesome trial of this Trials of
[1:05:53] this world Amen Hallelujah now
[1:05:57] God has gotten it down so fine-tuned
[1:06:02] that he is now showing and revealing to
[1:06:07] us the true believers
[1:06:09] all of Satan's deceiving
[1:06:12] activities that he has been doing
[1:06:16] Through the Ages and now to this time
[1:06:18] what he is doing now in this ages
[1:06:22] and that now those efforts are
[1:06:25] concentrated especially within
[1:06:29] what we call the message
[1:06:31] this is where he is bringing his real
[1:06:36] impersonation so what I'm saying to you
[1:06:39] Satan
[1:06:40] hiding place is now in the message
[1:06:44] he is hiding within the ranks of the
[1:06:48] message of the Living God hallelujah and
[1:06:51] God is making sure we get this
[1:06:54] understanding this revelation of his
[1:06:57] word so plain
[1:06:59] that Satan doesn't have a rock to hide
[1:07:03] under when he has to confess the face
[1:07:06] with a true son or daughter of the
[1:07:09] Living God living by the word true on us
[1:07:14] to their word hallelujah amen when he
[1:07:18] comes face to face with that he doesn't
[1:07:19] have a rock to hide under
[1:07:23] amen
[1:07:25] praise God I want to make another
[1:07:27] thought here that at the same time when
[1:07:30] Israel was in all the darkness of Egypt
[1:07:34] amen it was so hard for them but you
[1:07:38] remember it was also a sign to them you
[1:07:42] ought to be getting ready to leave amen
[1:07:44] eat the lamb eat the bitter herbs kick
[1:07:48] in take the trials take the tribulations
[1:07:50] you're getting ready to leave the
[1:07:53] programs will come but you're getting
[1:07:55] ready to leave it's home time let's
[1:07:58] Rapture time back there they were headed
[1:08:01] to the Wilderness but now we are headed
[1:08:04] home to glory amen praise God out of the
[1:08:08] darkness into the light out of mortal
[1:08:11] into immortality
[1:08:13] out of all of these things on the earth
[1:08:15] we go into the Heavenly places in Jesus
[1:08:18] Christ by the opening of the word of the
[1:08:21] Living God amen hallelujah amen so we
[1:08:26] are now where are we walking on the
[1:08:29] razor's Edge
[1:08:31] amen
[1:08:33] right between right and wrong
[1:08:37] be enabled by the Holy Spirit to begin
[1:08:40] to discern between true and false
[1:08:45] amen praise the Lord
[1:08:47] Discerning between the counterfeit
[1:08:51] and the real and it's all in the message
[1:08:54] or what we call the message
[1:08:57] and say oh I'm in a message I'm your
[1:08:59] Capstone yeah I'm in the Capstone that
[1:09:02] sounds good but let's look to the word
[1:09:04] of the Living God Amen and we know only
[1:09:07] a little small tiny minority
[1:09:11] that will be able to catch that and not
[1:09:15] because again let me repeat not by human
[1:09:19] learning wisdom intellectuals no that is
[1:09:22] good amen but that is just for you to uh
[1:09:27] do whatever you have to do in this
[1:09:29] Mortal realm of life to be successful in
[1:09:33] this Mortal life to be uh you know
[1:09:36] Premiere exceptional and whatever you do
[1:09:39] natural life but when it comes to the
[1:09:42] things of God the mind of a man he says
[1:09:45] doesn't understand the things of God and
[1:09:48] God's mind is so deep it's far beyond
[1:09:51] your thoughts my thoughts so he actually
[1:09:55] has to invite you and bring you into his
[1:09:58] thoughts he has to bring you into his
[1:10:02] word he has to give you his
[1:10:05] understanding of his word in other words
[1:10:08] God has to become his own interpreter of
[1:10:12] his own word not you trying to interpret
[1:10:17] God's word using your finite human
[1:10:21] mortal mind that only has a few years on
[1:10:25] the earth you're here like grass and
[1:10:27] tomorrow the Bible says you're withered
[1:10:30] up your you've gone with the evening
[1:10:32] Breeze like smoke not pass it away with
[1:10:35] the blowing of the wind but we are here
[1:10:38] with the mind and life of God within us
[1:10:41] praise the Lord straightened and
[1:10:43] empowered to meet the challenge of this
[1:10:46] hour amen oh praise God we know Satan
[1:10:51] with his Sevenfold combination of all
[1:10:54] his powers wrapped up together coming
[1:10:56] against a bride Hallelujah but this is
[1:11:00] not the one he met in the garden this
[1:11:02] one is empowered by Jesus Christ within
[1:11:05] her amen hallelujah oh praise God Amen
[1:11:10] oh my goodness and I'm telling you
[1:11:14] we're in the time now when brothers and
[1:11:18] sisters I tell you uh the true church is
[1:11:23] literally going to be pushed out
[1:11:27] of the uh the systems of man
[1:11:32] the religious systems the religious
[1:11:34] order you'll be able to marry you won't
[1:11:37] be able to preach like I'm preaching be
[1:11:39] able to buy you won't be able to sell
[1:11:41] everything like that uh oh my brother I
[1:11:45] tell you what an hour uh the other day
[1:11:47] was speaking with uh somebody just about
[1:11:51] two days ago and they got some mixed up
[1:11:55] with their with their ideas and things
[1:11:59] like that do you know they could not do
[1:12:02] a thing
[1:12:03] they could only look at their book and
[1:12:05] see that they have so much money
[1:12:07] but they can't draw it out
[1:12:10] they can only look over there and see I
[1:12:13] should be able to do this but they can't
[1:12:15] get it
[1:12:16] because the system is set up in such a
[1:12:19] way that unless you are registered and
[1:12:23] you have an ID with them you cannot do
[1:12:26] it
[1:12:27] and the world is asleep not knowing that
[1:12:31] the Beast is already setting up a system
[1:12:34] and that when and if you are not a part
[1:12:37] of that system the Bible says in the
[1:12:41] Book of Revelation they will not be able
[1:12:44] to buy or sell or do anything
[1:12:48] amen without the the that registration
[1:12:52] or identification or acknowledgment of
[1:12:55] the Beast system that is already here
[1:12:58] it's not coming it's here
[1:13:01] and it's already it's working and using
[1:13:04] the children of disobedience
[1:13:06] right here on the face of the Earth
[1:13:09] praise the Lord hallelujah amen so God's
[1:13:14] Little minority which the Bible calls
[1:13:17] his speckled bird
[1:13:20] oh praise God how many of you know that
[1:13:22] little song
[1:13:23] uh let's sing maybe a verse of that do
[1:13:26] you have that there what a beautiful
[1:13:29] thought I am thinking help me now
[1:13:35] concerning a Great Speckled Bird
[1:13:40] it's in God's word it's recorded in
[1:13:44] God's word it's recorded
[1:13:47] come on you don't let me sing it
[1:13:51] holy word oh praise God I'm caught up in
[1:13:55] what I'm doing I'm not even looking up
[1:13:56] there
[1:13:57] I praise God for his wonderful word
[1:14:00] God's speckled bird
[1:14:03] speckled with what
[1:14:05] speckled with the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:14:09] Hallelujah it's not the red chemical or
[1:14:15] chemistry of the blood of Jesus that was
[1:14:17] shed on golgotha's Hill
[1:14:20] but she speckled with the life that was
[1:14:24] in that blood
[1:14:26] and the life that was in that blood is
[1:14:30] the word quickened or revealed which is
[1:14:34] the Holy Spirit
[1:14:37] thought she is mocked by the Holy Spirit
[1:14:40] on her life working manifesting through
[1:14:45] her praise the Lord aren't you glad
[1:14:47] you're speckled by the blood
[1:14:50] are you glad for the great Holy Spirit
[1:14:53] uh working and moving upon your life
[1:14:56] praise the Lord hallelujah I thank God
[1:15:00] for that amen amen but that little
[1:15:04] minority
[1:15:05] still holding on to the truth of God's
[1:15:08] word amen and when she hold on to that
[1:15:12] truth because millions billions are not
[1:15:16] believing that
[1:15:17] they're gonna say that she is off of the
[1:15:22] word uh she don't really believe the
[1:15:25] word because they're not seeing what
[1:15:27] you're seeing
[1:15:29] is that right yes they're gonna they
[1:15:32] won't even gonna say uh she's out of
[1:15:35] step
[1:15:36] with the word but she's not the one out
[1:15:40] of Step as we know in that great vision
[1:15:43] she is in stack with the word
[1:15:46] she just happens to be the minority you
[1:15:49] can have a great big army over there
[1:15:52] marching to maybe they're in Step but
[1:15:55] what they're in step is not to what
[1:15:56] she's in step with because uh as the old
[1:15:59] song says do You Hear What I Hear oh my
[1:16:04] I'm hearing a different beat I'm hearing
[1:16:07] a different sound I'm hearing a
[1:16:09] different Symphony going forth
[1:16:11] Hallelujah and I'm marching according to
[1:16:14] that word hallelujah amen yes sir o
[1:16:19] praise God so in the eyes of many
[1:16:23] and I'm telling you now
[1:16:26] she will look like she is the one that
[1:16:29] is of the word
[1:16:32] because everybody else saying this this
[1:16:34] is everybody's saying that that how come
[1:16:37] just you you all are just a few of you
[1:16:40] you expect us to believe you you know
[1:16:44] you could ask all the prophets the same
[1:16:46] thing
[1:16:47] Elijah you're the only one in Israel
[1:16:50] saying he's saying we expect us to
[1:16:51] believe you but that was the word of God
[1:16:55] my career look I got 400 and something
[1:16:58] profits here and they're all telling
[1:17:01] King Ahab go up to the battle you're
[1:17:03] gonna win
[1:17:04] and Micaiah one little old
[1:17:08] scrubbly looking man gets up there and
[1:17:10] says well uh you know you can say that
[1:17:13] but I he doesn't want to tell the king
[1:17:16] to his face he's gonna die I see Israel
[1:17:19] scattered like sheep
[1:17:21] having no Shepherd
[1:17:23] [Music]
[1:17:26] mad because he was also a a Jew he was
[1:17:31] also one that believed in the great
[1:17:33] Jehovah and he understood well what that
[1:17:36] meant he says give him bread and water
[1:17:39] and lock him in a prison till I come
[1:17:41] back the prophet was about to walk away
[1:17:43] turn around he says if you come back God
[1:17:46] has not spoken to me
[1:17:49] amen God hasn't spoken to him but he was
[1:17:52] in the minority all of them all the 400
[1:17:56] preached more unfortunate preachers or
[1:17:58] whatever were all saying the same thing
[1:18:01] and saying totally different to what he
[1:18:04] was saying but yet he was right
[1:18:08] amen
[1:18:09] that great big majority doesn't mean
[1:18:12] anything God reserves the right his word
[1:18:16] can overrun and overrule everything else
[1:18:20] hallelujah praise God hallelujah amen
[1:18:24] but now Satan is now starting to create
[1:18:27] an atmosphere here
[1:18:29] amen where the good looks evil
[1:18:34] and the evil start to look like they're
[1:18:36] good
[1:18:38] and that's the atmosphere he's creating
[1:18:41] again in the end time another seed of
[1:18:44] discrepancy where people are in doubt
[1:18:48] oh what is good
[1:18:51] what is evil
[1:18:53] what is true
[1:18:55] what is false until they are so their
[1:18:59] mind is so caught up they just don't
[1:19:03] know what to believe the only ones that
[1:19:06] will make it through that uh that
[1:19:09] confusion will be God's elected few whom
[1:19:14] he the steps of a righteous man or woman
[1:19:17] are ordered or ordained by the Lord
[1:19:20] himself
[1:19:24] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:19:26] hallelujah amen
[1:19:29] praise God of course we can see not
[1:19:32] typed in Esau and Jacob
[1:19:35] uh one looked good and the other one
[1:19:37] looked evil
[1:19:38] and then it turns out that the one that
[1:19:40] looked Eagle was really God's God's son
[1:19:44] and the other one that looked like a
[1:19:47] real gentleman and everything else with
[1:19:50] the Mortal eyes human eyes that was the
[1:19:53] one that was rejecting and against the
[1:19:57] word of God hallelujah amen but thank
[1:20:00] God God is showing us
[1:20:03] overall the things you've been hearing
[1:20:05] all this time coming down to now he's
[1:20:07] was training us and showing us how to
[1:20:10] get to the point where you are literally
[1:20:14] able to discern Satan regardless of what
[1:20:18] Veil he tries to hide behind what rock
[1:20:21] he tries to hide under you are able to
[1:20:24] discern him by the razor's Edge by the
[1:20:27] word
[1:20:28] Hallelujah remember what this raises
[1:20:32] Edge is amen as you read it in Hebrews 4
[1:20:37] 12 for the word of God Amen is quick and
[1:20:45] powerful and sharper than any to edged
[1:20:50] sword
[1:20:51] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[1:20:56] Soul and Spirit and of the joints and
[1:21:00] Marrow
[1:21:01] and is a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:21:06] intents or intentions of the heart amen
[1:21:10] praise the Lord nothing is hidden in the
[1:21:13] sight
[1:21:14] and that's where it's come down to
[1:21:16] because it tries to impersonate it now
[1:21:19] it's come to the racist Edge the edge of
[1:21:24] the sword of the king
[1:21:27] has come to walking on that edge amen of
[1:21:32] the king's sword
[1:21:34] left or right right wrong true false
[1:21:39] either side but the ones that will walk
[1:21:42] that edge Walk the Line
[1:21:44] and obey the real world and Promises of
[1:21:48] God for this age hallelujah amen and
[1:21:52] just as King when he realized that he
[1:21:56] had come to the height of all he could
[1:21:58] do and all he could present was flowers
[1:22:01] and fruits the fruits of his hands and
[1:22:04] his labor and his brother with no effort
[1:22:07] didn't look all he did was walk behind a
[1:22:10] bunch of sheep all day doing nothing it
[1:22:12] seems
[1:22:14] because he's just walking behind sheep
[1:22:16] he's not actually working up his he's
[1:22:18] not he's just walking behind sheep
[1:22:22] hey man oh my so I did all that for God
[1:22:27] I sacrificed I fasted I prayed for 10
[1:22:32] days 20 days I've been in the Bible and
[1:22:36] the message for for for so many years
[1:22:38] you know I gave to this hospital and it
[1:22:41] profited you nothing and I did this and
[1:22:45] I did that and he says except you get
[1:22:47] the revelation of the word of God the
[1:22:49] grace the charity God's love shown
[1:22:52] towards you by giving you this
[1:22:54] Revelation you profited you nothing
[1:22:57] amen my brother's sister what an hour
[1:23:01] hallelujah amen but God wants us to see
[1:23:05] this until we are so strong in the power
[1:23:08] of His might Satan cannot shake you he
[1:23:11] cannot move you and none of the
[1:23:13] deceptions will work amen so Justice
[1:23:17] came when he sees it growing more and
[1:23:19] more
[1:23:20] yeah you know for people to listen to
[1:23:23] him
[1:23:25] he's got to kill his brother
[1:23:28] right
[1:23:29] because if his brothers it's just like
[1:23:31] when Jesus and the Pharisees and the
[1:23:33] Sadducees were here
[1:23:35] the people were listening to what Jesus
[1:23:37] have to say is that right and say oh my
[1:23:41] if we don't shut this guy up then then
[1:23:44] they're gonna follow him and they're not
[1:23:47] going to follow us anymore so for them
[1:23:49] to come back to the synagogue for them
[1:23:52] to come back to the rabbinical
[1:23:53] priesthood for them to come back to
[1:23:56] these Traditions that we have and so on
[1:23:59] we've got to get rid of him crucify him
[1:24:02] that will now come against the Bride of
[1:24:06] Jesus Christ in the same way but not on
[1:24:09] a mountain not with a sword not with a
[1:24:13] spear but with rumors
[1:24:16] with lies
[1:24:18] with accusations
[1:24:20] look before I go to a foreign country to
[1:24:25] preach the word of God I'm not I'm there
[1:24:28] just maybe for an hour and and somebody
[1:24:30] is saying something and when they're
[1:24:33] speaking right out they're speaking and
[1:24:36] right away can discern that people have
[1:24:39] gone ahead of me and caused me much pain
[1:24:42] oh my I I just have to keep quiet and
[1:24:47] watch and listen and do whatever I have
[1:24:48] to do I go to another foreign country
[1:24:52] out in the Pacific somewhere there and
[1:24:55] then you find uh things run ahead and
[1:25:00] people trying to do dessert I discern
[1:25:04] this brother and I discern that brother
[1:25:07] you're telling me you deserve that and
[1:25:09] I'm looking at you and I'm seeing
[1:25:11] everything that you're doing and you're
[1:25:13] telling me that you're Discerning when I
[1:25:15] know that that's nothing but the Acuity
[1:25:18] of human perception
[1:25:21] the person that really has that kind of
[1:25:24] thing they don't even know how they know
[1:25:28] you can't teach that you can't learn
[1:25:30] that it's not something that you can
[1:25:34] discern when you feel like discerning
[1:25:37] or or something no it's God an
[1:25:41] individual when he Wills
[1:25:46] amen it can't even be explained praise
[1:25:49] the name of the Lord praise God
[1:25:51] hallelujah amen glory to God so he
[1:25:55] murdered his brother
[1:25:58] and there again the bride will come to
[1:26:01] the place
[1:26:02] where she is going to be literally
[1:26:05] crucified or murdered
[1:26:10] because they're going to murder your
[1:26:12] character
[1:26:13] is that right
[1:26:15] they murder your character and kill it
[1:26:18] because what they're getting at is
[1:26:20] killing the ministry
[1:26:22] it's trying to get at the word that is
[1:26:25] in you that they don't come out
[1:26:27] that it doesn't get a chance to express
[1:26:29] itself and even if it expresses itself
[1:26:33] they put a shadow a dark cloud on it oh
[1:26:38] my oh
[1:26:39] he's got a lot of words
[1:26:42] so so you start listening to his words
[1:26:45] rather than your spirit Discerning the
[1:26:48] meaning and seeing what God has back of
[1:26:50] all that amen you you're thrown off he
[1:26:53] does everything like that in every way
[1:26:56] that he possibly can amen hallelujah and
[1:27:01] uh as the Bible says they begin to pour
[1:27:04] coals of Fire
[1:27:07] on the bride's head
[1:27:10] think about it calls a fire on her to
[1:27:14] persecute her in every way but just as
[1:27:18] God's first Masterpiece was smitten on
[1:27:21] Calvary
[1:27:22] so will this bride which is the
[1:27:25] Masterpiece of God for this hour She is
[1:27:27] again going to be smitten amen she will
[1:27:31] be struck by the day by the evil that is
[1:27:35] in this day that we are living in amen
[1:27:39] praise God hallelujah I'm so glad that
[1:27:43] we are living in this day aren't you
[1:27:44] happy
[1:27:46] amen praise God smitten
[1:27:49] bruise rejected of men all that rejected
[1:27:54] of men are not just natural men ordinary
[1:27:58] men but also the religious system
[1:28:01] shall be rejected of that amen remember
[1:28:07] anointed ones at the end time
[1:28:09] thus said the Lord
[1:28:12] First Timothy second Timothy 3 18 in the
[1:28:18] last days this Journeys and jambres will
[1:28:21] again be on the Earth
[1:28:24] he's not talking about them physically
[1:28:26] coming back but he's saying the spirit
[1:28:29] of those men will be back here on the
[1:28:32] Earth
[1:28:33] and notice
[1:28:35] see their impersonation
[1:28:38] is for you to see what is right and what
[1:28:42] is wrong
[1:28:43] they'll do the same miracles
[1:28:47] impersonating even the true word
[1:28:51] amen see Hallelujah because
[1:28:56] they remember the true word has already
[1:29:00] been quickened by the Holy Ghost and
[1:29:03] revealed to the True Believer amen so
[1:29:07] all they can do that is now try to copy
[1:29:10] it copy after that that's there now I
[1:29:16] know God will not let me tell you all
[1:29:19] about this at this time
[1:29:22] amen and to tell you what is really the
[1:29:26] truth are you listening
[1:29:29] but one day you are going to find out
[1:29:33] amen
[1:29:36] and at that day you will see that this
[1:29:41] was to make their folly manifested
[1:29:46] that wasn't right at the beginning in
[1:29:49] other words God allowed me to do that
[1:29:51] but it wasn't right at the beginning
[1:29:53] I'll tell you that one day but only if
[1:29:57] the Lord permits
[1:30:00] amen and they do the same Miracles but
[1:30:06] they did not and cannot do them until

[1:32:51] race
[1:32:51] and there are fewer and fewer people in
[1:32:55] the race
[1:32:56] nothing is wrong with the race but it's
[1:32:58] the endurance of the people that's in
[1:33:01] that race and as you go down to the end
[1:33:04] of the race then you appreciate those
