here that in the time of winter when you making that sacrifice to come that's when I believe that God blesses us um I know it's not a easy sacrifice but in every time when the people made a sacrifice God blessed them and it's not about the majority said where two or three are gathered in my name I'll be in your midst if you remember the story that I think talk about DWI Med that when that man when the lady was sing the tracks nobody showed up but one person that led to his conversion and recently something that was on Google about David Livingston they also talk about in the time of winter when the missionary went back to home Church to tell them to kind of um get people to go to Africa but he he preached and there was only Ed people it was a winter time but he was with the organist and he converted from that and became a missionary for the gospel of God so anytime sometime when you don't even feel like coming that's when you're going to get your blessings so you have to fight through and be here because do not forsake the Assembly of yourself even as the time appears amen so you can sit down Pastor Danny can you please lead us in prayer amen praise God let's pray father what an honor and what a priv tonight be here to receive your word to be in your presence Lord you were waiting for us even before we arve and now we know that you'll speak to our hearts because you'll an your word your minister brother Phil this evening Lord to just build yourself and allow you to speak to our hearts and our needs and I pray that you'll just pour out a bless father will not pra glory lordes amen okay I think the L scripture but I'm going to cut it off somewhere along the line um it's m 2 Kings 6 8-23 I might cut up I don't want to I won't let you stay for too long 2 Kings chapter 6 verse 8 to 23 I think I'll cut it up somewhere yeah okay then the king of Syria W against Israel and took counsel with his servants saying in such and such a place shall be my camp and the man of God sent unto the king of Israel saying beware beware that thou pass not such a place for th that the Ser are come down and the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warn him off and saved himself thereof and not once or nor twice so so many times therefore the heart of the king of Syria was so troubl for this thing and he called his servants and said unto them will ye not show me which of us is of the king of Israel and one of his servants said n my Lord oh oh King but elishah the prophet that is in Israel tell the king of Israel the words that speakers in thy bed chamber verse 13 and he said go and spy where he is that I may sent and fetch him and it was told him saying behold he's in Doan here our former pastor always talk about it that how can you go and look for somebody who knows what is happening in your chamber yeah and when the servant of the man of God was risen early and gone forth behold and host Compass the city both with horses and CHS and the servant said unto him alas my master how shall we do and he answered fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them and Elisha prayed and said Lord I pray thee open his eyes that he may see and the Lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and cheros of fire R about Elisha um just let's Isaiah 651 and2 if our title the title is um the opening of the spiritual eyes of the bright the opening of the spiritual eyes so Isaiah 651 and2 I am s of them that ask not for me I'm fond of them that sought me not I said behold me behold me unto a nation that was not called by my name I have spread out my hands all the day onto the rebellious people which work in a way that was not good after their own thoughts Heavenly Father please bless the reading of your word in Jesus name amen please be seated yeah so um my title is the opening of your spiritual eyes because um we see from our heart but not from our eyes sometimes um we have to forgive some people because sometime maybe somebody will be looking right in your face but his heart is not even right there so they might not even greet you or ignore you and going to be angry but maybe that person heart is not even there so we see through our heart not our eyes our eyes is good God gave us our eyes to contact um our five senses but when it comes the word of God you cannot see God through only your natural eye it's like um reading the Bible you can read this Bible from A to Z from Genesis to Revelation 20 times a year but if God has start open your spiritual eyes it's just worse it's just letters because the Bible said that the letter kth but the spirit giveth life amen so we always need to ask Lord for the opening of our spiritual eyes that's why the the word said that our eyes of understanding he has open up at last so we as Believers we are blessed that by the grace of God God has opened our eyes of understanding the story we talking about G ha his natural eyes were 100% open but all that he could see was those enemies around them but Elisha been typee of the Bride he saw beyond what the servant was seeing and he prayed and said oh God Open the Eyes of the young man and when his eyes was open then he can see what elishah was saying was seeing so the god of God the Lord has called us to this reveal word of God Amen and you cannot let somebody see it unless God open that person eyes then he can see like you are seeing other than that you can just do what you can just try sorry you can just try to convince the person and braad Des always said if I have the power I can just open your head like that and put the word in no one can do that it's only given by God and it's h no one can open anyone's Blind Eye so what this young man failed to know is that the scripture said the angel of God encamp around those who love him so um being the love of God Elisha loving God Angels were around him all the time so is you and me some of us would have been dead for long long time but the grace of God has kept as this far the angel of God encamp around us even on the street driving how many times last week I was driving I would have even had a big accident I was just on my Lane somebody just coming from um I was just um like merging and I haven't even tried to merge and the person in in the last Lane was just moving towards to where me I was merging there crazy people around but the spirit for God and Camp around us it protect us every day every morning he is the one protecting us that's why the Bible say greater is he that is in you than he that in the world the world the god that lives in you is greater than any circumstances you may encounter because he's the same yesterday today and forever he's there for you it doesn't matter what the spirit of God encamp around those who love him and M of us would have been dead already but by the grace of God and God has kept it all this to the end of all the consumation he will never leave you nor forsake you even though sometimes your natural eyes will prove something different but don't look at what you are seeing with your eyes because Faith goes beyond what you see it goes beyond what your eyes see and without faith it's impossible to please God and faith is a revelation and having a new birth is what Jesus Christ revealed himself personally to you will give you that new birth without the new birth you can't please God because he's the same yesterday today and forever amen and what is happening now is that in Revelation 3:17 I think I read it shortly in Revelation 3:17 it says that because thou sayest I'm rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou are what wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I canel Thee to buy of me gold try in the fire that thou may be rich and white rment that thou may be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and they anoint thy eyes with I love that thou made what see so the promise of this age Lord this AG the people are what blind naked miserable but because they are natural eyes they don't see that they are blind and they are naked and they don't even see nothing so they need the opening of their spiritual eyes to see God and without that your spiritual eyes being open you can never see God you can never please God but we are blessed that by his grace he has opened our eyes of understanding and in every age in every time the True Believers for that age God opened their spiritual eyes to see what he is doing Amen in the time of he said that the true worshippers must worship me what in truth and in spirit so in the time of Luther when the truth and the spirit was revealed to him he was able to please God because they were pleas recognize what was doing what God was doing in that Time by their natural eyes their eyes being their spiritual eyes being open to know the spir the truth and spirit for their age in the time of Methodist exact same thing God opened those people spiritual eyes to see that what John Wesley was truth and they all really what behind him and serve God because they have the truth and spirit for that age and Pentecost exact same thing when their eyes their spiritual eyes open they understood and and what was able to please God and God send us William myON Braham to fulfill Malachi 456 Revelation 10:7 to restore all the truth for the eyes of understanding of those who are God's children to receive the word for that day and their eyes were open but now is Elijah and Elisha now the spirit of God God has taken his Prophet but the same spirit that was in the prophet is here it's like double portion Elijah Elisha amen and what is leading us to is revealing himself to US Open our eyes of understanding every day that we comeing here he's revealing himself to us slowly slowly until we be caught up to meet up the Lord in the end that is the promise that is the word for the day that is what we are here to fulfill we are the ones to fulfill the Rapture there's no one else there's no any other age but the bride of Christ we are here to fulfill the Rapture and that is the Fulfillment of our day that's we have the truth and the spirit for the day so when God reveal himself to you and make this clear to you because your first revelation that's when you what the Rapture started but it's going to lead goes on onto what the final thing so we are blessed that our eyes of understanding God has opened it at last the original life yes is grace and grace that's why in Isaiah 65 ver1 and 2 I think I read it again it says that I am s of them who I'm s of them that ask not for me I'm F of them that sought me not I said behold I unto that was not called by so in other words you did not see God God was what seeking after you just like the eagle story it was that mother Eagle looking for that egg that he left somewhere so it's you and me that Papa Eagle God himself was on was looking for you he said that you have not chosen me I chose you before the foundation of the world why did God chose you because of election because of elected seed you are part of him so before the foundation of the world he being god with his full knowledge know that you're going to accept him so you not wait for you to accept him first but he made a provision and a way for you so in our own ways we were running away from him our life everything nothing none of us thought God but God came after because we are part of him of him so it's based on what election it's elective love that has brought us all here and that same God is here he's the same yesterday today and forever it's not by W of righteousness by his grace and grace alone and is based on what is based on elective love amen and the eyes of understand because listen even the Jews in um Romans 11:25 they were what blinded so that you and I can be what drafted in and I believe that if we wake up every morning and recognize that God has opened our eyes of understanding in the midst of the age where people are blinded as blind as blind can be we have to give God thanks every morning every day wake up for the revelation of this he has given to us it's beyond everything Revelation more than anything else that's what we are Holding On by the grace of God his elective love he has chose you he has chosen me before the foundation of the world and he he been s he's been seeking us all this time it doesn't matter what but God loves you he cares for you so that love of God imagine like if you that has received the word of God for the day if you have been transported back the time of Noah you could have be part of Noah's family that eight people that received the Revelation for the day just think about that out of millions of people and now out of billions God by his grace has elected you and me that's the greatest thing that could ever happened to anyone of us because he sought to us he looked for us he came for us he chose us and he ordain us Amen to this gospel to this Truth for our age amen he's the same yesterday today and forever amen and this thing you cannot buy it he gives and remember someone like Nicodemus he knew the scriptures A to Z from those times he was a master and he came the Lord Jesus Christ but because his spiritual eyes was closed and it was not open he couldn't even understand to be born again and he was asking how can I be born again I have to go back into my mother's womb to be born again he was blind spiritually he couldn't see nothing but he was a master so it's not how much you know the letter the letter kill it but the spirit giveth life amen this thing is based on elective seedr said somewhere that king after God told him to go and make a good sacrifice he couldn't make it because there was a wrong seed over there how can he make a perfect sacrifice with the wrong seed it will not work but Abel with a good seed a right seed in him he was was able to make a sacrifice that God testified of it so before God will testify of your of anything from you you have to have that good seed you have to be part of him so that when you do it he will reveal it to you and when you do it it will be a pleasing unto him with those with the wrong SE they cannot do it like K they will try to make it look more beautiful on the outside big Cathedral and it it it all go to your s and everything but God is not in it amen he is in his word for the day and without him revealing the truth to you you can't say it you can be the the they call them themselves the bishop or Cardinal or whatever they going to call you without the grace of God that God reveal himself to you your worship is in vain and say in vain they what they worship me doing what the Commandments of of of men and traditions they have added a lot to this Bible and bring all kind of manner Traditions baptizing them the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost and ly men to pre doing everything contrary worse than when he was here the first time when they were exchanging and buying things in the church and now they have make it a what moneymaking scheme when brah explained in the Simplicity um I think in the the seven6 when you read the first part god in Simplicity when you come to church you have to come to reverence even the in the in the in the Cent nobody have to talk unless it's absolutely necessary become reverent and expect God God will show up because you have what as um we have obeyed that word because in token said that total obedience to the full word of God entitles you to token you can't come in the the house of God lacally anyhow you want and expect to receive something from God you have to come reverence pray up expecting God to show up you don't need someone to come and Shake you up it's not the St Le duty to come and and and Shake you up you have to shake yourself up from home you have to pray out before you come here you have to do your part before you get here don't look at anybody when everyone of us put a lick of fire and come God will show up amen because remember in the time of Solomon before even Christ was crucified before the blood was given he prayed earnestly and said that the the place become Smoky that even the uh the high priest not even Minister why the presence of God was there because they do their part God is here I'm not saying his story the presence of God is here God has show himself over and over in this church he has Vindicated Us in so many ways but you can get get more more of him by doing our part by giving reverence the word of God by not coming to the church and talking the not coming and they talking the sanctuary when it's not necessary here has to be come with reverence praying seeking God the 30 minutes that's why you come here 30 minutes before time to be prayed up Amen to seek God Amen because he's here Elijah God is here amen that miraculus is not ended with him he still the same yesterday today and forever amen he's willing to move to do more than you can even think or even not expect because this God is a mighty God he lives in you so I'm the people the god that they looking for one time they going that he's living inside of you amen that God that he lives in you he's the same yesterday you are part of him and if you are part of him then you have to worship him because you are wir to worship God that's why you created for to Worship the Lord Jesus Christ that's our purpose in this life apart from that everything is was it's all bonus the Cs the wife the children they all bonuses amen but the main thing is to Worship the Lord Jesus Christ with all your heart with all your mind with all your soul with everything within you to worship the true Living God his name is the Lord Jesus Christ he's the same yesterday today and forever we are wir to Worship the Lord Jesus Christ amen can somebody give him Applause he's the same God he has in changed amen our God is good all the time amen praise God I feel so good this evening amen I'm serving a living God he has never lost a battle amen and he will never lose a patient amen hallelujah he's God he's on time God Amen he never changes hallelujah praise God I I think I'm going to read another scripture Bible Bible said this you don't mind me reading a lot of scriptures Matthew chapter 13 verse 11 he answered 11 to 17 is that right he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given for whosoever had to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever had not from him shall be taken away even that he had therefore speak I to them in Parables because they seeing see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaias which said by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive for this people's heart is what is wor gross and their ears are dll of what hearing and the eyes they have closed let's at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and shall be what understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them verse 16 but blessed are your eyes thank you for they see and your ears for day here we have to give God thanks because blessed are your eyes that you shall see amen you didn't make yourself like that you can't even help God sometime reveals so many things to you we didn't do nothing but it's so clear maybe the next person that out there doesn't know what is going on and God can make you design so many everything is going on but the next person don't even have a clue that is what's going on it's not what you work for this is by grace and grace and somebody why did God do that he's a sovereign God and they ask why did God allow this why did God allow that is God having pleasure that's why in the end is God having pleasure so you are great you are privilege that for his pleasure we were created so for this cause Pharaoh was created that God's glory will be what glorified he was had was Harden so that God's glory could be glorified remember there arose I think I'm going ahead of that's fine there arose a pharaoh who did not know um who did not Jo Joseph but before that Pharaoh get to the power God was also dealing with Moses is that right and Moses was also in the wilderness and God was dealing with him and that pharaoh who came with not know Joseph persecute the children of God he P put persecution on them so it is in our time there is going to be a pharaoh who do not know freedom of religion and they're going to put persecution on the True Church of God but remember as fair rameses was growing up Moses was there God dealing with Moses so he came to br a clash and that Clash Moses won God in Moses have the victory so is you and me when the time comes which is closer than closer when the Pharaoh is around and they take away that a freedom of worship God is going to raise a standard amen and he's going to do a quick work through us and very soon you're going to go home so do not scared of anything just worship God the best that you know because you are an eagle a son or daughter of the Living God and he promise he will never leave you nor forsake you he's with you even in you now because the said it goes wherever go um it the wind blow where it's listed and if you've been led by God then the devil cannot track your moment because one time you can't be going to the spirit of God will lead you and go to a different direction amen and to surprise because he can't detect you you can't know your movement because you being led by the spirit of God Amen and we are the children of the what the most high amen so I'm still basing my thought on the natural on the spiritual eye open remember someone like Samson when he became naturally blind when he was captured and he was blinded didn't see anywhere naturally he was blinded is that right but at that time his spiritual eyes got what open and he began to repent in his heart talk about it he began to cry to God and ask for forgiveness so is you and me if you've done anything wrong got to make it right because the Bible said that if your heart condemns you not then ask whatever you are but if your heart condemns how can you go to God and ask him anything so Samson make all things right even with his natural eye closed he made things right that that's why they ask um cross whatever that songs he said I don't want your millions of dollars they said that how can you know him with your ey blinded mind said I shall know him I shall know him by the footprint in his hand amen that inspiration C what cist him that even though he's blind he will still see him there naturally blind but the spiritual eyes was open so he have that confidence that even though his nice is blind naturally he shall also see God Amen so it's not the your natural eye that is important to be open but the most important that your open of your spiritual eyes amen because blessed are your eyes for they shall they see amen how God is Awesome Hallelujah he so good and so wonderful amen Samson his dying moment when he was blinded the Bible said that he killed more with the blinded eyes that when he has a natural eye because he made things right so you and me will have more Victory when you make things right with God we set your heart as our pastor is preaching set your heart guide your heart make sure everything is right and God in his own time whatever portion that he wants you to fulfill he going to make you fulfill it because remember unless God is finished with you no one can take you away nothing can take you away from this Earth job in this time the devil said God you put a hedge around him that's why I can't touch him is that right so as a son or daughter of God and God gave him permission because he knew what job was made up of Amen so all the trials that the devil triy him none of them because his heart was on Christ his the spiritual eyes was open and in the midst of his try when everything seemed blank and all hope was gone his friends those miserable comforters saying everything that they want to talk about him then his eyes got open and he said I know my redeemer liveth even in my flesh I shall worship Him amen that same God is here opening our spiritual understanding every day then hallelujah amen so the main thing is it's not it's good to have positions at your work or in the church or it's all good don't get me wrong but everyone of them will come to an end the most important position for you to know that you a son or daughter of God is important than anything else everything will pass away but that position will never pass away amen because the heaven and but his word shall never pass and you are part of that word amen so if you are part of that word you shall not pass away you can never perish like God going perish because you can't be perished you are part of him so that position in Christ is very important essential it's the most vital thing in life and what the devil is trying to do is that he comes and because you are here through Amnesia sometime you don't know who you are sometimes but God is constantly reminding us for you to recognize who you are when you fully recognize who you are that the devil cannot touch you anymore because can Shake him off amen because greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world recognizing who you are is the most important thing because it's your position not your condition your condition can change that inter your position never change amen so he's the god of the H Mountains and the god of what of the valley amen so when you are even down in the valley remember he's with you the same way you up in the high is of you down in the valley is still with you only thing you have to recognize is who you are if you recognize who you are fully in every circumstances you walk out with your chest out because know that all things not some things all things work together for good to them that love God so everything will work for your good it doesn't matter how bad it might sin it doesn't matter how the situation will look for it will work for your good so I encourage everyone tonight never give up everything work for your good it doesn't matter what our God is awesome God he's the same yesterday today and forever he will provide all your needs he will fight your battles he'll do everything for somewhere in Psalm 44 let me see Psalm 44 over here in Psalm 44 he said that verse two how did thou drive out the Heathen with thy hand and plant them how them how this ack the people and cast them out for they got not the land in possession by their own salord neither did their own arm save them but thy right hand and thy arm and the light of thy countenance because thou H has favor unto them amen for vers vers for I will not trust in my B neither shall my sword save me but thou H has saved us from our enemies and has put them to shame that he Us in other words it's not your B it's not your sword it's not your power said not by by power but by not by power but not by power or by might but by mind spirit says the Lord is the spirit of God that is doing not your own wisdom not your own H your own power or how powerful you are or how the knowledge you have on your job or anything but it's a arm of God the hand of God that is following you he is the one leading us he's the one guiding us he's the one giving us the inspiration you said that dream yourself a dream you can't dream yourself a dream how can you dream yourself a dream you you cannot even add a Str to your heart you can't do nothing he knows even the ha on your head even right now he knows every thought that is going through your heart he's a wonderful God so the more we relax and let go and let him have remnance the better it is because sometimes a human being want to take control you want to control things but you should just leave everything in his hand and he going to let everything happen in his own time and get things done the right time amen because he the same yesterday today and forever our God is good he's also of God he doesn't change he hasn't change and you will never change he's the same yesterday today and forever amen praise God hallelujah hallelujah and one other thing our spiritual eyes can only be opened by what faith and faith is a revelation only by the word of God bro so faith is a revelation without God open your spiritual High you cannot do anything like Jo Joshua and Caleb they went with the 10 other spies naturally their eyes saw the the enemies were giants with all the 10 spies but their spiritual eye were so enlightening that they didn't see how tall those Giants are there spiritual eye went to the promise of God and that promise said I've given you the land everywhere your foood stop is given to you so they didn't care how high the giant those enemies are their confidence was in the word of God and that gave them the victory that let them stood out of the 12 out of the two out of the 10 and have and now they were the only one that was saved in the time of Moses because why they didn't look at the things with their natural eye they cut it through their spiritual eye and that what gave them the confidence that those people who be C for person we are able more than able to conquer them why because they believe in the word of God and faith is based on the word of God your base has to have foundationu and that Foundation should be on the word of God anything contrary to it run away from it is death it do doesn't matter what any anybody can do if that does not line up with the word of the Lord of God for today run for your life that faith has to have a foundation and that Foundation is in the word of God that's why Joshua and Caleb could come out what Victorious that's why there were only two who could stand in the midst of 2 million people and you are one in a million out of billion 6 million ever God chose you sister God chose you God chose you God elected you out of the millions why because of elective love amen and we are not leaving any ho behind because the enemy like to boast he only like to put you in a corner he he wants to bully you and said

the mind of God when he said that eek um prepare your house and get ready but he prayed and said I walk with you with a perfect heart amen and I believe that the true bride of Christ today can say God

so you can go to God say God I've worked with you with a perfect heart I need this oh I need this for your glory and H and it's more than able to Grant it to you if your motive is right and objective

changed he's the same yesterday today and forever he's an awesome God Amen Hallelujah praise God Amen and amen I love this holy ghost thing man and I believe that Daniel also have that spiritual eyesight and have that Faith he didn't look at the lions that he were going to put him in his spiritual eyes were so open to such an extent that he went there freely the Lion's then and God shut the lion's mouth the Hebrew children their spiritual eyes were open and they said I like that when I first got the Bible I was so blessed he said that we know our God is able to deliver us but even if you chose not to we are not going to bow down to that ad amen that's what that spiritual did to them they have confidence in the word of God that God is able to deliver them am and that same God is here tonight brother whatever you have need of he's able to what bring it to pass amen if your confidence is in the word of God if our spiritual Eyes Are Open oh man our eyes of understand just sing it from when he come here he has opened up at last true Jubilee have sounded oh man we are the original Life The Original Seed oh man praise God hallelujah oh God is good man I'm so excited tonight brother Dan Pastor Dan amen hallelujah our eyes of understanding he has opened up at last amen um can you please uh Grace put this quotation for me Third Exodus paragraph 242 yeah I I think I um I paraphrase but I want to read it too he said well if Joshua and Caleb could call those amalekites and heiti and jebusite as though they wasn't there yet twice or three or four times their size and the natural mind at kisia when the spice went over ah we can't do it they are too much well we are like grasshoppers side of them but Caleb and Joshua seen God's promise said we are more than able to do it why they are they were looking God said I give you the land see the Canan might don't get it the spiritual mind fix it up and why want to ask ask you something why didn't Egyptians see these things because they were not elected God told Abraham before it happened get it you sleeping church God told abam your seed will so in Egypt for what 400 years and I'll bring them out that's the reason they seen it because they were elected to see it they are the election Israel was elected to see the the sign of God and they went out of Egypt where the unbelievers perished and today God is calling his elected the spiritual Seed of Abraham by faith that he had in the word of God don't you see the spiritual seed today congregation says amen that don't see the intellectual Church it sees the word and it's been called from those big denominations and in the presence of Jesus Christ amen was that clear did you get it all right we go further they elected only Dr DL P they never see it they wasn't elected so it's based on Election thank you amen and we are the elected seed of God and because we have that electing of God our spiritual eyes are what open th I believe that when Paul when his spiritual eyes were open he saw that Pillar of Fire but some said the people of that didn't see it but he saw it because it was for him amen that same God is here he has opened our eyes of understanding so he's the same yesterday today and forever and in conclusion just going to wind up over here um Peter and the rest of the Apostles they when they went for that fishing the Bible said that they toil all night nothing was happening but when the Lord Jesus Christ told because their natural eyes they know that they have done this they've done everything that they have to do but they not when they did that when they the Lord met them and said cast your net on this side even though they could have said that you have done all night we're not going to do it but I believe that the their spiritual eye got kicking and they said that you have to all night but at the word PR do it so I'm trying to say to that it doesn't matter what you've done God's word believe it and it will what come to pass and when they obey it they got more than they have done for the whole the whole night and he said I'm even ashamed and he cried unto God and that same God is here tonight he's able to give you all your needs no Mary also said the same thing when she said that at Thy word Lord if you were to be here she would not have died but at TH word said believeth thou they said as th word and his her brother came back he raised she raised his her brother back why her spiritual eye got open amen so the opening of the spiritual eye it make things impossible become possible there was a story that braam talk about um a young man who was sick at the hospital I think everyone has heard it before and then he was going to visit that hospital and they said they won't let him go because he has a children he said if the Catholic priest came to come they would allow him to go and they allow him to go and then pray for the person but the nurse told the parents of the children that we haven't seen this case anyone ever come back to life so the chart shows that your son is going to die but the man responded and said that all that you can see is the chat but I'm looking at the promise of God amen and when he believed that his spiritual eye got open he believed the word of God his eyes his stand God healed the prophet prayed for him he got healed and the next time said became a missionary and married with three children why the that spiritual eyes pop open amen so God opened his spiritual eyes and he believed things that was not possible in the eyes of the doctors and the nurses and that same God is here tonight has open your eyes for you it is given to know the kingdom of God Bron you can you please come but to them it is not given so you are blessed and he hold the key of David when he open no one can shout and when he shut no one can open but that key he's given to is what the key of Faith it's a revelation it opened all doors amen praise God he's awesome God original life
