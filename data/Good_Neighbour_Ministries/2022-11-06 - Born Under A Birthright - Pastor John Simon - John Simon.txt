today first of all we're going to have the sermon the message after which at about uh one or a little laughter will stop for about 15 or 20 minutes for a coffee and some cookies and to those of you who are will be involved in the membership meeting I wish that will all be made clear to you by the deacons uh then we will come back into the hall and meet for about a half an hour or so and then we will make what announcements we have to make may the Lord bless you real good here today praise the Lord God bless you all and thank you so much appreciate the singing The Worship the song leader the musicians all wonderful real blessing and I welcome all of you here in the house of the Lord especially uh this young couple we appreciate you so much good to see you again uh Romans 9 13. Romans 9 13. and our topic today will be one you know born under a Birthright born under a Birthright and we like to read our brief scripture here today as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated that's her scripture I'll read it once more Jacob as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated praise the Lord a gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for the reading of the word the written word we pray now that the Holy Spirit will draw near may his divine presence and his power o God flow through US unto us and Mary receive that which you have given to us here today that we may feed on the living bread of life recognizing father you are not some God In the far off somewhere but you are here with us Among Us in us working with us For Your Glory and Honor we pray that those who are in here those who are in the land of the internet watching listening May the Holy Spirit minister to all our hearts wherever we are in the name of Jesus Christ to the glory of God Amen God bless you please be seated thank you Hallelujah in the message called hearing recognizing and acting on the word I believe it's paragraph into one brother Branham speaks and he says out of the same holy Realm Yonder that came salvation out of that realm comes also curses out of the same mother and father that projected Jacob also projected an Esau see it's all God he cannot change he cannot change his plans they have to go on just the same and all Nature has to cope with it see you get what I mean it moves right on what he's saying is it doesn't stop with Jacob that moves on and because God's plan cannot change it has to go on all time until it Blends back into eternity because God is an unchanging God and he is perfect with the first decision so it doesn't have to change it just continues on the atmosphere the times the seasons the Fashions all that may change around it but it Remains the Same now you get what I mean that moves right on you uh there has to be somebody lost for somebody else to be saved see now if there wouldn't he wasn't a savior you see he had to be a made a savior so that we could have a savior and that deep calls to the Deep amen praise God in other words your need created the supply and the supply is there to meet the need so the Deep calls to the deep it just goes back and forth like between a husband and wife sometimes they don't have to talk but there's an invisible something that goes between them you can't see it but you can't tell them it's not real they can't see God they can't see the moving or the spirit but you can't tell us it's not real because it's real within our hearts and it's real so solid as as a as a tangible something because we know that it's really there amen praise the Lord now if we go to our text we'll just read simply what it says here Jacob have I love now you must realize that before the world was even formed before anything was done before Jacob was born as the scripture itself says God loved him before he was even born and in there we see the doctrine of predestination uh now God loved you if you are an elected seed part of the elect lady that we call the Bride of Jesus Christ then you will find you were loved by God before the world was even born now of course before to say that is to already tell you you are an eternal being because you couldn't be loved by God and just be temporal if you were loved by God you not were but you are eternal you were just like he says you are and you will ever be there will no be no time when you will not be there if you are an eternal being according to the word of the Living God now Jacob have I loved think of it Jacob a crook a trickster a liar a cheat a mama's boy a manipulator uh you know a planner a schemer uh that's what he wants but God says I love him I love her that is him saying doesn't matter what the world says anything about you doesn't matter what they think about you I The Great I Am I love you praise God that's what we should be concerned about not the opinions of churches not your opinions of the world not the opinions of any preacher doesn't matter who it is we have respects for that but we must keep our eyes on the word of the Living God Jacob have I loved that one that the world hits I love thank God for that brother I might not have been here you may not have been here but thank God he loved me why should he love us so we don't know we can't explain it we have no rational ideas of how that could be what good is there in us but Jacob have I loved it blows the human mind to think that one like a David that was a a womanizer a killer uh a warrior a bloody hands and everything else and God turns around and says I love him praise God that's the way our God is this outward mind that we have here will do all things because it comes from Satan great worked on God designed that and then he turns around and what you do with this he wants to accuse the man on the inside that's the seed that God has placed there and God is revealing to us no he's a liar yes you can't deny these things were done in your flesh but the man that is in you the seed of God don't not commit sin it can't because that is of god therefore you are Justified just as if you're never did it in the first place oh praise God I'm happy that we are not just forgiven but we are Justified praise the Lord glory to God see similar if now look if you did do the thing if this man inside did do the thing and you were uh forgiven the Forgiveness or the pardon tells that you you actually did it so I got to forgive you for it but brother Branham is telling us that when you move past this flesh that can be forgiven but this man on the inside being Eternal and never did nothing in the first place he is Justified he's never done anything that person that God placed in you hasn't done a thing and you are just as if you have never done it in the first place and you ought to take God's word rather than your own thoughts or your own mind God is greater than your heart amen I'm so thankful to God for Jacob because in Jacob I see myself on every other believer that God loved us before we were in our mother's womb praise God hallelujah now when I use the topic burn under a Birthright I'm really saying that you were born in this natural world with the right to have the true birth by the Holy Spirit or the New Birth you come with that right in you and that right was given by the fact that God placed in you his seed Gene let me go to brother Branham I do not believe in the Mormon doctrine of the pre-existence of Souls I do not believe in reincarnation I do not believe in transmigration of Souls but you see I have to be careful here and you be careful and see this for it is not the person yes like I was just saying that comes predestinated eternally from God it is the word or the seed of God in them that comes predestinated to you eternally from God and that all happened way back there too far back for your human mind to grasp the Eternal God had in him Eternal thoughts okay Eternal sons and daughters because my thoughts are my children I I give birth to thoughts you give birth to thoughts and God's thoughts were his children amen and him being Eternal you are eternal ah we say it lightly it sounds just like uh you know it sounds like that but when that reality strikes your heart through the revelation of the word of God you realize that you are not of this world you're not of this realm you're from another realm all together you're from that you're not from this Earth with all its systems you're from the Commonwealth of Grace as Paul has said we are aliens down here they're they're looking everywhere for the aliens and we are already here amen we are the eternal life ones it is right here praise God you see and they're looking everywhere but we are already here and when the time comes we are going back where we come from for the glory of God amen you see Eternal thoughts thoughts that are decreed that's why he said Jacob have I loved in other words all the Jacobs all them characters like that that they can't see what's behind there or they can't see what's hidden back of that mask I love Jacob because I see something deep in him they can't see and that's something in him I love praise God hallelujah before either was born and either had done any good or any evil God said Jacob I love and Esau I hated isn't it wonderful to know we serve a god like that that knows our beginning to our natural ending amen because we are going back to him when this comes to an end see it was a thought then and that thought become expressed in other words that thought was allowed to come to the Earth amen manifested and expressed as a human being and we just like the Earth as he said is a manifestation of God's thought you and I come as manifestations of God's thoughts amen so God's thoughts come material and then that thought of course become expressed and God you see brought back Jacob now he just made a short statement but what is brought back means that there comes a time when that thought will wander and some of these thoughts wandered away we call it in the world wandered away from the original path and plan that God had and it doesn't matter what he's saying is it doesn't matter where or how long that thought wanders away from God hallelujah Jacob you see then God brought back Jacob Hallelujah I'm glad I serve a God that can bring me back right in line with his word doesn't matter where I wonder how you wonder he'll bring us back to the center of his word hallelujah amen praise God forevermore now now God brought Jacob back and he brought him back because Jacob alone was seen remember let me repeat Jacob alone was seed amen that is why he had respect to that book right praise God he respected the birthright Hallelujah no matter with all of his wanderings around all his partying all his this is lying back inside there something kept speaking to him and telling him giving him he still had a respect for God he still had a love for God's word he still had this thirst and his hunger for the Waters of life and the bread of life he still had this within his heart and always want to have it within his soul praise God forevermore so he had respect for the birthright respect for it and he believed God also for the Covenant that comes with that work right the Covenant that get comes from Abraham that God loves you without conditions God doesn't love you because you work hard in the church God doesn't love you because you fasted he doesn't love you more because you prayed more than the other person God doesn't love you more because you know more of this Bible than anybody else and that you can close your eyes like the rabbis and tell you about all the 66 books 29 here in the new and so many in the old and and go through all those things no that's wonderful but God doesn't love you more because you have that no sir he loves you just because he loves you amen doesn't matter the reason you are in his heart amen praise God hallelujah see you if you are the true seed then you see you will have respects for this word for this book right the right that you had to come to a birth now I will be proceeding on this as I go along praise the Lord for you see if you are a true seed you will hear the word that doesn't mean with your ears only but something in here is going to hear the word oh my you know you can have 20 men 30 men speaking singing or whatever but if you're really spiritual the spirit of God will be Elder tell you when you are hearing a sound that comes from heaven you are going to hear a certain sound that's only it only comes from the presence of God uh like uh one Minister I know when I just heard of the message we just heard of it and we're just playing one of those big reel to real tips on the Willing tip recorder and this man was a hospital administrator he was going home from work walking by and we had it so loud we heard Bang Bang Bang Bang on the door we said who's who could that be praying pain we rushed we open the door he says oh my God he says I don't know who it is there that's speaking but that voice is coming straight from the throne of grace Hallelujah Straight from Heaven and I'm going to believe it no matter what amen he recognized that was the voice of God nobody had witnessed to him nobody had told him but there is a ring there is a something that comes out amen and it's the voice behind the voice because it's the Holy Spirit trying to speak through a human vessel Hallelujah that's all we have to do and if you're an election there is no Works to to be able to know that or find that or hear that because God gives it to you [Applause] amen as I've said before you know that there's a special whistle that you can whistle and dogs alone can hear it human beings can't but that doesn't mean that there is not a real sound coming from back there amen but we are hearing a joyful sound we are hearing a a sound from heaven and they may not be able to hear it and want to know why why you got so attracted what's happening to you why why you love that there is something going on and if you don't recognize it God wants you to recognize it and the Holy Spirit will speak to you open up his word so that you will know who he is that he is a living God then bury him in a grave and he stayed there but that Immortal Almighty spirit that we call Jehovah has risen from the dead in the form of Jesus Christ and he is back on the Earth again once more Hallelujah the same yesterday today and forever praise the Lord I believe it he lives forevermore praise the Lord then if you hear the word the spirit will baptize you into the body of Christ Hallelujah filling you and empowering you and you will receive the word for your day amen hallelujah and for your age he puts that in at the end Hallelujah now see how clear the true evidence of the Holy Spirit comes when the word of God is revealed to you amen the ability to receive revelation Hallelujah born with the right to that Birthright praise the Lord amen now you see Jesus was a royal seed and he lived in a human body and when a spirit called to him while he was a word manifested thought it made him go to Jordan Hallelujah and then he abide The Obedience to the word the spirit said this is my beloved Son in whom I am pleased to dwell in amen that was Jesus back there this is the bride form of the son of man revealed it is a many membered body he was one because he was just a head of the body but now the body form of the brightest hair in many members and that same word that was said of Jesus is said of the Bride for the wife is a part of him it's not separate from him it's a part of him and what is said of the bridegroom is set of the Bride amen and hear this the son of man is being revealed in the last day and he says now this is my beloved Son in whom I am pleased to dwell in praise God God's place to dwell in you Hallelujah God's pleased to walk and talk in you and let the people bump shoulders with eternal life and don't even know it like they're dead when Jesus was here literally upon the Earth but he doesn't have to come back here physically again because physically he has the bright form here and he can walk around in the bright form and they can bump shoulders with eternal life amen hallelujah you see now the Holy Ghost was positioning him as the son now he is positioning us as a son or a daughter praise God Hallelujah for he was filled the same pattern holds a Pentecost and ever after that is that now at Pentecost and ever after that the same pattern it's not me telling you that I know I said it to you before I quoted this but he is saying this out of the Sumerian Church age and he's saying it that pattern Falls at Pentecost and ever after that Hallelujah and then he went out in demonstrated power receiving even Jesus at the time because he was in a man state had to receive the full revelation of God from God for that day how he was to live what he was to do how he had to go to the cross and die and all that was revealed to him praise God because he was born a man I'm not going to preach on that because you know over in Philippians he says that he learned obedience but because he actually came as a man God in a man so imagining God having to surrender submit humble himself to his own creation and learning from his mother and and Joseph obedience yeah and so on just take that thought and carry it out there and see how we should walk and conduct ourselves under that Spirit of Christ that comes into our hearts and lies praise the Lord amen I want to continue taking this thought little further here is that okay now he's saying I want to tell you you are born under a Birthright I repeat you are born under abort right well you know in the old days we will talk about sister hathi right and we would say oh she gave the right answer and that made her have the right to have a right birth praise God hallelujah amen what we know that we have the right to have the right birth because we're born under that birth right that right of having a new birth praise the Lord wonderful you know if you were born under that book right you know what's going to happen you know what's going to take place if you were born under that oh my they are not going to be able to knock you on your head in other words kill you because you're going to live anyhow praise God hallelujah Adele and see that priest will have to take a lamb that don't even have blemish on it and the lamb will have to die in your stead praise God you you see what I'm saying in other words you live because he died in your stand he was your substitute he took my place your place at Calvary we are not our own but we are bought with a price amen that's why love when the redeemed a gathering in wash like the snow and free from all sin how we will shout and how we will sing when the redeemed they're gathering in oh washed in the blood of the crucified one or Hallelujah that is why we are here in this morning because one died in our place we must live for him for he right for us praise God hallelujah see then when you know that you don't look at yourself anymore you look at your sacrifice hallelujah oh God don't even look at you anymore he looks at your sacrifice which is Jesus Christ can somebody say amen hallelujah oh my oh so I tell you do not look at yourself anymore hallelujah amen oh praise God can you say that you are you are you ever just raise your hand and say I'm not going to look at myself anymore I'm not going to look at myself anymore and even though we are saying that the Flesh on us is going to make us look back and look at this and look at that but you must withstand him with stand up push it off for you amen he says because you are going to say oh I am not worthy amen and sure you're not worthy you're not worthy nobody is Worthy but he is worthy and he is the one that we are trusting in amen praise the Lord but he is the one I'm not counting on what I have done Hallelujah aren't you glad about that amen we are all on good footing is that right because I can't go by what I've done Lord I'm gonna get a foot up on brother Bill I'm going to give a bigger offering than he did and I'm going to be closer inside that door of Salvation I am going to get that priest the animazili to just pray me in oh my no it doesn't work that way he knows it I know it you know it it doesn't work that way nobody goes up on anybody else in that way I am not counting on what I have done I don't eat pork I don't drink coffee I don't eat the unclean animals from the Old Testament you know because that brings me more in the presence of God and I fast so many times a week and all that see but you don't trust in what you have done all that we're doing now is in gratitude for what he has already done we are grateful let's sing that song I love so much here praise the Lord heavenly father I appreciate you heavenly father I appreciate you Heavenly Father I appreciate it you I love you I love I adore you I I bow down before you bow down before you Heavenly Father I pray I am not counting on what Hallelujah I am not counting on what I have done amen then I would never make it but I am looking to what he has done that is where I'm trusting him what he has done he is My Sacrifice and I am not even worthy of healing from him amen but I'm counting on my sacrifice you may be sick but you you don't come demanding of God and thinking God has to do it but God will heal you if you surrender to your sacrifice who is Jesus Christ Isaiah 53 but he was wounded for our transgressions was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by his stripes we are healed you're healed if you believe the promised word of God you're delivered if you trust in God's word amen hallelujah oh praise God listen I'm talking up here but he is here thank you the spirit of almighty God is here the great physician is here and he is walking up and down these aisles amen I I can talk it but unless the spirit can testify to you you know it doesn't mean anything just another message another sermon but I believe it I know it I feel it and I'm not voicing terms like that just to be heard because he is actually here [Music] Hallelujah oh my don't you know no sir Lord I know I ought to have even died long long ago amen I ought never to have been born amen that applies to every one of us here you should have been dead long ago uh I think it's last Wednesday I preached my brother Brandon was talking about all of those gifts the gift of eternal life is the gift and he says he protected that gift in those individual elect seed he protected it amen until to the time when the seed wakes up to who it really is and why it is here amen you are protected I know of incidents when I was a boy when I should have died I should have drowned you know uh jumping off trees into a river with rocks and under who knows I could have just plunged in and split my skull and I could have died many of you sitting here car accidents just simple things we could have gone Prophet said I ought to have died I ought not to even have even been born but you see God had it and planted that way that you ought to be here because you have to manifest his thoughts you have to manifest his word you have to let the people see what love is by somebody living love and acting It Out by Temperance patience godliness all these things have to be personified personalized manifested and that's God's thoughts expressing itself through you and I in Simplicity Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah see I should have died but behold I live praise God behold you live we live in Christ forevermore why not only that we live we don't live just naturally but we got eternal life we are going to heaven why because of what we've done it's because of what he done for us he was the one that took our place praise God hallelujah let's give the Lord a hand he was the one that took her place we were just not need crossed I in every kind of condition messed up amen but he took my place praise God spiritual speaking we were all twisted up messed up but he took our place he met and now by that he makes me and you perfect sons and perfect Daughters of the Living God hallelujah amen you're perfect did you hear what I just said you're perfect you're perfect oh but brother Simon I know I make mistakes I know I think this I knew I knew that this has happened and this has happened but God is saying regardless of your flesh your human thoughts doing all these things if you keep your being centered on him praise God Anchored In Jesus you will every storm ever wave you'll be able to make it true why because my friends he is the one that says you are a perfect son and a perfect daughter why because Perfection dwells within yes yes it's not you trying to keep these Seven Virtues the Seven Virtues are in Christ and Christ is in me and he is the Perfection of all Perfections and I'm living by him what you're seeing is the outside man and me that may make a flaw here do this or this say this wrong emotionally wrong in this area that area but my brother's sister if you can look beyond that you will see Jesus amen amen oh my his sacrifice did all that not mine I had nothing to do with it you have nothing to do with it amen can you say that salvation is of the Lord is that right salvation is of the Lord it's not how many candles you burn it's not how many stations of the cross you kneel and crawl on your knees it's not how many flagellations at Easter that you take the whips and whip your back is going to get you saved but Salvation is of the Lord is that right it comes from God and God alone has to do with it our act our actions and activities now our response or reactions to his action in gratitude to what he has done for us we show him our love that is within our heart amen so I do not trust in what I done but I am trusting in what he done amen I'm trusting on what he was and what he is praise the Lord that's what we're trusting in thanks be to God hallelujah amen thank God that we come here born under a Birthright now think of I want to take your thoughts too quickly to Abel born on the he was the first one that was born under that word right now remember the story of Cain and Abel and the sacrifices one of fruit and flowers one of uh the fruit of your lips and the works of your hands right uh he comes forth with that and Abel comes with a bloody bleeding dying lamb killed by a rock that he used as a knife to to there was no sharp knives in those days so it had to be a pointed Rocky found somewhere and ripped the throat of that animal and the Bloods praying everywhere the blood spraying upon Him amen becomes speckled with the blood amen of that Lamb Of course a type of shadow of the things that were to come but there he was doing it but you see one day the Holy Spirit spoke into my heart and said uh you know just quietly how did their Bell know that he had to offer a lamb you saying that now but there was no books written there was nothing written anywhere how could he know for certain uh why didn't he go and get a horse why didn't he go get a goat why didn't he go get something else but he knew by faith Paul tells us by Revelation Paul tells us he knew what to offer to God and God testified back that he was right amen he had the testimony that he pleased God hallelujah so this is why by Revelation by faith evil knew that he had to put his faith on that lamb sacrifice Hallelujah and that is what this message of the prophet of Malachi 4 5 has brought us back to it does not deny or move off from the written word but the written word itself came out of the unwritten word this is just a record of meaning and of thoughts if I have thoughts they're invisible you don't know them you do then if I take a pen I write it down but then after a while so many centuries you take in that is the original Jesus himself the person is the word and he is the one who's saying believe me the word Abel saw that from the beginning and he believed the word without the written word he believed the logos without the Rima amen the Rhema is the part of this word you can see but the unwritten word the law goes lives within this Rhema so while I'm maybe speaking the Rhema the logos is expressing itself making himself manifest the Living God hallelujah praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen so we find out that he was born under that word right so God had to come and reveal to him what it was that he needed to have hallelujah praise God and I'm glad that we could be here in our day not to have a church but is that right but to have the original spoken word birth out of the word of God hallelujah amen that's what Jesus demonstrated it that we should have come by the spoken word that's why the angel just like brother Branham stood before this bride of this last day and said You shall bear a son his name Shall be Called Jesus amen but now this is the bright part there is going to be a bride Hallelujah and she will be Mrs Jesus Christ Hallelujah because the word is revealed to her in her and through her the manifestation of God's word made manifested glory be to God hallelujah amen hallelujah oh praise God I want you to see my friends Abraham also was under that word right he wasn't better than anybody who's cursing swearing Idol worshiping and making offerings all kind of false pagan gods and everything else but all of a sudden no written bible amen I I I I looked Dr crudence and a few others but I'm just talking here I don't have to go quoting here there there this one said there's a praise God but the fact is that this Covenant amen that was given uh by God unconditional God didn't call him because he was good God didn't call him because he was better God didn't call me because he was taller he shorter he's black he's white his brownies yellow God wasn't concerned with stuff like that God knows whom he loves and who he hates and Jacob he loved and so God loved in that whole generation God loved on Abraham and God came to Abraham and God he just heard a voice one day saying Abraham Abraham Abraham and he turned right around you know the rest of the story he believed God imagine that you you talk about faith you just believe a voice speaking out a thin air and pack up your goods and forget your father and mother go into follow me into a far country oh my we gotta further country we want to follow him into now but the fact is we that man came out and went to Canaan because he had a right so that worked right and he was born under the sign of that word right hallelujah praise the name of the Lord they tried to make it kind of zodiac signs and you were under this sign and people are running to the marketplace they get the newspaper or or where they can see their horror Scopes uh what their lives are going to be but praise God we were born under a sign and if I want to give them a sign that we were born under we were born under the sign of the Lion of the tribe of Judah amen praise God born under that praise God and we we're going back to what Abel had we're going back or we are back now to what Abraham had but it's strange to the people oh they'll say brother Branham didn't say that brother Branham didn't say this but brother Branham did say it but he might not have said in those kinds of words it's just like people say oh you should only say what brother Branham said that's just like if you sent me with a message for brother coffee in the back there and you say tell him I am coming soon and I go back there and said uh so-and-so told me to tell you I am coming soon all right just go to brother coffee and say hey coffee he's coming soon the message didn't change the meaning didn't change the person is mature enough that they are not a little child that's going to be apparenting the word for word the a message that they were given but they understood the message so they're conveying to you the meaning of that message and letting you understand what God is saying in this dearness hour praise the Lord Jesus hallelujah thank God so undeserved what is Grace undeserved from my actions on my behavior I didn't deserve anything but God still gave us Grace Above All Else God gave us His Marvelous Grace what about Jeremiah before you were in your mother's womb I called you to be a prophet you weren't even born and you were already called you weren't even born you already ordained of course men are trying to ordain people with all kinds of church things now amen hallelujah praise God but you see we had the right to have the right birth because all of us were Original Seed we bypass the spoken word birth that should have been had amen and become by the natural birth of procreation rather than being a part of the new creation by the opening of the word of God Hallelujah didn't Paul say I was born out of Due Time amen hallelujah praise God Nicodemus asked what shall a man do to be born again and you understand no I'm not going to go off on all these tangents where Jesus said you must be born again you understand why you said that because the way you were born is not God's original intention God allowed it amen God endorsed it but that's not the way you're supposed to come you're supposed to come by the way of the word Jesus and Mary illustrates it to us when the angel Gabriel stood before Thou Art Mary and you will bear a son his name Shall be Called Jesus and what Mary believe the words of the Angel amen and Jesus later on was born in our day we have had an angel of God 17 child and he has spoken this word to us and that word seed has taken life in us and now we are bringing forth what the life of Jesus Christ Hallelujah being made manifest in the True Believer praise the Lord look I this is there's freedom in the church here praise the Lord are you believe that yes I have never tried to pass through a church and put a spirit of fear I don't want you to fear me as a pastor you have to have respects but not fair no sir you ought to have it if I am off the word if I'm wrong then you have a right to take this word not with the you know beer-facedness and disrespect but uh was a brother I don't see that you're off the word here or this is that the other and then we'll sit with a word and say no this is what really the word says so so so praise the Lord I'm not asking you not to challenge me but uh but I'm yeah I understand but at least I'm letting you know that God has set us free by his word but freedom is not folly and Liberty is not lawlessness is that right God has given us all these things and we don't want to go off into messes and everything else he says you can take this very word and study it to death is that right you're going to study it until you get all twisted up praise the Lord and you go to seed Amen to spiritual death in other words amen praise God I'm so thankful to God for that amen that we were actually we were actually um as Jesus is saying You must be born again Hallelujah and he said must I go back in my mother's womb because that's the thinking of a human amen but Jesus continues to let him know he said listen uh you can't go back to Heaven unless you first came down from heaven John chapter 3 verse 30. uh amen you see you can't go into heaven unless you first came down from heaven and we can't go back to heaven or we can because we were sent down from heaven and because you were sent down you're going back up where you come from you get it oh little Jew drops Hallelujah when the sun shines the stew drops must go back where they come from praise God you come from God and you're going back to God hallelujah it's it's like that no noise no noise but yet those two drops are going right back taking gallons of water back where the man made pumps of Pentecostal nonsense and all kinds of denominational dancers keep all the noise and running up there and they sound so powerful because they're pumping water they're pumping water and the sun just comes out and starts to shine and that water goes back up more than those pumps can even dream to think of that's what's happening right now we're going back where we come from because we feel the pull we heard a voice amen praise God hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen glory to God Amen yes anyone knows that the real seal of God is your Birthright the Seal of God is the birthright do you believe that the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen that your Birthright for Ephesians 4 30 says grief not the holy spirit of God whereby you were sealed till the day of your Redemption when they were born again they were filled with the Holy Ghost for the Holy Ghost is the new birth did you hear that the Holy Ghost is the new birth now he's not going to break up and explain all that to you because with the Holy Ghost in you now you can see the word spirit with spirit will meet and the word will attract the word deep will call to the deep and one will pull to the other so with the spirit of almighty God within your life praise God hallelujah you shall you first of all you've got to see the kingdom amen and only when you see the kingdom do you know to walk in the doorway then you can enter it praise God except a man be born again he cannot see Jesus said the first time second time when he spoke to him he said accept the man be born again he cannot enter he can't get in the Kingdom because first of all he has to have this birth right amen hallelujah oh praise God you see you you are begotten of the Holy Spirit I'll admit that but not yet born what's he talking about it's a message I preached many years ago be gotten and yet not born oh upheaval noise even Brothers in a message oh you said where you get that from what are you talking about hallelujah what the prophet is talking about you may be in the birth canal but you're not born yet and that's where Pentecost is there in the birth canal but they never came to have the breath of fresh air they haven't come to get this revelation of the word that will give them fresh air and give them life eternal praise God you see what I'm talking about there's a baby begotten when it's in the mother's womb it's only begotten now this is not some Republican and Democratic argument here this is Biblical word I'm speaking here today Hallelujah see it's got now see the little cell in that body aimpan and I just put here like a Pentecostal uh it's twisting around it's kicking it's jumping everywhere like that Hallelujah you see but when it's born Hallelujah at that point it says here brother Branham claps his hands like a doctor imitating a spank amen and I believe a lot of Christians Believers need to have a good gospel spank uh Hallelujah and nobody likes it when they get a gospel spank hallelujah praise God because it's painful at that point but you need to spank praise God he says now and then when he spanks then he squeals out and then becomes a living soul living soul is not talking about that one here but a living person becomes a person hallelujah praise God it's begotten but it's not a person until it comes out to life amen and a baby now when it's a baby it can go to church now his change is thought but listen carefully what he's saying here without saying it right out them babies go to church now and begin to say oh I believe in church I believe in God I work for the church I'll go out I'll I'll do this I'll do that oh I'm good am I not like little children ask their mother or their dad I'm good I'm good didn't I do this good didn't I do that she said little baby they go to church like that and saying I'm good I want to do right I want to do right I want to do that I want to do this and whatever else see but what it really needs is a gospel spanking to wake it up so that it can squeal itself into eternal life and when the Holy Spirit begins to scream in you praise God thank God believe the Holy Spirit screams in me I don't know about when I get excited I forget myself I forget age I forget time I forget place and everything else and I stay in the word of God hallelujah praise God I was in England I was preaching a word like this the spirit of God was moving and wonderfully well and there was a you know really high class English man a real gentleman pulling out just beautiful uh you know gold pocket watch and constantly looking at the time and looking at me and foreign but I was in the spirit I was under the influence of the word and you know under the spirit of living God I just said sir just put that thing away we are we're not living here in time we are here in as Eternal Children of the Living God in his divine presence amen so please put that away or all your peace until I'm finished and you can tell me whatever you wish to tell me praise God hallelujah I said a few other things you know praise the Lord but you know you're young you're under the spirit of God and that's how it was but anyway praise the Lord you see then the spirit in you screams out like that and it will do that like it never screamed before because then it is now a new creature in Christ Hallelujah praise God Hallelujah ah I'll go back some of my old stuff then Sister Louise you forget those Queen Elizabeth waves is that right praise the Lord none of this praise God hallelujah no no no you must be very demure you must be very cultured oh Hallelujah Jesus we love you Lord you know that's the kind of uh thing that they want but the spirit of God is like that praise God hallelujah praise the Lord wonderful amen then it's a new creature then it's born of the spirit then after that it begins to grow and it begins to move it begins to have its being in God just as a baby then praise the Lord if this Earthly Tabernacle that it lives in is dissolved we have one waiting hallelujah oh my first God hallelujah just as sure as the natural body was coming forth there is a spiritual body to receive that natural body when it drops from his mother oh my because now we know it drops from the mother and when this one drops from the mother earth amen which is in that womb of that now groaning here crying here oh God the prophet says groaning here laboring here in this one getting old in this one oh my starting to have sicknesses in this one everything starts to be setted but that Spirit on the inside of it is looking outside to a land beyond the river hallelujah it's groaning for that amen where it will live forever but now it's in a body of Earth a body that has got to die but sometimes just like when that Earthly mother dropped that natural baby and the spiritual body came and got it now this Earth will this natural body of the natural will drop and the fist the celestial body will be the one that will now come and grab that amen oh praise that's why Paul's an absent from the body we're present with the Lord praise be to God you're caught up by the Holy Spirit of the Living God Amen yes sir the spirit the celestial body will grab it for if this Earthly cabin not will be dissolved we have one waiting you have another body I said you have another body I said we have another body praise God this one is going to fall apart but we are going to one that can never die one there's no pain there is no egg there is no crying there is no sign there is no separation we're going to a new body praise God hallelujah amen we are with God's New Creation family amen praise God the old creation the people can die in that but this new creation my father worked hitherto in creating the old creation but now I work and doing the new creation this one here this creation of bride creation Now this one will never never die praise God hallelujah I'm glad that I'm born with this birthmark hallelujah hallelujah and I'm glad that I have I said Bert mark I didn't say bort right but we're born with abort Mark I see a lot of people putting on tattoos on them people loving to have marks these days but they have to have the right Mark and we got to have uh we know we got our Bart Mark it's not a natural one that you could see somewhere on my body that you you're going to try to pull off my jacket to see if I got it on my back or wherever I got it but I've got the word Mark hallelujah praise God and that I am one of them I am one of those people and I got the mark Hallelujah there are certain tribes in Africa India China wherever they have a certain mark on them they have they'll take a sharp knife and put a cut either on their cheek on their forehead somewhere or several marks but it marks them and another tribe will look at them they know what tribes they're from praise God but we got that invisible Mark we got God's word Mark in US you say brother Simon where you got that from whatsoever praise God I want you to know Paul said I am marked Paul said I know I got the Mark I praise God because I have to work right and I got the birthmark to prove I'm the King's son praise the Lord I'm not just coming with a a baseless claim but I got the mark and I have the right praise God hallelujah amen praise God for could you put up there uh Hebrews 11 praise the Lord if you can find it praise God Amen from the beginning of time I want to say we are of that number where we got the birthmark and we have the birthright that God has given to us in Hebrews 11 I I won't quote it the word for word here but he says all these were going all got this word Mark and write of Faith Revelation the the right to an ability to receive Revelation they're marked by that you're marked by that you don't effortlessly you don't have to think you don't have to wonder you don't have to do mathematics or science you just know how did you know that oh praise God I don't know it by human machinations or wisdom or anything of that nature but I know it because God has revealed it oh blessed be the name of the Living God hallelujah amen these all obtain the good report praise the Lord let me look I just I didn't think but I turned the Bible and here I am and let me just read a short brief part here praise God oh my they were stoned they were sauna Sunder they were tempted they were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goat skins that's the truth and Afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy wandering in deserts in mountains in dense in caves of the earth and all these all obtained a good report through faith through Revelation Hallelujah God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect Hallelujah we are the last that are going to go first is that right the last year but first and the first shall be last it's there in the world they have to wait on us they without us cannot be made perfect amen blessed be the name of our God and to glad you're a part of him and a part of his word hallelujah amen praise God and see because of that he said you begin to forget the things of the world it's no more trying to press yourself that you shouldn't forget this and forget that you start to get so Heavenly minded that you're not thinking of these Earthly things anymore and you let the Holy Spirit take over your life and manifest himself through you in every way praise the Lord let me close out with this thought and I'm closing here praise the Lord these all had that Mark now when Jesus came there was millions of people in Israel but why did he all of a sudden he sees Andrew and he calls him out because he's seen he has the birth mark and he has the right to have the right birth and he calls Andrew and he calls Peter and when Peter comes up he tells him who is his father's name and this and that and the other why he was telling him I knew you right to the others he said I never knew you but to Peter he was telling him in a nice way I know you from before the foundation of the world I know everything about you amen Peter and then he called he was demonstrating to every one of them Philip then he says Nathaniel before he even called you out of that fig tree I already know you I saw you and I know you I watch you coming down to all your Generations until you arrive in this age and then you come to a birth and everything else I knew you praise the Lord hallelujah praise God hallelujah something in him was reaching out to them and something in them was reaching back out to him because the Deep was calling to the Deep hallelujah praise God hallelujah so they because of that Gene or predestinated seed being in them they had the right to have the right birth and because of that blind bartimius was even one of that number and that's why we who were blinded on the denominational systems and streams of thought today my friends he has to pass our way because if the sea the gene of God dwells in you he has to wake it up he has to pour upon it have a present water from the rock so that the seed can germinate and come to life Lord and God let me close now because you know the spirit of God comes on you like this you want to keep going on and you're in the congregation I'm in the preacher up here and preachers known to be very uh you know praise God they are long-winded praise the Lord Don't Be Afraid brother Christopher praise the Lord praise the Lord so here God bless you all today simply and humbly I hope somewhere you can recognize that from the time you were young you are marked you were marked by people and by the public by your schoolmates by your friends and you never knew why but God gave you an invisible birthmark that you are one of them and I'm glad to say as musicians come I'm in that number oh praise God I'm in that
