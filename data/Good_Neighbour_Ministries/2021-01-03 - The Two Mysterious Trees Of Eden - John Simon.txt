chosen ones from before the foundation of the world may the lord bless us as we come together in his name my scripture for today is found in the book of genesis chapter 2. reading from verses 8 and 9. and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground made the lord to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food and the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil praise be to god gracious heavenly father we have just read from your holy word and now we ask for divine help may the great holy spirit who the scriptures tell us when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide us into all truth and show us things to come may he guide us today as we surrender ourselves to him for service for your glory for your honor and praise may your name be lifted up may your person be glorified may you be worshipped and honored father for worthy is the lamb that was slain and has redeemed us by his blood to god in jesus name amen and amen praise the lord my topic for today from the scripture i've just read is the two mysterious trees in of eden the two mysterious trees of eden now we know uh satan is very deceptive misleading very deceitful for he has spawned lies and myths about these trees and the these two trees have remained as a mystery in the minds of men wondering what are they the song he has spread the myth and the lie that the trees one was an apple tree and eve somehow at the apple off of that tree and uh realized that she was naked and also became pregnant and bore a son all because of eating an apple from off of this tree he further spread his myth and said well maybe it may not have been an apple tree it might have been a pear tree and then we have that lie uh being spread that it was a a pear tree but on the whole what he is doing there is taking the minds of man out of the s supernatural realm or spiritual realm and placing their minds along the lines of natural things so when they read in the bible that god placed these trees in the garden to be beautiful for sight and that they would be good for food but if you will notice in the scripture there is a semicolon which means that these two trees that god spoke of last of all were different from the other trees or from the rest of the trees oh may we pay attention to the word of god today listen we realize in the bible according to psalms chapter psalms 1 the entire chapter which starts blessed is the man amen that continues on he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of waters his roots also shall not wither or praise be to god i'm just using that scripture you can read the entire chapter for yourself but it is pointing to the fact that trees are representative of persons trees are representative of people you may read other scriptures other types in the various books of the bible trees of the wood and god speaking about the bramble and speaking about the vine and different scriptures and illusions speaking to this fact that trees represent persons and we find also john the baptist understood clearly the meaning of these trees and of trees in particular and said the axe is laid to the roots amen you see he was not talking about natural trees he was talking about spiritual trees and spiritual principles and the acts of god's word was laid against the roots of evil and there it was he was referring again to trees and these trees in his mind he would recognize them as he spoke to the scribes and pharisees alluded also to persons now these uh representative trees of which i'm speaking the tree of life and the tree of knowledge or of wisdom of good and evil now jesus christ i believe and teach that he is the tree of life satan i believe is the tree of knowledge he's a hybrid tree a mixed tree oh we will speak about this a bit later how there is what good and evil in that tree you're lured in by the good in the tree but the evil is wrapped in the good so that when it is eaten absorbed or taken in to the heart and to the mind one is deceived one is led astray by the perverted to bear nothing but the perverted fruit of the tree from which one has eaten may god help us to eat from the tree of life the word of god and receive true life eternal life and our lives shall not wither for we were planted by the ever-present waters in the rock now of course we know that every seed shall bring forth after its kind and that every tree bears fruit some kind of fruit amen and we find that jesus being the tree of life with him in us we bear the fruits of that tree oh praise god hallelujah they the the fruits of the spirit the nine gifts of the holy spirit flowing through our lives and blessing and anointing us as we go forth in his name and with the word of god hallelujah amen satan the fruits of death we read it in our bible that from the time he partook of the tree of knowledge of good and evil it produced nothing but sin suffering and death time began age began pain began labor began sweating began all these various curses and troubles and trials began to go along with man's existence because of disobedience to god's word from here in eden we see the great battle of wisdom versus faith we see the fruit of these two trees manifested and how they would be manifested through the representations of cain and abel these two boys coming from those two fruit trees those two trees one from satan the tree of knowledge of good and evil cain and from jesus christ a bell with light revelation and life praise be to god and that model that representation has stood the test of time until we return back to the eternities for right now we see the same spirits the same life and the same representation coming face to face again here in our day and in our time glory be to god now with these foundational backgrounds let us see what is happening today in our day and and in the time in which we live now my introduction here there's a lot in it that one can take and search the scriptures and follow it and it will build your faith and you will recognize where i took a lot of this from and where i've received it from and you will see that it is grounded in the word of god and in the revelation of this hour by the great holy spirit amen praise god hallelujah now listen when he came to the hebrew bride she was the mother of all living amen you see eve was the mother of all natural life all natural living adam was not the father of all living but eve was the mother of all natural living amen but now when the holy spirit came to his hebrew bride on the day of pentecost the uh and poured out of his great holy spirit she was the mother of all living but after process of time the hebrew bride rejected the word of god amen justice eve first received this word and then later rejected it under the deceit of reasoning by satan so the first eve or the natural eve fell by listening to satan's reasoning satan's reasoning what is that satan's collection and accumulation of all human wisdom for thousands of years all accumulated together makes up the wisdom of this world along with the wisdom of this ancient evil wicked and virulent spirits called satan lucifer came down upon the earth and began to uh infuse and insert his knowledge within this knowledge that was there perverting the wisdom of god the word of god and creating a perversion and a copy of god's plan and purpose she listened to satan's reasoning against the revelation that was being revealed to her she tried to reason the revelation and he got her to start reasoning against the revelation that was revealed to her amen now when eve was in the garden with adam we understand that it was god himself that spoke to them and told them of the trees of the garden you shall eat from the rest of them but of this tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat lest you die so it was god himself that brought that to her don't touch the tree amen that was his spoken word that was god's words spoken directly to them now after that time of course we know that came through the prophets also don't touch sin don't touch evil don't touch these dead things all the type of not touching what god was thoroughly against and then it finally came to jesus and he had the same message that we are not to touch sin we are not the touch evil we are not to touch any of these things of the world but it was god who spoke the word directly to them and they turn god's word down by listening to the serpent here it comes in our day god has sent a prophet and god speaking through the prophet for the spirit speaks through the prophet and the people have taken their own wisdom to resist or to speak against the word of god from the mouth of god's prophet for this hour putting their own human wisdom and accumulation of knowledge bringing it against the word of god for the day oh my think of it put in your reasoning against the revelation of the hour how did the first eve fall she failed by listening to reasoning against the word of god that's exactly how she fell she did not listen to the word now the church christ bright she fell not back there in eden that was the natural leave but spiritual eve fell not in eden but she fell at rome she fell by roman reasoning contrary to the word of god and perverting the word and promises of god in this bible as was revealed to her you see eve the spiritual leave now was presented with the same choices and the same conditions as the first eve was in the garden of eden there she was tempted by the serpent satan in the serpent now the second eve is presented with a choice to follow believe and believe god's revealed word to her or the natural reasoning of the serpent through an instrument of this time that he is using for his own purposes and for his own plans yes reaching out and accepting that reasoning and what happened to the spiritual church she fell at the council of nicaea there she fell when she rejected the pentecostal church in its way and went down to nicaea began listening to roman reasoning instead of holding to the word of god and to god's unchanging hand yes sir she fell and everything went away from her and began to die from around her and my friends just asked the natural he fell spiritual eve also fell away by the reasoning of satan god's bride fell in the garden christ's bride fell in nicaea at rome from roman reasoning reasoning against the word of god amen hallelujah now we're going to uh read from our we want to uh comment from the god of this evil age whom we know satan is the god of this evil age and it's been prophesied that as the first eve had to be tried and tested as to her faithfulness to the word of god for that hour so is this eve in our day and in our time to be tested tried and proven by the satan using and perverting the very message the very scriptures the word of god for this day and for this hour but you see and he did it face to face and when he did it evil was just in its infancy but now we are here we're passing through the seventh church age evil has gone through its cycles and now it's come to a place of its maturity and that evil one must come against this last day bride so that she might be tested by the same standards as the first eve as the hebrew uh church and this is the hour that is upon us now our trials have begun our testings have begun our sifting time has begun yes sir the time when god is choosing his own and they are being tested in every possible way amen yes back then there stood the tree of life there stood the tree of knowledge and she had to make a choice of the tree amen hallelujah yes sir that tree of knowledge of course satan got into the serpent and perverted her thoughts unfortunately her mind and just as much as she had to make a choice every age has to make a choice every church has to make a choice every believer has to make a choice quo vadis with a guest now what shall i do what should you do what decision shall i make whether should you turn to knowledge or to faith to wisdom or to revelation where shall you go may the great holy spirit of god call to call out to your spirit and may you recognize him as he calls out to his own for my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they shall not oh they will not follow a stranger but they'll stay with the word of god amen so eve had a choice and through the tree of knowledge through him the tree of knowledge through him satan possessing and using a serpent deceived eve as to the meaning and of obedience to the word of god for that hour and she turned away from the tree of life and went to eat from the tree of knowledge and wisdom amen all of this happened when it was natural back there but what is happening what is for it for our day amen my friends these two trees are so real and and look so similar that if you don't know what you're doing it's so they're so it's not near the truth it's so near to the revelation of the owl and which a carnal mind and senses but one of these persons that can manipulate the word and speak the word and use it marvelously one can hardly detect the difference between a human ability and the re revelation of the word of god for this hour oh blessed be his holy name knowledge and the tree of life oh praise god amen almost identical amen and you can't detect them with just your natural senses by just looking at them but it will take a revelation a discerning of the lord's body of truth in this day and in this hour by hebrews 4 12 for the word of god the word of god revealed to you makes you and makes it quick and sharp as a two-edged sword within you and makes itself manifest and revealed hallelujah glory be to god now listen god of this evil age we find now this evil age is to prove to satan that she the bride of this hour is not like eve hallelujah first of all she is going to be proven just as the others were proven she's going to be tested just like the other eve was tested she's going to be presented with both things knowledge and life truth amen she will be presented with both of them the tree of knowledge sounds so innocent because it's good to know and it sounds so innocent and so real hallelujah and those persons oh my will even quote the bible to you just like satan did in the garden of heaven well listen he knew the quotes he knew the scriptures he knew the bible that is why he could say did not god say such and such and such and such and he was able to accurately quote god's word and then he knew it so well that he knew exactly where just to drop one word in one word to taught to pervert to twist to undermine and subvert the kingdom of the most high god amen yes sir they're going to cut that bible they're even going to quote the message given to us in this hour they're going to hang on to the bible and they're going to hang on to the words the quotes the written quotes of the day and for this hour hallelujah amen and that but there in our day there stood a man named william marion branham with that tree of life jesus christ in him speaking through him and using him while he had the word of life in him that i do not even have to prove his ministry his life his pronouncements his prophecies all prove that conclusively that whatever he produced and said was thus saith the lord now the tree of life was in our deer precious brother i believe that tree of life has borne fruits and it's in the true believers of this day in this hour growing up in them trees of righteousness by the rivers of living water whose leaves shall not wither eternal life or praise god they'll bear fruit in their correct age and season and time o blessed be the name of the living god and god working and moving through them making them a blessing hallelujah amen praise god but there stood brother branham tree of life in him jesus christ and there stood a person amen for man is an animal and there stood this person or many persons that would face that prophet 440 of them or so in 400 of them or so in chicago persons coming against the tree of life the word of god encased in a man god using him for his glory amen my god friends you understand what it is the same evil devils that were back there now in in the persons in an in in an animal the formation of the beasts beginning and using their wisdom and their knowledge to come against the word of god and which are naturalized when you look it is a person it is a human being standing there talking to you looks like a real person talking like a real person and speaking to the bride of this hour today once again oh my and that animal is quoting from the bible quoting from the message looking you in the eyes and quoting the very message of this hour and saying did not god say so-and-so did not the prophet of god said this and that and that and my friends i tell you that's the way it is as he begins to use the bible the quotes of this message and when you will say to them a truth of god they'll turn around and say but but my bible doesn't say that you say but the prophet said i don't care what the prophet says amen it's what the bible says that cults my because what the prophet said came from the bible so therefore it's the bible that counts and that's what i'm going to alto is what i see in this bible oh my my friends such people such persons these animals of our day these seeds of the serpent generations of the beast that was in eden will now tell you in their own words the bible you think you know the scriptures for in them you'll take you find and have eternal life but you know not the scriptures not a power of god you know not the scriptures nor the revelation of the word of god in this day presence change of this ministry the present hour of the unfolding mystery of the word of god for his children and for his people amen hallelujah amen my friends in the bible i'll show you where this spirit came from there was a man called thomas and he was just as much a follower of jesus as all the rest but when they told him that the word was no more in the ground it was no more in the grave the word was no more buried no sir there was no body for you to go and see anymore you couldn't look at the written word laying there and identified that yes he's in the grave no he was risen and alive this disciples would not believe it at the time oh he would not receive that truth listen he said these immortal words that are within the golden pages of the scriptures except i see except i see the the wounds in his hands and the piercing in his side and accept my friends i put my hand into his side i will not believe we have that same spirit here today may god help you my friends even if you're like that there is still an opportunity for you that the holy spirit later on really opened the eyes of thomas and as you know thomas died as the apostle to india there he died on their various spears and was killed and his tomb is somewhere in india to this very day amen here stands a man he exactly will tell you all i believe brother branham was a prophet and that he is a prophet amen and he'll even caught from brother branham as a prophet amen and god might be even using that man in a marvelous and wonderful way where gifts and powers of god is flowing through his life in a marvelous way oh my but he'll still stand and say now the prophet said stay with the word stay with the word and so brother uh simon whatever you are saying uh i don't know uh what that is i don't know where that's coming from but i'm gonna stay with the world i'm just going to do that not turning to the left not to the right but regardless of what anybody says i'm going to stay with the word i'm gonna stay with what the prophet has said yes is in the scriptures yes you'll do that while you're a child you'll speak like a child you'll repeat what you hear your parents say like a child why because you're learning to speak this new language you're learning to get into that uh language you're learning to get within that race that super race the supernatural race hallelujah and so you at the first part when you are in your spiritual infancy then you will that the mamma dada you will do that hallelujah but after a while you continue to say exactly what he said or your parents said but you are now speaking it in your own words because you have now uh inculcated and matured into the rightness of the fruits of the word and the fruits of the word come forth with the power of the holy spirit for christ in you interpreting his own word and his own promises for this day and for this hour blessed be his holy name amen while you're a child you'll speak as a child but when you become mature a man or a woman yes you put away chinese things you'll put away all of that because you really understand what it means to stay with the word not just with the written word but the intent the motive the the meaning they the understanding the reading between the lines the revelation of the hour with which god anoints his people and uses them for his glory and for his honor listen i honestly believe that we were not called to be message parents because all the parent does to be safe is just to repeat whatever uh it was told uh polly pick a pepper polly pick the pepper polly pick the pepper whatever was told the pirate just parrots it oh you know the prophet said this and the prophet said that the prophet said and it's true nothing is wrong with it but who do you say i am who do you say i am what is your revelation that it will won't be different it'll be the same thing but who do you say i the son of man i am my goodness praise god hallelujah oh glory to his marvelous and wonderful name i want to thank god many have misunderstood and believe we are building a wall we are not here to build a wall because all you'll have to do is keep going straight and stay with that word and going one direction but we are not here he said to build a wall we are building a building and if you're building a building the building has corners the building has dispensations ages places where one has to change and turn to go on doing and accomplishing the right things for the living god all my friends i'm not even into this fullness of this sermon but i just want you to see here in this day in this hour that we are living in what god is doing oh yes you say oh uh brother oh what a blessing i was blessed this morning when the holy spirit showed me this or showed me that well my bible doesn't say that where did the prophet say that where did he say that could you show me the quote give me the page chapter verse year month tell me what meeting when did he say that oh my the devil's ears just listening that he might be able to let you listen to jesus to catch a hold of his words like that and to twist it in every possible way how deceptive how deceptive working true cain spirit of cain oh my the gang saying of cain come against the very word of the living god and yet one has to turn around and abel oh okay my brother and all the gifts and the fruits and the stature of a perfect man flowing out of him while he greets his brother not with a mockery not with hashem not written with acting but with real genuine love and grace of god knowing that their book came from the same womb but from different fathers one of god and one of the devil they're in the same church putting the same bible cutting the same coats one of god and one of the devil recognize that and still like god are able to be impartial pure love and purity of the grace of the living god oh my think of it oh my god it's very deceptive if this great holy spirit had not come down and revealed himself to me as to others then you will not be able to discern that how sin it is narrow a razor blade my brother sister can hardly pass between the the true and the false the deception of the hour and the unfailing reality of the of the revealed word of god for this day and for this time o blessed be his holy name o praise god if the holy spirit had not come and revealed or make known his word to my heart and as i've said to the heart of others who have caught this revelation which put them in another dimension yes sir we would fall for this great thing we would fall for this great thing we are seeing over here we'll fall for the ministry of this animated person animated yes this animal beast possessed and used by satan to be his mouthpiece his voice spouting the scriptures the mystery the revelation they think is the genuine one but they're spouting it from the quotations from the from the quotations of scripture and of the prophet and yet i will speak personally in the casting out the devils which god has used me discernment of spirits in which god has used me i've talked with the devil face to face and many a brother sisters who claim to be followers of this message but anointed by the evil one yes this great thing is happening now great hour of deception shall not be dark nor light but at evening time it shall be light again oh thank god light has come from heaven light has made itself known and i can stand here as a witness to say the truth because there before you you have your choice to eat from the tree of life the rough you revelation of the word of god or the sweet succulent fruit of some coming out of the mouth voice of a mighty bible teacher great church or a great movement which makes you feel secure because you're surrounded by that but my friends as i begin to wind this down right now i want to urge you turn your eyes upon jesus look full in his wonderful face and the things of this earth will grow strangely them in the light of his glory and grace come back to the tree of life feed from the tree of life and receive life and bear the twelve fruits of revelation 22 and receive in your life the healing of all the nations and plant yourself by the rivers of living water oh glory to god may the holy spirit bless you today my brothers my sisters and go with you and bring you again our next coming together will be wednesday when we will be teaching on the church ages then next sunday we will be back into the word of god talking about these two mysterious trees that were back in the garden of eden and are now here with us today may god richly bless you as we come together again in his marvelous and wonderful name god bless you real good [Music] you
