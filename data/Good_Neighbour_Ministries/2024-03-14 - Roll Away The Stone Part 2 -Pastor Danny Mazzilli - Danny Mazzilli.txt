forever more so tonight we're just going to continue along um where we started on Sunday that was just uh sort of laying in a foundation and um we were looking at uh at rolling away the stone and um how the resurrection is a key element for us to recognize you know we were looking at recognizing our role in the plan of God's redemption in this hour amen calling the Sons and Daughters of God to the message of the hour to the revelation of what God is doing in our day amen praise God but you know um as human beings we run into all kinds of situations and our faith gets tested and we looked at Martha we looked at Mary we saw the differences we saw how um you know Martha was kind of a representation of of works and the law and then how Mary was a representation of Grace amen knowing that uh the the master had called amen and that um you know there's nothing greater for us to recognize in this day and in this hour that the master has called us it's it's it's it's a miracle Saints it's a paradox when you think about it because you know Christianity is not something it's it's uh you know it started when Christ rose from the dead 2,000 years ago amen and um and we've got thousands and thousands probably hundreds of thousands of churches worldwide that are that are worshiping Jesus Christ Christ but yet there's there there must be an understanding that that God is an absolute and that God cannot be the author of confusion that um he's in the present stage of his ministry and it's important for us to recognize his present stage and what he's doing in this hour okay we're not saying we're better than anybody we're not making any kind of claims we're only claiming the word of God and what the word of God says says amen and so I believe that um you know as we look at um at the word tonight we're going to look and see how you know um rolling away the stone is not just rolling away the stone that Jesus came and spoke and told them to roll away the stone there back then 2,000 years ago but there's stones that need to be rolled away today amen and that's what we're going to be looking at tonight some of the things that God is going to be um showing us in the word of God tonight let's um let's read our scripture before we do that we'll we'll pray father what an honor and what a privilege once again to be here in your presence Lord tonight is Wednesday night bible study so we we get to search the scriptures in a way Lord and your spirit just comes um in the way that you would have the preeminence to speak to the needs to the hearts of your children here that are gathered in this place and Lord that are gathered in in um YouTube and listening in live as we Minister your word father you there's no distance in um in your spirit so I know that you can speak to every single individual Lord that has um uh chosen to be here tonight Grant it father take control and just bless us tonight Lord we need you more than ever father I'm just a human being we're all just human beings that are that are saved by grace and Lord we're just asking for your your mercy to come and and uh humble us with your presence oh God we pray in Jesus name amen praise God St John 11: 39-41 Jesus say take ye away the stone Martha the sister of him that was dead saith unto him Lord by this time he stinketh for he had been dead for days Jesus saith unto her said I not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou should see the glory of God then they took away the Stone from the place where the dead was laid praise God you may be seated amen glory to God let's read the next scripture um 1 Thessalonians CH 4:1 16 says for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with these words amen praise praise God you know that's a wonderful scripture but I want I I want you to recognize and draw your attention to that scripture here tonight that we just read in that it types us today we are on our walk to the resurrection we're walking with God the Bible says for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout you know the Lord descended 2,000 years ago amen and he came with a message praise God and he was the voice of God in that particular day he was God's voice in Jesus Christ representing the word made flesh coming to those that were that were waiting on him but yet only a dozen actually really recognized who had actually been in the midst that it was Jehovah God himself the word being made flesh amen and then we which are alive and here we are today and there were then you know it was Mary it was Martha it was Lazarus it was the disciples back then they were alive and they recognized that Jesus Christ had come on the scene that here he was amen listen to The Prophet the first thing comes when he starts descending from from the heaven there's a shout what is it it's a message now we know that God sent us a prophet in this day and in this hour and he had a message that would turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers what is that it turned us back to the word it turned us back to where we would read the word recognize the word receive the word allow it to possess us take control of us and then manifest through Us in this day and in this hour amen what was it it is a message to get the people together praise God Amen a message comes forth first now lamp trimming time rise and trim your lamps what watch what what's that the seventh not the sixth the seventh behold the bridegroom cometh rise and trim your lamps and they did some of them found they didn't even have any oil in their lamp see but it's lamp trimming time and so we received a message in our day that has turned us back to the word of God that's the difference between all the other churches that are that are out there claiming Christianity and the True Church of God Amen that they've recognized what God is doing in their day and that God said that he was going to send a prophet in the Fulfillment of Malachi 4:5 in the Fulfillment of of Revelations 10 1-7 to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the original fathers back to the word of God now listen he goes on brother Brandon and this is from the Rapture message the second is a voice of the Resurrection the same voice that a loud voice in St John 11 38-44 that called Lazarus from the grave amen and this is what we were talking about on Sunday that unless you come to recognize the resurrection that the voice of the Resurrection is now present you will stay in your unbelief you'll stay in that cave and the stone will stay rolled in front of your grave because the denominations out there and all the teachings of man the teachings of man is not what gives you Faith it's not the doctrines of man that's going to give you rapturing faith in order to fulfill that that we shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord you're going to need a supernatural faith in order to fulfill that scripture amen and so you need to come out of the graves you need to be woken out of out of your your your sins we're going to look more into this here so he says here that called Lazarus from the from the grave getting the bride together and then the resurrection of the Dead see to be caught up with it now watch the three things takes place the next is what was a trumpet a voice a shout a voice a trumpet now the third thing is a trumpet which always at the Feast of trumpets is calling the people to the feast that'll be the bride supper the Lamb's supper with the bride in the sky Hallelujah see the first thing comes forth is his message calling the bride together the next thing is a resurrection okay so you you heard the word you know hey don't you know that God sent a prophet oh no I I didn't know that God sent a prophet well you need to look into it you need to look into why God sends his prophets God does nothing less he reveals it first unto his servants the prophets that's what makes God the same yesterday today and forever he will never change and so oh so God sent a prophet yes you need to look into the word of God you need to look into see what he said we know what Luther said when he went to the Catholic church and he says hey wait a minute here I don't need to be going to an intercessor I don't need a man interceding for me or or Mary interceding for me I need my own Revelation and experience and relationship with Jesus Christ that's what Luther recognized and so Luther broke away from the church and it started the Reformation everybody knows about the Reformation you can talk to anybody uh any of the Christian churches they all know about it well the Reformation has to continue to the point where the Rapture is fulfilled and now you know there's a progression in the word of God that we need to recognize and in order for us to get to the destination we need to know where we're at praise God Amen and so the church he's saying here now um it's it's so the next thing is a resurrection of the sleeping bride okay we which are alive and remain shall not hinder them that sleep those that received Jesus Christ in their age you can go back and look at the history okay you can start right 2,000 years ago and you'll see what took place through the Dark Ages the church the you know the the Roman Catholic Church took control of the word of God and there was millions of Christians that were slaughtered they were slaughtered because they wanted to have a personal relationship they had a personal relationship with God God was restoring his word and the only way he restores it is is he gets into individuals and when he gets into individuals their lives start to reflect Christ but when when any at any time when when the Life of Christ was being reflected in the people the enemy didn't like it Satan listen if you believe that there's a God then you need to understand that the scripture says very clearly that there's a devil he's our adversary he's the one that's going to try to stop us from believing the word of God Amen so we need to realize that we have to fight if we're going to Reign we need to overcome the enemy the bombardment of all the traditions of man and so we don't need any intercessor we need to have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ amen praise God so the next thing that's going to happen is the sleeping Saints are going to rise and then we are going to be caught up together with them for a meeting in the air which is called the Rapture and we'll meet with the Lord and this world is going to go into Great Tribulation I'm just going to tell you what the scripture says you want to argue don't argue with me you're going to have to argue with the scripture amen praise God and the trumpet the feast in the heavens in the sky why that's the thing that takes place friends we're right there ready now the only thing the church coming out has got to lay before the sun to ripen right now this is what's taking place we're at the end time Jesus talked about the Harvest at the end time it's the ripening of the grain it's where the true Sons and Daughters of God will come under the leadership of the word for this day and for this hour and they will allow the Holy Spirit to do in them whatever is necessary to prepare them for the Rapture amen amen praise God you want to know more about the Rapture you can find out Lots about the Rapture just go and Google search or listen to YouTube and and pick up messages go back and listen to the message of William Mariam brandom on the Rapture you will learn a lot about what the Rapture represents and how it's going to be fulfilled in this day and in this hour amen praise God so we need to recognize you can put up the next slide we need to recognize that go to slide number six so it's recognizing and acting upon the resurrection that's taken place in our personal lives amen praise God I'm just going to read here from um uh uh go to the next slide St John chapter 14 14:12 it says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father now why do I read this scripture because we need to understand that the resurrection took place Jesus went back to his position as Supreme author Authority and now he has come down and broken himself up into individuals in this day and in this hour and these individuals represent the body of Jesus Christ praise God and you've been you've been given a portion of the word of God it's been placed in you as the attribute of God and and so how can you possibly do Greater Works than what Jesus did well the same way that if you go back back and study the works that were done through William Mariam Branham through the 1940s 50s and 60s you will see that there was so much Supernatural there was dead raised doctors affidavits FBI reports we're not talking about just hearsay sure you can search the scriptures and search uh or not search the scriptures but search the internet and find oh well they'll say well William brandham was was uh you know a you know they'll they of course when Jesus Christ was here on the earth they said be alub they called him the head of the Devils imagine the word was made flesh was doing Miracles right before all the Pharisees the Sadducees right there in front of their faces but yet they said be elub they called our Lord a devil so how much more now when he does these Works in our day that the people are going to try and place it and say that's the devil that's a cult that's something that you you got to stay away from no what I tell people is listen you need to search the scriptures you need to look for yourself into the word of God to see what the word says and then you make your own decision don't listen to to what other people's interpretation is because the enemy The Devil is still alive and well and he will do everything in his power to turn you and others against the word of God for this day and in this hour and so we need to recognize that there's only one way that we could possibly do Greater Works and that's if his Spirit dwells in you well how do I I get his Spirit you need to repent you need to be baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit which is Christ now it's not as simple as I just said it the statement is simple but in order for you to receive Christ you had to be with him before the foundations of the world you need to have had representation in you before you came here Jesus said all that the father hath look at the word hath it's past past tense your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundations of the world so in order for you to respond when your name is being called well how's my name being called when you can recognize the word that's being revealed in your day that's how you recognize that your name is being called people say well how come you believe this message because my name was called not Dan missil not not uh uh Michelle Brennan not Michael Peltier but because I had the ability to recognize wait a minute this makes sense let me check the scriptures baptism I see it as clear as a bell I don't I don't see any other mediator between man and God but Jesus Christ so if I got to take the Bible says right there clearly in word or deed do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so a deed is when you go to baptism and you're baptized and immersed fully in the water it's your your old life being completely buried so that you can receive a new life and all that does it doesn't save you but it shows that something took place within you and has led you to represent Christ now to the world in your personal life amen you know these are simple truths but unless these simple foundations are not in you there's no way that you can progress and move on to the Fulfillment of the Rapture of the church amen let's go to the next scripture First Corinthians now if if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the Dead you know there's there's there's people like there's people that just don't believe that Jesus Christ rose from the dead that's right you know but if there is no resurrection of the dead then is Christ not RIS risen in other words people are saying that you know Christ is not risen I want to read this from the Amplified version and it'll help you you know understand the point that I'm trying to bring out here because it's important for you know we know that the resurrection is a reality but there are people out there that that reality has not struck them yet they need to know that the reality of Jesus Christ and the power of his resurrection is what changes your life it's what opens your understanding it's what gives you the ability to recognize the word for your day but now if Christ the Messiah is preached as raised from the dead how is it that some of you say that there is no resurrection of the Dead question mark But if there is no resurrection of the dead then Christ has not risen then it's then we're sitting here in vain we haven't received a new birth we haven't we haven't received Christ amen and if Christ is not risen then our preaching is in vain it amounts to nothing and your faith is devoid of Truth and is fruitless without effect empty imaginary and unfounded this is what the enemy is trying to tell you trying to tell the people there is only one way that anybody will be saved and that is through Jesus Christ and through the power of his resurrection unless you accept Jesus Christ as your savior in the power of his resurrection there is no salvation period we are even discovered to be misrepresenting God for we testified of him that he raised Christ whom he did not raise in case if it is true that he that the dead are not raised they're arguing that that you know like that Christ is not raised this is from the book of Corinthians and there was there was a lot of dispute that was going on amongst them and there was those people the Sadducees that did not believe in the Resurrection the Pharisees believed in the resurrection but they couldn't recognize the word just like a lot of the Christian churches out here today they believe in the resurrection but then when the word is put right there in front of them in the present stage of his ministry Christ right now possessing the hearts and the lives of individuals and all that those individuals you me all we can ever do is go right back to the word we'll tell them well how are you baptized have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed oh well no I don't know if I receiv received the Holy Holy Ghost that's the that's the answer that I get from a lot of people I go you know I understand you believe Christ but have you received the Holy Ghost which is the resurrection of Jesus Christ in your life here we are coming into the Easter celebration and that's why the Lord led me to this you might think oh it's so simple we've heard this before no there's some that have never heard this before they've never caught the revelation of the Resurrection because if you catch the revelation of the Resurrection it'll draw you right to the message of this hour it'll allow you to see what Christ is doing it'll it'll it'll make you run from man's teachings man's doctrines man's interpretation on the word telling you that you need to say 10 hell Marys you need to do a 100 our fathers you need to you need to repent and and and and and and do Works in order to be saved there is no Works in salvation Salvation is by the grace of God Amen it only comes through God's grace it comes because God knew you before the foundations of the world and he knew that when he would come to you personally like he did to me 30 years ago when when I was in a condition where I had no idea how I was going to get out of the condition that I was in just like blind barus when Jesus was on the earth just like the woman that had the blood issued just like the woman at the well they had no idea how they were going to get out of their condition but then when he came and he said I am he to that woman at the well let me tell you her life changed when he came and he said to me I am he my life changed amen hallelujah when he came to you and you knew that that that you actually met the Living God your life had to change you could never you can never be the same amen and so here let's just continue reading here um from verse 19 he says here nevertheless no sorry let's let's continue then here from verse 15 yes then what am I to do I will pray with my spirit by the holy spirit that is within me but I will also pray intelligently with my mind and understanding God doesn't want you to be a robot God wants you to be sincere God wants your heart that's where God deals with individuals he wants your heart I will sing with my spirit by the holy spirit that is within me but I will sing intelligently with my mind and understanding also your conscious mind and the revelation of God's word comes together from time to time it's called divine revelation and when it happens it brings stimulation amen it brings you into a h it brings you out of your spiritual Amnesia and all of a sudden the word makes sense all of a sudden what you're reading comes to life what is that it's the stimulation of the spirit amen praise God and so he says here otherwise if you bless and render thanks with your spirit thoroughly aroused by the Holy Spirit how can anyone in the position of an outsider or he who is not gifted with interpreting of unknown tongues say the amen to your Thanksgiving since he does not know what you are saying Amen to be sure you may give thanks well nobly but the bystander is not edified it does it does him no good but I thank God that I speak in strange tongues more than any of you oh I'm on the wrong scripture I'm so sorry it flipped over on me but it still pertained there because we're talking about the spirit and having an understanding of the spirit and even when and even when when the Holy Spirit speaks in tongues there's an interpretation but it's only supernaturally revealed amen it's all by The Same Spirit praise God so let me go to verse um 17 but if Christ from from chapter 15 but if Christ has not been raised your faith is mere delusion futile fruitless and you are still in your sins under the control and penalty of sin and further those who have died in spiritual fellowship and Union with Christ have perished have are lost if you who are abiding in Christ have hope only in this life and this is all then we are all people most miserable and to be pied if our Salvation is not based on the resurrection of Jesus Christ in our personal lives and that he has Resurrected then our worship is all in vain our coming to church is in vain there's no good in US assembling ourselves without knowing that the resurrected Christ has taken control but the fact is that Christ the Messiah has been raised from the dead and he became the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep in death it's because Christ raised from the dead that we can stand here tonight and rejoice and know that we are the sons and daughters of God because he lives in us he says on that day you shall know that I am in the father ye in me and I in you amen praise God glory to God for since it was through a man that death came into the world it is also through a man that the resurrection of the dead has come amen for just as because of their Union of nature in Adam all people die so also by the virtue of their Union of nature shall all in Christ be made alive that's why Jesus said you must be born again you must receive my spirit if my spirit dwells in you the works that I do you shall do why because he's dwelling in you you it's all about the resurrection in you praise God let's read on here let's go to the next let's go right to uh number 10 and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespass and in sins so we've been quickened how are we quickened by the word that we received in our day you could never have have been quickened unless you receive the word in this day you couldn't listen if Moses message was to come out right now and say we're going to go and we're going to cross the Red Sea that's not the message that's going to Quicken you you wouldn't you wouldn't be drawn to it remember there's a supernatural element that God placed in you from before the foundations of the world he placed you in 2024 for a purpose those that were placed in the 1300s they were there for a purpose they had to go through the Dark Ages those that were there in Luther's day in the 15 the 1600s they were placed in that age they received the word for their day and they manifested the word in their day amen praise God but they had to be quickened they had to be birthed in that particular season just like you there's no other message that would Quicken you or any of the last few remember not everybody's G to receive this message this message is for the bride it's for the Church of the last days all the churches that's why the scripture that we read at the beginning the dead in Christ those were all the previous ages those were the ones a lot of them they called them Heretics but they were the real Christians they burned Jon of Ark to to a stake because she was spiritual and she had re Revelation from God and then they realized years later that they had actually burned a saint and they wanted to to to you know dig up the bones of the priest that that had done it at the time and you know to show punishment and to show repentance they're always rejecting God's word in the day that he comes he's the same yesterday today and forever they rejected Jesus Christ back then they're going to reject him today he's Jesus himself said if they hate you it's because they hated me first they hate and and who is he he is the word you go to somebody you show them acts 238 baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ there was nobody ever baptized any other way in the scriptures I challenge any minister or any Christian teacher out there to show me scripturally where anybody was ever baptized into the titles of the father son and Holy Ghost when Jesus said go ye out into into and and be my disciples teaching them baptizing them in the name listen Peter was right there when Jesus was resurrected and stood there he said all power has been given unto me in heaven and on Earth and they want to say there's three gods they want to say there's a Trinity there's no such thing as a Trinity there's no scripture for Trinity Jesus said said all power he didn't say some power he said all in heaven and on Earth well is there any other power there's no other power there was one that was sitting on the throne it was Christ but he went back to his fullness again and then when he resurrected and he stood in front of the of the Apostles and the disciples and he said go ye into all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost the name was Jesus Christ why did Peter on the day of Pentecost go back and read it acts 238 when they asked him what must we do to be saved did he say repent and be baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of no in the name of Jesus in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of of your unbelief because you believing a trinity you're stuck in unbelief you can never be born again by believing something that is not truth Jesus himself said the truth shall set you free not a lie I don't care how sincere you might be if you're sincere about God you'll honor his word you'll go back there and you'll say wait a minute I was wrong just like I did 30 years a ago and I realized being baptized as a baby I was not baptized I had no understanding and so when Jesus said repent be baptized in the name of the F the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost there's no other name whereby man must be saved was Jesus Christ Jesus Christ was the name given to the son which was a body for the Holy Ghost the Father the Almighty Elohim to dwell in the word was made flesh it came into the body so that it could go to the cross and take your place and when he gave up the ghost he gave it up so that it could come back on you but he would only give it back to his own he can't give his spirit it's just like a father a father can only birth his own children they will have his blood you try to give you know an individual the wrong blood they're going to die yes amen and the same blood that was in Jesus Christ which a blood is only a type of the holy spirit is what dwells in you amen and so when they repented and they listened to what Peter said they received the Holy Ghost the Bible said 3,000 on that day when Peter told them what what they must do to be saved to repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of their sins they received the Holy Ghost amen praise God and so God cannot go against his word he's got to stay with the word amen praise God it's just as simple as that Allelujah so let's go on here we're going to read we're going to read a quote here from brother brandham have I have not I sent thee and as we're reading we're going to just draw from it what we've been saying here tonight amen we're going to be done in about 15 minutes so Martha when she come up she fell down at his feet and she said Lord Lord that's what he was you see she recognized who he was you know you this is this is so important we need to recognize the word for our day amen that's what he was if you'd have being here my brother would not have died see he said but but even now whatever you ask God God will do it she knew that he was the Messiah she knew that he was the representation he was the Fulfillment of a child shall be given his name shall be the counselor the Prince of Peace the Mighty God they knew the Fulfillment of Isaiah had come and was standing there before them and in order for you you to to to truly have a lifechanging experience with Christ and a walk with God and to really believe Christianity and and know that you're going to be in the Rapture that you're going to be saved from a world that's falling apart right now it's falling apart right around us Saints don't tell me it's not everything is crumbling Financial systems are crumbling everything Wars everything else don't don't look around and and be like the kid that's walking through through the cemetery and whistling recognize what's really taking place out there and there's only one safe place and that safe place is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever but even now whatever you ask God he'll do it oh there you are there you are no matter what you've done your attitude you're following what God Said do whether you said this or that or whether you you did come or you didn't come whatever you ask God God will do it to you he said thy brother shall rise again he he was telling her he realized that that that she had recognized and he was now in the present stage of his ministry he was the resurrection and the life he said thy brother shall rise again she said y Lord he will rise in the last days he will rise he's a good man he will he will rise in the general Resurrection Resurrection but Jesus turned around and said I am the resurrection and eternal life you don't have to wait until the end time you can receive Christ right now you can receive the benefits of transformation and change in your personal life right now you don't have to stay in the condition that you're in the resurrected Christ is here today he can take you out of your alcohol he can take you out of your drug abuse he can take you out of your lying your cheating your stealing he can remove you from all of those things so that you can feel that you've got a future and that your future is clear amen praise God he's a good man nobody could say that but him he's the only one that could say I am the resurrection though he were dead yet shall he live nobody could say that but him he that he liveth and believeth in me me shall never die believest thou this she said yay Lord I believe that you are the Son of God that was to come into the world there you are what is it she's acting she's moving into acting on her faith and in order for you I don't care who you are if you've not come to that place where you've recognized Jesus Christ is the only way way true in the life and you're not going to the Waters of baptism you're not acting on the word you're stuck in your tradition you're stuck in your in in in what your your your your priest told you or what you've been taught by your mom or by your dad or by the books that you read you're stuck in those traditions of man until you come to the place where you recognize that your birth certificate Bears record that Jesus Christ died and Rose 20,24 years ago until you come to that place what whatever religion you might be caught up in you need to search the scriptures and you need to come to a place where you experience the resurrection Hallelujah she wants to see a miracle so she's finding out what the word says that's what everybody needs to do you want a miracle in your life I remember when I was at that point in my life I was coming to the church I was coming to the services I was hearing the word of God but I knew that I was still addicted to the drugs I knew that it still had such a strong hold on me but I said this this preacher is talking about miracles constantly and I need a miracle and then I came to realize the only way that I could experience a miracle is to know that he was a reality and that he could do what he said he would do and I took him at his word I challenged him I went up to the Altar and I said I need I I went right to Pastor Simon I said I want the Holy Ghost because I knew that the Holy Ghost was the power of God was Christ himself he was the strong one he could be the one that could kick out this addiction and and change my life and turn it around so that I wouldn't have to be in constant shame because that's how I was living so here he says it's standing there in the form of the Son of God I believe the word it's standing there in the form of the Son of God his words is not his not me that speaketh but the father that dwelleth in me whatever comes from them little lips of yours that speaks I'll believe it's the commission of God oh my my there you you are the Messiah what is Messiah the anointed one you are God's anointed one God had an anointed one in a lesser measure one day and His Name Was Elijah and there Elisha and the woman had a baby that died and she went up to this servant of God and she said thou man of God she recognized him she and and that the anointed one of God come and walked through the floor laid his body upon this little dead baby and it sneezed seven times and come to life and if God did that for his anointed Prophet how much more will he do by Emmanuel by God himself see Mary these are thoughts that brother brandham was bringing out here that you know she she was she was in that moment she came to realize wait a minute here he is the resurrection he's here right now he can whatever he says can take place whatever God says he can do in your life amen if you if you can believe that it's possible Jesus Christ said all things are possible to them that believe go to the next slide as we continue and she said I believe that you are the Son of God if you ever get anything from God you've got to believe God's servant God's word see you know that those that carry the word in this hour those that are ministering ing in this position those like you that are out there working that are carriers of the word you are God's representation and you are carriers of the word and you're the mercy seat for somebody people can find Mercy just by getting to know you because the spirit that's in you can be trans it can be sent from you just by speaking the word and if there's an attribute of God if there's representation in that individual just like it was in me just like it was in you that's why you find yourself here it has to respond to the word you don't have to coax you don't have to try to convince somebody you don't have to you force your children to come into the house of the Lord we can't force our children to come and serve God that's foolishness we train them up in the way of the Lord yes when they were younger we raised them here we brought them into the house of the Lord but then they become adults they become capable of making their own decisions and every individual must make their own decision you're not to be ashamed if your children are not serving the lord you're to continue to pray for them and believe that God can do for them what he did for you because God is Not uh you know uh he doesn't have grandchildren let's put it that way he's got Sons and Daughters of God Amen praise God and so if you ever get anything from God you've got to believe God's servant God's word see and he was the word I believe just tell me what to do where have you laid him down he went to the Grave weeping like a man you got to remember when Christ was in that human body he was human but yet he was God he was human when he was weeping but he was God when he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth that had to be God to speak and call Lazarus from the grave where have you laid him down he went to that grave weeping like a man when he got there what did he say now do when what did he say now do when you get there see you got something to do too listen to what he saying here you got see you got something to do too you know said take ye away the stone if you want to see a miracle you sick people tonight if you want to see a miracle take away the stone take away that stone that sin that lays at the door that's why I got this whole thought about rolling away the stone you know here we are we're entering into the Easter season but people need to recognize that the rolling away of the stone was not something that happened 2,000 years ago it's something that needs to happen in individual lives if they're going to come to recognize that Jesus Christ is a reality and that they can be saved amen praise God they need to roll away some Stones what is it say brother brandham I don't do nothing but if you don't believe it it can't happen it's to them that believe Jesus said all things are possible to them that Bel Hallelujah but if you don't believe it it can't happen take away that stone of unbelief and watch what happens just take away the stone and when she obeyed the word of the Lord she saw a miracle sure we're going to end it right there and when we come back next time we're going to look at how we have some stones to roll away in our lives let the musicians come praise God I trust that that somehow you can you can recognize as we're entering into the Easter season that the power of the resurrection and the importance of recognizing that he is now present he wants to change your life he wants to draw you out of that denominational thinking he wants to pull you away from from the traditions of man he wants you to know him personally and he wants to come into your life and he wants to roll away stones in your life that are hindering you from serving him to the fullness to the capacity that he wants you to to to to serve him many of you have come into this ministry this is not just an ordinary Ministry this is a Supernatural Ministry not because of Pastor Danny or former Pastor John Simon or the other ministers that are preaching here but because we are under the leadership of Jesus Christ he's the king he's the high priest he's our Lord he's the one that controls and leads and directs this church he is our leader and our guide sure we have offices we have positions God has a provided way of leading guiding and directing his church and we're going to be looking at things here when we come back next time we're going to be looking how how how Christ is the mystical body that we are a part of and when we when we can think that we can just be off on our own and that we don't need Christ which is the body you deteriorate real fast and you cannot progress with God your walk stops but God wants us to come out of that the only way that we're going to be changed in this day and in this hour if is if the word progresses in our lives and takes away all self puts all of our Humanity our carnality all of our own mental thinking as human beings unless we move that aside and we allow the mind of Christ to take control will never be fully changed remember you heard the prophet when I read the quote at the beginning all that's left to do is she needs to sit in the presence of the Sun and ripen and how you going to be in the presence of the son you're going to be coming under the leadership of the word for this hour you're going to come under a Ministry you're going to come under a pastor you're going to recognize that there's that there's a provided way where God is feeding his sheep he told them feed my Lambs feed my sheep that's why you're going to hear I'm not going to be coming here with deep messages on the opening of the word and the Seven seal and all those things those things will be revealed to individuals as the Lord wants to reveal it in their time and in their season as they feed on the word of God remember the spirit of truth will guide you into all truth it's the holy ghost that feeds you and gives you what you need when you come here under expectation no matter how simple the word might appear or how simple and how you've heard the scriptures over and over and over again when the mighty Angel comes and stands behind the the the speaker and and allows his Spirit to start ministering to individual needs in the midst you might not recognize it and the reason you won't recognize it is because you're coming with a carnal mind thinking that you need man to feed you that's denominational teaching that's not what we come under here when we come into the house of the Lord we come under the supernatural presence of the Living God where he takes the preeminence and he starts to speak to individuals he starts to correct individuals he starts to deliver individuals he starts to open their understanding so that they can progress with him instead of sit idle in their own mental perception does that make sense it's what the spirit of God wants to do in this hour it's not about joining a church we're not a church full of thousands of people but we're a church that have people with the spirit of God that the amen can respond back to the amen and say Amen to the word of God and not be ashamed because oh I'm going to be I'm going to be I'm I'm going to feel ashamed by going to that church because they don't have any High influential people going to that church like they do down here at Harvest God's not looking for high influentials you show me in the scriptures where he did that he rebuked all those individuals when he came to the Earth he said I come for those that are sick all the high influentials they they rejected him and they called him be elab they'll do the same thing today praise God that's why we're here that's why we come under this revelation of this word that's what excites my soul that's why I want to come into the house of the Lord on Wednesdays and Friday night prayer meetings and Sundays because I want to meet with the Living God I need Deliverance in my life we need Deliverance in our lives we're never going to be fully delivered until we're changed you think you're going to not have problems after you leave this place sure I'm talking about all the wonderful things about God and his word and how he delivers and he's he's your deliverer he can he can take you out of your sickness he can take you out of your alcoholism he can pull you out of your drug addiction but then you need to overcome as an individual you still need to overcome the shame the reproach oh I go to that church yeah search the scripture and if you search the scripture and you get down on your knees and you trust God and you pray to God you don't look to man you don't look to what somebody you trust God you will have the same experience that every son and daughter of God has and they can be zealous and they can stand there and they know where they stand there's a difference praise God God bless you Saints let us pray father what an honor and what a privilege Lord to have your spirit move in our hearts and in our lives and to take control and have your way and just do things and say things Lord that that that just goes against the tide father but yet it's all so simple in the word of God it's all so simple it's right there in the scriptures Lord we can't help but see the Simplicity of your word Lord may you take control and just meet the needs of your children Lord those that are listening in tonight father those that are here that are uh witnesses that we testify to Lord may your spirit and your anointing move on their lives Lord you know all your own you you said not one of them is going to be left behind not one so we don't worry about that as humans we you know we look at our friends our families our loved ones and Lord we love them we want to see them receive truth and the truth sets them free that's what we get excited about Lord may you take control father as we enter into this Easter season Lord may it be so different for each and every one of us through this ministry through the preaching of your word Lord May Hearts be transformed to see the resurrection Easter morning
