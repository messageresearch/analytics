[0:05] [Music]
[0:18] good Sunday morning friends
[0:22] bless you neighbors
[0:25] welcome to believers from around the
[0:30] world and locally let us come into his
[0:36] house with Thanksgiving and into his
[0:41] courts with praise welcome to another
[0:46] broadcast sponsored by good neighbor
[0:50] ministries of Burlington Ontario I'm
[0:54] Pastor John Steinman
[0:56] let us pray our gracious Heavenly Father
[1:03] sincerely we pray from the bottom of our
[1:06] hearts for our prime minister for our
[1:12] premiere for the best of health and
[1:17] vigorous life we pray Lord for all
[1:23] frontline workers we pray for the safety
[1:29] of our neighbors and friends we pray for
[1:35] her loved ones and believers everywhere
[1:40] Oh God
[1:43] send forth thy light and truth from this
[1:48] broadcast may you shine your light of
[1:53] your word and your glorious gospel
[1:56] everywhere and
[2:01] your servant as we preach the word and
[2:05] take all the glory honor and praise for
[2:10] we ask it in the name of our Lord Jesus
[2:13] Christ well friends last week I spoke on
[2:25] this subject of the quickening spirit
[2:31] the spirit quickening the word to the
[2:34] age and now I'd like to read from our
[2:38] King James Version of the Bible
[2:41] I'm reading first Corinthians chapter 15
[2:45] verse 45 and so it is written the first
[2:53] man Adam was made a living soul the last
[3:01] Adam was made a quickening spirit let us
[3:08] give glory to God that this marvelous
[3:12] quickening spirit of God is here with us
[3:16] this morning now before I begin to
[3:22] advance from where we left off last week
[3:28] I'd like to clarify the meaning of the
[3:34] word quicken what does this word quicken
[3:38] mean from Google it says to quicken
[3:43] means to make faster to speed up to
[3:53] accelerate something so quick
[3:58] for the means to stimulate as or to
[4:04] excite as in stimulating interest you
[4:09] know exciting interest to quicken means
[4:13] to restore life for example the body of
[4:20] Christ that laid in the tomb for three
[4:22] days was quittin by the Holy Spirit
[4:27] which means he was restored back to life
[4:31] now there's a ancient or arc-8 meaning
[4:37] to the word quittin but it has some
[4:40] application to what we are talking about
[4:44] and one of those meanings is to cause a
[4:50] fire to burn to quicken is the cause a
[4:55] fire to burn also to quicken means ah
[5:03] signs of life signs of life for example
[5:07] of signs of movement of a fetus and the
[5:18] mother can now become conscious that
[5:22] there is life life is coming forth signs
[5:27] of life
[5:29] now with that understanding last Sunday
[5:33] in part two of this series on the spirit
[5:37] Quinton's the word I quoted from a poem
[5:42] written by K L Brown called the little
[5:47] plant and here it is in the heart of a
[5:52] seed buried deep so deep a tiny plant
[5:57] lay fast asleep
[6:00] wakes at the sunshine and creeks to the
[6:04] light wakes at the voice of the rain
[6:07] drops bright the lip
[6:10] plant herd and rose up to see what they
[6:16] wonderful outside world would be that's
[6:21] a plan from KL Brown now I talked about
[6:27] how we are offsprings of the almighty
[6:32] Acts chapter 17 verses 26 to 29 for Paul
[6:37] there in the accent says for you are his
[6:41] offspring
[6:42] you are his children in other words you
[6:45] are his attributes you are his seat
[6:49] genes and uh now we understand I spoke
[6:53] of how we were in him from before the
[6:58] foundation of the world and uh just as a
[7:04] man would have his children in him until
[7:10] he is able to see his generation that
[7:15] were in him and then he can see his
[7:20] generation made manifest in front of him
[7:25] then he can talk to them and they can
[7:29] talk with him and they can have
[7:31] fellowship one with the other now if
[7:36] you're a true child of God then you
[7:40] really are an eternal being that has
[7:44] trapped in a body of time or a time body
[7:49] in one sense you're a soul imprisoned
[7:56] imprisoned here but thanks be to God the
[8:03] Word of God as it went down into the
[8:06] prison and set the prisoners free that
[8:09] same word of God is here in this last
[8:13] day this last age to sip every captive
[8:18] on every prisoner free by the opening of
[8:22] the word
[8:23] the opening of the prison doors and
[8:26] using the key of revelation upon this
[8:31] rock I'll build my church and the gates
[8:34] of Hell will not prevail against it by
[8:38] the opening of the Gateway you are able
[8:42] to come out into the unfailing reality
[8:46] of the Living God to recognize who you
[8:51] are and that you are an eternal being
[8:54] and you know in a movie some years ago
[9:00] there was a character in there called ET
[9:04] but that's just a movie you and I are
[9:09] the real et's eternal beings come from
[9:15] the presence of Almighty God trapped in
[9:19] a flesh body serving his purpose here on
[9:23] earth until our return back to glory yes
[9:28] ET it's going home time I'm here to tell
[9:32] you ET it's rapture time it's time for
[9:37] us to turn our hearts towards heaven and
[9:41] home and towards our heavenly father
[9:44] with joy within our hearts knowing that
[9:48] we on our way back to the Godhead we are
[9:52] way back going back into the presence of
[9:55] the Almighty God now with the opening of
[9:58] the seven seals we have witnessed the
[10:02] coming of the Lord
[10:04] in the form of his resurrected restored
[10:09] and revealed word which is now preparing
[10:14] our hearts and prepared the way for his
[10:19] corporal coming the rapture is at hand
[10:23] the time is at hand the Lord's rapturing
[10:29] power is here amongst us to prepare us
[10:34] for the event we are
[10:37] many by His grace in the process of the
[10:43] rapture which leads up to the event of
[10:48] the rapture and I'm glad I'm ending this
[10:52] stream of time this stream of Revelation
[10:56] this stream of the Holy Spirit

[21:17] save those that were lost and he is
[21:20] seeking he is seeking the lost is kindly
[21:24] entreating Oh turn turn for white will
[21:28] you die come to Christ come to the
[21:31] perfect word come into a perfect
[21:34] understanding and a perfect revelation
[21:36] of who he is and who you are Oh clearly
[21:42] God sent his rain
[21:44] census rain on the just and upon the
[21:48] unjust
[21:49] yes sir and it indentifies his see yes
[21:54] by the holy spirit the reign of God
[21:58] oh the mighty cleansing reins of God
[22:02] searches and finds his own and brings
[22:06] them to a consciousness of God and the
[22:10] work that God is doing within their soul
[22:13] the Spirit is here to quicken the word
[22:17] and to make it live again he witnessed
[22:22] the word because he wants us to be his
[22:25] witnesses now I realize I'm not speaking
[22:28] only that he's quitting our
[22:31] understanding today words written in the
[22:35] Bible or in the message but the Spirit
[22:38] of God is here to quicken you and I who
[22:44] are living revelations of that word for
[22:49] we were a part of that word from before
[22:53] the foundation of the world and preach
[22:56] through the predestinated mystery of his
[23:00] will place into human bodies that we
[23:05] were born into for a purpose that we
[23:09] might manifest him we have a name to
[23:12] declare we have a mission to to perform
[23:16] and we have a word from him that we must
[23:20] make manifest we have a character that
[23:23] we must declare that the people can see
[23:26] God in Christ Christ in the church and
[23:29] that Kingdom coming listen be his holy
[23:32] and precious name yes sir now we realize
[23:37] that the Spirit which was the word to
[23:42] make it live and the word is a conductor
[23:46] for the Holy Spirit when the Spirit
[23:51] follows the Word of God and causes the
[23:56] Word of God
[23:57] live thanks Peter God the great holy
[24:01] spirit the white horse rider is here
[24:06] raining on the word into our hearts on
[24:11] the white horse of the revelation of the
[24:14] word Rivet revelation 19:11 2:16 and he
[24:21] came riding on the white horns and upon
[24:24] his time he was written king of kings
[24:26] lord of lords and his name was called
[24:29] the Word of God that conquering all
[24:32] conquering word King is writing into art
[24:37] spirits are so today we have the
[24:40] opportunity for him to be the mighty
[24:45] Conqueror and to have the preeminence in
[24:48] our lives
[24:49] and that we can surrender all and live
[24:53] for him forgetting the past that is
[24:57] behind and press towards a glorious
[24:59] wonderful future of a genuine Christian
[25:04] life walking in the light of the world
[25:06] amen oh of course we are the span
[25:09] friends that though they the word is a
[25:13] conductor for the Holy Spirit but
[25:18] plastic cannot conduct the Holy Spirit
[25:21] or me a conductor for the Holy Spirit if
[25:24] you're just a plastic Christian if
[25:27] you're a one that is a dramatic
[25:29] Christian that lives by oh and Christian
[25:33] is supposed to act this way and you
[25:36] perfect your act your your Christian act
[25:40] until it becomes nothing but a Christian
[25:44] from a life you're nothing but a plastic
[25:47] Christian you see God can't flow through
[25:51] that God can't use that as a conductor
[25:54] Oh God can't flow through rubber you
[25:58] know rubber is not a conductor it's an
[26:02] insulator so here you find that you've
[26:05] got these rubber Christians
[26:07] in the church they're out the church
[26:09] there in the front door of the back door
[26:12] today they're safe tomorrow their loss
[26:14] today there are real sanctified tomorrow
[26:17] they're back slidden somewhere out there
[26:21] like that God doesn't look for rubber
[26:25] Christians
[26:26] maybe not the rubber we're supposed to
[26:29] be conductors for the glory of God then
[26:32] you'll have most Christians that are
[26:33] like a block of wood right there wooden
[26:37] in church they'll just sit there and
[26:41] they'll grim and they'll stare at that
[26:47] preacher there to feel embarrassed even
[26:50] to say Amen there I feel embarrassed to
[26:55] say glory to God
[26:56] they'll be ashamed to raise their hands
[27:00] to their Creator and to their makeup Oh
[27:03] think about those wooden men those
[27:07] wooden women wouldn't Christians just
[27:11] told when they're to rise told when
[27:15] they're to sit told when they can say
[27:19] Amen or a certain uh you know canned
[27:23] phrase instead of fresh food from the
[27:27] presence of Almighty God
[27:29] oh we will have to be wooden Christians
[27:32] you can't be a conductor for the Holy
[27:34] Spirit you can't be a conductor for acts
[27:38] 1:8 acts 2:4 the power of God to flow
[27:42] through your life and to anoint you and
[27:44] use you for his glory and honor we are
[27:48] to be as we all know in natural life
[27:51] copper is a marvelous conductor of
[27:54] electricity we want to be like a copper
[27:58] wire that's filled with the energy and
[28:03] power and Dunamis of the Holy Spirit of
[28:06] Almighty God vibrating and living
[28:09] through your entire being animating and
[28:12] causing you to be a life under the
[28:15] anointing of the Holy Spirit I'm not
[28:17] talking about just an emotion and
[28:20] about the genuine 100 proof baptism of
[28:27] the holy spirit filling your soul for
[28:30] the glory divine Oh God
[28:33] take your Lord you'll save the best wine
[28:35] for last and here's the best wine for
[28:38] this hour may the ways of God in new
[28:41] white skins baptized you are going to
[28:44] use you fill you with his presence which
[28:48] is being to live through you all thanks
[28:51] be to his wonderful name yes sir him so
[28:55] he's calling every one of us to be
[28:59] conductors of his word so that God's
[29:03] Word must flow through us learn his name
[29:06] and so the great Holy Spirit is here to
[29:12] rescue by his word and to cause you to
[29:17] become prisoners of Jesus Christ that
[29:20] you might be go out working hard for the
[29:24] Lord in other words to be on the large
[29:27] chain gang to be prisoners of Jesus
[29:31] Christ chained to him shackled to him by
[29:35] the Holy Ghost that you might only do
[29:38] his will for sons and daughters of God
[29:42] are led by the Spirit of Almighty God
[29:45] may the Spirit of God take the whole of
[29:49] you until we are all handcuffed by the
[29:52] Holy Ghost and walking in his Divine
[29:55] Will and his plan and his purpose Oh
[29:58] conductors of his word that we might be
[30:02] able to say flow through me Holy Spirit
[30:06] flow through me flow through me Holy
[30:11] Spirit flow through me Oh God
[30:16] as I lift my hands to worship may the
[30:19] spirit of Almighty God flow right
[30:22] through my soul to quicken us to empower
[30:25] us to flow through us that we might
[30:28] become conductors of his love conductors
[30:32] of his life conductors as Mary was in
[30:36] the days when she received the Word of
[30:40] God how did she receive it she received
[30:44] it by the work spoken word of an angel
[30:48] who stood before her and said you shall
[30:52] bear a son his name shall be called
[30:55] Jesus and thanks be to God that God sent
[30:59] a seventh angel church each messenger in
[31:03] this last day to stand before us and to
[31:07] speak his word into our soul that there
[31:10] might be comforta a new birth a new
[31:13] creation and new life glory to God
[31:17] forevermore
[31:18] and here we are to become conductors and
[31:22] carriers of the Word of God who are
[31:26] willing to bear the shame and reproach
[31:30] for this message and for his name to be
[31:34] reproach for his name oh yes they call
[31:38] you one God people they call you serpent
[31:42] seed people they call you all kinds of
[31:46] names amen holy rollers Pentecostal even
[31:53] people of this message don't recognize
[31:55] the difference by an anointed message
[31:58] child of God to a modern-day Pentecostal
[32:06] contrary to God's Word they can't even
[32:09] discern the Lord's body and if you knew
[32:13] you're an animated anointed I'm moving
[32:15] on the inspiration of nineteen and
[32:18] leadership the Holy Spirit and the gifts
[32:21] of God are rich and pure and holy and
[32:25] working within the body they can
[32:29] recognize God's Spirit God help us in
[32:33] this hour thanks be to God we are here
[32:37] to bear the reproach for this word that
[32:41] we are telling right now even so he's
[32:44] calling you and I to become messengers
[32:48] of His grace and of his mercy to quicken
[32:52] to quicken quicken also means to cause a
[32:57] fire to burn oh thank god
[33:02] the mechanics of the word has been
[33:04] restored and a lot of believers are
[33:07] happy with the mechanics of the word
[33:10] they are happy with all the quotations
[33:12] they're happy with knowing all the
[33:15] wonderful things said spoken by the
[33:18] great messenger that came they're very
[33:21] happy with that the word has been
[33:24] restored on part of his spiritual body
[33:28] also being restored because the written
[33:33] word and spoken word that was restored
[33:37] was there was just a representation of
[33:41] the believers or of the spiritual bodies
[33:49] of the elect for this age and for this
[33:54] hour and the Word of God is calling out
[33:57] in this day and in this hour that's a
[34:00] spirit Gosport he crawls to his own o

[34:29] come I'm ready you are ready let's get
[34:33] ready that's being ready let's be
[34:35] prepared
[34:36] what fire I'm talking about the failure
[34:38] of the Holy Ghost I'm talking about
[34:41] far as it was on the day of Pentecost
[34:45] I'm talking about the dynamics coming up
[34:50] on the mechanics I'm talking about the
[34:54] pillar of fire there love ghosts of God
[34:59] coming up on the written word the Rhema
[35:03] of God the Lumos causes the written
[35:08] Rhema word to come wave to shine out the
[35:15] McNown itself to reveal God's secrets
[35:19] yes sir - cause that word to live again
[35:24] written spoken and living word to live
[35:30] again and to produce another book of
[35:35] Acts another book of actions moved by
[35:42] the Holy Spirit anointed by God God
[35:46] living moving and having his entire
[35:49] being in his people and he making
[35:53] himself manifest as their God their
[35:56] creat creator their Redeemer their
[36:00] Savior they're coming king blessed be
[36:03] his name thank you Lord hallelujah yes
[36:07] sir God's Spirit is here with us today
[36:11] now we want to use the illustration as
[36:15] has already been utilized by God's
[36:18] prophet that you can have a perfectly
[36:23] brand-new car a beautiful Porsche a
[36:30] wonderful Cadillac whatever the car of
[36:36] your heart brand-new but if that color
[36:45] has
[36:46] no gas in it you may keep polishing that
[36:50] car all day long all day long at
[36:54] Mariette admiring the church admiringly
[37:00] admiring your life even that you're a
[37:03] good man you're a good woman here you
[37:06] know you live for you're a church man or
[37:08] a church woman here yeah you can you may
[37:10] even say you're a message believer I
[37:12] follow the word that's that's okay but
[37:15] all you have is a polished a car and a
[37:18] good exterior where your actions and
[37:22] your acts your dramatizations are so
[37:24] less that none can see or discern what
[37:28] lurks our lives behind that veil oh but
[37:33] if there is no gasoline in the car the
[37:38] car will not move you can turn the key
[37:41] as much as you want the car will move
[37:46] but then if you went to God's filling
[37:49] station for inspiration and the Holy
[37:52] Ghost
[37:52] stretch your soul opens up the word and
[37:56] the word that you have been accumulating
[37:59] through the day that years like the
[38:02] Apostles did while they were with Jesus
[38:04] three and a half years they act with him
[38:06] they slept with him to fish with him and
[38:09] they knew him the word but they have no
[38:12] revelation of who he was who he really
[38:15] was
[38:16] they this sense things but here this
[38:19] brother sister the Word of God was a
[38:22] being stored up in your storehouse of
[38:26] your soul that word was dead back into
[38:30] you and you may have been following it
[38:33] for years and years following him but
[38:37] that still will not make your vehicle
[38:41] move for your vehicle to move you first
[38:46] have to be able to have a key electronic
[38:49] or a natural one that's placed in there
[38:53] and when that kiss turned our pressed
[38:56] something happens you must have have
[39:00] yes if they're already and when the key
[39:04] which is what I'm trying to turn by the
[39:07] Holy Spirit that Kia's turn then
[39:11] something happens within the combustion
[39:14] chamber of the color the combustion
[39:18] chamber of the human heart
[39:20] all of a sudden a spark a revelation a
[39:26] supernatural inspiration from the
[39:29] presence of God strikes that soul and
[39:32] the spark in the combustion chamber off
[39:35] of that spark Club strikes that gas in
[39:38] there and it just produces power it
[39:42] produces high-octane power takes you
[39:46] from the first and second pull and puts
[39:49] you under the inspiration of the mighty
[39:52] angel inspiration of the third Pole to
[39:56] move in him and live in him and have
[39:59] your being in him so that you may be a
[40:01] conductor for the word of God and that
[40:04] his word may come to pass in and through
[40:07] your life oh then you'll become an
[40:10] oddball
[40:10] then you become strange to people then
[40:14] you may be called crazy you may be
[40:16] called a different you can't be
[40:21] explained why because it's the Word of
[40:24] God making the self known in you as an
[40:27] individual Oh blessed be the name of our
[40:31] Living God yes sir so God just quit ins
[40:35] and us and uses us as conductors that we
[40:41] might relay convey that we might conduct
[40:46] his word witnesses you shall become
[40:50] witnesses after that the Holy Ghost is
[40:54] come upon you when he dwells in you and
[40:58] he flows through you oh thanks be to God
[41:01] he lives in me I pray God he lives in
[41:05] you I pray God that all you have is not
[41:08] just a baptism of the Holy Ghost one of
[41:11] we're baptized means that tips all comes
[41:14] from the word baptizo which means to dip
[41:18] him and under and to be brought back out
[41:21] so a baptism means you went in and then
[41:25] you will under yes you went under but to
[41:28] come back out but we're not talking
[41:30] about just a baptism of the Holy Ghost
[41:33] justification main wait for
[41:34] certification certification make way for
[41:38] the baptism of the holy spirit and now
[41:41] the holy the baptism Holy Spirit makes
[41:44] way for the Holy Ghost himself to end
[41:47] well the Emmanuel that again he may be
[41:51] God with us that he might become the son
[41:56] of man being revealed again in this
[41:59] church body the bright form making
[42:02] himself known to his people by living in
[42:05] them walking in them moving in them
[42:07] being their God in them the word that
[42:10] was made flesh back there
[42:12] now if you flesh that has been redeemed
[42:16] is going back to becoming word from the
[42:19] presence of Almighty God so how does the
[42:23] spirit quicken the word so that we are
[42:27] so that the word can become the vehicle
[42:31] to to make known his truth to make known
[42:37] his presence and his perfect stature his
[42:42] character his children walking like him
[42:47] acting like him moving like him under
[42:51] because it's in their nature they're a
[42:53] part of him and they're moving in the
[42:56] holy spirit of the Living God hallelujah
[42:59] now he does it by revelation Paul the
[43:05] Apostle did say
[43:10] that by revelation he made known to me
[43:15] the mystery Ephesians chapter 3 verse 3
[43:19] by revelation Paul with all of his
[43:23] understanding Paul Peter turned to Paul
[43:27] and said Paul you're saying such deep
[43:29] things that even I have to think about
[43:32] them I I oh I have to really get to
[43:36] understand some of the things you're
[43:37] saying Paul but Paul said that's not me
[43:41] he revealed to me the mystery he had to
[43:45] make it known and no man with his own
[43:49] wisdom of understanding him stand before
[43:53] God's bride but God has to send his
[43:57] servants with his word for this hour and
[44:00] by revelation he made known to me the
[44:05] mystery or in other words he revealed to
[44:08] me his hidden secrets he revealed to me
[44:12] previously hidden things and made them
[44:15] plain yes sir Oh what is a mystery a
[44:20] mystery is a hidden secret something
[44:24] that was hidden no made plain but in
[44:29] which a supernatural element still
[44:32] remains
[44:34] I believe that supernatural element is
[44:36] the element of the Holy Spirit's ability
[44:39] to reveal the word and to propagate the
[44:43] word by revelation the fertilizer soul
[44:48] enter pollinate you with the presence of
[44:52] God and the power of the Holy Spirit
[44:54] that you might be saying be able to say
