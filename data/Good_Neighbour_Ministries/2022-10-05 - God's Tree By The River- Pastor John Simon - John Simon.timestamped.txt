[26:20] oh my Queen Elizabeth is gone now
[26:25] very powerful woman you know
[26:28] the churches are over
[26:30] and now I I noticed that today
[26:35] that they were they're going to be
[26:37] sending up another spaceship
[26:41] uh into the heavens
[26:43] and for the first time in the history of
[26:49] spaceships going up
[26:51] the commander of the entire project will
[26:56] be a woman
[26:58] the woman is now going to be the head of
[27:03] this PACE program that's going up into
[27:06] the heavens so I just want you to just
[27:08] notice these little signs pointing to
[27:12] the power and influence of the woman
[27:17] typing of the church slowly coming in
[27:23] um and though it looks slight it's just
[27:26] coming in without notice the people
[27:28] don't know what is absolutely going on
[27:32] all the business in the United States
[27:35] they're fighting over whether to have a
[27:37] dictatorship and move away from
[27:39] democracy it's all Paving the way for
[27:42] the proposal dictator
[27:45] it's all Paving the way for that so it
[27:49] will not come broad you know broad like
[27:52] that you're coming more subtly but it'll
[27:55] be literally the same thing
[27:58] coming in that way to rule one man like
[28:02] that ruling over the people uh with uh
[28:06] but he's not coming just with political
[28:07] power he's coming Financial religious
[28:10] spiritual
[28:12] and a political power he's coming with
[28:15] all of those Powers combined to bring it
[28:18] to Bear may God bless you thank you for
[28:22] um listening to just these few comments
[28:24] but uh to me when I see these things I
[28:28] know things are happening out there
[28:30] things are taking place things are
[28:32] moving praise the Lord now
[28:36] um on Wednesday nights of course I just
[28:40] like to get to the word so you can get
[28:44] out not because I want to rush out if
[28:46] the Holy Spirit wants to do something
[28:49] and he'll do something other than that
[28:52] in the middle of the week I want to be
[28:55] able to get back home you know and rest
[28:58] and go back to your work and become on
[29:00] the first day of the week and we give
[29:02] glory and praise to God Amen praise the
[29:05] Lord uh let us read the scripture first
[29:08] before I begin to
[29:10] sum 1.
[29:14] and for a brief while I'll just talk
[29:18] about the things of God Psalms chapter
[29:21] 1.
[29:23] begins blessed is the man
[29:28] that walketh not in the Council of the
[29:31] ungodly
[29:32] nor standeth in the way of sinners
[29:36] nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful
[29:41] but his Delight is in the law of the
[29:44] Lord
[29:45] and in his law doth he meditate day and
[29:50] night
[29:51] and he this is my text shall be like a
[29:56] tree
[29:57] planted by the rivers of living
[30:03] by the rivers of water
[30:05] that bring it forth
[30:07] his fruit
[30:09] in his season
[30:12] his Leaf also shall not build them and
[30:16] whatsoever he do it shall prosper
[30:20] the ungodly are not so
[30:23] but our lighted shaft which the wind
[30:26] driveth away
[30:28] therefore the ungodly shall not stand in
[30:33] the Judgment nor sinners in the
[30:36] congregation of the righteous
[30:39] for the Lord knoweth the way of the
[30:41] righteous
[30:42] but the way of the ungodly
[30:45] Shall Perish amen
[30:49] gracious Heavenly Father we have read
[30:52] from the holy script and now we pray
[30:55] father just a bit of a bread of life as
[31:00] we go along the way on this week day
[31:04] father just strengthen us and recharge
[31:08] us father may your life our father make
[31:12] us so strong with the Vitality of the
[31:15] Holy Ghost that we might carry out your
[31:18] will and purpose and plan in the name of
[31:22] Jesus Christ we ask it in Jesus name
[31:24] amen and amen
[31:27] please be seated
[31:30] I want to call this God's Tree by the
[31:33] river
[31:35] and it's funny why I called it that
[31:38] because when I read the scripture uh I I
[31:44] thought of an old tree that I knew
[31:48] um in days of Boyhood and that was a
[31:53] tree known to all the boys in the tongue
[31:56] and we love that tree because that's the
[32:00] tree that was hanging branches big
[32:04] branches that you can go out on hanging
[32:08] over the river
[32:09] and we just love that tree
[32:12] because from that tree we can plunge off
[32:16] of the tree right in the river and do
[32:19] our swimming and we did a lot of
[32:22] swimming and plunging off of that tree
[32:25] so that tree has
[32:28] um grip uh you know it holds a great
[32:31] place in memory when you think back of
[32:35] some of the things you did as a young
[32:39] person uh jumping off of that tree some
[32:43] people jumped off with a tire or
[32:46] something a tube and other ones that can
[32:49] really swim they jumped up plunged off
[32:51] and they swam around and everything in
[32:54] that tree that was by the river and that
[32:58] tree was there for years I've never gone
[33:01] back so I don't know if the tree is
[33:03] still there because the Bible tells us
[33:06] that this tree that's planted by the
[33:08] river of Living Water it can't with them
[33:12] so I don't know if that tree may still
[33:15] be alive for all I know and maybe young
[33:18] men of this generation may be doing
[33:21] exactly the same thing lunging off the
[33:24] branches of that tree in the river amen
[33:28] now um I'm looking at the fact quoting
[33:33] first brother Branham here God is
[33:36] speaking of his fruit tree that he had
[33:39] planted
[33:41] he planted a fruit tree
[33:44] amen and he planted it on the day of
[33:47] Pentecost now he said that because
[33:50] that's where he wanted to begin he
[33:52] didn't want to go from Genesis and you
[33:55] know tracing the tree all the way down
[33:57] so he just started there for this
[34:00] dispensation of which he was the prophet
[34:03] and Minister too that uh he would talk
[34:07] about that not talk about it in Israel
[34:10] not talk about it back there he briefly
[34:13] alluded to the fact how Kane's
[34:16] generation back there tried to kill the
[34:18] tree and God had to make no up bring the
[34:22] tree out in the ark and through the All
[34:26] the Troubles and trails and when the
[34:28] flood was over then the tree could come
[34:33] to life again okay well he just spoke
[34:36] brief and passed over that because he
[34:39] didn't want to go into commenting on all
[34:41] of that he wants to deal with his age
[34:43] his time his season that he was in right
[34:48] and he wanted that tree
[34:52] you see he brought forth that tree from
[34:55] on the death Pentecost and he brought it
[34:58] there for a purpose
[35:01] and the purpose was that it would bear
[35:04] his fruit word
[35:06] amen it would bear his fruit word the
[35:10] word then would be the fruit of that
[35:12] tree well when the tree will bear any
[35:15] fruit the fruit will be the word of God
[35:18] Amen praise the Lord hallelujah yes see
[35:22] because he wanted a church that would
[35:25] keep his word all done through them ages
[35:30] he wanted a church that would keep his
[35:34] word all down because Eve had failed him
[35:39] the Jews have failed him
[35:42] the law failed
[35:45] all of them failed so God had that tree
[35:50] that he knew would not be destroyed not
[35:55] killed would wither and would come down
[35:57] through their ages praise the name of
[36:01] the Lord hallelujah amen now uh just to
[36:05] back up here this tree of course is
[36:07] mentioned first of all Genesis 2 verse 9
[36:10] right when it talks about and there was
[36:14] a river in the Garden of Eden and from
[36:18] that River they went off other rivers
[36:21] right Rivers came from the central main
[36:24] river and there was many rivers but this
[36:27] one was planted right there the
[36:30] conjunction of Where the River become
[36:35] Rivers right and says that tree was
[36:38] there planted amen praise God hallelujah
[36:43] now we find out psalm one three it tells
[36:48] us about the tree again and we know it's
[36:51] the same tree because uh he said David
[36:54] saw this tree
[36:57] and we know that that he was not just
[36:59] talking about some natural tree that was
[37:02] planted by a natural River because the
[37:05] prophet said David saw that tree amen
[37:09] praise God hallelujah and there he saw
[37:13] the tree Again by Rivers amen hallelujah
[37:18] there was the tree planted then if
[37:22] you're to go to Revelation chapter
[37:25] 22 uh verse 2 you'll find it speaks
[37:30] again and there was a tree tempted by a
[37:34] river
[37:35] the Bible calls that tree the Tree of
[37:38] Life
[37:39] Hallelujah that was planted by the river
[37:43] actual fact here it doesn't not that
[37:46] text but listen he says now you know
[37:49] that the Tree of Life had come from God
[37:53] out of Heaven
[37:56] hallelujah amen so that was not a
[37:59] natural ordinary tree that somebody
[38:02] planted with a seed amen oh but this was
[38:06] a God's tree this was God's Tree of Life
[38:10] and God had planted the tree from Heaven
[38:14] amen and this is the tree that he said
[38:18] your father's at Manna From The Wicked
[38:22] manner in the wilderness and are all
[38:25] dead
[38:26] but this tree if you eat of it you will
[38:29] live forever
[38:31] that sounds very much like Jesus and the
[38:33] woman at the well if you eat this bread
[38:35] you'll live forever amen that was the
[38:38] tree amen if you eat the fruit off of
[38:41] this tree you'll live forever
[38:45] I wish some of the people that are into
[38:47] Health Foods would find a tree like that
[38:49] where where
[38:51] if they can eat the fruit of that tree
[38:54] they'll live forever oh my I don't even
[38:58] know if a natural tree like that was
[39:00] discovered if it would really bring life
[39:02] or death because they would start
[39:04] killing each other to become have the
[39:06] patent or the ownership of that tree and
[39:09] the selling of the leaves and this and
[39:11] that and they're gonna be a lot of
[39:12] murders and killing for it but this tree
[39:15] we are talking about is God's
[39:17] Supernatural Tree of Life
[39:20] everything about it gives life praise
[39:23] God forevermore amen now we know God
[39:28] that tree came out of God from heaven
[39:31] and was placed there in Eden
[39:35] and an angel guarded that tree
[39:39] from the Garden of Eden
[39:42] and it was kept in heathen
[39:44] and the tree of life is still now in the
[39:49] Garden of Eden of course he says here
[39:53] spiritually speaking so don't go looking
[39:56] arranging the world to find you know the
[39:59] garden somewhere to find this Magic Tree
[40:02] or some carnal people will think but
[40:05] it's a spiritual tree and it's found in
[40:08] God's Eden amen is where you'll find it
[40:11] I believe I'm I'm in that Eden right now

[41:23] if you don't have these uh fruits of the
[41:27] spirit to help to control those gifts
[41:30] then they're going to be outside of
[41:33] God's balance amen praise God power
[41:37] without control is devilish she said

[42:52] Hallelujah this tree planted spiritually
[42:56] on the day of Pentecost amen this was
[43:01] the tree that David saw long ago
[43:05] and spoke of it and wrote of it but
[43:09] notice when he wrote of it and wrote
[43:12] about these songs it was all about
[43:15] something joyful
[43:17] always something joyful when he saw this
[43:21] tree he was joyful praise God and when
[43:25] we see this tree we are joyful
[43:28] because we know there's life in the tree
[43:31] praise God hallelujah amen and this was
[43:35] a tree he says that was planted by
[43:39] Rivers
[43:41] God says is planted where by Rivers
[43:46] not body

[43:50] not by Baptists
[43:53] not by Presbyterian not by Lutheran
[43:57] hallelujah amen but planted by Rivers
[44:02] now listen he's really thinking maybe at
[44:06] that time about the Rivers of Babylon
[44:08] that's why he went right inside was
[44:11] planted by Rivers but not them Rivers
[44:15] Methodist Baptists Presbyterian and all
[44:18] these other rivers but he is planted by
[44:22] the rivers of water singular right or
[44:26] mice that's the way it is one River one
[44:31] water amen coming from that River
[44:34] Hallelujah and he shall be like a tree
[44:38] planted by the rivers of water praise
[44:43] God hallelujah then David said blessed
[44:47] is that man blessing is that man of
[44:50] course when he says blessed is that man
[44:52] he was speaking in of Jesus Christ Our
[44:56] Hallelujah
[44:57] who was the who is the Tree of Life
[45:00] he's speaking of him but he's also
[45:03] speaking of the church
[45:06] amen that would have his roots in the
[45:09] word of God
[45:10] it's also speaking of individual
[45:14] Believers if they will plant themselves
[45:18] under by faith into uh the word of God
[45:22] the rivers of Living Waters amen and
[45:27] there we said when he saw it that he
[45:30] spoke of this tree amen now remember
[45:36] this tree
[45:38] it says here he could not die hallelujah
[45:43] thank God he could not die and he leaves
[45:47] that came from home from him
[45:49] shall not wither
[45:51] no matter how much heat the devil puts
[45:53] on them
[45:55] no matter how many bugs he puts to eat
[45:57] them and Destroy them they can't wither
[46:01] because the tree to which they're from
[46:04] is getting on the water from underground
[46:08] Springs water from the river is getting
[46:11] direct water from the river Hallelujah
[46:15] and I'm glad we've made contact with the
[46:18] Divine channel of Grace where our souls
[46:21] can be watered by the word of God
[46:23] hallelujah amen praise God forever amen
[46:28] no matter what they do to it they will
[46:34] never be able to kill that tree they
[46:36] cannot kill the tree amen because it's
[46:40] where the tree is planted
[46:42] hallelujah it's where the tree is
[46:45] Blended it's where he is splinted why
[46:49] he's planted by the rivers of water and
[46:52] that's why David is saying his roots
[46:56] cannot die
[46:58] now his thoughts are moving now right
[47:01] he's coming now now and he's saying it's
[47:03] because of the roots of the tree it's in
[47:07] the river and getting water well you
[47:10] know that's the way tree is feed
[47:12] themselves is by extracting whatever
[47:14] they need from the soil that is around
[47:17] them and if there's a pond or a pool
[47:19] you'll find a lot of roots because all
[47:22] the trees are trying to get their Roots
[47:24] over to that pool to get to uh the Water
[47:27] there amen oh my you might see no so he
[47:34] goes on he says you know when I was a
[47:36] boy
[47:38] there was a great big tree big old tree
[47:42] sitting there and the wind would blow
[47:45] and every time the wind would blow I
[47:48] would think it would blow down that tree
[47:50] but instead the tree kept standing up
[47:53] there but you said he said year after
[47:56] year the tree was still there why was
[47:58] that he said because
[48:01] it would it would just loosen up the
[48:05] roots of that tree by rocking that tree
[48:08] back and forth loosen up the roots and
[48:12] that caused that tree to dig down even
[48:16] deeper
[48:17] Hallelujah with its roots so it can get
[48:20] a better hold
[48:21] oh so is it with the Christian mockery
[48:26] comes laughter comes making fun of you
[48:31] as a Christian comes what it does what
[48:34] does that do to you persecution will
[48:37] come and it may even Shake Christian to
[48:41] make them pray more
[48:43] shake them to make them dig down more
[48:48] them to get a better hold so they can
[48:52] stand the storms of life praise God I'm
[48:55] so glad that our God does that no wonder
[48:58] he said quoted all joy when you go
[49:02] through the fiery trials count it all
[49:04] joy when you are tested and you're tried
[49:07] praise God because the trying of your
[49:10] faith worketh patience and when you
[49:13] think you are weak that's when you're
[49:16] even becoming strong and stronger for
[49:18] his glory and honor just about the time
[49:21] when you think Lord this is enough I'm
[49:24] ready to give up I'm ready to give up
[49:26] but the Bible said we are not tempted
[49:28] with any Temptation that he knows that
[49:32] we can't bear Amen in other words God
[49:35] will tempt you but temp the word tempt
[49:38] is used there but it's really test
[49:40] right to your breaking point and just
[49:45] when you're a little limit about to
[49:47] break then he relaxes him amen praise
[49:51] God and he knows exactly you
[49:54] you will say oh I can't take it I can't
[49:57] but God knows how much you can bear is
[50:00] that right praise the name of the Lord
[50:02] aren't we glad we have a lord like that
[50:05] that knows everything is in our hearts
[50:08] amen he says that's the way it is amen
[50:12] oh my see planted by the rivers of water
[50:16] David saw him
[50:19] and when he saw him praise God now he's
[50:23] talking about the tree but the tree is
[50:25] now a man and he's saying when he saw
[50:27] him he was planted but there this tree
[50:32] and by the river and he could not die
[50:36] thank God the devil could not kill Jesus
[50:39] take God he says because I live you as
[50:43] the leaves on this tree you will live
[50:45] also I am the vine you are the branches
[50:49] if it were not so I would have told you
[50:51] praise God and because of him we live
[50:54] today we Rejoice today we praise God
[50:57] today attack blessed are your eyes my
[51:01] eyes my heart that we see these things
[51:04] many many like he said long to see these
[51:08] things from the days of the prophets now
[51:10] and now you are seeing these things
[51:12] blessed are your eyes that you're able
[51:14] to see these things to the glory of God
[51:17] hallelujah amen praise God hallelujah
[51:21] notice notice he now he could not die
[51:26] but why is it empty the tree could not
[51:30] die
[51:31] because his roots was in the river
[51:35] listen now we know he had life in that
[51:41] that roots life was in them groups no
[51:45] where is the roots or where is the life
[51:48] of the tree it's always in The Roots now
[51:52] we're talking now we come down we are
[51:54] living in a country like this where we
[51:56] can talk about winter and we know that
[51:58] winter comes all the life that was in
[52:02] the tree start dreaming and growing down
[52:05] into the roots and why is it going into
[52:08] the Earth because it's going to protect
[52:10] them that sells until the winter is
[52:13] passed until all the storms of winter is
[52:16] past it's going to hide Me Oh My Savior
[52:19] hide till the storms of life are passed
[52:22] we hide in the roots of the tree and he
[52:25] is the root and offspring of David root
[52:29] and Branch praise God and we give glory
[52:31] to his great name amen all right see the
[52:35] life stays in the roots amen his roots
[52:40] had life in them to brings forth fruit
[52:44] in his season when he wants fruits to
[52:49] come forth when he wants Life to Come
[52:51] forward and I just pay attention to the
[52:54] word season it's really talking about
[52:55] what age is the age is that's what he's
[52:58] talking about the ages he knows when
[53:01] when one age is going to end and there's
[53:04] going to be a gap there and then it's
[53:06] time for fruits to come forward and then
[53:08] he'll bring forth some more fruits amen
[53:10] so he brings forth fruit in his season
[53:14] not in our season man season oh well we
[53:20] need to do get a program here brother
[53:22] because we need to have hundreds more of
[53:25] membership
[53:26] so let's plan a program of how to
[53:28] attract the people to come you see
[53:31] that's good and you could do that
[53:33] but that's man
[53:35] but God has his own plan
[53:37] he has his own way
[53:39] how to bring forth fruit in his season
[53:41] not in our season amen oh my now before
[53:47] I go on to that he says here this is a
[53:51] tree that will not cast its fruit
[53:55] fruit comes on that tree and that fruit
[53:58] will not be cast off or put away and
[54:03] that's because the tree is always at the
[54:08] river in the river it's root in those
[54:11] Waters of the river but watch another
[54:15] tree that gets away from that River gets
[54:18] away from that water amen it will just
[54:22] bear nothing but naughty worm eaten
[54:25] fruit and it will begin to drop on the
[54:28] ground and cast its crop amen you've
[54:32] seen that we've seen all these crab
[54:34] apples and all kinds of fruits where the
[54:36] tree becomes so withered and everything
[54:39] else and that's what's the matter with
[54:41] art with the Church of the day do you
[54:44] believe it
[54:45] they've gone away from the rivers of
[54:48] God's word they've gone away from the
[54:51] revelation of the word of God hallelujah
[54:55] amen and them spiritual things of God
[54:58] and so they're casting their fruits he
[55:01] said what do I mean cast their fruits
[55:03] their their Believers live like the
[55:07] world
[55:08] they act like the world they're still
[55:11] cheat and lie like the world they smoke
[55:15] they drink they gamble like the world
[55:18] they have parties even in the church to
[55:22] pay to be able to raise money to pay the
[55:26] preacher Lord have mercy they even have
[55:29] all manner soup suppers the race monies
[55:33] dances and everything else you see
[55:36] what's happening they have cast their
[55:38] fruit that's what it means by they cast
[55:41] their fruit they cast their fruit
[55:44] they're just like the world and the
[55:46] unbeliever and they look that way and
[55:50] they and the unbeliever even says there
[55:53] is no difference
[55:55] in them people
[55:57] and me so what's the use amen he puts it
[56:01] this way those are my words there is no
[56:04] difference in that person
[56:07] and me praise God
[56:10] and he says that's what caused communism
[56:13] to rise up
[56:15] in Russia
[56:17] you know
[56:18] there was an old European gentleman my
[56:22] wife and I
[56:23] well his name is Stan Lee
[56:26] and
[56:28] we just were taking care of him
[56:32] it's one of those cases where
[56:35] um
[56:36] he had a bit of money but we were just
[56:38] taking care of it
[56:39] and
[56:41] um
[56:42] of course he wanted to give us all his
[56:44] stuff and we said no no no no no no we
[56:47] are not doing it for that right uh we're
[56:50] just doing it because of the grace of
[56:52] God in our hearts and he just broke down
[56:55] and started to cry
[56:57] and since I you know
[57:00] I am I'm an atheist I don't believe in
[57:02] God
[57:03] and he says and the reason why I can
[57:05] tell you the Day and The Time
[57:07] uh when uh my father was killed in the
[57:11] war and I was just a young man and just
[57:17] my mother and I and other siblings
[57:21] and we just had a plot of land and a
[57:24] garden with some things that we were
[57:26] just growing to be able to eat and the
[57:30] priest came
[57:32] and the priest demanded it all
[57:36] took it all and took the land and threw
[57:40] us out of there and watched this mother
[57:42] mistreated and died
[57:45] right he said when I saw all the things
[57:48] that the church was doing that
[57:52] absolutely turned me away to thinking
[57:55] there can't be a God and these can't be
[57:58] as Representatives right well I'm saying
[58:02] that in that light brother Branham said
[58:04] that is the reason for the rise of
[58:07] communism
[58:09] in other words the hypocritical living
[58:13] or life uh by people that were claiming
[58:17] to be Christians is what caused
[58:20] communism to rise up he said it rose up
[58:24] there and that's what happened and
[58:27] anywhere that is that happens that's
[58:29] what happens see down there they burnt
[58:33] up the Catholic Church there in Russia
[58:35] when they saw that and again down in
[58:40] Mexico when they come across them lying
[58:42] Pips and places where they burnt babies
[58:45] and and none having nuns having these
[58:50] babies and finding human bodies and
[58:53] full-grown human bodies laying in them
[58:56] lying pets what do they do you see they
[59:00] have cast their crop amen they've gotten
[59:04] away from the word of God and God just
[59:07] shook them off the tree amen they're not
[59:10] on God's tree hallelujah amen we know
[59:13] right here in Canada that this is he's
[59:15] speaking from way back when he was alive
[59:18] but right now you know that uh up north
[59:22] what note there and all these different
[59:24] places that the church and churches are
[59:28] still doing these very same things amen
[59:31] oh there are many things that will tell
[59:33] you not just of the Catholic Church the
[59:35] southern baptist conference convention
[59:37] down there in the South and all of the
[59:40] things that have taken place there and
[59:42] many of the other organizations but it's
[59:45] this hypocritical living
[59:48] that crossed the rise of communism
[59:52] and it's this hypocritical living Even
[59:55] in our time that is causing the rise of
[59:58] an evil monster we know fascism give way
[1:00:03] socialism give with fascism to socialism
[1:00:06] socialism to Communism and so on until
[1:00:09] we come right down capitalism and we
[1:00:12] come right down to this time what that
[1:00:14] monster that's going to merge into I do
[1:00:17] not know but we are living in a time
[1:00:19] when that cycle is just about to repeat
[1:00:22] again amen the hypocrisy is at such a
[1:00:26] height when these things are supposed to
[1:00:28] take place again amen notice in the
[1:00:33] midst of all that
[1:00:35] this man
[1:00:37] is planted
[1:00:40] by the river
[1:00:43] and I just put some red ink around this
[1:00:47] where he said he is not stuck in by the
[1:00:50] river
[1:00:52] he's not going to go into that but what
[1:00:54] he's talking about somebody you want to
[1:00:56] transplant something or or confuse
[1:00:59] something they're going to stick a root
[1:01:01] or something by the river no no he says
[1:01:04] this man is not just stuck in there he
[1:01:07] has planted God deliberately planted him
[1:01:11] by the river amen so this is a tree that
[1:01:15] God planted by the rivers of water and
[1:01:19] he shall bring forth fruit in his God
[1:01:24] season
[1:01:25] this man is going to bear fruit in God's
[1:01:27] season because God planted him there
[1:01:30] Hallelujah now let's read psalms one
[1:01:34] let's do that because that's what he's
[1:01:36] saying here
[1:01:37] blessed is oh well he's quoting from
[1:01:41] memory blessings is the man that sit at
[1:01:43] not in the seat of the scornful
[1:01:46] nor stands in the way of sinners
[1:01:49] he shall be like a tree that's planted
[1:01:52] by the rivers of waters
[1:01:55] he shall bring forth his fruit in his
[1:01:58] season
[1:01:59] and whatsoever it went shall prosper the
[1:02:03] ungodly is not so amen and why because
[1:02:09] he will not stand with him the ungodly
[1:02:12] in judgment amen praise God but with the
[1:02:16] righteous with The Godly he will stand
[1:02:19] with us amen praise God and one day he
[1:02:22] said if you stand with him he'll stand
[1:02:24] with you stand by the Bible is the Bible
[1:02:26] the word will stand with you praise God
[1:02:28] hallelujah o praise God now notice thank
[1:02:33] God also has ordained Messengers to each
[1:02:37] age and that messenger is ordained to
[1:02:42] come and bring forth the fruits from
[1:02:46] God's tree bring them forth in the
[1:02:50] season Hallelujah don't you believe you
[1:02:52] are the fruits of brother Brandon's
[1:02:54] Ministry
[1:02:55] don't you see what you're talking about
[1:02:58] there fruits of the messengers message
[1:03:01] bring forth the fruits in this season
[1:03:04] the season here that God placed him
[1:03:08] praise God so you see he will bring
[1:03:11] forth his fruit in a season and then
[1:03:14] fruits it cannot wiggle because them
[1:03:18] them are predestinated fruits
[1:03:22] predestinated fruits you can't destroy
[1:03:25] those fruits
[1:03:27] Hallelujah because that's predestinated
[1:03:31] Lord of God hallelujah Ephesians 5 says
[1:03:35] we are now sitting in Heavenly places in
[1:03:38] Christ Jesus
[1:03:39] hallelujah praise God now again breaking
[1:03:44] into his thinking the fruit is hanging
[1:03:46] on the tree so he says we are seated in
[1:03:48] Heavenly places in Jesus Christ amen
[1:03:51] hallelujah oh don't you see what
[1:03:54] happened God by his foreign knowledge
[1:03:58] predestinated us unto adoption of the
[1:04:04] children of God by Jesus Christ
[1:04:07] Hallelujah this is the predestinated
[1:04:10] fruits that are supposed to come from
[1:04:12] the tree oh my by his foreknowledge he
[1:04:17] predestinated everything that would
[1:04:19] happen right down the road and all that
[1:04:23] was done by his foreknowledge because he
[1:04:27] forsy it he could predestinated amen
[1:04:31] right because he can tell from beginning
[1:04:33] to end so therefore the predestinated
[1:04:38] fruit was already in the root of that
[1:04:42] tree thank God we were in the root
[1:04:46] thank God we were in the root of David
[1:04:48] and the branch of David thank God he is
[1:04:52] divine we are the branches Hallelujah
[1:04:54] I'm so glad that we are the root praise
[1:04:57] God and now is our season to Bear him
[1:05:00] fruit I'm not going to watch Poetic here
[1:05:03] but the fact is this is our season to
[1:05:06] Bear some fruit so that when he said
[1:05:09] when the son of man comes again son of
[1:05:12] man comes against will he find fruit
[1:05:15] amen you remember the Fig Tree if you
[1:05:18] read that that's exactly what he said
[1:05:19] when he comes again the son of man come
[1:05:22] will he find fruit may God find fruit
[1:05:25] bearing lies upon this Earth that
[1:05:28] believes this war and stays with the
[1:05:30] word and will not move to the right nor
[1:05:33] to the left amen praise God hallelujah
[1:05:38] amen yes sir I'm so glad because it's
[1:05:42] predestinated
[1:05:44] predestinated now notice carefully see
[1:05:48] not only David saw it but Joel saw the
[1:05:54] tree and spoke of it but he spoke of it
[1:05:57] when it was at down he saw it when it
[1:06:00] was at down amen praise God and worms
[1:06:05] begin to Egypt he saw all that but the
[1:06:09] tree could not die amen hallelujah it's
[1:06:13] brute because the life is in the root
[1:06:18] amen hallelujah and in the root there
[1:06:22] was predestinated truth
[1:06:25] praise the Lord that's not me that's him
[1:06:28] speaking here he says here now you see
[1:06:31] if the life was in the root for in the
[1:06:35] root he had predestinated truth
[1:06:39] it had God's word what's the
[1:06:42] predestination truth the word the
[1:06:45] revelation of the word
[1:06:46] was there to come in the season oh
[1:06:50] praise God for predestinated people
[1:06:53] praise the Lord hallelujah amen and
[1:06:56] that's the way this tree is who praise
[1:06:59] God hallelujah now we know the New Birth
[1:07:04] come by Christ and we cannot die with
[1:07:07] that birth Hallelujah you come from the
[1:07:09] tree how are you gonna die
[1:07:11] you're from the tree and the tree has to
[1:07:14] root in the water now you you just
[1:07:16] quickly you understand that he's talking
[1:07:18] about that our origin is way back in the
[1:07:21] mind of God and the root of the tree and
[1:07:24] everything else you you can go ahead
[1:07:26] with that and it comes right down praise
[1:07:29] God hallelujah they are now discovering
[1:07:32] that they can grow trees and they
[1:07:35] actually grow better when the tree is
[1:07:37] upside down
[1:07:39] you've seen them and it's bearing even
[1:07:42] more Tomatoes when they find how to put
[1:07:46] them upside down and the thing is
[1:07:48] bearing all kinds of tomatoes oh my just
[1:07:52] think of it and this tree is a tree that
[1:07:55] has its root not in the earth not in
[1:07:57] ground but the tree has the roots up in
[1:08:00] the mind of God he said the tree comes
[1:08:03] from Heaven
[1:08:04] it's a different kind of a tree praise
[1:08:07] God it's an eternal tree it's a tree
[1:08:10] that's bearing branches that can't die
[1:08:13] fruit that can't wither can't die leaves
[1:08:16] that can't wither hallelujah amen praise
[1:08:20] God and Joel saw that tree
[1:08:23] hallelujah oh see how it is you can take
[1:08:27] that tree and it can be persecuted it
[1:08:31] can be made fun of and it has been made
[1:08:35] fun of since the Garden of Eden until
[1:08:38] this time but it cannot die amen it's
[1:08:42] predestinated they've clogged that it
[1:08:45] and the tree still lives they beat the
[1:08:48] tree and the tree is still alive might
[1:08:51] have done everything to it and it still
[1:08:54] lives what happened it cannot die he
[1:08:58] will not die amen he can't because he's
[1:09:02] holding in him the predestinated word
[1:09:06] oh praise God why would you know when
[1:09:08] you read it Forward he's he's thinking
[1:09:10] and talking about Jesus Christ how he
[1:09:13] can't die and how you know he's always
[1:09:15] resurrected then his mind switches to
[1:09:17] the believer now he cannot die for he
[1:09:21] has the predestinated word in him
[1:09:24] Hallelujah and we cannot die because we
[1:09:27] have the predestinated word in Us Praise
[1:09:31] the Lord oh my praise God how do you
[1:09:34] know that you know when I said that
[1:09:36] that's how
[1:09:37] that's the evil one though he said how
[1:09:39] do you know that because I believe it
[1:09:42] now and even when you close your eyes
[1:09:44] and if you slip away and gone with the
[1:09:46] Lord you don't know anything but you are
[1:09:49] believing the word now so you don't have
[1:09:51] to worry about that then amen amen
[1:09:54] everybody can say whatever they want but
[1:09:57] we're going into the presence of
[1:09:58] almighty God hallelujah amen you see he
[1:10:02] cannot die and I'm going to start
[1:10:04] winding this up because he's holding in
[1:10:07] him the predestinated word of God and it
[1:10:13] has to come forth for
[1:10:15] for his fruit is in his own season
[1:10:20] in his predestinated season and we are
[1:10:25] in our predestinated seed season and the
[1:10:29] fruit must come forth for he said it's
[1:10:32] in its season praise God I believe we
[1:10:35] caught the word in our season we cut the
[1:10:38] word at the right time they'll know when
[1:10:40] it is time for them to know praise God
[1:10:43] and I believe this is the time when we
[1:10:45] have come to know the revelation of this
[1:10:48] word of the Living God you see Joel saw
[1:10:51] that
[1:10:54] they saw every one of them when they
[1:10:58] began to eat it down to the bottom but
[1:11:01] God already spoke and said I will
[1:11:05] restore saith the Lord in other words
[1:11:08] you can't kill the tree no matter what
[1:11:10] state it look or how you eat it down I
[1:11:12] will restore you break off a branch and
[1:11:15] think you're gonna kill it that way I
[1:11:17] will restore you try to chop it down
[1:11:20] here it will come up again I will
[1:11:23] restore have you ever seen uh in our old
[1:11:26] yard we had tree like that where we cut
[1:11:30] it down right to the roots we say it's

[1:11:35] it's out of the way and a year passed
[1:11:38] maybe a year and a half next you know
