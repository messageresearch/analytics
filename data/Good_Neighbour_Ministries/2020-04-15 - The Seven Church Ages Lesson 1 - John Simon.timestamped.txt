[0:00] [Music]
[0:14] goodnight folks
[0:16] I beloved brethren it's wonderful to be
[0:21] together again we live in a marvelous
[0:24] time much is happening and then you are
[0:29] there Here I am we're just in our homes
[0:34] by ourselves we're passing through the
[0:38] wilderness and it's a testing time a
[0:42] time when God tests us after our
[0:46] faithfulness to him and his word as of
[0:52] tonight I will begin this study on the
[0:59] seven churches I will begin tonight
[1:07] starting on page 12 of the church age
[1:13] book you may find that while I'm yet
[1:16] making my comments now
[1:21] next this coming Sunday I will speak on
[1:26] the second part of the Spirit quickens
[1:30] the word actually the Spirit quickens
[1:34] the word to the elect of the age in
[1:38] which we are living in so that will be
[1:43] the approach on Sunday morning but for
[1:49] tonight's lesson let us pray and read
[1:56] out of the book of Revelation chapter 1
[2:01] verses 1 to 3 Lord Jesus we thank you
[2:09] for another day you have kept your
[2:13] people thus far safe covered by the
[2:16] blood protected by your love mercy and
[2:20] grace take all the praise all it honor
[2:25] and the glory father we give all that we
[2:29] are and all that we have
[2:31] we surrender it to you Father
[2:35] forgive us of our sins cleanse us by the
[2:39] precious blood and make us fit for
[2:43] service both hearers and speaker and in
[2:48] all of this father may you be glorified
[2:51] we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:55] give us the understanding of the word as
[2:59] we read it Lord in Jesus name Amen and
[3:03] amen
[3:04] no the revelation of Jesus Christ which
[3:11] God gave unto him to show unto his
[3:16] servants things which must shortly come
[3:21] to pass and he sent and signified it by
[3:28] his angel unto his servant John who bare
[3:34] record of the word of God and of the
[3:38] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[3:43] things that he saw blessed is he that
[3:47] readeth and they that hear the words of
[3:51] this prophecy and keep those things
[3:54] which are written therein for the time
[3:59] is at hand blessed be the name of the
[4:03] Lord thank you Jesus
[4:07] now let us commence we understand
[4:12] looking into the seven churches page 12
[4:16] beginning from page 12 that the scribe
[4:19] not the author of this book is st. John
[4:25] the Divine that is clear who is the
[4:31] scribe John is the scribe
[4:34] he is not the author now bring that to
[4:39] heart
[4:39] in our thing we have received a
[4:42] revelation by the Word of God and we
[4:48] understand that this crane not the
[4:51] author this speaker of the spoken word
[4:56] not the author is brother William Marion
[5:00] Branham God used him to be the scribe
[5:06] pick up your pen and write God use him
[5:09] to be the speaker to voice that he might
[5:13] use him and the Spirit of God might
[5:17] speak through the Prophet to bring the
[5:20] Word of God to our age that we might
[5:24] know these things for God's glory now
[5:30] for the writing of this book he was
[5:32] placed on the Isle of Patmos I will not
[5:36] make any commentary on that now but we
[5:40] understand that this of course is not
[5:44] John's life story the book of Revelation
[5:51] is not the ruminations of a sick man
[6:00] this book of Revelation is not the
[6:07] hallucinations of a man suffering from
[6:13] colic because of over eating this book
[6:21] of Revelation is a book where while we
[6:27] were yet studying it the Bible says
[6:29] you're already blessed just to read it
[6:32] and blessed is he that understand it
[6:36] it's a marvelous and wonderful book now
[6:42] the third thing is that this book of
[6:45] Revelation is not the biography of John
[6:50] the Revelator
[6:56] it is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[7:01] himself
[7:03] his works all his plans and the things
[7:10] that would come to pass in the future
[7:15] ages of John's time of course referring
[7:19] to our time and the times that are yet
[7:24] to unfold like the rapture the
[7:30] tribulation the hundred and forty-four
[7:33] thousand the the Third Temple the the
[7:39] restoration of the red heifer the
[7:43] sacrifice of atonement all these things
[7:47] are they Armageddon and so on all those
[7:50] things are written and in this book so
[7:54] blessed is he that readeth and
[7:58] understand it what is in the book even
[8:01] if a person reads this book with no
[8:03] understanding they're still blessed and
[8:06] then if they have an understanding
[8:08] they're even more blessed so it is very
[8:12] important that we read this book and
[8:17] understand it by the precious Holy
[8:20] Spirit now this book of Revelation is a
[8:23] book of prophecy let us understand that
[8:27] clearly that it is a book of prophecy
[8:32] let me cook now the book is usually
[8:37] termed a revelation of st. John but that
[8:41] is incorrect it is the revelation of
[8:44] Jesus Christ given to John for
[8:47] Christians of all ages who wasn't given
[8:51] for for Christians of all ages which
[8:55] means this book is meant for you just
[8:59] look book is meant for us we should
[9:02] receive it in our hearts
[9:04] where
[9:05] great delight in this day and in this
[9:08] out now it's the last book in our Bible
[9:14] it's the last book in our Bible
[9:16] but yet it tells the beginning and the
[9:20] ending of the entire gospel the
[9:25] dispensations of the gospel right from
[9:29] Genesis right through the various ages
[9:32] of the patriarchal age in the age of law
[9:36] and the age of plants and the age of
[9:41] prophecy right on them it comes right to
[9:44] us in listening and in this time where
[9:48] we break into the seven ages of the
[9:53] Church of the Gentile the dispensation
[9:57] now the this word revelation in the
[10:02] Greek is apocalypsis
[10:04] in other words an apocalypse which is to
[10:07] say an unveiling and uncovering
[10:13] revealing something that was previously
[10:16] hidden it's uncovering the revelation of
[10:22] the person of Jesus Christ and how his
[10:26] future works in the oncoming 7 Church
[10:31] ages at that time today we are standing
[10:36] physically in the last church age so
[10:40] John looked from the eye of Patmos
[10:44] under the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[10:47] and saw through the ages and years of
[10:53] time he saw this age and right to the
[10:59] end
[10:59] and beyond our age John even saw the
[11:04] things that were going to be and all of
[11:08] the future works that were going to come
[11:12] John saw it all
[11:14] now notice carefully let me give you a
[11:17] quotation
[11:18] from brother branham and it's this the
[11:21] sign of the answer page 62 what uh a
[11:27] mystery he's speaking about a mystery
[11:29] and I'd like to say it what is a
[11:33] revelation a revelation is a mysteries
[11:38] scripture or previously hidden truth now
[11:44] divinely revealed which is a
[11:48] supernatural element still remains
[11:53] despite the revelation
[11:56] praise be to God hallelujah no we see
[12:01] friends that some truths that was hidden
[12:05] now revealed in our wonderful time
[12:10] thanks God hallelujah so here we see
[12:15] clearly in the Word of God the
[12:19] importance of Revelation to the true
[12:22] believer it cannot be over emphasized
[12:27] and revelation means more to us than we
[12:32] have realized
[12:33] prior to this prophet coming and making
[12:37] it clear to us so I'm not he said I'm
[12:42] not talking about the book of Revelation
[12:44] I'm talking about all revelation it's
[12:49] tremendously important to the church see
[12:54] oh oh you must realize that revelation
[12:59] is the key to understanding the entire
[13:02] Bible no wonder he said I all the key of
[13:06] David I shut and no man opens I open and
[13:11] no man can shut it let me repeat the
[13:16] principle and truth of Revelation is the
[13:22] foundation for the understanding of the
[13:26] entire Bible now when Jesus
[13:31] here he said who do you say
[13:34] ina son of man and who do you say him
[13:37] and one they gave the opinions of men
[13:42] rather than their by the spirit of
[13:46] Revelation going into the Word of God
[13:49] catching the application bringing it
[13:53] back and saying oh you are the seed of
[13:57] the woman or you were the ram caught in
[14:01] the thicket tomorrow or to catch the
[14:04] relation or you are buaas here I can see
[14:08] you pictured in in such-and-such you see
[14:12] but they went by the opinions of men
[14:16] they said some say as we will say in our
[14:20] time the people say some say that you
[14:24] are Isaiah the prophet and others say
[14:33] you are Jeremias or one of the prophets
[14:37] and he says that's good people's
[14:41] opinions anyone can give their opinions
[14:44] about this Bible about this Word of God
[14:46] what they think and you can have schools
[14:50] that were founded on the basis of
[14:53] trained to investigate penetrate and
[14:56] interpret what this Bible is all about
[15:00] whom do you but he asked the question
[15:03] not men's opinions from their colleges
[15:05] from the seminaries from the
[15:07] universities from their higher
[15:10] institutions of learning or from the
[15:13] rabbis or or whatever not who people say
[15:17] I am he says but who do you you
[15:21] personally say that I am right
[15:24] so Revelation is a personal thing God
[15:28] dealing with individual God loves to
[15:32] deal with us as individual and when we
[15:37] come together each with his individual
[15:40] revelation in union and in
[15:43] harmony then it's the restoration of his
[15:47] wonderful body and all of the Godhead
[15:52] brought back into unity for his glory
[15:56] amen
[15:57] so here he says but whom say ye that I
[16:02] am then rose up rough fisherman Peter
[16:09] and he says thou art the Christ the Son
[16:15] of the Living God and jesus answered and
[16:18] said unto him blessed art thou simon
[16:21] barjona for flesh and blood has not
[16:25] revealed it unto you but my father which
[16:29] is in heaven has revealed this honor you
[16:32] thou art Peter and upon this rock I will
[16:37] build my church and the gates of Hell
[16:40] will not prevail against it oh praise
[16:45] God for evermore you see these disciples
[16:49] were influenced by the opinions of men
[16:53] we should not be influenced by the
[16:58] opinions of men are coming out of their
[17:00] colleges their Bible schools keep your
[17:04] eyes upon the world keep your eyes on
[17:06] Jesus and ask God for wisdom for
[17:09] understanding and for revelation if
[17:13] there is something in the Word of God
[17:15] you do not understand something in the
[17:19] message that's not clear to you go to
[17:22] God and prayer and ask God to open up
[17:26] the word which is himself to reveal
[17:29] himself to reveal his word to you that
[17:32] you might know him in the power of his
[17:36] resurrection see no we understand just
[17:40] as it was back there when the question
[17:45] was asked who who do men say I am and
[17:49] they said well some say you Jeremiah
[17:51] some say you're Isaiah
[17:54] No right down through history and even
[17:57] in our day the Roman Catholics say that
[18:01] the church is built upon Peter now we
[18:06] know that's a carnal interpretation and
[18:09] that God could not build his church on
[18:14] sinking sand he could not build this
[18:17] church in words to say on an unstable
[18:22] man at that time before his conversion
[18:26] he could not be the foundation of God's
[18:30] church so Jesus was not telling them to
[18:36] that his church would be built upon
[18:38] Peter
[18:39] then came the protesters and they said
[18:43] we are sure the church is built on Jesus
[18:46] now watch the Roman Catholics say that
[18:51] is built on Peter of course that's a
[18:53] false opinion that is a false
[18:57] proposition and that is false teaching
[19:01] contrary to the Word of God
[19:04] now the Protestants come along and this
[19:07] is history repeating itself and the
[19:10] Protestant opinion proposition and
[19:14] teaching is that the church is built on
[19:17] Jesus but Jesus himself was just the
[19:21] body that God dwelt in and you see so
[19:26] we're not going to discuss that
[19:28] particularly here now but many today the
[19:32] point is that many today are going by
[19:36] the opinions of man and many don't know
[19:40] it thank God for those whose eyes are
[19:44] open and can recognize it in our day now
[19:48] we understand friends that he says that
[19:53] gates of hell shall not prevail against
[19:56] the church and I've taught on this
[19:59] before but you understand there right
[20:03] there we understand we have a marvelous
[20:06] wonderful promise from this we recognize
[20:10] his prophecy Satan will come against the
[20:14] church Satan will attack the church
[20:16] Satan will do everything to destroy the
[20:19] church Satan will do everything to
[20:21] overcome the church and overcome the
[20:24] entire believer but jesus said that
[20:27] gates of Hell shall not prevail against
[20:31] the church he will try to prevail
[20:34] against the church by by bringing sin to
[20:38] bear you in a dream of sin he will come
[20:41] against the church by Brandon gates of
[20:44] Hell denominationalism opening up their
[20:48] gates to receive you and there you'll
[20:51] find your way into hell see now we
[20:55] understand that he will try to overcome
[20:58] the true church but this promise we must
[21:01] hold to it it it shall not prevail
[21:05] against us
[21:06] because we are more than conquerors
[21:08] through him that loved us with with him
[21:12] with our sight with him in the inside of
[21:15] us we are more than conquerors through
[21:18] him that loved the strength God
[21:21] hallelujah so they're taking men's
[21:24] opinions rather than reading their own
[21:27] Bible and receiving the revelation of
[21:32] God's Word now clearly Jesus said to
[21:37] Peter he says now this it was by
[21:41] revelation read it the way it is written
[21:44] flesh and blood has not revealed it but
[21:49] my father in heaven has revealed it and
[21:53] upon this rock what rock the rock of
[21:57] Revelation the rock of day of the very
[22:01] truth and principle scriptural principle
[22:06] of Revelation is what the church will is
[22:11] built on that's once melt on it's built
[22:14] on the same
[22:16] Oh God hallelujah no what does the Bible
[22:20] say the foundation of the true church is
[22:23] to be we know the true church is built
[22:26] on the truth and scriptural principle of
[22:31] Revelation take your stand right there
[22:34] that every word of God in this Bible
[22:40] must be revealed to you it's not to be
[22:44] read like a novelist not to be read like
[22:47] a a biography it's not to be read like
[22:49] old history or a book of poetry or a
[22:53] higher learning of literature any of
[22:58] those things but the Bible must be read
[23:02] prayerfully sincerely humbly reverently
[23:06] while asking God for wisdom and
[23:09] revelation for he alone can give you the
[23:14] understanding now the prophet of God
[23:20] speaking
[23:23] how did ml know what to do in order to
[23:29] offer a proper sacrifice to God Hebrews
[23:35] chapter 11 verses 1 to 3 you'll find
[23:39] there by faith by revelation we
[23:41] understand that the worlds were framed
[23:43] by the Word of God and then it goes on
[23:47] to say by faith Abel offered a more
[23:50] excellent sacrifice than Cain see why
[23:55] now the question has been asked how did
[23:58] he offer a more excellent sacrifice why
[24:02] was a sacrifice for excellent let us
[24:06] recognize that there was no written bite
[24:10] at that time there wasn't let me repeat
[24:14] there was no written Bible at that time
[24:17] so how did people know exactly what to
[24:24] offer to God it means that there was a
[24:28] spiritual communication
[24:30] between God and emails heart and God
[24:36] spoke right into the heart of a bell and
[24:40] revealed made known to him that what he
[24:47] desired was a land and that lamb of
[24:53] course was a bell was given the
[24:57] understanding that there was a our
[25:00] Redeemer with a lamb light nature that
[25:04] was to come so by revelation evil
[25:10] offered a better sacrifice to God see no
[25:16] it's the revelation of God that made the
[25:20] difference in his offering Cain made an
[25:23] offering to but he had no understanding
[25:26] of what he was supposed to offer he was
[25:31] blind to the understanding of the holy
[25:35] spirit he had no connection he had no
[25:38] real communication he had no no sonship
[25:44] see so anyway the Holy Spirit spoke and
[25:49] revealed to Abel what it was so if I did
[25:53] not have to guess he did not have to go
[25:57] to a school of learning to to presume
[26:02] and to try to penetrate the deep things
[26:05] of God by human skill and by human
[26:08] knowledge by by research and comparing
[26:12] Scripture with Scripture which it's all
[26:14] good but revelation comes like a flash
[26:19] of light from the presence of Almighty
[26:21] God knowledge that was previously hidden
[26:25] not sense knowledge not knowledge that
[26:29] can be accumulated by the five senses
[26:33] but revelation knowledge knowledge that
[26:37] comes from God alone with
[26:41] that comes from above and fills the
[26:44] human heart and makes things clear for
[26:48] this day thanks Peter God for his
[26:50] marvelous and wonderful grace see no he
[26:55] says Lord clearly here Abel offered a
[27:00] better sacrifice and gave that made the
[27:06] difference and God gave evil eternal
[27:11] life this year salvation is my
[27:15] revelation salvation is by revelation no
[27:23] matter the seminary teacher the pastor
[27:26] teaches you God reveals to you that
[27:28] Jesus Christ that Jesus is the Christ
[27:32] that is the blood that cleanses you and
[27:35] God is your Savior you will never have
[27:39] eternal life it's the spiritual
[27:42] revelation that doesn't in other words
[27:44] it's the spiritual revelation that gives
[27:47] you genuine salvation the revelation of
[27:51] Jesus Christ who is the word of God in
[27:53] the beginning was the word the Word was
[27:55] with God and the Word was made flesh the
[27:58] spiritual revelation of him Jesus Christ
[28:02] not just Jesus but Jesus Christ revealed
[28:06] and make clear to you is what gives you
[28:09] salvation hallelujah now the disciples
[28:15] asked Jesus in the book of Acts Lord who
[28:18] at this time going to restore the
[28:21] kingdom to Israel see they were taking
[28:24] of an earthly Kingdom they have no
[28:26] understanding or revelation yet that his
[28:29] kingdom was not yet of this world and to
[28:33] a great degree we understand that even
[28:37] Jesus could not give them a clear
[28:40] revelation on that because before his
[28:45] revelation he says I don't know what the
[28:47] father I
[28:49] in this mind concerning these things but
[28:52] after his resurrection he rose up and he
[28:58] it was able to tell them clearly about
[29:01] his ministry his mandatory of ministry
[29:04] oh and the Word of God glory fight now
[29:09] the glorified Word of God kid could now
[29:12] make itself clear to these various
[29:16] apostles quotation now the father had
[29:21] not yet revealed it to him but now after
[29:25] his death and resurrection at this
[29:28] particular time in this editorial
[29:30] ministry he is able to set forth here in
[29:34] this revelation of himself and to John
[29:39] what his glory and presence in the
[29:42] church would mean and do hallelujah now
[29:46] what is his glory and presence in the
[29:49] church supposed to do o believers what a
[29:53] revelation do you recognize what I'm
[29:56] saying that you and I and many others
[30:01] have caught this revelation just of that
[30:05] this talk of the glory of his person and
[30:08] presence his presence in the true church
[30:11] what that would do what did it do to you
[30:15] well it was revealed to you that you are
[30:18] his gene you are his attribute and that
[30:20] he was in you and is in you from the for
[30:25] the foundation of the world and puts you
[30:28] in the position that you recognize Jesus
[30:31] Christ the same yesterday and today and
[30:34] forever his power his presence his glory
[30:39] in the church today brother he lives he
[30:43] lives he lives Christ Jesus lives today
[30:47] oh he walks with me and he talks with me
[30:50] all along slice wonderful way amen
[30:55] glorious revelation is what reveals to
[30:59] us and gives to us the authority the
[31:02] power and the boldness and the certainty
[31:05] of who we are so that we have instead of
[31:09] the devil prevailing against you or I or
[31:12] against the church that Church the true
[31:15] church will prevail against him and
[31:19] overcome him by the Word of God and by
[31:22] our testimony to the token blood of
[31:25] Jesus Christ than a sprinkler that has
[31:28] been dubbed upon the doorposts of our
[31:32] hearts where God said I'll pass over you
[31:34] hey man thanks me to God as sons of Duns
[31:38] of the Living God that we can be here
[31:41] tonight looking at the Word of God and
[31:44] saying I can see clearly now because all
[31:48] the darkness is gone the gloom is gone
[31:51] the clouds are gone and I can see Jesus
[31:54] only I cannot see all of these
[31:58] denominational opinions I can't hear the
[32:02] opinions of men anymore I can't hear
[32:05] anymore of the voices in the world all I
[32:08] can hear is a voice of God in these last
[32:12] days speaking to my heart thanks God for
[32:15] evermore no Satan hits this revelation
[32:22] and he hits all Revelation and a reason
[32:27] why is because this especially of
[32:32] Revelation tells about the end of the
[32:35] devil of course the book of Genesis
[32:38] tells about his his past and where he
[32:43] came from and a book of Isaiah and many
[32:47] other prophets reveal his rise his
[32:51] deceit trail of the serpent his lies his
[32:56] murders his destruction and his his
[33:01] being cast down out of heaven the
[33:04] emotion the motive he was action
[33:07] they demoted from his original position
[33:10] and became nothing but a loser a wastrel
[33:14] a wayward blackguard a renegade and one
[33:20] that is a wonderer of the wastelands
[33:22] here we see clearly in the Word of God
[33:26] why Satan has the cause to hit
[33:30] Revelation he hits Revelation instead of
[33:35] education education is good
[33:39] he hates revelation and he hates but he
[33:45] he just loves systems because by systems
[33:50] he can anticipate he knows what is
[33:55] coming but revelation comes upon the
[34:00] sons and daughters of God and in the
[34:03] words of Jesus the wind bloweth where it
[34:06] listeth and no man knows where it would
[34:10] but he that is born of the Spirit so
[34:14] Satan cannot anticipate what God is
[34:18] going to do through your life and that
[34:21] sends him wild and crazy whipping his
[34:25] tail around doing everything possible to
[34:28] upset unbalance and try to prevail
[34:31] against you discourage tempt lie
[34:36] rumors whatever against you but thank
[34:40] God the word says he shall not prevail
[34:44] against the true Church of the Living
[34:47] God but he hits on Revelation he hits
[34:50] this book of Revelation and he spews out
[34:53] his lies true lots of preachers teachers
[34:58] tell no jokes
[35:00] scientists bringing up all kinds of
[35:04] theories conspiracies against the Word
[35:08] of God and so in this in this book these
[35:12] books of Genesis and revelation and one
[35:16] we find his original in the other book
[35:20] in the book
[35:21] revelation we find his total destruction
[35:25] and his end it's all written before it
[35:29] actually happens we see all of his awful
[35:34] ways of destruction that he will bring
[35:38] on the face of the earth and Jesus made
[35:41] it clear John 10:10 but the thief cometh
[35:45] not but for to kill not to steal but I
[35:48] am come that you might have life and
[35:51] that you might have it more abundantly
[35:55] oh the devil is a father of lies the
[36:00] devil is a destroyer but God is a healer
[36:05] for he said I am the lord that he let me
[36:09] he God is our God is a deliverer and we
[36:13] thank God for that now Satan hates
[36:17] revelation because revelation exposes
[36:22] him every time he tries to ambush you
[36:25] ambush the church hide behind some
[36:28] disguise is unveiled he's uncovered he's
[36:33] revealed his work is made clear and so
[36:38] the believer can take the necessary
[36:41] steps to withstand him so this book of
[36:46] Revelation tells of his end and it tells
[36:49] us the end of his followers those that
[36:53] will hold on to his tales his line tales
[36:58] that he tells and follow him all the way
[37:02] and allow him to drag them right into
[37:06] hell along with it with himself for if
[37:09] you identify with Christ you have gonna
[37:12] Hammond you're identifying with the
[37:14] devil and be a slave of the devil with
[37:18] his habits with his sin with his evil
[37:20] thoughts on this evil character then you
[37:24] paying the price with your
[37:26] representation certainly we see friends
[37:30] that these two books expose him and
[37:33] Satan hates to be exposed lay because
[37:38] the word expose is is like saying
[37:43] casting light on a person or a spotlight
[37:47] on a person or a situation so Satan
[37:53] hates the light he hates to be exposed
[37:57] or revealed to who he is he loves to
[38:01] make himself appear as a as a angel of
[38:06] light
[38:07] but then when God's light is turned on
[38:10] it's revealed that he is an angel of
[38:14] darkness he is the devil and that is
[38:18] he's a creature of darkness his people
[38:22] and his children are a children of
[38:24] darkness by darkness I mean Satan lusts
[38:28] to keep people in spiritual ignorance
[38:32] and in spiritual darkness of who they
[38:37] are who their father is their real
[38:41] origins where they come from and where
[38:46] is their destiny this is what he does he
[38:50] hits the entire Bible and keeps trying
[38:54] to keep it from people he tries to do it
[38:58] one he does it first of all by hindering
[39:02] its writing first of all the Bible was
[39:06] not yet written
[39:07] and after believers begin to write the
[39:12] Bible Paul and some of the others Luke
[39:17] Matthew and the others began to write
[39:20] the Bible then certain ones he began to
[39:24] try to hinder it because what he'll take
[39:28] it and hold on to it
[39:29] lock it up within his various seminaries
[39:34] and monasteries and places like that and
[39:37] claim ownership over it like that and
[39:42] then when that began to creep out or
[39:46] seep out into the population then what
[39:51] did he do he began to try to hinder the
[39:54] printing of it men like William Tyndale
[39:58] in 1494 that began to try to print the
[40:03] final so that can be had by the common
[40:06] people
[40:07] under the auspices of this wonderful
[40:09] this King James I think it was good King
[40:14] James or later on that wanted this Bible
[40:17] printed so that all the common people
[40:20] can have access to the Bible once the
[40:24] Bible got printed he changed his
[40:26] strategy and started burning the Bible
[40:30] burning the people that read the Bible
[40:32] killing them persecuting them oh thank
[40:37] god
[40:38] I say again for King James who began to
[40:41] proliferate the Bible and then once he
[40:46] continued doing that the next thing he
[40:49] did after that was start locking the
[40:53] Bible up in the churches and as a boy I
[40:57] literally saw one of those Bibles in one
[41:04] of those churches with a literal brass
[41:07] padlock on it it had a latch and had a
[41:12] key and a padlock was on it and only the
[41:18] priests had a key that he could open
[41:21] that lock and read out of this book
[41:24] which brought fear and mystery upon the
[41:28] people and they were given this lie that
[41:32] only the priests only the preachers
[41:36] could understand the Bible but
[41:39] thank God that's been lifting away from
[41:42] the people that's been the scales have
[41:45] dropped off all right and we could
[41:47] recognize that when we look we can see
[41:49] Jesus only standing there in all of his
[41:54] marvelous glory yes sir
[41:57] no he began to perpetrate that lie that
[42:00] only the priests and the preachers had
[42:03] the right to interpret the Word of God
[42:06] but we know that God is his own
[42:09] interpreter and he is the one only he
[42:12] the author can tell you about himself
[42:15] only God can reveal his own word to his
[42:20] own people and make it plain and clear
[42:22] to them blessed be the name of our Lord
[42:26] God for evermore thank you Lord Jesus
[42:29] hallelujah now we understand revelation
[42:33] does not come by study it does not come
[42:37] by burning the midnight oil it is not
[42:40] based upon human intelligence but it's
[42:44] based upon God's grace and to whom he
[42:48] would reveal his word and make it known
[42:50] to themselves Oh
[42:53] blessed be the name of the Lord friends
[42:55] I thank God that he opened my eyes one
[42:59] day and you ought to thank God wherever

[43:04] able to see this message of this hour
[43:07] and if you have not heard of this as yet
