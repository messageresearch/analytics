[31:56] that we have passed through that we are
[31:59] going through and we have all have an
[32:02] individual walk
[32:05] and that is why we don't compare

[32:13] we used to look at because we were still
[32:17] babes in Christ or immature in Christ

[32:33] oh Lord I'm standing in the need of
[32:36] prayer and I pray that every one of you

[40:16] hearts you be seated by God's grace
[40:19] the Lord help us this morning I would
[40:22] like to seek take an inspiration this
[40:24] morning from the message Paul a prisoner
[40:28] of Jesus Christ quote number one
[40:35] wonderful
[40:37] God's Prophet said
[40:39] so we are really
[40:42] Shadows of light
[40:45] we are shadows of light
[40:48] now you are reflecting a life from
[40:53] somewhere
[40:55] are we going
[40:56] if you are a Christian
[41:00] and this being a shadow is only proved
[41:04] there is a life where you can't die
[41:08] because this life has debt in it
[41:13] but it is a shadow
[41:16] because you are living moving creature
[41:21] with abilities succeeding move and talk
[41:24] and five senses of the body but yet to
[41:29] know that they are dying
[41:32] and there's so much trouble you know it
[41:36] it can't
[41:38] it can't be it's a reflection see
[41:42] there's life and death mixed together
[41:47] so God's Prophet is identifying to us
[41:51] that we are shadows of light
[41:55] amen that this this means this life
[41:59] is a shadow
[42:01] I trust the Lord will help us this
[42:03] morning I want to take a look at moving
[42:07] from Shadow to reality
[42:09] amen this life being a shadow
[42:14] what is a shadow
[42:16] a shadow is described as a semblance
[42:21] a shadow is described as the dark
[42:25] portion of a picture
[42:28] God's Prophet call and Shadow a forecast
[42:32] of an object
[42:33] what do you mean to say you are not you
[42:40] you are not you
[42:42] do you you watch the mirror do you you
[42:46] look after in the mirror and Etc and Etc
[42:48] that is not you
[42:53] you are a shadow
[42:55] but we are a movement from Shadow to
[42:58] reality
[43:00] so let's go on as we you get the picture
[43:03] so your shadow
[43:06] gives a conception
[43:09] of what you look like
[43:12] that and you
[43:14] you look like that
[43:16] that is why when you leave here you only
[43:19] carry your looks
[43:21] did you hear
[43:23] when you leave this earth there's
[43:25] nothing of this Earth You Carry
[43:27] all they end up with is your image
[43:31] because this is what you look like
[43:35] amen
[43:37] so the shadow
[43:40] trees content
[43:42] 18 19 10 or 20. how much God has allowed
[43:45] you to have
[43:47] this Shadow is not the real thing
[43:52] amen this Shadow is not the real thing
[43:55] amen the shadow is a negative side of
[44:00] the object
[44:02] our modern children don't know about
[44:05] negatives
[44:06] and you live in a new age and
[44:10] you have a whole new age right but we
[44:13] who are to deal with Shadow negatives we
[44:16] gotta look
[44:18] because the negative is not depicted
[44:21] so we're looking at the negative and we
[44:23] it happens dizzy
[44:25] because a negative young people you
[44:27] don't know what we're talking about
[44:28] right
[44:30] it comes like I was preaching on the
[44:32] five wives and five foolish virgins and
[44:34] I had to find a lamp
[44:36] because this light can help you
[44:39] I had to find a week
[44:42] you know because all you don't know
[44:44] we're talking about well you get a big
[44:46] black
[44:47] well we didn't get light soon and the
[44:49] Bible when the Bible talk about having a
[44:51] lamp it was not kind of lamp
[44:53] so we're going
[44:55] so bear with us in case you're getting
[44:57] prettier your grandmother might tell you
[44:59] what what a negative happened to me what
[45:02] the camera used to do and what we used
[45:05] to have as a negative are we going
[45:07] okay
[45:09] so the shadow is the negative side of
[45:14] the object
[45:16] get the picture we're talking about me
[45:18] and you
[45:19] okay so what we are in now is the
[45:23] negative side of the object
[45:27] amen it's a pattern
[45:30] amen it is not the real thing
[45:33] when we get that grabs that we could get
[45:36] to understand what the psalmist David
[45:38] meant when he said amen thy loving
[45:41] kindness is better than life
[45:44] he said he's speaking of the lord lord
[45:46] your loving kindness is better than life
[45:48] what it is better than life
[45:51] it means to tell us this morning there
[45:53] are two types of life
[45:55] what people call life this morning is
[45:58] really debt
[46:00] because this life is so great when you
[46:03] get further people take a gun
[46:04] and blow off your head
[46:06] so what is life what people call life is
[46:10] a life of birds
[46:12] X
[46:14] different kind of emotion lives is what
[46:18] the scripture referred to as a way that
[46:21] seemed right
[46:23] amen because this life is a life of
[46:26] perversion
[46:27] so then there are two kinds of life
[46:30] there is God's life and human life that
[46:35] is why we could grasp now when God's
[46:37] Prophet said
[46:38] under your own understanding there are
[46:41] some people who own dramatized seed of
[46:43] human life
[46:44] they only have human life but if I thank
[46:48] God this morning we have human life and
[46:50] God's life
[46:51] blessed be the name of the Lord amen
[46:55] because there is nothing greater than to
[47:00] have this morning the life of almighty
[47:03] God
[47:04] you know God's Prophet will tell us no
[47:06] matter what you accomplish
[47:09] no matter what we get in this life no
[47:11] matter what no matter how great we are
[47:13] and what we do in education and what we
[47:16] do in wealth and what we're doing
[47:17] nothing could come near to what God has
[47:21] done to you that is all that is real
[47:24] life
[47:24] nothing could come not nothing could
[47:27] come near nothing could come even near
[47:29] to what God has done for us glory to God
[47:33] so
[47:35] this life is Prophet is showing us is a
[47:40] shadow amen this life is a perverted
[47:45] thing
[47:46] that is why we want to get 16 again
[47:51] all of us want to be 17 Again
[47:53] all of us ought to be 18 Again belong to
[47:57] be 20.
[47:59] you know the picture you have a 20 put
[48:01] it up
[48:03] put it up
[48:05] keep it frame it because you'll never
[48:09] see that again
[48:14] Your Shadow start to burn out
[48:17] you're like a candle you know
[48:20] after 20 you're burning down and makeup
[48:24] can't help
[48:27] cosmetic surgery cannot help
[48:32] Europe I used to boost myself as being
[48:35] one of the most best workers in the
[48:37] world
[48:38] one day one day a Young Man passed I
[48:40] said wait I get involved
[48:43] so you're going down
[48:45] you're not going up you're going down
[48:46] right it is a shadow
[48:49] it is not the real thing
[48:52] so I appreciate sweet 17 or sweet 18 or
[48:55] 320 yeah
[48:57] don't don't think you're gonna stay so
[49:02] yes you could be so again
[49:04] [Applause]
[49:11] this is not
[49:12] the game
[49:13] but in this one no you can't make it
[49:17] amen because love one another how much
[49:20] we want to love one another when I reach
[49:23] a certain age or we reach a certain age
[49:25] or some people join us somebody had to
[49:27] help us across the road
[49:29] you know what a nice woman but
[49:32] let me help you so let's go
[49:34] so that is why with this life three
[49:38] squantene will long to get back young
[49:42] again
[49:43] we always reflect when I was
[49:46] when I was
[49:48] what I used to do
[49:51] yeah Iran now we are the Guardians
[49:57] and all kind of thing what do you used
[49:59] to do
[50:00] the life always a life of provision amen
[50:05] so in this life we have ends and we have
[50:07] outs we have UPS we have dogs amen God's
[50:11] profited the message Shalom quote number
[50:13] two
[50:15] are we getting it this morning
[50:17] [Music]
[50:23] what a wonderful thing
[50:27] that is especially when an old man like
[50:30] me stand here
[50:31] and the old man who was saying this was
[50:33] 54.
[50:36] not 74 like me
[50:41] good old man the old man was 54. and the
[50:46] woman is saying what a wonderful thing
[50:48] that is especially when an old man like
[50:50] me stand here and think of the life that
[50:55] is fading away
[50:57] that is gone in the past
[50:59] and we are facing an eternity a future
[51:03] of an eternity and knowing if this life
[51:07] alone is what I had hopes in I'll be the
[51:10] most miserable person
[51:12] but knowing that this light can only be
[51:16] a shadow
[51:18] of what we had to come it's a reflection
[51:22] amen it cannot be the perfect thing
[51:27] God will make nothing
[51:31] God will make nothing perfect
[51:34] it is not the perfect thing that God
[51:37] made God don't make anything that
[51:40] perishes
[51:42] God is eternal
[51:45] and therefore this life that we now live
[51:49] is only reflecting what is ahead of us
[51:55] I want to remind ourselves this morning
[51:58] we are not going to heaven
[52:03] we are not only going to heaven we are
[52:06] reflecting heaven
[52:07] [Applause]
[52:09] right now why you think you heard it

[52:16] is not tomorrow when you get a concept
[52:18] of heavenly places do not beg you to
[52:20] come to church

[52:23] best place you could be in in Canada

[52:28] Toronto you're a place where God is in
[52:32] control it is a place where God's word
[52:35] is being spoke this is a place to fall
[52:38] under evenly atmosphere
[52:41] if the influence of this place is a
[52:45] blessing that is why God prophesied when
[52:48] you don't feel you come come
[52:51] you don't feel Japan
[52:53] still come
[52:54] because there's a blessing to come here

[53:00] house of the Lord I never tell you the
[53:03] churches have men

[53:11] matter of fact amen then God Prophet
[53:14] said you see this fulfilled here is the
[53:16] nearest place to have this
[53:18] because what comes out from here is the
[53:21] word of God
[53:22] and that is what you need to hear that
[53:25] is what to get you out of this shadow
[53:28] Hallelujah Get You Out of The Shadow

[55:08] with me it's not a song it's a reality
[55:11] what what Adam was supposed to enjoy you
[55:14] could enjoy now having a relationship
[55:17] not with the church but with the pastor
[55:19] this is not an individual matter you are
[55:21] having a relationship with almighty God
[55:23] [Applause]

[55:29] be getting the right kind of
[55:30] relationship

[55:35] word nobody didn't want to fight no no
[55:37] but nobody everybody has a goal in their

[55:42] all right let's go on by the grace of
[55:45] the Lord Glory
[55:48] Hallelujah
[55:51] so therefore this life that we now live
[55:55] is only reflecting what is ahead of us
[56:00] the original one
[56:03] amen this life there's a song of
[56:05] precious Brothers singing
[56:07] things that would be the real me
[56:11] not just me
[56:13] there's a real me
[56:15] that real me is what the message called
[56:18] The Creator is he that is in you
[56:21] that is the real me this is not me
[56:28] that is why we are taught in the word
[56:30] amen your greatest enemies you
[56:37] you're working at with pongs are enemy
[56:41] these bombs are your enemy not your
[56:43] friend
[56:46] do you think that I waste most of my
[56:48] time to think about who don't like me is
[56:50] me don't like me
[56:54] this thing has hindered me
[56:56] this body understand me to hate you
[56:59] the world never tells me that
[57:01] did she never tell me that the real me
[57:04] never tell me that but this is
[57:08] a gossip against that fella
[57:10] this body understand me here filth
[57:13] sea field don't go to church tonight go
[57:16] and sleep
[57:18] go and watch some some something to
[57:20] watch
[57:21] this body is different you know that's
[57:24] why when the world said kill yourself
[57:27] not suicide
[57:30] I go and say where do you see
[57:32] we at a higher level here
[57:36] Apostle Paul call it I Die daily
[57:39] for daily you have to crucify
[57:42] daily after ill myself because I
[57:44] recognize I am walking with my enemy
[57:48] not my friend
[57:50] that is why the word in me brings this
[57:54] fella under control
[57:56] he has to be on the subjection
[58:00] amen amen he's the king
[58:04] and I am a subject
[58:08] [Applause]
[58:13] somehow you're gonna feel if you're
[58:15] pulling on me if you leave me so I won't
[58:17] finish
[58:18] so let me finish right we thank God for
[58:20] his house thank God you know in crooked
[58:22] language we say that um it was a good
[58:24] pitch
[58:26] those who know cricket
[58:28] so let's go by the grace of the Lord
[58:31] hurry
[58:33] this right let's go so God is eternal
[58:36] therefore this life we now live is only
[58:39] reflecting in the life that is ahead of
[58:40] us the real one that cannot die
[58:44] the body that cannot prayers
[58:46] the life that cannot be taken and
[58:49] therefore the scripture is right where
[58:51] they say that we have everlasting we
[58:54] have eternal life
[58:55] we shall never die
[58:58] see because you become when you are born
[59:01] again you become a part of God
[59:04] you are forever for eternity never to
[59:08] fall amen you are bad
[59:10] cause you are his son amen so it is a
[59:14] wonderful thing amen our hope is not in
[59:18] this life
[59:19] our hope is in the life that is to come
[59:23] amen so God's Prophet is identifying to
[59:25] us to examine this life that God doesn't
[59:28] make anything that perishes
[59:30] amen so this life this morning
[59:34] is a shadow
[59:37] and the greatest thing we have is life
[59:40] we don't have nothing Christian and
[59:41] rifle other than God's life but
[59:44] naturally God's Prophet is identified to
[59:47] us to examine ourselves that this life
[59:50] that we think so much of we we worship
[59:54] ourselves we praise ourselves we do all
[59:56] kind of thing with it it is a shadow we
[1:00:00] want to think about the real thing
[1:00:03] no church not only this life is a shadow
[1:00:07] everything around us is a shadow
[1:00:11] is a shadow a type of the things
[1:00:15] Supernatural
[1:00:17] the things
[1:00:18] Eternal the things on the other side
[1:00:21] when you see a tree
[1:00:23] a tree is a shadow
[1:00:25] he ain't real you know
[1:00:27] he's not a real tree the real tree is a
[1:00:30] tree of life
[1:00:32] amen the tree is a shadow it represents
[1:00:36] another tree we are having some
[1:00:38] fellowship with the brothers yesterday
[1:00:40] husband and wife marriage is a shadow
[1:00:44] that is not the real marriage
[1:00:46] the Real Marriage am I going are we all
[1:00:49] right
[1:00:50] invisible Union
[1:00:53] the invisible Union of the bride of
[1:00:55] Christ is the real marriage
[1:00:59] this one is only a shadow may I remind
[1:01:03] you if he does that shape up with his
[1:01:06] shadow we can't get any real water
[1:01:08] [Applause]
[1:01:08] [Music]
[1:01:10] are you in church
[1:01:12] are you in church
[1:01:16] it no sense this morning I claim to be
[1:01:19] bride
[1:01:21] of Christ
[1:01:22] you know
[1:01:24] in the real thing now and I can't handle
[1:01:26] my physical marriage
[1:01:30] back home I say it's time to drink my
[1:01:32] water because everybody gets silent
[1:01:38] all right but take note of it please
[1:01:40] it is very important that we take note
[1:01:43] because this marriage our marriages is a
[1:01:47] shadow of the real marriage
[1:01:50] amen and we want the real marriage
[1:01:55] get it correct
[1:01:57] I think assistant When You See Your
[1:02:00] Shadow it reflects you
[1:02:04] let me say it plain and nice and crude
[1:02:09] good
[1:02:11] good
[1:02:12] my relationship with my wife and my wife
[1:02:15] relationship with me is indicative
[1:02:17] indicative of my relationship with God
[1:02:22] get more quietness nobody
[1:02:26] why are you strangling me for
[1:02:30] but think about it
[1:02:31] I am preaching on that right
[1:02:36] let's go
[1:02:38] that's a hard one
[1:02:39] so everything I wrong is that shadow
[1:02:42] the Natural Body is a type of the
[1:02:45] spiritual body amen hallelujah is a a
[1:02:49] type a shadow of the things to come what
[1:02:52] Isaiah tells us in Isaiah 55 amen and
[1:02:56] verse 2 it tells us wherefore do you
[1:02:59] spend money for that which is not bread
[1:03:02] and your labor for that with satisfied
[1:03:04] not hack intelligently unto me and eat
[1:03:07] he that which is that which is good and
[1:03:10] let your soul Delight itself in fatness
[1:03:12] amen so why are you gonna spend money
[1:03:14] for that which is not bread amen what it
[1:03:18] means to you know a lot of us I think
[1:03:21] there should be a song in the world
[1:03:22] something like that people running after
[1:03:24] Shadows
[1:03:26] you're spending everything after Shadows
[1:03:29] you're spending money you're spending
[1:03:31] time after Shadows so don't spend it
[1:03:33] after Shadows seek the reality amen okay
[1:03:38] so when we look at the Shadows
[1:03:41] amen there is a real expression
[1:03:45] somewhere
[1:03:47] right to find a shadow there had to be
[1:03:50] an image
[1:03:52] you can't get a shadow without an image
[1:03:55] so the shadow is said there is an image
[1:03:59] that is coming
[1:04:01] amen is a reflection of what is ahead
[1:04:07] amen so this life God's Prophet
[1:04:10] identified to us is a shadow
[1:04:13] and if this life is a shadow there is a
[1:04:18] real life somewhere
[1:04:20] [Applause]
[1:04:21] this life is a reflection of what is
[1:04:25] ahead of us
[1:04:27] it reflecting the life that cannot
[1:04:29] perish
[1:04:30] a reflecting the body that cannot die
[1:04:32] amen is a shadow of the things to come
[1:04:36] so beyond the shadow
[1:04:38] there is a body made without hands
[1:04:43] Beyond The Shadow there is an immortal
[1:04:47] body amen so on this Earth we are here
[1:04:50] and as Believers amen we thank God that
[1:04:54] God has opened that to our eyes because
[1:04:56] the world lives how they want to live
[1:04:59] but we have a different image we know we
[1:05:03] know we have a different purpose we know
[1:05:05] God has a purpose for us here we are in
[1:05:09] a negative form amen this is just the
[1:05:13] shadow
[1:05:15] glory to God
[1:05:16] we live in an age that all of us here
[1:05:19] have a cell phone
[1:05:21] and all of us here know the significance
[1:05:24] of a charge
[1:05:28] you could be going on the road and you
[1:05:29] forget your food or you forget your
[1:05:30] charge but you're like official order of
[1:05:33] water you have to run down
[1:05:37] I have to be charged
[1:05:38] I had to answer my phone I had to make
[1:05:41] calls I need to be always charged
[1:05:44] I thank God
[1:05:46] what God's Prophet said your own
[1:05:48] glorified body is standing near you
[1:05:51] right now
[1:05:52] in Jesus Christ to give this shadow
[1:05:57] to what to give this Shadow a child
[1:06:03] your own glorified body is near you
[1:06:08] right now the holy spirit in you it
[1:06:13] gives you a charge
[1:06:15] there are time you get any dumps there's
[1:06:18] a time you're done there's a time thing
[1:06:20] not what they ought to be but over
[1:06:22] you're gonna plug in
[1:06:24] plug in
[1:06:27] and you end up like the African slave
[1:06:29] you could walk straight
[1:06:31] glory to God
[1:06:33] Hallelujah
[1:06:36] so your Shadow this morning
[1:06:39] on the wall
[1:06:41] gives a picture
[1:06:44] of what you look like
[1:06:47] amen it tells what you look like
[1:06:52] amen this Shadow it tells us about the
[1:06:58] negative part of your journey not the
[1:07:00] positive part because his shadow don't
[1:07:02] look good
[1:07:03] the shadow don't look good
[1:07:06] you Shadow tell you all the wrong things
[1:07:08] you do
[1:07:10] you say I don't tell you about all your
[1:07:12] scars the devil like to remind you
[1:07:14] of all the things you lose in 1901.
[1:07:19] it comes to you it gets you depressed
[1:07:23] sometimes whether you received or you
[1:07:25] received
[1:07:27] whether God dealing with you or and
[1:07:30] dealing with you
[1:07:31] because is your Shadow you're focusing
[1:07:34] in
[1:07:35] but when you get into the deed and you
[1:07:37] get to realize you read somewhere in the
[1:07:40] world will tell you you did not do it
[1:07:42] that was not you
[1:07:45] that's not the real you
[1:07:47] [Applause]
[1:07:50] as a matter of fact during you was not
[1:07:53] supposed to come the way you came
[1:07:58] thank God for his word
[1:08:01] thank God for his word
[1:08:04] amen amen
[1:08:08] so this is the negative part of the
[1:08:12] journey
[1:08:14] and where there is a negative
[1:08:17] there is a positive
[1:08:20] quote number three
[1:08:22] the message masterpiece
[1:08:25] we realize
[1:08:28] that we are here in the negative form
[1:08:33] however we want to let it be revelated
[1:08:36] in our lives
[1:08:37] the only thing good we have in this part
[1:08:39] of the world is the word of God
[1:08:42] the only thing positive we have is the
[1:08:44] word
[1:08:45] when you get that picture you gotta
[1:08:48] understand what I try to develop in our
[1:08:50] hearts The Importance of Being feeding
[1:08:53] the soul
[1:08:54] don't feed the shadow
[1:09:00] you could be feeding the shadow a lot of
[1:09:01] time and he created a monster
[1:09:05] should I even tell you and we ought to
[1:09:07] remind ourselves the shadow is very
[1:09:09] religious you know
[1:09:13] we want to get the real thing the
[1:09:15] message Masterpiece let's get going we
[1:09:18] realize that we are here in a negative
[1:09:20] form
[1:09:21] and as long as there is a negative there
[1:09:25] has to be a positive
[1:09:28] there cannot be a negative
[1:09:32] without a positive
[1:09:34] see because is the positive that makes
[1:09:37] it negative
[1:09:41] so don't worry about this negative you
[1:09:42] have
[1:09:43] for you to be negative and hard of a
[1:09:45] positive
[1:09:47] there is a positive is the positive that
[1:09:50] makes the negative let's go on and see a
[1:09:52] picture Oh Glory
[1:09:56] like you had a negative pity of some
[1:09:59] object
[1:10:00] there has to be an object somewhere
[1:10:04] to strike
[1:10:06] the light
[1:10:07] that lens they wouldn't if that there
[1:10:10] wouldn't be a negative so when we see
[1:10:12] our life here is negative
[1:10:15] amen
[1:10:17] knowing that we are in the image of some
[1:10:19] life somewhere that we know that there's
[1:10:22] a positive somewhere that the light has
[1:10:25] struck and it's reflected something here
[1:10:27] in the earth identifying we are only
[1:10:31] here only that reflection the genuine
[1:10:35] object is somewhere so God's prophecy is
[1:10:39] identifying to us this life is the
[1:10:41] negative there to have a negative you
[1:10:44] have to have a positive amen this is not
[1:10:47] the genuine object that's why the
[1:10:49] Apostle Paul said even this life alone
[1:10:51] we are hope we have all men most
[1:10:54] miserable there is a genuine object we
[1:10:58] are talking about moving from Shadow to
[1:11:01] reality
[1:11:02] amen
[1:11:05] amen the genuine object is somewhere if
[1:11:07] that isn't I am the worst deceived man
[1:11:10] in the world I've spent my life in vain
[1:11:13] but I know beyond a shadow of a doubt
[1:11:16] that is it's it's there that's why we
[1:11:19] are here so there is a genuine object
[1:11:23] somewhere by the grace of the Lord so
[1:11:27] this life
[1:11:29] is only the shadow
[1:11:33] this life the whole life everything we
[1:11:35] show off about is not the real life it
[1:11:38] is all is the negative part of the pit
[1:11:40] here someday the picture will be
[1:11:44] developed
[1:11:46] hey hi
[1:11:50] you I don't know what to do any more
[1:11:52] than this but when I used to be out
[1:11:54] there the world more model now you know
[1:11:57] when they do extreme that's something
[1:11:59] they call a dark room yeah
[1:12:02] you know what I mean in to do developed
[1:12:04] tears that's what they call a dark room
[1:12:06] right there's a dark room
[1:12:09] dark room
[1:12:12] yeah
[1:12:16] that it means to remind ourselves
[1:12:19] physical debt is not a bad thing
[1:12:22] [Music]
[1:12:24] physical debt is the dark room
[1:12:28] it's either you go to the dark room or
[1:12:31] the body change
[1:12:35] glory to God
[1:12:36] we are living in the time amen we shall
[1:12:40] not all
[1:12:42] we shall not all
[1:12:44] everybody and going through the dark
[1:12:46] room
[1:12:47] somebody amen will have the body changed
[1:12:50] [Applause]
[1:12:55] Glory
[1:12:56] foreign
[1:13:00] it is called the acid of debt
[1:13:03] so death is not a bad thing after all if
[1:13:08] you're ready to go
[1:13:09] that's why God's Prophet said if it was
[1:13:12] not my concern for my children
[1:13:15] you get it what
[1:13:17] because of their age I am ready to go
[1:13:21] right I would like to live for a purpose
[1:13:25] serve God and do my natural duties
[1:13:31] glory to God
[1:13:34] amen and amen
[1:13:36] so someday Church
[1:13:38] this picture we speak of
[1:13:41] will be developed
[1:13:45] someday is going to be developed someday
[1:13:49] some people is going to be moved will
[1:13:51] move from Shadow to reality
[1:13:55] someday the others will have a body
[1:13:58] change
[1:13:59] getting out of this Shadow Glory so this
[1:14:04] is a shadow
[1:14:07] this is only a reflection
[1:14:10] quote number four
[1:14:13] question and answers
[1:14:15] there God's Prophet will tell us
[1:14:18] amen
[1:14:19] that God
[1:14:23] now in other words
[1:14:28] okay
[1:14:30] okay we're going good we are going good
[1:14:32] all right
[1:14:34] okay
[1:14:36] good
[1:14:40] I just want to get it okay see and now
[1:14:43] in other words everybody say that right
[1:14:45] and now in other words Glory when you
[1:14:50] become a young man or a young woman
[1:14:53] and like God take a picture of you
[1:14:57] no matter how all wrinkle or disfigured
[1:15:01] whatever it will be
[1:15:03] that will wind up right through
[1:15:06] and that body may be destroyed
[1:15:08] disfigured burnt eat up by lion whatever
[1:15:12] it is so he's saying God took a picture
[1:15:15] of you
[1:15:16] [Applause]
[1:15:17] God have a family album
[1:15:20] for you to have an idea of a family of a
[1:15:23] matter of a family
[1:15:24] and God have a family
[1:15:26] and God have a picture of a family
[1:15:30] and he have that in the family album
[1:15:34] let me tell you something you cannot
[1:15:37] believe your own self you cannot trust
[1:15:40] your own self God ain't looking at you
[1:15:43] I said God don't look at you
[1:15:47] God look at the picture
[1:15:49] [Applause]
[1:15:52] when God wants to see you look at the
[1:15:54] picture
[1:15:55] he has a picture of you
[1:16:01] God had that picture
[1:16:03] Hallelujah you want to know that God
[1:16:06] have a big deal and rise to the occasion
[1:16:09] amen so God probably tells us in
[1:16:12] paragraph 21 now this picture is the
[1:16:15] main thing
[1:16:16] amen this picture is the main thing then
[1:16:20] in the resurrection those gases and
[1:16:22] acids and things come right back in this
[1:16:24] place and develops the spirit now this
[1:16:28] picture was not taken when he was 16 or
[1:16:30] 18.
[1:16:33] okay
[1:16:35] it wasn't taken when he was 16.
[1:16:38] because when he was 16 you could have a
[1:16:41] fault in your body
[1:16:44] you could have a good effect
[1:16:46] maybe he wasn't hearing well
[1:16:49] you you remember Sarah
[1:16:51] she was sterile
[1:16:53] when God changed her it was a total
[1:16:55] change
[1:16:58] Hallelujah
[1:17:00] God has a picture of you it wasn't when
[1:17:04] he was 16 or 18 or 20 even then it was
[1:17:08] at your best it wasn't them it's better
[1:17:09] than that I won't tell you okay you
[1:17:12] can't get a picture it's only God have
[1:17:15] access to that
[1:17:17] 16 18 and 20 but the one God talking
[1:17:20] about you can have it but you better get
[1:17:22] that vision
[1:17:24] get that vision
[1:17:25] that you were in the thoughts of God
[1:17:27] that God have you in mind God have you
[1:17:31] in his thoughts when you get that Vision
[1:17:33] nobody could stop you from serving God
[1:17:36] nobody could hinder you nobody no
[1:17:39] obstacles could interfere with you
[1:17:40] nothing could trouble you because you
[1:17:43] know you are part of God's plan
[1:17:46] you know amen that all that's going on
[1:17:49] in this world and in this life is only a
[1:17:52] shadow but the reality is the main thing
[1:17:55] is God's Gonna picture you yeah
[1:17:58] Hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:18:02] Lord amen
[1:18:04] when was it taken before there was a
[1:18:09] foundation of the world
[1:18:11] and it was put in God's Great file
[1:18:16] and the only thing it did was feature
[1:18:19] itself here for you to make a choice
[1:18:22] amen you come into the world you come
[1:18:24] the wrong way
[1:18:25] you know they all you could remember
[1:18:27] okay coming to the world Amen but God
[1:18:32] the negative part amen him for knowing
[1:18:35] it makes him he Forno you it makes him a
[1:18:38] redeemer okay then the picture is
[1:18:40] absolutely so this is the negative
[1:18:44] the negative part of life is where you
[1:18:48] live in now
[1:18:50] amen so grabs that this morning by the
[1:18:52] grace of the Lord
[1:18:53] what we are living in is the negative
[1:18:56] part of life and anything if there's a
[1:18:59] negative there got to be a positive
[1:19:01] before there can be a negative therefore
[1:19:05] if this is a negative there got to be a
[1:19:07] positive somewhere
[1:19:08] and this and the real thing
[1:19:12] it is a foreshadow of the real thing
[1:19:16] that is to come and the art you got it
[1:19:20] you got it so he said I don't care what
[1:19:23] they do with this you they could destroy

[1:20:15] oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:20:18] amen glory glory glory glory
[1:20:22] God's Prophet expounded on the same
[1:20:24] thought he said God is one
[1:20:26] and God is the only one that has eternal
[1:20:29] life and he is eternal and anything that
[1:20:32] our beginning has an end
[1:20:36] amen anything that has a beginning has
[1:20:40] an end
[1:20:42] and if you are just a member of a church
[1:20:44] it has a beginning
[1:20:46] but the word of God has no beginning

[1:20:53] glory and church
[1:20:55] it had a beginning okay if you're a
[1:20:58] member of a church that are beginning
[1:20:59] right and when you are born of the word
[1:21:01] you are born when you are born of God
[1:21:04] you are born of the word
[1:21:06] then you become a Son of God and your
[1:21:09] name was put on a lamb book of life
[1:21:11] before the foundation of the world
[1:21:13] and you the color of your hair the color
[1:21:15] of your eyes you yours you have the
[1:21:18] statutes that you are in God seeing you
[1:21:21] before the foundation of the world
[1:21:24] and this is the reassuring part
[1:21:27] he's seeing you a human being
[1:21:30] like you are
[1:21:33] and though there come a million years
[1:21:36] nothing can keep you from coming to that
[1:21:39] Perfect Image that God holding of you
[1:21:43] [Music]

[1:21:46] nothing could stop that picture from
[1:21:48] coming to reality

[1:21:53] that image that God had ordained of you
[1:21:57] from the beginning Hallelujah

[1:23:30] great days that you could think about
[1:23:32] you could reminisce about
[1:23:35] you could talk about it and talk about
[1:23:37] your experiences but they are not yours

[1:36:28] don't judge your life by power to
[1:36:31] perform Miracles amen don't judge your

[1:36:42] knowledgeable age
[1:36:44] at the flick of a switch we could do
[1:36:45] anything we want to know
[1:36:47] but don't judge yourself by the power
[1:36:51] you have to perform miracles don't judge
[1:36:54] yourself by your knowledge of the word
[1:36:57] look back

[1:37:05] live is bearing
[1:37:07] Lord help us to judge ourselves help us
[1:37:11] to judge ourselves
[1:37:13] he said because God will reflect himself
[1:37:16] to those who will humble themselves to
[1:37:19] his word
[1:37:20] if I were to humble myself to his word
[1:37:23] God will reflect himself to me
[1:37:27] Lord help us
[1:37:30] hallelujah

[1:37:44] a man marry it reflects what is in them
[1:37:49] even Choice reflects your ambition
[1:37:52] Choice reflects your character amen so
[1:37:57] we are called to be reflection of Jesus
[1:38:00] Christ
[1:38:01] we are called to reflect this morning
[1:38:04] the word made manifest
[1:38:08] do I see I see my life
[1:38:10] do I can
[1:38:13] reflecting Jesus Christ
[1:38:16] can I see his life reflected in US
[1:38:21] because God said he will reflect his
[1:38:24] Prophet told us he reflect himself in
[1:38:27] someone who will humble themselves to
[1:38:31] God's word
[1:38:32] so this morning in as much
[1:38:36] as we in a move from Shadow to reality
[1:38:40] it beholds us to examine ourselves
[1:38:45] and see this morning how do we
[1:38:49] how are we seen in God's mirror
[1:38:54] in God's mirror do I reflect the son of
[1:38:57] God
[1:38:59] in God's mirror do I reflect a daughter
[1:39:02] God
[1:39:03] we got to examine what we reflect the
[1:39:07] message identification code number seven
[1:39:11] God's Prophet said not with our message
[1:39:13] can we stand by the looking glass of
[1:39:17] God's word
[1:39:19] and see Christ reflect in our lives
[1:39:24] can we bear such and reproach of the
[1:39:27] message that we are standing for here
[1:39:30] someone can say something about it
[1:39:34] and yet you just open your mouth and say
[1:39:37] nothing about it
[1:39:38] he was an example
[1:39:40] because God was reflecting his character
[1:39:44] in him
[1:39:45] and then if we are Sons and Daughters of
[1:39:49] God God reflects his character in US
[1:39:53] then we become like him
[1:39:55] that's my heart's desire and I think is
[1:39:59] every believer's desire to become more
[1:40:02] like him Glory
[1:40:04] so this morning our outside
[1:40:08] reflects our inside
[1:40:12] our outside reflects our inside our
[1:40:18] lives this morning in this journey or
[1:40:23] from Shadow to reality
[1:40:25] Our Lives reflect what we stand for code
[1:40:29] number eight would not really read it
[1:40:31] all but it is a point where Abraham was
[1:40:34] making
[1:40:35] his son Joseph
[1:40:37] was reported where he hit someone and

[1:40:44] little childhood fight
[1:40:46] hit for hit I hit you you hit me back
[1:40:49] and he called Joseph and said Joseph
[1:40:53] he says too much to tell a little child
[1:40:55] but you're going to put it before them
[1:40:57] put the word before them he said Joseph
[1:41:01] what you did reflect on your mother

[1:41:14] you say no I said more 80 year old boy
[1:41:17] is too much to give him
[1:41:19] but you got to put the word before him
[1:41:22] that we are in a reflection
[1:41:26] and what we do does not is not only it
[1:41:30] doesn't end with me what you do does
[1:41:33] that end with you
[1:41:34] it Bears a reflection not only on mother
[1:41:37] not only on father not only on church
[1:41:40] but it Bears a reflection on Jesus

[1:42:13] tendency amen when a children asleep

[1:42:20] discuss it I can see videos of Mommy I
[1:42:24] can see features of daddy Hallelujah God
[1:42:27] want to see reflection of you himself

[1:42:41] the time of of adoption that the father
[1:42:44] God said yes the teacher could say the
[1:42:46] Holy Spirit could say that is your boy
[1:42:49] that is your son

[1:49:33] supposed to be written Epistles of him
[1:49:36] the bible say that we are written
[1:49:38] Epistles and tonight if we would hunger
[1:49:41] and thirst to see the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:49:44] we as Christians believers who reflect
[1:49:47] him reflect his life so much it would be
[1:49:51] his entire representative we should be
[1:49:54] that every Christian should represent
[1:49:57] and reflect the life of Jesus Christ
[1:50:01] and I believe every Christian should
[1:50:03] reflect the life of Jesus Christ
[1:50:06] he said he that believeth in me the
[1:50:08] works that I do he shall do also and we
[1:50:10] know that's true then we are his
[1:50:13] representative if we claim Christ lives
[1:50:16] and if Christ live in us we should do as
[1:50:20] Christ did reflect his life
[1:50:24] maybe all stands

[1:53:34] said let's give God a clock
[1:53:44] and I thank the Lord uh I just made a
[1:53:47] note where brother green said God saw
[1:53:49] you in his mind before the foundation of
[1:53:53] the world
[1:53:54] and that's the picture that God has of
[1:53:57] you the picture that he already had in
[1:54:01] his mind is what he's he is seeing of
[1:54:04] you so this outside man is producing a
[1:54:09] false picture
[1:54:10] to the people around the real you is on
[1:54:14] the inside of you as our brother has
[1:54:17] said and we thank God for that amen it's
[1:54:20] not what you see or hear about me he is
[1:54:23] not what the devil rumor but it's what
[1:54:26] God saw in his mind about every one of
[1:54:29] us that's the real thing amen and that's
[1:54:32] what we should trust God I'm so glad
[1:54:35] that we are in the last stages of the
[1:54:38] gene the seed of God that has been in us
[1:54:40] and when that comes to the last stage
[1:54:43] what does it do it pushes aside the
[1:54:46] fault that's on the outside of it as the
[1:54:49] brother said the inside man has to push
[1:54:52] away all the Flesh and self and push it
[1:54:55] away so it can emerge and manifest and
[1:54:58] make itself declare and that's what
[1:55:00] we're doing right now we're throwing off
[1:55:02] the old man and putting on the new man
[1:55:05] this is Jesus Christ so that the real
[1:55:08] Gene seed of God in us can be revealed
[1:55:11] Hallelujah then the Bible say in a
[1:55:14] different way yes mortal must put on
[1:55:18] immortality thank God Hallelujah it must
[1:55:23] put on immortality and I'm glad for that
[1:55:26] that we are not going to be as we are

[1:56:40] the glory for it is that right we all
[1:56:43] long as brother green I said well you
[1:56:46] speak for yourself because if you're
[1:56:48] saying you're getting older and older I
[1:56:52] I take Paul's side I'm getting younger
[1:56:54] and younger
[1:56:56] right so here we are in the presence of
[1:57:00] the Lord and from glory to glory he's
[1:57:03] changing us and the changes taking place
[1:57:06] so incrementally we are not even aware
[1:57:09] that we are being changed so on that day
[1:57:13] it's not like all of a sudden your
[1:57:15] change and you're gone you're changing
