[52:00] hallelujah may the lord bless him real

[52:06] dedication here
[52:08] this morning i'd like to do that before
[52:11] bringing the word of god amen praise the
[52:15] lord so let's say bring them in you know
[52:18] that one sister praise the lord a
[52:20] beautiful singing from the group there
[52:21] too
[52:22] i heard that in there and it just lifted
[52:25] my spirit
[52:26] and the first song you started out with
[52:28] was a blessing he leaded me praise the
[52:31] lord
[52:34] thank god
[52:50] [Music]
[53:12] [Music]
[53:16] [Applause]
[53:18] [Music]
[53:25] [Music]
[53:34] amen praise the lord
[53:38] we have a beautiful certificate here
[53:40] which you can
[53:41] frame of course
[53:43] [Music]
[53:44] and we thank the lord for this
[53:48] amen
[53:50] first of all
[53:52] you must understand
[53:54] just to bring the child into the world
[53:57] is a
[53:58] marvelous and wonderful
[54:01] a responsibility you have a part to play
[54:05] we don't just have them come into the
[54:07] world
[54:08] and then they are left to their own
[54:10] devices
[54:13] the real part of this experience of
[54:16] dedication here today
[54:19] is
[54:19] for you as parents to accept the fact
[54:22] that you are instruments for god's use
[54:26] in the raising of this child for his
[54:28] glory
[54:31] and
[54:32] you may have to deny the child sometimes
[54:34] some of its own whims and fancies
[54:37] that it likes
[54:39] right but you want to
[54:42] not surrender to the child's will but to
[54:45] god's will
[54:47] too many parents are surrendering to the
[54:49] children's will
[54:50] instead of to god's will
[54:53] like that
[54:54] so god has you here as the trainer
[54:58] of this uh child
[55:01] there is no escape from that that you
[55:04] are to raise this child in the fear of
[55:07] god
[55:08] uh and in the knowledge of jesus christ
[55:12] and
[55:13] i trust god
[55:15] that you
[55:17] voluntarily accept this position
[55:20] and that you voluntarily accept this
[55:23] responsibility
[55:25] amen for proverbs 22 6 says
[55:29] train up a child in the way that he
[55:32] should go that when he is old he will
[55:36] not depart from it
[55:39] amen and that is uh presuming that the
[55:44] parents already know the way that the
[55:46] child should go
[55:47] before they can train up the child to go
[55:50] in that way
[55:51] so i'm trusting god that since you know
[55:53] the way
[55:54] that you will train the child to go in
[55:58] the way of jesus christ who is the way
[56:00] the truth and the life amen praise god
[56:06] may god grant you wisdom also
[56:10] and grant you the knowledge
[56:12] that you will be able to carry out this
[56:15] responsibility
[56:17] for his glory and honor
[56:19] of course
[56:20] this is not a part-time job
[56:25] parental responsibility is a full-time
[56:27] job
[56:29] 24 7.
[56:30] and even as parents you can't actually
[56:34] watch that child for every minute every
[56:36] moment
[56:37] i in the moment your head turn something
[56:39] can take place but you have got to trust
[56:41] god that above you he is watching
[56:46] he is taking care of things
[56:48] and watching over everything that
[56:51] happens here on the face of the earth
[56:54] amen
[56:56] so let us ask god through divine
[56:58] revelation
[57:00] that he will reveal and make known the
[57:02] purpose of this child's life
[57:05] here
[57:06] so that he can use the child as an
[57:09] instrument for his glory listen to the
[57:12] scriptures he will show you things to

[1:09:12] amen
[1:09:14] one rapture is passed
[1:09:17] three
[1:09:18] you see it's happened in the old
[1:09:20] testament
[1:09:22] of them who
[1:09:24] the word of god came
[1:09:27] to
[1:09:29] the word of god

[1:09:42] the word of the lord
[1:09:44] was jesus
[1:09:46] amen all three of them went up in what
[1:09:51] rapture
[1:09:52] praise god
[1:09:54] watch
[1:09:55] in the old testament
[1:09:58] them old testament saints
[1:10:01] when this
[1:10:02] rapture first taken place
[1:10:05] notice
[1:10:06] his loud voice
[1:10:09] is what which woke up them saints back
[1:10:12] there see
[1:10:14] the same loud voice
[1:10:16] that wakened lazarus
[1:10:19] was now sounding glory to god hallelujah
[1:10:23] the second
[1:10:25] rapture will be
[1:10:27] the one of thessalonians 4
[1:10:30] which will be the rapture of the bride
[1:10:33] but this one
[1:10:35] is of the old testament
[1:10:38] saints praise god i'm going to pause
[1:10:42] right here and go over
[1:10:45] and show you
[1:10:46] uh where he spoke about that in the word
[1:10:50] of god
[1:10:52] now
[1:10:53] jesus when he had cried with a loud
[1:10:55] voice
[1:10:57] matthew 27 45
[1:11:00] hallelujah
[1:11:04] a loud voice the prophet says notice
[1:11:08] he cried with a loud voice
[1:11:11] when jesus was dying
[1:11:13] he literally screamed
[1:11:16] with a loud voice
[1:11:18] and yielded up the ghost
[1:11:21] and behold the veil of the temple was
[1:11:23] rent in plain from top to bottom
[1:11:27] and the earth did quick
[1:11:29] and the rocks did rent and
[1:11:32] their graves were opened
[1:11:36] and the bodies of the saints that
[1:11:39] slipped that's during the patriarchal
[1:11:42] and prophetic dispensations
[1:11:46] all those believing saints that had died
[1:11:50] during that time when he cried with a
[1:11:53] loud voice his voice woke up the dead
[1:11:58] that had died believing unto
[1:12:02] his coming
[1:12:03] now
[1:12:04] that's why we say the cross
[1:12:06] because the cross is at the crossing of
[1:12:09] time and there they were looking for to
[1:12:12] his coming we are looking back towards
[1:12:16] what he has already done
[1:12:18] praise god and so
[1:12:21] they were looking for his coming and his
[1:12:24] loud voice awakened them out of the
[1:12:27] graves hallelujah the bible tells us
[1:12:31] in peter how that he went down into hell
[1:12:36] preach to the spirits that were
[1:12:38] imprisoned
[1:12:40] and you know i've spoken on that the
[1:12:41] prison where you know there are
[1:12:43] prisoners of satan and there's prisoners
[1:12:45] of god like paul so prisoners right you
[1:12:48] just don't use the word generally we are
[1:12:50] prisoners to christ the word and they
[1:12:53] those prophets and those patriarchs were
[1:12:55] prisoners to christ the word the messiah
[1:12:58] word amen hallelujah and so he took
[1:13:02] those who were held there by satan and
[1:13:06] you know brother branham dramatized it
[1:13:08] how he just grabbed the keys from
[1:13:10] satan's belt and pulled it off and said
[1:13:12] give me those keys stand back now amen
[1:13:16] and when they looked they saw the lord
[1:13:19] hallelujah is it work that's the stone
[1:13:22] that i saw that came out of the mountain
[1:13:25] the next one said that's the wheel that
[1:13:26] was in the middle of the wheel the next
[1:13:29] one said that's the man i met in the
[1:13:31] fiery furnace
[1:13:33] lord of god when i was going through my
[1:13:36] troubles my trials that's the man that i
[1:13:38] met hallelujah oh praise god and he
[1:13:42] brought them out with a mighty hand the
[1:13:45] bible said that he led captivity captive
[1:13:50] and he gave gifts unto men and he took
[1:13:53] them into glory praise god now psalms
[1:13:57] 24.
[1:14:00] if you will turn
[1:14:01] you will find
[1:14:03] him taking them back
[1:14:06] into glory
[1:14:07] in psalms 24
[1:14:11] and you will read that scripture for
[1:14:14] yourself right there
[1:14:16] praise god
[1:14:18] the art is the lord's and the fullness
[1:14:20] thereof
[1:14:22] verse 7
[1:14:24] lift up your heads are you

[1:14:39] and when time is over you don't have to
[1:14:41] believe anymore because you're in it

[1:15:39] brother branham is talking about that
[1:15:41] here amen
[1:15:43] about the king of glory coming in and
[1:15:45] being with us he said of course that was
[1:15:48] the lord himself and he led those saints
[1:15:52] when they rose up there
[1:15:55] and he took them back to glory
[1:15:58] and brother branham said as he was
[1:16:00] coming with the hosts of all these
[1:16:02] believers
[1:16:04] and the angels look from the battlement
[1:16:07] of heaven and they see these hosts of
[1:16:10] believers coming
[1:16:12] following him
[1:16:14] and his voice going out to open up the
[1:16:17] gates
[1:16:18] oh my and they stood there say who is
[1:16:21] this lord of glory
[1:16:23] who is this lord that we should open the
[1:16:26] gates and he said the voice answered

[1:17:16] prophets and patriarchs
[1:17:18] and believing saints
[1:17:20] with him
[1:17:22] hallelujah
[1:17:24] praise god i don't know how i didn't see
[1:17:26] it because it's the page that's right in
[1:17:28] front of me when he says here david said
[1:17:31] lift up your everlasting gates be who
[1:17:34] lifted up he let the activity and gave
[1:17:36] gifts to man and they said who is this
[1:17:39] king of glory

[1:18:38] who is the king of glory
[1:18:41] the lord mighty in battle he said in an
[1:18:44] instance them gates flew right open
[1:18:47] and jesus the mighty conqueror led them
[1:18:51] in them that had believed on him
[1:18:55] the word had come to them
[1:18:58] amen praise god look let's not touch on
[1:19:01] that because the word only comes to the
[1:19:04] predestinated vessel of the hour and of
[1:19:08] that age and of that day the word of god
[1:19:12] comes to them
[1:19:13] like it did to mary
[1:19:15] it had could go to no other virgin
[1:19:19] it could only go to
[1:19:20] mary because when his word was spoken
[1:19:24] god already saw her in his mind
[1:19:27] when god spoke of a bride in this age he
[1:19:30] saw you already in his mind
[1:19:33] oh praise god so when the word goes
[1:19:36] forth the word can only go to you
[1:19:40] that's why you could have two in a bed
[1:19:42] one technique on the other left
[1:19:44] so you can have a thousand a church
[1:19:47] and the word goes to one
[1:19:50] and ten more sitting beside that one
[1:19:53] they're hearing the voice but they're
[1:19:54] not catching the revelation of what's
[1:19:56] being said
[1:19:58] because the word was predestinated to go
[1:20:01] to that individual is that right that
[1:20:04] has an ear that has a crystal to pick up
[1:20:07] the word and hear the sound the unseen
[1:20:10] sounds the prophet said radio waves are
[1:20:13] passing through here but you've got to
[1:20:15] have something to be able to pick up the
[1:20:17] waves so you can hear the voice word of
[1:20:20] god and the same way god had to place a
[1:20:24] seed within your soul lord of god so
[1:20:27] that when the word goes forth you just
[1:20:29] don't pick up my voice you don't just
[1:20:32] pick up because i'm quoting quotes but
[1:20:34] the spirit of god in you picks up the
[1:20:37] revelation
[1:20:39] of the word the unwritten word that goes
[1:20:43] between husband and wife that the
[1:20:44] husband don't even have to speak
[1:20:46] sometimes just one look one look and
[1:20:48] she's able to pick up that word right
[1:20:50] away it's the same way we pick up the
[1:20:53] word from the lord jesus christ oh
[1:20:56] hallelujah you say brother simon don't
[1:20:58] get excited
[1:21:00] i can't help it i got to get excited
[1:21:03] oh my god brother sister we are right
[1:21:06] now at the door ready to break in and to
[1:21:10] walk right from one dimension to the
[1:21:12] other
[1:21:13] hallelujah
[1:21:15] listen to those of us who rarely have
[1:21:17] caught the revelation of this last
[1:21:20] prophet's message like he said when he
[1:21:23] said listen i've just finished preaching
[1:21:26] but i noticed the sound went into a
[1:21:28] higher octave
[1:21:30] i want to tell you that's what i'm
[1:21:32] starting to see and hear in those men
[1:21:35] and women that have really caught the
[1:21:38] revelation of this message that thing
[1:21:40] has lifted off now there's fire beneath
[1:21:43] the rocket ship now we left off time
[1:21:47] this is not come down anymore we're in
[1:21:50] the midst of the pillar of fire we're
[1:21:52] being caught up in the presence of

[1:34:35] and then don't keep coming you're
[1:34:37] sending a friend to take it because you

[1:35:41] when the lord gave me this thing i could
[1:35:43] have drawn a wheat seed beside it
[1:35:45] and show you how it goes through the
[1:35:47] same stages and then it goes back to
[1:35:49] what

[1:35:55] stop halfway or part way or when it's

[1:36:59] they don't have a fullness of what we
[1:37:01] are getting every day of what the lord
[1:37:03] is giving us but they were faithful to
[1:37:06] what they knew
[1:37:08] that portion of the world they were
[1:37:10] faithful to that even so the the
[1:37:12] prophets didn't know what we got now but
[1:37:14] they were faithful to that portion they
[1:37:17] had back there and god comes that as
[1:37:20] righteousness hallelujah like in our day

[1:37:33] the same day
[1:37:35] the whole field won't suddenly go gold

[1:37:40] come to this church some people are
[1:37:41] critical they don't understand you come
[1:37:43] to this church there's people in
[1:37:44] different levels of
[1:37:46] of of understanding and of revelation
[1:37:48] and of growth and of maturity and
[1:37:51] somehow ripe some ripe some you know
[1:37:53] some still green and sour
[1:37:57] and different parts of the character
[1:37:59] properly formed oh my praise god and and
[1:38:03] so you've got to understand that it's
[1:38:05] the same thing he said they will know
[1:38:09] when it is time for them to know
[1:38:12] years ago i told you when the holy
[1:38:14] spirit spoke to me one early morning and
[1:38:16] said do not fornicate the word of course
[1:38:20] i don't understand what does that mean
[1:38:22] you may fornicate the word in other
[1:38:24] words
[1:38:25] don't give to someone the word before it
[1:38:29] is their time to receive that word
[1:38:32] they will know when it is time for them
[1:38:35] to know
[1:38:36] and he knows when it's time for them to
[1:38:38] know
[1:38:39] you may be sharing the word with your
[1:38:42] grandmother your grandfather your uncle
[1:38:43] your cousin this person and they're not
[1:38:46] even paying you any mind but the moment
[1:38:48] that time strikes
[1:38:51] what you said boy
[1:38:53] what did you say i you can't believe it
[1:38:55] they won't pay no attention to you all
[1:38:57] this time and all of a sudden now they
[1:38:58] start to grab a hold of it and take the
[1:39:00] whole thing but it's not us forcing this
[1:39:03] word of anybody
[1:39:05] it's not us taking a a rope and lassoing
[1:39:09] people and and
[1:39:10] bring them in the church all tied up and
[1:39:12] ready to be branded no sir but we are
[1:39:15] here to just share the word
[1:39:18] let's all be doing in love
[1:39:21] patience
[1:39:22] virtue
[1:39:24] broadly kindness we just share the word

[1:48:59] one of them said you are now the bishop
[1:49:01] over my whole country i said well thank
[1:49:04] you very much but
[1:49:05] those kinds of bishop is not what i see
[1:49:07] in the bible so
[1:49:09] it's okay
[1:49:10] you see
[1:49:12] that's the thing brothers you've got to
[1:49:13] understand we stay with the world
[1:49:17] we just here to be a blessing not just
[1:49:20] here to build up a big ministry big name
[1:49:22] like i've always said if i wanted to i
[1:49:24] wanted to get thousands of believers
[1:49:26] inside of a big building i could have
[1:49:28] had that but we're not here for a
[1:49:30] thousand we're searching to find god's
[1:49:33] faithful few
[1:49:35] one two three four five amen wherever
[1:49:38] they are whoever they are whether
[1:49:40] they're rich they're poor whether
[1:49:42] they're sick they're blind they're
[1:49:43] troubled we are here with the word
[1:49:47] that's how the prophet taught us
[1:49:49] that's what he left with us
[1:49:51] that's what we left with in this
[1:49:53] storehouse and that's all we can talk
[1:49:55] about is what is in the storehouse but
[1:49:58] be talking from the storehouse don't
[1:50:00] mean that i go and be a parrot
[1:50:03] you read anywhere in the word of god
[1:50:05] where the prophet said behold i call you
[1:50:07] to be a pirate
[1:50:10] brother branham said this brother
[1:50:11] branham said that brother sure he said
[1:50:13] that
[1:50:14] just like every time we don't go say
[1:50:16] paul said this paul said that paul said
[1:50:19] you don't have to do that
[1:50:21] your mother sent you with a message to
[1:50:23] your aunt
[1:50:25] you don't go and that mother said
[1:50:29] that
[1:50:30] this this this and you repeat the
[1:50:32] message word for word
[1:50:34] no you understand the message
[1:50:38] because you understand it you tell the
[1:50:41] person what your mother wants
[1:50:44] is that right
[1:50:45] and this is what a lot of
[1:50:47] believers don't understand they think by
[1:50:49] just quoting the prophet's message that
[1:50:51] gives them power that don't give you no
[1:50:53] power
[1:50:55] none whatsoever you just quoting what he
[1:50:57] said without understanding without
[1:50:58] revelation without the holy spirit back
[1:51:01] of that word amen but we got to have a
[1:51:04] clear revelation
[1:51:06] which he called perfect realization
[1:51:10] when you come to a perfect realization
[1:51:14] and the bible becomes like a new bible
[1:51:16] that spoken word books will become you
[1:51:18] all over again
[1:51:20] there's something talking to you out of
[1:51:22] that word there's something revealing
[1:51:25] itself to you out of that word
[1:51:27] oh praise god if i were to take
[1:51:31] um
[1:51:34] uh some of these brothers uh it's just
[1:51:36] so many things
[1:51:38] um
[1:51:39] jay
[1:51:40] wait a minute
[1:51:42] did you know brother branham i said no
[1:51:44] he said why he said that
[1:51:46] how are you acting like that how are you
[1:51:47] talking like that
[1:51:49] i don't know him i never met him i don't
[1:51:52] have to meet him
[1:51:53] it's like paul said i met a man in the
[1:51:56] spirit well
[1:51:58] i've seen him in
[1:52:00] in various ways
[1:52:02] and watch him come
[1:52:06] and come up to the platform and take my
[1:52:08] notes look at them look at the scripture
[1:52:10] i'm reading
[1:52:13] are are those stung songs in the
[1:52:15] scriptures yes sir
[1:52:17] i'm just saying exactly what you said
[1:52:21] and he looks at them
[1:52:22] they are found in the scriptures
[1:52:25] just keep preaching
[1:52:27] what you're preaching and that's all i'm
[1:52:29] doing
[1:52:32] preach the word
[1:52:33] as simple as that
[1:52:35] and you can call me dummy foolishness
[1:52:38] you can tell me i can speak in a more
[1:52:39] cultured way and that's that sort of
[1:52:42] stuff yeah well it when i was in the
[1:52:44] school that's how they train you you
[1:52:46] have to be ministerial
[1:52:49] you have to have your gestures right
[1:52:51] you have your talk right your pacing
[1:52:54] your cadence your this your that your
[1:52:57] hermeneutics and your apologetics and
[1:52:59] your
[1:53:02] and they've gone down the road with all
[1:53:04] those things but when you understand
[1:53:06] it's satan using those things to draw
[1:53:08] you into a system of
[1:53:10] thinking he's trying to draw you into a
[1:53:13] pattern that he can anticipate
[1:53:16] but the sons and daughters of god god
[1:53:19] bring them out of that so they can move
[1:53:21] as the spirit moves
[1:53:24] and the satan the prophet said in the
[1:53:26] church age book that's what gets him
[1:53:28] angry and mad because revelation he
[1:53:31] can't track he can't trace he can't copy
[1:53:34] he can't imitate because it comes from
[1:53:37] god by grace
[1:53:39] you don't study your way into this you
[1:53:41] say oh i read all the books i've been
[1:53:43] through it for years 40 years that don't
[1:53:46] mean that to god
[1:53:48] amen until he opens your eyes until he
[1:53:51] reveals that word of god to you amen oh
[1:53:54] homecoming day brother praise god we're
[1:53:57] homecoming time now a plane is taking
[1:54:00] you back for your homecoming but we're
[1:54:02] going to have more than a plane amen
[1:54:04] we're going to be taken back to glory by
[1:54:07] the lord himself shall descend with a
[1:54:10] shout the voice of the archangel and the
[1:54:12] trap of god we go into the presence of
[1:54:15] god i'm going to wind this up there's
[1:54:17] more can be said here lots more can be
[1:54:20] said here about joseph bones going back
[1:54:23] when he said don't leave my bones not
[1:54:25] one
[1:54:28] don't leave not one
[1:54:30] i don't care if their experience starts
[1:54:32] to get dried up
[1:54:34] but you take every single bone back with
[1:54:37] you take them back to the land and
[1:54:40] that's the same thing we got to have
[1:54:41] that same attitude we'll take them back
[1:54:44] to the land praise god for his glory
[1:54:47] amen praise god turn in your bibles now

[1:55:02] after all the 144 000 are called after
[1:55:07] the church ages are over
[1:55:09] amen i beheld and law a great multitude
[1:55:14] which no man could number of all nations
[1:55:19] all kindreds and kindreds and people
[1:55:22] and tongues
[1:55:24] stood before the troll
[1:55:26] and before the lamb
[1:55:28] clothed with white robes this is not the
[1:55:30] white throne judgment right because
[1:55:33] they're standing before the lamb here
[1:55:35] amen the throne the lamb clothed with
[1:55:38] white robes which is a symbol of
[1:55:39] righteousness and palms in their hands a
[1:55:43] symbol of an overcomer or a man of peace
[1:55:47] and an
[1:55:48] overcomer that's what the romans used to
[1:55:51] show their victories amen and cried with
[1:55:55] a loud voice saying
[1:55:57] salvation to our god
[1:56:01] who sitted upon the throne and unto the
[1:56:04] lamb
[1:56:05] and all the angels stood round about the
[1:56:08] throne
[1:56:09] and about the elders and four beasts and
[1:56:12] fell before the throne on their faces
[1:56:15] and worshiped god
[1:56:17] saying amen
[1:56:19] blessing
[1:56:21] and glory and wisdom
[1:56:23] and thanksgiving and honor and power and
[1:56:28] might be unto our god forever and for
[1:56:34] ever amen
[1:56:36] and
[1:56:38] and one of the elders answered and
[1:56:41] saying unto me
[1:56:43] what are these
[1:56:44] which are a red and white robes
[1:56:47] and whence came thee
[1:56:50] and i said unto him sardan rest and he
[1:56:54] said to me these are the
[1:56:58] which came out
[1:57:00] of great tribulation
[1:57:02] not out of the great tribulation the
[1:57:05] great tribulation that is yet to come
[1:57:09] but while they were on the earth
[1:57:11] they suffered great tribulation
[1:57:13] they passed through great tribulation
[1:57:16] some of you maybe know what i'm talking
[1:57:18] about maybe you're passing through some
[1:57:20] right now
[1:57:21] pass through great tribulation and have
[1:57:24] washed their robes
[1:57:26] amen they didn't go and go back in the
[1:57:29] world and get it all speckled up and
[1:57:30] messed up and mussed up and dirty up but
[1:57:33] they got
[1:57:35] washed their robes and made them white
[1:57:38] in the blood of the lamb
[1:57:40] therefore are there before the throne of
[1:57:43] god
[1:57:44] and like a wife serves a husband
[1:57:46] and serve him
[1:57:48] day and night
[1:57:50] in his temple and he that sitted on the
[1:57:52] throne shall dwell
[1:57:54] amongst them
[1:57:56] they shall hunger no more
[1:57:59] neither thirst anymore
[1:58:01] neither shall the sun
[1:58:03] light on them
[1:58:05] nor any heat
[1:58:06] for the lamb which is in the midst of
[1:58:08] the throne
[1:58:10] shall feed them
[1:58:12] heal it at me
[1:58:14] o blessed thought
[1:58:16] o praise god and shall lead them
[1:58:20] onto living fountains of waters
[1:58:24] and god shall wipe away
[1:58:27] all
[1:58:28] tears from their eyes
[1:58:30] and you know another scripture says and
[1:58:32] there shall be
[1:58:34] no more
[1:58:35] death
[1:58:38] when i was a boy
[1:58:42] my parents
[1:58:44] were christians in the sense that they
[1:58:46] believed the bible
[1:58:50] my grandfather

[1:59:02] nine or ten
[1:59:05] and told him to go and cry out against
[1:59:07] mr babylon
[1:59:09] and identify the catholic church
[1:59:12] and i thank god was a witness
[1:59:15] when he was preaching in front of a
[1:59:17] catholic
[1:59:19] a cathedral
[1:59:20] and the police came and carried him away
[1:59:23] i seen it with these eyes

[1:59:54] they would sing hymns
[1:59:56] sing songs and read the scriptures gets
[1:59:59] us to memorize scripture at home
