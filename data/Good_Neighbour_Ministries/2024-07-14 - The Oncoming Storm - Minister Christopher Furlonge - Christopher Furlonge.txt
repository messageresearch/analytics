so my little title this morning is the oncoming storm amen and we want to read from Matthew chapter 7 24- 27 therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them I will lighten him unto a wise man amen so if you're wise this morning you're going to hearken to God's Worden which built his house upon a Rock Amen and we know who that rock is that rock you got to have an experience Hallelujah to be on that Rock Amen Hallelujah and the rain descended and the floods came and every single life some rain is going to fall you're going to get the floods of the This Life coming around you Hallelujah and the winds blew and beat upon that house for it was founded upon a rock and everyone that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not amen shall be likened unto a foolish man God word God's word word is going forth this morning haen onto his words amen which built his rock as house upon the sand Hallelujah and the rains descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it our another scripture reading was take is taken from Luke 1726 to 30 Hallelujah very familiar scripture as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives listen to this they married wives not just one many and they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came here's another flood again man and Destroy them some no all Hallelujah likewise also amen see if you're not into the Ark of Safety you're going to be destroyed Hallelujah you know you've been hearing preaching all these years amen all these years you've been hearing the word of God what did it come for what did God's word come for to warn you and get you prepared Hallelujah there is an uncoming storm are you prepared to to meet that storm think about it every single individual here it's an individual matter it's not what your mom prepared not what your dad prepared not what the preacher prepared the Deacon prepared it's your own preparation amen you know there have there's a song in that they sing in the island take warning take warning you better be good but this is not just only being good I know you got to make preparations deep within your heart think deep today if that storm should hit your life today are you prepared are you getting prepared right likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought their soul they planted the build but the same day see before amen we not jump ahead but in the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and Destroy them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is being revealed you all may be seated hallelujah praise the Lord you know when God came in every time that God visited this world whether it be a prophet whether it was him himself God Amen was rejected all the time by the world but it's only for those who have eyes to see him in their day would receive him Hallelujah see God always come into world but when he did the world hated him but before God comes and does anything he always sends a message did God send a message for this day amen hallelujah have you heard that message have you hearkened onto that message amen hallelujah he always sends warning to get things ready before judgment strike amen man we have preachers you know you've been hearing preaching all these years all these years all all these years amen oh I hear that already no I listen to that sermon already but

Stone to preach said no God tell me to warn you all a flood is coming but Noah you know that the scientists say that there's nothing that that that it is impossible amen hallelujah do you think it is impossible for God right now to destroy this world man just it was in the days of now the people disel God and you know some Christians they like to play nearest line Believers you know we had a little uh a fun time when we were growing up we played nearest line so we we set up a like a safe station and you got to run around and we will hide something and you got to find it but if you get caught you're going you're going in jail right but if you're at home you're safe but some of them I'm so smart they want to stay close to home so if you know they're coming to catch you you just jump

you're going to go across and you're going to be safe on the other side Hallelujah absolutely amen that's his word that's his promise for you today hallelujah praise God thank you Lord praise God so

praise God hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord I want to take another example from the Bible from the word of God going to speak a little about Rahab you look at rahab's life no to the Christian world oh my she was a nobody and nothing a harlot a prostitute man they would despise her in every way possible amen but you know Rahab she knew that judgment was going to strike Jericho she knew and heard about the destruction that the children of Israel were doing around Jericho and all the surrounding lands and kings and you know they were not uh uh what you might say uh people that were uh TR rained in Warfare man they were walking through the Wilderness in sandals and those sanders never wore outen they never got sick they didn't had no Atomic power Spears and chariots and all the soldiers thousands and thousands upon soldiers you know to fight for them Jericho was a City built with 20ft walls walls wide that chariots could ride around around it well fortified man so they thought that they were safe just like this world the people here in America oh we got Atomic we got Warfare we got just jet fighters we got this missile we got this Dome to protect us we have this that and here to protect but listen God can penetrate every single weapon that they have amen amen one word of prayer is a prayer missile Hallelujah got destroy the enemy camp amen amen hallelujah you know we have a prayer a Friday night prayer service do we and that's where we get fortified amen amen that's where we going to be training our Weaponry yeah and a lot of us fail to be there I just got to speak the truth t you know we want to use the Lord as a as a paramedic know use him only in the time of emergency I got to speak the truth that you call upon him only when you have an emergency situation or you use him as a spear Tire when you have a flat in your life you see the prayer service every single one of us needs to have a prayer life and a life of prayer it might be hitting home hard amen but serious business serious we need to be a prayer people fortify your soul that when the storms of life come around you you don't have to be rushing to the Deacon rushing to the pastor you have your own weapons start up to be used against the enemy hallelujah it's simple like that or no you a a surrendered vessel in God is a majority you know man you got the word of God in your mouth and to bind and rebuke every single demonic PA so when your child is sick in 1 2 3 in the morning and you don't have time to call the Deacon or the minister or some brother or sister you got to lay hands on them right there and rebuke that devil amen hallelujah prove God in your own home in your own life that whence the enemy attack you at home at your job anywhere you got call Upon Jesus and he's right there amen hallelujah thank you Lord praise God so you see Rahab heard about the destruction that was happening all around Jericho and when she heard that they were coming to Jericho her heart start to get faint just as the people because they knew that this God that the Israelites were serving could open a red sea and they could walk through it she knew that they could be fed from Mana from Heaven just as you and I have been fed today Hallelujah am fresh Mana every day yesen Hallelujah that God could have raised up a brass Serpent and heal every sickness or disease that happen around themen they were walking through the desert with their sandal and their feet and it never were out so she knew that these people had a supernatural God and fear Came Upon her heart yes the god that you serving isn't he Supernatural am you got to proen for yourself thank you Jesus that he is Supernatural Hallelujah blessed be his wonderful name so you see Joshua sent out two spies out to Jericho he said no two preachers to spy out the land and who home they could she could they could have land up inen into rahab's home you mean two preachers going into a harlot house a prostitute house imagine what them would be saying out there just think about it that is going to be such a disgrace but you know what they God knew the receptive heart that she had amen because the way she was living amen wasn't her fault it was conditions around her life that caused her to be like that and so many of us amen hallelujah we've been serving we've been in prostitution to the word of God going to this church to that church amen amen hallelujah man just like Rahab was but God know where that predestinated seed was God knew where that receptive heart was just as you and I today amen that God could have sent forth his word to her and she received it just as you and I have received the revealed word for this hour H with a receptive heart and and God honored her amen hallelujah amen by man promising her that if she displayed the token that red Scarlet C Amen on her home amen she going to be saved but you know something she didn't keep it for herself or no she invited her whole family and anyone who harkened to that call and was there at that time under that red scarlet cord would be saved amen amen hallelujah God sent the the the children to March seven times around amen seven Church you got some types here amen hallelujah seven times are wrong six times they March around and around but they must have laughed at them 20 foot walls so high what's the matter with them a noise bunch of making people singing and shouting Hallelujah that's what it be saying about you and I you know that church I go to they to be shouting Hallelujah and jumping up and singing and clapping and making a whole set of noise like a bunch of confusion you know something Hallelujah by they marching th th pum they didn't realizing the marching was weakening all them walls shaking them shaking them Stone secretly amen and and the seventh showout the seventh time Shout to the Lord all he Saints amen hallelujah and the walls came tumbling down but you know something where Rahab was Rahab had a penth house know she had one of the the the the top most priority places on the walls of Jericho and amen because the life she must have been living they all knew where reab was she was like a light house are Tower amen every single Stone fell around a house and not one stone on our house where that scarlet cord was was shooken hallelujah thank you Jesus are you keeping this gospel to yourself brother you got it right we got to tell our loved ones man there is an uncoming storm and I like to warn you I like to let you know man that this storm that is coming man this world will never see they have never seen it and will never see it again amen this storm that is coming upon this world man you got to be prepared for it and God has made a preparation for us for you and I that if you can receive his word his warning for this hour and get into the safety zone you're going to be saved you going to be safe hallelujah amen I thank the Lord for his word today amen for encouraging our hearts today Hallelujah that through the life of rhab amen hallelujah hallelujah it was an example for us a simple woman amen and nobody as they may say you and I are nobody man God chose you his eyes are upon you you are the apple of his eye when were you chosen 39 years ago 50 years ago 20 years ago last week man Hallelujah God saw you before the foundations of the world and he placed a germ seed of himself in you and in the fullness of time in his time he knows when to call that seed you say I going to call you know no preacher could call you or know no no no man could call you know God does the calling man I call my sheep and they going to answer and he call you by your name amen hallelujah and you're going to know that voice you're going to know that call amen because you know why you heard that call you heard that voice before Hallelujah when you were there shouting for joy as job job do it amen he knew that voice he knew that shout amen hallelujah so when he call he calls you you're going to respond you can't run away from it you cannot run away from it Hallelujah bless blessed be the name of the Lord amen thank you Lord praise the name of his wonderful praise His wonderful name amen you know Rahab she typed the Gentile Church she was a gentile amen and when she heard the message we were all out in spiritual prostitution man committing spiritual fornication against the god of Heaven in all kind of stuff in all kinds of denomination and religions but when we heard that there was a God that still lived amen that he's a miracle working God Amen we quickly receive and respond to his word and his message Hallelujah and I thank God that we are here that we can receive that word and this message amen hallelujah and we saw how Rahab displayed the token and the token is not to be just hidden inside of your life hidden up your life got to be a living testimony being displayed to the world Hallelujah just as Rahab did she wasn't ashamed know to put that red Scarlet the very sad thing that they were criticizing and and letting her know listen you're you're advertising in for what amen you're portraying what RAB but the very sad thing that they were criticizing the very said thing saved her and the Very God that you say Amen that you're saving that's saving you and they're being critical about it is the very God that's going to save you and to anyone that receiv received him hallelujah praise God thank you Lord oh praise God praise God praise God hallelujah amen and if you could go to into the life of Noah a little biten God give me about five to eight more minutes amen praise God don't want to keep you too long my name is for long but I'm not going to keep you to know little humor is good you know keep you alert you know by these things you will remember Hallelujah we saw Noah's life he preached for 120 years as we said and he had one message man that a flood was coming to destroy the worlden scientific research you know they

only living in a little thin layer like this and on all Bel beneath us is just fire and brimstone amen just like how God open up the flood gates in the time of Noah from beneath man God can do the

it already split one atom man and it's all God's creation and they using to destroy them own their own selves amen and as we see as it was in the days of lot what happened in the days of lot man

around what a condition terrible most sodic condition around us amen hallelujah but under the Covenant Angel God was able to turn his back man and discern his thoughts of Sarah's heart to discern the thoughts of Abraham's wife's heart and in this s day God had displayed that sent a prophet man excuse me that could discern the hearts of the people amen some of them CR being critical they say it's
