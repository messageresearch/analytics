[12:28] let us all together
[12:53] you're not praise god that's a wonderful
[12:56] report you can see what's going on out
[13:00] there this is the time where God is
[13:06] dealing and perfecting his church he's
[13:09] dealing with the Bride of Christ
[13:11] wherever she might be and you know here
[13:17] there there's you know deacons rising up
[13:19] in the church that are plotting against
[13:22] the pastor's all kinds of stuff that's
[13:25] going on but you know when God sends his
[13:27] ambassadors they come acquainted with
[13:31] his spirit and then all of a sudden
[13:34] things can easily get exposed you you
[13:37] don't realize what you are and who you
[13:40] are you are ambassadors of God God
[13:44] anoints you and places human - the body
[13:47] of Christ is because he's planning about
[13:50] using you to perfect this church and to
[13:53] the drum to get it prepared to
[13:57] accomplish that which we know is going
[14:00] to take place which is the rapture amen
[14:03] uh spot over here amen praise God Pastor
[14:07] Simon is in New Mexico he's ministering
[14:09] there
[14:13] he met while he was in Colombia and they
[14:16] established the relationship and he was
[14:18] asked to go to Mexico and so continue to
[14:22] pray for him and we'll be back on
[14:24] Tuesday by the grace of God and trust
[14:28] that the Lord will just do whatever it
[14:30] is that he needs for sending us where he
[14:38] says this but this morning we've come
[14:40] together because we're interested in
[14:43] what God has because that's what excites
[14:51] children of God and that we're not just
[14:54] a normal Church this is not just another
[14:57] Christian Church mystery we have
[15:01] something fresh something new because
[15:05] God is a living God
[15:06] that's a president we don't have any of
[15:08] our own thoughts right it is we just
[15:10] want to we just want to convey what the
[15:12] Lord lays upon our heart see even God
[15:15] has a five-fold mystery in this our
[15:17] that's anointed to do the work that
[15:21] needs to be done in order to get this
[15:23] church placed into each position us
[15:28] please seem so that he can he can seal
[15:32] it up you know we're gonna be looking at
[15:34] that you know I just had such a
[15:36] wonderful time you know when study
[15:38] yesterday last night I just I read and I
[15:42] listened while I was reading you know
[15:44] the beauty of the table you know you
[15:46] don't you know the table up is that you
[15:49] can actually read and listen to the
[15:52] Prophet as he speaks and it just it just
[15:54] brings it in such a different way like
[15:57] you know try it do it and just get along
[16:01] you know
[16:02] I just rejoiced in the Lord last night
[16:04] listening to the adoption fourth book in
[16:08] the adoption series and it was just
[16:12] tremendous I cannot convey to you what
[16:15] the Holy Spirit revealed to me
[16:19] personally because this is a personal
[16:22] walk with God but you need to get into
[16:26] that realm of faith where you know that
[16:28] God is moving individuals right now
[16:33] this is a personal block this is a walk
[16:36] with God it's it's important that you
[16:39] recognize that that's how it is that God
[16:41] is bringing this church together he's
[16:45] dealing with individuals and he's
[16:47] bringing those individuals together to
[16:49] unite in the body of Christ because once
[16:53] you unite under this revelation of the
[16:56] present truth you'll be seeing let's go
[17:02] to the message
[17:12] so our title this morning is the rapture
[17:16] the Bible it's part five we are
[17:19] continuing along the same thought you
[17:22] know it's been a tremendous time for me
[17:26] just in the study of all these books of
[17:31] the adoption and the book of Ephesians
[17:35] you know you really need to go back and
[17:37] read the book of Ephesians after hearing
[17:40] after you know receiving the Word of God
[17:43] through these services I believe that
[17:46] there's a revival that's taking place
[17:48] right now that's reviving people
[17:51] individuals in the message that in the
[17:54] message for years years they turn about
[17:57] the rapture you know but but this is a
[18:00] progressive revelation that God is
[18:03] taking us at moving us into so that we
[18:06] can receive perfect faith individually
[18:09] and so that we can when they operate in
[18:11] our office were not the bulletins
[18:13] because we just joined the church or we
[18:15] you know because we just belong to a
[18:17] church it's because you've recognized
[18:19] that you are the church you are the body
[18:23] of Jesus Christ if you are the the one
[18:27] that he talked about when he talked to
[18:28] by the scriptures that I'm gonna have a
[18:31] church without spot or wrinkle and that
[18:35] is the church that he's working on right
[18:37] now the individuals that he's worth
[18:39] amen and so the title of this morning in
[18:44] this fifth series of the fifth part in
[18:46] this series is the spirit and the bride
[18:49] say company
[18:51] next the scripture says this morning
[18:55] that's all steady
[18:57] it's from revelations 22 verse 17 and we
[19:04] read here and the spirit and the bride
[19:07] say come
[19:08] and let him that heareth say come you
[19:12] know you you know care what what is it
[19:15] that you're hearing him back here so
[19:17] he's he's showing here that there's a
[19:19] spirit and then there's the bride but
[19:22] the bride needs to hear something that
[19:25] he is speaking so that she now can sing
[19:29] the same thing you know read the
[19:33] scripture and Emmas let's get on a
[19:35] description what the Lord wants to
[19:37] reveal to us this morning and then him
[19:40] that heareth say come and that him that
[19:43] is athirst come so you could be somebody
[19:46] that's not quite there yet you know
[19:48] you're wondering but you've been you've
[19:50] been serving the Lord for many many
[19:52] years and you want to come to that place
[19:54] where God becomes a reality you as an
[19:57] individual in that you can you can
[19:59] actually be a part of what God is doing
[20:02] amen and he says it's so cute if you're
[20:04] thirsty and you come also and whosoever
[20:07] will let him take the water of life
[20:11] freely this is free this is the water of
[20:16] God's Word upon his election scene
[20:20] [Music]
[20:22] father we thank you this more to be Lord
[20:26] we are excited about your word father
[20:28] because we know that you come into the
[20:30] midst of your children when we gather of
[20:33] this revelation that you've placed in
[20:36] our hearts that there's a church in
[20:39] April of 2019 this body is all over the
[20:46] earth it's not just here our good
[20:48] neighbor ministries but it's a body
[20:50] that's called earlier but because you
[20:53] are the same yesterday today forever you
[20:57] are revealing one truth you are not the
[21:00] author of confusion you are bringing
[21:03] forth the word that is going to get this
[21:05] bride ready and prepared so that we can
[21:08] go to the next stage of our ministry
[21:12] blessed prosper
[21:14] Lord remember our pastor this morning as
[21:17] he brings forth the word in the Mexico
[21:19] may you anoint him and use him in a
[21:22] supernatural way Lord let there be light
[21:25] in this hour of bring darkness Lord take
[21:30] control of mind the speaker in here and
[21:34] take us into heavenly places in Jesus
[21:36] presence
[21:41] praise God what a wonderful scripture
[21:49] the next says here for the premise know
[21:54] this is that the description that we
[21:56] took that we've been working with all
[21:58] over the series and just you and him the
[22:02] whole building this is the amplified
[22:04] version in him the whole building is
[22:08] journi together and rises to become a
[22:11] holy temple in the Lord the whole
[22:14] building you too are being built
[22:21] together to become a bully in which God
[22:25] Blizz by this spirit praise God and so
[22:30] you as individuals are being filled with
[22:34] the same spirit that was impressed
[22:36] because the body doesn't have a
[22:39] different spirit there's only one body
[22:41] and you know we've talked about how God
[22:43] is restoring what he had back to the
[22:46] Garden of Eden when he desired to
[22:48] express himself onto this earth because
[22:52] we're here still hurt right and so when
[22:56] he expressed himself here on earth he
[22:58] did so by expressing which was in His
[23:02] image and just like gardening if the
[23:18] church is mrs. Jesus and so this body
[23:26] now is what body we're not looking for
[23:29] you know different interpretations we're
[23:32] looking for what interpretation of the
[23:35] Word of God that is going to bring the
[23:37] church together into one body she would
[23:39] be filled with the Spirit of God and
[23:42] she's going to be anointed to be a
[23:45] change from Mortal to immortal that's
[23:50] what the rapture is all about praise God
[23:53] so this is an earthly plan so we have to
[23:56] come into our earthly position as sons
[24:00] and daughters of God placed into the
[24:02] body of Christ and then receive an
[24:05] anointing on our lives here on earth you
[24:08] as an individual here on earth listen
[24:11] you're gonna have listen we have a
[24:12] ministry right now but there is going to
[24:15] be a progression to this ministry that
[24:17] is it's going to be a miraculous
[24:20] ministry it's going to have miracles
[24:23] signs and wonders just before we leave
[24:26] here there's going to be a great display
[24:27] of this attention because God is going
[24:30] to indicate to this whole Christian
[24:33] world and the whole world in general
[24:36] because of all these different teachings
[24:38] Buddha must woman all these are the top
[24:41] is the one and only true God and that he
[24:45] was behalf of people here on this earth
[24:47] that he was going to vindicate his work
[24:50] through and so you can receive this and
[24:53] and be positionally placed into that
[24:56] body you are going to be a supernatural
[24:59] race you were going to be a supernatural
[25:02] people you can do supernatural things
[25:06] you're already doing supernatural things
[25:09] if you haven't noticed it but it's
[25:11] already happening
[25:13] praise God next slide brotherbrother
[25:17] says here we've got a ministry Cody
[25:19] that's just exactly like the life of
[25:23] Christ is what we're talking about what
[25:26] does that ministry identify it
[25:29] identifies the coming of the Lord
[25:31] that's what did I bet about God is going
[25:35] to show himself the Lord Jesus is going
[25:37] to show himself in a church here on this
[25:40] earth before we leave to prove that he
[25:44] didn't have a ritual true church because
[25:50] he got so many different denominations
[25:52] out there you don't know what to believe
[25:54] but bodies that have indicated through
[25:57] the manifestations of the sons of God
[25:59] that he has a true church not that
[26:02] saying good neighbor ministries is the
[26:04] only church if you've come here this
[26:08] morning with the idea that these all may
[26:11] be this church here you know they think
[26:13] that there's something better than
[26:15] anybody else or that they've got you
[26:17] know they know that's not what this is
[26:19] about we assemble here we are not an
[26:22] organization
[26:25] of the Botox if you want to know about
[26:29] two paper ministries it's very simple
[26:32] open the book of Acts and look exactly
[26:35] what the Apostles did while they were
[26:37] anointed by the Holy Spirit that's why
[26:41] we baptize us because he hoped to the
[26:45] book of Acts the only baptized athletes
[26:47] they didn't baptize children they
[26:51] baptized individuals that said what
[26:54] prevents me from being baptized because
[26:56] they heard the word the Spirit of Truth
[26:59] they heard the Holy Spirit Jesus said
[27:03] what when when I was send you the
[27:06] comforter the comfortablee to indict you
[27:09] into all truth and there's only one way
[27:13] that man was ever baptized according to
[27:16] the scriptures and that wasn't the name
[27:18] of the Lord Jesus Christ that's why we
[27:21] get baptized we do it not because we
[27:24] think it's the right way to do it not
[27:26] because the word says so and if the word
[27:29] has been an honor the word that we as
[27:32] individuals have to manifest what the
[27:35] word says that's why when somebody says
[27:37] to me
[27:38] doesn't matter I see well you have to
[27:42] take that up with the work because I see
[27:47] very clearly in the word that you need
[27:50] to repent which means to turn away from
[27:53] your teachings your thoughts your ideas
[27:56] of your interpretation of God's birth
[27:59] and you need to come to us provided with
[28:02] in the book of Acts chapter 2 verse 38
[28:05] when Peter was filled with the Holy
[28:08] Ghost and come out ministering to the
[28:10] people 3,000 individuals all kinds of
[28:15] different interpretations of God the
[28:28] Lord Jesus Christ the Lord Jesus Christ
[28:39] in the scripture I believe you can't
[28:42] show it to me it's nowhere to be found
[28:45] well that Jesus had preached to all
[28:49] nations in the name of the Father and of
[28:52] the Son and of the Holy Spirit that's
[28:54] exactly what he said but he also said
[28:58] just before that he said all power has
[29:02] been given unto me in heaven and other
[29:07] Ana
[29:08] he did say some power because some
[29:11] people say oh you know that there's
[29:12] three coffee odors the Trinity no such
[29:14] thing as a traitor it's done he said all
[29:19] Papa even say a third part of it
[29:22] he said all power and they lived up to
[29:24] me it was the Lord Jesus speaking
[29:27] Matthew 28 you know all the power that
[29:31] means there's no other power anywhere
[29:32] else it's all in him
[29:35] the people in the remember Peter was
[29:37] right there these ten 2720 will be when
[29:40] he was resurrected Peter was right there
[29:42] listening said yeah I know exactly what
[29:45] you're saying
[29:46] you are the Messiah you are the Christ
[29:51] Jesus and that's why he talked to the
[30:29] basics this morning but you see if you
[30:34] don't have the foundation right you can
[30:38] never build anything but it's gonna fall
[30:41] you're gonna be on a sinking sand if you
[30:44] don't have a proper foundation which is
[30:46] a rock a solid rock of revelation that
[30:49] God is one God his name is the Lord
[30:52] Jesus Christ the scripture says in all
[30:54] that you do in word or deed do it off
[30:59] and make you
[31:01] [Music]
[31:02] so now you've got a good foundation to
[31:05] start with now you can build something
[31:06] that we can move on and you can actually
[31:09] receive the word and actually be placed
[31:12] and adopted into the body for the church
[31:34] to positionally find its place that's
[31:42] the rapture the Holy Spirit displays
[31:47] God's power through each of us as a
[31:51] means of the entire church you see what
[31:58] is saying there that this body that
[32:03] receives the Holy Ghost you as an
[32:06] individual like you were placed into
[32:09] that body position and upgrading my
[32:13] faith in that body it actually
[32:17] identifies the entire church it brings
[32:21] the entire church on the scene that's
[32:24] why you're so important that's why you
[32:27] know he couldn't leave on this series
[32:30] and the water I look at it the more I
[32:32] see how rather than informant is for
[32:35] each and every one of us to see our
[32:36] positions in the Word of God our
[32:40] spiritual disease next but the writer
[32:44] says here here is the secret the word is
[32:50] in the prop and the muscle of Christ to
[32:54] know what he was done with
[32:58] see how can you know what God wants done
[33:01] with the word if you're not even in the
[33:04] body because this is this is the body
[33:12] [Music]
[33:19] and seen this to do i cannot communicate
[33:27] to your body and tell us what to do
[33:30] yeah we cool it with aerobics class by
[33:32] the same timeframe or whatever you would
[33:35] do all that I'm talking about the unseen
[33:38] the thoughts the revelation of God when
[33:42] it comes to the body it's making its
[33:45] mystery though to the body
[33:47] Christ we've read in the book of
[33:49] Ephesians how God is making his this
[33:52] mystery known to the body because this
[33:55] is not going to be a public show this is
[33:57] not going to be because everything is
[34:00] given like like you can go to google
[34:02] search and say how do I go throughout
[34:03] you don't get a thousand different
[34:09] interpretations of that because it'll be
[34:12] all kinds of different Christian
[34:13] teachings but what the Holy Spirit gives
[34:18] you a divine revelation because you're
[34:21] in the body of Christ and you and you
[34:24] now have the mind of Christ because
[34:25] that's what it says here to know what he
[34:28] wants
[34:28] the word and she doesn't in his name she
[34:32] has thus saith the Lord then jerk that
[34:38] it is germanized so Holy Spirit waters
[34:41] it until it is brother that serves his
[34:44] purpose
[34:45] right there is the book of Ephesians
[34:48] because you have in you the Spirit of
[34:52] God which he says now he places thus
[34:55] saith the Lord into this last church
[34:58] because she has a great part to play in
[35:01] the rapture she has to speak because she
[35:06] is Christ in pride for remember he gets
[35:09] restored after those restored when
[35:11] Christ came to the earth he has to be
[35:14] restored in these last days which is to
[35:16] church the bride the other part that has
[35:20] blood with God which is one of the price
[35:22] and she is given that same Authority
[35:25] she's given that same lady to speak the
[35:30] Word of God in order to speak the
[35:33] rapture into existence you see you think
[35:43] you know like a little bit you know I
[35:47] speak something you know or you know
[35:50] when you're you know most the time you
[35:52] don't you realize what you're speaking
[35:54] the word I'll tell you right now most of
[35:58] the time unless you're able to keep you
[36:01] here in Europe your lives through this
[36:02] and God comes to you shows you certain
[36:05] things you know that you're bringing
[36:06] forth but as individuals all performing
[36:11] our parents and our purposes there's
[36:13] times where you'll fellowship
[36:15] you'll speak to somebody and the word is
[36:18] being revealed through you it's being
[36:20] spoken
[36:21] it'll get spoken to our children and we
[36:24] think all but we've got to see it come
[36:25] to pass ran away mm it needs to be
[36:30] [Music]
[36:37] that's been spoken to this situation
[37:13] [Music]
[37:20] [Music]
[37:49] felt blessed a couple of that fell or
[37:53] inspired by the love of a cop it changed
[37:57] me in my attitudes in the way that I
[38:00] look at situations the way that we
[38:02] perceive situations maybe you know
[38:04] because you're still human you are a
[38:07] human being as long as you are on this
[38:10] earth you are going to be in a human
[38:12] vessel and you are going to be
[38:14] susceptible to mistakes do things you're
[38:18] gonna say things there's gonna be things
[38:20] about you sometimes it's not you it's
[38:24] not it's like all of that each of us has
[38:54] a heart each person alive as a slightly
[38:58] different pattern she to the level
[39:00] you're not there's not one of you that's
[39:03] exactly the same everybody's got a
[39:05] different DNA God didn't create clothes
[39:10] not created sons and daughters God has
[39:15] given each of us a unique emotional
[39:19] perfect people get to know we have
[39:24] obviously very passionate you tell me
[39:29] you do become free sighs well that's we
[39:33] got nothing then you talk to this one
[39:37] where you come you never know about this
[39:39] person's thing because they don't feel
[39:41] any emotion at all you want to get a
[39:44] stethoscope
[39:48] you see God's decided everybody
[39:51] differently all he in a certain way but
[39:54] God now for the body of Christ there's a
[39:58] reason why he dealt with the heart
[40:00] there's a reason why when we look at the
[40:04] scripture we don't look at a few
[40:05] scriptures this morning how God is
[40:07] dealing and he says that each of us has
[40:10] a unique emotional therapy that races
[40:13] when we encounter activities subjects
[40:16] circumstances that interest us we
[40:22] instinctively feel deeply about
[40:24] something's and not so deeply about
[40:27] these are natural things that are likely
[40:30] to recognize because it has to do with
[40:33] your position in the body
[40:34] keep your thinking caps argue the body
[40:38] uses the term heart to represent the
[40:42] sector of your motivation desires and
[40:45] inclinations next the scripture says
[40:51] delight yourself in the Lord and He will
[40:54] give you the desires of your heart
[40:56] you know that if you look at desires the
[40:59] word desire means of the Father these
[41:03] are things that God places in union and
[41:06] and like you said you know there's
[41:08] listen if you are a son or a daughter of
[41:12] God it's because we're an attribute of
[41:15] God may be a sucker in the heart of God
[41:18] never had a beginning because it is a
[41:22] part of God and God is eternal
[41:25] directness and to try to make simplicity
[41:27] earth God is eternal so if you are a son
[41:31] of God then you are eternal also you are
[41:34] just
[41:34] and actually that was expressed from God
[41:37] you're still a part of God forgive me
[41:40] and you are actually a God as an
[41:45] individual not be thought but as the Son
[41:48] of God you are a part and so as
[41:52] individuals
[41:53] God is not attribute because there's not
[41:58] enough everybody that's out there
[42:00] there's people in the world that are not
[42:04] sons and daughters of God I can show you
[42:06] this picture that I'm not telling you
[42:08] something that's not in the scripture
[42:10] yet there are children of the light
[42:13] somebody talks about children of the
[42:16] darkness God is right there is children
[42:20] of God the Bible talks about and then
[42:22] there are children of the devil because
[42:25] in the dirt revealeth with with the sin
[42:28] took place there was two children born
[42:30] in blood was born as be salt of the
[42:33] serpent
[42:34] that's why spell serpent seed that's why
[42:37] it had enmity against his brother Cain
[42:41] and Abel Katie was the serpent seed Abel
[42:44] Abel was son of God you should be in the
[42:48] scripture where it said cables the Sun
[42:49] duck awfully word said Abel us you see
[42:54] nothing on the description and what
[42:58] happens even God at the scene of the
[43:00] death killed his brother
[43:04] because it was a murderer from the
[43:06] beginning and it's just that simple
[43:08] thing you talk to people about the dog
[43:11] surfing if what they love with the
[43:14] distant he didn't give her an apple he
[43:19] gave her his interpretation of how to
[43:22] bring forth children on how to multiply
[43:27] how to be a creator
[43:29] she saved is an impersonator God created
[43:34] by the smoke or Satan created by
[43:38] procreation I've taken a serpent using
[43:41] the hip and the serpent was an upright
[43:43] beam that was very close to to man but
[43:48] he wasn't quite that a very close that
[43:51] he could actually mingle you could talk
[43:55] he wasn't bringing it over here sometime
[44:01] I'd like to see him but they said no the
[44:05] circle was a snake he talked about
[44:07] telling you the serpent was an upright
[44:09] being that was just almost perfectly
[44:12] better and he had the ability to make
[44:15] love to eat and say no eating create we
[44:19] can be like God because Satan is always
[44:21] trying to be like God we can create so
[44:24] he he it took Eve and he shook her sex
[44:28] she got her pregnant
[44:30] she went out of Anatomy exactly as his
[44:33] old fix this thing so he had to take on
[44:38] just took on Scylla to redeem you
[44:44] [Music]
[44:47] and so he did the same thing but you see
[44:52] Adam was a southern cop and he just had
[44:58] the ability to bring forth after his
[45:05] glory to God you see and so this all
[45:09] planned now is up because God has sons
[45:13] of God attributes and he reserved the
[45:17] place in the body something let's
[45:55] continue
[45:56] so delight yourself in the desires of
[46:00] your heart
[46:01] next scripture back in 1235 a good man
[46:05] out of the good treasure of the heart
[46:07] bringeth forth good things an evil man
[46:12] of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil
[46:16] things you see that's why you look evil
[46:26] [Music]
[46:29] because this hasn't been transformed it
[46:31] hasn't been perfect it has it it doesn't
[46:34] have representation it doesn't have the
[46:37] representation of Christ in there and
[46:40] that's right
[46:41] you know you as individuals you know
[46:44] sometimes we eat you got a check you got
[46:47] search your heart about situations and
[46:50] circumstances they can deal with as a
[46:52] son of God that's your heart determines
[46:59] why you say the things you do why do
[47:04] people pleading to do for the word God
[47:08] is alive and active sharper than any
[47:11] double-edged sword it penetrates even to
[47:15] the dividing soul and spirit joints and
[47:19] marrow it judges the thoughts and the
[47:21] attitudes of the and so you as an
[47:27] individual you wonder why you act or you
[47:30] say some
