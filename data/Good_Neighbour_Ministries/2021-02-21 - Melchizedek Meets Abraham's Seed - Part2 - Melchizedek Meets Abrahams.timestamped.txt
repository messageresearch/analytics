[1:16] king of salem priest of the most
[1:21] high god who met abraham returning
[1:27] from the slaughter of the kings
[1:32] and blessed him to whom
[1:36] also abraham gave
[1:39] a tenth part of all
[1:44] first being by interpretation
[1:47] king of righteousness and
[1:50] after that king of salem which is
[1:54] king of peace without father
[1:58] without mother without
[2:01] descent having
[2:05] neither beginning of days
[2:09] nor end of life
[2:12] but made like unto the
[2:15] son of god abided

[3:15] we give you the glory for this service
[3:17] today
[3:19] wherever this this sermon goes
[3:22] this message goes out let
[3:25] my hearts be touched
[3:29] may eyes be opened may
[3:32] lies be changed and
[3:35] most of all may you be glorified
[3:40] for we ask it all in the name of our
[3:44] blessed lord
[3:45] jesus christ amen praise the lord
[3:51] now last week
[3:54] we spoke about the great
[3:58] melchizedek and
[4:01] we discovered that melchizedek
[4:05] was and is actually god himself
[4:10] for it was god himself
[4:14] forming himself
[4:18] coming down from spirit form
[4:22] of being god
[4:26] coming into human flesh
[4:29] but in between spirit form
[4:33] and flesh god went
[4:36] into a state called the theophany
[4:40] a theophany body
[4:44] or a word body
[4:48] a word form body
[4:51] while he was in that theophany
[4:55] he was called mel cassidy
[4:59] back in those days of abraham
[5:02] this man seemed to appear out of nowhere
[5:09] they could not trace his descent
[5:12] as the scriptures that we just read
[5:16] they could not find his beginning
[5:20] they could not find his end
[5:23] they did not know where he came from
[5:25] what was his descent
[5:28] what was his genealogy there was
[5:31] no trace whatsoever for it
[5:35] and they could never find it for that
[5:39] person was god himself
[5:43] forming himself down
[5:46] coming down into
[5:50] flesh so between spirit
[5:56] and coming down he became a theophany
[6:01] then from the theophany god begins to
[6:05] end morphe himself
[6:09] coming into flesh
[6:12] which later when he got into that flesh
[6:18] he was named and called jesus christ
[6:25] jesus christ was really the flesh
[6:29] body or the flesh form
[6:33] of melchizedek which
[6:36] and who of course was god himself
[6:40] for in the beginning was the word
[6:44] and the word was with god
[6:48] and the word was god
[6:52] god was in christ reconciling
[6:56] the world unto himself
[7:00] jesus said i and my father
[7:03] are one not two not three not four
[7:07] one amen when you
[7:10] see me you see my father
[7:14] so there was a oneness of god
[7:17] in jesus christ now
[7:21] melchizedek met abraham
[7:24] after his great battle
[7:27] with the five kings
[7:31] and defeated them
[7:34] and came back with the spoils
[7:39] and there melchizedek met him
[7:43] and gave him uh bread and wine
[7:48] and uh abraham in turn gave
[7:52] melchizedek a tenth a tithe
[7:56] or a tenth of whatever
[7:59] he had now we further
[8:03] learned that this
[8:06] was a type of how
[8:10] he would meet with abraham's seed
[8:14] abraham's faith seed that
[8:17] later on down through the ages of time
[8:22] god would once more come again
[8:27] to meet with abraham's
[8:30] fat seed or abraham's
[8:33] children of faith
[8:38] and that promise was made
[8:41] when jesus himself said
[8:44] as it was in the days
[8:48] of lot so
[8:51] shall it be in the days when the son of
[8:55] man
[8:56] is being revealed praise god
[9:00] now we are living i believe we are
[9:03] living
[9:03] in those days now
[9:07] we are living in days of of lot the days
[9:11] of
[9:11] sodom sodomy and every evil thing
[9:15] upon the face of the earth
[9:18] and we are under these types of
[9:22] world conditions and he said
[9:26] when these conditions are prevailing
[9:29] upon the earth
[9:30] once again as it was in sodom
[9:34] so shall it be that the son of man would
[9:38] be
[9:39] again revealed revealed
[9:43] to whom this son of man
[9:46] would reveal himself as he did to
[9:49] abraham
[9:50] now he will be doing it to abraham's
[9:55] royal faith seed his
[9:58] generations of faith that
[10:01] has the faith of abraham
[10:05] with them what faith of abraham the same
[10:09] faith abraham had with
[10:12] no written bible no written scriptures
[10:16] nothing on paper no
[10:19] prophet at that time to say anything to
[10:22] him
[10:23] but the bible tells us that abraham
[10:27] heard a voice saying abraham
[10:30] rise up go out get out of your country
[10:34] and go unto the place where i have
[10:38] called you
[10:39] amen praise god and saw
[10:42] abraham now by faith
[10:46] which means he believed the voice he
[10:49] heard
[10:50] which means he had confidence
[10:53] in the voice he heard and the bible says
[10:56] he
[10:57] went out not knowing where he went
[11:00] in other words mentally he did not know
[11:03] where
[11:03] this was leaving him but he knew he
[11:06] could
[11:07] trust that voice that he had heard
[11:10] oh glory to god something spoke to
[11:14] abraham's soul and abraham knew
[11:17] glory to god that he could trust the
[11:20] voice of god
[11:21] that was leading him now if we were to
[11:25] turn in our bibles to
[11:27] genesis chapter 18
[11:34] we find the story of god
[11:38] coming again to meet with abraham
[11:43] must have been a very hot day
[11:46] the blistering heat of the middle east
[11:50] coming down upon him his
[11:53] tents of his family his servants
[11:58] his herders were all around
[12:02] and abraham sat in his tent door
[12:06] and the bible tells us
[12:09] in the very word of god
[12:14] and the lord appeared unto abraham
[12:18] in the plains of memory
[12:21] and he sat in the tent door in the
[12:25] heat of the day and he lifted up his
[12:29] eyes
[12:29] and looked and lo three men
[12:33] stood before him and
[12:37] when he saw then
[12:41] he ran to meet them
[12:44] from the tent door and bowed himself
[12:48] before toward the ground and said
[12:53] my lord if now i have found
[12:57] favor in thy sight pass not away i pray
[13:01] thee
[13:01] from thy servant amen praise the lord
[13:05] now look i want you to see this
[13:08] abraham sees three men
[13:12] coming up the road and when they stood
[13:15] before him
[13:17] abraham of course had some sort of
[13:20] revelation
[13:22] for he recognized that though his
[13:24] natural eyes
[13:26] was seeing three yet his
[13:30] heart revealed to him this was
[13:34] the lord and the bible he did not say
[13:37] my lords read it in your scriptures
[13:42] genesis 18 he says my
[13:45] lord and bow down
[13:48] before him praise god amen
[13:52] but we have the opposite today they look
[13:55] at the at one god and now
[13:59] uh because of the the sin
[14:03] that's upon the human race
[14:06] the shock effects of sin as
[14:09] if a man were to hit you on the head
[14:12] with a with a good piece of stick
[14:16] or or something you'll see stars you see
[14:19] all manner of things
[14:22] and no doubt because of the knock upon
[14:24] the head of the entire human race
[14:28] now when this church world and the
[14:30] church people
[14:32] look at the one god hero
[14:35] israel the lord thy
[14:38] god is one lord and god does
[14:42] not change his mind about his word
[14:46] and so here it is but now when they look
[14:49] at one
[14:50] they see three and they tell you oh it's
[14:53] three in one
[14:54] but the bible doesn't tell you that the
[14:57] bible
[14:58] tells you there's only one god who
[15:01] manifests himself in
[15:04] three to under three titles
[15:08] there may be other titles but the main
[15:11] three titles
[15:12] that are there he manifests himself so
[15:15] let's
[15:15] look to the word of god what god speaks
[15:18] to
[15:19] us now the bible tells us if we're to
[15:22] follow this story
[15:23] that he invited the lord in
[15:27] any true child of abraham will
[15:30] invite the lord into his life and into
[15:33] their homes
[15:34] and for god to change their lifestyle
[15:38] change their home life change the
[15:40] pattern
[15:41] of life that they have within the home
[15:45] the next thing he called upon his wife
[15:48] sarah
[15:50] at that time abraham was a hundred and
[15:54] sarah was i believe 90 or 90 something
[15:57] years old
[15:59] and he called upon her to serve them
[16:02] some
[16:02] meat and bread food for them to eat and
[16:08] to show you god is not a vegetarian
[16:12] because the bible tells us in verse 5
[16:15] verse 5 i will fetch a morsel of bread
[16:20] comfort in your hearts you shall pass on
[16:23] therefore are you come to your servant
[16:26] and
[16:27] make ready three measures of meal
[16:30] kneaded make cakes upon the earth
[16:33] abraham
[16:34] ran to his herd fetched a calf
[16:37] tender and good and gave it to a young
[16:40] man
[16:41] and he hastened to dress it kill it and
[16:44] prepare it
[16:46] and he took butter and milk and the calf
[16:49] which he addressed
[16:51] and set it before them praise god
[16:55] and god at the cakes at the
[16:58] beef at the but at the butter
[17:02] that was before him hallelujah and drank
[17:05] the milk
[17:06] that abraham gave to him
[17:10] so god was definitely not a vegetarian
[17:14] and harry at these things that were
[17:17] before
[17:18] him and then the great miracle happened
[17:23] for we know this was really melchizedek
[17:27] once again appearing to abraham
[17:32] and now he says to abraham now abraham
[17:36] where is your wife sarah
[17:40] now first of all he tells abraham what
[17:43] is the name of his wife
[17:44] without asking abraham what is her name
[17:49] if if it's god and his god it was god
[17:54] and he already knew her name god is god
[17:58] he knew where she was
[18:00] but he turned to abraham and said where
[18:02] is
[18:04] your wife sarah and
[18:07] abraham said oh she is
[18:10] there in the tent
[18:14] beside me amen hallelujah
[18:18] and then god turned to abraham
[18:20] melchizedek
[18:22] and turned to abraham this time
[18:27] next year your wife
[18:30] sarah shall not maybe
[18:33] might could be your wife sarah
[18:38] shall bear a son amen
[18:41] praise god right now while i'm speaking
[18:44] if there's someone anywhere across the
[18:48] world hearing my voice
[18:50] and you there told you that you're
[18:52] barren they told you you can't have a
[18:54] child
[18:55] that told you that you cannot have
[18:58] any one to one child to
[19:01] love to care oh and to mother
[19:04] then in the name of jesus christ
[19:07] believe the word of god receive a child
[19:11] receive one in the name of the lord and
[19:14] may the great holy
[19:15] spirit bring it to pass amen
[19:19] god said this time next year
[19:23] your wife sarah shall bear
[19:27] a son hallelujah
[19:31] and abraham well lord sarah and i
[19:35] are old and we are stricken in age
[19:39] and and it ceased to be with sarah
[19:42] after the manner of women
[19:46] you see he's telling her she's past
[19:48] childbearing age he's talking to
[19:51] god and telling him oh i'm all
[19:54] and sarah is past shall bearing
[19:57] age and sarah laughed between herself
[20:00] saying
[20:01] after him wax old how shall i have
[20:03] pleasure with my lord being
[20:05] old also amen and the lord
[20:09] said to sarah and she was in the tent
[20:12] behind
[20:13] the lord said to abraham why did sarah
[20:16] laugh
[20:19] and and hearing that sarah came out
[20:24] is there anything too hard for the lord
[20:29] amen the great creator became our savior
[20:34] and that same creator says is
[20:37] there anything too hard for the lord
[20:40] do you have any problem too hard for the
[20:42] lord
[20:43] do you have a situation you believe it's
[20:46] too hard for
[20:47] god you anything in your heart your life
[20:50] you give it to him right now you turn to
[20:54] him
[20:54] and say lord i lift my hands my
[20:58] heart to heaven i ask for your divine
[21:01] help your deliverance
[21:02] i ask you to grant me this thing that
[21:06] i'm asking you now
[21:07] my my husband my wife my child
[21:11] lord god deliver them give them
[21:14] back to me hallelujah glory to god amen
[21:18] oh my let me tell you if you can only
[21:20] believe
[21:21] all things are possible to them
[21:24] that will believe the word of god
[21:29] is anything too hard for the lord
[21:32] at the time appointed i
[21:36] will return unto thee
[21:39] according to the time of life
[21:42] and sarah shall have
[21:46] a son and sarah denied and laughed of
[21:50] course
[21:50] and said nay but i didn't laugh he said
[21:53] but thou
[21:54] you did laugh amen hallelujah
[21:58] and they rose and turned their face
[22:00] going towards
[22:02] sodom amen that same god
[22:07] once again
[22:10] has given to sarah the promise
[22:14] that she would bear a son you know the
[22:17] story
[22:18] and in her old age when it appeared
[22:21] impossible for her to bear a child
[22:25] sarah brought forth isaac
[22:29] or the promised child of god
[22:33] he came by a word from god
[22:36] he came on the scene by a promise
[22:40] out of the mouth of the living god
[22:43] hallelujah
[22:44] amen what a wonderful wonderful type
[22:48] for we know that jesus christ
[22:51] again another symbol but then the last
[22:55] day
[22:55] church that we are now in
[22:59] this church has become so old
[23:02] seven church ages have passed
[23:05] age after age after age
[23:08] and now it's like an
[23:13] old church very old
[23:17] thousands of years old how shall
[23:21] she bring forth a bride how shall she
[23:25] bring forth
[23:26] a child but god promised
[23:31] that out of that dead womb
[23:35] his spoken word he
[23:39] will bring about her a resurrection
[23:43] a life from the dead amen
[23:46] he'll bring one from the dead doesn't
[23:49] matter how
[23:51] much the church world out there appears
[23:54] dead amen they may say oh we're not dead
[23:58] they're jumping around they're speaking
[24:00] in towns they're clapping they're
[24:01] keeping a lot of noise with
[24:03] musical instruments and everything else
[24:06] but that's just as much as cutting off
[24:08] the head of a snake
[24:09] and the head is cut off the glory is
[24:11] departed
[24:12] but the body is still jumping around and
[24:15] wriggling around
[24:16] and it's still capable of biting you or
[24:18] or putting its
[24:19] uh its coils around your life but the
[24:23] thing is
[24:24] dead amen but this
[24:27] is coming forth out of the word of god
[24:30] by the promise of god in the last day
[24:34] that according to malachi 4 5
[24:38] that god would send the prophet elijah
[24:41] in these last days and he would restore
[24:45] the faith
[24:47] of the children back to the apostolic
[24:49] fathers
[24:51] what the apostles had come back to
[24:54] us by the opening and revelation
[24:57] of the word of god and god used
[25:01] brother william marin branham in that
[25:04] role
[25:04] to bring about the fulfillment of his
[25:08] word
[25:09] we thank the living god amen so
[25:12] this last day church is now giving birth
[25:18] out of her we're coming out of it
[25:24] and out of it in a birth is coming a
[25:27] bride
[25:29] is coming on a promised seed
[25:32] it's coming a free seed it's coming the
[25:36] children of god
[25:37] anointed by the promised word of the day
[25:40] hallelujah god
[25:42] bringing us forth as word children
[25:46] children of the promise because we are
[25:49] born from the promises of
[25:51] god in this world amen
[25:55] so a bright church supposed to be
[25:58] born by the word
[26:01] when in the book of acts god promised
[26:05] in this day this last day
[26:08] that he would call out the people from
[26:12] among the gentiles to what to
[26:15] bear his name like a wife like a woman
[26:18] like a young woman getting married she
[26:21] begins she
[26:22] bears the name of the man to whom she is
[26:26] married hallelujah praise god
[26:29] now i can touch on the godhead right
[26:31] here because if the man
[26:33] is a carpenter
[26:37] if that man at the same time
[26:41] is in us mechanics
[26:44] and at the same time if he does some
[26:47] farming
[26:48] so he knows farming he's a farmer he's a
[26:51] carpenter
[26:53] and he's a mechanic when they get before
[26:56] the minister
[26:58] the minister asks him for his name
[27:01] and says we'd like for you to sign now
[27:05] this woman you take this woman to be
[27:07] your wife and
[27:08] he says okay sign the papers and he he
[27:11] writes down
[27:12] mechanic the minister said no no
[27:16] no no no no no i need your name
[27:20] but but but i i'm a mechanic that's what
[27:23] i do
[27:24] but that's i don't need that he said
[27:26] well then i'll i'll give you i'm a
[27:27] farmer
[27:28] no i don't need your title i don't
[27:32] need who you are or what you do
[27:35] yeah but i'm this i'm that no
[27:39] i need your name it's the same thing god
[27:43] comes in the titles of father god is a
[27:46] father
[27:47] god came created a body got into it
[27:50] lived in the body the father lived in
[27:53] the sun
[27:54] god was in christ the father that dwelt
[27:57] in him
[27:58] he does the work and now he says
[28:01] his name shall be called jesus
[28:04] for he shall save his people from their
[28:08] sins
[28:09] peter in the book of acts chapter 2 he
[28:11] says there
[28:12] there is no other name
[28:17] nor the name not mary not peter
[28:20] not james not philip not any other name
[28:25] given under heaven by heaven
[28:28] whereby we must be saved
[28:31] but the name of jesus christ hallelujah
[28:35] paul said all that we do let us
[28:38] we do it in the name of jesus christ
[28:42] hallelujah praise god aren't you happy
[28:46] that we are the manifested word
[28:50] seed children of the promised
[28:53] word of god for this hour
[28:57] on our descent is from
[29:00] the very generation and see
[29:03] life of god through abraham
[29:07] praise his marvelous name
[29:11] now i want you to see also that the
[29:14] promise of god catching
[29:18] into the womb of sarah
[29:21] was a type of
[29:25] burial and resurrection
[29:28] from the bowels or womb of the earth
[29:32] just as much as isaac went up the
[29:35] mountain with
[29:36] abraham and was supposed to be
[29:39] sacrificed
[29:40] but came back down jesus
[29:44] was supposed to be dead went into the
[29:46] earth
[29:48] and was dead and buried
[29:51] but on the third day rose back up
[29:54] with the glory came back down in the
[29:57] form of the holy spirit
[29:59] as a symbol and type of the fulfillment
[30:02] of the word of god
[30:05] now turning our attention
[30:09] from abraham let us go to john chapter
[30:13] four
[30:14] verses one
[30:18] and two
[30:22] when therefore the lord knew how the
[30:25] pharisees had heard
[30:28] that jesus made and baptized
[30:32] more disciples than john
[30:36] though jesus himself baptized
[30:39] not but the disciples
[30:43] he left judea and departed
[30:47] again into galilee
[30:52] that he must needs
[30:55] go through samaria
[30:59] and we'll get to the rest of the story
[31:04] for here the bible tells us
[31:08] he must needs go through
[31:12] samaria oh blessed be the name of the
[31:15] lord
[31:17] when god knows he has children he goes
[31:19] after them
[31:22] and the story tells us the story of the
[31:24] woman
[31:25] at the well the prostitute
[31:29] at the well better known as the woman
[31:33] of samaria at the well
[31:37] and the scene is set well there
[31:41] comes jesus
[31:45] and the bible tells us saint john
[31:49] chapter 4 that he had to go
[31:52] by there and there the bible tells us
[31:58] that he sat on the well well let me make
[32:01] this clear
[32:02] this was the same melchizedek
[32:06] now in the form of flesh
[32:09] named jesus melchizedek
[32:14] hallelujah in a flesh form now
[32:19] called jesus christ
[32:22] amen now we see
[32:26] that there was a well there dug by
[32:30] jacob many years before
[32:35] and it was about 11 o'clock
[32:38] in the day
[32:42] and he sent his disciples to get some
[32:44] food
[32:45] for them and while
[32:48] they were gone
[32:51] there was this woman that was ill-famed
[32:56] as women in towns villages cities
[33:00] everywhere we have such people
[33:03] we don't know the reason why they will
[33:06] do such things
[33:09] sometimes they're seduced sometimes
[33:13] they're forced
[33:14] sometimes they're willingly do that
[33:16] other times
[33:17] hardships come upon them various
[33:20] situations
[33:21] that we may never be able to explain or
[33:25] to be able to
[33:26] understand but
[33:29] this was a red light woman a marked
[33:32] woman
[33:32] of that time
[33:36] and she had many husbands
[33:40] but here was jesus sitting by the well
[33:46] and this woman came by the well
[33:50] at 11 around 11 o'clock
[33:54] now she couldn't come in the early
[33:56] morning
[33:57] when the virgins uh
[34:00] and the married women would come down to
[34:03] the well
[34:04] to get their water
[34:07] so people are of her
[34:10] status would wait until the
[34:14] well is clear and nobody is about
[34:18] to cheater chatter goth gossip or talk
[34:21] or call names and then she would
[34:26] go there to get her water because she
[34:29] could not mix with them because in those
[34:31] days
[34:32] the women the the prostitutes had a mark
[34:36] the their hair in the front was cut in a
[34:39] certain way
[34:40] where they could be instantly recognized
[34:43] by a man or any other person that
[34:46] they were free and open
[34:50] for service and here it was friends
[34:54] she came to get water
[34:58] she's about to put her buckets into the
[35:01] well
[35:03] and as she did that
[35:07] she heard a voice
[35:10] behind her saying woman
[35:15] bring me some water to drink
[35:19] now remember this is melchizedek
[35:23] this is melchizedek in the form of jesus
[35:26] the same yesterday today and forever
[35:30] the son of man has spoken of
[35:33] in the bible in the word form of flesh
[35:38] making himself manifesting uh
[35:41] manifested or melchizedek manifesting
[35:45] through flesh amen
[35:48] the word was made flesh and now it was
[35:51] manifesting
[35:53] through that flesh amen and i believe
[35:56] the same thing is happening today
[35:58] that the word again has returned
[36:01] and is manifesting true
[36:04] human flesh amen praise god
[36:08] now the woman spun around because she
[36:10] heard a voice
[36:12] i'll tell you my friends
[36:15] you may have heard church voices
[36:19] you might have heard the voice of some
[36:22] so-called called himself an apostle call
[36:25] himself a so-called church
[36:26] prophet call himself a great man in the
[36:29] world
[36:29] you might have heard many voices
[36:33] but when she heard this voice the bible
[36:37] said she
[36:37] turned around and i tell you friends
[36:40] it'll make you repent
[36:42] it'll make you want to change your life
[36:44] it'll make you want to turn around and
[36:47] go in the opposite direction
[36:48] from whence you were going but here was
[36:51] this woman oh my glory to god hallelujah
[36:55] amen and when she looked
[36:59] she saw a young jew
[37:02] just imagine a young jew
[37:06] that just about 31 years old
[37:10] and she a young prostitute come out
[37:14] there for water
[37:16] and he is asking her for a drink of
[37:19] water
[37:20] now that kind of a woman you know
[37:22] immediately what she will be
[37:24] thinking uh and how she is talking to
[37:26] him
[37:28] and uh uh you know she's he said to her
[37:32] um water um
[37:35] are you what are you talking about water
[37:37] in other words she's trying to find
[37:39] where he's coming from
[37:40] he says no if you knew who was speaking
[37:43] to you
[37:45] you knew you would know that i can give
[37:47] you
[37:48] all the water you want that you will
[37:50] never have to
[37:52] thirst again you'll never thrust again
[37:55] and say well how you gonna draw it the
[37:57] well is deep
[37:58] he said no the water i give is a water
[38:01] of eternal
[38:02] life if you drink it you'll live forever
[38:05] glory to god
[38:06] that's the water that we are giving out
[38:09] to
[38:10] quench the people's hunger and spiritual
[38:13] thirst
[38:14] people in this day in this hour that
[38:17] thirsting they're hungry for something
[38:20] real
[38:20] something true something honest
[38:24] this money begging money loving
[38:27] fame seeking name seeking
[38:31] numbers game that they're they're caught
[38:34] up
[38:34] in my friends people are looking for the
[38:38] reality
[38:39] of the power of god in the presence of
[38:41] the holy spirit
[38:42] working through the life of simple and
[38:45] humble
[38:46] people that will walk with god and god
[38:49] will walk with them amen hallelujah
[38:55] he spoke with the woman
[38:58] and she said you greater than our father
[39:01] uh uh jacob or abraham he said before
[39:05] abraham was i am
[39:08] amen oh my
[39:12] oh he said sir sir i perceive
[39:16] that you're some kind of a prophet
[39:20] she said well uh gone
[39:23] where is your husband she says i don't
[39:26] have any husband
[39:28] you see she was an unmarried prostitute
[39:32] uh uh an unmarried loose woman
[39:35] oh my he said to her
[39:42] you told the truth
[39:45] you have no husband because you're not
[39:48] married
[39:50] but i'll tell you right now you have
[39:52] five
[39:54] and one of them is not your own
[39:58] in other words you have five you've
[40:00] you've gone with
[40:01] five unmarried men
[40:04] and the four unmarried men and this
[40:07] fifth one
[40:08] you're planning to go with is a married
[40:11] man don't do it
[40:14] amen you see now we understand why the
[40:18] bible tells us
[40:20] melchizedek had to meet this woman
[40:23] because
[40:24] she was one of his genes
[40:28] one of those thoughts that was in
[40:31] the very mind of god before the
[40:33] foundation of the world
[40:36] and we she we just as her
[40:39] she came down into this human body
[40:43] to live and walk on the face of this
[40:46] earth full of sin deceit lies
[40:50] trips traps all manner of evil
[40:54] to cause us to stumble fail fall
[40:57] and to do every possible thing
[41:01] and god will look and god sees all our
[41:04] mistakes but there is a point
[41:08] where he is saying i would stand for it
[41:11] anymore
[41:12] for one of my children to go
[41:15] this far i can't allow it
[41:19] that is why we read in john 4
[41:22] 4 he must needs
[41:26] go through scenario yes he
[41:29] needed to go through there because he
[41:31] had to wait by the while he knew she was
[41:34] coming
[41:35] and he had to be able to arrest her
[41:38] a car catch her attention and
[41:41] draw her back to himself back to the
[41:45] word
[41:46] that she would recognize who she is
[41:49] that she is not just a a prin
[41:53] prostitute in this world but she's a
[41:55] princess
[41:57] with the living god come out of that
[42:00] kind of a life
[42:02] back to the word of god hallelujah be
[42:05] the princess
[42:06] that you are according to this word of
[42:09] god
[42:10] and god will back you up and be with you
[42:13] every step of the way hallelujah
[42:16] amen glory to god oh my
[42:20] hallelujah she said sir
[42:23] i perceive you're a prophet
[42:26] when messiah comes he
[42:30] is going to do such things like this
[42:33] call out people tell them the secrets of
[42:36] their hearts
[42:39] call them by their name never having met
[42:42] them
[42:44] tell them about all their situation
[42:46] without even knowing them
[42:49] and she realized it was not just the the
[42:52] flesh form outside but
[42:54] the person inside there that was
[42:56] speaking through
[42:58] that form to her was the lord god
[43:01] himself
[43:02] by this word making himself manifested
[43:06] through the word oh glory to god
[43:08] hallelujah
[43:10] she said that is the sign of messiah
[43:13] for when the sign messiah comes
[43:16] he is supposed to do those things ah
[43:20] now she is revealing that somewhere in
[43:22] her background
[43:24] she had some scriptural
[43:27] understanding somewhere
[43:30] she must have read her torah which is
[43:33] the
[43:34] jewish bible at that time
[43:37] so she must have been in a uh a godly
[43:40] home
[43:42] and somewhere along the line
[43:45] some evil person
[43:50] destroyed her life or virtue she found
[43:54] herself
[43:56] in a hard situation maybe
[43:59] father dead mother dead and having
[44:02] several
[44:03] children uh brothers and sisters younger
[44:06] than herself
[44:08] i'm not justifying that kind of a life
[44:10] i'm just telling you from the scripture
[44:12] that's what could have been her life and
[44:15] so she stepped over the line
[44:18] and she started going in that direction
[44:20] but she started
[44:22] going and the lord saw that was going
[44:24] too far
[44:25] because now she was going to take a
[44:28] married man
[44:29] somebody else's husband and he came down
[44:33] and put a stop to it
[44:35] right there right then hallelujah i'm
[44:38] too happy that we have a god like this
[44:40] god watching over us every single step
[44:44] of the way we give him the glory we give
[44:47] him the honor
[44:48] and we give him the praise glory to god
[44:51] hallelujah amen oh praise
[44:55] god i want you to know
[44:58] he promised to do that same thing
[45:01] at the ending of the church ages
[45:05] according to malachi 4 5
[45:09] even sent back jesus
[45:12] but he would send a prophet
[45:15] in the spirit and the anointing of
[45:18] elijah
[45:19] according to malachi chapter 4 verse 5
[45:23] and to that prophet the great angel
[45:26] of revelation 10 1 the mighty angel
[45:31] would come down and speak to that
[45:34] earthly prophet and reveal himself
[45:38] reveal himself and reveal the word of
[45:41] god
[45:41] reveal the mysteries of god to that
[45:44] prophet
[45:46] who would then unfold it to the rest of
[45:49] the elected seed
[45:51] that are scattered all over the face of
[45:54] the earth
[45:55] my friends let me tell you that has
[45:58] happened
[45:59] and is happening for our precious
[46:02] brother
[46:04] william marion branham has come
[46:07] fulfilled the word of god as
[46:10] never before and planted the seed
[46:14] warden in my heart in the heart of many
[46:17] others
[46:18] anointed with the word of god to to
[46:21] glean the
[46:22] end time harvest that is in the world
[46:25] today
[46:26] from every continent every corner
[46:29] of this world god the great shepherd
[46:33] is now calling for his sheep to come
[46:36] home
[46:37] come home back to the word back to this
[46:40] time an hour it's supper time now
[46:44] it's it's wedding separate time now
[46:47] it's time to feast upon the word of
[46:50] god for this day and time
[46:53] come out of all the crookedness and
[46:56] evilness
[46:57] of denominationalism oh praise
[47:00] god the holy spirit is here with his
[47:04] word to call you out
[47:05] and to bring his word to you and break
[47:08] the devil's
[47:10] back and kick him out of your life that
[47:12] you might
[47:13] live for the lord jesus christ and him
[47:16] forevermore
[47:17] oh praise god amen amen
[47:21] yes sir it was a promise
[47:24] that he would reveal himself again
[47:28] as the son of man
[47:31] so he promised he would come back to
[47:34] meet
[47:35] abraham's seed
[47:39] upon the face of the earth
[47:43] now i'm thinking of the eagle story
[47:46] where that eagle had an egg that the
[47:49] farmers
[47:50] took stole the egg like these church
[47:54] members these churches or denominations
[47:56] steal the people's heart away
[47:59] from god while telling you they're gonna
[48:01] make you love
[48:02] god they cause you to love them more
[48:05] amen praise god until
[48:08] people would kill for their church
[48:10] rather than to stand up for the truth
[48:12] that is in the word of the living god
[48:16] but one day just like jesus just like
[48:19] melchizedek
[48:22] he had to pass that woman's way
[48:25] he had to go through he must needs go
[48:29] through some area
[48:30] he knew he had a child there he
[48:33] knew he had an attribute there he knew
[48:36] he had a gene there and he had to pass
[48:40] that way to pick her up to to correct
[48:43] her
[48:44] and lead her and guide her in the right
[48:46] direction
[48:48] and so as us as he did so did this eagle
[48:52] pass over the burn yard amen
[48:55] that's like us in this rotten stinking
[48:58] world
[48:59] if you ever been in a a big style if
[49:02] you're building a burn
[49:03] yard with chicken chicken stuff
[49:07] on the ground and and dung and
[49:10] and cowed down and got down and
[49:13] everything else it's so smelly my
[49:16] friends
[49:16] and so there we are in this world
[49:21] surrounded by a world of sin and evil
[49:24] oh my god just like this
[49:28] but you know the farmer took that egg
[49:30] place it under him
[49:31] and the hand hatched i'll tell you
[49:35] friends
[49:36] that that egg all the birds create the
[49:40] same kind of warp that will hatch an egg
[49:42] so they take the eagle's egg and put it
[49:44] in a church nest
[49:46] in a denomination and the heat and the
[49:49] and the clapping and the worship and
[49:51] everything else
[49:52] it could cause a child to come forth
[49:55] but then the child doesn't know who he
[49:57] is
[49:58] who she is where they come from
[50:01] who is their father where are they going
[50:05] and so when the mother church or the
[50:08] mother hand says
[50:12] the ego doesn't know what they're
[50:14] talking about
[50:16] that doesn't they don't understand those
[50:18] towns
[50:19] they don't understand any of that sort
[50:21] of thing
[50:22] and so they don't know why how come
[50:25] she's supposed to be my mother but i
[50:27] don't understand her
[50:29] i'm not getting anything from that
[50:32] and then the brothers so-called those
[50:35] brothers of
[50:36] chicken brothers that he have and
[50:38] chicken sisters that you have all they
[50:40] are going around
[50:41] saying cheap cheap cheap cheap
[50:45] cheap well let me tell you there's a
[50:47] cost to
[50:48] any true pentecost there is plenty of
[50:52] cost
[50:52] for a petite a real petty cause you
[50:55] don't get
[50:56] that cheap you come in the presence of
[50:59] god
[50:59] you pay the price you my friends you
[51:03] go through fiery trials and testing and
[51:06] everything else
[51:07] but he promised that he'll bring you out
[51:09] by a mighty hand
[51:10] oh glory to god hallelujah amen
[51:14] another thing the young eagle realized
[51:18] they were there every time she
[51:21] all run to her when she do that he can't
[51:24] run in time
[51:26] plus they're scratching to get worms and
[51:29] dung and bugs to eat
[51:32] on the ground meanwhile he has a hunger
[51:36] within
[51:37] him that can't satisfy him those kinds
[51:40] of church doctrines and
[51:41] church litanies and church fundamentals
[51:45] and
[51:46] all those it can't fulfill him his
[51:48] hunger
[51:49] there's something in him hungering for
[51:51] the truth
[51:52] he must have the word of god and the
[51:55] power of the holy spirit
[51:57] within his life and so here he was
[52:01] not this happy with scratching he walked
[52:04] the threat to them
[52:06] you know they could run like that and
[52:08] but he had this big two long wings and
[52:11] he has to
[52:11] walk like that walk like that because of
[52:15] his two wings
[52:16] and and he got these nails on him
[52:19] the wrestling said brother why are your
[52:21] nails so long
[52:23] why are your wings so big why you have
[52:25] all why are you seeing the word like
[52:27] that why you have these
[52:29] uh things happening to you like that but
[52:32] you see he was
[52:33] different amen praise god
[52:36] even when the rest of them are clockwork
[52:38] and he tried to answer them back
[52:40] his voice coming out with an eagle
[52:42] scream hallelujah
[52:44] a voice of the eagle cry out of his
[52:47] voice
[52:48] mine out of him claim that voice
[52:50] hallelujah
[52:51] it scared the rest of them that kind of
[52:54] preaching and talking and explaining
[52:57] other words
[52:57] it got them scared they didn't want
[52:59] nothing to do with it and after a while
[53:01] they started to run away from him
[53:03] they didn't want to deal with that lady
[53:06] that child
[53:07] that brother that will speak the word
[53:10] in that manner but one day
[53:14] that mother eager realized she has a son
[53:18] and passed over that barnyard and let
[53:21] out the scream
[53:22] hallelujah oh my i believe
[53:25] the great eagle of god jehovah
[53:29] is passing over the barnyard of your
[53:32] neighborhood
