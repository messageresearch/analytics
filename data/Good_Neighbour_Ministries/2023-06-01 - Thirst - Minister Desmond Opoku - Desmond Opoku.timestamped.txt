[32:40] he just came and sprayed that bread
[32:42] sprinkling that brother so that we can
[32:45] receive
[32:46] that life
[32:48] because the life
[32:50] is in the blood

[33:40] has reserved this water for
[33:44] that's you and me and there's only
[33:47] Christianity
[33:49] Hallelujah
[33:51] and this water here
[33:53] you know when we we have water in our
[33:57] home but sometimes we put a Purify to
[34:00] purify the water
[34:02] the purification of this water together
[34:04] is speckled water
[34:08] is through the message of the hour
[34:10] William Branham
[34:15] when brother Abraham was here the
[34:17] Christianity was here already
[34:19] that God put a filter purification to
[34:23] filter the water for only especially
[34:25] people that's the blood of Christ
[34:28] so if you have the message of this hour
[34:32] you are drinking the real living water
[34:37] the real living water
[34:39] the special water God has reserved for
[34:42] you and me no other people hallelujah
[34:46] glory to God

[34:55] understand why because you are special
[34:59] God reserved especially Revelation he
[35:03] opened himself to you so that's me

[35:18] miss to have fellowship with you but now

[35:31] message special
[35:33] special message William Martin
[35:38] why you think the world hate him
[35:41] why they had this message because this
[35:43] message is life
[35:45] why we are drinking special water
[35:49] the denomination had this message why
[35:52] because they don't have that
[35:53] purification water that God has given to
[35:57] you or me and what it caused a jealousy
[36:01] why did they why why God did that
[36:05] because

[1:07:50] gonna hold himself to you
[1:07:52] because she wants to see something why
[1:07:56] she is angry with God
[1:07:58] so God has given something
[1:08:01] if I had to see that the god that we
[1:08:04] serve is real

[1:08:09] your life
[1:08:10] hallelujah it's not just the words the
[1:08:13] manifestation of the Lord why do you
[1:08:16] think the people come to Brown meeting
[1:08:18] and they see the life the physical life
[1:08:22] sick womb
[1:08:24] death womb the rise up this is
[1:08:27] what happened
[1:08:29] that's the manifestation of whatever
[1:08:31] Abraham was preaching
[1:08:33] he said I can do nothing
[1:08:36] the one that behind me doing the work
[1:08:40] and God comes down and shows himself to
[1:08:44] the people
[1:08:47] to show himself to the people
[1:08:50] and you go to somebody and you tell God
[1:08:53] to show himself to that person would you
[1:08:55] believe that God will show himself to
[1:08:57] that person
[1:08:59] he would do exactly that he did through
[1:09:02] Abraham
[1:09:04] because God wants people to see him he
[1:09:08] wants to serve people
[1:09:10] he want to call his children
[1:09:14] if they don't know him
[1:09:16] they have to save him
[1:09:18] especially this woman that he had the
[1:09:21] heart
[1:09:23] look here
[1:09:24] nobody in the house he has only two
[1:09:28] children one boy one girl
[1:09:33] the husband he said the husband sick so
[1:09:35] hard he died and the heart attack
[1:09:38] massive heart attack to the boy never
[1:09:40] get sick
[1:09:42] and the sister husband gone
[1:09:46] say why God do that take everything away
[1:09:49] from me
[1:09:51] every human being
[1:09:56] a big house alone
[1:09:59] everything turned upside down the chair
[1:10:02] the sofa
[1:10:03] covered everything covers she alone
[1:10:08] she had it right he's a human
[1:10:11] to God if you introduce God to him
[1:10:16] he has to see something
[1:10:19] that will take that thing that
[1:10:21] bitterness away from his heart
[1:10:23] and I believe in my heart 100 one day
[1:10:27] we're gonna advertise here
[1:10:29] God will do it there's nothing hard for
[1:10:33] God that he cannot do nothing
[1:10:37] God created us
[1:10:40] that's a child of God God creates him

[1:10:47] to God gonna send you
[1:10:51] but make sure you does the work
[1:10:56] look here there is no shame in this
[1:10:59] gospel

[1:11:36] God doesn't like that
[1:11:38] you want action
[1:11:40] you know Joshua Joshua wasn't timid are
[1:11:44] you against us or you would ask
[1:11:45] that's the way God wants
[1:11:49] because the sword is ready if you are
[1:11:51] sad if you're a child of God you your
[1:11:54] son has to be ready all the time ready
