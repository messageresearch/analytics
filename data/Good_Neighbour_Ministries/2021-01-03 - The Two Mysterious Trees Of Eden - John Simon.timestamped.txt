[1:19] come together
[1:21] in his name my scripture for today is
[1:25] found in the book of
[1:27] genesis chapter 2.
[1:33] reading from verses
[1:38] 8 and 9.
[1:41] and the lord god planted a garden
[1:46] eastward in eden
[1:49] and there he put the man whom he
[1:52] had formed and out
[1:56] of the ground made the lord to grow
[2:00] every tree that is pleasant
[2:04] to the sight and good
[2:07] for food and the tree of life
[2:12] also in the midst of the garden
[2:16] and the tree of knowledge of
[2:20] good and evil praise
[2:23] be to god gracious heavenly father
[2:27] we have just read from your
[2:31] holy word and now we ask
[2:34] for divine help
[2:38] may the great holy spirit who
[2:41] the scriptures tell us when he the
[2:44] spirit of truth is come
[2:46] he will guide us into all truth
[2:51] and show us things to come may he
[2:54] guide us today as we surrender ourselves

[3:05] may your name be lifted up may your
[3:08] person be glorified
[3:11] may you be worshipped and honored father
[3:14] for
[3:14] worthy is the lamb that was slain
[3:18] and has redeemed us by his blood to god
[3:22] in jesus name amen and amen
[3:26] praise the lord my topic
[3:30] for today from the scripture
[3:33] i've just read is
[3:38] the two mysterious trees
[3:42] in of eden the two
[3:46] mysterious trees of eden
[3:51] now we know uh satan is very
[3:56] deceptive misleading
[4:00] very deceitful for he has
[4:03] spawned lies
[4:06] and myths about these trees
[4:11] and the these two trees
[4:14] have remained as a mystery
[4:18] in the minds of men wondering
[4:21] what are they the song
[4:25] he has spread the myth and the lie
[4:28] that the trees one was an apple tree
[4:34] and eve somehow at the apple off of that
[4:38] tree
[4:40] and uh realized that she was naked
[4:44] and also became pregnant and bore a son
[4:48] all because of eating an apple from off
[4:50] of this tree
[4:53] he further spread his myth and said well
[4:57] maybe it may not have been an apple tree
[5:00] it
[5:00] might have been a pear tree and then we
[5:04] have
[5:05] that lie uh being spread
[5:08] that it was a a pear tree
[5:13] but on the whole what he is doing there
[5:17] is taking the minds of man
[5:21] out of the s supernatural realm or
[5:24] spiritual realm
[5:27] and placing their minds along the lines
[5:30] of natural things so
[5:34] when they read in the bible
[5:37] that god placed these trees
[5:41] in the garden to be beautiful
[5:44] for sight and that they would be
[5:48] good for food but if you will notice
[5:52] in the scripture there is a semicolon
[5:57] which means that these two
[6:00] trees that god spoke of last of all
[6:03] were different from the other
[6:07] trees or from the rest of the trees
[6:11] oh may we pay attention
[6:15] to the word of god today listen
[6:19] we realize in the bible according to
[6:22] psalms
[6:23] chapter psalms 1 the
[6:26] entire chapter which starts blessed
[6:30] is the man amen
[6:34] that continues on he shall
[6:37] be like a tree planted by the rivers of
[6:42] waters his roots
[6:45] also shall not wither
[6:48] or praise be to god i'm just
[6:52] using that scripture you can read the
[6:54] entire chapter for yourself
[6:58] but it is pointing to the fact that
[7:01] trees are
[7:02] representative of persons
[7:05] trees are representative of
[7:08] people you may read other scriptures
[7:11] other types
[7:12] in the various books of the bible
[7:16] trees of the wood and god speaking about
[7:19] the bramble
[7:20] and speaking about the vine and
[7:22] different
[7:23] scriptures and illusions speaking
[7:27] to this fact that trees
[7:30] represent persons
[7:33] and we find also john the baptist
[7:38] understood clearly the meaning of these
[7:41] trees
[7:42] and of trees in particular and
[7:45] said the axe is laid to the roots
[7:49] amen you see he was not talking about
[7:52] natural trees he was talking about
[7:56] spiritual trees and spiritual principles
[8:00] and the acts of god's word was
[8:04] laid against the roots of evil
[8:07] and there it was he was referring again
[8:11] to trees and these
[8:14] trees in his mind he would recognize
[8:18] them as he spoke to the scribes and
[8:20] pharisees
[8:22] alluded also to persons
[8:26] now these uh representative trees of
[8:29] which i'm speaking
[8:30] the tree of life and the tree
[8:35] of knowledge or of wisdom
[8:39] of good and evil
[8:42] now jesus christ i believe
[8:45] and teach that he is
[8:49] the tree of life
[8:52] satan i believe is the tree
[8:56] of knowledge he's a hybrid tree
[9:01] a mixed tree oh
[9:04] we will speak about this a bit later
[9:09] how there is what good and evil
[9:12] in that tree you're lured in by the good
[9:15] in the tree
[9:17] but the evil is wrapped in the good
[9:20] so that when it is eaten absorbed or
[9:23] taken in to the heart and to the mind
[9:27] one is deceived one is
[9:31] led astray by the perverted
[9:35] to bear nothing but the perverted fruit
[9:39] of the tree from which one has eaten
[9:42] may god help us to eat from the tree of
[9:44] life the word of god
[9:46] and receive true life eternal life
[9:50] and our lives shall not wither for we
[9:53] were planted by the
[9:54] ever-present waters in the rock
[9:58] now of course we know that every seed
[10:02] shall bring forth after its kind
[10:04] and that every tree bears fruit
[10:08] some kind of fruit amen
[10:11] and we find that jesus being the tree of
[10:15] life
[10:17] with him in us we bear the fruits of
[10:20] that tree
[10:21] oh praise god hallelujah
[10:24] they the the fruits of the spirit
[10:27] the nine gifts of the holy spirit
[10:30] flowing through our lives and blessing
[10:33] and anointing us
[10:35] as we go forth in his name and with
[10:39] the word of god hallelujah amen
[10:43] satan the fruits of death
[10:49] we read it in our bible
[10:52] that from the time he partook of the
[10:56] tree
[10:57] of knowledge of good and evil
[11:00] it produced nothing but sin
[11:03] suffering and death
[11:07] time began age began
[11:10] pain began labor began sweating began
[11:14] all these various curses
[11:18] and troubles and trials began
[11:21] to go along with man's
[11:24] existence because of disobedience
[11:29] to god's word from here in eden
[11:34] we see the great battle of wisdom
[11:38] versus faith we see the fruit
[11:43] of these two trees manifested
[11:47] and how they would be manifested
[11:50] through the representations
[11:55] of cain and abel
[11:58] these two boys coming from
[12:02] those two fruit trees those two trees
[12:06] one from satan the tree
[12:10] of knowledge of good and evil cain
[12:14] and from jesus christ a bell
[12:19] with light revelation and
[12:22] life praise be to god and
[12:26] that model that representation
[12:30] has stood the test of time
[12:33] until we return back to the eternities
[12:37] for right now we see the same
[12:40] spirits the same life
[12:44] and the same representation coming
[12:47] face to face again here in our day
[12:51] and in our time glory be to god
[12:54] now with these foundational backgrounds
[12:59] let us see what is happening today in
[13:02] our day
[13:03] and and in the time in which we live
[13:08] now my introduction here
[13:11] there's a lot in it that one can take
[13:14] and
[13:15] search the scriptures and follow it and
[13:17] it will
[13:18] build your faith and you will recognize
[13:22] where i took a lot of this from
[13:26] and where i've received it from and you
[13:29] will
[13:29] see that it is grounded in the word of
[13:33] god
[13:34] and in the revelation of this
[13:37] hour by the great holy spirit amen
[13:41] praise god hallelujah now listen
[13:45] when he came to the hebrew bride
[13:49] she was the mother of all living
[13:53] amen you see eve was the
[13:57] mother of all natural life
[14:00] all natural living adam was
[14:03] not the father of all living but
[14:07] eve was the mother of all natural
[14:11] living amen but now when the holy spirit
[14:15] came to his hebrew bride on the day of
[14:19] pentecost
[14:20] the uh and poured out of his great holy
[14:23] spirit
[14:25] she was the mother of all
[14:28] living but
[14:31] after process of time
[14:34] the hebrew bride rejected
[14:38] the word of god amen
[14:42] justice eve first received this word
[14:46] and then later rejected it
[14:50] under the deceit of reasoning
[14:54] by satan so the first
[14:58] eve or the natural eve
[15:01] fell by listening to satan's
[15:05] reasoning satan's reasoning what is that
[15:10] satan's collection and accumulation
[15:15] of all human wisdom for
[15:18] thousands of years all accumulated
[15:21] together
[15:23] makes up the wisdom of this world
[15:27] along with the wisdom of this ancient
[15:31] evil wicked and virulent spirits
[15:35] called satan lucifer
[15:38] came down upon the earth and began to
[15:43] uh infuse and insert his
[15:47] knowledge within this knowledge that was
[15:50] there
[15:51] perverting the wisdom of god the word of
[15:55] god
[15:56] and creating a perversion
[15:59] and a copy of god's plan and purpose
[16:04] she listened to satan's reasoning
[16:09] against the revelation
[16:14] that was being revealed to her she tried
[16:17] to reason the revelation
[16:20] and he got her to start reasoning
[16:23] against
[16:24] the revelation that was revealed
[16:27] to her amen now when
[16:31] eve was in the garden with adam
[16:34] we understand that it was god himself
[16:38] that spoke to them and
[16:41] told them of the trees of the garden you
[16:45] shall eat from the rest of them
[16:48] but of this tree of knowledge
[16:51] of good and evil thou shalt not
[16:54] eat lest you die so it was
[16:58] god himself that brought that to her
[17:02] don't touch the tree amen that was his
[17:06] spoken word
[17:08] that was god's words spoken directly
[17:12] to them now after that time of course we
[17:15] know
[17:15] that came through the prophets also
[17:17] don't touch sin don't touch evil
[17:20] don't touch these dead things all the
[17:22] type
[17:23] of not touching what god was thoroughly
[17:27] against and then it finally came to
[17:29] jesus
[17:30] and he had the same message that we are
[17:33] not to touch sin we are not the touch
[17:35] evil
[17:36] we are not to touch any of these things
[17:38] of the world
[17:40] but it was god who spoke the word
[17:43] directly
[17:44] to them and they turn god's word
[17:48] down by listening to the serpent
[17:53] here it comes
[17:57] in our day god has sent a prophet
[18:00] and god speaking through the prophet for
[18:03] the spirit
[18:04] speaks through the prophet and
[18:08] the people have taken their own wisdom
[18:13] to resist or to speak
[18:16] against the word of god
[18:20] from the mouth of god's prophet for this
[18:24] hour putting their own human wisdom
[18:28] and accumulation of knowledge
[18:32] bringing it against the word of god for
[18:34] the day
[18:36] oh my think of it put in your reasoning
[18:41] against the revelation of the hour
[18:46] how did the first eve fall she failed by
[18:50] listening to reasoning
[18:53] against the word of god
[18:58] that's exactly how she fell
[19:01] she did not listen to the word
[19:05] now the church christ
[19:08] bright she fell
[19:11] not back there in eden that was the
[19:14] natural leave
[19:16] but spiritual eve fell not in eden
[19:20] but she fell at rome
[19:23] she fell by roman reasoning
[19:27] contrary to the word of god
[19:30] and perverting the word and promises
[19:34] of god in this bible as
[19:38] was revealed to her
[19:41] you see eve the spiritual leave now
[19:45] was presented with the same choices
[19:50] and the same conditions
[19:54] as the first eve was
[19:57] in the garden of eden there she was
[20:01] tempted
[20:02] by the serpent satan in the serpent
[20:07] now the second eve is presented with a
[20:10] choice
[20:12] to follow believe
[20:15] and believe god's revealed word to her
[20:21] or the natural reasoning
[20:25] of the serpent through an instrument
[20:29] of this time that he is using for his
[20:34] own purposes and for his own
[20:37] plans yes
[20:41] reaching out and accepting that
[20:44] reasoning and what happened to the
[20:47] spiritual church
[20:49] she fell at the council of nicaea
[20:52] there she fell when she rejected
[20:57] the pentecostal church in its way
[21:01] and went down to nicaea
[21:04] began listening to roman
[21:07] reasoning instead of holding to the word
[21:11] of god
[21:12] and to god's unchanging hand
[21:16] yes sir she fell and everything
[21:19] went away from her and began to die from
[21:23] around her
[21:24] and my friends just asked the natural
[21:28] he fell spiritual eve
[21:31] also fell away
[21:34] by the reasoning of satan
[21:38] god's bride
[21:42] fell in the garden
[21:46] christ's bride fell
[21:49] in nicaea at rome
[21:53] from roman reasoning
[21:56] reasoning against the word of god
[22:01] amen hallelujah now we're going to
[22:05] uh read from our we want to uh
[22:08] comment from the god of this evil age
[22:12] whom we know satan is the god of this
[22:14] evil age
[22:17] and it's been prophesied that as the
[22:20] first eve had to be tried
[22:24] and tested as to her faithfulness
[22:27] to the word of god for that hour
[22:30] so is this eve in our day and in our
[22:33] time
[22:34] to be tested tried and proven
[22:39] by the satan using
[22:43] and perverting the very message the very
[22:48] scriptures the word of god for this day
[22:52] and for this hour but you see
[22:57] and he did it face to face and when he
[23:00] did it
[23:00] evil was just in its infancy
[23:04] but now we are here
[23:07] we're passing through the seventh church
[23:09] age
[23:11] evil has gone through its cycles
[23:14] and now it's come to a place of its
[23:18] maturity
[23:20] and that evil one
[23:23] must come against this last day bride
[23:28] so that she might be tested
[23:31] by the same standards as the first eve
[23:36] as the hebrew uh church
[23:39] and this is the hour that is upon us now
[23:44] our trials have begun our
[23:47] testings have begun our sifting
[23:51] time has begun yes sir the time when
[23:55] god is choosing his own
[23:58] and they are being tested in every
[24:01] possible way amen yes
[24:06] back then there stood the tree of life
[24:09] there stood the tree of knowledge
[24:12] and she had to make a choice
[24:16] of the tree amen hallelujah
[24:19] yes sir that tree of knowledge of course
[24:23] satan got into the serpent
[24:26] and perverted her thoughts
[24:30] unfortunately her mind and just as much
[24:33] as she had to make a choice
[24:37] every age has to make a choice
[24:41] every church has to make a choice
[24:44] every believer has to make a choice
[24:49] quo vadis with a guest now
[24:53] what shall i do what should you do
[24:56] what decision shall i make whether
[24:59] should you turn
[25:01] to knowledge or to faith
[25:04] to wisdom or to revelation
[25:07] where shall you go may the great holy
[25:10] spirit of god
[25:12] call to call out to your spirit
[25:15] and may you recognize him as he
[25:18] calls out to his own for my sheep hear
[25:22] my voice
[25:23] and a stranger they shall not
[25:27] oh they will not follow a stranger but
[25:29] they'll stay
[25:31] with the word of god amen
[25:35] so eve had a choice
[25:39] and through the tree of knowledge
[25:41] through
[25:42] him the tree of knowledge through him
[25:46] satan possessing
[25:49] and using a serpent
[25:52] deceived eve as to the
[25:57] meaning and of obedience
[26:01] to the word of god for that hour
[26:05] and she turned away from the tree of
[26:07] life
[26:08] and went to eat from the tree
[26:12] of knowledge and wisdom amen
[26:16] all of this happened when it was natural
[26:18] back there but what is happening what is
[26:20] for it for
[26:21] our day amen my friends
[26:25] these two trees are so
[26:28] real and and look so similar
[26:33] that if you don't know what you're doing
[26:37] it's so they're so it's not near the
[26:40] truth
[26:41] it's so near to the revelation
[26:44] of the owl and which a carnal mind and
[26:48] senses
[26:49] but one of these persons
[26:53] that can manipulate the word and speak
[26:56] the word
[26:58] and use it marvelously
[27:03] one can hardly detect the difference
[27:07] between a human ability
[27:11] and the re revelation
[27:15] of the word of god for this hour
[27:18] oh blessed be his holy name
[27:22] knowledge and the tree of life
[27:26] oh praise god amen
[27:29] almost identical
[27:32] amen and you can't detect them
[27:36] with just your natural senses
[27:40] by just looking at them but it will take
[27:43] a revelation
[27:45] a discerning of the lord's body
[27:49] of truth in this day and in this hour
[27:53] by hebrews 4 12 for the word of god
[27:58] the word of god revealed to you makes
[28:00] you
[28:01] and makes it quick and sharp as a
[28:04] two-edged sword
[28:06] within you and makes itself
[28:09] manifest and revealed hallelujah glory
[28:13] be to god now listen
[28:16] god of this evil age we find now
[28:21] this evil age
[28:25] is to prove to satan
[28:28] that she the bride of this hour
[28:32] is not like eve hallelujah
[28:35] first of all she is going to be proven
[28:39] just as the others were proven she's
[28:42] going to be
[28:43] tested just like the other
[28:46] eve was tested she's going to be
[28:50] presented
[28:51] with both things knowledge
[28:54] and life truth amen
[28:58] she will be presented with both of them
[29:02] the tree of knowledge sounds so innocent
[29:05] because it's good to know and it sounds
[29:08] so innocent and so
[29:10] real hallelujah and
[29:14] those persons
[29:17] oh my will even quote the bible
[29:21] to you just like satan did in the garden
[29:25] of heaven
[29:26] well listen he knew the quotes he knew
[29:29] the scriptures
[29:31] he knew the bible that is why he could
[29:34] say
[29:35] did not god say such and such and such
[29:38] and such
[29:39] and he was able to accurately quote
[29:42] god's word and then
[29:46] he knew it so well that he knew exactly
[29:49] where
[29:50] just to drop one word in
[29:53] one word to taught to pervert
[29:57] to twist to undermine and
[30:00] subvert the kingdom of the most high god
[30:04] amen yes sir
[30:08] they're going to cut that bible they're
[30:11] even going to quote the message
[30:13] given to us in this hour they're going
[30:16] to hang on to the bible
[30:19] and they're going to hang on to the
[30:21] words
[30:22] the quotes the written
[30:25] quotes of the day
[30:28] and for this hour hallelujah
[30:32] amen and that but there in our day

[34:18] god
[34:20] they'll turn around and say but but my
[34:22] bible doesn't say that
[34:27] you say but the prophet said i don't
[34:29] care what the prophet says
[34:32] amen it's what the bible says that cults
[34:36] my because what the prophet said
[34:39] came from the bible so therefore it's
[34:42] the
[34:42] bible that counts and that's what i'm
[34:46] going to
[34:47] alto is what i see
[34:50] in this bible oh my
[34:53] my friends such people
[34:58] such persons these

[35:05] seeds of the serpent generations

[35:16] own words the bible
[35:20] you think you know the scriptures
[35:23] for in them you'll take you find and
[35:25] have eternal life
[35:28] but you know not the scriptures not a
[35:30] power of god
[35:31] you know not the scriptures nor the
[35:34] revelation
[35:35] of the word of god in this day presence
[35:38] change of this ministry
[35:40] the present hour of the unfolding
[35:44] mystery of the word of god for his
[35:47] children
[35:47] and for his people amen hallelujah
[35:51] amen my friends in the bible
[35:55] i'll show you where this spirit came
[35:58] from
[35:59] there was a man called thomas
[36:03] and he was just as much a follower of
[36:06] jesus as
[36:07] all the rest but when they
[36:10] told him that the word was
[36:13] no more in the ground it was
[36:16] no more in the grave the word
[36:20] was no more buried no sir
[36:23] there was no body for you to go and see
[36:26] anymore
[36:27] you couldn't look at the written word
[36:29] laying there
[36:31] and identified that yes he's in the
[36:33] grave no
[36:34] he was risen and alive
[36:38] this disciples would not believe it
[36:41] at the time oh he would not receive that
[36:45] truth
[36:47] listen he said these immortal words
[36:52] that are within the golden pages of the
[36:55] scriptures
[36:57] except i see except i
[37:00] see the the wounds in his hands
[37:04] and the piercing in his side
[37:07] and accept my friends
[37:10] i put my hand into his side
[37:14] i will not believe we have that same
[37:18] spirit here today may god help you my
[37:21] friends even if you're like that there
[37:22] is still an opportunity for you
[37:25] that the holy spirit later on really
[37:28] opened the eyes of thomas and as you
[37:31] know
[37:31] thomas died as the apostle to india
[37:35] there he died on their various spears
[37:38] and was killed and his tomb is somewhere
[37:42] in india to this very day
[37:47] amen here stands a man
[37:51] he exactly will tell you all i believe
[37:54] brother branham was a prophet
[37:55] and that he is a prophet amen
[37:58] and he'll even caught from brother
[38:01] branham
[38:01] as a prophet amen
[38:04] and god might be even using that man
[38:08] in a marvelous and wonderful way
[38:12] where gifts and powers of god is flowing
[38:15] through his life
[38:17] in a marvelous way oh my
[38:20] but he'll still stand and say
[38:24] now the prophet said stay with the word
[38:28] stay with the word and so brother uh
[38:32] simon whatever you are saying uh
[38:35] i don't know uh what that is
[38:39] i don't know where that's coming from
[38:44] but i'm gonna stay with the world
[38:48] i'm just going to do that not turning to
[38:51] the
[38:52] left not to the right but regardless of
[38:55] what
[38:55] anybody says i'm going to stay
[38:58] with the word i'm gonna stay with what
[39:03] the prophet has said yes
[39:07] is in the scriptures yes
[39:10] you'll do that while you're a child
[39:13] you'll
[39:14] speak like a child you'll repeat
[39:17] what you hear your parents say like a
[39:20] child
[39:26] why because you're learning to speak
[39:29] this
[39:29] new language you're learning to get
[39:32] into that uh language you're learning to
[39:36] get within that race
[39:38] that super race the supernatural
[39:41] race hallelujah and so you at the
[39:45] first part when you are in your
[39:47] spiritual
[39:48] infancy then you will that the mamma
[39:52] dada
[39:52] you will do that hallelujah but after a
[39:56] while
[39:58] you continue to say exactly what
[40:02] he said or your parents said but you are
[40:05] now
[40:06] speaking it in your own words because
[40:09] you have now
[40:10] uh inculcated and matured
[40:15] into the rightness of the fruits of the
[40:17] word
[40:19] and the fruits of the word come forth
[40:22] with the power of the holy spirit for
[40:25] christ in you
[40:27] interpreting his own word and his own
[40:29] promises
[40:30] for this day and for this hour blessed
[40:34] be
[40:34] his holy name amen while you're a child
[40:37] you'll
[40:38] speak as a child but when you become
[40:40] mature
[40:41] a man or a woman yes you put away
[40:46] chinese things you'll put away
[40:49] all of that because you really
[40:52] understand what it means to stay
[40:56] with the word not just with the written
[40:59] word but the
[41:00] intent the motive the the meaning
[41:04] they the understanding the reading
[41:07] between the lines
[41:08] the revelation of the hour with which
[41:11] god anoints his people and uses them
[41:15] for his glory and for his honor listen i
[41:18] honestly believe that we were not called
[41:20] to be message
[41:21] parents because all the parent does to
[41:25] be safe
[41:27] is just to repeat whatever
[41:30] uh it was told uh polly pick a pepper
[41:34] polly pick the pepper polly pick the
[41:35] pepper
[41:36] whatever was told the pirate just
[41:40] parrots it
[41:41] oh you know the prophet said this and
[41:44] the prophet said that
[41:45] the prophet said and it's true nothing
[41:48] is wrong with
[41:48] it but who do you say i am
[41:52] who do you say i am what is your
[41:55] revelation that it will won't be
[41:57] different it'll be the same thing
[41:59] but who do you say i
[42:03] the son of man i am my goodness
[42:06] praise god hallelujah oh
[42:09] glory to his marvelous and wonderful
[42:13] name i want to thank god
[42:17] many have misunderstood and believe we
[42:21] are building a wall
[42:23] we are not here to build a wall because
[42:26] all you'll have to do is keep going
[42:29] straight
[42:30] and stay with that word and going one
[42:34] direction
[42:36] but we are not here he said to build a
[42:39] wall
[42:40] we are building a building and if you're
[42:44] building a building
[42:45] the building has corners
[42:48] the building has dispensations ages
[42:52] places where one has to change and turn
[42:57] to go on doing and accomplishing
[43:01] the right things for the living god
[43:04] all my friends i'm not
[43:08] even into this fullness
[43:11] of this sermon but i just want you to
[43:15] see here in this day in this
[43:19] hour that we are living in
[43:22] what god is doing oh yes you say
[43:26] oh uh brother oh what a blessing i was
[43:29] blessed this morning
[43:30] when the holy spirit showed me this or
[43:32] showed me that well
[43:34] my bible doesn't say that
[43:37] where did the prophet say that
[43:41] where did he say that could you show me
[43:43] the quote
[43:44] give me the page chapter verse year
[43:46] month
[43:47] tell me what meeting when did he say
[43:50] that
[43:51] oh my the devil's ears
[43:54] just listening that he might be able to
[43:57] let you
[43:58] listen to jesus to catch a hold of his
[44:01] words
[44:02] like that and to twist it in
[44:05] every possible way how deceptive
[44:10] how deceptive working true
[44:14] cain spirit of cain
[44:18] oh my the gang saying of cain
[44:22] come against the very word of the living
[44:26] god
[44:27] and yet one has to turn around and abel
[44:31] oh okay my brother and all the gifts and
[44:34] the fruits and the stature of a perfect
[44:36] man flowing out of him while he greets
[44:39] his brother
[44:40] not with a mockery not with hashem not
[44:43] written
[44:44] with acting but with real genuine
[44:47] love and grace of god knowing
[44:50] that their book came from the same womb
[44:54] but from different fathers one of
[44:57] god and one of the devil they're in the
[45:00] same church
[45:02] putting the same bible cutting the same
[45:05] coats
[45:06] one of god and one of the devil
[45:09] recognize that and still like god
[45:14] are able to be impartial pure love
[45:18] and purity of the grace of the living
[45:22] god
[45:24] oh my think of it oh
[45:27] my god it's very deceptive if this great
[45:30] holy spirit had not
[45:32] come down and revealed himself to me
[45:36] as to others then you will not be
[45:39] able to discern that how
[45:43] sin it is narrow a razor blade my
[45:47] brother
[45:47] sister can hardly pass between the
[45:50] the true and the false the deception of
[45:53] the
[45:54] hour and the unfailing reality of the
[45:57] of the revealed word of god for this day
[46:01] and for this time o blessed be his holy
[46:04] name
[46:05] o praise god if the holy spirit had not
[46:08] come
[46:09] and revealed or make known his word
[46:13] to my heart and as i've said to the
[46:15] heart
[46:16] of others who have caught this
[46:19] revelation which put them in another
[46:22] dimension
[46:23] yes sir we would fall for this
[46:26] great thing we would fall for this great
[46:31] thing we are seeing over here
[46:34] we'll fall for the ministry of this
[46:35] animated person
[46:37] animated yes this
[46:41] animal beast
[46:45] possessed and used
[46:48] by satan to be his mouthpiece his voice
[46:52] spouting the scriptures the mystery
[46:56] the revelation
[46:59] they think is the genuine one but
[47:02] they're spouting it from the quotations
[47:05] from the from the quotations of
[47:07] scripture
[47:08] and of the prophet and yet
[47:12] i will speak personally
[47:16] in the casting out the devils which god
[47:19] has used me
[47:22] discernment of spirits in which god
[47:25] has used me i've talked with the devil
[47:29] face to face and many a brother
[47:34] sisters who claim to be followers
[47:38] of this message but anointed by the evil
[47:42] one
[47:43] yes this great thing is happening now
[47:48] great hour of deception shall not be
[47:52] dark nor light but at evening
[47:55] time it shall be light again oh thank
[47:58] god light has come from heaven
[48:01] light has made itself known and i can
[48:04] stand here
[48:06] as a witness to say the truth
[48:09] because there before you you have your
[48:12] choice
[48:14] to eat from the tree of life
[48:17] the rough you revelation
[48:20] of the word of god or the sweet
[48:23] succulent
[48:24] fruit of some coming out of the mouth
[48:28] voice of a mighty bible
[48:32] teacher
[48:35] great church or a great movement
[48:39] which makes you feel secure
[48:42] because you're surrounded by that
[48:46] but my friends as i begin to wind this
[48:49] down
[48:49] right now i want to urge you
[48:53] turn your eyes upon jesus look full in
[48:56] his
[48:57] wonderful face and the things of this
[49:00] earth will grow
[49:01] strangely them in the light of his glory
[49:04] and grace
[49:05] come back to the tree of life feed
[49:09] from the tree of life and receive life
[49:13] and bear the twelve fruits of revelation
[49:15] 22
[49:17] and receive in your life the healing of
[49:20] all the nations
[49:21] and plant yourself by the rivers of
[49:24] living water oh glory to god
[49:26] may the holy spirit bless you today my
[49:28] brothers my sisters
[49:30] and go with you and bring you again
[49:34] our next coming together
[49:37] will be wednesday when we will be
[49:39] teaching on the church ages

[49:44] back into the word of god talking about
[49:48] these two mysterious trees
[49:51] that were back in the garden of eden
[49:55] and are now here with us today
[49:59] may god richly bless you as we come
[50:02] together again
[50:03] in his marvelous and wonderful
[50:06] name god bless you real good
[50:13] [Music]
[50:44] you
