[0:00] I'm not just saying I know repeating
[0:03] words but I know this resurrection
[0:08] I hope you this I woke up this morning
[0:13] and he was asleep that you're seeing a
[0:30] man I really appreciate as a ministry to
[0:37] really appreciate myself I did
[0:40] appreciate another bike because when
[0:43] you're a minister in your back there
[0:45] you're just looking for the Holy Ghost
[0:47] only goes to confirm
[0:54] the only sense or the word Amen always
[0:57] has for his spirit reward will come
[1:00] forth to prepare the hearts of the
[1:03] people preparing you to receive
[1:06] something from him not me I just want to
[1:11] say that because it's it just lifts our
[1:14] faithful if you haven't seen him moving
[1:22] a lot lately your might get on your
[1:25] knees and bring his something
[1:27] hallelujah shake yourself there's
[1:31] nothing greater than seeing the Holy
[1:33] Ghost in our lives
[1:35] Amen there's so much to say here today I
[1:38] said to my wife I said one day my
[1:40] minister next she goes all the 13th next
[1:44] Sunday Mother's Day order finger and she
[2:01] goes no fire brimstone feminine
[2:08] you know the movie Pollyanna every time
[2:10] they came out of service I said you know
[2:13] I said to me if brother Grantham talked
[2:20] about a minister he preached eight times
[2:22] on repentance
[2:24] they came to us said do you have
[2:26] anything else what we you know
[2:28] repentance is oh yeah so the people
[2:30] repent first we're all kinds of the
[2:34] suffering and the Lord will have
[2:38] something for you amen and hopefully
[2:41] it's not that bad it's Mother's Day I
[2:47] don't have a Mother's Day message but
[2:50] you know I was reading in I didn't
[2:54] realize brother Brennan preached the
[2:55] message on Mother's Day and so I went
[2:58] through a few things here and I just
[3:01] want to read a few things before I get
[3:03] into the message today amen because I
[3:06] think we should honor
[3:06] [Music]
[3:09] no thought created whether special they
[3:12] have a position when they're in that
[3:14] position I brother Mike was just saying
[3:16] out is being met everything understand
[3:19] there I really have to see when you're
[3:30] you know surrendered and the hands and
[3:33] cause there's mothers are good mothers
[3:35] but in the hands of God there's nobody
[3:39] that can pray like the mother or their
[3:41] children I was told my wife I pray when
[3:44] I get a smart but no plan no men can
[3:48] pray like the mother's heart can pray
[3:50] for their children tankini and that's us
[3:53] where the mother wants to be in the
[3:56] hands of God because that's where
[4:00] [Music]
[4:05] everybody find your positions in Christ
[4:11] [Music]
[4:13] and he will amen
[4:18] Jeremiah 1:5 I knew thee before I formed
[4:24] you in your mother's womb before you
[4:27] were born I set you apart and anointed
[4:29] you as my prophet to the nation's
[4:33] now I read this morning that mothers
[4:36] woman who are wonderfully wandering away
[4:41] from God that they will come to
[4:44] themselves this morning and will
[4:47] recognize that what the word mother
[4:49] means one who has begotten may she
[4:54] realized that the offsprings of her
[4:57] union with her husband has been sacred
[5:01] little jerk June James that God has
[5:05] placed under her
[5:07] the inaudible hold her responsible for
[5:09] the rear and raisin on those children
[5:12] and as the scripture says a good woman
[5:16] and the mother what she is about her
[5:21] children will call her blessed Lord
[5:24] would you not by no means forget to
[5:27] think we will forget to thank you for
[5:31] real brothers for we know that we have
[5:34] such living today real genuine mothers
[5:38] God bless them they are great treasures
[5:41] to us and we pray that you will continue
[5:44] to be with them Lord and may they live
[5:48] happy and see the fruit other rooms
[5:51] serving God amen that's what we want to
[5:56] see all our children working for me and
[5:58] my house we will serve the Lord
[6:00] I know sometimes it doesn't look that
[6:03] way but we look to what God word and we
[6:15] pray that those who wear the white robes
[6:19] this morning or the white flour to say
[6:22] that their mother has passed beyond this
[6:25] scene of action today
[6:26] may the Lord God give them the rest of
[6:30] peace out there leaders that will follow
[6:33] them
[6:34] Brenden Lord now take my word and speak
[6:37] to the people and give them comfort
[6:39] gather here to feel your presence to
[6:43] hear your word and be blessed and leave
[6:46] here a better man
[6:48] woman boys and girls that we were only
[6:52] after did we ask this in Jesus name
[6:55] I think the thoughts of mothers and I
[7:01] have one thing this morning by the grace
[7:04] of God still here on earth with us I am
[7:09] grateful for mother and being that we
[7:13] were to have also a healing service and
[7:16] not knowing that I would be back tonight
[7:19] but I thought maybe that it could paint
[7:22] a different picture here mothers is so
[7:27] great you know the first one you wear
[7:30] that receives you in life as your mother
[7:33] no one can touch you like your mother
[7:37] can because you're here conceived from
[7:41] her and she bears you under her heart
[7:45] and she is the first thing to know you
[7:48] and the first thing in this life to hold
[7:52] you when you're born she's the one the
[7:58] first hand is to touch you in white pack
[8:00] the tears from your eyes she's the first
[8:03] one to pat you and to love you and to
[8:06] come over you in this life is your
[8:08] mother now I think that there's enough
[8:12] there's not enough other that we could
[8:16] give to a mother mother's first with the
[8:20] child as she is great the great
[8:22] responsibility of what a child would be
[8:25] will be based upon the way the weather
[8:29] starts a child on the path and it must
[8:32] travel mothers have the responsibility
[8:35] from God to place that child right on
[8:39] and I think that's why mothers have a
[8:43] special touch
[8:44] I know the boy in the city and he goes
[8:48] on here just going to bypass that he
[8:51] goes on to talk about a man that drinks
[8:55] the likes older men and every time he
[8:58] gets drunk he still comes home and I
[9:00] submit mother once mother amen
[9:04] oh I never stop there there's so much I
[9:09] can read about this but we understand
[9:19] wonderful I have a my mother we're still
[9:27] alive by God's grace I had the mother my
[9:30] children my wife I have my daughter
[9:44] [Music]
[9:48] and be strong in the Lord be strong you
[9:58] [Music]
[10:04] are not relying on our own ability amen
[10:10] we're relying on him he's the one who
[10:14] called us amen
[10:16] he's the one who started to work amen he
[10:19] knew me when I was at my mother's move
[10:22] he knew he's going to call me to this I
[10:24] didn't ask to come to this I wasn't
[10:27] seeking for this this truth that we have
[10:31] he called he brought me to this that's
[10:36] my faith and that is my belief he knows
[10:40] the mistakes that I lived the mistakes
[10:43] that you will make he knows the
[10:45] weaknesses in your flesh but beyond all
[10:48] that he placed an attribute inside of
[10:50] you
[10:51] himself and he said that attribute amen
[10:55] will not return to b-boy but it will
[10:57] accomplish what I set forth to do
[10:59] absolute will overcome no matter what
[11:03] our carnal mind thinks above our selves
[11:07] our flesh and our weaknesses like get us
[11:10] down sometimes you will even write and
[11:15] we'll bring everything I believe with
[11:17] all our heart they will bring everything
[11:20] subject to the word of
[11:22] in my it will bring something
[11:25] that's my Amen other such dead breathe
[11:32] the word this morning John 18:37 see
[11:44] which way the Lord's I don't know which
[11:46] way he's gonna move this morning or what
[11:48] he's going to say what he's gonna do get
[11:51] a bow for me good sleep feeling just
[11:57] what a minister coaster sometimes just
[12:01] bring the Word of God but maybe receive
[12:06] it this morning that you pull out the
[12:08] Word of God amen
[12:10] I want to speak on what is truth I mean
[12:14] I can't really speak on what is truth
[12:17] right because no man has the ability to
[12:20] do that Pilate therefore said unto Him
[12:27] art thou a king then jesus answered thou
[12:33] says that I indicated to this end I was
[12:37] born and for this cause came I into the
[12:41] world that I should bear witness unto
[12:43] the truth every one that is of the truth
[12:49] heareth my voice posture setup enemy
[12:53] what is truth and when he has sent this
[12:58] he went out again unto the Jews and said
[13:03] unto them I find in him no fault
[13:13] as soon as pilot said what is truth what
[13:19] was he asking what is the revelation of
[13:24] who you are remember that is the keys of
[13:28] the difference appear not apart rock or
[13:31] church or even upon Jesus but the
[13:32] revelation of who Jesus was but after he
[13:37] just went up he went away from him so
[13:42] many times we see the Bible people are
[13:45] are covering up over some panic and just
[13:50] walk away and then the Adventist apply
[13:53] that I find in him no fault what is the
[14:00] truth father thank you for your love
[14:04] grace and mercy this world I just commit
[14:09] myself into your hands the people into
[14:11] your hands Lord what is the truth Lord
[14:15] you said I am the truth waiting the life
[14:20] father this is not placed in men's heads
[14:24] that never has been this has been your
[14:30] plan and you have been fulfilling it all
[14:35] down through the ages and will complete
[14:37] it father
[14:39] lord I pray that you would take every
[14:41] spirit sucked into the whole peoples in
[14:44] this place this morning something to the
[14:48] Word of God to you father may you bless
[14:53] each and every one I remember as we
[14:56] spoke our brothers Lord may you bless
[15:00] and give what they have an Edith Lord so
[15:05] that their children may rise up and call
[15:08] them blessing father
[15:10] taking full of us now as we place
[15:13] ourselves behind the cross forgive us of
[15:17] our sins washed us and cleanse us fully
[15:23] through by your precious blood and
[15:28] Phyllis we ask in Jesus name
[15:36] how do we I was wondering what I was
[15:43] going to speak on us week I spoke on
[15:46] Jesus is the truth of life and the way
[15:49] at the nursery and I just was prepared
[15:53] something else on a series that I had
[15:57] and just turned right around and I
[16:04] thought came back in my mind
[16:05] Jesus the truth the way in the life and
[16:11] so I was just you know a minister looks
[16:14] where the work looks for God's leading
[16:17] we just want to fall into a channel that
[16:20] he can speak and brother Phillip was
[16:25] preaching Wednesday night a wonderful
[16:27] message on making your choices near
[16:31] decisions determines your destination
[16:33] and he was preaching sit down I was get
[16:39] bless and then he came right over to the
[16:42] side here and he looked at me says
[16:44] that's the truth brother tip and
[16:47] anointing the fire of God come upon me
[16:50] right there he didn't know that yeah I
[16:52] asked about the services any remember
[16:54] one
[16:55] so God has truth God has something for
[16:59] us to date
[16:59] I collect and here in the scriptures we
[17:05] see what is the truth and so many people
[17:11] like Pontius Pilate they are asking
[17:13] today what is the truth and the second
[17:19] thing the body that you look back into
[17:21] the world and you see in the world
[17:23] amen they don't know what truth is
[17:26] because because they haven't been given
[17:28] truth well that's the sad thing about it
[17:32] right I growth roses on that date you're
[17:36] going to you know there's not the
[17:37] drunker that's going to be disappointed
[17:38] is that the gambler is going to be
[17:40] disappointed it's the one that is read
[17:43] into the church and beaten under this
[17:46] massive beam under which I believe is
[17:49] the word of God for the out I believe is
[17:53] a genuine true prophet of God and the
[17:56] word comes from I don't just say that
[18:01] but the holy ghost has revealed that to
[18:04] me straight
[18:05] amen that's how I believe it that the
[18:09] truth is what God reveals truth to me
[18:12] and people sit down with his ministry
[18:16] wandering to and fro back and forth and
[18:21] not knowing what truth is it's not just
[18:24] good enough to know the doctor it's not
[18:26] good enough to know the mysteries of the
[18:30] Prophet truth to you what is truth in
[18:35] your life this has to wake us up to make
[18:41] us realize who we are we recognize who
[18:45] he is
[18:46] you recognize who we are robots amen
[18:50] brother brother Krabs said brother
[18:53] doesn't find a bunch of robots and i
[18:56] repeating him and tried to interpreter
[19:00] or duplicate what he did but he wanted
[19:12] sons and daughters of god to raise up to
[19:15] recognize who they are but truth is that
[19:20] sons and daughters will come to maturity
[19:22] and this
[19:26] they could be walking talking lining
[19:31] herself up with the word she do now by
[19:44] using obey and the Spirit of God what it
[19:50] takes
[19:51] truth and text revelation into an
[19:54] individual life that come so that we can
[19:58] do that John 16:13 of it when the Spirit
[20:06] of Truth has come he will guide you into
[20:10] all truth for he shall not speak of
[20:13] himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[20:16] that shall he speak and he will show you
[20:21] things to come
[20:22] you see when the spirit of truth comes
[20:27] into your life now break this down
[20:30] personally to you that spine is very
[20:34] important amen
[20:36] people are not taken seriously enough
[20:39] you know in seeking for the Holy Ghost
[20:42] right the Holy Ghost is not just an
[20:45] experience is not just a baptism but the
[20:53] Holy Ghost is the spirit of truth comes
[20:55] in trials we need to seek for truth we
[21:08] have a lot we have a journey that we're
[21:14] on we have situations in our lives
[21:19] totally
[21:20] we have things that we see about
[21:23] ourselves weaknesses about ourselves
[21:26] amen
[21:27] we going on we need and we have to
[21:34] overcome certain things in our office as
[21:36] God reveals it to us we need truth as
[21:43] individuals hey men and John 8:32 you
[21:50] breathe for me to find a channel of the
[21:55] Lord I'm trusting in him John 8:32 and
[22:00] you shall know the truth and the truth
[22:02] shall make you free
[22:05] amen no other way where the sphere of
[22:13] truth comes into our lives
[22:16] it will reveal all things to us that we
[22:19] need to know and we not true cons and
[22:23] only when that food comes it sets us
[22:26] free
[22:27] amen hallelujah jesus said in John 14:6
[22:35] Thomas in up the hip Lord we know not
[22:37] whither thou goest and how can we know
[22:40] the weight jesus said unto him I am the
[22:44] way the truth and the life no man comes
[22:48] to the Father but by me if he had known
[22:52] me yet should I have known my father you
[22:55] know me and from henceforth you know him
[22:58] and have seen him
[23:03] the Lord Jesus said I am the light of
[23:07] the world John 8:12 he said I am the
[23:11] truth Jesus tells the Lord's tell us in
[23:17] the Lord's work also of all truth
[23:21] according to the Bible the Lord is the
[23:24] light and
[23:25] and the word and the word which is also
[23:29] the truth is light in the loop in the
[23:32] word there is light there are the word
[23:35] and the light and the truth are one team
[23:39] John 14:1 1:14 speaks of the word
[23:47] becoming flesh tabernacle amongst us
[23:50] full of grace and truth speaks of the
[23:54] law that was given through Moses but
[23:56] grace and truth through Jesus Christ
[24:02] when we believe that the Lord Jesus we
[24:05] received grace and truth and the first
[24:10] pissed off John is says God is love and
[24:12] God is light when God comes to us we
[24:16] receive grace but we go to him he is
[24:20] love grace is the realization and the
[24:24] expression of love loves the source and
[24:27] grace of expression likewise truth is
[24:31] the realization an expression of light
[24:33] light is the source and truth is the
[24:37] expression but light is concealed from
[24:41] us is nearly light but when it shines
[24:44] upon us it becomes truth whatever light
[24:49] shines we receive truth light shines in
[24:54] darkness verses psychic Timothy the two
[24:58] books dealing with a deviation of truth
[25:01] is mentioned often because in this
[25:04] period of darkness there is a need for
[25:07] the light to shine and express truth is
[25:11] the shining light wherever there is
[25:13] light there is God God is light yayin
[25:18] Romans 8 all encourages us to walk
[25:21] according to the
[25:23] but John and the second third epistle
[25:26] also says in the time of darkness walk
[25:30] in the truth although in this other
[25:36] writings John emphasizes light to these
[25:38] to hit missiles he speaks much of up
[25:40] truth and if you go back to the book of
[25:45] John you'll see he speaks a lot about
[25:48] the truth I have no greater joy than
[25:51] these things that I hear my children out
[25:53] lock it in the truth whenever we are in
[25:59] times of darkness
[26:01] we need that light to shine so we may
[26:04] walk in the proper way
[26:06] amen hallelujah glory to God pops the
[26:14] question what is truth many people today
[26:21] are asking what is truth inside the
[26:25] Bible there are many stories and God
[26:30] reveals many things to us about this
[26:34] world the lust and the heat decline but
[26:38] the Bible tells the truth about the good
[26:41] the bad and the ugly
[26:43] the Bible tells the truth about Satan
[26:47] and his deception amen Jesus wasn't
[26:51] afraid to call seasoned a liar and the
[26:56] father of lies either so many people are
[27:02] afraid the truth that's right above us
[27:07] taking place out there
[27:11] tell them the truth about sing but it's
[27:18] the truth
[27:19] Jesus wasn't afraid he says with the
[27:24] devil speaks he speaks on his own
[27:27] resources he's a liar and the father of
[27:30] it the first time that a man have to
[27:33] make a choice between God's truth and
[27:34] the devil's lie he choose that that was
[27:38] high amen
[27:48] so many times we get caught between the
[27:51] crossfire there's always the two voices
[27:55] speaking to you in your life one place
[28:00] is the voice of God which is truth will
[28:03] lead you down a certain path yes the
[28:06] voice is the voice lies
[28:11] amen
[28:14] the voice of God will always lead you to
[28:17] overcome to prosper to grow Puglia to go
[28:22] forward in your walk with Christ the
[28:26] other voice that you listen to the voice
[28:30] of lies will always cause you eyes and
[28:34] mouth scars whenever the rejected God's
[28:40] truth and accepted that was lies at that
[28:44] moment all the trouble in the whole
[28:46] world begin our sinful nature decides
[28:53] that that was lie instead of God's truth
[28:55] that's the battle that is going on you
[29:00] got to realize what is truth and the
[29:02] truth
[29:03] the body that your eliminates the pest
[29:06] house the cart of mine that founds
[29:09] against the spiritual mind is at enmity
[29:12] with God so every day of your life that
[29:16] you wake up every choice that you make
[29:19] every and we try resurface that you come
[29:22] and base within your life you're faced
[29:26] with these to the flesh and the spirit
[29:31] they're making choices all the time as
[29:34] brother Phillip 7 on Wednesday that will
[29:37] determine your destination and that will
[29:40] determine your walk determine what you
[29:43] will become
[29:44] no God trying to bring his children
[29:50] bring them to a place to make the right
[29:53] choices in their life the choose the
[29:57] truth but you must not the truth you
[30:00] must know that your greatest enemies not
[30:04] your brother and sister your greatest
[30:06] enemies yourself amen it's yourself
[30:13] we're so worried about keeping everybody
[30:16] in line the discusses we're so worried
[30:18] about this person say this person saying
[30:20] that are judging this person are
[30:23] criticizing that person are doing
[30:26] [Music]
[30:36] you become nothing and you realize they
[30:41] but you realize when you're nothing you
[30:47] got no right to look at anybody else
[30:49] that's right
[31:00] citizen disease that affects the entire
[31:03] human race
[31:04] the disease of sin is in the heart of
[31:10] the troubles of the world
[31:12] so those involved in this dying world
[31:15] Satan will come up with his evil this
[31:19] even power or they have refused the
[31:23] truth which good we don't want to refuse
