[22:44] we reading from Isaiah 61 to2 says Rise
[22:50] Shine for the light is come and the
[22:54] glory of the Lord is rising upon thee
[23:00] for
[23:01] Behold The Darkness shall cover the
[23:05] Earth and close
[23:07] Darkness the people but the Lord shall
[23:12] rise upon thee and His glory shall be
[23:18] seen upon
[23:21] thee one scripture
[23:25] again Daniel 4:12
[23:29] before you sit down
[23:31] thou but thou oh Daniel shut up the W
[23:37] and seal up and seal the book
[23:43] even to the time of the end many shall
[23:48] run to and
[23:51] fro and knowledge shall be
[23:56] increased may the Lord add is blessing
[23:59] please sit
[24:06] down praise the
[24:11] Lord when we read Isaiah 60 it says Rise
[24:16] and
[24:18] Shine who is the person that this
[24:21] scripture is speaking to remember let
[24:24] the scriptures speak to you in uh uh
[24:29] compound meaning because H H he spoke to
[24:33] the old
[24:34] Saints and it h is continuing to speak
[24:38] to you and me
[24:40] today so even though let's take it back
[24:45] to the gental days it has spoken to
[24:48] Luther it has spoken to Wesley it has
[24:52] spoken to
[24:53] Pentecost and also is now speaking to us
[24:58] as present
[24:59] tense so put up your thinking cap
[25:04] because I'm not talking about the old
[25:07] sins I'm talking about you the present
[25:11] truth so when we read it and the
[25:14] scripture is saying rise
[25:16] shine is talking about you the light has
[25:21] come because who is that light God the
[25:26] Lord Jesus Christ is that light who has
[25:30] risen up in in the and he want you to
[25:33] shine he want you to obey his word he
[25:38] want you to heal yourself come out from
[25:41] your comfort zone so that the light will
[25:43] shine bright and brighter and brighter
[25:47] because the hour we live in is in Sodom
[25:50] and gomorra the whole world right the
[25:54] churches are in what Sodom the
[25:56] denominations are in Sodom
[25:58] so God is telling you and I we shouldn't
[26:02] stay in darkness we shouldn't stay in
[26:05] Sodom because the brother Mike was
[26:07] talking about they were baptizing a lady
[26:11] and he saw how the spirit was mangling
[26:15] her and doing things like a demon spirit
[26:20] and he was looking at it and he was
[26:24] talking about seeing about it and
[26:27] recognized in him right because he
[26:31] because he has risen and his his the
[26:36] light has risen upon sorry the light has
[26:39] risen upon brother Mike and he is living
[26:42] with the word so once anything that is
[26:46] contrary to God word that light in him
[26:50] sees it right so God is saying rise up
[26:56] and let that light that I have put in
[26:59] you
[27:00] shine don't let that light be deed don't
[27:04] let that light keep you in darkness
[27:07] because at this hour what the Lord is
[27:10] saying I have given you everything that
[27:14] is in in the Lord he has pour into you
[27:18] it is you that have to shine it is you
[27:21] that have to let the word made manifest
[27:24] in you so that when people come and
[27:28] contact you they know that they are
[27:31] contacting something that can help them
[27:35] because in these times people are let us
[27:38] be honest people are going crazy out
[27:40] there the churches has gone into Sodom
[27:43] they can't help them
[27:46] H Insanity has taken places in the
[27:50] churches and God is saying it is you
[27:55] that I am going to use it is you I'm
[27:58] using and I'm going to use so shine draw
[28:02] closer to me because when you draw
[28:05] closer to me the light begin to shine
[28:08] more and more and more because bradeson
[28:10] was preaching he talk about when you are
[28:14] in darkness and in the room you cannot
[28:18] see you'll be bouncing your knees you'll
[28:20] be bouncing your head on the wall and
[28:23] you go like this is is is right brother
[28:28] demonstrate that on Wednesdays when he
[28:30] was preaching and so is it when darkness
[28:34] come in your life you cannot see the
[28:36] light but the light has come the prophet
[28:40] William Braham came right with the word
[28:44] for the Pentecostal day they saw
[28:48] Miracles since even the word of God came
[28:53] I believe because Jesus said the works
[28:56] that I do you will do more shall you do
[29:01] Greater Works shall you do so he let
[29:03] brother Braham he came through him to
[29:06] demonstrate that to the Pentecostals to
[29:09] see see right after that Christ came
[29:14] down
[29:15] 1963 to call you and
[29:18] me right you and me our light is not
[29:23] William Braham even though we thank God
[29:25] for William Braham we are appreciate him
[29:28] for what he has done for us because he
[29:32] was a prophet there's no question about
[29:34] that but our messenger is the mighty
[29:37] Angel and he is here he is shining the
[29:41] light Hallelujah so allowed yourself so
[29:45] that you yield yourself you and that
[29:48] light become one people will see it when
[29:51] you go places when you are working in
[29:54] places signs and wonders the Bible says
[29:57] signs and wonders will follow them that
[29:59] believe the power of God will come down
[30:03] let me tell you you saw what even I'm
[30:06] going to go back again brother deson was
[30:09] telling you show you his brother is true
[30:13] he was a king Satan has crippled
[30:17] him with struck sitting down but the
[30:20] brother playay we we me and philli we
[30:23] all join up lay hands on him and he walk
[30:26] even brother Des didn't show all the
[30:30] picture like you could see in the
[30:33] evening they told me because I can
[30:35] preach my
[30:37] language and they told me to preach you
[30:40] will see that the whole village people
[30:43] has come around us why because they live
[30:47] in that Village and they know that King
[30:50] was sick with
[30:51] stroke and they saw him
[30:55] walking why we pray for him
[30:59] so the light was shining for them to see
[31:04] even if they don't take it that's a
[31:06] witness to them that Jesus Christ live
[31:10] every person that saw
[31:13] that can refuse
[31:15] it not many will will receive this
[31:19] message this me this kind of gospel is
[31:22] for the
[31:23] elect but at least we we preaching to
[31:27] two class of
[31:29] people the true bride and the souls that
[31:33] will be in
[31:34] prison and also sorry the foolish virgin
[31:37] two so it's three
[31:39] class right so our part is to
[31:43] demonstrate the light that Christ has
[31:48] put in us for the people to see and to
[31:52] know but if we stay with
[31:56] ourself if if we we don't come to the
[32:00] house of the Lord and set under the
[32:03] gospel we are not going to
[32:06] grow because a seed without water
[32:10] putting in the Shelf what do you think
[32:12] going to
[32:13] happen nothing going to happen and I'm
[32:17] afraid a lot of people want to their
[32:20] Christianity is like they the seed in
[32:22] them even they children of God by they
[32:25] putting it in the
[32:26] Shelf God don't want Chef
[32:30] Christianity come and let the water fall
[32:33] on it okay let the water of God come on
[32:38] the seed when it come it will
[32:42] remove
[32:43] every nasty thing that the devil trying
[32:47] to put on the seed it will remove it and
[32:50] it will make the seed do what bring
[32:53] forth it will make the seed do what
[32:56] shine do what the Lord want that seed to
[33:00] do you don't have to do
[33:03] anything it's not your dedication the
[33:06] Lord want it's not your literate the
[33:09] Lord want it's not your money or your
[33:13] popularity or how you can uh talk big or
[33:18] speak small or quiet this no the Lord
[33:21] don't need all those things all he need
[33:24] is come and set he has chose you come
[33:28] and set in the
[33:31] light the light will do the job you
[33:35] don't have to do nothing because once
[33:39] God you're sitting under the word of God
[33:44] and the word is
[33:46] preached you may think you alone can do
[33:49] it you can none of us alone can do
[33:54] it none can do it you may have a big
[34:00] portion I may have like this but that
[34:04] like that small like that you need it to
[34:06] come and fit that your big
[34:10] portion yes you need
[34:13] it that's why so if you say oh I'm a big
[34:18] preacher you can speak go this that I
[34:20] don't need the left hand you see you
[34:24] walking with
[34:26] half
[34:28] human
[34:30] being because you need the right hand
[34:33] need the left hand the left hand need
[34:34] the right hand then we can walk so we
[34:39] need the light to shine through us why
[34:42] we come and set under it then because
[34:47] the darkness is so thick brothers and
[34:50] sisters when we look out there people
[34:53] are going crazy sickness are floating
[34:57] everywhere
[34:58] I was just telling our pastor I says
[35:00] look at even the the the
[35:03] Queen the king sorry King Charles his H
[35:06] son
[35:08] daughter they have all kinds of money
[35:10] but as soon as they tell Kate Kate
[35:12] recognize he's sick with cancer I I
[35:15] don't know about you I was watching and
[35:17] I'm seeing her face all what he's saying
[35:20] but you could see sadness on her her
[35:24] face right I wish she could come and see
[35:29] me and I meet her and I could talk to
[35:34] her what do you
[35:36] need I have
[35:39] it
[35:40] Glory what C need I have
[35:44] it the whole world may not have the
[35:47] Antidope all the doctors in the world
[35:49] may not have the Antidope for her but
[35:52] for R Cofe have it because you know
[35:56] why
[35:58] the
[35:59] light I set in the light who created all
[36:05] things his name is the Lord and Savior
[36:07] Jesus
[36:09] Christ let me tell you if not him you
[36:13] think I can stand
[36:14] here you all know I cannot stand here
[36:18] but with him huh I don't
[36:22] care I don't care one me I'm going to go
[36:26] on rejoicing I'm going to go on praising
[36:29] the Lord because absent from this body
[36:32] present with the Lord is so real to me
[36:35] so cancer oh no cancer sickness oh no
[36:38] sickness it doesn't bother
[36:41] coffee right happiness will come in me
[36:46] because why I won't let Crow Darkness
[36:49] take over me on don't let cross Darkness
[36:54] take over you you know why people they
[36:58] they are believers but you see they have
[37:01] lots of problems the reason why they
[37:04] don't want to sit in the light for the
[37:08] light to shine upon them because when
[37:11] you sit in the light the light
[37:14] shine
[37:15] every place that is not right God begin
[37:20] to let the preacher
[37:23] preach and do surgery spiritual surgery
[37:28] on the part of you that is not good he
[37:31] begin to do surgery to remove it with a
[37:35] 54
[37:37] Ministry if I don't get it Pastor will
[37:41] get it Philip will get it Des get it
[37:44] brother Tim will get it then that
[37:46] surgery will clean you
[37:49] up but if you stay
[37:52] home you can't get clean
[37:54] up then that thing will be there
[37:59] and you know even when you eat in a in a
[38:02] bowl when you cook in a bowl you ladies
[38:04] know when you don't clean it what do you
[38:07] think that bow going to
[38:10] do sometime to come it to be
[38:13] stink you understand it will give you
[38:16] when you pick it you you going to close
[38:18] your nose because why you didn't clean
[38:20] the the the bowl you eat
[38:23] inside but if you come and sit down for
[38:28] Sunday Wednesday I'm not saying you
[38:30] shouldn't work but I'm afraid some of us
[38:34] will let work Tak over us and the house
[38:38] of the Lord
[38:41] forsaken right God doesn't like that
[38:45] that's why some of us you see that we
[38:50] have problems we try to solve the
[38:52] problem but let me tell
[38:55] you everything you put
[39:28] [Music]
[39:46] [Applause]
[39:57] you cannot do
[39:59] it you cannot do it but when the Lord
[40:03] says hey I'm going to pay your
[40:07] debt it's just a
[40:10] simple thing you yourself going to know
[40:13] you didn't do it but he did it and it's
[40:16] so simple for you that time you can say
[40:20] my God why couldn't I see only the Lord
[40:23] could do it this is was there like a big
[40:26] mountain hunting
[40:27] me but because why the Lord knows your
[40:32] heart you set in his present all the
[40:36] time I know I'm preaching what I have
[40:39] passed
[40:40] through and what I'm saying if I haven't
[40:44] passed through I cannot preach it a lot
[40:46] of people can preach better than me talk
[40:50] about brother Brown better than me you
[40:53] understand but simple simple simple
[40:57] things
[40:59] like this they haven't passed
[41:02] through and even if you talk about
[41:06] miracles they haven't seen it all they
[41:09] know is the
[41:10] cause of brother Braham cause of the
[41:13] Bible they know it I can't compete with
[41:16] them but let me tell you you talk about
[41:19] signs and wonders God is my witness
[41:22] since I came to this message signs and
[41:25] wonders sometime when I used to live at
[41:28] Driftwood my room carpet I couldn't even
[41:32] afford
[41:33] carpet in the room my wife will be
[41:36] witness we bought pieces of carpet but
[41:39] morning I took you to ni Nick Nick was
[41:43] the place that he live in scabo he was
[41:46] selling carpet his place I went and
[41:49] bought pieces of carpet and put it in my
[41:53] room okay but I was coming to the house
[41:56] of God I know how to even come to the
[41:59] house of God living in
[42:01] shelter whereby I go I reach the shelter
[42:06] 12:00 there's no food I'm waking up and
[42:09] going to work tomorrow I've done all
[42:13] that because why God was trying me and
[42:18] during those times I used to I'm praying
[42:22] 3:00 God is my witness the Lord wake me
[42:26] says kofy go to such and such and such
[42:29] house somebody's praying he need
[42:33] $120 for his baby M his food the Lord
[42:37] can create everything for me God
[42:39] Almighty brother Braham God is my God
[42:42] I've seen that there's a
[42:45] brother he doesn't come regularly but
[42:47] sometime he's sitting here the person
[42:50] told
[42:52] him I've seen all
[42:56] that if you set in the
[43:00] light that light is able to show you
[43:05] things signs
[43:07] wonders raising the dead is nothing to
[43:10] the Lord this gospel brother BR preach
[43:15] and our pastor has preached to us
[43:18] raising the dead should be a biscuit for
[43:23] us should be a biscuit for each and
[43:27] every one of us it's nothing I'm not
[43:32] saying that is the absolute but that
[43:35] should be part of the
[43:39] Gospel but why the people are not coming
[43:44] to the presence of
[43:46] God because something is wrong somewhere
[43:50] I don't care how much you preach how
[43:53] much you think you know about brother
[43:54] Abraham Co show me the
[43:59] token brother Braham the reason why I
[44:02] believe brother Braham he show me the
[44:08] token why do you think make Pentecostal
[44:11] follow brother
[44:13] Braham why do you think you think
[44:17] brother Braham was some mighty man some
[44:21] knowledgeable no no no no no he showed
[44:24] them the
[44:26] token
[44:29] the
[44:30] life that's what I'm talking about the
[44:33] life that is in the word he brought it
[44:38] life so when we yield
[44:41] ourself and the
[44:44] sun the sun is telling us rise Shine the
[44:51] Light has
[44:54] come but a lot of people people they
[44:57] don't want the
[44:59] light that light that has come they want
[45:02] to play with the light listen we woman
[45:05] beings I'm number one we are
[45:08] lazy when it comes to serving the lord I
[45:11] don't know about
[45:13] you but one thing the Lord knows my
[45:16] heart no matter how weak I am no matter
[45:19] what happened to me I love to be in his
[45:24] presence because I know when I come one
[45:28] word from the
[45:30] pet one word from the brother one word
[45:34] from the child mouth one word from the
[45:37] sister I lift
[45:41] up I lift
[45:43] up you understand I lift up if you do
[45:47] like that let me tell you God love
[45:51] you God will love
[45:54] you I am not h a big big big fantasy H
[45:59] preacher or or this but I'm a
[46:04] practical person the way the Lord show
[46:08] me that's what I'm going to bring
[46:10] it okay so let us rise up Shine the
[46:15] Light Has Come Close Darkness we look
[46:19] around the world now we know the whole
[46:23] world is
[46:24] insane we don't need no prophecy to come
[46:27] is already
[46:30] here the ran cars the the car that
[46:34] nobody will drive no human being will
[46:38] drive about four or five years
[46:42] ago that time I was in Toronto I passed
[46:46] some place dandas and airport airport
[46:49] road I'm seeing Toyota
[46:52] raford going corner like that come
[46:55] corner like that going corner and I
[46:57] stood and
[46:58] watch what is
[47:01] this nobody was driving that
[47:04] car and that car was going and I'm
[47:07] looking it was like a Am I Dreaming or
[47:10] something so I really watch it something
[47:13] on top and the car was driving by
[47:17] itself what are we waiting
[47:21] for everything brother Braham
[47:25] spoke is here
[47:30] the churches who go in darkness he says
[47:34] I think he
[47:35] says if Pentecost the Rapture Ty in 50
[47:40] years Pentecost will be rotten more than
[47:43] the Catholic
[47:46] church and is not so
[47:50] today huh am I lying or
[47:54] truth is the truth right they are
[47:57] rotting more
[48:00] than that right it has get to
[48:06] Madness
[48:08] but let us
[48:11] shine let us come to the presence of
[48:15] God let
[48:17] us let the light that God has place in
[48:21] it in us because the seed is already
[48:24] laying in US
[48:28] that seed need light that it can shine
[48:32] and possess the Gate of his
[48:39] enemy that's all God is asking us he
[48:44] don't need no man interpretation people
[48:47] try to put interpretation this
[48:49] interpretation that all will wind up out
[48:54] God is his own interpreter yes he made
[48:58] the word what
[49:01] play and God hide in
[49:04] Simplicity God obedient is what better
[49:08] than
[49:09] what
[49:11] sacrifice when we give him
[49:15] obedience God will
[49:17] accomplish more than what we
[49:20] think because there's no mountain God
[49:23] cannot move you show me one m Mountain
[49:28] that God can move in your life man life
[49:31] even the preacher
[49:33] life God can move any mountain but he
[49:37] gave us free moral

[1:03:56] all the sickness and all the dead all
[1:03:59] the that was walking was the
[1:04:01] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in William
[1:04:05] Braham was doing that work and when he
[1:04:09] died he didn't die in jison Ville or he
[1:04:12] didn't go to the tomb that spirit is
[1:04:17] here when we went to brother brother Des
[1:04:20] Village that Spirit was there with us to
[1:04:24] let a
[1:04:27] a stroke King came out and
[1:04:36] walk the first day I went to Pastor
[1:04:39] Daniel church there was some commotion
[1:04:41] there I didn't know nothing I
[1:04:45] preach and the power of God begin
[1:04:49] to tell me and I say Brothers this that
[1:04:53] that that is going on God begin to move
[1:04:57] my mouth like
[1:04:59] that I've seen all that I'm I know I'm
[1:05:03] talking on the line if anybody here even
[1:05:06] if he here he will tell you even better
[1:05:08] than what I'm just speaking the church
[1:05:11] broke into
[1:05:12] two because some people they want to sit
[1:05:15] under
[1:05:16] pastor and gossip and speak against the
[1:05:20] pastor did they know how pain pastors go
[1:05:25] through
[1:05:26] even I'm just a little little little
[1:05:29] little speaker the Lord is Raising as
[1:05:33] rais here and let me tell you if you see
[1:05:38] a true
[1:05:40] Pastor who the Lord has
[1:05:43] raised you have to pray day and night
[1:05:46] for him his family pray day and night
[1:05:50] for him cuz it's not
[1:05:53] easy when you come in to preach reach
[1:05:56] the moment the time reach you have
[1:06:00] headache you can't
[1:06:03] sleep you cannot
[1:06:05] properly do things right it's like you
[1:06:09] the devil tried to throw you off you
[1:06:12] remember brother Braham was talking
[1:06:14] about when the Lord told her to go pray
[1:06:16] for
[1:06:18] one one Baptist Deacon daughter that was
[1:06:24] sick for 9 months
[1:06:26] he hasn't seen the light and his mommy
[1:06:29] has prayed even the Deon don't want h
[1:06:32] brother Brown to come to that place
[1:06:35] because he says anybody that even goes
[1:06:37] to brother Braham
[1:06:39] Church they will exate him or her and
[1:06:44] her mother was praying and brother
[1:06:46] Braham was praying and the Lord showed
[1:06:47] brother Braham go to that house and pray
[1:06:49] for her and brother
[1:06:53] Braham what I think he was about
[1:06:56] eat food and that
[1:07:00] moment he call and says no I cannot eat
[1:07:04] cuz the Lord have a work for me to go
[1:07:07] and do he go and he kneel
[1:07:10] down
[1:07:12] in the place he was playing was just
[1:07:15] like a bush area when he KNE down
[1:07:18] mosquito tried to bite him when he goes
[1:07:22] all kinds of trouble and trouble and he
[1:07:24] forget himself and begin to pray when he
[1:07:27] went and he prayed that was the
[1:07:30] place
[1:07:32] where the girl got up the piano his
[1:07:38] father came in 9 months he hasn't seen
[1:07:41] his daughter saw the
[1:07:44] sunshine and he came in the power of God
[1:07:48] came in and touched the girl right there
[1:07:51] and the girl was beginning to play the
[1:07:53] piano at that moment
[1:07:56] people thought the girl was dying when
[1:07:59] they came every that area Revival begin
[1:08:03] to broke
[1:08:04] up it's not an easy
[1:08:08] work Christianity is not an easy
[1:08:12] joke God is saying the light I have
[1:08:15] shine upon
[1:08:17] you all that was in God he pour into
[1:08:20] Christ all that was in Christ he pour
[1:08:24] into his wife the bride who is the
[1:08:26] church is you and me we have the Holy
[1:08:30] Spirit in
[1:08:31] us and if we set in the church
[1:08:36] pray come in the church the Lord will
[1:08:39] accomplish what he wanted to accomplish
[1:08:42] for
[1:08:43] us we think we are waiting for the
[1:08:46] Rapture to come the Rapture is waiting
[1:08:48] on us God is letting the Rapture wait on
[1:08:53] you is how you
[1:08:56] you
[1:08:57] surrender then we can get the last one
[1:09:00] in as soon as the last one com in we
[1:09:04] meet the Lord in the air and we don't
[1:09:07] know how we going to meet him unless we
[1:09:12] surrender surrender is very very
[1:09:14] important in the
[1:09:17] Lord when we don't surrender we cannot
[1:09:20] do the job human sense can't do it we
[1:09:24] shouldn't try to figure
[1:09:28] things too much of figuring
[1:09:32] things will make a
[1:09:34] disaster because we should let the Lord
[1:09:38] have his way when the Lord have his way
[1:09:41] in us the job become what easy and the
[1:09:46] Lord will
[1:09:47] accomplish because close darkness is so
[1:09:51] thick the darkness is so thick
[1:09:56] that if the Lord light doesn't risen
[1:10:00] upon thee you can never seee it I'm
[1:10:04] closing in 5 minutes so don't
[1:10:07] worry when the light doesn't shine upon
[1:10:12] the seed that is in thee you can none of
[1:10:15] us and I can even said it from Pastor to
[1:10:19] the PE if the pastor can do it how can
[1:10:22] you sitting in the Pew do it cuz the
[1:10:24] angel of the Lord if there is anything
[1:10:27] goes to the pastor first I don't care
[1:10:30] how spiritual you think you are how much
[1:10:33] Authority you have how much power you
[1:10:37] have the angel of the Lord if there is
[1:10:40] anything it goes to the pastor
[1:10:44] first and the pastor will see it
[1:10:48] first even if he doesn't see it sometime
[1:10:51] God may like to show you little things
[1:10:54] there little things but all have to go
[1:10:57] through the pastor to check it to
[1:11:01] examine it by a lot of people they think
[1:11:05] they are so spiritual they don't need a
[1:11:09] true
[1:11:10] Pastor right but for me Kofi I always
[1:11:15] need a
[1:11:17] leadership okay I always even while I'm
[1:11:20] preaching I need a
[1:11:22] leadership because without that a
[1:11:27] leadership it won't be good for me but
[1:11:32] before I will prove the
[1:11:35] leader and see that the holy spirit is
[1:11:38] in him then I Surrender otherwise I
[1:11:43] don't because God is my number one
[1:11:48] leader and if he chose a pastor for me
[1:11:52] I'm willing to
[1:11:54] follow
[1:11:56] I'm willing to
[1:11:57] obey I'm willing for
[1:12:01] instruction then I know that is leading
[1:12:06] me to
[1:12:07] what to meet the Lord in the air and
[1:12:10] that also applies to you and each and
[1:12:13] every one of you if you
[1:12:18] obey what the pastor is
[1:12:22] preaching then the Lord can do something
[1:12:25] for you
[1:12:26] you because otherwise God cannot do
[1:12:31] anything if you don't want to come to
[1:12:34] church you don't want to surrender how
[1:12:37] can God bless you how can God use you
[1:12:39] for work his
[1:12:41] work don't you
[1:12:43] know the Lord Pastor Simon if he here
[1:12:48] I'm saying this and I know that maybe he
[1:12:50] watches it or not I don't know but let
[1:12:53] me say when he was here every time I'm
[1:12:55] going Africa I tell him brother I'm
[1:12:58] going here there there there there he
[1:13:01] tell me
[1:13:02] go brother go maybe the Lord want to use
[1:13:05] you there go and God bless you and every
[1:13:10] time I go God uses me I see signs
[1:13:14] wonders I can only I have off my
[1:13:18] data like I can show you where I'm
[1:13:22] baptizing people the power of God come
[1:13:25] down
[1:13:26] proving to the people that it's not
[1:13:28] brother Kofi is the Lord the god of
[1:13:32] brother Bram is
[1:13:34] there I know I believe that and I
[1:13:40] respect that so I encourage you as our
[1:13:45] brother has fully taken his
[1:13:48] position let us stand behind
[1:13:52] him
[1:13:53] okay are you with me or
[1:13:58] not don't be quiet with me like you are

[1:14:12] from pet then you can talk with me and I
[1:14:16] don't know what even maybe sometime I

[1:15:01] God for each and every one of
[1:15:03] you may God bless each and every one of

[1:15:09] contrary to God word may you forgive me
[1:15:12] come to me I'll make it right if I'm
[1:15:16] wrong but all in my heart I want if it
