[38:25] fit into what is going on around us
[38:27] prophecy is being fulfilled every single
[38:32] hour by the hour Saints you know that in
[38:36] the when Jesus gave up the ghost just
[38:38] before he went to Calvary and right at
[38:40] that moment when he when he gave up that
[38:42] he said it is finished at that moment so
[38:44] many scriptures were fulfilled in uh in
[38:48] the midst of the
[38:49] people one after the other taking place

[40:24] which is um from Isaiah
[40:28] Chapter 14 verse
[40:31] 24 the Lord of hosts has sworn saying

[41:20] we can recognize that you're a alive in
[41:24] our day in our home in our our lives in
[41:28] our families at our workplace Lord
[41:31] that's what makes perfect Faith a
[41:34] reality Lord for this hour that we're
[41:37] living in because we it's going to take
[41:39] a special kind of rapturing Faith to
[41:42] translate us and to move us and that can
[41:45] only happen if you come and indwell and
[41:48] possess and and and change us line upon

[41:55] this morning Lord we give you you praise
[41:57] Glory and Honor in Jesus name amen
[42:01] praise God you may be
[42:02] seated glory to God the Lord says that
[42:06] that that he hath
[42:08] sworn he listen he he swore by
[42:12] himself there's no higher there's no
[42:15] higher guarantee amen that whatever the
[42:18] Lord said he's going to do and whatever
[42:21] the Lord said he has purposed within him
[42:25] shall come to pass and shall stand it's
[42:27] going to come to pass Saints and this is
[42:30] the hour where we've got to realize that
[42:33] prophecy will be fulfilled and is being
[42:36] fulfilled in our very day in our very
[42:40] lives in our very countries amen and the
[42:44] nations with God has sworn he's going to
[42:47] do something he's had a plan what Grace
[42:50] that he's given us to be able to to you
[42:54] know that he had sent that he sent us a
[42:56] prophet
[42:57] that didn't just take us back to the
[42:59] Book of Genesis he took us right back
[43:02] into the mind of God he allowed us to
[43:05] recognize that listen before there was
[43:08] anything in the beginning was the word
[43:10] and the Word was with God and he said
[43:12] the Word was God so before there was
[43:16] even a word there was God Amen the the
[43:20] self-existent one with a plan with a
[43:22] with a a a Redemptive plan that that he
[43:25] he was expressing and you know and it
[43:28] all expressed down onto the Earth after
[43:31] there there you know there was a fall
[43:33] because listen even before the Earth you
[43:35] know the before the the the Earth was
[43:39] was V was uh void and without form there
[43:43] was Angels God created angels God had
[43:45] Heavenly Dimensions where there was
[43:47] Angels that's why this whole Plan of
[43:50] Redemption it didn't just start in the
[43:52] Garden of Eden it started back before
[43:56] the foundations the world when Lucifer
[43:59] the lightbearer Satan who was one of
[44:01] God's Mighty angels that was his song
[44:04] leader that was his you know one of his
[44:07] you know his one of his main uh you know
[44:10] right-hand man but he he was he was
[44:12] created he was a created being and he
[44:15] had a purpose and within him was found
[44:18] iniquity he wanted to be like God he
[44:22] wanted to be worshiped like God and so
[44:24] he he just he just displayed it up there
[44:27] when he when he when he took a third
[44:29] part of the angels to you know to come
[44:31] and and take his side so that he could
[44:34] be worshiped and God just threw the
[44:36] whole thing right down onto the Earth
[44:38] and would allow it to play out and
[44:41] that's why that same spirit that came to
[44:44] Eve in the Garden of Eden that serpent
[44:47] who was the devil the Bible says
[44:50] it the devil the
[44:53] serpent wanted to be worshiped he wanted
[44:56] to to be like God so he wanted to create
[44:58] his own children and that's why he went
[45:00] and inseminated Eve to bring forth his
[45:03] own seed amen and that's why this world
[45:05] is in the condition that it's in but yet
[45:08] God has a plan amen and God's plan is
[45:11] all based on Prophecy and the prophecy
[45:14] of this hour is something that we need
[45:16] to recognize that's going on around us
[45:18] so today we're going to be looking at
[45:20] certain things but first of all let's
[45:22] just look at our next scripture let's
[45:24] lay in the foundation maybe a little bit
[45:26] of a review of what we covered last week
[45:29] and Luke 21 says and there shall be
[45:31] signs in the Sun and in the moon and in
[45:34] the stars and upon the Earth distress of
[45:36] Nations if that is in the time that
[45:38] we're living in with perplexity the Sea
[45:41] and the waves roaring men's Hearts
[45:43] failing them for fear and for losing
[45:46] after those things and for looking after
[45:49] those things which are coming on the
[45:51] earth their their their hearts are
[45:53] failing for fear because of what they're
[45:55] seeing come upon the Earth
[45:57] they're seeing the Nations falling apart
[45:59] they're seeing rumors of wars and now
[46:02] it's at Heights where it's where we've
[46:04] never seen before since the days of of
[46:07] World War II there's threats and there's
[46:11] you know things that are happening that
[46:13] you can see very clearly this world is
[46:16] going into chaos there's nothing that
[46:19] can stop it amen praise God one
[46:21] ceasefire after the other I believe a
[46:23] couple weeks ago I said you know we were
[46:25] under a ceasefire I said but I don't
[46:26] think it's going to last long and it
[46:28] didn't and right away you know like
[46:30] because there's no way you can stop
[46:33] prophecy you're not going to change
[46:36] God's plan for this Earth and what is
[46:38] going to take place amongst the Nations
[46:41] and how everything is going to come
[46:42] together but guess what before it all
[46:45] goes into the Great Tribulation we go
[46:48] into a great Rapture Hallelujah God
[46:52] takes us and just interdimensionally
[46:55] changes us from this Di mention to the
[46:58] next amen that's all he's going to do oh
[47:01] yes Saints listen why you don't think
[47:03] it's possible they're already doing
[47:05] things they're doing things listen all
[47:08] the things that you see that's going on
[47:10] with internet and with cloud storage and
[47:12] being able to place images into
[47:16] clouds artificial clouds all around us
[47:20] all of those things those are just pre
[47:24] uh you know previews of the kinds of
[47:26] things that that that God can do where
[47:29] do you think they got all of that from
[47:30] you think they invented it you think
[47:32] they're the the The Originators of all
[47:35] this intelligence no sir it was it was
[47:40] prophesied according to God's word
[47:42] thousands of years ago when Daniel says
[47:46] that knowledge shall increase in the end
[47:50] time it took
[47:52] over uh uh almost 5900 years years to
[47:57] get us to go as fast as we could go on
[48:00] an
[48:01] animal and in the last 100 years we're
[48:04] going to the Moon we're going mock four
[48:06] five six they're doing 17 18,000 miles
[48:10] an hour with rockets going to the Moon
[48:13] to pick up people in space stations and
[48:15] everything else how do you think that
[48:17] all came about because of God's prophecy
[48:19] that said knowledge would increase but
[48:22] no matter how much the knowledge of man
[48:25] can get to no matter how much they think
[48:28] they can figure things out they'll never
[48:30] figure out
[48:32] God God you cannot figure out the Lord
[48:37] he reveals to you what you need to know
[48:40] he reveals to you who you are he tells
[48:43] you the part that you're playing in this
[48:46] in the in the prophecy of this hour it's
[48:49] not you that's going to figure him out
[48:51] they're trying to figure him out they'll
[48:52] never do it praise God their their
[48:55] hearts are failing for fear because of
[48:56] the things that are happening on the
[48:58] earth for the powers of Heaven shall be
[49:01] shaken glory to God Amen I'll tell you
[49:04] things are shaking all around us Saints
[49:07] and you know I want to thank God for uh
[49:10] signs that he's given us in the heavens
[49:13] last week we looked at next slide here
[49:15] we looked at the fact that you know that
[49:17] we had had a blun moon back on March the
[49:19] 14th we tied it into the season of purum
[49:22] these are times when the Jewish people
[49:25] uh celebrate you know certain events and
[49:27] we know that purum uh goes back to
[49:30] Esther and that's what really got me
[49:31] stirred to look into Esther and all of a
[49:33] sudden I'm obsessed and I'm saying Lord
[49:36] I need to fully understand why this book
[49:39] of Esther is is uh is stirring in my
[49:43] heart amen and I'm asking you to pray
[49:47] and and seek the Lord and say Lord show
[49:50] us amen and God has a provided way of
[49:53] doing it through the foolishness of
[49:56] preaching
[49:57] I don't listen I got nothing new I got
[50:00] I'm going to be bringing things that are
[50:02] things that I've researched that I
[50:03] looked up in the scriptures on the
[50:05] internet and so forth things that many
[50:07] of you maybe have seen already but
[50:10] there's an element to the preaching of
[50:12] the word of God in this day and in this
[50:15] hour that invites the holy spirit amen
[50:18] it's called The Mighty Angel himself
[50:20] where God comes down possesses the
[50:23] ministers that stand at these at these
[50:25] pulpits and stand behind and believe
[50:28] God's word believe that it's it's all
[50:30] about him I got nothing to bring you
[50:33] Saints but I believe in the Supernatural
[50:36] God that can possess and speak and and
[50:38] be an oracle of God because he's going
[50:40] to have Oracles in this hour amen that
[50:43] are going to speak his word amen and so
[50:46] I thank God for for for the ability to
[50:49] to recognize these signs and these
[50:52] things that are happening around us
[50:54] praise God and you know um this this
[50:56] Blood Moon it surrounded purum it's
[50:59] surrounding the story of Esther that's
[51:01] where it actually originated praise God
[51:03] and so let's just see what the holy
[51:05] spirit's going to give us amen there's
[51:08] elements in there that that you know
[51:10] that you see this is the beauty of the
[51:12] opening of the word this is what we've
[51:16] experienced because of Malachi 4:5 and
[51:19] because of Revelations 10 1-7 and
[51:22] because we've recognized the church age
[51:24] Messengers and the angels to the
[51:27] churches these are the benefits that we
[51:29] receive as a result of the opening of
[51:32] those seals amen praise God let's move
[51:35] on Saints this is glorious and Luke
[51:38] 21:27 to 28 as we read on he says and
[51:41] then shall they see the son of man
[51:45] coming in a
[51:47] cloud glory to God with power and great
[51:51] glory and when these things begin to
[51:54] come to pass then look up
[51:57] and lift up your heads for your
[51:59] Redemption draweth nigh you know I
[52:02] believe that there's a season in this
[52:05] scripture that lasts many
[52:08] years he says it says here and when
[52:11] these things
[52:12] begin to come to pass I believe
[52:16] something began back in
[52:19] 1963 Oh Glory to God I believe something
[52:23] began right back then and there was a
[52:25] there was a people that were ordained at
[52:28] that particular time and season for a
[52:32] purpose to recognize who they were and
[52:35] what it was that they were to witness
[52:38] that they would actually be a witness of
[52:40] a cloud that would come down in
[52:43] 1963 next slide in Revelations 101 it
[52:47] says here and I saw another Mighty Angel
[52:50] come down from heaven clothed with a
[52:53] cloud and a rainbow was upon his head Oh
[52:58] Glory to God and his face was as it were
[53:01] the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire
[53:04] you know that Revelation 10 verse1 is
[53:08] talking about the Lord
[53:10] himself the Lord himself and this
[53:13] picture that you see here is an article
[53:15] and I know you've seen it we've all seen
[53:17] it but there's somebody that needs to
[53:19] see it amen glory to God Amen and this
[53:22] was an article back in uh uh that that
[53:25] was um in Life Magazine glory to God it
[53:29] was um uh May the
[53:34] 17th or sorry yeah May the May the 17th
[53:39] 1963 and it was an it was a picture that
[53:41] was taken and it it was taken from a few
[53:44] different angles that's why you've got
[53:46] these other pictures down the side and
[53:49] it was it was shown that this Cloud
[53:51] could not have existed at the at the 28
[53:56] or 27 or 28 miles up in the air that it
[53:59] was actually
[54:00] formed and that it was a scientific
[54:05] phenomena Science magazine picked up on
[54:07] it said that it could not have exist you
[54:09] can find these magazines and these
[54:12] proofs right on the internet just search
[54:14] it yourself okay these are not things
[54:18] that I just put together these are
[54:20] things that have happened in our day
[54:21] amen and and this Cloud over here it was
[54:25] a super natural Cloud on page 112 and on
[54:29] page 113 somebody else some other
[54:32] photographer had taken a picture of a
[54:35] rainbow and do you think it was a
[54:38] coincidence that that rainbow was right
[54:41] on page 13 on the back it was a totally
[54:45] different time when it happened
[54:47] incidents that nobody knew each other
[54:49] nobody knew nothing the Publishers knew
[54:51] nothing but they put that cloud on 113
[54:55] and when you take that page and you put
[54:57] it into the light that's what you're
[54:59] going to see a cloud was over his head
[55:03] because that is when you turn that cloud
[55:06] to the right you can go to the next
[55:07] slide you will see that it is the head
[55:11] of Jesus Christ it was the mighty Angel
[55:15] himself in
[55:16] 1963 he would appear in the clouds and I
[55:21] know they're looking for it to happen
[55:22] again I know they're looking and they're
[55:25] placing it into into a future event but
[55:27] the scripture said when it shall begin
[55:29] to happen I believe there's a people
[55:31] that have recognized and I believe
[55:34] there's a people in this day in this
[55:35] hour that still need to recognize
[55:38] because everyone that Jesus said all
[55:41] that the father hath given me will come
[55:44] not one of them is going to be left
[55:46] behind so every son and daughter of God
[55:49] they're going to have to recognize the
[55:51] word they're going to have to recognize
[55:54] the cloud they're going to have to know
[55:56] that Jesus Christ has already come in
[55:58] his second coming he appeared in in uh
[56:02] in
[56:03] 1963 seven angels come down and one of
[56:06] those angels was was was Christ himself
[56:09] amen praise God that would speak and
[56:11] open the revelation of those Seven
[56:15] Seals and this is what we are feasting
[56:18] on this is why we are a different church
[56:22] this is why we are the called out in
[56:25] this day and in this hour amen we're not
[56:29] making this Cloud some some uh uh Pagan
[56:33] God we're not worshiping the cloud but
[56:37] we know what the cloud represents it
[56:39] represents the word amen and in the
[56:41] beginning was the word and the Word was
[56:44] with God and the word what was God Amen
[56:47] and so when you can recognize the word
[56:50] being fulfilled manifest in your
[56:54] day you've seen being Jesus Christ in
[56:58] the present stage of his ministry and so
[57:01] on February the 28th this uh 1963 the
[57:05] vision and prophecy was
[57:07] fulfilled when a constellation of seven
[57:10] angels formed a huge Cloud forming in
[57:12] sunset Mountain sunset Mountain the Sun
[57:17] comes to set and the head comes to meet
[57:20] with the body of Jesus Christ the groom
[57:23] coming to his bride amen the body glory
[57:27] to God this is all right here right in
[57:29] front of your eyes sa sunset Mountain
[57:32] with a commission for William brandham
[57:35] to preach the opening of The Seven Seals
[57:37] of Revelations chapter 6 7 and
[57:41] 8
[57:44] fulfilled fulfilled Saints it's taken
[57:48] place already and we're feasting on that
[57:51] seventh seal now we're not going to get
[57:54] into all the depths of it all but this
[57:55] is what this is what has awakened us
[57:59] this is what has brought us into the
[58:01] present State and stage of the ministry
[58:04] of the church in this day and in this
[58:06] hour she's not feasting on man's
[58:09] doctrines or man's teachings she has
[58:12] recognized that the
[58:14] headship the headship has come down and
[58:17] William Branham who was Elijah who was
[58:21] the Elijah that would restore all things
[58:23] the one Jesus said Elijah shall surely
[58:26] come and restore all things those things
[58:30] have been restored the word has been
[58:32] restored back to the original faith
[58:35] those Mysteries were all unveiled but
[58:38] there's a seventh seal mystery that is
[58:40] still unveiling in this hour it's what
[58:43] the Sons and Daughters of God are
[58:45] feasting on right now she's not looking
[58:48] back at church ages she's looking at the
[58:50] present stage of the ministry of Jesus
[58:53] Christ in the opening of the word on
[58:56] veiling himself not in in book form but
[58:59] in in written Epistles read of all men
[59:03] glory to God hallelujah praise God
[59:05] forever more what an hour thank you Lord
[59:08] Jesus and so this this opening of the
[59:12] word from uh
[59:14] 1963 laid in such a foundation for what
[59:18] we today are feasting on glory to God so
[59:22] there's a little recap of last week and
[59:25] a little more I believe there's going to
[59:28] be another Cloud that's going to be
[59:32] witnessed I was fellowshipping with our
[59:34] former pastor this week and we got into
[59:37] some discussion and we were just caught
[59:38] up into Heavenly places and we were
[59:39] talking about these things and he's and
[59:42] and and he says yes brother there's
[59:43] going to be another Cloud that's going
[59:46] to be witnessed because we are encamped
[59:48] about by a cloud of
[59:50] witnesses and when this day when it when
[59:52] it when it strikes in the moment in the
[59:54] twinkling of an eye I believe there's
[59:56] going to be another Cloud that's going
[59:58] to be witnessed that's going to streak
[1:00:00] right off of this and interdimensionally
[1:00:02] change from Mortal to immortality amen
[1:00:06] and who knows what they're going to
[1:00:07] witness then they're going to they're
[1:00:09] going to witness something they if they
[1:00:11] miss the first Cloud they might see this
[1:00:12] one Hallelujah glory to God Amen don't
[1:00:16] don't put any interpretation on the word
[1:00:18] of God Saints let the Holy Spirit
[1:00:21] interpret the word to you let him reveal
[1:00:23] to you what it is that he's going to do
[1:00:25] in this hour amen praise God it's when
[1:00:28] we try to put our own interpretation on
[1:00:31] the word it takes us further away from
[1:00:33] God hallelujah thank you Lord this was
[1:00:37] the Fulfillment of Luke
[1:00:39] 21:27 glory to God and if you've receive
[1:00:42] the Holy Ghost in This Day and in this
[1:00:44] hour you've been given the eyes to see
[1:00:48] and to recognize and to know that this
[1:00:50] is the truth amen glory to God let's go
[1:00:52] to the next slide let's move on Amen
[1:00:57] Glory Hallelujah prophecy being
[1:00:59] fulfilled right around us we're encamped
[1:01:02] about Saints Esther chapter 2: 15 to1
[1:01:06] 17 now when the turn of Esther the
[1:01:09] daughter of a Abel the uncle of
[1:01:14] Mori who had taken her for his daughter
[1:01:17] was come to go in unto the king she
[1:01:21] required nothing but what hegi the
[1:01:23] king's Chamberlain the keep ER of the
[1:01:26] women
[1:01:27] appointed and Esther obtained favor in
[1:01:31] the sight of all them that looked upon
[1:01:33] her so King so Esther was taken unto
[1:01:38] King azus into his house Royal in the
[1:01:43] 10th month which is in the month to Beth
[1:01:46] in the seventh year of his Reign Oh
[1:01:49] Glory to God
[1:01:51] hallelujah I know you know a lot of us
[1:01:54] has probably seen that before but you
[1:01:56] know I just love seeing those
[1:01:58] things she she was brought before the
[1:02:01] king just like she was before the king
[1:02:06] in Revelations
[1:02:08] 10:7 when the mystery of God the mystery
[1:02:12] the king himself was going to unveil
[1:02:14] himself to a bride amen you think that's
[1:02:17] a
[1:02:18] coincidence on the 10th day the seventh
[1:02:21] come on Saints Hallelujah he's his his
[1:02:24] word is prophetic
[1:02:27] this is the prophecy of God's word amen
[1:02:29] we need to recognize where we stand here
[1:02:32] and so and so Esther was taken under the
[1:02:35] king at that time in the seventh year of
[1:02:37] his Reign seventh year of his Reign
[1:02:40] seven Church ages leod deia the seven
[1:02:43] seal come on Saints there's all kinds of
[1:02:46] of of of things here that the Holy
[1:02:49] Spirit was unveiling and this is 2500
[1:02:52] years ago
[1:02:56] and the King loved Esther above all the
[1:03:00] churches glory to God and she obtained
[1:03:03] grace and favor in his sight more than
[1:03:07] all the
[1:03:08] virgins so that he set the Royal Crown
[1:03:12] upon her head and made her Queen instead
[1:03:15] of vashi Oh Glory to God aren't you
[1:03:19] grateful that that that that you have
[1:03:22] been
[1:03:23] identified as Queen Esther in this day
[1:03:26] and in this hour that you have found
[1:03:29] favor before God listen the king hadn't
[1:03:33] even seen her yet but I believe that he
[1:03:36] knew her
[1:03:38] already I believe that that there was
[1:03:40] something in his heart do you know that
[1:03:42] this whole book of Esther there's no
[1:03:45] talk of the
[1:03:46] Lord go back and read it it's all silent
[1:03:51] it's all God hidden in the midst of his
[1:03:55] people God doing his thing God doing it
[1:03:58] under the third pull under the seventh
[1:04:01] seal because it was the seventh year of
[1:04:04] his Reign everything was going to be
[1:04:06] done in such a way that it would only be
[1:04:09] revealed to those that were in their
[1:04:11] positions those that would have
[1:04:13] recognized that they had a calling that
[1:04:15] there was something Supernatural taking
[1:04:18] place in their lives they didn't they
[1:04:20] didn't join a church you didn't join
[1:04:22] this church God called you God placed
[1:04:25] you God positioned you God gave you a
[1:04:28] revelation of who you are in this hour
[1:04:30] amen it's it's going to take that
[1:04:32] Supernatural aspect of the word of God
[1:04:35] to place you and to allow you to
[1:04:37] recognize who you are amen glory to God
[1:04:40] and right away he put the crown on her
[1:04:43] head this is the one that I'm going to
[1:04:45] Crown I'm going to give her absolute
[1:04:48] Authority I'll tell you we we let's just
[1:04:51] go on let's read on because there's so
[1:04:53] many nuggets in here that the Lord is
[1:04:55] going to bless BL us with amen praise
[1:04:57] God listen to brother brandham here uh
[1:04:59] go to the next slide he says here in the
[1:05:01] marriage of the
[1:05:03] Lamb Esther was to become a bride so she
[1:05:07] didn't want none of the adorning of the
[1:05:09] world if you go back and read
[1:05:12] it all the all the women all the virgins
[1:05:16] that had been chosen in shusa and on all
[1:05:20] the 127 provinces around because vashi
[1:05:24] she had she had rebelled and not want to
[1:05:28] come under submission to her King a kind
[1:05:30] of a type of what the world and the
[1:05:32] Christian world today they they claim
[1:05:35] him to be the king they want to all the
[1:05:37] glory that comes with the King they want
[1:05:40] to have big Ministries because they
[1:05:42] serve the king but then when the king
[1:05:44] says you need to be baptized in the name
[1:05:47] of the Lord Jesus Christ because I am
[1:05:50] one Lord one God I am not a trinity you
[1:05:54] need to you need to read and recognize
[1:05:57] what the scripture says they turn around
[1:05:59] and say
[1:06:00] nonsense just like vashi when the king
[1:06:03] says you need to come into my presence I
[1:06:06] want to display you because I find you
[1:06:08] to be the most beautiful God W God so
[1:06:12] loved the world that he gave himself for
[1:06:15] this church he want he loved everybody
[1:06:18] he wanted but they rejected him imagine
[1:06:23] the the the the Mighty God God himself
[1:06:26] come down in the first coming amongst
[1:06:29] his people the most religious people of
[1:06:31] the day but what did they do they
[1:06:34] rejected him to the point where they
[1:06:36] said crucify the word they didn't want
[1:06:39] to take the word they didn't want to
[1:06:41] come under submission to the word you
[1:06:42] show me one place where anybody was ever
[1:06:45] baptized I'm just using that as an
[1:06:46] example you show me anywhere where it
[1:06:48] says Trinity in the Bible you won't find
[1:06:51] it you want to serve God but you don't
[1:06:54] know him you don't recognize but yet
[1:06:58] you've got to have a revelation yourself
[1:07:00] amen and so here now she didn't want to
[1:07:03] Adorn herself because all those virgins
[1:07:07] when it was their time to be called to
[1:07:09] be to come before the king because he
[1:07:12] was looking for his bride and so he was
[1:07:14] going through one every night a
[1:07:17] different one would come they would come
[1:07:19] to him at night they would leave in the
[1:07:21] morning and only if he would call them
[1:07:23] back by name were they allowed to come
[1:07:27] back into his chamber amen because he
[1:07:30] knows his own glory to God and when it
[1:07:34] was now all these virgins what they
[1:07:36] would do is they would dress themselves
[1:07:39] in absolutely the most you know Adorn
[1:07:42] jewels and paint themselves up to make
[1:07:44] themselves look so sexy and and put on
[1:07:47] those tight skirts and and and
[1:07:49] everything else like the world today
[1:07:51] they want to dress they want to go
[1:07:53] before the Lord they want to come into
[1:07:54] the churches and they want to be dressed
[1:07:56] in such a way that's provoke it provokes
[1:07:59] men to look onto them to lust after them
[1:08:02] that's the that's the nature that was on
[1:08:04] the women that's on the women and that's
[1:08:07] what and that was back there in the days
[1:08:09] of
[1:08:09] Persia they were the listen Persia at
[1:08:12] the time Babylon was the
[1:08:14] biggest it was the
[1:08:17] power country nation of the world at
[1:08:20] that time right around five 470
[1:08:26] 5 BC 2500 years
[1:08:29] ago they had fashion they had things
[1:08:32] that you could they had colors because
[1:08:34] they had adopted all the things that had
[1:08:36] come down from Mystery Babylon from
[1:08:39] Babylon because it was Persia that took
[1:08:41] over the Babylonians that that that beat
[1:08:44] the Babylonians and became the the the
[1:08:46] superpower of the world and they had
[1:08:48] Jewels they had colors they had dresses
[1:08:51] that they could that they could dress
[1:08:52] they had makeup and all kinds of things
[1:08:55] that they would use on their bodies and
[1:08:57] everything else to make so these virgins
[1:08:59] would would dress themselves and they
[1:09:01] would just deck themselves to make
[1:09:03] themselves look like so amazing so that
[1:09:06] they could hide so that they could hope
[1:09:08] that the king would choose them to be
[1:09:09] the queen but when eser went in uh her
[1:09:13] Chamberlain said no no just go in plain
[1:09:16] the way you are Oh Glory to God she
[1:09:19] didn't want any of that
[1:09:21] listen just like she wanted to go into
[1:09:23] the king just like she was she had
[1:09:27] listen she adorned themselves like the
[1:09:29] Pentecostal women ought to with a Meek
[1:09:32] humble Spirit now you got to remember
[1:09:35] this is back in 1962 and the Pentecostal
[1:09:38] Church Age and and the and the
[1:09:39] Pentecostals had the had the the the the
[1:09:42] the the furthest most present truth
[1:09:45] about the word of God but yet they were
[1:09:47] slipping dramatically even at that time
[1:09:50] but the original Pentecost they were
[1:09:52] Holiness unto the Lord they were they
[1:09:55] they would dress properly they would
[1:09:57] come before the Lord adorned properly
[1:09:59] women would act properly and and and so
[1:10:02] forth amen but here he says now he says
[1:10:05] with a Meek and humble spirit and when
[1:10:08] all these fancy first ladies come by
[1:10:11] with all their new fandangle things the
[1:10:14] king looked at them and put them in the
[1:10:17] chamber with the
[1:10:19] concubines but when this Esther come
[1:10:22] into His sight and he got a glimpse of
[1:10:25] that
[1:10:26] sweet humble Meek Spirit he said that's
[1:10:33] her that's her go get the crown and put
[1:10:38] it on her head that's it let them
[1:10:41] Adorn let
[1:10:43] them let them Adorn themselves with that
[1:10:46] kind of a spirit not only the woman but
[1:10:49] the men too Adorn themselves with that
[1:10:53] kind of a humble Spirit that's what he's
[1:10:55] talking about the the the the true
[1:10:58] church remember a woman is always typed
[1:11:00] as a church and so when he's talking
[1:11:02] about a church here he's talking about
[1:11:03] those that are in the church and it's
[1:11:06] the people that make up the church it's
[1:11:09] not this beautiful building here that
[1:11:11] God has given us with this beautiful
[1:11:13] land on a on a nice Street and it looks
[1:11:16] lovely you come inside we're blessed
[1:11:18] we're thankful we're very grateful but
[1:11:20] it's not that that makes up the church
[1:11:22] it's not the beauty of the church it's
[1:11:25] the character of the people it's the
[1:11:27] humility of the people it's that's what
[1:11:30] makes up the real church and gives it
[1:11:33] the the the the beauty that of what God
[1:11:36] is really looking for amen that's it let
[1:11:38] them Adorn themselves with that kind of
[1:11:40] a spirit not only the women but the men
[1:11:42] too Adorn themselves with that kind of a
[1:11:45] spirit then you're becoming ready for
[1:11:48] the bride sweet
[1:11:52] reverent Esther made her heart heart
[1:11:57] clean there was something already in
[1:12:01] her glory to God
[1:12:04] Amen go to the next
[1:12:07] slide you know this is quick just just
[1:12:10] to show you the time of the timeline of
[1:12:14] the events and you see the highlighted
[1:12:16] area there that was when Persia was in
[1:12:20] dominance you know that Daniel in
[1:12:23] Babylon just before Persia God gave
[1:12:26] Daniel the vision of the great statue
[1:12:29] and and Nebuchadnezzar made it a statue
[1:12:32] of of Daniel himself but Daniel
[1:12:35] interpreted the statue and gave Clarity
[1:12:37] on the Statue how the the head was of
[1:12:39] gold and that was Babylon but yet he
[1:12:42] told the king that there's going to be
[1:12:43] one that's going to come after you the
[1:12:44] mes and Persians it's going to be a
[1:12:47] nation of silver and you'll see that it
[1:12:50] it just got softer the medals got softer
[1:12:52] gold is soft silver is a little f
[1:12:55] then it went into the uh uh
[1:12:59] uh
[1:13:01] Greek dispensation which was brass a
[1:13:04] little firmer and all of them had their
[1:13:07] their their their abilities and and
[1:13:09] their their uh uh gifts and the reason
[1:13:13] why they became the superpowers of the
[1:13:16] of their time how Babylon became the
[1:13:19] superpower it was God that allowed them
[1:13:21] to do those things but all of their
[1:13:23] superpowers were their ability to
[1:13:25] control the People by influencing the PE
[1:13:29] the the by influencing the people with
[1:13:31] their Fashions and with just like today
[1:13:34] just like you know the greatest nation
[1:13:36] on Earth today they call is the US OFA
[1:13:40] you know because of all of its
[1:13:41] popularity all of its fashion all of its
[1:13:43] Finance all of its you know economic
[1:13:46] power and and and everything else amen
[1:13:49] and so those are the things that they
[1:13:51] would use to control the people and
[1:13:53] that's why they became the superpowers
[1:13:55] that they did and of course their armies
[1:13:57] became more sophisticated they like the
[1:13:59] Greeks they were very smart that's why
[1:14:02] to this day you know they they're
[1:14:04] they're they're behind all of the all of
[1:14:05] the mathematics and all of those things
[1:14:08] because they had that natural ability to
[1:14:11] to you know the the gifts of of
[1:14:13] calculation and so forth and the
[1:14:15] Persians before them they had those you
[1:14:17] know they had super uh you know armies
[1:14:20] and they had spies that they could
[1:14:22] infiltrate and go in and take out you
[1:14:24] know it was all kind kind of things
[1:14:25] these are the if you go back and
[1:14:27] actually study and look into the history
[1:14:29] of each of these dispensations of world
[1:14:33] powers in the Old Testament you will see
[1:14:35] what was governing them what was behind
[1:14:37] them what what their it was all their
[1:14:40] knowledge everything was based on their
[1:14:42] ability their own strengths their own
[1:14:43] knowledge that's why they were Pagan
[1:14:45] they would not receive God that's why
[1:14:48] they were always against the children of
[1:14:51] Israel because they were simple they
[1:14:54] served served a
[1:14:56] god they served gods they made Gods out
[1:14:59] of everything they were so Babylonian
[1:15:03] and so Pagan and so uh filthy in their
[1:15:07] ways and everything else and that's why
[1:15:09] God had to separate his people from it
[1:15:12] amen praise God even God putting his
[1:15:15] people into Egypt for 400 years was
[1:15:18] because the amorites were were so were
[1:15:21] so wicked and vicious and and so
[1:15:25] polluted and so filthy in all of their
[1:15:28] ways and everything else God had a
[1:15:30] purpose in doing everything God was
[1:15:32] hiding his people in Egypt even though
[1:15:34] they were under bondage but God had a
[1:15:37] plan for them amen just like he's got a
[1:15:40] plan for you and me a lot of us are
[1:15:42] caught into the snares of this world and
[1:15:44] and the snares of this life and and and
[1:15:47] the Egyptian teachings and all the
[1:15:50] beauty and everything else but we're not
[1:15:52] we're we're we've received a word to sep
[1:15:54] separate ourselves from that don't worry
[1:15:57] you don't you won't have trouble
[1:15:59] separating from it because it'll be him
[1:16:01] in you it'll be greater that that's he
[1:16:03] and you that that'll separate you it'll
[1:16:06] be that attribute that God placed in you
[1:16:09] before the foundations of the world
[1:16:11] that'll separate itself and that will
[1:16:13] join itself with the present truth of
[1:16:17] God's word amen praise God and so here
[1:16:20] we see that Persia it was exactly around
[1:16:23] 2500 it was was actually a.
[1:16:28] 47 6 I believe it
[1:16:31] was when
[1:16:33] Esther was made Queen so it's about 2500
[1:16:39] years ago just about 2500 years ago amen
[1:16:42] praise God now if you look at
[1:16:45] Esther we want to look at all the
[1:16:47] different types here of course when we
[1:16:49] look at the King of Persia we can type
[1:16:52] him as Christ he was he was King over
[1:16:57] everything this this man had had
[1:17:00] 127 provinces under his
[1:17:03] control he would he was having a feast
[1:17:06] for six months in celebration of of a of
[1:17:10] one of his
[1:17:11] victories of of of his great power and
[1:17:14] his ability and what he had achieved as
[1:17:17] the king and it was during that time
[1:17:19] right at the end of that Feast that he
[1:17:21] wanted to bring his wife he had gotten
[1:17:24] very very
[1:17:25] intoxicated and back in those days
[1:17:28] there's even talk that you know back in
[1:17:29] in the times that there's there's uh
[1:17:32] there's uh some discussion that you know
[1:17:34] that that when the Kings would would
[1:17:36] want to display their wives they would
[1:17:38] even display them in the nude they
[1:17:40] that's how filthy that's how how how
[1:17:43] they gotten so uh puffed up on
[1:17:45] themselves that a king could whatever he
[1:17:47] said it went if he said stand before me
[1:17:51] in the nude they would just immediately
[1:17:53] stand before him in the nude without
[1:17:54] even even question you couldn't even
[1:17:57] approach the king without being asked to
[1:18:00] approach the king if anybody was even to
[1:18:02] dare to approach the king there would be
[1:18:05] Swordsmen right there immediately to
[1:18:07] take the head off of the individual that
[1:18:10] would try to come before the king
[1:18:12] without
[1:18:12] being called so he was a supreme King on
[1:18:17] earth a type of
[1:18:18] Christ amen praise God Now esther is a
[1:18:23] type of the bride and we know that
[1:18:25] Esther it means star okay the actual
[1:18:29] name Esther and it's a Persian word from
[1:18:33] stara but her actual name was hadasa
[1:18:37] because she was a Jewish girl that had
[1:18:40] been um uh the the the remnants of after
[1:18:45] the Babylonian King went in and took the
[1:18:50] children of Israel took all the children
[1:18:53] of Judah the the king of Judah at the
[1:18:56] time Jan janaki I believe it was and and
[1:18:59] took them all into captivity and many of
[1:19:02] the of the families were killed and and
[1:19:05] whatever was left over the children and
[1:19:07] everything else they were brought into
[1:19:09] Babylon and so when the Persians took
[1:19:13] over Babylon they brought out
[1:19:16] those Jews at that time they weren't
[1:19:19] even really recognized as Jews they were
[1:19:21] just recognized as slaves they were just
[1:19:23] made slaves amongst the people and she
[1:19:27] came from a family of of of Jewish
[1:19:31] parents and her parents died and her her
[1:19:34] cousin
[1:19:36] morai took her as a daughter and raised
[1:19:40] her as a daughter now her name uh hadasa
[1:19:44] means myrtle
[1:19:47] tree and so um according to the Hebrew
[1:19:50] Bible Queen Esther was born with the
[1:19:53] name hadasa
[1:19:56] her name was changed to Esther to hide
[1:19:58] her identity upon becoming the queen of
[1:20:01] Persia the three-letter word of Esther
[1:20:05] is
[1:20:06] s a and it means to hide conceal and I
[1:20:13] believe this whole book of Esther
[1:20:16] conceals some great Mysteries within
[1:20:18] there some great Revelation that
[1:20:21] pertains to us because this is an end
[1:20:24] end time book this is a book regarding
[1:20:28] the end time it it has a significance to
[1:20:32] us and Saints I'm not going to make
[1:20:34] anything more out of it than whatever
[1:20:36] the Holy Spirit reveals to us and that's
[1:20:38] why over these next couple of services
[1:20:41] we're going to be digging in we're going
[1:20:42] to we're going to read we're going to
[1:20:44] pray I trust that you'll go back you'll
[1:20:46] read the book of Esther it'll take you a
[1:20:47] half an hour to read it it's only 10
[1:20:49] chapters amen praise God but here you'll
[1:20:54] you'll you you know as we look at
[1:20:55] everything here um you want to see what
[1:20:59] we draw out of it so Esther was an
[1:21:01] orphan the least likely to be a queen
[1:21:05] just like you and me you wonder how in
[1:21:07] the world would God choose us you know
[1:21:10] to be that church in the last days that
[1:21:13] would represent Christ in this day and
[1:21:15] in this hour that would be the Queen of
[1:21:19] Heaven you don't deserve it I don't
[1:21:21] deserve it but there's an attri in you
[1:21:26] it's something that you had nothing to
[1:21:28] do with the only thing that you can do
[1:21:31] now is when you've been awaken to it is
[1:21:33] surrender to it and allow the Holy
[1:21:36] Spirit now to take control over his
[1:21:39] purpose in your life amen praise God and
[1:21:42] so she was the least likely but yet she
[1:21:45] became the queen Jewish yet takes on the
[1:21:49] position as a gentile bride because the
[1:21:52] Persians they were the Gentiles and he
[1:21:55] was a king and he would take on a
[1:21:57] gentile wife though she was Jewish but
[1:22:00] he didn't know she was Jewish he had no
[1:22:03] idea because in Christ we're not we're
[1:22:05] neither Jew or
[1:22:09] Gentile we're neither Jew or Gentile
[1:22:12] Saints we are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:22:16] Jew and Gentile is just something that
[1:22:20] came out as a part of the Plan of
[1:22:22] Redemption
[1:22:24] all of these things all the the the
[1:22:27] world systems and and all of the things
[1:22:30] that you know like we we we don't want
[1:22:31] to get into all of it right now but
[1:22:33] we're all you know we're under three
[1:22:34] different
[1:22:35] dispensations and now we've entered into
[1:22:38] a fourth dispensation actually and here
[1:22:40] we are in this you know uh when when you
[1:22:42] look back it was the the the
[1:22:44] dispensation uh the dispensation of
[1:22:46] Consciousness where where God was just
[1:22:49] invisible and he would speak personally
[1:22:52] to the individuals and then the
[1:22:53] dispensation of the law you know where
[1:22:56] God had to write the word and and bring
[1:22:58] it under a dispensation of Law and then
[1:23:00] the dispensation of Grace when Christ
[1:23:03] would come on the scene amen praise God
[1:23:05] and all these things but these were all
[1:23:08] for a purpose to bring us to a place
[1:23:11] where we would come to recognize that
[1:23:13] all of those
[1:23:15] systems all of those teachings all of
[1:23:19] those uh uh manmade theologies and gods
[1:23:23] and and days of worshiping and
[1:23:26] everything else was all in
[1:23:29] vain especially now in this day and in
[1:23:32] this hour where our eyes have been
[1:23:34] opened to the ability to go back into
[1:23:36] the mind of God to know that you were
[1:23:39] not the son of your mom and dad your
[1:23:42] daughter of your mom and dad yes you
[1:23:44] were Earthly but before you came here
[1:23:48] you were a daughter of God you were a
[1:23:50] thought attribute of God where were you
[1:23:53] when the sons and daughters ERS of God
[1:23:55] rejoiced around the throne it says in
[1:23:57] the Book of Job amen where were you you
[1:24:00] were an attribute you were there you
[1:24:02] were with Jehovah God you are in the
[1:24:04] self-existent presence of almighty God
[1:24:07] and this is what God is bringing us back
[1:24:09] to a revelation of who we truly are and
[1:24:12] how we identify in this day and in this
[1:24:14] hour amen but I believe there's a
[1:24:16] prophecy hidden within Esther that is
[1:24:20] that is uh you know where God hides
[1:24:22] himself in the midst he never declares
[1:24:24] you don't see them you don't hear morai
[1:24:26] talking about the mighty God we serve
[1:24:28] the god of Israel we serve the god of
[1:24:30] Jacob and Isaac and and Abraham you
[1:24:32] never hear
[1:24:33] it
[1:24:36] why this is why we're here today Lord
[1:24:41] unveil
[1:24:42] yourself show us make it real to us why
[1:24:47] our lives are so concealed and hidden
[1:24:49] sometimes we don't understand The
[1:24:51] Strange Life that we live but yet
[1:24:53] there's something in us that's driving
[1:24:56] us that's taking us before the king amen
[1:24:59] that's giving us confidence to go before
[1:25:01] God In Prayer gives us the ability to
[1:25:03] lay our hands on the sick it gives us a
[1:25:06] confidence to know that God will honor
[1:25:08] his word above everything else God will
[1:25:11] stand with his word something stirs
[1:25:14] within our hearts to to to believe it
[1:25:16] and to
[1:25:17] stand glory glory to God Amen she was a
[1:25:22] type of the Bride she was simple she was
[1:25:25] humble and if we look in Isaiah you know
[1:25:28] um uh just go just go to the next
[1:25:31] slide this next slide here I'm not going
[1:25:34] to get into it all but it's something if
[1:25:36] anybody wants a copy of it just let me
[1:25:38] know I'll email it to you but it shows
[1:25:41] the 10 chapters of the Book of Esther
[1:25:44] and all the events that took place and
[1:25:46] the timing and the players and
[1:25:48] everything else and I you know so I'm
[1:25:50] not going to get into it all because
[1:25:52] it's quite simple the whole book of
[1:25:55] there's there's a story in there that
[1:25:56] you need to go back and read it and then
[1:25:59] you will see and then when you come back
[1:26:01] next week I trust youve read it you come
[1:26:03] back next week you'll be able to see
[1:26:05] what the Holy Spirit unveils to us
[1:26:07] because we're going to move into areas
[1:26:09] that you know I I I broke into some
[1:26:11] things here
[1:26:12] yesterday and I realized oh my goodness
[1:26:15] I can't get into that there's no way
[1:26:19] there's no time I can't put so I I
[1:26:21] realized the Lord was laying in
[1:26:22] something this is just a found for where
[1:26:24] we're going I I was getting so caught up
[1:26:27] yesterday I just I just I was rejoicing
[1:26:30] amen praise God because God is is
[1:26:33] unveiling things to us now it's nothing
[1:26:36] new but it's my time it's your time it's
[1:26:40] our season it's the time where God's
[1:26:43] going to enveil things to you that are
[1:26:44] going to give you the confidence to move
[1:26:46] on with this
[1:26:48] message it's going to separate you from
[1:26:50] the from the doctrines of this messag oh
[1:26:53] my God God there's things happening
[1:26:55] Saints in the book of Isaiah when we
[1:26:58] look at the name uh hadasa her name
[1:27:01] means myrtle tree in Isaiah 5513 it says
[1:27:05] instead of the thorn shall come up the
[1:27:09] fur tree and instead of the Brier shall
[1:27:13] come up the Myrtle tree and it shall be
[1:27:16] to the Lord for a name Oh Glory to God
[1:27:20] Amen I believe your name was written in
[1:27:22] the Lamb's Book of Life s
[1:27:24] I believe God knew your name and and
[1:27:26] then he goes on he says for an
[1:27:28] everlasting sign that shall not be cut
[1:27:31] off listen if you're a son or a daughter
[1:27:34] of God you never ever were not a son or
[1:27:37] a daughter of God you're as Eternal as
[1:27:40] God is eternal your name is not Tim
[1:27:44] beers jural uh Esther your name is
[1:27:50] written in the Lamb's Book of Life amen
[1:27:53] it'll be the one that's written on that
[1:27:55] white rock that when the time comes for
[1:27:57] him to break us into that other
[1:28:00] dimension we shall be known as we are
[1:28:03] known amen praise God at that time we
[1:28:05] shall know who we really are amen praise
[1:28:08] God and so this is an Everlasting
[1:28:11] Covenant hadasa was her name but she's a
[1:28:15] queen that today 2500 years later we go
[1:28:19] back and we celebrate the Revelation
[1:28:23] that was upon her to save her people
[1:28:27] glory to God God gave her a revelation
[1:28:29] of the word of God to save her own
[1:28:32] people I trust that maybe you're going
[1:28:34] to share your you're going to share this
[1:28:36] message you're going to let your F I
[1:28:38] know many of you have already let your
[1:28:39] families know but you can't you can't
[1:28:41] drive anything and you can't convince
[1:28:45] anybody they're going to have to hearken
[1:28:48] unto the voice of the Lord themselves
[1:28:50] they're going to have to hear his voice
[1:28:53] themselves amen before they can actually
[1:28:55] represent themselves with the King
[1:28:59] hallelujah praise God there's a lot of
[1:29:01] nugget Saints praise God Amen thank you
[1:29:04] Jesus and so we just read that scripture
[1:29:08] in Isaiah and and here now the next one
[1:29:11] that we're looking at here so we've
[1:29:12] looked at at Esther and we're going to
[1:29:14] be looking a lot more at
[1:29:16] Esther okay a lot more but let's just
[1:29:20] get the background laid in another 10 15
[1:29:23] minutes minutes and we'll be done morai
[1:29:26] representing the Jews and the Jewish
[1:29:28] nation of Israel morai was the son now
[1:29:32] pay attention here because all of this
[1:29:34] foundation and all of these all of this
[1:29:37] it pertains to today this is an end time
[1:29:40] book with prophecy that points to the
[1:29:43] end time and I believe now that's where
[1:29:46] I believe God that's why I think there's
[1:29:48] things in here that we're going to be
[1:29:49] blessed amen and here morai he was uh
[1:29:53] the son of of jir who was the son of
[1:29:57] shimai who was the son of Kish who was
[1:30:01] the father of King
[1:30:05] Saul and he is identified as a Jew from
[1:30:09] The Tribe of
[1:30:12] Benjamin who was also exiled from
[1:30:16] Jerusalem with jaim who was the king at
[1:30:20] the
[1:30:21] time
[1:30:22] Mori is a boy's name in Hebrew it has
[1:30:27] Hebrew origin meaning follower or
[1:30:30] servant of
[1:30:32] Marduk now you got to understand where
[1:30:35] he brought he was brought up under the
[1:30:39] Babylonian uh teaching an Empire and all
[1:30:43] the Babylonian Gods and everything else
[1:30:45] but pay attention in ancient Hebrew
[1:30:48] cultures Marduk was a Babylonian God who
[1:30:53] ruled over the city of Babylon with
[1:30:56] compassion similar to other Mighty
[1:30:59] deities it is known that Muk stood for
[1:31:03] justice fairness and Order and remember
[1:31:08] it's not the man's name it's not the
[1:31:12] man's uh uh position it's not the
[1:31:17] man's Heritage whether he's an Italian
[1:31:19] or a Portuguese or or an
[1:31:22] Englishman it's the Spirit that's on the
[1:31:25] man it's the spirit that's on the
[1:31:28] individual that's why when you testify
[1:31:31] or you you share this message with
[1:31:33] somebody and you start to fellowship
[1:31:35] with them you'll start to realize the
[1:31:38] kind of spirit that's on them whether
[1:31:41] it's a spirit that that that loves the
[1:31:43] Lord amen or whether it's a spirit of
[1:31:47] Pride that wants to uh you know doesn't
[1:31:50] want to be told doesn't want to be
[1:31:54] taught not willing to change their their
[1:31:57] their their interpretation or their
[1:31:59] Traditions or what they've been brought
[1:32:02] up under maybe they're they're ashamed
[1:32:04] that they would have to go and and and
[1:32:06] you know stand before their family and
[1:32:07] say I am no longer a Roman Catholic I am
[1:32:11] a Christian yeah but everybody even
[1:32:14] Catholics are Christians no I am a Son
[1:32:17] of God I am an attribute of God I am the
[1:32:21] word of God manifest in this day and in
[1:32:24] this hour I've accepted the word I am
[1:32:27] the church the bride a a bride will take
[1:32:30] on her husband's name that's why when
[1:32:32] you say to somebody you need to be
[1:32:34] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:32:37] they say nonsense it's because they
[1:32:39] don't want the husband they don't want
[1:32:42] that husband they don't want to come
[1:32:43] under submission to the Lord Lord means
[1:32:46] Lord over everything if you've made Lord
[1:32:50] the love of your life you will submit to
[1:32:52] him you're not going to be some some
[1:32:55] jellyfish you're going to look and
[1:32:57] search the scriptures you're going to
[1:32:58] see what's written in there you're gonna
[1:33:01] you're gonna identify with the word
[1:33:03] you're going to be able to make sense
[1:33:06] naturally he that understandeth the word
[1:33:09] of God by
[1:33:13] Revelation amen praise God and so the
[1:33:16] spirit that was on morai was a spirit of
[1:33:20] of of uh of justice and fairness and he
[1:33:23] loved loved the Jewish people that's why
[1:33:26] you'll see when when he heard the decree
[1:33:29] that all of the Jewish people were going
[1:33:30] to be killed because of what hmon was
[1:33:32] going to bring about he he he
[1:33:34] immediately tore his clothes and
[1:33:36] immediately went into ashes and
[1:33:38] sackcloth and was mourning and crying
[1:33:41] and screaming out before every one of
[1:33:44] the provinces as he was going through
[1:33:46] declaring what what what uh wickedness
[1:33:49] was going to be coming upon them and
[1:33:51] that and that he he just uh but you
[1:33:53] you'll notice There's No Cry Out unto
[1:33:56] the Lord there's no you know God is
[1:33:59] hidden in the midst of this whole thing
[1:34:02] God is hiding in the background just
[1:34:04] like today people think they know that
[1:34:06] God is doing this they think they
[1:34:08] understand what God is doing but they
[1:34:10] don't realize what God is doing in this
[1:34:12] hour but God has given you the ability
[1:34:14] by the by the holy spirit in you to
[1:34:17] recognize prophecy and identify with the
[1:34:21] prophecy where you fit into the prophecy
[1:34:23] prophecy and your part in the prophecy
[1:34:27] amen and so here Marduk was a Babylonian
[1:34:31] God and it stood known for for fair okay
[1:34:34] so the name morai is recognized in the
[1:34:36] Jewish faith born by the brave cousin
[1:34:40] and Foster father of Queen Esther
[1:34:43] whether you're raising baby spiritually
[1:34:46] or not morai carries both strength and
[1:34:50] kindness okay that's the name the
[1:34:53] strength that's in the name okay so now
[1:34:55] we understand the spirit that was on him
[1:34:59] now if we
[1:35:01] look
[1:35:03] at morai today we have an Israeli
[1:35:06] president by the name of Benjamin
[1:35:10] Netanyahu now by the way
[1:35:13] mori's
[1:35:16] genealogy went
[1:35:18] back to the Tribe of Benjamin because
[1:35:21] Saul who was the first king of Israel
[1:35:24] came out of the tribe of
[1:35:28] Benjamin and so today we have an Israeli
[1:35:31] president by the name of Benjamin
[1:35:33] Netanyahu and in March of
[1:35:36] 2012 and this I picked this up just this
[1:35:39] morning in March of 2012 Israeli
[1:35:43] president prime minister Benjamin
[1:35:44] Netanyahu gave us President Barack Obama
[1:35:49] a copy of the Book of
[1:35:51] Esther which will be read read in
[1:35:54] synagogues that week because it was
[1:35:56] March the week of
[1:35:59] purum and it would be read that week in
[1:36:02] observance of purum Esther tells the
[1:36:05] story of a Persian government that tries
[1:36:08] and fails to wipe out all the Jews in
[1:36:10] the Persian Empire according to the
[1:36:13] Israeli newspaper herzek Netanyahu saw
[1:36:17] this as an occasion to generalize about
[1:36:21] the Persians or as we call them today
[1:36:24] the
[1:36:25] Iranians he told Obama
[1:36:30] quote then too they wanted to wipe us
[1:36:36] out he was
[1:36:38] referencing how back then in the Book of
[1:36:43] Esther hmon who was a Jewish hater and
[1:36:48] we're going to talk about him in a
[1:36:49] minute wanted to wipe out the Jews
[1:36:54] and who's been standing for Israel like
[1:36:57] no other
[1:36:58] president Benjamin
[1:37:00] Netanyahu he's got the name
[1:37:02] Benjamin now you know sure that's a
[1:37:05] coincidence maybe I don't think
[1:37:08] so especially when you look at the next
[1:37:10] one I'm going to show you and here now
[1:37:14] we are looking at these things happening
[1:37:16] around us we're looking at the day we're
[1:37:17] living in we're looking at the actors
[1:37:19] The Players Benjamin Nat Netanyahu says
[1:37:24] every single one of those demons I'm
[1:37:27] gonna take their heads
[1:37:28] off I'm just you know giving you like my
[1:37:33] interpretation he's not given up he's
[1:37:36] not going to in any way shape or form
[1:37:39] allow Hamas or any any backed group any
[1:37:44] Iranian backed
[1:37:46] terrorist to come in and take control of
[1:37:49] their land why because God gave it to
[1:37:51] them I don't care what anybody says
[1:37:54] listen you want I see things now that
[1:37:56] they're going against Israel they want
[1:37:58] to put things against Israel I read a I
[1:38:00] read something yesterday Pastor Simon
[1:38:02] actually sent it to me of Air Canada and
[1:38:05] how they've changed their flight maps
[1:38:08] that fly into the Middle East now when
[1:38:10] you fly over the over the Middle East it
[1:38:13] says it doesn't say Israel it says
[1:38:16] Palestinian
[1:38:18] territories oh
[1:38:20] yeah they don't realize you cannot curse
[1:38:24] what God has
[1:38:25] blessed I don't care what anybody says
[1:38:28] I'm not here to to toot on Israel I'm
[1:38:30] not I'm here to talk about the word of
[1:38:33] God to tell you what the word of God
[1:38:35] says and how God is going to stand
[1:38:38] supernaturally just like he's done right
[1:38:40] from the very beginning you show me one
[1:38:43] time in the scriptures where God didn't
[1:38:46] tell his generals His prophets his
[1:38:50] Kings to go in and take the
[1:38:55] enemy anytime he said go I'm going to be
[1:39:00] there with you I will fight your battles
[1:39:04] you show me one time where he said that
[1:39:07] and it didn't come to pass I can show
[1:39:10] you places where he said don't
[1:39:13] go and yet they decided that they would
[1:39:15] go because they thought they could do it
[1:39:17] on their own and we should learn lessons
[1:39:20] from those things when we're under the
[1:39:22] inspiration of the Holy Spirit and God
[1:39:24] tells you something God shows you
[1:39:26] something God reveals to you and says
[1:39:28] don't or
[1:39:31] do don't or do it is my
[1:39:35] recommendation because if God says go it
[1:39:38] means he's with you it means he's going
[1:39:41] to stand behind you it means he's going
[1:39:43] to meet your need regardless of your
[1:39:45] situation you can stand on his word
[1:39:48] above everything else praise God Amen
[1:39:52] and Netanyahu is not going to bow down
[1:39:55] to any terrorist organization he wants
[1:39:58] to wipe them out annihilate them take
[1:40:01] them off the face of the Earth
[1:40:03] unfortunately the story doesn't end
[1:40:06] quite that way
[1:40:08] yet because the world is going to go
[1:40:11] into some pretty serious turmoil and
[1:40:13] Israel is going to have to face some
[1:40:15] pretty serious turmoil just like the
[1:40:18] rest of the world in the Great
[1:40:21] Tribulation amen praise God but we can't
[1:40:24] stop those things and so when we look
[1:40:27] here at these characters that are right
[1:40:31] now in our midst we see names tying in
[1:40:35] scripturally tying in and here now we're
[1:40:38] going to look at
[1:40:39] hmon now hmon in the Book of Esther hmon
[1:40:43] is identified as the son of uh hdath the
[1:40:48] agagite and is portrayed as a descendant
[1:40:52] of AAG the king of the amalekites we're
[1:40:55] talking about this king of the
[1:40:57] amalekites and the amalekites themselves
[1:40:59] they were
[1:41:01] demon Wicked they would do things that
[1:41:04] you wouldn't even imagine the kind of
[1:41:06] things that they would
[1:41:08] do oh yeah
[1:41:11] Wicked who was defeated by King
[1:41:14] Saul and slain by the prophet
[1:41:18] Samuel that was when when when God told
[1:41:22] Saul to go in and here's an example here
[1:41:24] where Saul you know was told by Samuel
[1:41:28] says go in take out the amalekites every
[1:41:31] man woman child Beast everything wipe
[1:41:35] out every Spirit people look back they
[1:41:38] think my God God going in and wiping out
[1:41:41] these people Nations it's because of the
[1:41:43] wickedness if you went back and actually
[1:41:45] looked in to their to to their rituals
[1:41:48] and their gods and the things that they
[1:41:50] did and and the things they worshiped
[1:41:52] and the prostitution and the the
[1:41:54] wickedness and the and they would they
[1:41:56] would Slaughter children they would do
[1:41:58] anything it was Absolute Total wickness
[1:42:02] demon power God didn't want them to have
[1:42:04] nothing to do with it that wasn't the
[1:42:07] spirit of God no sir but when God told
[1:42:10] Saul go in and take out every single one
[1:42:13] of them Saul decides not to kill the
[1:42:16] king he says oh we kept back certain
[1:42:19] things and when Samuel came in and saw
[1:42:22] what he had done it was his Rebellion to
[1:42:26] God that he didn't realize he had
[1:42:28] rebelled against the word of God and
[1:42:31] when you are given a commission by God
[1:42:33] to do something listen we have been
[1:42:36] called for a purpose in this hour let me
[1:42:39] tell you God has given us a purpose in
[1:42:42] this hour as Sons and Daughters of God
[1:42:44] every one of us given a position in the
[1:42:46] body of Christ and and if you've come
[1:42:48] under that leadership of the Holy Ghost
[1:42:50] and God has given you a a a a a a
[1:42:53] commission whether it's an office to
[1:42:55] minister a deacon or a trustee or an
[1:42:58] usher or whatever it is and you don't
[1:43:01] exercise that office to the fullest of
[1:43:03] your heart and your
[1:43:04] ability you look out you're going to get
[1:43:08] chastised amen you're going to get
[1:43:10] tested you're going to get shaped you're
[1:43:12] going to get you're going to get fixed
[1:43:14] and formed and and God is going to deal
[1:43:16] with whatever he's got to do to get you
[1:43:18] into your position and if you still
[1:43:20] aren't going to Rebel just like Saul
[1:43:22] you're going to lose your mind
[1:43:23] amen yes look
[1:43:26] out believe it this is the hour where
[1:43:29] God is requiring us to stand at our post
[1:43:32] and give all that we can not we're not
[1:43:35] serving man we serve the Living God Amen
[1:43:39] praise God God this is the hour where we
[1:43:42] serve a living God a present God he
[1:43:45] knows your every move he knows your
[1:43:47] every thought he he he has he has placed
[1:43:50] you into his heart
[1:43:53] and every time that things not stirring
[1:43:55] properly he's aware amen praise God Amen
[1:43:59] and so here
[1:44:03] God shows us here that it's not a
[1:44:06] coincidence that we have these
[1:44:08] characters identified together in in our
[1:44:11] day Mori the descendant of The Tribe of
[1:44:15] Benjamin who was of the lineage of King
[1:44:17] Saul who was the first king of Israel
[1:44:20] was The Descendant and Saul was a
[1:44:22] descendant of Benjamin
[1:44:23] Saul was the son of Kish of the family
[1:44:26] of the mates and a member of The Tribe
[1:44:29] of Benjamin and today when we look at
[1:44:33] hmon you go to the next
[1:44:35] slide his name is Ali huseni come
[1:44:41] in and right within his
[1:44:44] name I underlined it
[1:44:48] hmon right
[1:44:50] there now
[1:44:53] you know maybe some Muslim is going to
[1:44:55] see this today and he's going to say
[1:44:57] whatat are you
[1:44:58] doing I'm say I'm I'm talking about
[1:45:00] prophecy I'm talking about names I'm
[1:45:03] talking about positions I'm talking
[1:45:05] about the things that God prophetically
[1:45:08] is making known unto us in this day and
[1:45:11] in this hour so that we can recognize
[1:45:14] what God is doing we need to see God has
[1:45:17] given us the ability to recognize these
[1:45:19] things but he's not given us the ability
[1:45:21] to see these things so that it can uh so
[1:45:25] that we can go and change the world so
[1:45:27] that we can go and tell hey buddy your
[1:45:29] name's got hymon in there man like you
[1:45:31] know you're you're fulfilling that part
[1:45:33] you're the supreme leader of Iran and we
[1:45:35] know that you're behind a lot of these
[1:45:37] terrorist
[1:45:38] organizations and everything else but
[1:45:40] he's positioned there for a purpose just
[1:45:44] like Babylonians just like what when
[1:45:47] when Nebuchadnezzar or King Cyrus or any
[1:45:50] of the Kings or any of the positions
[1:45:52] they were placed there for a
[1:45:54] purpose Pharaoh for a
[1:45:58] purpose but God has given us the ability
[1:46:00] to
[1:46:02] recognize we can see these things and
[1:46:05] today we have this leader in Iran whose
[1:46:07] name is uh alii Kami his lineage goes
[1:46:11] all the way back to Ali abin Hussein
[1:46:15] Assad who was the great grandson of the
[1:46:18] Islamic Prophet
[1:46:21] Muhammad which is all the foundational
[1:46:23] teachings of of the
[1:46:26] Muslim
[1:46:28] teachings of
[1:46:34] today Saints what hour are we living in
[1:46:39] you know there was a
[1:46:40] prophecy when we read
[1:46:44] Esther uh chapter 9 verses 11 to 14 I'm
[1:46:49] going to read it to you and as we close
[1:46:51] here let the musici come and that day
[1:46:54] the number of those that were slain in
[1:46:57] shushan the palace was brought before
[1:46:59] the king and the King said unto Esther
[1:47:01] the Queen the Jews have slain and
[1:47:04] destroyed 500 men in shushan the palace
[1:47:07] and the 10 sons of
[1:47:09] hmon hmon had 10
[1:47:13] Sons what have they done in the rest of
[1:47:15] the king's
[1:47:17] provinces now what is thy petition he
[1:47:21] asks
[1:47:23] and it shall be granted thee or what is
[1:47:26] thy request further it shall be done
[1:47:29] here the king is now you know we're
[1:47:31] going to be looking at all this how how
[1:47:33] how how Esther was given a position of
[1:47:36] authority where she actually started to
[1:47:38] make the decrees where she started to
[1:47:40] speak the word where she was the one
[1:47:42] that actually uh unveiled the hidden
[1:47:45] aspects of of uh things that were going
[1:47:48] on and how morai why morai was was was
[1:47:52] uh uh you know made at the
[1:47:54] end second in command to the king you'll
[1:47:58] read it all in the story but Esther was
[1:48:00] behind all of it she was positioned for
[1:48:03] a certain purpose and here now he says
[1:48:05] what is thy request further and it shall
[1:48:07] be done then said Esther if it please
[1:48:09] the king let it be granted to the Jews
[1:48:12] which are in shushan to do tomorrow also
[1:48:16] according un this day's
[1:48:18] decree and let Hon's 10 Sons be hanged
[1:48:22] upon the
[1:48:24] Gallows and
[1:48:26] so I was doing some research and this is
[1:48:30] these are just things remember I'm not
[1:48:31] making anything out of this I'm bringing
[1:48:34] certain aspects as a minister and as as
[1:48:37] the pastor of the church things that the
[1:48:39] Lord lays upon my heart to bring to you
[1:48:42] and you know some Bible scholars say
[1:48:44] that this scripture was the prophecy of
[1:48:47] Esther fulfilled in
[1:48:50] 1946 because in 19 19 46 we know what
[1:48:54] happened in the Holocaust and how you
[1:48:57] know that same spirit that was on
[1:49:01] Hitler was the Same Spirit that was back
[1:49:04] on hmon it's that same Spirit that's
[1:49:07] always been there to take out the the
[1:49:10] children of Israel it's a wicked demon
[1:49:15] even the Holocaust they did atrocities
[1:49:17] and things to the Jewish people that we
[1:49:19] don't even want to
[1:49:20] mention but this is how Wicked those
[1:49:23] Spirits
[1:49:24] were and on October the 16th 1946 which
[1:49:28] was on the start day of the Feast of
[1:49:31] Tabernacles there was supposed to be
[1:49:34] 11 of these convicted Nazi war criminals
[1:49:39] that were to be hanged on that
[1:49:43] day and what ended up happening was one
[1:49:47] of
[1:49:48] them who was the main guy almost a type
[1:49:52] of
[1:49:53] hmon and you'll see that hmon was even
[1:49:56] hanged on the The Gallows that he built
[1:49:58] that he wanted to hang morai on and
[1:50:00] that's what the that's what the devil
[1:50:02] will always do if you stay with the word
[1:50:05] every trap that he lays for you he'll
[1:50:08] hang himself on
[1:50:10] it God will turn the wicked upon the
[1:50:16] wicked I can read you scriptures I
[1:50:18] scripture after scripture that the
[1:50:20] meditations of the wicked the end
[1:50:23] is not
[1:50:24] good even when they think about it
[1:50:27] they're just preparing for their own End
[1:50:30] Amen and here if we go to the next slide
[1:50:34] you'll see that one of them committed
[1:50:37] suicide there was 11 of them that were
[1:50:39] supposed to be hung that day but one of
[1:50:41] them committed suicide the night before
[1:50:43] by taking a Cai pill and they ended up
[1:50:46] hanging only
[1:50:49] 10 on that
[1:50:51] day now why am I bringing that
[1:50:54] up we know that these 10 Sons we know
[1:50:58] there's types in there we're going to
[1:51:00] get into that we're going to be looking
[1:51:01] at more of it the 10 Kings and the and
[1:51:03] and you know the Beast with the ten
[1:51:06] horns that came on the mystery Babylon
[1:51:08] you know on the on the the the statue at
[1:51:10] the B all these things they all have
[1:51:12] significance because they're all
[1:51:15] spirits but that was a prophecy that
[1:51:20] Queen Esther in the Book of Esther
[1:51:24] it happens Saints I'm not saying listen
[1:51:28] coincidence these things these things
[1:51:31] are not by coincidence when you're under
[1:51:32] the inspiration of the Holy Spirit God
[1:51:35] has Perfection within his word
[1:51:38] mathematics within his word now how is
[1:51:41] this going to put you in the Rapture I'm
[1:51:44] not saying it's going to put you in the
[1:51:46] Rapture what's going to put you in the
[1:51:48] Rapture is your ability to recognize
[1:51:51] your position in the word of God and
[1:51:53] recognize the prophecies that are
[1:51:55] happening around you the time the season
[1:51:58] the dispensation and what it is that the
[1:52:00] word is supposed to do for
[1:52:02] you and this is what we're going to be
[1:52:05] looking at next
[1:52:07] week may the Lord bless you go to the
[1:52:11] next slide it says in 1 Thessalonians
[1:52:14] 5:20 despise not
[1:52:18] prophesying because God's word will come
[1:52:22] to pass amen and the next slide we're
[1:52:25] just going to finish exactly what we
[1:52:27] started with Isaiah 14 but we're going
[1:52:28] to read the rest of it the Lord of host
[1:52:31] had sworn saying surely as I have
[1:52:33] thought so shall it come to pass and as
[1:52:36] I have purposed so shall it stand that I

[1:52:48] my mountains tread him underfoot then
[1:52:51] shall his yoke depart from off of them
[1:52:54] and his burden depart from off of their
[1:52:57] shoulders this is the purpose that is
[1:53:00] purposed upon the whole earth God has a
[1:53:03] plan of redemption Saints God is going
[1:53:05] to break every Assyrian power demonic
[1:53:09] influence that may be holding you back
[1:53:11] from being what you're supposed to be
[1:53:13] Amen in the word of God this is the
[1:53:16] purpose that is purposed upon the old
[1:53:18] Earth and this is the hand that is
[1:53:20] stretched out upon all
