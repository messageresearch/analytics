TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] jesus said i am come that you might have life and that you may have it more abundantly thank god for eternal life our topic for today is the book of life continuing teaching on the book of life praise god hallelujah last week we spoke about the great white throne judgment and the book of life this week we are particularly focused on the book of life may the great holy spirit take these uh a few words and uh interpret them bless them anoint them use them to open up the faculties of the mind and the temple of the heart may the great holy spirit bless us all today for his glory and for his honor praise be to god hallelujah amen speaking again from the book of revelation thanks be to god hallelujah and we are in the sardis church age amen praise god and in this sardis church age the lord himself speaking to us in chapter 3 amen he says here behold i come quickly amen and him that overcome it the same shall be clothed in white raiment and i will not blot out his name out of the book of life what i will confess his name before my father and before his angels he that had an heir to hear let him hear what the spirit saith on to the churches that is the sardis church age revelation chapter 3 reading verses 5 and 6 and we are teaching or speaking on the book of life now of course we touched on it as i've said last week when we spoke on the book of life and the great white throne judgment however we would specifically focus on the book of life itself of course i'm not the only teacher uh i'm not the only one given uh these things from the word of god but we are just doing our part and sharing with you what we know uh from the word of god i trust that that will be a blessing to your heart and to your soul and that you will not take it as one being spoon fed but as one who will take it go back to the bible back to the word search these things out whether they be true whether they are the word of god study the word of god read the bible read the books hear the sermons during the week and may they be a blessing to your soul to enrich to encourage and to uplift you in your walk with the lord amen hallelujah now to understand our subject more completely and remember i want to repeat i am speaking directly from the storehouse food that has been stored up by the ministry of william marion branham the prophet of this 20th century who has fulfilled malachi 4 5 revelation 10 7 and has been and is the voice of god to these last days and now praise god the bride of christ the children of god the great multitude the living epistles are on the scene the manifestation of the sons and daughters of god and the revealing of the son of man in his fullness on the face of the earth thanks be to god he that has eyes to see let him see and he who have ears to hear let him hear and recognized for the glory of god hallelujah now we will approach this subject from the point of view of the church through the ages until now we have been focusing upon the removal of the names of individuals from the book of life but we want to consider not the individuals today but groups that are in that book of life and represented in the church plant now to use an analogy used by god servant the record of the wheat plant is the record of the book of life using a wheat plant as an analogy for the book of life i want you to see that the record and process of growth of this wheat plant is similar to the record of the book of life now as we enter into this let us understand when we say book of life the book of life the book of life generalized the book of life as we will find is divided into sections let us look clearly in the word of god because jesus's plan or the plan of god can be seen unfolded or unveiled right here for a seed goes into the ground as jesus said and when the wheat seed is planted it does not come back up alone but it comes back up in a multiplied form this was his original purpose that he would give his life as the planting of the royal seed into the ground that it might be raised up and be multiplied for his spirit would then be available to all the holy spirit of almighty god now available to the true genuine wheat seeds of the living god amen we'll find now that he stands in the midst of the seven church ages similar to how the life goes through the plant so his life has been in the church through the entire process of growth for the bride right through all the ages until the ripening and harvesting time now as the wheat tassel and so on is used as a carrier for natural life to flow through it that it might produce itself in multiplied form and i want you to recognize this the cycle of growth is from original seed through the process of growth and ripening right back into the original seed form but now in multiplied fashion remember from seed back to seed many have been deceived disarmed and many have been misdirected by this in thinking that pentecost is your rival but i'm here to say no pentecost is just the shock that bears the original seed within and we will show as we study the word of the living god hallelujah you see when he gave his life he gave his life so that his life could be supernaturally reproduced into bodies like unto his glorious body a reproduction of himself here it is my friends so we must see the church or mary was only a carrier for the life or for the word of god but she was not the seed the church is not the original seed but only received the blessing and the honor of being the carrier for that life seed amen so that at the resurrection he will see his generation as the bible says for he will see many other royal seeds like unto himself reproduced by his spoken word and now here they are spoken reveal and now manifested before his very eyes oh thanks be to god for this unspeakable gift amen making himself known now let us look clearly this book of life is a book that holds all life natural and spiritual let me repeat the book of life in general is one book that holds the records of all life natural and spiritual if you want to visualize it as a book of two parts the book or you may say two sections but one part of the book of all life being the book of natural life one part can be perceived as the book of all natural life and the next part of course the record of all natural life all natural life comes to an end but the next part or section of that book of life is better known or called the lamb's book of life which is a spiritual record of the lives of those for known to eternal life so to repeat the book of life one general book in specific has a section that is the book of all natural natural life from organisms right on my friends right on through insects right through to the fullness of his creation individuals everything is specifically in that part of the book of life the book of natural life and the other part or section is the book of eternal life better known the lamb's book of life and that holds the records of the lives and names of those all those who have eternal life life with no end one book holds the lies that will end one book holds the lies with no ending whatsoever amen thanks be to god hallelujah amen so the record of this wheat plant then is to reproduce is the process it's illustrating it's revealing it's making it visual for us to see how that god was able to plant his life so that it may be multiplied and come back like and exactly as the original seed in multiplied form the book of life let me repeat the history or record of a wheat plant is the book of life which is a part of the overall or general book of life amen praise god that is one part the other part is the book of eternal life the lamb's book of life hallelujah my friends so then we see that by examining this we plant we see a process a seed is sown a blade or life is grown but it is not the wheat as yet it's just gone from seed to blade but it is not the seed as yet then it becomes a stalk but that is not the seeders yet and it grows through until it bears a tassel but the tassel amen is not the cedars yet that castle has got to be pollinated and when it's pollinated which is like equivalent to receiving the holy ghost or receiving revelation for divine pollination to produce a supernatural manifestation of god's own original life glory to god hallelujah this is the mystery of god me and made manifest that we can see and understand with clarity and simplicity the fullness of the mind of the living god amen praise god so as we look we can see there's a planting time there's a growing process a growing cycle that must go on and then there after that maturity of growth comes a ripening and a seasoning and a sweetening time oh my god may every believer come through this process may every one of us experience this marvelous and wonderful secret growth of the living god hallelujah and then after the ripening time when the sourness of attitudes the greenness the carnality the selfishness the stubbornness the self-will and so on of man is purged out then we find that believer with the sweetness of the character and person of christ christ in you your hope of glory amen then comes the harvesting time o praise god when they harvests come amen and the spirit crawls and comes to pick his fruit again glory be to god may we be sweet fruit to meet our lord at the time of his coming glory may we be ready to be received by the lord or praise god forevermore hallelujah that's why jesus gave his life that he may come back upon the church in pollination in the form of the holy spirit that he might bring many sons unto glory unto himself amen and bring them into the glory of a rapture and a resurrection we're in the midst of it right now while i am yet speaking we're in the midst of the supernatural process of god hallelujah but the wheat seed had to have a carrier to bring forth his multiplied with seed hallelujah and so there have to be a mary to be the carrier to bring forth christ the word she was not the originator of the word it did not originate from her originate from her it did not come from her it only passed through her and god ordained or designated her to be honored and blessed to be the carrier for himself the word of god to be revealed in flesh not by the will of man not by the blood of man but by the word of god and by the manifestation of the blessed holy spirit so even as mary was honored and blessed and used of god to be the carrier not the originator so has the church through the church ages being used of the living god to be the carrier for the word of god the original seed word of god not the originator she is not to speak of her own she is not to talk a lot of bull without the fullness of the word and spirit operating and moving and vindicating and confirming that it is him he the lord she is only being used as a carrier to bear the word of life amen so that the word can come back to its original form so the church cooperate through the seven church ages has been the carrier of the true seed though she herself is not i repeat she herself is not the true seed mary is not the true seed so the church is not the true seed hallelujah but the record of the church the record of the general book of life my friend is the book or record of the life or history of the entire wheat plant hallelujah let me repeat again like a carpenter nailing nails doesn't hit the hammer than the hell once but he hits it over and over again that it might really clinch in the heart hallelujah the original seed force was planted it was sown and then it had to be grown amen later it produced a stalk amen but the stock was not the original seed the blade was not the original seed amen and then from that came the castle amen that still was not the original seed husks and the wheat began to form within that the husk amen was not and is not the original ste seed amen for the seed will never be ear with the shock or the husks amen praise god hallelujah the pollen fell on the tassels like the holy spirit has come to fall upon us comes by grace revelation is by grace alone the holy spirit of almighty god reveals himself to whom he will reveal himself we cannot attract his attention by theology by the wisdom of man god is not attracted by all these man-made makeups oh but he's attracted by the recognition of the identity of his life and his spirit within that individual and the spirit of god by revelation pollinates that life that was laying in there not even recognized by itself but now identified and recognized and to be vindicated and manifested by the great holy spirit who comes to claim his own glory be to god hallelujah and so my friend the plant is pollinated let me share with you a truth here how a woman cannot produce a child without association with a man the hen can't produce good eggs without the rooster she may by human insemination through science satan and his means reproduce a counterfeit membership in her in her pews or in her numbers multitudes of them but that is not the original seed for it must first be pollinated by the original seed and without that you have a nest of rotten eggs or a church full of nominal believers christianity and name only but true sons and daughters of the living god are brought forth from the very minds or loins of god hallelujah and so is it my friend the church cannot produce members on her own even though she used insemination of theology she used insemination true colleges universities human education human will and skill that will not produce the original soup seed it can only produce counterfeits to the word of god until god himself produces his own original seed and come back to himself or what it was in the original and the plant has to go through this process for it was produced for this direct process the church was made and created for this process not for the church to be the seed but for the seed to pass through the church the church was produced to be the carrier or the bearer of the seed of god she was created to this end and that's the part that she must play amen so that the seed may go through its cycle and go back to being seed again hallelujah amen that so that part of the wheat plant that seed part of the wheat plant not the other parts but the seed is the eternal life that passed through her amen we have a perfect type of when like when israel went into egypt they all two million of them strong came out of egypt through the sacrificial blood of christ millions of people have left the world the flesh and the devil to come into the confines or the umbrella of the church in general and there they are many were baptized they were baptized in the red sea so many have been baptized confirmed christian whatever within the church the general church all came out of the waters pentecost came millions enjoyed the baptism and manifestations of the genuine holy spirit sent from god above upon his people amen and enjoy that even in our day when god sent his angel as he did back then listen to his voice oh my and we have eaten up this message we have eaten angels food in this day and in this hour until some people are getting tired of it they're tired of eating angel food they want to go back and eat their worldly meats and things that they can have in the world that's tasty and nice according to them when god gave them this word this message this hour this angel's food that may be not tasty to you because you're eating it over and over repetitiously but it is meant for your good amen all enjoyed the waters of life many and all it of angel's food all drank of the rock hallelujah for this true revelation has followed the church and the history and life of the church like the scarlet cord from rehab right through the bible from cover to cover the marking line of redemption the red stream of the blood of christ oh praise god forevermore something for us to hang on to something for us to believe and to recognize his life my friends but even though they all participated very few were able to come out joshua and caleb and the young ones and were able to enter into canaan's land remember all israel is not israel all who says they're jew is not a jew but they're liars my friends all who claim they are real genuine christians are not all christians but are liars to the word of god all who claim their believers of william branham's message are not all message believers they're all not the true seed of god for god selects that god elects that god knows that in his own mind and thoughts and he does that for his glory and no one else can for the message is less like a net that is called many to the word but then there comes when he begins to take out the spiders and the frogs and the rats and the foxes and the snakes and everything that's been hiding in there under this message in the net but they are and the power the holy spirit is upon us the true light now shines upon the heart and into the dark parts and the crevices of our souls revealing himself to us in this day and in this hour amen the same thing is in the church today names that are in the book of life many names in the book of life will be completely blotted out of the book of life that is to say the book of natural life that life is a life that will end and when the bible speaks about your names blotted out if your name is taken out of the book of natural life it comes as if you never even existed you are not even there so just to have your name left on the natural book that you were you were there that in itself is a blessing even though you will not be in eternal life but there are many whose names will be removed or blotted out from the book of life remember book of life in general made up of two sections the book of natural life and the book of eternal life better known as the lamb's book of life now notice carefully here hallelujah names will be bought blotted out of the natural book of life but no names will and can be blotted out of the lamb's book of life for he has said i will lose none not one praise god joseph's bones not one will be lost or left behind but he said every one i will bring them out every one to be saved by the grace of god amen this book of eternal life this lamb's book of life it is a record that god had given us eternal life and that life is in his son he that had the son had life hallelujah and he that hath not the son but not eternal life hallelujah praise god you see those who have eternal life now listen eternal life eternal without beginning without ending which means to say that those who have eternal life now were known by him were recognized by him for they already had eternal life in him with him and in him before the foundation of the world for they were apart of the great royal seed according to ephesians 1 they were chosen in him the true royal seed before the foundation of the world jesus himself was planted or in other words he died that his life may come up true the wheat seed plant of the church of the church i say his life is only going to pass through the church to reproduce itself in multitudes of other wheat seeds having the same life in them because of their the same original spirit of him and they are original as he is original so that's why he came to redeem them or buy them back hallelujah if you're redeeming something it means you already had it before and the thing became lost so when it became lost you went to the devil's pawn shop you went to the devon's prison house and you bought back that witch you lost for you seen it there and you bought it back hallelujah and jesus christ paid the price not with silver and gold nor the corruptable things of man am i but we were redeemed by the precious blood of jesus christ himself who led down his life amen and he's redeeming or bringing her back just like adam eve was a part of him to begin with the original seed was a part of the logos the lord jesus himself from the eternities past and came down to this earth and were lost but now he has come to redeem her with his own precious blood to bring her back to his side where she was to begin with as eve was in adam so must we be brought back to his side hallelujah and so the member names of his elected can never be removed from off the book of eternal life for she is a part of him she sits on the throne with him she can never be judged because she will and is in the throne with him at the white tron judgment to judge the entire world amen praise god remember the world will not be judged by church but it will be judged by the word he is the word and she is a part of the word messiah and messiahs christ and his bride hallelujah bridegroom and bride seated on the throne judgment is set amen praise god hallelujah everyone that is in the bride is a member of him and he he will lose none of them hallelujah but that has nothing to do with all are in the book just like all were in israel doesn't mean that all goes to canaan doesn't mean all goes to the promised land only a few that's why jesus said fair not little flock it is my father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom amen just a faithful few hallelujah will be brought out by his mighty hand because remember in the entire book of life in general there's that section where there is judith there is pharaoh nebuchadnezzar and many others of that like their names are in that book of natural life yes they were there yes they existed yes and so on and some of them their names will even be removed from that and they will be as if they never even existed in the face of the entire world hallelujah and so in these last days in which we live many will come saying have we not done great works said great things done great things in your name so did judas have we not done great works they'll cast out devils they'll be miracle men they'll have mass crusades with thousands of people in them they'll be great speakers great teachers well known as in the book of genesis men of renown great dignitaries multitudes following them have we not cast out devils in their name have we not done wonderful works and jesus will say as the bible says i never knew you that is to say he is not not that he is not aware of them but he is saying i never foreknew you you are not a part of my concern in this book of eternal life or the lamb's book of life amen because we know by god's omniscience he knows everything hallelujah but what he is saying here they were never for known in him they cannot deceive him they weren't in him to begin with they were not part of his wife or who came from his side they are not part of the word that came out or issued out from him amen and now they're coming back to make a claim and he says no i never knew you i never foreknew you you were not in my mind you were not in my for knowledge amen hallelujah they were not for known as the bride of christ is foreknown neither were therefore known like some of the righteous dead that will come up in the second resurrection because they have no fruit they bear no fruit there there is no there nothing outside of the word of god and they did not abide within the word therefore there will be sentence to death but before that takes place there's going to be a binding they're going to be a binding hallelujah and we find that when there's a binding my friends together oh let me say this way the books are going to be open harvest is ending and ended but when we read in the book of psalms i believe it's the 87th psalm where the misconception of many comes from where it reads the when the lord writes up the names of those who were born in zion when when they read that they believe god is now writing up names but that is really speaking simply of the roll call in heaven how that god will call out the names of those who are recorded in the lamb's book of life not that he doesn't know the names he doesn't have to write a a new book because he knows the names but this is speaking of raw call in heaven have you called your names out amen before all that are there because his promise i will confess the name before my father before all the angels amen it's wrong called time in heaven if a man dies shall he live again all the days of my appointed time i'll wait until my change come hallelujah and thou shalt call and i will answer thee thou shalt have a desire to the work of thy their your hands that will call and i will answer it's wrong call in heaven it's not writing a new book but it's the calling of the names of those who have been redeemed and called back to glory for the great shepherd is now calling his sheep and not in general but calling them by name by their names for the seals are now open names are being called the identification by revelation through the holy spirit is calling out those names oh praise god so that they let me recognize who they are amen it's not for god to recognize but for them to recognize who they are the creative voice of god is calling them forth from the dust from the denominations changing their atoms even though they have not yet fallen asleep what is it it's the rapture it's the process of the rapture until the event but the rapture process is now in progress and the great shepherd is now calling his sheep and he's calling them with specificity calling them by their names hallelujah the seals have been opened the names are being called hallelujah john heard his own name and saw his own name back there that's why he cried out oh praise god hallelujah the lion of the tribe of judah took the book broke the seals and now has come back to claim those whose names are in the book oh blessed be the name of the lord it is the rapture it's the marriage supper of the lamb and his bride the rapture my friends it's not the only wrong grow call but the second resurrection there'll be another role called the wrong call of the rest of them that makes up that book of eternal life for all in the book or the lamb's book of life are not the bride some will be servants some will be assistance to the bride and so on that's something else to give the breakdown of that entire lamb's book of life but in there will be the bride the 144 thousand souls under the altar the the laws of the second resurrection those given eternal life and so on they're my friends what a time that will be at the great white throne judgment when names will be confessed before his father and before all the angels amen i tell you the sweetest sound to the human air is to hear their own name called out in love oh my it touches the heart it trills the soul the sweetest sound to human ears amen hallelujah and there are some in the fleshly realm they just love to hear their names called amen before people love of acclaim and so on but let me tell you no artly voice will sound like this voice for it will be the voice of god calling out to his beloved brine be the voice of god calling out your name out of the lamb's book of life which names remain to be revealed before the holy angels of the living god hallelujah oh what a day it will be when my jesus i shall see when i oh praise god when i hear his voice when i hear his call oh praise be to god amen jesus will say father i have confessed my name before they have confessed my name before men in the days of their earthly pilgrimage of their journey now i will confess their names before thee and before all of the heavenly angels now you have heard this sermon you have heard this teaching but he that had an ear to hear let him or her adult or child hear the word of god and live for the grace of god once again the spirit of the lord has spoken once again we have reviewed the record of the book of life the lamb's book of life and what the spirit said to the other ages and how faithful god has been to fulfill his word to every other age what a consolation to our souls to know that he is faithful and true god has been faithful to every promise to this age of sardis and he will be faithful and is true to every other age hallelujah and if we by grace receive his commendation my friend then we will say let us therefore go on to perfection and meet the lord in the air and together let us be forever with our lord may the lord bless you and may the pronouncements teachings from this word of god dwell richly in your hearts by faith the lord bless you until next wednesday when we come together and we will be speaking on the opening of the philadelphia church age may we pray god to rain down his blessings upon us until then god watch between us until we meet again amen [Music] you
