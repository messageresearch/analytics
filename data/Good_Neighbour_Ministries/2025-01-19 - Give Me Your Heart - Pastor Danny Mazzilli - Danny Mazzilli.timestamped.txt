[38:05] Amen Let me just make sure everything's
[38:08] plugged in
[38:11] here
[38:13] okay there we go amen we had to get a
[38:17] new
[38:18] computer the um the
[38:21] laptop was giving up the
[38:23] ghost it's been working hard the last uh
[38:28] year over a year here it's been working
[38:30] really hard but it's it was an old
[38:31] laptop and it was giving me some
[38:33] warnings and I said okay you know did it
[38:36] once did it twice I said no not waiting
[38:38] for number three and it'd always be
[38:40] right just before I was coming out all
[38:42] of a sudden the screen would start going
[38:43] crazy and I'd have to reboot it and this
[38:45] and that and I thought okay it's telling
[38:47] me 10 years you've done your time praise
[38:50] God so we thank God for his goodness and
[38:54] his grace amen and I trust that you're
[38:57] all excited about uh the word this
[39:00] morning because I can tell you I am amen
[39:04] I am very excited by the word of God
[39:07] anytime you know and this week uh has
[39:10] been it's been a struggle it's been a
[39:13] struggle to you know to just find you
[39:16] know the direction and and you know so
[39:18] many different areas and just hours and
[39:21] hours and hours and just not feeling you
[39:23] know but then all of a sudden you just
[39:26] keep pressing you keep pressing you keep
[39:28] wrestling with the angel amen and uh all
[39:30] of a sudden you know things start to
[39:32] stir within your heart and then you
[39:34] start to realize okay Lord um this is
[39:37] the direction that you want us to go and
[39:39] so I welcome every one of you but at the
[39:42] same time I want you to know that I've
[39:44] got nothing
[39:46] new everything everything's been
[39:49] revealed the seals are open praise God
[39:53] that's that's that's what's uh so
[39:55] wonderful about this end time ministry
[39:59] and uh you know that's why when brother
[40:01] Branham finished the preaching of the
[40:02] Seven Seals a lot of the people went
[40:05] away from him they didn't realize you
[40:08] know what had actually happened you know
[40:10] and uh uh but um Christ himself had come
[40:14] now to take over and anytime Christ
[40:17] comes on the scene in that way the
[40:20] people scatter there's there's confusion
[40:24] in the midst of the people but
[40:26] everything that uh the Lord wants to
[40:28] reveal um is is uh has been revealed
[40:32] through the opening of the seals and is
[40:35] continuing to unveil itself through the
[40:39] bride and this is why the enemy cannot
[40:42] impersonate amen that's why um we will
[40:46] always have a different message we are
[40:48] not like the rest of the churches we
[40:50] preach from the same scriptures we read
[40:53] the same Bible um you know but yet our
[40:56] mess message is completely different and
[41:00] if you go back and you you know you see
[41:02] everything that that took place after
[41:04] the opening of those seals um there's
[41:06] not a lot of you know you won't see a
[41:09] lot of what is being
[41:12] preached being spoken through the seven
[41:15] Church
[41:16] ages it was all you know uh around the
[41:20] word Around The Messengers um it was
[41:23] about Christ but then they couldn't
[41:26] really recognize
[41:28] the unfolding and the and and the Amor
[41:31] of God coming down into his people and
[41:35] now um the Holy Spirit and the gifts and
[41:38] that which took place on the day of
[41:40] Pentecost made way for himself for
[41:42] Christ himself to come and that's what
[41:45] the opening of the word uh through the
[41:47] ministry of William Branham did it
[41:49] opened those Seven Seals a lot of the
[41:52] people are under confusion about uh you
[41:54] know the Book of Revelation oh it's it's
[41:57] confusing you can't understand it you go
[41:59] back and you read it and you know John
[42:02] must have been on some sort of you know
[42:04] Earthly herbs maybe he was on marijuana
[42:07] or something and you know he was seeing
[42:09] all these different things but they
[42:11] don't realize that it was
[42:13] Christ in type in all aspects in symbol
[42:18] form and it takes the Holy Spirit it
[42:21] takes the spirit of God to come into now
[42:24] the
[42:25] individuals not into a church but the
[42:28] individuals that make up the body of
[42:30] Christ that make up the church and now
[42:33] they've come to realize that something
[42:36] greater is now happening in their
[42:38] midst and and it it'll never be like the
[42:43] the denominational teachings out there
[42:45] it'll be Christ himself again in the
[42:48] midst of his people amen praise God and
[42:51] so he's he's decided to use a five-fold
[42:53] Ministry you know um Jehovah Gyra
[42:56] Jehovah
[42:58] Jehovah the word Jehovah means god
[43:01] becoming it's God becoming so when we
[43:04] say Jehovah Gyra it's God becoming our
[43:07] provider he's constantly unveiling
[43:10] himself in us in our day in the
[43:14] circumstances that we're dealing with
[43:16] when we talk about Jehovah nii it's the
[43:19] Lord who is fighting our battles now and
[43:23] who will fight all of our battles for us
[43:26] you see it's it it's understanding that
[43:28] he's now present and he's he's becoming
[43:32] everything that he needs to become in
[43:34] you in me
[43:37] personally praise God and we need to
[43:40] come to that Revelation personally where
[43:43] we realize it's God in us and then
[43:47] things really start to change so this
[43:50] this this revelation will never stop
[43:53] unveiling itself never stop never stop
[43:57] so uh I'm not going to look for
[44:00] something new I'm just going to allow
[44:02] him to live through amen and that's what
[44:05] we want to do that's what that's why we
[44:07] come into the house of the Lord you got
[44:09] problems you got situations you got
[44:12] circumstances that you're dealing with
[44:13] right now and you want God to meet those
[44:16] needs and you you need a God that's
[44:18] present now amen that's going to speak
[44:21] to your situations now discern your your
[44:23] life now so that you can be set free
[44:26] amen amen am praise
[44:28] God let's go to the word of God who has
[44:31] a request this morning amen praise God
[44:34] father you hear and you see every
[44:37] uplifted heart and every uplifted hand
[44:40] Lord may you come this morning once
[44:42] again Lord and speak to our hearts Lord
[44:45] you're the only one that can bring life
[44:47] to the word of God and do it in such a
[44:50] way that every single need can be met in
[44:53] one service Lord you know we we have
[44:57] many needs but there's things that are
[44:59] that are right now upon our hearts that
[45:02] Lord one day at a time one step at a
[45:04] time one victory at a time lord show us
[45:08] and give us those victories Lord grant
[45:12] it this morning Lord as I yield this
[45:14] vessel to your service Lord May the
[45:15] hearts of your people be open and and
[45:19] willing and may they pull by faith upon
[45:22] your word and meet us in that place that
[45:27] secret place father we pray Lord we
[45:30] commit the service into your hands and
[45:33] we submit and humble ourselves to you in
[45:36] Jesus name amen amen praise God I want
[45:41] to talk this morning on the title give
[45:43] me your
[45:47] heart we're going to see how the holy
[45:49] spirit opens it up it's going to be
[45:52] different to every single one of you um
[45:56] it's it's something that uh you know I
[45:59] was I was you know struggling through
[46:02] and while I'm going through all of that
[46:03] the Lord is dealing with my heart and
[46:06] this is how you know this is how we know
[46:09] that we're dealing with a living God
[46:10] Amen and so let's read the scriptures
[46:14] and let's move along and let's see what
[46:15] the Lord is going to do for us Amen in
[46:18] Proverbs 23: 26 it says my
[46:22] son give me thine
[46:25] heart and let Thine Eyes observe my
[46:30] ways amen you may be
[46:35] seated the Lord wants us to give him our
[46:40] hearts you know this proverb here from
[46:43] Proverbs 23 it's Solomon and I imagine
[46:46] maybe you know if we if we could picture
[46:48] Solomon at this time when he was writing
[46:51] this you know he he may have been
[46:52] talking to some of his his sons you know
[46:56] he had a lot of them there'd be many of
[46:58] them born every day but in it we know
[47:02] that this that that the spirit of God
[47:04] was anointing Solomon was anointing him
[47:07] to write these things and to say these
[47:09] things and so when we read it and we
[47:13] look through the scriptures we know that
[47:14] it's the it's God it's his spirit and
[47:17] it's his voice speaking to us amen and
[47:20] we need to recognize you know what it is
[47:23] that that you know was really in his
[47:24] thoughts and in his mind at that
[47:27] time and when we read our next
[47:30] scripture um in Psalms 24
[47:35] 3-5 it says who shall Ascend into the
[47:38] hill of the Lord or who shall stand in
[47:42] his holy place he that hath Clean
[47:46] Hands and a pure heart who hath not
[47:50] lifted up his soul unto vanity nor sworn
[47:54] deceitfully he shall receive reive the
[47:57] blessing from the Lord and righteousness
[48:01] from God from the god of his salvation
[48:05] so it won't be it won't be our
[48:08] righteousness it won't be our uh ability
[48:13] it won't be because we create our own
[48:15] blessings but because we have a pure
[48:20] heart towards God and we've we we've
[48:23] recognized that we've made him our
[48:24] absolute and our heart is where he sits
[48:29] we're going to look at these things as
[48:31] we go through this and we realize that
[48:35] we need his
[48:38] salvation his
[48:40] righteousness not our own ability but
[48:43] it's something that he's that he's
[48:45] willing to give if we're willing to
[48:48] surrender if we're not willing to give
[48:52] up amen praise God and so
[48:57] let me read this quote here brother
[48:58] brandham speaking here and God keeps his
[49:00] word he says our God he's praying now he
[49:04] says we come to thee in the name of thy
[49:06] beloved Son who has bid us to come
[49:09] saying ask the father anything in my
[49:12] name I'll do it so we come in jesus'
[49:15] name to re to First repent of our own
[49:19] sin and our shortcomings and to ask thee
[49:22] to cleanse us from all of our iniquity
[49:25] and to purge our fa thinking that we
[49:27] will think upon the things that are
[49:30] right and pertaining to the kingdom of
[49:33] God and so here the prophet is is
[49:35] praying and he's he's humbling himself
[49:37] and he's saying Lord cleanse us Purge us
[49:41] for what you're about to do for us and I
[49:44] believe that's the desire of every one
[49:45] of you this morning that you've come
[49:47] into the house of the Lord this morning
[49:49] with an expectation but but you you've
[49:52] you've you've cleansed your your your
[49:54] heart you've you've you've settled it
[49:56] with God that Lord I know I've made
[49:58] mistakes I know I'm just human I know
[50:01] I'm failing in a lot of areas but Lord I
[50:04] need you to come and here he says and
[50:07] may our thoughts be tonight on something
[50:10] that would better the kingdom of God and
[50:13] would better the people that are in the
[50:15] kingdom and may our hearts be purged
[50:19] from all foul
[50:22] things we desire to walk upright before
[50:25] thee with CLE Clean Hands and a pure
[50:29] heart but now pay attention here and he
[50:32] says and oh God Alone can do this amen
[50:37] he's the only one that can purify us
[50:40] Purge us cleanse Us by the blood that
[50:44] he's provided for us we need to realize
[50:47] this this is the ultimate uh key for us
[50:50] to come before the Lord boldly when we
[50:53] when we come through the blood accepting
[50:56] what what he has done what he is
[51:00] doing and we pray father to cleanse our
[51:05] hands and purify our hearts wash Us in
[51:08] the waters of separation from the things
[51:11] of the world how by the word amen thank
[51:17] you Jesus no other way it's going to
[51:20] have to be by the word of God
[51:22] Amen and
[51:24] here in Matthew 22 we're just laying in
[51:27] a foundation here for what we're going
[51:29] to move
[51:31] into in Matthew 22:
[51:34] 36-39 they asked the Lord Jesus a
[51:37] question and they said Master which is
[51:40] the great commandment in the law and
[51:44] Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the
[51:47] Lord thy God with all thine
[51:50] heart and with all thy soul and with all
[51:55] thy mind this is the first and great
[51:58] commandment and the second is like unto
[52:01] it Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[52:04] thyself on these two Commandments hang
[52:07] all the law and the
[52:10] prophets so what are we hearing
[52:13] here that that he's got to become our
[52:18] absolute amen not only in our hearts but
[52:22] in our soul and in our minds in our
[52:26] minds you see here's the here's the only
[52:29] place in this Dimension as a human being
[52:33] where you're going to have a conscious
[52:34] mind where you're where where it's
[52:37] actually going to be a mind that's
[52:38] against
[52:39] you because it's of this Dimension it's
[52:43] of this world it's it's what picks up
[52:46] all the the the communication and the
[52:49] frequency of this Dimension
[52:51] here your heart and your soul
[52:56] is the attribute of God that is what
[53:00] communicates with God that is what is
[53:03] connected to God that is what God has
[53:06] placed in you in order for you to have a
[53:10] relationship with
[53:12] him without that there is no
[53:15] relationship with
[53:17] God it is only based on what perception
[53:21] and what the world will teach and you'll
[53:24] get caught by all of those things
[53:27] whether it be Buddhism or or or uh
[53:31] different teachings of New Age and and
[53:33] all kinds of different interpretations
[53:36] of what God is and the universe and
[53:38] everything else that's all carnal it's
[53:42] all mind and it's all against
[53:48] God the only thing that's pure is his
[53:53] word and that's why he said thy Thou
[53:56] shalt love the Lord thy
[53:58] God with all those aspects Mind Body
[54:03] Soul you need to you need to give
[54:05] yourself wholly and completely unto the
[54:08] Lord otherwise there is no real
[54:12] relationship I'm not talking about being
[54:15] just a church member here this has gone
[54:18] Way Beyond we're way down the road
[54:20] Beyond church membership Saints this is
[54:23] where it's you and God Alone where
[54:25] you've come into a relationship and
[54:27] you're naked before God and you're and
[54:30] you're only accountable to
[54:32] him amen praise
[54:35] God and so uh you know in Matthew
[54:39] 5:8 Jesus himself said blessed are the
[54:43] pure in
[54:45] heart pure in heart you can't mix
[54:49] anything in there you can't mix any
[54:50] man's teachings you can't mix anything
[54:53] it's got to be pure word of God and
[54:56] that's why it'll only be a bride that
[55:00] will receive the pure word a church a
[55:03] bride remember when we say bride we're
[55:05] always talking about the church and
[55:08] it'll it'll only be a
[55:11] pure spotless
[55:14] sinless virgin bride that will be able
[55:19] to have a pure
[55:21] heart and you're saying oh wait a minute
[55:24] here you mean I got to be perfect no you
[55:26] can't be perfect there's absolutely no
[55:30] way you could be
[55:31] perfect God has already provided away
[55:36] for us and that was by him going to the
[55:39] cross and taking all of our sin on him
[55:44] and giving up the spirit the Holy Ghost
[55:46] so that it could come back on us and now
[55:49] the Holy Ghost is what gives us the
[55:52] ability to believe the pure word am
[55:57] without the spirit of Christ the pure
[56:00] unadulterated holy
[56:03] ghost in you you'll never be able to see
[56:07] or receive the pure
[56:11] word we're going to be looking at this a
[56:14] little deeper in the next you know maybe
[56:17] into next week okay but I'm just laying
[56:19] in a foundation right now now notice
[56:23] here in when Jesus is speaking here
[56:27] during um The Sermon on the
[56:31] Mount I want you to notice that he's
[56:34] referencing constantly to the heart of
[56:36] man and he's he's moving his thoughts
[56:39] and all of his his preaching it's
[56:43] preaching Beyond
[56:44] this because they were the Pharisees
[56:48] they were they were under the law
[56:50] everything was based on the law of the
[56:52] word everything was based on the written
[56:53] word and and Jesus here here he comes
[56:57] and now he's he's like speaking and he's
[57:00] doing things that are that are against
[57:03] their law here he is picking corn on the
[57:06] Sabbath day and they're and and they're
[57:08] and they're coming to him and say what
[57:10] are you doing how is it that you're
[57:12] disciples are picking corn on the
[57:14] Sabbath day but Jesus could take the
[57:17] word in such a way that he would take it
[57:20] to another
[57:21] level watch here once the Heart Is Right
[57:25] the spirit is is right then our flesh
[57:27] and our human self comes up comes comes
[57:29] under the leadership of
[57:32] Christ so he says in Matthew 5:21 to 23
[57:36] says you have heard that it was said by
[57:39] them of old that thou shalt not kill and
[57:41] whosoever shall shall uh kill shall be
[57:44] in danger of the Judgment but I say unto
[57:46] you that whosoever is angry with his
[57:49] brother without a cause shall be in the
[57:52] danger shall be in danger of the
[57:54] judgment and who so whoever shall say to
[57:57] his brother raka shall be in danger of
[57:59] the counsel but whosoever shall say thou
[58:02] fool shall be in danger of Hell Fire
[58:05] therefore if thou bring thy gift to The
[58:08] Altar and there rememberest that thy
[58:11] brother hath ought against thee leave
[58:14] there thy gift before the Altar and go
[58:17] thy way first be reconciled to thy
[58:20] brother and then come and offer thy gift
[58:23] so he was taking it to a level like he's
[58:26] he's saying you don't need to actually
[58:27] murder somebody to be to be brought
[58:31] before the Judgment you just need to
[58:32] hold an evil thought towards your
[58:35] brother or say something against your
[58:38] brother in your own heart and now you
[58:41] come under
[58:43] condemnation to the
[58:45] Judgment you've heard that it was said
[58:47] that of old time Thou shalt not commit
[58:49] adultery but I say unto you that
[58:51] whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust
[58:54] after her hath committed adultery with
[58:56] her already in his
[58:59] heart so he's taking it right to another
[59:02] level in other words listen you're not
[59:05] going to you're not going to make it
[59:06] based on your own righteousness you're
[59:08] not going to make it based on your own
[59:10] ability you're not going to make this
[59:12] you're not going to make the Rapture
[59:14] based on on on how how good you are how
[59:18] how well you attend church and how much
[59:20] you pray and and and no it's not going
[59:24] to that's not going to do it
[59:27] amen amen we're going to see how this
[59:30] he's he is the word made flesh now to
[59:33] dwell among his
[59:35] creation he's come here to speak and to
[59:39] deal directly with our heart our soul
[59:43] the attribute that's in us to bring us
[59:46] into our perfect revelation of who we
[59:50] are amen glory to
[59:53] God so here
[59:56] everything was about the law back then
[59:58] based on the works of the hand trying
[1:00:01] hands trying to live a perfect life but
[1:00:04] Jesus came looking for perfect
[1:00:06] Hearts he's here to purge to purify and
[1:00:11] to and to possess our hearts amen amen
[1:00:17] he's not looking for perfect lives he's
[1:00:20] looking for
[1:00:21] perfect resolution and perfect
[1:00:24] submission
[1:00:26] amen fully yielded
[1:00:28] vessels no one could ever live a perfect
[1:00:31] life you can't live a perfect life we're
[1:00:34] all born in sin we're all shaped in
[1:00:36] iniquity there's a nature that was
[1:00:39] placed upon us from the original sin
[1:00:42] back in the Garden of Eden that placed a
[1:00:44] nature of the
[1:00:46] Beast a beast nature is actually Upon
[1:00:49] Our flesh and it's all come down through
[1:00:54] the generations
[1:00:56] and that's why Jesus himself when when
[1:00:59] when when he had to come as a man he
[1:01:01] could not come through through ordinary
[1:01:05] you know he couldn't come through a
[1:01:06] through through a a sex act it had to be
[1:01:10] the Holy Ghost
[1:01:12] himself the blood of God it was both egg
[1:01:16] and Seed of God that he placed in the
[1:01:19] Virgin
[1:01:20] Mary and it was her
[1:01:23] ability her faith to be able to say be
[1:01:27] it unto me according to Thy
[1:01:30] word that brought
[1:01:32] forth the Son of
[1:01:35] God she had nothing to do with the
[1:01:39] actual body of Jesus Christ other than
[1:01:42] she was a carrier her egg had nothing to
[1:01:45] do with the birth amen when the Holy
[1:01:49] Ghost came he didn't just inseminate a
[1:01:51] seed of sperm he inseminated both
[1:01:56] Hallelujah in his own image thank you
[1:01:59] Jesus glory to God he he placed he
[1:02:01] placed his own word seed
[1:02:04] perfect and that's why when he gave up
[1:02:07] the ghost he gave up the spirit and the
[1:02:11] spirit comes now upon a virgin church
[1:02:14] that believes and says be it unto me
[1:02:17] according to Thy
[1:02:19] word she will bring forth the pure
[1:02:22] unadulterated Jesus Christ again for the
[1:02:25] rest
[1:02:27] rure hallelujah praise God and so here
[1:02:31] now we're going to look at what we
[1:02:34] originally started with here in the
[1:02:36] scripture in Proverbs
[1:02:38] 23 because it's it's in the same chapter
[1:02:43] and I want I want us to see here how it
[1:02:45] is that the Lord is dealing with us how
[1:02:48] he's how he's speaking to us here is
[1:02:50] Solomon maybe with his sons but here is
[1:02:53] God now with you
[1:02:56] and he says for as he thinketh in his
[1:02:58] heart so is
[1:03:00] he a lot of people you know they take
[1:03:03] this you know um this thought and they
[1:03:07] and they and they they take it and and
[1:03:09] and they apply it like the New Age
[1:03:11] movement does that you know what you
[1:03:12] think about all day long that's what you
[1:03:15] become no that's not it that's not what
[1:03:19] it is yes your thoughts do
[1:03:22] influence
[1:03:24] this but this ain't going to inherit the
[1:03:26] kingdom of God this is not what God came
[1:03:29] for we're way down the road Saints we're
[1:03:31] not looking for for for these bodies to
[1:03:33] be changed you know these these flesh
[1:03:36] bodies we're looking for the new body
[1:03:39] amen the one that's already been placed
[1:03:42] in us as an attribute of God right there
[1:03:46] in our hearts amen and so you know let's
[1:03:51] let's uh I'm I'm just going to read
[1:03:54] Proverbs 23
[1:03:56] and just comment on
[1:03:58] it as we lead into this I'm going to
[1:04:00] start from verse one now here he is and
[1:04:03] he says when thou sest to eat with a
[1:04:05] ruler consider diligently what is before
[1:04:08] thee now he's just
[1:04:10] taking a circumstance here he's talking
[1:04:14] to his sons look at it that way just
[1:04:17] let's let's see it that way and he's
[1:04:19] talking to them about life because he's
[1:04:22] a he's a great king he's a great ruler
[1:04:25] he rules over a great Kingdom and he's
[1:04:27] the richest man on earth right now but
[1:04:29] one thing God gave him was was
[1:04:31] incredible wisdom and we can draw from
[1:04:34] that wisdom and we want to see how this
[1:04:36] scripture pertains here he says you know
[1:04:39] and put a knife to thy
[1:04:41] throat consider diligently what is
[1:04:44] before thee and put a knife to thy
[1:04:46] throat if thou be a man given to
[1:04:49] appetite be not desirous of his dainties
[1:04:53] for they are deceitful meat he's saying
[1:04:55] listen
[1:04:56] don't be so carnal that you're going
[1:04:59] after all the things of the flesh oh
[1:05:01] this is a nice dinner oh look at those
[1:05:03] beautiful wine glasses and oh my
[1:05:06] goodness there's more glasses here than
[1:05:08] one glass for each sip you know and all
[1:05:11] kind and you you get you get mesmerized
[1:05:13] and and God is telling us that this
[1:05:15] world we've come into a time in a season
[1:05:18] where where the world is so rich in need
[1:05:22] of
[1:05:23] nothing there's Wealth Beyond
[1:05:26] you
[1:05:27] know ridiculous amounts of wealth single
[1:05:30] individuals that are that are worth
[1:05:32] billions and and and hundreds of
[1:05:35] billions of dollars and you can imagine
[1:05:37] the the you know the in need of
[1:05:40] nothing even even you know like I mean
[1:05:44] okay we live in America and we see it
[1:05:46] even more but even the poor they can
[1:05:49] stand on the corners and people hand
[1:05:52] them
[1:05:53] money people just hand them money and
[1:05:56] they do it now as a job that's why
[1:05:57] you'll see them on all the corners
[1:05:59] because because they're getting money
[1:06:02] and some of them are going home with
[1:06:03] three 400 bucks a day you know it's just
[1:06:08] because the poor are going to be with us
[1:06:12] always and so we're living in a time
[1:06:15] where where where things are available
[1:06:17] but he says but labor not to be rich
[1:06:19] cease from thine own wisdom wil thou set
[1:06:23] thine eyes upon that which is not for
[1:06:26] riches certainly may may make themselves
[1:06:29] Wings they fly away as an eagle towards
[1:06:32] heaven eat thou not the bread of him
[1:06:35] that hath an evil
[1:06:38] eye you know when you're working
[1:06:42] work work with
[1:06:47] Integrity do and and work with the
[1:06:50] Integrity of God in your heart he's
[1:06:51] telling you these are simple ways of us
[1:06:54] living but this is all come into
[1:06:56] something so pay
[1:06:58] attention he says uh eat thou not the
[1:07:02] bread of him that hath an evil eye
[1:07:03] neither desire thou his dainty Meats for
[1:07:06] as he thinketh in his heart so is he you
[1:07:12] see how now see see how the scripture
[1:07:14] all of a sudden it's got a a
[1:07:16] different understanding here and other
[1:07:21] words what's in that person's heart
[1:07:24] unless the holy Spirit replaces it with
[1:07:28] an
[1:07:29] attribute unless the spirit of God comes
[1:07:32] in by a new birth into that individual
[1:07:35] and there and that heart now is filled
[1:07:37] with the sole attribute of
[1:07:41] God
[1:07:43] he's headed for
[1:07:46] Destruction because without Christ there
[1:07:48] is no salvation without God there is no
[1:07:52] salvation
[1:07:55] he you got to bring the whole thought
[1:07:57] into the context so is he he says eat
[1:08:01] and then he goes on he says eat and
[1:08:02] drink saith he to thee but his heart is
[1:08:06] not with
[1:08:07] thee there's a lot of pleasures of this
[1:08:10] life and there's a lot of things and
[1:08:13] teachings in this life but Satan's
[1:08:16] Satan's motive in all these new age
[1:08:19] teachings and even applying and taking
[1:08:20] the word of God in the way that he has
[1:08:23] here is to dece the people and make them
[1:08:27] feel like they're semi-religious see as
[1:08:30] a man thinks in his heart so is he so I
[1:08:33] can think on all the the wealth and all
[1:08:36] the pleasures I'm going to imagine
[1:08:38] myself in that yacht until it
[1:08:40] materializes before
[1:08:42] me and
[1:08:44] all Solomon said about all of that was
[1:08:47] vanity of
[1:08:49] vanities because this world is not going
[1:08:52] to get better it's right now in a
[1:08:55] massive nose dive towards
[1:08:59] tribulation and this is the only
[1:09:02] message that will bring
[1:09:05] Salvation the only message not the
[1:09:08] message that Danny misil is bringing or
[1:09:11] what the the churches are are bringing
[1:09:14] the message is Christ
[1:09:17] himself who is saying to you come unto
[1:09:20] me and I will give you rest amen he that
[1:09:24] believeth and is baptized shall be
[1:09:28] saved he that heareth my
[1:09:30] words hath eternal life in them if they
[1:09:34] can receive
[1:09:37] it this is a word test we're we're
[1:09:41] living in the last age of the greatest
[1:09:44] word test that is ever going to be
[1:09:46] placed upon the
[1:09:49] church and when we're talking about the
[1:09:52] word test we're not talking about
[1:09:54] denominational Church is out there like
[1:09:57] I said we are way down the road from
[1:10:00] that this is where this message this
[1:10:06] church this end time message that we are
[1:10:09] following is now going to get tested
[1:10:12] beyond what you ever could have imagined
[1:10:16] you think you're going through trials oh
[1:10:18] I got a terrible trial I got to come up
[1:10:20] with $500 next
[1:10:23] month yeah that might look like a
[1:10:24] terrible
[1:10:26] trial but let me tell you that is not
[1:10:28] really the true test that you're going
[1:10:29] to face the one that you're going to be
[1:10:32] facing that is going to that's that's
[1:10:34] going to be staring you right in the
[1:10:36] face will be the test of whether you can
[1:10:38] you can take this word and stand on this
[1:10:42] word and allow it to have absolute
[1:10:45] control over your
[1:10:47] life Oh Glory we're going to move along
[1:10:51] here there's been a growing belief
[1:10:53] within Christianity that started with
[1:10:55] the power of positive thinking from this
[1:10:57] very scripture here movements that what
[1:11:01] a person repeatedly thinks about and how
[1:11:03] they think about it will determine uh
[1:11:06] what they're becoming I'm saying to you
[1:11:09] you can maybe affect this flesh with
[1:11:12] this with this positive mental aspect
[1:11:15] and and it is good and I always preach
[1:11:16] you need to have a positive outlook as
[1:11:19] Christians especially those that are
[1:11:21] revelated by the word of God in this
[1:11:23] hour we should be the happiest people we
[1:11:26] should be able to be positive in in
[1:11:28] bringing forth a positive
[1:11:32] gospel but this this thinking of how the
[1:11:35] world is is actually quoting it and
[1:11:38] they're saying that it's actually a
[1:11:42] neuroscientific proven fact that you can
[1:11:45] change the molecules by visualizing and
[1:11:49] by doing all those things the only
[1:11:52] molecular change I'm looking for is the
[1:11:54] body change that the word of God is
[1:11:56] going to
[1:11:58] produce because any other one is going
[1:12:01] to put anybody else into a dimension
[1:12:04] that they're not going to want to be
[1:12:11] in amen I can assure you that Jesus or
[1:12:14] the word didn't pertain it in that way
[1:12:18] how it actually really is interpreted is
[1:12:21] for as he thinketh in his heart meaning
[1:12:23] that if he's an attribute of God and in
[1:12:26] his heart is the word of God and that
[1:12:30] word was placed there from before the
[1:12:32] foundations of the world you can never
[1:12:34] not believe disbelieve the
[1:12:37] word you're an attribute of God from
[1:12:39] before the foundations of the world you
[1:12:42] were ordained to eternal life before you
[1:12:45] came into this temporal
[1:12:48] life Hallelujah that's the person that
[1:12:53] you really are yes
[1:12:55] as I think in my heart I
[1:12:59] am according to the word of
[1:13:03] God glory to God Amen and so
[1:13:07] here it's not so
[1:13:10] much dealing with this human life when
[1:13:13] it comes to the spiritual things it's
[1:13:15] about eternal life this is what we're
[1:13:18] dealing with and the and the true you is
[1:13:22] who you were before you came to this
[1:13:25] Dimension that's right that's the real
[1:13:27] you your soul your attribute your part
[1:13:32] of
[1:13:35] God Amen so as we move along here we go
[1:13:38] down to Proverbs 23 uh verse 23 to 26
[1:13:43] and watch what he says here he says by
[1:13:45] the
[1:13:45] truth he says by the truth by buy it you
[1:13:50] know like whatever you can do purchase
[1:13:52] it if you you know he's saying if if if
[1:13:55] it's possible and sell it not you know
[1:13:58] he's just using a thing also wisdom and
[1:14:01] instruction and understanding the father
[1:14:05] of the righteous shall greatly
[1:14:07] rejoice and he that Beth a wise child
[1:14:10] shall have joy of him thy father and thy
[1:14:14] mother shall be glad and she that bear
[1:14:17] thee shall rejoice my son and here's
[1:14:20] where he says my son give me thine heart
[1:14:28] that's what will please the
[1:14:29] Lord that's what will will will will
[1:14:32] bring joy that's why when when we were
[1:14:34] talking about you know a a a merry heart
[1:14:38] is good medicine and a broken Spirit dth
[1:14:41] up the bones because we know that God's
[1:14:45] God's strength is in his joy for
[1:14:48] us when God is rejoicing over us he just
[1:14:53] pours in strength
[1:14:55] he just pours in blessing he just pours
[1:14:58] in all that we have need of all of a
[1:15:01] sudden here in this life we're we're
[1:15:03] getting Victory after Victory listen
[1:15:06] you're a son and daughter of God there's
[1:15:08] nothing that could ever change that if
[1:15:10] you're a Son of God there's nothing that
[1:15:12] could ever change it you you you you
[1:15:14] can't be lost but you can live a
[1:15:17] miserable
[1:15:18] life you can choose how you want to
[1:15:21] serve the Lord you can decide how you
[1:15:24] want to waste away in this life because
[1:15:27] the revelation of who you are that can
[1:15:30] never be removed the Gates of Hell
[1:15:32] cannot Prevail against it but it's up to
[1:15:35] you to apply the word of God to believe
[1:15:37] God's word to believe all the things
[1:15:40] that that he says and let Thine Eyes
[1:15:42] observe my ways he says here in verse 23
[1:15:45] give me your heart and let Thine Eyes
[1:15:47] observe my ways listen without the Lord
[1:15:50] our ways will go astray and Away amen
[1:15:54] it's as simple as that
[1:15:55] and that's why he's come to search our
[1:15:57] hearts to see who you really
[1:16:01] are amen praise God let's go to the
[1:16:05] next scripture here in
[1:16:08] Jeremiah because we're we're going to
[1:16:10] search our hearts this morning is that
[1:16:11] okay amen we're going to we're going to
[1:16:14] do like you know the heart of a deceit
[1:16:16] uh the heart is
[1:16:18] deceitful remember that you know when
[1:16:21] when we're talking about the human heart
[1:16:22] here and we're talking about human
[1:16:25] mental memories and and and things that
[1:16:28] that that we've experienced from our
[1:16:30] from our human uh experience here on
[1:16:32] Earth and the bad memories and the bad
[1:16:34] experiences and all those things all
[1:16:36] those things they they they can deceive
[1:16:39] us and desperate and it's desperately
[1:16:42] wicked who can know it I the Lord search
[1:16:48] the heart I can go deep into your heart
[1:16:51] and I can try the Reigns
[1:16:54] I canest you even to give every man
[1:16:58] according to his ways and according to
[1:17:00] the fruit of his
[1:17:02] doings only God he's the only one that
[1:17:07] deals in our lives as Sons and Daughters
[1:17:10] of
[1:17:12] God and he knows exactly where you're at
[1:17:15] he knows where your thinking is he knows
[1:17:19] what you're you're focused on you know
[1:17:21] there's there's a saying that says that
[1:17:23] where your treasure is that's where your
[1:17:25] heart
[1:17:27] is we need to check where our thoughts
[1:17:30] are
[1:17:31] continually in this
[1:17:34] life what is our mind constantly on
[1:17:36] money money
[1:17:38] money beauty beauty
[1:17:40] beauty I got to look younger I got to
[1:17:43] make myself feel younger I got to look
[1:17:45] younger is that where our thoughts
[1:17:48] are because where your treasure is
[1:17:50] that's where your heart's going to
[1:17:52] be but God says give me your heart
[1:17:56] that's why Solomon said here don't don't
[1:17:58] be don't be getting too focused on all
[1:18:00] these things and all the things of this
[1:18:02] world because they're all going to fade
[1:18:04] away and they are fading away they're
[1:18:06] fading away right before our very eyes
[1:18:09] the people don't know it they think all
[1:18:11] these riches and all these things and
[1:18:14] the stock markets being so high and and
[1:18:16] and real estate prices being so high and
[1:18:19] all of these things and they're thinking
[1:18:20] that the world's just going to go on and
[1:18:22] it's just going to keep getting better
[1:18:23] and better and better I can show you in
[1:18:25] the scripture that there would be a time
[1:18:28] like we said that the world would be so
[1:18:31] rich and in need of
[1:18:34] nothing but he says come unto
[1:18:37] me come unto me and buy my wisdom and my
[1:18:42] my faith give yourself in other words
[1:18:44] buying means surrendering giving up
[1:18:47] you're giving up something God's not
[1:18:49] going to want your money God wants your
[1:18:52] spirit God wants your your will God
[1:18:55] wants your desires to be for him and not
[1:18:58] the things of the
[1:19:01] world
[1:19:03] Amen and so the word heart here in
[1:19:07] Jeremiah is talking about in Hebrew it's
[1:19:10] it's the word
[1:19:11] Leb which is considered the center of
[1:19:15] everything it's where everything happens
[1:19:18] in your life it's where you're you you
[1:19:20] don't realize it but it's you know like
[1:19:22] just take a person and let them be
[1:19:25] brokenhearted from A Love Affair and
[1:19:28] their whole world can collapse around
[1:19:30] them they'll want to commit suicide
[1:19:33] sometimes oh he left me she left me I
[1:19:36] can't live without them and right away
[1:19:38] their whole world collapses around them
[1:19:40] because it's the focal point it's the
[1:19:42] center of everything including thoughts
[1:19:45] it's used figuratively often for human
[1:19:48] feelings the will and even the intellect
[1:19:54] but listen
[1:19:55] here brother brandom's speaking here in
[1:19:58] Revelation 1961 chapter 2 he says but
[1:20:02] the nature of this man's spirit is evil
[1:20:06] now he's talking
[1:20:07] about different Natures here and the
[1:20:11] nature of this man's spirit is good he's
[1:20:13] talking about two
[1:20:14] individuals so see the nature of the
[1:20:17] spirit is the soul of the
[1:20:20] man so the nature is the soul of the
[1:20:26] individual so now God is trying to get
[1:20:30] into that into what the spirit and heart
[1:20:35] of
[1:20:36] man that's where God wants to Reign
[1:20:40] that's his throne in our
[1:20:42] lives not talking about the physical
[1:20:44] heart here I hope you you're you're
[1:20:47] you're you're you're you're you're
[1:20:48] moving in the in the spirit realm right
[1:20:51] now because our hearts these physical
[1:20:53] hearts are not
[1:20:55] not what what what he's talking about
[1:20:58] here he's talking about the actual
[1:21:00] person the attribute that you are the
[1:21:02] real person that you are he says the
[1:21:05] spirit and heart of man where the spirit
[1:21:08] lays in the heart now physically yes
[1:21:13] they've proven that there is a space in
[1:21:16] your
[1:21:16] heart and that's where life
[1:21:20] emanates and so there is an attribute of
[1:21:24] God that's in you and around you at all
[1:21:29] times and so he says here you know and
[1:21:32] science as I never finished that that
[1:21:35] man couldn't think with his heart and
[1:21:37] science to begin to find out that
[1:21:41] there's a little compartment there it is
[1:21:43] in the human heart not in animal heart
[1:21:46] but in the human heart there's not even
[1:21:49] a blood cell nor nothing they said it
[1:21:52] must be the place where the Soul
[1:21:55] occupies or the spirit just just let
[1:22:00] them alone they'll take their own silly
[1:22:02] things and prove
[1:22:06] God that's right God just makes the
[1:22:09] foolish testify of him now there it is
[1:22:13] Big headlines in the paper brother
[1:22:14] Bose's little girl said brother brandom
[1:22:17] you know what you was saying the other
[1:22:19] day said look look science has already
[1:22:21] found out said well bless God I want
[1:22:24] that sister I want I want that the soul
[1:22:26] of man is the nature of the spirit and
[1:22:30] the spirit dwells in the heart of
[1:22:34] man there's something in us there's life
[1:22:38] within us and when we give up the life
[1:22:41] when we give up the the the the life
[1:22:43] here on this Dimension that that life it
[1:22:47] moves on to another
[1:22:49] body
[1:22:50] amen and he goes on to say here and he
[1:22:52] says and then when this little angel
[1:22:55] comes into the body now pay attention
[1:22:58] that's a little angel of the earth a
[1:23:01] spirit that's ordained of God to take
[1:23:03] this body then that baby has to have a
[1:23:07] choice it makes its decision then when
[1:23:10] this takes place then you see the angel
[1:23:13] of the Lord now comes in here which is a
[1:23:16] spiritual body that
[1:23:19] Eternal so he's talking about how the
[1:23:22] attribute of God comes into us
[1:23:25] when we come into this Dimension
[1:23:29] here this is a dying spirit in a dying
[1:23:33] body but now you can't be in two bodies
[1:23:36] at one time but there can be two Natures
[1:23:39] in you at one time and that's why
[1:23:41] there's a struggle and that's why
[1:23:43] brother Braham said the greatest battle
[1:23:45] that you're going to fight is going to
[1:23:47] be right between your
[1:23:49] ears and it's constantly looking to
[1:23:52] possess your heart to try and reign in
[1:23:55] your heart to try and become the the the
[1:23:58] absolute in your
[1:24:00] heart so he says here he says now the
[1:24:04] nature of the spirit of the Lord when
[1:24:06] you're born again you're not born a
[1:24:09] physical but the baby was but what
[1:24:12] happened the spiritual Birth has come to
[1:24:17] you and while this spiritual birth is
[1:24:19] growing into your heart of God this
[1:24:23] spirit of God that God places into your
[1:24:26] heart as it grows and and and develops
[1:24:30] by the revelation of the word to come to
[1:24:33] know God and to to to to believe the
[1:24:36] word and make it the absolute in your
[1:24:38] life okay of God there is a physical or
[1:24:43] Celestial body growing to receive that
[1:24:47] spirit and when the life leaves this
[1:24:49] body it goes to that body just as when
[1:24:52] the body is presented to the Earth the
[1:24:55] spirit comes in when the spirit goes out
[1:24:58] of the body there is a body waiting so
[1:25:01] if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved
[1:25:04] there's another one that's waiting on
[1:25:07] this one amen praise God for we know
[1:25:10] that after this Earthly Tabernacle be
[1:25:13] dissolved we have one already
[1:25:16] waiting and so let's go to the next
[1:25:18] scripture
[1:25:20] here in Matthew
[1:25:22] 13 or sorry in Matthew Matthew no it's
[1:25:25] not here actually wait I got it
[1:25:28] here so we need to understand that that
[1:25:31] from our heart
[1:25:33] predes what's really in you who you
[1:25:37] really are is what you're going to
[1:25:38] express by their fruits you're going to
[1:25:40] know them by the way you communicate by
[1:25:42] the way you live by the way you express
[1:25:44] yourself people are going to know
[1:25:46] whether you are a True Believer or
[1:25:49] not he says but those things which
[1:25:51] proceed out of the mouth come forth from
[1:25:53] the heart
[1:25:54] and they defile the man for out of the
[1:25:57] heart proceed evil thoughts murders
[1:26:00] adulteries fornications theft false
[1:26:03] witness blasphemies these are things
[1:26:06] which defile a man so if there's a
[1:26:09] corrupt heart in there those are the
[1:26:11] things that it's going to
[1:26:13] communicate those are the communications
[1:26:15] those are the things that it's going to
[1:26:17] lust after and desire after but in Mark
[1:26:20] 11 it says for verily I say unto you
[1:26:22] that whosoever shall say unto to this
[1:26:24] mountain be thou removed and be thou
[1:26:27] cast into the sea and shall not doubt in
[1:26:30] the
[1:26:31] heart have no doubt whatsoever but Shall
[1:26:34] Believe those things which he saith
[1:26:37] shall come to pass he shall have
[1:26:40] whatsoever he
[1:26:42] saith and in Matthew 13: 19 when anyone
[1:26:47] heareth the word of the
[1:26:50] kingdom and understandeth it
[1:26:53] not then cometh the wicked one and
[1:26:57] catcheth away that which was sown in his
[1:27:00] heart so without
[1:27:02] Revelation you can't live this word you
[1:27:05] can't manifest God you can't be
[1:27:08] represented in the body of Christ that's
[1:27:11] going to take the
[1:27:12] Rapture because you need the heart of
[1:27:15] God you need you need the Revelation to
[1:27:17] believe the word of God you've got to be
[1:27:20] like the Virgin Mary that can say be it
[1:27:23] unto me according to to Thy word and
[1:27:25] everything comes subject to
[1:27:28] that so A word without revelation will
[1:27:31] never stand against the enemy
[1:27:35] never in Proverbs 18:12 it says Before
[1:27:39] Destruction the heart of man is Hottie
[1:27:42] and before honor is
[1:27:45] humility you're not going to do it on
[1:27:47] your
[1:27:49] own God is looking at the heart and God
[1:27:51] is looking at the humility that is being
[1:27:54] being produced from your
[1:27:56] heart we're still laying in a foundation
[1:28:00] here listen here about those those those
[1:28:04] two Natures that are in Us in the
[1:28:06] questions and answers uh brother
[1:28:08] brandham was asked about these natures
[1:28:12] and he says and isn't that just the way
[1:28:14] the people get
[1:28:16] today let God just bless a fellow and
[1:28:19] put a little confidence in him and he
[1:28:21] gets to be a know it all
[1:28:24] God wants to bless God wants to prosper
[1:28:26] God wants to give us a a perfect heart
[1:28:29] but we can't allow it to take control
[1:28:31] and to make us hoty and
[1:28:34] high-minded he's got to start an
[1:28:36] organization or he's got to do something
[1:28:38] that's different why art thou fallen
[1:28:41] from Heaven old Lucifer God has a hard
[1:28:44] time trying to get to somebody that he
[1:28:46] can deal with that'll stay humble and
[1:28:49] meek and stay in the place until God
[1:28:52] calls him to do something
[1:28:54] you believe that a man that God can
[1:28:57] bless and he'll still keep himself a man
[1:29:02] not be an angel or a God as soon as a
[1:29:05] man gets blessed and has a little
[1:29:07] something given to him he wants to
[1:29:08] become a God he wants to become an angel
[1:29:12] he wants to become some great person
[1:29:15] what I do what me and me and mine all
[1:29:18] that that's the wrong
[1:29:21] attitude God's hunting for somebody who
[1:29:24] he can bless and pour out the blessings
[1:29:27] and more he blessed the little the the
[1:29:30] little the man will become and you'll
[1:29:33] never get more of God until you become
[1:29:37] nothing you've got to belittle yourself
[1:29:40] he that will exalt himself God will
[1:29:42] bring a base he that will humble himself
[1:29:44] God will exalt you've got to get little
[1:29:48] before you can get
[1:29:50] big amen and you'll never get be bigger
[1:29:54] in your own self you'll only be as big
[1:29:56] as God will be be big in you Hallelujah
[1:30:01] you can never be more than what God
[1:30:03] wants you to
[1:30:04] be God wants your heart he doesn't want
[1:30:08] your
[1:30:09] pride he doesn't want you to come with
[1:30:11] all your abilities God places gifts in
[1:30:15] the individuals and God will use those
[1:30:17] gifts when he needs to use those gifts
[1:30:20] we got to be ready to allow him to use
[1:30:23] us
[1:30:24] in whatever aspect in whatever way he
[1:30:26] wants to use us we just got to be
[1:30:28] willing to surrender unto him amen
[1:30:32] you'll you'll you will be an expression
[1:30:34] of the word if you are a gene of God
[1:30:38] from before the foundations of the
[1:30:40] world you'll be exactly what he made you
[1:30:43] to be and he wants you to Just Surrender
[1:30:46] yourself to be
[1:30:50] that listen we make mistakes
[1:30:54] everybody makes
[1:30:56] mistakes but we got to have the right
[1:30:58] kind of heart God's looking you know
[1:31:00] he's dealing with our heart right now
[1:31:01] when it comes to humility and pride and
[1:31:03] and and and you know you know we can
[1:31:05] draw a great example from Psalms
[1:31:09] 51 where David you know he had just been
[1:31:12] you know Nathan the prophet comes in
[1:31:14] unto him after he had gone to and taken
[1:31:16] Beth Sheba committed adultery killed her
[1:31:21] husband and and and done things that
[1:31:24] were complete Abomination to God Nathan
[1:31:27] comes in and tells him what he's done
[1:31:29] but I want you to notice David if you
[1:31:33] compare you know like we don't got time
[1:31:34] to go into the full comparisons between
[1:31:36] Saul and David but we're talking about
[1:31:39] two different Hearts Saul he gets caught
[1:31:42] disobeying God and he's putting every
[1:31:45] excuse he can blaming the people PA was
[1:31:49] saying but you know the Samuel comes in
[1:31:52] and says Saul did I not tell you to take
[1:31:53] take out every everything man woman
[1:31:56] child of that Village that had to be
[1:31:58] destroyed because they were all wicked
[1:32:00] and evil right down to the very animals
[1:32:02] and he turns around and says oh yeah but
[1:32:04] you know what the the the some of the uh
[1:32:07] generals they took some of the you know
[1:32:09] the the the better-looking uh uh cows
[1:32:12] and and calfs because you know they're
[1:32:14] going to use them as sacrifices unto the
[1:32:16] Lord they were
[1:32:18] perfect no God said
[1:32:21] everything when you're gonna kick a
[1:32:25] demon out of your home or out of your
[1:32:28] village or out of your life you got to
[1:32:31] take its head off amen and every one of
[1:32:34] its little children that come with it
[1:32:37] that'll keep coming around and pulling
[1:32:39] on your leg and saying oh please please
[1:32:42] come back no
[1:32:45] out get rid of every single one and Saul
[1:32:49] he was rebellious he had a rebellious
[1:32:52] heart he couldn't what was it he wasn't
[1:32:55] able to submit and Obey and even come to
[1:32:58] a place where he could repent properly
[1:33:00] he says oh I've sin before the Lord can
[1:33:02] you just you know make a sacrifice and
[1:33:05] and and get me you know CU you know he
[1:33:07] would say I don't want to be shamed
[1:33:09] before the people so you need to like
[1:33:11] you know do a sacrifice for me and and
[1:33:13] and restore me back you know before the
[1:33:16] people so that you can stand next to
[1:33:19] me he had a rebellious Spirit but look
[1:33:23] at how David responded and we need to we
[1:33:26] need to learn something from this
[1:33:28] because like I said there's none of you
[1:33:29] that's
[1:33:30] perfect we're going to make mistakes
[1:33:33] we're going to do things that we're
[1:33:34] going to that we're going to be
[1:33:35] disappointed and and you know the enemy
[1:33:37] is going to try and come and he's going
[1:33:39] to try and and pound you with
[1:33:41] condemnation and all those things but
[1:33:44] there is no condemnation to them that
[1:33:46] are in
[1:33:48] Christ they've come into the word
[1:33:50] they've accepted the word of the Lord
[1:33:52] for their day
[1:33:54] yes and listen what he says here have
[1:33:58] mercy on me in in verse uh one of of uh
[1:34:02] Psalms 51 have mercy upon me oh God
[1:34:05] according to thy loving kindness
[1:34:07] according unto the multitude of thy
[1:34:09] Tender Mercies blot out my transgression
[1:34:12] he's asking for for for his
[1:34:14] transgressions to be blotted out Wash Me
[1:34:17] thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse
[1:34:20] me from my sin for I acknowledge my
[1:34:25] transgressions and my sin is ever before
[1:34:29] me listen what he says against thee and
[1:34:32] thee only have I
[1:34:34] sinned you see he got to a place where
[1:34:37] he knew that he was naked before God and
[1:34:39] unless we come to that relationship with
[1:34:41] God you can hide things from your
[1:34:44] brothers and your sisters you can say
[1:34:47] things and you can you can put a little
[1:34:49] twist to them to make it sound like this
[1:34:51] or make it sound like that but God
[1:34:54] he's he's hearing you and he's reading
[1:34:56] your heart he's he's testing your heart
[1:34:59] he's searching your heart he's looking
[1:35:02] deep within and and here David he was he
[1:35:05] was able to to stand and say only
[1:35:08] against thee have I sinned and done this
[1:35:10] evil in thy sight that thou mightest be
[1:35:13] justified when thou speakest and be
[1:35:15] clear when thou judgest in other words
[1:35:17] Lord I deserve whatever you're going to
[1:35:19] give me
[1:35:23] every single one of you
[1:35:27] deserve to be to be to to to to
[1:35:31] receive the punishment that comes from
[1:35:34] unbelief everybody out there the Bible
[1:35:36] says a man sins a man's going to die
[1:35:40] it's as simple as
[1:35:41] that but blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:35:44] that he's offered us this this redeeming
[1:35:48] blood he's saying hey hey come here give
[1:35:51] me your heart he says if you give me
[1:35:53] your heart and you surrender yourself
[1:35:55] completely unto me you'll be as white as
[1:35:58] snow as though you never done it in the
[1:35:59] first place he says I'll take your sin
[1:36:02] and I'll place it into the sea of my
[1:36:04] forgetfulness never to bring it up no
[1:36:06] more amen hallelujah this is the god
[1:36:10] that we want to
[1:36:13] serve this is what the world is missing
[1:36:16] out there they don't realize this
[1:36:18] message is the message of
[1:36:20] Salvation it's the only message of
[1:36:22] salvation amen amen glory to God he goes
[1:36:28] he goes on and he says behold I was
[1:36:29] shapen in iniquity and in sin did my
[1:36:33] mother conceive
[1:36:34] me now his mother never did anything
[1:36:37] wrong what was it that his mother did
[1:36:40] that was so
[1:36:42] wrong because he he had a revelation yes
[1:36:45] of what took back took place back in the
[1:36:48] Garden of Eden that's right because it
[1:36:50] was Eve that sinned and it was Eve that
[1:36:53] went to be with with with the with the
[1:36:56] serpent right because she wanted to
[1:36:58] bring forth children yeah he convinced
[1:37:02] her hey you can be like God you can be a
[1:37:04] Creator like
[1:37:05] God and we can do it this
[1:37:09] way God knew exactly what was going to
[1:37:13] happen but here David had a revelation
[1:37:16] that he was conceived in sin and you and
[1:37:20] I were all born in sin so don't be
[1:37:22] thinking oh I did this wrong I did that
[1:37:24] wrong no all sin was taken to the cross
[1:37:28] with Jesus Christ all
[1:37:31] sin and you can be restored you can be
[1:37:35] you you can be uh Justified as though
[1:37:37] you've never done it in the first place
[1:37:39] and walk with God and have a Victorious
[1:37:44] life
[1:37:46] amen behold thou desirest truth in the
[1:37:50] inward
[1:37:51] parts and in the part Thou shalt make me
[1:37:55] to know wisdom Purge me with hisab and I
[1:37:58] shall be clean wash me and I shall be

[1:38:04] gladness that the bones which thou has
[1:38:08] broken May

[1:38:17] iniquities and then he goes create in me
[1:38:23] a clean
[1:38:26] heart take all that
[1:38:29] pain take away all that shame take away

[1:39:24] what an hour Saints this is going to be
[1:39:26] the most deceiving
[1:39:29] hour go to the next
[1:39:31] scripture notice
[1:39:34] here from
[1:39:37] this people's heart is waxed gross and
[1:39:41] their ears are dull of hearing and their
[1:39:45] eyes they have closed lest at any time
[1:39:48] they should see with their eyes and hear
[1:39:51] with their ears and should understand
[1:39:53] with their heart and should be converted
[1:39:56] and I should heal them but blessed are
[1:39:58] your eyes for they see and your ears for
[1:40:01] they hear you know that there's people
[1:40:04] that that that that have that have
[1:40:06] allowed their their their hearts to wax
[1:40:09] gross in other words they've heard so
[1:40:13] much about the gospel they've heard so
[1:40:15] much about Jesus Christ they've heard it
[1:40:19] from this denominational perspective
[1:40:21] they've heard it from that
[1:40:22] denominational perspective they've heard
[1:40:24] it from New Age teaching they've heard
[1:40:26] it through Buddha they've heard about
[1:40:28] this they've heard about that that
[1:40:30] they've gotten to a place where the
[1:40:32] people's hearts have waxed gross in
[1:40:34] other words they just don't even want to
[1:40:36] bother
[1:40:37] anymore that's a dangerous condition to
[1:40:40] get
[1:40:42] into it's a very dangerous place that
[1:40:45] when you get you've heard all the quotes
[1:40:48] you've heard so many of the quotes
[1:40:49] you've heard so much of the message
[1:40:51] you've heard this this teaching you've
[1:40:54] heard about that teaching you've heard
[1:40:56] about Brandon you know branhamites
[1:40:58] you've heard about the seven Thunder
[1:40:59] Doctrine you've heard that the seals are
[1:41:01] not open you've heard the seals are open
[1:41:03] that you've gotten to a place where all
[1:41:05] you do is you're just a church member as
[1:41:07] long as I belong to a message church
[1:41:09] that's going to be good enough and
[1:41:11] that's going to get me in the
[1:41:13] Rapture be
[1:41:16] careful that you don't get so complacent
[1:41:18] that your heart becomes waxed over that
[1:41:22] when the Holy Spirit now in the present
[1:41:25] stage of his ministry where he is
[1:41:27] speaking through a five-fold Ministry
[1:41:29] where he wants to speak directly to the
[1:41:31] hearts of the people and bring them out
[1:41:34] of all of the confusion because there's
[1:41:36] two spirits that are operating in the
[1:41:38] church at all times brother Bram says
[1:41:40] every Revival brings forth two
[1:41:44] Spirits the true and the false Vine amen
[1:41:48] and it's still operating and it will
[1:41:51] still continue to operate and it'll move
[1:41:53] move into this message and has already
[1:41:56] moved into this message and it's causing
[1:41:58] a lot of Confusion And A lot of people
[1:42:00] are just falling away because their
[1:42:03] hearts have grossed have waxed gross
[1:42:07] they've hardened themselves
[1:42:09] against the message and the
[1:42:12] word they're hooking up with those that
[1:42:14] are denying the cloud now well I don't
[1:42:17] know you know like did it really
[1:42:21] happen you see if if the heart is the
[1:42:25] Lord's heart and in there is the
[1:42:27] attribute of
[1:42:29] God it's already been given to the
[1:42:32] Lord there's nothing that can turn you
[1:42:35] away from this there's nothing that can
[1:42:38] change you and and and and and move you
[1:42:40] away from what God has revealed to you
[1:42:42] the Gates of Hell will not Prevail and
[1:42:45] you will you'll be sensitive to the
[1:42:47] spirit you'll be listening for the word
[1:42:50] you won't be caught into the confusion
[1:42:52] you won't be Dr away they're arguing
[1:42:54] with one another there's there's literal
[1:42:56] online online you know sword fights
[1:42:59] going on between people One Believes
[1:43:01] this in the message one believes that in
[1:43:03] the message there's confusion but that's
[1:43:05] the job of the enemy to bring
[1:43:09] confusion stay away from all of
[1:43:12] it you might have one little thing you
[1:43:15] wanted the Lord inspires you to make one
[1:43:17] statement or say one thing it'll if it's
[1:43:19] the Lord otherwise just leave it alone
[1:43:26] Hallelujah we don't want to be
[1:43:30] religious religious is is is uh uh you
[1:43:34] know a counterfeit Spirit that's what
[1:43:36] you know religion is a covering that's
[1:43:39] what religion is people are taking this
[1:43:42] message and they're making their own
[1:43:44] coverings they've got their own filters
[1:43:46] now that they filter everything through
[1:43:48] well if you don't say it exactly the way
[1:43:50] the prophet said it you're wrong
[1:43:53] never mind if you got a revelation of
[1:43:55] what the prophet said no we're not
[1:43:56] interested in your own interpretation
[1:43:58] they'll
[1:43:59] say that's your
[1:44:01] interpretation you'll know if it's you
[1:44:05] know if if if if you're an attribute of
[1:44:08] God you can't be deceived Amen period
[1:44:11] and you'll just know when you hear
[1:44:13] you'll know whether it's truth or
[1:44:16] error unless you get into a hardened
[1:44:19] condition you can be a son or a daughter
[1:44:22] of God that gets into a Harden condition
[1:44:23] where you just you pull back you don't
[1:44:26] want to serve God the way that you used
[1:44:28] to serve God you you're not willing to
[1:44:30] give your you're all you're not willing
[1:44:32] to fully surrender everything completely
[1:44:34] to him and you can get into a state Like
[1:44:38] an Eagle when it gets into a state you
[1:44:40] know where all of a sudden it's got to
[1:44:42] it's going to be smashing his head
[1:44:43] against the ground because it's gotten
[1:44:45] all crusted over because it it's allowed
[1:44:48] the trials of this life and and the
[1:44:50] snares of the enemy and all the the
[1:44:52] battles and all the mind battles to to
[1:44:54] to to put a cloud around your life get
[1:44:56] out of it come out of that condition and
[1:45:00] let the Holy Spirit move into your life
[1:45:02] amen glory to God
[1:45:05] listen in a thinking's man a thinking
[1:45:07] man's filter I believe it's up there you
[1:45:09] can put it up notice that word cannot
[1:45:12] deny itself if the word is in you it
[1:45:16] will it it'll just amen the word of God
[1:45:19] period it can never go against the word
[1:45:22] so that'll be one way if somebody says
[1:45:24] to you hey you know because remember if
[1:45:26] you get into that Harden condition like
[1:45:28] Jesus was talking about that they don't
[1:45:29] even want to hear that's what he meant
[1:45:31] by that they'll hear it but they'll just
[1:45:34] I don't want to hear it oh you're too
[1:45:37] religious they'll see the evidence of
[1:45:39] Miracles even and they'll say ah that
[1:45:43] was just you know they got lucky what do
[1:45:44] you
[1:45:46] want I hear people you know they get
[1:45:48] cancer and then they get they go to the
[1:45:50] doctor and they don't got it anymore and
[1:45:51] they're not even going to church
[1:45:54] it's
[1:45:55] true it's
[1:45:57] true but it's not about healing
[1:46:01] cancer it's not about healing the cancer
[1:46:04] it's about it's about your
[1:46:06] soul it's about whether you've
[1:46:09] got identification with Jesus Christ the
[1:46:12] word whether you can surrender yourself
[1:46:14] to the word of God and and and not allow
[1:46:16] the word to to to uh you know get you in
[1:46:20] a in in a in a mean mad condition where
[1:46:23] you're going to walk
[1:46:25] away that is he goes on here he says
[1:46:29] then it is satisfied or it's the desire
[1:46:32] it's a desire of what what made you
[1:46:35] desire it in the first place he's
[1:46:37] talking about the word what made you
[1:46:39] desire the word in the first place what
[1:46:41] what is it that Drew you to this
[1:46:43] Revelation in the first place that
[1:46:44] brought you into this
[1:46:47] ministry amen because down in your soul
[1:46:50] there was a predestinated seed which was
[1:46:53] eternal life always laying in
[1:46:57] there always was in
[1:47:00] there all that the father hath given me
[1:47:03] will come there isn't any of them that's
[1:47:05] going to be lost a thinking man's taste
[1:47:08] when a thinking man hears the word of
[1:47:10] God my sheep hear my voice a stranger
[1:47:14] they will not follow for down in there
[1:47:17] is life and life connects with life sin
[1:47:22] connects with sin and sin is so
[1:47:24] hypocritical until it thinks that it's
[1:47:27] saved when it isn't
[1:47:30] saved it's in the very depths of
[1:47:34] hypocrisy church members want a
[1:47:36] denominational filter so that they can
[1:47:39] have their own desire and still be
[1:47:41] classed religious people you hear them
[1:47:43] say oh he's very religious don't look at
[1:47:46] this as the denominations out there look
[1:47:48] at it as it right within the message
[1:47:50] here now
[1:47:53] people with religious
[1:47:59] Spirits I got a lot here now this is
[1:48:01] where it's starting to get really
[1:48:03] good but I'm looking at my time here and
[1:48:06] there's just no way that we're going to
[1:48:08] be able to get to to to go into all of
[1:48:10] this but we're going to be looking at
[1:48:12] Jacob and
[1:48:14] Esau within the
[1:48:16] confines of Papa's Church
[1:48:20] Isaac one born the Lord says I love
[1:48:23] Jacob let the musicians
[1:48:25] come and the other one says Jacob I love
[1:48:29] but the other one I
[1:48:33] hate oh we're going to look at all of
[1:48:35] that next week we're going to go a
[1:48:37] little deeper into our hearts we're
[1:48:38] going to see where we stand where we are
[1:48:41] right now in the midst of the message of
[1:48:44] this hour where people are Falling
[1:48:47] Away people are going to walk away from
[1:48:50] this message and it is the only message
[1:48:52] that brings
[1:48:53] life it's the only one that really truly
[1:48:57] is going to translate us
[1:48:59] out are you going to be able to stand
[1:49:02] right to the very
[1:49:03] end that'll be the test that'll be the
[1:49:07] greatest
