even now you know my my body and that stuff so uh just pray for me amen but I know I'm stepping out in faith and by faith and uh to take the word of God that God has given me tonight amen the devil ain't going to stop it Hallelujah the devil ain't going to stop if you have faith tonight the devil ain't going to stop you from receiving what he has for you amen I have nothing for you but the Holy Ghost has something for you amen because he promised that he promised to every son and daughter of God hallelujah that he would feed you amen he would not for forsake you hallelujah amen we want to continue on the uh the series The Power of tradition part seven we want to talk about um perverting the unity of perfect Faith Hallelujah I know it's uh but I'm just moving along in this this series here you know bringing it right from you know the the the the Pharisees and sagues bringing right back from Moses the law right right into Jesus right into the Dark Ages right into you know Luther Wesley right into Pentecost right into the message this is where it has to come this is you know Satan is always going to fight and be closer to the light not the darkness because he is Darkness so he's going to be right here to fight the children of God but God has promised to give us a word amen that would raise a standard above the enemy and all the lies and deception the next the next uh next part eight we're going to be preaching and getting into it a little bit more on the pale horse rider and you're going to see how all these tie in together of what I've been speaking about hallelujah amen let us go to Isaiah 59:19 Hallelujah you didn't pray for me today because you didn't know I was ministering as I pray for you you pray for me we're all in this together amen it's not just me by myself here hallelujah I'm going to bring the word as God has given to me but I need you I need Faith to pull on it amen we together create at something powerful amen and victory comes through that Hallelujah not just the minister so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift a standard against him and we know brother brandham said when the enemy comes in as a flood in your life God will make his word more real to you oh yes that's what we want more than all the gifts and the signs and the Wonders we want in this hour that word to become real to us hallelujah because that's the only way we're going to overcome in this most wicked age that we're living in and the Redeemer shall come to Zion and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob sayeth the Lord as for me this is my Covenant with them sayeth the Lord my spirit that is upon thee and my words which I have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of thy mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seed seed sayeth the Lord from henceforth and forever more H Allelujah let's go to John 8:32 we can see the Lord here showing predestination showing election showing that he's placed the seed in every one of his children hallelujah hallelujah John 8:32 and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free they answered him we be Abraham's seed we were never inod to any man how sayest thou you shall make us free Jesus answered verily verily I say unto you whosoever committed sin is the servant of sin just think about it they are the people back there supposedly the people of God believing the prophet Moses's message and living it to a tea and saying and Jesus comes along the revealed word of the hour comes along and says you are living in sin and committ in sin and you need to be set free listen my brothers and sisters we come here tonight to be set free by the word of God Amen we are constantly being set free by his word and the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth if the son therefore shall make you free you you shall be free indeed I know that you are Abraham's seed I know you're in the message I know you're a Believer but you seek to kill me because my word had no place in you what do they seek to kill what are they going to seek to kill that's inside the Bride of Jesus Christ today the revealed word 2 Corinthians 2:10 Hallelujah Les Satan should get advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices H Allelujah because God has given us a prophet given us a word and now he has come down and he's revealing it to us personally those seals are being opened open to the Bride of Jesus Christ and as they're being open Hallelujah listen this is a battle this ain't all about joy happiness and you know praise God all the time and this is a battle this is between life and death Hallelujah that's what we're in and we need to be certain of God that's why brother brandom preached those messages greatest battle ever fought put on the whole armor of God and that's what we're here tonight amen may you be encouraged and strengthened Hallelujah let us pray father thank you for your love grace and mercy Lord I stand Here by faith father believing in you Lord and the people of God have come tonight Lord they have come hungry Lord and we know that let every man's word be a lie but your word to be truth tonight lord it's not the minister not the elders not the pastor but it's the Holy Ghost Lord Jesus that can only take the word not by might not by power but by your spirit Lord oh God ride on the word tonight Lord into the hearts of your people father we surrender ourselves to you father Place us under the blood hide us under the cross oh God from our weaknesses this flesh father the mistakes of our our of our day father the thoughts in our mind oh God bind every contrary Spirit father and every fiery Dart of the enemy Lord and Lord let the spirit of God had prance here tonight father so that we may leave rejoicing in Victory father in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you as you're seated hallelujah what a message we got amen glory to God what a message if this message has been really and is being really revealed to you oh my what a word of God we got hallelujah amen hallelujah you know you look at uh what I've been preaching on I don't want to get ahead of myself here what I've been preaching on here hallelujah talking about the Rapture age talking about the Eternal Church age talking about the LC in church age recognizing in in everything that we've been saying here that we are both in the leoan church age this flesh and we are also in the Eternal Church age or brother brandom called it the Rapture age or the Capstone age amen hallelujah you say brother Tim where do you where do you get that from well it's all all through the message if you go and study your message that God has given you in this hour but in John 3:9 Jesus himself demonstrated that and he said the son of man that you see standing here on Earth is also in heaven and I believe the Bride of Jesus Christ amen that is standing on the earth Hallelujah is also in heaven amen by the new birth she's been translated in this hour that's what the Rapture is all about amen she's not playing Church Hallelujah she's not playing religion amen she's got an experience of the new birth amen of the opening of those Seven Seals she's been birthed under that not other justification not under Luther sanctification or or the Pentecostal message amen she's been birthed under the revealed word opening up to her in this hour by who the Holy Ghost himself not by a prophet but by the Holy Ghost himself amen taking the word of God in this hour hallelujah amen glory to God and we understand that both in this message as a whole there's the Pentecostal message says it's here where the seals were breaking but they weren't open Hallelujah so there is revelation in this Pentecostal message that that people are feeding off of and that's what we've been talking about Allelujah people receiving a birth in this message receiving it under a Pentecostal message but also in this message is the opening of The Seven Seals and the birth is available and that's the only birth that's available in this hour Hallelujah that we can be birth under and that's what produces the real change in this hour Hallelujah glory to God Amen that's what we want to recognize my brothers and sister that's what's burning on my heart Hallelujah the deception I'm seeing that people are not being led to Christ in this hour in this message not being led to the New Birth the real genuine birth not pressing into the kingdom with violence not overcoming the things that they need to overcome listen this is a death this is a total death to yourself not any of us can live in ourselves and receive this new birth inside I'm talking about we know this flesh won't inherit the kingdom of God it'll always struggle it's that emity with God but inside there's got to be a total rebirth a total death inside desires motives intentions everything and you can't do it yourself you can't do it yourself you can't put this on all you can do is seek knock that's all the Bible says you can do if you feel the call of your god of in your heart then that's what you do you seek you knock Hallelujah but Satan comes and and and uses the message and the quotes and everything like that and comforts you saying you're okay you've gone far enough he doesn't want you to go all the way he doesn't want you to break through to get the new birth in this hour to see what's actually being revealed you know your conscience tells you there's something that you're not seeing there's something that's you're not recognizing you're not fellowshipping under the mystery of Christ Hallelujah that means you're under a strong delusion of Satan taking the word he didn't deny the word back in the Garden of Eden to he didn't say oh the word's not right he just perverted it the perverting of the unity of perfect faith in this hour Hallelujah the first step on our way to Victory is recognizing the devil the enemy the Bible says in Ephesians 612 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood we're still trying to understand that into deeper depths but against principalities against Powers against rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual spiritual wickedness spiritual in high places Hallelujah you see the battle is not with flesh and blood the battle is not even with false preachers false prophets and all these things it's against principalities Hallelujah spiritual wickedness demon powers same devil taking the word of God that he did in the Garden of Eden in this hour taking the message and that's where the people get deceived how can how can I be deceived if I got the message of the hour because I know he's a true Vindicated Prophet I know God Vindicated him I know the pillar of fire was with him I see the signs and wonders I see his life I can go on and on and on but that's the very thing that Satan will take take to try to distract you divert you deceive you bring you in a delusion I want you to arrive I'm sure you want me to arrive more and more that's what we're fighting for amen hallelujah now brother Brandon speaking here in the God of this evil age notice Satan is not calling the God of this any other age but this age he's called the god think about it it was his ambition to be like God from the very beginning Isaiah 14:12 Thou Art fallen from Heaven o Lucifer the son of the morning Thou Art cast down to the ground which did weaken the Nations for thou has said in thy heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the star stars of God I will exalt myself above the Sons and Daughters of God think about it where are the sons and daughters of God in this hour that's where Satan is trying to exalt himself above the Sons and Daughters of God above the true bride of Jesus Christ and I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the side of the North it was Satan's ambition to be worshiped like God he took two-thirds of the angels of the stars of Heaven of send it himself above those stars and preach to them and deceive two-thirds of them you see it all right notice that his ambition now he's ready with his careful selected educated bride by his own knowledge in this deceit of big buildings big denominations the knowledge the theology the smart the intellectual the educated to deceive the whole world and become a God that's what he has done in this hour listen he ain't stopping out there he's moving on there is one body one Spirit just also we called in one hope of your calling there is one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is over us all and through all Ephesians 4:6 this is God's inspired master plan for true unity in the body of Jesus Christ nothing else my brothers and sisters and if you break that down one calling one Lord One Faith one baptism yeah I know brother Tim but Lord Jesus help us to see amen the deception in it the Apostle Paul knew the importance of unity in the church he told the Philippians to make make my joy complete by being likeminded having the same love being one in one spirit and purpose doing nothing out of selfishness or selfish ambition or vain conceit but in humility consider others better than yourself not looking out for your own interests but also the interest of others Hallelujah Paul then shares that if you want to experience genuine Unity with one another the key is to reflect Jesus Christ not anything else but reflect him the word the revealed word of this hour and the only way you can reflect him is that if he's living inside of you through the new birth through the Awakening of the seed of God inside of you you Hallelujah be like him think like him and it starts with a heart attitude like him the character and quality that Paul points them towards is Jesus humility oh my it's hard to be humble it's hard to be humble you see nobody in here can be humble in themselves if it's not the grace of God we're always constantly being lifted up in Pride Hallelujah constantly battling these things but it's hard to be humble Hallelujah Paul says if you want Unity you need to have the same attitude Jesus did even though he was God in humility he emptied himself all the way to the Cross didn't didn't Paul say I Die daily it's not a one-time death is a death that is dying out to yourself on a daily basis is picking up your cross amen the cross is heavy sometimes the cross weighs us down sometimes problems situations get in our lives trials Temptations come our way why so that can bring us to a death can bring us to a state of dying daily a state of humility to be like Jesus Hallelujah you know that's is the is the simplest thing that but it's the most powerful thing that is in this message is the humility of the of of a prophet a life so simple and humble and people think it's easy to live that it's not easy to live that you got to go through hard things to live that hallelujah it's not the easier way hallelujah it's the harder way that we have to go and those who accept the hard way Hallelujah you hear what I'm saying those who accept the hard way those who receive the hard way those those who don't pray against the hard way in your life is those who receive it hallelujah amen glory to God [Music] hallelujah now let us go a little deeper in this perverting that is happening in this hour the seven Seal's opening and the revealing was the Capstone Ministry the calling the bride into perfect Faith perfect realization perfect understanding of who she is that is living behind the veil Hallelujah listen we can't preach a water down message gospel we can't preach a Pentecostal gospel that is not the message of the hour that is not the word that's being revealed in this hour that's not the word that's going to take a body change and change these bodies hallelujah it's a life we're preaching a life that is died surrendered a humility in our lives that causes us to live behind that Veil Hallelujah glory to God amen amen which is the Capstone which is Christ himself by the new birth in this hour the calstone age is rejected brother Brandon speaking here the whole age is rejected and who is living in the age is rejected too so we can see that every age when they receive their portion of word are you listening to me every age that receives their portion of a word is rejected oh my you see the delusion can you see and understand that how Satan is stopping this word in people's lives from moving forward by keeping them in a past age a past light feeding off of things of a past word and making them believe that they're okay that they're fine listen no preacher no person no husband no wife no mommy no Daddy can tell you that you're saved you're born again and you know that you know that you are it's you and God it's got to be revealed between you and God and you can't come no other way Pentecost is pentetic cost and everybody has got to come through the blood of Jesus Christ everybody's got to die out to themselves everybody's got to come the same way [Music] Hallelujah listen I want to be that that kind of preacher that you don't feel safe just because you're in the message J but you walk out of here with confidence Hallelujah sometimes brother brand says you need to shake yourselves sometimes the Holy Ghost will shake you shake you right to the core and that's what causes you to go deeper and we constantly need to be going deeper this Revelation is constantly unfolding and opening up like the Roman Candle the word the truth is pressing on it's marching on we don't know it all we don't see it all right now or else we would not be here if this word was completed in The Bride of Jesus Christ in this hour the Rapture would have gone Hallelujah so we are here and we have to keep pressing on oh yes brothers and sisters I know the ministers know when they're up here that gross darkness is getting heavier and heavier the song leaders know that when they're up here trying to get the people to worship it's getting heavier and heavier upon the people because Satan has come down Hallelujah to deceive so this gross Darkness upon the people of Co of this course is prophesied of this day now that we are now living in but the oil has moved into the Capstone this is the age amen where the oil has moved on the 10 foolish virgins five wise with oil five foolish without oil is happening right now right here right now being fulfilled people claiming they have the message but not recognizing the day that they're living off of they're living off of a false light a mirage taking the same light remember it's light a false light and a true light are both lights then using it to stay in a past age a false light is a light a mirage is an image that seems to be true but it keeps you from the True Light the true image of God and that's what's taking place in this hour that false birth that false light that's being preached that false image of Christ in this hour is keeping people from the True Light the true birth in this hour let us move on here I got more to say why God planned it this way is to show his election and his choosing because all because of the fall the Serpent's Seed came in Hallelujah the serpent seed came in that's why he's got to reveal his word through the prophet and through the ministry of this hour like this because the serpent seed came in and he knows his bride will not be deceived that's prophesied she will not be deceived in this hour but she will see her way out Hallelujah Satan is always trying to pervert what God has created because Satan cannot create he can't create so he takes think about it he takes what God has created what God has spoken what God has done and then he tries to pervert it and mislead the people and direct them in another different direction against away from what the new birth Jesus said you must be born again why do you think he said that you must be born again or you cannot see or enter into the kingdom of God so Satan knows that Satan knows when the new birth comes to an individual he's done he's finished he can try to attack but that new birth will always rais up just like in the prophet when he lost his his wife and his daughter he and Satan came to him and started pounding him and he was about to give up but he said then something raised up inside of him that new birth that genuine New Birth raised up and kept him going and said blessed be the name of the Lord it wasn't just words it was an action it was an experience that he had blessed be the name of the Lord he give he takes what is this the new birth he takes that away but he gives me eternal life through the new birth Hallelujah so blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah amen but it keeps you from the True Light the image of God why God planned it this way to show his election Satan's always trying to pervert what God has created because Satan cannot create himself are you seeing the true light or the false light they're both lights are you seeing the True Image or The False Image in this hour the God of this evil age now back through there other ages you belong to denominations you belong to this you belong to that and others what happened to the denomination stock it dried up we can see that right the spirit keeps leaving it and going on are we listening and it heads up in a seed you see in the temptation of both heads back the same way it was in the beginning notice don't forget it now first John 4:5 he puts the spirit it is it is the spirit of error that he puts there Eve never just simply walked out willfully and say I don't believe God I don't believe the message of the hour I don't believe God sent a prophet I'm just bringing it right down to today no it was an error she believed Satan never comes out and says oh well that's not even the word of God he emites the word of God but he puts his own interpretation on it hallelujah how much interpretation the prophet preached the a whole message God is his own interpreter he will make it plain we don't understand that we don't understand that ministers don't understand that that we're not to interpret the word of God God will interpret it he will make it plain he'll bring it to pass I'm just telling you that there's there's a devil there's a new birth there's a walk there's a life of God that has to manifest amen God will interpret it I don't need to interpret it I can interpret it it's not laid in the power of man's hands man's hands will not touch this that's why when brother bradam supposedly people say open the Seven Seals he did not open the Seven Seals said the seven seal is Christ himself that's why when he preached the message the title seven seal there is nothing there that was revealed that was revealed in the first six seals because Christ came on the scene he's his an own own interpreter he will make it plain he reveals himself to the individual nobody else has that position nobody else has that office in this hour but Christ alone that's why he came that's why the bride's going to overcome that's why she's going to take a body change and be victorious in this hour against all the Ws of the devil because he's here that's one of my greatest songs he is here hallelujah he is here amen it's because he is here that's why I said we're two or three are gathered together I'm in the midst and all things agreeing together on the word of God it shall come to pass do you realize the power we have here tonight in agreeing and being united by the word of God that's being revealed by faith and speaking it Satan shuts your mouth shuts your heart shuts your spirit because he knows if you just do what God tells you to do what he's purposed for you to do which is speak that word of God when it comes into your heart he's finished hallelujah amen glory to God brother brandham tied all the Loose Ends by revealing the Mysteries now it's for the Bride of Jesus Christ to bring back amen now we're not going back to Pentecost back there especially the modern day Pentecost but it's the Bride of Jesus Christ bringing back the acts of the Holy Ghost in the church again setting up the church by the Holy Ghost and the holy ghost moving through the church the bride in this hour the same Holy Ghost oh but we we got an interpretation that is manifesting around this message message we're going around and seeing the atmospheres we're seeing the conditions of the people it's not the people's fault it's what's being preached to them hallelujah it's what's being preached pting people on the back it's come right here oh yes it's come right here I feel the pressure sometimes oh of giving you what you want to hear or making it so positive what you want to hear you feel that pressure not telling you the truth not telling you that you're wrong you're out of line you need to get back in order you need to seek God you need to repent repent means change sorry is not good enough everybody with this emotionally sorry I'm sorry Lord I'm and even crying I cried when I prayed in tears I was sorry Esau SE repentance with tears and find it repentance is turn around repentance is a change something happened that you'll never do that again that desire is gone that's true repentance and that's what the devil is using to take away from the people to get on their knees in this hour to make you feel comfortable you're in the bride you got the message of the hour you're okay that's what's being projected in so many words and so many messages that are being preached today Hallelujah glory to God I want to be true and I hope you do to your calling to your convictions don't let Satan make a treaty with you a covenant with you in your walk in your convictions the way God called you I don't care if nobody likes you you're not popular I don't care about any of that stuff I really don't you could believe me or not believe me I want to be true to that conviction in my heart whether I'm whether whether my delivery it needs to be perfected whether you know I'm not even a preacher so let's get that straight right here I'm not much of a Preacher so that'll take that criticism away from you that is coming towards me I'm not even much of a Preacher H Allelujah but I got an experience with God and a and a a continue experience with God that he's given me and he opens up this door when if he shuts this door he shuts the door I want to do his will amen hallelujah bringing the bride back to the acts of the Holy Ghost again she will not be a parrot repeating the quotes with no understanding of what she's saying no no she'll understand her part and the word of God she will also see her part in fulfilling her part in this hour hallelujah oh there's so many parrots not understanding what they're saying because they're not seeing themselves in the word brother brand said brother Bram said brother Bram said no understanding Samaran Church age 242 in very plain Lang language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God that's where she was not in a church not in her mommy and daddy not in a Ministry but in the mind of God hallelujah she goes back into the mind of God eternally through not expressed until each came forth in his designated degree season each member came forth and became an expression and took its place in the body thus this it Bride is a literal spoken word seed bride how can she produce anything else every seed will bring forth of its own kind the seed of this hour that has been spoken through a prophet has the bring forth of its own kind has to bring forth that life that was spoken what life was spoken in this hour was it a church life a message believing life or was it the life of Jesus Christ the word made flesh again Hallelujah glory to God Amen God of this evil age 197 chapter 77 this evil age is of Darkness yet belongs to the church they God they love him for it the way that he lets them do things they have no condemnation nothing bothers them as long as they belong to church think about it they have no condemnation nothing bothers them because why they belong to church is it happening in the message balum taught the church the same thing let us unite we're all the same it was the last trick of the devil wonder if that's going to be the last trick in the message of the hour God never forgave them for believe in such a lie remember it was an unpar sin which is unbelief to believe that three times in the Bible for any person to add one word of their own interpretation to God's word after it been Vindicated the truth we got a Vindicated truth message of the hour a word to the Bride In the Garden of Eden right one word was added caused death when balam added one word that we're all the same God never forgave Israel for that every one of them perished in the wilderness except the three that God brought out Jesus said they're all everyone dead thus Eternal separated they're all gone never was forgiven the unparal sin never forgiven them oh flee it my children flee it in this time of the evening light he's saying flee that belief flee that doctrine that we're all the same that you're okay Hallelujah red flags red flags what are red flags they're warnings warning signs and God is always putting up red flags in our midst Hallelujah signs to be aware to be conscious to be conscious of the atmospheres around you we just don't go in anywhere no matter where it is especially message churches and not be conscious of the atmosphere around you you don't know what you could be accepting what you could be swallowing amen that's why we have a Shepherd that's why we've had a Shepherd for many years who watched over us and protected us amen why because that's the anointing on him Hallelujah and the elders too to watch over and protect you the devil could be sitting setting a trap for you oh yes he goes before and he sets traps all the time and if you're in that state that mind or that belief of you're okay he's already got you he's not after you but if the devil's after you you'll know it if you're on to the word of God and the word of God is being revealed to you you'll know it because he'll fight you the Bible says like a roaring lion he seeks who he may devour God uses red flags for us to be ready for the attacks so we can position ourselves in our minds and our hearts and our actions and words of times he shows us didn't he say that I'll show you things to come I was up at I was up at our trailer and our Trail our house trailer that we have up north I was there and I was sitting on uh sitting down in in on the porch there and sister Deb comes out and says you got to come in here for a minute so I said okay I come in for a minute and I I stand there and I look and I'm going you know what it was it was a serpent like that big big sitting right there and I'm just sitting there going I go and you know that trailer sealed underneath it's it's very rare I talked to people I talked to people in the park and I told a few people that I know and they said we've never even heard of that before that's very rare that they come in and that big right there sister Deb is doing the dishes and that stuff and she looks down and she doesn't know how long it was there but it was right there curled up and evolve looking so right away you know you might think oh it's just nature it is all this stuff but to me it's red flags it's a sign that the devil is going to attack so what did I do what did I do what would you do probably run out of the trailer and [Laughter] scream no I went right towards it grabbed it by the throat come on with me took it outside gave that devil a beating oh yeah something raises up inside of you my brothers and sisters when I when I when I first looked at it that's all was running through my mind God was showing me red flags the devil then we come home the same time we come home we get all this rain as you know and we come home and I'm studying upstairs for this message I'm just starting to study and I get this scripture I just get the first scripture where it says the enemy will come in as a flood and I look out the window and I'm going something is telling me this is different the rain coming down is different I got up out of my seat and I went downstairs and I went and looked out the backyard and I looked at my whole backyard that was coming through the fences was flooding the whole backyard and it was coming in by the minute and there was nothing I could have done I told Deb I said there's nothing I could do to stop this it's going to come right through our basement it's going to do what it wants to do because the drains were not handling it this across the street the the the drain that goes across the the street if you've been at my house you'll see it across the street was so high that it was almost overflowing onto the roads and there's a steel cage that goes down it was lifted right up now the pressure to lift that right up so none of the drains could receive any water so the my backyard was filling up it was just coming through the fences from from up near the qw and I'm sitting there and I get down on my knees in the drain it's up to here I get down on my knees I'm seeing if anything's blocking it there's nothing blocking I took a couple pieces out I threw it but there's nothing blocking it and I'm on my knees and I said and I'm looking at the backyard and it's just going like this and if it goes right down into the basement and that's that's it it's finished and I I was on my knees and I just said actually I didn't say nothing I told her I said it's in God's hands I just got there and I took it out when I took out what was there and it was I knew the pressure from the water underneath there's nothing you can do there's nowhere for the water to go and no word of a lie if that you know the drains that had the steel cages around there I was kneeling right on that if that wasn't there it would have sucked me right in all of a sudden in my mind I'm thinking this and all of a sudden a sudden urge just suck right down I told you if I wasn't if that cage wasn't there I would have been sucked right that's how powerful it was within three minutes my backyard was clear Hallelujah a serpent enemy coming in as a flood red flags my brothers and sisters wake up to things that are happening around your life don't just take it for granted these are red flags these are signs that God is trying to speak to you trying to direct you away from the enemy's attacks I become more conscious at that time I become more aware and more sensitive at that time to see myself line up with that word where am I missing you Lord where am I missing your direction where am I missing the word that you're sending to me hallelujah amen glory to God Isaiah 5413 says no weapon formed against me shall prosper hallelujah amen do you believe that no weapon formed against the Bride of Jesus Christ that's believe in this reveal word will prosper in this hour the enemy will come many are the afflictions of of the righteous but the Lord delivers out of all them because of his purpose [Music] Hallelujah not mentioning my wife's back going out you know you know my back already my wife's back goes out she can't do nothing and here it is the trailer house trailer up there is opening I us usually take care of the outdoor

God bless you sisters Hallelujah glory to God it won't Prosper but I'll make all things work together for your good it's been spoken that everything that will come against me physically mentally spiritually financially socially in relationships oh yes relationships marriages families all these attacks the devil will come against the Bride of Jesus Christ but no attack shall the enemy prosper in anything that he tries to do to destroy me because we will not be destroyed we will overcome come cuz we are Overcomers in this age and that's why you need a word of God in such a way in this hour to break the the the gross darkness of deception that's coming upon the people where did it say it's coming upon the people my brothers and sisters do you see and understand it's coming upon the people in this hour that's what's coming upon the people hallelujah all chain strongholds all fears that is bringing God's people down it has been spoken and the victory has to manifest over all the power of the enemy listen this is the word of God in this hour if the word of God is inside of you and you got the new birth you will agree the Holy Ghost and you will agree with the word and say amen amen that that's the truth that's the truth for my life that's the truth for my circumstance my situation amen I don't know when it's going to come to pass I don't know when it's going to be fulfilled my job is to say amen and believe it let God do his own interpreting amen nothing shall hurt me all the days of my life devil put in fear scaring you I'm going to hurt you I'm going to take your life I'm going to do this all these kind of things but God's saying nothing shall hurt you all the days even in death there's Victory do you hear me even in death there's Victory my brothers and sisters death where is your sting grave where is your Victory but thank God through the Revelation through the Holy Ghost to the new birth of this hour the Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah has been given the vict Victory amen hallelujah glory to God hallelujah amen no more unsettling our hearts Hallelujah glory to God I'm just going to have to continue this Amen in our hearts no more lack of confidence we are he is bringing perfect peace perfect understanding of who we are nothing shall hurt us you don't start right listen my brothers and sisters you don't start right you won't end up right it's very important to start right brother Brown says the bride's privilege like Jacob's privilege was the right birth he had a right to the right birth we have a right my brothers and sisters to the right birth in this hour hallelujah hallelujah I know it's just a statement but there's meaning behind it that is taking place you have to start believe the right you have to start believ in this message and God sent a prophet yes that is true that is true but with the new birth it doesn't come first believing God sent a prophet believing in the message church and going to a message Church doesn't come first the new birth comes first Christ comes first I know that's been in my experience I didn't know even about a prophet but I knew I was born again I Knew by the experience that I had I was born again then I came to understand later down the road that God sent a prophet and the birth inside of me the spirit inside of me agreed with the word of God hallelujah amen instead of taking an experience of the gifts of the Holy Ghost it starts with Jesus Christ Christ becoming real to you he is the revealed word he actually manifests himself to you he opens your eyes to see him then you recognize that you are a sinner Hallelujah that's the one thing that when the word came to me and told me that I I have to repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ that's what opened up to me I recognized that I was a sinner oh people in this message message people around growing up in this message don't even recognize that they're a sinner you have to recognize that you're a sinner not because somebody told you or because the Bible say so or brother Brown said so but you recognize that you are actually a sinner sinner you're sinning and that you're a child of God that's what it does it makes you recognize you're a sinner a lot of people don't recognize their sinners in this message only do true bride of Jesus Christ recognizes I'm a sinner saved by grace I'm a sinner saved by grace my attitude my life my behavior is consumed in that that I'm a sinner saved by grace I've been elected and predestinated by the grace of God it's my experience my brothers and sisters not because I'm religious not even because what I believe is because of the grace of God let me just try to wind this down I have lived three lifetimes with all the experience I've had and still having because experiences open the door to a deeper understanding now I'm talking about experiences here because people get deceived Satan uses experiences to deceive people that they're born again you can have experience after experience and still not be born again oh yes of who you are in Christ but the New Birth has to be there in order for you to recognize who you are or your experiences are just what they are experiences they're not pointing you or directing you to any particular direction people have all kinds of experiences you see it out there in the Pentecostals you see it with the gifts signs of Wonders but not going in any different direction Hallelujah people believe in being born again is just an experience it's an Awakening of the seed of God inside of you that's what it is am I taken away from experiences am I saying experiences are false no but there's two different things here in this message is where Satan is perverting the unity of the true birth we have it if you can see God sent a prophet or we have it if you can understand denominations of the devil or you can see that God is given in this hour of rapture or the world is full of lies and evil people and Liv in wrong ways all kinds of deceptions believing in this message that you have it it's only by election many are called but few are chosen God doesn't want positive mental thinkers he wants the word of God to manifest H Allelujah he doesn't want good church attendance and good works great meetings or camp meetings he wants you to be born again oh yes all deceptions deceiving the people misdirecting them from what the new birth taking the word of God and try trying to make it of none effect to the people when Jesus said that you must be born again oh bringing forth signs and wonders The Awakening and becoming a reality in your experience where you recognize who you are in the reveal truth of this hour not you recognizing you are a message believer and you believe God sent a prophet it's knowing God sent a prophet because I'm a son and daughter of God it's because I'm a child it's because I've been born again you're hearing the literal voice of God bringing a manifestation the word of God alive in your life that's what it is my brothers and sisters Hallelujah God is revealing the secret things in the heart hearts of the Bride every day he's revealing secret things in her in the word for the day and age we are in Luther had his secret it was justification for his age Wesley his Secrets was revealed to them with sanctification Pentecost was the baptism of the Holy Ghost that was their secrets not ours my brothers and sisters see the truth is truth but it's not Truth for our age and our time Time bottom line and that's what I'm trying to bring here to recognize doing all that I can do fighting up here the forces of Darkness of understanding to open up your understanding that you're like Paul said that you might be enlightened that your understanding might be opening and recognize that the light bulb might turn on and get away from being in the message being a message believer you are a son and daughter of God and you're to bring forth the Living Word of God in this hour that's who you are to bring a same manifestation that has been prophesied to come forth in this hour and fight the devil on every level deception on every level the most deceiving age it's got to be preached my brothers and sisters Hallelujah amen these were the secrets of God revealing in that day but this day is for the rapturing of the Bride he's revealing the Holy Ghost himself Hallelujah the word made flesh in Bride form in the fullness of the revealed word that no other age has experienced this is a different experience in this hour and this age that the Bride of Jesus Christ is is going to go through oh Hallelujah never been done before my brothers and sisters Hallelujah where our word is going to become so real and such a manifestation in human flesh in this hour that it's going to translate her very molecules of her body I believe she's becoming Invincible right now hallelujah oh glory amen it's not just a message it's not just quotes to me Hallelujah this is a living reality in my life what has been spoken oh I get down oh I get doubting sometimes I have to dealt my doubts am man I have to fight fear I got to fight all these things but just like Abraham when it was written of him he staggered not at the promises of God through unbelief oh yes that's the Bride of Jesus Christ that's Abraham's seed in this hour she's not staggering at these promises of God oh she's saying inside her soul manifest word of God manifest word of God what has been spoken what has been released in this hour through the opening of The Seven Seals cut forth in the name of Jesus Christ Lazarus the Bride of Jesus Christ once again come forth in this hour the word of God will be fulfilled amen amen come as this CHR amen glory to God hallelujah let me tell you my brothers God is revealing more than God sent a prophet Hallelujah is revealing the word is becoming flesh today amen hallelujah so she can be him revealed Amen brother brandom in his day Hallelujah preach Christ is the mystery of God being revealed but today God gave me this a while ago and I spoke it a few times the Bride of Jesus Christ is the mystery of Christ being revealed in this hour Hallelujah glory to God Amen thank you Lord hallelujah amen my brothers and sisters listen everybody's waiting on the Rapture ah everybody in this message is waiting on the Rapture let me tell you one thing I'm not waiting on no Rapture I am the Rapture I am the Walt's Revival I'm not waiting on it Hallelujah I got the oil in my lamp amen I'm walking with the oil of God in this hour it's changing me from Glory unto Glory Hallelujah the original Life The Original Seed is back again manifested in this hour Oh Glory to God hallelujah amen God is breaking through amen The Devil Is Lost the devil has has lost the battle tonight amen somebody's going to be blessed somebody's going to walk out of here with chains lifted off them somebody's soul is going to be set free in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah because of him because he came amen glory to God hallelujah amen glory to God hallelujah I'm going to stop right there amen this Revelation requires the age verification to be present Hallelujah truth will always identify the age it's manifesting it Hallelujah let us stand glory to God Amen Satan will try to pervert the true Unity of the faith but Christ has come down to say in Matthews 2422 [Music] and except those days be shortened there should no flesh be saved but for the elect sake those days shall be shortened oh God that's my heart's cry tonight shorten let that manifest then if any man shall say unto you Lo here is Christ think about it in this hour Lo here is Christ it's happening happening my brothers and sisters or there believe it not believe it not believe no man for there shall rise false christs false prophets and show great signs and wonders and so much that if it were possible if it were possible it shall deceive the very elect behold I have told you I have forewarned you oh God we're not living off of man interpretation we're not living off of what man has said of who we are people live off of man's opinions man's interpretations in this hour people B their salvation and their walk and their experience with Christ off of what man says but let every man's word be a lie I've recognized Christ is in our midst Christ has led me and guide me I should have been dead at Birth I wasn't supposed to live through the night but it was Christ there that got me through the night and I lived I should have been dead many times over my wife should have been dead many times over maybe some of you the same way you got testimonies it wasn't because of man man never did anything in your life man can encourage you and stuff like that yes pray for you but it's been Christ it's been Christ and the devil's pointing everybody in so many different directions and now it's the most deceiving age because he's taking this very word of God in this message of this hour and creating fables false interpretations Illusions delusions to deceive the people he knows he can't tell you that the message and and and God's propit isn't isn't real he can't tell you that but he's going to do the same thing he did to Eve has God said so has God said so let me tell you tonight my brothers and sisters I hope you heard the word the the voice of God not the voice of brother Tim the voice of God [Music] say let us pray father we thank you Lord I know it's a broken up message I didn't even know was going to go in this Direction Lord I don't see the order like some preachers do how they can lay it out I don't see it that way you haven't built me that way Lord I put things together Lord and I come up here and I see the spirit that the word is directed [Music] I wish it's been said many times that I can preach the word and just make the people Rejoice all the time but I can't be true to anything else than what I see what What I Am Lord I love the people as your Prophet said I'm I'm not angry I love you it's the same Spirit of Christ in this hour on the true Ministers of God red flags Lord Jesus Open the Eyes of your people whatever it is you brought this message for a reason may their discernment May their understanding Lord if the devil's deceiving anyone Lord away from the true birth of this hour of being truly born again and accepting a lie of the devil that you're okay without the new birth then Lord Jesus expose that devil break that power Lord and Lead that son and daughter right into that new birth father unless a man or woman
