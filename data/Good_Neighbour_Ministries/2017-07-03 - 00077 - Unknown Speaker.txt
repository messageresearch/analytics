Breen will get together and get to the flute praise the Lord by his grace amen she lost her um flute that she plays here on the bus somehow so prayer request pray that she recover that flute but the devil isn't going to stop God's children or God's word yes and um if the Lord sees it f to restore it you will in that way if that doesn't come back to us and the devil holds on to it then we'll find a way for her to get a flute to be able to play in the presence of the Living God hallelujah praise the Lord on top of that brother bisco um his uh operation uh started at 5:00 this afternoon a stck up there time about there I believe 3 or is it 6 3 3 hours right so therefore it's 6 6 6:00 his uh operation started and some of you know about it 90% blockage that's that's bad you know 90% blockage and the other complication so um we we pray and trust that the Lord will bring our our brother out but like Daniel said to King Nebuchadnezzar uh if you choose to keep in the fire I'll go in the fire and uh if uh he doesn't want to take me out of the fire amen then I won't worry about it either so this way if the Lord uh wants to take this witness home there's nothing we can do about it because when he calls we have to answer regardless of what age we at I you brother bll is way up in age believe is 80 something you know yeah 80 something years old and 83 and was still so was so still bigor us going hunting and preaching all around the world so um uh God has been good to himen God has been good to him naturally where he's a wealthy man in his own nothing to do with the church before he even dealt with the church wealthy in business right um he's done very well in that area then when God blessed him with the church starting with a uh 50 people and then 100 people first he was here in in Toronto you know he told me himself in his daughter's living room he was here for a brief time but he just didn't feel the Zeal for it and nothing was happening so he just quickly left and went West right when he went West there and then he you know went with some Pentecostals and stuff for a while and then he started on his own because they threw him out he started on his own and he had some just another handful of people and the next thing you know they grew to about a hundred and you know the story you built the lock cabin there they work together and built that lock cabin and after a while Lord bless them give him a vision amen of this wonderful work that was going to happen and then the Lord blessed them somebody sold them a 100 acres of land in that area there for a minuscule Mount at the time right and uh then they kept they start keeping church and Lord tell them no build a new Tabernacle so then what happened is that how's he going to build a tabernacle they don't have the money and Lord says well sell some of the land and then with what was shown to him he had a builder come in a developer come in and draw up the whole land like a small town with lots and houses and stuff like that on it um and the rest is history you kept 5 acres for the church and built a massive Tabernacle on it which you know at the height of his ministry there was like 2,000 people in there every night right and now it's about 900 but that's still a lot of people right and uh since then God has his own ways the church broke into this group in Washington this group over here this group over there this group over there because sometimes H sometimes it looks like the devil but sometimes it's the will of God so that the word can spread up right it's like scattering fire um no Pastor likes it but God is the over Shepherd amen and he does whatever he wills and so um so uh we see that and then he you know he sent to me in his DA's living room because you know his son-in-law used to come to this church here um praise the Lord what was his name again uh maybe you can't remember you don't remember him but anyway um he used to be in the church here his mother is from City here his lost mother and so um he said there to me he said you know the only thing I didn't do is uh he didn't Envision that all this would happen that his ministry would really get that big so he only kept five acres you should have kept 10 or 20 acres out of the 100 acres CU now there's a town around it called evil Crest and all because the even the real estate agents was telling me he crazy who's going to come way out here to live but no sooner that they Mark those lots right with with hardly if no advertising people started coming and buying lots of and before you know it they were building building building and the rest is history praise the Lord hallelujah and then you know his life story from his youth with brother Bradham or brother Bradham saw him and the shirt that he was going to be wearing and all that you know uh and so he is one of the living Witnesses one of the living witnesses that are still here and one by one they have been gaining the portal brother is gone brother per green is gone you know Junior D is gone praise God brother Bale gone and and you go down the whole list of them right gone they're all gone and uh to a great degree a lot of that sometimes is even the purpose of God because he wants to take the people's eyes off of the witnesses and off of those men and so that the people's eyes will go on him alone amen those men don't have to try to build themselves up to be something that's not what I'm saying I'm just saying it's natural for human beings when they have a leader like that was close to the prophet they tend to gravitate to that person and then some go overboard with that person and but God wants our attention on him amen and him alone right God you made it plain how in the last days people have going to start Wasing celebrities whether it be preachers or or movie stars or whatever people are going to start worshiping celebrities and the only celebrity we are to worship is the Lord Jesus Christ amen we have to worship him give him praise amen so we pray that God will bring our brother through safely wonderfully and restore him back to his family that is our sincere prayer amen but we have to leave it at that for the Sovereign will of God because God's Sovereign will overrides anything we say or do then also what a week brother Christopher's daughter his eldest daughter Trisha uh having three sons no daughters Just Three Sons Bri boy nice voice um she had an accident sometime ago and that's affected her back and neck and all like that until it was so bad that her hands and her feet started to get paralyzed a paraly paralysis began to creep in right on her and before it took over completely it took her to uh she decided to go to the doctor and the doctor said it's a nurse right somewhere in your neck and there's something else going on in your brain and we have to operate why but he says now when we operate one little mistake I have to tell you you said plain one little mistake and you'll either be gone or you paralyzed for life and um I prayed with her of course but the thing about it it's like touch and go so I prayed with her that God will be the surgeon and that he will work through that surgeon and let all things be well so brother Chris was excited when he called me back later in the evening and said the operation went well 100% the surgeon said he never seen anything like it he said it was absolutely if I can say it for myself because he did it absolutely [Applause] perfect and early this morning gave me another call to said oh Pastor she was in pain all night she you know she pain all night yeah he says but you know the thing about it is now the feeling in her hands and her feet are C back and she started to be able to move him again prise God serve oh praise God Heaven and Earth adore him praise God what a mighty God we serve so I said well you know what it is uh after an operation or any injury the the the night or the morning after is usually the worst right uh the pain is the worst and then after that it slowly begins to receive and the fact that you are feeling pain which is what what most doctors try to tell people tells you that you are getting well because if you weren't feeling that pain the pain is telling you that your body is working and it's trying to uh it's trying to cast off anything that's uh uh negative right so uh we want to give God praise for that and honor him because he's the Mighty God he's still a Healer he's still the great God of amen praise the [Applause] Lord now we would have loved if it could have just disappeared like brother Brandon's wife when the surgeon touched her the minute he tried to touch her with that knife Bo everything just left gone amen uh that's us we human beings are built like that that kind of stuff captures us you know but God works in many many ways amen he works through hers you know God A Healer that's right and he'll heal you through hers natural substances but he'll also heal you by using a doctor or a nurse amen praise God or he can heal you by his healing power gradually that's right or you can make you well by an instant Miracle that's right but when we come and we ask God for deliverance we don't uh tell him which way he should make or do it that's up to him how he does it whether by Mir sudden Miracle whether by gradal healing whether by doctor whether by herbs whether by food whatever that's in his hands praise the Lord but most people tend to have their own expectation already in their mind so when the preacher pray if their hand go straighten out right away they say oh my God I'm not healed right as if it's magic Abracadabra he prayed and it didn't work praise the Lord that's how people thinks that that's how human beings think oh he prayed but nothing work well what about the guy that was blind Grand prayed for was about a year later while he's in the barber's chair and said come on John you know you're blind said no no I'm not blind I'm Healed he says but you we I know you for for this long you come into this barber shop I'm looking at you right now and I know that you are blind he said no I'm not blind I'm Healed praise God and when he said it that time W his eyes just popped right open and he popped right out the chair with all his home on his beard and everything run down the street with wa I'm heal I'm Healed heal praise God hallelujah he's the mighty healer he the Le amen oh praise God when the saw him he started walking oh praise God he's still the Mighty God you believe that the devil trying to cover all this up and put it in the back like if it's only history is if it's something back there then he had he also has Jes and jees out there claiming that they're working miracles and and all have the people oh there's another one when
