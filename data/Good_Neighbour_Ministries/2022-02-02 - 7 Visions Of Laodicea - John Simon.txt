TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] grace mercy and peace be unto you it is with great joy that i come to you in the name of the lord jesus christ on this wonderful wednesday evening and may the holy spirit bring us together for a while that we may look into the word of god as we continue in our study of these seven church ages and in particular we are speaking on visions of laodicea visions of leodicio speaking of this seven visions uh that our dear prophet and brother was blessed with in 1933 by the grace of god from this point of view we shall begin but before we do let us pray our gracious and kind loving heavenly father we thank you so much that you have devoted yourself and your love to us to care for your children to lead and to guide them and now to feed them with the riches of thy word bless us father as we come together in the name of jesus christ your beloved son amen and amen from the book of revelation chapter 3 reading one verse verse 14 and unto the angel of the church of the leodisians write these things set the amen the faithful true witness the beginning of the creation of god hallelujah praise god well speaking on the laodicean church age first of all we ended our last talk about leodisia showing how that the spirit or characteristics of the city of laodicea has transferred itself into the age in which we are living in and our age in our time is now displaying those characteristics that were in that city in a magnified form now in 1932 brother william branham the 20th century prophet that was sent here to the earth under an anointing of the spirit of elijah prophesied by the prophet malachi chapter 4 verse 5 and how he would come and turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers in the book of revelation chapter 10 verse 7 he is also described or identified as the seventh angel or the seventh messenger to the seventh church age it is in this time that the great mighty angel of god came down from heaven and spoke shouted with a loud voice roared with a loud voice and said time shall be no more which that time was not telling us of time in terms of all time time for the planet or time for everywhere else no that mighty angel was referring to the time for the church ages are now over the church ages are at an end and here he came to give the final message to this seventh church age messenger this seventh church age messenger a prophet by call by ordination of the spirit of god by nature hallelujah was sent here to bring to us the last words of god blessing warning teaching guidance prophecy all of it to the gentile dispensation at the setting of its son for when this gentile dispensation is over then the entire economy of god goes back to the jews oh blessed be his holy and righteous name and now this prophet genuine bible prophet and especially i emphasize that because we live in a day where it has become fashionable for once to call themselves prophets now we know in the bible the bible tells us that if a prophet says he comes in the name of the lord and he prophesies anything and it does not come to pass then he needs to uh you know he needs to be exposed that a lying spirit came upon him and he is not a prophet of god he is not a true prophet of god of course baal had his prophets maman has his prophets uh shimosh has his prophets all the various gods of these false nations in the bible claim that they had prophets but that from ever of old has always been satan's strategy when god presents a prophet then he trolls uh uh raises up a whole bunch of music magicians or copycats as in pharaoh's court at the time of moses who will also cast down their rods and prophesy oh but we know there is only one true prophet from god to a generation and he is the one that we are to look and listen to for a true him comes the voice of god in these last days now this prophet this our dear loving brother william marion branham who was a vessel through whom the voice of god could speak is the one that prophesied and is speaking here now i'm only giving a voice to his words he says the leodisian age began around the turn of the 20th century perhaps 1906 how long will it last how long we do not know now he mentions how that god had given him seven major visions one morning in the year 1936 i would i want those numbers or that number of that year to remain in your mind primarily and see the background from which this man is speaking the word of god not in 2022 not in 20 uh 2020 not in 1900s nothing of the kind no my friends this is in 33 praise god hallelujah but now he says i base this prediction prediction on seven major continuous visions that came to me one morning in june 19 33 the lord jesus spoke to me and said that the coming of the lord was drawing nigh but that before he came seven major events would transpire or would take place and so i wrote them down he wrote them down and that morning came to his church and he spoke these things that god had revealed and made known to him he gave out for it was a genuine revelation of god that was being made known god shining his great light on the age of lodesia opening up a window through which we could look through using the eyes of god's prophet who has already seen this and said thus saith the lord and the now the first vision as we come to these visions is the vision was that i saw mussolini would invade ethiopia and that that nation would fall at his steps and that vision caused repercussions many were very angry with me when i said it and they would not believe it but it happened anyway he just walked in there with his modern arms and took over and the natives did not have a chance but the vision also said mussolini would come to a horrible end with his own people turning on him and that came to pass just exactly as it was said now remember this was said in 1933 before any intimation any inclinations any signs of any such a thing it was spoken by the mouth of the lord oh my the next vision was concerning he looked in the in the true prophecy through the eyes the telescopic visions of a prophet and saw an austrian by the name of adolf hitler and saw that how he would rise up to be a dictator in over germany and by in that position he will draw the entire world into war in looking out there he saw the siegfried line and saw how the allies america would have a a hard time overcoming the sacred line and they had indeed that did have a rough time recorded well recorded in history but it he also saw that hitler would come to a very mysterious end which all those who have read of this man knows that he come to a mysterious end oh think of god telling these things to a man since 1933 that we might know and understand how the age would unfold and what signs we are to look look for oh praise god the third vision he said i saw was in the realm of world politics for it showed that there would be three great isms fascism then that would be followed by something called nazism then followed by communism but that the first two would be swallowed up by the third which is communism and then i heard a voice voice admonishing me watch russia watch russia king of the north watch russia keep your eyes on russia oh my friends though it was this is not planned at our present time in our world we see russia on the borders of the ukraine there is much talk about russia russia rising up in this hour this of course was never planned it just happens to fall that way as god wants it that i will be speaking and i'm speaking on this topic here today that you might receive light on the day light on the word recognize the signs of your times recognize the cut nearness of the coming of the lord and be ready for his glorious and marvelous coming yes watch russia king of the north they have much to do in prophecy as we shall further see as we go on oh my the fourth vision showed to me that there would be great advances in science and that would come after the second world war after the second world war he was shown there would be an upsurge of scientific achievements taking place one after the other and all the progress that was made in the other ages science after the second world war with so advanced that they will accomplish even more in that shorter period of time which they have until this time in which we live he said great advancement in science friends we're looking at it we're seeing all these rockets we're seeing all the advancement in in electronics we see the advancement in medicine we see the advancement in every uh branch of science everywhere but in particular when he looked just like danielle the prophet looked thousands of years ago and he could not describe cars said he looked and he saw highways he used the word highways and i saw chariots with eyes brighter than dragons he could not describe a car he saw this car headlights he said and they were running swiftly in the streets jostling traffic jams jostling one another like that man running to and fro my friends in that like manner this prophet looked when he looked he said i saw a car but the car first i want you to notice at that time cars were heavy they were made of steel they were just like tanks and there were large and long red fish tales and all manner of things of that nature my friends what he said i looked and saw in the vision a plastic bubble top car another place he described the car as having a shape like an egg oh my and it was running down the highways under something like a remote control right and the people appeared seated in this car without it having a steering wheel oh my 1933 [Music] he is saying these things on the inspiration of the holy spirit and saying there will be such a car we're controlled by remote control now we haven't come to the fullness of that completely as yet they're working on it right now as we speak uh you can right now you can get in some cars and press a button and hold the steering wheel and it will park itself exactly the way it should park there are trucks now on the road that are being tested that would be able to go for uh hundreds of miles without a driver under remote control and this was spoken by god's servant in 1933 people appeared sitting in the car without a steering wheel and they were so unconcerned about anything they were so used to it and unconcerned he said they were playing some sort of a game this this family in this car just sat around playing games and the car was taking them to where they wanted to go and their eyes of god's prophet looked and saw it now in the fifth vision this servant of god saw a great moral problem on the face of the earth and in this age and that moral problem as in the garden centered around women i quote god showed me that women began to be out of their place with the granting of the boat then next they cut off their hair which signified that there were no longer coming under the authority of a man but insisted on having their equal rights and in most cases more than equal rights certainly she said he looked and saw she began adopting man's clothing now you you must remember in those days in which he was speaking women wore long dresses down to the knees down to the ankles and their sleeves were ruffled right down to their wrist and to the neck it was right up they were completely covered and clothed and here is this anointed servant of god prophesying that he looked and saw women beginning to wear man's apparel of course that is totally unscriptural for the bible tells us in the book of deuteronomy she how that she shall not put on the garments that pertain to a man its abomination in the eyes of god says the scriptures listen to god's servant she adopted man's clothing and went into a state of undress in other words once her morality began to slip dropping our standards until she would wear men's clothing then of course it began to slip and slip until it came to the state where she would almost feel comfortable walking around in a state or condition of undress in the last picture or vision that i saw last picture i saw i saw a woman listen naked except for a little fig leaf type of apron and with this vision i saw the terrible perversion and the moral plight upon the whole world his sixth vision i looked and saw a great a woman cruel woman rise up in america this was the rise i believe of the catholic church i knew it could be a vision also of some woman rising into great power in america due to the popular vote of women oh my friends i want you to know that this was spoken in 1933. this is 2022. listen here in a marvelous wonderful powerful and revealing message entitled painted face jezebel but in the united states the woman is the head of the house here now this is a woman's country and that woman is a god of america i predict that before the coming of the lord that a woman will be a great ruler that's to say president in the united states because it's a woman's country and it all started in hollywood and it has to run its way right out see so there you go my friends prophecy of something that could not even be dreamed of back in those days that a woman would become president of the united states a woman is now the vice president of the united states let's keep our eyes upon prophecy upon the words of the prophet for modern events are made clear by vindicated prophecy oh praise god it has been spoken and now it's fulfilling itself in our day where we're not just listening to prophecy but we're watching it unfold before our very eyes oh friends listen in the seventh vision i heard a terrible noise a terrible explosion and as i turned to look i saw nothing but debris craters and billows of smoke rising all over america he saw his beloved nation of the united states growing up in smoke and then he says based on these seven visions along with the rapid changes which have swept the world quoting now from the revelation series remember let me say it again i am now quoting from his revelation series of sermons from his sermon the laodicean church age paragraph 43 now we believe the ledician church age started in a.d 1906 i predict now remember this i predict especially to you listening on the tape i don't say that it will be that way but i predict it will end by 1977 that the church would go completely into apostasy and she will be ousted out of the mouth of god now i want i would speak on the fact here that that's the mighty angel prophesying speaking about the end of the church ages time shall be no more but he saw this and he as a man predicted that it would end about 1977. shall be ousted out of the mouth of god and the second coming or the rapture of christ might come anytime now i me i could miss that by a year i could miss it 20 years i could even miss it a hundred years i don't know where or when i just predict according to a vision that he showed me taking the time the way it's progressing this great nation at least i can see is going to strike a war and that war is going to blow it to bits now that's pretty close awful close i could be wrong because i am predicting everybody understand it i'm only predicting other places you said i do not prophesy but i predict on this one thing about the ending of the lyodisian church age oh praise god forevermore for his great grace and love that he's a mighty wonderful god now let me say this can anyone prove any of these visions wrong the prophet spoke these visions every one has come to pass listen he said each one has been fulfilled and the rest is in the process right now and i say to you that is exactly right the rest is in the process right now oh hallelujah from mussolini invaded ethiopia successfully then fell and lost it all hitler started a war that he could not even finish and died mysteriously as you know communism took over both fascism and nazism and swallowed it all up the bubble car has been built and is now only awaiting a better network of cars now listen with a spiritual mind i want you to pick up these things one he's already prophesying in 1933 that cars will move away from using being built with steel to being made out of plastic material 1933 that there were the cars will tend to be plastic suddenly the shapes of the car he already prophesied they would start having this rounded edges away from the long heavy tank like square uh shapes they had but under the vision of god he saw how the cars would have these rounded ships amen and he even saw the roads and said they'd have to have a better network of roads because these cars are going to run by remote control they're going to be under some kind another place is that some kind of power electronic power they're going to be under whatever that is now we we can talk now about gps we can talk about these things it's all right before us but a simple humble anointed man spoke these things on the inspiration of the holy spirit giving us visions of the laodicean age oh my oh yes women are all but naked and are even now beginning to wear topless bathing suits he said just the other day i saw in a magazine the very dress i saw in a vision in the vision it was plastic it was transparent of course he is prophesying that there will be a change in dress because what was back in his time 1933 were women with long dresses as i said with the long covered right to their wrists into their neck and he's already by vision seeing this on the inspiration of the holy spirit and for telling it by the glory of god hallelujah oh yes he said this dress was plastic and transparent it was transparent with three dark spots two covering the breasts on the top and a dark spot like an apron covering below my friends he continued he said now we also see the catholic church is on the rise right and we have one catholic president listen to this prophecy that there will be another back then john f kennedy came on the scene catholic president and he's already speaking 1933 there will be another and i believe right now there is another let us pay attention to the signs of the times the things of god that are pointing us back to his word letting us know that his word is true oh my listen friends i want you to hear this in particular listen thus saith the lord repent i predict three curtains in the name of the lord one is called the iron curtain which will be russia watch china they will be the second curtain the bamboo curtain they are horrible but watch that purple curtain watch that purple curtain that one will rise up in the united states and all over the world for it is the rise of the roman empire religiously speaking the cruelest of them all remember i say this in the name of the lord get away from it come away from everything that's attached to it flee to the rock the coming of the lord is at hand we need a conference with god the church is at the end of our road let us run flee to him now amen oh my friends hebrews what's left for us what is left for the church age what is left for the world what's left for the church nothing except hebrews 12 26 and i read from the scripture he whose voice then shook the earth now he has promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth but the heavens also once more god shall shake the earth and it will shake everything loose that can be shaken then he will renovate it my friends i want you to recognize hear that god promised that he will send shock waves on the earth he will shake it he will shock the earth like that everything is going to be shocked heaven on earth will pass away but my word will never pass away oh thanks be to god hallelujah i want you to see friends at this particular time families are shaken and falling apart churches are shaking falling apart empty no adherence discipleship on the way down man running everywhere we find socially society is shaking morally shaking politically shock waves striking the earth everywhere amen we see this religious world shaking nature itself trembling on the climate change earthquakes pollutants everywhere the endangerment of species the passing away of various uh elements and things in the world the whole world order is shaking and showing the evidence of change the coming of a new world order a new system it's in its birth pains right now and everything else is being torn down being destroyed all that it can be reorganized remade deconstruction so they can do their reconstruction in their image and in particular i say in the image of the peace according to the bible amen so there's a lot of shaking going on for god said i'll shake the earth i'll shake the heavens also amen yes now back to the word last march 1964 the good earthquake of alaska shook the entire world though it did not unbalance it see because another sermon god speaking through him talks about an earthquake that will strike the world that will throw the earth off its axis and change all the weather patterns and so on but that's another time oh oh so here it is god warning by a world tremble what he was going to do on a larger scale he's going to blast and rock this sin cursed world oh my brother my sister you've got to find some safe place amen you can't stun the shock standing like that amen the only safe place is in the arms of jesus is in the fold of the lord jesus christ so he beseeches you and i beseech you in the love of god in the mercy of jesus christ to give your whole life unreservedly over to the lord jesus christ our faithful shepherd who loves you will care for you who will protect you and present you faultless before the glory of the eternal one in the in this ex exceeding great joy and i give him praise and honor and glory here today friends this man this prophet this servant this son and this saint of god in our day at this the end and ending of the gentile dispensation many have misunderstood him the man the best misunderstood the man they have misunderstood his ministry purpose and its meaning and they have misunderstood and still do his message which is still now in progress now remember as i conclude in every age in every time they've always tried to paint true prophets as crazy men as they were just odd fellows because there were men of the forest men of the deserts men of the mountains men that would go off and pray for long hours alone man that would be in the presence of god oh hallelujah and there can only be one major prophet to a generation there may be minor prophets but only one major prophet and i believe and teach william marion branham is god's major prophet that was said to this 20th century and he has fulfilled his mission the word has gone forth it lives in me now it lives in the hearts of millions around the world and it will continue to live long past the end of time until we enter into the glorious presence of the lord and so here we are we have seven visions concerning this age of leodisia course of events that would take place during the age from the beginning of it to the end of it and that is why i agree with our dear brother john paul lafontaine the writer of a wonderful song which i hold dear and i hum and i sing it within my heart this world is falling apart but jesus still lives down in my heart hallelujah and i thank god that those words are true and will remain true that this world is falling apart what you need to thank god for is that jesus christ our lord lives down in your heart and if he is not there i ask you tonight to let the great holy spirit come in let him find let that dove of peace find a nesting place within the altars of your heart god bless you good to have had you may the word of god rest richly between [Music] you
