TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] blessings glory and honor unto him who washed us in his precious blood oh precious is the flow that wash me white as snow no other fount i know nothing but the blood of jesus oh welcome friends to all of you everywhere may the spirit of the lord bless you in every way meet your every need satisfy your every godly desire within your heart fulfill and answer your prayers and that god will bless you in your spiritual life walk and growth that you may glorify him and magnify his great name here upon the earth may the lord bless you real god as we go to our uh bible study here in the seven church ages my uh scripture being revelation chapter 2 verses verse 11 he that had and heir to hear let him hear what the spirit said unto the churches may i repeat he that had an ear to hear let him hear what this spirit said unto the churches gracious heavenly father once again you honor us with the great privilege of being able to approach you by the way of prayer through the blood of jesus christ and the great benefits that we have received for this we honor you bless you glorify your name and come into your presence to hear the voice of your word and to receive it within our hearts in the name of jesus christ our lord glory and honor be to thy name amen and amen praise the lord my topic will be he that had an ear to hear i'm sure that every one of us here today are fully aware of the importance of having your hearing many times in the bible you've read where jesus had to cast out some deaf spirit or a deaf devil or somebody that was just merely ill with a a disease of deafness and could not hear a sound or a voice or they could hardly they could barely hear a sound and we have the colloquial term the hard of hearing they are hard of hearing they can't hear very well when jesus was here on earth many times he spoke preached many messages wonderful things and there was a problem in the sense that when he spoke in parables when he delivered his messages when he began to say i and my father are one when he begin to declare i am the bread of life when he began to say that i am the way the truth and the light no man comes to the father but by me you must be invited by the father recognized by the father identified by the father to be able to approach the heavenly father you don't just come but he bids you to come or else your coming is in vain and so in jesus ministry in making known the great name of god which is jesus christ his great mission to die for the sins of man and to bring them to attention of his word while doing that he had to call out the rest of the seeds of god that were scattered in the earth from the great sore who god was that went forth and sowed his seed or his attributes or his germs upon the face of the earth not in the dirt but in this earth god sowed his seeds of life his sons and his daughters god's own original germs were planted and so jesus started the harvest and started to call them out you know the story how he called one then that one called his friend and that friend called up the other friend and andrew called peter and called philip called nathaniel and that's the way it went amen praise god and that still is happening today around the world where one is calling another and another and another and the word of god is growing and multiplying and god is adding to the church daily such as should be saved now we're speaking about having an heir to hear for three and a half years jesus speaking to the pharisees and only a few could hear him you say what do you mean well the multitudes heard him but they only heard him with their natural ears with which we are all given natural ears and we can hear language english and if we have some uh understanding common sense or education we can clearly define crystallize and understand what is being said to us however when jesus used the term he that had an ear to hear let him hear that was not his thinking of just the natural ear because even though he was speaking to multitudes he knew that only a few were hearing or understanding what he was saying he made the great uh definitive and differentiating statement to the disciples to show them that even though they were all religious pharisees were religious the sadducees were religious they were going to church peter and and andrew and the rest of disciples were going to jesus's little church that he had but he was letting trying to let them see but you are different you are hearing what i'm saying matter of fact they came to him and said master how is it that we we hear what you we understand what you are saying but the rest of of of these pharisees sadducees even the rulers the theologians the doctors of divinity the various reverence of different groups at that particular time they were puzzled and they did not understand and you know humans anything they do not understand they have no understanding of they're ignorant of blinded off it becomes or in their eyes it becomes a trap they take it as something threatening as if you're standing in the dark and you heard a sound and you don't know what the sound was it immediately been begins to evoke fear because you don't know what that sound is but jesus turning to his disciples said you don't understand unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom but unto them it is not given in other words the kind of hearing that you have doesn't just happen you can't educate yourself into it you can't go to a theological school for it you can't go to the greatest academies universities and places of higher education or learning no secret society no great denomination no matter who they are none can give you this but he says unto you is given to no unto you it's given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of god but unto them they don't have that gift it is not given so one set has been given ears to hear in her ears the ears of the heart the ears of gods of your heart that was placed in you before you were even born again or know anything about him or recognize him he placed that faculty that ability in you to be able to understand him so that when he speaks delivers his word the deep calls to the deep and the deep just understands they don't know how they don't know why nobody there oh no theologian has to tell them but something inside tells them that's the truth i believe it you don't know even why you believe it you you you don't fully understand it all but but yet something in the heart tells you that's right amen oh praise god hallelujah so here in the book of revelation we have this statement being made again the same one who made the statement back in the gospels now said i am alpha i am omega i am beginning i am in i am the first i am the last the lord god almighty and now by the spirit he says he that had an ear to hear let him hear praise god hallelujah amen praise god i tell you my first i want you to receive this within your heart recognize this within your entire being and hold it grasp it and hold on to it for the true evidence of being baptized with the holy ghost is for the believer to receive the word of god for the age in which they live now on the day of pentecost acts chapter 2 you'll find the entire story that pentecostals read and report over and over and over again and that tell you about airing a sound from heaven and how what the sound of a mighty rushing wind and it be moved up on the fire of god fell and how tongues of fire was upon their head and their emphasis is that the people received the holy ghost and spoke in towns and i believe that did but they with their human carnality took that and made it into a doctrine and called it the true evidence of the holy ghost is speaking in towns but in that canality and without the spiritual ears of god a gift from god within your heart that's why jesus said blessed are your eyes that you can see blessed are your ears that you can hear or understand what it is i'm saying unto you when you look in the chapter 2 of acts 4 the emphasis is not on this speaking you will find the emphasis is on the hearing for he says they heard a sound from heaven oh bless god may god help you today that you hear a sound from heaven different from the sounds of the earth the voices of the earth may you hear the voice of god speaking in these last days that you might hear a sound from heaven for we it went on and you will read for we heard them we heard them speak with towns and prophesy and as you read the chapter you will find the people that were in the street said what do these for we hear them doing this acting like drunk man what needed all of this the point is the emphasis was more on the hearing the ability to hear that ability they hear so excited them and exploded within their soul with such a trill and with such a joy and an overcoming of the holy spirit that it caused them to tangle up their tongues and begin to babble under the anointing of the holy spirit praise god hallelujah but you see the speaking in tongues was an after effect of the hearing of the word of god it did not proceed but it was an afterglow or an after effect or praise god so the emphasis is on he that had an ear to hear let him hear what the spirit of god is saying to this generation when peter on that great day and jesus asked them who the men said that i the son of man am he some of them said well some of this says you're a teacher some say you're a prophet some say you know you're coming with a new teaching or some say you are your new young rabbi whatever he says yes that's wonderful to know the opinions of all these theologians that they put in books that they cause you to study it's wonderful to know their opinions that they give you in all their wonderful teachings and so on like that but who do you the individual now who do you say that i am what is your opinion what do you have in here to hear do you recognize and he's asking you what who do you say i am you as a person as an individual what do you see when you look what do you hear when you listen oh praise his wonderful name and peter out of the group uh i know who you are he says thou art the christ the son of the living god hallelujah the body in which god's dwelling now or praise his name oh hallelujah jesus answered to him blessed art thou simon barjona or son of jonah flesh and blood has not revealed this onto you but my father in heaven has revealed this onto you and upon this rock which rock the rock of revelation upon this foundation i'll build my church and that foundation is the ability to receive revelation that is the true evidence of the baptism of the holy spirit the gift from god placed within the heart and soul of an individual man woman child whoever they are the ability to re hear and receive the word of god for their age and then go out and manifest it or live it so the world can see what is in you they can't see what is in you until you work out your salvation without fear and trembling so the emphasis is on the revelation flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you but my father in heaven has revealed this unto you and upon this rock of what revelation of who jesus christ is i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail that over that kind of a church that is built on the ability of receiving revelation from the word of god you see the written word sits here it's static but revelation is the word come alive it's moving it's going to reveal itself any minute any moment to a hundred people a thousand people at the same time revealing different things to different ones at the very same time because it's a supernatural operation of the living god now we know revelations chapter 2 to 3. the seven church ages seven ages of the church of the living god during this time god is not dealing with the jews but god is dealing with the gentiles for it is the times of the gentiles and the times of the gentiles the cup of of corruption sin and also of righteousness comes to a point when it becomes full so we understand when you use the term the fullness of the gentiles the gentiles period or dispensation coming to its end or it's to its fullness just as much as babylon under nebuchadnezzar rose to its heights when it rose to its heights of its civilization and they came to the fullness of their time what happened a prophet stepped forth and they said to him what does all what does the towns the handwriting on the wall what do these towns mean and uh the prophet said no those towns that they're speaking that's not a blessing as you think it's really a curse and really a signal from god that it is the end of time the ending of the gentile dispensation minimum you farsin you are weighed in the balances and you are found wanting oh my oh glory to god here we are once again and the gentile world is glorifying speaking in towns and god is saying no the glory is departed ichabod ichabod the glory of god has gone from you oh lord have mercy upon them and so here it is we've come to the end of the gentile period or the gentile times when god was dealing and is still dealing with the gentiles during that time bringing them unto salvation now the bible tells us unto the messenger of the church and to every age that's how it comes the word of god the word comes from jesus and he delivers it to the angel of that church age one man anointed with the holy spirit becomes the angel of that church age the word angel of course not meaning a heavenly angel but an earthly messenger earthly messenger if you look the word angel it means messenger of good news so or it could be a dark angel but here it is the messengers to the church were angels of god so god said unto the angel of the church amen he that had an ear to hear let him hear take god not they but he one messenger to every church age and the other church ages have already passed and we know just to mention a few the first church age it was the apostle paul and later luther wesley and then under pentecostal church age william marion branham praise god god used that man as the angel to the church age whether it be all roberts t.l osborn all the great evangelists they all came out of his ministry for he was the angel to the church anointed with the holy ghost to fulfill the purpose and plan of god you'll hear more about this but god only speaks to one man in every age that one man then delivers his message and when he delivers his message ordained different ordained men hear that prophet messenger they receive his message and then they go out and begin to teach it preach it and magnify take it out to everyone who has an ear to hear praise the lord because god speaks by revelation to his churches but true church and false church must hear the messenger but only those who were given an heir will hear and the other churches or the other individuals will not hear they'll hear the same message but they're still they're not hearing and one set will hear the same thing but out of that they will hear the voice of god speaking to them through it hallelujah when that message is given then the message begins to be broadcast spiritually across the world everywhere the message becomes broadcast for all who will will come within range of the message within sound of my voice within the range of what is being said and when that message is broadcast or goes out this message is received individually praise god hallelujah you receive it individually in other words you can't go take a a book of fundamentals make up a list of of of things and and get everybody to to rally around that it's not like that god gives his word by revelation not by information intelligence wisdom of man but by the revelation of the holy spirit and you become a nor of the word annoying person a person to whom god begins to reveal himself and the bible tells you in in corinthians galatians ephesians that these gifts especially ephesians who have been given into the church god gives some the ability to to have really spiritual dreams not just dreaming all kinds of things but spiritual dreams some have the wisdom others are gifted with knowledge others discernment miracles signs and wonders and god gives some administrations others give them the power to be able to bring the word of god pastors teachers evangelists exhorters people anointed by the holy spirit and it's not something we work ourselves into study and or praise god but by his holy spirit that ability is placed in the individual and they come up with it not knowing how they got it but it's in them a thirst a hunger a desire within their soul o blessed be his wonderful name o glory to god i was only 12 years old i saw the lord high and lifted up oh praise god and brother when i was 14 we were i was not in any church but i suddenly began to feel a desire to preach the word of god where it came from i can't tell you what the desire came to preach the word of god and went out and began to preach along with a friend of mine two of us and to our surprise a revival broke out in that city or tongue i was in oh praise god people began to come from far and near hundreds saved healed delivered baptized in a name hallelujah and walk with god until to this day in that city there's a church of about 2 500 people oh glory to god god sent a revival now this is not a church revival where we decided we're going to have a meeting and invite people and try to work things up but this is something where the holy spirit himself came on the scene and began to move from person to person to person everywhere and begin to as paul as the apostle said in the book of acts and god not the superintendent and god not the evangelist and god not anybody but the holy spirit working through those who had already heard the word god added to the church daily daily such as should be saved oh it's a miraculous hand of god it's god working and moving by his blessed holy spirit can we have that again yes it's here again the holy spirit we are here writing another book of acts hallelujah go read the book of acts read that book of acts and make bless your soul i challenge you to read the book of acts below the god amen amen when i read that book of acts as a young man a young boy and said all the apostles did all this can i do all this that's that's written here in the bible of course it's true that's what the word says we are supposed to do lay hands on the sick they shall recover amen in my name they'll cast out devils o praises name and they shall drink any deadly thing and it shall not hurt them that doesn't mean you go and pick up poison and try to drink it but if when you are carrying the word somebody tries to poison you no evil thing formed against you will prosper glory to god hallelujah brother sister let's hold to god's unchanging hand let's preach the word let's pray let's let's love one another let's love the word and walk in the light of the word the word of god was received by whom those who had an ear to hear the word was received individually and then those individuals came together and that became a group but it was not the whole group all of a sudden uh all of a sudden they all believe and heard at the same time but each one heard for themselves and recognized the word of god for themselves and then that group was qualified by the holy spirit amen each individual in that group having their own ability whether they be a a child a young man a young woman praise god hallelujah look i was like i said i've been preaching since i'm 14 years old glory to god hallelujah and i'm still running up the shining way the devil is on my track and he's trying to turn me back but i'm running up the shining way blessed be his holy name amen so each individual in this group each one has to have their own ability to hear what the spirit of god is saying by way of the messenger amen so therefore what they are receiving and what they are saying and believing they're not getting their own private interpretation but they're getting god's interpretation for he is revealing it to them god moves in a mysterious way his wonders to perform he plants his footsteps on the sea the sea water the word and rides upon the storm god is his own interpreter he will make it plain oh thanks be to god on high glory to god hallelujah so it is each individual receiving a revelation from god so it's not private revelation it's god-given heaven-set revival it's heavenly sunshine it's light from above shining into the mind and heart of the individual and illuminating their thoughts their thinking on some of the scriptures they read it before they they read it maybe a hundred times but all of a sudden boom the light of god comes on oh praise god i want to tell you there's a man a person here that can turn on the light and his name is jesus christ thank god forevermore amen so each person is hearing and receiving by revelation what the messenger has already received from god but let me put my words here but maybe he never verbally expressed it he just spoke it and left it and the rest of it left unspoken but god takes that word and reveals it into the heart of the individual don't think that is strange because that's the pattern paul set under the hand of god for paul alone for his day had the full revelation even the other apostles admitted that paul had it and paul under the leadership of the holy spirit he was so surrendered to god that he wanted to go over to a belief to asia and god for the spirit of god forbade him amen and said no don't go there and then he said go to macedonia he said for the spirit bad me go hallelujah sons and daughters of god come into that state where they are truly genuinely led by the spirit of god who tells them to go or stay or sit still and wait until i speak into your heart and lead you and guide you and tell you what to do are you getting it are you understanding what i'm saying are you receiving it within your heart is this becoming clearer and clearer unto you every day hallelujah i pray the holy spirit will help every one of us it's the same pattern god the message comes the light comes to the messenger the messenger comes to a certain area and from that messenger the light spreads out to the ministry and lives of other people who begin to be faithfully taught by the word of the living god but of course many do not go out and say exactly what they were taught they begin to add and subtract and take out of it instead of staying with the word of the living god and paul spoke about that and warned the people saying there'll be people that will be coming with the same message the same things that i'm telling you but but don't listen right listen to what you're hearing from me amen paul even told them he says though an angel come down from heaven and tell you anything different don't you believe it if i come back and tell you something different don't believe me paul even used himself and said i can't change it because it's not my word it's the word of the living god and i cannot change it amen hallelujah is the commandments of the lord and friends that is the problem why revivals die revivals die when people go away from the word of god and revivals continue to move when the people stay with the word purpose and plan of the living god and don't listen to the voices of man and that's the reason why we don't hold with these fundamentalist pentecostals denominations and so on because we believe in primitive christianity we believe in active spontaneous anointed revealed word of god coming from the presence of almighty god to inspire anoint lead and guide and teach by the holy spirit that god is sent to teach us amen he that had an ear to hear what the spirit said on to the churches i'm starting to wind this up and i want to re-emphasize this ability god-given ability not man-given not man's knowledge human knowledge is just an accumulation of the six thousand years of human uh humans being on the earth and that knowledge being collected put into universities colleges encyclopedias and books and and then we go back and cram our minds with that and we call that knowledge and it is knowledge but that's just human knowledge that's the knowledge accumulated by the five senses and that is limited knowledge which they're still experimenting searching trying to find knowledge but god by the holy spirit is allowing his sons and daughters to tap into his knowledge the two kinds of knowledge sense knowledge knowledge coming from the senses and revelation knowledge you don't even know how you got it but it's just you just know because it's being revealed to you by the blessed holy spirit thank god it's not dead not since the days of the apostles not since the days of jesus it's not gone and we they did not need a school for it they did not need a denomination for it they needed jesus christ to reveal himself by the anointed word of god to them amen if you if you're a christian you will get it you will get what the spirit of god is teaching and what the spirit of god is saying to your age in which you live the cry of the holy spirit my friend is always don't leave the word that's a rebuke to the age don't leave the word don't swerve from the word stay with god's word of god hold to god's unchanging hand the cry of the holy spirit the rebuke to the age and at the same time this remedy for anyone who was turned from the word diverted swayed or bypassed the word is back to the word of god if you want to retain god's favor god's love god's anointing and god's blessing on your life your walk your growth in him the scabs from your eyes for like us like a baby they don't they don't just be born and their eyes are clear yeah the days pass you can see that whether it be in a puppy or some other animal pass and then the film constantly go from you amen seeing through a glass darkly but then god reveals and you begin to see you begin to recognize you begin to know what god is saying to the age in which we are living hallelujah but my friends it's getting darker and darker and now we are in the last church age revelation chapter 3 speaking of the odyssey and church age lukewarm wretched miserable naked blind undressing in the streets my god hallelujah god have mercy oh let's let's just let me leave that alone for now but we're living in the laodicean church age that lies era and a spiritual blackout is right now upon us where the people can hardly recognize the word of god but in the darkness the word says there shall come a day that is not dark nor light but at evening time it shall be light thank god hallelujah that is light coming again and the light comes from god and god himself is revealing himself by his word heavenly sunshine heavenly sunshine flooding my soul with the glory divine heavenly sunshine heavenly sunshine hallelujah jesus is mine it is my earnest prayer here today that we may all hear if god has given us an heir to hear may we hear what the spirit of god is bringing to us here by the by the air of the holy spirit what he is saying to us and surrender ourselves to him repent of our sins turn back from the lifestyle you were living and follow the lord jesus christ by the guidance of the word of god may god help every one of us as we come to the waters of baptism to be baptized in the correct name which is the name of jesus christ you know father is not a name i'm a father i'm the son of my mother that the son is not a name father that's not my name and i'm i'm a preacher i'm a pastor that still is not my name that's just my title that's my position that's who who i am as i as far as and god is a father yes god is a son because he created a body and lives in the body the same spirit of god not another person the same spirit of god came and lived in a body that's why jesus said i and my father are one the father that liveth in me he'd do it the works hallelujah amen and then on the day of calvary when they crucified him the bible said he gave up the ghost what goes the holy ghost for the holy spirit was in him praise god amen amen and then came back down to anoint the apostles one god hero israel the lord thy god is one lord peter acts chapter 2 for this jesus hallelujah jesus lord and christ hallelujah father son and holy ghost god in the father god in the son god in the holy spirit god the only one oh thank god i bless his holy name i praise him i magnify him god be with you god cover you under the shadow of his great wings of the great eagle shelter you in this time of storm watch over you and bring us together again on sunday morning when we lift up the name of jesus giving glory to his wonderful name god bless you real good [Music] you
