[28:43] testimony
[28:47] [Music]
[28:55] kings and Lord of lords
[28:57] you know I'm sure as you all you know I
[29:00] am and who is seeing me all are that you
[29:03] know our hearts are heavy in terms of
[29:04] the sudden loss of our dearly beloved
[29:06] sister Johnson and
[29:09] um it's on my heart to share you know
[29:11] two aspects of a testimony with you
[29:13] about her because if you read you know
[29:16] be reflecting on the same thing you know
[29:18] when these moments in time happen in our
[29:21] lives we just start thinking about that
[29:22] person and how much they've meant to us
[29:24] and our history with them
[29:27] may the Lord help me and I pray this
[29:29] testimony it would be a blessing to you
[29:32] and our dearly beloved sister I you know
[29:35] come to reflect in real life I've known
[29:37] her practically all my life
[29:38] when I first came to Canada as a young
[29:40] teenager from Jamaica my mom and my aunt
[29:43] my grand Aunt sister Dale as you all may
[29:45] remember her we're a believer that the
[29:48] Pentecostal Church Western United
[29:49] Pentecostal and they were there with
[29:52] sister Jonathan sister Gloria and those
[29:54] Believers at that time
[29:56] and so I came to first know her from the
[29:58] Pentecostal church back then
[30:01] and so we all went there for a few years
[30:03] and until our wonderful Lord you know
[30:06] called our dear sister Johnson out and
[30:08] she learned of this message of Malachi
[30:10] 4. and just like the woman at the well
[30:13] and like Philip who went to speak to
[30:14] Nathanael when she received this amazing
[30:17] word and you know the living word for
[30:19] today the fullness of the word right
[30:21] that God sent it through his prophet
[30:24] she left the Pentecostal Church behind
[30:26] and she came and became a part of this
[30:28] ministry right but then what did she do
[30:31] she told Gloria she told my grand Aunt
[30:34] sister Dale she told my mom and then by
[30:37] God's grace the Lord quickened them
[30:39] opened their eyes and they came and they
[30:42] were also here Fellowship him and then
[30:44] surely enough after a while me the
[30:46] teenage meme moved out of Pentecost and
[30:49] you know we did our worldly things for
[30:50] the times that we were doing that but
[30:53] then you know by God's grace the
[30:54] appointed time that he would open my
[30:56] eyes and would call me out from you know
[31:00] living a life that wasn't to glorifying
[31:02] him
[31:03] and sure enough he was my grand Aunt
[31:06] sister Dale but then who was my first
[31:08] bride to church our beloved sister
[31:10] Johnson because she was the one who was
[31:12] taken them to church for all those years
[31:14] and so the first time when I came to the
[31:16] ministry and I was able to go with them
[31:19] and she brought us so initially in my
[31:22] beginning stage of my conversion it was
[31:24] Mr Johnson who was taking me to church
[31:26] then eventually no brother Michael asari
[31:28] and his family right because her car was
[31:30] full which was a good thing a good
[31:32] problem to have for them brother Michael
[31:34] was a blessing to me all those years as
[31:37] well could then his family and on
[31:39] Tuesday nights I would go up with
[31:40] Gabriel over the Desmond
[31:42] so a blessing to them as well
[31:44] but by God's grace I look back and I
[31:46] realize wow you know how wonderful it
[31:48] was that the Lord called her but what
[31:50] did she do she went and she told her
[31:52] friends she told others within the
[31:54] denomination that no there's more
[31:56] there's this word of Malachi 4 the
[31:59] prophet that God has sent you know to
[32:00] open if our eye for this last day's
[32:03] message right but that was one aspect
[32:05] and how much of course you know through
[32:06] the years our dear sister had been such
[32:08] an amazing blessing to myself and family
[32:10] and of course if you know with her
[32:12] singing and in our choir and everything
[32:14] just um amazing wonderful sister right
[32:17] but then the other part of the testimony
[32:20] that I'd like to share and brother
[32:21] Anthony gave a sneak peek of it a moment
[32:23] ago if you may recall a couple weeks I
[32:25] mentioned that our sister you know our
[32:27] small group out of the you know the 40
[32:29] days of Prayer Ministry our small group
[32:31] continued and still continues to this
[32:33] day over a year later for the glory of
[32:35] God and so we continue to meet each week
[32:38] you know blessing each other and would
[32:40] you believe that the two weeks ago
[32:42] um you know in our fellowship we always
[32:45] will share a prayer request for each
[32:47] other and then take turns praying over
[32:48] that request so our two weeks ago when
[32:51] sister Johnson gave her prayer requested
[32:53] you know at that time it wasn't actually
[32:55] for her family you all know how much you
[32:57] were always praying for her family for
[32:59] the Lord to you know Quicken himself in
[33:01] them but this time our beloved sister
[33:03] was praying to be used by the Lord she
[33:07] was like she wants to wherever she goes
[33:09] that she can meet people and speak to
[33:11] people she's like she wants to be able
[33:13] to take new people to church because if
[33:15] you know she takes brother Abraham and
[33:16] family sister Jennifer but she was just
[33:18] Desiring to meet someone and her exact
[33:21] weather I must can go on the road if I'm
[33:23] at the store feed someone that I can
[33:25] speak to she says tell them about this
[33:27] wonderful message and bring them to
[33:29] church
[33:30] so at that time part of the reason why
[33:32] he stood out to me so much and I
[33:34] remember it so much is because I'm the
[33:35] one who prayed for that request and then
[33:37] of course by extension was praying from
[33:39] the rest of us in our group that the
[33:41] Lord would use us in that way so this
[33:43] was two weeks ago Thursday and that
[33:45] weekend that same weekend is when she
[33:47] was struck with the bell's palsy and so
[33:50] that the following Thursday which was
[33:52] you know a week ago now when we met you
[33:54] know by God's grace she came to the
[33:56] fellowship again and we prayed for her
[33:58] right and we were talking about that and
[34:00] we're a theme sister look you were
[34:02] praying for the Lord to use you to
[34:04] avenge life to be a witness and now the
[34:06] enemies strike in your body you can't
[34:08] drive anymore you know because of the
[34:11] condition she couldn't speak very well
[34:12] they said you wanted the Lord to use you
[34:14] to speak to others and to be able to
[34:16] take them to church and the enemy came
[34:18] and struck you physically and with your
[34:20] you know in your body but they said you
[34:23] know sister and of course we all prayed
[34:24] again believe in our Lord that he would
[34:25] heal her which we know he has and you
[34:28] know he delivered but I also now realize
[34:31] that of course our beloved sister has
[34:33] laid that down for us right and now we
[34:36] get to live that and we get to take that
[34:38] and then every time we go somewhere and
[34:41] we are able to be used of the Lord she
[34:43] was like Lord let there be somebody
[34:44] who's ready to receive this word that I
[34:46] could speak to them that with what she
[34:48] said so I wanted to share this for that
[34:50] we now we can take on that prayer we can
[34:53] take that mantle and every time there's
[34:55] an opportunity don't let the enemy give
[34:57] a self-doubt and let us hold back right
[34:59] but let us move forward and speak boldly
[35:01] as our sister would do to tell others
[35:03] and bring others to church amen if I
[35:06] wanted to share this with you to say
[35:07] that with her last prayer request within
[35:10] our group to be used of the Lord to be a
[35:12] blessing and I trust the Lord that by
[35:14] God's grave each time you witness it'll
[35:16] also be a testimony unto her for the
[35:18] glory of God so God bless you all
[35:22] Hallelujah
[35:28] when the road
[35:30] is
[35:31] [Music]
[35:50] [Music]
[35:53] foreign is
[36:02] [Music]
[36:15] [Music]
[36:19] [Applause]
[36:25] yeah
[36:27] thank you very much God bless you all
[36:31] it's wonderful to come into the house of
[36:35] God and hear the Cry of the Holy Spirit
[36:40] in the hearts of the Believers
[36:45] we certainly thank God for that
[36:48] that as I sat in the office and heard
[36:53] Believers worshiping singing bringing
[36:57] glory to God
[36:59] I can hear the voice of the spirit
[37:01] singing through them
[37:03] and glorifying uh his word we thank God
[37:08] for the presence of the Holy Spirit
[37:12] today we are gathered together
[37:15] and we are gathered here to have the
[37:19] Lord's Supper
[37:22] of course
[37:23] there are some that says it's the Lord's
[37:27] Supper so it should be you should take
[37:29] it in the night
[37:30] uh but the Bible says as often as you
[37:37] do as often as you come together as
[37:40] often as you want to right it doesn't
[37:44] lay any uh lines laws or restrictions on
[37:50] the time the day the place or whatever
[37:53] you can take it under a tree uh under
[37:56] this right circumstances so those are
[37:59] just legalistic human things
[38:02] using the Bible to enforce laws that God
[38:05] didn't put there there are no no laws in
[38:09] the New Testament we're not on the law
[38:11] we are on the grace
[38:14] and we are set free by the grace of God
[38:17] and by the Holy Spirit
[38:19] that doesn't mean we do foolishness
[38:22] it doesn't mean we become Lawless and
[38:24] rebellious but we keep to the word of
[38:28] God now I'm just speaking in general
[38:30] because for the true uh elect and
[38:33] Believers that is something that they
[38:36] don't even need an explanation for
[38:40] right but this is heard not just by you
[38:43] but by all so therefore we we need to
[38:47] know that that we are not here by
[38:49] tradition
[38:51] we are not here by practice or habit
[38:55] uh but we are here uh because we want to
[38:59] celebrate
[39:01] and memorialize
[39:03] uh the life of the Lord Jesus Christ
[39:08] because we are so thankful for what he
[39:11] has done for us
[39:12] and what he is now doing in US
[39:16] we are grateful to the Lord and we will
[39:18] ever be grateful
[39:20] and we will ever Praise Him and magnify
[39:23] his name throughout all the Eternal ages
[39:27] it will be an endless time of worship
[39:31] in the presence of the Living God
[39:35] now we have his presence with us partly
[39:39] because we see through a glass now
[39:42] Darkly
[39:44] so therefore we were in church maybe we
[39:46] are in the presence of the Lord
[39:48] but Satan with his distractions of life
[39:52] which we must participate in the systems
[39:55] around us
[39:57] we have to work we have to eat we have
[40:00] and then our minds slip away briefly to
[40:03] be able to accomplish that and sometimes
[40:06] in the middle of it if the word will
[40:08] take control comes back but what I'm
[40:11] saying we're going to a place where
[40:13] there'll be no distractions
[40:16] thank you
[40:16] there will be no time when your mind
[40:19] will be off of him
[40:22] because the Real the full realization
[40:24] that I and my father are one
[40:29] [Music]
[40:30] myself and God are one
[40:33] and the rivers run into the ocean amen
[40:37] and the ocean pushes back its life its
[40:41] power and its strength into the rivers
[40:43] so are we United with god with the life
[40:47] of God flowing from Deep to deep to deep
[40:50] from place to place believer to believe
[40:53] up that is how we begin to recognize
[40:56] that we are here praise God and His
[40:59] divine presence so I want you to know
[41:02] that that we are here uh of course
[41:07] thanking the lord for what he has done
[41:11] for us praise the Lord let me just get
[41:13] myself organized here a little bit
[41:15] praise God
[41:18] Hallelujah so when we come to this
[41:21] communion
[41:23] it's a powerful thing
[41:25] it's a living thing
[41:28] we come not to enter into the presence
[41:32] of an imaginary God
[41:34] but we are here in the presence of the
[41:37] Living God
[41:39] this great of power and presence of the
[41:42] person of Jesus Christ
[41:45] in the form of which he is in now
[41:48] amen praise the lord we come to reaffirm
[41:53] our faith and what we have said through
[41:58] our lifetime since we believed that this
[42:02] is what we believe we believe the word
[42:07] of God for this age and for this hour as
[42:10] expressed by God's prophet in this age
[42:14] and this time we are so thankful for
[42:17] that now
[42:19] I want you to know
[42:21] that we will continue to hold to the
[42:24] essence of our faith until he calls us
[42:28] home or we are raptured into the very
[42:30] presence of the Living God so let us
[42:34] hold this precious treasure as Paul said
[42:38] in our Earthly Tabernacles let us hold
[42:41] us in our hearts
[42:43] and preserve it there
[42:45] and keep the change
[42:49] don't let the parent presence of God
[42:52] flow out of you don't uh don't stop the
[42:57] bloodletting don't let the blood flow
[43:00] out from you but keep that change that
[43:03] the blood makes within your heart and
[43:06] within your life praise the name of the
[43:08] Living God hallelujah praise God now
[43:12] shall be stand to our faith
[43:15] faith and you may repeat after me
[43:20] because the question is what do we
[43:23] believe
[43:24] and who do we believe
[43:26] I know out there in the uh Church World
[43:31] they have the Apostles Creed but really
[43:34] that is not the real Apostles Creed
[43:37] because uh we do not stand on their lie
[43:42] of the trinity
[43:45] and three gods in one we believe one God
[43:49] expressing himself in three attributes
[43:53] offices
[43:55] is that right look I am a father I'm a
[43:58] son I'm a human being it doesn't make me
[44:00] treat people I'm the same person
[44:02] but those are my attributes those are my
[44:05] typos that I have that is how we believe
[44:08] amen so repeat after me I'll say it and
[44:12] then you repeat it aloud
[44:14] we believe in a revelation of one God
[44:22] the creator of Heaven and Earth
[44:26] get out
[44:28] we believe in the Lord Jesus Christ
[44:35] living in a human body
[44:39] Emmanuel
[44:44] God With Us
[44:47] we believe he was conceived by the
[44:50] spoken word
[44:55] that he suffered under Pontius Pilate
[45:01] was crucified dead and buried
[45:06] then rose again
[45:10] from the dead
[45:12] he ascended into heaven
[45:17] and is seated at the right hand of power
[45:22] [Applause]
[45:23] and from there he is coming again
[45:27] [Applause]
[45:27] [Music]
[45:29] the judge broke the living and the dead
[45:32] foreign
[45:33] [Music]
[45:34] we believe in the Holy Spirit
[45:38] [Music]
[45:39] who lives in the true church
[45:44] we believe in the Forgiveness of sins
[45:50] we believe in the resurrection of the
[45:54] body
[45:58] and life Everlasting amen
[46:03] praise God God bless you please be
[46:06] seated
[46:11] you know while Jesus was here one of the
[46:14] last things he did
[46:16] he appeared to when he rose from the
[46:19] dead he appeared before the disciples in
[46:25] the little room
[46:27] and in that little room he spoke peace
[46:30] to their hearts because the first thing
[46:34] that words from his mouth that they
[46:37] heard was peace be unto you
[46:41] amen peace be unto you and I believe
[46:45] that communion or this time of communion
[46:49] with the Lord and with my fellow
[46:52] Believers is a good time for us to
[46:56] express and experience the peace of God
[47:00] within our hearts and within our lives
[47:03] amen praise God I believe it's also a
[47:07] good time
[47:09] for us to be able to forgive one another
[47:13] if there is anything to forgive
[47:16] but it's a wonderful time for us to
[47:20] forgive one another
[47:22] and let the Lord work within our lives
[47:26] I believe also it's a time we can use it
[47:29] as a time of restoration
[47:33] restoring relationships
[47:36] relation
[47:37] restoring friendships different
[47:41] situations that may be in our lives
[47:46] praise God so my friends
[47:50] I want to say
[47:52] like Jesus
[47:54] peace be unto you
[47:58] let me repeat it I want to say like he
[48:01] said when he walked into the little room
[48:03] he said Peace be unto you May the peace
[48:07] of God Rest remain and abide with you

[50:58] positions
[51:02] praise the Lord you please be seated now
[51:05] God bless you real good
[51:14] amen
[51:19] now we will have the Lord's Supper not
[51:23] right now but take your position here
[51:26] praise the Lord
[51:28] amen
[51:38] now we are not in a hurry are we
[51:42] this is a sacred time in the presence of
[51:45] the Lord
[51:46] so we we are not in a hurry that doesn't
[51:49] mean I'm going to keep you until later
[51:50] this afternoon
[51:53] I did not process a period of time that
[51:56] I'm going to do this in but I believe
[51:59] the Lord is in charge of that
[52:02] but it's certainly will be before or by
[52:07] one o'clock but we will do what we have
[52:10] to do if it finishes before then praise
[52:13] the Lord if it finishes right then amen
[52:16] wonderful praise the Lord
[52:19] as these stewards brings the emblems to
[52:24] the front and the elders are standing
[52:28] here in position it just reminds me of
[52:33] the elders that were by The Throne of
[52:35] God in heaven
[52:37] standing by throne and worshiping and
[52:40] honoring the lamb and giving Glory To
[52:43] His Marvelous and wonderful name I just
[52:46] love this this type of worship we're in
[52:51] the quietness and the Simplicity of this
[52:53] hour we can experience the love the
[52:57] Comfort the warmth and the presence of a
[53:00] not a dead God but a living God who
[53:03] works and moves among us to confirm the
[53:07] word that was given to us praise God and
[53:10] for this is why we are gathered to bring
[53:12] Glory praise and honor to his mighty
[53:15] name
[53:16] amen yes sir how I love him with all my
[53:22] heart praise God Amen now what we are
[53:26] going to do a little differently today
[53:30] is that I will the Lord will help me to
[53:34] bless the emblems that are before us
[53:38] they'll be on the table here before us
[53:41] and then what will happen is that the
[53:47] elders will go forth and serve you not
[53:50] both of them at the same time but the
[53:54] bread will be distributed first you will
[53:58] then hold that
[54:01] after which
[54:03] there'll be some remarks blessing
[54:05] and then the Elder with the wine will
[54:09] then go forth and distribute that
[54:12] of course they will need assistance
[54:16] and that means that that Elder will be
[54:19] going down this aisle
[54:21] and some assistant will be on the other
[54:25] side so that the plate can go back and
[54:29] forth on Hinder
[54:32] and as swiftly as possible
[54:35] okay is this being understood
[54:39] all right praise God and we we know that
[54:42] because uh this is not to be entered
[54:45] into lightly
[54:47] uh it's not to be entered into uh
[54:50] something frivolously this is not Coke
[54:53] and crackers
[54:57] this is the bread and wine has given to
[55:02] us by the Lord Jesus Christ
[55:06] and when I say Bread and Wine literal
[55:10] bread
[55:11] and real wine
[55:14] not grape juice or Pepsi or something
[55:18] like that but the real wine
[55:22] and there's a reason why he said that
[55:25] because he said I am the bread of life
[55:29] if a man eat of me he will live forever
[55:33] is that right we believe that now the
[55:37] wine with the stimulative effects is to
[55:42] represent the Holy Spirit
[55:44] who comes into our lives to Quicken us
[55:47] to a better life
[55:48] to an empowered life
[55:50] amen and to go forth amongst the people
[55:54] that are permeating influence
[55:56] that will stimulate their lives and
[56:00] cause them to want to live and walk with
[56:03] God
[56:04] so it is important also
[56:08] we must not take it lightly
[56:11] where you know that we must as Believers
[56:15] or as people we ought to be conscious of
[56:19] having a right relationship with God
[56:23] and with each other
[56:25] so as we come let us bear these things
[56:29] in mind
[56:30] that we our relationship is right but
[56:33] God you say well brother Simon I know
[56:35] I've done this last week or yes he says
[56:39] now even if that is the case let a man
[56:42] or a woman a person examine themselves
[56:47] uh you don't need me to come and
[56:50] examine you or ask you what you did you
[56:55] don't need to confess to me
[56:58] you need to confess in your heart to him
[57:01] and he knows all things
[57:03] so so we we don't take this lightly it's
[57:07] a supernatural uh operation of the Holy
[57:12] Spirit taking place even right now while
[57:15] we are gathered here together
[57:17] I'm just a representative standing here
[57:19] to be a voice for him that he may
[57:22] receive all the praise and honor and
[57:24] Glory
[57:25] and we are here to hear his voice and to
[57:28] obey his voice and for him to have his
[57:32] honor that is due to his wonderful and
[57:36] marvelous name oh praise God I want to
[57:40] make also clear to you
[57:43] uh many churches have closed communion
[57:47] and what that mean is only their members
[57:51] are allowed to partake or participate
[57:54] only people that they know are can
[57:58] participate but that is to say that we
[58:01] can judge who is right and who is not
[58:03] right who's living right and who is not
[58:06] living right that's not for me to do
[58:08] that's not for any man to do God knows
[58:12] the heart
[58:14] and he is the one that takes care of
[58:16] that as that is one of the main reasons
[58:19] why we have open communion
[58:24] the communion worship and service is
[58:26] open to all
[58:28] anyone
[58:30] but let me I say it you take it at your
[58:33] own risk
[58:34] for the Bible says if a man or a woman
[58:38] does not examine themselves
[58:41] and they because you can repent he says
[58:45] you repent you get rid of those things
[58:47] even instantly in his presence and go
[58:50] ahead and take the communion is that
[58:52] right but if the person rejects Rebels
[58:56] and does not want to uh receive the word
[59:01] of God he says that's the reason why
[59:04] many are sick
[59:06] and why many sleep
[59:08] that are amongst you because of unbelief
[59:13] and Rebellion against the word of God
[59:15] therefore let us be sure while I'm even
[59:18] talking while the service is in progress
[59:22] that we examine ourselves
[59:25] let me search our own hearts as the
[59:28] songwriter says search me o God
[59:31] and know my heart today
[59:35] oh praise God may God search your hearts
[59:39] mate we search our own hearts
[59:43] and ask the great Holy Spirit praise the
[59:47] Lord to search US cleanse us and make us
[59:51] into whom we should be you say oh but
[59:54] I've done this great sin I don't done
[59:56] well if you just take it lightly that's
[59:58] up to you but let me tell you there is
[1:00:01] no sin no wrong that is so great that
[1:00:04] God can't forgive and won't forgive
[1:00:08] Paul who killed Christians
[1:00:12] slaughtered them
[1:00:14] turned around and was was comforted and
[1:00:18] became a real believer and more than
[1:00:21] that made an apostle of the Living God
[1:00:24] Paul raised his hand to heaven and said
[1:00:27] oh Lord God I am the chief of sinners
[1:00:31] [Music]
[1:00:32] the chief of Sinners and yet God
[1:00:35] accepted him washed him cleansed him
[1:00:39] forgave him and brought him into his
[1:00:42] kingdom the same one who said Comfort
[1:00:45] one another with these words brethren we
[1:00:49] are not here for long because the Lord
[1:00:52] himself was promised he would descend
[1:00:55] with a shout the voice of the Archangel
[1:00:58] and the Trump of God
[1:01:00] we which those that are dead will be
[1:01:03] raised up
[1:01:04] and we who are alive will be caught up
[1:01:07] in the presence of God in the twinkling
[1:01:09] of an eye there shall we forever be with
[1:01:13] the Lord do you believe it
[1:01:16] I believe it
[1:01:18] that is the reason why with the whole
[1:01:20] heart from my from 12 years old to this
[1:01:25] time amen and I'm not ashamed of my age
[1:01:28] to seven to seven
[1:01:30] I'm telling you this is real this is not
[1:01:34] a religious thought this is not a
[1:01:36] feeling but this is a reality that is
[1:01:40] within the heart of the True Believer
[1:01:42] he's coming again according to his
[1:01:45] promise
[1:01:47] this Bible amen blessed be the name of
[1:01:50] the Lord praise God hallelujah so I've
[1:01:54] made that clear that we have an open
[1:01:58] communion
[1:02:00] now now I will come and I will ask God's
[1:02:05] blessing upon the bread that is right
[1:02:10] here before Us Praise the Lord
[1:02:12] hallelujah
[1:02:20] praise the Lord
[1:02:22] thank you brother
[1:02:25] praise the Lord God bless you just to
[1:02:27] show you that it is real bread
[1:02:30] but because of our time I'm covering it
[1:02:32] again okay I want you to know that this
[1:02:36] is the bread and now this bread as I say
[1:02:41] as some believe
[1:02:43] that miraculously and mysteriously this
[1:02:46] bread turns into the body of Jesus
[1:02:50] now the scripture doesn't say that
[1:02:53] he says take it in remembrance of me
[1:02:58] the bread only represents
[1:03:02] his broken body
[1:03:04] his bruised bleeding and crucified body
[1:03:09] this is what this bread represents
[1:03:14] one man was testifying uh how that
[1:03:20] people were saying why do you take so
[1:03:23] long to take the Lord's Supper
[1:03:25] and he answered and said because when I
[1:03:28] take the bread and I start chewing it
[1:03:31] takes me about two three minutes to do
[1:03:35] that because it's not just chewing on
[1:03:38] the outside but I'm thinking on the
[1:03:41] inside and praying on the inside and
[1:03:43] thinking on the inside for what he has
[1:03:46] done for me through the broken bread
[1:03:49] as Isaiah said he was bruised for a or
[1:03:54] our transgressions amen he is the one
[1:03:58] that took on all our iniquities and by
[1:04:01] his stripes
[1:04:03] we are healed so we thank God for this
[1:04:07] and we give him praise honor and Glory
[1:04:10] so this is the bread given the Lord says
[1:04:14] it was broken for you not for him but it
[1:04:18] was broken for you and may God bless
[1:04:22] sanctify this bread here today let us
[1:04:26] pray
[1:04:28] are gracious and eternal God and
[1:04:30] Heavenly Father
[1:04:32] as we raise up before you this platter
[1:04:37] of bread broken for you
[1:04:41] we pray that the Holy Spirit of the
[1:04:44] Living God will his presence will come
[1:04:48] upon this
[1:04:49] blessed sanctify it use it father this
[1:04:54] emblem that you ordained use it for your
[1:04:58] glory and for your honor that you may
[1:05:00] even heal your Earthly body touch your
[1:05:04] people and bless them as we partake of
[1:05:08] this which you have given as our Elder
[1:05:11] now begins with some help to distribute
[1:05:16] this bread I ask you just to hold it and
[1:05:20] wait until the wine is distributed
[1:05:27] I'm going to ask the musicians to come
[1:05:31] up and play some appropriate music in
[1:05:34] the background while all this is going
[1:05:36] on you will be served also amen
[1:06:07] he was nailed to the cross for you me
[1:06:13] he was nailed to the cross for me
[1:06:19] on the cross crucified for me he died he
[1:06:26] was nailed to the cross

[1:38:20] God so everything should be expeditious

[1:38:32] May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:38:36] a great love of God

[1:38:49] as the scripture says in second
[1:38:51] Corinthians 13 14.
