lord jesus just feeling good tonight by the grace of god feeling the atmosphere feeling the joy of the lord because um we rely on the lord's strength in our lives and when you get to a place where you rely on his strength you know you might be strong you're young you still got the you know the muscles and stuff like that but as you as you get you know on in your life and you know you start getting close to rh you know where you break 50 and then um and then some right you start to you start to really rely on god's strength in your life because you start to realize that hey i'm not i don't have the energy like i had you know i just you know the the the pressures of life don't stop but yet you know we got uh the grace of god in our lives that we can keep pressing on and and once you rely on his strength it brings joy it brings joy into your life it's just automatic okay and the scripture even says it right his strength brings us joy hallelujah glory to god so praise god tonight we're going to continue uh with what we started last wednesday night um we were talking about uh you put up the first slide we were talking about that this is your time to recognize your day and you know uh there's so much in there for us um you know because sometimes what ends up happening especially in the ranks of this message a lot of people think that oh recognize your day and it's message and all they're thinking about is alleluia praise god i recognize that god sent the prophet and you know the seals would have been open and you know the church ages and the history and you could get to know everything about the message of the hour not realizing that you are the message of the hour and that your part and your time and that your season has to be recognized amen that's what brings perfect faith so that we can experience the rapture age and so the first scripture talks about that we read and i'll just i'll read it really quickly here because it'll recap and then lead us into the next stage of this message but it says here in second peter 1 15 to 9 that moreover i will endeavor that you may be able after my decrease to have these things always in remembrance see peter recognized that there was something that he experienced in his time and season and that that that we had to come into ours and so he says for we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and the coming of our lord jesus christ but we're eyewitnesses of his majesty and you now you know at this stage in your walk with god you got to be recognizing that you're an eyewitness that you're seeing the supernatural you're not just you're not you're not just hearing everything you're actually experiencing it amen and so that's what you know he was he was an eyewitness for he received from god the father honor and glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory see he was there he heard he saw he saw that god said this is my beloved son this is the this is the body that i've chosen to come and live in here on this earth amen and so uh when there came such a voice this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we heard and we were with him in the holy mount we have also a more sure word of prophecy where unto ye do well that ye take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts see he realized that there was dispensational changes there was darkness and then came light there came revelation for him to recognize who he was his time his season he even realized that he made mistakes he even realized that he denied the lord he realized all those things but then the the revelation struck him clearly that hey i need to know my time i need to know my season this is my visitation this is why i'm this is why i'm on this earth praise god amen you know so knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation that sums it all up it's god is his own interpreter god's gonna live through you god's gonna manifest through you god's gonna reveal his word his time his season in your life for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of god spake oh glory to god as they were moved by the holy spirit the holy ghost let us pray father we so appreciate your word your presence tonight lord we know that you know our hearts our needs whether we are present whether we are out there listening in from from the internet father lord you know every single one of us you know our time you know our season you know the word that we need to hear tonight it'll change our walks and lord we will just commit it all into your hands now lord let your spirit come anoint the atmospheres speaker and hearer in jesus name amen god bless you saints you may be seated and so uh the next slide just a real quick recap and then we'll move on here brother branham speaking here that you know in the message god is his own interpreter he says now all we are today is the display of his attributes what a beautiful just there was so much in that message you know like like you got to go back and listen to it again it's only 55 minutes or so you got to listen to it a few times like i did and it just kept just opening up and just making it so clear that we are god's interpretation of his word for this hour and that you coming into your position your realization is perfect faith that's going to bring an automatic transformation an automatic uh change in your life all the things that are around your life whatever circumstances conditions satan has put around your life or or generational spirits that have been around your life whatever it is that's that's hindering your walk in any way shape or form it's got to be moved it's got to be set aside it's got to be blown out of the water by revelation when you come into this when you realize that god is in you it's your hope of glory amen and so he talks about here how we are his attributes you know and then he talks about oh god was not even god but he was you know we just call him the eternal one he wasn't god because the word english word god means object of worship and there was nothing to worship him so he was the eternal one the main fountain of all intelligence and in this fountain of all intelligence there was not an atom molecule or nothing light nowhere star moon nothing else god what we know as god the great spirit that was eternal never did begin never did end he was there and in him was attributes attributes to be a god attributes uh to be god then his attributes to be a father attributes to be a son attributes to be a savior attributes to be a healer all these attributes was in him and now these things that has unfolded since then are just his attributes being made manifest so it's always been him it's always christ it's everything that you're looking for that's why he's your strength he's your shield you know if you're heavy laden and your burden you need to come to the lord because he'll give you strength he'll give you rest you come into that you know you come into that place as you walk with god that your walk with god is something that that that you have to die out to all your own interpretations all your your old ideas of what it is to be you know to even be a christian to be a christian is to know that christ in the power of his resurrection lives in you amen praise god and so let's just move on let's go down to now we're gonna we're gonna just keep moving along here let's go to slide number seven slide number seven please ephesians chapter 6 because you know as we have come and awakened from this darkness okay and we've come into the light of god's word then we also come to realize that because of that darkness we can shine you need to know that as long as you're in this dimension you're going to have to face an enemy a lot of people think oh you know it's okay god is with me i don't have to worry about nothing no no that's not what the word said the word says in ephesians chapter 6 put on the whole armor of god that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil you know when i saw wiles i said you know that that that got me stirred i started to do some research i wanted to find out what this was all about for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world look against spiritual wickedness in high places a lot of people think oh yeah you know the the pope and the and the whole you know system and you know the highest powers on earth and he controls the money and he's the wealthiest you know the the vatican is the wealthiest organization in the world and you know and and we start looking at all of that and and thinking that these are these are the the the the the spiritual wicked yeah it is spiritual wickedness in high places but there's a lot higher places than that and you know where they are right in the ranks of this realm of the message listen how could it be so deceiving that it would deceive even the very elect where are the elect the elector in this message the elect have been called and have recognized their day and its message the elect are the ones that that are that are uh moving in the highest levels of revelation and satan he moves in those ranks too so let's look at this wiles of the devil next next slide do we have the air conditioning on a little better like just a little bit more yeah a little down a little cooler whiles are tricks or manipulations designed to deceive someone that's what wiles are okay you know there's a tongue-in-cheek phrase a woman's wiles refers to the seductiveness of fem fatales in using charm or sex appeal to elicit a desired response from a man satan uses his wiles we're going to look at those things here tonight this is this is wednesday night right bible study we're going to look at certain things because these things expose great uh you know traps and and uh and situations that satan tries to place around our lives because you know remember you're going to come into the light you're going to recognize you're going to you're going to recognize your day and your time when that happens you're going to realize that holy smokes the gates of hell are coming against me you're going to realize that you're going to have to overcome that's what the overcomer the the overcomer in this hour has to overcome you know it isn't just oh i'm a christian hallelujah i go to church and everything's fine yeah right the enemy is going to attack you every single day and unless you are prepared in your mind and you are aware of how the wiles of the enemy work you're going to be you're going to be busy just constantly getting out of traps you know you know people are saying oh i don't got enough money this month i'm constantly i need more money i need you know oh my relationships are falling apart you know satan keeps you so occupied on all those things so that he can keep you in a defeated condition so that you can't really be effective in the kingdom of god but when you realize who you are you start to wake up you start to realize hey wait a minute here be so deceiving that it would deceive even the very elect and if you see yourself in the word and you know that you're elected because this is not a time to you know to be like oh i wonder if i'm a christian or i wonder if i'm saved i wonder wonder what you know what you're in wonderland you've been on too many rides you're dizzy from the rides this is real god is real god is going to perform his word god listen all the situations that are going on out there in the world i was telling my own brother today i said len you know we're talking about certain things about you know planning and and all these things you know with investments and everything else i said len i want to make something clear here i said we are living in perilous times anything can happen things could change overnight who would have thought that we'd be in a war right now in ukraine where a whole country was literally taken over and and people were were scattered right from like millions of people 25 30 million people like you know like these are different times things could change like that and we also know that there is prophecy that is not going to make things get better things are going to get worse the world's going to go into great tribulation i imagine those people in ukraine are experiencing great tribulation but the whole world is going to experience that there's going to be a great change over the whole earth and and it's not going to get better there's going to be any an economic collapse scriptural written in the word of god you can't change it i can't change it no matter how we look at it we've got to recognize the day that we're living in and recognize that that this walk and this calling upon your life was not by accident god has a purpose for you god has a place for you in the word of god god has a portion of the word that you must fulfill whether you are young whether you are old regardless if you are an attribute of god it is god in you performing the word [Applause] hallelujah and so wilds of the devil are those clever schemes used by satan to ensnare us through temptation threat or intimidation so we're going to look at some of these right now hmm what would i do with my book okay i need a brother to go into the uh into the deacon's office please i got my notes there i brought my computer and forgot my notes here you got the key for the deacon's office it's on my desk so so so because i just had a few notes on on these four you know areas and examples of the wiles of the devil and i want to look at them and just give you some examples of how you know how they work in our lives and how it is that satan tries to you know get you off track you know challenging god's word you know satan's going to challenge god's word in your life you know things are going to come around you that are going to challenge you you know to to make you wonder if it is that what you believe is the truth you know like oh geez you know i really wonder if this message you know like what is is it for real you know is you know he's gonna he's gonna use every possible tactic to get you off the word of god to get you intimidated to get you thinking that you you know like you you know you you just been been fooled right praise god no it's the it's the folder excuse me for one moment saints it's right there sitting on my desk praise god amen and so so challenging you on the word of god and so here i want you to recognize back in genesis chapter 3 it gives us a detailed look into the tactics of the enemy right it led the first human to sin and satan still uses it because it works so well and the and the first recorded word of the devil through the serpent was this did god really say you know did god really see these things with with those words the devil invited the woman to reconsider what she understood god to have said by adding her human interpretation on the word and remember this is all about understanding that god is his own interpreter you're not to put any interpretation on the word you're not to try and reason with the word you're not to try and and figure out the word this is the season and the time where the word is revealed the word is given by revelation it is it is the gates of hell cannot prevail against revelation amen he'll listen it'll prevail against all kinds of other things in your life when you operate from the human senses from your own ability that you think that you can oh i can do this i can do this you can't do it this is the hour where if god doesn't do it in you because of your communication your consciousness of god in your life that you're yielded enough because remember satan is going to test you with pride he's going to get you you know he'll come to you and he'll start you know hitting you with certain things you'll hear certain things that's why you got to be careful this is not the hour where you got to get into into religious disputes with people and try to convince them to believe the word of god you can't convince anybody to believe god's word this is the hour where the gates of hell will not prevail against revelation it is something that must be revealed divinely to you as an individual that's the only way you're going to have the confidence to face the wiles of the enemy hallelujah he was suggesting that we should re-examine the clear teachings of god's word satan invites you to add your own interpretation to the word of god don't do it this is the time where you don't add any interpretation let him interpret it for you let him fight your battles let him be the interpreter when somebody challenges you that's why he said don't you don't have to say nothing be still and know that i am god listen god is gonna he's gonna have a supernatural human race here upon the earth that's called the bride of christ that's gonna have supernatural moving around her life things will come into place you will notice these things if you're if you're if you're conscious and you're constantly aware of god in your life i'm telling you start from tonight from this moment to be aware of how things come together sometimes you think that man how did that all come together is because god is working things out in order to place you properly so that you can recognize that you're a son or a daughter of god without you realizing and recognizing that you're going to be in a defeated condition you're not going to be of any real service to the body of christ when people get together to fellowship with you they're getting discouraged instead of encouraged because of your fellowship because of your attitude because of your pride because of your you know your human understandings and and so forth don't interpret or put any interpretation and that's why god really says there's only you know uh clearly one thing we need to do and that is to put on the whole armor of god the whole armor realize that these wiles of the devil are going to come and the second thing he does is he starts to challenge your identity you're not a son of god you're not a daughter of god look at you look it's look at the way you acted he'll bring up every little thing when you say something when you do something watch out the devil is going to use that man i see examples of that all the time oh you know i said this and i wonder if they took this in the wrong way and before you know it that person is in a wild devil's wind of of battle in their mind trying to overcome because the devil knows where to attack right he knows where to hit you right between the ears the greatest battle is going to be right in your all you said this and now you are going to pay what a devil you know he'll try to he'll try to get you and and say to you see you are not a son of god you you you make those kind of mistakes and you call yourself a son of god if you're aware like that and you're having that battle it's because you are a son of god if you're in the midst of that wild world when it's because you are a son or a daughter of god it's because the devil wants to get you defeated and and become useless but you as a son or a daughter of god you'll come to a place where that revelation will strike and the gates of hell will not prevail and you'll walk away from that situation like it never existed amen glory to god amen that just fed me challenging our identity gives insight into several of the devils while satan came against jesus to tempt him in the wilderness on two different occasions satan began his temptations with these words if you are the son of god if you are a son of god hallelujah satan knew exactly who jesus was let me tell you he knew but he wanted to get him off track jesus jesus was there when satan fell like lightning from heaven hallelujah and and and significantly the devil chose a time when jesus was physically weak and hungry to attack his identity i'm going to tell you guys something i'm going to recommend you get proper sleep what is this is this a church service or is this 30 minutes with dr dan you need to get your sleep i watch that now i have to be careful my wife wonders you know where are you going it's 8 30 i said i'm going to sleep i go i gotta i got i feel i feel mentally exhausted and tired and even last night right after last night i was dealing with a with a real estate transaction and and things you know like i was up from 4am tuesday morning down at the market loading flowers delivering to brampton i was and then this deal comes along and we're negotiating and we're back and forth and there was some some confusion in the midst of it and i even felt myself starting to get a little agitated and i said i sent a text to the to the to the group and i said i'm going to bed i said we will deal with this in the morning they were thinking we got we got we got the deal we're gonna make it tonight i said no in my mind i said no that's it it was so clear to me get to bed now and i went to sleep and then they continued texting i didn't care my phone went off i went to bed i woke up this morning the deal was done the deal was done i just had to do my final part that i knew i had to do which i already knew was gonna was gonna happen and so i just did it everything got done the deal got done i i realized that i don't need to be tempted and brought into because i could have got hot last night from the from the from being so tired you guys you got to realize you'll get tired you'll get weak be careful of those times and understand that you have to step back and you got to se you got to separate yourself from the situation and you need to make sure you get your rest do not push yourself oh i got to make the money i don't care i need four jobs no no things will get worse if you do that you're not trusting god you're not relying on the grace of god in your life and so it it takes it takes understanding that you need certain you're still in a human body you're still human you're still got you still got to be fed you still gotta eat you still gotta sleep one of the things that's most powerful that i realize is you need your sleep so make sure you're getting it so that you can be sharp because the wiles of the devil is going to be moving constantly trying to get you and deceive you challenging your identity satan does the same thing to us to make his wiles more effective he hits us during a crisis or spiritual struggle and suggests if you were a child of god this wouldn't have happened to you no the reason why it's happening to you most of the time is because you are a child of god it's because he's always trying to set us back he's always trying to do things but if you do your part and this one thing i know by experience you do your part you know that you've done all that you can the scripture says do all that you can and then stand and let the lord interpret it he will interpret his word he will allow his perfect will to take place in your life we start to run off and oh this this is how i see it this is how i'm going to do it and it might even look good and it might and god will say it's it's not my perfect will it's my permissive will because you're so stubborn you know because you always want to do it your way you always got to have the last say you always gotta you know no just step back and understand that this is the time in the season where god is gonna do it for you provided you've done all that you can a lot of people say oh well god's in control i don't need to do nothing i got to make a payment at the end of the month it's 1600 for rent the boss is offering me 40 hours a week i don't feel like working this week i don't feel like working this week i don't feel like doing that they change my position i don't feel like doing that well praise god if god gives you enough [Music] funds in the bank that you can live for the next two years without worrying about a job and you got the right attitude you can take a vacation for a year or two years praise god that's a great sabbatical god will use it god will do things in your life he'll do whatever he needs to do but if you are relying on that paycheck and then you don't feel like work i know people like that and i and i i don't say anything i said what the heck am i going to say they need the money they want the money i call them into work they don't want to work [Laughter] but it's it's just the way of the world you know it's just it's just a way but satan he works on these areas amen twisting scripture another of the wows of the devil used against jesus was to quote scripture but with a twist you know you know you we there's a lot of examples in in luke satan quotes in psalms 91 in an effort to persuade jesus to act in the flesh rather than to follow the spirit but satan failed to complete the thought of the psalm the next verse in in psalms 91 13 says you will tread on the lion and the cobra you will trample the great lion and the serpent those animal references are metaphors for fierce and dangerous enemies and the devil is likened unto both a lion and a serpent in the scripture but satan will come into if you be the son of god why don't you just throw yourself off you know the true meaning of of of the passage of psalms 91 is that god will protect and empower his servants as they overcome the enemy as you overcome now overcoming is something that you have to do look at the word overcome overcome means it's something you gotta do not something that you just rely on god to do no you overcome by resisting the enemy resisting the devil and then god comes on the scene and he empowers you and protects you because you're his servant one of the wows of the devil is to leave out key parts of scripture in order to twist its meaning to fit his agenda praise god glory to god offering a tempting alternative you know that's you know another amazing scheme or while of the devil used when he used the temptation of jesus was to suggest another path avoiding strict obedience to god's will cunningly satan knew better than to to just suggest that jesus forget the whole plan of salvation he just used something to twist them away from it and go back to heaven instead he offered an alternative and the devil led him up to a high place and showed him an instant all the kingdoms of the world and he said to him i will give you all their authority and splendor because it's been given to me you know and satan is going to tempt you in those areas especially you businessmen you know as you mature as a businessman and you grow financially in the lord satan is going to do things around your life he's going to try to set up certain traps you know to get you looking you know to to to you know this possibility of you know but you know what you're gonna have to do this to get there you're gonna have to use a little bit of mumble jumbo business dealings you're gonna have to go off in this area here and you're gonna have to be see he's trying to use his power because remember he is the god of this world of this world god is the god of the whole plan the universe he's he's almighty god satan is just a god here on earth because he has so much power and influence in government and they control the money systems that's why what you see and what you're witnessing right now is a perfect example of how satan controls the money systems they release money by lowering interest rates when they lower interest rates money flows into the economy people get money easily they borrow money companies borrow money so cheap it's never been like it was the last 10 years zero percent interest rates it never got to those that's historical because it's the big setup it's the big setup for the big climax but they were releasing money into the system into the world and economically the everywhere you go look at look what happened just in the last five years you know that real estate prices doubled it took previously 30 to 50 years for something like that to happen and they did it in five years they inflated assets to extreme ridiculous why how they release money into the system and the more they release the more the people oh it's cheap oh i got a line of credit on my house it's only at one percent 1.5 it's cheap money i'll just take it invested in the stock market my buddy said he made 30 last month on his money my god i haven't made 30 of my money in five years or 20 years i you know i i got to do this and they start getting caught into the trap do you know what the biggest trap right now is debt it's the biggest trap it's got people so deceived and now what are they doing they're pulling their money back how are they pulling their money back by raising interest rates have you noticed that the stock market has lost about 28 percent in the last five months have you noticed that the the real estate market is starting to crumble it's starting to lose its glitter all those multiple offers they're gone they're gone it's like it's like it happened overnight i'm in it i see it it's like somebody just turned off a switch and it's like boop what's going on here houses that were selling for 1.5 million dollars three months ago are on the market today for 1.250 that's a quarter million dollars less in three months that's only the beginning why because they're pulling back their money satan's system is pulling back so that it gets people trapped and now they're trapped and people bought these homes they put 200 000 down it took them 40 years 30 years some of them are you know like you know adults they're just coming into their first home they're 35 40 years old and they save a couple hundred thousand dollars honey the real estate market just keeps going higher we got to get in yes you should have been getting in how do you time something like that you can't time anything because you're not fighting against flesh and blood you're fighting against powers principalities and dominions in high places there's there's financial control that's taking place in high places they don't care about the average person they go and save their 200 thousand they go buy that house they get into a bidding war they end up paying a hundred thousand more than they should have but because the interest rates are so low they qualify for the mortgage and they say honey we still qualify for the mortgage and two months later when they got to close the deal the bank goes and does an appraisal on that house and finds out that the same house down the street just sold for two hundred thousand dollars less it's happening i'm telling you all of a sudden their whole their whole world is just falling apart you mean all my equity the bank says you got to come up with another 200 000 because your 200 000 down is not enough now you qualified based on a value of 1.4 million what you paid when the market was there but now the market has changed and the banks do not care they're ruthless they go based on what the computer program tells them the profile they do not qualify it's that simple the appraisal came in they input the number into the computer it's irrelevant it's just boom the number comes out wait a minute they don't qualify and this is how this world is being so so here's another thing that that we need to be aware of be aware of how the devil is going to try and trap in certain ways in certain areas right now the there's there's a there's a shift taking place in the financial world and we need to be aware we need to be aware so that we don't get caught and we end up you know falling under the temptations because he's trying to give you an uh an alternative temptation to get rich oh everybody's been making money in the stock market everybody's been making money i remember last year everybody was like man my portfolio just keeps going higher old people were saying holy smokes man my portfolio just went up another 50 000 last month you know now a year later they don't want to talk about it it's like the whole year like everything got wiped out just like like literally overnight and it's happening and people are are like now and that's why these are these are very very scary times amen let's let's look at the next slide so we've looked at at these uh you know say listen one in in just in in winding down this whole area of the wiles of the devil understand something satan's n is already known it's already known okay so so be aware of this you know because it kind of balances things out for you because you might be in certain situations you might be in certain conditions but that's not the end for you there he's going to be bound for a thousand years so it's already everything is is already in place but the thing is we're still here we're still in this dimension and just like a rattlesnake do you know that they've they've cut the head off of a rattlesnake and thought that you know that that rattlesnake was dead but but the head was still very active and there's been countless numbers of people that got bitten by rattlesnakes whose heads were cut off and still ended up dying okay that devil he's got an end but while we are here we need to recognize that he's still causing havoc because though his head is cut off he ain't dead yet he ain't bound up yet he ain't locked up yet so you need to realize that as a son of god amen so brother branham speaking here he says now in in the stature of a perfect man he says now that is the house that god dwells in not a building with a big bell on top of it and a high steeple see but a body has thou prepared for me see now we're gonna we're just we're just looking and we're moving along here and we're phasing into how god is his own interpreter now that we've kind of exposed some of the wiles of the devil right now we can move on to realize who we are and keep our focus and understanding that it's christ in you your hope of glory that's how you are going to overcome in this hour by knowing that god is his own interpreter a body has thou prepared me a body that god can dwell in god can walk in god can see it god can talk in god can work in living instrumentally of god you see god is working in your life when you go to work in the morning god goes to work with you in the morning i love that i i listen i walk down to the sometimes i gotta walk into the food terminal and i'm looking for certain things and i didn't rebook it i didn't you know i wasn't prepared i missed i missed calling the person because everything just happened so quickly and i just gotta walk but i i walk and i and i'm thinking lord i'm walking with you you're gonna send me exactly where i need to go i need these products these items i would love it you know and i talk just like that i'm walking them it's like why not i believe this word do you believe this word you believe you're walking with god all things are possible to them that glory to god so why not walk believing walk and then you all of a sudden you go there hey dan dan i'll go over there yeah yeah yeah says you need any of this somebody just canceled the order it's a hot item somebody just canceled the order i said yeah i said what's the price this much it's too much in my mind i'll say i'll take it all you see god gave me that i don't need to argue and sometimes there's a time for for there's a time and a season for everything and this is where we need to realize we need to be wise when you need to bargain when you need to you know negotiate there's a time for that but then there's times where you just you pay and you say no you just say thank you lord you just say thank you lord you gave this to me and i and i want that person to be blessed i want them to be blessed because i know that if i what kind of a spirit would i have on me if i got a constantly you know that's why i don't like that spirit i don't mind negotiating because the negotiations are they're happening it's the time everybody's expecting it it's it's just the way that it is it's it's the season for it so you can negotiate you can be and this is this is understanding god's way of moving in your life to keep you balanced to keep you not getting unbalanced because if you you know sometimes i've got into situations where it gets hot and the guy gets angry because what ends up happening you know somebody insults somebody and then all of a sudden oh well it changes the whole thing but if you've allowed god you're walking and you and he does it he brings it to you and then you still fight and argue like what's that all about you're walking with god so you're believing god is gonna do it then let him do it and then walk on and understand that that this is the time that he does these kinds of things it doesn't matter the circumstance it's it's the revelation that you catch while you're in the midst of walking with god and and seeing him do these wonderful things in your life god walking on two feet where in you glory the footsteps of the righteous is ordered of god nothing but the truth god walking in you for you are written epistles read of all men and if the life that's in christ be in you you'll bear the life that christ bore next slide when we look at this slide you know because it's important you know a lot of people get caught up into they gotta become perfect i gotta i gotta walk perfect i gotta be perfect you know and one of the things that you know in this message you know we've seen this many many times and you know as we look through it we see the seven steps and we see that faith is the first step virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness the holy ghost divine love all of this is christ it's all christ it's not about you you know yeah the scripture says and you know faith put on virtue virtue put on knowledge and then put on your temperance and and learn patience all of those things are you recognizing his patience in you [Music] his patience in me his virtues in me his his love in me god i can love these people because you love them god so loved the world it said that he gave himself it wasn't that god so loved just you it's because god so loved so understanding that you're walking with god is understanding that it's all his virtue all his love all his divine knowledge it's his knowledge it's not your knowledge when you have to memorize things and you got to just constantly memorize and memorize and you become a parrot and all you do is quote quote quote without having the life without having the revelation the experience of god experiencing that thing when you're listening to the prophet and you're hearing the prophet talk about a certain experience that he had with god you can identify with the experience because you had the same kind of experience because it was the same god in you that was in brother branham it's the same god that's living in us dwelling in us fulfilling his word interpreting his word he wants to interpret the word for himself but yet we need so you know i just wanted this because this i didn't bring it in a way where you know uh this is the things that we need to do we need to be more godly no you can't be godly you can't be spiritual it's the spirit of god in you that gives you a spirit of love a spirit of peace spirit of of understanding because it's his spirit let's move on in the message shalom you can go to the next slide brother branham speaking here he says see you are known when jesus christ lives in you by his life and promised word of this day reflects itself you see how that's underlined i'm going to read it again you are known when jesus christ lives in you by his life and promised word for this day reflects itself [Music] can you hear that he's his own interpreter see when men see you living like him when he sees your character your conduct with the word just exactly like he was the word being manifested then men will see jesus christ but it's not something that you put on it's something that you are you are a child of god you are an attribute of god i don't call myself a christian i don't call myself a catholic i don't call myself a baptist i don't call myself a presbyterian i don't call myself a jehovah witness i although that's people call themselves and they give themselves titles and it's all based on man's teachings all based on man's interpretation of the word of god all the every every foundation of when you call yourself a roman catholic your foundational teachings are based on the interpretations of the popes and the fathers and the priests as they interpret the word to you instead of you looking deeply yourself sincerely into the word of god to identify yourself with the word not with a church you are an attribute of god because you've heard your you've heard your name being called not by your first name brad but by the fact that you have recognized your time your season your day and your message in your life because you are called you personally have been called that's why you can't convince somebody to be anything until god calls them personally as an individual places them gives them faith to live this life and to and to do it with passion to live for christ with passion if jesus would come today would he take sides with the methodists with the baptists with the adventist jehovah witness christian science pentecostals presbyterians no sir he certainly would not it's an individual affair of you and god glory to god that's what it is it'll never change saints if we're going to get out of here is because the same spirit that raised christ from the dead it dwells in you and it'll quicken your mortal body you're going to need a supernatural quickening of the word in your life and the only way that that's going to come is when you recognize by perfect faith that you are walking with god and that you've come into a recognition that you are not some uh some title some church uh organization or denomination you are attributes of god you've been you've been awakened your mind is no longer your own mind but you've put on the mind of christ our life will interpret the rapture your life is going to interpret the rapture this is the time i'm going to i'm going to close now this is the time and the season for the rapture remember yes the world goes into great tribulation but just before it gets really bad the lord has promised to take his church not the churches his body if the same spirit that raised christ from the dead dwell in you personally it'll quicken your mortal body it'll move you out of this dimension into another dimension where the redeemed are that is known as the rapture and so the part that you are going to interpret in this hour is the rapture that's god's interpretation we need to see the season the time what god is going to interpret what he's going to do when when isaiah cried out a virgin shall conceive 400 years later a virgin showed up on the scene it was her time it was her season she was prophecy that was spoken by men that were moved by the holy ghost and we've got a sure word of prophecy in this hour that says the bride is going to go in a rapture she's going to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye that's going to take place it's going to manifest just like when mary came on the scene she was just a regular woman and all of a sudden an angel appears to her and says blessed art thou amongst all women because the holy ghost has come upon you and you're going to bring forth a body it's going to be called jesus and in that body is going to be the creator himself he's going to come and visit the earth it was an awesome thing it was unimaginable imagine that and here we are we're talking about a rapture you're going to be changed well what is that too hard for the lord no you're going to interpret the word we're not living in a pentecostal age we're living in another age see we're not living in the methodist age we're we're we're living in another age we're living on up here to the bride age the calling out of the church and getting it together for the rapture that's the age that we're now living to my honest opinion that's exactly the truth hallelujah praise god let the musicians come modern events made clear by vindicated prophecy what a perfect what a perfect uh quote from the word from from from our prophet and even the title makes it very clear you know so we're gonna we're gonna stop right there i'm still like only you know i'd say two-thirds of the way through but we'll wait for another time when the lord makes a way for us by the grace of god and we'll continue on but you know we're living in a time saints where god is is he's the same yesterday today and forever and we should never forget that god is his own interpreter god is bringing to pass and dealing with each and every one of our lives in very very you know uh simple but precise ways this is the you know ephesians chapter 4 talks about the the the need of the five-fold ministry and the purpose of it for the perfecting of the church i believe we're in that season and god is going to perfect each and every one of our lives to reflect him not to reflect your perfection to make you perfect you'll never be perfect here on this earth don't try to be perfect you'll only get confused you'll only get discouraged you know that's why you know phenomenal athletes they deal with depression like you have no idea okay because they're constantly being under the pressure to be perfect to be better to constantly be the you know better than the rest and and that's not an easy thing but god has given us his grace in this hour ahead brother david lead us in a song if the same spirit that raised christ from the dead [Music] [Music] if [Music] dwells in you it dwells in you if that same spirit that raised christ from the dead [Music] it is oh if [Music] greater is he that is in me greater is he that is in me greater is he that is
