atmosphere of worship in our midst amen praise God it's good to be here it's good to know that today is Father's Day how many knows that amen praise God God bless all the fathers that are in our midst Happy Father's Day to each and every one of you you are a special person in this day and in this hour some of you are not fathers yet but um today you may learn something that you can take into your role as you uh potentially enter into that phase of your life by the grace of God Amen praise God so this morning we're going to be looking you know the Lord just laid it on my heart uh you know to just dig into fathers to dig into you know this this time and you know what's going on and why um you know why we as fathers are under so much pressure amen praise God and I believe that um this is a timely message I believe that the Lord wants to give us something here today that's going to encourage fathers we're certainly not here today to rebuke fathers or to try and bring all kinds of teachings on what it means to be a good father and no today uh the the the the whole the way the Lord has led me is that he wants us to know how blessed we are to be fathers how blessed we are to have fathers amen and how blessed we are to know that he is our heavenly father praise God and so um we're going to be uh just uh trusting the Lord that he's going to do something that will encourage each and every father in our midst praise God so before we do that let's just pray and ask the Lord to anoint his word father we are grateful this morning we are happy this morning Lord to know that you are in our midst and that you want to speak to our hearts you want to Lord you just want to talk to us it's as simple as that Lord you you created this venue of the preaching of your word and so that we could gather together so you could fellowship with us so you could talk plainly with us Lord that we could Lord I know that if if our hearts if we've come here this morning with a Pure Heart Lord with a desire only one thing Lord a desire to hear from you and to Lord to be encouraged so that we can keep pressing because the battle is getting greater Lord and we need encouragement we need the faith and Lord you said that when the enemy comes you will raise a standard by ministering your word and making it more real to us granted today Lord anoint the atmospheres anoint the word as it's being spoken and anointed to the hearts of your children in due season in Jesus name amen praise God God bless you Saints we're going to read from our first scripture here from Psalms 37. verses 23 to 24. it says the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he's delighteth in his way though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand amen praise God and our next scripture is from Galatians chapter 4. verse 6. and it says and because ye are Sons God hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father you may be seated Hallelujah what a wonderful scripture you know Abba means father he's given us his spirit he's given us a revelation of himself he's given us an understanding of how much he loves us and he has given us this anointing in our lives that we can call him Abba you know if you talk to the Jewish people they say Abba they say father that's you know that's that's their their relationship you know the Jews growing up their father was everything to them it was their first teacher you just go back into the scriptures and you look at all the Patriarchs and you know you look at Abraham and you look at Isaac and you look at Jacob and they all had sons and they all had relationships with their sons and and it was important to them their first son was given the you know the full authority of of the father when he became of age you know there was tutoring and there was time and you know if you read this scripture if you go and read actually read about Galatians it's talking about how we've come out of our slavery out of our bondage as humans under the under the law under the teachings of of of of of the law that that makes us do everything because if we don't do something we're going to be punished if we do something wrong we're going to be punished but yet God has shown us here that he says but because you are Sons because you have entered into that that that relationship with me you're no more just governed and controlled by the law you can actually come to me and and Call Me Abba you can you can say Lord God my father Lord I have needs I have I have needs in my life and you can trust and know that he's he he cares and he's concerned and he wants to meet your needs amen praise God forevermore Hallelujah so today you know when and when I got into this study it wasn't easy I'm going to tell you right now it was not easy because as you're going through it as you're studying as you're you know you're researching all about uh being a father and you know the relationship of a father with his son and his relationship with his children and all those things you start to you know examine yourself and I'm not here today to say oh I've done well as a father that I'm a great father I'll tell you I've made a lot of mistakes as a father I'll tell you I'm ashamed of things as a father I've done things and said things to my children that I wish I never did but yet there's a relationship and today we're talking about the heart of a father that's what the lord gave me all I couldn't get away from that that title and the Heart of a father and and I just said okay I'm gonna I'm gonna search the scriptures I'm going to see what it is Lord that it is that that that that stirring within me that's drawn me to this this scripture and this theme and this uh Ministry this morning and I came to realize I I got I got tested in so many ways I got on my knees and cried unto the Lord I repented before God I got I got into situations before God while I was researching this and realized oh God what Mercy you have shown what Grace you have shown to me a father in this life in this society that we're living in so I'm not here to tell you I'm perfect in any way I want you to know that as as we're ministering here this morning it's it's all pointing right back and if you're a father here this morning I want you to pay close attention I want you to search your heart and and because this is about the relationship that you have with the Lord we're living in a day right now where fatherhood is under a massive attack it's been under attack for many many many years in the 1960s there was a sitcom called Father Knows Best I don't know if anybody remembers it I didn't really remember it until I saw the characters and then I remembered it and it's with a couple of act an actor and an actress by the name of Robert Young and Jane Watt and they played their parts as Jim and Margaret Anderson and they were just a common family and whenever there was a situation within that home with the children the mother would say Well when your daddy gets home he knows best and that's why it was titled Father Knows Best and so here back in the 1960s I don't know back then fathers had a lot more respect and fathers when they waved the belt there was a lot of respect you know a lot of times you would make the excuse you know play dumb you play dumb when something oh what do you mean Dad I what I drove the car no I didn't move the car play dumb you can play dumb all you want but once you've tasted of the belt a few times it's amazing how your brain starts to work a lot better and you start to think differently and you know there was a time when when when all those things really mattered and oh when Mom would say you wait till your father gets home it was like I'm out of here I'm gonna run for my life you know because because father had a lot of respect father was was was the breadwinner he was the the final say in the house but I'm saying to you this morning fatherhood is under attack it is under attack in the world because if they can attack fatherhood and they can break it down and make it make it so that it doesn't matter like it did before what happens the families break down relationships break down respect breaks down your children will talk to you in ways that you had never imagined they would say things like that and speak things like that and use the kind of language that they use like that right in your face and still knowing that you're you're you're you're a Christian you're a Godly mother a Godly father you believe the Lord you trust the Lord but this is the age that we're living in Hallelujah you know it was back in 1909 When a Woman by the name of Sonora smart Dodd was listening to a Mother's Day sermon and was inspired to come up with Father's Day and apparently she's the one that came up with the idea that we should have a Father's Day and the reason why she did that was because her father had raised six children as a single parent now we know that that's almost unheard of these days for a father to be raising as a single parent mothers they're everywhere they're everywhere single mothers are absolutely everywhere why because the whole system in the whole social system and the whole uh everything about government and the way everything is set up and designed is designed to produce that type of environment for our children and so now children more than ever ever before are being brought up without fathers let's go to um the next slide now don't go any further just leave it right there father deprivation is a more reliable predictor of criminal activity then race environment or poverty children are growing up without fathers in society right now at a record pace like never before and when a father is not present certain things take place now these are facts listen 63 percent of Youth suicides are from fatherless homes 90 percent of all runaway children are from fatherless homes 85 percent of all children with behavioral disorders are from fatherless homes eighty percent of rapists with violent anger disorders are from fatherless homes 71 percent of high school dropouts are from fatherless homes 75 percent of all adolescent chemical abuse patients in drug treatment centers are from fatherless homes 85 percent of all youths in prison are from fatherless homes this is mind-blowing it's staggering what is it Saints father deprivation if they can get where fathers be get belittled and you know it's a serious form of child abuse is what it actually is and it's been entrenched within our systems powerful sexist people have a vested interest in diminishing the role of men especially their role as as fathers research proves that children Thrive with the active and meaningful participation of both biological parents and is true for post-divorce families also in 1999 August of of 1999 there was an article in Time magazine that was titled how man evolved you see they're trying to they're trying to put man and Humanity under this Evolution Theory and we know that evolution is absolutely unscriptural it has no Foundation in the scripture whatsoever but by using that they can try and implement it into such a way that to say well man is evolving and man is evolving to the point now where man can be a woman and if they could get that to you know to to the place where and it already is being fully adopted into society and into the school systems I heard this morning that one of our friends they're they're they're they're they're they're moving their child out of that school because their child came home and said Daddy am I a boy or a girl and they decided no way they're moving their children they're going to move them into a Catholic School System they'll do whatever it takes because they recognize well wait a minute here this is getting way too carried away like look at where we're at Saints when it gets that close to home you know things are right at the door Hallelujah glory to God Amen this article makes numerous breathtaking assertions but basically what they're saying is this fathers aren't essential to the well-being of children gay lesbian and single parents are as good as any other heterosexual marriage isn't necessary to produce healthy well-adjusted children oh my God help us Jesus let's go to the next slide we're going to be reading from Deuteronomy chapter 6. verses 1 to 9. and we're going to be looking at um how your relationship that as a father if you don't have a right relationship with your heavenly father you'll have a hard time having a great relationship with your children now there's a lot of psychology out there there's a lot of teaching out there and you know there's people that they don't need the scripture they don't need the word of God they've decided to go to psychology they've decided to go to the teachings of man and that you know that communication is the key element you know you just communicate well with your children I'm not putting any of this down don't get me wrong you need proper communication you need to have time communication with your children it's very very important but they've left the word of God out of it you know I like as I was doing this study I came to realize I started to look at my whole life and I realized I didn't spend enough time with my children I did not spend enough time with my children I my lot was you know I was an entrepreneur I I was caught up with business I was caught up with with like you know growing up I grew up in a house where my dad where if I went to my dad and I said dad you know can I have 10 cents to you know to go buy gum he say go get a job go get a newspaper go go cut lawns go shovel driveways you want money and I used to go to the store for him to get a pack of cigarettes bring it home and there'd be 10 cents left over and he's where's the dime he says you want it you earn it you go to work and I started as a young kid I realized that if I got to get if I want any of these things you know if I want a nice bike if I want something I'm gonna have to work for it if I want a car I'm going to need to work for it I bought my own car with my own money I worked for that money I bought all the things that as a young man and so you got to understand your upbringing and your your your your time as a child and growing up in the influences that you had from your father and your mother how to had a massive effect on your life my dad came to Canada in 1951 with ten dollars in his pocket and he knew absolutely nothing and he had to start a life completely on his own so his his understanding of life and how to get ahead it came on me certain things have come on you in the way that you were brought up and taught by your fathers and by your mothers and so when I looked at my life I realized my God I was working 15 16 hours a day seven days a week thank God I had a wife that that that wanted to raise her children and be with her children and she spent time with those children when we had children she stopped working in order to raise those children that's how passionate it was about and we weren't financially capable of doing that but because she wanted to do it I said you do it because in my mind and I still think the same way I do what I gotta do in order to get ahead I do if I gotta work 16 hours a day I work 16 hours a day if I gotta go seven days a week I go seven days a week now obviously that's changing as I'm getting older [Applause] I can tell you that I don't I don't have the same it's not the same anymore up here but then when this thing tries to go it's like it's like holy smokes man what's the matter with this body it's not it's not responding in the same way but I come to realize there's stages in life but I looked back and I said Lord I didn't spend enough time with my kids I didn't give them the kind of nurturing that they needed it was difficult when you got it deal with it but God showed me when he called me he says I took your heart now these are the Commandments the statutes and the judgments which the Lord your God commanded to teach you that ye might do them in the land wither ye gold to possess it that thou mightest fear the lord thy God to keep all his statutes and his Commandments which I command thee thou and thy son and thy son's son son all the days of thy life and that thy days may be prolonged notice who he is speaking to he's speaking to the fathers he's speaking to the family he's speaking to the the individual this is speaking to each and every one of us here this morning if we don't have that right relationship with God we can never have the right relationship with our families our loved ones our children and get through the battles that you will have to fight it's not that you're going to have perfect relationships with your children I do not have perfect relationships with my children they are not serving the lord do I love them with all my heart but who do I love first he took my heart I am now a father but the father's Spirit has come upon me has come upon you as a father has come to test you and to see if you're really going to stand in this hour where fatherhood is under attack like never before here therefore verse 3. o Israel and observe to do it all these things while I was reading these scriptures and I realized you know like it's almost 30 Years it'll be 30 years in in another year I guess 93 I came in 94. so it's 29 years July that I was baptized and that the Lord took my heart and I realized all the things that have happened in those 29 years and how I raise those children how my wife and I raise them how we we were doing it because we loved God we came into a relationship with the Lord so when we discipline them we discipline them according to the word of God according to what God had showed us in our hearts and we believed it with all of our hearts that if we corrected them in the right way that God would not depart from them and I still believe it I will never stop believing it I will still correct them when they come to me and they say certain things and they you know and they give me their opinion I say I you know I appreciate your opinion but understand that it is not my opinion I don't agree with that and I need you to understand why I don't agree with that because I've made the word of God my absolute [Music] without the word of God as my absolute I'm done and so are you it's as simple as that as long as I can stay and stand and believe that word and there ain't nothing going to take me off it they're protected by the grace of God [Applause] they don't realize it they don't understand it but God will stand behind his word he says o Israel and observe to do it that it may be well with thee and that he may increase mightily as the Lord God of thy fathers hath promised thee in the land that floweth with milk and honey hear o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord oh he made that so clear oh that became such a reality that is the link you go and talk to any Jews they recite that they they will recite this on a daily basis they will say the Lord our God is one Lord and they will say and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart [Music] and with not just that with all thy soul and with all thy might you know what that is interpreted with everything that is within you love the Lord God make him your absolute as a father when you make God your absolute and you trust in God as your absolute he will stand behind his word Hallelujah glory to God Amen let's continue to read and these listen what he says here and you know and while I was reading all this it was just just encouraging me it was encouraging me he said in these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart it's in your heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children we sat we taught we got them to memorize scripture we had them in every Camp every Sunday school we did all all that we could to raise those children we we love them with with the love of God we we taught them the best that we could but then we come to realize they become adults and God doesn't have any grandchildren God has Sons and Daughters of God attributes of God and so they need to come to know him and they need to know when he gets a hold of their heart because I I wasn't looking for God I didn't give my heart to God if you know that you've come into a relationship with God God stole your heart God took it from you God God says you're mine now I I said Lord how's this possible how could I be so in love with you how could I possibly you know at my age I you know my life was a mess an absolute mess but he decided that when that love and when that love touches you saints that love of God it just changes everything [Music] everything nothing can nothing can remain the same he says and thou shalt teach them diligy unto thy children shall talk shall talk of them when thou sit us in thine house and when thou walkest by the way and when thou liest down and when thou Rises up and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes and thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house and on thy Gates and my God my wife and I every scripture we could possibly put up and every picture that we could put up we wanted the face of God we wanted to see the word of God we all we wanted was the word of God and we live that now you can't you know you hear of people you know you know some people will say well I've got a I've got a Pulpit in my house my kids come home I sit them down I stand and I preach him a message that doesn't work today that does not work today they've they they they're they're tuned out they're looking at their phone they're making sure that when you look down at the Bible they're looking at their phone they're tuned out they're not looking God needs to become a reality but what they will never forget is when they see you sitting there reading your Bible every day when they see you on your knees praying with your wife or your husband they'll never forget those things those are things that they will never forget they they won't forget those experiences that they had in the Lord because God promised that if we would do these things he would honor his word Hallelujah there's an attack on fathers and this morning we've got Arsenal to attack against it to attack against this influence this power this this teaching this it's all it's throughout the whole school system it's throughout the the judicial system everything is designed in such a way that children can can go fatherless that children don't need to have a father but if God gets a hold of us which he has done it changes everything the power and the influence that's out there cannot have power over you as a son or a daughter of God because he's got your heart he's got your heart listen to the next scripture here go to the next slide perhaps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in his ways though he fall he shall not be utterly cast out we will make mistakes we will you know like this is the whole thing this is what the the the healing bomb here that God you know laid on my heart this morning to to minister to you this morning there's a healing bomb here that God he's he's he's he's gone beyond all of the the things that you see right now you're you're looking at you know some of us are looking at our families we're looking at our children we're looking at the circumstances around it and we can get very discouraged when we do that but God says you shall not be utterly cast down you're sure you're going to make mistakes sure you're going to do things that are that are wrong you know you're going to say things that are wrong but God says I'm going to raise you up by my hand I'm going to keep you I'm gonna make a way for you Hallelujah glory to God Amen I want you to go to the next slide in Deuteronomy 5 28 and 29 uh now you need to understand the setting here this is where Moses was um you know with the children of Israel out in the wilderness and they had approached God and they didn't want God's voice they didn't want to hear God's voice coming directly from God because it it was it was too much for them it would it was destroying them they would die they would touch the mountain they would die they said no no you speak through Moses you you uh it's Moses you go and you go before God and and you get the the the teaching you get the understanding and then you bring it to us and God heard that and the Lord heard the voice of of your words when you spake unto me and the Lord said unto me because Moses now he's talking to the people okay you gotta put this into context he's talking to the people and he's saying that you know the Lord heard you when you said that when you decided that you would allow me to be your voice allow me to be the voice of God aren't you glad that God has sent prophets aren't you thankful that God sent us a prophet Malachi 4 in order to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers aren't you grateful to know because there's a lot of teaching out there on the word of God and there's a lot of teaching on on being a father and there's a lot of principles and if you apply those principles you can be a good father but yet we're not talking about fathers that are just in the world here we're talking about the Rapture we're talking about Sons and Daughters of God that are in positions as fathers that need to understand the day the season the hour that we're living in and how important it is to have the revelation of what God is doing in our day and that God has sent us a message that God has sent us a prophet to to interpret the word of God to turn our hearts back to the original word you can you can take the teachings of the of the scriptures that I just read you and yet there's all kinds of ministers that are teaching these scriptures but they don't have the same effect as it would to a son or a daughter of God this is this is the hour where we are being we are being transformed by the word of God we're not just normal fathers and mothers we're attributes of God we're more than just a mother we're more than just a father not because we did anything special but because we've been given the ability to recognize the word for our day we've been given the ability to recognize rapturing faith there's a reason why I believe the word of God and I believe in the relationship that I have with my heavenly father there's more than just a father-son relationship here there's a relationship in the Supernatural there's a relationship that changes our complete walk it changes our homes it changes our atmospheres it has an effect upon everything that we do because we are not just normal fathers and mothers we are Sons and Daughters of the Living God and we're being we're being perfected for a rapture we're being changed here a little they're a little this is more than just a Father's Day sermon this morning there's more here there's there's something here that we need to we we need to connect with we need to understand that as an attribute of God there's a supernatural element that is taking place and here Jesus or God was was telling now Moses telling the people that God had told him that the Lord said unto me I have heard the voice of the words of this people you are that special people you are that special people that have come out under a prophet Ministry that are now entering into that perfect land that would that that we're being translated into the promised land we're in that transition right now everything is in tight form here and we need to realize that we are the people we've heard and uh we've heard the voice of the words of this people I've heard the Lord says which they have spoken unto thee they have well said all that they have spoken God was pleased God is pleased when you when you repeat back and you say yes God sent us a prophet God sent us a a sign God sent us a message that is turning our hearts back to the original word it's it's it's greater than just a a Christian teaching amen all that there were such an heart in them that they would fear me and keep all my Commandments always that it might be well with them and with their children forever I want you to know that God sent William Miriam Branham into a Christian chaos where churches were believing and trusting in their own teachings man's teachings man's interpretation on the word of God everything has been man's interpretation but the holy spirit is still his own interpreter he's still the one that's making it plain what it is to be a true son and daughter of the Living God what it means to be a real father in your office you're not really listen I'm a father here Pastor Simon is my pastor he's a father he's a grandfather he's a son we're all living in these different offices but who are you really you're an attribute of God brother Gabe you're a part of God only God if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you it's going to Quicken your mortal body it's going to Quicken you into that other dimension when you move into that other dimension you're gonna you're gonna it's like going through a door when you get to that other side you're going to look at your hands you're going to look at your body you're going to look into the mirror and you're going to see that young absolutely perfect attribute body of Jesus Christ the body reflected you as an attribute you are part of God you're not going to be a father there you're not going to be a mother there but you are here and you've got a battle between those two dimensions and there's a great attack constantly on you as a father and as you a mother let's look at some scriptures but I'm not going to be keeping you along here we're going to be done within 15 minutes we're looking at the heart of a father in PR in Psalms 37 31 it says the law of his God is in his heart God took our hearts and he put his law within our hearts and that is the overcoming power that's in you none of his steps shall slide aren't you glad these are his promises aren't you glad to know that he's taken your heart and that more than that he's taken your life he's he's put it into his hand he says not not one is going to be plucked out brother Phil the one is going to be lost all that the father hath given me will come not one of them is going to be lost can't you see the beauty in this promise in the word of God can't you see that that you know when when we reflect on these things we get we get encouraged to keep pressing on and we we look at those circumstances with our homes with our children with sickness with with financial issues we look at all those things but they have only a temporary effect on you if you allow it to control you there you go next Psalms 40. I Delight to do thy will o my God yea thy law is written is within my heart it's there David knew David knew listen I could give you so many you think David was a good father he had problems [Laughter] he had a son that wanted to kill him these are examples of fathers in the Bible if he was such a good father why would he go and commit adultery BC then he came to know that God's law was written in his heart you know what God's law was my word shall not return unto me void it will accomplish that which I have sent it forth to accomplish you might look at your circumstances you might look at your mistakes as a father you might look at your mistakes as a mother but God is looking at his attribute God is looking at his word God is looking at his his promises his will his plan his purpose and it is to bring you home next scripture Psalms 119 Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee you don't have a desire to sin as a son or a daughter of God but all you could do was take that word and place it there this thing makes mistakes this thing it falls it it gets tired it gets upset it says things that it shouldn't say but God has allowed you to hide his word within your heart you know heart in the Bible and mind when you look it up they mean the same thing with all your heart with all your soul with all your mind it's all God saying I'm there I have made a way for you you will not fail you will overcome Colossians 3 16 let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with Grace in your hearts to the Lord let it permeate you aside from today that I will sing the glory of God I will sing the Praises of the Lord I will receive what he has given me the overcoming power to to to overcome in this Dimension to overcome in an age where everything is attacking the the the the truth of God's word this is an attack against God's word remember a father represents the home our heavenly father had a plan he put Adam and Eve into the garden he wanted to express himself so that he could have fellowship and the enemy the enemy has not changed he's still attacking the relationship what did he do when he went to Eve he was attacking the relationship he was attacking the relationship that they had with God the father Jesus didn't come to the Earth to it to to to to to make himself great he says I come to express the father all that I do the father shows me what I do he shows me what I need to do all the father hath given me will come I and the father are one you see he was expressing what we are to express as Sons and Daughters of God that we are one with God we are one with the Holy Spirit and so as we wind down now I just got a couple of quotes here but these quotes really touch my heart you know um there's a quote here where brother Branham is talking about from the message Jehovah Jireh and now I want you to understand the context of by which I've I'm going to read you this quote and understand this quote that Abraham is a father and God is going God goes to Abraham and says I want you to go to the mountain and I want you to sacrifice your son he says take the wood take this take a night get everything you need go there you're going to offer me your son now can you imagine what Abraham went through listen he says now notice as they go up the hill Abraham packing the fire and when they got up there he said father he said here I am he said here is the wood and here is the fire here is the altar but where is the Lamb for the sacrifice oh could you imagine that Father's Heart pumping hard his only child where is the sacrifice Abraham choking back the tears think of your own self choking back the tears with a stern look towards heaven he said my son God will provide for himself a lamb for the sacrifice you've had hard times with your children you've had hard situations in your life that you've had to deal with you've had situations that you didn't think you could get through it you didn't know if you would be able to do that or say that or or have to stand the way that you stood but something in you rolls up Abraham he said turn around he said God will provide himself he said turn around Isaac turn your back to me son he did Isaac thought what's this it's leather cords taking my hands surely father understands what he's doing around his feet with some cords tied them together he looked over Abraham looked at him brushed back his hair out of his eyes kissed him on the cheek he says God be with you my son laid him upon the altar do you think Abraham had a revelation of God do you think he knew where he stood in the midst coming into a situation like that do you think that he understood do you think that maybe God had taken his heart and he understood that that there's nothing that that can separate him from the love of God and laid upon him laid him on the altar look back choking back the tears little Isaac obedient to death not asking a question Abraham pulled a big knife from his sheath from the knife from his sheath brushed back the hair away from his Little Neck looked up to God and started to take the life of his own son just as he raised his hand the Holy Spirit caught his hand and said Abraham stand your hand God is going to keep you God is going to stand your hand God is going to hold your hand God is going to when when things get tough and rough and hard in this life as a father or as a mother you don't worry you might stumble you might fall but God is going to hold your hand because at the last moment he's going to come and he's going to provide what you have need of he's going to make a way for you you will not fall you will not you will not fall into depression you will not become psychotic you will not lose it you will you will overcome listen as a as a child being fatherless in this world you've you come under attacks I gotta say brother Corey God bless you you overcame you're pressing the battle you're doing things that's a lot of people could not do but you're standing by the grace of God Hallelujah the same God that was with Abraham he's with us he's with us he's with our homes he's with our families he's with our jobs he's with our health he's with our wealth everything that we have need of he's there it was a real lamb not a myth neither a vision God can supernaturally produce what you have need of he will make a way for you he will change the hearts of our children he will change your bank account he will change your job he will change your health he will do supernaturally because we serve a supernatural God he has not changed let the musicians come brother Branham here in 1955 when he said come let us reason together he said and I went around there and I looked nobody was looking now this is Brother Branham he was he was he was in a meeting and the Holy Spirit went to him and says come apart from the meeting I need to talk to you and brother Branham had to leave and he goes and he says nobody was looking I said father what is it said go to Billy once at once this is where brother Branham the Holy Spirit goes that's how how much God loves us he goes to brother Brown he says you go to your son right now he needs you and I run back real quick and Mita was coming up the street my wife and I said hurry honey hurry something's wrong with Billy and we run jumped in a car and took out to Jeffersonville about five or six miles when I went into the yard my mother-in-law standing in the yard screaming at the top of her voice said Billy's dying got him in the hospital so I said what happened said well he come up down there and he had a sore throat and he was afraid you was going to catch him with that sore throat and tell him he was still smoking cigarettes my God and he went down and your good friend the best doctor there is in the nation one of the best Dr samadar gave him a shot of penicillin and he swelled up about that big in just about three minutes and he run up there and they wrapped him in blankets and rushed him to the hospital and I run out real quick here come the doctor down like dot took off his hat said Billy I've killed your boy and I said oh doc surely not and I run into the room they had oxygen over him and everything and pumping and giving him adrenaline over his heart and he was just heart going on down and down I said could I be with him a moment and so he just walked out of the room I knelt down put my hands upon him I said dear God please how many of us have gotten down and said oh God please please Lord I don't know what the situation is right now that you're dealing with but God's speaking he's saying hasn't my heart been broke enough in my days please Jesus oh God give the boy another chance don't Lord please I I ask you with all my heart as your servant if you'll spare the life of my boy he's so good to me and helps me in the meetings and he's so loyal to me I need him God please don't take him I ask you not Sixth and I looked and I saw a vision of him falling like that turning over and over like it was a couple of nights before that when I seen him in the vision and I seen two big arms come out and catch him like this and started burying him right back up going right back up like that I raised up and Billy turned around just as black as he could be and his lips swelled way out and his eyes turned real red and turned back he said Daddy where are you where are you daddy I said I'm standing right here honey it's all over now amen glory to God it's all over now amen God made a way for him God will make a way for you God is he's our heavenly father Hallelujah he's our heavenly father and our position as husbands are to to to declare that we are spiritual fathers in this Society we're not just normal fathers we're fathers that stand on the word of God God bless you Saints [Applause] foreign [Music] I know [Music] through it is [Music] it's time [Music] [Music] yes I [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] am happy [Music] [Applause] [Music] how wonderful to know we have a father like this that we appreciate with all our hearts and the reason is because we have a revelation and understanding of the depths of what he has done for us self for for his own you know the scripture tells us Jesus was his son but we know the father was in the son was actually God gave himself for his own Jesus said and loving his own he loved them unto death he didn't say he loved him until death when he died then his love ended but he's telling you I love you until you die your death and you come back to me loving his own he loved them unto death not his death their death because of their death releases them it frees them it sends them back where they come from because they're not just Mortals of Earth they're not of time they are of Eternity they are not of the seven day week but they are of the Eighth Day the Eternal day and we are glad that we are already a part of it in our spirit in our soul we are in there praise the name of the Lord I want to thank the Lord Jesus for this uh talk this wonderful message our brother brought as he applied the token see I can stand and preach the message wonderfully bringing forth The Marvelous things out of the word but applying the token to the situation to the needs it's a different matter so the application of that talk no on this specific day which relates the fathers and the needs of fathers and specifically I thought I touched on uh the influence of fathers I'm not going to preach one another sermon I'm just going to talk about 10 minutes or so because our brother certainly touched on the fact of Abraham and how God reflected himself in Abraham's life really God was trying to show the world and to show the human race this is what I am going to do this is the price I am willing to pay right and Abraham was willing to pay that uh price amen now um we understand clearly here friends that the position of being a father is both a very solemn and sacred position right it's a sacred and a solemn role and not to take it simply as it is out there in the world the uh you know people feel the young men young women you just go out there and they're they're making children and all this stuff but that just means you're a male or that you're a female but fatherhood is a different matter altogether so it's a sacred thing it's an obligation it's something we need to dedicate ourselves to but the grace of God within our lives as was Said Today We Are Spiritual fathers with spiritual understanding amen now many years ago one woman was dying and as she was dying she said to her husband bring all the children with you when you are coming home and I'll meet you on the other side she's talking about bringing all the children that he could with him when he goes back into the presence of the Living God that should be our desire to do that and that should be in the heart of every father to do that now with the opening of the word relation of this message we understand that in the early days of the message fathers Believers made lots of mistakes a lot of things that were not right because we felt that we need to make sure we um almost forced the children to be in church to be at Sunday school to be at all these uh religious events that we have to have and um yeah we did that and it had to be done in the early stages of the message when it was just coming and unveiling itself to us but now we understand um even you know that it's all salvation is by election is that right salvation is by revelation it's not just my somebody running up to the altar saying oh I love Jesus I give you my heart and oh you've got him you're saved no no no no no no it's by election this is what the prophet taught so once we know it's by election God gave you your children but you don't know amongst those children of who they are what they are whether they're going to be in his presence out of his presence but what he commanded us is to love them love them and lead them to him and to his influence as long as you can they will become adults and they will make their own choice of what they will do but while they're under your jurisdiction on your leadership you do the best that you can in leading them close to the Lord and so the age of pushing wrestling lasso tying them up and uh no no no no no no we're not here to Brand them with a with a with a B on there I'm sorry I'm I said I wasn't going to preach but anyway um what I'm saying is that the influence of fathers are very very important especially in this wicked and chaotic age and we in which we live because whether you like it or not it's somewhere or the other you are influencing your children you may not like it but that's the way it is whether for good or for evil you are bringing some influence upon their lives and I believe that every father in some way should be secretly admired by his children some even if it's one thing in him his children ought to look up to him and admire him for that one thing that they can see in his life now we know that Abraham will beg God in all things he he just obeyed God and I believe every father ought to obey God obey God's word and live according to God's word Abraham was also very much concerned about others right concerned about others when Sodom was going to be destroyed he turned to God and he says if there was 40 you think you might spare them yeah he says yeah I I think I'll spare them well he goes down he brings the number down 40 you know 30 20 down to 10 he said yeah if I can find 10. but he couldn't even find 10. but the fact I'm bringing out is that Abraham was not only concerned about himself and his own family but he had a concern for others and the influence of a father should go out first to his children to his family and then it should go out also for others because children in the neighborhood neighbors neighbors all around they are watching and they are receiving your influence whether you like it or not we know also that Abraham had held nothing back from God he did not hold back even his from giving God his son giving God his child giving everything to God and we should hold nothing back from God we should give our all to him for his glory and for his honor one day time will blend right into eternity and each father is going to be asked what did you do with this Jesus called the Christ what did you do with the revelation of the word that you did receive what did you do for your children what did you do with your children uh did you were you concerned with them were you a part of their lives amen I believe when this life's journey is finished and our race is all done when our work is over and as the old song says when the bibles are closed upon the altar what then my friends I want you to know certainly that at that time we should be able to stand and look into the face of our Lord and savior and just say these few words Lord I just did what I could you did what you could and you did it with your whole heart and that's all God asks us to do what you can and so to every father that's here today I pray God will let you know you have influence whether you recognize it or not you have influence and that you that influence touches your children as our brother spoke of uh today of his father's influence my father's influence amen but the influence of that Earthly father that I had who has now gone on that influences molded the physical part but I have another influence and that's the part that I'm relying on now my heavenly father influences me his word influences me his word changes me his word transforms me praise the name of the Lord and he's pleased while I'm saying this praise God I just want you to know that our gracious heavenly father is is certainly a wonderful father and I'm glad that I I just accepted him as my father and I did not just take him but he took me and he caused me to recognize him and that's the reason why I'm here today by the grace of God hallelujah aren't you glad that you could be a child of God aren't you glad that you can be one of them praise the name of the Lord we have here this wonderful Bulletin and this was designed by our sister Marsha and in in uh collaboration with the a lot of the young people young men women or should I say children in the church and now we've ended up with this beautiful bulletin which you can have one at the end of this service praise the name of the Lord now let's go back and sing that hymn that chorus sing it with meaning and with understanding and also not just sing but Paul said sing with understanding sing with Revelation So Close Your Eyes slip your hand up and then don't sing to me When I close my eyes and I began to sing like that I'm singing to the Lord my heart is going out to him because the prophet said the one whom you worship you can't see him but one day he'll be made personalized before you make himself manifest first in the word and then he'll make himself physically uh available to you that you will see him with your eyes amen you're singing here one day and all of a sudden he decides to appear what are you going to do amen praise the Lord if these things are not gone these days are not passed Bible days are still here praise the Lord amen glory to God we still have some of the old pictures of the pillar of fire in that tree of life hanging there brothers sisters these things the prophet spoke of are real we don't have to make up stories it's real but the people today have not seen any of it so therefore they have a bit of uh quibble about it you know but let me tell you Bible days are here again the scriptures are alive again the word of God is alive again the power and the presence of the Living God hallelujah is taking hold of Our Hearts Let's stand and sing that song as I wish you Happy Father's Day you fathers that are here your prospective fathers that are here may God bless you and don't fear don't worry some of us our children may not as we say are saved they appear to maybe have wandered off from the way you have taught them but the Bible tells us leave them alone because when you pen the tree when it's young it may depart yeah but it will come right back to where it was you may live to see it you may not live to see it but believe and trust in a true and a living God that his word will come to pass let's worship him now heavenly father I appreciate you Hallelujah Heavenly Father [Music] I [Music] love you I love
