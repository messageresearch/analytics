into your hands for your honor and For Your Glory in Jesus name amen amen thank you my precious brother okay we reading from Isaiah 61 to2 says Rise Shine for the light is come and the glory of the Lord is rising upon thee for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and close Darkness the people but the Lord shall rise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee one scripture again Daniel 4:12 before you sit down thou but thou oh Daniel shut up the W and seal up and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased may the Lord add is blessing please sit down praise the Lord when we read Isaiah 60 it says Rise and Shine who is the person that this scripture is speaking to remember let the scriptures speak to you in uh uh compound meaning because H H he spoke to the old Saints and it h is continuing to speak to you and me today so even though let's take it back to the gental days it has spoken to Luther it has spoken to Wesley it has spoken to Pentecost and also is now speaking to us as present tense so put up your thinking cap because I'm not talking about the old sins I'm talking about you the present truth so when we read it and the scripture is saying rise shine is talking about you the light has come because who is that light God the Lord Jesus Christ is that light who has risen up in in the and he want you to shine he want you to obey his word he want you to heal yourself come out from your comfort zone so that the light will shine bright and brighter and brighter because the hour we live in is in Sodom and gomorra the whole world right the churches are in what Sodom the denominations are in Sodom so God is telling you and I we shouldn't stay in darkness we shouldn't stay in Sodom because the brother Mike was talking about they were baptizing a lady and he saw how the spirit was mangling her and doing things like a demon spirit and he was looking at it and he was talking about seeing about it and recognized in him right because he because he has risen and his his the light has risen upon sorry the light has risen upon brother Mike and he is living with the word so once anything that is contrary to God word that light in him sees it right so God is saying rise up and let that light that I have put in you shine don't let that light be deed don't let that light keep you in darkness because at this hour what the Lord is saying I have given you everything that is in in the Lord he has pour into you it is you that have to shine it is you that have to let the word made manifest in you so that when people come and contact you they know that they are contacting something that can help them because in these times people are let us be honest people are going crazy out there the churches has gone into Sodom they can't help them H Insanity has taken places in the churches and God is saying it is you that I am going to use it is you I'm using and I'm going to use so shine draw closer to me because when you draw closer to me the light begin to shine more and more and more because bradeson was preaching he talk about when you are in darkness and in the room you cannot see you'll be bouncing your knees you'll be bouncing your head on the wall and you go like this is is is right brother demonstrate that on Wednesdays when he was preaching and so is it when darkness come in your life you cannot see the light but the light has come the prophet William Braham came right with the word for the Pentecostal day they saw Miracles since even the word of God came I believe because Jesus said the works that I do you will do more shall you do Greater Works shall you do so he let brother Braham he came through him to demonstrate that to the Pentecostals to see see right after that Christ came down 1963 to call you and me right you and me our light is not William Braham even though we thank God for William Braham we are appreciate him for what he has done for us because he was a prophet there's no question about that but our messenger is the mighty Angel and he is here he is shining the light Hallelujah so allowed yourself so that you yield yourself you and that light become one people will see it when you go places when you are working in places signs and wonders the Bible says signs and wonders will follow them that believe the power of God will come down let me tell you you saw what even I'm going to go back again brother deson was telling you show you his brother is true he was a king Satan has crippled him with struck sitting down but the brother playay we we me and philli we all join up lay hands on him and he walk even brother Des didn't show all the picture like you could see in the evening they told me because I can preach my language and they told me to preach you will see that the whole village people has come around us why because they live in that Village and they know that King was sick with stroke and they saw him walking why we pray for him so the light was shining for them to see even if they don't take it that's a witness to them that Jesus Christ live every person that saw that can refuse it not many will will receive this message this me this kind of gospel is for the elect but at least we we preaching to two class of people the true bride and the souls that will be in prison and also sorry the foolish virgin two so it's three class right so our part is to demonstrate the light that Christ has put in us for the people to see and to know but if we stay with ourself if if we we don't come to the house of the Lord and set under the gospel we are not going to grow because a seed without water putting in the Shelf what do you think going to happen nothing going to happen and I'm afraid a lot of people want to their Christianity is like they the seed in them even they children of God by they putting it in the Shelf God don't want Chef Christianity come and let the water fall on it okay let the water of God come on the seed when it come it will remove every nasty thing that the devil trying to put on the seed it will remove it and it will make the seed do what bring forth it will make the seed do what shine do what the Lord want that seed to do you don't have to do anything it's not your dedication the Lord want it's not your literate the Lord want it's not your money or your popularity or how you can uh talk big or speak small or quiet this no the Lord don't need all those things all he need is come and set he has chose you come and set in the light the light will do the job you don't have to do nothing because once God you're sitting under the word of God and the word is preached you may think you alone can do it you can none of us alone can do it none can do it you may have a big portion I may have like this but that like that small like that you need it to come and fit that your big portion yes you need it that's why so if you say oh I'm a big preacher you can speak go this that I don't need the left hand you see you walking with half human being because you need the right hand need the left hand the left hand need the right hand then we can walk so we need the light to shine through us why we come and set under it then because the darkness is so thick brothers and sisters when we look out there people are going crazy sickness are floating everywhere I was just telling our pastor I says look at even the the the Queen the king sorry King Charles his H son daughter they have all kinds of money but as soon as they tell Kate Kate recognize he's sick with cancer I I don't know about you I was watching and I'm seeing her face all what he's saying but you could see sadness on her her face right I wish she could come and see me and I meet her and I could talk to her what do you need I have it Glory what C need I have it the whole world may not have the Antidope all the doctors in the world may not have the Antidope for her but for R Cofe have it because you know why the light I set in the light who created all things his name is the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ let me tell you if not him you think I can stand here you all know I cannot stand here but with him huh I don't care I don't care one me I'm going to go on rejoicing I'm going to go on praising the Lord because absent from this body present with the Lord is so real to me so cancer oh no cancer sickness oh no sickness it doesn't bother coffee right happiness will come in me because why I won't let Crow Darkness take over me on don't let cross Darkness take over you you know why people they they are believers but you see they have lots of problems the reason why they don't want to sit in the light for the light to shine upon them because when you sit in the light the light shine every place that is not right God begin to let the preacher preach and do surgery spiritual surgery on the part of you that is not good he begin to do surgery to remove it with a 54 Ministry if I don't get it Pastor will get it Philip will get it Des get it brother Tim will get it then that surgery will clean you up but if you stay home you can't get clean up then that thing will be there and you know even when you eat in a in a bowl when you cook in a bowl you ladies know when you don't clean it what do you think that bow going to do sometime to come it to be stink you understand it will give you when you pick it you you going to close your nose because why you didn't clean the the the bowl you eat inside but if you come and sit down for Sunday Wednesday I'm not saying you shouldn't work but I'm afraid some of us will let work Tak over us and the house of the Lord forsaken right God doesn't like that that's why some of us you see that we have problems we try to solve the problem but let me tell you everything you put [Music] [Applause] you cannot do it you cannot do it but when the Lord says hey I'm going to pay your debt it's just a simple thing you yourself going to know you didn't do it but he did it and it's so simple for you that time you can say my God why couldn't I see only the Lord could do it this is was there like a big mountain hunting me but because why the Lord knows your heart you set in his present all the time I know I'm preaching what I have passed through and what I'm saying if I haven't passed through I cannot preach it a lot of people can preach better than me talk about brother Brown better than me you understand but simple simple simple things like this they haven't passed through and even if you talk about miracles they haven't seen it all they know is the cause of brother Braham cause of the Bible they know it I can't compete with them but let me tell you you talk about signs and wonders God is my witness since I came to this message signs and wonders sometime when I used to live at Driftwood my room carpet I couldn't even afford carpet in the room my wife will be witness we bought pieces of carpet but morning I took you to ni Nick Nick was the place that he live in scabo he was selling carpet his place I went and bought pieces of carpet and put it in my room okay but I was coming to the house of God I know how to even come to the house of God living in shelter whereby I go I reach the shelter 12:00 there's no food I'm waking up and going to work tomorrow I've done all that because why God was trying me and during those times I used to I'm praying 3:00 God is my witness the Lord wake me says kofy go to such and such and such house somebody's praying he need $120 for his baby M his food the Lord can create everything for me God Almighty brother Braham God is my God I've seen that there's a brother he doesn't come regularly but sometime he's sitting here the person told him I've seen all that if you set in the light that light is able to show you things signs wonders raising the dead is nothing to the Lord this gospel brother BR preach and our pastor has preached to us raising the dead should be a biscuit for us should be a biscuit for each and every one of us it's nothing I'm not saying that is the absolute but that should be part of the Gospel but why the people are not coming to the presence of God because something is wrong somewhere I don't care how much you preach how much you think you know about brother Abraham Co show me the token brother Braham the reason why I believe brother Braham he show me the token why do you think make Pentecostal follow brother Braham why do you think you think brother Braham was some mighty man some knowledgeable no no no no no he showed them the token the life that's what I'm talking about the life that is in the word he brought it life so when we yield ourself and the sun the sun is telling us rise Shine the Light has come but a lot of people people they don't want the light that light that has come they want to play with the light listen we woman beings I'm number one we are lazy when it comes to serving the lord I don't know about you but one thing the Lord knows my heart no matter how weak I am no matter what happened to me I love to be in his presence because I know when I come one word from the pet one word from the brother one word from the child mouth one word from the sister I lift up I lift up you understand I lift up if you do like that let me tell you God love you God will love you I am not h a big big big fantasy H preacher or or this but I'm a practical person the way the Lord show me that's what I'm going to bring it okay so let us rise up Shine the Light Has Come Close Darkness we look around the world now we know the whole world is insane we don't need no prophecy to come is already here the ran cars the the car that nobody will drive no human being will drive about four or five years ago that time I was in Toronto I passed some place dandas and airport airport road I'm seeing Toyota raford going corner like that come corner like that going corner and I stood and watch what is this nobody was driving that car and that car was going and I'm looking it was like a Am I Dreaming or something so I really watch it something on top and the car was driving by itself what are we waiting for everything brother Braham spoke is here the churches who go in darkness he says I think he says if Pentecost the Rapture Ty in 50 years Pentecost will be rotten more than the Catholic church and is not so today huh am I lying or truth is the truth right they are rotting more than that right it has get to Madness but let us shine let us come to the presence of God let us let the light that God has place in it in us because the seed is already laying in US that seed need light that it can shine and possess the Gate of his enemy that's all God is asking us he don't need no man interpretation people try to put interpretation this interpretation that all will wind up out God is his own interpreter yes he made the word what play and God hide in Simplicity God obedient is what better than what sacrifice when we give him obedience God will accomplish more than what we think because there's no mountain God cannot move you show me one m Mountain that God can move in your life man life even the preacher life God can move any mountain but he gave us free moral agency and the free moral agency sometime we take it to disgrace most of us we will take it to disgrace I need every one of us that are part of Good Neighbor Ministry I need you you may think brother Kofi don't need you he need you you need me if you says you don't need me you a liar I need you if I says I don't need you I am a liar your words are encouragement to me I'm just telling you you may not know my words are encouragement to you maybe since you met let me have spoke one word to you is encouragement even when a sister tell you God bless you brother tell you God bless you you think it's a joke sometime that's the word of the Lord coming from the brother mouth coming from the sister mouth right a child coming to hug you oh sister I love you you take it for granted and you may look God you know we will woman being oh last night I dream I saw in my dream a man wearing white garment coming with no no no no you don't need that God the light is rising upon thee God light is risen upon thee the seed is already in you and God is saying allowed me set in my presence once you come to Good Neighbor you set here the pastor get up here all the deacons get up here me brother coffee get up here and I pick up the the word of the Lord the Lord will use me in the way he want to use me for you and I'll be a blessing for you there are things you also will be a blessing for me let me tell you I go Mission I know sometime when I go I use some of the blessing that Brothers has preached right from the pulpit here from Pastor Simon to every single one of my brothers W and it's a blessing you may say oh brother brother Ki you are lying brother Chris I give you the brother Daniel H thing I didn't know I was on YouTube I brother Chris I give it to him to watch I Didn't Know My wife just saw it right they just put it there brother Philip had it I go they they they exalt my preaching so powerful is because I set in the light I don't sit home I don't play jokes if you don't see me in church that means sometime things has really happened otherwise I am I am always there amen seriousness I take the word of God serious because I know the light has come and the Darkness is risen upon the people the denomination don't have light not even many in the message have the light that we have here you may go in a country you may see a message church maybe two or three I'm not saying I'm not saying specific is saying two or three but let us make it like that that the spirit of God is moving not everybody call themselves messages a message all it is is message and the life is coming out but in here I am so certain the life is here hallelujah hallelujah the life that passing through the message we G God by his grace is not because we are good you are good or I am good God has given to us by his grace you understand when God gave it to you is not an Indian giver he cannot take it but he want you to recognize it the light has come to you and allowed yourself for that light to shine upon you let me tell you sometime I'm coming to church one time I was so sick I have to come and stay on Tim hon the Apple Bee Line there 3:00 just get sleep there I says should I go home [Music] brother desmon some of you know we that used to come from Toronto let me tell you I used to own Deb close to $50,000 my wife used to cry how we going to pay this house we don't even think of because how are we going to pay that and pay for house but I put my trust in the Lord now I can say as I said I Don't Preach what I haven't passed through so what I'm preaching I have passed through and you know me I could preach strong but otherwise sometime the devil wanted to trap me and let me go off so I'm I I take my time to bring the word that's why it's like that I I understand that but I put my trust in the Lord I don't know use Visa card buying gas and coming to church every it's like things are not going well with me I can I do everything the more I try the more I'm in dead the more I try the more I was in there but my pastor is sitting here asking he know because he bought me in the house but God When God Says Kofi I'm going to bring you out when the Lord God of brother Brown says I am bringing you out not just out of that dead I'm bringing you out I'll make a way for you to get a house because that thing is laying in your heart by Revelation the time came I didn't fear nothing God just moved I saw the hand of God our brother God use him our pastor our brother you know I respect him being the pastor I call him brother too or whatever but the main thing is Pastor I can't speak it well he's my pastor he's my brother he's my friend he's my my my senior brother whatever you may call it I love him okay that's why I said like that and I believe he he understand me where I come from right God move amen pay that dead off you think it's easy to pay 50,000 in this country but God has paid for me I am eyewitness I have a house so when I'm talking to you I I'm just talking what God can do okay I am not just giving lips talk I'm talking what God can do I remember when brother BR Pastor Simon when his time he used to preach and talk about how he want a house and he will go around I used to do as soon as I he that I say that's for brother Kofi same thing let me also start mine listen I don't you don't know oh glory to God when I when I went to my country I did exactly what Pastor Simon did he was going to the houses and says oh one day this house if the Lord bless me I'm going to get it says go around the houses you you remember some of you remember when he preach about that yes amen I did that that time I was in Toronto I take my wife outside and he knows we don't have one s we own a lot and we go the houses and I says andone what house do you like you just tell me one of these days the Lord will make the way it's in me already he will make the way and we're going to get it and we go around my wife oh I know you don't have nothing yet but I I love you don't worry about that I says choose choose one choose it's coming you think I'm joking it's coming that's me I believe I have faith I'm going to put this gospel into the corner no sir I am not that type I am not that type listen this gospel if is taking me to grave I'm going with it amen if it is taking me to the Grave I'm going with it I have test and know that this gospel we have is pure have you put it to test like that have you challenged yourself like that I know not many here [Music] [Music] feel free to speak my heart I said brother let me tell you you brothers and sisters if I live in Ghana I says I don't care in Ghana here there is rich people there is poor as say you see the airport area there those areas have nice nice houses I says listen like I would Target one of those hous yes I'm going to Target it and with revelation I'm going to Zeal that Revelation the Lord has placed on my heart for one house over there and I'm going to get it by Revelation how long it will take I don't care I will get it because I know my God can move a mountain but Abraham God can move a mountain let me tell you it wasn't Willam Braham that was moving the mountains all the sickness and all the dead all the that was walking was the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in William Braham was doing that work and when he died he didn't die in jison Ville or he didn't go to the tomb that spirit is here when we went to brother brother Des Village that Spirit was there with us to let a a stroke King came out and walk the first day I went to Pastor Daniel church there was some commotion there I didn't know nothing I preach and the power of God begin to tell me and I say Brothers this that that that is going on God begin to move my mouth like that I've seen all that I'm I know I'm talking on the line if anybody here even if he here he will tell you even better than what I'm just speaking the church broke into two because some people they want to sit under pastor and gossip and speak against the pastor did they know how pain pastors go through even I'm just a little little little little speaker the Lord is Raising as rais here and let me tell you if you see a true Pastor who the Lord has raised you have to pray day and night for him his family pray day and night for him cuz it's not easy when you come in to preach reach the moment the time reach you have headache you can't sleep you cannot properly do things right it's like you the devil tried to throw you off you remember brother Braham was talking about when the Lord told her to go pray for one one Baptist Deacon daughter that was sick for 9 months he hasn't seen the light and his mommy has prayed even the Deon don't want h brother Brown to come to that place because he says anybody that even goes to brother Braham Church they will exate him or her and her mother was praying and brother Braham was praying and the Lord showed brother Braham go to that house and pray for her and brother Braham what I think he was about eat food and that moment he call and says no I cannot eat cuz the Lord have a work for me to go and do he go and he kneel down in the place he was playing was just like a bush area when he KNE down mosquito tried to bite him when he goes all kinds of trouble and trouble and he forget himself and begin to pray when he went and he prayed that was the place where the girl got up the piano his father came in 9 months he hasn't seen his daughter saw the sunshine and he came in the power of God came in and touched the girl right there and the girl was beginning to play the piano at that moment people thought the girl was dying when they came every that area Revival begin to broke up it's not an easy work Christianity is not an easy joke God is saying the light I have shine upon you all that was in God he pour into Christ all that was in Christ he pour into his wife the bride who is the church is you and me we have the Holy Spirit in us and if we set in the church pray come in the church the Lord will accomplish what he wanted to accomplish for us we think we are waiting for the Rapture to come the Rapture is waiting on us God is letting the Rapture wait on you is how you you surrender then we can get the last one in as soon as the last one com in we meet the Lord in the air and we don't know how we going to meet him unless we surrender surrender is very very important in the Lord when we don't surrender we cannot do the job human sense can't do it we shouldn't try to figure things too much of figuring things will make a disaster because we should let the Lord have his way when the Lord have his way in us the job become what easy and the Lord will accomplish because close darkness is so thick the darkness is so thick that if the Lord light doesn't risen upon thee you can never seee it I'm closing in 5 minutes so don't worry when the light doesn't shine upon the seed that is in thee you can none of us and I can even said it from Pastor to the PE if the pastor can do it how can you sitting in the Pew do it cuz the angel of the Lord if there is anything goes to the pastor first I don't care how spiritual you think you are how much Authority you have how much power you have the angel of the Lord if there is anything it goes to the pastor first and the pastor will see it first even if he doesn't see it sometime God may like to show you little things there little things but all have to go through the pastor to check it to examine it by a lot of people they think they are so spiritual they don't need a true Pastor right but for me Kofi I always need a leadership okay I always even while I'm preaching I need a leadership because without that a leadership it won't be good for me but before I will prove the leader and see that the holy spirit is in him then I Surrender otherwise I don't because God is my number one leader and if he chose a pastor for me I'm willing to follow I'm willing to obey I'm willing for instruction then I know that is leading me to what to meet the Lord in the air and that also applies to you and each and every one of you if you obey what the pastor is preaching then the Lord can do something for you you because otherwise God cannot do anything if you don't want to come to church you don't want to surrender how can God bless you how can God use you for work his work don't you know the Lord Pastor Simon if he here I'm saying this and I know that maybe he watches it or not I don't know but let me say when he was here every time I'm going Africa I tell him brother I'm going here there there there there he tell me go brother go maybe the Lord want to use you there go and God bless you and every time I go God uses me I see signs wonders I can only I have off my data like I can show you where I'm baptizing people the power of God come down proving to the people that it's not brother Kofi is the Lord the god of brother Bram is there I know I believe that and I respect that so I encourage you as our brother has fully taken his position let us stand behind him okay are you with me or not don't be quiet with me like you are in Cemetery I am not a cemetery person I am alive okay that's brother Kofi when I get out from pet then you can talk with me and I don't know what even maybe sometime I said and brother Mike would tell you even my reading the moment I'm coming to preach the reading get brighter when I get out everything gone and if I'm reading locally you see my mouth and I can't read and you know whether I'm lying or telling the truth you know and he helped me a little bit he read and right we are in the back there he's a wonderful brother to me I take him as my respect brother he has done a lot and I thank God for him and I thank God for each and every one of you may God bless each and every one of you if I ever said anything that is contrary to God word may you forgive me come to me I'll make it right if I'm wrong but all in my heart I want if it is one word that that will help you to know the Lord more what he give it to me I have given to you and my heart the Lord knows it may
