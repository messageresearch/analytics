[0:52] the book of life may the great holy
[0:56] spirit take these uh a few words and
[1:01] uh interpret them bless them anoint them

[1:41] the
[1:42] sardis
[1:43] church age
[1:46] amen praise god
[1:48] and in this sardis church age the lord
[1:53] himself speaking to us
[1:56] in

[2:01] he says here
[2:04] behold i
[2:06] come

[2:10] and him that overcome it
[2:14] the same shall be clothed in white

[2:23] out of the book of life
[2:25] what i will confess his name
[2:28] before my father and before his angels
[2:34] he that had an heir
[2:36] to hear
[2:37] let him hear
[2:39] what the spirit saith
[2:42] on to the churches that is the sardis
[2:45] church age revelation chapter 3
[2:49] reading verses 5 and 6
[2:53] and we are
[2:56] teaching or speaking
[2:58] on the book
[3:00] of life
[3:02] now of course we touched on it as i've
[3:05] said
[3:06] last week
[3:08] when we spoke on the book of life
[3:11] and the great white throne
[3:15] judgment
[3:17] however we would
[3:19] specifically focus on the book of life
[3:23] itself
[3:25] of course
[3:27] i'm not the only teacher
[3:29] uh i'm not the only one given uh these
[3:33] things from the word of god
[3:35] but we are just doing our part
[3:38] and sharing with you what we know
[3:43] uh from the word of god i trust that
[3:47] that
[3:48] will be a blessing to your heart
[3:50] and to your soul
[3:52] and that you will not
[3:54] take it as one being spoon fed
[3:58] but as one who will take it go back to
[4:02] the bible back to the word
[4:05] search these things out
[4:08] whether they be true
[4:10] whether they are the word of god study
[4:13] the word of god read the bible read the
[4:17] books hear the sermons during the week
[4:21] and may they be a blessing to your soul
[4:24] to enrich to encourage and to uplift you
[4:29] in your walk with the lord
[4:32] amen
[4:33] hallelujah now to understand our subject
[4:38] more completely and remember i want to
[4:41] repeat i am speaking directly
[4:45] from the storehouse
[4:48] food
[4:49] that has been stored up
[4:53] by the ministry of william marion
[4:56] branham
[4:58] the prophet of this 20th century
[5:01] who has fulfilled malachi 4 5
[5:06] revelation 10 7
[5:09] and has been and is the voice of god
[5:13] to these last days
[5:16] and now praise god the bride of christ
[5:21] the children of god the great multitude
[5:25] the living epistles are on the scene
[5:28] the manifestation of the sons and
[5:30] daughters of god
[5:32] and the revealing
[5:34] of the son of man
[5:37] in his fullness
[5:39] on the face of the earth
[5:41] thanks be to god he that has eyes to see
[5:45] let him see
[5:46] and he who have ears to hear
[5:49] let him hear and recognized for the
[5:53] glory of god
[5:55] hallelujah now we will approach this
[5:57] subject
[5:59] from the point of view of the church
[6:03] through
[6:04] the ages
[6:06] until now we have been focusing
[6:09] upon
[6:10] the removal
[6:12] of the names of individuals
[6:16] from the book of life
[6:18] but we want to consider
[6:21] not the individuals today
[6:24] but groups
[6:26] that are
[6:27] in that book of life
[6:30] and represented
[6:33] in the church
[6:35] plant
[6:37] now to use an analogy used by god
[6:41] servant
[6:43] the record of the wheat plant
[6:48] is the record of the book of life
[6:52] using a wheat plant as an analogy
[6:56] for the book
[6:58] of life
[7:00] i want you to see that the record
[7:05] and
[7:06] process of growth
[7:10] of this wheat plant
[7:13] is similar to
[7:15] the record
[7:17] of the book of life
[7:20] now
[7:21] as we enter into this
[7:25] let us understand when we say book of
[7:29] life the book of life the book of life
[7:33] generalized
[7:35] the book of life
[7:37] as we will find
[7:39] is divided into sections
[7:44] let us look clearly in the word of god
[7:48] because jesus's plan
[7:51] or the plan of god can be seen unfolded
[7:54] or unveiled right here
[7:58] for
[8:00] a seed goes into the ground as jesus
[8:03] said
[8:04] and when the wheat seed is planted
[8:07] it does not come back up alone
[8:10] but it comes back up in a multiplied
[8:13] form
[8:15] this was his original purpose
[8:20] that he would give his life
[8:22] as the planting
[8:24] of the royal seed
[8:27] into the ground
[8:29] that it might be
[8:30] raised up
[8:33] and be multiplied
[8:36] for his spirit
[8:38] would then be available to all
[8:43] the holy spirit of almighty god
[8:47] now available
[8:50] to the true genuine
[8:52] wheat seeds of the living god
[8:56] amen
[8:59] we'll find now that he stands in the
[9:02] midst
[9:03] of the seven church ages
[9:06] similar to how the life
[9:10] goes through the plant
[9:12] so his life
[9:15] has been
[9:16] in the church
[9:18] through the entire
[9:21] process of growth
[9:23] for the bride
[9:25] right through all the ages
[9:28] until
[9:30] the
[9:31] ripening
[9:33] and harvesting time
[9:36] now
[9:38] as the wheat
[9:41] tassel and so on
[9:44] is used as a carrier
[9:47] for natural life to flow through it
[9:51] that it might produce
[9:53] itself in multiplied form
[9:56] and i want you to recognize this
[9:59] the cycle of growth
[10:02] is from
[10:03] original seed
[10:06] through the process
[10:08] of growth
[10:09] and ripening
[10:12] right
[10:13] back into
[10:15] the original seed form
[10:18] but now in multiplied
[10:21] fashion
[10:23] remember from seed
[10:25] back to seed
[10:27] many have been deceived
[10:30] disarmed and many have been misdirected
[10:34] by this
[10:36] in thinking that
[10:38] pentecost
[10:40] is your rival
[10:42] but i'm here to say
[10:44] no pentecost is just the shock
[10:49] that bears the original seed
[10:52] within
[10:55] and we will show
[10:57] as we study
[10:59] the word of the living god
[11:02] hallelujah
[11:03] you see when he gave his life
[11:06] he gave his life so that his life
[11:11] could be
[11:12] supernaturally reproduced
[11:16] into bodies
[11:19] like
[11:20] unto his glorious body
[11:23] a reproduction
[11:25] of himself
[11:29] here it is my friends
[11:31] so we must see the church
[11:34] or mary
[11:36] was only a carrier
[11:39] for the life
[11:41] or for the word of god
[11:44] but she was not the seed
[11:47] the church
[11:48] is not the original seed
[11:51] but only
[11:53] received the blessing and the honor
[11:57] of being the carrier
[12:00] for that life seed
[12:02] amen
[12:04] so that at the resurrection
[12:08] he will see his generation
[12:11] as the bible says
[12:13] for he will see many other royal seeds
[12:17] like unto himself
[12:19] reproduced
[12:21] by his spoken word and now here they are
[12:27] spoken reveal and now manifested
[12:31] before his very eyes oh thanks be to god
[12:36] for this unspeakable gift
[12:38] amen
[12:40] making himself known
[12:42] now let us look clearly this book of
[12:44] life
[12:46] is a book that holds all life
[12:52] natural
[12:54] and spiritual
[12:57] let me repeat
[12:59] the book of life in general
[13:04] is one book
[13:06] that holds the records
[13:10] of
[13:11] all life
[13:14] natural
[13:15] and spiritual
[13:19] if you want to visualize it as a book
[13:22] of two parts
[13:26] the book
[13:29] or you may say
[13:30] two sections
[13:33] but one part
[13:35] of the book of all life
[13:38] being the book of natural life
[13:43] one part
[13:45] can be perceived as the book of all
[13:49] natural
[13:50] life
[13:52] and the next part
[13:55] of course the record of all natural life
[13:58] all natural life comes to an end
[14:03] but the next part or section
[14:06] of that book of life
[14:10] is better known
[14:12] or called the lamb's book of life
[14:17] which is a spiritual record
[14:21] of the lives of those
[14:24] for known to eternal life
[14:29] so
[14:31] to repeat
[14:32] the book of life one general book
[14:36] in specific
[14:38] has a section
[14:40] that is the book
[14:42] of all
[14:43] natural natural life
[14:46] from organisms
[14:49] right on my friends
[14:52] right on through
[14:55] insects
[14:57] right through
[14:59] to the fullness of his creation
[15:01] individuals
[15:03] everything is specifically in that part
[15:07] of the book of life
[15:09] the book of natural life
[15:12] and the other part or section
[15:16] is the book of eternal life
[15:20] better known
[15:22] the lamb's book of
[15:24] life and that holds the records
[15:29] of the lives and names of those all
[15:34] those who have
[15:37] eternal life life with no end one book
[15:41] holds the lies that will end one book
[15:44] holds the lies
[15:46] with no ending whatsoever amen thanks be
[15:51] to god hallelujah amen
[15:54] so
[15:55] the record of this wheat plant then
[16:00] is to reproduce
[16:03] is the process
[16:05] it's illustrating
[16:07] it's revealing
[16:09] it's making it visual for us to see
[16:12] how that god
[16:15] was able to plant his life
[16:18] so that it may be
[16:20] multiplied
[16:22] and come back
[16:25] like and exactly as the original seed
[16:30] in multiplied form
[16:34] the book of life let me repeat
[16:37] the history or record
[16:40] of a wheat plant
[16:42] is the book of life
[16:46] which is a part
[16:49] of the
[16:51] overall
[16:52] or general book of life
[16:56] amen praise god
[16:58] that is one part the other part
[17:02] is the book of eternal life
[17:06] the lamb's book of life
[17:09] hallelujah
[17:11] my friends so then we see
[17:14] that by examining this we plant
[17:20] we see a process
[17:23] a seed
[17:24] is sown
[17:28] a blade or life is grown
[17:32] but it is not the wheat as yet
[17:36] it's just gone from seed
[17:38] to blade
[17:40] but it is not the seed as yet
[17:43] then it becomes a stalk
[17:46] but that is not the seeders yet
[17:50] and it grows through
[17:52] until it bears a tassel
[17:56] but the tassel
[17:58] amen is not the cedars yet
[18:02] that castle has got to be pollinated
[18:06] and when it's pollinated
[18:09] which is like equivalent to receiving
[18:12] the holy ghost or receiving revelation
[18:16] for divine pollination to produce a
[18:19] supernatural manifestation of god's own
[18:23] original life glory to god hallelujah
[18:27] this is the mystery of god me and made
[18:31] manifest that we can see and understand
[18:35] with clarity and simplicity the fullness
[18:39] of the mind of the living god amen
[18:42] praise god so as we look
[18:46] we can see
[18:47] there's a planting time
[18:50] there's a growing process a growing
[18:53] cycle that must go on
[18:57] and then
[18:58] there
[18:59] after that maturity of growth
[19:03] comes a ripening and a seasoning and a
[19:05] sweetening time
[19:07] oh my god may every believer come
[19:10] through this process
[19:12] may every one of us experience this
[19:15] marvelous and wonderful secret growth of
[19:18] the living god hallelujah
[19:21] and then after
[19:23] the ripening time
[19:26] when the sourness
[19:28] of attitudes
[19:30] the greenness
[19:32] the carnality
[19:34] the selfishness
[19:36] the stubbornness the self-will
[19:39] and so on of man
[19:42] is purged out
[19:44] then we find that believer
[19:47] with the
[19:48] sweetness
[19:50] of the character and person of christ
[19:54] christ in you
[19:55] your hope of glory amen
[19:59] then comes the harvesting time
[20:02] o praise god when they harvests come
[20:07] amen
[20:08] and the spirit crawls
[20:11] and comes to pick his fruit again
[20:14] glory be to god may we be sweet fruit to
[20:19] meet our lord at the time of his coming
[20:22] glory
[20:23] may we be ready to be received by the
[20:27] lord or praise god forevermore
[20:30] hallelujah
[20:32] that's why jesus gave his life
[20:35] that he may come back upon the church in
[20:38] pollination in the form of the holy
[20:40] spirit that he might bring many sons
[20:43] unto glory unto himself amen and bring
[20:48] them into the glory of a rapture and a
[20:52] resurrection we're in the midst of it
[20:54] right now while i am yet speaking we're
[20:57] in the midst of the supernatural process
[21:00] of god hallelujah
[21:02] but the wheat seed
[21:04] had to have a carrier
[21:08] to bring forth his multiplied with seed
[21:12] hallelujah
[21:14] and so there have to be a mary
[21:18] to be the carrier
[21:20] to bring forth christ
[21:22] the word
[21:24] she was not the originator of the word
[21:27] it did not originate from her
[21:30] originate from her
[21:32] it did not come from her
[21:34] it only passed through her
[21:37] and god ordained or designated her to be
[21:41] honored and blessed
[21:43] to be the carrier
[21:45] for himself
[21:47] the word of god
[21:49] to be revealed in flesh
[21:52] not by the will of man
[21:54] not by the blood of man
[21:57] but by the word of god and by the
[21:59] manifestation
[22:01] of the blessed
[22:02] holy spirit
[22:04] so even as mary was honored and blessed
[22:07] and used of god
[22:10] to be the carrier
[22:12] not the originator
[22:14] so
[22:15] has the church
[22:17] through the church ages
[22:20] being used of the living god
[22:23] to be
[22:24] the carrier
[22:26] for the
[22:27] word of god the original seed
[22:31] word of god
[22:32] not the originator
[22:35] she is not to speak of her own
[22:38] she is not to talk a lot of bull without
[22:42] the fullness of the word and spirit
[22:46] operating and moving and vindicating and
[22:49] confirming
[22:51] that it is him
[22:53] he the lord
[22:54] she is only
[22:56] being used
[22:58] as a carrier
[23:00] to bear the word of life
[23:04] amen
[23:06] so that the word can come back
[23:09] to its original form
[23:12] so the church cooperate
[23:15] through the seven church ages
[23:17] has been the carrier
[23:20] of the true seed
[23:22] though she herself is not i repeat she
[23:26] herself is not the true seed
[23:30] mary is not the true seed so the church
[23:35] is not
[23:36] the true seed hallelujah but the
[23:41] record
[23:43] of the church the record
[23:46] of the
[23:48] general book of life my friend
[23:52] is the
[23:54] book or record of the life or history of
[23:58] the entire wheat plant
[24:01] hallelujah
[24:03] let me repeat again
[24:06] like a carpenter
[24:08] nailing nails
[24:10] doesn't hit the hammer than the hell
[24:12] once
[24:13] but he hits it over and over again
[24:16] that it might really clinch in the heart
[24:20] hallelujah
[24:22] the original seed
[24:24] force was planted
[24:27] it was sown
[24:29] and then it had to be grown
[24:32] amen
[24:34] later it produced a stalk
[24:37] amen
[24:39] but the stock
[24:42] was not
[24:43] the original seed
[24:45] the blade
[24:46] was not
[24:48] the original seed
[24:50] amen
[24:52] and then from that came the castle
[24:55] amen
[24:57] that still was not
[24:59] the original seed
[25:02] husks
[25:04] and the wheat began to form within that
[25:07] the husk
[25:09] amen was not
[25:11] and is not the original ste seed
[25:15] amen
[25:17] for the seed will never
[25:20] be ear with the shock or the husks amen
[25:25] praise god
[25:26] hallelujah the pollen fell
[25:31] on the tassels
[25:33] like the holy spirit has come to
[25:35] fall upon us
[25:38] comes by
[25:40] grace revelation is by grace alone
[25:46] the holy spirit of almighty god
[25:50] reveals himself to whom he will reveal
[25:53] himself
[25:55] we cannot attract his attention by
[25:57] theology
[25:58] by the wisdom of man
[26:01] god is not attracted
[26:03] by all these man-made makeups
[26:07] oh
[26:08] but he's attracted by the recognition
[26:11] of the identity of his life and his
[26:14] spirit
[26:15] within that individual
[26:18] and the spirit of god
[26:21] by revelation pollinates that life
[26:25] that was laying in there
[26:28] not even recognized by itself
[26:31] but now identified and recognized and to
[26:35] be vindicated and manifested
[26:38] by the great holy spirit who comes to
[26:41] claim his own glory be to god hallelujah
[26:46] and so
[26:47] my friend
[26:48] the plant
[26:50] is
[26:51] pollinated
[26:53] let me share with you
[26:56] a truth here
[26:59] how
[27:00] a woman cannot produce a child
[27:04] without association
[27:07] with a man
[27:10] the hen
[27:12] can't produce good eggs
[27:15] without the rooster
[27:17] she may
[27:19] by human
[27:21] insemination
[27:23] through science
[27:26] satan and his means
[27:28] reproduce a counterfeit
[27:31] membership
[27:32] in her in her pews
[27:36] or in her numbers
[27:38] multitudes of them
[27:41] but that is not the original seed
[27:44] for it must first be pollinated
[27:47] by the original seed
[27:50] and without that
[27:52] you have a nest of rotten eggs
[27:55] or a church full
[27:57] of nominal
[27:58] believers
[28:00] christianity and name only
[28:03] but true
[28:04] sons and daughters of the living god
[28:07] are brought forth
[28:09] from the very minds or loins of god
[28:13] hallelujah
[28:15] and so is it my friend
[28:18] the church
[28:20] cannot produce members on her own
[28:24] even though she used insemination of
[28:26] theology
[28:28] she used insemination
[28:31] true
[28:32] colleges universities human education
[28:35] human will and skill
[28:38] that will not produce the original soup
[28:43] seed
[28:45] it can only produce counterfeits
[28:50] to the word of god
[28:53] until god himself
[28:55] produces
[28:57] his own
[28:58] original seed
[29:01] and come back to himself
[29:05] or what it was
[29:07] in the original
[29:11] and the plant
[29:12] has to go through this process
[29:15] for it was produced
[29:18] for this direct process
[29:22] the church was made and created
[29:25] for this process
[29:28] not for the church to be the seed
[29:31] but for the seed to pass through the
[29:33] church
[29:34] the church was produced to be the
[29:37] carrier
[29:39] or the bearer of the seed of god
[29:43] she was created to this end
[29:47] and that's the part that she must play
[29:50] amen so that the seed
[29:53] may go through its cycle
[29:55] and go back to being
[29:57] seed again
[30:00] hallelujah
[30:01] amen
[30:03] that
[30:04] so
[30:05] that part of the wheat plant
[30:09] that seed part of the wheat plant not
[30:12] the other parts
[30:13] but the seed
[30:15] is
[30:16] the eternal life that passed through her
[30:19] amen
[30:21] we have a perfect type
[30:24] of when like when israel went into egypt
[30:29] they all
[30:30] two million of them strong came out
[30:34] of egypt through the sacrificial blood
[30:37] of christ
[30:38] millions of people have left the world
[30:42] the flesh and the devil
[30:44] to come into the
[30:46] confines or the umbrella
[30:49] of the
[30:50] church in general
[30:52] and there they are
[30:54] many were baptized they were baptized in
[30:58] the red sea
[30:59] so many have been baptized confirmed
[31:03] christian whatever
[31:05] within the church
[31:08] the general
[31:09] church
[31:11] all came out of the waters
[31:15] pentecost
[31:16] came millions enjoyed
[31:20] the baptism and manifestations
[31:26] of the genuine holy spirit
[31:30] sent from god above
[31:32] upon his people
[31:35] amen
[31:37] and enjoy that
[31:39] even in our day
[31:42] when god sent his angel as he did back
[31:45] then listen to his voice
[31:49] oh my
[31:51] and we have eaten up this message
[31:55] we have eaten
[31:56] angels food in this day and in this hour
[32:00] until some people are getting tired of
[32:02] it
[32:03] they're tired of eating angel food they
[32:06] want to go back and eat their worldly
[32:10] meats and things that they can have in
[32:12] the world that's tasty and nice
[32:15] according to them when god gave them
[32:18] this word this message this hour this
[32:22] angel's food that may be not tasty to
[32:26] you because you're eating it over and
[32:28] over repetitiously but it is meant for
[32:32] your good
[32:33] amen
[32:34] all enjoyed the waters of life
[32:39] many and all it
[32:42] of angel's food
[32:45] all drank of the rock
[32:48] hallelujah for this true revelation
[32:52] has followed
[32:54] the church and the history and life of
[32:56] the church
[32:58] like the scarlet cord from rehab
[33:01] right through the bible from cover to
[33:04] cover
[33:05] the
[33:06] marking line of redemption
[33:09] the red stream of the blood of christ
[33:13] oh praise god forevermore
[33:16] something for us to hang on to
[33:19] something for us to believe
[33:21] and to recognize
[33:23] his life
[33:25] my friends
[33:26] but even though they all
[33:29] participated
[33:31] very few
[33:33] were able to come out
[33:35] joshua and caleb
[33:37] and the young ones
[33:41] and were able to enter
[33:43] into canaan's land
[33:46] remember
[33:48] all israel
[33:50] is not israel
[33:54] all who says they're jew
[33:57] is not a jew
[34:00] but they're liars
[34:03] my friends
[34:04] all who claim they are real genuine
[34:08] christians
[34:09] are not all christians
[34:12] but are liars
[34:14] to the word of god
[34:17] all who claim
[34:19] their believers
[34:22] of william branham's message
[34:25] are not all
[34:27] message believers
[34:30] they're all not the true seed of god
[34:34] for god selects that god elects that god
[34:38] knows that in his own mind and thoughts
[34:41] and he does that for his glory and no
[34:44] one else can
[34:46] for the message is less like a net
[34:49] that is called many to the word
[34:52] but then there comes
[34:54] when he begins to take out the spiders
[34:59] and the
[35:00] frogs and the rats and the foxes and the
[35:04] snakes
[35:06] and everything
[35:08] that's been hiding in there
[35:10] under this message in the net
[35:13] but they are
[35:15] and the power the holy spirit is upon us
[35:18] the true light now shines
[35:21] upon the heart and into the
[35:24] dark parts and the crevices of our souls
[35:29] revealing himself to us in this day
[35:33] and in this hour
[35:36] amen
[35:37] the same thing is in the church today
[35:42] names that are
[35:45] in the book of life
[35:48] many names
[35:50] in the book of life
[35:52] will be completely blotted out
[35:55] of the book of life that is to say
[35:58] the book of natural life
[36:01] that life is a life that will end
[36:04] and when the bible speaks about your
[36:06] names blotted out
[36:09] if your name is taken out of the book of
[36:11] natural life
[36:13] it comes as if you never even existed
[36:18] you are not even there
[36:22] so just to have your name left on the
[36:24] natural book that you were you were
[36:26] there
[36:28] that in itself
[36:29] is a blessing even though you will not
[36:32] be in eternal life
[36:34] but there are many
[36:36] whose names will be
[36:38] removed or blotted out
[36:42] from the book
[36:44] of life remember book of life in general
[36:47] made up of two sections
[36:49] the book of natural life
[36:52] and the book of eternal life better
[36:55] known as the lamb's book of life
[37:00] now notice carefully here
[37:03] hallelujah
[37:05] names will be bought blotted out
[37:09] of the
[37:10] natural book of life
[37:13] but no names will and can be blotted out
[37:18] of the lamb's book of life
[37:20] for he has said
[37:22] i will lose none
[37:24] not one
[37:26] praise god
[37:28] joseph's bones not one will be lost or
[37:32] left behind
[37:34] but he said every one
[37:37] i
[37:38] will bring them out every one to be
[37:42] saved by the grace of god
[37:46] amen
[37:48] this book of eternal life
[37:52] this lamb's book of life
[37:56] it is a record
[37:58] that god
[37:59] had given us eternal life
[38:02] and that life is in his son
[38:06] he that had the son
[38:08] had life
[38:10] hallelujah
[38:12] and he that hath not the son
[38:16] but not
[38:17] eternal
[38:18] life
[38:20] hallelujah praise god you see those who
[38:23] have eternal life now listen eternal
[38:27] life
[38:28] eternal without beginning
[38:30] without ending which means to say
[38:35] that those who have eternal life now
[38:38] were known by him
[38:41] were recognized by him for they already
[38:45] had eternal life in him
[38:49] with him
[38:50] and in him
[38:52] before
[38:53] the foundation
[38:55] of the world
[38:57] for they were apart
[39:00] of
[39:01] the great royal seed
[39:04] according to ephesians 1
[39:07] they were chosen
[39:09] in him
[39:11] the true royal
[39:12] seed before the foundation
[39:16] of the world
[39:18] jesus himself
[39:20] was planted
[39:21] or in other words he died
[39:24] that his life may come up true
[39:27] the wheat seed plant of the church
[39:32] of the church i say his life is only
[39:36] going to pass through the church
[39:38] to reproduce itself
[39:41] in multitudes of other wheat seeds
[39:44] having the same life in them
[39:48] because of their the same original
[39:52] spirit
[39:53] of him
[39:55] and they are original
[39:57] as he is original
[40:00] so that's why he came to redeem them
[40:05] or buy them
[40:07] back
[40:08] hallelujah if you're redeeming something
[40:12] it means you already had it before
[40:15] and the thing became lost
[40:18] so when it became lost
[40:20] you went to the devil's pawn shop you
[40:24] went to the devon's prison house
[40:27] and you bought back
[40:29] that witch
[40:30] you lost for you seen it there and you
[40:34] bought it back
[40:36] hallelujah
[40:37] and jesus christ paid the price
[40:40] not with silver and gold nor the
[40:42] corruptable things of man
[40:45] am i
[40:46] but we were redeemed by the precious
[40:49] blood of jesus christ himself
[40:52] who led down his life
[40:55] amen
[40:57] and he's redeeming or bringing her back
[41:01] just like adam
[41:04] eve was a part of him to begin with
[41:09] the original seed was a part
[41:13] of the logos the lord jesus himself
[41:18] from the eternities past
[41:22] and came down to this earth and were
[41:24] lost
[41:26] but now he has come to redeem her
[41:30] with his own precious blood
[41:33] to bring her back to his side
[41:37] where she was to begin with
[41:40] as eve was in adam
[41:44] so must we be brought back
[41:47] to his side
[41:49] hallelujah
[41:51] and so
[41:53] the member
[41:54] names
[41:55] of his elected
[41:57] can never
[41:59] be removed from off the book of eternal
[42:02] life
[42:03] for she is a part of him
[42:07] she sits on the throne
[42:10] with him
[42:13] she can never be judged
[42:16] because she
[42:18] will and is in the throne with him
[42:23] at the white tron judgment
[42:26] to judge the entire world amen praise
[42:31] god remember the world will not be
[42:34] judged by church but it will be judged
[42:37] by the word
[42:39] he is the word and she is a part of the
[42:42] word messiah and messiahs christ and his
[42:46] bride hallelujah
[42:48] bridegroom and bride
[42:50] seated on the throne
[42:52] judgment is set amen praise god
[42:57] hallelujah
[42:58] everyone
[43:00] that is in the bride
[43:03] is a member of him
[43:05] and he he will lose none of them
[43:10] hallelujah but that has nothing to do
[43:13] with all are in the book just like all
[43:17] were in israel
[43:19] doesn't mean that all goes to canaan
[43:22] doesn't mean all goes to the promised
[43:24] land only a few
[43:27] that's why jesus said fair not little
[43:30] flock
[43:31] it is my father's good pleasure to give
[43:34] you the kingdom amen
[43:36] just a faithful few
[43:39] hallelujah
[43:41] will be brought out
[43:43] by his mighty hand
[43:45] because remember
[43:48] in the entire book of life in general
[43:51] there's that section where there is
[43:53] judith
[43:55] there is pharaoh
[43:56] nebuchadnezzar
[43:58] and many others
[44:00] of that like
[44:02] their names are in that book of natural
[44:05] life yes they were there yes they
[44:06] existed yes and so on and some of them
[44:10] their names will even be removed from
[44:12] that
[44:14] and they will be as if they never even
[44:16] existed
[44:18] in the face
[44:20] of the entire world
[44:23] hallelujah
[44:24] and so in these last days in which we
[44:27] live
[44:28] many will come saying have we not done
[44:30] great works
[44:33] said great things done great things in
[44:35] your name so did judas
[44:38] have we not done great works
[44:41] they'll cast out devils
[44:43] they'll be miracle men
[44:45] they'll have mass crusades with
[44:48] thousands of people in them
[44:50] they'll be great speakers great teachers
[44:53] well known as in the book of genesis men
[44:57] of renown
[44:59] great dignitaries
[45:01] multitudes following them have we not
[45:04] cast out devils in their name have we
[45:07] not done wonderful works
[45:10] and jesus will say as the bible says
[45:13] i never knew you
[45:16] that is to say
[45:19] he is not not that he is not aware of
[45:22] them
[45:24] but he is saying
[45:26] i never foreknew you
[45:29] you are not a part of my concern
[45:34] in this book of eternal life
[45:39] or the lamb's book
[45:41] of life
[45:43] amen
[45:44] because we know by god's omniscience
[45:48] he knows everything
[45:50] hallelujah but what he is saying here
[45:53] they were never for known in him they
[45:57] cannot deceive him
[45:58] they weren't in him
[46:00] to begin with
[46:01] they were not part
[46:03] of his wife or who came from his side
[46:07] they are not part of the word
[46:10] that came out or issued out from him
[46:14] amen
[46:15] and now they're coming back to make a
[46:17] claim
[46:18] and he says no
[46:20] i never knew you
[46:23] i never foreknew you
[46:25] you were not in my mind you were not in
[46:27] my for knowledge
[46:29] amen
[46:30] hallelujah
[46:31] they were not for known
[46:34] as the bride
[46:35] of christ is foreknown
[46:38] neither were therefore known
[46:41] like some of the righteous dead
[46:44] that will come up in the second
[46:47] resurrection
[46:48] because they have no fruit they bear no
[46:51] fruit there there is no
[46:53] there nothing outside of the word of god
[46:57] and they did not abide
[47:00] within the word therefore there will be
[47:03] sentence
[47:05] to death
[47:06] but before
[47:07] that takes place
[47:09] there's going to be a binding
[47:13] they're going to be a binding
[47:15] hallelujah
[47:17] and we find that when there's a binding
[47:20] my friends together
[47:24] oh let me say this way
[47:29] the books are going to be open
[47:32] harvest is ending
[47:34] and ended
[47:36] but
[47:38] when we read in the book of psalms
[47:43] i believe it's the 87th psalm
[47:46] where the misconception of many comes
[47:48] from
[47:49] where it reads
[47:50] the when the lord writes up the names
[47:54] of those who were born in zion
[47:58] when when they read that they believe
[48:01] god is now writing up names
[48:03] but that is really speaking simply
[48:08] of the roll call
[48:10] in heaven
[48:13] how that god
[48:15] will call out the names
[48:19] of those who are recorded
[48:22] in the lamb's book of life not that he
[48:25] doesn't know the names he doesn't have
[48:27] to write a a new book
[48:30] because he knows the names but this is
[48:32] speaking of raw call in heaven
[48:36] have you called your names out
[48:38] amen before all that are there
[48:43] because his promise
[48:44] i will confess
[48:47] the name
[48:49] before my father
[48:51] before all the angels
[48:54] amen
[48:55] it's wrong called time in heaven
[48:58] if a man dies shall he live again
[49:03] all the days of my appointed time i'll
[49:06] wait
[49:08] until my change come
[49:10] hallelujah
[49:12] and thou shalt call
[49:15] and i
[49:16] will answer thee
[49:18] thou shalt have a desire to the work of
[49:21] thy their your hands
[49:24] that will call and i will answer it's
[49:27] wrong call in heaven it's not writing a
[49:30] new book but it's the calling
[49:33] of the names
[49:34] of those who have been redeemed
[49:38] and called back to glory
[49:41] for the great
[49:42] shepherd is now calling
[49:46] his sheep
[49:48] and not in general
[49:49] but calling them by name
[49:53] by their names for the seals are now
[49:57] open
[49:59] names are being called
[50:01] the identification by revelation through
[50:04] the holy spirit
[50:07] is calling out those names
[50:11] oh praise god so that they let me
[50:15] recognize who they are
[50:18] amen it's not for god to recognize but
[50:22] for them to recognize who they
[50:24] are the creative voice of god is calling
[50:28] them forth
[50:29] from the dust from the denominations
[50:34] changing their atoms
[50:37] even though
[50:38] they have not yet fallen asleep
[50:42] what is it it's the rapture
[50:45] it's the process of the rapture
[50:48] until the event
[50:50] but the rapture process is now in
[50:53] progress
[50:54] and the great shepherd
[50:57] is now calling his sheep
[51:02] and he's calling them with specificity
[51:05] calling them by their names
[51:10] hallelujah
[51:13] the seals
[51:16] have been opened
[51:19] the names are being called
[51:23] hallelujah john heard his own name and
[51:26] saw his own name back there that's why
[51:29] he cried out
[51:31] oh praise god hallelujah the lion of the
[51:35] tribe of judah took the book broke the
[51:38] seals and now has come back to claim
[51:41] those whose names are in the book oh
[51:44] blessed be the name of the lord it is
[51:47] the rapture it's the marriage supper of
[51:50] the lamb and his bride the rapture my
[51:53] friends
[51:56] it's not the only wrong grow call
[51:59] but the second resurrection there'll be
[52:02] another role called the wrong call of
[52:05] the rest of them that makes up
[52:08] that
[52:10] book of eternal life
[52:12] for all in the book
[52:15] or the lamb's book of life
[52:17] are not the bride
[52:19] some will be servants some will be
[52:21] assistance to the bride and so on that's
[52:25] something else to give the breakdown of
[52:28] that entire
[52:29] lamb's book of life but in there will be
[52:32] the bride the 144 thousand souls under
[52:36] the altar the
[52:38] the laws of the second resurrection
[52:41] those given eternal life and so on
[52:45] they're my friends what a time that will
[52:48] be at the great white throne judgment
[52:52] when
[52:53] names will be confessed before his
[52:56] father
[52:57] and before all the angels amen i tell
[53:01] you the sweetest sound to the human air
[53:06] is to hear their own name
[53:09] called out in love
[53:11] oh my
[53:13] it touches the heart it trills the soul
[53:16] the sweetest sound to human ears amen
[53:21] hallelujah and there are some in the
[53:24] fleshly realm they just love to hear
[53:27] their names called
[53:29] amen before people
[53:31] love of acclaim and so on
[53:34] but let me tell you no artly voice
[53:39] will sound like this voice for it will
[53:42] be the voice of god calling out to his
[53:46] beloved brine
[53:48] be the voice of god
[53:50] calling out your name
[53:53] out of the lamb's
[53:54] book of life
[53:58] which names
[53:59] remain to be revealed
[54:03] before the holy angels
[54:06] of the living god
[54:08] hallelujah oh what a day

[55:25] the lamb's book of life and what the
