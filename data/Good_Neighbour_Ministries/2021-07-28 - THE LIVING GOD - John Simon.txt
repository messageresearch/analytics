TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good evening france once again we are happy to be in the house of the lord and with joy we gather together to turn our hearts and our attention to the lord god most high oh the holy hills of heaven called me to mansion's fair across the sea where loved ones wait and crowns are given o the hills of home they're calling me may you hear the call may you feel the pull may you recognize that the lord god of heaven is giving his last altar call and calling his children to his side come home come home it's supper time thank god many of his children are going back to him the word of god and i'm happy to be here with you and to share with you the word of god for this day and for this hour we will read tonight out of the scriptures revelation chapter 2 reading from verse 23 and 24. amen and i will kill her children with death i will kill her which means jezebel's children with death and all the churches shall know that i am he which search at the reigns on hearts and i will give unto every one of you according to your works here ends our scripture reading a gracious righteous loving heavenly father we ask your blessing upon this the bread of life break thou this bread of life lord quicken us together lift us up into your divine presence and lord give us a clear crystal clear waters from the rivers of life that flows by the trees that beareth all the fruits of god amen may a great holy spirit now bless us father one and all everywhere within the divine sound of the gospel of jesus christ and to the glory of your eternal kingdom this we ask in jesus name amen and amen god the god of the living in our last talk we spoke about this woman jezebel her evil our wicked uh heart and her evil acts we spoke of our evil deeds of the children she bore and that took her teachings her way of life followed in her footsteps and did whatsoever she did now in israel we know that if jezebel did not only married ahab but in judah she got her daughter to marry jehoram the king of judah at that time and the minute or the moment that that marriage took place between jehoram and jezebel's daughter that moment the tribe of judah began to die spiritually we find out friends in the same manner the moment rome married herself to organization systems religious systems of religious orders and of how to set up or organize religion that moment the church of the living god died death began to set in to the church and which you know she went into the dark ages before she could have a resurrection by lutheran revival then the wesleyan revival then later on out of the methodist or wesleyan revival came the great move of god the pentecostal revival took place and the moment the pentecostals began to organize themselves into organizational groups oneness trinitarian this that various various names of blasphemy they literally my friends the moment they received organization and established themselves by organization spiritual death set in upon that move of god which started originally genuinely from the hand of god corrupted by satan with his organizational strategies causing the church to fall into death now of course we know that the church married herself as jezebel uh ahab married jezebel so has the church married herself to false doctrine ahab married jezebel who was the priestess of paganism and now the modern church has married itself to false doctrine and denomination or let's use the word married or joined herself too it's as if you joined a denomination you married yourself under that denominational name as a woman takes on the man's name they have taken on the name of baptist mother this catholic uh presbyterian united whatever the name might be they took that name on and like many women today they want to add a second name which it might be you know smith brown or whatever in that same way they want to say i'm a baptist christian no you're either a christian or you're a baptist you're either a christian or you're a catholic oh praise god you take on the name of jesus christ hallelujah and his name is the only name we bear the name of a genuine true christian and so we are not to marry ourselves to organization for uh to marry yourself to an organization is to enter into a downward slide you may feel exhilarated you may feel uplifted naturally speaking but spiritually you have entered into the realms of spiritual death because death or organization comes and the church dies the individual dies i want to thank god using for a theme tonight we are not the god of the dead or of organization we are a god of the living of the living word amen so we are we are children of god the living god we live by the word we walk with the word of god organization is death amen death anyone that joins themselves to organization has joined themselves to spiritual death and are doomed to die the death spiritually speaking amen hallelujah my friends here we are eve just as much as eve brought death to the entire human race and so now organization has brought death to any move of god any revival that god gives organizational structures and they're masters of it at this time it has become a science it's become a religious science that is teachable in universities in various colleges they have developed sciences of how to replicate how to multiply it how to do it they learn all the sciences of religion and how to pass that on but my friends the genuine spirit of god by real election and by revelation can not be given to anyone else god himself is the only one that can transform that supernatural knowledge and wisdom and teaching and upbringing that we all need from the hands of our heavenly father amen the church through the vehicle of organization organization of course brings into your life and into the life of that church the twin corrupters the twin demons of nicolasianism and balaamism and uh they're usually propagated by jezebel back there now by the false church in this hour that they are propagating that kind of a teaching and atmosphere within their ranks of total obedience and my friends here it is in the word of god now we know that eve should have been judged along with the serpent amen she only had a partial judgment but adam intervened on her behalf amen hallelujah and by joining himself to her his wife she was saved or redeemed by marriage through the grace of god the oneness with adam is what saved her because for god to slay her he would have to slay himself he'd have to slay adam and destroy this great work so we are so happy today that when we were in sin we walked the ways of sin we wandered away in darkness we allowed ourselves to be tossed and tempted and driven along by the tides of time but thank god jesus christ my friends has inserted himself into our experiences oh glory be to god hallelujah and he has intervened on our behalf the bible tells us but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by his traits we are healed oh thank god we are healed because he intervened he took stood before us and took the spear trusts the sword trusts the nail prints the scoffings the mockings and everything else and has redeemed us because we have you been we are united with him true faith in his name indeed we serve a god of the living the living word of god we serve it all our hearts and with all our lives of course this satanic religion coming down from babylon through jezebel and many other uh various individuals has snaked his way in the trail of the serpent down to our day in our time through the ages in so much that the church has again wandered away from her husband the word finds herself under the charming spell of the evil serpent of genesis now in the supernatural form of satanic religion and influence and has wandered away from the original word of god and she now has no one to intervene on her behalf all that is left that we can see ahead is judgment only for the elect we see rapture resurrection and next after that oh there's darkness of tribulation and the ages of judgment that are to come one day the fire will not just be on the west coast oh the fire will fall from the heavens oh praise god all my friends let us see clearly here she the modern church will be burnt by the supernatural fires of god burnt along with her seducer that liar from the beginning the serpent who was not a snake as we visualize it in our seat today because we know it was a is the missing link between man and the animals in between was the serpent whom the bible says was one who could walk who could talk the bible says he was intelligent subtle smart everything else like that built like a man shaped like a man looked like a man but my friends he had a place for a soul but no place in him no soul no soul inside of him or empty caverns and here my friends she will have no one to intervene on her behalf because she allowed herself to be seduced by this father of lies in this last day and that harlot and her children and the antichrist and satan himself will all find their places in the lake of fire amen revelation 18 when you have the time read that and you will read the burning of the false church where the prophet john speaks saying he looked and saw a man and also heard a voice saying whoa whoa whoa whoa for in one hour babylon has fallen she has fallen she has fallen and the bible describes the scene of the smoke and the blossoms of flame that were going everywhere while this great mystery babylon was being burned by the supernatural fires of the living god and then the bible said it'll take one hour only that special fire is gonna burn her in one hour and all the merchants the kings of the earth and many others that joined with her in this evil worldwide system of corruption through the instrumentality of denomination flowing out of babylon those natural rivers now we have the spiritual rivers of babylon that are flowing full today and my friends reproducing evil oh my friends think about it let the holy spirit guide you and take your thoughts and move beyond the boundaries of human thinking think of how the living god so merciful that after the church failed amen the early church fell then the catholic church from the nicene council took the word of god originally they started out with the genuine water baptism in the name of jesus christ oh and they fell away from the original face of one god to three and then went into the dark ages out of which came the lutheran movement from the womb or bowels of the catholic church for she was the harlot of she is the harlot of revelation where she bore children and the first one was the lutheran uh group and out of whom later came the methodists and then later came the pentecostal groups but when the pentecost died when she accepted organization and died god went outside of the pentecostal ranks god went into the highways the byways the hedges the little house churches the little groups the little men and no bodies the street corners the brush harbors wherever there could be true sons and daughters of god to be found god found them hallelujah and god used the voice of the seventh angel william marion branham to call out his children what not by the attraction of the things of the world but first by the first pull of healing the first attraction through his healing ministry and a greater attraction by his discerning of the spirits of men and now the last attraction the pull of christ if i be lifted up i'll draw men unto myself here he comes the revelation of the word of god oh to some it will be like dry manna that they at over and over again in the wilderness and they began to despise it but the real true believer amen hallelujah the word of god is all the attraction they need whoa music is fine and we love to have that and it's great if we have it all the other wonderful additions and uh flowery stuff we can have around it it's marvelous and wonderful and it's good to have but my friends the genuine attraction is to have let the word have his true place of preeminence leadership and headship over the body of jesus christ hallelujah and so the word of god the holy spirit went beyond the pentecostal groups for you can't put god in a box shut the box and think you're going to keep him in there i tell you brother the jail house has rocked and the prisoners are loose amen oh praise god they're loosed but they're not just loose but wild like to themselves their prisoners to christ hallelujah and they're led by the word of the living god moving with him and led by his spirit amen o praise club and so a healing discerning revival swept the world under the message amen of the seventh angel of revelation 10 verse 7 bringing the word of god prophesied in the bible for this day and for this time many will not accept it but to those for whom this is ordained this is foreordained god's spirit is calling god's spirit is speaking god's spirit is directing his word to his elected bride and calling her to attention of his word that revival has swept the world many of them think many think that because william branham is dead and died in a car crash very similar to elijah going up in a fiery chariot uh of those days this one goes up in a chariot of this day but there it is my friends they think because he lived there and died and he prayed for thousands and none prayed for him while he laid there the midst the carnage and the wreckage of that car but his message which they thought would die and maybe it's dried up and died and gone away and disappeared many have tried to insert themselves to become the next leader of this message not understanding that the message has its leader already for the leader is the god of heaven the living god most high the holy spirit is here to lead and to guide the church the great pillar of fire is here to lead and to guide his church once again to the glory of god amen that his message i swept the world revival fires a burning everywhere name the country name the nation you see all the iron curtain uh of russia you say oh the bamboo curtain of china you say oh the purple curtain of rome i want to tell you right in rome i've preached into churches that believe the message of william branham of this seventh angel of revelation 10. amen there are multitudes of churches behind the iron curtain amen hallelujah all the brothers are doing great work there the message is spreading everywhere and behind the bamboo curtain oh my friends they're our brothers and our sisters in christ hallelujah holding to god's unchanging hand pressing on with the word of god they walk in a way of peace yet they're thought to be intruders they are thought to be contrary oh but we are the sons and daughters of the heavens amen we are sons and daughters of the living god that he has sent down here to live on this earth and to carry out his divine will plans and purposes for his glory and for his honor oh thank god amen yes brother sister when you have some time i want to urge you to read revelation chapter 20. amen and read there clearly sorry revelation 13 1 to 18 and you will read about the rise of the beast out of the sea revelation 18 you read of the burning of the false church revelation 20 you will find not only will she be literally burnt naturally here on the earth but in the great hereafter she will be burnt without the in the lake of fire revelation 21 verse 18 the bible reads clearly thus let me read that revelations 21 8 8 but the fearful and the unbelieving and the abominable and the murderers and the whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars amen shall have their part in the lake of fire which burn it with fire and brimstone which is the second death this is not just natural death but this is spiritual death the second death of extinction amen where that one will be birthed amen for hell we know is not eternal oh that's another subject hell is not eternal but there will be burnt to crisp in the lake of fire as the word of god has said oh blessed be the name read revelation 13 read and understand of this beast that rises from amongst the rest of the people the sea now looking at the power in this modern age through every age the power of the roman catholic church and how she has risen in her power through her magnificence of her organizational skills and abilities through the myriad uh minds of skillful men yes sir oh hallelujah but remember glorious wonderful admirable as she will appear outwardly my friends she is the representation of the false vine amen hallelujah and she does not take the name of the lord but she takes the way of satan oh praise god and we find out that her end will be completely identified with the beast and everything that he does for we see it in the bible how this woman is robbed in the scarlet or the clothing of royalty riding on what the beast she is empowered she's transported his carriage is supported by beast power of satan operating in her midst inspiring as he did with the serpent in the garden now he inspires multi-face and even gives every kind of thought word and act to be carried out yes sir our powers the power of the god of force amen the god of war satan yes sir and not of our god the prince of peace who is jesus christ amen here we see verse 17 the bible tells us how that church or the catholic church will soon very soon she will come come control all of the commerce of this earth this is not some conspiracy this is not some man-made teaching this is not some man spouting his own words it's in your bible read it in the word of god god has said it clearly that she will control after a while all the comers of the earth right now you may not recognize it but she is behind most if not many of the companies corporations major ones in the world today she's not there personally her money is there her influence is there she's on the board somewhere she's in the background somewhere her influence is everywhere amen they have a headship but their headship is not of god amen it's not of the lord i tell you my friends and so she gains control over the commerce of the earth revelation 18 9 to 17 the bible tells us that this church becomes involved with kings with merchants with princes with all these of the earth and control of the commerce comes about revelation 13 verse 14 we learn that the beast begins to spread his power and influence through that image of a church of the church that he has built he begins to spread out his influence right through there amen and that image is shaping and forming itself amen right into a world ecumenical counselor of world council of churches amen all the organizational uh churches going back to their harlot mother into a oneness and then they'll turn against all the rest of the faithful few and you are with us or you're against us you join us or we'll destroy you that will be their battle cry and then you will have to answer for that at that particular time all my friends just my friends i want to tell you communism which all may believe is dead will rise again it must rise again because god has spoken in his word that he will use the iron curtain of communism to destroy the purple curtain of rome it is spoken in the word of god hallelujah and it must come to pass amen yes sir god will raise them up for that purpose amen let me warn you don't you get that in the back of your head i am not a communist i don't believe in communism i have nothing to do with it but looking at the word of god you can see nothing else but communism spoken by the prophet of malachi 4 5 will rise again to destroy the harlot church the false church it will destroy her god raise them up oh russia king of the north god will use them hallelujah i believe russia itself will soon begin to experience a marvelous manifest revival that cannot be stopped by man governments forces human force because it will be a sweeping gale of the spirit of the living god sweeping through the land blessing those wonderful righteous brothers sisters christians some who are right now eating from jezebel's table in the denominational church because they know nothing better but here comes the word of god here comes the voice of god in these last days here comes the bride amen the manifestation of the living god and will call his children back to himself back to the word of the living god amen praise god praise god it's not communism rail is your enemy oh that's a strong man it will serve its purpose it's the public curtain of rome that you should be wary of and recognize there's danger back of that my friends revelation 13 1 to 4 compared with revelation 12 1-5 along with revelation 13 1 to 4 and i stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy amen oh revelation of the voice christ who is like unto the beast and who is able to go out and make war with him then revelation 12 1-5 and there appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars and she being with child cried travailing in birth and pain to be delivered and there appeared another wonder in the heaven and behold a great red dragon oh having seven heads ten horns seven crowns upon his heads and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered to devour her child as soon as it was born and she brought forth a man-child hallelujah who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up unto god and to his throne hallelujah amen so satan and his satanic religion are represented by these beasts that we have just read about for the first beast was wounded unto death but lived again and that represents imperial military rome that was destroyed and defeated and faded away but out of the death of militaristic and imperial rome rose people rome religious rome rose out of that in other words satan seeing his defeat under the militaristic way that he had changed his strategy and now begins to continues his war but now it goes from natural into a spiritual war against the saints of the most high god in the religious realm satan operating now in the religious realms with enticing spirits with doctrines of demons amen seducing spirits and the works of the devil here we are brother sister this is the day and this is the time when that beast that was wounded amen is raising its head again she lost her power from the invasion of the barbarians but now that was only temporal power but now she has regained her power in a different form under the pontificate under my friends in this day and in this hour amen yes sir a national a natural nation rising to power by crushing all the other nations round about it don't you see the spiritual significance you can look ahead in prophecy and you can clearly see it speaking of the religious uh aspects of rome how that will use the same strategy of divide and conquer and also destroy all the other nations denominations churches whatever oh that's against her and bring them to heal amen conquer every one of them like that because she'll develop one of the strongest and most powerful empire that there ever was seems like i sung as if i'm praising rome but i'm not i'm telling you what's in the bible that's supposed to happen that they're going to grow in power and they will have so much power ruling the commerce ruling over kings ruling over emperors ruling over countries nations and they will have supreme power in this present world because in this time the papal rome has already infiltrated the whole world and her power is getting to the place where it's soon it will become absolute oh the triple crowns the keys of dead hell and the grave signified a being used and abused and we see it friends the power is rising all around us everywhere and her uses of kings merchants and and and her deadly religious arsenal and her financial strength all coming together as great force and power and governing the entire earth like a goddess ruling on the face of this earth in this present age and the dragon is there behind her oh praise god hallelujah amen look at the book of daniel we find danielle the last part of the image that daniel saw was an image whose feet and toes went into iron and clay meaning that the roman empire would no longer be solid it would no longer be an iron empire but one mixed with humanism mixed with all manner of other things and there she begins with the running of world affairs in all the nations democratic despotic and otherwise because god is allowing mankind to use every form of human government and everyone will fail and fall to pieces until the prince of peace jesus christ comes again there will be no peace except when he the prince of peace comes and brings peace once more to the earth again the roman church churches in every nation and everything is all mixed up at this particular time again i may ask the question who is able to make war with the beast who is able to a war against them amen look in the bible look in the word of god there's some mighty nations right now but my friends rome is calling is actually she she's the one that's calling the tune she's telling them where to turn what to do she calls all the shots but right now she's standing behind the scenes not to cause any ripples or too much of trouble she's not ready to publicly uh reveal herself that she is the move of the shaker that she is the taker she's the one behind it all and the pope today and every day sits in the driver's seat oh my praise god look my friends his power i want to let you know the power of the pope will increase lots of people think it's going to go down but now doesn't make any difference one pope dies another one arises one pope dies another one arises and the power of the popes will increase that office will grow in power and in influence in every possible way verse six and he opened this mountain blasphemy amen why is it blasphemy because he's teaching for doctrines the commandments the litanies to all my friends the tenants of faith the various things of man not by god as timothy says they've become heady arrogant high-minded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god having outward forms of godliness but spiritually denying the genuine powers of god amen blaspheming the name of god changing his name and turning it into titles and getting the people to believe in the titles rather than in the direct name of the person who owns those titles amen and they refuse through the years to repent and to do it and it was given unto him says verse 7 to make war with the saints persecution is coming it may not be it may start right before the rapture we may see little uh elements of its shadows of it but persecution will ripen and break out upon the saints of god during the tribulation time death to the true believer and all that follow the lord in that order is how they are going to progress amen oh praise god even my friends we find no matter where you go that is what they will do verse 8 and all that dwell upon the earth whose names were not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world shall worship him god is saying he will be successful in his ambition of ruling the earth because all those whose names were not in the original election of god in the mind of god in the book of life in christ the logos the word all whose names were not written on that page white and fair will be deceived they will be fooled there will be seduced and carried away into babylon carried away into captivity amen but the elect will not be deceived they will not for their hear the shepherd's voice hallelujah and they follow him and him alone do they follow the word of god what have i been what have we been trying to show you here today that the seed of death which started from the garden naturally has started spiritually coming down out of babylon into nicaea with constantine into the realm of the romish uh pagan religion later at church and later now transformed itself into an angel of light into a christian church amen paganism has effectively invaded christianity and now operating in the christian ranks yes sir and so now we find that seed of death which started off as a seed as jesus spoke has now become a great tree in whose branches roosts all manner of unclean spirits all manner of wicked birds looking and sitting in the branches lodging there and in spite of her claims that she is the giver of life and she holds the keys to salvation inherit the fruits of death eat and die my friends but come to christ the bread of life and eat and drink and live forever more in him is life for we serve the living god amen over there you have the god of death the god of this evil age but we serve the true and the living god jesus christ hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever amen amen yes sir that mighty world church systems that fools the whole world that she is the way to salvation and in her doors is physical and spiritual salvation deceiving and destroying multitudes amen oh my friends but i want to tell you she is the personification of the spirit of death that walks and moves upon the face of the earth and that carrion of death by her religious lies amen the bible tells us will be put to death by death in other words she'll be put to death by the very dealings of organization that she deals with it's like a a dope dealer dying by the very dope that he's peddling the very lies he peddles destroys him and kills him defeats him and brings him to death and she will experience it all into the in the lake of fire amen all my friends men could not perceive that but there she is bride of satan or to bring it in a way that your natural mind will understand she is like a patchwork of denominations bride of frankenstein will be placed into the lake of fire but thanks be to god god has his own and she will they will come to an end but to those who are god's children and god's true elect though you may be in her midst god has said come out of her my people and be not partakers of her evil deeds or sins her plagues the things that she is doing do not be identified with her but come out of her there is still time come while there is still time for there is room at the cross for you there is room in the kingdom of heaven for you there is a place in the word of god for you come to him while there is still time to come as you hear the final voice of this final age come to jesus now come to the word making itself known to you now and say thank you lord save me jesus take me lord open up your word give me full understanding i may not know much but dear lord forgive heavenly father hear the cries of your children everywhere around the world save heal deliver break the chains of the fear of denomination break the chains of these spirits of doubt unbelief deceit lies these charming devils of religious seduction set your children free father give them enough time to come and receive your word and experience god's power of transformation for we ask it in the name of jesus christ to the glory of god our heavenly father amen and amen god bless you friends [Music] you
