[31:03] trusting in the Lord
[31:05] that's what we're doing here tonight
[31:06] amen we're trusting in the Lord we're
[31:09] trusting that the Lord is going to give
[31:11] us something that is going to encourage
[31:13] us
[31:14] and to give us the strength to keep
[31:16] pressing on
[31:17] to keep believing the word of God this
[31:20] is uh one of the greatest most
[31:23] amazing ages that's ever been
[31:27] experienced for the Sons and Daughters
[31:29] of God brother Branham talked about it
[31:32] thought that he was actually living in
[31:34] it at the time
[31:35] but boy if he you know I'm sure he's
[31:38] looking over the portal of time and and
[31:40] seeing what it is that's really taking
[31:42] place here now and how much has
[31:46] transpired
[31:47] since he left the scene
[31:50] you know
[31:52] as it was in the days of Sodom back in
[31:54] brother branham's day and you look at
[31:56] the condition today
[31:58] and you wonder wow it's becoming so
[32:03] common to the people it's just becoming
[32:05] very normal to be living in a world that
[32:09] is in my opinion and in most of the sons
[32:13] and daughters thoughts and hearts
[32:16] doesn't even make sense absolutely
[32:19] ridiculous that they've taken the word
[32:21] of God and placed it into such chaos
[32:24] amen praise God but we also know that
[32:27] that is
[32:29] the scripture
[32:30] that is the prophecy that is the time in
[32:33] the season that we're supposed to be
[32:35] living in amen praise God
[32:38] so God bless you we're here it's Tuesday
[32:40] night
[32:42] Bible study gives us an opportunity to
[32:46] allow the Holy Spirit to just
[32:48] unveil
[32:50] through the word of God things that are
[32:53] Upon Our Hearts to know the hour that
[32:56] we're living in and the season that
[32:57] we're living in amen and so we're going
[33:01] to be looking
[33:02] I'm starting a new series here
[33:05] that the Lord laid upon my heart
[33:11] on rapturing faith
[33:13] amen
[33:14] and so tonight
[33:16] we're just gonna sort of give the
[33:18] introduction to it and we're going to
[33:20] look at it and we know that rapturing
[33:23] faith is something that
[33:25] um you know we often think about we
[33:28] often wonder about the Rapture brother
[33:30] Branham said that the Rapture was a
[33:32] revelation and we know that Revelation
[33:34] is faith and we know that we're going to
[33:36] need some pretty
[33:38] Supernatural faith in order to change
[33:40] these bodies but yet if you just look at
[33:44] your own life
[33:45] and look at when God started with you
[33:48] you will see
[33:50] that there's a great change that's
[33:52] already started amen and that's all part
[33:56] of the revelation of the Rapture amen so
[34:00] let's read our scripture
[34:02] it's from Romans chapter 1 verses 16 and
[34:07] 17.
[34:09] amen let us pray before we go to the
[34:11] word father
[34:12] we just so appreciate this opportunity
[34:15] Lord to read your word
[34:18] and to invite you great Jehovah to come
[34:22] and Minister and discern and meet the
[34:26] needs of your children Lord through your
[34:28] word
[34:30] you bring Faith
[34:31] Faith cometh by hearing your word Lord
[34:35] and this is how you do it and so we're
[34:38] here ready for service Lord use the
[34:41] vessel
[34:42] speak
[34:43] every need in our midst tonight Lord
[34:46] anoint the hearts of your children to
[34:49] receive
[34:50] Lord me we just move so into Heavenly
[34:54] places now Lord may your great spirit
[34:57] come Lord and just Lift Every uh
[35:01] unbelief father Lift Every burden every
[35:03] concern of your people Lord many
[35:06] cares of this life father dealing with
[35:09] sickness dealing with uh Financial
[35:12] issues dealing with family problems Lord
[35:16] relationships all the things that that
[35:18] this life Lord seems to bombard upon the
[35:22] people Lord but tonight Lord just bring
[35:25] us into that Pavilion tonight Lord into
[35:27] that into your secret place father where
[35:30] all things are possible Lord where we
[35:32] can just receive that small portion that
[35:35] you have for each and every one of us
[35:36] tonight granted we pray bless our pastor
[35:39] bless the Saints bless them online
[35:42] father may your spirit move father
[35:45] discern every heart Lord You're The Same
[35:48] Spirit Lord you can move through there's
[35:51] no time there's no space there's no
[35:54] distance for you take control we pray in
[35:57] Jesus name amen
[35:59] praise God for I am not ashamed of the
[36:03] gospel of Christ
[36:05] for it is the power of God unto
[36:08] salvation to everyone that believeth
[36:11] to the Jew first and also to the Greek
[36:15] for therein is the righteousness of God
[36:18] revealed from faith to Faith
[36:22] as it is written the just shall live by
[36:26] faith
[36:27] now I want to read the Amplified version
[36:29] here
[36:30] I am not ashamed of the Gospel
[36:33] for it is the power of God
[36:36] for salvation
[36:38] for his wrath and Punishment
[36:42] to everyone who believes in Christ Our
[36:46] Savior
[36:47] as Savior to the Jew first and also to
[36:51] the Greek for in the gospel the
[36:54] righteousness of God is revealed both
[36:57] springing from faith and leading to
[37:01] Faith
[37:02] disclosed in a way that awakens more
[37:05] faith
[37:06] as it is written and forever remains
[37:09] written the just and upright shall live
[37:14] by faith you may be seated
[37:17] amen praise God
[37:19] our next scripture
[37:21] is from The Book of Psalms 27 5.
[37:26] for in the time of trouble he shall hide
[37:28] me in his Pavilion in the secret of his
[37:32] Tabernacle shall he hide me He Shall Set
[37:35] me
[37:36] upon a rock
[37:39] Alleluia glory to God Amen
[37:42] so when we look at this scripture we're
[37:44] talking about rapturing faith
[37:47] and tonight we just want to start by
[37:49] looking at you know the aspects of faith
[37:53] and how it is that you know that that we
[37:55] first started I want you to know that
[37:58] from the day that you received God which
[38:02] is the message for your day the word of
[38:06] God for your day when when that happened
[38:08] there was an a portion of faith that was
[38:12] placed inside of you right there and
[38:14] then and that portion of faith
[38:17] was rapturing faith
[38:20] you might think oh well it was just you
[38:22] know God interceding in my life you know
[38:25] I was in a life of sin and I was you
[38:28] know not living right and and you know I
[38:31] needed God I was you know my marriage
[38:34] was falling apart my my my my job
[38:37] situation was terrible and I needed
[38:40] somebody to come and save me out of it
[38:43] you know because a lot of people that's
[38:44] the kind of interpretation that they put
[38:47] on your experience sometimes
[38:49] you know they want to say oh well yeah
[38:51] you know Danny you know I remember when
[38:53] when the Lord came into my life you know
[38:55] 30 almost 30 years ago and a lot of
[38:58] people said oh Danny's just you know
[38:59] going through something you know again
[39:01] you know like he's he's a pretty you
[39:04] know emotional kind of guy he can he can
[39:06] get pretty uh you know excited about
[39:08] things and we've seen him get excited
[39:11] about you know network marketing at
[39:13] times and we've seen him get excited
[39:15] about this opportunity and that
[39:17] opportunity and this is just another
[39:19] opportunity that Danny is involved with
[39:21] and you know you can put yourself there
[39:24] right and and just look at your own
[39:26] experience but that's not what it was
[39:30] it was because we were the seed of God
[39:35] elected to receive the word in this day
[39:40] you see
[39:43] when you look at the history of
[39:45] Christianity
[39:46] you will look back and all you've got to
[39:49] do is you know go back and look at the
[39:51] life of Jesus Christ
[39:53] and then look at those that were chosen
[39:56] around him
[39:59] these were simple regular individuals if
[40:04] Peter was a fisherman you know uh Mary
[40:08] Magdalene her life was just a complete
[40:11] mess okay she was so demon possessed
[40:15] from bad experiences and being abused
[40:18] and everything else you look at the
[40:20] lives you look at Matthew the tax
[40:22] collector you look at all of you know
[40:25] those that that were called in the time
[40:27] when Jesus was here on the earth and
[40:30] they were just ordinary people
[40:34] but you see something
[40:37] struck their heart
[40:39] that changed their lives
[40:42] I can see them you know when Jesus first
[40:45] you know walked up to them and
[40:48] introduced himself to them here was God
[40:51] the Living God the word made flesh and
[40:55] he's coming up to simple people but yet
[40:58] they were not just anybody
[41:02] they were elected and chosen and he knew
[41:06] them from before the foundations of the
[41:08] world
[41:10] just like he knew you
[41:12] he knew that you would be living in this
[41:15] age he knew that you would be the ones
[41:17] that would receive the word of God in
[41:19] your day and in your season and he knew
[41:22] that when he would come to you you would
[41:26] need him
[41:28] he knew you would need him
[41:30] he knew that that there was going to
[41:32] have to be something greater than just
[41:35] normal Faith because remember
[41:37] these individuals a lot of them were
[41:39] Jews they were living by the law they
[41:41] they were brought up according to the
[41:43] law but yet they were having experiences
[41:46] in life and going through situations and
[41:49] and things that that anybody can go
[41:52] through they were discouraged they would
[41:55] look at Mary Magdalene she wanted to
[41:57] probably kill herself over and over
[41:59] again
[42:00] but yet God knew that he had to go and
[42:04] call her look at the woman at the well
[42:06] her life was a complete disaster but God
[42:10] knew that it was time for him to go and
[42:13] call her and he also knew that it was
[42:15] going to take more than a rabbi
[42:18] more than some traditional teaching you
[42:22] needed more than just you know being
[42:24] being an altar boy at the Catholic
[42:27] church or or or being you know in the
[42:29] choir at your church and you know being
[42:32] brought into the church because your
[42:34] parents brought you into the church you
[42:37] need more than that you need it more
[42:39] than that to serve God in the capacity
[42:42] that you are serving him right now
[42:45] Jesus knew when he was coming into our
[42:49] lives that it wasn't just going to be
[42:51] ordinary faith that we were going to
[42:53] require in this day
[42:55] back in that day when Jesus came to the
[42:58] Earth the kind of faith that they were
[43:01] going to require was Faith to overcome
[43:05] the the the the humiliation of being a
[43:10] dozen people that were actually
[43:12] following the Messiah that would
[43:15] actually be the ones that were going to
[43:17] actually spearhead the Christian church
[43:21] he said to Peter one day when Peter was
[43:24] at his you know like if you get a chance
[43:26] you know we've been watching a series
[43:28] and it's available you can actually
[43:30] watch it now on Netflix it's called The
[43:33] Chosen
[43:34] and if you get a chance you might just
[43:37] want to watch you know
[43:39] season one I think that once you watch
[43:41] season one you'll probably want to
[43:43] continue to watch it but it's all about
[43:45] you know simple people at the time when
[43:49] Jesus came to the you know came to them
[43:51] in their lives and it's it's looking at
[43:53] their lives
[43:55] just like we're talking about your life
[43:58] here tonight
[43:59] you were just an ordinary person
[44:02] and yet these individuals were chosen of
[44:05] God
[44:06] and and they were the ones that he chose
[44:09] in that time and they were to go and
[44:12] spearhead the Christian Church they you
[44:15] know Peter like I was saying Peter was
[44:17] got into such a condition
[44:19] you know that he was so discouraged he
[44:22] thought his life was finished he owed so
[44:25] much money to the tax he was you know he
[44:28] was discouraged he couldn't you know
[44:30] provide for his family for his life
[44:33] financially things were just you know
[44:35] going really bad and and so here now
[44:38] Christ comes along gives him a boatload
[44:40] of fish allows him to you know to to
[44:43] move forward and now he says you're not
[44:46] you're no longer going to be a Fisher a
[44:49] fish you're going to be a fisher of men
[44:52] so he was going to need some sort of a
[44:56] faith in order to spearhead and be the
[44:59] first ones that would actually go out
[45:02] and bring Christ to the people
[45:05] that was a special kind of faith that
[45:08] was the faith that they needed in that
[45:10] day
[45:10] and then we can look and and we can come
[45:13] right up to you know where Luther broke
[45:15] away from the Catholic Church
[45:17] you know uh he needed a certain level of
[45:20] faith
[45:22] he's the one that actually caught that
[45:25] first you know understanding of the
[45:28] revelation of faith that it was
[45:30] something that you had to have yourself
[45:33] this is a personal experience
[45:36] and so he required a certain amount of
[45:38] Faith now to actually
[45:41] protest against the Catholic Church
[45:44] the most powerful religious organization
[45:48] on the earth in that day
[45:51] he needed a certain portion of faith
[45:55] he needed a faith to to deal with with
[45:59] great hierarchies and everything else
[46:01] but yet God gave them that Faith because
[46:04] God was now breaking away and bringing
[46:09] us to this day because it went from
[46:12] Luther then to Wesley Wesley had to
[46:15] receive a certain level of faith
[46:17] we're laying in a foundation here so
[46:20] that we can understand how important it
[46:22] is to understand the kind of faith that
[46:25] we are receiving
[46:28] and so here Wesley now receives faith
[46:31] to sanctify his life
[46:34] and then the Pentecostals receive faith
[46:37] in order to receive the gifts
[46:40] in order to allow the Holy Spirit to now
[46:44] start to manifest in a supernatural way
[46:47] in and through the people
[46:50] they required a certain level of faith
[46:53] in order to do that
[46:54] and then Here Comes brother Branham
[46:56] brother Branham a 20th century Prophet
[46:59] the one who God chose now to to actually
[47:04] change the dispensation
[47:06] to call out a people from all of the uh
[47:10] of the mess of of organized religion all
[47:15] over the world
[47:16] and you can see and we've experienced
[47:18] the kind of faith that God had to give
[47:21] brother Branham it was Supernatural
[47:23] faith it was signs and wonders like like
[47:26] the like the Earth had never seen before
[47:31] that was an amazing Faith because God
[47:34] had put upon his life such a call but he
[47:39] had the faith God gave him the faith he
[47:42] accomplished his goal he did what it was
[47:45] that was required of him in order to
[47:49] fulfill the word and to bring God's Plan
[47:52] of Redemption
[47:54] because this is what we are fulfilling
[47:57] the Plan of Redemption
[48:00] and so now when we're looking at the at
[48:04] the scripture here and we're seeing that
[48:07] that faith
[48:09] upon faith
[48:11] upon faith that God is increasing the
[48:15] the the the the the the portion of faith
[48:18] and the kind of faith that you received
[48:21] when this message came to you ten years
[48:24] ago 20 years ago it was actually
[48:27] rapturing faith that was coming to you
[48:29] because this is the age of the rapture
[48:34] it's not ordinary faith that you're
[48:37] actually receiving
[48:38] listen to brother Branham here
[48:41] now this quote really struck me
[48:45] and and
[48:46] I'm going to read it to you now tomorrow
[48:48] this is from Jehovah Jireh 1964. he says
[48:52] now tomorrow tomorrow at two o'clock
[48:55] tomorrow the entire service tomorrow
[48:58] afternoon is given over to the sick for
[49:01] prayer for the sick
[49:03] now many people refer to it as a healing
[49:07] service
[49:08] well we don't exactly like to refer to
[49:11] it like that
[49:13] because let's call it a faith service
[49:17] now you got to remember the time that
[49:20] brother Branham was living in and the
[49:22] word that was coming to brother Branham
[49:23] and what it was that his calling and his
[49:26] ministry was all about
[49:29] let's call it a faith so if our faith
[49:32] can come to that spot after him
[49:35] identified Among Us
[49:38] and know everything that's in our heart
[49:42] and has proved it to us see that he is
[49:46] alive and confirmed it by the scripture
[49:51] he's explaining to the people the kind
[49:53] of faith
[49:55] and he says here did you notice how he
[49:58] backed up Every Word by his living
[50:01] presence
[50:03] now if God is going to do something in
[50:06] your life that's going to give you
[50:08] rapturing faith
[50:10] it's going to need to be his living
[50:12] presence
[50:15] he's going to have to come to you
[50:17] personally
[50:19] a living presence of God in your life
[50:22] to transform you and to change you and
[50:26] to translate you from this Dimension
[50:29] into the other but not so much even that
[50:32] that's going to be amazing but you're
[50:34] going to need Faith to get to that
[50:37] you're going to need the kind of Faith
[50:39] to overcome the age that you're living
[50:42] in so that you can produce that portion
[50:45] of the word listen
[50:47] he says by his living present
[50:49] congregation says amen
[50:52] see see now that shows that you don't
[50:56] have to just think we're just trying to
[50:59] say something that's some kind of
[51:01] mystical something I'm not just speaking
[51:04] something mystical here
[51:06] I'm not here tonight as a minister to
[51:08] just you know speak things uh that you
[51:11] know just repeat what's said in the word
[51:13] repeat the prophet and tell you what the
[51:16] prophet said
[51:17] you need to put on your spiritual
[51:19] thinking here and recognize what it is
[51:22] that the holy spirit is actually
[51:24] revealing to us as individuals Sons and
[51:28] Daughters of God that are going to need
[51:30] rapturing Faith to change these bodies
[51:33] but you need to wreck you need to be
[51:35] aware we're going to be looking at
[51:37] certain things you're going to need to
[51:39] be aware of what it's going to take
[51:42] so that it places you under the right
[51:44] expectation
[51:46] he says here not some mystical something
[51:50] what this Bible has promised that's the
[51:53] truth
[51:54] see now every word is true
[51:58] now I may not have faith enough to make
[52:02] every word of it Act
[52:05] but I certainly wouldn't stand in the
[52:07] way of anybody that did have that faith
[52:11] you see he's he's coming on the scene in
[52:14] this day and in this hour
[52:16] he's making himself personally known to
[52:19] you as an individual you receive that
[52:22] Faith you're going to have to act upon
[52:25] that faith
[52:26] you're gonna have to say Amen to that
[52:29] faith when it comes into your life
[52:31] amen eat listen here Enoch had faith
[52:35] enough one day to take an afternoon
[52:37] stroll with God and just kept on walking
[52:42] God
[52:44] walked with Enoch
[52:47] Enoch knew that God was with him
[52:52] Noah was watching Enoch
[52:56] no one knew that Enoch was walking with
[52:59] God
[53:01] no one knew that something Supernatural
[53:06] Enoch knew the experience that he was
[53:09] having as an individual it wasn't
[53:11] something that he just belonged to a
[53:14] church
[53:15] a lot of people just come to church
[53:18] they just go to church on Wednesday they
[53:20] go to church on Sunday and they figure
[53:22] that's enough
[53:24] it's not
[53:25] this is a personal Supernatural walk
[53:28] with God
[53:29] so brother Branham is trying to bring
[53:31] the people to a level of understanding
[53:34] in preparation for a faith healing
[53:38] meeting the next day and he doesn't want
[53:40] to call it that he wants to call it
[53:42] faith
[53:43] he wants the people to enter into a
[53:46] level of Faith where they can receive
[53:49] the actual material change in their body
[53:52] if it's a healing that's needed
[53:54] you have that same access in this Dane
[53:57] in this hour
[53:58] by rapturing faith
[54:02] you do not have ordinary faith when you
[54:05] talk about faith from this day on I want
[54:08] you to think rapturing faith
[54:11] God has given me rapturing Faith to
[54:14] overcome my financial problems
[54:16] it's not normal faith
[54:20] It's Supernatural faith
[54:23] so and he kept on walking went up home
[54:26] without dying now I think the church has
[54:31] got to come to that to a rapturing faith
[54:35] he says I may not have that Faith just
[54:39] now but I sure wouldn't stand in the way
[54:42] of somebody that did have that faith
[54:47] I'm telling you Saints there's a people
[54:50] on Earth right now that have that kind
[54:53] of faith
[54:55] it's being revealed to them
[54:58] it's being unveiled to them
[55:00] and so
[55:02] this kind of faith is is is what I'm
[55:06] talking about here tonight
[55:08] this is the study that we're going to be
[55:10] looking at and that we're going to be
[55:12] moving into over these next few sessions
[55:15] as the Lord would provide amen and then
[55:19] we look at the scripture of Psalms 27 5.
[55:24] and it says for in the time of trouble
[55:27] he shall hide me in his Pavilion brother
[55:30] Branham used this scripture when he
[55:32] preached the rapture
[55:34] and I want you to notice in the secret
[55:37] of his Tabernacle
[55:39] he's talking about the body of Christ
[55:42] he's talking about us being sealed in
[55:46] that there is a people in this hour that
[55:49] are being sealed in
[55:50] for the rapture
[55:52] they're being sealed into a supernatural
[55:56] body which is called the body of Christ
[55:59] it's not a church
[56:02] it's more than a church
[56:04] everybody goes to church everybody says
[56:07] I belong to a church we don't belong to
[56:09] a church
[56:11] we belong to a natural church but that
[56:14] natural church is the same as all the
[56:16] other natural churches out there
[56:19] but what differentiates us is the fact
[56:21] that we belong to the body of Christ
[56:24] it's a supernatural body that is now
[56:26] being prepared for a rapture
[56:30] remember everything that we read
[56:33] everything that we preach everything
[56:37] that we feed on is feeding the faith to
[56:41] bring us to the Rapture and to fulfill
[56:44] that final stage of the Rapture which is
[56:47] going to happen in the moment in the
[56:49] twinkling of an eye
[56:50] but it's all happening now rapturing
[56:54] Faith is already in you
[56:57] it's already listen he said he's going
[57:00] to come like a thief in the night
[57:02] he's already come
[57:04] like a thief in the night and he's
[57:06] stolen you out of the world
[57:08] he's already pulled you out of your
[57:10] conditions
[57:12] he's already delivered you from from
[57:14] from certain aspects of the world they
[57:16] had a hold of you they had control over
[57:18] your life
[57:19] but he came like a thief one night and
[57:22] he stole you he says I'll take one I'll
[57:24] leave the other
[57:25] Hallelujah you're you're you're you're
[57:27] you're you're one of the blessed that
[57:29] have been taken and placed into that
[57:31] Pavilion that secret place that
[57:34] Tabernacle where he's he's hid you
[57:36] you're you're already hidden in Christ
[57:39] you're already Justified there's nothing
[57:41] that you need to do in order to to
[57:43] fulfill the Rapture of the church the
[57:46] only thing you need to do is believe the
[57:48] word act upon the word speak the word
[57:51] speak the promises of God when the Devil
[57:54] comes in like a flood God will raise a
[57:57] standard and all you've got to do is say
[57:59] amen and and repeat the promises of God
[58:02] repeat what he said he would do for you
[58:07] he's hidden you in that secret place
[58:10] and he shall set you upon a what
[58:13] a rock
[58:16] oh let me tell you this is not some
[58:20] ordinary Rock
[58:22] this is rapturing revelation Rock
[58:25] this is a rock that's going to withstand
[58:28] Every Storm
[58:30] it's the kind of rock that whatever
[58:32] situation you think is going to try and
[58:34] take you you might think tonight oh I
[58:36] got to deal with this situation it's tax
[58:39] time I probably owe money to the
[58:41] government how am I going to deal with
[58:42] that I couldn't even get together enough
[58:44] to you know to to to pay my rent but
[58:47] thank God I paid my tithes
[58:50] oh Hallelujah praise God that's the
[58:53] first place you want to make sure you
[58:55] want to make sure that your investment
[58:57] into the kingdom of God is first
[59:00] everything else don't worry about it
[59:03] because you're standing on a rock
[59:05] you're standing on a Rapture Revelation
[59:08] Rock you're standing on rapturing faith
[59:11] Rock tonight you're not on just some
[59:13] some ordinary Rock
[59:15] oh I got faith it takes more than just
[59:19] the kind of faith that people quote
[59:21] unquote say I got faith
[59:23] no no you need rapturing faith in this
[59:25] hour
[59:26] that's the kind of Faith that's going to
[59:28] change you and give you the overcoming
[59:31] power to get through this age and so
[59:35] go to the next slide so our thought here
[59:38] tonight
[59:39] and this is only the introduction of
[59:42] course is we're going to be looking at
[59:44] the maturity in the bride
[59:47] you see you got to come to a place where
[59:49] you mature in your faith
[59:52] you know we talk about it all the time
[59:54] we read about it all the time but God
[59:56] wants us to be conscious
[59:58] God wants us to be conscious as adults
[1:00:01] we're not children anymore we're not
[1:00:03] feeding on just milk
[1:00:05] you know a lot of people they they get
[1:00:07] satisfied with just milk alone
[1:00:09] they get satisfied with just going to
[1:00:11] church you know maybe once every couple
[1:00:13] weeks or once you know uh you know no no
[1:00:16] you got to be feeding on the word of God
[1:00:19] all day long
[1:00:21] what do you mean brother Danny I you
[1:00:23] know I gotta go to work
[1:00:26] while you're at work
[1:00:28] you can feed on God's word
[1:00:33] David said you know I'll meditate on the
[1:00:36] Lord
[1:00:37] all day long
[1:00:40] you can meditate on God's promises all
[1:00:43] day long now I'm not talking about where
[1:00:45] you're where you're a fanatic
[1:00:48] but while you're working if you've got a
[1:00:50] job that requires a lot of physical
[1:00:53] strength
[1:00:54] then you need to think about
[1:00:57] God
[1:00:58] coming to his uh children
[1:01:02] that he where he says in your in your
[1:01:05] weakest moments I'm your strength
[1:01:08] I am your strength you need to think
[1:01:10] about when God anointed David who was
[1:01:14] just a just a a small runt
[1:01:18] you know that that he wasn't anything
[1:01:20] you know like like a great warrior he
[1:01:23] wasn't a great fighter he became one
[1:01:25] because of God's anointing in his life
[1:01:29] but when he had to go and face Goliath
[1:01:31] which was a giant in the land something
[1:01:34] came over him
[1:01:36] you know what it was
[1:01:39] it was faith
[1:01:41] it was the faith that God gave him that
[1:01:44] when a lion came in and tried to steal
[1:01:46] one of his sheep
[1:01:48] Supernatural strength came into his life
[1:01:51] that gave him the ability to just to to
[1:01:54] defeat that lion destroy the lion
[1:01:57] and get back his sheep
[1:02:00] and one day a bear came in and all those
[1:02:02] thoughts started to pour into David
[1:02:05] those were not just ordinary thoughts
[1:02:08] that was Supernatural faith
[1:02:11] God has given you that same kind of
[1:02:13] Faith so while you're at work if you
[1:02:16] require strength to overcome these
[1:02:18] Giants then you just have to say Lord
[1:02:20] you gave that kind of Faith to David
[1:02:22] you're the same yesterday today and
[1:02:24] forever I've got I've got a double
[1:02:27] portion of that now
[1:02:29] you're you've made available rapturing
[1:02:31] Faith David didn't didn't require his
[1:02:34] body to be changed in the moment in the
[1:02:36] twinkling of an eye to be translated
[1:02:38] from this Dimension to the other because
[1:02:41] David was not facing the Great
[1:02:43] Tribulation that we that this Earth is
[1:02:47] going to face not us
[1:02:49] we go in the rapture
[1:02:52] that's why the message for this day is
[1:02:55] all around the rapture
[1:02:58] and so that's why rapturing faith is
[1:03:01] what he's giving us over and over again
[1:03:03] and so when you're so when now from from
[1:03:06] this day when you're thinking about
[1:03:10] the situations that you're facing I want
[1:03:13] you to know that you've been placed on
[1:03:14] on a supernatural Rock
[1:03:17] and the maturity level needs to increase
[1:03:20] now you need to start to get more
[1:03:23] serious with what you believe
[1:03:26] to become more consecrated unto the Lord
[1:03:29] on what he's revealed to you
[1:03:32] to to start moving in the Realms where
[1:03:35] God is looking for a mature
[1:03:37] woman
[1:03:40] a mature wife
[1:03:43] you know when a woman first starts out
[1:03:45] as a young woman she's Giddy and she has
[1:03:49] a lot of fun and she's thinking about
[1:03:51] this and thinking about the wedding and
[1:03:53] thinking about all the fun and all the
[1:03:55] traveling and you know all the good
[1:03:57] times that that that that you know that
[1:03:59] she's going to be approaching as she as
[1:04:02] she goes to that wedding uh supper
[1:04:04] thinking about the honeymoon and oh that
[1:04:07] that's all that's con the clothes that
[1:04:09] she's gonna wear how she's gonna pretty
[1:04:11] herself up make herself look better than
[1:04:13] all the other women and make sure that
[1:04:15] her husband notices her and and
[1:04:17] constantly you know uh having those
[1:04:20] thoughts but then she gets married then
[1:04:23] she becomes a wife then the husband has
[1:04:26] to go to work every day then the husband
[1:04:28] has to provide and the wife is there to
[1:04:31] support him to be his help mate to
[1:04:35] actually maybe take a job and work with
[1:04:38] him because now they're starting to
[1:04:40] build you know a future because now
[1:04:42] children are on the horizon they're
[1:04:45] thinking about children
[1:04:46] they start to mature
[1:04:48] you can watch that woman go through a
[1:04:51] complete change where she starts to take
[1:04:54] notice and she becomes much more mature
[1:04:57] in her attitude
[1:04:59] her attitude towards situations towards
[1:05:03] her husband
[1:05:04] things get serious sometimes
[1:05:06] Trials come from time to time and we
[1:05:10] have to overcome those trials
[1:05:13] and if we're not together with the
[1:05:15] husband and the wife if we're not if
[1:05:17] we're not you know pleasing to one
[1:05:20] another supporting one another feeding
[1:05:23] one another
[1:05:24] you you got to feed the holy spirit with
[1:05:27] your prayers and your and your and your
[1:05:29] praise and your and your desire to serve
[1:05:32] him
[1:05:33] as you walk with him and as you live
[1:05:36] that kind of a life it creates a a
[1:05:38] different kind of relationship between
[1:05:41] you and your husband because he's coming
[1:05:44] for a bride he's he's coming for a wife
[1:05:46] he's coming to manifest that that she is
[1:05:50] going to be an actual expression of him
[1:05:52] nothing pleases a husband more than when
[1:05:55] his wife
[1:05:57] is expressing
[1:06:00] his qualities
[1:06:04] good qualities
[1:06:09] the kind of character that pleases a
[1:06:13] husband when he sees his wife
[1:06:15] having you know a calm controlled
[1:06:19] attitude and nature
[1:06:23] God is looking for maturity
[1:06:26] not somebody that's just going to look
[1:06:28] at everybody else and and listen to
[1:06:30] everybody else's opinions
[1:06:32] a wife should not be listening to
[1:06:34] everybody else's opinions
[1:06:36] if you're a wife that's married to a
[1:06:39] holy ghost-filled Son of God then he is
[1:06:42] the priest and he is your lord
[1:06:45] he is Christ in your house
[1:06:48] he's the one that God has chosen to
[1:06:51] speak your needs and to speak the family
[1:06:54] needs and to and to provide and and
[1:06:57] nothing should you know like nothing
[1:07:00] should should come between that when a
[1:07:02] husband and wife have a a real you know
[1:07:06] conscious pure revelation of God in
[1:07:08] their lives
[1:07:10] because it's not man that we are that
[1:07:12] that we are responsible to it's God that
[1:07:15] we are responsible to
[1:07:18] and when a woman understands that and a
[1:07:20] man understands that then a man is going
[1:07:22] to treat his wife
[1:07:24] the same way that Christ loves and
[1:07:26] treats the church
[1:07:28] a husband should never be putting down
[1:07:30] his wife never
[1:07:33] a husband should always be encouraging
[1:07:36] and and lifting them up and and and if
[1:07:38] they have weaknesses they should be they
[1:07:41] they should be turned into something
[1:07:43] like like like reversed into strength
[1:07:46] you know encourage and and and and lift
[1:07:49] up and and that's what he's doing for us
[1:07:54] he's encouraging us he's not here to
[1:07:57] beat us up
[1:07:59] this is not that listen
[1:08:01] just before a man is going to take his
[1:08:03] wife to the Altar and marry her he's not
[1:08:07] gonna he's not gonna treat her like
[1:08:09] garbage
[1:08:12] he's looking to treat her like the most
[1:08:14] important most special person in the
[1:08:17] world
[1:08:18] and that's the kind of relationship that
[1:08:21] Christ wants to enter into through this
[1:08:24] age that we're living in right now he
[1:08:26] wants that kind of a relationship with
[1:08:29] us
[1:08:31] and it's going to require that we
[1:08:33] understand what's required of us and to
[1:08:36] be mature
[1:08:37] mature
[1:08:40] Sons and Daughters of God
[1:08:45] brother Branham
[1:08:47] now as we enter into this
[1:08:51] we want to look at
[1:08:52] the five musts
[1:08:55] and we want to understand it
[1:08:58] as we as we look through it brother
[1:09:00] Branham you can bring up the next slide
[1:09:04] it's from the message trying to do God a
[1:09:06] service without being the will of God
[1:09:13] and one of the things that we must
[1:09:15] understand
[1:09:16] if we're to be mature
[1:09:19] Sons and Daughters of God in this day
[1:09:21] and in this hour we need to understand
[1:09:23] what God is expecting from us
[1:09:27] we need to understand these things so
[1:09:29] let's look at the first one
[1:09:32] brother Brown speaking here he says but
[1:09:34] these five musts I want you to remember
[1:09:37] these
[1:09:38] no matter how sincere A man may be in
[1:09:42] doing it
[1:09:43] and be in doing it doing God a service
[1:09:48] these this these five must be there
[1:09:55] pay attention
[1:09:57] first
[1:09:58] it must be his time to do it
[1:10:02] now you see how important it is to
[1:10:05] recognize your day and its message
[1:10:08] you need to know what God is doing in
[1:10:12] this day
[1:10:15] God is not trying to
[1:10:18] preach only sanctification
[1:10:22] or preach only
[1:10:24] gifts if you don't got gifts and if
[1:10:27] gifts are not showing up in your life
[1:10:29] then the holy spirit is not upon your
[1:10:31] life
[1:10:32] you need to recognize
[1:10:35] that
[1:10:37] it's his time to do what
[1:10:42] what is it that he's going to achieve in
[1:10:44] this day for you and me
[1:10:47] the rapture
[1:10:51] let's get focused
[1:10:53] this is the rapture age
[1:10:56] this is the time
[1:10:58] listen there's there's another Thousand
[1:11:01] Years
[1:11:02] after the Rapture by the way
[1:11:04] hello
[1:11:06] okay
[1:11:08] time shall be no more for you as a son
[1:11:12] and daughter of God because this Rapture
[1:11:16] puts you into your theophany
[1:11:20] you need to know
[1:11:23] his time to do it it's his time to do
[1:11:26] and to change and to take this bride out
[1:11:30] of this dimension
[1:11:33] what if Moses would come say well we'll
[1:11:36] build an ark and float up the Nile like
[1:11:39] Noah did Noah's time was all right for
[1:11:42] for an ark but not his time
[1:11:46] it's not the time for Noah it's not the
[1:11:50] time for there's going to be great
[1:11:52] floods and there's going to be a Great
[1:11:54] Tribulation that's going to strike the
[1:11:56] Earth and this Earth is going to be in
[1:11:58] total chaos but you need to understand
[1:12:00] where your part is in all of that
[1:12:03] you don't go into that chaos
[1:12:07] you do not go into the tribulation
[1:12:10] you are receiving rapturing faith for a
[1:12:14] body change in order to be translated
[1:12:16] from this dimension
[1:12:18] to the dimension of the redeemed
[1:12:21] let's continue
[1:12:26] what if Jesus would come
[1:12:28] said now I'll tell you what will do
[1:12:32] we'll just go up on the mount like Moses
[1:12:34] did and get a new Declaration of laws
[1:12:38] see ah
[1:12:40] he was that law see
[1:12:43] it's not the time to be hammering the
[1:12:46] people with the law a lot of people when
[1:12:49] they preach you know you know you go
[1:12:52] into different churches and it's just
[1:12:53] law this and you got to do this and you
[1:12:56] gotta wear your skirts long they got to
[1:12:58] be measured you know you make sure the
[1:13:00] deacons you know okay in your length of
[1:13:03] the skirt and you know all these laws
[1:13:05] and you can't do this and you can't do
[1:13:07] that this is not the age for that
[1:13:11] this is the rapture age
[1:13:17] you must be in his time
[1:13:23] in his time he says in his time he makes
[1:13:26] all things beautiful
[1:13:29] you must be in his time for for for the
[1:13:32] rapture
[1:13:33] the word that's being expressed right
[1:13:35] now whatever it is like like I said what
[1:13:38] we feed on what we hear what we read
[1:13:41] what we Fellowship about
[1:13:44] when we come into the house of the Lord
[1:13:46] I don't know about you but when I come
[1:13:48] into the house of the Lord on Wednesday
[1:13:50] and Sunday I'm listening for something
[1:13:53] that is going to give me Supernatural
[1:13:56] faith
[1:13:58] I'm listening for another line upon line
[1:14:01] because precept upon precept he's given
[1:14:04] me the overcoming power and he's given
[1:14:07] me the confidence to continue to serve
[1:14:09] him every single day I'm more excited
[1:14:12] about the word of God today than I've
[1:14:14] ever been
[1:14:15] why because he's a living God his
[1:14:19] presence is Vindicated in our midst
[1:14:21] through the discernment of the word
[1:14:23] through Supernatural events that are
[1:14:26] happening around my life people don't
[1:14:28] have to be raised from the dead for me
[1:14:31] to be convinced that God is God
[1:14:35] when I see somebody receive a revelation
[1:14:37] and live that Revelation that is being
[1:14:40] brought from the dead
[1:14:43] when an individual can receive this
[1:14:46] message
[1:14:47] which is very far and few between
[1:14:51] that is more Supernatural than anything
[1:14:55] else to a son or daughter of God
[1:14:58] and a pastor of the church he's looking
[1:15:00] for that he's looking for for God to add
[1:15:04] to the church not just people
[1:15:08] God's looking for rainbow trout
[1:15:12] God is God is looking for individuals
[1:15:15] that are going to be filled with
[1:15:16] Revelation when a pastor is leading a
[1:15:19] church he's looking for people that are
[1:15:21] going to be filled with Revelation to
[1:15:24] live and to and to and to perform in the
[1:15:27] position that God is going to place them
[1:15:29] in
[1:15:30] because when they get placed into that
[1:15:32] position by Revelation that's rapturing
[1:15:36] Faith being expressed in their lives
[1:15:41] it takes Supernatural Faith we're living
[1:15:44] in a time where people are falling away
[1:15:48] they're falling away from God they're
[1:15:50] they're not serious about this message
[1:15:53] like they were maybe when they first
[1:15:54] came in why what's going on
[1:15:58] but the scripture said that there would
[1:15:59] be a falling away
[1:16:01] people would would but it's not so much
[1:16:03] that they're falling away it's that the
[1:16:06] word is progressing and moving on
[1:16:09] the revelation of the Rapture is getting
[1:16:12] stronger and stronger
[1:16:14] God is shaking the church like we heard
[1:16:17] here on Sunday why is he shaking the
[1:16:20] church because that which will be shaken
[1:16:22] will be shaken
[1:16:24] but that which will remain is the Sons
[1:16:26] and Daughters of God that are going to
[1:16:28] produce
[1:16:29] the body change they're going to produce
[1:16:31] the rapture they're going to produce an
[1:16:34] overpower an overcoming life
[1:16:37] they're going to produce fruit for the
[1:16:40] kingdom of God
[1:16:43] verse 114.
[1:16:46] well first you must be in his time it
[1:16:49] must be in his season you got that now
[1:16:52] must be in his time it must be in his
[1:16:55] season time and season
[1:16:57] we are in the season of The Rapture
[1:17:01] that's the season that we're in
[1:17:04] when people when listen when I talk to
[1:17:06] people out there and they they call
[1:17:07] themselves Christians you know
[1:17:10] eventually I'm going to get to the place
[1:17:12] where I'm gonna say so so you know
[1:17:15] praise God you know the world's going
[1:17:16] like because you know a lot of people
[1:17:18] they'll talk about the chaos they'll
[1:17:20] talk about the sodomite conditions
[1:17:21] they'll talk about you know things that
[1:17:24] are happening in the world where where
[1:17:25] you know Financial situations are taking
[1:17:27] place now and they'll talk about the
[1:17:29] mark of the beast and you won't be able
[1:17:31] to buy or sell and this and that and I
[1:17:33] say well thank God praise God for the
[1:17:35] rapture
[1:17:37] yeah they
[1:17:40] if if if they had a Rapture Revelation
[1:17:44] in them
[1:17:46] they're going to respond
[1:17:48] they're going to say Amen brother in the
[1:17:50] twinkling of an eye we're going to be
[1:17:52] changed Hallelujah because if the same
[1:17:54] spirit that raised Christ from the dead
[1:17:56] dwell in you it's gonna Quicken your
[1:17:59] mortal Hallelujah you see that's the
[1:18:01] Deep call to the Deep that's that's a
[1:18:03] response that you want to hear
[1:18:05] and then you want to talk about God you
[1:18:08] know giving rapturing faith in this hour
[1:18:10] the kind of faith that we're going to
[1:18:12] need because you know the just shall
[1:18:14] live by faith but what kind of Faith do
[1:18:16] you have do you have the faith to
[1:18:18] overcome he says yes I do I'm just like
[1:18:21] the Son of God Jesus Christ
[1:18:26] so you believe in the trinity
[1:18:28] well yeah there's the father there's the
[1:18:31] son and then there's the Holy Spirit
[1:18:33] which is the power of God
[1:18:37] nope
[1:18:39] deep called to the Deep
[1:18:42] an attribute of God can never Place God
[1:18:46] into three
[1:18:48] it can't happen
[1:18:50] it's not in the here ye Israel the Lord
[1:18:53] thy God is one
[1:18:55] Philip stood right in front of her right
[1:18:57] in front of Jesus and he said Lord show
[1:19:00] us the Father and Jesus looked at him he
[1:19:01] says Philip
[1:19:03] have I not been with you so long if you
[1:19:05] see me you see the father
[1:19:11] one
[1:19:13] not two not three you see but without
[1:19:16] that kind of faith
[1:19:19] without the attribute of God because
[1:19:22] listen let's just face it
[1:19:26] we were just like anybody else
[1:19:29] and we are
[1:19:31] just like anybody else in this
[1:19:35] don't you try to tell me oh no I I can
[1:19:39] do this and I can do that and yeah you
[1:19:42] can go you can can you go without sleep
[1:19:44] for 48 hours
[1:19:47] are you that
[1:19:49] super being that you're already in your
[1:19:51] theophany
[1:19:52] no
[1:19:54] but there's something in you called the
[1:19:56] attribute of God
[1:19:58] and that can never ever disbelieve the
[1:20:01] word of God
[1:20:03] when you've got a revelation of that and
[1:20:06] you know that you are an attribute of
[1:20:07] God an expression of God and how do you
[1:20:10] know that you are because you will
[1:20:12] recognize your word for the day you will
[1:20:14] recognize God sent the prophet you will
[1:20:17] recognize the hour the day the season
[1:20:19] the time and what God is requiring for
[1:20:22] us to fulfill in this day and in this
[1:20:24] hour
[1:20:25] verse 114 and it must be according to
[1:20:28] his word
[1:20:30] that has been spoken
[1:20:33] God sent us a prophet for that very
[1:20:37] purpose because God does nothing unless
[1:20:40] he first reveals it unto his servants
[1:20:42] the prophets
[1:20:44] and so we got to recognize that we've
[1:20:47] received his word
[1:20:49] through a Vindicated prophet and that
[1:20:52] word has been so Vindicated in you
[1:20:55] personally you've become one with that
[1:20:58] word
[1:20:59] you know I mean there's so much we could
[1:21:01] get into here about about receiving a
[1:21:04] profit
[1:21:05] but it's absolutely necessary for the
[1:21:09] world to know that God sent a 20th
[1:21:13] century Prophet by the name of William
[1:21:15] Miriam Branham
[1:21:17] to fulfill scripture
[1:21:19] that would bring us to where we are
[1:21:22] today we're going to be looking at all
[1:21:24] of that through this whole rapturing
[1:21:27] Faith series
[1:21:28] I've been studying over the last couple
[1:21:30] weeks and there's been so much
[1:21:33] that that that that's there and so much
[1:21:36] that that the Lord is just pouring out
[1:21:38] all kinds of uh quotes and scripture and
[1:21:42] inspiration and vindicating here and
[1:21:44] there about what it is that that that's
[1:21:46] in this message that I've been so
[1:21:49] blessed but then two days no yesterday
[1:21:51] the Lord said whoa settle down son
[1:21:56] this is you know you you got it you
[1:21:59] gotta put this into the right
[1:22:00] perspective you got to lay in a
[1:22:02] foundation
[1:22:03] you got to let the simple people this
[1:22:05] word has got to be so simple that the
[1:22:07] youngest children in the house need to
[1:22:10] be able to recognize what God is doing
[1:22:12] that God is giving them faith
[1:22:15] to receive this word and receive this
[1:22:17] message it needs to be simple it needs
[1:22:20] to be brought in a way where people can
[1:22:23] recognize and those that are listening
[1:22:25] in and and and you know that are in
[1:22:27] other denomination and people that you
[1:22:30] that you testify to you can't just walk
[1:22:32] up to them and tell them Hey listen you
[1:22:34] know what God sent a prophet if you
[1:22:36] haven't heard that you're going to hell
[1:22:37] because he came to call out of people
[1:22:40] and that's all there's to it
[1:22:42] no that's not all that's to it
[1:22:44] there's a lot of people that will quote
[1:22:46] that
[1:22:47] and a lot of people are saying oh if you
[1:22:49] don't believe God sent a prophet and you
[1:22:51] don't believe exactly what the prophet
[1:22:53] said and only what the prophet said then
[1:22:55] you're not going anywhere
[1:22:58] no sir
[1:23:00] this what brother Branham was talking
[1:23:02] about when he was saying we're going to
[1:23:04] have a faith
[1:23:06] meeting
[1:23:07] and people are going to recognize his
[1:23:10] Supernatural presence and they will be
[1:23:13] healed because God will so reveal the
[1:23:16] faith to them that they're healed that
[1:23:19] they will be healed
[1:23:23] God reveals to you as God reveals to you
[1:23:27] this rapturing faith
[1:23:30] the Rapture will become so real to you
[1:23:33] that you will be expecting it around you
[1:23:35] constantly that it could happen at any
[1:23:38] moment
[1:23:39] because God is so real God is not some
[1:23:42] mummy and daddy tells me about about God
[1:23:45] no that's not what this is about oh
[1:23:47] brother Simon Beacon preach the word of
[1:23:49] God he can put those quotes together so
[1:23:51] perfect that that must be the church
[1:23:54] where the Rapture is going to be I got
[1:23:55] to make sure I'm there every Sunday when
[1:23:57] Pastor Simon preaches because then I'll
[1:23:59] be sure to be in the rapture
[1:24:03] God don't have any grandchildren
[1:24:06] God only has Sons and Daughters of God
[1:24:09] that are going to fulfill this word
[1:24:11] because of him in them
[1:24:15] they will he says on that day he shall
[1:24:17] know that I am in the father ye and me
[1:24:19] and I in you
[1:24:21] so just think back of when you came to
[1:24:24] the Lord what was the thing that that
[1:24:26] stirred upon your heart I remember I
[1:24:29] remember when I was listening to Pastor
[1:24:30] Simon preaching and he was talking about
[1:24:32] the Holy Ghost he said that spirit of
[1:24:34] God he the Holy Ghost this the holy
[1:24:36] ghost that and I said I need the Holy
[1:24:39] Ghost
[1:24:40] and God gave me the Holy Ghost when he
[1:24:44] allowed me to see this message
[1:24:47] God told me I had the Holy Ghost because
[1:24:50] I could see them I remember when I went
[1:24:52] to Pastor Simon I said pastor Simon I
[1:24:55] want the Holy Ghost and I remember him
[1:24:57] looking and he said to me he says
[1:24:58] brother you got the Holy Ghost
[1:25:00] I said yeah I said but I want to be
[1:25:02] baptized you see that is the element
[1:25:06] that we need to recognize that this is
[1:25:09] not something that just started
[1:25:11] this is something that God is doing this
[1:25:15] is not a future event
[1:25:17] this is a now event
[1:25:21] so it must be according to his word
[1:25:23] that's been spoken it must I don't care
[1:25:26] how well you say this ought to be or
[1:25:28] that ought to be or this ought to be
[1:25:31] it's got to be according to his word
[1:25:33] according to his time and his season and
[1:25:37] it must be given according to the person
[1:25:40] he has chosen to do it by
[1:25:44] now a lot of people
[1:25:46] they recognize that God sent a prophet
[1:25:49] when brother Branham was on the scene
[1:25:51] and they were the bride they were the
[1:25:53] called out they were the chosen of that
[1:25:55] day they recognized that God had sent a
[1:25:59] prophet they realized brother Branham
[1:26:01] was Malachi 4 they realized that he was
[1:26:04] Revelations 10 7. they saw
[1:26:07] and they recognize that he was the one
[1:26:10] that God had chosen to bring that
[1:26:13] portion of the word by but what God was
[1:26:16] doing in the days of when brother
[1:26:18] Branham was here was that he was calling
[1:26:21] out a church from Pentecost
[1:26:24] he was calling out a church out of
[1:26:26] laodicea
[1:26:28] he was not calling for the Rapture at
[1:26:32] that time he was calling for a church to
[1:26:35] come out of the denominational laodocian
[1:26:38] Church age and those that recognized the
[1:26:41] season of brother Branham they
[1:26:43] recognized the season of what brother
[1:26:45] branham's part was in the word of God
[1:26:48] that he was not the mighty angel
[1:26:51] there was two angels in Revelations 10.
[1:26:54] there was the mighty Angel which was
[1:26:55] Jesus Christ standing on the earth and
[1:26:58] on the land and on the sea and said that
[1:27:01] time shall be no more but then there was
[1:27:03] an Earthly angel that had to be on the
[1:27:05] earth at that particular time when the
[1:27:09] Seven Seals were going to be revealed
[1:27:10] we're going to be looking at all of this
[1:27:12] and breaking it down
[1:27:14] and and seeing how important it was for
[1:27:18] these events to have taken place but
[1:27:21] brother Branham was the one that God had
[1:27:24] chosen at that time
[1:27:28] it's always been God
[1:27:31] next
[1:27:34] you must be in his time
[1:27:38] you know when I read that
[1:27:40] it kind of stepped out of the page
[1:27:44] and I came to realize
[1:27:45] yeah
[1:27:47] recognizing that that now you can take
[1:27:50] this how you want but the word is
[1:27:52] compounded and when I read that it spoke
[1:27:55] to me you must be in that time you must
[1:27:59] be in that in that in that season you
[1:28:02] must be conscious of yourself in the
[1:28:05] word of God that you are in that season
[1:28:08] of the word to be fulfilled that the
[1:28:11] Rapture is going to take place and that
[1:28:13] you are the you are accounted as one of
[1:28:16] those that's going to be in the rapture
[1:28:19] it must be in his season you got you got
[1:28:22] that now must be in his time must be in
[1:28:25] his season time and season and it must
[1:28:28] be according to his word that has been
[1:28:30] spoken okay it must it must I don't care
[1:28:34] how well you you say this ought to be so
[1:28:37] we don't want our own interpretation and
[1:28:40] he has chosen and and the person he has
[1:28:42] chosen let's go to the next slide sorry
[1:28:44] I don't care how much dignitaries
[1:28:47] there is a King David just as great as
[1:28:50] any of them he was King over the nation
[1:28:52] but he had a way of doing it and he had
[1:28:56] told them how he would do it but they
[1:28:59] failed to do it
[1:29:01] they were told how they were to do
[1:29:04] everything in the in the days of David
[1:29:07] that you know with the ark and
[1:29:09] everything that they were told to do
[1:29:12] but it must be according to his word not
[1:29:15] man's interpretation of the word
[1:29:18] to his time according to his program
[1:29:21] next
[1:29:25] and it must be by the person he has
[1:29:28] chosen to give it and to do it Moses
[1:29:31] tried to run from it take somebody else
[1:29:34] but God chose Moses to do it many of
[1:29:38] them Paul tried to get out of it many
[1:29:40] others but it got to it's got to be by
[1:29:43] the one he chooses to do it and it must
[1:29:46] come first to His prophets the word of
[1:29:50] God must come to His prophets and we
[1:29:52] know that brother Branham was our
[1:29:54] prophet
[1:29:56] but listen carefully here the word of
[1:29:58] God must come to His prophets Amos 3 7
[1:30:00] the Lord God will do nothing until he
[1:30:04] first reveals it unto his servant the
[1:30:07] prophet
[1:30:08] four and the prophet must be Vindicated
[1:30:11] by the word of God
[1:30:13] there is your five musts
[1:30:16] they need to be Vindicated
[1:30:19] now it's got to be that way his time his
[1:30:23] season when he said it would be and the
[1:30:26] man that he chose and it must come to
[1:30:28] the prophet and the prophet must be a
[1:30:31] Vindicated Prophet we find out many of
[1:30:34] them in the Bible it come to the
[1:30:36] prophets and it wasn't Vindicated our
[1:30:39] Prophet is Jesus Christ
[1:30:43] let the musicians come
[1:30:52] we need to recognize
[1:30:57] that God is looking for maturity
[1:31:00] he's looking for us
[1:31:03] to come to a place
[1:31:05] where we will recognize
[1:31:08] what is required the time the season
[1:31:11] how he's bringing his word
[1:31:14] as we continue here
[1:31:16] we're going to be moving forward
[1:31:19] into the season that we're not in the
[1:31:22] season of William Miriam Branham anymore
[1:31:29] we are no longer
[1:31:31] in the laodicean church age
[1:31:34] spiritually
[1:31:37] we are
[1:31:38] from a physical standpoint it's laodicea
[1:31:42] all around us
[1:31:43] but we have transitioned into another
[1:31:47] age
[1:31:50] next slide
[1:31:52] and this is
[1:31:54] what we're going to be looking at in
[1:31:56] part two
[1:31:58] fruit cannot ripen unless the sun ripens
[1:32:01] it
[1:32:03] we need to know what is going to be
[1:32:05] required in order for us to have the
[1:32:07] rapturing faith
[1:32:09] to be translated
[1:32:11] it's not something that you're going to
[1:32:13] be taught oh brother Denny's going to
[1:32:15] teach us how to go in the Rapture no
[1:32:18] nobody can teach anybody how to go in
[1:32:21] the rapture
[1:32:23] but what we're going to recognize as we
[1:32:26] go through this series is that
[1:32:29] you need to be in the right atmosphere
[1:32:32] you need to be in the right expectation
[1:32:36] you need to see yourself in the right
[1:32:38] dispensation
[1:32:40] the time that we're living in and what
[1:32:43] it is that God is looking to do no
[1:32:46] matter how much you preach whatever you
[1:32:49] do it cannot be ripened it cannot be
[1:32:52] manifested it cannot be Vindicated only
[1:32:56] by him who said I am the light of the
[1:32:59] world the word
[1:33:02] so there has to come forth a power
[1:33:05] the Holy Spirit himself
[1:33:08] to ripen or to vindicate or to prove or
[1:33:13] to make manifested that what he
[1:33:16] predicted would happen in this day
[1:33:21] I'm not talking about brother branham's
[1:33:23] day yes he spoke that quote
[1:33:26] but all there's a lot here we're going
[1:33:28] to be looking at a lot that brother
[1:33:30] Branham listen it was the voice of God
[1:33:34] God was speaking through the angel
[1:33:38] it would when when brother Branham said
[1:33:41] thus saith the Lord it was not brother
[1:33:43] Branham saying that it was God speaking
[1:33:46] we need to realize that it's going to
[1:33:48] take that Supernatural element that's
[1:33:51] going to bring us into that rapturing
[1:33:53] Faith condition and realize that we are
[1:33:57] being translated we're being changed
[1:33:59] word upon word line upon line precept
[1:34:02] upon precept the evening light produces
[1:34:05] that we are in the evening time this is
[1:34:08] the time where the where where we're
[1:34:11] being called out this is evening time
[1:34:14] evangelism we need to have the right
[1:34:16] message we need to be able to
[1:34:18] communicate the right message to to when
[1:34:21] when we testify when we tell the people
[1:34:24] about the spirit of God what God is
[1:34:26] doing in this hour we need to be mature
[1:34:29] Sons and Daughters of God
[1:34:32] and so we're going to be looking
[1:34:34] at these things I've got some quotes
[1:34:37] here I'm not going to read them now but
[1:34:39] it talks about how we've moved from the
[1:34:41] little decision age and that we are now
[1:34:44] in the bright age
[1:34:46] and we are in an eternal Church age
[1:34:50] praise God may the Lord bless you may it
[1:34:54] cause you to go search and and Ponder on
[1:34:58] these thoughts
[1:34:59] I don't got ordinary faith
[1:35:02] say it I don't have ordinary faith
[1:35:06] I have rapturing faith
[1:35:10] it's going to change us it's going to
[1:35:12] transform us it's going to change the
[1:35:14] conditions around my life
[1:35:16] I'm not going to remain I'm not going to
[1:35:18] get caught into the situations of this
[1:35:20] world I'm not going to be pulled into
[1:35:22] the tribulation too many people are are
[1:35:25] looking at the tribulation and and the
[1:35:27] way they're they're looking into it and
[1:35:28] and trying to understand it and
