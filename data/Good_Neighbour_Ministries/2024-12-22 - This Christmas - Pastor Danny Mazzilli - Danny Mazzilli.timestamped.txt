[37:21] the ey amen and we want to know what God
[37:24] is up to this Christmas so let's watch
[37:26] this very very short um
[37:30] trigger
[37:32] video and then we will go to the word of
[37:34] God Amen
[37:56] [Music]
[38:22] [Music]
[38:51] amen praise God what is God up to let's
[38:54] read our scripture let's all stand
[38:59] Isaiah chapter 9:6 a very familiar
[39:02] scripture but something that um never
[39:05] ceases to
[39:07] amaze uh all Christians and all people
[39:11] worldwide For unto us a child is born
[39:15] unto us a son is given and the
[39:19] government shall be upon his shoulder
[39:22] and his name Shall be Called wonderful
[39:25] counselor the mighty Mighty God the
[39:29] Everlasting father the Prince of Peace
[39:34] praise God you may be seated God bless
[39:37] you amen as we watch that video you
[39:40] probably noticed the word Advent you
[39:43] know uh because this time of the year
[39:46] many of the churches they start their
[39:48] Christmas season and they call it Advent
[39:51] but for us when we look at the word
[39:54] Advent and we actually look at the
[39:56] definition of the word in Christian
[39:59] theology it's the coming or second
[40:02] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and so
[40:05] the world is is constantly under that
[40:09] expectation in this day that he's coming
[40:13] again and that you know they're they're
[40:15] waiting and they're they're they're uh
[40:18] celebrating and rejoicing that the that
[40:21] the child was born and they're looking
[40:23] back at Jesus Christ in the form of a
[40:27] baby and then growing into a man and
[40:30] then knowing that he will be coming back
[40:33] again but here we are the True Church of
[40:37] God those that have recognized not just
[40:40] what he's done in the past and through
[40:43] history and what he's going to do in the
[40:45] future but recognizing what he is doing
[40:48] now the importance of recognizing that
[40:52] the word of God never sleeps it is
[40:56] constantly evolving and progressing and
[41:00] the and the church is a great part of
[41:03] that Evolution right now of the body of
[41:06] Jesus Christ and so we're looking at
[41:09] this um thought today you know I came
[41:11] across this and and I thought you know I
[41:14] it kind of triggered me and it's a great
[41:17] question for Christmas what is God up to
[41:20] that's a that's a waiting question like
[41:22] you saw there it's an expectation
[41:25] question because a lot of people you
[41:26] know for some people Christmas well
[41:29] wonder what the Christmas tree is going
[41:32] to bring me this year I wonder what
[41:34] gifts are going to be under the tree
[41:37] this year I wonder if I'm going to get a
[41:40] Christmas bonus or a promotion at work
[41:44] you know for people it's it's a it's a
[41:47] question that that you can take it in so
[41:50] many different ways and it means so many
[41:53] different things to so many different
[41:55] people but for the church Church those
[41:58] that are that have recognized that that
[42:01] that God is prophetically bringing his
[42:04] word to pass and that there are events
[42:06] taking place around us that all surround
[42:10] and evolve around the coming of the
[42:13] Mighty God the scriptures said he'd he'd
[42:16] be the Prince of Peace the scriptures
[42:19] said that the government would be upon
[42:21] his shoulders a lot of them would look
[42:24] back and they would think of Jesus when
[42:26] he came to to the Earth and they they
[42:28] they would have thought oh he's going to
[42:29] be he's going to be the new government
[42:31] he's the new king he's going to wipe out
[42:34] the Roman Empire that are taking Israel
[42:38] and placing them under this type of
[42:40] slavery and bondage at times and trying
[42:42] to control them but here he means so
[42:46] much more to us as the true church the
[42:50] Sons and Daughters of God in this day
[42:53] and in this hour amen we know he's up to
[42:56] something big
[42:57] he's preparing something he's getting
[43:00] ready to do something what is it what is
[43:03] it for you I know what it is for me I
[43:07] know that the Rapture is something that
[43:09] stirs within my heart every single
[43:12] moment every single
[43:14] day amen there's a word of Prophecy that
[43:18] God has prepared for the church in this
[43:20] day and in this hour and and we've been
[43:23] placed under the right
[43:25] expectation because we come into a right
[43:29] relationship it's when we ask what what
[43:32] are you up to Lord we can see so many
[43:35] times in our daily lives and the
[43:37] activities and the circumstances that we
[43:40] that we come into sometimes we find
[43:42] oursel under such
[43:44] oppression sometimes we find ourselves
[43:46] elated with such joy and you can ask the
[43:50] same question when you're in both those
[43:53] extremes Lord what are you up to
[43:57] what are you doing in my life amen and
[44:01] so you know this question is what we're
[44:04] going to just look into a little bit
[44:06] today we we want to search and see where
[44:10] God has us what he's doing what he wants
[44:12] to do in our individual lives and put us
[44:15] under the right expectation at this
[44:18] Christmas time amen praise God and so
[44:23] let's read
[44:24] um uh first of all
[44:27] uh I want you to notice
[44:30] here when um a quote here listen to
[44:34] brother brandham he says here in the in
[44:36] the quote 1961
[44:39] expectation about the scripture we just
[44:41] read he says now let's say Simeon was
[44:44] setting back in his study maybe it's on
[44:48] a Monday morning all the priests are at
[44:50] their work and there was about two and a
[44:54] half million Jews in Palestine at that
[44:57] time so several babies was borned
[45:01] overnight on the Eighth Day the males
[45:04] had to be
[45:06] circumcised let's think Simeon sitting
[45:09] back in his office he's got the word
[45:12] he's looking all through it like that
[45:15] and he comes upon the scroll perhaps
[45:17] over here in Isaiah and he says Isaiah
[45:23] 6:9 and then that kind of caught my
[45:26] attention
[45:28] and so I stopped right there when I was
[45:30] reading the quote and I said because
[45:33] when you read on you know that he's
[45:34] talking about Isaiah 9:6 but it caught
[45:37] my attention so I went
[45:40] back and I looked at Isaiah
[45:45] 6:9 and I always read a scripture before
[45:48] it and a scripture after it and this is
[45:51] what it said also I have heard the voice
[45:56] of the Lord this this is verse 8 saying
[45:59] whom shall I send and who will go for us
[46:04] then said I here am I send me and this
[46:09] is verse n and he said go and tell this
[46:13] people hear ye indeed but understand not
[46:18] you see th this this message that that
[46:21] we have that God has given us we've been
[46:24] told to go and pronounce this message
[46:27] but many many don't understand really
[46:32] what God was doing when he came to the
[46:34] earth a lot of them have it in their
[46:37] mind as a story but he says here he says
[46:41] make the heart of this people fat and
[46:44] make their ears heavy and shut their
[46:47] eyes lest they see with their eyes and
[46:50] hear with their ears and understand with
[46:54] their heart and convert and be healed my
[46:58] God this message that that that God has
[47:01] given us is so much greater than what
[47:05] the people make it the they call it
[47:08] Christmas there's so much more to this
[47:12] yes that that that that if we can just
[47:14] settle ourselves down here this morning
[47:17] forget about all the meals and forget
[47:20] about all the pressure and forget about
[47:22] the the the the jobs and and all of the
[47:25] things that are heavy on our mind minds
[47:27] and we just enter into the true meaning
[47:31] of this season we can draw from it
[47:34] miraculous things and one of the most
[47:37] miraculous is that unto you it has been
[47:39] given to know these
[47:41] things Jesus and so he goes on here in
[47:44] the quote after he says over here in
[47:46] Isaiah 69 he says he says to us and then
[47:49] he quotes the scripture to us a son is
[47:52] born a child is given so forth his name
[47:56] shall be called called counselor Prince
[47:58] of Peace the Mighty God the Everlasting
[48:00] father I can just imagine him sitting
[48:04] there he's talking about Simeon now now
[48:07] all the time little Mary was on her Road
[48:11] up there to have the baby
[48:13] circumcised she comes into the prayer
[48:16] line or whatever it might be the line
[48:18] going up for circumcision all the babies
[48:21] was dressed in nice little fine needle
[48:24] work you know and cute little fellows
[48:27] and no teeth you know and oh I just love
[48:29] them he says and see the little guys
[48:32] there and mothers sweet with their
[48:34] little baby but here he had wrapped in
[48:38] his swaddling cloth you know where they
[48:42] got it off the Yoke of an ox in the
[48:46] stall and yet the very
[48:48] creator of Heaven and Earth and we put
[48:53] on a $50 suit and just turn up our noses
[48:57] like if it would rain it would drown
[49:00] us and our savior was born without even
[49:06] clothes to wrap him in foxes has dens
[49:11] the birds of the air has Nest but the
[49:13] son of man has not a place to lay his
[49:16] head who are we how should we well I'm I
[49:21] belong to the biggest church in this
[49:22] city oh mercy brother sister when you
[49:26] feel like that you're getting away from
[49:28] God right
[49:30] then God has he's he's obligated to me
[49:34] he's obligated to
[49:36] nothing you're obligated to him amen he
[49:41] done his part you've got to believe just
[49:44] like the rest of them believe you've got
[49:46] to come the same way they
[49:52] come so you can picture the scene here
[49:55] you know when Jesus first came came to
[49:56] the Earth the first time it was just an
[49:59] ordinary day just another day in in
[50:03] Jerusalem it was just another day in the
[50:05] city they were they were circumcising
[50:08] babies but yet the Messiah the Mighty
[50:11] God a child had been born a son had been
[50:14] given the government would be upon his
[50:16] shoulders he would be the one to to
[50:19] reconcile the world back to
[50:24] himself and yet very few recognized what
[50:27] was going
[50:28] on why because of the way that he
[50:32] came amen glory to God and so after
[50:37] 2,000 years the events of Jesus's birth
[50:40] become so fil so so familiar to
[50:44] everybody you know at this time of the
[50:45] year they're doing the plays in the
[50:46] churches the baby uh manger scene and
[50:49] all all the you know the the three Magi
[50:52] and the and and coming to to worship the
[50:55] king and all of those things has just
[50:57] become a lost
[50:59] novelty the star the Shepherds the wise
[51:02] men of birth in the stable a 5-year-old
[51:05] can recite the basic outline of the
[51:07] Christmas story these days but don't
[51:10] have Christmas in their hearts
[51:13] amen but we forget for the people who
[51:16] were actually involved in
[51:19] it there was it wasn't it wasn't just
[51:23] another ordinary day no Mary knew
[51:27] about her experience she knew what had
[51:29] taken place she knew that the angel of
[51:32] the Lord had come and spoke to her and
[51:35] said blessed art thou amongst all women
[51:38] God had chosen her of all the women he
[51:41] chose her to be the carrier amen the
[51:45] mother carrier not the mother of God
[51:49] like they like to say that Mary is the
[51:51] mother of God Mary there's no mother of
[51:53] God how can God have a mother he had no
[51:55] beginning in no
[51:57] end mother was was something instituted
[52:01] as a result of
[52:03] unbelief you know that yeah it
[52:05] originated back in the garden when when
[52:07] Adam looked and and and God had taken
[52:10] from his rib uh and made a woman he
[52:13] looked at her and called her name Eve
[52:16] which means the mother of all living you
[52:18] know why he called her Eve because he
[52:21] knew that she would be beguiled and that
[52:25] that sons and daughters would now be
[52:27] coming through through the law of sex
[52:30] that she would be you know that that
[52:32] that God's original plan which was that
[52:35] he could just speak into
[52:38] existence and everything changed right
[52:40] at that moment and motherhood became a
[52:44] part of this
[52:46] existence and so we need to put
[52:48] everything in its proper
[52:49] perspective you see when God allows you
[52:51] to go back to the beginning and says it
[52:55] was not so from the beginning amen then
[52:57] you understand why it was not so and
[53:00] then you can start to put together
[53:01] everything and understand why you cannot
[53:05] worship a
[53:07] woman and worship
[53:11] Mary and call her the mother of God when
[53:15] God's plan had nothing to do with that
[53:18] other than the Redemptive plan
[53:23] through a sinful birth
[53:26] yeah we're not going to get into all of
[53:28] that we've been covering a lot of that
[53:30] over the last few services but here we
[53:34] need to see that it wasn't just an
[53:37] ordinary day for for those individuals
[53:40] every part of it was startling even
[53:43] shocking unfamiliar
[53:46] unprecedented and uncomfortable they
[53:48] were all surely asking at every turn the
[53:52] ones that were that Joseph who knew he
[53:55] had not been with Mary but yet she was
[53:57] she had brought forth this child he knew
[53:59] that he was a supernatural child it
[54:02] wasn't just an ordinary day and for you
[54:05] as Sons and Daughters of God that God
[54:07] has come and intervened in your life and
[54:10] opened your understanding to know the
[54:12] word and to Now read the word and and to
[54:15] draw all of this all these nuggets out
[54:18] of the word don't take it for
[54:20] granted amen your understanding of the
[54:23] word and your ability to see these
[54:26] things Jesus said blessed are your
[54:29] eyes Hallelujah for For unto you it has
[54:33] been given to know the mysteries of the
[54:36] Kingdom these are the mysteries of the
[54:38] Kingdom the things that we're talking
[54:40] about here everybody else out there
[54:42] wants to make Christmas just a fairy
[54:44] tale or a story and a lot of them will
[54:46] even tell you that go to
[54:50] church they go to church and they'll
[54:52] tell you not all the stories that you
[54:55] read in the Bible
[54:58] true and I tell them yes you're
[55:02] absolutely right to
[55:04] you but not to
[55:06] me because because the spirit has made
[55:10] it Li live the spirit has given life to
[55:13] the word and now I can understand it all
[55:16] by the grace of God what God is allowing
[55:18] me to see and what God is allowing me to
[55:21] understand up until now
[55:24] amen hallelujah
[55:27] so if you want to know what God is like
[55:29] you need to you need to watch how he
[55:32] behaves look at look at Jesus listen to
[55:34] what he said and watch what he did and
[55:38] that's how you'll understand that he's
[55:40] the same yesterday today and forever
[55:42] let's let's read the next scripture
[55:46] here in John Chapter 14 verse 6
[55:52] to9 just draw the picture here Jesus
[55:55] walking with the disciples
[55:57] and Jesus here saith unto him and he's
[55:59] and he's talking to Phillip they're
[56:01] walking along and and they're and
[56:03] they're questioning him because they're
[56:05] they're mesmerized remember it wasn't
[56:07] ordinary for these people Jesus had now
[56:09] gone from a baby to a to a child to a
[56:13] young man and moved into his public
[56:16] Ministry just like he is right now in
[56:18] our
[56:19] lives and Jesus sayth unto him I am the
[56:23] way the truth and the life no man cometh
[56:27] unto the father but by
[56:30] me he was making it very clear and I and
[56:35] and and if if there's anything we want
[56:36] to make clear today to everybody that's
[56:39] here and those that are listening in
[56:41] that are that are hearing this message
[56:44] is I want you to know that Jesus Christ
[56:47] is still the only way truth and life
[56:52] amen there is no other way to escape
[56:56] this Dimension and what will be coming
[56:59] upon this
[57:00] Dimension and that's why we've made we
[57:03] we've made it uh Our
[57:05] Lives to to feed on the word of God and
[57:08] to understand all that God is giving us
[57:11] in this day which will produce the
[57:13] Rapture of the
[57:15] church if ye had known me listen he says
[57:19] here now if you had known me you should
[57:21] have known my father
[57:24] also now you need to pay close attention
[57:27] to his words they're they're they're so
[57:30] profound he says and from henceforth ye
[57:34] know him and have seen him well wait a
[57:37] minute Philip is now he's
[57:39] perplexed now he's he's totally
[57:42] perplexed he say wait
[57:45] what but he turns around he Philip saith
[57:48] unto him Lord because like he like he he
[57:52] he was like set back there he says wait
[57:54] a minute what's he saying to me's saying
[57:56] that that I'm seeing the father and
[57:58] that's why he comes back with this
[57:59] question he says Lord show us the
[58:03] father and it sufficeth
[58:06] us Jesus saith unto him have I been so
[58:09] long time with you and yet hast thou not
[58:13] known me who's speaking to him thank you
[58:17] Jesus it was the father speaking through
[58:20] the son because he he had he had come
[58:23] into the office of the son he had to
[58:26] come as a human being so that he could
[58:28] go to Calvary so that he could fulfill
[58:31] his own word because God is not a
[58:34] liar God cannot he said heavens and
[58:37] earth will pass away but my
[58:39] prophecy my word that which I spoke in
[58:43] Isaiah 9: 6 it is going to come to
[58:48] pass it will be fulfilled amen glory to
[58:51] God he says he
[58:53] says have hast thou not known me
[58:57] Phillip he that hath seen me hath seen
[59:01] the father and how sayest thou then show
[59:04] us the
[59:06] father he's going right back to him
[59:08] what's the matter with you
[59:10] Phillip come
[59:12] on wake up people recognize who's in
[59:16] your midst recognize what God is doing
[59:19] in this hour recognize that that he's
[59:22] that you know we're going to see here
[59:25] because there's three things that always
[59:27] happen when when God is up to something
[59:30] big amen praise God let's go to the
[59:33] first the first
[59:36] thing next slide it will be in ways we
[59:40] weren't
[59:43] expecting don't listen you want to know
[59:46] what God is up to this Christmas then
[59:49] don't be looking in the areas where you
[59:51] would expect it to happen I'll tell you
[59:54] where it's going to happen it's going to
[59:57] happen in the
[59:59] silence oh hallelujah oh boy I just got
[1:00:03] a thought there my God we could go we
[1:00:05] could go all the way into that half hour
[1:00:07] silence right now and preach another
[1:00:08] message but let me tell you God is doing
[1:00:12] things in the silence that's why it was
[1:00:14] a silent
[1:00:16] night that's why it was a holy place
[1:00:19] because God is moving in ways that you
[1:00:22] that where where you will least expect
[1:00:24] him to move he'll do things for you over
[1:00:27] these next few days next week because of
[1:00:31] the word that's coming forth here today
[1:00:34] he will do things in your life to
[1:00:37] vindicate his word his
[1:00:40] presence his his ability in your life he
[1:00:44] did things for me you know that while I
[1:00:46] was
[1:00:47] pondering had right after I read that
[1:00:50] quote and it and it struck me
[1:00:54] about why would brother brandham say
[1:00:57] Isaiah
[1:00:59] 69 god is
[1:01:02] perfect God has a purpose in everything
[1:01:05] and R away just as I was pondering that
[1:01:07] Ding my phone went off and I looked and
[1:01:11] I read a statement and it was a brother
[1:01:14] that had sent me a statement on how God
[1:01:16] does things
[1:01:19] unexpectedly in ways that you don't
[1:01:22] understand sometimes but God is always
[1:01:25] up to something and God knows everything
[1:01:29] and I thought Oh Glory to God like I'm
[1:01:32] talking right on the
[1:01:34] second I had to text back the brother
[1:01:37] and say brother I
[1:01:38] appreciate because he sends me messages
[1:01:41] on a regular basis and I and I I had to
[1:01:44] tell him I listen I want you to know I
[1:01:46] appreciate you doing these things
[1:01:48] because because right while I was
[1:01:51] pondering on something I received my
[1:01:53] answer right there and then and that's
[1:01:55] when I went back to read Isaiah 6:9 and
[1:01:59] Drew from it another thought that God is
[1:02:02] moving in our midst that God God chose
[1:02:05] us who who am I going to send Hallelujah
[1:02:09] and send to a people and and and even it
[1:02:11] it surrounds this whole message sending
[1:02:13] to a people that that you know they're
[1:02:15] all filled up they're they're they're so
[1:02:17] filled up with knowledge their minds and
[1:02:19] everything else that they will never
[1:02:21] hear the Simplicity of God's word unless
[1:02:24] I send somebody amen you know God's
[1:02:27] using you am God's using you where you
[1:02:30] are at work at home with your children
[1:02:34] with your friends God speaks God uses
[1:02:38] you to pray for situations and he and
[1:02:40] then he he heals them he does things for
[1:02:42] you he's doing it to vindicate his
[1:02:45] presence in your life so that you can
[1:02:48] recognize what God is doing amen yes
[1:02:52] praise God forever more Hallelujah
[1:02:56] so he's doing things in ways that you
[1:02:59] will not expect him to do
[1:03:02] it and so we can ask the question what's
[1:03:05] God up to in your life what's he up to
[1:03:09] in my life what's he up to in this
[1:03:13] church listen this transition over the
[1:03:16] last year has been
[1:03:18] tremendous but extremely
[1:03:22] challenging this week was an
[1:03:24] unbelievably challenging week for me it
[1:03:27] was it was
[1:03:29] remarkable I I on on Monday or Tuesday I
[1:03:33] I did something to my back the pain was
[1:03:36] was extreme I couldn't believe what was
[1:03:38] going on I could barely
[1:03:41] walk I went to see the doctor I I got
[1:03:44] checked I got test you know I got uh
[1:03:47] corrected had to have some special uh
[1:03:50] therapy and electric shock treatment I
[1:03:52] could barely
[1:03:53] walk and then on Wednesday I was
[1:03:56] ministering the word of God I said Lord
[1:03:59] I'm in your service he said take two
[1:04:01] Tylenol and
[1:04:03] go and that's exactly what I did and I
[1:04:07] preached the message on Wednesday night
[1:04:08] and you wouldn't have known
[1:04:10] anything I I walked off the platform and
[1:04:12] I was saying thank you Lord I was
[1:04:14] feeling no like nothing the next morning
[1:04:17] I could barely
[1:04:20] walk I could barely walk I I I couldn't
[1:04:23] believe what was going on I had to go
[1:04:24] straight to the chiroprac tror get it
[1:04:27] done all that stuff and then all day
[1:04:29] Thursday I was in pain I was taking
[1:04:31] Tylenol and it felt like it got
[1:04:34] worse but that's how the enemy
[1:04:38] works by Friday morning I woke up I was
[1:04:41] feeling a little better but it was still
[1:04:44] there but I was trusting God because
[1:04:47] Saints listen we got it we got to we got
[1:04:50] to lift out of this Dimension here stuff
[1:04:53] is going to happen the enemy is going to
[1:04:56] attack mental oppression is going to
[1:04:59] attack he's going to try to get you to
[1:05:00] disbelieve the word he'll do anything
[1:05:03] he'll attack you in areas where you
[1:05:05] least expect it and you wonder sometime
[1:05:09] why would he attack through that
[1:05:12] Avenue because Satan has no respector of
[1:05:16] persons but God is watching your
[1:05:18] attitude amen God Is Watching what
[1:05:21] you're
[1:05:22] thinking yesterday I was feeling a
[1:05:25] little better was probably at
[1:05:27] 75% this morning I woke up and I was at
[1:05:32] 98% now I can bend I can move I can do
[1:05:38] whatever I got because God I claimed my
[1:05:41] healing it's done it's
[1:05:43] finished on Friday I had a thought in my
[1:05:47] mind saying boy you've really done
[1:05:48] something this time you know this time
[1:05:51] you you know no
[1:05:54] no no I said no he's still a
[1:05:57] Healer he's still the same yesterday
[1:06:00] today and
[1:06:02] forever he listen that same devil will
[1:06:05] come and attack you over and over and
[1:06:08] over and all you got to do is resist him
[1:06:11] over and over and over until God proves
[1:06:15] his
[1:06:16] word god it God is not a liar God Will
[1:06:21] Never Never back down from his word
[1:06:25] that's how we that's the kind of
[1:06:27] relationship he wants us to have with
[1:06:30] him doesn't matter how often it keeps
[1:06:33] coming back you send it right back to
[1:06:36] Hell from where it came from Hallelujah
[1:06:39] God is obligated to his word he's not
[1:06:43] obligated to you and and and and and
[1:06:45] he's watching your
[1:06:47] testimony he's watching he's listening
[1:06:50] he's paying attention to your testimony
[1:06:52] because your testimony is showing your
[1:06:55] character yes amen that's what it shows
[1:06:58] God wants character in this hour amen
[1:07:01] praise God and
[1:07:03] so in the events of Jesus's birth and
[1:07:06] life while he was here on Earth in his
[1:07:09] human form we can get a lot of
[1:07:13] indications of what he's like and how to
[1:07:16] expect listen first it'll come in ways
[1:07:19] we're not expecting it will be in ways
[1:07:22] we weren't expecting surprising even St
[1:07:25] startling the Messiah is born in a burn
[1:07:29] imagine in a cave born with with with
[1:07:33] with farm animals around him using
[1:07:35] swaddling cloths they would have never
[1:07:38] ever expected that the Messiah the king
[1:07:41] of glory would come in that
[1:07:43] way that he would come to
[1:07:46] peasants From
[1:07:48] Galilee and then when he when he's
[1:07:51] born he announces it to Outcast
[1:07:53] shepherds in the field
[1:07:58] they're they're they're they're the
[1:07:59] lowly people they're they're out there
[1:08:02] with sheep you know raising sheep
[1:08:04] they're not very smart you know they're
[1:08:07] they're just allowing sheep to follow
[1:08:09] them and and it just shows the humility
[1:08:12] and the character of God that's what it
[1:08:14] shows amen because a Shepherd a real
[1:08:18] Shepherd loves his
[1:08:20] sheep and wants nothing but good for his
[1:08:24] Sheep amen Hallelujah because that's the
[1:08:26] character of God that's what he's placed
[1:08:29] within a true servant a true minister of
[1:08:32] God will only have one desire for the
[1:08:36] people for the Deliverance of the people
[1:08:38] amen that's what he was showing don't
[1:08:41] expect God to work only in ways that
[1:08:43] you're already familiar with because he
[1:08:45] often comes to us in unexpected ways
[1:08:48] through unexpected means just when we
[1:08:51] think we figured him
[1:08:53] out he pulls another one
[1:08:56] and he does something that you didn't
[1:09:00] expect I want you to be under the right
[1:09:03] expectation this
[1:09:04] Christmas I want you to see gifts and
[1:09:07] things happen and come into your life
[1:09:10] like never
[1:09:11] before that experience with Jesus Christ
[1:09:14] just think about how he came to Earth
[1:09:17] for centuries Israel had waited for a
[1:09:19] political
[1:09:21] Messiah they're looking for for politics
[1:09:25] the m Messiah is not in politics the
[1:09:27] only
[1:09:29] political God or Messiah that we will
[1:09:33] experience is when the government is
[1:09:35] upon his shoulders like we read he's
[1:09:38] taking
[1:09:38] over he's just preparing the
[1:09:42] governers right
[1:09:44] now you know all this political system
[1:09:46] where do you think it all came from it
[1:09:49] comes from
[1:09:50] God but it's all perverted because Satan
[1:09:53] is the one that's the god of the
[1:09:55] political systems of this day and we
[1:09:58] know that because Jesus when he went
[1:10:00] into the 40 days of Wilder of of of the
[1:10:02] Temptation in the wilderness it was
[1:10:04] Satan that offered him the kingdoms of
[1:10:06] the world and said they're all
[1:10:09] mine I will give them to you if you
[1:10:11] worship me and God said get behind me
[1:10:17] you've only got a time and a season
[1:10:19] that's it and we know the time and the
[1:10:21] season we know the hour we know that the
[1:10:23] that that the government will be upon
[1:10:25] his shoulders we know that he's
[1:10:26] preparing the rest of the body
[1:10:29] positionally placing each and every one
[1:10:32] of his sons and daughters for the
[1:10:34] millennial Reign amen praise God
[1:10:37] hallelujah so they expected a political
[1:10:41] Messiah don't be looking for God in
[1:10:44] politics God is intervening in the
[1:10:47] politics God will allow certain aspects
[1:10:50] of the politics to come into line with
[1:10:53] his prophecies
[1:10:56] that's what we need to look at anything
[1:10:59] that we look at that that relates to
[1:11:01] government we need to look at how it
[1:11:03] relates to the word in in line with
[1:11:07] God's prophecy amen praise God glory to
[1:11:11] God they expected him to lead a
[1:11:13] rebellion when he came to the Earth they
[1:11:16] were trying to all the zealots were were
[1:11:18] trying to get him to come together and
[1:11:19] say hey we've got to we've got to turn
[1:11:22] uh we got to set up a a a coup here we
[1:11:25] got to we got to get things together so
[1:11:27] that we can take over the government
[1:11:29] we've got the king the king of glory has
[1:11:32] come and he'll just he'll just speak and
[1:11:35] things will
[1:11:38] change they were looking for the kingdom
[1:11:40] to
[1:11:41] come and the only ones that actually
[1:11:43] recognized that the kingdom had come
[1:11:47] were those that followed him a a dozen
[1:11:50] individuals and they would ask him Lord
[1:11:52] when will the Kingdom Come where is the
[1:11:55] king Kingdom and then he looked to them
[1:11:56] and he says the
[1:11:57] kingdom is within
[1:12:00] you he was giving them a prophecy yes of
[1:12:04] the
[1:12:05] future that there would be a kingdom
[1:12:07] that there would be a government that
[1:12:10] that that he would be ruler over that
[1:12:12] government and that you would be a part
[1:12:14] of that Kingdom that you would be in
[1:12:17] that Kingdom Glory to God everything
[1:12:20] that he said was astounding if you look
[1:12:24] and read and a lot the Holy Spirit but
[1:12:26] how did the Messiah make his entrance
[1:12:27] into the world he came in a way that
[1:12:30] made it easy for his own people to
[1:12:33] reject
[1:12:35] him God always does things even amongst
[1:12:39] your own
[1:12:40] families here you are you're you know
[1:12:42] you're so filled with the word of God
[1:12:44] you can't get enough of the word of God
[1:12:47] and your own families and your friends
[1:12:48] are looking at you and they're wondering
[1:12:50] what in the world is he so excited about
[1:12:55] what do they like come on it's just
[1:12:57] Christmas and you're and you're and
[1:12:59] you're breaking you know yesterday I was
[1:13:01] on the phone with a friend and we
[1:13:03] started talking about Christmas and we
[1:13:04] started breaking into you know uh the
[1:13:07] the real meaning of Christmas you know
[1:13:08] he caught me right when I'm when I'm
[1:13:10] studying look out man you don't call a
[1:13:12] preacher when he's
[1:13:14] studying you're going to get you're
[1:13:16] going to hear the word thank you Jesus
[1:13:18] all of a sudden got in you know the real
[1:13:19] meaning of Christmas you know you know
[1:13:21] that Jesus you know that they don't even
[1:13:23] understand Jesus is the it is is
[1:13:25] Christmas you know when Jesus and I
[1:13:27] started to get into you know how Jesus
[1:13:29] when he was on the earth and he was
[1:13:30] amongst his disciples and here he was he
[1:13:33] was God the Creator and he asked his
[1:13:35] disciple Peter and I got into the
[1:13:36] scripture and you know all of a
[1:13:38] sudden things changed right
[1:13:43] away well you know what it's not that
[1:13:46] but but but you see as soon as you start
[1:13:47] to break into Revelation right away a
[1:13:51] distraction came on the scene he had to
[1:13:53] leave he had he had another important
[1:13:54] call coming through of course thank you
[1:13:57] Jesus right but this is but this is the
[1:14:00] this is what happens when when when the
[1:14:02] word starts to want to express itself
[1:14:05] the real word and all you're doing is is
[1:14:08] you're you're quoting scripture you're
[1:14:11] just telling them baptism in Jesus name
[1:14:13] exactly how you know 8,000 people were
[1:14:16] baptized in the book of Acts all in the
[1:14:19] exact same way you show them the
[1:14:20] scriptures acts 238 Acts 19 all the
[1:14:23] scriptures you show them and and and
[1:14:25] it's like while you're talking to them
[1:14:27] you can see their eyes
[1:14:31] closing and you're wondering wow look at
[1:14:35] that right away the enemy's right there
[1:14:38] trying to shut their understanding shut
[1:14:40] their eyes thinking that that that by
[1:14:43] shutting their eyes he's going to not
[1:14:45] allow them to see the word are you
[1:14:47] kidding me when a true attribute or a
[1:14:50] son of God or a daughter of God this
[1:14:52] word flashes before them just
[1:14:55] once something strikes them on the
[1:14:58] inside you can't explain it you don't
[1:15:01] understand it you just know that
[1:15:03] something was just revealed to you that
[1:15:05] that just went beyond normal
[1:15:07] understanding I I'm seeing something I
[1:15:09] don't know why I'm seeing it I don't
[1:15:11] even know why I'm believing it but I
[1:15:13] believe it you see a True Believer a
[1:15:16] true son or daughter of God they believe
[1:15:20] then they see amen what you mean this
[1:15:25] saying that I'll believe it when I see
[1:15:27] it there's zero Faith
[1:15:29] there
[1:15:31] zero an attribute son or daughter of God
[1:15:35] they'll see it
[1:15:39] first they'll they'll they'll they'll
[1:15:41] they'll believe it first sorry they'll
[1:15:44] believe it first because something is
[1:15:46] revealed in their heart they don't even
[1:15:49] know how to explain it because
[1:15:50] Revelation can never be
[1:15:52] explained Revelation is reveal revealed
[1:15:55] that's why it's Revelation
[1:15:58] revealed
[1:15:59] okay you can't explain Revelation it's
[1:16:03] just boom it's in your heart that's why
[1:16:05] Jesus said when he looked to Peter and
[1:16:07] Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son
[1:16:10] of the Living God the Messiah I I'll
[1:16:12] expound on it the one that we were
[1:16:14] waiting on the word made flesh the word
[1:16:17] come to redeem his own to reconcile the
[1:16:20] world to himself you are the Messiah and
[1:16:23] Jesus look he says flesh and blood has
[1:16:25] not revealed this to you you didn't get
[1:16:28] this from your teacher your priest your
[1:16:30] pastor or your friends or your mommy or
[1:16:33] your daddy I revealed it directly from
[1:16:35] my mind directly into your heart and now
[1:16:39] you you there ain't any gate in hell

[1:16:50] man can open glory to God this is the
[1:16:54] true church amen this is how the how how

[1:16:59] people of God amen glory to God he came
[1:17:02] in a way that they that it made it easy
[1:17:05] for his own people to reject him he came
[1:17:07] as a frail baby born in a feeding room
[1:17:10] for Animals there he was the promised
[1:17:13] Messiah who was expected to overthrow
[1:17:15] the mighty Roman Empire and set Israel
[1:17:17] free from the Gentile oppression of the

[1:18:16] of God yet the people see them they see
[1:18:20] their weaknesses they see their their
[1:18:22] their their their their strengths
[1:18:26] but yet they claim to be Children of the
[1:18:29] most high God
[1:18:31] yes and they look and they wonder how
[1:18:34] could this be they come from a family of
[1:18:38] Fighters they come from the are you
[1:18:40] kidding me the father was a
[1:18:45] drunk doesn't even know who his real
[1:18:47] mother is and claiming to be a son yes
[1:18:52] because he comes in ways that are
[1:18:54] unexpected
[1:18:56] and you need to look back and and and
[1:18:58] and not look back on people's pasts and
[1:19:01] identify them by their past and when I
[1:19:04] say past I mean even last
[1:19:07] week too many people are holding on to
[1:19:10] things because they got hurt 17 years

[1:19:38] it in your mind and whatsoever a Man how
[1:19:41] he thinketh in his heart he's already
[1:19:44] committed Jesus himself said even if you
[1:19:47] look upon a woman and to lust after her
[1:19:51] you're committing
[1:19:53] adultery how you going to escape
[1:19:55] something like that thank God he says
[1:20:00] Justified he came to take that all of
[1:20:03] that that's why all of that unbelief all
[1:20:06] of those mistakes all of those things
[1:20:09] that they did to you in the past all of
[1:20:11] those things when you've really truly
[1:20:13] placed them under the
[1:20:15] blood there is no way God even remembers
[1:20:18] it and why are you remembering it and
[1:20:20] living a miserable existence you choose
[1:20:24] that you choose to live that way go
[1:20:26] ahead live that way let me know when you
[1:20:29] want to be
[1:20:30] free so that you can live this life
[1:20:32] Victorious as a son or daughter of God
[1:20:35] knowing that God has giving you a
[1:20:37] future that breaks beyond all of that
[1:20:40] unbelief and all of those things that
[1:20:41] are holding you back from being what God
[1:20:44] wants you to
[1:20:46] be Hallelujah glory to
[1:20:49] God despised and
[1:20:53] oppressed but here I want you to notice
[1:20:56] let's go to the scripture the next the
[1:20:58] next slide here in in Luke 7: 34- 38 I
[1:21:02] want you to see how Jesus reacted how
[1:21:05] Jesus moved on Earth he came in
[1:21:07] unexpected way you would have thought
[1:21:09] maybe he's going to go right to the high
[1:21:11] priest's church and tell them I'm
[1:21:14] here that's not the way he
[1:21:17] comes he was moving amongst the common
[1:21:20] people listen the son of man is come

[1:21:32] wisdom is Justified of all her
[1:21:35] children and one of the Pharisees
[1:21:37] desired him that he would eat with him
[1:21:40] and he went into the Pharisees house and
[1:21:42] sat down to
[1:21:43] eat Jesus wants to come into the average
[1:21:48] ordinary home whether rich or
[1:21:52] poor if he is welcome he'll
[1:21:56] come that's all he's looking for because
[1:22:00] he's he's looking for his
[1:22:02] own and they're
[1:22:04] scattered they're in churches over here
[1:22:06] they're mixed up over there they're in
[1:22:08] New Age movement over here don't ever
[1:22:11] think for one minute that God cannot
[1:22:14] still call he's still calling amen
[1:22:18] they're they wherever they might be God
[1:22:20] is calling them out am and here he
[1:22:23] decides I'm going to go into into the
[1:22:25] Pharisees house the ones that were that
[1:22:26] were rejecting him mocking him calling
[1:22:30] him a heretic all kinds of stuff but he
[1:22:33] gets he gets invited by a Pharisee he'll
[1:22:37] come don't be afraid to go into

[1:22:48] actually
[1:22:49] are just be
[1:22:51] yourself and behold a woman in the city
[1:22:55] which was a
[1:22:57] sinner okay we were all Sinners amen
[1:23:01] don't be looking for uh you know nice
[1:23:03] clean tuna to bring into the church
[1:23:06] don't worry how they look how they smell
[1:23:09] what kind of a past they might have let
[1:23:11] the Holy Spirit deal with their lives
[1:23:14] and deliver them and set them free she
[1:23:16] was a
[1:23:19] prostitute and she she she heard that he
[1:23:22] was there and behold a woman in the city
[1:23:25] which was a sinner which she knew that
[1:23:27] Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisees hot
[1:23:30] in house she brought an alabaster box of
[1:23:33] ointment amen and and in that box were
[1:23:37] expensive ointments that she would use
[1:23:39] yes because it was her business the most
[1:23:43] expensive ointments and stood At His
[1:23:45] Feet behind him weeping amen she
[1:23:49] recognized that she was not living right
[1:23:53] she realized that there was hope for her
[1:23:56] if she could get to Jesus if she could
[1:23:59] just go there and do anything for him
[1:24:02] just just to catch his attention just
[1:24:04] for a moment and she was weeping and
[1:24:06] began to wash his feet with her tears
[1:24:10] because they didn't offer to wash his
[1:24:11] feet when he came in if you go on and
[1:24:14] you read the whole story you know and
[1:24:17] and began to wash his feet with her
[1:24:18] tears and did wipe them with her hair
[1:24:20] and her head and kissed his feet and
[1:24:23] anointed them with the ointment she
[1:24:25] recognized that he was royalty that he
[1:24:28] was the Messiah and yet she was a
[1:24:31] prostitute she was a sinner she knew
[1:24:33] that her life was no
[1:24:35] good but something was revealed to
[1:24:39] her and you will go on and if you read
[1:24:42] go on and read the rest of this story
[1:24:43] Jesus will tell them I came in you
[1:24:46] didn't even wash my feet but this woman
[1:24:49] this woman who who was living a life
[1:24:52] much cleaner than your lives oh my much
[1:24:56] much much no your lives are much cleaner
[1:24:58] than her life her her life was a total
[1:25:00] you you Stone
[1:25:02] her you'd stoned that woman but yet she
[1:25:06] came and washed my feet with her tears
[1:25:09] of
[1:25:10] repentance and then Jesus turned and
[1:25:12] said go and sin no more your sins are
[1:25:16] forgiven that's what God does for us
[1:25:18] that's what he can do for any one of us
[1:25:21] I don't care the circumstance I don't
[1:25:22] care the what what's going on in your
[1:25:24] life if you can just get a hold of of
[1:25:27] the Hem of His Garment just like that
[1:25:29] woman that that heard that Jesus was in
[1:25:31] the crowd and she had a blood issue she
[1:25:34] had been bleeding since she was a young
[1:25:35] woman couldn't stop the bleeding but she
[1:25:38] knew that if she could just Touch the
[1:25:40] Hem of His Garment and meanwhile here
[1:25:43] there was thousands of people and she
[1:25:45] touched his hem and he stopped and said
[1:25:49] whoa who touched me meanwhile though
[1:25:53] everybody had hands on they were all
[1:25:54] touching him but something was
[1:25:56] represented in her she had represented
[1:26:00] she had representation that was one of
[1:26:03] my own that's what struck him there's
[1:26:04] one of my own
[1:26:06] boom and right there and then there was
[1:26:08] a deep call to the deep and she
[1:26:11] responded by the manifestation of a
[1:26:13] complete and total healing in her
[1:26:17] body he does things in unexpected
[1:26:21] ways Hallelujah
[1:26:27] let's go
[1:26:29] to
[1:26:31] John
[1:26:35] 20 Mary I want I want you to see
[1:26:38] something
[1:26:39] here oh yeah here we go reboot on the
[1:26:43] computer
[1:26:45] okay
[1:26:46] yeah so here in John
[1:26:50] 20 13-
[1:26:53] 15 I want to read this and I want to
[1:26:55] draw from this a very very
[1:26:58] interesting scenario on how God
[1:27:01] communicates with his
[1:27:03] own now remember Jesus was in his public
[1:27:06] Ministry and he had just gone to the
[1:27:09] Cross gave up his life for
[1:27:12] us they buried him into the tomb and now
[1:27:15] Mary is going to the tomb to go and
[1:27:18] anoint him with oil she wants to get to
[1:27:22] the body
[1:27:24] and here but Mary stood without at the
[1:27:28] supper weeping and as she wept she
[1:27:31] stooped down and looked into the seler
[1:27:34] to find his body and seeth two angels in
[1:27:37] white sitting the one at the head and
[1:27:40] the other at the feet and she says Where
[1:27:42] and and where like where where the body
[1:27:44] of Jesus had laid and they say unto her
[1:27:47] woman why weepest thou she saith unto
[1:27:50] them because they have taken away my
[1:27:52] Lord and I know know not where they have
[1:27:55] laid him she had come to anoint the body
[1:27:58] she wanted to do something with the body
[1:28:01] of
[1:28:03] Christ
[1:28:06] and when she had said thus she turned
[1:28:10] herself back and saw Jesus standing now
[1:28:14] it's telling us that she saw Jesus
[1:28:16] standing but she didn't know it was
[1:28:18] Jesus and knew not that it was
[1:28:21] Jesus now how could she not know
[1:28:24] that it was Jesus because he had been
[1:28:27] with her he had been with them because
[1:28:31] he had left his public Ministry he had
[1:28:34] gone from being the the the the physical
[1:28:37] Jesus on Earth that was speaking to the
[1:28:40] crowds and doing the Miracles and now he
[1:28:43] had moved on to the next stage of his
[1:28:47] ministry his ministry of redemption had
[1:28:50] now started and it was no longer going
[1:28:53] to be a public
[1:28:55] Ministry a lot of the churches out there
[1:28:57] they're having Christmas services this
[1:28:59] morning they're replaying the manger uh
[1:29:02] scene they're they're they're talking
[1:29:04] about how Jesus came as a baby they're
[1:29:06] they're talking about the Christmas
[1:29:09] story but yet they don't realize that
[1:29:12] he's no longer in a public
[1:29:15] Ministry he has moved from a public
[1:29:18] Ministry to where he is dealing with
[1:29:21] individuals Hallelujah
[1:29:24] he is calling his sons and his daughters
[1:29:27] personally now look what look look what
[1:29:28] happens here Jesus she didn't know that
[1:29:31] it was him Jesus saith unto Heroman why
[1:29:34] weepest thou whom seek thou she
[1:29:38] supposing him to be the gardener saith
[1:29:40] unto him sir if thou has borne him hence
[1:29:44] tell me where thou H has laid him and I
[1:29:46] will take him
[1:29:48] away she just she's still looking for
[1:29:50] the body she didn't realize what was
[1:29:53] actually taking place but go to the next
[1:29:56] slide but then in in 16 and 17 Jesus
[1:29:59] saith unto her
[1:30:01] Mary all of a sudden he speaks her name
[1:30:04] and look she turned herself and saith
[1:30:07] unto him raboni in other words Master
[1:30:10] she knew right there and then that it
[1:30:12] was him why all of a sudden did she know
[1:30:15] it was him because my sheep hear my
[1:30:19] voice hallah when I call them they will
[1:30:23] respond
[1:30:25] all that the father hath given me will
[1:30:28] come he was he was calling her by her
[1:30:31] real name it wasn't Mary so much Mary it
[1:30:35] was that she had representation with him
[1:30:39] and now he was moving into the ministry
[1:30:41] where he was going to call individuals
[1:30:44] one by one by one and Jesus saith unto
[1:30:47] her touch me not for I am not yet
[1:30:49] ascended to the father but go to my
[1:30:53] brethren and say unto them I Ascend unto
[1:30:56] my father and your father and to my God
[1:30:59] and your God oh my he was telling her
[1:31:02] listen The Plan of Redemption is on I'm
[1:31:06] here now to redeem my own I've come back
[1:31:09] to to to reverse the curse glory to God
[1:31:13] Eve fell in the Garden of Eden but I've
[1:31:15] got a wife that I've prepared for me in
[1:31:17] these last days she will not fall amen
[1:31:20] she will know my voice she will
[1:31:23] recognize my voice and she will respond
[1:31:26] to my
[1:31:27] voice and this is the hour that we're
[1:31:30] now moving in it's a it's it's a time of
[1:31:34] Silence to many when they look at us
[1:31:39] they're wondering and they're pondering
[1:31:41] what's God up
[1:31:43] to what's he doing in their
[1:31:46] lives this is
[1:31:50] strange glory to God
[1:31:52] Amen it's an hour where we need to
[1:31:56] understand that that that God is is
[1:32:00] supernaturally interceding into your
[1:32:03] personal lives and when he called me 30
[1:32:06] years ago it seems like a long time it
[1:32:11] seems like so many years but yet it
[1:32:13] seems like just
[1:32:15] yesterday because his word is still
[1:32:18] alive today like it was 30 years ago
[1:32:22] when he when when he called my name I
[1:32:24] didn't understand he was calling my name
[1:32:25] out of a life of drug abuse and and and
[1:32:28] a and a life that was going straight to
[1:32:31] hell I had no
[1:32:34] idea but
[1:32:36] supernaturally I heard his voice and you
[1:32:39] know what I'm talking
[1:32:41] about you know the difference amen
[1:32:45] praise God it's a totally different
[1:32:47] experience it's a totally different
[1:32:50] walk Hallelujah let's look at the next
[1:32:53] slide
[1:32:55] number two it will be in places and
[1:32:58] among people where we weren't
[1:33:04] expecting I had no idea when my partner
[1:33:07] says hey Dan you got to go see this guy
[1:33:09] Gabriel he's a good Furniture maker my
[1:33:12] wife deals with him go there he's going
[1:33:14] to give you a deal I had no idea I said
[1:33:17] I'm okay I'm looking to save
[1:33:19] money I'm not going there to see Jesus
[1:33:23] or or or or hear anything about a
[1:33:25] prophet or anything else I'm going to
[1:33:28] save money and I'm going to go look at
[1:33:30] this guy's furniture and make sure it's
[1:33:32] good and it was
[1:33:34] good and I was very grateful that day
[1:33:37] and I said man this is a great deal he
[1:33:39] gave me such a deal God anointed him
[1:33:41] Hallelujah to give me a deal that would
[1:33:44] get me stirred up to ask him are you
[1:33:48] satisfied with
[1:33:50] this because a good deal I understood
[1:33:52] what a good deal was I was in business a
[1:33:55] good deal when I go down to the food
[1:33:56] terminal and they're asking $20 a case
[1:33:59] on strawberries and I hit them on Friday
[1:34:01] afternoon and I say I'll give you seven
[1:34:03] bucks and they go give me
[1:34:06] nine I'll give you
[1:34:08] eight okay
[1:34:10] Danny I just got a great
[1:34:13] deal okay I know a good deal but they
[1:34:16] were going to throw them out if I didn't
[1:34:18] give them the eight bucks so it was a
[1:34:21] great deal for them and a good deal for
[1:34:22] me and and that's when I said brother
[1:34:24] that's a good deal I didn't call him
[1:34:26] brother I said man that's a good
[1:34:29] deal and little did I know he's going to
[1:34:32] hand me a tape that's going to transform
[1:34:36] and change my life down the road I had
[1:34:38] no idea but he came in a very strange
[1:34:43] Place
[1:34:45] unexpected just had no idea that that
[1:34:48] that something like that was going to
[1:34:49] actually start out and here I leave my
[1:34:51] sunglasses at the doughnut shop because
[1:34:54] God said no not enough you need to go
[1:34:56] back and get more God was working and he
[1:35:00] was moving quickly I went back and now
[1:35:03] he doesn't give me a tape he gives me a
[1:35:04] whole box of
[1:35:07] tapes hallelujah praise God just simple
[1:35:11] uh you know simple but God
[1:35:14] supernaturally doing things that that we
[1:35:17] had no idea we didn't we didn't know
[1:35:19] where to expect it to happen how it was
[1:35:21] going to happen amen praise God
[1:35:25] we're almost there you see how long it's
[1:35:26] taken for my computer to boot up out of
[1:35:29] nowhere just shut off plugged in
[1:35:32] everything why something's
[1:35:35] happening God's up to something God
[1:35:38] wants to speak to somebody God's
[1:35:40] revealing things setting free liberating
[1:35:43] listen this is what church is all about
[1:35:45] Saints we're not we're not into
[1:35:47] traditional Church oh it's a Christmas
[1:35:49] service this is not just a regular
[1:35:51] Christmas service this is where we come
[1:35:53] because Jesus was here before we got
[1:35:56] here amen he's meeting with us because
[1:35:58] he wants to be with us he wants to meet
[1:36:01] with us he wants to fellowship with us
[1:36:03] he wants to uh anoint the word of God so
[1:36:06] that we can receive what we have need of
[1:36:08] in this day and in this hour amen praise
[1:36:12] God hallelujah and
[1:36:14] so in in this we recognize that he's
[1:36:19] going to bring us amongst people that we
[1:36:21] didn't even know you you might come into
[1:36:24] this church and you're going to wonder
[1:36:26] who are all these people man it's like
[1:36:27] the United Nations in
[1:36:29] here they got they got the United
[1:36:31] Nations going to this church you know
[1:36:35] but what is it because God has no
[1:36:38] color God doesn't look at skin God
[1:36:41] doesn't look at a rich poor God's not
[1:36:45] looking at any of that God's looking at
[1:36:47] his word God's looking to see if you can
[1:36:49] receive and respond to his word because
[1:36:53] if you're if you a if you're able to
[1:36:55] respond to the word then God's going to
[1:36:57] use you God's going to move into your
[1:36:59] life God's going to take out of your
[1:37:01] life whatever needs to be moved
[1:37:04] out I went through a complete
[1:37:08] Rehabilitation of my entire family home
[1:37:11] business life physical everything all in
[1:37:15] a very short period of
[1:37:17] time almost to the point where that's
[1:37:20] why I was so mesmerized that that I had
[1:37:23] come into into contact with something
[1:37:25] that was so much greater than anything
[1:37:27] that I could have ever
[1:37:28] done and when you truly come into a
[1:37:31] relationship with God and you just
[1:37:33] humble yourself and you wait on the Lord
[1:37:36] he'll do things in your life that you'll
[1:37:39] know for sure listen God doesn't play
[1:37:42] games I'll tell you right now amen okay
[1:37:45] Jes he does not play games he'll do it
[1:37:49] and you'll know it it's as simple as
[1:37:52] that he'll do it and you'll know it
[1:37:55] because when he's calling and he's got a
[1:37:57] work for you to do and he's got
[1:37:59] something that includes you into the

[1:41:47] Jesus's birth fit with the way he said
[1:41:51] the father always works
[1:41:53] a mustard seed is the smallest of all
[1:41:56] seeds but when it matures it becomes the
[1:41:58] largest of all garden plants did you
[1:42:00] know
[1:42:01] that so that the birds can come and
[1:42:04] nested its branches a tiny plant so that
[1:42:07] the birds can come among amount of and
[1:42:10] and a tiny amount of yeast Works its way
[1:42:13] through the whole lump of dough and the
[1:42:16] smallest Good Deed will not go unnoticed
[1:42:20] in the kingdom of God simple acts of
[1:42:24] kindness or a cup of cold water given to
[1:42:27] one in need God does things and does
[1:42:30] them beyond your expectations now he

[1:43:04] was fear not for I bring you good
[1:43:07] news this is good news this this message
[1:43:11] this Christmas message this week is good
[1:43:13] news Saints it can set you free it can
[1:43:16] liberate you it can break the chains of
[1:43:18] the enemy whatever it is that's holding
[1:43:21] you back from having the peace and the
[1:43:24] joy you know that when you when you
[1:43:26] allow yourself to move into Joy you know
[1:43:29] it takes an effort sometimes you got to
[1:43:32] break out of that that that that
[1:43:34] stubborn spirit that wants to you know
[1:43:37] wants to bring you down and you got to
[1:43:40] start speaking positive and you got to
[1:43:42] start expressing Joy I feel the joy of
[1:43:45] the Lord amen I I I I'm the luckiest
[1:43:48] person on Earth I don't care what they
[1:43:50] say about me I believe God's report
[1:43:53] God says that you are you are more
[1:43:55] precious to me that you're you're the
[1:43:57] whole all of Heaven rejoices when one of
[1:44:01] my children repents and comes to me all
[1:44:03] of Heaven rejoices that's what the
[1:44:05] scripture says why wouldn't you be the
[1:44:08] happiest person why would you allow the
[1:44:10] joy of the Lord because when the joy
[1:44:12] comes in guess what just like
[1:44:16] Superman when he gets into the
[1:44:19] sun all of a sudden the muscles start to
[1:44:22] pop boom boom boom boom boom the
[1:44:25] strength starts to come the Kryptonite
[1:44:28] is the enemy The Devil comes and tells
[1:44:31] you you're no good look it's all your
[1:44:34] fault you did this that's Kryptonite and
[1:44:37] you listen to that kryptonite all your
[1:44:39] muscles start to get weak that's why a
[1:44:42] person in fear they just melt but
[1:44:45] somebody that has the fear of
[1:44:48] God the fear of the Lord is the
[1:44:51] beginning of wisdom the Bible says
[1:44:54] you've surrendered your life it's a
[1:44:55] fearful thing you got to let go of all
[1:44:58] these things from the past yeah you do
[1:45:02] all the former things you got to let go
[1:45:04] of them that will show and prove whether
[1:45:07] you really believe that God can do
[1:45:09] something in your
[1:45:10] life you need to let go of everything so
[1:45:14] that God can be
[1:45:16] everything and that he can bring you to
[1:45:19] a place and don't worry you're not going
[1:45:21] to just be some some uh you know uh
[1:45:24] puppet for God no no when God brings you
[1:45:27] into your rightful position you become a
[1:45:30] warrior you become stronger than you
[1:45:33] ever were you you become more confident
[1:45:36] I'm not talking about Pride confidence
[1:45:38] because you humble yourself before the
[1:45:40] Lord and God will lift you up God will
[1:45:43] fight your
[1:45:44] battles the children of Israel they knew
[1:45:47] that God was on their side that's why
[1:45:49] when David went and stood before Goliath
[1:45:53] he didn't go standing there in his own
[1:45:55] Pride I can do this I can do that he
[1:45:58] turned and told Goliath very clearly you
[1:46:01] come to you come to me today and to the
[1:46:04] children of Israel with your own
[1:46:06] strength and you're 14 feet tall and
[1:46:09] your big long sword and you and you yeah
[1:46:12] you've had a lot of Victories and sure
[1:46:14] you've had a lot of Victories but you're
[1:46:15] all puffed up on yourself but you've met
[1:46:19] your challenge today Satan because I
[1:46:22] don't come to you with my own ability I
[1:46:24] got a life that I'm ashamed of as a
[1:46:26] matter of fact to be honest with you
[1:46:30] okay my past has got no strength I got
[1:46:33] no I got no victories that I can use but
[1:46:36] I come to you today in the name of the
[1:46:39] Lord God of Israel I come to you in the
[1:46:42] name of Jesus Christ Satan I don't come
[1:46:44] to you with my own ability my own power
[1:46:47] I got no ability I've got no power but
[1:46:50] I've got him on my side and in the name
[1:46:53] of Jesus Christ every knee shall bow and
[1:46:57] confess that Jesus Christ is Lord and
[1:47:00] then all of a sudden you start to notice
[1:47:02] things falling away from your life God
[1:47:04] taking this right out of your life you
[1:47:06] thought you had to go fight the battle

[1:47:36] place that we are
[1:47:38] welcome and we will tell the
[1:47:42] truth hallelujah it'll be greater than
[1:47:45] anything and there's a Great Awakening
[1:47:48] as we wind this down right now and we
[1:47:50] prepare for next week There's a great
[1:47:52] Awakening taking place right now in the

[1:48:23] big and we got to put ourselves under
[1:48:27] the right
[1:48:28] expectation so that we can catch the
[1:48:31] revelation of what he's doing amen it's
[1:48:35] all

[1:48:40] scriptures that we continue to look into
[1:48:45] as we move
[1:48:47] forward let's just go to the last couple

[1:48:58] John chapter 14 we started John 14 from
[1:49:02] verse 6 but Jesus now says believest
[1:49:06] Thou not that I am in the father and the
[1:49:09] father in
[1:49:10] me and the works that I speak unto you I
[1:49:14] speak not of myself but the father that
[1:49:17] dwelleth in me he doeth the works
[1:49:22] see Jesus had come into a
[1:49:25] realization that God was in
[1:49:30] him believe me that I am in the father
[1:49:34] and the father in me or else believe me
[1:49:37] for the very work sake he was trying to
[1:49:40] convey to them hey this is so much

[1:50:45] also about
[1:50:47] you you've got a great part to play in
[1:50:51] this great plan that I've that I've set

[1:51:02] blinded eyes he had stopped the blood
[1:51:04] issues he had calmed the sea when he
