we still bring them when they disagree [Music] [Music] [Music] and the work will always defeat all these blends oh when I love this I love when God is in his head remember back at the beginning aspire

spear that rejects the skirt you can have no conscience no feel as though sensations all these new things that has nothing to do with it so many people if you don't have faith in the word you know I try to stop to stop you another by this message the greatest battle ever fought is so precious to me in my life and then my walk with automated that way because we're always listening to this at 2:32 the Word of God what I need [Music] listen to this message it wasn't something that was spoken literally word for murder the Spirit of God he decided me and spoke and every time you spoke in my life he only speaks a few words and he said it is finished I heard that voice allowed inside me just like when I was in the Catholic Church I was kneeling down trying to seek my help in recent stuff when I was seeking God canucks on the verge of suicide and he spoke to me he says he won't find me here the same place is always spoke to me along the way and speaking to you and when I play game with that I can stand still I get my motions my feelings my memory my conscience a chance to RIA oriented everything to me I forgot those temples I went right in the back now I'm so addicted job I forgot the thing and I would prove that the club the devil camp says now he started a boy I said thus saith the Lord statement the next two weeks my condition got worse than it ever was I think they thought I was going to die seriously I was into pupae their other side was preaching the Word of God and I was shaking I kept sound was seizures as Satan all along the way you need those pills try to pull it out trying to get me to go back and a long way I'll shake like this the Lord of Light as it takes my life God I went home no word of a lie I went home that Sunday I went to bed still feeling the same way I woke up when they were no trace of feelings I know what it is where the devil is cast out of here and how much he can take this whole every aspect of your body your life and can control why did not give you that experience because of the minister who's given me and it's not going to come any other way the way it came from me I have a preacher any other way it's not going to come any other way for you that's the way it's going to come through you've got to take the Word of God you can't play around order to can't play around with this message you can't play around baggage a man can be set free to be filled with the Holy Ghost you gotta make a choice you gotta make a decision the Pope surrender of your life in your heart to God in your life and bring your subject to the Word of God other than adopted seats which would block the gladiators would be dozens when you're going to go backwards nobody wants the doc to themselves it's your mind opens up the door closes the door and this is to your conscience this is to give every listens to your fascism but when your mind closes the self to the things and that God the spirit of his word come in it the rest of the stuff out every doubt it's gone listen every fear is gone every sensation of death is gone this every feeling is gone but the Word of God and see cannot my you will the word trend on scorpion serpents it might be Halloween then it goes on to state about open up your channel clear it up your channel why so many Christians are blown up today is because they don't go and clean the channels out they don't pull down to the inside deep you've got to clean your conscious memory spots [Music] coming from the inside out with that adulterated work of God that it is the truth above state of this God too much was a surrendered heart a tender heart we undergo circumcision er hardness that because the time to be like because your sinful nature this heart technocratic transformer nation produces strength that gives you forward in all the welding times compassion create an atmosphere around you where miracles [Music] the new crisis mystery of God revealed but office mystery is revealed wealthy as he promised to his bride happened against this truth of the revelation of his mystery but the bride is standing up that's her snack amen she's standing up why do you hunger church why is the secrets to you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that's why you're like what about why I want you [Music] sometimes you hurt their results in surrender and produces a great freedom a new discussion enough spirits in a people the sequins of people felt in the upper room attached to the double eagles came upon them the Holy Ghost and opposed their lives that they changed the whole city region about them they could have never done that you seen their lives he Peters life you see all the nice before the out-group we read enough to the Bible what changed their lives after the Holy Ghost came upon them it set them free from themselves [Music] like God busted God said for the Holy Spirit and he always will if I work when I pull up here speak no because he said to me and he always will back it up why because I preach or even thought that I am that's why God's creation my dedication you want to get the point to another spear of God the Knights of bridge to be able consecrating dedicate yourself you want to try up and die both do it feed all the things of the world it's not because of that God confirms his murder but he speaks into your hearts and changes your life he wants to change somebody's life this word I don't know who it is maybe a lot of people he was to change your life your circumstance for situations when he's given you instructions in the world you've got to take the word got yourself into your heart in a way so that you may know that God is field that you may know that what he's spoken about you you know that he said before waiting all this mistakes God still for what he said but God came in almost yes woman in my life if I don't see it happening here or the time but if I will be to the Word of God I see it there I see it for my situation my shirt my bike my bike areas with the

about there are different types of surrender we talk about that that they met the goal of Christian life to some public places to 20 I have been crucified with Christ it is no longer I who live but Christ who lives in me in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me something like a surrender is pleasing to God it results in great human fulfillment 22 he wasn't for use in his church that he died for he was able to achieve by working in the church [Music] they reveal to you until it comes into manifestation and then we'll speak for it thank you that's the brief manifestation right this is up there's so much right to stay let me just find something here to close off come back [Music] power that brought it up for the first place he's just on the rooftop taking it back now he's

certain date the bride of Jesus Christ I was back to God because she came from God that actually critical part of God and never needed Satan but he saved us from a life of sin he saved us from the troubled life a troubled mind the trouble of heart trouble situations in our family he saved us but we need to accept remember that story apartment is not part of the less accepting as a partner a person died under the fire of goods perhaps made because he didn't believe that the part that was given to him was from Abraham Lincoln and he died absolutely still Hartman is not party unless it's accepted as a party your limits your salvation their bodies everything you have beena it's not there unless it's accepted in your heart he can do in your life but it will not perform in your life it will not take place in your life unless you open up your heart and it's haven't you continue to believe that was longer stop for you just understand God has placed the word in a certain time of season

heart I've seen your work come through - of the Spartan my grace not my inspiration but yours so I prayed with all my heart for the people again today Lord and I I prayed with the faith that you have given me in the name of Jesus Christ let it be done as has been spoken that God haven't performed the work in their lives let the hearts be stronger than you let the eyes be changed in transporter and lock the bodies we had changed as he was walking as they want for this place today as they walked into there [Music] in the name of Jesus Christ science letter to their house let me follow your word this morning father by the power of Satan Satan you've got no right back to the cross of Calvary I sacrifice my Savior overcoming you in the garden Yosemite and I say God you can't call the people deep in the bus love the people the name of Jesus Christ every worthy spirit every spirit of perversion knows the people the name of Jesus Christ and set them free for the Son of Man our God set free is free indeed bless their hearts for now that could be like and never doubt the word of God but believe that were God said not bad but God said he's more than able to perform less than now Jesus name
