of the day setting on the sun see people think of church and of God the sun setting you realize your Sun is setting in the cool of the evening that's when God comes down to have fellowship with his Saints that's why when we come together like this we should enter into Fellowship by the grace of the Living God hallelujah another purpose of God is to make you a coworker with him Hallelujah he says because the Holy Ghost has come down to hunt his bride evening time evangelism is going on right now right do you believe that praise God he tells it in many stories he talks about the eagle who lost

every minute of your day is supposed to be in a super glory to God hallelujah amen so David is brother sisters that God's purpose is to make us what co-workers with him that we might witness and win his Bri back to himself praise the Lord I believe that even can evangelism is going on right now until the last one comes in amen he's hunting for his pride and there's billions and billions of lost people out there that he's got to search TR to find his own amen yes praise God he's the same yesterday today and forever there's a thirst and a hungering for lost soul that's what's the matter with the meetings today there is not enough Spirit touch in it go for the souls of the Lost and the D amen it's more to have meetings so they can have a name or they can build up their church or build up a building or build up a denomination instead of setting in place our soul willing program we believe that we believe to have a soul buing program in this church you believe that all the tools that God provide us from Bo of God or wherever else the CDs uh that we can begin to use it all the beautiful booklets that people are uh giving their hard earned money and donating for it to be there that we should be using it and that all you going to have to do is Hey listen there's something in the rest I want to listen to this and just give him a CD and then make sure you go back a week later don't rush back by the next day what you think what you think and breathing down their neck or something like that but that you should actually talk to them amen give them a breathing space Sometimes some of them will call you back before you call them because if the hunger and thirst is in there they going to call you back amen amen give them a booklet praise the Lord hallelujah oh my I I always tell this story and all the older Believers here know the story and this is a story um of this man that was on the ship and uh the ship was going along and as it was going along uh he came out he had a impediment of speech and then he came out just in time to see the Ship Rock and the the cook had some be that he was about you know potatoes and stuff he was about to thr over the side of the ship and just as he's about to thr it over the side the ship shook you know and the cook fell overboard the cook fell overboard so he ran excited to the captain and he ran to the captain he said oh c come on speak up man say speak up what is it you want to say he said so finally the captain get frustrated said listen speak up or S up or something I don't have all day so he couldn't speak up but he could sing may all acquaintance be forgotten and never brought to mind the good old Fook fell off the ship about a mile my God I know you're telling me see but at least he sung up praise the Lord so what I'm telling you here by using that is if you feel you have the courage to speaking up to somebody and testifying about the of God you can at least give them a CD you can at least give them a booklet we have beautiful booklets from who is God who is Jesus uh what happened in the garden amen the Lord if you can't talk it then at least give somebody and make sure you follow up don't just give them and walk away praise the Lord follow up on it and when you do that you're going to see what's you going to start getting fruit for whatever you do like that and if you do it purposefully and you do it deliberately and you're expecting to receive a crop because you saw seed you are going to have a crop but you must act upon the word if you want to see the miracles of god amen hallelujah amen I know this is about what the purpose of the Holy Ghost is and what the Holy Ghost was given for is to make you into a witness is to make you into a coworker so that you can bring others to Jesus Christ and that's why we are here because we are doing what we are hunting God's bride we're hunting her wherever she is amen amen where is she she's out in the denominations and some of them are still right in the message claiming they believe the message but they Haven come Revelation come out of all my people and be not partakers of our PL come out of all the unbelief praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen make you into a coworker that's what the purpose of the Holy Ghost is the purpose of the holy spirit is to bring you into a place of adoption a place of complete adoption now you come in the message and you're hearing it you're receiving it and some of us from the first day second day first month third month fine but you can be in it for years but you're not fully adopted because you haven't fully caught the revelation of the word and got filled with the Holy Ghost filled with the holy spirit amen where he controls your life amen completely and does something for the glory of God within you praise His name amen glory to God hallelujah so brother Bram speaks about adoption he said now adoption is that this son is already knowing it's a child it's born to the father amen you're in the message you got it you here you are to the father you believe that God is your father and C the Revelation but here is the son he says but when the son comes in or comes the father is going to watch that son to see how he's behaving with his business right because slowly slowly the father is going to start to kind of ease up to push that business into his son's hands and he's going to watch how his son behaves with that business right he said now if he's a bad son then that son is not going to pay attention and that son is not going to do what he's suppos to do amen but he says when he watches the Sun and see the son is taking care and his business is running right then what happens he's going to bring that son in and then give him the rights to sign the checks just as much as he can sign the check amen and he's going to give him power to hire and fire and to administrate the entire EST amen amen praise the name of the Lord that is what God does with the people when they come in message he watches at every one of us to see us grow in Grace and then when you get to a certain place all of a sudden he starts to pour down His blessings upon you pour down anointing on you begin to flow through you in a special way that people will recognize you are not just a Christian you are an adopted Christian you're a place child of God hallu hallelu daughter rep bless son amen there something different amen thank you Lord why because we're operating on a high G the holy spirit of God FL through your life for his glory father praise the name of the Lord glory to God Hallelujah to be honest the holy spirit makes the service just the way it is for some reason amen for some reason for his own purpose glory to God I tell you friends that the holy Holy Spirit has his reason why he came into our lives another purpose is he come into our lives to prepare for his prepare us for his coming he come to us to prepare us for his coming for the glory and praise of God Amen on page 52 of this what is the Holy Ghost given for uh sorry sorry page uh 16 paragraph 5 52 14 paragraph 52 brother Bron speaks here listen to you amen now see the adoption come and God begins to pour into us his fullness his power his resurrection and when the church in Christ become so close together till Christ becomes visible Among Us amen become visible Among Us and begins to even raise the dead and then we go into the Rapture praise the Lord hallelujah just those that are filled with the Holy Ghost will go in that rapture amen but can you believe that the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead and quickened him will begin to Quicken us to such a point that you are going to be laying hands on the sick even on those that are dead and that they would recover and the dead will come to life again this is what he's saying as it gets close to the Rapture the quickening power will be so much upon the adopted Sons and Daughters of God that Christ will be made flesh visible before us even with the raising of the Dead does he mean that Jesus will appear visibly Among Us or does he uh is he saying that the holy spirit will come into the lights of some Believers so real amen that they are actually like his flesh and the dead will be raised up for the glory of God hallelujah now let me start to wind this up praise God the Holy Ghost also come to give you power amen power brothers and sisters over Satan power against over the world power over your habits power over your uh life in every way amen life power to overcome by the grace of God he promised that he would give us that power against unclean spirits praise the Lord hallelujah it's that's the way it is you will find that when the Holy Ghost really starts taking over your life not only good people will be attracted to you but actually demon powers will be attracted to you because you're you become a light a light in the Supernatural World Hallelujah and just like when you put a lamp you know in the in the country or up north you go put a lamp it's the worst thing you can do in the middle of a place where you got mosquitoes and bus and all kinds of stuff you know what they all coming towards that light is that right and then you wonder why you have all these chest and trials but any all the bugs are coming towards that light amen is that right so what happens is that I'm talking about satanic Powers demon powers they're attracted to a life anointed by the holy spirit amen and many times when some of them come to you like that is they're crying for help because that person wants to be free from that habit or from that devil they'll come out to the blue you don't even know them and they say oh how you doing you just start ordering conversation and they'll start to go into man I don't know what happened I have this bad thing you know and I can't overcome it and I don't know what to do it's literally that spirit and that person is calling out to you and asking you to deliver and bring them into a state of Deliverance and it doesn't called for you to lay your hands on the person or and go into a real um what we think is a Deliverance Prayer oh God In The Name of Jesus and then the person going to be delivered no many times brother Grand say God bless you Sister amen thank God bless you brother may the Lord help you and deliver you from that thing amen just like that praise the Lord because it's not you doing it it's him doing it I'm not saying we're not going to get emotional from time to time but it's not the emotion it's who you are in Christ praise the name of the Lord amen what's the difference when a cop is on the street and he doesn't even open his mouth and he just does he didn't shout he screamed to the top of his voice he just stop right there I said you obey because of not the S of his voice but who he is and the Devils obey you because of who you are praise the Lord so you must understand that and begin to exercise your Authority hallelujah praise the Lord this message is just an introduction I will continue to speak along these lines honestly honestly I I I thought today's service the Holy Spirit would move in a different way than he's moving now but in instead of that he's just brought deid into a place where for you to just listen and and hear the word that's fine with me praise the Lord but the fact is brother and sister I want to understand God is wanting to get us now to a place where you individually as the members of this congregation begin to act on the word that you've been receiving all these years time we act on the word hallelujah you don't want to have a child in the house when they turn 14 20 and we still can't walk I know how I say things sometimes some funny he's telling you the truth is that right it's the same thing spiritually speaking you want the children to walk you want them to talk and you want them to exercise Authority praise the Lord if you're not home you want them to say no you can't come in here this is my father's house this is mine even I mean even what what you call him even the dog in the house that you just feed as your pet would not allow just anybody to walk in your house keep a l of noise and everything else and we are the children of God don't just let us allow the devil to run rush oh yes but to wake up and recognize who you are amen and I want you also not to back away this is what I'm trying to get you to do talk acknowledge the Pentecostal blessing acknowledge the Holy Ghost and walk right into the power and presence of the Holy Spirit and not to walk away from it and to be afraid of the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is here to quitting us back to the word I'm closing you see when brother Bram came under the inspiration of Malachi 4:5 every messenger came and had to change to be in the junction of time to change the age Paul was there to changed the Jewish Believers and all the people from law to Grace amen is that right and if you listen to all the Epistles much of what he talk about is Grace by Grace already say the grace of God God rich in Mercy and you know is to change the people from law to Grace and every subsequent messenger his job was to change the people from the spirit of the age before to the age that's coming is that right so what has happened is that to break or chop the people away from the Lutheran age then what happen Wesley and the Methodist had to point out a lot of the misgiving in the Lutheran [Music] that Luther was still smoken that Luther still hated Jews even though he was a messenger used for justification and stuff of that nature uh he had a lot of flaws is that right and and so he had to point those things out to chop the people away from that age to follow his message but what has what happened he wasn't telling them to get rid of justification no they were supposed to accept justif tion which was the Prime part of Luther's message but all the other things they had to leave that behind so when brother BR G he began to stress and hit tell it's not the evidence of the Holy Ghost then he start say hereit Pentecost amen Pentecostal buzs now he wasn't talking of the original Pentecost of Paul and them that's not what he was talking about but people in this message just take this overall idea that every Pentecost everything Pentecostal is of the devil and it's not of God and it's not of the age and they pushed aside everything Pentecostal until that when you act preach or talk or the Holy Ghost genuinely comes into a service they're scared of it or they don't want it is that right amen I've been in Services where I'm preaching the Holy Ghost come down and the preacher tells me oh I was so scared I feel chills go up my spine I amen I've been into other services where people in the message for many years and they they never had anything to do with the genuine holy spirit amen all they got is a word word word and they and they felt that up to that point and I'm okay amen they didn't realize that you got to let that word carry you into an experience with God Amen Hallelujah said I know that I know amen amen praise God it's got to take you experience and away from just having it a mental fit of believing the message to actual quickening power in your life amen where you're acting on the word and seeing God moving in your hearts and your minds praise the Lord don't might you can start coming up here this is a nice uh quiet service here today but come on up let's give God the praise am but I'm glad I can say I'm one of them I trying to do I'm not one of those Messengers but I'm trying to turn a corner with new the Bible says that a lot of the people were Jews but they knew not Joseph is that right people in the message talking about the prophet they're showing the videos of the prophet praying for the sick and all this kinds of stuff and they hear about those great meetings and you can tell the stories over and over but they themselves were never in a meeting like that they were never in a meeting like that where the Holy Spirit comes down and take control of the congregation and God receives the glory some of you have a taste of it here from time to time but the point of it is they don't know anything about that all they know is about the Prophet The Prophet the message the prophet and that's good that's very good it's good we watch the videos while we want to be in the next set of videos they making for them that come tribulation is that right we want to be in those videos praise the Lord because they need to you need to recognize that we genuinely serve a living God I I can't stress it enough because he a spirit and you come in the air and we just preaching and song that we just talking and you don't see nobody else but from time to time when he chooses the Bible says the angel of the Lord came down put his toe and Trouble the waters is that right Book of Revelation says the waters is the people amen sometime from time God is going to trouble the waters and some of you going to act beside yourself is that right you're going to act beside yourself that's not me yes you're right it's not you the Holy Ghost praise the Lord you do something you expect you want to do you s you shout you you praise God I don't care how it comes out but you act upon the word and let God have his way within your life too much of this spiritual regression calling and binding people where they can't really allow the Holy Ghost to express itself through you one woman come to brother after Ser said brother BR why you were preaching she said I felt so happy and the Lord I felt like getting out in the AIS and dancing in the spirit of God hallelujah amen why didn't you do it why didn't you do it if you didn't I will be the next one down there with you says you got to obey the word amen hallelujah praise the Lord let me stress it again fair and pride of how you look is what influences most of us from really expressing when the Holy Ghost comes upon you in the middle of a service like this and you hear the word and you're supposed to Rejoice or amen or shout or do something to express that you got it instead you hold it you swallow it and make sure that you act appropriately and most dignifi the proper etiquet but the Holy Ghost is not here for that that's right the Holy Ghost is here to control our lives and make us into what he wants us to be and that's what it talks about dying to yourself you got to die out to yourself we not all of us here not that to ourselves yet amen we you don't really care I don't care what happened to the person next to me I'm concerned with what he's doing in my life praise the Lord and then you going to lose a lot of your mental health [Music] issues why do you think the government likes to have churches you think they're foolish they know that churches even the false ones that by some people by people going into churches and sitting there even for half an hour they lose a lot of their mental health issues psychiatric problems health professionals know that those kinds of things start to drift off people [Music] amen so there are natural benefits and then there are the supernatural benefits so make sure you're in the house of God and in the Church of God and when you come in here you going to have a battle how many of you know how many of you are battling today raise up your hands don't asame you were battling I know you were battling because I was about and I knew that while I was preaching the word the devil was trying to take me to the land of n amen but he can't stop the word of God from getting to your heart and that's why I made the remark I taught the Holy Spirit service would go a certain way but it went another way because I know I'm I'm here right sometimes I sense it other times I can see it amen no matter how you disguise it and try to you know there is not too big for you to put it so that the I will open so [Music] you so praise the Lord hallelujah well I know a preacher friend of mine powerful preacher well known in the United States in high places and him and I used to hang out together and what happened went to his local church and they were fixing the windows on the church um there several windows and it wasn't finished so they nailed up as we call it in the west zinc sheets right all these you may know what they are do Z sheets nail them up there just to block the windows so that you know people will come in and the rain will come in so the preacher is preaching and the preacher is preaching and he's sitting there he says John I was listening to that sermon I don't know when I fell asleep but my head just went hit that sheet and the the sound reverberate through the entire church he says but the presence of mine that my head came back up fast and I was looking around to see who so that they wouldn't know who actually had [Music] that amen and that's what happens everybody is trying to make sure that they act like they're not sleeping I am not the one falling asleep and to make sure that nobody finds them out or discovers this it's human amen praise the Lord but God knows I understand I'm not give you Liberty to fall asleep but I'm I'm just let you know that God understand and he knows everything about us but God wants every one of us to know turning a corner we need to know Joseph for ourselves am is that right not in the voice of God not in the CDs not by the Visions not by the stories but you has to make it your story where you can say this is my story this is my song I'm praising My Savior all the day long God bless you I don't know how this seron will bless you but I trust that it will bless
