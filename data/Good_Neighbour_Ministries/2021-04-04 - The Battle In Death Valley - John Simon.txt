TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] happy easter to one and all everywhere wherever you are in this world watching this broadcast listening to the word of god i wish you a happy easter with all its meaning significance and blessings that flows from it may god bless you wherever you are on this easter day this day of the resurrection of our lord jesus christ i would uh speak to you on this subject of the battle in death valley and my scriptures are found in psalms 23 verse 4 followed by first peter chapter 3 verses 18 to 20 i will commence our reading yay though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me in first peter chapter 3 verses 18 to 20. for christ also had once suffered for our sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to god being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison which sometime were disobedient when once the long-suffering of god waited in the days of noah while the ark was a preparing wherein few that is eight souls were saved by water let us pray gracious heavenly father we thank thee for another glorious easter morn we thank you by the lilies by the side of the way we thank you lord jesus for the sunshine bright we thank you for the robins with their red breasts oh dipped in the blood of christ we thank you for the love of god that is shed abroad within our hearts by the blessed holy spirit and we have come today lord to lift up our hearts lift up our entire being to thee to receive thy word bless us bless all who hear the word near and far all predestinated to receive this word near and far to thee be the glory on the honor for we ask this all in the name of our lord jesus christ amen thank god friends it was easter time 2 000 years ago in the hills of judea when this great battle took place this battle in that valley and i'm not speaking of death valley in the united states i am not speaking of death valley valley of death in egypt i'm speaking of what david the prophet spoke of when he said yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death he was walking through the valley of shadow of death i'm speaking of the battle where jesus christ fought against satan in the pits of hell the valley of death and there was a great battle that was fought that great war started in heaven when the lucifer and his angels fought against michael the great epic battle when he was kicked out from heaven oh the bible records saw satan fall like lightning fall from heaven he was kicked out of heaven down to earth and since then then his entire ambitions is to turn earth into a hell on earth and so this battle was not a short battle it's been a long-standing running war from come down from heaven in the earth through the ages of time right to calvary and then at last our redeemer jesus christ came up on the scene then this battle took place two thousand years ago the battle between jesus christ and satan for the souls of the of man righteous men and women who had given their lives over in faith to god so the price was for the souls of the righteous dead the proponents the the actors the generals words jesus christ versus satan for the souls of those who had believed in him we know this is of course was a historic and epic battle for the patriarchs and the prophets and many other holy men and women who had put their faith in messiah waiting for the coming of the lord and died in faith as the bible says believing unto eternal life believing unto the coming of the lamb of god believing unto their perfect redemption by the blood of that dying bleeding lamb that was to come in their day they look forward in faith with great expectation to the coming of the lord jesus christ that the true lamb not an animal sacrifice but the true lamb not the type or the shadow but the true lamb in reality the lamb of god that taketh away the sins of the world would come and diver for the sins of man and so the bible records these all died in faith you see there we're looking forward to his coming but now in our day we are looking backwards back to calvary back to golgotha's hill back to the shed blood from the cross of jesus christ looking back to the finnish work of god that was accomplished at calvary i'd like to bring your attention to a prominent line found in the apostles creed a part of it which says he descended into hell but then on the third day he rose again thanks be unto our god yes he descended into a hell he descended into death's valley where satan held his prison house we repeat first peter 3 18 20 where it says he descended and preached unto the spirits that were in prison now we already now we have with us a clear picture that what had happened is that in this great epic battle it was fought from gethsemane where he swept drops of blood took calvary where the thunder roll the lightning flash the midday sun was blotted out darkness covered the land the earth quaked and shook for the battle was raging and jesus the bible says descended into hell now on the cross they may think well it's over his his spirit his soul left his body and that was the end of it but the bible is telling us the rest of the story he descended into hell he descended into death's valley he descended into satan's prison house now you may find quotations on this israel and the church paragraph 115 to 18 uh paragraph 118 expectations paragraph 18 to 22 demonology uh 201 to the 212 the entw meant uh there you'll find that paragraph 99 and the patriarch abraham 1964 paragraph 61-62 that is just for you if you wanted to go back and study this but we know according to scripture that when jesus left his body hanging on the cross he descended into satan's prison house i believe he was alluding to this when he said how can one go into a strong man's house and take out his goods unless he be stronger than him and now we read the scriptures how he went and preached to the spirits that were in satan's prison house now let me give you some understanding of satan's prison house it's easter time it's time for another prison break a jailbreak time where we'll see how jesus went into satan's prison and took out the prisoners for the glory of god now satan's prison quickly briefly was set up in such a way with two sections one section held the unrighteous dead we may call it while we are here on earth the fifth dimension the regions of the lost hell it is sheol the place where satan has made his headquarters the unjust are there howling demons are there and satan's domain his headquarters is in the pits of hell we read in the book of revelation how apollyon which is another name for satan and how out of the pit came out thousands of demons you see his headquarters are in is in the pit of hell now as i said two sections one section he also the unjust dead spirits of evil men and women holding satan's and his demons and the very place of his headquarters now the next part section two was called paradise also better known as abraham's bosom in it with a righteous dead those who died in faith looking forward to the coming of jesus christ the great messiah certainly my friends now we understand that was only a temporary place and since jesus has died for our sins it has been done away after the shedding of the blood and the freeing of the captives no use paradise as we speak of it is no more but was only a temporary place because jesus emptied it of all the captives that were in it and so we understand that the doctrine of purgatory and the doctrine of praying to saints that are held in paradise or whatever it's unscriptural and it is ungodly it is contrary to the word of god my friends i can see jesus when he went down into hell i can see him when he knocked on hell's door my my god take of it down there he crawled out died at calvary descended into that valley knocked on its door and my friends when he got down there people were wailing many people have dreamt that many people have been caught up into nightmares and they have literally had visions of hell and heard the spirits and souls of lost men and women howling screaming crying with the most of fearsome cries in the midst of it and they were carrying on screaming and jesus must have said you ought to have listened to those prophets why did you not listen to enoch in the time of noah you had enoch you could have listened to him but instead you rejected the word of god you had moses you did not listen to him you turned away from him oh my and so he walked up knocked on that valley's door the door opened and there stood satan with his hooded eyes oh he said so you're here now oh you finally got here i thought i had you when i killed abel i thought i really had you when i killed moses and another time i thought i really got you when i killed you john the baptist i thought i had you for sure but now you have come down here voluntarily into my possession i'm going to hang on to you but i can hear jesus say satan i am the virgin-born son of god hallelujah i come from the ivory palaces above and i come to earth and i'm come down here to death valley because my blood has baited the entire earth for the forgiveness of their sins i paid the entire price i paid the complete price for their redemption and hell so give me those keys and with that he stepped forward and grabbed the keys from off satan the jail housekeeper took away the keys from him hallelujah and said to him i'm taking over now you kept them people here in bondage then one set in section one they're yours but these in section two these righteous dead who live for me and long for me believed the word for me and had confidence in me look forward to my coming now i am here and i have come for them so give me them keys of death and hell and of the grave amen you kept the people in bondage you kept them in fear and everything else but now i take this these keys from you amen and you know he must have just pushed satan aside moved him out out in front of him amen praise god what was it he was the mighty conqueror the mighty conqueror that rent the veil into and now we can look and behold him in plain view thank god that mighty conqueror rolls on easter morning saying i am he that was dead and is alive again and i am alive forevermore and have the keys of death and hell hallelujah and he that heareth my words and believe it in him that set me i raise him up in the last days glory to god hallelujah oh my oh praise god he walked down into hell and there he heard the cries i have said of those in section one on one side but then he went a little lower where satan kept a lot of the saints so they could never escape and while he was walking down the stairs he heard shouting he heard singing it seems like if there was some kind of a jubilee revival meeting going on and shouting going on in a meeting down there and when he turned the corner there was abraham there was sarah there was rebecca there was isaac there was he war jeremiah isaiah oh my ezekiel all the prophets jumping praising god giving god the glory because hallelujah the comforter had come redemption redemption have come the redeemer is here the savior is here the lion and the lamb of the tribe of judah is here oh praise god the wheel in the middle of the wheel is here glory to god hallelujah amen so he knocks on that door and somebody says who's that and abraham opens up the door being the most senior he opens up the door and he says oh my here is the seed my seed the seed of abraham here he is the root and offspring of david oh isaiah said oh he is the great and mighty one hallelujah danielle said he is the stone i saw cut out from the mountain without hands praise god hallelujah amen and jesus said now quiet quiet listen to me you believed in me amen in the times when the goat's blood and heifer's blood could not even take away your sins it only covered your sins but this blood my blood will wash your sins away and completely redeem you and remove your sins far from you from the eastest from the west and put it away forever and ever and now i've come for you to take you out of here it's going home time i'm gonna take you home now oh my listen brother branham speaking he says i can hear abraham say lord can we take a little stop as we go through jerusalem i want to look the old city over i haven't seen it for some time amen and some of the others came also and said lord we want to make a stop uh just see the city amen and i listen prophet speaking i can hear jesus say i've got some things to talk over with my disciples and it will take me about 40 days and so take that time and go and look over the city look around the country amen hallelujah as matthew 27 tells us how on easter morning he rose from the grave and the scripture records many of the saints that slept in the dust of the earth rose out of the grave and came out walked in the streets and appeared to many i can see cahifus going to the synagogue holding his eastern garments the robes of the high priest as he walks in the streets and when he looks he sees abraham and sarah as young people walking down the streets looking over the city and somehow they seem familiar to the same those people somewhere i wonder who they are and while he was looking at them and thinking about it that disappeared from his sight just like jesus how jesus went through the wall the same kind of glorified body they had amen or praise god and they were able to appear and disappear with that glorified body amen praise god hallelujah oh glory to god and the bible says he ascended up into heaven and went up together with them read in the book of psalms and you will read where it tells you when the lord approaches the gates of heaven and what they were saying who is this lord of glory and then he answers the lord mighty and battle the lord mighty to save glory to god hallelujah why he had taken out satan's prison house he had created a a jailbreak and the people of all the saints of all the ages that believed upon him trusted in him had an easter time because the lord jesus brought them out with him praise god hallelujah my brothers and sisters listen my dear christian friends demons are working on every hand but god's spirit is also moving on every hand to contract everything that satan does hallelujah do you believe that i believe it amen there you are we see newspapers magazines everything else declaring it and we are watching with spiritual's eyes they can't see it but we can recognize our day the message for our day the darkness of the hour and the coming of the morning sun lord of god it's the great time we're coming to a showdown amen we're coming to another showdown brother sister it's coming here pretty soon between god and the devil oh praise god if you listen to this service here today let me encourage you get on the lord's side choose whom you will serve get on jesus side amen praise god forevermore let us give him all the glory and the praise on the honor hallelujah and he left captivity captive the bible said he left captivity captive back into the hip a heavens you see they were in satan's captivity and he took them out so now he leads those who were in captivity he takes them captive of himself the word and it takes them back with him into the heavens glory be to god hallelujah my friends that was jesus back there the battle is not ended since that time of the clean out and the ransacking of the valley of death more sins sinners evildoers the wicked unclean lascavious contrary rebellious heretical against the word and promise of god's war day and time that we are living in and so my friends this world that we live in is like a hell on earth and we as believers who has christ in us he is here again the same yesterday today and forever and what he did in death valley this is what we are supposed to do in this valley that we are in to deliver the lost to deliver those that are bound to set them that are free and i'm sure that when he had or finished that battle with satan satan knew who he was satan had no doubt who was his master who was this mighty one he knew who he was hallelujah i'm telling you friends it's important that this world comes to know who we are that we are the sons of god oh we washed our robes in the crimson fountain and now we are the sons of god it's very important that they begin to recognize who we are it's important for the devil to know that you are not a loser he thought jesus was a loser on that cross but he was not a loser he was a winner glory to god you are not a loser no matter what you're going through your little calvary your little problem your your situations you might be going through oh glory to god hallelujah but now you've come amen to take back your life you'll come to take back your son you'll come to take back your daughter you come to take back the conditions that are out there amen he descended into hell he descended into death valley amen and the battle in death valley goes on even now but now it's between the body of christ and satan it's between the elected seed of god and the satanic powers the evil the darkness that is in the world here today we are not losers we are champions amen we are more than conquerors through him that loved us the bible says you are kings you didn't know it but you are not a nobody you're a somebody you're a queen in the eyes of god you're a king in the eyes of the living god hallelujah more than that you are the lamb's wife praise god forevermore hallelujah i tell you friends if we could get a real revelation of who we really are we'd be like them apostles like david said we'll be able to jump over walls praise god run through a troop unlike these apostles will be able to shake the world and change the world change my home change the city change my workplace change my tongue and turn the world upside down for the glory of god let me tell you something you count you're great in the eyes of god you're wonderful and god has invested his best which is his blood his life in you and i that is god's investment in us hallelujah and i know we've got what it takes to take the world for christ to call out elected wherever they are across this world glory to god my friends when you face the devil you don't have to be afraid for the one who overcame him in that valley in hell that one lives in you today and you are coming in his name and with his authority resurrection power is in you holy ghost dunamis is in you explosive atomic powers of god dwell within your soul to break and bust any wreck any work of satan amen and set captives free for god's glory and honor hallelujah you don't have to worry you don't have to fret you just take your stance upon the fullness of the word of the living god amen glory to god hallelujah yes sir let me tell you my brothers and sisters amen why should we fair we got the name of jesus amen we were baptized in the name of jesus we're filled with the holy spirit our lambs trimmed and clear oh praise god we have the power to rebuke and the devil deaf dumb blind sick whatever kind of devil it is possessed insane people praise god we have the authority to do it for we know at the name of jesus every knee shall bow every town shall confess oh that jesus christ indeed is lord hallelujah praise god oh my praise god let's look back let's look back into that valley let's look down into hell what do we see we're looking down the corridors of time and we are seeing like there are a parade grounds in hell and what do we see a barracks like on every side and suddenly alarm bells go off bells begin ringing and here come demons running out of those places buckling on their belts putting on their uniforms and getting ready for for battle and they all lined up on the upper right ground in hell and here comes lucifer satan with a knitted brow and a skull on his face something was wrong what something was wrong because he was nervous and he was he just couldn't stand still and he was jumpy and his heart was something and carrying on he was so worried you see and he they said what happened what happened my lord what happened to you and he said well there's a great attack being mounted against the kingdom of hell a great attack is taking place against this kingdom of hell and he goes marching across that parade ground like that and faces 250 000 deemed dark demons that worth all around there yes sir and he looks them everyone and he said we have a condition read we have an extreme emergency at this time and i need every demon here to be strictly on duty and to put himself in the heat of battle because listen we're gonna have to fight to the death because they're coming again they're coming again one of those demons catches his breath and fearfully he comes forward and says oh lord of lies what is happening what is really going on and then satan turns to him and said let me tell you in a certain city in a certain little town that's over there yes right there the uh in a little church there oh my the word of god has been preached in the power of the resurrection and a revival seems to have broken out in that town in that city broken out they had a meeting in a church there and that the holy ghost fell and all them people that came to hear the word of the living god and today people from that meeting they didn't stay in the church their church was over they're out they're back on their jobs they're back to school they're back wherever they come from to their homes and they're walking down everywhere and when they walk the thing about it is something supernatural happened there it's got to be a move of god because it seems like they're radiating something coming out to them looks like a light looks like there's life and light coming out of them when they're walking around that they're different they look like a new creation and they're walking different they're talking different they're more positive they are more certain they're they're walking they're full of love and authority like that then they're on fire for the living god if we don't do something i'm telling you there's gonna break out of even a bigger move in that city in that home in that church in that person's life we got and stop them wherever they are because what that something that is radiating out of them i believe that was the same something that was in the bush that spoke to moses i believe it's the same i am that spoke to moses in the burning bush of fire oh praise god hallelujah amen oh we better do something fast or something is going to take place and we're going to have a a bigger mess than we ever thought going on before oh my and at his word 250 000 demons from the underworld coming out pouring out like a swarm of flies or better as like a swarm of black bats coming out from the pits of hell oh trying to latch themselves onto whoever that's the way demons do then to anyone they can find living on clean lying cheating stealing oh all my friends committing all kinds of acts and habits against them those backlight demons ready to hold on and take that person's life spiritually speaking pouring out swarms of them amen to cover that entire city or town to one attack that church that has that great move of god to attack the believers protect the followers of the message of this hour and of the word of god hallelujah amen oh my oh i tell you some believers well maybe some are a little scared maybe some got a little worried some maybe think this is getting a little too much and they're getting fearful and beginning to wonder oh praise god but let's shift the scene a little bit here brother sister let's lift shift the scene and look up to glory hallelujah and we see another kind of a parade ground there hallelujah alarm bells are going off there too there is an emergency taking place and here we find 250 000 angels of god hallelujah pouring out of their barracks if they have one but they were pouring out everywhere brother sisters and jesus walks out before them why he is our five star general j e s u s amen and harry comes stand in front of them and says we have a condition red it's an emergency and i need you believers you angels to go and drive back every swarm of the devil and kick him out just the way i kicked him out of hell i want you to kick him out of every situation and stomp on him and rise up and say with confidence i am more than a conqueror through him that love me for christ in me is my hope of glory in his name in my name and in his name we cast out devils as we believe the word of the living god hallelujah praise god amen oh my there are believers walking down the streets walking in their homes praying in church some of them are young people they're walking down the hallways of their high schools and the devil doesn't like what he sees and he got so fearful he got so nervous that he called out 250 000 of his demons to go and fight against those believers we are not going to let that happen in that way we are going to straighten them we are going down to give them supernatural invisible aid we are going to be like guardian angels to them and we are going to be there and let's go fight against the devil with everything that we have got to that we have amen let's go and protect that church let's go protect that home let's go protect that man that woman that young person at their high school uh let let's go protect those believers on their jobs oh against the evil that is in the world today that surrounds them everywhere and all at once the heavens opened and angels began to pour out amen and as they poured out the holy ghost poured out with them and in the front visibly now taking the charge here comes the white horse rider amen his name is the word of god better known as our lord and savior jesus christ and the white horse rider comes on the scene along with the believers may i say it that battle is raging now that battle is going on now we fight against the world the flesh and the devil
