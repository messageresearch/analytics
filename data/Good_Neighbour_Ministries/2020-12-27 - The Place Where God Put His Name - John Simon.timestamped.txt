[0:00] [Music]
[0:15] with joy
[0:16] i come before you it's wonderful to be
[0:20] here in the house of the lord with
[0:23] you the saints of god
[0:27] believers in christ and with
[0:30] people everywhere may the lord richly
[0:33] bless you last week
[0:36] we were able to witness
[0:39] the conjunction of the
[0:43] two stars in the heavens
[0:47] and of course we recognize that symbol
[0:50] not to be three stars as it was
[0:54] at the birth of jesus christ
[0:57] the headship or the head of the body
[1:00] but now two stars
[1:05] joined together an invisible union
[1:09] the head coming to the body
[1:13] i and my father are one
[1:16] thank god and so now we see that
[1:20] wonderful holy conjunction
[1:23] being showed are displayed in the
[1:27] heavens
[1:28] while god is doing it upon the earth
[1:32] and we thank him for it but now
[1:37] that is that phenomenon is over
[1:41] and here we are
[1:45] this sunday looking to the lord
[1:50] for help from above from
[1:53] manna from heaven and we want to
[1:57] we would remind you
[2:01] that we spoke some time ago
[2:05] on the twins
[2:09] of the end time revival
[2:12] twins of the end time revival
[2:15] i'm going to pray as we
[2:18] read the word of god and then we'll go
[2:22] into our message for today
[2:27] the place where god put his name
[2:31] now let us read out of the word of god
[2:34] deuteronomy chapter 16
[2:39] verses 2 and we will read
[2:43] to verse 6.
[2:48] thou shalt eat no leavened
[2:52] bread
[2:56] with it seven days shalt thou
[3:00] eat unleavened bread therewith
[3:04] even the bread of affliction for thou
[3:07] camest forth out of the land
[3:11] of egypt in haste
[3:15] that thou mayest remember the day
[3:19] when thou comest forth out of the land
[3:22] of egypt
[3:24] all the days of thy life
[3:28] and there shall be no unleavened
[3:31] bread seen with thee in
[3:34] all thy coast seven days
[3:39] neither shall there anything of the
[3:43] flesh
[3:44] which thou sacrifices the first day of
[3:48] evening remain all night
[3:52] until the morning thou mayest not
[3:55] sacrifice the passover
[3:58] within any of thy gates
[4:02] which the lord thy god
[4:06] giveth thee but at the place
[4:10] which the lord thy god shall choose to
[4:13] place
[4:14] his name in there
[4:17] thou shalt sacrifice the passover
[4:21] at evening at the going down
[4:25] of the sun at the season
[4:28] that thou camest forth out
[4:32] of egypt praise the name of the lord
[4:36] let us pray our gracious god and our
[4:40] heavenly father
[4:41] we thank you from the bottom of our
[4:44] hearts
[4:45] for the display in the heavens
[4:48] for the manifestation here upon the
[4:52] earth
[4:52] and be a praise and magnify you
[4:56] that we are able to recognize it
[5:00] oh and to give you glory for what you
[5:03] are doing in this day
[5:06] so you be all the praise the honor and
[5:09] the glory for we ask it in the name of
[5:11] our lord jesus christ
[5:15] god bless you my friends as i've said
[5:18] before
[5:20] i spoke on the topic of twins
[5:24] of this end time revival
[5:27] and in doing so we
[5:31] talked about the twins that came out of
[5:34] eve
[5:35] cain and abel one being the son
[5:39] of adam and cain of course
[5:43] being called by in first john
[5:46] the son of that wicked one
[5:50] and we traced them
[5:54] or the spirit that anointed them
[5:57] we traced that through the entire bible
[6:01] by showing how it came
[6:04] right down through and
[6:07] went into the evil ones
[6:12] while the spirit went to noah
[6:16] then on to esau and jacob
[6:21] it moved on again right through moses
[6:26] and those that
[6:29] came against him and his message
[6:33] we followed it all the way until
[6:36] we saw those twins rear their heads
[6:39] again
[6:41] judas and jesus christ
[6:45] justice cain and abel were in the same
[6:48] womb from the same
[6:50] womb even so jesus and judas were
[6:55] in the same church
[6:59] now of course we see
[7:03] clearly that the spirit of judas
[7:06] walked with the spirit of jesus christ
[7:11] for his entire
[7:14] earthly ministry walking with him
[7:19] everywhere but we know
[7:23] that that same spirit
[7:28] also left and came into the church ages
[7:35] and we clearly understand
[7:40] that as the ravening wolves that paul
[7:44] spoke about he was there but they were
[7:47] there
[7:48] then later we seen the rise of the
[7:50] nickelodeons
[7:53] and the true servants
[7:56] of the living god
[8:00] so this is a a battle that has been
[8:03] going on
[8:05] from heaven to earth and true
[8:09] time right on and this
[8:13] battle will not really end
[8:16] until we're back in eternity again
[8:20] in the presence of the living god
[8:24] judas of course walked with the lord
[8:27] jesus
[8:30] for his entire ministry until his
[8:34] death which he helped to engineer
[8:38] and he thought that this
[8:42] ending of jesus or what appeared to be
[8:47] the ending of jesus was the end of the
[8:50] ministry and the
[8:51] end of it all but we know
[8:54] it was not the end in
[8:57] souls imprisoned now
[9:00] the same spirits here today
[9:04] living in the same kind of people
[9:08] condemn people that can
[9:12] never be saved because
[9:15] they were condemned before
[9:18] like judas iscariot he was
[9:22] born son of perdition
[9:26] you said judas sure remember
[9:29] judas was religious jew just was a
[9:33] like a church boy he went
[9:36] and heard every sermon that jesus
[9:39] preached
[9:41] and still it didn't help him at all
[9:47] yes sir very religious but you see
[9:50] he couldn't go all the way with jesus
[9:53] message
[9:55] and even so we find even in our day many
[9:58] can't go all the way with the message of
[10:02] the hour
[10:04] you see he couldn't he couldn't take
[10:06] part
[10:07] of jesus message he could take the
[10:09] healings the miracles the wonderful
[10:12] things
[10:12] but when jesus began to say i and my
[10:15] father
[10:16] are one when he begin to say before
[10:20] abraham was i am
[10:24] then that stuck in judas's throat
[10:28] he he could not accept that
[10:31] we could not take it in it was just
[10:34] too much for him couldn't stomach it
[10:38] and so is it in our day
[10:41] many following this message
[10:45] take healing they can take speaking in
[10:49] towns
[10:50] they can take signs and wonders they can
[10:53] take
[10:53] miracles and things like that
[10:56] but when it starts getting into the area
[11:00] of god speaking through man
[11:04] and speaking squirrels into existence
[11:08] that's too hard for them to
[11:11] believe and they can't walk
[11:14] in into that whatsoever because it
[11:17] starts getting too
[11:19] deep for them and they don't want to
[11:22] hear
[11:22] that their heart their thirst their
[11:25] hunger
[11:26] is still for the miracles the signs
[11:30] and the wonders but that was judas
[11:33] in the bible and that's the same spirit
[11:36] of judas
[11:38] here again today because you see
[11:41] judas's spirit can live all the way
[11:45] right up to that spot
[11:48] where the word goes into a a
[11:52] a different dimension and then
[11:56] he can't follow it he can't go after it
[12:00] anymore oh may god help us today
[12:05] my friends let me say this that
[12:09] you can walk in the seven church ages
[12:12] but after those ages have come to an end
[12:16] you believe you followed this message
[12:21] and the message seems
[12:24] in the eyes of many to have come to an
[12:28] end and so
[12:31] they can walk away from it because it
[12:34] seems to have
[12:35] ended the prophet is dead he's gone and
[12:39] there's lots of questions surrounding
[12:41] that and
[12:42] i don't know and and uh that drift away
[12:47] because my friends that's the
[12:50] up to that spot is where
[12:53] their spirit can go and
[12:56] after that they can't see anything
[13:00] anymore let me say my friends
[13:04] if god doesn't call you how are you
[13:06] going to come
[13:08] how are you going to repent
[13:11] if we have relatives and children
[13:15] who are not borned again
[13:19] how how can they be saved how can they
[13:22] be
[13:22] transformed by god's presence and power
[13:26] if god doesn't move within their hearts
[13:30] what are you going to do with them
[13:33] my lots of uh people in
[13:37] this message and in christianity as a
[13:39] whole
[13:40] have made a terrible and
[13:43] awesome awful mistake because they've
[13:48] tried to
[13:49] uh i use my own colloquial term lasso
[13:53] them and wrestle with them
[13:56] with the bible and and
[13:59] you know just shackle them to the church
[14:03] and in the house and then brand them
[14:07] with the name of our denomination
[14:11] baptize them do something
[14:14] to hold them like that baptize them into
[14:18] that
[14:19] denominational franchise or message
[14:22] franchise whatever
[14:24] you want to call it we do our very
[14:28] best to get those ones
[14:31] that we love to get them in
[14:34] in our way of getting
[14:37] them in oh praise
[14:40] god hallelujah amen but friends
[14:44] you must recognize that this work or
[14:48] that work is entirely
[14:52] in the hands of god for salvation
[14:55] is of the lord and salvation
[14:59] is only by election
[15:03] it's god's election and what are you
[15:07] going to do about it
[15:08] how can you change it you can't do it by
[15:11] prayer you can't do it by crying by
[15:14] fasting by
[15:15] offerings by indulgences by giving or
[15:18] something like that
[15:20] god already chose his elected
[15:24] bride from before the foundation
[15:27] of the world and we cannot
[15:30] change god's choice at all
[15:34] we can pray we can intercede
[15:38] we can beg we can isolate
[15:42] those people uh in and surround them
[15:47] with everything that we believe they
[15:50] would
[15:50] love and they would like and we could
[15:54] even
[15:55] take them and place them into our
[15:57] socially
[15:58] protected cocoon we can provide them
[16:03] with a uh you know our own
[16:06] protective incubator
[16:09] and place them in there and place them
[16:12] in that atmosphere
[16:14] of our love oh my
[16:18] and keep them we are keeping them from
[16:21] sin
[16:22] we are keeping them from the world we
[16:25] are keeping them
[16:26] from all of these various things but you
[16:29] see friends
[16:30] with that pattern the moment they
[16:33] are released or they get out of there
[16:36] all the sin diseases the sin
[16:39] viruses all of the
[16:42] sins of the world begin to
[16:46] come upon them and they are more
[16:50] likely to contract those sin
[16:53] diseases of the soul and take them
[16:57] in and god help them in that
[17:00] hour for without god's election without
[17:04] god's germ of god's attribute in them
[17:08] they are long gone may god help us my
[17:11] friends today
[17:12] we are talking about the place where
[17:15] god chose to put his name
[17:19] and here we see friends that if his name
[17:24] if their names are not on the
[17:27] lamb's book of life you
[17:30] just pray and labor and work your
[17:33] sweat yourself to death and if they're
[17:37] not in god's election it won't make
[17:40] any difference they have to be in god's
[17:44] election and then you don't
[17:46] have to push up pull uh you know
[17:50] persuade and and all those things
[17:53] you the word itself will do the work
[17:56] for salvation is of the lord
[18:01] my friends let us not take those kinds
[18:05] of substitutes
[18:06] our own efforts church efforts man's
[18:09] efforts
[18:11] for the work of god for the election of
[18:13] god
[18:14] for the choosing and the ordination of
[18:16] god let us not take any substitutes
[18:19] we must have the genuine
[18:22] token we must have the genuine
[18:26] gene of god within us of course a token
[18:30] is a small piece of something or a small
[18:34] piece if i say a token of god a small
[18:38] piece of god or a small part
[18:41] of god's life within us
[18:44] amen to really be able to have
[18:48] a reverse for and non-seed
[18:52] cannot have a rebirth only
[18:55] one who has already in them
[18:59] a token of the life of god
[19:02] can experience a genuine
[19:06] rebirth or as we say you
[19:10] must be born again amen
[19:13] hallelujah don't rely on the fact that
[19:17] you might have spoken in towns
[19:19] whether in the past or in the present
[19:23] don't you
[19:25] rest your faith in the fact that in
[19:27] every meeting you go
[19:29] you feel goosebumps all over
[19:32] your body don't
[19:35] rest your laurels on the fact
[19:40] that you might have felt the fire of god
[19:43] going down the back of your spine
[19:46] oh my don't take the fact
[19:50] that you have gifts in your life
[19:52] [Music]
[19:53] and you have the faith the anointing
[19:57] to operate those gifts and to pray for
[20:01] people
[20:02] and see miraculous wonderful healings
[20:06] and people excited and running the
[20:08] floors and
[20:10] praising god because they're healed
[20:13] under your ministry and they receive
[20:17] healings signs and wonders and
[20:21] genuine miracles happening
[20:24] around you because of
[20:28] that ministry that god has placed
[20:31] within your life oh my
[20:35] don't take anything like that as an
[20:37] evidence
[20:39] that you have the token
[20:43] it's clearly said in the future whom
[20:48] to receive the holy ghost
[20:51] to have the evidence of the holy ghost
[20:54] is to have a clear understanding
[20:58] of the word of god and then go out and
[21:01] live
[21:02] it wow when does he the spirit of truth
[21:05] is come
[21:06] he will guide you into all truth and
[21:09] show you
[21:10] things to come oh praise god forevermore
[21:13] hallelujah oh my friend if you have
[21:17] one tickle of doubt one
[21:20] little moving affair within your heart
[21:23] get desperate and say lord god today
[21:27] i want to know whether i
[21:30] have that token within my life
[21:34] it oh father for years for even though
[21:37] i'm
[21:38] reading the bible i'm going to church
[21:40] and following the message
[21:42] but i feel as if there's something
[21:44] missing
[21:45] in my life there's a link there's an
[21:48] ingredient
[21:49] that i just can't grasp onto for
[21:52] something is missing somewhere help me
[21:55] lord
[21:56] help me lord jesus i know i
[21:59] must have this token lord in me oh
[22:03] praise god hallelujah amen
[22:06] my friends remember what i said
[22:10] judas could live right
[22:13] up to that spot where
[22:17] he thought the life of jesus had ended
[22:20] completely many believe
[22:23] that this message has come to an end
[22:27] and so their fate begins to drift
[22:32] they begin to wonder about they begin to
[22:35] doubt fears doubts begin to come in
[22:39] they start looking for human teachers
[22:42] everywhere oh instead of looking to
[22:46] god looking for help from heaven
[22:50] looking for heavenly sunshine to
[22:53] shine upon them from above instead of
[22:56] doing that my friends
[22:58] they're caught up with every substitute
[23:01] and every false gate that would lead to
[23:04] god
[23:05] and they are led astray and completely
[23:08] out of the will of god amen
[23:12] amen hallelujah my friends
[23:16] this spirit of judas could live
[23:19] right up to the end of the seventh
[23:22] church age
[23:25] could live right up to the second pole
[23:30] and even partly go to the third
[23:34] but not all the way oh
[23:39] that spirit is a copycat spirit
[23:43] it's a counterfeit
[23:47] a religious deceiver or religious
[23:50] actor in this message
[23:53] in the christianity but particularly
[23:57] in this message for we are coming to the
[24:00] end all things are beginning to
[24:04] wind up for the rapture to take place
[24:08] and so everything is becoming magnified
[24:12] under the bride's discerning eye as she
[24:16] looks into the word of god oh
[24:19] my impersonators
[24:23] they are everywhere now
[24:26] scattered around traveling
[24:30] moving all around within the
[24:33] the message of this hour the true bride
[24:36] is not deceived
[24:38] anymore by denominationalism
[24:42] or by denominations she is not carried
[24:46] away by their
[24:49] dogmas doctrines creeds and litanies
[24:52] she is not carried away by their
[24:54] programs or their precepts
[24:56] for she is founded upon the word of god
[25:00] and so we look for the deceit and the
[25:03] deceiver
[25:04] right within the message of this
[25:08] hour where there are
[25:11] impersonators lot of actors
[25:15] but without the token life of god
[25:20] in you my friend my
[25:23] friend that jew the spirit
[25:28] will anoint you and will have the power
[25:31] to deceive and
[25:33] lead you away but take god
[25:36] the true believer keeps looking away
[25:40] to jesus christ the revealed word of the
[25:43] hour
[25:46] notice the invisible union of the bride
[25:50] page 55
[25:53] some of you people believe this to be
[25:56] the truth
[25:57] do you believe this to be the truth i
[25:59] believe it
[26:00] with all my heart to be the truth of
[26:03] god's word
[26:05] we are entering another age
[26:10] we are entering the rapture
[26:14] age you know the church
[26:18] can't go in this condition friends did
[26:20] you hear that
[26:22] we are entering into another age
[26:25] not being in the seventh church age
[26:30] spiritually
[26:32] physically you might be confined to the
[26:35] seventh church age
[26:37] but spiritually you're entering into
[26:41] another
[26:41] age and that age is called
[26:45] the rapture age
[26:48] in the stature of a perfect man he calls
[26:51] it
[26:51] oh i'm looking for that man or
[26:54] that woman oh who
[26:58] after the seven see seven ages have
[27:02] ended well enter into that eternal
[27:06] church age that comes at the end of the
[27:09] seals
[27:10] may god help you you can re look that up
[27:13] yourself my friends
[27:14] but here we are of course we know
[27:18] an eternal church age is going right
[27:21] back
[27:22] into the very mind and heart of god
[27:26] and back where we come from spiritually
[27:29] while we are yet here on the earth for
[27:32] we
[27:33] shall be changed in the moment in the
[27:36] treatment of an eye
[27:37] by the power of the word of god working
[27:41] within our hearts and within our lives
[27:46] amen hallelujah listen
[27:49] we are entering the rapture rage
[27:53] the church can't go in his present
[27:56] condition can you send amen
[27:58] amen the church cannot go
[28:03] in its present condition and it can't
[28:05] get any better either
[28:07] for it's rejected and rejecting the word
[28:10] of god
[28:11] so it's going to wax worse and worse
[28:14] and worse but there's something else
[28:17] moving right now
[28:19] lord of god hallelujah i said something
[28:22] else
[28:23] is moving right now listen
[28:26] he's speaking in the invisible union of
[28:28] the bride
[28:29] here saying yes the move is on
[28:34] but the move is on for the bride
[28:37] the move is on for the bride that's the
[28:40] truth
[28:41] that's thus saith the lord hallelujah
[28:45] i want to say here the move is on that
[28:47] move is
[28:48] on my lord the move is on hallelujah
[28:52] the move is on my lord the move is on
[28:55] i can hear the rustling in the mulberry

[32:14] by the word see
[32:17] people go into them systems
[32:22] and the system runs them away from the
[32:26] word instead of to the word
[32:30] but only the word will bring them back
[32:35] now notice after so long a time
[32:39] the word is coming back to you to eve
[32:43] how did she fall how did he fall
[32:47] where did she fall from she fell
[32:51] from the word
[32:54] and god said to her he would make a way
[32:59] to redeem her back to the word again
[33:04] after a long time the
[33:07] word would become known to her
[33:11] again oh blessed be his holy name
[33:14] the word would become known to her
[33:18] all right the word then would come
[33:22] for one purpose now oh my
[33:25] the word would come to her for one
[33:27] purpose
[33:29] and that was for the purpose of
[33:31] redemption
[33:33] just jesus came he the word
[33:37] and he came then for the purpose
[33:40] of redemption and now in these
[33:43] last days the opening of the
[33:46] seven seals
[33:50] the revelation of the word
[33:53] to the true believer has come
[33:57] and it's come to us for what reason what
[34:01] purpose
[34:03] has come for your redemption
[34:06] to buy you back and bring you back
[34:09] into the presence of god into the mind
[34:12] of god
[34:13] into the life of god hallelujah
[34:16] so that he could live in you walking you
[34:19] talk in you and live his own life
[34:22] through you which is genuine
[34:25] christianity
[34:26] or christ in you glory be to god
[34:29] hallelujah
[34:30] amen amen oh praise god
[34:34] hallelujah listen the word come for one
[34:37] purpose
[34:38] for redemption until
[34:41] that time she had substitutes
[34:46] and substitutes would only work
[34:50] until the time arrived for the original
[34:54] word
[34:56] amen now
[34:59] he told her
[35:02] the word would come to her again
[35:05] but until that time comes
[35:10] he gave her a substitute
[35:13] until the original word arrives
[35:16] on the scene he gave her
[35:20] an offering that she could make
[35:23] a substitute for the blood
[35:26] until the real lamb's blood came
[35:30] now the blood was of bulls and sheep
[35:34] and goats and things but that did not
[35:38] take away
[35:39] her sins it only
[35:42] covered her sins it didn't take it away
[35:47] it only covered it for it was
[35:51] animal's blood and the animal's blood
[35:55] in the animal's blood was animal life
[35:58] it was a substitute until
[36:02] the reel came along hallelujah
[36:06] praise god so before the lamb
[36:09] could take his bride to be ever by his
[36:12] side
[36:13] he the lamb the word must first
[36:17] redeem her amen
[36:20] hallelujah thank god all
[36:23] through the other church ages they could
[36:26] not
[36:27] uh experience full redemption
[36:31] they only had partial faith
[36:35] partial faith partial redemption
[36:38] but now when the perfect fullness
[36:42] of the word has come we can
[36:45] now friends have total deliverance
[36:49] we can now my friends have perfect
[36:52] redemption to purchase my blood
[36:55] amen and be brought into the very
[36:59] uh presence of the living god
[37:02] hallelujah amen so the other church had
[37:06] just fell from grace
[37:07] i will not touch on that now but that
[37:09] fell from grace
[37:10] uh somewhere along the line but this uh
[37:14] end time genuine little flock
[37:17] oh praise god she can't fall
[37:20] she won't fall because uh she has a
[37:24] anchor she has in her typos
[37:27] she has herself anchored in jesus
[37:31] she'll she'll go over every storm and
[37:34] every wave
[37:35] every trial every temptation
[37:38] and every trouble amen hallelujah
[37:42] amen praise god they took part
[37:45] of the word but this end time bride
[37:50] takes all of the word within our heart
[37:54] and so not until this age
[37:57] could she come and experience perfect
[38:01] redemption
[38:02] hallelujah oh praise god
[38:06] he said how will it redeem her it will
[38:08] come to her
[38:10] so that she will know the word again
[38:14] hallelujah and i believe right now there
[38:17] are
[38:18] some people that the word is revealing
[38:20] itself to
[38:22] and they're annoying the word of god
[38:25] again oh thank god forevermore
[38:28] oh hallelujah glory to his name god
[38:32] is making himself known in this hour
[38:34] he's doing
[38:35] something big and i believe i'm a part
[38:39] of it
[38:39] oh blessed be his name hallelujah
[38:42] the word has come the word has come for
[38:46] your redemption
[38:48] the word is revealing itself to you now
[38:51] so that you can be born again
[38:55] oh praise god impersonators are still
[38:59] here
[39:01] they're in the message they're none
[39:04] other
[39:05] than our opposite twin oh
[39:09] the message of the seventh church age
[39:12] messenger has certainly produced
[39:16] twins and out of this message
[39:20] revival we can plainly see it
[39:23] and we can clearly say twins
[39:27] have come out of this last day
[39:31] message revival
[39:34] but here is the thing friends these
[39:37] impersonators no matter how religious
[39:42] how godly they appear or or
[39:45] seem or are they are
[39:48] satisfied with the substitutes
[39:53] but the elect are only satisfied
[39:57] by the opening of the word the word
[40:00] being revealed to them hallelujah
[40:04] oh glory to god justice jehovah
[40:09] gave his people in israel a
[40:12] natural paschal lamb
[40:16] until the real lamb
[40:19] word of god came
[40:22] along to save them
[40:26] so we see
[40:29] that god has sent his word
[40:33] and that word was crucified
[40:37] and have a rising of the sun
[40:41] and has come back to its spirit form
[40:45] revealing and making itself known
[40:49] to his beloved elected
[40:53] and so we find now a trashing time a
[40:57] sifting time
[40:58] approving of his word time is here upon
[41:02] us
[41:02] my friends when some are accepting
[41:06] the substitute that they already
[41:10] have and god gave that substitute
[41:13] god gave that first that second poll
[41:16] god gave that substitute god gave it
[41:20] right up there friends and you can't say
[41:22] god didn't give it
[41:24] but it was only for a season
[41:27] now you just take the thought and follow
[41:29] that little further
[41:30] i'll stop i'll move on with what i have
[41:32] to say
[41:33] but to the spiritual mind take it and
[41:36] throw along
[41:37] with it yes you see so they accepted
[41:40] those substitutes
[41:43] and such people all they can see
[41:46] is a prophet
[41:50] but the true elect look past the veil
[41:55] they look and all they can see
[41:58] is jesus christ revealing himself
[42:03] revealing his word and making himself
[42:07] known to his people through the
[42:10] manifestation
[42:12] of revelation 10 7 malachi 4 5
[42:16] amen the mighty angel of revelation
[42:19] 10 1 coming down and going
[42:23] to revelation 10 7
[42:26] to fulfill amen the book of luke 17
[42:30] amen 30 praise god the revealing of the
[42:34] son of man
[42:35] the opening of the word the
[42:37] manifestation of our day our time
[42:39] and of our hour amen yes sir
[42:43] the blood of bulls and god served their
[42:45] purpose
[42:46] they were substitutes until the real
[42:50] blood
[42:51] or life of the lamb of god
[42:54] came along and was shed on calvary
[42:58] for us amen but
[43:02] when the blood of jesus the lamb of god
[43:06] the real lamb was shed
[43:09] our jewish brethren and their rabbis
[43:13] even to this day have been so
[43:16] wrapped up in the substitutes
[43:19] that god himself gave them
[43:23] that they are blinded to the truth
[43:26] and to the revelation that
[43:29] jesus christ was that lamb
[43:32] that passed the lamb
[43:36] that died to take away their sins
[43:40] our sins not cover our sins
[43:44] but take them away block them out
[43:47] carry them away praise god in the sea of
[43:50] god's forgetfulness
[43:52] hallelujah amen and so
[43:59] israel and their rabbis
[44:03] have focused on their substitutes
[44:08] and denied and rejected
[44:11] the redemptive coming of the word
[44:15] of the lamb they rejected the coming
[44:19] of the word not realizing it
[44:23] and even saw today in our day and in
[44:26] our hour i'm speaking about spiritual
[44:28] israel
[44:29] now he's talking about those who were
[44:33] called out by the message in an
[44:36] exodus entered
[44:39] into the wilderness that would herein
[44:44] cries being proven and tried
[44:48] by the word of god
[44:51] and so we find even so
[44:55] today many people being called out
[44:59] in a similar way have their own
[45:03] ideas of what the bible
[45:07] and the message is saying to them
[45:12] you see they don't understand
[45:15] or have not received that opening of
[45:18] their heart
[45:20] that opening of the soul
[45:23] amen to recognize that god gave
[45:27] substitutes it was god who gave the
[45:30] rhema
[45:31] god gave the written word that we can
[45:34] all read it
[45:35] we can all compare we can all study
[45:38] late hours of the night early hours of
[45:41] the morning we can fast and pray over
[45:43] the rima
[45:44] we can be able to um you know hear a
[45:47] little dare a little
[45:48] uh we can place it in various ways
[45:52] oh my friends but you see that
[45:55] was only a substitute to bring you to
[45:59] christ
[46:00] that was only a substitute to bring you
[46:03] to him
[46:04] who is the supernatural being the
[46:08] presence
[46:09] of the great mighty illuminating pillar
[46:11] of fire
[46:12] that was with israel is now with us
[46:16] and we we are privileged and blessed
[46:19] to walk with him to be led by
[46:22] him by his spirit and walk wherever he
[46:25] says
[46:26] to walk amen praise god but friends
[46:30] the rhema is one thing we can become
[46:34] doctors ability maestro's message
[46:37] doctors of divinity and
[46:38] great teachers of the message in the
[46:41] reamer
[46:42] in the courts in the message my friends
[46:45] but i'm talking about being able to
[46:48] enter into the logos
[46:51] or have the logos itself reveal itself
[46:55] to
[46:56] you and to know him
[46:59] in the power of his reappearance the
[47:02] power of his resurrection
[47:03] the power of his divine reality and his
[47:07] presence
[47:08] in our hearts and lives
[47:11] now if we were to go to the book of
[47:13] deuteronomy
[47:17] back to chapter 16
[47:20] god is speaking in his word
[47:26] and there thou mayest
[47:29] not sacrifice the passover
[47:33] within any of thy gates
[47:36] which the lord thy god giveth thee
[47:40] verse 5 16 5 deuteronomy 16
[47:44] 5 and 6. he says look i know i gave you
[47:48] those gates
[47:50] but now the time is over for that
[47:54] don't you go sacrificing anymore
[47:57] within those gates which i the lord thy
[48:01] god
[48:02] gave you but the place
[48:05] this is where you must worship
[48:08] this is where you should sacrifice
[48:12] but the place which the lord thy god
[48:15] shall choose
[48:16] to place his name in there
[48:20] thou shalt sacrifice the passover
[48:23] at evening at the going down of the sun
[48:27] evening time oh my god hallelujah
[48:31] it's evening time again oh
[48:34] end up the season
[48:37] that thou camest fort out of
[48:41] egypt blessed be the name of our god
[48:44] oh hallelujah praise god forevermore
[48:48] what a place to be in brother and to
[48:50] recognize where you're at this
[48:52] is the evening time do you believe it i
[48:54] believe it
[48:55] this is the evening time amen and
[48:58] god for a season
[49:02] permitted us to offer sacrifices
[49:08] at gates which he provided
[49:12] and permitted and allowed us to
[49:16] worship him and to praise him
[49:19] and to serve him in because he permitted
[49:22] those gates
[49:25] like the blood and the of the bulls and
[49:27] goats were permitted
[49:28] but only for a season until the reality
[49:32] came
[49:33] until the perfect lamb came
[49:37] and so we find we were allowed to
[49:40] worship
[49:40] at lutheran gates we were permitted to
[49:44] worship at presbyterian baptist catholic
[49:47] uh whatever gates god
[49:51] received it at that time
[49:54] because it he allowed it he permitted it
[49:58] at that time but we are now
[50:01] in another age and god
[50:04] our god has moved on
[50:09] and is marching on for his glory and
[50:12] honor
[50:13] and the move is on within
[50:16] the bride of jesus christ hallelujah
[50:21] listen speaking
[50:25] not in any of these gates thou may
[50:28] not sacrifice the passover
[50:31] within any of these gates
[50:34] which the lord thy god giveth thee
[50:38] now remember not in any of these gates
[50:42] lord permitted it but now he doesn't
[50:45] want the worship
[50:46] in any of these gates but the place
[50:49] which the lord shall choose to place his
[50:51] name
[50:52] only at that gate that's the only place
[50:56] amen that we should worship him
[51:00] the place or the gate in which
[51:03] he place his name o glory
[51:06] to god not in in any of those gates
[51:10] but the certain gate that god has
[51:14] provided
[51:15] for his people oh as i wind this down
[51:18] now my friends
[51:20] i tell you the only place god will
[51:23] receive
[51:24] your worship or your sacrifice is the
[51:27] gate where he
[51:28] plays his name which gate is that then
[51:33] which gate is it the bible tells us he
[51:36] placed his
[51:37] name in christ amen
[51:40] and the gate is christ for jesus himself
[51:44] said
[51:45] i am the way amen no
[51:48] man cometh to the father but by me
[51:51] why he is the gate he is the way
[51:54] past thee the angels with the flaming
[51:58] swords
[51:59] he is the way back to spiritual
[52:01] supernatural
[52:03] eat then in the eden and god oh my
[52:07] hallelujah amen the revealed word
[52:11] of the hour he has placed his name there
[52:14] in the midst of all these substitutes
[52:17] we're able
[52:18] to discern discern all these substitute
[52:22] gates
[52:23] we can discern them and put them aside
[52:27] if you haven't put your gate aside that
[52:30] you've lived in
[52:31] been and brought up in worship in and
[52:34] it's time for you to put that gate aside
[52:37] and realize there's only one way to god
[52:41] and jesus christ himself is the way
[52:44] he is the gate to god himself
[52:47] glory to god hallelujah so in the midst
[52:51] of all these
[52:52] we can brush them aside and place our
[52:55] hands on
[52:56] hold to god's unchanging hand
[52:59] of his revealed word but watch the other
[53:02] twins
[53:04] what does our other twin do they hold on
[53:08] to what they have
[53:10] and go along with their substitutes
[53:13] even if it's a message substitute they
[53:17] their interpretations of what they think
[53:20] the bible is saying
[53:21] their interpretations are thoughts of
[53:24] what they think their word is saying the
[53:26] message is saying
[53:27] of what the prophet said as so-called
[53:30] and many message teachers are giving
[53:34] their
[53:34] various interpretations of what they
[53:38] think the message is saying amen
[53:42] but remember jesus said i am
[53:45] the way hallelujah oh my
[53:49] but his name is not in just the written
[53:51] word my friends
[53:53] his name is now in the gate
[53:56] of the revealed word of the hour
[54:00] god making himself known by an act of
[54:03] grace
[54:04] to reveal himself to an individual
[54:07] in whom leia gene seed germ of god
[54:12] and attribute from before the foundation
[54:15] of the world that's now coming into the
[54:18] manifestation
[54:19] of the children of god sons and
[54:22] daughters of the living of god
[54:24] and we have crossed over the gap into
[54:27] the capstone
[54:28] for this day and we have done it my
[54:31] friends
[54:32] we have done it by the gateway of god
[54:35] through the opening
[54:36] of the word of god hallelujah oh

[54:42] this is the gateway into the glorious
[54:45] presence
[54:46] and the glorious liberty of the children
[54:49] of the living god the countdown is on
[54:52] now my friends
[54:53] and thank god our only way out of here
[54:57] out of this mess unto this madness
[55:00] that we have here and this chaos the
[55:02] only way out
[55:03] is to get into christ get into the
[55:07] capstone
[55:08] get into the the great capsule
[55:12] that you might be able to be taken out
[55:15] of here

[55:18] changing of the
[55:19] grace power of the word of god and by
[55:22] the grace
[55:23] of god hallelujah i'm glad that i'm i
[55:26] believe i'm
[55:27] walking in christ i believe i'm living
[55:30] in that capsule and i'm looking out of
[55:33] its windows

[55:37] looking at the rest
[55:39] of believers who are might be
