TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good morning friends it's good to be here again may the lord richly bless us together as we look into the perfect law of liberty our gracious heavenly father in the name of jesus christ we ask your blessing upon this sunday morning service upon every individual that's tuned in watching and listening may they experience the grace of god the love of god the fellowship of the holy spirit take all the praise the honor and the glory for we ask it in the name of our lord jesus amen and amen our scripture for today is found in matthew chapter 6 reading verse 5 and when thou prayest thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men verily i say unto you they have their reward praise be to god now this phrase be not as the hypocrites are is mentioned seven times in this particular chapter of matthew six in matthew 23 he uses the term war unto you hypocrites and that my friends is also mentioned several times in the word of god now jesus has come into jerusalem and he has gone into the synagogues and spoken in many open public places and in doing so he warns his followers be not as these hypocrites are referring mainly to the pharisees and sadducees but mainly to the pharisees he was warning his followers his believers against skin deep religion copy cut religion you see jesus describes the pharisees with these revealing words very revealing actually jesus might have been or may have been the very first person to use the word hypocrite in this particular way now this english word hypocrite it originates from the greek word hubocris hupo kritz h u p o k r i t e s now no one else in the entire bible at any time ever used this word but jesus uses the word hypocrites 17 times that we know of in the bible and he is the only one that uses this particular word it's taking a commonplace word and uses it with a revealing meaning you see the word hypocrites means actor it means actor or actress literally it means someone performing behind the mask someone that's living behind a mask in other words it means someone that is fake someone that is lacking sincerity someone who has the style and the appearance but they do not have the substance in other words we're talking about a plastic kind of person a person that's putting on or are putting on a a a show or a putting on a drama for the lookers on the the people that are in the world or the people that are round about will see them as a person that is presenting themselves in a way that they really are not now of course if i might pause here for a moment realize that satan is the one of the world's greatest actors inspiration for acting most of it comes from satan for he is the greatest one of the greatest actors of all time and his children also are actors and his associates are also actors acting of course also is a form of deception for satan is the father of deceit and lies and so acting is a form of deception and lying and satan's kingdom is built on the foundation of deceit and lies now such a person that lives under that kind of inspiration that kind of uh inward motivation living for what others will think about them what others will see what others will feel about them such a person is not authentic at all because that person is not really revealing their true nature or their true genuine personality they're living their life behind a mask they present to the world and invented or dramatized and idealized form of their true self as if of course what they're showing to the people what they're showing to the public uh they want the public to believe that that's the real person but we know in reality many people many believers are living their lives behind a religious mask now they'll give insincere emotionally expected and accepted responses and reactions rather than genuine ones that comes from their real self you see they're really actors and they're living as i've said before behind or under a mask and manifesting a tetrical uh you know dramatic performance in their entire lives and now this is where i'm taking uh our text from jesus is warning his people and he is warning his children that they should not live their life behind the mask or masking their true self he warns us as children of the kingdom of heaven that we are not to live under a mask for he says be not as the hypocrites or the actors are let me repeat jesus is warning us as believers as christians and we are to take this warning directly from his lips for they are most essential and important that out of all the groups out of all the people on the planet at the time when he was here he purposely singled out the pharisees for this rebuke woe unto you actors woe unto you hypocrites woe unto you pharisees and then he warns his children be not as the hypocrites or the actors are according to matthew chapter 6 verse 25 don't live your life as uh you're an actor on the stage don't live your christianity to to to amuse the people that are around about and then to be rewarded with acclaim with praise with cheers their goals are real christian oh my friends that would just be a life of acting it's a play to many people it's a religious play well the shakespeare say that's all the world is a stage and friends there's a lot of acting that's going on [Music] and not in the theaters either nor in films but we are seeing this acting taking place in real life and that kind of living in real life is full of harm full of evil because it's not a play nor is it a movie you shall not be as the actors the hypocrites are the way they live putting on a constant and continuous act for the benefit of those that are looking on at you trying to live a christian life i want to say take off that mask that is my subject for today take off that mask that you are wearing take off that mask that you have on take on that take off that mask that you have carried for years creating an impression in the mind's eye of persons that you are us living a certain way when in the center of you in the very being of you you know that you are not what you are projecting or presenting to persons who are seeing you you're a deceiver for an actor is a deceiver who causes people to see and believe something that they really are not certainly so i urge you in the name of jesus christ take off your false mask of course actors real actors and actresses in this world they wear masks and when they are finished they take off that mask let me pause here back in the days of the greeks when they had these actors and actresses they literally made mass that they wore and that would be the character that they would represent now in our day the actors and actresses use their real faces but instead of a carved or a painted or a made-up mask they wear what we call makeup the actors wear what we call let me repeat makeup so there's a makeup artist that goes and makes up their face uh with paints with various pencils and pens and and stains and stuff of that nature and even the actor could be a man or a woman that's valued at a million two million ten million twenty million seventy million dollars and a makeup artist can dress him or her up can place certain colors paints powders upon their faces and cause them to go from being a young person to looking like an old down and out decrypted person that's homeless in the street needing your sympathy or your pity and that is all a play they are wearing a mask made with modern day makeup here we see friends men and women wearing masks that are not real of course we know makeup is a form of mask and as we have said actors are the mo the worst deceivers the worst cheats and liars when we look at the the wearing of makeup in our day and in our time it's become something that is acceptable it's become something that everyone uh uh or most everyone uh wears today and even as i'm speaking about it here now some folk will look in that as something strange or something different why would you speak about makeup for it is something normal that men and women wear today but it is not normal for that's not the real person that's not their real face that's not their real eyebrows because they'll shave off their real eyebrows and then turn around and take a pencil and draw an eyebrow with the shape that they like and they will present that set of painted on eyebrows as if it's their real self it's a lie it's a misrepresentation it's a deception we find out and i'm speaking about men and women for men are wearing makeup women are wearing makeup also we find friends that even with their eyelashes their hairs upon their eyes maybe too short and they'll go out and have it made up in other words they'll have it put on false deceiving and lying and placing it there and acting as if that is their real self when it is not we ought to be ourselves and we ought to present our true self and allow persons to judge us the way god has made us oh praise his marvelous and wonderful name we see it my friends everywhere oh they'll put on the matter of fact businesses have been formed out of this makeup businesses have been formed on teaching women how to have better or longer fingernails how to have them with the right color that matches the dress or the blouse that matches their earrings or matches something else they they businesses are formed just for the fact of preparing men and women to be actors hypocrites contrary to the word of god jesus christ himself said to his children be not as the hypocrites are the actors are the pretenders the plastic persons don't be like them be your real self be true to god be true to yourself you are beautiful the way god made you you are beautiful with the natural beauty that god has given to you now i don't want you to make any mistake about this anyone is free to do whatever they want anyone is free to wear whatever they want anyone can go into whichever direction they want but you must also recognize i have the right to express my view as i see it according to this bible and this word of god that such people or persons or so-called christians that do these things are hypocrites going contrary to the word of god and as jesus said be not as the hypocrites or the actors are don't be like the actors are you are not to live a life of acting in my words take off that mask take off the mascara take off the paint take off the false eyebrows take off the false eyelashes then call yourself a christian call yourself a woman of god and man of god and have yourself made up with all sorts of things like that you're nothing but an actor according to the words of jesus himself be not as the hypocrites be not as the actors are for they are contrary to the word of god and they are not of the children of heaven yes if they find themselves that their hair is a certain way and maybe they don't like it the way their hair is they'll change their hair to suit themselves well my friends i don't really care what color what or all along or whatever you do with it that's up to you but i am just telling you what i see in the word of the living god and it's up to you to take account of yourself before the presence of the living god take off that mask take it off and be whatever and whoever god wants you to be he's expressing a a kind of beauty through you that no one else has they will say oh it's not like this person is not like this person it's not like this great person or it's not like this actor or actress whoever they are but my friends you are unique you are individual you are who you are because god made you with a beauty that is your own and none can compare with it let me repeat it the beauty that god has given to you the appearance god has given to you is unique there is no one else like it and you ought to preserve your own self your own beauty by the grace and power of almighty god listen my friends some will feel that their lips are not red enough their lips are not brown enough their lips are not purple enough maybe their lips are not green enough maybe it it doesn't have that right shade of pink there's a huge massive business that satan has set up and has his children to set up that could produce all the paints all the powders all of the lipstick that you can think about to meet the needs of every desire of every person on this planet so that they could present themselves to the world in their capacity as one of those actors which an actor is really a deceiver an actor is presenting yourself through lying you are presenting yourself as someone or somebody who is not what they appear to be we know that men and women today are some of the worst deceivers presenting themselves false everything falls from the top of their head right down to the nails of their toes false absolutely contrary to the word of the living god yes sir go about your real life take off all those masks stop living under a mask and do your own self be true have the real natural color of your face your skin uh have it there because that's the way god made you and god gave it to you that way he knows what kind of beauty you will express by that which he has given you but in other words you looked over the fence you seen somebody else some a good-looking man some uh beautiful woman so-called beautiful woman and so you decide i want to be beautiful or this man i want to be handsome and so you begin to dress yourself up make yourself up and it's a makeup it's a put on it's a copycat it's not real it's nothing but acting and then when you get home at night you have to wipe off the colors you have to wipe off the mascara and make up when you get home you got to take off all that stuff that you claim was real and if they will see you then you'll be a different person that there will be seeing or looking at than the one that they see during the day with all of those gallons of makeup on so much that you could take a a brush and use the paint from some of these people and paint the uh a wall with it my god what a area what a realm we are living in now that's in the realm of natural man and woman now in the realm of institutional and professional life we find out friends that there are men and women trained certified and paid to act out certain roles certain parts they are paid and they call professionals because they were trained to act that part they were trained to be exactly that now we see of course we know that lawyers which is another group that jesus himself singles out in the bible in the word of god not that one can't be a lawyer but to be a lawyer and to be a real christian it's not really easy but we find that lawyers if they are successful lawyers most of the times they have to be very good actors they have to have control over their looks their emotions their presentations of whatever they're presenting to the public scientists are the same various specialists experts so-called in so-called fields doctors are are are actors also they're trained in under certain conditions that they must act in a certain way to cause their patients to feel in a certain way we find professors also are in that and in the courts when there are huge massive lucrative cases we find out many of these so-called experts and specialists are called in and paid huge sums of money to produce a certain result or a certain report and it's so funny to see experts on one side and you have experts on the other side and both sides are believing that they are absolutely right now if this was really true and man were to look at everything in a proper way then every expert would see the same thing they would recognize the same truth but we realize it's all deception and lies and deceit and greed and every other uh emotion and desire hidden underneath there that they will produce a report as they were paid to produce they will produce results that they were paid to reduce and if i were to take that thought over and take it into the religious realm we see as those people were attended their various universities colleges and special uh special universities then my friends they were given their degrees to authenticate and certify that they have this ability to act in this capacity so we see in the religious realm we see the very same thing the church has been taken over by the world the ministry of of the ministers have been taken over by the world individual believers who should be leaving the real life of christ have been taken over by these spirits of these actors whom jesus calls be not as the hypocrites or the actors are for they shall receive their reward from my father which is in heaven so they'll attend the religious school they'll go and study for five ten years in a monastery they'll go my friends into a seminary others will attend a bible college or bible school and receive what is known as formal education in that religious realm formal authentication certification receive a diploma that they have actually arrived at the apex of being able to act in this particular capacity and then they're given their degrees basbds you know dd's or phds whatever to represent that they have received their authentication and that they are allowed to act in this capacity now we know that in both of these realms both religious and institutional that reveals to us that now any testimony of a so-called expert or specialist or specialist preacher or specialist doctor of divinity or specialist doctor of philosophy actually can be bought or sold and paid for and any result to get any result or any report that you want all my friends because they will only say what they were taught or what they were trained to do if they were taught that there were three gods it's not been revealed to them as an individual god didn't speak to them as an individual but they were taught they were trained in this particular church church school university or or bible school that god is three in one and they in turn are certified and authenticated from that seminary or monastery to go forth with that kind of authority and authentication behind them not coming from god but coming from that seminary coming from that particular monastery and they'll grow forth teaching what they were taught and they'll teach a lie believing it's the truth they'll teach one that god is three in one and miraculously he becomes one when we know in the bible itself hero is a the lord thy god as one lord that god is one and one alone he said here i am beside me there is no other and one sat upon the throne amen glory to god one not three but one one god and so here it is friends they teach whatever they were taught they were taught that jesus said baptizing them in the name of father son and of the son and of the holy ghost amen and peter an apostle takes me to god that at least he moved by the holy spirit on the day of pentecost he moved on the revelation and when they asked him men and brethren what shall we do to be saved and peter the so-called first pope answered clearly definitively down through the ages his words remain unchanged repent be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy spirit amen for it is unto you and to your children of your children's child children you'll receive this gift of the holy ghost for there is no other name given under heaven whereby we must be saved but the name of jesus christ yes there is only one mediator there is nowhere in the bible you will find there's a media tricks there's only one mediator between god and man and that is jesus christ they will just go out and teach what they have taught with high sounding phrases with a great personality with greater speaking ability like that they'll go out in the world and they'll teach as they were taught that eve at an apple in the garden of eden when your common sense looking at the word of god and using your common sense you'll recognize it was not an apple but that she committed adultery with the serpent who was not a snake at the time or else god would not have to say from today you will now go on your belly he was not on his belly but i will not get into that now but god placed him in that cursed position he cursed the ground he cursed the woman he cursed the serpent oh my my friends it's so clear that it's not appear on the tree it was a pear on the ground and god cursed them in that area when he said from this day you will have pain and conception and so on it's in your bible if you want to take the time and search it out you can search it out in your bible you can ask me you can ask any of the deacons any of the brothers or sisters anywhere in the world that truly sees and believes the word of god and they will point you to the word of that fruit-bearing tree that woman and how the devil was so evil and was used but these so-called modern day preachers acting contrary to the word of god saying and doing what they were trained to do and uh i don't have all the time to deal with this subject as i would like to deal with it but they can go over here be paid in this denomination or over there be paid more in that denomination and they'll say whatever that denomination tells them they believe [Music] they'll report whatever report is necessary to produce well we believe this we believe this we believe that the other fundamentals are this this this this okay i understand that now they are going to produce that fundamental over and over believing it to be their truth that god has revealed to them now this should be something where by revelation paul said he made known to me the mystery jesus said upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it but satan has been trying to get the world into the systems of man to set up the way you should think and so he knows the way you are thinking as long as you are in that system or you were in that kind of schooling or you came out with those points of views that he has spewed and spread and spawned throughout his various so-called higher higher schools of learning my friends and you go and receive it there then you begin to speak that back as truth and nothing but it's nothing but a lie and contrary to the word of god now we find out friends that in the days of elijah we realize that elijah confronted all of ahab and jezebel's prophets and any true son and servant of god will confront the prophets of baal the prophets of jezebel ahab's prophets the prophets of the of revelation 13 right through 19. yes they'll confront them in the name of the lord with the word of the lord in the name of jesus christ and tell the truth according to this bible and this word of god these false prophets of jezebel and they were false because they act from her table they took her influence upon them they were trained in her school of prophets and all of them were going to say the same thing because they were taught the same thing within that they may place it the different ways and twist it turn it different ways but in actual fact at the bottom of it all there are all saying the very same thing and there my friends when we read in the book of kings chapter 1 uh first kings chapter 21. and chapter 22 we read about the murder of nebot and then we read of elijah's prophecy of how ahab would die the way neighbor died the dogs lit neighbors blood and so elijah prophesied ahab when you die the dogs will lick your blood and so we find my friends that elijah died left the scene and it had not happened no doubt many laughed many much because oh elijah is dead he's gone gone up in a fiery chariot well of course if it was today it would be in an automobile on a highway a wreck on the highway or something like that that that that elijah's spirit would be taken up in the presence of god but back then it was horses and chariots that elijah elisha elisha saw now we find out that ahab wanted to go to war elijah is now dead he is now gone from the scene and there is a man of god by the name of michael and after ahab wants to go to war so he said i'm going to go to war but you know i'm going to call uh uh jehoshaphat my other friendly king i know he's a godly man and and let me ask him and they got together and jehoshaphat said well uh ahab said era my 400 prophets every one of them have prophesied every one of them have said we will win the war they had a prophecy of victory but uh something about jehoshaphat he says yeah isn't there just one more is it there just one and well ahab said well there is one his name is mike kaya but he doesn't like me he is always contrary to the rest he is always saying something different he's a he's a spoiled sport you know he's not even a real prophet he doesn't dress like a prophet walk like a prophet talk like a prophet maybe he doesn't have the accreditations affiliations and and stuff like a real prophet but uh if you want to hear him then why not let's listen to him and so they brought in micaiah and asked him what he thought but while the messenger was bringing my kaya the messenger said well my kind they're bringing you in because they want to know if they're going to win this battle well i'll tell you 400 of us have already prophesied they are going to have a great victory so when you get there be wise and say the same thing and that's what is usually expected but michaela being a son and servant of god said listen i can only say what the lord tells me to say what the lord puts in my mouth to say that is what i am going to say glory be to god hallelujah amen friends and so when he stands before the kings and they asked him he said i see israel scattered like sheep having no shepherd in other words i see you losing the battle and israel having to run for their lives and i see you dead i see you dead having no shepherd oh ahab was so mad and there may be some here this morning that maybe he's extremely mad extremely upset at what they have been hearing through this message but take off that mask oh my friends and here it is my friends that right away he says take him and put him in the prison until i get back feed him with bread and water and my cryo turned back as they were taking him and said if you come back god has not spoken to me amen glory to god hallelujah and you know the rest of the story how that israel lost the battle and how ahab was killed and the blood sprayed upon his armor they took him back to samaria and while they were taking off their armor quickly and resting it on the ground while they took off the armor before they can carry him in his robes while they were busy doing that a dog came up and licked the blood off of ahab's armor to fulfill the word of elijah that he had spoken and even so my friends men of god for this hour and for this day can say nothing different than what the prophet of this hour the elijah of this day according to malachi 4 5 has said according to god's word they can say no different of what will be the end of the heart of church what will be the end of those who stay within her system what will be the end of those who prophesy and say only what she has said then they will reach the very end and the very judgment that she has reached that's why god said in the book of revelation come out from the monster my people and be not partakers of her plagues now we know christianity has been invaded and taken over by hordes of these hypocrites hypocrites according to the greek word actors the meaning of that word meaning actors there yes sir hordes of religious actors and hypocrites now living in the church in a modern day playhouse and my friends we see even in the church the marriage game the marriage relationship which should be something real and sacred it has become the mating game where they dance around each other seeing who could craft a more crafty scheming uh you know marriage marriage agreement so they can have a a real so called marriage and so the mating game is played today no more that till death do us part and what god has joined together let no one set asunder that has become so shallow so cheap that's become all these hundreds and thousands of weddings have become that a cheap representation of god's original intention within his words when we look in the churches they're filled with religious drama even the platforms made in such a way to produce religious dramas the people live a life of religious drama we find out that the preachers have become actors they know just when to gesture they know when to have that photogenic look they know exactly all the various arts and they participate in the arts of counseling in the arts of acting in the arts of speaking in the arts of sermon preparation and this and that and all manner of various sciences that they have actually studied oh my but they are nothing but hypocrites actors copycats put on they'll see a preacher that's been anointed and used of god and they'll go out and try to copycat that and like ahab's magicians there maybe we'll get so close to it have a few miracles but nothing to compare with the life and ministry of a man of god anointed and sent by god upon this earth to perform his divine will so we are presented with pretenders and imposters man today that are put ons they're in it for the reports they can give the money they can make the pay they can receive the wonderful status that they claim they can have the cheers they can have of the world and the praise of the world they they all of the recognition that they can get from the world the books they can write the the songs they can sing and and the various things they can receive but all my friends it's so bad that these preachers and teachers pass that down onto the so-called believers who produce nothing but a dramatized and studied form of christianity they they must think of how they have got to act under this situation i need to act this way under this situation i need to act this way i need to be patient now because this person is doing this or they're saying that i'm a christian so i can't become angry and you see their entire life is one of stress and pressure lest they be found out from their hypocrites action their acting and their way of living and so we find these believers are taught how to produce religious acting they're taught how to be a christian and how to produce a life according to the standards and guidelines given to them by the various fundamentals of their particular church system and that is why you see a baptism look like a baptist because they all taught the same thing a methodist would look like a methodist because they all taught the same thing a catholic will look like a cat because they're all taught the same thing and so on and so on they all taught their various church doctrines and teachings and whatever they say is to espouse that it's to grow that their cross land and sea to to make another one see it the way they see it according to their view of the bible so they're given these bible scripts according to bible teachers and bible studies and then they'll try to live up to that but listen friends the true seed of god is not like that the true seed of god listens to the word of jesus when he said seek not what you shall see or do when you are brought before judges and kings and governors are into high places don't you worry about it for my father that dwells in you he will speak through you he will be the one that will do the works or praise god now that is god living his life through the believer it's god living his life they don't have to put on a mask because god lives and speaks and moves and have his being true and in them they are a living manifestation of the very personality and presence of the living god hallelujah children of the living god not carried away led by their denominational religious teachings sons and daughters of god are led by the spirit of almighty god and as the bible says the wind blows where it listed and no man knows or where it goes so is everyone that is led by the spirit who has seen the wind you have seen the effects but who has seen the wind my friends that is what revelation does in the life of a true believer the devil cannot trace you the devil cannot follow what next you're going to do what next you're going to say how you're going to act under certain conditions he does not know because you are walking moving and acting by the blessed holy spirit praise god hallelujah aren't you happy for the holy spirit in your life and in your walk praise god hallelujah my friends i think of all these people whether they're being churches whether they're being their individual life but they have been living a life of constant acting asking for their neighbors acting for their friends acting for their family putting on a front painting up a front doing something contrary to the will and the word of god now jesus totally taught against any form of acting and we know as i've said before that satan is one of the greatest actors and thus a deceiver and liar and his children and his associates also will be that way and most modern day christianity is made up of lots of religious acting and religious drama rather than the real life of jesus christ expressing itself in and through the individual the children of heaven have been worn by jesus christ himself be not as the hypocrites the hypocrites the actors the pretenders the plastic christians the put on christians are don't ever be a religious actor who consciously or unconsciously act out the things that were just taught to you rather than seeing it receiving it by revelation and the holy spirit i encourage you my friends be yourself in christ to do that take off that mask if you are at this time you have been wearing a religious mask whether in the message out the message wherever you are take off your mask you don't have to live up to people's uh you know opinions but just live the normal life let your good and let your evil be openly seen and recognize god will forgive you ask for forgiveness and if there are real friends and brethren around you they'll know how to pray for you that god will bless you and use you amen live like real sons and daughters of the living god that are led by the holy spirit repent take off your mask take off that front amen take it off if you've been wearing it and surrender your all surrender your life [Music] fully to the lord jesus christ my friends whatever facade you might have been presenting let it fall let it drop let it pass away and live the way god wants you to live be reverent be humble just be normal and god will bless you god bless you my friends it's good to have been here another week may the holy spirit bless you watch over you until we meet again or come together again this coming wednesday we will be teaching again on this seven church ages be there god bless you [Music] you
