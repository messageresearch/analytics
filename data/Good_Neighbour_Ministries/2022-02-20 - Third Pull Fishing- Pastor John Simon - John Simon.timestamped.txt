[40:33] of god
[40:34] and i will not take
[40:37] a lot of
[40:39] preliminary talk but i'll go
[40:42] right to the word and if there's
[40:45] anything i need to say then i'll say it
[40:47] afterwards welcome to the house of the

[40:54] every one of you we thank god for his
[40:56] marvelous wonderful grace
[40:59] hallelujah
[41:00] amen
[41:02] okay
[41:04] let's read from god's word john chapter
[41:07] 21
[41:15] and we are going to read from 1 to 40.
[41:21] and
[41:22] today i'm just going to talk about
[41:24] fishing
[41:27] no it's
[41:28] i know it's a funny subject but
[41:32] we want to talk about fishing because
[41:35] it's getting on to that time now the
[41:37] year so i got to turn your attention
[41:39] away from all the things that are going
[41:41] on and everything else as long as none
[41:43] of you were up in ottawa
[41:46] and uh
[41:47] anything of that nature but you keep
[41:49] your feet on the ground being spiritual
[41:52] and walking in the light amen praise the
[41:54] lord those things are not our things we
[41:57] just look at them and see them happening
[41:59] all around us
[42:01] scriptures being fulfilled the word of
[42:03] god come in the past
[42:04] and we just stay away from that sort of
[42:07] thing
[42:08] and we stay right within the confines of
[42:10] god's word amen that's where we are
[42:13] praise the lord hallelujah doesn't mean
[42:16] that we are
[42:18] disinterested
[42:20] because he says watch
[42:22] so so it's not that we're disinterested
[42:25] but we don't get ourselves caught up
[42:26] into those things
[42:28] because we know they must happen things
[42:31] will wax worse and worse
[42:34] and anybody that tells you i'm going to
[42:36] make things better and better we know
[42:38] they're lying
[42:40] right because the master himself said
[42:43] it'll wax worse and worse
[42:45] and say oh i'm going to chicken in every
[42:47] pot
[42:49] every household will have every no the
[42:52] poor you will have with you always till
[42:54] i come back
[42:56] right so
[42:58] those are things that we just know that
[43:01] will happen praise the lord
[43:04] amen out of the word of god john chapter
[43:07] 21
[43:08] reading from verse one
[43:11] after these things
[43:13] jesus showed himself again to the
[43:16] disciples at the sea of tiberias
[43:20] and on this wise shoe himself
[43:24] there were together simon peter
[43:27] thomas called didymus
[43:30] and nathaniel of cana in galilee
[43:34] the sons of zebedee
[43:36] and two other disciples
[43:39] simon peter
[43:41] said unto them
[43:43] i go fishing
[43:46] they say unto him
[43:48] we also go with thee
[43:51] they went forth and entered into a ship
[43:55] immediately and that night
[43:58] they caught nothing
[44:00] but when the morning
[44:02] the sun rose of course
[44:04] when the morning was now come
[44:07] jesus stood on the shore
[44:10] but the disciples knew not that it was
[44:15] jesus
[44:17] then jesus said unto them children
[44:19] have you any meat
[44:21] they answered him no
[44:24] and he said unto them cast thy net on
[44:27] the right side
[44:29] of the ship
[44:31] and you shall find
[44:34] and they cast therefore and now they
[44:36] were not able to draw it for the
[44:38] multitude of fishes
[44:40] therefore
[44:41] the disciple whom jesus loves
[44:44] said unto peter it is the lord
[44:48] now when peter heard that it was the
[44:49] lord he got his fish's coat upon him for
[44:52] he was naked
[44:54] and it cast himself into the sea
[44:58] and the other disciples came in i wish a
[45:01] lot of believers would do that in the
[45:04] sea of the word of god
[45:06] just throw your self-abundant self and
[45:10] everything else and just jump into the
[45:12] sea
[45:14] and the other disciples came in a little
[45:18] ship
[45:19] for they were not far from land
[45:23] but as it were 200 cubits drop dragging
[45:26] the net with fishes
[45:27] and as soon as they were come to land
[45:30] they saw a fire of coals
[45:33] and there and fish laying there on
[45:38] and bread
[45:39] and jesus said unto them bring of the
[45:42] fish
[45:43] which you
[45:44] now caught
[45:48] simon went up and drew the net to land
[45:51] full of great fishes 153
[45:56] and for all there was so
[45:58] many yet was not the net broken
[46:04] this net can't be broken
[46:06] jesus said unto them
[46:09] come and die
[46:11] and none of the disciples just asked him
[46:14] who art thou
[46:16] knowing that it was the lord by then
[46:18] they knew it was the lord indeed
[46:21] jesus then cometh and take it bread give
[46:24] it them
[46:25] and fish
[46:27] this is now the third time
[46:30] that jesus showed himself to his
[46:32] disciples
[46:33] after
[46:34] that he was risen from the dead
[46:37] lord jesus
[46:39] we thank you for thy word we pray that
[46:42] you will bless your people as we gather
[46:44] here together in your wonderful and
[46:47] precious name
[46:49] amen and amen god bless you please be
[46:51] seated
[47:00] as i said to you
[47:02] you know i want to talk about fishing
[47:07] praise god
[47:10] and uh
[47:12] you know
[47:12] [Music]
[47:14] i thank god that i've always loved
[47:16] fishing
[47:18] since i was a boy
[47:20] of about 10 years old i love fishing and
[47:25] you who are here you know spring is on
[47:27] the way how many knows that we're in
[47:29] february but spring is on the way
[47:33] and um
[47:35] as i said as a
[47:37] year old boy
[47:38] i love to hear
[47:40] to go fishing
[47:42] and hear the whispers of the wind
[47:44] just rustling through the trees
[47:48] and that white voice that came from out
[47:51] of the wind
[47:52] as if some
[47:54] one was talking with me
[47:57] and during those times
[48:00] i was a kind of a not kind of i was a
[48:04] loner
[48:05] and
[48:07] spent many many long hours
[48:10] alone with the wind and in the
[48:14] by the streams
[48:16] i got punished for that many times
[48:18] because
[48:19] you're spending whole day nobody knows
[48:21] where you're gone
[48:23] and you're wandering in the woods
[48:26] which
[48:28] you know
[48:29] animals there
[48:30] see snakes passing through the trees and
[48:33] things like that and
[48:35] not bothered by it and
[48:37] and so quiet the fish jumping in the
[48:40] streams you know
[48:41] and splashing around having a great
[48:44] wonderful time
[48:46] many years passed with that
[48:49] and then i god led me by his spirit here
[48:53] into canada
[48:55] and
[48:56] i still love fishing i didn't lose my
[48:59] love of fishing by coming to canada i
[49:01] still love to fish
[49:03] and so i made a lot of trips up into
[49:07] northern ontario
[49:09] and some brothers seated right here can
[49:11] remember a few can remember some of
[49:14] those
[49:14] trips where we went up
[49:18] uh by brother gee's
[49:21] aunt's place there
[49:23] on lake tamagomi
[49:25] and uh spent many summers going up there
[49:30] the men some men in the church many of
[49:32] the men in the church going up to this
[49:35] lake and we'd go up there fishing i'm
[49:38] looking at her brother brian here and
[49:40] the trick i pulled on him
[49:43] while we were up there in the tent
[49:46] you know i kind of came in
[49:49] and scraped like it was a beers
[49:53] on the outside of the tent and got them
[49:55] all worked up anyway
[49:58] so we were having great grand wonderful
[50:01] times there going fishing together
[50:04] and um
[50:06] one of the trips we made was also up on
[50:09] the french river we stayed in a lodge in
[50:12] the french river there and went fishing
[50:15] every day every day we would go out
[50:16] fishing and come back
[50:19] but you know i always love fishing also
[50:23] for perch
[50:25] how many knows what what what's a perch
[50:27] okay well i love fishing for perch and
[50:30] as a result
[50:32] i used to go with brother don jukes
[50:35] which was a young
[50:37] brother
[50:38] um
[50:39] an executive for the maple leafs at the
[50:42] time one of the controlling executors uh
[50:45] executives
[50:46] and uh he was his son
[50:48] and he's the one that had heard me in
[50:51] alberta and when he got here he had
[50:54] talked about the message to a few people
[50:56] and
[50:57] they believed but he didn't know what
[50:59] else to tell them so he invited me to
[51:02] come and this church is a result of that
[51:05] not going through the long thing of that
[51:08] but that's what happened
[51:10] but we used to go to the niagara gorge
[51:13] uh with with uh with our implements and
[51:16] began to fish and we would be catching
[51:19] tons and tons of perch and my there's
[51:23] nothing like having a bunch of
[51:25] fried portion
[51:27] just one after the other they're going
[51:29] down and
[51:31] they were just lovely fish praise god
[51:34] but one year i began to taste the
[51:37] chemicals
[51:39] i tasted chemicals in the fish
[51:43] and
[51:44] i said this is a simon i said that's it
[51:48] i'm not going back there anymore that's
[51:50] long before the government even
[51:51] announced about these companies dumping
[51:54] chemicals into the lake
[51:56] but it was already catching in the fish
[51:59] and i tasted in the fish and
[52:01] we stopped going and catching any fish
[52:04] there but it was wonderful
[52:07] long lonely hours spent there uh
[52:10] together praise god
[52:13] now you know that fishing is a wonderful
[52:15] thing to do how many knows that it's a
[52:18] wonderful thing to do listen to brother
[52:20] branham
[52:22] now it's hot
[52:24] and we're going fishing
[52:26] and you know the lord don't lock any
[52:30] time to a man when he is fishing
[52:35] you don't get any older
[52:38] while you are fishing
[52:42] now you girls
[52:44] you are to go to
[52:47] [Laughter]
[52:49] you ought to go with them
[52:52] amen see
[52:54] and i'll come down and i'll join you if
[52:57] i can
[52:58] oh the good lord don't lock time to a
[53:02] man
[53:03] when he's out fishing
[53:05] do a lot of it when you feel like when
[53:07] you get all twisted up
[53:10] that's the best thing
[53:13] to get you to relax
[53:16] it's the best thing that i ever found in
[53:19] my life
[53:21] is for me to go fishing
[53:24] see
[53:25] that's the way it is
[53:27] there was a gentleman i knew up in
[53:30] new albany
[53:31] his name was mr trout man
[53:36] and he had a little card on it and on
[53:38] the card were written these two words
[53:42] out fishing
[53:44] every time
[53:47] man would get to him he'd have that card
[53:50] out fishing
[53:52] man is closer to god
[53:55] when he's out fishing
[53:58] when man is out fishing rich and poor
[54:02] are all the same
[54:04] when they are out fishing
[54:06] see
[54:07] oh my
[54:09] i'll tell you another fishing i've been
[54:11] doing anyway
[54:13] but i've been doing that for the last
[54:15] 33 years
[54:17] has been fishing for the souls of men
[54:21] may the lord help us
[54:23] to win
[54:24] everyone
[54:25] that we can
[54:28] oh praise god friends
[54:30] i want to take for a subject today
[54:33] third pull fishing
[54:37] now
[54:39] you know
[54:40] that was natural fishing that i loved
[54:43] brother branham loved and he encouraged
[54:45] us
[54:46] to do a lot of fishing let me not just
[54:49] let me just outline something here
[54:51] quickly some benefits of of going
[54:54] fishing one
[54:55] your perception of time changes
[54:58] when you're out fishing you lose sense
[55:00] of time
[55:01] you break into a little edge of eternity
[55:05] when you go fishing
[55:07] and also like he said it gives you peace
[55:10] of mind
[55:12] relaxation
[55:14] and lastly
[55:16] it helps to prolong your life
[55:19] when you go fishing right so fishing is
[55:22] very important that doesn't mean that
[55:24] this summer i'm every this church is
[55:26] going to become a fishing church
[55:30] and everybody is going to be running
[55:32] everywhere but fishing is very very good
[55:36] for you
[55:37] praise the lord god bless brother paul
[55:39] and mark and whoever wherever they are
[55:41] now they must be shouting hallelujah
[55:45] because they always love fishing but
[55:47] they don't know why amen but fishing is
[55:51] a very good thing to do
[55:53] but you see
[55:55] the one who puts his stamp upon it is
[55:57] the lord jesus himself
[56:00] because jesus himself loved fishing
[56:03] praise god
[56:04] and
[56:05] uh he called out his first disciples
[56:08] from where
[56:09] the fisher man
[56:11] you see these men whose occupation it
[56:14] was to catch fish
[56:16] jesus called them first as his disciples
[56:21] because he himself
[56:23] loved fishing
[56:25] praise god
[56:26] but you see the fish that he loved was a
[56:29] different kind of fish
[56:32] because the first fish he caught when he
[56:34] came to earth
[56:36] was some fisherman
[56:39] he was a fisher not of regular fish
[56:43] but he was a fisher of man
[56:47] and god wants us to be
[56:49] fishers of men
[56:51] not only to go about catching a whole
[56:54] lot of fish baskets of it big ones small
[56:56] ones but he wants us to catch man
[56:59] wherever we are
[57:01] praise god catch them with the word of
[57:04] god
[57:05] praise the lord jesus christ hallelujah
[57:09] so
[57:10] who was the great fisherman peter
[57:13] no
[57:14] jesus is the great fisherman
[57:17] jesus christ himself is the great
[57:20] fisherman
[57:21] don't let your eyes be diverted in any
[57:23] way
[57:24] because it's not peter that was the
[57:27] great fisherman but jesus christ is the
[57:31] great fisherman indeed peter was a great
[57:34] fisherman but he is not the great
[57:37] fisherman the great fisherman is jesus
[57:41] christ follow me and i will make you
[57:45] fishers of men how many of you want to
[57:48] follow him
[57:50] praise god everybody in here wants to
[57:53] continue to follow him matthew chapter 4
[57:57] praise the lord
[57:59] when jesus had heard that john was cast
[58:01] into prison
[58:03] he departed onto galilee leaving
[58:07] nazareth
[58:08] and dwelt in capernaum which was upon
[58:11] the sea coast in the borders of zebulun
[58:13] and neptalim
[58:15] and it might that it might be fulfilled
[58:17] that which was spoken by isaias the
[58:20] prophet saying the land of zabulon the
[58:23] land of not telling by the way of the
[58:25] sea
[58:26] beyond jordan galilee of the gentiles
[58:30] the people which suck in darkness
[58:33] have saw great light unto them which sat
[58:37] in the regions and the shadow of death
[58:39] light is sprung up from that time jesus
[58:43] began to preach
[58:45] the kingdom repent for the kingdom of
[58:48] heaven is at hand
[58:50] and jesus walking by the sea of galilee
[58:53] saw two brethren
[58:56] hallelujah and god bless those of us who
[58:59] were able to go to israel
[59:02] because we were we actually went to the
[59:04] spot
[59:06] and the big rock is there where jesus
[59:08] actually went and roasted the fish
[59:12] uh and gave to them
[59:14] and of course a big uh
[59:17] church they built on the shore away from
[59:19] there but the rock is still there
[59:22] and um we find that
[59:25] jesus called
[59:27] peter and andrew his brother casting a
[59:29] net in the sea for they were fishers
[59:32] and he said unto them
[59:34] follow me
[59:37] and i will make you
[59:39] fishes of men verse 22 and immediately
[59:43] they left the ship they left their
[59:47] father
[59:48] and they followed him
[59:51] praise god hallelujah praise the name of
[59:54] the lord jesus christ thank god
[59:57] i love fishing
[59:59] the disciples love fishing jesus loved
[1:00:01] fishing
[1:00:02] we come down we find that brother
[1:00:04] branham love fishing
[1:00:06] and often would go off fishing
[1:00:08] and we know
[1:00:10] as a natural fisherman he was a great
[1:00:13] fisher everybody tells about it that he
[1:00:16] was a great fisherman naturally speaking
[1:00:19] and when it comes to spiritual fishing
[1:00:22] he was the greatest fisherman
[1:00:26] that we have ever had outside of the
[1:00:28] lord himself
[1:00:30] he is the greatest fisherman let me use
[1:00:32] the modern term evangelists
[1:00:35] that the world has ever seen
[1:00:39] so operating in that office and gift of
[1:00:42] the 20th century prophet and the
[1:00:45] evangelist
[1:00:47] he had great success and blessings of
[1:00:49] god that came upon him bringing millions
[1:00:54] and millions of people
[1:00:57] into these denominations
[1:01:00] because he was under
[1:01:02] inspiration
[1:01:04] of the first pull
[1:01:05] and the second pose
[1:01:08] but spiritually
[1:01:10] though he was a prophet
[1:01:13] and even though he was the greatest
[1:01:15] evangelist
[1:01:17] under that first and second pull
[1:01:20] of the seventh church age
[1:01:23] we know
[1:01:24] that he didn't really know how to fish
[1:01:29] for god's elect
[1:01:31] for god's rainbow trout
[1:01:34] for god's big fish
[1:01:36] he didn't know that kind of fishing
[1:01:39] but when it comes to evangelism for
[1:01:41] spoiled second book oh he was a master
[1:01:44] of that
[1:01:45] and god used him in a mighty way because
[1:01:48] he was only doing first and second pull
[1:01:51] fishing
[1:01:52] that appeal to the senses and stuff like
[1:01:54] that
[1:01:55] but now
[1:01:57] the angel came to him and says you don't
[1:01:59] know how to fish
[1:02:01] you don't know how a man that is a
[1:02:03] master of fishing in the natural is
[1:02:06] being told by the angel of god you don't
[1:02:08] know how to fish
[1:02:10] let me teach you how to fish
[1:02:13] because this is a kind of a different
[1:02:16] fishing
[1:02:17] you're not fishing for fish to eat
[1:02:20] you're not fishing for for any natural
[1:02:23] fish you're fishing to find god's elect
[1:02:28] it might be the last one in the lake
[1:02:31] it might be five in that lake
[1:02:35] it might be fifty maybe a hundred maybe
[1:02:37] a thousand in the lake but you are only
[1:02:41] heat up
[1:02:42] to look for the elected
[1:02:45] bride of jesus christ in your day in
[1:02:48] your hour your time the spirit of god
[1:02:52] and the anointing now is not a forceful
[1:02:55] check and pull anointing but the
[1:02:57] anointing of the third toe that appeals
[1:03:00] to that bright class of saints the
[1:03:03] rainbow trout that is being fished out
[1:03:06] of the of the great uh sea of god in
[1:03:10] this day and in this hour he didn't know
[1:03:12] how to fish
[1:03:14] amen for god's elect
[1:03:17] for god's lost
[1:03:19] attributes
[1:03:22] for god's lost genes
[1:03:24] just passing over a thought there you
[1:03:27] can't you can't say something is lost if
[1:03:30] somebody didn't have it
[1:03:32] somebody had to own it and have it
[1:03:35] before it could be lost
[1:03:37] and jesus said i am come to seek and to
[1:03:40] save them that are lost hallelujah amen
[1:03:44] you have a lot of sheep of the house all
[1:03:45] of israel believers and believing but
[1:03:49] that's wonderful what i come to seek and
[1:03:51] save them that are lost
[1:03:54] whosoever will may come but i'm looking
[1:03:58] for the elected seed the genuine elect
[1:04:02] of god the genes of god sons and
[1:04:05] daughters of god come from the mind of
[1:04:07] god those are the ones that i come to
[1:04:09] see conceive
[1:04:11] hallelujah
[1:04:13] sons and daughters in the last day lost
[1:04:16] in this little dish and darkness
[1:04:19] wondering about not knowing what they
[1:04:22] are to do
[1:04:23] who they are where they come from all
[1:04:26] their purpose in life amen and wandering
[1:04:29] around in
[1:04:30] unbelief
[1:04:32] oh my
[1:04:34] praise god hallelujah oh brother sister
[1:04:38] i thank god for his grace and for his
[1:04:40] goodness
[1:04:43] now he's talking about one morning
[1:04:45] he lay on his bed and he was just
[1:04:48] talking to his wife he said sister meter
[1:04:50] was on one side of the bed i was on the
[1:04:52] other side of the bed and we were just
[1:04:55] talking away early that morning
[1:04:58] and suddenly the vision atmosphere
[1:05:00] vision came upon him he says here and i
[1:05:04] he showed me a vision of a panoramic
[1:05:07] view of people
[1:05:08] i never seen
[1:05:10] i was talking to my wife
[1:05:13] while i was going into the vision
[1:05:15] now you people know i'm not a fanatic i
[1:05:18] don't say them things unless they are
[1:05:20] truth amen see then after a while i
[1:05:24] couldn't hear or
[1:05:25] hear her or see her
[1:05:27] and i but when i looked i seen brother
[1:05:32] argent standing there
[1:05:34] and he said brother billy
[1:05:36] will give out all the prayer cards
[1:05:38] everything is ready now for the meeting
[1:05:41] i will go
[1:05:43] take you in
[1:05:44] amen and i said thank you brother
[1:05:48] now this is the first time
[1:05:50] the message has ever been given
[1:05:53] right out here through the microphone to
[1:05:55] the people right this will go into all
[1:05:58] them religious papers like voice of
[1:06:00] healing herald of is coming
[1:06:03] and all like that
[1:06:05] and in some glorious day
[1:06:08] when it's all over
[1:06:10] i'm long gone
[1:06:12] we'll meet around his throne
[1:06:15] at what time we will what a time you'll
[1:06:18] have
[1:06:19] remember
[1:06:20] it's not just me out there
[1:06:24] in the service
[1:06:25] i have just a little part to do with it
[1:06:29] it's
[1:06:30] you back there amen
[1:06:33] he realized by then he is leaving
[1:06:37] right
[1:06:38] he only introduce it and he just have a
[1:06:41] little part in it
[1:06:44] and he has to move out but it's the rest
[1:06:47] of you back there
[1:06:49] that are coming
[1:06:51] you'd want
[1:06:52] this really is going to
[1:06:55] i just
[1:06:56] see that
[1:06:57] amen
[1:06:59] praise god
[1:07:00] hallelujah now i'm speaking from the
[1:07:02] message called what is a vision and that
[1:07:05] will be the background because really
[1:07:06] now i'm beginning to speak right and
[1:07:09] what is a vision
[1:07:12] now i don't expect you to understand
[1:07:15] this what i'm saying now i'm quoting him
[1:07:18] now brother brown
[1:07:20] but
[1:07:21] you see
[1:07:22] you there's something there
[1:07:25] but we'll understand when we meet face
[1:07:29] to face with jesus
[1:07:31] and you you and his cameras like that
[1:07:34] you understand why he stammers because
[1:07:35] that angel already tell him don't tell
[1:07:38] nobody
[1:07:40] don't say nothing about this
[1:07:43] it can't be impersonated
[1:07:45] amen
[1:07:46] remember it's all this
[1:07:49] is on the word
[1:07:53] amen
[1:07:54] but with that vision i seen two little
[1:07:57] dark-faced children
[1:07:59] come moving pulling a little wagon
[1:08:03] and i said sweetheart look here
[1:08:05] and she said
[1:08:07] what are you talking about you see
[1:08:10] i could hear her
[1:08:12] i could hear her
[1:08:14] but i couldn't answer her while in the
[1:08:17] vision
[1:08:18] and these little children were walking
[1:08:20] towards me little kind of long hair
[1:08:22] black dark eyes brown face walking up to
[1:08:25] me and i seen them amen see so that's
[1:08:29] what it was
[1:08:31] and
[1:08:32] which way
[1:08:34] shall i go i said to the brother
[1:08:36] and he said just keep walking
[1:08:39] amen keep on
[1:08:41] and i kept walking
[1:08:43] and soon i walked past all them other
[1:08:47] ministers
[1:08:49] you listen i i don't want to break into
[1:08:51] all these little little passing things
[1:08:53] right
[1:08:55] and when i walked further
[1:08:57] i came into a great panorama
[1:09:01] right
[1:09:02] seated worth thousands and thousands of
[1:09:04] people and then i heard somebody say i
[1:09:08] heard a voice say the meeting
[1:09:11] is dismissed
[1:09:14] and i said well who can dismiss it
[1:09:17] amen who can dismiss it and why is it
[1:09:20] dismissed
[1:09:22] and that's what happened it was
[1:09:25] dismissed what he didn't understand is
[1:09:28] that god was allowing the first and
[1:09:29] second pull to come to their end it
[1:09:32] doesn't mean they're gone
[1:09:34] because it will that will always follow
[1:09:36] the bride
[1:09:37] as god's people that will all we don't
[1:09:40] follow after science but the signs
[1:09:44] follow us because we believe
[1:09:46] it just comes because it has to be there
[1:09:50] to manifest and to demonstrate
[1:09:53] god in his word and in his people praise
[1:09:57] the lord he said and when that happened
[1:10:01] when that meeting was dismissed
[1:10:04] suddenly it began to sprinkle rain
[1:10:08] hallelujah oh thank god brothers
[1:10:11] back then it was sprinkling
[1:10:13] that was just like elijah being in the
[1:10:16] in the cave and saying i see the coming
[1:10:19] of the abundance of rain hallelujah it's
[1:10:22] sprinkling now but it's going to be a
[1:10:25] great big rainfall amen praise god
[1:10:28] hallelujah and then i went further
[1:10:33] into the vision
[1:10:35] and i was standing there
[1:10:38] you know
[1:10:39] with a little baby's shoe
[1:10:42] amen how many knows what a shoe is for
[1:10:45] a shoe is something to aid you with your
[1:10:48] walk
[1:10:49] or in walk in
[1:10:50] right so uh something that will help the
[1:10:53] people with their walk with god
[1:10:56] but god is showing that they their
[1:10:59] babies now but you you've got to start
[1:11:02] letting them see
[1:11:04] the fullness of this thing um
[1:11:07] but
[1:11:07] you try you can't listen to those big
[1:11:09] truths
[1:11:11] you can't lace it with all those massive
[1:11:14] things it's got to start little by
[1:11:17] little right praise god
[1:11:20] so
[1:11:21] he said they only had little bitty
[1:11:25] islets they can only take so much
[1:11:28] because they come up on the pentecostal
[1:11:30] denomination you don't mind me talking
[1:11:32] like this
[1:11:33] amen all right great see
[1:11:36] these were ones that did not have on a
[1:11:40] little booty
[1:11:42] you know what's a booty
[1:11:43] you know when the women just make those
[1:11:45] little uh he sees there these were ones
[1:11:49] that already had on a shoe
[1:11:52] but it was a baby's shoe
[1:11:56] amen
[1:11:57] and i had
[1:11:59] this in my hand to lace this little
[1:12:02] eight of an inch hole
[1:12:05] and i was trying to push a half inch
[1:12:08] right
[1:12:09] part of that string
[1:12:12] through
[1:12:13] the half inch that
[1:12:15] eighth of an inch eyelet see
[1:12:18] and the treads were breaking all over he
[1:12:21] was messing up things
[1:12:23] right
[1:12:23] causing all kinds of impersonations and
[1:12:26] things like that and trying to lace it
[1:12:29] like that anyway
[1:12:31] then i heard someone behind me say
[1:12:34] don't you understand
[1:12:36] you can't teach
[1:12:39] babies
[1:12:40] and he left out the word pentecostal but
[1:12:42] he said you can't teach babies
[1:12:46] supernatural things
[1:12:49] i looked around and it was behind me
[1:12:52] and i recognized the voice that spoke
[1:12:54] with me and he said you're using the
[1:12:57] wrong end of the string
[1:13:00] amen
[1:13:02] and i look down at the end of the string
[1:13:04] laying on the floor
[1:13:06] and the other end was a nice
[1:13:09] eighth of an inch
[1:13:11] so
[1:13:13] i told him i understand
[1:13:15] in other words he understands god hides
[1:13:18] in simplicity
[1:13:20] and reveals himself in the same
[1:13:22] why are you trying to bring all those
[1:13:24] heavy things on them when they're just
[1:13:26] babies
[1:13:27] start from god's hiding in simplicity
[1:13:29] with the little things
[1:13:31] and little by little lace the shoe
[1:13:34] right
[1:13:35] okay praise god he says and soon when i
[1:13:39] told him i understood
[1:13:41] and i reached down to pick up that
[1:13:44] string
[1:13:45] i was taken up
[1:13:48] in the spirit
[1:13:49] mark this down
[1:13:51] watch this will come to pass
[1:13:54] as i
[1:13:56] reach down i was taken up
[1:13:58] and when i come to
[1:14:00] i was standing by the side
[1:14:02] of a beautiful lake
[1:14:05] with blue clear water
[1:14:07] hallelujah
[1:14:09] and
[1:14:11] it's so pretty
[1:14:13] and i saw all the fish small big fish
[1:14:17] swimming around
[1:14:19] in that beautiful lake hallelujah i'm so
[1:14:22] glad that no matter the muddy
[1:14:25] nonsense that was out there in this
[1:14:27] message somehow god gave his elected
[1:14:31] children of god the vision to be able to
[1:14:34] see clearly in the word of god and to be
[1:14:37] able to move through all the things in
[1:14:40] the word of god to this day many of them
[1:14:43] don't even realize that god allowed
[1:14:45] brother branham himself to say things
[1:14:47] that will throw them off on the tangent
[1:14:50] like he said in unveiling of god he says
[1:14:53] oh many of the things i said and done
[1:14:55] were deliberately said and done
[1:14:58] amen to make some go out to make others
[1:15:02] come in
[1:15:04] to make some wonder praise god and
[1:15:07] others to believe praise the lord jesus
[1:15:10] hallelujah amen he said didn't the lord
[1:15:13] jesus do the same thing when he spoke in
[1:15:16] parables deliberately to blind some and
[1:15:19] others to open their eyes my god
[1:15:22] brothers we're in the midst of it right
[1:15:23] now by this word of god this hour and
[1:15:26] the time we're living in
[1:15:29] hallelujah praise god let me let me just
[1:15:33] stop here a minute from another
[1:15:36] another time he was telling the same
[1:15:38] vision he said when he walked in and
[1:15:40] they said the meeting is dismissed just
[1:15:43] before he dis they dismissed it was just
[1:15:46] enough they just run around quickly and
[1:15:48] they took up the offerings
[1:15:52] he said how come the meeting is
[1:15:54] dismissed already
[1:15:57] you know there's been no preaching no
[1:15:59] work nothing gone forth they said oh
[1:16:01] that's all right we already got the
[1:16:03] offering
[1:16:06] we already got the offering you see my
[1:16:08] friends i'm not preaching on that i just
[1:16:11] pass that that you can go look at you
[1:16:13] can search it yourself the emphasis in
[1:16:16] these groups these the denominations and
[1:16:20] these people even in this message
[1:16:22] they're emphasizing now they're offering
[1:16:26] the tithes taking up the tithes taking
[1:16:29] up the offering and they don't see the
[1:16:31] emphasis on the word of god
[1:16:35] amen even the people don't see it
[1:16:39] hallelujah they get the fed up disgusted
[1:16:42] and they are identifying themselves
[1:16:44] because they
[1:16:45] they're showing they don't have the real
[1:16:47] test on the inside that
[1:16:50] they're living by the ever-present water
[1:16:52] in the rock
[1:16:54] but in the other ones for a second full
[1:16:57] and the brook dried up
[1:17:00] there was no more supply because that
[1:17:03] phase was over and done with
[1:17:07] but when i got to that lake
[1:17:10] there were some fishermen
[1:17:13] all around the lake
[1:17:16] and he said
[1:17:18] them fishermen
[1:17:19] are really ministers
[1:17:23] ministers out there looking for fish
[1:17:27] just like you
[1:17:28] amen there knows in other words i'm
[1:17:31] talking now they know something is going
[1:17:33] on
[1:17:34] they know what it is
[1:17:36] so they start fishing
[1:17:39] uh
[1:17:40] take the meaning and the thoughts of
[1:17:41] that word in all of its ramifications
[1:17:45] they start fishing around
[1:17:48] they start questioning this believer
[1:17:50] asking over there
[1:17:51] presuming over there trying to look
[1:17:54] under this rock look over there to find
[1:17:57] out what is going on
[1:18:00] but this is not the first and second
[1:18:02] poll
[1:18:02] this will not my friends be impersonated
[1:18:07] you can't even tell what happened to you
[1:18:14] you just know you're seeing something
[1:18:17] the perfect realization has struck your
[1:18:20] soul
[1:18:22] you can't escape it
[1:18:25] you haven't got him now he has got you
[1:18:28] i haven't got the holy ghost the holy
[1:18:31] ghost has got all of me
[1:18:33] i am now a prisoner of jesus christ by
[1:18:36] the power of the holy spirit
[1:18:38] oh blessed be the name of the lord god
[1:18:41] hallelujah
[1:18:42] amen
[1:18:44] oh my you see
[1:18:46] they
[1:18:47] wanted
[1:18:48] to catch fish too
[1:18:51] great big beautiful
[1:18:54] rainbow trout
[1:18:56] were out there in that lake
[1:18:59] oh my
[1:19:01] and then i said to him i know this is a
[1:19:03] vision but i don't understand all about
[1:19:06] this all about this trout and i'm
[1:19:08] quoting him here he said i don't
[1:19:10] understand what it is about my catching
[1:19:14] the trout
[1:19:15] see
[1:19:16] but he said
[1:19:17] you know
[1:19:19] but i said you know i believe right down
[1:19:23] in my heart that i can catch those ones
[1:19:27] also
[1:19:28] amen not only them under the first
[1:19:31] second ball but i can catch these ones
[1:19:34] also
[1:19:36] other ministers were trying to catch
[1:19:38] those rainbow trout hallelujah but you
[1:19:42] see they really couldn't catch them
[1:19:45] all they could do is keep catching small
[1:19:47] fish
[1:19:49] because the rainbow trout is a type of
[1:19:51] elect
[1:19:53] and the rainbow trousers exactly that
[1:19:55] it's a fish with a covenant promise from
[1:19:58] the living god
[1:20:00] hallelujah and they could not catch
[1:20:03] those fish praise god hallelujah because
[1:20:06] these were ones with a covenant promised
[1:20:09] brother amen
[1:20:10] who am i so i picked up the string
[1:20:14] but now all of a sudden the string that
[1:20:18] was in my hand
[1:20:20] turned into a fishing pole
[1:20:24] it wasn't just a string no more
[1:20:28] hallelujah but
[1:20:30] it turned into a fishing pole
[1:20:33] see
[1:20:34] and there it was hallelujah praise god
[1:20:38] you couldn't go just like a string like
[1:20:40] that to catch trout so now you got to
[1:20:42] have something so he was not gonna go
[1:20:45] into third pool fishing
[1:20:48] are you following me where the team is
[1:20:50] from now uh he's doing third pull
[1:20:52] fishing now and god says you know you
[1:20:55] can't do that with a string you got to
[1:20:57] have a rod to be able to catch these
[1:21:00] fish these rainbow trout hallelujah
[1:21:04] praise god and then the one behind me
[1:21:08] said i'll teach you how to fish
[1:21:12] which is in a backhanded we're saying
[1:21:13] you don't know how to catch these fish
[1:21:17] let me teach you how to catch these fish
[1:21:21] amen
[1:21:22] and then tie under lure and so on throw
[1:21:26] way out i want you to throw it way out
[1:21:29] in the deep for them praise god because
[1:21:32] these ones here not going with no
[1:21:34] shallow shallow stuff no soup mix and
[1:21:37] all this stuff no these ones want to go
[1:21:39] out in the deep amen praise god so you
[1:21:43] got to throw out there where they are
[1:21:45] ready in the deep to catch those fish
[1:21:47] amen so he says now
[1:21:50] i
[1:21:51] throw it out there and i then he says
[1:21:54] when you throw it out to that deep then
[1:21:57] you've got to let your lure sink down
[1:22:00] first
[1:22:02] hallelujah
[1:22:03] that's the word that you've been hearing
[1:22:05] all these years
[1:22:08] in the message let that sink down in
[1:22:11] them first
[1:22:13] and when the words sink down in them
[1:22:15] first
[1:22:16] amen
[1:22:17] then you start
[1:22:19] pulling them slowly or lead them slowly
[1:22:23] into
[1:22:24] this
[1:22:25] turtle
[1:22:26] slowly you pull along and then they'll
[1:22:29] come right over right
[1:22:32] he said now that's good fisherman's
[1:22:34] technique
[1:22:36] now he says when you do that
[1:22:39] you'll begin to feel
[1:22:41] some nibbles
[1:22:43] hallelujah oh thank god brother
[1:22:48] i follow the message as you know since
[1:22:51] uh i mean let me say it from 14 years
[1:22:54] old
[1:22:55] and i've been following the message and
[1:22:57] always at every stage the holy spirit
[1:23:00] he led me to that point i didn't even
[1:23:02] know about brother branham but yet
[1:23:05] casting out a devil out of somebody and
[1:23:07] the devil began to speak in towns and
[1:23:09] the holy spirit said see thomas is not
[1:23:12] the evidence of the holy spirit
[1:23:15] praise god so when i got the message and
[1:23:18] the prophet said that that just comes
[1:23:21] amen i knew that he was right
[1:23:24] hallelujah praise god not me confirming
[1:23:27] that he was right but god put it in me
[1:23:29] long before coming with the message so
[1:23:32] that i could accept the rest of it
[1:23:34] knowing that it's going to be the truth
[1:23:36] because that's right hallelujah praise
[1:23:39] god
[1:23:40] i was already praying
[1:23:43] amen
[1:23:44] in the dark room
[1:23:47] of the
[1:23:48] assembly of god bible school
[1:23:51] down there in south america
[1:23:54] and
[1:23:54] [Music]
[1:23:56] while we're praying
[1:23:57] the desire for in us to pray and ask god
[1:24:01] because we have seen that stuff women
[1:24:04] preaching
[1:24:05] you know
[1:24:07] tongue speaking and then casting all the
[1:24:09] devil out of those people afterwards
[1:24:12] great
[1:24:13] religious singers from england and
[1:24:15] america come down and singing like an
[1:24:18] angel and then back of the scenes when
[1:24:21] we get with them and begin to pray with
[1:24:23] them it's devils having gifts like that
[1:24:26] that were singing and entertaining and
[1:24:28] everything else under the guise of
[1:24:30] religion so god was just bleaching out
[1:24:32] those things so we began to pray lord
[1:24:35] god what is going on what's happening to
[1:24:38] pentecost lord
[1:24:40] show me what is beyond pentecost
[1:24:44] it was just only a month after that
[1:24:46] that this old man who was considered to
[1:24:49] be a prophet down there amen go across
[1:24:52] the country and tell you you're going to
[1:24:53] be your son you this you that and the
[1:24:56] denominations knew him but they hated
[1:24:58] him because
[1:24:59] it would always come to pass they hated
[1:25:02] and they didn't like him amen but
[1:25:04] they couldn't deny who he was so all of
[1:25:07] them wanted him to be around them but
[1:25:09] they wouldn't let him preach
[1:25:12] because somehow he believed in baptizing
[1:25:14] in the name of jesus christ
[1:25:17] and he only believed in one god
[1:25:20] and that's all he knew and that's all he
[1:25:21] was teaching with the rest of what was
[1:25:24] upon him anointing him and he was a
[1:25:26] great person that we pray did a lot of
[1:25:29] praying with at the time before coming
[1:25:32] into the message so when the message
[1:25:35] came to him
[1:25:37] being that he couldn't read and write
[1:25:39] that very well
[1:25:40] uh he always would come to me and
[1:25:43] you know to write letters or do this and
[1:25:46] do that so he came
[1:25:48] and slipped the two books
[1:25:50] under
[1:25:51] my door
[1:25:52] you know because i was at uh the bible
[1:25:55] school and studying and when i came home
[1:25:57] there were the two books and i read them
[1:25:59] the rest is history praise the name of
[1:26:01] the lord hallelujah but you see my
[1:26:04] brothers god has his own plan he makes
[1:26:07] you start to needle
[1:26:09] because the first thing i caught was
[1:26:11] there's only one god
[1:26:14] jesus of the new testament is jehovah
[1:26:17] the old testament i caught that i start
[1:26:19] nibbling at that praise the lord
[1:26:21] then he goes on to another little truth
[1:26:23] that nibble like that keep nibbling here
[1:26:26] nibbling there pieces all around the
[1:26:28] message
[1:26:29] amen nibbling around hallelujah praise
[1:26:32] god and i thank god you're others of you
[1:26:35] that were always nibbling on the word
[1:26:39] something and you having a hunger and a
[1:26:41] thirst that was bringing you and pulling
[1:26:44] you into the presence of almighty god
[1:26:46] hallelujah amen praise god hallelujah oh
[1:26:52] my you see he started something in you
[1:26:55] where you knew there's got to be
[1:26:57] something in the word itself
[1:27:00] hallelujah
[1:27:02] for a little bit he says
[1:27:04] pull slowly
[1:27:06] don't pull hard
[1:27:08] and then
[1:27:09] it'll
[1:27:11] this he said and then when you pull
[1:27:13] slowly it will begin to pull itself away
[1:27:18] from all the rest of them little fish
[1:27:24] seemingly the message will seem like
[1:27:26] it's pulling away
[1:27:28] from the little fish
[1:27:30] and when
[1:27:32] it begins to pull away
[1:27:35] the little fish will scatter
[1:27:38] they'll scatter away from you
[1:27:42] because what you're talking now is
[1:27:43] different from what they hear
[1:27:46] different from what they know
[1:27:48] praise god but he said they will scatter
[1:27:53] but listen
[1:27:54] when them little fish scatter
[1:27:57] that will attract the attention of the
[1:28:00] big fish and they'll gather
[1:28:03] and they'll grab
[1:28:06] at this amen praise god my brothers
[1:28:10] isn't that what's happening right now
[1:28:12] across the little fish to scatter away
[1:28:15] and cause the big fish the rainbow trout
[1:28:18] the redeem gathering in washed like the
[1:28:21] snow free from all sin
[1:28:24] shouting praising god and gathering
[1:28:27] [Applause]
[1:28:34] that you put out there amen i'm grabbing
[1:28:37] at it right now
[1:28:39] every day i'm grabbing
[1:28:41] more
[1:28:42] when i'm done preaching here every
[1:28:45] sunday i don't even know what's coming
[1:28:47] next
[1:28:48] i didn't know this was coming i didn't
[1:28:50] know the other message was coming i have
[1:28:52] to leave here in faith
[1:28:55] believing that god will give me
[1:28:57] something else to say to you amen
[1:29:00] because i know i got to preach to eagles
[1:29:04] when the eagles the illegals got their
[1:29:06] eyes on you
[1:29:07] oh
[1:29:08] man you can't come with no chicken soup
[1:29:11] to feed them no sir you've got to come
[1:29:15] with the water called the power of the
[1:29:17] holy spirit
[1:29:18] amen and only god himself can do that
[1:29:22] it's a reveal his own word hallelujah
[1:29:26] oh
[1:29:26] my
[1:29:27] he said you see
[1:29:29] just grabbed a hold of it and that's
[1:29:33] what happened to us we've seen it
[1:29:35] we're seeing something and you grab a
[1:29:38] hold of it
[1:29:39] and when you grab a hold of it at first
[1:29:41] when this began to break on me i start
[1:29:43] to wonder but you know lord this if this
[1:29:46] is so you you're gonna have to prove it
[1:29:49] you're gonna have to
[1:29:50] demonstrate it for me to be able to see
[1:29:52] more
[1:29:53] and god began to do it but while he's
[1:29:55] doing it he opened the eyes of somebody
[1:29:56] else somebody else somebody else and
[1:29:59] then that began to strengthen me and
[1:30:00] give me confidence that this is the sea
[1:30:04] of the lord
[1:30:07] he says amen
[1:30:09] then i pulled the whole lure out of the
[1:30:13] water and when i did it like that i
[1:30:17] caught
[1:30:18] a fish
[1:30:20] you see
[1:30:21] but because he said pull slow and i did
[1:30:25] a big jerk
[1:30:26] right he's so anxious for everybody to
[1:30:29] come into what he had and what he could
[1:30:32] see
[1:30:33] he tried to jerk the whole thing
[1:30:36] jerk us in you don't jerk nobody and you
[1:30:38] can't bring nobody in
[1:30:40] the holy spirit has to bring you in
[1:30:43] the holy spirit has to open your eyes of
[1:30:45] your heart the holy spirit has revealed
[1:30:48] to you
[1:30:49] praise god
[1:30:51] hallelujah
[1:30:52] oh my
[1:30:54] and so
[1:30:55] because i jerked i pulled the whole lure
[1:30:57] out of the water and i caught a fish
[1:31:00] but when i looked it was just a little
[1:31:03] fish
[1:31:04] and i said oh my and just then the one
[1:31:08] who was talking behind me stepped around
[1:31:11] in front of me
[1:31:13] it was him
[1:31:14] it was the angel of the lord
[1:31:17] and he had his hands folded
[1:31:20] and he looked at me and said
[1:31:23] you did just what i told you
[1:31:26] not to do
[1:31:28] right
[1:31:29] and i said yes sir
[1:31:31] that's right
[1:31:32] he said
[1:31:34] you see
[1:31:36] the first pull
[1:31:38] when i gave that to you
[1:31:40] was when you used to put your hands on
[1:31:42] the people
[1:31:43] and tell them what was their troubles
[1:31:48] then the second pull
[1:31:50] was when i let you know
[1:31:53] what was the secrets of their hearts
[1:31:56] just like i told you
[1:31:59] and said instead of you keeping that to
[1:32:02] yourself
[1:32:04] hallelujah he's not talking about the
[1:32:06] third pull huh
[1:32:07] he's telling him about his action of
[1:32:09] going and talking about this now
[1:32:12] he's trying to say
[1:32:14] you begin to try to explain to them all
[1:32:18] about it
[1:32:19] telling all kinds of things to the
[1:32:21] people and when you did
[1:32:25] you didn't know nothing about it
[1:32:27] yourself
[1:32:28] you didn't know nothing but the turtle
[1:32:31] you didn't know what was coming and you
[1:32:33] went talking about the fourth and second
[1:32:35] poll and explaining to them
[1:32:37] some of it right that's when brother
[1:32:39] branham was in those years talking about
[1:32:41] the senses
[1:32:43] senses of the body five senses uh you
[1:32:46] know and then the five senses of the
[1:32:47] spirit uh imagination and you know that
[1:32:51] sort of stuff like that and then he'd go
[1:32:53] off and he started talking about the
[1:32:55] soul and the different and then you got
[1:32:58] people with the soul gone off people
[1:33:00] with those senses gone off evangelists
[1:33:02] go off trying to discern and trying to
[1:33:05] get visions in the same way by their
[1:33:08] human effort and stuff like that amen
[1:33:11] see oh my
[1:33:13] you see and he said you didn't know
[1:33:16] nothing about his yourself
[1:33:18] amen see
[1:33:20] oh my you began to explain you begin to
[1:33:23] explain about what it is to be a seer
[1:33:26] how you come you got your conscience but
[1:33:28] the seer is somebody where the two
[1:33:31] consciousness come together and they can
[1:33:33] see even when they are awake he says you
[1:33:36] were telling all the people all those
[1:33:38] things that was not for him to do
[1:33:41] he was actually
[1:33:43] going against the word and the will of
[1:33:45] god
[1:33:46] amen he says why you didn't know nothing
[1:33:49] about it yourself and how could you
[1:33:52] explain that to them and you cross
[1:33:55] because of that you cause a great bunch
[1:33:58] of
[1:33:59] impersonations to rise up among the
[1:34:02] people
[1:34:06] and you see now
[1:34:08] what you have done now he's talking now
[1:34:10] about the third quote now i'm trying to
[1:34:13] bring you into this see now what you're
[1:34:16] already
[1:34:17] starting to do
[1:34:18] right
[1:34:19] oh my i said lord i'm sorry
[1:34:23] and he looked at me and said now
[1:34:26] don't you get your lines tangled up in
[1:34:29] these kinds of times
[1:34:31] i've presumed that so you know what that
[1:34:34] is all about don't get your lines all
[1:34:36] tangled up in these kinds of times
[1:34:40] and just then
[1:34:41] i began to feel myself
[1:34:44] going higher and higher
[1:34:47] way up
[1:34:48] into a higher dimension
[1:34:52] and when i was set down
[1:34:56] i was
[1:34:57] beneath a great tent
[1:35:00] i have never seen ever seen such a great
[1:35:02] tent
[1:35:03] amen just for you to understand you know
[1:35:05] the tent really is a type of his message
[1:35:08] we are in a big tent
[1:35:11] right it's like jesus back then called
[1:35:14] his mission uh uh like a fisherman that
[1:35:17] throws a big net in the sea and it bring
[1:35:19] in all kinds
[1:35:21] right but there's gonna be a separation
[1:35:23] time
[1:35:24] when when the trout and the good fish is
[1:35:27] taken out and
[1:35:29] brother branham here is being shown to
[1:35:31] him in the form of a tent
[1:35:33] and in this tent is all kinds of people
[1:35:36] in the tent
[1:35:37] listen if you've been around this
[1:35:39] message which god has blessed me to
[1:35:41] travel to two countries of the world
[1:35:43] preaching the gospel from two people to
[1:35:46] 50 000 people
[1:35:48] and know that they're all kinds in this
[1:35:52] message
[1:35:54] all kinds friends and there my friends
[1:35:58] we find
[1:36:00] that we're in this debt hallelujah and
[1:36:03] i've always been in the state
[1:36:05] amen hallelujah
[1:36:07] amen
[1:36:08] and when i look
[1:36:10] i seem to have i have made an altar call
[1:36:14] you know when he came to the end of the
[1:36:16] church ages there i can't remember fully
[1:36:18] the quote he said this may be
[1:36:22] god's last altar call
[1:36:26] hallelujah
[1:36:28] oh my
[1:36:29] he literally used the words
[1:36:31] this may be god's last altar call
[1:36:34] when he was closing out them seven
[1:36:36] church ages
[1:36:38] right
[1:36:39] now
[1:36:41] and there were hundreds of people around
[1:36:45] the altar there under that tent
[1:36:49] weeping weeping
[1:36:51] because they had accepted jesus and they
[1:36:55] were just weeping out loud amen
[1:36:59] that is those ones which is genuine it's
[1:37:02] genuine repentance is genuine coming to
[1:37:05] the lord but justification as i have
[1:37:08] preached is only one third redemption
[1:37:12] three steps to a birth
[1:37:15] they only had one third
[1:37:17] redemption and they were already
[1:37:19] shouting and screaming and crying and
[1:37:22] everything which is good because that's
[1:37:24] all that in you but now we are up here
[1:37:26] looking back
[1:37:27] and seeing that we understand what it
[1:37:30] was
[1:37:32] and a real kind gentleman walked out to
[1:37:34] the platform
[1:37:36] and said
[1:37:38] amen
[1:37:40] while
[1:37:41] brother branham is resting
[1:37:45] he's already foretelling his death
[1:37:49] he's resting in the sleep of death
[1:37:52] while brother branham is resting what's
[1:37:55] going to go on
[1:37:57] we're still going to call a prayer line
[1:38:00] you see they're still calling the prayer
[1:38:02] lines when the prophet is gone
[1:38:05] they're still under the influence of
[1:38:07] first second book
[1:38:09] they're expecting that ministry to
[1:38:11] repeat again
[1:38:13] they're expecting the third pull
[1:38:15] not to be one of the word
[1:38:18] making itself manifest but of greater
[1:38:21] signs greater wonders greater miracles
[1:38:24] greater things of that nature and
[1:38:26] they're looking in that direction and
[1:38:28] the blast from another one
[1:38:33] see half our silence
[1:38:35] amen
[1:38:36] and he's the devil is looking everywhere
[1:38:38] trying to find him and when he's doing
[1:38:40] like that is blast right off of the
[1:38:41] troll
[1:38:42] praise god hallelujah amen
[1:38:45] oh my
[1:38:47] oh
[1:38:48] and then
[1:38:50] i noticed a prayer line
[1:38:52] and it went all around the tent the
[1:38:56] message
[1:38:57] it went all around the tent
[1:39:00] oh what a prayer line it was hallelujah
[1:39:04] that's the common view in this message
[1:39:05] right now right they have all these
[1:39:08] prayer lines it's okay to have a prayer
[1:39:10] line as i said these things will follow
[1:39:12] us
[1:39:13] but our our uh
[1:39:15] our main thing is not these just pray
[1:39:19] lines healing miracles signs wonders
[1:39:21] wonderful marvelous our thing is jesus
[1:39:24] the word
[1:39:26] jesus the word
[1:39:29] same yesterday today and forever the war
[1:39:33] making itself manifest
[1:39:36] lord of god hallelujah oh you're saying
[1:39:39] that because you're not seeing a lot of
[1:39:41] miracles happening around i don't have
[1:39:42] to see the miracles
[1:39:44] people just pass me and they get
[1:39:46] miracles
[1:39:48] is that right
[1:39:49] they passed peter in the the bible there
[1:39:52] they were healed they didn't even know
[1:39:54] where how they got healed because the
[1:39:55] glory doesn't go to man no more oh i was
[1:39:58] healed when brother simon laid his hands
[1:40:00] on
[1:40:02] oh brother simon become a miracle man no
[1:40:05] god has taken all of that away it's
[1:40:08] going right back it's gone back to this
[1:40:10] the world
[1:40:12] revelation of the world
[1:40:15] hallelujah
[1:40:17] and knowing that
[1:40:19] sometimes i would see people that are
[1:40:20] not even believers
[1:40:22] and i i if i understand or could know
[1:40:26] that such and such is wrong with them
[1:40:28] maybe just stand by them or pass by them
[1:40:31] and i'm praying inside
[1:40:33] i don't go over and say oh brother can i
[1:40:36] pray for you
[1:40:38] if you will kneel in the street here
[1:40:40] i'll pray for you
[1:40:41] that's okay too but it's going away from
[1:40:45] that now
[1:40:46] where only the word gets the glory only
[1:40:49] the world is magnified
[1:40:52] and you get yourself out of the way you
[1:40:54] don't even want to be seen to be known
[1:40:57] to be recognized to be acknowledged you
[1:40:59] don't want it amen
[1:41:01] hallelujah you get away from all of that
[1:41:04] the stuff of the flesh amen

[1:48:32] showing here
[1:48:33] right we're moving away from your second
[1:48:36] pole to this third pole where even you
[1:48:39] can explain it
[1:48:42] even he the prophet couldn't explain it
[1:48:46] hallelujah that's why
[1:48:49] you show him more than we know right now
[1:48:52] and that's why he will totally says you
[1:48:54] don't say nothing about this
[1:48:57] till the day you die don't say nothing
[1:48:59] about this you'll find many quotes where
[1:49:01] you say that and what he told me in
[1:49:04] there he said i can't even talk about it
[1:49:07] till the day i die
[1:49:09] it's going with me in my bosom

[1:49:15] that just like how
[1:49:17] he took him in the heaven and show him
[1:49:19] his natural seed and how many of them
[1:49:21] were there and his spiritual seed that
[1:49:24] were born under that first second poll
[1:49:26] that no doubt the angel showed him us i
[1:49:30] don't mean this little church but
[1:49:32] anybody anywhere that really

[1:49:37] revelation catches in their heart
[1:49:40] hallelujah
[1:49:42] he give him a glimpse
[1:49:44] for him to say your work isn't in vain

[1:50:25] he realized that third paul is now going
[1:50:27] to be the lord himself amen
[1:50:31] is that right
[1:50:33] praise god
[1:50:35] now i want you to know
[1:50:39] there's a big difference between the
[1:50:42] angel of the lord
[1:50:45] and that light itself
[1:50:48] that light
[1:50:49] because about that time
[1:50:52] i heard something moving
[1:50:55] and when it comes here at the platform
[1:50:58] at night i heard it
[1:51:04] amen
[1:51:05] the fire and it was the fire of god
[1:51:08] whipping around like a licking of a
[1:51:10] blaze hallelujah hallelujah watch
[1:51:15] and that fire that used to be with him
[1:51:18] on the platform listen what he says it
[1:51:20] left me
[1:51:24] and it went itself
[1:51:27] right
[1:51:27] over the audience
[1:51:31] right
[1:51:32] it left him
[1:51:33] he's not going to call out people and
[1:51:35] tell them their names and the address
[1:51:37] and all that sort of stuff
[1:51:38] but the holy spirit now
[1:51:42] settle himself above the people
[1:51:45] he's going to do the pulling he's going
[1:51:48] to do the third pull fishing
[1:51:50] the great fisherman is going to fish for
[1:51:52] his own fish
[1:51:54] hallelujah
[1:51:56] praise god amen
[1:51:58] yes sir
[1:52:00] and so
[1:52:01] the
[1:52:02] seventh
[1:52:03] angels ministry
[1:52:05] was now over
[1:52:09] and the lord himself
[1:52:11] is now coming has now come
[1:52:14] on the scene under this anointing and
[1:52:18] inspiration
[1:52:19] of the third pull
[1:52:22] a lot of them misunderstanding that's
[1:52:24] why they think he's going to come back
[1:52:27] to do all those great works and this and
[1:52:29] that
[1:52:30] and he's not coming back
[1:52:32] he he's resting in peace now
[1:52:35] and he's there looking from the
[1:52:36] battlements of glory like paul said and
[1:52:39] all him other saints looking down and
[1:52:41] compass with a multitude of these
[1:52:43] witnesses saying run
[1:52:45] run with patience the race that is
[1:52:47] checked before you amen hallelujah we
[1:52:50] can see be here they can see us but we
[1:52:53] can't see that
[1:52:54] hallelujah
[1:52:56] but we can walk in the light
[1:52:58] as he's in the light
[1:53:00] amen and so jesus come hallelujah and
[1:53:04] when i tell you something
[1:53:06] when that pillar of light when that
[1:53:08] pillar of fire which is the light that
[1:53:11] comes to your soul to your being comes
[1:53:14] to you and light up your life and gives
[1:53:16] you light on hard sayings in the
[1:53:18] scriptures and gives you light on all
[1:53:21] the things that were hidden in the world
[1:53:23] when it just starts to give you all that
[1:53:25] light what does it do it breaks down
[1:53:28] every stronghold that the devil had in
[1:53:31] your life it breaks down every false
[1:53:33] idea every thought that you have every
[1:53:36] presumption that you might have had
[1:53:39] anything of that nature it breaks it all
[1:53:42] down hallelujah
[1:53:43] amen
[1:53:45] praise god you all the strongholds the
[1:53:48] devil tried to build up in you all is
[1:53:50] broken

[1:53:56] it went and stood right over the people
[1:53:59] hallelujah over the audience
[1:54:02] amen why
[1:54:04] it's now fishing for all those people
[1:54:06] that have ears to hear
[1:54:08] onto him that happened here to here
[1:54:12] there's a lot of people that ain't got
[1:54:14] the ears to hear
[1:54:15] but i come to him or her that happened
[1:54:19] here to here
[1:54:20] oh there was something that you were
[1:54:22] given before you even got here
[1:54:24] unto you it's given to know the
[1:54:26] mysteries of the kingdom

[1:54:34] heart to see and an ear to hear and
[1:54:37] recognize the fullness of the word
[1:54:40] and now that pillar of fire comes and
[1:54:43] settles not on top of brother brandon's
[1:54:45] hair

[2:00:53] hallelujah brother brown tried to tell
[2:00:55] us that in many ways she's in that time
[2:00:57] comes when the great eagle will spread
[2:01:00] his wings over the barnyard
[2:01:03] and he calls this earth and all the
[2:01:06] religious stuff a bunch of stench
[2:01:08] barnyard flying over and as he flies
[2:01:11] over he screams out
[2:01:14] well that boys he said them chickens
[2:01:17] didn't understand they scatter
[2:01:19] you take that i don't want to go back to
[2:01:21] that and make all the parallels but the
[2:01:24] main thing is that just like how the
[2:01:26] holy spirit has come
[2:01:28] to seek his own children
[2:01:30] to fish his own trout
[2:01:33] the holy spirit flying over the great
[2:01:35] eagle and lets out the scream the voice
[2:01:39] didn't understand
[2:01:40] the seven thunders scared them they
[2:01:43] didn't understand
[2:01:45] but right away the prophet said that the
[2:01:47] legal raise his head and you look up
[2:01:50] why
[2:01:51] he never heard the language before but
[2:01:53] the moment he heard it erect something
[2:01:55] in their appeal made me recognize it
[2:01:58] it's thus saith the lord hallelujah the
[2:02:01] word of god hallelujah amen
[2:02:04] searching for a child he says
[2:02:08] this will not be a public show he said
[2:02:11] sir i don't understand it
[2:02:14] why does it have to be in there why like
[2:02:16] that he says i don't understand it why
[2:02:20] do they have to go into that closet like
[2:02:22] that he said because it is written
[2:02:25] in the word of god
[2:02:28] when the oppressed
[2:02:30] be not like the hypocrites who like to
[2:02:32] be heard
[2:02:33] before men
[2:02:35] but enter into the secret closet and
[2:02:38] pray to the father who see it in secret
[2:02:42] and he who see it in secret shall reward
[2:02:45] thee openly
[2:02:47] and then i said
[2:02:49] now sir
[2:02:50] i understand
[2:02:52] then
[2:02:54] he took me to this place
[2:02:56] and set me in this room where i was at
[2:02:59] and he told me
[2:03:01] the rest of what i was to do for the
[2:03:04] third time

[2:10:37] on divine healing

[2:14:24] amen
[2:14:25] when the right
[2:14:26] word goes down then they grab it
[2:14:30] and when they grab it they're not like
[2:14:32] other fish that will nibble around
[2:14:35] they're playing around with it when they
[2:14:37] know that's the that's the big that's
[2:14:39] the one they want to eat they just grab

[2:15:19] he said this visitation
[2:15:21] is going to be a great marvel or
[2:15:23] something well what great and marvelous
[2:15:26] well great to hope they think when in
[2:15:28] chicago when brother branham said to
[2:15:31] madison jose he said oh i thank god for
[2:15:34] that great meeting we had the greatest
[2:15:36] meeting we had said what red meeting
[2:15:38] brother brother you had meeting with
[2:15:40] with tens of thousands of people and
[2:15:42] even more miracles and now this one
[2:15:46] you know less people maybe 3 000 and
[2:15:49] less miracles and yet you call it the
[2:15:51] greatest meeting he says you don't
[2:15:53] understand
[2:15:54] what it means to be the greatest meaning
[2:15:57] he said it's only to call out the elect
[2:16:00] of that area
[2:16:02] the elect that's been in that all the
[2:16:05] crowd if there's five in there that's
[2:16:07] the revival that's the move of god
[2:16:10] that's the moving of the holy spirit is
[2:16:12] to call out those elected that we're in
[2:16:15] that crowd that is the move of god and
[2:16:17] the visitation of god is going on right
[2:16:19] now
[2:16:21] god again visiting his people
[2:16:24] and they don't even know anything about
[2:16:26] it when he came there in the first time
[2:16:29] he came physically
[2:16:31] he wasn't even known within 200 miles of
[2:16:33] where he had come
[2:16:34] now we're reading it in the bible we
[2:16:36] think the whole world knew but the whole
[2:16:38] world didn't know
[2:16:40] he came down from his glory
[2:16:42] condescended
[2:16:44] walked among the people did all the
[2:16:46] miracles and he wasn't known beyond 200
[2:16:49] miles from where he was
[2:16:51] and again the world is doing this
[2:16:54] look
[2:16:56] i have no ownership of nothing
[2:16:59] i don't believe i'm the only one this is
[2:17:01] it's breaking around the world
[2:17:05] and other people are going to see it and
[2:17:07] maybe are already seeing it and just
[2:17:10] like like uh
[2:17:12] peter and paul many years later they
[2:17:14] meet and when they meet
[2:17:16] their teaching their preaching
[2:17:18] without
[2:17:19] con conference or knowing one another it
[2:17:22] fits together like that
[2:17:24] amen it fit together like that i don't
[2:17:26] have to know him you don't have to know
[2:17:28] me she doesn't have to know me but when
[2:17:30] i hear the word
[2:17:32] that word test hit my ears i know this
[2:17:35] the gospel sound
[2:17:37] i know the gospel sound amen praise the
[2:17:40] with the lord god so you can't major
[2:17:43] on their mind was on god forbid but
[2:17:46] there's many
[2:17:47] still beating the drum
[2:17:49] and trying to mage up
[2:17:51] on a minor of those things
[2:17:54] hallelujah so there's a visitation
[2:17:58] see but there's a great visitation
[2:18:02] a marvelous something going on friends
[2:18:06] the lord is fixing to visit his people
[2:18:09] and that
[2:18:10] has to be a secret that i must keep
[2:18:14] within my own heart
[2:18:17] and if you know me believe me and love
[2:18:19] me
[2:18:20] and you respect me as a servant of the
[2:18:22] living god remember
[2:18:24] you
[2:18:25] i am remember this i am telling you
[2:18:28] a blessing
[2:18:30] is now
[2:18:31] on the road
[2:18:34] that's right
[2:18:36] a blessing is coming
[2:18:39] and that blessing
[2:18:41] is the same one
[2:18:43] that now
[2:18:45] it doesn't weaken me anymore
[2:18:49] why
[2:18:51] you go back study the message but i'll
[2:18:52] just make it brief the angel told them
[2:18:55] because you were doing that
[2:18:58] i told you how to do it when you walter
[2:19:00] you were doing that but this third
[2:19:02] thought it wasn't weakening anymore
[2:19:06] because it wasn't him
[2:19:08] the lord himself
[2:19:10] had come to be his own interpreter
[2:19:12] of his own word
[2:19:14] and a greater than solomon
[2:19:19] making himself known amen oh my i will
[2:19:23] never weaken no more
[2:19:26] it will be far beyond anything that has
[2:19:28] ever happened here or any other time
[2:19:31] else
[2:19:33] because it's something
[2:19:35] that the lord himself
[2:19:37] has given praise god brothers uh look we
[2:19:42] can go online but we'll just leave it
[2:19:43] there for now and i want you to know i
[2:19:47] thank god that i was blind
[2:19:50] but now i see
[2:19:52] musicians
[2:19:53] worship leader
[2:19:55] come praise god
[2:19:56] will you bless my friends
[2:19:59] [Applause]
[2:20:04] when you go home
[2:20:06] be real sheep
[2:20:08] don't just go home and
[2:20:10] pick up a leg of turkey and
[2:20:12] or a steak and whatnot
[2:20:15] go
[2:20:16] ah even after you eat just no just think
[2:20:19] on these things
[2:20:22] regurgitate
[2:20:24] search these things in the word of god
[2:20:28] see the scripture see the message
[2:20:32] and see whether what i'm telling you or
[2:20:34] what i've said
[2:20:36] is the truth
[2:20:39] and just to give you some background
[2:20:41] here let me see if i can give you
[2:20:43] why are people so tossed about
[2:20:46] this one message came out of
[2:20:49] and the next one
[2:20:52] is
[2:20:53] what is a vision
[2:20:55] you can look in that
[2:20:57] also because these are just the actual
[2:21:00] quotes here
[2:21:02] and oh i just forgot something
[2:21:05] just before i left the house
[2:21:07] the holy spirit was speaking in my heart
[2:21:09] and saying
[2:21:11] he says that is why
[2:21:13] i sent peter
[2:21:15] to go and catch that fish
[2:21:18] that was one of the big fish
[2:21:20] that was the rainbow trout it
[2:21:23] remember the question he was asked
[2:21:27] he said whose image
[2:21:29] whose seal is on it
[2:21:32] you know he said well render to caesar
[2:21:34] what is caesar
[2:21:36] but unto god what is god
[2:21:39] this fish that was caught by peter
[2:21:42] had
[2:21:43] caesar's inscription
[2:21:45] but this one we are catching they have
[2:21:47] the image of jesus christ
[2:21:50] in them and this is what he was telling
[2:21:52] me and i didn't i didn't make a note of
[2:21:55] that
[2:21:55] i just came back to me before i come off
[2:21:58] of here saying that that's what we are
[2:22:01] going after now
[2:22:02] is to catch the fishes in the sea of
[2:22:04] humanity
[2:22:06] that have the image of jesus christ
[2:22:08] already
[2:22:10] the seed of god the germ the gene
[2:22:13] already in there
[2:22:15] and the word of god
[2:22:17] is only what the real genuine pure word
[2:22:20] is what they eat i mean they'll eat a
[2:22:22] crumb they'll eat whatever and spit out
[2:22:24] the rest of it but they're seeking for
[2:22:26] the pure war
[2:22:28] and when they get that they're not just
[2:22:30] nibbling they're gonna grab a hold
[2:22:33] amen god bless you god bless you real
[2:22:36] good and i'm going to go in my office
[2:22:37] and write that little thought that he
[2:22:39] gave me at the last layer down before it
[2:22:42] goes from me again okay god bless every
[2:22:44] one of you keep looking up
[2:22:46] moving forward

[2:22:57] home as you would think and study for
[2:22:59] hours and hours i do that after god
[2:23:02] shows me something right not before
[2:23:05] studying to find something but when the
[2:23:08] holy spirit begins to break something
[2:23:10] then i go back to the word and confirm
[2:23:12] it in the word and then the whole thing
[2:23:14] begins to run right through the
[2:23:15] scripture then i come to you amen praise
