name amen praise God amen so let's um continue we're going to we're going to be on the seals for for a while um studying them so I trust that you've been taking the opportunity to go back and and read them study them listen to brother brandom in the uh Seven Seals there is so much in there that um it's just uh almost impossible you know brother brandham said I know he me mentioned it in the second seals he says when the anointing would come into the room there when he was studying if he had to write down and bring to us what was revealed to him he says it would take him three months on one of the seals on the amount of Revelation and the things you got to understand he was a prophet and when God would unveil the word to him he would see Visions he would actually see the events and the things that were happening and and to write everything that he would have uh seen while under that anointing he says would have taken a months to bring it to us so you can imagine how much Revelation there is in the word of God that we can only touch the highlights and you know even the things that we break into is just the grace of God what God reveals to us amen so um know that uh there's just so much more than what we could even possibly imagine in this study but let's read our scripture we we're going to continue where we kind of left off last week we're looking at the two Spirits from Genesis to Revelation because we know that um uh the spirit of God has been moving from before the foundations of the world everything was in his mind he saw the whole plan in his mind and we are actually by studying the scriptures we're seeing the things that have happened and then as we continue in the scriptures and we uh under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost we see what is happening and it brings us into our day and how the holy spirit is moving in the body of Christ at the same time Satan has been there he's that second spirit that wants to impersonate the Holy Spirit wants to be worshiped as the Holy Spirit and so um those two lines have been operating in the church and so tonight let's read our scripture from Matthew 24:5 it says for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many the Lord add His blessings to the word of God and so as we um as we continue this study we're going to be looking at um the next slide here the church Spirit and the bride Spirit you may be seated um we know that uh even within the church there is a church spirit and there is the bride spirit and like we've been saying we are so much further down the road now to where we are in the word of God and how this how these seals have been opened back in 1963 and how now the seventh seal uh continues to unveil itself right into our day and we see that as we as we come into the Capstone and as we head into the full revelation of the Rapture and the and the church is gathered and called out and brought together we begin to see that these two spirits that are operating within the church are so close that they would deceive even the very elect if it was possible go to the next slide SE is not air with the Shu brother brandham speaking here he says notice see how close it looks Matthew said in St Matthew 24:24 he said that the two spirits in the last days and notice what he says here the church Spirit of the church people and the bride Spirit of the Bride people would be so close together till it would deceive the very elected if it was possible that's how close and so when we look at how close now we're actually looking within the boundaries of the message of the hour because remember the pale horse rider okay as as we go into all of these Riders and we look at the seals we're going to see that it was Satan that was riding through those ages and you know when we look at the the first seal we need to recognize that these writers they started out in the first church age that's where they actually started to ride and move into the churches and through the church ages and so these uh spirits of these false anointed christs okay because they come in the Name of Christ and they come for one purpose and that is to deceive the real true church to try and deceive to try and get them to you know leave the word and and by leaving the word I don't mean by just you know walking away from Christ I mean by just taking one deviation off the word will be enough that in the end they were they will think that they are actually worshiping Christ but actually find out that they're worshiping the Antichrist and so these seals it's so important for us to go through them and to recognize what's really truly happening and how it is that this deception will come so close that it would deceive the elect if it was possible and so we're going to continue now let's read um the scripture from Revelations 10:1 to 7 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not let's continue next slide and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth for ever and ever who created heaven and the things that are there that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets amen praise God saints that scripture of Revelations 10 1-7 should just make you so excited and happy to know what God has done for us in our day up until that time when brother brandham was on the earth and his ministry was unveiling itself it was all culminating to come to this very time where the seals would be open and the mysteries of God the mystery of God would be revealed and so as we look through this we're looking here and recognizing that the timing of it was very important nothing could happen to move us on to the next stage of the church ministry until those seals were unveiled it it said in Daniel 12: 8 to10 that it said and I heard but I understood not then said I oh Lord what shall be the end of these things and when he said go thy Way Daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end and so the end time is when the seals were to be revealed and it was and and we're going to come to realize why it was so important that it was the time of the end that it would be so important that it would have to wait until then for those seals to be open and so he goes on to say here many shall be purified and made white and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand and so when we recognized that God had sent a prophet and I know a lot of the world and and and still up to this time the denominational Christians they haven't recognize the Fulfillment of scripture they haven't recognized the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 that behold he would send us Elijah the prophet but the thing is is that when you read that script scripture you see that behold I send unto you and we need to realize that that the opening of the word and the spirit of God the holy spirit in in your life is when when God gives you a revelation of what he's doing in your day and so those that recognize the coming of William Branham and the Fulfillment of his part his prophetic Ministry they will come to realize and recognize the importance of the opening of these seals only they will be excited only they will be enlightened only they will be uh uh feasting on the revelation of his word only they will recognize how important this season of the opening of the seals were and are to us now and so you'll notice that in the opening of the scripture in Revelations 10 1-7 he said that he was not permitted to write what he heard the Thunder saying and so when we look at the actual opening of the seals if you go back into the book of Revelation chap 4 5 and 6 you'll notice that there was a king that was sitting on a throne and in his hand was a seven sealed book and this book was sealed to the one that was in the throne and when they began to utter and to speak what the seal was when they opened the first seal it was talking about someone that was going out to conquer that would have and when we're looking at the first seal and I'm just giving you an example here when those seals were open there was a mystery under each and every one of those seals but you'll you'll see and notice that the seven Thunders was not permitted to be written at that time because Redemption had not been complete yet because John was weeping and crying and saying who would be worthy to open those seals and to loose the the mystery that was under those seals The Plan of Redemption the book who would be worthy to open the book and Christ had not come yet to fulfill the actual plan of r Redemption by going to the cross and that's why it's so important for us to understand that until Christ actually went to the cross and Redemption was complete he could not come and take the book out of that right hand of him that sat on the throne and you get you also need to understand that the Book of Revelations and everything that John saw was in symbols everything was in symbols nothing was was actually written out he had to write out what he saw so he saw a white horse rider he saw him go out with a bow but then he had no arrows so it was all symbolic but there was a mystery behind it all and only when those Thunders and the seals were to be open would those Mysteries actually be revealed but in Revelation 10 you'll notice that the mighty Angel himself which was Christ was actually now coming down with the open book in his hand to reveal the mystery of Christ the mystery that was written under each and every one of these seals amen praise God so John was not allowed to write the interpretation of the Thunders because the lamb was to come down and take possession of the book okay until the actual sacrifice had been made the book could not be taken now we need to understand as we come and we look into this we need to understand that these writers they started way back right after Christ had risen from the dead that's when the deception started to enter into the church and when Christ actually came the second coming the first coming of Christ okay he came to make the sacrifice for all those that were in the Old Testament that were all making sacrifices with animal sacri sacrifice they were they were they were bringing a lamb they were bringing uh you know animal sacrifices for their sin because Christ had not come yet and so the only way that they could atone for their sins was through animal sacrifice but when Christ came in his first coming he paid the price for their sacrifice and all those that had died prior to his first coming the atonement was made for them at that point but the church ages and the Gentile church and for us and the Seven Church ages that led right up to us right after Christ died he went back to the throne to mediate for those that were were to come in the seven Church ages and it's important for us to understand that while he was on the throne he was making intercession for all those that came from the Ephesian Church all the way down to leoda and that's why when he left the throne he could could not leave the throne until the last one had come in under the seven Church age dispensation because there was bride members that were all under each one of those seven Church ages but the fullness of the word had not come yet until the fullness of the word it was all portions until it came to where the Catholic church had control of the of the word because remember those two Spirits they started to operate we know that that it started from before the foundation of the world and it's been running all the way through that's why we were looking at Jacob and Esau you know all the way through you'll see those two Spirits constantly fighting Cain and Abel Jacob and Esau all the way through all the way down but most importantly for us to recognize in the seven Church ages the Gentile dispensation okay that there were bride members in each of those dispensations and Christ was on the throne after the order of MDC the high priest making intercession for all the Sons and Daughters of God that were that were attributes through each of those dis dispensations but because they only had parts of the word and the fullness of the of the mystery hadn't come yet because that could only come under the seventh Church age messenger okay and so until we got to 1906 Pentecost and then when brother Branham when William Branham came on the scene he's the seventh Church age messenger okay and it's important for us to understand so so Christ is on the throne he's making intercession for all the Sons and Daughters of God right up to just before the opening of the seals because he left the throne and when he left the throne there was no more mediation no more intercession for the church ages and the last one in particular being the Pentecostal Church age you need to follow me here okay because this is important this is why the seventh seal and the opening of the seals is so important we need to see why God had to like he said in in uh The Book of Daniel seal it up until the time of the end because it would only be then that the mystery of God would be revealed and the and Eve could be completely restored so under those seven Church ages Christ is on the throne after the order of MDC the high priest that he's making because Luther all of a sudden gets a revelation on justification and breaks away from the Catholic church that was the beginning of the Reformation but Luther was still drinking smoking living you know he had a revelation on justification that the just shall live by Revelation by faith but he was still sinning they were still under under the sin dispensation and that's why Christ had to be there making an atonement for their ignorant sin in other words like if you go back into the Old Testament you'll see in the Book of Numbers where once year the high priest would have to go and make a sacrifice for all the people and they called it uh the the the the sacrifice for ignorance because even though the children of Israel would come and actually bring a sacrifice because they knew they sinned remember when they knew that they would sin then they knew that they'd have to bring a sacrifice but then there was sin that they were doing that they were ignorant enough they would be doing just like you and me we're not we're not aware sometimes and and and we're caught by by the Trap of sin because as long as in you're you're in this flesh over here you're susceptible to deception you're susceptible to human weakness and your mind is is your your your carnal mind is actually at Amity with God and it still will because of the nature that's in it and it's not what gets redeemed remember it's not this that gets redeemed this gets changed am it's the attribute it's the part of God that you are that's what God redeems but your nature and your flesh is weak and it still makes mistakes even in ignorance but the blood of Christ is is available to us now the atonement now to the bride is Christ himself the Holy Ghost himself that's the blood the blood is the Holy Ghost amen and so these Church AG attributes Sons and Daughters of God they would still be in sin and that's why Christ would have to be on the throne mediating interceding allowing the blood to cleanse them constantly cleanse them because every son and daughter of God remember every attribute of God is a part of God and their Redemption their coming back has to come the same way by the blood but they are gone now they died under their age and they no longer sin and brother Braham said that the last one when the last one would come in that was under those seven Church age dispensations when that last one come in then he would leave the throne because now it was time for him to take the book and go down to the Earth with an open book and unveil the mystery of Christ now now in the bride in the church in order to bring the church that is presently on the earth to redeem them to the Rapture the in other words the Rapture Revelation could not actually begin until Revelations 10 1-7 was fulfilled you following me now you need to see he left the throne that's why on the opening of that seventh seal and we're going to be looking at all this as we move down but I'm just this is still the introduction because you need to have the foundational understanding there was a on the opening of that seventh seal there was a half hour of Silence why is there silence in heaven while he was there on the throne there was there was the 24 Elders the four beasts that were around the throne there was there was constant worship praising God and especially when he had taken when the lamb the bleeding bloody lamb because that was that was the he had come to the stage where now all the Old Testament Saints okay and all those that were in the book remember the B ible is the book and the book is the book of redemption and the Book of redemption was written from before the foundations of the world everything that we're reading here and every Old Testament scripture right up until Revelations the the last book in of Revelations was all written in the mind of God because he is the book he is the unveil in of the book and everything that we're seeing when we're reading from Genesis to Revelation we're seeing a play the actors all the all the actors and changing their masks showing themselves in all the different characters but it's all God it's all Christ it's him unveiling his word so everything that's why you know it was all played out from before the foundations of the world but then we in our day get to experience the portion of the word that is ordained for us now and that's why the evidence that you have the Holy Ghost is your ability to see what God is doing now through the scripture you should be able to see yourself in the scripture when you can see yourself in the scripture you're actually experience what's called perfect Faith a revelation that God is in you fulfilling his word through you then you see it through the church then you see every office every position and so now do you see the importance of the timing of of the opening of those seals and that it had to it had to be under in the days of the voice of the seventh angel well the seventh angel we know if you go back and do a study of the seven church and we're going to be looking at each one of them as we when we get to the first seal we're going to see how the first seal actually ties in with Paul the Ephesian age then the Sardis age and then all the other ages as they come down and we see how each horse rider ties in to each one of those ages and those Messengers and the anointing that was on each of them and how you know uh uh that first horse rider went out to conquer to conquer what to conquer the church but he didn't have a crown a crown was given to him so he would he would start out as a deceiver and it would keep moving along and his form of deception was moving through each Church age each Church age amen and so now when we come to this time here of the opening of Revelations 10 1-7 we come to realize that we've come to the end of the age where Christ is required to make intercession for the church Through the Ages when we completed the Pentecostal Church age under the seventh Church age under the seventh angel messenger William Branham there was no more blood on the throne required because all of those that were under those ages we've we're we're Beyond those ages now we're no longer even though we're we're we're in technically we're in the seventh Church age but in the midst of the seventh Church age remember the messenger to each age always comes at the end of the church age and so the messenger that came to the seventh Church age William Branham was to introduce the mighty Angel because it was it was the mighty angel that came down with the book open not brother brandham it was Christ amen it was Christ let's let's read here let's go to the next slide now he says here in the breach between the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals and this is really what we're covering here okay is the breach now oh the whole creation lays in his hand now on which the whole Plan of Redemption is sealed by seven mysterious seals in this book that he took now watch and he alone can reveal it to whomever he will he's got it in his hand see now he promised it would be at that time now for it for it is sealed by Seven Seals of mystery the book of redemption so the mighty angel that comes down is Christ he's got the book in his hand and the book is open amen praise God go to the next Slide the sealed scroll now if we go back to Revelations 5:1 that scroll and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a scroll written inside and on the back sealed with Seven Seals the one that was sitting in the throne was Christ he had the book he had it in his hands go to the next slide if you look at this scroll you see that each scroll was intertwined within itself so when they would open the first one it would reveal what was written on the back side of the actual scroll and then the second one it would reveal what was on the backs side and all of those Mysteries they all took place under the seven Church ages up to the seventh up to the Sixth Seal up to the end of The Sixth Seal all the Mysteries that were written under there took place played out like we said all the actors all the ones that were that were being called under each Age and and and the Mystery that was all under there it was all being played out through the deception and everything else but it wasn't revealed there was confusion so many people trying to figure out the Book of Revelation they couldn't figure it out why because it's not something that you can figure out it has to be revealed supernaturally and inspirationally from God himself to each individual that's why they could hit a lot of the teachers and the and the preachers all through and the and the and the ones that wrote all the commentaries on the scriptures brother brandham himself said that when he came to that first seal he would actually have made a huge mistake in coming out in saying that that white horse rider all the way up until that time it was understood that that was Christ because they see Christ coming at the end on a white horse but his name is the word of God and it was Christ that comes and that's when we come back with him after the three and a half year tribulation we're not going to get into all that right now but had the opening of The Seven Seals not taken place under the seventh Church age messenger the whole world would have been still under the deception even though 99 9% of the religious teachings out there are under deception because it only takes one One Drop of Poison in a glass of water and it'll kill you 99% pure filtered clean spring water but One Drop of Poison and you're done and that's why nobody can come to the fullness of the revelation of the word of God and the interpretation on the word unless the spirit of God the word of God the is in the individual that's why in this in this age that we're in right now this under the seventh seal mystery of the word that's unveiling to the church because Christ had to come himself amen that's why it could never be in personated because it's Christ himself in you in the true elected Sons and Daughters of God and so we're just looking at this scroll here and and there was only one that could be worthy to open it there was only one that could actually make the perfect sacrifice remember if a man sin a man had to die but but every man that was born into this world was born in sin and so there was no man that's why that's why John when he when he was you know in in in Revelations uh five when when he's talking about no one was found worthy in heaven on Earth below the Earth in other words anybody that had died that had lived that had come to the Earth there was absolutely nobody that was worthy because it had to be the blood of a perfect sacrifice and the only perfect sacrifice was Jesus Christ that's why the scripture says we're not we're not Redeemed by the blood of man we are Redeemed by the blood of God it was the it was the it was Christ himself that's why Mary there was no blood there was no egg there was nothing it was absolutely the word of God that was spoken in seed form into the womb of Mary she was only a carrier she was not the mother of God God cannot have a mother he has no beginning and no end she was strictly a carrier for the perfect sacrifice and that's why when he went to Calvary and made the sacrifice it was finished redemp could now be completed all those that were in the Old Testament that had died under the Bulls under the under the blood of bulls and goats the perfect sacrifice had come and every son and daughter every any every uh uh seed that was Christ seed that was the seed of Adam every one of those seed the Seed of Abraham those that were that were the the the the promised seed that were by the spirit of the promise of the word of God not the the the deceptive seed the one that took place through the serpent but the seed of God the whole lineage of Christ every one of those that died under the blood of bulls and goats were redeemed when Christ came and gave up The Ghost and and intercession was complete for them of the Old Testament they didn't need intercession anymore and that's why when he went to the throne he was making intercession for all those that were under the seven Church ages now he takes the scroll he steps out into Revelations 101 to7 with the open book and now he's ready to complete Redemption and to call every son and every daughter of God and so now as this plan begins to unveil itself we realize that there's two spirits that are going to always be in the church and unless the spirit of Christ is in you which is the word the Holy Ghost the word for your day you'll be deceived because you've got now the church Spirit and the bride Spirit the two Spirits are not message Christians and denominational Christians remember we're way down the road now you're not going to be deceived by Pentecostals out there because you've got Oneness you've got Tess you've got trinitarian you know that they're way off the word and there is no more redemption or intercession for the church ages so don't be looking to try to convert the churches it's only individuals it's only attributes Sons and Daughters of God that dispensation of the church ages is over Luther the Lutheran Churches they had the message for their day it moved on it went into Wesley they had the message for their day the spirit of God moved on into Pentecost from Pentecost it moved into the gifts of the Spirit and then from the gifts of the Spirit it went to the messenger of Malachi 4:5 the messenger of Revelations 10:7 and the ministry became that was the that was the ministry of that day and and there was many Believers that came out of those churches that followed William Branham right out up until the opening of the seals and any of those that that were under that church age dispensation of the Pentecostal Church age there was intercession available for them the blood was on the throne the lamb was on the throne making intercession for them right up until the opening of that of those Seven Seals a great event took place in in 1963 when those seals were opened it was brother brandham said it in in uh in the in the breach we'll probably come up to it here but he said it was the most Sublime time it was the most important time for the church but right after the opening of those seals many of those that were following William brandham started to leave William brandham because they couldn't take the continu ation of the word that's why those that were under Luther when Wesley came the ones that recognized they went on into Wesley's uh the church age under sanctification the ones that were under Wesley when Pentecost came along they recognized they went on into the Pentecostal dispensation the ones that recognized William Branham under the ministry where he was under the first and second pull where he was having great meetings you go back and look at them you'll see the meetings that he had there was thousands and thou hundreds of thousands of people worldwide that were healed it was one of the it was the most Supernatural Ministry since the days of Jesus Christ that's there was even more healings and more Supernatural under that Ministry because of the fact that he went world wide traveled the world seven times into meetings where there was thousands of people even one meeting where there was over I don't know a couple of hundred thousand people they filled stadiums they fil it was city blocks of people and then they'd have to bring in tractor trailers you can go back and and and find articles and see pictures newspaper articles showing tractor trailers bringing out tractor trailers full of stretchers and and and and crutches and all kinds of beds hospital beds because people had actually gone in come in on in ambulances on stretchers because they heard of this healing campaign under the ministry of William brandham that they would that they would bring busloads of people and they would walk out because of the supernatural but God was doing that for the people to get their attention to listen to the word that was coming out remember signs and wonders are wonderful but but the signs and wonders have a purpose to draw the attention of the people to the word that's why when Jesus was on the earth he drew crowds when he was doing the signs and wonders but the minute that he said to them unless you eat my body and drink my blood there's no life in you and you have no part of me they couldn't understand that he was talking about him being the word his body he was going to give up his body he was going to die for our sin and unless we would take that word and eat that word and not literally eating his body it's not talking about cannibalism he's not talking about drinking his blood his blood is the Holy Ghost and unless you can receive the Holy Ghost you have no part with him hallelujah praise God Amen and so it's wonderful you know we're just listen this is a study and so we we come and and and we and we just we're just hitting things and your faith I trust that you're praying you're believing when you come to these Services you're you're you're you're pulling on the word of God so that he can give you Revelation and understanding here I know these are a lot of things that you've heard before but let me tell you something there are things that you have not heard in your spirit yet and it's those things that are revealed to you supernaturally by Revelation that's what's changing your body that's what's that's what's uh line upon line uh changing you and placing you uh uh in in Heavenly places where your body is being changed uh you know for for the Rapture the quickening of the spirit for the Rapture amen praise God Allelujah amen so notice let me just go here let's go to the next slide and the whole thing together makes the book and it's sealed with Seven Seals and being it's on the backside is because it's wound up that's why when I showed you those seals the Mysteries that are that are written under the seals the seal the seal mystery is on the inside and it only says the white horse rider or the black horse rider and the whatmore on the outside but the mystery of the whole book is in them seals from Genesis to Revelations a complete Plan of Redemption is revealed in these Seven Seals think about that Saints unless 1963 took place and the seventh angel messenger William Branham had not come to introduce the mighty Angel because remember the mighty Angel is Christ the voice of the seventh angel in the days of the voice that's why it's called voice of God Recordings because it wasn't William brandom it was the voice of God that came down and opened these Seven Seals so that the whole Plan of Redemption could be unveiled they've been talking about it from Genesis they were looking onto the coming of the Lord looking onto the coming of the Lord the the coming of the Messiah all through the Old Testament and then he comes but they're looking for Redemption they were looking even when Christ came are you not now going to restore the kingdom see they were all looking for the promised land they were all looking for that for that land that was told to Abraham that hey I'm giving you all the land you're going to go in there it's going to be all yours it's it's he's talking about back to our state that we were in before the foundations of the world when we were with God in that Eternal place that's what he was talking about and these seals opens up that whole Plan of Redemption now remember this okay I'm going to read here from uh the seven Church age book now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless so in other words The Book of Revelation exposes Satan revealing his Works attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time he has cast into the Lake of Fire Satan fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army that's why Satan would constantly be be trying to deceive and why he deceived every Church age is because he didn't want the church Church to come to that place where she would recognize who she is he couldn't receive Revelation but she does and she will be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her that's why it's so important for us to understand the purpose of the opening of these seals because one of the uh one of the Mysteries that was under those seals was the mystery of iniquity The Mystery of the Antichrist spirit that was operating in the church amen working in the church glory to God and so she will be an invincible Army Satan will be powerless before her he will he will be as definitely thwarted today as when Christ with stod his every effort to gain power over him in the desert when the bride gets to a place where she real we're going to close now in the next five minutes when she gets to a place where she realizes that now he's come down to possess her that's why Jesus said on that day shall know that I am in the father I am the one that was in the throne the one that was in the throne is in me and I now in you because remember the book gets passed on to the church and this is what we are going to continue to look into as these seals unveil itself and the whole mystery of iniquity and the whole mystery of deception and the Mystery of the church the bride church that is within the worldly church and now even bringing it even home the bride age that's in the message age the mess age of this age that we're in right now that the deception now is within the confines of the message the holy spirit is going to show us clearly how it is that we cannot ever be deceived amen and so yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them amen praise God go to the next slide here in the breach between between the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals he says now when we go to Breaking these seals you're going to see it goes Plumb back to the scripture all the way back for each one of those seals the whole thing together the whole mystery lays right here in the seals see every mystery of the Bible every mystery of the Bible everything that you know you would read and you couldn't fully quite understand is going to be made clear and what we're going to come to realize is that the great mystery was always Christ himself changing his mask going from one character to the other knowing exactly his whole Plan of Redemption that in the end he would be the Victor he would have the victory over that other spirit that would try that tried so hard even before listen this this deception started before the foundations of the world when Satan drew a third part of the angels to himself to worship him and it was and that whole deception that whole plan it came and fell down onto the Earth and that's why when we go back to Genesis which is the seed of everything that started on on Earth we see it clearly the two Vines the two Spirits the spirit of the true church and the spirit of the Bride amen the spirit of the Antichrist and the spirit of Christ amen praise God and so the whole mystery lays right here in these seals see every mystery of the Bible lays in these seals and the seals cannot be broken until this time amen praise God God bless you let the musicians come and we'll read the last slide all these evildoers because we're going to go our next session is going to be on the first seal all these evil doers of the Seven Seals has been working mysterious in the church and pay attention he says and we'll find out in a minute that even work in the name of the church remember the greatest deception is when you can convince somebody to believe a lie thinking that it is the truth and the greatest deception is going to come down and operate within the church no wonder I've been so against denomination now he's talking about denomination back then because he saw through the seven Church ages all the deception through those seven Church ages how those writers were writing through there the the Deeds of the nicians and all of those you know deceptions every time that the church would receive truth Satan would come in sit himself into the church make himself look like a Believer but he was an unbeliever a make believer and would deceive the church age and that CH and that age would just that church would die but the spirit of God would keep moving on Amen no wonder I've been so against denomination not knowing why CC they end up now it starts back here in a mild form just keeps getting worse and worse on down until and the people go right into it saying oh yes this is just fine but in the last days these things are made known Amen in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of Christ would be revealed we're going to continue this it's um I'm excited about it because there's just so much in here that that the holy spirit is is going to unveil to us and all it's going to do it's going to make you realize more and more who you are because that's the only way you can defeat the enemy you want to overcome all the circumstances that you're dealing with out there every single day listen we all got problems we all got to deal with sickness we all got to deal but but but God has given us a revelation of who we are and the greatest Revelation in this hour is to know that not only who we are but who is in US fulfilling him his own word and so when Satan puts sickness on this vessel that God is housing if you've got a revelation that this vessel is being used of God then you can tell Satan to get off the vessel kick him out God's got a purpose for you here on this Earth for this time he didn't call you to be a defeated Christian he called you to manif EST the fullness of the word which is something that you cannot manifest in a Christian denominational church out there they're so far from the word of God they think they've got the word they have the form of godliness but they deny the power of the Holy Ghost when it comes into their lives and tells them to line up with the Scripture it shows the spirit that's actually on them when you tell them you need to repent and be back baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and they turn around and say to you I was baptized as a baby I was baptized in the Baptist Church how are you baptized I don't know some of them will say I went to the water do you remember how you were baptized were you baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ or were you baptized into the titles of Father oh I believe I was baptized into the titles I said well can you show me scripturally because the spirit of God said when the Holy Ghost comes Jesus says I will send you the comforter which is the Holy Ghost and it will guide you into all truth so if it's going to guide you to all truth it's going to guide you right back to the word and the word shows clearly every single baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I know you've heard that a hundred times but there's somebody out there that hasn't heard it and one of the Mysteries is to know who you are in the scripture and where you identify in the scripture and if you're identifying with the unbelievers those that rejected the word that's why Jesus says they have ears but they don't hear me they have eyes but they can't see me but then he says but unto you he's talking to his disciples it's been given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom you see you talk about the Mysteries but those Mysteries are now known they've been made known after 1963 the seals were opened and the Mysteries have been unveiled and Christ is now in his church making himself known amen praise God let's pray father we just so appreciate Lord the Simplicity of your word Lord you've made it so simple we we just can't miss the simplicity of how clear your word is and and the scriptures but yet it's hidden to the eyes of the wise and The Prudent and it's made known unto babes in other words people that are not so smart and so wise but you hid it you said you you said in the scripture it's hidden from the wise and The Prudent and it's revealed unto simple people that are willing to take your word for what you say [Music] Lord I pray that you will move in the hearts of the people those that that are listening in that may hear these these things father may they go and search the scriptures Lord for in them they think they have eternal life and this is the hour where the great deception the greatest deception the Bible said that the whole world all in the Book of Revelation said all would be deceived and except those whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life and that book has been open the names are being called lord we've heard our name being called we're grateful father that we can and and to hear our name being called is just the ability to hear your word and to and to
