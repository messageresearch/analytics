========================================
a second a third first and all things shall be added unto you deeper commitment waiting and deeper as st. Holy Spirit take the healthy staples father I'm like Zico willing to be led is not about you it's about God and His will for you after all we are all created in God's image and for his good pleasure at the deep end there is complete transformation that's where you're going Saints that's where God is leading us it's the rapture it's perfect cake is completion and it's coming for us righteousness and no matter what you're struggling with what you're going through there's something inside of you and we need to obey and surrender to that you for righteousness you think the season about before us were perfect no they were perfect but their faith that they have in the word God was counted in correctness just like the old Saints of the other times was tripping for righteousness it would God sees you come to that place with him now words aside you think that it's counted for you for righteousness to move forward on the new me amen glory to God in a message today perhaps not to guaran to token just quickly a lot liked it down hallelujah he says we're not to come you know as say well Moses told us the messenger and he said they told us this they told us that we should have the bunny what do you think about boys what do you mean what you think about it there are people that the message state the message preachers saying what do you think about it what do you think about this time we have no right right [Music] we can cut the and greet with the word and everything else but don't have that token what good does it do us no good get beneath it he's not responsible for anybody outside but he's not responsible for anybody today from underneath that token now he has cried out in these last days the Holy Spirit you have to work or what are you doing with it except divided it hacking it into pieces taking what you want leaving what you want out and what you don't want in your life it's going on whether you believe it or not it's going on this is what's happening in the message you are not interested in living it but debating I don't want to be there I don't want to go there that's not where they can be able to suss up where the whole easily is that's not in deep waters that's not experiencing God I just believe it I believe he's a prophet the Bible says the word comes to the top but deeper you stay on fire you recognize the spiritual identity Alleluia or near life is his kingdom contain an inner joint peace growing in wisdom taking these spiritual up keeping feet in other words Satan in his presence what do you feed it up what did it change you what takes up your time what's influencing you we don't we're not we don't you know we don't look at that what's influencing us anymore we can watch anything we want to watch every day that we want to read we can listen to anything we want to listen to it's no problem you don't realize it's influencing I'm not the see I see it if you don't believe what I just said here to see because you don't see there's a dozen tuition is why nobody is exempt nobody can live apart of this word of god too many people are more holier than thou they can do what they want to do they can feed out whatever they want to feed on because they believe they're wholly without they got a revelation you can have a revelation I think it says when you get behind the veil the gods needed in control of your life ain't gonna lead you there he told these into those places because he said he said I'm not on this world or the things in this world the simple thing is really simple but this or even Twitter hallelujah amen that's called a musician so his off mic instead I want to read stories here quickly that really struck me [Music] what kind of thirst do we think was inside we had been Agosto people were beginning to what kind of thirst is in us what kind of verses in me what kind of thirst is in you don't try to hush that only thirst of God there is a story many years ago that I came across with a prospector he was in the mountains prospecting for gold he struck it rich he was coming back thanking to the city that his troubles would be all be over and he tried to say tomorrow just one day's journey if we get into the city and he would have that goal his big sacks full of it he had a dog with him not comparing the dog to the Holy Spirit but as I'm making an illustration here this dog through the night the prospector leaned on his bed and began to think now tomorrow I'm going to take all my gold and I've become just what I've always wanted to be I've always wanted to be a rich man I wanted to own fine things and so forth and then the dog to get the park because there was and he went out there and he said shut up so the thought quite them that's what the Holy Spirit will do sometimes you tell it to shut up and no more then he got back to bed that thought started again just joking and break trying to pull on the chain and going nuts and he went out to the doors shut up I want you to know that's immoral you see that was this great trees what the dog started barking again and finally he got so discouraged he went out to his shotgun that shot the dog and killed him he said I would have need of you anymore however tomorrow operation I think with life in order I've said things in order I've accomplished that I've worked hard he put down the gun in the corner turned his back over to the door went to sleep and the man that had followed him for days wasn't his life was that stadium my brother's my sister's you would never be able don't try to hush that holding calm of your heart see I joined in the church we created them and cream to progress of certain organization or he made even in the message there's only one thing that can satisfy is the person of Jesus Christ as the heart painted when the water broke sold my soul there's not a deal in God my soul thirsts for the Living God there's something in you that once the see you moving to God and more of God your soul is thirsting for it now let's not move anything short of it they'll try to kill that holy hush it's warning you some day you'll come and you'll come to the end of the road now the second story please read into it like this little lady in the city she went to a church she's a Sunday school teacher and she went to this other little girl would love here no makeup on and she wouldn't make fun of her and she said to her if you didn't have that flat head preacher up there speaking of brother Ram you could look like something decent but he looked like something out of an antique shop he said oh she's just really dragged her over the coals every time she seen her she said our pastors broad-minded they don't mean anything are you dressed and how you do these things I would speak but the Bible says so we show that by every word of God this little girl never paid any attention to her and that's the way we should be to them that are are saying what they're saying about you you sisters and go attention to them [Music] she's a missionary now so then this young lady took a source of disease and died a friend of mine Bunton bonded fluid in her as she was dying and told me after she was dead she can't smell it fluid and it was a hole in her side eating that social disease at birth even her parents and all was wrong with her and as she died I give you said as she died and before she died she taught Sunday School she's a good faithful church member all her little Sunday school children wanted to fill up the seat and she went off to heaven so the Angels compact her weight and her perhaps it was outside smoking her cigarette walking up and down the hall in the hospital and doing all that I were to sing as she was going to heaven because they knew she was gonna die the doctor says so they all want to see the angels back of our way and all at once she faced the reality now she was what a church member Sunday school teacher in a big five church well she started the scrubland death and death from her her she said ha she said the loss get the pastor he put out a cigarette quad didn't said here here get the doctor give her Michael she said I mean I hope she said you deceiver I'm telling the truth go get that little girl and bring her up here real quick she's right way to face the reality once don't you stop that bully hush don't you blasted away from you with some modern education double-barrel shotgun you listen to that warning with the Holy Ghost today that's warning you I am the truth I am the way I am the light not to me to the father but by me he is the work both the regulations let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready there's a purpose behind everything I've said today it's very simple might have been 3000 4000 water set when its simplicity there's a holy hush [Music] there's a call of my calling you to deeper waters that's what the mission was all about come deeper deeper well beyond yourself you know not afraid of sinking jesus always said with his presence King and he always led his people he always said be not afraid because that's the first instance that's the first reaction that's the first thing that comes with putters so we get free Jesus over says be not afraid design you may not understand you may not know the next step you know you may not know what lies beyond you you made it up what will happen to you which is like all of that God our hush now holding us not only call these stories are examples that we can do in our lives surrender [Music] surely help us to surrender to that holy caller [Music] never to turn her hearts you Father and I'll bring the baguettes in the flesh no matter how much semen and perverted against out there no matter how much the world falls apart father in that secret place where you lead your people and your pulling you people it's just it's a city it's a protection that is mine you are gone your people because of the great shaking has coconut upon the earth that's going to take place just before we leave but the purpose never seen and they need to bring your people into the place a secret place where you protected where you can take them where you shelter them Oh God I pray for those souls this morning Lord Jesus that's our spirit cause it's not place Oh God let me Shane that's rather nice today father because your spirit is Colin this morning I forgive by illegals those who didn't understand this way I made a Holy Ghost and virtuous soul Oh [Music] God in the name of Jesus Christ it's in your head self father Jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the attribute separating [Music] to separate [Music] praise God for this and I know my mother tensed at her beginning it's hard to put into words basically said all we can do is do our best as the Spirit of God has to take that out take it into your heart and they call clear to you c41 you had a couple of announcements but you have the cleaners all of you posted I think that as soon as I came upstairs this place is refreshed it's looking good there was a lot of missionary work going on there just a lot of evangelistic work and as long as that was just looking really sure it's been up to me since I walked in that system [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] there's half a sunday-school doors and but it just seems a little awkward and faith in my brother says testicles fire doors the first ones have seen that because the only me they're hard to take apart Marty put together and one brother said oh I can do that everything whole thing so beyond my expectations and [Music] [Applause] just a quick comment else you only do a few things that were that you know things
