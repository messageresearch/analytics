Jehovah amen brother bam said the Holocaust was the tender hand of Jehovah hallelujah amen turning you turning them back amen they are more ready now they were sleeping they are more ready now Hallelujah and spiritual Israel we ought to be more ready now amen but above all the verse 12 but Above All Things my brethren swear not neither by Heaven neither by the Earth neither by any other oat but let your y be Y and your n be y lest you fall fall into condemnation is any among you Afflicted let him pray is any marry let him sing some is any sick among you let him call for the Elders of the church and let them pray over him and anointing him with the oil in the name of the Lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if you have committed sins they shall be forgiven given Hallelujah your healing depends on your confession hallelujah amen your healing amen hallelujah amen we want healing in our bodies amen but it depends on your confession amen if you have committed sins amen confess your sins confess your faults one to another and pray one for another so it's a very simple message this morning not no deep things like these brothers brother John Simon God bless you amen after 60 years brother what could I say again 63 years amen so Elias now look at this now Elias was a man subject to like passions amen that's why I'm heading this morning Elias was a man subject his emotions was just like yours he had hate he had love he had feelings amen you know uh brother B say that Jesus had a right to a wife he was a man but he was a God man amen so he had amen so Elijah has passions like you amen so Eli Elias was a man subject to like passion as we are and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain he said if I don't call for rain hallelujah amen amen and it rain not on the Earth by the space of three years and six months and he prayed again and the heaven gave rain let us look at Elijah First Kings chapter 19 amen when you read chapter 18 you would see all the great things that Elijah did great things amen but he was a man of like passioned as you are he had his UPS he had his down William brandham had his UPS he had his Downs amen William Branham was just a man we don't want to make him God am I am I preaching message we're not going to make him God he was just a man amen he said I have many mistakes don't look to me don't look to me look to Christ amen hallelujah amen but Paul said follow me as I follow Christ so we follow our Prophet as he follow Christ and we know he followed Christ which is the word amen so Elijah now amen in in in chapter 19 and Ahab told Jezebel so you had to go back to chapter 18 now to see what was happening there was a big showd down and fire came down from heaven and consumed the the sacrifice and so forth so in chapter 19 now and Ahab I'm speaking to you as you are well trained because you have many ministers here I think it's about eight many ministers here so you're well trained so I'm going back I'm not going to go into detail I believe that you are well trained amen so and Ahab told Jezebel amen so brother bam said Ahab is in the wife house Ahab is in the White House Jezebel is the neck that turns the head amen all right thank you so amen so like I say I'm not you you can read between the lines yourself amen and Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done and with all how he had slain all the prophets with the sword then Jezebel sent a me messenger unto Elijah saying so let the gods do to me and more also if I make not diey life as a life of one of them by tomorrow about amen a woman anointed by the devil amen put a threat on a prophet who called fire from heaven and he run for his life amen hallelujah amen so we know that Jezebel The Jezebel who is Jezebel in this this day amen and the devil will hate everything when you go home look your in the mirror the devil will hate everything that God loves that's why we have all this anti-Semitism in the world today is it strange amen like there's some kind of anointing come on the people it's really an anointing the anointing of the last day amen but the anointing of of the word is coming on the

that he shouldn't do that so when we go out there we we you know we want to curse people and tell them you're you're going to hell amen but he had a complex amen so God had to tap him on his shoulder and said don't do that those could be I have go I have children out there and he had to stop doing it amen hallelujah remember brother bam went into the um into the cafe and he saw this uh woman and this man listening to this music and he said Lord why does my children have to face this amen why don't you come and wipe the whole thing out and God had to tap him on his shoulder come let me speak to you and a vision broke and he saw the bumper and he saw every time he do a little thing that little thing that he do little wrong thing that he would do would go and hit that bumper and God he said that is me doing that he said yes and you want to condemn that lady amen but if it wasn't for the that bumper you would have been a dead man we are not here we know we we know this right we know that not everybody are seed of God but we don't know who they are amen that's the difference amen we don't know who they are so let us not not go out there judging and saying that is our super and seed and that is our seed going to hell and we don't know who they are do you know no if that preachers preaching this message you don't know who they are and then they hear you know so anyway blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah so brother Bram said most of all I want the the the sister said most of all I want the experience that have been sealed in the Holy Ghost and if God would reveal it to your heart I and brother B said I believe with all my heart that you are a real Born Again believer sister Bruce how could that Spirit just leave when you get sick you get weary we are humans hallelujah amen and you're a nervous type of person and you get things on your mind see little bitty things it just keep building up both ways you'll get somebody on your heart you want to pray for them get up
