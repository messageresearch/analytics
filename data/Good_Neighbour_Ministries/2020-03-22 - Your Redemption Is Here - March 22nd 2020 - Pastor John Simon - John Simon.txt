good morning everyone it's good to be in the house of the Lord today on this great and wonderful day before we get to the Word of God we want to thank God for all the policemen firemen people working in the health care nurses doctors all the various people that are the backbone of our system we want to firefighters you know people of that nature that are facing the storm they're on the front lines and we want to give them a hand here today right now praise God amen the prime minister and the other ministers of the government with it in opposition or not they're all together working to take care of us and we ought to thank God for those who he has given us to be above us is that right so we do appreciate it and we pray that God will bless them and we'll do our best to adhere to whatever directives are they will put out which is what we're doing here today that's why you're so spaced space you know and that is the reason why we don't have all our membership here for that purpose so that we can either rotate so that some will be able to be in the house of the Lord where we can actually have the human contact because I don't mean touching but contact in the sense that human beings were not made to live in isolation but human beings are social beings God himself said it is not good for a man to be alone right so human beings need fellowship somebody says well brother Simon you can have it on the Internet only but the fact is the Internet is a cold and sterile in it's in the way that it is right now it's a difference when human beings are somewhere together that's the real communion so we're happy that we still have this opportunity of getting together like this and we pray that God will keep every single one of us and that we can be a testimony for the glory of God before I read out of the Holy Word of God you know taking my scripture from Luke 21 verses 25 to 28 it will be up on the screen in a moment but before that we are going to pray our gracious Heavenly Father we come today in the name of Jesus Christ and we pray that the great Holy Spirit will anoint the word of God and made a word of god go forth to touch hearts and change lives heal the sick touch those that are discouraged raised up those to the weak father and send forth the light and truth of thy word today we rest ourselves upon your unfailing promises and we give you all the glory all the honor in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen before we read that scripture I want to say to all ours the saints of God everywhere not only from this our assembly wherever they are at home at this time you can at least open your Bible and read out of God's Word and follow the truths in God's Bible and listen to the message of the hour this is just a temporary disturbance it too will pass the Bible says everything comes to pass you read it verse by verse it came to pass it came to pass and it came to pass it all comes to pass so let's adapt to what is happening right now so that we may be able to better serve our community and the entire human race we understand that with all these offices we mentioned the Bible teaches us really in actual fact not maybe here on the earth but in the realms of God a minister anointed by the gospel is the highest authority the highest authority and if these other officers are serving natural ones are serving there their offices and their standing in their position as ministers we ought to stand in our position in the name of Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord I want to encourage the Saints of their at home those that are shut in I'm thinking of all or folks wherever they are and Saints everywhere because this has disrupted the entire world so our prayers and our faith moves out to you wherever you are God bless you real good and our scripture reading is as such and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the Stars and upon the earth distress of Nations with perplexity and the sea and the waves roaring men's hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of heaven shall be shaken then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud and great glory when these things begin to come to pass then look up lift up your heads for your Redemption draweth nigh may God bless every one of you from the reading of the word please be seated father we ask your blessing on this word made go forth to every heart enrich every life wherever it goes in Jesus name Amen praise the Lord can you join me in that little song we know so well the day of redemption is near praise the Lord we just have in church we're home praise the Lord and and don't let the atmosphere change your approach praise God if you want to praise God praise God want to say howl ooh you matter of fact we need it more at this particular time amen praise the Lord the day of redemption is near for the day of redemption is near men's hearts are feeling for fear oh my be filled with God's Spirit your lamps trimmed and clearer look up your Redemption if 9:00 is here [Music] the signs that the prophets foretold Gentile days numbered with horrors and comfort returned or dispersed to your room for the day of redemption is near very near men's hearts are failing for fear while that's happening be filled with the spirit your lamps trimmed and clear look up your redemption is near there's no doubt that we are living in a terrible day dark days the Bible calls its perilous times Jesus speaks of it about a came of perplexity and in the time of the increase of heart failure men's hearts failing them for fear Wars rumors of wars desta lenses upon the face of the earth dark days the Prophet Zechariah spoke saying there shall come a day that is not dark nor light but at evening time it shall be light that's the promise of God in the hour in which we are living oh what a wonderful song also trouble sometimes are here filling men's hearts with fear freedom we all hold dear now is at stake humble your hearts to God saves from the chastening rod seek the way pilgrim strong Christians a week jesus's car being soon morning or night or noon many will meet their doom trumpets will sound yes all the dead shall arise righteously in the sky going where no one dies heavenward bound everything is pointing to prophecies being fulfilled prophecies of thousands of years are now coming to pass preachers Christianity the faith of God has been pushed aside made an element of of night jokes on television and on radio pushed aside as some kind of a you know a light-hearted thing what we realize this is a serious our men speaking from thousands of years ago have prophesied of this time this season and of this hour yes sir and we are here to identify it with them all of these prophecies pointing to the beginning of Sorrows the tribulation period is slowly coming in it's not going to just appear on one day but with increasing rapidity these types of misfortunes will come upon the face of the earth and the nations as Jesus say will be in perplexity wondering why is this happening why is it taking place why are these things coming upon us with all our economies all our money's all our profit all our military power all of our our scientific power medical power how are we going to answer to all of these problems coming up on the face of the earth right now when men of God told them we fight not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and spiritual wickedness upon the face of the earth oh they were made of a butt of jokes but now they're realizing that we are all facing exactly that on an unseen enemy many unseen enemies and they have they're trying to provide through science certain answers and they will be able to come on the edge of it and provide some relief and some answers to some people but in reality brothers we have the power within our hands because in my name you will cast out devils you lay your hands on the sick and they shall recover the Bible tells us we have attorney over every spirit that controls these germs oh it sounds like fanaticism it's not it's young failing reality of the Living God amen the life of crisis God's life in you those germs and those diseases is nothing but the spirit of the devil back of it and in the name of Jesus Christ we condemned it [Applause] whatever you are I can't give it up your life out of your home out of your hearts amen the Bible tells us as it was with Israel your place the blood on the doorpost and stay in the house stay in the work stay in the presence of God and stay under the blood of Jesus Christ what is the blood Holy Spirit stay under the anointing and the power of the Holy Spirit and God will help you and see you through hey men praise God we see it coming clearly the beginning of Sorrows the coming in of the man of sin amen the atmosphere is being created for this man of sin all kinds of problems are coming upon the face of the earth to create this condition to cause the nation's to begin to desire for a man or a person that can answer all their problems and answer their questions and provide the world with leadership and that Superman welcome - he will come in amen and try to deliver them but you see they want such a man oh my at the same time and Jesus Christ was coming they were asking for a deliverer to take them out of the Roman hands and again we are fast the world is faced with just situation where they're looking for somebody that has the answer and we know the answer for us is simple Jesus is the answer Christ is the answer to all our longings Christ is the answer to all our fears Christ is the answer to all our prayers let us put our trust in him and believe him to the very end amen yes sir they're going to want to have that man and they will have their Superman and that Superman will be none other than the Antichrist absolutely that's the Word of God hallelujah but while their hearts are feeling for fear on the inside let's keep looking up let's look up for jesus said when you see these things and it looks dark out there he says look up because it's light for you in heaven is that right hallelujah even David from way back says I look unto the Lord from whence cometh my help my help cometh from the Lord the creator of the heavens above the earth that's where our help comes from praise the Lord now I want to quote here brother Branham we know you are a messenger sent from God to this church age and the very same signs that follow Jesus were following you and we understand why some who know you best think you are the Messiah would you explain the difference in your relationship to God on of Christ now listen what he says in paragraph 3 84 listen brethren I assure you before Christ that you knew all this part of your piece in other words don't talk nothing like that don't say anything like that right hold your peace but if you were spiritual you would understand praise God don't you know what the very first thing he said down there on the river don't you remember what he said as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of cry your message it's the message that will forerun the second coming of Christ that's what the angel of the Lord said amen praise God so the point is a lot of people have been making fun of the fact that we teach that there is as a 20th century prophet and his name is William Marion Brandon and others have twisted and perverted the message as if to say that we are worshipping or following a man not realizing the very man has denounced a kind of a thing Dino stop kind of a teaching and as clearly said I adjure you before Christ that you hold your peace amen if you are spiritual you to understand amen the first coming of Christ your message it's the message that will forerun the second coming of Christ so what is it not demand but keep your eyes on the message let me repeat not the man but keep your eyes on the message of the hour amen for it was the Spirit of God speaking through that prophet it was not just william branham saying what he likes or whatever he wants to say but it was the Spirit of Almighty God speaking through that prophet and saying what would come to pass in the hearts of the believers and in the latter times amen now another code see as John the Baptist was sent forth to forerun the first coming of Christ you are sent with this message you will forerun the second coming of Christ amen see this message will forerun the second coming of Christ now the message i wanna drill that point on it's the message that four runs and brother branham is dead and gone but the messenger still here and a message is for running the second coming of Jesus Christ hallelujah but not just that listen closely here I want to go to proving his word what is it a testimony that long years ago when that pillar of fare was standing there in the bush like a whirlwind speaking said don't you never smoke or drink there's a work for you to do when you get older people said that boys gone out of his mind mother wanted to call a doctor I was nervous but what was it it's settled right down there at the bottom of that River at the Ohio River and said as John the Baptist was sent to get a people ready for the word to be made manifest so will your message so what's the purpose of this message being here the message being here is said to come to a people to make the Word of God manifested we are here for the word of God to live in us to manifest himself in and through us to fulfill that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen praise God hallelujah now go ahead now a brother is asking brother Branham a question here in question and answers when Christ came along then following John they come to him and they said we've been taught to believe that he Liza would come before the Messiah and he said Jesus himself said if you can receive it this was him that's right and John kept saying I am nothing I am nothing amen see I'm not worthy to lose his shoe what about when Jesus said about him who would you go out to see did you go to see a reed shaken with the wind or what did you go to see some man in fine raiment and luxury things there in King's palaces amen but did you see a prophet he was more than a prophet he was more than a prophet he was a messenger of the covenant the Covenant amen that's what he was he was more than a prophet he was a messenger of the Covenant he was the one that introduced and said this is him he identified the Word of God for the hour as we believe the prophet of God William Aaron Branham identified the word of God for this name and a message for this hour this is him amen praise God you see that's the Word of God so we find out when G John introduced Jesus Jesus was the Word made flesh now in our day brother Branham doesn't reduce the word made flesh but he introduces the revealed word hallelujah that is becoming flesh amen the word was in flesh there but the word is becoming flesh hallelujah that word became flesh that freshman go back to becoming the word and that's why we hear today receiving the word and becoming what we you become whatsoever you feed upon what you eat and we are feeding on that word so that we can become that part of the word that we are hallelujah brother branham for his day introduced him Jesus Christ the word amen his message and that message or that word like Jesus in when he came the first time was to call out as he did the disciples and to claim his own and finally to redeem them by his precious blood this message is here to do the very same thing the prophets message to call out amen and to claim and to redeem us by their word it's the word that you are hearing that redeems you when you recognize who he is that redeems your soul praise be to God hallelujah amen so we find John was a messenger of the Covenant and now we find out brother Branham also is a messenger of the Covenant notice I say a messenger of the Covenant not the messenger of the Covenant for the messenger of the Covenant is Christ the Lord but down through the ages messengers of the Covenant amen the Covenant that word that God sent to his bride for this hour amen we find out you say well what covenant directly won the Abrahamic covenant and to the brides covenant well you say well brother Simon what are you talking about do you mean there's a covenant for us in this day a well of course because we are Abraham's fed seed hallelujah and the covenant was made to Abraham and his seed forever and we are a part of that by faith in the word of the Living God for we believe the promise of the hour this Bible we stand on every promise in the Word of God and our faith rest there completely Amen yes sir praise God now we understand that a covenant means an accord a covenant means an agreement a covenant means a pledge made between two people or persons a covenant is a promise Amen now according to the dictionary it says our binding promise with far-reaching importance amen so when I say we have a covenant we have a we have my friends of a promise from God with far-reaching importance in our definition or my definition simply to make it simply promises made by God to man that is just simply our covenant god's promises made to man for this age that is our covenant hallelujah so we find out God back in the Bible made a covenant with Eve Genesis 3:18 how many knows that that God made a covenant with Eve in Genesis 3:18 when he said that she will send a redeemer will bruise the Serpent's head the seed of the woman will bruise the serpent head God made a covenant also with Abraham right and we find out that in the end God has made a promise with us his endtime bride how many believes that in here yes sir amen what'd you say what promise he made us a promise no matter where you are how lost you are how blinded you were that he would turn the hearts of the children back to the Apostolic fathers in other words God would take the believers the true believers those who would receive his last their message to a god anointed prophet he will turn their hearts back to the original doctrines and teachings of their apostolate father's not the man-made teachings that's been mixed together with denominational traditions and that man's theses theologies but the pure Word of God from the mouth of God's apostles and prophets that is our promise that he will turn our hearts back and I believe my heart has been turned back and that is why I'm here today to stand and identify with a prophet of God and with the word of God for this hour amen I am one of them I'm saying it again I am one of them and I stand with the word of God forevermore hallelujah yes sir praise God for evermore I tell you friends God gave us another promise as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the day when the son of man is going to be revealed amen again amen as it was in the days of lot so shall it be that is our promise also amen we have another covenant when he said I'm not going to leave you comfortless but I go to prepare a place for you a place for you not only heaven that's not only speaking of heaven but prepare for you a body amen amen that you might have a heavenly body you might go back to being one of those heavenly bodies one of those stars of God in other words God he said I gotta prepare a place for you that where I am you may be also praise God hallelujah he's gone to prepare a place for us and that is our promise out of the Word of God that you are going to go to heaven and be in the rapture amen and now he's here to claim and to call his own praise God amen now we find out the entire world is dying now they're in desperate straits now desperate conditions but remember we are in the desert along with them naturally speaking we are in the desert spiritually we're in promised land but we are in the same desert and we have to go through the same trials we gotta pass through the same pestilences and pass through this very same things but we are doing it with a covenant we are doing it with a promise that if the skin the blood under the Blood I will pass I will pass over you promise that he will pass over us if we stayed with his word amen praise God hallelujah now a lot of people misunderstood the miracles of God that he has come done in this desert to this world through the ministry of William Marion Brennan they understood not his miracles in the desert amen now we see clearly of course God made a covenant with Adam and Eve Genesis there I believe is 315 where he gave them a conditional covenant where he spoke to them and said if you will do this this this and this then I will do that I will do that in other words it's a covenant with a condition or conditions upon it you first have to do this list this you're not to eat you're not to touch whatever and I will do this I will do this I will do this then we find out there broke that covenant then God made a covenant my friends with Abraham and that is called an unconditional covenant in other words in that covenant God is saying Abraham you don't have to do anything speaking to Abraham and his seed which includes you if you're a believer are you a believers here today other believe was here today amen then this is unto you amen and unto your children that will believe the Word of God God made an unconditional covenant with Abraham not Abraham if you will if you will do this and do this and do these works and and do these kinds of works then then I I will accept you know God said look this is now unconditional Abraham you don't have to do anything whatsoever you are not required to do anything for I have already paid the price amen I've already paid the price I've done the work already amen all you got to do is believe it and rest upon it hallelujah I paid the price praise God for us he's already paid the price he's already gone to Calvary he's already taken our place he is a substitute amen he's the one that took our place praise God for evermore yes sir says Abraham I've already done it all amen Jesus is saying I already died I already paid the price for you all you have to do all I'm asking you is to love me and serve me believe my word that's all he's asking you to love him and to serve them and to believe his word that is all he's asking you today hallelujah may God help every one of us to love him from the butler hearts to serve him with all our hearts amen oh my and to believe every word of God for men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that cometh out of the mouth of the Lord God hallelujah amen oh how wonderful it is amen yes sir how it was unconditional covenant amen now remember it wasn't Abraham that was in Babylon or down there in all of the child counties and said to himself oh you know today I'm going to I believe I'm going to seek God I'm going to search for God and when I find him then I'm going to repent of all the bad things I've done and ask him to forgive me then he will save me and cleanse me from all my sins no that was not the case this was not a case of man seeking and searching for God this was a case of when God wanted to approach Abraham and his seed that was already in him God approach ever ham ever ham did not approach God and God told him I have chosen you I told you amen but then you were taking in your mind that now I'm going to give my life to Christ I have chosen you before you made any acceptance or any choice I chose you from before the very foundation of the world did not Jesus say to his disciples you have not chosen me but I have chosen you I have ordained you to go forth amen we are ordained of God do you believe it chosen before the foundation in the world of the world amen now watch I want you to understand that it was in the form God Jehovah in the word form body that approached Abraham how did he approach him let me repeat it Jehovah in his word form body him and which was later going to become flesh it wasn't flesh as yet but it was still in the word form a men approached Abraham and spoke to Abraham and gave Abraham that covenant promise and when he approached Abraham the moment abraham believed the promise he United with Abraham God United with that man in now we find out jesus said that promise that happened with Abraham back there or that scene or that whatever you want to call it that took place with Abraham back there is supposed to repeat again in the day when the son of man is going to be revealed when the world is under Noack and sodomite condition he said that would be the hour when the Son of Man will be revealed revealed again the Son of Man would be revealed hallelujah in other words what he's saying there he'll Elohim is going to come and stand before his bride once again hallelujah he's going to come and stand before his bride again and introduce himself so that he might unite with her well I'm here to tell you ladies and gentlemen brothers and sister he your redemption has come the Word of God has come the revelation of this word is here now amen come to call you come to claim you and come to redeem you by the opening of your understanding to the Word of God for this our salvation is my revelation salvation is my revelation praise God hallelujah amen so we ceased clearly dear brothers and sisters amen John the Baptist sprung his first coming and this message that we are receiving is for running the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ amen so we know that we are in the middle of a spiritual Exodus how many believe that do you amen we are now in a spiritual Exodus just like there were back in Egypt we're in a spiritual exodus the first time led by Moses who was led by the pillar of fire amen to take them out of Egypt through the wilderness and into the promised land that was the first Exodus amen then we understand that the second Exodus was Jesus come to take his disciples that were believe him out of the traditions of the elders all of the traditions of the elders and to rip the veil and take them beyond the veil beyond the veil and take them out there from the traditions and from all of those teachings of the elders and bring them to whom to himself the word is that right in other words we believe that the Jesus Christ of Jesus of the New Testament is the Jehovah of the Old Testament we believe they are the Jehovah of the Old Testament created the body for himself in the womb of a virgin and stepped into that body and that being that person was called Jesus Christ and that he said I and my father are one oh my I not speak to thee am he a man he was letting them know that I'm the same God that was back there when he broke the bread and fed 5,000 he's was letting them know this is not just the man Jesus on the outside this is the Creator on the inside for no man can do these miracles except God be in him but God be with him God be in him amen his name shall be come Emmanuel God with us but with Israel he was God above us but then when he came then in the time of Jesus Christ he was God with us with his people but now under the start exodus he's come back to unite with us that he might be Guardian us amen the Word of God made flesh again walking and talking amongst the people the unrecognized presence of the Living God and the true sign overlooked in our day can these things me it is but God is hiding in simplicity and revealing himself in the same thing amen yes sir so he's come back now in the form Elohim come back now in the same word form that he you with Abraham he is now approached an approaching Abraham's seed would to God you're one of them look to God you're one of ever ham seen wherever you are hear the word of the Lord if you are Abraham's seed come to this message come to this word and listen to what you're hearing amen yes sir please come to unite with his bride the Word of God wants to come into your heart so that it can reproduce itself the life of Jesus Christ amen yes sir so here we are glory to God to call this word of God that fast truth the Spirit speaking through the prophet William Marion brand ham amen the word form of God has come to do what to call us claim with and redeem us to unite with us amen and a call us out of what the world systems that's God calling you out of Egypt that's God call your to Babylon that's God calling yours of denominations the modern-day Babylonian confusion God is calling us out wherever you are God is calling you up come out from there my people and be not partakers of their plagues amen God is calling you out from where of you are a man can't you hear the blessed Savior calling you oh my he's calling you this may be your last altar call may God help you today wherever you are calling you out of denominations calling you out of every false doctrine and every false teaching that meat might be out there praise God that you might come and believe his message of grace believe this message of an unconditional covenant not what you do now but you will identify yourself that you are one of them that Esau saw way back before the foundations of the world that you are in him and now he has come to seek and to save them that were lost from his hands them that were already with him and then he lost them he came to seek and to save them that were lost amen oh my how wonderful brother sister that this was a covenant God made with his endtime bride that he would send a redeemer praise God he would send a Redeemer amen we find here in in a sermon of the seals third seal amen he talked about the Hebrew bride how she was wrapped up in her tradition substitutes and refused to accept Jesus Christ Oh word the word in flesh form amen they rejected him as their Redeemer not realizing it wasn't just the man that were rejecting there were rejecting the Word of God made flesh they were rejecting the Word of God made flesh now I'm going to now give you this quotation out of the third seal she that's the bride was promised Eve to be a redeemer in other words the word was promised to be a redeemer her edema would be what let's hear that louder her redeemer would be what the word so our Redeemer is the word of God back then it was the Word made flesh but here it's the revealed word under the anointing of the Holy Spirit that is your Redeemer that's what will save you when God gives you a revelation of it praise the Lord amen I believe there's an old song that passing through my heart No Christ our Redeemer died on the cross died for the sinner paid all his due sprinkle your soul with the blood of the Lamb and I will pass I will pass over you when I see the blood when I see the blood when I see the Blood I will pass I will pass over you amen praise God hallelujah listen when the word came made flesh she rejected it she was given substitutes amen now all that substitute given substitutes to go on until the Redeemer come in other words Israel was given lambs and goats and given washings and given various things which were types and shadows but when de redeemer word came on the scene there were supposed to let go of those types and shadows and enter into the reality of the Word of God amen but what happened instead of that because they were in it for thousands of years they they felt safe under the types and shadows to this very day and they're holding on to the types on the shadows instead of enter into the unfailing realities of the Living God to move from shadow into substance is that right to move from that which was given to them as a as a as a substitute and walk right into the entire truth reveal out of the Word of God but they felt safe enough to hang on to all their substitutes amen and when the redeemer come she wanted to continue with her substitute and rejected the true word see that was the Hebrew bride now amen God has promised paragraph 151 has promised her as he did Eve he told Eve there would come a time that the word would come to her again well of course he's not talking about Eve back in the Bible he's talking about this Eve at this end time the word would come to her again in other words the son of man God Elohim in Word form would be revealed again the word would come to her again in this time see now you remember what she lost from it would be restored hallelujah where we understand now how that ties in with Malachi 4:5 how he will restore the hearts of the turrent back to the father's back to the original word back to the original doctrines back to the original truth that was lost down through the ages right through history from the time of Paul write down it up by the caterpillars and Palma worms and right through the dark ages Nicene council that destroyed perverted the entire Word of God but that word was promised to be restored and the word could only be restored by a genuine prophet the Jews have had prophets through the Angels but thanks be to God he promised that he would send a Gentile profit and that profit would come to a people Amen people that he called out for his name glory to God people that were not a people but he called them out for his name amen now what loss would be restored there's only one think and restored and that's their word only the word can restore you back again hallelujah amen praise God and again brothers and sisters when we look we see the last day bride accepted man's teachings not bride the last day Eve a man who's the mother of all nations right she she accepted the teachings of men and rejected for day of redemption by rejecting the Word of God true a vindicated prophet of God see that's how she she missed the day of her visitation she missed the her Redeemer she didn't recognize her Redeemer because he was without form not coming us that doctor that what he was teaching or what the word was teaching didn't come home from a seminary or a synagogue or from someone the chameleons places it came right out of God's note it was inspired Word of God it was the father speaking through his son amen praise God hallelujah amen yes sir so they rejected the revelation of the word of God for their hour amen except that except brother sister for a small handful just a little flock who accepted a word for their day and they are redeemed hallelujah they redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ how you redeemed by the blood a man thanks be to God have you accepted a word for your day have you accepted your Redeemer for your day who is your Redeemer the Word of God for the hour amen or when the opening of the seals calls him to walk the bloody bleeding word when that word opens up it bleeds your receiver halation coming out to that word of god and the blood drops on you and identifies you that you are one of his own the Holy Spirit comes upon your life and opens up you're under the eyes of your understanding to recognize your day and the message for your day the Word of God for the hour amen yes sir you're a deemed by the bloody bleeding Word of God hallelujah thanks be to God I'm sure glad friends that the blood dropped on me aren't you aren't you glad the blood dropped on you hallelujah sounds like a simple statement but you remember in the Old Testament when the priest had to bring the two turtledoves before him and he will kill the male and the male would be fluttering on the altar and the blood spraying and the blood will sprinkle on the female and then he would set her free with the blood of the male sprinkle her that's why the psalm says sprinkle your soul with the blood of the Lamb and I will pass I will pass over you Jesus took her place at Calvary and his blood now makes us all redeemed and free from sin by the grace of Almighty God hallelujah I'm so glad let me say it again now with understanding I'm so glad that the blood has dropped on me has it dropped on you if you are not aware what it's dropped on you go to him in prayer now and said Lord when you're passing remember me when you're passing by remember me and if you're a true seed of the Living God you are one of his lost ones that lost from before the foundations of the world let me tell you then today while I'm speaking the word he has to pass your way a man because he's seeking you a man he's searching for you for this hour Lord of God hallelujah I'm so glad some of the revelation has bled out of that word amen oh my and has redeemed me by his precious blood amen if you see it accept Jesus Christ amen accept this message and this word of this hour today for the glory of God hallelujah friends as it was with Moses and I'm going to begin to wind this up now as it was with Moses and with Israel there also I must talk about this was a mixed multitude in the whole bunch that followed Moses message there's a whole mixed multitude that came out in the same message in other words it was that more the people following Moses was a mixture of believers make believers and unbelievers there's a vague scripture that even gives us a hint that a few Egyptians that believed what they heard Moses saying also came out with them but you don't hear much of that mentioned but a few of them came out they came out because they they could see that Moses was a genuine prophet and so they came out some of them came out also because they respected Moses because of his natural learning on all that stuff and through influence they came out but nevertheless they came out so it was a big mixed multitude of everything together Jesus puts it this way in his day when he preached the word he said look this is like a man throwing a net in the sea and when the net comes in he says now that man has to go up and separate you know you got to separate the fish from whatever that's inside of the net and that's the same way with the message of this prophet of this last day it went out everywhere all kinds of people came into it but brother we are living in a sifting time we are living in a time when the one of God is separating the fish they wonderful day spiders and the frogs and the snakes and all of the vultures all of the crows he is separating it by the opening of the Word of God a man is going on right now while we're speaking because that same once that followed Moses there them same spirits come back in this age and they're following along in this message hallelujah amen and that bunch is the bunch that always murmuring and complaining always finding fault always got something negative to say my god there were running down Moses that were running them all the things that he said running down the Word of God and everything else why are you doing this way why you do it that way Moses yeah yeah well I wonder if you break that up yourself or you maybe you carved out that Ten Commandments by yourself on the mountain and trying to make yourself a king or something else whatever it's not all kind of wild thoughts begin to go through their mind amen and there were following too but you know they were all in the same conditions they were all in the desert like I said we are all in this world here together we are all in the midst of the coronavirus is I write believers unbelievers make believers everything else true believers everybody is in the same mix but it's your attitude to the Word of God in the middle of the desert look the scripture says God said why do you think I took you in the desert that took you there to try you I took you there to prove you I took you in there to try you on the prove you amen my god to see what really is in you if you're one of my own hallelujah what happened only Josh one caleb was the only two that didn't murmur and and the younger generation that was to come keep your eyes on that because that's what's happening right now it's moving to the younger generation that is to come hallelujah oh my but all those older ones what happened to start to murmur they start to complain they start with everything else like that but the Bible says only Josh 1 Caleb amen Moses on his faithful few Jesus when he got enough eat my flesh drink my blood while you have no part with me which in that two spiritual people he was speaking he meant to eat his word the flesh and drink his blood not his natural blood but of the Holy Spirit right they didn't understand that at that time and the Bible says they walked with him no more that's taking place again today amen yes sir praise God I know what was he left with he left with his his disciples 120 of them met on the day of Pentecost before that history tells us he had about 500 disciples so the majority of them just left him and only a hundred 20 of them could meet in that upper chamber so the same thing he had his faithful few and we find out the this this messenger came and he delivered the words amen now we are following not the man but the message your message will forerun amen the second coming of Christ so we're following that message and of that message there's a lot my friends are falling away we they're all song says many are there that start in the race amen oh my but where are we were they know we're there now so whew so now it's come down to the point amen when God is looking to his faithful few fear not little flock it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom open up all the word to you open up all the revelation to you Amen cause you to see thus saith the LORD recognized it was not the man just telling you this and this is what God said this is what was God said but it was God speaking through the man saying this is not William Branham speaking this is the said the Lord Himself o blessed be the name of the Living God hallelujah oh my you know after all the murmuring and complaining and rebelling and their doubting and their mocking in the wilderness they came to Jordan this everybody has to come to Jordan now are you going to cross over are you going to cross over are you gonna sit right where you are and feel self-satisfied well I got enough for the message I I read all the books I know just as much as you know and this other one know and everything else and you rest and you sit on that and think that that's gonna take you over like that amen hallelujah you know the Bible tells us that bones are all the rest of them bleached out there in the wilderness hallelujah God is challenging us today we'll see how many will survive praise God see if you got to literally be in the building to survive see how you gonna survive you got the Bible you got the Word of God you everything else if there's something real in you I don't care if you were alone in the middle of a desert you will survive but a revelation of this word of the Living God God's little fat woman does she be out in the woods somewhere all by herself she will survive by the revelation of this Word of God amen praise God hallelujah only Joshua and Caleb and young and new and fresh generation will survive amen hallelujah do you believe a new young fresh generation is going to walk right into this church you believe it one by one they're gonna walk in hallelujah sometimes they're coming in droves but a new fresh generation is going to walk right in they're going to start to see all the failures and fallacies and foolishness that came out of denominationalism and they'll recognize the realities of the Word of God and the Spirit cries out come out of her my people and be not partakers of our plagues amen yes sir all the rest of them that wouldn't heed the Word of God the Bible says they wandered for 40 years in the wilderness wondered that don't only mean stray around amen search like that but wonder w om de are not just wmd er about what they wandered they start wondering about this wondering about that wondering about that and while they're wandering they're wandering and they're slipping away from the word of the Living God and from the presence of the Holy Spirit of the Living God hallelujah but just one Caleb they didn't mind paying the price they didn't mind the heat in the wilderness they didn't mind all them serpents that come true trying to bite people and everything else like that they didn't mind the bitter waters of of Mara o Mara didn't mind all those things that were taking place there passed through the identical things that those are the ones were passing through but these ones mocked and doubted and wondered away amen and wondered but these two day God's faithful few this stood firm upon the promises and the Word of God and with God's prophet and a mess yeah man blessed be the name of the Living God hallelujah amen yes sir because they recognize that the desert was a testing ground amen and the testing ground he says o my dear rejoice like what like one of the New Testament writers is when I come forth job said when you try me I'm gonna come forth like gold hallelujah amen come to toll joy when you pass through the fiery trials for the trying of your faith work at patience and patience work at godliness you become more like him Amen because you are passing through the fiery furnace of the wilderness of the grace of God hallelujah so we ought to rejoice in our hearts that we are redeemed amen musicians start coming up we redeemed thank you Lord God's chosen us out of millions on this planet out of millions on this planet God has chosen you and I and I don't mean you and I who are just sitting in this building but wherever this word of God will go God chose you if you will answer his call answer to the Word of God and enter into his grace enter into this unconditional covenant not what Abraham is now what you did Abraham is not what you're doing it's not the works how many prayers you prayed or how many beads you use or have any candles you burn it it's got nothing to do with how many sacraments or how many stations are the cross and it doesn't have anything to do with with this or that it just has to do that I have chosen you hallelujah that same voice is calling I have chosen you come out from amongst them and be not partakers of her place you haven't chosen me but today I have chosen you praise the Lord may God bless your hearts today by the speaking and preaching of his word of God God has chosen this manner to give his word there are
