[0:00] since just as surprised as you are
[0:05] see her Brotherhood florals and so we're
[0:11] here because he loved to assemble in the
[0:16] Church of God with the inspiration of
[0:18] God's Word
[0:19] under the revelation of this hour
[0:21] because we know that that's God with us
[0:25] amen and so that's so let's open our
[0:28] Bibles tonight thank you
[0:32] we're gonna be reading from first
[0:35] Corinthians chapter 13 we're gonna read
[0:46] verse 9 and 10 I'm going to read it from
[0:50] King James Version and then take it from
[0:54] the amplified version and before we do
[0:59] that let's just pray father we just
[1:03] thank you tonight Lord for the
[1:06] opportunity that we can assemble with
[1:09] you because every time you draw together
[1:12] with this purpose in our hearts of God
[1:15] to assemble under your revealed Word of
[1:19] God for this day Lord we get excited
[1:22] because we know that it greatly you are
[1:24] the seed father and so we just ask you
[1:27] to take control of the service now for a
[1:29] speaker to hear the Lord we surrender
[1:32] ourselves to your service Lord being you
[1:36] have control and may you just meet the
[1:39] needs in our midst tonight Lord speak to
[1:42] every need father you're still the same
[1:44] discerner of the thoughts and
[1:47] the hearts of your children and people
[1:49] leave here different than what we
[1:52] entered in Jesus Christ
[1:58] praise God
[2:00] 1st Corinthians chapter 13 verse 9 it
[2:06] says for we know in part and we prophesy
[2:10] in part but when that which is perfect
[2:14] is come then that which is in part shall
[2:19] be done away in the amplified version
[2:28] the same scripture it says for our
[2:32] knowledge verse 9 for our knowledge dis
[2:36] fragmentary incomplete and imperfect and
[2:41] our prophecy our teaching is fragmentary
[2:46] incomplete and imperfect but when the
[2:51] complete and perfect total comes the
[2:55] incomplete and the imperfect will
[2:59] naturally become antiquated void and
[3:04] supersede
[3:08] [Music]
[3:11] so you know I was you know I got a call
[3:15] from past and
[3:19] our surprise our brother just could not
[3:23] be here and so when the call comes you
[3:27] know we have to be prepared so I just
[3:31] immediately started to get nervous you
[3:39] know I immediately actually what I did
[3:41] because I just got pulled work and so I
[3:51] and then I was still nervous and I said
[3:55] water prayer and so I went to prayer and
[3:58] you know I just trusted the Lord and I
[4:01] managed to put this together
[4:03] by the grace of God but you pray you
[4:08] pray and you believe and I believe that
[4:11] we can all be here so blessed and so
[4:14] encouraged because it brings him on the
[4:17] scene when we okay with certain
[4:23] expectation I come with certain
[4:26] expectations together we can do
[4:28] something by the grace of God and so
[4:30] here you know I want to talk about the
[4:33] title tonight is that which is perfect
[4:37] is come and you know collective in the
[4:41] message masterpiece brother privately
[4:45] the speaking here he says now watch
[4:47] every masterpiece is put on the
[4:50] foundation a sculptor he goes on and he
[4:55] says now the bodywork that come home to
[4:57] this great masterpiece was the prophets
[5:00] which was the work I hope you can really
[5:04] see the prophets not the moms
[5:07] it's not the moss that that is actually
[5:11] building the body
[5:13] that is actually giving you your walk
[5:16] giving you your experience with the boss
[5:19] just like the positive therapy speed and
[5:22] you break the law or you're gonna be
[5:24] penalized and there's laws that not
[5:26] pleased with it is word that's for
[5:28] everybody and when you break those
[5:31] possible there's a penalty to those lots
[5:33] but that's not the basis and the
[5:36] foundation of your walk it is not
[5:39] because then it becomes like it doesn't
[5:42] become an experience with God it becomes
[5:44] more of a master schoolmaster and
[5:48] student but we are not students we are
[5:51] sons and daughters of God and become
[5:54] with the revelation that we are a son
[5:56] and that's what the salvation that we
[5:59] experienced was it wasn't that we came
[6:01] to it all turn you know we we repented
[6:04] and on that day we were saved
[6:08] you're a son of all places that would
[6:19] not to you you actually work it brought
[6:23] you into a personal relationship with
[6:26] him and so that relationship was not
[6:31] based on the laws of the word it was
[6:33] based on him the word himself speaking
[6:37] to you and so this party that's being
[6:41] built up it's all for one purpose
[6:44] because back to the Darby it was God
[6:48] without a feed but we need to understand
[6:50] out of us out of this a reflection of
[6:53] Christ is a reflection of God coming
[6:58] down into a human vessel because you
[7:02] desire to fellowship with his after each
[7:05] image we have to express them we have to
[7:07] manifest them and place them in front of
[7:10] him so that he could see them experience
[7:13] them and just it just satisfied
[7:19] praise God it's like you it's like you
[7:22] fellowship with somebody that you love
[7:25] and they start to express back to you
[7:28] what it is that's in your thoughts your
[7:30] mind the the meaning behind the
[7:33] revelation behind what he said it
[7:35] pleases the other person yeah and it
[7:38] brings unity a breeze communion and it's
[7:40] a tremendously and so here now
[7:43] God was building back the body the Old
[7:47] Testament was leading to the coming of
[7:50] the Lord the first coming of the Lord
[7:52] and he used not the law but the prophets
[7:56] to speak the word so that so that the
[8:02] Spirit of God into a human form known as
[8:06] the Lord Jesus Christ somebody to go to
[8:08] the cross and redeem and bring
[8:11] Redemption for the body of Christ and
[8:15] then there's an apple from from you know
[8:18] from the frost and now there's another
[8:21] building of a new body of
[8:23] which is called the body of Christ in
[8:25] the female form it's Eve now being
[8:29] restored and in the same way that he
[8:31] brought Jesus Christ
[8:33] in the 2,000 years ago by the prophets
[8:37] by speaking a virgin shall conceive when
[8:41] that went forth was the Spirit of God
[8:43] prophesied that there would be a virgin
[8:46] so many hundreds of years down the road
[8:48] that would precede the Word of God and
[8:51] come into manifestation what was saying
[8:55] he's still the same yesterday the same
[8:59] thing is taking place now he's using his
[9:03] word to restore the e ya e the body of
[9:08] Jesus Christ known as the pride amen
[9:11] and so here now the prophets not the
[9:14] laws he says the prophets for the
[9:17] prophets was the vindicated word which
[9:19] makes the body not the patriarchs the
[9:23] prophets they were the word and so
[9:29] finally he started way back in the days
[9:32] of Moses and coming down through the
[9:34] prophets to each one and finally
[9:36] building up the body coming closer all
[9:39] the time and then come finally the great
[9:42] egg the head of it all the rest of the
[9:46] body just spoken it the foundation was
[9:50] laid by the Patriots but the body was
[9:52] built by the word Amen man which was the
[9:57] prophets and so in this day God has
[10:01] promised we would
[10:07] the whole ministry but within that
[10:10] ministry within that Bible history there
[10:13] are major prophets Fox of God and then
[10:23] have to speak the word incapacity and
[10:27] you as a son or a daughter of God when
[10:31] you receive your season you become the
[10:37] voice of reaching above getting to your
[10:58] position
[10:58] why is God lead us to get into our
[11:01] position because the body cannot be made
[11:04] perfect without each part in its
[11:08] rightful position can you imagine you
[11:11] take a body you take the arm and you
[11:13] attach it to the knee it doesn't look
[11:16] right it doesn't work right but whether
[11:19] the body is perfectly placed together
[11:21] and each individual recognizes their
[11:24] position in the body then everything
[11:28] starts to work normal everything starts
[11:32] that by itself
[11:34] your body gets weak and get sick it has
[11:38] the spoken word of God that set out of
[11:42] the Lord that he learned all of my
[11:44] diseases
[11:45] it's been spoken to your luck horse
[11:49] manure
[11:58] [Music]
[12:17] [Music]
[12:30] [Music]
[12:50] [Music]
[13:01] to this message that church was not a
[13:05] place but church was actually the
[13:07] mystical supernatural of Jesus Jesus
[13:14] came on the scene their headpiece was
[13:18] put upon him the entire handiwork of
[13:22] duck we find him the perfect reflection
[13:27] of work for he was the word the fullness
[13:31] of the word now God has the perfect
[13:37] masterpiece
[13:41] and here we are now we're coming into
[13:44] our positions because the season is that
[13:49] he which is perfect has come which is
[13:55] perfect has come
[13:57] you see there has to come a time when
[13:59] that perfect word has to come to this
[14:02] body so that it can recognize exactly
[14:05] who she is
[14:07] they better praise God in Colossians 1
[14:16] verse 17 it says that he is before all
[14:20] things and by him all things consist
[14:24] he's the head of the body the church who
[14:28] is the beginning the firstborn from the
[14:30] dead that in all things he might have
[14:33] the preeminence his desire is to have
[14:37] total and complete preeminence in this
[14:43] but the only way that that can happen
[14:46] is that a perfect revelation of who he
[14:51] is in you has to be you have to come
[14:57] into your perfect revelation of the
[15:00] pocketable perfect in this what we start
[15:04] to look to try and be perfect in this
[15:07] because you're only gonna fool yourself
[15:10] this cannot be made perfect this
[15:14] this has to be changed in order to be
[15:17] made perfect change from up of this
[15:20] dimension - your party said chic today
[15:23] police speaking lives and you must be
[15:27] born again and must put on incorruption
[15:31] in order for this interruption it's got
[15:35] to become immortal you cannot become
[15:38] immortal in this flesh you've gotta be
[15:42] looking for perfection
[15:45] [Music]
[15:56] this is receiving God's perfect
[16:00] revelation of you your part and your
[16:05] place in the and so he cannot do that
[16:11] without you giving them full preeminence
[16:14] you've got a comfortable place where you
[16:16] completely and totally surrender your
[16:19] thoughts your ideas your interpretation
[16:23] get rid of your interpretation caucus
[16:26] its own interpreter and we're not
[16:29] looking to try and interpret this word
[16:31] and get into you know why on the Prophet
[16:34] said this you said it that way you know
[16:36] if you don't see exactly that way and
[16:39] you're missing it that's not what it is
[16:41] it's easy to be a parent it's easy to
[16:44] pull what the problem set but it's
[16:47] another thing to have the same spirit
[16:49] that was in the Prophet

[22:24] received revelation wow you you start to
[22:37] operate in your position and Saints I'm
[22:40] telling you I have seen it we are seeing
[22:42] it as the leadership of this church
[22:46] we're starting to see how certain parts
[22:48] into their positions the right place
[23:02] before God wants them to be and they
[23:05] know that and that supernaturally God
[23:07] starts to vindicate that position you
[23:12] wonder why sometimes

[24:28] [Music]
[24:34] [Music]

[25:07] the way you see yourself
[25:12] so we give him the preeminence Ava and
[25:16] so we didn't love her
[25:19] in the message Christ is revealed in his
[25:24] whole word but Bruce has seeped out
[25:27] through the a to be stirred it up from
[25:29] the foundation from the first church age
[25:31] when the seed went in the ground the
[25:34] complete see that had come up through
[25:37] the feet Luther come back up and through
[25:39] Westie then into the Pentecostals the
[25:42] Tonys in the lips see now it's in the
[25:47] eyes prophetic work
[25:49] [Music]
[25:57] [Music]
[26:13] [Music]
[26:17] [Applause]
[26:18] [Music]
[26:29] [Music]
[26:44] [Music]
[26:56] and so forth now there's nothing but
[27:05] [Music]
[27:16] [Music]
[27:26] [Music]
[27:36] [Music]
[27:53] that which is perfect is come Wow things
[27:58] are going to change when that revelation
[28:01] which is perfect about you comes in to
[28:05] you personally if your walk with God
[28:08] things are gonna change around
[28:10] you're gonna realize that that all your
[28:13] reading is about of the station because
[28:16] that perfect work cannot fail so he said
[28:19] the next is the intelligence and we have
[28:22] no one temperature tomorrow see what
[28:25] Brad was was was was prophesied this why
[28:29] he was seeing exactly how this why he
[28:33] was gonna all come together 55 years
[28:40] later since the Prophet has gone off the
[28:42] sea and here we are and this body is a
[28:46] lot further along than it was back there
[28:49] and how you the left by the revelation
[28:52] they get received from this hour
[28:56] and how it's giving you perfect faith
[28:58] listen I don't know about you but I got
[29:02] involved in a lot of different things in
[29:04] life we turned a lot of different things
[29:08] you get excited for two months three
[29:11] months five months later and here we are
[29:17] some of us I'm twenty five hundred and
[29:21] twenty-fifth year of this message I work
[29:25] cycle the Word of God because I've seen
[29:30] come into supernatural manifestation
[29:39] you know they are so been me teaching
[29:43] them that we came from as a southern
[29:49] government because you are a son or
[29:53] daughter you always work that's why we
[29:56] feast on the fresh revelation that's why
[29:59] you've beast on his presence when you
[30:02] come into the house the Lord we thirst
[30:04] and under after you see and so here that
[30:11] what brother was actually seeing that
[30:14] intelligence to the box because it's all
[30:23] based on the word being spoken he's done
[30:27] the same yesterday today and forever
[30:28] don't look for anything to change your
[30:31] gonna go of the translation because of
[30:33] the revelation coming to the Bible
[30:35] ministry these open directly into you
[30:39] and you can see that you can contact
[30:43] with it there's a deep that possible
[30:45] doing in response and the spot takes
[30:48] place and something supernatural starts
[30:52] to happen and you start to realize this
[31:07] [Applause]
[31:13] [Music]
[31:16] what happened position as a song God you
[31:20] see the difference when you get that
[31:23] that's why that's why Holy Spirit left
[31:25] every church age because men started to
[31:28] put his own interpretation of the word
[31:31] let us never forget we do not put our
[31:35] alternate interpretation on where to go
[31:37] what happened to the seventh under
[31:39] doctrine both endlessly truth but when
[31:43] they take it and they make it into
[31:45] something where they say to somebody you
[31:47] don't see this there's something wrong
[31:52] you need to see you're not with
[32:08] your character you're falling back
[32:11] you're being left by a personality
[32:14] that's why you can't let my personality
[32:17] we can do that by the word it's the word
[32:20] that gets free from this pulpit that
[32:22] excites us and why we come into the
[32:25] house Lord they the 300 so the next is
[32:29] the intelligence and we have no
[32:32] intelligence of our own we have no
[32:33] strength of our own I can foresee those
[32:37] things
[32:39] it's God himself see it's becoming to a
[32:42] place and he's governed the body all the
[32:45] way through that he completed the body
[32:49] of Christ then the complete body of
[32:52] Christ is revealed in the form of a
[32:55] breath that was taken out of his side
[32:59] Allu and so like Adam did the beginning
[33:02] like others plus rather at the beginning
[33:05] all right the entire Bible is the entire
[33:09] revelation of Jesus Christ making
[33:12] himself known to every page he made
[33:16] himself known to the victim
[33:18] Peter has a foundation the church waits
[33:21] like he did keep the devil kanessa this
[33:24] is everything that we see in the
[33:26] scriptures it's always a perfect type of
[33:30] what Christ is doing right now in the
[33:35] church everything regardless that's why
[33:38] he told Moses of you see Christ in every
[33:42] word of the Bible you're missing
[33:44] something you need to go back because
[33:46] this God himself
[33:48] condescending in the plan of redemption
[33:51] amen he comes from the beat up see he
[33:55] come from the head down until he come
[33:58] down so by herself become flesh at the
[34:00] foot of the ladder now here in the New
[34:03] Testament he brings himself right back
[34:06] - they have both to be proud even
[34:10] everything is a perfect type and so we
[34:15] now recognizing that God sent a prophet
[34:17] to restore the Word of God also
[34:20] recognize that in 1963 came down to me
[34:29] that was 1963
[34:32] that's like 67 or 57 years ago correct
[34:40] me if I'm wrong okay 63 37 is a hundred
[34:48] and then 19's over 57 years right since
[34:52] the body of since the head came down to
[34:55] the body he's been working for 57 years
[34:58] now to us we think in time but to God
[35:04] he's eternal he doesn't think in time he
[35:09] doesn't need you as a creature of
[35:13] eternity he sees you as a son
[35:16] all that needs to happen is his thought
[35:20] expressed to you in who tomorrow brings
[35:24] you into your decision and it can change
[35:26] and that's why youth with this miracles
[35:29] sometimes because God can instantly
[35:32] change your situation it's really
[35:36] changed her sickness instantly change
[35:39] your financial position
[35:41] it's really changed your relationships
[35:44] and it can instantly do those things
[35:47] because he's got me but he needs us to
[35:50] come to my recognition of how Christ
[35:55] operates in the body to the place where
[35:59] you start to recognize how to apply the
[36:01] Word of God knowing what to do with the
[36:05] Word of God
[36:05] the wine now the intelligence
[36:08] controlling blood and so Betty started
[36:15] and rising sea from the feet he begin to
[36:19] build the church the bride coming back
[36:21] on back and now coming out into the head
[36:24] slowly where it all turns together and
[36:27] makes the one great transfigured body of
[36:30] Jesus Christ
[36:33] now not he says now it's set and dig
[36:38] itself the day between that time will be
[36:41] kind of like oh like a dis little dark
[36:43] thing so it'll be like you know the
[36:47] evening time it'll be kind of like where
[36:50] there'll be a lot of uncertainty and
[36:53] that's the page that were actually in
[36:55] right now that's why the message is
[36:57] flowing through this this change right
[37:00] now because it's in that stage of light
[37:03] and darkness and there's a great part of
[37:05] the way that's taking place because as
[37:08] the word gets Lord we deal it's what a
[37:12] manifest darkness and the microcephaly
[37:16] it's not that you are going to are so
[37:20] much that people are falling away though
[37:23] that most
[37:24] actually that you are progressive in the
[37:28] Word of God and you're moving on to
[37:30] those that don't have this revelation
[37:32] they just can't keep up they just can't
[37:35] stay with it there's some reason they
[37:37] just can't keep up that consistency they
[37:40] start this he says you have to make it
[38:14] over it as a son or daughter of God
[38:16] you've been given Dominion so you gotta
[38:20] be careful of what manse that's driving
[38:23] you and pulling you and taking you from
[38:26] the things of God the simple things of
[38:29] whatever position in the church I see
[38:34] some individuals you know their cleaners
[38:39] [Music]
[38:56] [Music]
[39:10] [Music]
[39:17] [Music]
[39:34] and we must stay in this discipline time
[39:41] and there's there's there's you know
[39:44] there's a lot of falling away that's
[39:48] taking place that should actually
[39:52] encourage you to see that Scriptures
[39:55] being just getting out much closer to
[39:59] the actual goal way of the church praise
[40:06] now I'm just going to continue reading
[40:09] here that Christ is revealed as a little
[40:11] girl he says but now it's in the I tell
[40:16] you to see see now there isn't one movie
[40:20] the faculty beyond the I is the is that
[40:24] my brother burger delivered he was a
[40:26] prophet he saw he was given patient he
[40:31] saw this church age and in the twentieth
[40:34] century
[40:35] bleep mess he saw that he had come to
[40:38] extort
[40:44] he saw

[42:08] [Music]
[42:26] [Music]
[42:47] [Music]
[42:56] [Music]
[43:04] there was different people you see that
[43:16] was what I saw some kind of
[43:21] interpretation of but this is not the
[43:24] scene age this is the relationship and
[43:27] this is the seven seals and the seventh
[43:33] seal in particular that contains your
[43:35] name on the book of life
[43:38] this is a lot of supernatural column
[43:40] that
[43:59] you get sick and tired of these these
[44:02] these trials and the situations that you
[44:05] have you can see in Thailand but that
[44:11] something raises up in you which is
[44:14] called holy ghost
[44:56] [Music]
[45:18] what you are supposed to be glory so
[45:25] where that age now this is back to your
[45:28] eyes there's nothing that moves he says
[45:31] and now we find out that that part is
[45:33] she there is nothing beyond the eye then
[45:36] come the Pentecostal age that would come
[45:38] into the different fingers and things
[45:40] the Pentecostal age talk about Louise
[45:43] reviewing it all up toes and nose and so
[45:46] forth no it's in the past do you realize
[45:49] where he was we're not in the Isaac
[45:52] we're beyond where the supernatural

[46:44] [Music]
[46:54] [Music]
[46:57] this is he says now it's in the odds
[47:11] what good will you need eyes or need but
[47:14] if that eyes was there to see there has
[47:19] to be I first see and then that come he
[47:24] open the seven seals and reveal the
[47:26] evening
