don't tie you down okay I have three scriptures um Ephesians 610 to 18 um okay Matthew 41:10 and re um 2 Corinthians 10 3-5 um Ephesians 610 Ephesians chapter 6: 10 from yeah 6 10 to 18 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might the put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the walls of the devil that's the W of the devil is the tricks of the devil and by put on the whole Armor of God you able to stand against that tra of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities rulers of the darkness of this world against the spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God which is the true word of God that he may be able to withand in the evil day I believe if there is an evil day this is the day amen you are in the evil day but he said that and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins get about with the truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shut with the preparation of the gospel of peace about have all taken the shield of faith that is apply the faith in the word of God wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fire dos of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spiritual the word of God and praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there onto with all perseverance and supplication ation for all the saints and then let's read Matthew 41-10 it's a Bible study so I hope you guys don't mind then was Jesus led up of the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when he had fasted when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward and hungry that means that he wasn't hungry during the fasting but the scripture is saying that after the fasting he was hungry so um those Pentecostals that they say they fasting for like two months three months it's all kind of if you truly fasting you are feasting with the Lord so you're not going to be that too hungry as those people are because it was after then he was hungry and we know that you have to be led by God to fast and when he put in your heart to do then he's going to feed you and that fasting going to be rejoicing not going to be like a bing amen and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the Son of God command that these Stones be made bread but he answered and said and said it is written my shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God then the devil take him up into the holy city and seted him on the Pinnacle of the temple and said unto him if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear the up lest at any time thou shall Dash thy feet against a stone Jus says unto him it is written again thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God Amen again the devil take him up into an exceeding high mountain and show him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and said unto him all these things will I give thee by God if thou Bow Down and Worship me then said Jus unto him get the hands Satan for it is written thou sh Worship the Lord thy God and him only shall thou serve in the last scripture then we going to just two scriptures here second 2 Corinthians 10 3-5 2 Corinthians 3 10-5 2 Corinthians 10 sorry 3:5 for though we walk in the flesh we do not walk after the flesh for the weapons of our welfare are not caner but Mighty true God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalt itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ amen please be seated Hallelujah if I should um title this I'll title it um how to defeat the enemy God have shown us ways that we can defeat our enemy and you have only one enemy that the devil it's not your brother or your to anybody is the devil is our enemy and he comes in various ways and he has his wild that's the Ws of him a lot of tricks in his uh bosom whatever it is so he always apply those tricks and he never give up so when he try one thing you overcome he come another way he changes his form and always trying with all kind of tricks uh to what to um to defeat you but as a son or daughter of God God has also given us what antidote to all his tricks so we have the anti because God being God is infinite God and before the foundations of The World God knew you I will be here so God is Not Like Us who going to make plans today and then change it and then do this tomorrow when he said something that it so his word that he gave us to overcome the enemy but the enemy also has a lot of tricks remember we are Body Soul and Spirit so our five senses we contacted with our body we have hearing see taste smell feel and yeah in this and then the spiritual have your conscience subconscious love affection reasoning memory and all those things so the devil play with all those things your reasoning the the main thing that he used is the reasoning he deceived if by what reasoning and he has not left that and one other things that he used is doubt and also he uses um disbelief because if you disbelieve God's word then he gu you so um I read this here A quick look at those scriptures which involve the Lord Jesus overcoming will bring out the truth of this propositions that is in the church ages book in Matthew 4 where in Jesus is tempted of the devil he overcame the personal Temptations Temptation Of Satan by the word and by the word only in each of three major Tri that corresponded exactly the Temptation Of The Garden of Eden the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life Jesus overcame by the word he fell to the personal Temptation Of Satan Time by failing to use the word and Adam fell in direct Disobedience to the word but Jesus overcame by the word and right now let me say that this is the only way to be an overcomer also it is only way that you can know it if you overcome because that word can fail amen so say said Heaven and Earth will pass away but God's word can never pass away it's said let every man's word be a liar but mine be the truth so the word of God overcome Satan at any place anywhere at any point in time amen the only way that he can defeat you is when you get away from the word remember Satan has no power on his own the only Power he has is the what you give to him everything that God gave us an example when he asked God permission to try job when God gave him permission what did he use he used fear and everything that job feared came on him so the tactics of the devil is to cause you to fear fear is false evidence appearing to be real so when that fearce comes into your thought and you accept it then he G you but Christ came to give us a sound mind and what and and a peace so you don't entertain those thoughts that is contr the word of God Amen I'm not saying that those thoughts will not come they will come but you have power in the name of Jesus to rebuke those those thought as he said get hands the behind me Satan don't entertain and feed on those thoughts because the thought of God is what um what everything that is what um everything that is lovely that is of good report think on those things amen but the enemy triy to come to be like a cockroach He's a fly he came like a fly put this thought here put this here he's trying but remember those things cannot overcome you they are not your thoughts andless you accept it once you accept it then you have power and then you're going to bring this this that that that but you have also the right to accept the word of God in your heart in your soul and when you accept that then everything Godly flows through you it becomes H automatic so we have come to the place that there's the greatest battle ever fought is going on now and that battle is in our mind it's going on De devil want to what control it and God also wants to control it but it depends on which one you gave him the preeminence I subject mind to the Lord Jesus Christ to take absolute control over all my thought my conscious sub conscience everything I give it to him tonight amen because you have the right to accept God's thoughts you have the right to think right thoughts I remember years back yes the enemy tried to put something in my thought I know this is contrary and then I was trying everything fighting about it and I don't know how is it sometime you play something that you know is not right and I was working as brother Michael was saying in East York I remember and then I was singing and the anointing of God came on me and something spoke and said you are saved don't let devil what play with your mind so I'm telling you tonight if the en put anything in your mind remember you are saved he just a what a bluff he only tried to play with your mind and your senses reject it you doubt your doubt and you accept God's word amen I'm doubting my doubt now I'm accepting God's word amen because that's the only thing that what will bring you Victory and will give you um it will let you overcome the devil and his ways because you have the right to think God's thoughts those are not your thoughts he said above all things you have the right to think those things that are edifying those things that what are lovely those things that are of good report so think on this amen we are on God's side and one thing I realize on that day he is the one fighting our battles none of us can fight because this enemy has 6,000 years experience and you cannot defeat him but he that overcame he lives in you he lives in me he is the one overcoming him so our job is finished we all have to just relax and let God have his own way and take control because he will never leave us nor forsake us he's the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah praise God and one other thing too um as you read as in the Garden of Eden what happened the enemy went and he reison with Eve the mistake Eve made was that she should have told him my husband is not here talk to my husband and our husband is the word of God so we hide behind the word of God but she tried to face it by herself and facing that enemy with all his tricks and everything he used reasoning and if stop for a moment once he stopped he got him he sorry he got her like bra gave us an example of M Sanders in the greatest battle ever for when she repented and received the Holy Ghost and then then she heard that music and she stopped for a moment to try to what win souls that's where she got her mistake so don't stop for a moment if God has revealed something to you act on it don't wait because what happen is that when in the span that God reveals something to you if you wait for too long the enemy can come with all kind of reasons then this one will come this one will come then you got to reason this reason but when God reveals something to you and you knew it's that said the Lord you act right away because you check in the bible say that on the same self day Abraham circumcised his household on the same on the same self day Jacob did this on the same self day Isaac did this so when God reveals something to don't wait don't procrastinate and if God has placed something in your heart act on it don't procrastinate because tomorrow may not be there for you today is today let's do today's work today because we have power in the name of Jesus in the name of overcome Stan and all his strengths because he overcame he conquered hell death and Grave so that we can also conquer all those because he has conquered for us we just have to walk on and what please him amen our God is good all the time Hallelujah the devil in that Temptation with God he knew the word about 99% of the word he knew it but the difference is Jesus Christ was the word so knowing the word and being the word is two different things if you are the word and that word lives in you are part of him you are part of at attributes he can't deceive you he can bring all his lies and said and can quote even better than you can quote and give all kind of quotations but remember it's a revelation that makes a difference the letter kill it but the spirit giveth life because he he misapplied the word to the Lord Jesus Christ at that time he said that oh if you be the Son of God cast yourself down and he send his angels to vaku those things it God did not tell us to tempt him said do not temp the Lord thy God when you are in a situation and that happen he'll be there for you like he said if you eat poisons it will not what harm you but you will won't go and tempt God by going to take a poison to eat so it is so he misapply the word and the devil always miscode the word of God but you being the word of God you will recognize this is not from him amen because you are part of him you are part of St so the same way Jus Christ defeated him back then and that part of Christ is in you and me you cannot be defeated temporary he can make you up and do this or do that but God in you amen will wake up and say no this is not that this is not that you able to place everything right amen because you are the part of the word you are part of him and he's part of you hallelujah our god is awesome God hallelujah he's the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah he never changed amen hallelujah the devil has not changed God has not changed it's the same tactics to use Hallelujah and what is happening is that in every country when they go into war they prepare and they steud the tactics of their enemy they just don't go and just go for like that they sit down they plan the how to approach that war and remember the instruments or the ammunitions or the armor arms that they used in the first world war when the second world war came if you go apply the same arms you not you not going to we mic you it's that obsolete you'll be defeated flat the third world war coming or like um in the second world war they have to use machine guns and everything for that age and if you go and use the old one it's not going to work even in our time you think Russia when they fighting Ukraine all those Old Second World machines it did anything to them they have to borrow something from Iran Iran to help them because an obsolute it can't stand the condition for a time so is the word of God and you can even go back in science development they have moved from airplane to moon and all those things everything is Advanced so you can't go back and use H and buy in this age that we are living in sir hor and buggy will not work amen so is the word of God the word that fall in the time of Luther was gold that said the Lord justification but that was TR by them it was able to meet the conditions at that time but it can't meet the conditions when Wesley came on the scene because it was sanctification adding sanctification to what Justice justification so so in the Pentecostal age it was what baptism of the Holy Ghost has come down a more powerful say and those who are children of God they March off with the word of God they will not go back and try to use sanctification to meet the enemy at that time because sanctification in the time of Wesley was good but it was good for Wesley time it wasn't good for the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen because the enemy his streets has advanced he's gone higher so you need more higher um higher machines to face him higher anointing higher spirit of God to face the enemy you can't go back and use sanctification thing then after the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost himself is here God himself because listen he didn't leave this in the hands of any man he took it upon himself he's the lamb that open the seals when the seals were open the Bible became a new book The Prophet look at it from a different angle from that time the mighty Angel himself came down and open that book it's an open book so the anointing is changed to a higher Octan and no one can bring that himself going to bring you to that stage you can't bring yourself there this has to be done by God himself no one can put you there he himself will put you there if you are part of him you're part of his attributes he bring you to that level it's not you putting yourself there it's not by works of righteousness but by his grace and grace alone you are part of him so the enemy cannot do nothing about it so when that se were open the Bible became a new book God came down amen because why enemy trick has gone higher amen hallelujah even the braam time it wasn't wiing like this he was worried about this but now those demons we have more than 15 or 100 genders and lesbians and every Spirit F Spirit has been loose how can you fight this with the wether fall in the time of Luther time or Pentecost you can't you need a fresh anointing you need a word for present time even what fall on yesterday cannot do you need something fresh from the throne today to anoint your heart and your soul to overcome the enemy because the enemy has a lot of touches a lot of traes in his bosom he's always trying this trying that he come to you and attack you with sickness and then he said that oh God will not even hear your prayer oh God the day the day of Miracle is passed he's going to bring all kind meanwhile he bring the sickness that he came back and whisper in your heart oh listen to the doctor's report but the True Believer will say by his stripes I am healed I am the Lord God that Health all your disease amen said that I the Lord God that heal all he healed all your disease amen bless the name bless the the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless the who has what um forgiven all your iniquities and what health all your disease so he is a tricker he's a liar from the pit of Hell so you don't listen to his Whispers sometimes the things he's going to tell you it looks all true like your physically flesh it looks like he he true it's lying he did that to the prophet he said oh your young man you serve God you fast you prayed you did this you did everything and when he came to your own he let your daughter died he did it said life from hell and the prophet was almost water Fe on that but greater is he that is in him than he that was in the world so something rose up and said the Lord give it and the Lord take it blessed be the name of the Lord amen so you need a fresh anointing fresh word of God to overcome the tians of the enemy that is the only thing that will help us in this journey Our Own Strength our own wisdom our own effort it will not do it even raising up of our children the word has gone to a higher level the so the the the internet this that in our time me raising up my parents knows everywhere I'm going they know my friends they know the house I'm going where I'm playing but we are in what scientific age you can be home with your child speaking to somebody in Germany or in Ireland or we don't even have a clue what was going on in their life because of communication that they having how can you fight this with um Luther message you need a present stage of his ministry to overcome all those Spirits so it's very very important that you stay on with the word do not apply the Do Not Mis apply the word or mislocate it by the revelation of the word of God that will lead you and guide you to all all truth um he said that in um in in that H in uh Ephesians 6 over there he said that in Ephesians 6 six above all taking the sheld of what of Faith where you shall be able to quench all the fa DS of the wicked apply that word with faith because remember the letter kill it but the spirit giveth life so you need that re relation of the word from him to be able to defeat the enemy in every circumstances because the word of God will defeat Devil any place anywhere at any time amen so I doubt your doubt now don't allow him to put any doubt in you or misbelief because that's why no one said the pro the Bible said that all things are possible to them what that believe God emphasized that listen you cannot approach god with any negative thing that's why James said that double-minded are always double minded are always what um I forgot exact subject unstable you have to be stable you have to be positive you have to approach god with positive ity knowing that God's word cannot fail he honors his word more than his name when the enemy Rise Like A Flat his spirit will always raise a standard amen he said that my word will not come out void unless accomplish what it was sent for so your purpose here will be accomplish by the word of God in your life no matter what if God has not finished with you no devil in hell can take your life he can what attack your spirit can attack your flesh but your soul is in God my soul is in God Amen he can attack the Flesh and do whatever it is but that soul is in God Amen always praise praise God and please God know what the said the soul that siners shall surely die but the soul that come from the Throne of God is in God Amen the devil cannot do nothing with it and the word of God is what embracing it the come around it is that word of God that's where you going to defeat him all the time because his Titus is always caused the human being to disbelieve God's word but God's tius is to what let you believe his word and put it there because listen you have your conscious you have your subconscious you have everything your memory and Sam bra said if your memory or your conscious or subconscious everything this believe this way get rid of it don't allow them to what um to to don't allow Satan to put anything contrary to God in there and accept it if it's contrary the word of God get rid of it if your memories things that you remember is contrary the word of God get rid of it to resist the devil and he flee from you because he's a is is a is a frog always going to bring the things back go back oh this one Pastor Danel was saying somebody has done you something 20 years and you still remember and dealing with that no forgive and forget and move on with your life those things has happened is God permitted that I like what P salmon said one time he said that anything that comes my life God permitted God allow it to come to my life so I'm it came for a purpose sometimes those even came to shape you it came to give you different perspective because some of us sometime we play so much confidence in one in our brothers or human being but God doesn't want us to do that so those people God some sometimes could let them fall flat and do something that my goodness how can this brother do this but God is also watching your your your response your reaction how you are reacting to that he's watching all that so God sh not his glory with anyone one time as brofi was saying somebody said oh he left the church because this one has done this this one has done that that's one has done that he said my brother if God call you you w't leave the church it's not that person that call you no matter what they have done they didn't call you God gave you your salvation look beyond the Flesh and move on and serve God because we are not fighting against flesh and blood God is also tempting you remember when you read that scripture about Temptations of the Lord Jesus Christ the devil came to him in his weak time when he was hungry when he was hungry after the fasting and prayer he came at the weak spot he knows how to attack when you are down in the valley he'll come and attack you with everything but remember greater is he that is in you that he Us in the world in every time God raise up a standard the only way you remain there is if you refuse the toxin it's like he said when the doctors you go to a doctor and you are sick and he gave you a medication and if you not take that medication you cannot blame the doctor because the doctor has done his part so is the word of God when God reveals something to you or God tells you something and you fail to act on it and becomes a problem to you don't blame the pastor don't blame anybody blame yourself myself I hate people who try to put their blames on others it's my responsibility to what act on the word of God my responsibility to take care of business I don't care what anybody has done or what anybody has told me I'm going to do what God has told me to do I not going to blame anybody I'm going to take responsibility for my actions amen because if you do not take responsibility for your actions you try to run away because you accepted it like I always say it if someone gives me advice and I go and act on it and I get a good results and some most you take the glory for yourself oh I did this I did that and I got that when the person give you advice and I think that's not work oh this brother told me to do this that brother told me to do this and didn't happen why are you blaming the brother he was only advising you you have the right to accept it or to reject it once you accept it it has become your word it has become your responsibility so is the word of God once we accepted that word of God it has become our word that's why elah I say unto you I say this I say because that word has become part of you amen so it's your responsibility not brother Abraham said not this one said when that word is revealed to you you can say I said this why because the same God in the prophet in him is in you and he's doing exact same thing so that has become so clear to you so you can confidently say that this is that this is that you are responsible for that don't hide from your responsibility Amen Let God have his own way Hallelujah let's work one love one another thank you and just be there for one another in times of whatever it is because when someone fall let them let's raise them up don't let push them down amen hallelujah praise God I don't talk too much so I'm going to end very shortly I have couple of quotes I'm going to read and then I'll keep on whatever the time is when hard God puts my heart I'm going to read this about the um the am of God hallelujah praise our God Amen and amen hallelujah it says that in paragraph 68 the armor of God now we find that this great enemy of God thought now as long as they believe that word I can never get to them as long as you believe that word the devil cannot get to you as long as that little family in Eden keeps behind that word I can never touch them neither can he today he cannot touch you today as long as you keep that word fortified with you that's right he still block of right but if I can use some real good strategy and just reason I give some human reasonings because she's human and if I can just give human reasoning then we win the battle Satan and his angels but then Eve gave away so therefore we know our enemy by his attacks maybe you didn't get it just right the way I said it we know our enemy when anyone any Spirit any person triy to disagree with God's word remember that that's your enemy that's your enemy we know this old attack that's the one he broke the human race down and that's the way he breaks them down yet today and that's the way he gets you away from God is to disbelieve his word and the only way that you can ever stay in fellowship with God and talk to him in the cool of the evening is say fortified in the word on both sides let the K of God's word drop all around you and you be dropped right in the middle of it that's right then you are fortified glory amen so anything that is agree with the word of God that's your enemy it's not your brother or your sister when that word comes and this is is contrary to God's word that's your enemy but if it's in line with the word of God then it's your brother it's your friend because said above all things are which thou May prosper and be in health even as heav as your soul prospered so God wants us to be healthy God wants us to prosper God wants us to proper in both in three dimensions Body Soul and Spirit and he said that the work that I do shall you also do amen because it was one Jesus Christ when he died he broke himself into many member bodies and it was a bra bra as a wave sheep God took him we have many member body so we are the ones that God is using for today so greater than this shall you also what do because he gave us power over every cleans gave us power over the enemy he said in my name you shall cast out Devils when you lay your hands on the sick they shall recover it's a promise to the believer we just have to accept it when a situation happens when a condition happen apply the word of God don't listen to the doctor's report their reports are always negative but God's report is positive amen so I believe God's report amen yes you have to go to the doctor yes you have to take the medication yes you have to do everything human possibly that you can do but your eyes is on the word of God your eyes is on Christ because he was the one who was wounded for what your transgressions bruised for your iniquities the Chas of our peace was upon him and with the stripes we were healed period that's what the word of God is for me so accept that promise and move on with your life no matter what don't listen to Devil's lie he is a Lie from pit of Hell and he has no power over you than the one you going to give him so I chose not to give him a opportunity I chose to surrender my heart my soul my mind everything the Lord Jesus Christ that God will have prence listen if this gospel is truth and I believe it is truth amen then I owe everything my soul my mind my everything I owe to this gospel I support it with my mind my ti my money my everything I have to support it because listen the same thing the apostles when they realized and it was revealed to them that Jesus Christ was God they gave their life for the gospel they sold everything they have they gave their life they allow they gave their life some they cut their head They Crucified Peter um what his head down they put John in the oil to burn him because they know this is that set this is the truth so if you have come to that point and we know this is absolute and there's nothing that come close to this then I give my all to this it doesn't matter what I go through doesn't matter what tomorrow may bring I'm Standing on the Promises of God because that promise will never fail Heaven and Earth will pass away God's word will not pass away my friends will disappoint me my wife can disappoint me my children everyone can disappoint me but God will never disappoint you what a friend we have in Jesus what a FAL St of a glory Divine where you have to commit every to him in prayer he's the only one who not cannot disappoint you there's nothing in this way that you can put your hand 100% on it apart from him he is a source of your supply not your boss as pastor always told us God uses those bosses don't get me wrong I'm not being arrogant you respect your boss and do it with all your heart but behind that the source of your supply is God himself amen he promised he will never leave us nor forsake us so let's trust him no matter what comes he promise he going to take us through it's not easy with all the troubles and all the Temptations and as the Bible says that evil day we are living in I'm not saying it's a joke but when we apply this word of God to every situation every time we're going to have Victory we going to have victory victory in Jesus Christ victory is mine amen victory is mine Joy is mine Hallelujah through the word of God that word of God will defeat him at any point at any point in time amen so hallelujah amen my sins are gone amen I've been born the amen hallelujah I've been set free Amazing Grace amen hallelujah amen listen I believe that God has call us as his children it doesn't matter how much the level that we have reached in Christ everyone of us needed just a closer work with God just a closer walk with him every day in our lives that should be our prayer all the time a closer walk with him all the time walk with him closely let him walk with us closely as he walk Enoch walk with him and you walk and was not so let's walk closer to him let's ask him every time for a closer walk with him that's only now dress closer to him and when you walk closer to him when everything comes he give you the inspiration without even thinking about it he make it easy for you I love the testimony that gave when he was thinking about the presence of God came when that thing came you know that said the Lord nothing can hinder it it will come to pass amen so let's walk closer to him and just do our best and the last scripture in Ephesians said that praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there on to with all perseverance perseverance desperation and supplication for all the saints sometimes I I wonder that we are not desperate enough this is a desperate hour when you read the news and you see things that are going on it's not a time to sleep it's time to be desperate in every situation yes we are God's children yes we are saved yes we are part of him but God cannot do anything unless he uses s and you remember that in Hebrew samel said that all those they are all Wai on it all the saints of old the prophets whatever they wanted they did everything and they without us cannot obtain the promise they are waiting on us so it put a lot of responsibility on our show this when you realize that but what makes it easy is that we realize we cannot do by ourselves so we ask for the grace of God the mercy of God and he takes the burden and he take care of every situation amen so that's all I have for tonight I know we have to go back to work um let's pray um anyone that want to get a little more closer to God just open your raise your hands and let's pray oh our gracious Eternal god um I thank thank you for the word that you placed in my heart I've just spoke what you want me to speak Lord um I I believe and it's the heart of every Christian to draw more closer to you I just pray that you draw closer to us just a little closer to us every day in our walk that's what we asking for whole Spirit of the Living God if there be any doubt anything hiding anywhere we come against it in the name of Jesus may your spirit have preeminence draw us more to yourself and just a little closer work with you granted Jesus Is My Player amen and amen for [Music]
