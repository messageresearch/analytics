[26:18] glory you will get a blessing I will get
[26:20] a blessing from the Lord because With
[26:24] God all things are possible
[26:27] yeah I won't delay each and every one of
[26:30] you time
[26:31] first
[26:33] I want us to remember our beloved pasta

[26:39] prayer nice to see the
[26:42] coming incoming pasta Forest is coming
[26:46] The Mess by God's will next year

[26:56] Danny
[26:57] and mother sister Jennifer and we have
[27:01] to lift them up that time
[27:04] uh we won't call him brother Danny no
[27:07] more we have to call him Pastor Danny

[27:14] you have to honor the office
[27:17] if you don't honor the office God will
[27:20] not honor you
[27:22] I believe in that from the bottom of my
[27:24] heart because God is the one that we
[27:27] have to look into
[27:29] because God is up to something big
[27:33] it doesn't matter you or me it's all
[27:36] about him

[27:56] line
[27:57] please pay attention because God have
[28:00] something for you to hear this evening
[28:03] uh I think the brother put the
[28:06] scriptures is I don't have a big big
[28:10] um
[28:12] thing but God is the one that is big
[28:15] it's Matthew chapter 8.
[28:19] Verse 18 to 26.
[28:22] that's what the lord gave me in the
[28:25] scripture for this evening
[28:28] I'm not a big big I would say big
[28:31] preacher I am the least in the kingdom
[28:33] of God
[28:35] and I just preach what God placed on my
[28:38] heart
[28:39] and it's up to God to do it if he
[28:42] doesn't do it I cannot do it so let's go
[28:46] into the word
[28:48] uh
[28:49] brother
[28:51] Ayman can you lead us in prayer this
[28:53] evening before we read the God's word
[29:00] yes Lord
[29:06] yes Lord
[29:14] amen okay Matthew 8 chapter 8 verse 18
[29:20] to 26 goes now when Jesus saw a great
[29:25] multitude about him he gave commandment
[29:28] to the path into the other side
[29:32] and a certain
[29:34] scribe came and said unto him master I
[29:39] will follow thee
[29:41] wherever
[29:43] whatever whatsoever thou goes
[29:47] and Jesus said unto him
[29:50] the forces have holes and the Bears of
[29:55] the air haveness but the son of man had
[29:59] nowhere to lay his head
[30:03] and another of his disciples said unto
[30:07] him Lord suffer me first to go and bury
[30:12] my father but Jesus said unto him
[30:16] follow me
[30:19] this is mine
[30:21] topic follow me
[30:24] and let the dead bury their dead
[30:29] and when he was
[30:31] enter
[30:34] into
[30:35] a sheep his disciple follow him
[30:39] and behold their rules a great Tempest
[30:45] in the sea and so much that the ships
[30:48] was covered with the wave but he was
[30:53] asleep
[30:54] and his disciples come to him and awoke
[30:59] him saying Lord save us we perish
[31:05] and he said unto them why are you
[31:09] Faithful
[31:11] o e of Little Feet
[31:15] then he arose and rebuke the waves and
[31:21] the Sea and there was a great camp
[31:26] please
[31:27] be seated
[31:29] may the Lord add his Blessing
[31:36] God does not change about his word
[31:41] his word Remains the same thing today
[31:46] brother Brown says God is his own
[31:49] interpreter
[31:51] and he make his work plain Before You
[31:54] and I
[31:57] God Don't Need No Man to interpret his
[32:00] word
[32:01] but obedient to his word you and I will
[32:06] bring the word
[32:08] to fulfill the way God has ordained
[32:12] so when God was here
[32:15] that time
[32:17] I believe
[32:19] so many that were following him didn't
[32:21] know who he was
[32:24] they thought he was just ordinary man
[32:27] just preacher
[32:29] a poor maybe preacher
[32:32] and he says to them follow me
[32:37] right is the same thing today
[32:40] when God
[32:42] is saying
[32:44] we should follow him
[32:48] a true preacher
[32:51] when he is preaching
[32:54] if you don't watch it his preaching will
[32:56] be like a dictatorship
[32:59] or command
[33:03] because when you take it literary
[33:07] because they are preaching always look
[33:09] like command
[33:12] because
[33:14] they are not if it's a true send
[33:18] by God chosen by God
[33:22] he is rather pointing you to go Jesus
[33:25] Christ
[33:26] he's not pointing you to himself
[33:30] but he's preaching
[33:32] and his way
[33:34] if you don't watch it and you take it
[33:36] Canna
[33:38] it will look like oh who is this man
[33:41] telling me to follow him
[33:45] that's why you read the scriptures
[33:48] the Bible says some of disciples when
[33:51] Jesus accept you eat my flesh drink my
[33:54] blood you have no part in me some just
[33:57] walk away
[33:58] tear the crowd
[34:01] they follow him no more thank you my
[34:04] brother
[34:05] why because they were looking to a man
[34:11] but they were not
[34:13] seeing what was
[34:15] behind that skin
[34:18] because when you recognize
[34:23] God voice
[34:26] God Waits
[34:28] is opposite
[34:31] towards man wisdom mankind wisdom that's
[34:34] why he says my ways
[34:38] my wisdom is foolishness to the world
[34:41] God wisdom is foolishness to the world
[34:45] because why
[34:48] it always appeared like dictatorship
[34:52] when he's in a voice
[34:55] when you speak he looked very
[34:58] powerful
[35:00] very
[35:02] precise follow
[35:04] obey
[35:06] I'm not talking about wordless speaking
[35:09] at work or at somebody who wanted you
[35:13] are in Military and they are telling you
[35:14] obey that is man
[35:16] part telling you to obey take it
[35:20] spiritually
[35:22] when God servants are speaking
[35:26] they speak with authority
[35:29] because they know who they are
[35:32] and they know who is behind them
[35:35] they know who ascended their purposes
[35:40] and their ways is
[35:43] follow
[35:47] follow
[35:49] because if you follow
[35:52] all you're gonna see you won't see the
[35:55] man
[35:56] you will see Jesus
[36:00] but if you are thinking
[36:04] who is this man talking like this
[36:07] who is this bullheaded
[36:10] or who is this
[36:12] excuse me to say naturally he may look
[36:14] like dummy outside talking to you
[36:17] who is this
[36:19] ignorant person or literature Domino too
[36:24] much educated man because God can use
[36:27] any or Christ of people
[36:31] then you take that upon yourself
[36:35] and you walk away
[36:37] then you have become like
[36:40] you remember
[36:43] Naomi have a root and the other one was
[36:48] uh
[36:50] root and oh
[36:53] the name doesn't come they were twin
[36:55] they were two
[36:57] uh oppa is it oppa unless I go in the
[37:00] scripture anyway there were two by root
[37:04] hooked to Naomi the other one gave now
[37:07] uh now uh Naomi kiss and left because he
[37:12] was not seeing what it was about to
[37:15] happen
[37:17] and so is it today
[37:19] we have to look
[37:21] into the voice of God
[37:24] because all you need is not a man
[37:29] a man can do nothing
[37:33] one time when God looked down Every Man
[37:36] Has sinned against God all Humanity has
[37:39] sinned come short before God God was
[37:42] looking for one person to save mankind
[37:46] did he God maybe the pope because he
[37:49] wear white clothes
[37:51] so he could save us
[37:53] the pope couldn't get become holy
[37:57] to save us
[37:58] the Kings in the air none of them
[38:03] he took the Lamb of God which is the the
[38:06] Lord Jesus Christ
[38:09] and all he's saying to us in this last
[38:13] days
[38:15] I am here
[38:17] you that are my wife
[38:21] I chose you before I created heaven and
[38:24] earth
[38:26] I told you before the foundations of
[38:28] this world if you want to know that
[38:31] so I have placed myself already in you
[38:35] and when I'm speaking through a body
[38:39] don't look at the natural part
[38:43] Look Away to
[38:46] the voice because my word is spirit
[38:51] and life
[38:52] and the series already the root of David
[38:56] portion of the root of David is already
[38:58] in you
[39:00] so you allowed your heart
[39:03] to open
[39:05] so that when the spirit wanted to speak
[39:09] to you you can recognize it
[39:12] whatever the spirit is saying to you so
[39:16] that you move
[39:17] because otherwise
[39:20] you're not able to catch the words that
[39:24] pertain to you for your day your message
[39:28] because too many
[39:31] educated
[39:33] when I say educated I don't mean
[39:35] somebody that has finished University
[39:37] alone
[39:39] some people who can read and write
[39:42] knows all the quotes of brother Abraham
[39:45] knows all the quotes in the Bible
[39:47] try to use that and hide behind the
[39:50] pulpit
[39:51] and deceive
[39:53] but
[39:54] I have all my children in the palms of
[39:58] my arm
[39:59] not one of you is going to be lost
[40:02] not one of you is going to be anyone can
[40:06] deceive you because you know what my
[40:10] word is spirit and life you were with me
[40:13] before the foundations of this world
[40:16] so you know my voice
[40:19] you know how I behave how I do things
[40:23] because when I speak it will break your
[40:26] heart
[40:27] Satan always take the mind
[40:31] but I took the heart
[40:35] the god that we serve
[40:38] is an unchangeable God
[40:41] he always will ask you follow me
[40:46] sometimes you'll hear his voice
[40:49] by quiet place
[40:52] sometimes he comes to you by a sister
[40:55] talking to you sometime he come to you
[40:57] by even a stranger a drunker a
[41:01] prostitute
[41:02] right I remember the time I was
[41:06] traveling
[41:07] in my life first time of going to Europe
[41:11] I don't know nobody to turn to as soon
[41:13] as I enter the praying I look it was
[41:17] at that time it was DC-10 they don't
[41:20] have it no more
[41:22] and I entered a plane
[41:25] a thought says I saw a prostitute girl
[41:27] and a thought says go and ask her a
[41:30] question
[41:32] so that he will help you
[41:35] I didn't doubt I just went
[41:39] and spoke and believe me
[41:43] it was a blessing to be because he
[41:47] helped me
[41:49] through his boy that was a pimp
[41:52] they helped me out make my my journey
[41:55] easy have a place to sleep in Germany
[41:58] which I didn't know anybody
[42:00] they helped me and showed me always till
[42:03] I could know my way out
[42:06] so tomb up to the voice of God
[42:12] then you can follow where he's living
[42:16] because if you don't do like that
[42:19] and you're gonna learn to man opinions
[42:22] when I say man opinions those that know
[42:26] the letters
[42:28] but they don't have
[42:30] the root of David in them the seed of
[42:33] God in them
[42:35] they're gonna deceive you
[42:38] we are in the hour when it's so dark
[42:42] but I want to tell you there is a man
[42:44] here who has turned on the light
[42:47] his name is the Lord and Savior Jesus
[42:50] Christ
[42:52] and he is calling his own
[42:56] he is speaking to his own
[42:59] as we all know
[43:01] in here
[43:03] we have heard so much
[43:06] God is pouring himself so much
[43:10] in the way of fight for Ministry even if
[43:15] you look at me
[43:17] a little little like a little baby in
[43:21] the word of God
[43:22] but let me tell you
[43:25] you may say I'm small
[43:28] yes I am
[43:30] but the way God has poured himself
[43:33] if you have an eye to see you can see
[43:38] what God has done how much more our
[43:41] brothers
[43:44] that are capable
[43:47] you're talking about teaching we are
[43:49] brothers here that God has raised they
[43:51] teach you talking about a
[43:54] if you are in problem we have brothers
[43:57] here that God will use them to solve the
[44:00] problem in the word of God you talking
[44:03] about encouragement we are brothers here
[44:06] that God
[44:07] who has raised their preaching will
[44:11] encourage you
[44:13] so there's nothing lack
[44:16] for you
[44:18] our God is saying follow
[44:21] because in the time of Joshua
[44:24] there was no nonsense
[44:27] there was nobody
[44:30] all the slack all the lukewarm
[44:34] all the Egyptian Garrick have to fall
[44:37] away from the Israelites
[44:40] and they have to follow Joshua
[44:43] so that and who is the Joshua the Holy
[44:46] Spirit
[44:48] you may think I'm talking about man yes
[44:51] but it's not real man I'm speaking to
[44:55] I'm speaking to you
[44:57] as brothers and sisters that we we get
[45:00] serious and followed away because the
[45:03] word is your leader the word is your
[45:06] guide
[45:07] the word is your absolute
[45:11] so when I said Joshua I mean the Holy
[45:15] Spirit
[45:18] he is the one that leading us
[45:22] so follow
[45:27] me when you follow
[45:29] your own lack of nothing
[45:32] when you follow
[45:34] everything gonna be all right
[45:37] but when you don't follow
[45:40] you're always going to have problems
[45:43] don't lean to your own understanding
[45:48] all your ways acknowledge Him
[45:52] and he shall direct your path
[45:55] because it's unchangeable God
[45:58] the god of brother Abraham brother
[46:00] Abraham is dead he's gone for his reward
[46:03] but the holy spirit that let him
[46:07] and preach and message the world have
[46:11] never seen at this 20th century
[46:16] that Holy Spirit is still here today
[46:21] that power of God is still here today
[46:26] it doesn't matter what you need
[46:29] put it before the Lord
[46:31] listen
[46:33] whether it's even leading you to the
[46:35] Grave don't be scared he's with you
[46:39] he won't forsake you
[46:41] he will not forsake you
[46:45] listen God is God
[46:47] no matter what he does he is right
[46:51] absolute right
[46:54] so we have to obey
[46:56] when we obey
[46:58] everything gonna come up right
[47:02] sometimes they want you to get sick
[47:05] so that you could even
[47:08] share his word with somebody
[47:12] some people you want them to be rich you
[47:14] will see in your lifetime sometime money
[47:17] will come to your hands
[47:20] because he wants you to go to places
[47:23] or touch some people's life
[47:27] because he know what he's doing
[47:30] so let us not backslide
[47:34] but
[47:36] follow the Holy Spirit
[47:39] because Joshua is here
[47:42] our Joshua who gonna lead us into the
[47:47] Rapture is here
[47:50] because this is not the day of brother
[47:52] Abraham time
[47:54] brother Brahm died in 1965.
[47:57] but Joshua is here to do the job
[48:01] Joshua is just spreading his wing
[48:04] the eagle is spreading his wing
[48:07] and calling us
[48:10] that
[48:11] I am here I am in charge
[48:15] I am control
[48:18] I have you in the palms of my hand I
[48:21] will take you through I will lead you
[48:25] wherever your footstep
[48:27] I have given to you
[48:30] because you are mine
[48:33] don't be afraid
[48:35] be be courage
[48:38] don't be
[48:40] so
[48:42] thinking that you are nothing you are
[48:44] somebody
[48:46] you are somebody in my eye
[48:50] I love you that's why I came to Calvary
[48:53] and share my Broad
[48:56] they beat me
[48:58] they reject me
[49:00] they prosecuted me
[49:03] they stripped me naked
[49:07] and put me on the cross
[49:10] I am here again because of you
[49:14] because of you
[49:16] I'll share my broad I'm not gonna let no
[49:20] man
[49:21] deceive my children
[49:24] when I say let there be light
[49:26] who go and eat and bring the light
[49:30] I the Lord let the light appear
[49:34] that's the way I do my things
[49:37] that's the way
[49:39] I'm gonna do my work
[49:42] I'm doing my work that way
[49:45] so open up your heart don't look for
[49:49] personalities
[49:52] big man
[49:55] because God doesn't deal with that
[49:58] God deal with his seed
[50:01] and he deal with how he has ordained the
[50:03] person
[50:06] the person may come
[50:08] you may not like him because he doesn't
[50:11] preach the way you want
[50:14] but it doesn't matter look if God is
[50:18] inside
[50:19] what he's saying
[50:21] because
[50:23] Jesus is the one that ordained
[50:26] ordain doesn't come from man
[50:30] can pray for you
[50:33] man can tell you I ordain you but if
[50:36] your ordain didn't come from
[50:38] the father that dwell in Jesus
[50:41] you better watch out
[50:44] because
[50:45] it is him that ordained
[50:49] it is him
[50:50] that position and replace his people
[50:54] and whoever he choose
[50:58] then we have to obey as he has chose our
[51:01] brother
[51:02] let me tell you he who have I know
[51:07] that yes God has chose
[51:11] we are not we are not babies
[51:14] I am not a some chicken that gonna
[51:18] scratch the ground
[51:21] the Holy Spirit knows me and I know him
[51:26] I know God is weak
[51:30] I have met God
[51:32] listen me even I do
[51:34] the Lord have to drag me here
[51:37] because I'm not a hypocrite
[51:40] I'm not people that wanted to get in the
[51:43] pool brother I just speak my heart okay
[51:46] my heart I'm not a hypocrite I tell the
[51:50] truth
[51:51] God
[51:53] knows whom he has chosen
[51:57] as we the church move on line up
[52:01] if you know
[52:04] you don't line up line up
[52:07] because God won't permitted us to fool
[52:10] around
[52:13] God will not permit you to fool around
[52:16] even me to fool around
[52:19] he's gonna mean business the scripture
[52:22] have to fulfill
[52:25] what he has spoken
[52:27] true brother Braham
[52:30] is now in US
[52:34] he been sowing his seed
[52:37] in US
[52:39] and that seed have to come Plain View
[52:44] that seed have to come pray with you
[52:48] otherwise
[52:49] is just a joke and a bluff and a lot of
[52:53] talk
[52:56] because God have to do he says I will do
[52:59] a quick
[53:00] and a short week
[53:03] that quick and a short work is coming
[53:06] upon us
[53:09] to fulfill it
[53:11] the hour is at hand
[53:14] too many people want a joke
[53:18] even check they don't want to come
[53:21] they don't want to come to church
[53:24] listen
[53:26] they put you in Ukraine fight
[53:29] they put you in the front
[53:31] you're gonna go there and sleep
[53:35] you're not going there to sleep
[53:38] then Russia bomb work hit your head and
[53:41] you'll die
[53:44] you have to make sure
[53:47] there's the bullet they give you you are
[53:50] shooting because Satan doesn't sleep
[53:53] he's shooting
[53:56] so you have you're gonna have to be
[53:58] Sharp to fire
[54:04] if you can fire Satan will fire you
[54:07] one day maybe God help me and I get here
[54:10] I'll bring a message about that if you
[54:12] don't fire your man go Satan will fire
[54:15] you
[54:16] because the gun need to be fire
[54:20] this is not a Time the gun gonna be on
[54:23] the wall
[54:25] we are coming to a time when the gun
[54:27] needs to be fired fire the enemy
[54:30] because
[54:32] the enemy is not sleeping
[54:35] but he looked like we human being
[54:37] sometimes we get lost
[54:39] because our eye can see nothing I
[54:42] remember one time we came to prayer
[54:44] meeting
[54:46] the Lord came down he says I'm trying to
[54:49] call every one of you to come to my
[54:52] presence
[54:53] you are sleeping
[54:55] you are not coming to my presence
[54:57] because your eye cannot see what is
[55:00] going on
[55:01] you your eye can see through this this
[55:05] war
[55:06] but if I open your eye to see what is
[55:09] coming after you
[55:11] you run
[55:14] to me all the time
[55:17] the world is in such a turmoil
[55:21] the churches has rejected Christ
[55:26] churches a lot of them has rejected
[55:29] Christ
[55:31] so the spirit of God where God
[55:35] has got
[55:36] the people
[55:38] that has taken the prophet message
[55:42] seriously
[55:44] a preacher that has surrendered his
[55:46] heart that is ordained then God is
[55:50] serious about his way
[55:54] God is serious about you
[55:58] God is serious about you your own
[56:01] children
[56:03] it's time if you haven't repent
[56:06] and baptize you sitting in the church
[56:09] you're looking at me
[56:11] get yourself into the water
[56:15] no time to joke
[56:18] no time to fool around
[56:21] no time to mess around
[56:24] it's dark
[56:26] out there
[56:28] the spirit of God is calling
[56:31] because we don't know
[56:33] when the dog will close
[56:35] I I don't know when the door will close
[56:39] but brothers and sister
[56:41] is getting dark
[56:44] all over the Earth
[56:46] it looked like
[56:49] they are coming after us
[56:51] go to fill the pressure
[56:54] don't you see the squeeze
[56:57] that is in the world
[57:00] economical pressure
[57:02] religious even pressure
[57:06] people don't want to come to church
[57:08] it looked like the preacher have to beg
[57:11] them
[57:12] the preacher have to drag them brother
[57:15] no say
[57:18] are you with Christ
[57:21] or you are with the world
[57:23] Joshua said are you with us
[57:28] or are you against us
[57:31] if you are with us
[57:33] stand behind beside Joshua
[57:38] and God will bless you
[57:41] God didn't call us for picnic
[57:44] this road is not a picnic game
[57:48] it's not a picnic game
[57:51] it's not something you are here today
[57:54] you gone tomorrow we woman being that's
[57:56] the way we want to do things
[57:58] but God is saying no follow
[58:02] don't question follow
[58:04] the word that comes here
[58:07] follow it
[58:09] let me tell you God knows my heart
[58:13] today
[58:14] I wasn't thinking of come and preach
[58:18] that
[58:18] by last minute
[58:21] I as soon as my my eyes saw that
[58:25] scripture I started feeling
[58:30] and I know the way God deal with me I
[58:33] feel that's the way you give me him he
[58:37] says that's the scripture so I just
[58:41] says yes Lord I don't know how I'm gonna
[58:44] speak but as I get here
[58:47] I am so trusted in him
[58:50] that whatever
[58:53] he want me to speak he will come and
[58:56] speak otherwise I am just dumbing and
[58:59] I'm gonna make a mess
[59:02] but I pour my heart
[59:05] the best that the Lord knows if there is
[59:11] anything he doesn't like
[59:13] he should take it from me because I want
[59:16] to help my brothers and sisters because
[59:19] I want us all of us to team up in Christ
[59:23] so that all of us will go into heaven
[59:26] because I don't want one to be lacked
[59:29] behind I don't want to stay behind
[59:32] I I don't want to miss the tree I don't
[59:36] want you to miss the trade you young
[59:38] ones all
[59:40] young I want all of us to go because you
[59:44] know why
[59:45] they always late
[59:48] it's late
[59:51] it's late
[59:52] Jesus
[59:54] is calling
[59:56] he's telling us follow
[59:59] if you follow
[1:00:02] I will lead you through
[1:00:04] how you gonna do it it's not by
[1:00:07] education
[1:00:09] is not by raising some people are
[1:00:12] literate but they raising more than
[1:00:14] educated people
[1:00:16] I know that
[1:00:18] because I meet her
[1:00:21] they are illiterate but they will
[1:00:23] raising you more than educated person
[1:00:27] because remember everything is a spirit
[1:00:31] as a woman being Spirits in US
[1:00:34] conspiraciness don't need education
[1:00:37] it's a spirit devil have you ever seen
[1:00:40] devil spirit that go to university he
[1:00:43] says I sit here I'm a devil and I'm
[1:00:45] gonna study and get my PhD no
[1:00:48] we human beings steady by the spirit in
[1:00:52] that person if it's a devil is a devil
[1:00:55] born as a devil
[1:00:58] so raising the Risen
[1:01:02] what am I trying to say
[1:01:05] I'm trying to say
[1:01:08] we don't have to question nothing
[1:01:11] just be like a cow
[1:01:14] either way that is coming
[1:01:16] How You Gonna
[1:01:18] produce make
[1:01:20] the cow either glasses he produce milk
[1:01:23] at the end of the year for his master
[1:01:27] Jesus expects you to follow
[1:01:31] when you follow and obey
[1:01:34] he will do the work
[1:01:37] you're gonna see signs and wonders
[1:01:39] coming out from you
[1:01:42] once you either wear the word gonna
[1:01:44] produce that for you to see
[1:01:47] you're gonna see healings coming out
[1:01:49] from you you're gonna see wisdom coming
[1:01:51] out from you you're gonna see patient
[1:01:54] coming out from you you're gonna see all
[1:01:58] kinds of God wisdom
[1:02:00] God intelligent to the world is
[1:02:04] foolishness but all gonna flow through
[1:02:06] you
[1:02:07] but if you don't eat away
[1:02:11] a kind
[1:02:13] because you know why
[1:02:15] God gonna ask you to do certain things
[1:02:19] no man can do
[1:02:22] no educated person with his Education
[1:02:25] wisdom will do that
[1:02:28] because God
[1:02:31] will tell you okay
[1:02:34] you see this house go
[1:02:37] said something to the person
[1:02:41] and maybe if you are rich let's say he
[1:02:44] sent you to the poor person please
[1:02:46] that place think
[1:02:48] that place you never enter the womb that
[1:02:51] room before
[1:02:52] the Lord is sending you there
[1:02:55] and if you are going you have to hold
[1:02:57] your nose would you go
[1:03:00] if you just reason about it me Rich Man
[1:03:03] like this
[1:03:04] why would I go or poor
[1:03:08] go to
[1:03:10] the rich people please tell them Point
[1:03:13] their finger and tell the person
[1:03:14] something
[1:03:17] would you go me poor person
[1:03:19] how can I go talk to this Rich would he
[1:03:23] respond to me
[1:03:25] you see you're gonna reason the word out
[1:03:30] in your life
[1:03:31] but if you allow Jesus
[1:03:35] take over
[1:03:36] brother
[1:03:37] let me tell you
[1:03:39] sometimes he take you to even King
[1:03:43] you speak the word with boldness
[1:03:46] as the word he put in your mouth
[1:03:50] whether it's poor place
[1:03:52] you speak the word with boldness because
[1:03:56] you have no reason you have become like
[1:03:58] a baby a child
[1:04:01] a child doesn't raise me
[1:04:03] they do things
[1:04:05] they don't raisin says this that figure
[1:04:08] it out this way that way this wisdom but
[1:04:12] they speak
[1:04:13] and do things
[1:04:17] like
[1:04:19] animal in the bush I always said when
[1:04:22] they are thirsty
[1:04:25] there is something guiding
[1:04:28] they just follow
[1:04:30] they go and they drink and they fool if
[1:04:35] they are sick have you ever seen
[1:04:37] yesterday as matter of fact
[1:04:39] I saw a friend dog
[1:04:42] he was walking with the dog the dog saw
[1:04:44] me I was walking he fall down
[1:04:47] he lay down like that he started eating
[1:04:50] glasses
[1:04:52] the glasses and I was
[1:04:55] the owner they don't have no idea about
[1:04:58] what the dog was doing but me being back
[1:05:01] home used a dog as a child and I see the
[1:05:04] way dog behave I knew
[1:05:06] the dog is chewing the glasses maybe
[1:05:09] he's from he's going through some pain
[1:05:11] or something so he's chewing the glasses
[1:05:14] so that he'll go and lay down later then
[1:05:18] he will get healed and drink water and
[1:05:20] he will get healed right so I told him
[1:05:23] you wanna
[1:05:24] he's hiring the dog to go I says no
[1:05:27] don't do that to the dog what he's doing
[1:05:30] is right I know what he's doing he's
[1:05:33] chewing the glasses you see he doesn't
[1:05:37] raise him he obey his master
[1:05:40] we call it a nature
[1:05:42] right
[1:05:44] that's the way God want to use you and
[1:05:46] me
[1:05:48] by faith
[1:05:50] Abel offer unto God
[1:05:54] more excellent sacrifice than what came
[1:05:58] and God testify of what his gift
[1:06:02] if we obey God
[1:06:05] will do things
[1:06:09] to us
[1:06:10] Small Voice you hear him
[1:06:14] speaking sometimes you speak loud
[1:06:18] sometimes you come to church
[1:06:21] he will use a brother to speak something
[1:06:23] even against you
[1:06:26] and he hate you why did the brother say
[1:06:29] that
[1:06:30] God is trying you
[1:06:35] you elect resistors say something
[1:06:38] and you know what the person that you
[1:06:41] love
[1:06:43] from the bottom of your heart
[1:06:45] God knows your heart more than anybody
[1:06:48] even more than the pastor more than the
[1:06:51] contrast to anybody
[1:06:54] I don't know your heart you don't know
[1:06:56] my heart
[1:06:58] God no
[1:07:00] so he does that to try you
[1:07:04] to see you love him
[1:07:06] and if you true love him
[1:07:10] you may not understand but be patient
[1:07:15] that's the time God wanted to reveal
[1:07:17] himself to you
[1:07:19] if you have patience
[1:07:21] God will show you things
[1:07:24] then it will be a blessing to you
[1:07:27] because he's trying to pull you out from
[1:07:31] your mess
[1:07:33] because we human being we have things
[1:07:36] hidden in our heart and we cover it up
[1:07:40] and we become like a you see a cat
[1:07:43] a cat meow meow you see that one when
[1:07:48] you rub it
[1:07:51] all the clock going and it's stay calm
[1:07:54] but if you don't rub it good
[1:07:57] then you see all the crow come out and
[1:08:00] if you don't take time power
[1:08:03] right so God knows
[1:08:07] some of us better than ourselves we have
[1:08:09] a cat Spirit hidden day and you want to
[1:08:13] get it out
[1:08:15] so he will let a sister or brother come
[1:08:18] to you with that
[1:08:21] to pull that cat Spirit out
[1:08:24] and what are you gonna do
[1:08:27] to see whether you love him
[1:08:30] remember one says
[1:08:32] my father is dead
[1:08:35] Lord I want to go and bury my father
[1:08:39] Jesus knowing the heart he says Let the
[1:08:42] dead bury their dead
[1:08:46] you think he's easy even right now
[1:08:50] your pastor that preaching to you Pastor
[1:08:53] I'm going to bury my my dad
[1:08:56] the pastor look at you
[1:08:58] tell the dead Meridian dead me that kind
[1:09:02] of Pastor I'm not going to that church
[1:09:04] no more
[1:09:08] out there that Pastor speak to me like
[1:09:11] that
[1:09:12] it's a test
[1:09:17] is a test for you
[1:09:21] okay it's a test
[1:09:25] he's watching your reaction
[1:09:27] but if you are patient
[1:09:30] because God wants to reveal things to
[1:09:32] you
[1:09:33] God wants to show himself to you
[1:09:37] then
[1:09:39] you get angry
[1:09:42] and you leave
[1:09:43] no
[1:09:45] not if you're a True Believer you get
[1:09:47] angry you can even go
[1:09:49] but a little while you are coming back
[1:09:54] you will come back
[1:09:56] because God
[1:09:59] has already spoken about you
[1:10:03] before you came to this earth
[1:10:05] listening
[1:10:07] if I look since I'm here what people
[1:10:11] have done to me in this church
[1:10:13] I wouldn't even stay here one hour
[1:10:18] I will be gone
[1:10:20] I'm not lying to you
[1:10:23] I'll be number one to leave
[1:10:27] things even while you are in the world
[1:10:31] you know the worldly people they are
[1:10:34] playing if they're gonna chop your head
[1:10:36] off they will Chop It Off
[1:10:38] but sometimes Christians
[1:10:42] will look like pilot outside clean
[1:10:47] and we walk like this
[1:10:50] but meanwhile that snake is ready
[1:10:55] like in Ghana
[1:10:58] one person I met
[1:11:00] assess was a taxi driver I said it
[1:11:03] before
[1:11:06] I said
[1:11:08] how are you he says Oh by God's grace
[1:11:10] I'm fine I says oh God bless you for
[1:11:13] that
[1:11:14] I says I'm going this place how much you
[1:11:16] want to charge me I'll find out the
[1:11:18] price
[1:11:19] says I want to charge you 35.
[1:11:23] and the the price is 18.
[1:11:27] and I I turn around and tell him
[1:11:30] why is it that you have put
[1:11:33] Jesus in your lips
[1:11:36] but back of your
[1:11:38] tone
[1:11:39] you have put the Cobra there
[1:11:46] right you have put a code right there
[1:11:48] like once you said Oh by God's grace I'm
[1:11:52] all right you want me to lay down and
[1:11:54] there's so many
[1:11:56] in the message
[1:11:59] are doing that
[1:12:01] in this message
[1:12:06] so God wants you to open your heart to
[1:12:09] him
[1:12:09] when you open your eye to him he show
[1:12:12] you things
[1:12:15] right then you see
[1:12:18] so
[1:12:20] follow Christ
[1:12:23] Paul said
[1:12:24] follow me as I follow Christ but if I
[1:12:28] don't follow Christ
[1:12:30] then why are you gonna follow me
[1:12:34] right
[1:12:35] if the pastor is following Christ
[1:12:39] follow him
[1:12:40] if he doesn't follow Christ
[1:12:43] out of the door
[1:12:45] you're gone
[1:12:46] because it's not a man you're gonna
[1:12:48] serve it's not a man you're gonna
[1:12:52] bow down to
[1:12:54] we are not in Africa where
[1:12:57] the king sit in the throne or England
[1:13:00] I can enjoy you go those that are around
[1:13:02] him they go over their days like that no
[1:13:06] no or like the pope and all the Cardinal
[1:13:09] you have to go no no no no no no God
[1:13:12] that God word is not like that and I'm
[1:13:15] not putting them down that is the world
[1:13:17] the way the world live their life
[1:13:20] but God we have to obey God
[1:13:24] we have to follow Christ
[1:13:26] we have to allow them to do his job we
[1:13:30] have to let him have his way in our life
[1:13:34] because we are brothers and sisters when
[1:13:37] you see a true brother or a true sister
[1:13:40] that the holy spirit is heading
[1:13:43] you tell them sister I love you in
[1:13:46] Christ
[1:13:47] the brother you tell them I love you in
[1:13:49] Christ because we are all going one
[1:13:53] place
[1:13:55] you see black there you see why there
[1:13:58] you see in the other day you see Chinese
[1:14:01] there you see all Spanish there you will
[1:14:04] see all kinds of race
[1:14:08] so why
[1:14:10] should you
[1:14:13] hate one another
[1:14:16] we have to love one another as the days
[1:14:19] approach more than anything
[1:14:22] because Jesus Says by this
[1:14:26] all men all men may know you are my
[1:14:30] disciple
[1:14:32] because
[1:14:34] if we love one another
[1:14:37] the pastor job become what easy
[1:14:41] do know that
[1:14:45] done there's no competition
[1:14:48] There Is No Lack
[1:14:51] because
[1:14:53] if I'm seeing
[1:14:56] the pastor
[1:14:58] is
[1:14:59] maybe sick and I'm close I'm just using
[1:15:02] as example I'm not saying any past I say
[1:15:07] I'll go
[1:15:08] give him a call and say Pastor can I
[1:15:13] I see you for a long time can I do
[1:15:15] something for you what do you want me to
[1:15:17] do what do you want me to
[1:15:20] do
[1:15:22] oh brother
[1:15:24] I'm so sick I can't come to church so
[1:15:27] tell the brothers for me
[1:15:29] you come to church
[1:15:31] you see the whole floor dirty
[1:15:34] nobody have to tell you oh I'm not
[1:15:36] cleaning it what kind of spirit is upon
[1:15:39] you
[1:15:40] is that the Holy Spirit
[1:15:45] you do it put your sincere heart
[1:15:51] because you know what
[1:15:52] you're not doing it for man
[1:15:56] are you doing it for popularity
[1:16:00] popularity will get you nowhere
[1:16:04] let me tell you me popularity I don't
[1:16:06] want even what did I have
[1:16:09] I always said it naturally speaking and
[1:16:12] I will speak
[1:16:13] a little dummy what are you gonna I can
[1:16:16] offer you do tell me in the world
[1:16:19] nothing I can offer you
[1:16:22] the only thing that I the Lord by his
[1:16:25] grace
[1:16:27] I'm standing here by Jesus Christ Grace
[1:16:31] not a man
[1:16:34] because I know what he has done for me
[1:16:38] so I'm doing it with gratitude
[1:16:41] towards him
[1:16:43] all I want from him is when I go there
[1:16:46] he will say die good and faithful
[1:16:49] servant
[1:16:51] that word that saving God my brother
[1:16:55] Stephen dead that's all I require
[1:16:58] brother
[1:16:59] this bullheaded required that from the
[1:17:03] Lord if you don't know you don't want
[1:17:05] that
[1:17:06] I want that that is my degree I want it
[1:17:11] from the Lord so I pour my heart so that
[1:17:15] when I read that that will be my degree
[1:17:19] okay
[1:17:21] oh yes
[1:17:22] that will be my degree
[1:17:25] because nothing I came here with
[1:17:28] nothing you came here with who born
[1:17:31] naked you go naked Abigail was telling
[1:17:35] me at the hospital
[1:17:37] they said one girl when he's going
[1:17:40] he is coming
[1:17:42] like he go and release her
[1:17:45] and not knowing he had cancer he's so
[1:17:49] sick
[1:17:50] and
[1:17:52] the cancer they treat her a gun he
[1:17:55] finished University
[1:17:57] the cancer came back
[1:18:00] the doctors told her they can't do
[1:18:02] nothing for her
[1:18:04] you know she told them
[1:18:07] inject me let me die
[1:18:10] he took injection and died
[1:18:15] have you seen
[1:18:19] he is gone
[1:18:21] but God allowed you to see
[1:18:24] because you're young kids you think you
[1:18:26] have a long time you don't
[1:18:31] it's the grace of God keeping you
[1:18:36] if not the grace of God sometimes you
[1:18:39] see
[1:18:40] a young guy and 90 years man is still
[1:18:44] alive 90 years old woman still alive and
[1:18:47] the young died baby died
[1:18:49] so you don't know when you'll be caught
[1:18:53] to stand in front of your master
[1:18:57] so allowed him to do what he wanted to
[1:19:01] do with you now
[1:19:04] now is your time
[1:19:07] now
[1:19:08] is God calling you
[1:19:11] now God wants you to worship him now God

[1:20:09] nothing is sharp God gave us more
[1:20:12] abundance

[1:20:19] I know God has done it for me
[1:20:23] one time there was no food in my cave my

[1:23:01] God is trying you
[1:23:04] that I know I've got been there where

[1:23:11] let me tell you for me I don't talk by
[1:23:13] lips
[1:23:14] I have seen God In Action in my life
[1:23:18] one thing I know I may not quote brother
[1:23:21] Brown there is that that that but I have
[1:23:24] put the tape that I listened to
[1:23:28] that little bit that I can he has given
[1:23:30] me to read
[1:23:31] I have seen him in action in my life
[1:23:38] and I'm telling you from my heart
[1:23:46] my wife
[1:23:48] begin to believe
[1:23:51] that only God can do it
[1:23:54] sometime even our car I have to speak
[1:23:58] before the car come no money
[1:24:01] not even one cent in our pocket
[1:24:06] I'm not talking I have maybe thousand
[1:24:09] there or 500 there
[1:24:11] not even at one cent
[1:24:15] but I'm speaking
[1:24:17] my kids are laughing at me
[1:24:20] Oh Daddy you dream too much I said let
[1:24:23] me tell you I believe God the god of
[1:24:26] brought Abraham I believe in
[1:24:29] and he come on the scene
[1:24:32] then as they give me the car
[1:24:35] I have seen him
[1:24:39] going to places
[1:24:42] where people challenge me
[1:24:44] my my
[1:24:47] and on back on the wall like this
[1:24:50] and I say Lord you know me I'm
[1:24:52] completely literate but I believe you
[1:24:56] you have brought me so mad things that
[1:24:59] Lord I want my brothers and sisters to
[1:25:03] see
[1:25:04] God in a scheme
[1:25:07] that's what I believe
[1:25:09] I don't want God in the book for
[1:25:11] God in the book formed us that one even
[1:25:14] all the churches know God in the book
[1:25:17] form
[1:25:18] but God in reality
[1:25:21] God in action
[1:25:24] the god of brother Abraham is always in
[1:25:27] what I see
[1:25:30] that's what attracts the people
[1:25:35] and if we surrender God will be in
[1:25:38] action
[1:25:41] God
[1:25:43] some of you sitting you don't know the
[1:25:45] gifts that is hidden in you
[1:25:49] some of us sitting here you don't know
[1:25:52] the gifts that God has placed in you
[1:25:56] until you fully surrender
[1:25:59] when you surrender you come on the scene
[1:26:03] do what you even don't think
[1:26:11] I never see I always say this uh we are
[1:26:14] all here I never see Pastor someone
[1:26:16] interpret my language
[1:26:19] but in Ghana I saw it
[1:26:23] and the time
[1:26:25] the brother that was asking even saw it
[1:26:30] all of a sudden he broke on song on him
[1:26:35] in my language
[1:26:38] let me tell you when the Holy Spirit is
[1:26:41] singing through somebody is different
[1:26:43] than you get up yes as you wanna sing
[1:26:46] and the Holy Spirit is not told you to
[1:26:49] sing
[1:26:50] when Holy Spirit tell you sing it
[1:26:54] is different
[1:27:00] those that one know God gonna see this
[1:27:04] as God imagine
[1:27:06] the god of brother Abraham gonna shake
[1:27:09] us you want to let us know him because
[1:27:12] he has trained us
[1:27:15] the pillow fire came to this church
[1:27:18] because the man that God chose to preach
[1:27:22] this gospel
[1:27:24] was ordained
[1:27:26] before the foundations of this world
[1:27:28] when a man is ordained
[1:27:31] God showed a pill of Fire
[1:27:37] otherwise
[1:27:39] do that man shut up
[1:27:42] quiet
[1:27:44] because God does not lie
[1:27:47] he doesn't fool around
[1:27:51] God is playing View
[1:27:55] anybody can talk
[1:27:57] but when God talk
[1:28:00] is different
[1:28:02] when God speak is different when brother
[1:28:06] Abraham was here and the angel of the
[1:28:09] Lord was standing beside him he says
[1:28:13] listening I can not speak all your your
[1:28:18] knowledge and things but God told me
[1:28:22] I will do this I'll do this I'll preach
[1:28:25] this that that and you is in the table
[1:28:27] in the book you go listen but what I
[1:28:29] have preached the serpent seed
[1:28:32] one God
[1:28:35] baptizing Jesus name
[1:28:38] woman shouldn't put up this man should
[1:28:41] do this that on my Doctrine you call me
[1:28:44] here in Chicago to question me
[1:28:46] if I have said lie let one of you come
[1:28:50] here and challenge
[1:28:51] who who dead can come out
[1:28:56] because why God has sent a man
[1:29:00] nor a man talking
[1:29:04] when a man is talking is different
[1:29:07] and when God is speaking is different
[1:29:10] our pasta
[1:29:15] pillow fight
[1:29:17] the eagle came on Rosedale
[1:29:21] on the church
[1:29:22] some of us we were there when it came
[1:29:26] on the signboard supernatural use
[1:29:28] everybody's could see the brother that
[1:29:31] took even he you could see him he was
[1:29:33] like this
[1:29:35] after he took not too long he gone
[1:29:38] but God prove it
[1:29:40] I am with him
[1:29:44] this church is not a regular Church
[1:29:47] anybody can call themselves message
[1:29:49] action
[1:29:51] and get people with their knowledge and
[1:29:53] gather at them because of psychology or
[1:29:56] things I will leave you in a few minutes
[1:29:59] but let me tell you when God has chosen
[1:30:03] servant
[1:30:05] okay
[1:30:07] he has chosen
[1:30:10] those that have I can see
[1:30:13] those who have no eye cannot see
[1:30:16] but we who
[1:30:18] are they not by man
[1:30:22] let me tell you me I'm I don't get here
[1:30:25] because I want to preach
[1:30:27] I don't get here because I have even
[1:30:29] knowledge
[1:30:32] it was God that told me or he says you
[1:30:35] I'll never let you read our right
[1:30:41] the day God showed to brother Peter is
[1:30:44] calling me to Pope or the Peter cry like
[1:30:47] a baby
[1:30:51] he cried like a baby he took the Bible
[1:30:54] at his brother
[1:30:56] they are going to hear him
[1:30:58] and he was crying said brother if you
[1:31:02] have told me this is on you I will never
[1:31:06] believe you
[1:31:09] and he says people should watch out
[1:31:12] God hiding in
[1:31:14] Simplicity reveal himself in simplicity
[1:31:23] because
[1:31:24] me I don't know
[1:31:27] why God will even choose me
[1:31:29] to come here
[1:31:32] he told me he says I'm bringing you here
[1:31:37] and he says when I put it here speak
[1:31:39] your mind
[1:31:40] whatever I put in you don't be looking
[1:31:43] at people
[1:31:45] look to me I am God I have told you I
[1:31:49] have called you
[1:31:51] anybody challenge it I will come and
[1:31:53] show that it is me the Lord
[1:31:56] because
[1:31:58] you you don't know but I the Lord God no
[1:32:02] offense
[1:32:04] I chose you you didn't choose yourself
[1:32:12] don't even introduce yourself
[1:32:14] so therefore
[1:32:16] fear not human beings
[1:32:20] I know your heart
[1:32:23] every one of you sitting here God knows
[1:32:26] your heart
[1:32:28] God knows me if I'm saying things for
[1:32:31] popularity if I'm saying things to
[1:32:34] puffed off if I'm saying things to put
[1:32:36] some people down may the Lord forgive me
[1:32:39] and forgive you but let me tell you
[1:32:42] that's the last thing I'll ever do
[1:32:45] so Pastor Simon
[1:32:48] has brought his heart
[1:32:50] but the battle the Baton is Gonna Change
[1:32:55] to our precious brother

[1:33:38] God gonna deal with him and pull it out
[1:33:43] and get him to the place he wants
[1:33:46] and let him go
[1:33:48] that is not what he thinks
[1:33:51] but it is what I the Lord thy God think
[1:33:57] because I send him for the job for you
[1:34:03] he's the one
[1:34:06] that I chosen to carry the battle
[1:34:09] I chose him
