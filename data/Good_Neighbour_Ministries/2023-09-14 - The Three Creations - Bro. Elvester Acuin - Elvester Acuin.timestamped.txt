[27:19] uh in this area I I believe that we are
[27:24] The Same Spirit
[27:27] and uh
[27:28] my my work and ministry as Pastor Edison
[27:33] has uh
[27:35] mentioned a while ago my job is
[27:39] to
[27:40] church planting that's I love church
[27:43] planting
[27:45] I go to to the places in my country
[27:49] and I I would stay for a month or three
[27:52] months
[27:54] just to start a work in an area where
[27:57] there is no church
[27:59] and by the help of the Lord and by his
[28:03] uh
[28:04] Holy Spirit
[28:06] God has
[28:07] enabled us to start a church out of
[28:11] nothing
[28:12] so we have
[28:14] the privilege to do that around the
[28:18] country
[28:18] in the Philippines and I would like to
[28:22] I am 57 years old now I started when I
[28:25] was 17 years old
[28:27] preaching the gospel and I heard Pastor
[28:29] also started at the young age
[28:31] and I intend to preach the gospel
[28:35] till Jesus comes or till
[28:38] my last breath if you know I love seeing
[28:42] people
[28:43] get saved
[28:45] I love seeing people get get a life
[28:49] change
[28:50] that's that's my uh
[28:54] desire
[28:55] that's why I I don't want to stop
[28:58] preaching the gospel so uh in some of my
[29:03] experience of opening a church I have to
[29:07] sleep
[29:08] I have to stay in the mountain and
[29:12] where the tribes are the Headhunters
[29:17] they they are fighting each other and
[29:20] I have to stay at One Tribe
[29:24] and they are at War at another tribe but
[29:28] I have I have I have access in that
[29:31] mountain because of the family that was
[29:33] converted in my church
[29:37] and I began to preach to the
[29:40] drives to the tribal men and I was able
[29:44] to baptize 21 Headhunters
[29:48] in Mountain Province so to God be
[29:50] praised to them
[29:54] and we have a church now there now
[29:58] God gave us a church from that area so
[30:03] all glory and praise belongs to Jesus
[30:06] Christ

[30:12] time but actually in my church when they
[30:15] give me the pulpit at 10.

[32:37] please be seated
[32:45] my message
[32:46] tonight
[32:49] is entitled
[32:52] the three
[32:54] creations
[33:02] I would like to read again
[33:06] Proverbs chapter 8
[33:09] verse 22
[33:11] to 30 where it says
[33:14] the Lord possessed me
[33:18] in the beginning
[33:20] of his way
[33:23] before his works of old
[33:28] I was set up from Everlasting
[33:33] from the beginning
[33:35] or ever
[33:37] the Earth was
[33:41] when there were no depths
[33:43] I was brought forth
[33:47] when there were no fountains abounding
[33:50] with water
[33:53] before the mountains were settled
[33:57] before the hills was I brought forth
[34:04] while as yet he had not made the Earth
[34:07] nor the fields
[34:10] nor the highest part of the Dust of the
[34:13] world
[34:15] when he prepared the heavens I was there
[34:21] when he set a compass upon the face of
[34:26] the depth
[34:28] when he established the clouds above
[34:32] when he strengthened The Fountains of
[34:35] the deep
[34:37] when he gave to the Sea his decree that
[34:41] the water should not pass
[34:43] his Commandments
[34:47] when he appointed the foundations of the
[34:51] Earth
[34:52] then I was by him
[34:56] as one brought up with him
[35:00] and I was daily his Delight
[35:04] rejoicing always
[35:06] before him
[35:09] may God bless his word
[35:14] what was the first creation of God
[35:21] I would like to read from the message of
[35:24] the prophet
[35:26] in the question and answers 1953
[35:30] he said in paragraph 22
[35:35] he was in other words
[35:39] Adam
[35:40] the first man in the lower
[35:44] creations of God
[35:50] the first creation
[35:53] was God himself
[36:00] then out of God
[36:03] came the logos
[36:06] which was
[36:07] the son of God
[36:11] then out of the logos
[36:15] which was the word
[36:18] in the beginning was the word
[36:21] and the Word was with God
[36:25] and the Word was God
[36:29] and the Word was made flesh
[36:32] and dwelt Among Us
[36:35] out of the logos
[36:38] came forth the man
[36:45] in another quote entitled preparation
[36:49] 1953 the prophet of God said in
[36:52] paragraph 23
[36:54] let's take
[36:56] and take a little mental trip tonight
[37:00] you and I
[37:03] and let's go back
[37:06] before there was a star in the heaven
[37:11] before there was
[37:14] there even was not anything
[37:18] setting way back in
[37:21] eternity
[37:22] that was God
[37:26] then going out of God
[37:30] or God
[37:33] unfolding himself
[37:36] come the logos
[37:39] which was the son of God or the word of
[37:44] God
[37:45] in the beginning was the word
[37:48] and the Word was with God and the Word
[37:51] was God
[37:54] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[37:58] Among Us
[37:59] the logos
[38:07] the prophet of God said
[38:10] that the first creation was God himself
[38:15] manifesting
[38:18] the logos
[38:20] which the prophet of God said
[38:23] he also called theophany
[38:25] a visible form of God that can appear
[38:31] and disappear
[38:33] from the spirit of God
[38:37] amen
[38:39] that's
[38:40] the first creation before he created the
[38:44] heavens and the Earth
[38:46] before he created the angels and man
[38:50] God was the first creation
[38:54] manifesting unfolding
[38:58] himself into a visible form called the
[39:02] logos or theophany
[39:04] so God we praise to God be the glory
[39:06] amen
[39:09] that's why in Revelation 3 14 our Lord
[39:12] Jesus Christ
[39:14] was called
[39:16] Das and unto the angel of the Church of
[39:21] laodiceans right
[39:23] this thing say it the amen
[39:27] the faithful and true Witness
[39:31] the beginning of the creation of God
[39:44] when did God gave himself birth to his
[39:48] son or to his logos
[39:52] many preachers teach that
[39:55] the son was born in the manger
[40:00] but what did the prophet of God said
[40:03] when was the son
[40:06] when did God himself gave birth to the
[40:10] son
[40:11] in the message entitled
[40:16] it's a question and answer 1953
[40:21] in paragraph 21.
[40:24] prophet of God said now if God created
[40:28] man
[40:30] in his own image
[40:33] and in his own likeness
[40:36] what kind of a man did he create
[40:41] a spirit man
[40:43] now if you'll notice after he had made
[40:47] all decorations
[40:50] and created the spirit man
[40:53] the close reading of this now to the one
[40:57] that asked the question will find this
[41:00] that God gave Dominion of the cattle and
[41:05] the fishes and everything to the man
[41:08] but in his making up there he made man
[41:12] in his own image to lead the cattle
[41:17] lead the Beast of the field just like
[41:20] the Holy Spirit
[41:22] leads the Believers today
[41:27] sons and others of God are led by the
[41:31] spirit of God
[41:34] and the spirit of God will lead us
[41:36] always to the world
[41:39] to the spoken word and to the written
[41:43] word
[41:44] there is no other living outside of this
[41:49] brothers and sisters amen there is no
[41:52] other leading
[41:54] leading out of the spoken word in the
[41:57] written word
[42:00] because the prophet of God said the Holy
[42:03] Spirit feeds on the word
[42:08] he feeds on the word
[42:12] amen
[42:17] he was in other words Adam the first man
[42:20] in the lower creations of God
[42:24] the first creation was God himself
[42:29] then out of God came the logos
[42:33] which was the son of God then out of the
[42:37] logos which was the word
[42:39] in the beginning was the word and the
[42:43] Word was with God and the Word was God
[42:47] and the Word was made flesh
[42:51] and dwelt Among Us
[42:53] out of the logos came forth the man
[43:03] let's go back a hundred million years
[43:06] before there ever was a star moon or
[43:09] anything in the world
[43:12] now there was a time when there was not
[43:15] nothing there nothing here it was just
[43:18] all forever an eternity
[43:22] and all of ever and Eternity was God
[43:27] he was there
[43:29] in the beginning
[43:31] now let's go out here on the edge of
[43:34] this banister and look over and see
[43:37] these things happen
[43:39] no man had seen the father at any time
[43:42] no man can see God in the bodily form
[43:46] because God is not in body form
[43:52] God is a spirit
[43:55] no man had seen the father but the only
[44:00] begotten
[44:02] of the father had declared him
[44:09] notice now there's nothing there's just
[44:11] space there's no light there's no dark
[44:15] there's no nothing seems nothing but in
[44:18] there it is a great supernatural being
[44:21] Jehovah God
[44:23] who covered all space in all places at
[44:27] all times he was from Everlasting from
[44:32] Everlasting he is the beginning of
[44:36] creation that's God
[44:38] can't see nothing can't hear nothing not
[44:42] a move of an atom in the air nor nothing
[44:45] no air no nothing but yet God was there
[44:49] there that was God
[44:54] now notice then after a while I'll begin
[44:57] to see a little sacred light begin to
[45:01] form
[45:02] like a little Halo
[45:05] or something you could only see it by
[45:08] spiritual eyes
[45:10] what is that I the eye of Revelation
[45:14] we cannot use these two eyes anymore
[45:16] right now what we need to use is the eye
[45:20] of understanding which is the eye of
[45:22] Revelation
[45:26] no one has seen God and then the next
[45:30] thing to begin to see by the eyes of
[45:33] Supernatural looking
[45:34] we see a little white light forming out
[45:38] there what is that that was called by
[45:41] Bible readers logos
[45:44] or the anointed
[45:47] or the anointing
[45:50] as I was going to say the part of God
[45:54] began to develop in to something so
[45:58] human beings could have some type of an
[46:02] idea what it was
[46:04] that little light moving that was the
[46:08] word of God
[46:10] paragraph 31.
[46:12] now God
[46:15] gave himself vert
[46:19] to this son
[46:21] which was before there was even an atom
[46:25] or heir to make an atom
[46:29] Jesus said glorify me father with the
[46:32] glory
[46:34] that we had before the foundation of the
[46:36] world see way back in Yonder
[46:39] that Saint John 1 1 in the beginning was
[46:43] the word
[46:44] and the Word was with God and the Word
[46:47] was God
[46:50] and the Word was made less and dwelt
[46:54] Among Us
[46:55] God
[46:57] unfolding himself down to a human being
[47:02] blessed be the name of the Lord amen
[47:06] amen thank you Jesus
[47:09] Hallelujah
[47:11] now back there when this little Halo
[47:14] comes
[47:15] but just by Ice you can see nothing yet
[47:19] just Supernatural we see a Halo standing
[47:23] there that's the Son of God the logos
[47:27] and I can see him playing around like a
[47:29] little child
[47:31] before the father's door with all
[47:33] eternity
[47:34] and now then in his imaginary makeup he
[47:39] begin to think of what things would be
[47:41] and I can hear him say let there be
[47:44] light
[47:46] and when he did and I come bursted and
[47:49] the sun came into existence
[47:52] she willed for hundreds of millions of
[47:55] years forming clinkers burning
[47:58] forming like it is today still burning
[48:01] still breaking atoms
[48:03] if the atomic bomb would ever get let
[48:07] loose the atomic chain would take this
[48:10] Earth would be like the sun Yonder just
[48:13] bursting and blowing
[48:18] if you could stand over on another
[48:20] continent and look off at this it would
[48:23] look like another Sun
[48:25] where the atoms was burning this Earth
[48:28] if the chain would ever get let loose
[48:31] and he'd just start turning whirling
[48:33] like that millions and millions of miles
[48:36] reached these big flames of billions of
[48:39] Fahrenheit of heat that goes up that sun
[48:43] now watch this now beautiful he made the
[48:46] Sun
[48:48] and then the first thing you know a big
[48:50] clinker fellow
[48:52] way about like this Earth went spew then
[48:57] this logos here now the Son of God is
[49:00] watching it
[49:01] he lets it fall for a hundred million
[49:04] years and stop it
[49:07] then another one flies up and he let it
[49:10] flow up
[49:11] fall for millions of years then he stops
[49:14] it
[49:15] and we're standing watching it come into
[49:20] this existence
[49:24] he's got something in his mind what he's
[49:27] doing
[49:28] he is writing his first Bible
[49:33] the first Bible that man ever looked to
[49:37] was the Stars the zodiac
[49:41] it's perfect
[49:42] it dovetailed with this Bible here
[49:46] it starts up the first of the zodiac is
[49:49] the Virgin is that right the loss of the
[49:52] zodiac is what Leo the Lion
[49:56] that's first coming of Jesus
[49:59] came through a virgin the second he came
[50:02] as the lion of the tribe of Judah see
[50:06] drawed it all out the cancer AIDS and
[50:09] everything down through
[50:11] he put that all in the sky and place it
[50:15] out
[50:16] all these meteors pieces of earth or sun
[50:19] hanging
[50:21] off there
[50:24] amen blessed be the name of the Lord
[50:31] will God be the glory
[50:35] that's what the prophet of God said
[50:37] brother he says Jesus
[50:39] before he created the world before he
[50:41] created the heavens and the Earth
[50:44] God had to unfold himself into logos
[50:48] form
[50:50] that's the answer to the mystery of
[50:54] Genesis 1 26 let us make man
[50:58] the Oneness
[51:03] they thought the word us refers to
[51:06] Angels
[51:08] the trinitarians
[51:10] they were confused
[51:12] they thought
[51:14] that the US refers to three persons
[51:20] but the prophet of God whether he was
[51:23] not confused
[51:25] it was revealed to him what is the
[51:28] meaning of the word our in US it refers
[51:31] to the logos
[51:33] the visible form of God
[51:36] and the image of God refers to the
[51:39] spirit the invisible
[51:42] form of God
[51:45] amen everyone say praise the Lord
[51:48] God be praised to God be the glory amen
[51:53] Blessed Be His holy name
[51:55] in the plan of creation
[51:59] the logos was included the visible form
[52:03] that's why we human beings
[52:06] brother Branham said we are made in the
[52:08] spirit because God is the spirit but we
[52:11] have the visible form
[52:13] the likeness of God the likeness of the
[52:16] logos
[52:17] amen
[52:20] thanks be to God if we can
[52:22] receive the same revelation
[52:25] amen this Revelation was missed by the
[52:28] trinitarians this Revelation was missed
[52:31] by the Oneness
[52:34] but God showed it to his prophet and the
[52:37] prophet of God showed it to the Bride of
[52:39] Jesus Christ
[52:41] amen hallelujah what a blessed people we
[52:45] are
[52:47] to be part of the body of Christ
[52:50] amen
[52:52] Hallelujah
[52:54] in another quotation that I would like
[52:56] to read
[53:00] prophet of God in the five definite
[53:02] identification of the True Church of the
[53:04] Living God 1960.
[53:07] he said
[53:12] the beginning of the creation of God
[53:16] that is who the Lord Jesus says he is
[53:21] but those words don't mean exactly as
[53:25] they sound to us
[53:27] just taking them the way they sound has
[53:31] made some people in fact multitudes of
[53:34] people
[53:36] get the idea that Jesus was the first
[53:40] creation of God
[53:43] making him lower
[53:45] than the godhead
[53:48] then this first creation created all the
[53:51] rest of the universe
[53:53] and whatsoever it contains but that is
[53:56] not right
[53:57] so let us be careful there brothers and
[53:59] sisters that's why in this message there
[54:02] are those who preach two Lords
[54:06] they are also misled
[54:08] they are also confused
[54:10] of this manifestation of God in logos
[54:13] form
[54:16] amen
[54:17] I don't believe in two Lords
[54:19] or to God's Brothers
[54:22] but I'm I'm surprised why some preachers
[54:25] are getting into that
[54:28] Doctrine you know
[54:30] if you just
[54:33] remain faithful to the written and the
[54:35] spoken word and you just listen to the
[54:38] Holy Spirit you will never go wrong
[54:41] because Sons and Daughters of God are
[54:45] led by the spirit of God
[54:49] you can never be wrong you can never go
[54:52] to the left or to the right
[54:56] because the holy spirit is anchored not
[54:59] in the five senses of your spirit which
[55:02] can be deceived
[55:04] the holy spirit is anchored deep down
[55:07] into your soul
[55:10] where genuine faith revelation
[55:15] takes hold brothers and sisters
[55:21] that's what the prophet of God said
[55:23] that's what I believe
[55:25] Brothers
[55:27] in this message
[55:29] I don't want to believe or to teach
[55:32] anything outside of the spoken word and
[55:35] the written word
[55:36] the spoken word and the written word has
[55:39] dovetailed together
[55:41] by the holy spirit so that his people
[55:44] and his children
[55:47] could be fed with pure manner
[55:53] from the Holy Spirit
[55:57] and he said to us so be careful the
[56:00] prophet of God said
[56:01] it's not what the two Lords think that
[56:04] God created this second person Jesus
[56:07] Christ and then this
[56:09] Jesus Christ created the rest of the
[56:12] universe that's not what the prophet of
[56:14] God said
[56:18] let us continue
[56:24] you know that doesn't line up with the
[56:26] rest of the Bible
[56:28] the words are
[56:30] he is the beginner
[56:34] or author of the creation of God
[56:41] now we know for a surety that Jesus is
[56:45] God fearing God
[56:48] he is the creator John 1 3. all things
[56:53] were made by him
[56:56] and without him was not anything made
[57:00] that was made
[57:02] he is the one of whom it is said Genesis
[57:07] 1 1. in the beginning God created the
[57:12] Heaven and the Earth
[57:13] also it says in Exodus 20 11
[57:17] for in six days the Lord made Heaven and
[57:20] Earth the sea and all that in them is
[57:23] and rested the seventh day see there is
[57:27] no doubt
[57:28] that he is the creator
[57:31] he was the creator of a finished
[57:36] physical creation
[57:40] surely we can see what these words mean
[57:44] now
[57:46] to have any other interpretation
[57:49] would mean that God created God
[57:54] how could God be created when he himself
[57:57] is the creator
[57:59] so this quotation is
[58:03] a warning to the two two Lords believers
[58:07] but they don't see it
[58:10] see only the prophet
[58:13] and the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ
[58:16] can see this
[58:17] revelation
[58:20] so
[58:22] after this logos
[58:25] after this the opening the prophet of
[58:27] God called this logos the opening
[58:30] that could appear and disappear from the
[58:34] Fountain of eternal spirit
[58:38] the prophet of God also used the word in
[58:41] morphing God who changed his mask
[58:46] amen
[58:48] and if you read from Genesis to
[58:50] revelation
[58:52] God and morphe was manifested in many
[58:57] ways from the Old Testament
[59:00] and the New Testament
[59:03] amen
[59:07] the first thing he created
[59:11] in Genesis story
[59:13] I want you to know about my Genesis
[59:15] story let us make man the first thing he
[59:17] created was angels to worship Him became
[59:19] God and he said let us make money our
[59:22] image what kind of man he make spirit
[59:25] man
[59:27] he made the man to give him control then
[59:30] he made Man Out of the Dust of the earth
[59:32] then he fell he became
[59:35] he become a savior a God then a savior
[59:39] sin brought on sickness then he become a
[59:42] Healer
[59:45] so we notice here from the message of
[59:48] the prophet
[59:49] that is the
[59:52] first
[59:53] thing
[59:55] the first creation was God himself
[59:57] manifesting in logos and the opening
[1:00:00] form then out of that logos
[1:00:02] he begins to create the heavens and the
[1:00:06] Earth
[1:00:07] angels and the man and the man was the
[1:00:10] last thing he created
[1:00:12] prophet of God said amen you believe
[1:00:14] that brothers and sisters
[1:00:20] now the prophet of God quoted Genesis 1
[1:00:23] 1 and 2. he said
[1:00:25] in the beginning God created the Heaven
[1:00:28] and the Earth
[1:00:29] and the Earth was without form and void
[1:00:32] and darkness was upon the face of the
[1:00:34] deep
[1:00:35] and the spirit of God move upon the face
[1:00:38] of the waters
[1:00:40] now the prophet of God explained this
[1:00:42] that there is a space of time between
[1:00:44] Genesis 1 1
[1:00:46] and Genesis 1 2.
[1:00:50] you believe that Saints the prophet of
[1:00:52] God said that
[1:00:53] someone was speaking the other day to me
[1:00:56] he said Genesis is wrong
[1:00:59] and the six days of creation that he
[1:01:01] said
[1:01:01] I said Genesis 1 to Genesis 2 is
[1:01:04] absolutely a different thing
[1:01:08] the first chapter of Genesis says in the
[1:01:10] beginning God created the heavens and
[1:01:14] the Earth period
[1:01:16] how he did it and when he did it that's
[1:01:20] up to him
[1:01:22] yes
[1:01:23] then in verse 2 the world was without
[1:01:27] form and void
[1:01:30] then we start off from there for the
[1:01:33] creation but in the beginning
[1:01:36] how far we don't know
[1:01:38] all those seeds that he had in there
[1:01:41] when the waters went off
[1:01:44] life come back on the Earth again
[1:01:47] refurnish the Earth
[1:01:49] and when God's word is sowed there is
[1:01:53] nothing can keep it from happening
[1:01:56] the way of a prophet 1963.
[1:02:01] to God we praise to God be the glory
[1:02:06] Genesis 1 he said in the beginning God
[1:02:08] created the heavens and the Earth period
[1:02:10] how long he done it I don't know nobody
[1:02:13] else does
[1:02:14] God did that that's period that's the
[1:02:17] end of the sentence and
[1:02:20] when he began to use it
[1:02:22] the world without form and void and
[1:02:25] water was upon the dip and the spirit of
[1:02:28] God move upon the Water but in Genesis 1
[1:02:31] said God created the heavens and the
[1:02:34] Earth in the beginning that's all don't
[1:02:37] fast about it
[1:02:38] just believe it
[1:02:41] God created it it's not my business to
[1:02:43] know I'm glad he did it and let me live
[1:02:46] here for a while
[1:02:49] he's got a new one wherein dwelleth
[1:02:51] righteousness
[1:02:53] influence 1963.
[1:02:59] the first chapter of Genesis said in the
[1:03:02] beginning God created the heavens and
[1:03:04] the Earth period how long he was doing
[1:03:06] it I don't know he did not tell us but
[1:03:08] in the beginning God created the heavens
[1:03:11] and the Earth
[1:03:13] perion and the world was out of form
[1:03:16] that's when God started to use it
[1:03:21] see the difference Church
[1:03:23] Genesis 1 1 and Genesis 1 2
[1:03:26] God made the world
[1:03:29] he might have been a hundred trillion
[1:03:32] years making it I don't know how long he
[1:03:34] was but he made it
[1:03:37] he did not say how long he was it's none
[1:03:39] of our business how long it was he just
[1:03:41] said in the beginning God created the
[1:03:44] average in their period that settle said
[1:03:46] that's all of it
[1:03:49] how long he was doing it
[1:03:51] that's not but when the creation begin
[1:03:54] to spring up now in the other time when
[1:03:57] he began
[1:03:59] and I believe that in there
[1:04:02] that everything on Earth reflects heaven
[1:04:05] I believe that because that you see
[1:04:08] everything struggling for life is
[1:04:10] because that there is a life that it's
[1:04:13] reflected from
[1:04:15] and I believe that when God made the man
[1:04:18] he started reflecting the smaller things
[1:04:22] such as animal life
[1:04:24] and then the next thing he created was
[1:04:26] something different
[1:04:27] that's exactly the way the Bible says he
[1:04:30] did it he made first the trees and the
[1:04:33] botany life he made man and then the
[1:04:36] last thing that ever come from the earth
[1:04:37] in the form of creation was a man
[1:04:40] nothing higher ever come because why it
[1:04:45] was a perfect reflection of the highest
[1:04:48] in heaven which which God is a man
[1:05:00] see
[1:05:02] a man
[1:05:04] so it shows that the Perfection of
[1:05:07] evolution was God which is a man
[1:05:12] countdown 1962.
[1:05:17] and man is the lower creation according
[1:05:20] to the prophet of God and according to
[1:05:22] the Holy Bible
[1:05:24] Hebrews 2 6 it says but one in a certain
[1:05:28] place testified saying what is man
[1:05:31] that our mindful of him
[1:05:33] or the son of man that thou visitest him
[1:05:37] thou May destroy him a little lower than
[1:05:40] the Angels thou crownest him with glory
[1:05:43] and honor and did they set him over the
[1:05:46] works of thy hands
[1:05:48] but we see Jesus
[1:05:50] who was made a little lower than the
[1:05:53] angels for the suffering of that
[1:05:56] crown with Glory and Honor that he by
[1:06:01] the grace of God should taste that for
[1:06:04] every man
[1:06:08] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:06:14] and man was made to begin God
[1:06:18] we know that Genesis 1 26
[1:06:21] he had domain over the whole Earth
[1:06:24] and he was made to be an amateur God
[1:06:28] I don't know if that's the correct
[1:06:29] pronunciation
[1:06:31] a mature God and now when he receives
[1:06:34] God
[1:06:35] he becomes a Son of God again
[1:06:39] he was made in the image of God
[1:06:43] God had hands God had faith so therefore
[1:06:47] a man was made like him
[1:06:51] so he is and a mature God
[1:06:54] but sin blinded every fiber in his body
[1:06:57] in his mind in his heart
[1:07:00] but now don't never try to study it out
[1:07:03] you cannot figure it out
[1:07:06] in the Garden of Eden
[1:07:08] Satan choose his part of the man his
[1:07:12] head
[1:07:13] his intellectuals that's why brother
[1:07:16] Branham the prophet of God there is an
[1:07:17] intellectual faith
[1:07:19] there is an intellectual love
[1:07:22] we must not have that what we must have
[1:07:26] is genuine faith what we must have is
[1:07:30] genuine love
[1:07:32] because genuine Faith believes every
[1:07:37] written and spoken word of God
[1:07:40] he doubts nothing
[1:07:42] that's the genuine fate
[1:07:44] but intellectual faith it reasons
[1:07:51] that's why we need genuine love
[1:07:55] because genuine love love the enemy
[1:08:00] we have so many profess professing love
[1:08:03] today
[1:08:05] but the only love
[1:08:08] what is good to them
[1:08:11] and if you can only love the people
[1:08:13] that's good to you and you cannot love
[1:08:15] the unlovable
[1:08:18] your lab is in question
[1:08:21] because genuine love loves The Sinner
[1:08:25] and even the enemy
[1:08:29] amen brothers and sisters
[1:08:31] to God be praised to God be the glory
[1:08:33] amen and I want to have that genuine
[1:08:36] love
[1:08:38] I want to love everybody
[1:08:41] even those who have spoken evil and bad
[1:08:45] things about me
[1:08:47] even if I have known this person
[1:08:50] that behind my back he has spoken
[1:08:55] bad things about me
[1:08:58] I want to be able to shake his hands
[1:09:02] and rajaj the love of God for my heart
[1:09:05] without hypocrisy
[1:09:07] and pray for his soul
[1:09:10] that one day he will get right with God
[1:09:15] I cannot do it
[1:09:16] without the holy spirit is impossible
[1:09:20] it is impossible to love an enemy it is
[1:09:23] impossible to love a man that you know
[1:09:26] behind your back has been telling things
[1:09:28] bad about you
[1:09:31] it is impossible to express a real
[1:09:34] genuine smile to this man or to this
[1:09:36] woman
[1:09:39] the natural way the carnal way you would
[1:09:42] like to smack him in the face
[1:09:44] and maybe
[1:09:46] take a hold of his hair and bang it into
[1:09:49] the the wall That's the kernel
[1:09:54] you know
[1:09:56] but there is nothing impossible with God
[1:10:00] if the holy spirit is shared abroad in
[1:10:03] our hearts
[1:10:05] these things are possible
[1:10:10] amen in a real genuine believer
[1:10:14] has already
[1:10:16] radiates that Divine love and genuine
[1:10:19] love
[1:10:20] in their lives Amen to God be praised to
[1:10:22] God be the glory
[1:10:24] amen
[1:10:26] Hallelujah
[1:10:28] I hope I have not spend so much hours
[1:10:30] now
[1:10:35] say in your body inside of you we got
[1:10:39] another question on that directly to
[1:10:41] answer it better inside of you is a
[1:10:43] spirit
[1:10:45] another man the outside of you is one
[1:10:48] man the inside of you is another man so
[1:10:51] the inside of you is the supernatural
[1:10:54] the outside of you is the physical
[1:10:57] this being if you are Spirit led by God
[1:11:02] you become
[1:11:04] a messenger of God hallelujah or an
[1:11:08] angel
[1:11:10] let me read it again
[1:11:12] if you are a spirit led by God you
[1:11:17] became a messenger of God or an angel
[1:11:22] God's messenger
[1:11:24] God's angel
[1:11:26] is the very same word cannot separate it
[1:11:29] God's messenger
[1:11:32] or God's angel
[1:11:41] which has the greatest Authority an
[1:11:43] angel from heaven or an angel at the
[1:11:46] pulpit which has it
[1:11:49] the prophet of God said the angel at the
[1:11:52] pulpit
[1:11:54] Paul said if an angel from heaven comes
[1:11:57] and preached any other gospel to you
[1:12:00] than this which I've already preached
[1:12:04] let him be a curse
[1:12:07] so the angel Anointed with the Holy
[1:12:11] Spirit and with the word stand next to
[1:12:15] God
[1:12:17] that's right in the heaven
[1:12:20] his authority
[1:12:22] all Praises be to God
[1:12:26] all powers in Heaven and Earth is given
[1:12:29] to my hand go and I'll go with you
[1:12:32] whatever you bind on Earth albine in
[1:12:35] heaven
[1:12:36] what you lose on Earth I loose in heaven
[1:12:41] oh oh if the great holy church only
[1:12:45] realize its power
[1:12:47] to do these things
[1:12:51] but there's so much doubt
[1:12:54] and feel and trembling and wondering if
[1:12:59] it will could it happen
[1:13:02] as long as that exists the church can
[1:13:06] never stand upright
[1:13:10] and when every talk of fear is banished
[1:13:15] and the Holy Spirit is completely in
[1:13:18] control of the church
[1:13:21] and all fears are gone
[1:13:25] and the church has the power
[1:13:28] see
[1:13:30] why they have everything that heaven
[1:13:33] owns behind them
[1:13:36] they are ambassadors of the throne
[1:13:39] absolutely
[1:13:41] an ambassador of Christ has the
[1:13:45] authority and everything that Christ
[1:13:49] holds belongs to that ambassador
[1:13:53] and he said go ye into all the world
[1:13:57] you are my Witnesses
[1:14:00] after the Holy Ghost is come on you
[1:14:04] what is a witness
[1:14:06] is an ambassador
[1:14:10] is to come and witness something
[1:14:15] the whole power of Heaven is right in
[1:14:20] your hands
[1:14:23] oh why do we set
[1:14:25] and the church is barren and we said
[1:14:29] Dorman is because that we don't
[1:14:33] recognize these things
[1:14:39] that should be the name of the Lord
[1:14:43] now the souls that were in prison that
[1:14:45] repented not were not Angelic being that
[1:14:48] had been brought down in the form of
[1:14:50] angels but it was the spirits of those
[1:14:53] small letter
[1:14:55] a Angelic beings that fell
[1:14:58] before the foundation of the world back
[1:15:01] there
[1:15:02] When The War went on in heaven
[1:15:05] and Satan the dragon fought and Michael
[1:15:09] and the dragon dragon fought and Lucifer
[1:15:13] was cast out with all of his children
[1:15:15] all of the angels that he had deceived
[1:15:20] and those angels come to the Earth
[1:15:23] and was subject
[1:15:25] then to become human and when they did
[1:15:28] that's when the sons of God saw the
[1:15:31] daughters of man
[1:15:33] was fair and look unto them wives
[1:15:37] they are sons of God every one that's
[1:15:40] born in this earth is a Son of God
[1:15:42] regardless of whether he's a sinner or
[1:15:44] what he is he's the son of God created
[1:15:47] in the image of God
[1:15:48] for the phrases of God he created that
[1:15:51] way
[1:15:52] but God in the beginning knew who would
[1:15:55] receive him and who would not receive
[1:15:57] him
[1:15:58] therefore he could predestinate or not
[1:16:01] predestinate but by foreknowledge he
[1:16:06] could tell who would be saved and who
[1:16:10] would not be saved for he knew which
[1:16:13] person would take up which spirit
[1:16:18] and those spirits that come from the
[1:16:20] Throne of God and stand before that
[1:16:23] Throne of God and live billions and
[1:16:25] billions and aliens of time
[1:16:28] before the world ever began in the
[1:16:30] presence of God do you think they don't
[1:16:32] know something about worship
[1:16:35] they come down and get right into man
[1:16:38] and they worship God absolutely they
[1:16:42] worship God and they have a knowledge of
[1:16:45] God and their smarts ruled educated
[1:16:48] always but God rejected them from the
[1:16:51] beginning
[1:16:54] so therefore friend membership of a
[1:16:56] church or knowledge of some theology or
[1:16:58] something does not have one thing to do
[1:17:00] with it
[1:17:01] it's got to be the blood
[1:17:04] of Jesus Christ
[1:17:06] and the new birth
[1:17:09] that joins you to him as one person
[1:17:12] there you are
[1:17:19] God in the beginning
[1:17:23] men and women was made one not two they
[1:17:26] were made one they were separated
[1:17:28] one put in flesh one in ethiopathy
[1:17:32] listen to this church
[1:17:34] this is deep
[1:17:35] the prophet of God
[1:17:37] teaches us things
[1:17:39] that are so deep but they are
[1:17:41] understandable by the revelation of God
[1:17:46] the prophet of God said there was one
[1:17:48] put in flesh and one in the opening
[1:17:52] he knew that so sin so in order to prove
[1:17:55] that to you when God made the woman he
[1:17:58] never took some dust and made her like
[1:18:01] he did the man he took a rib out of the
[1:18:03] side of Adam and he became a byproduct
[1:18:07] of a man because he's part of him you
[1:18:10] get it now see there you are
[1:18:14] there are the Angels small letter a and
[1:18:17] God in the spirit that's joined with God
[1:18:19] is one Spirit that's right now the
[1:18:22] spirit of God that dwells in the church
[1:18:27] Christian Church is the spirit that come
[1:18:31] from heaven
[1:18:32] that God knew before the foundation of
[1:18:35] the world that rejected the devil's lie
[1:18:40] my
[1:18:43] and that Spirit had to take a body of
[1:18:45] Flesh to take his testing he had to come
[1:18:49] flesh like this others did and all of
[1:18:52] them put on the equal yoke and God by
[1:18:55] the beginning knew the spirits that
[1:18:58] would
[1:19:00] which would not there you are the devil
[1:19:02] is also wise he's just deceived he just
[1:19:06] received the burial if possible
[1:19:09] so the spirits these angels letter A
[1:19:12] not the capital A that which
[1:19:16] was in prison Angels if you'll notice
[1:19:18] it's a little a which means man Angels
[1:19:22] Messengers here on the earth they sinned
[1:19:25] and the only way that they could sin
[1:19:28] would be disbelief
[1:19:31] and the way they had their own religions
[1:19:34] and they did not believe the message of
[1:19:37] Noah they did not believe the message of
[1:19:40] Enoch and they rejected
[1:19:43] their message and was condemned
[1:19:46] the Bible said they were question and
[1:19:49] answer 1957.
[1:19:57] he was in other words Adam the first man
[1:20:00] in the lower creation of God the first
[1:20:01] creation was God himself then out of God
[1:20:04] came the logos
[1:20:05] which was the son of God then out of the
[1:20:08] logos which was the word in the
[1:20:10] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:20:12] with God and the Word was God and the
[1:20:14] Word was made blessed and dwelt among us
[1:20:16] out of the logos came for the man
[1:20:21] so many people are
[1:20:24] you know that
[1:20:25] tattoo Soul teaching in the Philippines
[1:20:27] and around the world or the soul when a
[1:20:30] man is
[1:20:32] born again they said the old soul is
[1:20:34] annihilated and died and replaced by a
[1:20:37] New Soul from the seventh Dimension from
[1:20:40] the Throne of God
[1:20:41] that's a very popular teaching in this
[1:20:43] world but it's it's false it's lie
[1:20:51] they said that when you are born again
[1:20:53] and received the baptism of the Holy
[1:20:55] Ghost a New Soul from the seventh
[1:20:58] Dimension comes down immediately because
[1:21:00] your old soul was burned and annihilated
[1:21:03] because it was sinner
[1:21:07] but you know the prophet of God said
[1:21:09] brothers and sisters
[1:21:12] where is your day opening
[1:21:15] that is my question tonight where is
[1:21:18] your day opening
[1:21:21] prophet of God said
[1:21:24] your soul
[1:21:25] is your the opening
[1:21:29] you can you cannot Google that you can
[1:21:32] search that in the message
[1:21:34] amen
[1:21:36] you search It soul of man
[1:21:40] is
[1:21:43] but some preachers they kept pointing to
[1:21:45] seven Dimension or some other places in
[1:21:49] heaven
[1:21:50] where you get your theophany
[1:21:58] he got all his creation made let us
[1:22:01] plural make man plural own image now if
[1:22:05] God is unsaid if the logos was in the
[1:22:09] form just mythically speaking drama in
[1:22:12] the form of a Hello then it's
[1:22:14] supernatural see Genesis 1 26
[1:22:20] is a fitness problem to the believer
[1:22:26] it has been made clear by the prophet of
[1:22:29] God how to understand Genesis 1 26.
[1:22:35] the answer is the logos and the opening
[1:22:38] that's the answer to us and the word our
[1:22:41] there prophet of God said
[1:22:43] let us plural make man plural in our
[1:22:46] image let us make man in our image so
[1:22:49] then that God made disperse man he was a
[1:22:52] spirit man he was something on the order
[1:22:54] of God the Son of God the logos
[1:22:58] see
[1:23:00] praise be the name of the Lord
[1:23:04] and now the logos that went out of God
[1:23:08] which was the logos
[1:23:10] all this begin to form a body shape
[1:23:16] and this body shape was called in the
[1:23:19] scholars teaching the logos
[1:23:21] the logos that went out of God
[1:23:25] in other words a better word for it
[1:23:28] was what we call atiopane
[1:23:34] brother say amen for that
[1:23:37] he opened it
[1:23:39] what is the opening
[1:23:41] the opening is a human body that's
[1:23:44] glorified
[1:23:46] not exactly with flesh and blood like it
[1:23:49] will be in its glorified States
[1:23:52] but it is of a form of a human body that
[1:23:56] does not eat neither does it drink
[1:23:59] but it's a body a body that's waiting
[1:24:01] for us soon as we leave this one
[1:24:05] there went into that body and that's the
[1:24:07] kind of body that God was let us make
[1:24:10] man in our image
[1:24:13] and in our body in our likeness
[1:24:17] now when man becomes into that body he
[1:24:20] had control all the fishes and the fowls
[1:24:22] and the beasts of the field there was no
[1:24:24] man to till the soil Genesis 2 he then
[1:24:27] made male and female but there was no
[1:24:29] man to till the soil
[1:24:31] then God made Man Out of the Dust
[1:24:35] of the earth give him like a hand like a
[1:24:38] chimpanzee give him a foot like a bear
[1:24:40] give him made him an image this Earthly
[1:24:43] body is the image of animal life
[1:24:45] and it's made out of same kind of
[1:24:47] material your body is made just the same
[1:24:49] kind of material as a horse or a dog
[1:24:51] anything like that it's made out of
[1:24:53] calcium potash petroleum Cosmic light
[1:24:56] All Flesh like that it's not the same
[1:24:58] place it's different place but it's made
[1:25:00] out of the Dust of the Earth where it
[1:25:03] come from
[1:25:04] but the difference between an animal and
[1:25:07] a man God
[1:25:09] put a soul in the man
[1:25:14] and he did not put it in the animal
[1:25:17] because
[1:25:19] the soul that was in the man is that the
[1:25:26] opening
[1:25:36] God be praised to God be the glory
[1:25:40] where is brothers and sisters
[1:25:43] Hallelujah don't believe any man
[1:25:45] pointing you to so many places where
[1:25:47] your tea opening will come from
[1:25:50] your the opening is inside of this body
[1:25:53] the soul is that the opening and the
[1:25:55] prophet of God said when we die
[1:25:58] this body goes back to the Dust
[1:26:01] and that soul that he opened it will be
[1:26:04] received in a Celestial body
[1:26:07] but the prophet of God said it's a
[1:26:09] temporal body called celestial
[1:26:11] that will last until the Rapture only
[1:26:16] have you read that
[1:26:18] it's temporal and when the Rapture comes
[1:26:21] you leave the celestial form
[1:26:24] your soul my soul which is the opening
[1:26:26] will pick up
[1:26:28] the body that
[1:26:30] rotten and was resurrected that's what
[1:26:33] the prophet of God said
[1:26:37] and glorified body reunited
[1:26:41] brothers and sisters that's the sitting
[1:26:44] of the prophet
[1:26:45] amen
[1:26:46] and I believe you believe the same
[1:26:49] because I don't teach anything outside
[1:26:51] of that
[1:26:53] heaven
[1:26:54] Hallelujah
[1:26:57] so let me repeat it again when we die
[1:26:59] temporarily our the opening will be
[1:27:03] received
[1:27:04] in heaven in a Celestial form the
[1:27:07] prophet of God is temporal
[1:27:10] it's a body that will last until the
[1:27:12] Rapture only
[1:27:15] amen
[1:27:16] and when the Rapture comes you leave
[1:27:19] that Celestial form because your soul
[1:27:21] you're the opening my the opening would
[1:27:23] have to pick up
[1:27:25] this
[1:27:27] will be Resurrected

[1:29:13] came a white little white like Mystic
[1:29:16] light like a Halo and that was the logos
[1:29:20] that went out of God in the beginning
[1:29:22] that was the son of God that came out of
[1:29:24] the bosom of the father
[1:29:28] that was that in the beginning was the
[1:29:30] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:29:32] Word was God and the Word was made flesh
[1:29:34] and dwelt Among Us
[1:29:37] that's what we read in Proverbs 8. that
[1:29:41] Proverbs 8 that was the logos
[1:29:44] talking there
[1:29:45] I was brought forward before he created
[1:29:47] all things
[1:29:51] but to the tunity and Trinity they see
[1:29:53] that
[1:29:54] Proverbs 8 as another verses
[1:29:58] that's the problem brothers and sisters
[1:30:01] amen
[1:30:05] and he said
[1:30:07] that was the son of God that came up on
[1:30:09] the boss of the father what's what what
[1:30:11] was that that was in the beginning was
[1:30:13] the word and the Word was with God and
[1:30:15] the Word was God and the Word was made
[1:30:18] flesh and dwelt Among Us in the
[1:30:19] beginning was God and then out of God
[1:30:22] came the logos as part of God that went
[1:30:25] out of God
[1:30:28] oh Hallelujah
[1:30:30] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:30:35] see
[1:30:38] let me bypass some of this quotation
[1:30:46] so that is the first
[1:30:49] of the three creations of God
[1:30:55] the second creation
[1:30:58] let me just mention it in a short way
[1:31:02] the second creation
[1:31:04] prophet of God said
[1:31:12] what is the second creation
[1:31:15] now the first thing God this was God
[1:31:18] Jesus was God in the form of man
[1:31:22] that's hard for people to swallow
[1:31:25] even today
[1:31:27] he was God
[1:31:28] that's what he was
[1:31:30] he was nothing less than God
[1:31:34] he was God manifested in blessed
[1:31:38] he was the creator in his own creation
[1:31:42] he was the creator in his creation
[1:31:46] by the creation
[1:31:49] for the creation
[1:31:51] he was the creator in his creation by
[1:31:55] his creation for his creation all with
[1:31:59] winds right back in God the whole thing
[1:32:01] did you say fullness of God
[1:32:05] he was the creator in so much that he
[1:32:08] was God
[1:32:09] and he was a being on Earth
[1:32:13] a being of time
[1:32:17] which means that he must have a
[1:32:20] beginning
[1:32:21] therefore he created himself a body to
[1:32:25] live in
[1:32:26] God himself created a body for himself
[1:32:33] see that by discretion he might save the
[1:32:39] Lost creation that he had created
[1:32:45] so the purpose of the second creation
[1:32:48] was to save the Lost creation
[1:32:52] because the first creation was lost
[1:32:58] God had to make another creation and
[1:33:02] this is the opening to human flesh
[1:33:06] this
[1:33:07] is the second creation
[1:33:09] amen
[1:33:12] that should be the name of the Lord
[1:33:16] I give him praise and glory tonight
[1:33:21] and what is the third creation
[1:33:26] a prophet of God said the third creation
[1:33:29] is God will create
[1:33:32] human beings
[1:33:35] not by sex
[1:33:36] but from the dust of the Earth
[1:33:40] making them glorified body
[1:33:45] and including in that third creation he
[1:33:49] said I make new heavens and new earth
[1:33:54] everybody say praise the Lord Brother
[1:33:56] says let's all stand
[1:33:59] I give the let me just close in prayer
[1:34:02] and give the pulpit to our beloved
