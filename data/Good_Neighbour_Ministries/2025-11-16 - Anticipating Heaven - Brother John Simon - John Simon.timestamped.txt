[34:56] The first
[35:01] [music]
[35:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; justified.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; We haven't done it in the first place.
[35:12] Justified. Thanks be to [music] God. God
[35:15] bless you. We're happy to be here today.
[35:18] Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you.
[35:20] Please be seated.
[35:25] What a blessing to be here with you this
[35:28] morning by God's grace. And it means
[35:31] more when you say those words when
[35:34] you're older. It's a blessing to be here
[35:38] just to be in the presence of God's
[35:41] people and the privilege of being able
[35:44] to speak to his bride uh talk to his
[35:48] people and I haven't come with any
[35:52] earthshattering revelations but just to
[35:55] talk with you and let's fellowship
[35:58] around the word of God. Welcome to
[36:00] everyone that's here today and may God's
[36:03] great Holy Spirit minister to us in
[36:07] simplicity, the gospel of the Lord Jesus
[36:10] Christ. Um I'm not uh I shouldn't say
[36:15] that. I was about to say I'm not uh
[36:18] preaching the token, but um I'm I'm
[36:21] trying to apply the token. Um and may
[36:24] the Holy Spirit take the word of God and
[36:26] apply it to your heart. Right. Praise
[36:29] God. I'm speaking the word of God so
[36:31] that it may come to your heart because
[36:34] this is a day where um the revelation
[36:39] has moved from the days of the
[36:41] missionary works of of the feat and it's
[36:44] gone up uh into through Luther Wesley
[36:49] right into Pentecost with the stammering
[36:52] lips and into the prophetic vision of
[36:54] the prophet the eyes of the body. And
[36:58] then now we are in the mind age where
[37:01] the Holy Spirit is moving in the uh in
[37:05] the realm of revelation to your mind to
[37:09] your soul where you can understand what
[37:12] he's trying to speak to you. Amen. So
[37:16] God being a spirit that you know he can
[37:18] speak with an audible voice but that'll
[37:21] more scare you. So he'll speak to you in
[37:23] your thoughts and all of a sudden he'll
[37:26] drop a word. He'll drop a thought and
[37:29] you've seen that. It happened to every
[37:31] one of us.
[37:33] You're just going along and a thought
[37:34] just is why you shouldn't go down that
[37:37] way anymore. Go this way. And we say,
[37:39] "Oh no, I'll just go." And you continue
[37:42] going and you get into trouble and say,
[37:44] "Oh my, I should have listened to my
[37:46] thoughts." But that wasn't your
[37:48] thoughts. That was God's thought.
[37:52] But you just didn't listen at the
[37:54] moment. Amen. So, we should be very, in
[37:58] the words of the prophet, be conscious
[38:01] of God.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; Be aware of his presence.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; Be always aware of him speaking to you.
[38:10] Praise the Lord Jesus. And may the great
[38:13] Holy Spirit of God make us all conscious
[38:16] and aware of his divine presence that
[38:20] he's alive forever more. He'sn't dead.
[38:23] Uh uh you physically maybe his body
[38:25] isn't here, but his spirit is here.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; I believe his presence of the Lord is
[38:31] here. Don't you?
[38:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe he's the same yesterday,
[38:35] today, and forever. Praise the Lord.
[38:38] When the Lord comes on the scene like
[38:40] this, then you know, anything can
[38:44] happen,
[38:45] &gt;&gt; right? I've said it before, say it
[38:47] again. I've been talking just like this
[38:50] and uh next thing you know, a brother in
[38:53] the congregation just coughed up the
[38:55] cancer on the floor, right? What's got
[38:58] to do with me? That doesn't mean I
[39:00] should put a magazine and put it on the
[39:02] internet and all that. And that's
[39:04] happened so many times. The dead has
[39:07] been raised in this church
[39:09] &gt;&gt; more than once.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; And there's no big thing about it
[39:13] because it's the works of Jesus Christ.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; It's not to point to a man or to point
[39:20] to any place. It's to point back to him.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; Get yourself out of the way and let God
[39:27] receive all the praise, the honor, and
[39:29] the glory. He's the same yesterday,
[39:31] today, and forever. You believe that?
[39:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. I was down in South Carolina. I
[39:36] was in the middle of preaching,
[39:37] preaching, preaching and talking like
[39:40] that. And a lady ran up to the front and
[39:43] said, "Oh God, give me my husband. Give
[39:46] me back my husband." Her husband had
[39:48] left her. And oh my, a believer. And
[39:53] before I could think a voice, I give you
[39:57] your husband before morning.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:02] Oh my. I was so scared because I said,
[40:04] "Lord God have mercy. Now my ministry is
[40:08] going to be in shambles."
[40:13] 4:00 in the morning. Bang bang bang bang
[40:15] bang. I woke up, opened the door. So
[40:18] what? What's What's the noise? What the
[40:21] the lady's hus the pastor himself came.
[40:24] The lady's husband came back. He he
[40:27] walked across that whole American city
[40:30] in the pouring rain. something drove him
[40:33] right back to his home.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; He became born again.
[40:41] He became a deacon.
[40:43] And he was a believer even more, I
[40:47] should say that, even more than his wife
[40:51] [laughter] until he died. Oh, praise
[40:54] God. Do you believe him?
[40:56] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and
[40:59] forever. He doesn't fail. He is God.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; You see, we we don't preach the gospel
[41:06] like it's back in the Bible days. It's
[41:08] an imaginary story of Jesus or the
[41:12] apostles. Let me tell you, the apostles
[41:14] are here.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; The pastors are here.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; The evangelists are here.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; The same Holy Spirit is here.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brandham said, "Do
[41:25] you realize that the same sun that's
[41:28] shining over you today
[41:30] &gt;&gt; is the one that shined over Adam?"
[41:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; It hasn't changed.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; It's the same son.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; In the same way, we It's the same God
[41:42] &gt;&gt; and he's here with us
[41:45] &gt;&gt; every step of the way. We just have to
[41:48] get ourselves out of the way, relax, and
[41:51] let him have his way. Praise the Lord.
[41:54] Now, um, of late, a lot of believers
[41:58] have been passing on to go and be with
[42:01] the Lord. How many knows that?
[42:04] The last, uh, one I know about is
[42:06] Brother Biscll. He's left great warriors
[42:10] left and gone to his rewards. Many more
[42:13] before him, right? Even in our local
[42:17] church, you know, Sister Johnson has
[42:20] gone on, this one has gone on, the other
[42:23] one passed on, gone to be in the
[42:25] presence of the Lord. Yes. Because we've
[42:28] come to the crossing. And and now uh
[42:32] some of the older ones have are passing
[42:35] on while you younger ones enter into the
[42:39] new land. Uh led by the Holy Spirit. uh
[42:44] Joshua of this hour
[42:46] &gt;&gt; entering into the wars uh entering and
[42:50] taking cities and strongholds for the
[42:54] glory of God. It may not seem like that,
[42:58] but it's happening spiritually.
[43:01] Is that right? It's happening
[43:02] spiritually. Now, your battles may be a
[43:06] little different than we had it back
[43:08] there, but it's the same kind of
[43:11] pressure, right? uh and God has got to
[43:14] come on the scene and that is why he
[43:17] gave us hope
[43:19] that we are not following him in vain.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; Uh uh we're not following an imagination
[43:27] &gt;&gt; but we are following God with a certain
[43:31] hope and faith in his word. I want to
[43:34] speak today on anticipating heaven.
[43:40] living in a state of anticipation of
[43:43] heaven. Praise God. Our scriptures if
[43:47] the brothers will begin uh will be John
[43:50] uh 14 1-3
[43:54] and 1 Corinthians
[43:56] 2 verse 9.
[44:02] And let us stand and read it all
[44:05] together. For faith comes, revelation
[44:08] comes by hearing, and hearing by the
[44:12] word of God.
[44:16] Let not your heart be troubled.
[44:20] You believe in God, believe also in me.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; In my father's house are many mansions.
[44:28] If it were not so, I would have told
[44:31] you. I go to prepare a place for you.
[44:37] And if I go and prepare a place for you,
[44:40] I will come again and receive you unto
[44:44] myself, that where I am, there you may
[44:49] be
[44:50] &gt;&gt; also.
[44:53] 1 Corinthians 2:9,
[44:58] as it is written,
[45:00] I had not seen nor ear heard,
[45:06] neither have entered into the heart of
[45:09] man the things which God had prepared
[45:15] for them that loved him.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; You have stuff prepared for you before
[45:20] you got there. you get there.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; Uh stuff that you can't imagine, you
[45:25] can't even start thinking and trying to
[45:28] analyze and find. I wonder what God is
[45:30] keeping in secret for me so that when I
[45:33] get there, uh uh you know, like a
[45:35] husband trying to surprise his wife, he
[45:37] he's got some things prepared.
[45:40] So So I'm anticipating heaven.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; God bless you. A gracious heavenly
[45:46] father, how wonderful for us to talk
[45:50] about your things that you have made
[45:52] known to us. Father, when we as we
[45:55] gather like this, just bless us
[45:57] together. Lift us up for a for a hour or
[46:01] two into your presence that we might
[46:04] consider the things of God, consider our
[46:07] soul, consider our lives, consider our
[46:10] future and our walk with God. For we ask
[46:13] it in the name of our blessed Lord and
[46:16] precious savior Jesus Christ. Amen. God
[46:20] bless you. Please be seated.
[46:23] [clears throat]
[46:25] You know um there's a beautiful song. So
[46:29] most of you or many of you may know it
[46:31] says how beautiful heaven must be.
[46:37] Sweet home of the happy and free.
[46:42] Fair haven of rest for the weary.
[46:47] How beautiful heaven must be. Amen. Yes.
[46:53] And heaven is a beautiful place. How
[46:55] many will believe that?
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We had one sister. Some
[47:01] of you around still know about her. uh
[47:04] that's uh went uh off under operation.
[47:09] She went to be with the Lord pronounced
[47:12] dead. They write wrote it up dead. But
[47:16] while they were writing it up, she was
[47:18] far away in the presence of God. And
[47:22] there she was able to meet with Abraham
[47:26] and talk to her. And and she loved the
[47:30] presence of God and the presence of the
[47:32] people so much. She wanted to stay
[47:34] there. And Abraham, that's what she
[47:38] said, told her, "No, you have to go
[47:40] back. Your purpose on earth is not
[47:43] done." And with that, she find herself
[47:47] back on the bed and awake and the
[47:50] doctors shouting and wondering to know
[47:52] what happened.
[47:54] [laughter and gasps] Praise the Lord.
[47:56] But we know what happened.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Though he were dead, yet shall he live.
[48:02] M there was a a brother by the name of
[48:05] brother Morris
[48:07] and he died at about 84 years old in
[48:12] California in February. Uh and when he
[48:16] died he said these words, I die in peace
[48:21] with all men. I shall soon be with the
[48:25] angels. And that's with every one of us.
[48:28] absent from the body, you're present
[48:30] with the Lord.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; There is no intermediary state. There is
[48:35] no need for prayer uh to pray you out of
[48:38] purgatory because Paul said absent from
[48:42] the body, present with the Lord. Amen.
[48:46] Praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah.
[48:49] Amen. I'm seeing some saints that I
[48:51] haven't seen for a while, but I I I
[48:54] can't stop now to say God bless you. We
[48:57] welcome you. Amen. Praise the Lord. Now,
[49:01] we know that this brother died with
[49:03] peace of mind. And every one of us, if
[49:06] that time comes, praise God, we want to
[49:09] die with peace of mind. We don't want to
[49:12] die haunted and horrified by what is
[49:15] laying in the great beyond. But we want
[49:18] to die with peace of mind. Everybody
[49:21] wants it. Praise God. Hallelujah. Why?
[49:24] Why is it? Because we live in a world
[49:27] where there's hardly any peace.
[49:30] People's minds are not at ease. They
[49:34] don't have peace of mind. They're
[49:36] troubled. They're worried. They're
[49:38] fearful. They're nervous. They And they
[49:42] they don't know why the world is a in a
[49:45] pressurized situation now. And everyone
[49:50] Christian or non-Christian, you feel the
[49:53] pressure of the darkness around you.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; And you know it is there for a fact.
[49:59] Amen. And most people are under that
[50:04] kind of pressure, even Christians
[50:08] so-called, because of the sins they
[50:11] committed
[50:12] and their own guilt, their own
[50:15] conscience that they're wrestling with
[50:19] every day. You can say, "No, I don't."
[50:22] But the moment you get a quiet moment,
[50:26] you'll hear that voice say, "You know,
[50:28] you shouldn't have done that.
[50:30] you show you, you know, you shouldn't
[50:32] have done this. You know, you were wrong
[50:35] when you said that. You shouldn't have
[50:37] answered that person in that way. You
[50:40] shouldn't have, you know, you know that
[50:43] that's not just your thoughts. It's God
[50:47] speaking to you and then you'll shake it
[50:49] off and you want to continue on with
[50:52] that kind of a life, right? And so
[50:56] they're wrestling with their conscience,
[50:59] fighting all the time, with their guilt.
[51:03] And then many others can't find peace.
[51:08] As one uh brother was telling me, he was
[51:12] in a certain Christian denomination.
[51:15] They gave him a high position where he's
[51:19] organizing some people and stuff like
[51:22] that, but yet he can see the wickedness
[51:25] of the priests. He could see the
[51:28] corruption and all of that going on. And
[51:33] some of those people in those places,
[51:36] they [screaming] are their spirits are
[51:39] filled with fear, with doubt, with
[51:42] trouble. Right? It's the wicked systems
[51:46] in the world.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; Even the governments in the world have
[51:51] their citizens under pressure. Uh uh
[51:55] their minds are pressurized. The they're
[51:58] in a state of constant tension. Uh uh
[52:02] they don't know how to get out of it.
[52:04] They're caught in the web of a worldly
[52:07] system. right now in India many years
[52:12] ago, brother Brandham spoke of it. He
[52:15] said, "Do people notice animals moving
[52:17] away from the fences and the buildings
[52:20] and uh going out in the fields under a
[52:23] tree or something, but they'll stay away
[52:25] from walls and buildings and everything
[52:28] else. And and dogs begin to bark and
[52:32] howl and animals begin to run like
[52:35] something is wrong with them. But what
[52:37] was it? They were sensing the coming of
[52:41] impending judgment and disaster. It was
[52:44] an earthquake that was on the way.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; And the animals could sense it before
[52:50] the humans.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Oh my God says the stor knows the way my
[52:57] ways of my coming, but the people knows
[53:00] not the judgments of the Lord. They they
[53:04] can't seem to find sense it. The
[53:06] judgment is coming.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; I said judgment is coming.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; Payday is coming.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Every one of us will have to pay for the
[53:16] sins we have done in the flesh.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter who we are, we'll have to
[53:22] pay for it. Amen. Yes, sir. So, the
[53:25] world is in that state. Amen. Brother
[53:29] Brandham said it like a boy whistling
[53:34] through a graveyard. Let me have the
[53:37] next quote. Praise the Lord. Up there,
[53:39] brother. Praise the Lord. Amen. Yes,
[53:43] sir.
[53:45] One minute, please.
[53:49] Brother Brandham says,
[53:51] "It reminds me
[53:54] of this these comedians now. They're
[53:57] telling a lot of jokes, carrying on,
[54:00] women carrying on the way they do, and
[54:04] men together. It just reminds me like a
[54:08] little boy going through the graveyard
[54:12] whistling trying to make himself believe
[54:16] that he's not scared.
[54:19] Sure, he's scared. See, he ain't fooling
[54:23] nobody. That's why he's whistling.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[54:27] &gt;&gt; He's trying to say he's not scared, but
[54:30] he is. And that's what's the matter
[54:33] today with today. Is that right?
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Uh, you know, when I was young and I
[54:39] read that, I started laughing because
[54:42] the same thing had happened to me.
[54:45] We as boys had gone to the cinema to see
[54:48] Frankenstein.
[54:50] How many knows? I know it's an old thing
[54:53] with Frankenstein, the monster movie,
[54:57] not realizing that the cinema show would
[54:59] end very late. And when it ended late,
[55:03] we had to get home. And to go home, we
[55:06] were in one tongue. And to get to my
[55:10] tongue, there was a mile long graveyard,
[55:17] no lights,
[55:19] [laughter]
[55:20] it was dark. So we're I'm walking I'm
[55:24] walking, but because I'm short now and
[55:27] think of how short I was there at 12.
[55:31] [cough]
[55:32] [laughter] And as as I was walking, I
[55:35] noticed some adults ahead of me and they
[55:38] were talking and walking and going on.
[55:40] So I try to keep up with them so I can
[55:43] have some company through the graveyard.
[55:45] But their feet are longer and they're
[55:47] walking faster and they start walking
[55:49] away from me and before I know it, I'm
[55:51] left in the middle of this graveyard and
[55:54] nobody around. So what do I do? I start
[55:57] whistling. [laughter]
[55:59] So you can imagine when I read brother
[56:02] Brandham saying this, how that felt to
[56:05] me. Amen. So I was whistling in the
[56:07] graveyard trying to come out of there
[56:10] safely like that. Amen. Yes, sir. But
[56:14] that's what the world is doing.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; They're trying to drink themselves drunk
[56:20] so that they their conscience wouldn't
[56:22] speak to them. It wouldn't talk to them
[56:25] and tell them, "You're wrong. You're
[56:28] guilty. Get out of that thing. Amen.
[56:32] Come out of your filth and your
[56:34] corruption. Oh [screaming] my god. They
[56:37] they Oh, they'll run over there and use
[56:39] some drugs or they'll run over here and
[56:42] they'll they they'll get a woman or
[56:44] they'll drink some wine or or they'll
[56:47] take something over there that will just
[56:49] distract them only for a brief time and
[56:53] they're back where they started. Amen.
[56:56] But that's the age that we are living
[56:59] in. Amen. Yes. While the people are like
[57:02] that, the whole world is guilty. The
[57:06] whole world [screaming] is facing doom.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; And they could sense it. Amen. And so
[57:12] they're whistling and they're having
[57:13] jokes on the TV, laughter, and lots of
[57:17] sports events to distract. The devil
[57:20] just wants to distract the people. Uh
[57:22] sports events. Wonderful. Yay.
[57:25] Everybody's shouting and everything
[57:27] else. Nobody's throwing their hats and
[57:29] caps up for Jesus.
[57:31] And if you do in the church someone to
[57:33] condemn you said you gone Pentecostal,
[57:37] you're too emotional. You should speak
[57:40] very, you know, controlled a proper way
[57:44] of after dinner speeches and lectures
[57:48] and stuff like that. Not knowing that
[57:51] God builds us people differently.
[57:54] We we we are just individuals
[57:57] &gt;&gt; and God will shine the light of his
[58:00] revelation through the prism of your
[58:04] personality
[58:06] &gt;&gt; and the light or the revelation or the
[58:09] words that's coming out of it is coming
[58:11] out with so many pieces uh like when a
[58:16] star is twinkling in the sky is not one
[58:19] color. You could look at the star and
[58:21] see it's purple, it's pink, it's yellow,
[58:24] it's all coming out at the same time
[58:27] because the light strikes it. Amen. And
[58:30] it reflects that light back. Praise God.
[58:33] He, the prophet of God, said this the
[58:35] same way. The messenger catches the
[58:38] light. It strikes him. Shines it back
[58:41] into the church age.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Back into the church age. Praise the
[58:45] Lord. Even so is your little life. God's
[58:49] light strikes it and then it shines back
[58:52] out to the people. Amen.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Sometimes
[58:57] it's a literal light just like it was
[59:00] with brother Brandon. Sometimes it's
[59:02] just a spiritual light. Amen. You know,
[59:06] you've had that where this fellow came
[59:08] and said, "Oh my god, there's a light
[59:10] around you. They sent me to me to sent
[59:12] me to you to tell you." I said, "They
[59:15] sent you to me?" No. No, I said you made
[59:18] a mistake. I am sent to you to tell you
[59:20] that I see flames in your future. Of
[59:23] course, he [clears throat] ran away.
[59:25] Praise the name of the Lord. Praise God.
[59:28] You see, so this is the way it is. This
[59:30] is the age that we are living in and
[59:33] these things are all around us. People
[59:36] are living in constant fear.
[59:39] Fear of break and enter, fear of
[59:42] shootings, fear of somebody stabbing you
[59:45] with a knife, fear of getting on the
[59:47] bus, fear every time there people are
[59:51] afraid. They're living in dread. Listen,
[59:54] I lived in New York City and you talk
[59:57] about a pressure cooker. You walking and
[59:59] you constantly have to be looking over
[1:00:01] your shoulder or whatever to make sure
[1:00:04] you don't have a sign on your back
[1:00:06] saying, "Please mug me or rob me.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; [laughter and clears throat]
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; you. It's just you're walking with like
[1:00:15] a almost like that you're under a
[1:00:17] pressure cooker all the time. Somebody
[1:00:21] is trying to get at you in some way or
[1:00:25] the other. Amen. Yes, sir. Praise God.
[1:00:28] But I'm so happy that I found Jesus
[1:00:32] Christ
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; and he has made a change in my life.
[1:00:36] Amen.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; The people are being [screaming]
[1:00:40] tormented by the devil himself.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; What are you talking about, brother
[1:00:45] Simon? Prophet said, "It shall come to
[1:00:47] pass the whole world will go insane."
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; What do you think that is? It's devils
[1:00:53] tormenting the people,
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; tormenting their minds with depression.
[1:00:58] Brother Gabe,
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; yes.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; The tormenting their minds with all
[1:01:03] kinds of of guilt, with shame, with
[1:01:06] this, tormenting them constantly all the
[1:01:10] time, tormenting them with disease,
[1:01:14] tormenting them with afflictions,
[1:01:16] tormenting [screaming] them with
[1:01:18] nervousness,
[1:01:20] nervous breakdowns. How many of you are
[1:01:23] hearing more and more nervous
[1:01:25] breakdowns? Amen.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; Uh uh uh brother Gabriel knows about
[1:01:30] this uh in his community where the
[1:01:32] people are a little up and up uh and
[1:01:36] their children will have no need of
[1:01:38] nothing. And yet you find they're
[1:01:41] hanging themselves.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Hanging themselves for what? They don't
[1:01:45] need nothing. I mean financially stable,
[1:01:50] everything is fine. The future is fine.
[1:01:52] And yet they're hanging themselves.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Is that right? What's going on?
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; What madness is this? This this devil
[1:02:00] doing that to the minds of the young
[1:02:03] people,
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; getting their minds all mixed up and and
[1:02:07] and all in a tizzy of that way. Physical
[1:02:12] and mental disturbances.
[1:02:15] Amen. Praise God. But I'm glad that I
[1:02:18] serve a God who is able.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; He is able.
[1:02:24] And uh uh while I'm talking, I don't
[1:02:26] care what you're suffering from, what
[1:02:28] trouble you have, what problem you have.
[1:02:31] God can answer your problem [screaming]
[1:02:34] if you will pray while I am preaching.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, help me.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Give me this. Give me my husband.
[1:02:43] [screaming] I claim this. I claim that
[1:02:46] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; And God will give it to you. Not because
[1:02:52] of my faith, I'm going to give it to
[1:02:54] you. No, because your faith. Talking to
[1:02:57] God. God knows. He can hear all of us.
[1:03:00] Even while the service is going on,
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; can God listen to a 10,000 people? He's
[1:03:05] listening to the whole world
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; and he knows everything. And he's
[1:03:09] hearing you. Even your whisper, your
[1:03:12] secret thoughts, God knows all about it.
[1:03:14] Nothing is hidden from him. Just talk to
[1:03:16] him. It's as simple as that. and said,
[1:03:19] "Lord Lord, uh, bless me. Lord, forgive
[1:03:22] me. Lord, provide this for me. Lord, I
[1:03:25] need this. I need this." Praise the
[1:03:27] Lord. Hallelujah. And God will do it for
[1:03:29] you. Amen. [clears throat] And if the
[1:03:32] world goes on the way it is, we know
[1:03:34] where it's headed. Brother Brennham said
[1:03:36] it clearly in another quote. There is no
[1:03:40] future but the coming of the Lord.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. No future. Listen, my friends,
[1:03:48] there we don't have no future. Cuz if
[1:03:51] God just tears up and destroys
[1:03:53] everything, where is your future? Our
[1:03:55] hope is in the Lord.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Our hope is in his promise.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; I go to prepare a place for you
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; that where I am, you may be also.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; We don't just die and take a leap in the
[1:04:11] dark.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Hoping that we go somewhere.
[1:04:15] We know where we are going
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; because God made a promise
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; I [screaming] go to prepare a place for
[1:04:23] you
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; that where I am, you may be also.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; You'll be in a body like I am in this
[1:04:31] body and you'll be in the same location
[1:04:33] where I am also. I'm I've gone to
[1:04:35] prepare a place for you. Do you believe
[1:04:37] that?
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; And your change has already started.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Thank you, God. The prophet said, "You
[1:04:45] know that." He says, "You you're changed
[1:04:48] already." He says, "Once you were there
[1:04:50] in sin and now what? You're justified."
[1:04:52] He says, "What is that? You're out.
[1:04:54] You've come out of the world. You're
[1:04:56] already almost your lift off to glory
[1:04:59] already started.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; It it's so uh it's so gentle that you
[1:05:04] don't realize it, but the rapture is now
[1:05:07] in progress."
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:05:12] Yes, sir. I tell you. Praise God. The
[1:05:15] flashing red lights of his coming. All
[1:05:18] the signs are all around. And let me
[1:05:21] tell you friends that the train is
[1:05:23] coming in the station.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; And you better be ready to get on the
[1:05:27] train
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; because this train is bound for glory.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; Get on the train. Don't miss this train.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; You must be on the train because it's
[1:05:37] going to take you right into glory.
[1:05:39] Amen.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know, we all love home.
[1:05:45] And I love home. And I love the homeland
[1:05:49] that I come from. How many of you love
[1:05:52] the homeland you come from?
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. You know, the cowboys
[1:05:59] used to call heaven the corral with
[1:06:03] ghost riders in the sky.
[1:06:06] the Indians, these princes of the
[1:06:09] plains. Uh, and we call them in Canada
[1:06:13] the first nations, the first people,
[1:06:16] right? Uh, here the the happy hunting
[1:06:20] grounds. Amen. And then that's how they
[1:06:23] can imagine themselves happy and just
[1:06:25] free and hunting anywhere they want to.
[1:06:28] and and and that's how they believe
[1:06:30] heaven is going to be uh like the Arabs
[1:06:35] call it simply call it paradise. Say
[1:06:38] heaven is like paradise.
[1:06:42] Some call it the chapel in the sky. Some
[1:06:44] call it the harvest home. Uh other
[1:06:47] people call it Shangrila. Right. Uh the
[1:06:52] Romans at Mount Olympus. That's where
[1:06:55] we'll be all be brought to the top of
[1:06:57] Mount Olympus. And uh some say, "Oh,
[1:07:01] it's the beautiful aisle of somewhere
[1:07:04] somewhere." They don't know where, but
[1:07:07] it's a beautiful aisle somewhere like
[1:07:10] that. Uh my goodness, the scripture says
[1:07:13] the ivory palaces, the the Jews call it
[1:07:17] Zion's Hill. Praise the Lord. And it's
[1:07:21] called Buler Land. Sweet bula land.
[1:07:25] Amen. But the prophet called it, there's
[1:07:28] a land beyond the river that we call the
[1:07:34] sweet forever. Can we sing that?
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; And we'll only reach that shore by faith
[1:07:42] decreeing.
[1:07:44] One by one we gain the portals
[1:07:49] there to dwell with the immortals
[1:07:54] when they ring those golden [screaming]
[1:07:57] bells for you and me. [singing]
[1:08:03] Can't you hear the bells now ringing?
[1:08:07] [singing]
[1:08:08] Can't you hear the angels singing?
[1:08:14] There's a glory. Hallelujah.
[1:08:18] Jubilee [singing]
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; in that far of sweet forever
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; just beyond
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; just in the next dimension
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; when they reach golden [screaming]
[1:08:36] bells for you.
[1:08:40] The prophet said, "Do you realize it's
[1:08:42] passing through the room right now?
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; I can look and I can see people and
[1:08:50] things passing right now.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Just beyond the shining river,
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; a place we call
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; the sweet forever.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Let us anticipate heaven.
[1:09:07] But whatever men want to call it, the
[1:09:11] Bible said it's a place of perfect
[1:09:14] peace, unending bliss, [snorts]
[1:09:17] and unspeakable happiness, joy
[1:09:21] unspeakable. Paul said, full of glory.
[1:09:25] Amen. The scriptures tell us plainly,
[1:09:28] Jesus has gone to prepare a place for
[1:09:31] us. Amen. He's gone to prepare what? a
[1:09:35] future home for his earthly bride.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Just like some of you young
[1:09:41] men are prepare. You ain't got the the
[1:09:43] bride yet, but you you start preparing.
[1:09:47] Amen. You're saving. If you're not, then
[1:09:50] I'm telling you, you should start doing
[1:09:51] it. [laughter]
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:09:59] Amen. you you you can't love on a hungry
[1:10:03] stomach,
[1:10:05] [laughter]
[1:10:07] right? So, you've got to be prepared.
[1:10:10] Praise the name of the Lord. That's why
[1:10:11] I admire brother Vishnu uh Hari Pasad.
[1:10:16] Um how before as a pastor, he would talk
[1:10:19] to me and say, you know, he's saving he
[1:10:22] he's going to buy this little condo,
[1:10:24] he's going to get this and going to do
[1:10:26] that. So when he he did that and when he
[1:10:29] was ready to marry already had a little
[1:10:31] condo and he had some put aside and time
[1:10:34] for him to marry, he's able to go marry
[1:10:37] and then take his wife to the little
[1:10:39] place later on sell it and then move on
[1:10:42] to something better. Praise God. But you
[1:10:45] don't just sit around and just uh hope
[1:10:48] some you know something happens. No,
[1:10:51] you've got to rest in God's grace and
[1:10:53] let God move you and bless you and use
[1:10:56] you for your honor and glory. For his
[1:10:59] honor and glory. Amen. Praise the name
[1:11:01] of the Lord. But we know that it's so
[1:11:04] wonderful. It's so beautiful. Praise the
[1:11:08] Lord. You say, "My brother Sam, why you
[1:11:10] talk like that the other morning?"
[1:11:12] Whether dreaming, whether vision,
[1:11:14] whether asleep or awake, I don't know.
[1:11:17] But I saw some of those people young and
[1:11:21] fresh and healthy. I can't even explain
[1:11:23] it. Uh their eyes like stars, not bright
[1:11:27] and shining, but I mean the health in
[1:11:29] the eyes was so brilliant. Their teeth
[1:11:32] white and clean and gleaming while
[1:11:35] they're speaking. And my goodness,
[1:11:38] brother, sister, let me tell you, it's
[1:11:40] something else. when the brother
[1:11:41] Brandham said we are going to uh go
[1:11:45] right back to about 20 21 years old.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; So don't sit here a and think oh my body
[1:11:53] is wasting away. I'm getting older. Yes.
[1:11:56] So that you can get out of this and get
[1:11:58] into that.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; That's what it is. Death don't hold no
[1:12:03] terror for us.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're moving out of here and we're
[1:12:07] moving into that. Amen.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; This one is in time. That was the
[1:12:11] eternal.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; We going into the eternal. [screaming]
[1:12:14] Praise the name of the Lord Jesus.
[1:12:16] Hallelujah. No wonder Brother Dig said,
[1:12:19] "Oh my goodness." On that rapture day,
[1:12:22] we'll have the greatest youth meeting
[1:12:24] the world has ever seen because of all
[1:12:26] [screaming] of us will be back to being
[1:12:28] young again by the grace of God.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. 1 Corinthians 2:9.
[1:12:37] For as it is written, I hath not seen
[1:12:41] nor ear heard, neither has it entered
[1:12:44] into the heart of man the things which
[1:12:47] God has prepared for those that love
[1:12:50] him. Amen. You can't even imagine it or
[1:12:54] think about heaven. How beautiful it
[1:12:56] must be and marvelous. But we live in
[1:12:59] this joyous anticipation. One step and
[1:13:03] we'll be there by the grace of God.
[1:13:05] Listen, I'm not talking out of a debt
[1:13:07] wish.
[1:13:09] [laughter]
[1:13:10] Hey. Oh, is that brother Chris? Oh,
[1:13:13] praise the God. Bless your brother.
[1:13:20] I'm glad my amen corner is here.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; If none of you say amen, you're going to
[1:13:24] hear amen coming from the back. Praise
[1:13:27] the Lord. Hallelujah. [clears throat]
[1:13:29] Amen. Titus 2:13 says, "Looking for that
[1:13:34] blessed hope and the glorious appearing
[1:13:37] of the great God and our savior Jesus
[1:13:41] Christ." The great God and our savior.
[1:13:43] It's not two people, but the same God is
[1:13:46] your savior.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord, which is
[1:13:48] the Lord Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. How
[1:13:51] many of you wants to go to heaven?
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Praise. I want to I want to go to
[1:13:56] heaven. I know I'm on my way to heaven.
[1:14:00] But so many people want to go go to
[1:14:02] heaven. Nobody wants to die.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. This is just my way of
[1:14:10] relaxing and talking to you. Everybody
[1:14:12] wants to go to heaven, but when you talk
[1:14:14] about death, nobody wants to die, but
[1:14:16] you want to get to heaven. [laughter]
[1:14:18] No. No. It doesn't work that way. Praise
[1:14:21] the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Uh h
[1:14:25] and if you don't want to go to heaven,
[1:14:27] if not, why not? Why don't you want to
[1:14:29] go to heaven? I want to go. Amen. Praise
[1:14:33] the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Jesus
[1:14:35] said, Brother Brandham used to love to
[1:14:37] sing, "Come and go with me to my
[1:14:39] father's house. Let's go together."
[1:14:41] Amen. Praise God. And go to my father's
[1:14:45] house where there's peace and there is
[1:14:48] joy. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:14:51] [clears throat]
[1:14:52] You know, a mother and a father, both
[1:14:55] believers, lost their two children.
[1:15:00] And
[1:15:02] [clears throat] people thought that
[1:15:03] would keep them from going to the
[1:15:05] service on Sunday, but they were in
[1:15:08] service as usual on that Sunday, even
[1:15:11] though they had buried their children
[1:15:14] during the week.
[1:15:16] and he happened to be the song leader
[1:15:19] and she happened to be the pianist
[1:15:23] and they took their positions and she
[1:15:27] started playing on the piano and he
[1:15:29] announced the song Rock of Ages cleft
[1:15:33] for me let me hide myself in thee and
[1:15:37] while they were playing the people were
[1:15:39] crying but they were not they were solid
[1:15:42] in the grace of God hallelujah amen
[1:15:46] Amen. They were praising God and giving
[1:15:48] God the glory and honor. Amen. Had their
[1:15:52] compulsure. Uh, Amen. Until the
[1:15:55] congregation was saying, "How can these
[1:15:57] two people stand it? How can they stand
[1:16:01] it that their children pass away and
[1:16:03] they they're not in grief or anything
[1:16:07] like that." But well, the service ended
[1:16:12] and on the way home a little boy holding
[1:16:14] his father's hand, you know, and while
[1:16:18] they're walking
[1:16:20] and he says, "Well, seems like they
[1:16:22] really believe it." Uh, don't they? So
[1:16:26] the father said, "What are you talking
[1:16:28] about?" Uh, don't believe what? Who?
[1:16:31] What? Believe what, son? He said, "Well,
[1:16:34] them people some like they believe in
[1:16:36] Easter
[1:16:38] [laughter]
[1:16:39] and they believe in resurrection
[1:16:42] uh and uh like that." The father said,
[1:16:47] "Of course all Christians believe that."
[1:16:50] He said, "Not like them too do. Not like
[1:16:53] them." Amen. They believe all of it.
[1:16:57] Amen. They believe all of it. Nothing
[1:17:01] left out. Praise God. Hallelujah. My
[1:17:04] friends, death holds no terror for the
[1:17:07] bloodbought saints of God.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Death is a doorway for us to enter into
[1:17:13] the grace of God. We're not worried
[1:17:15] about death.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Death changes us. Praise the name of the
[1:17:19] Lord.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; When you get to the place where you're
[1:17:22] not worried about that, about death,
[1:17:25] then you're free.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; You're free from this world and all it
[1:17:29] is, all its cares. Amen. Because eyes
[1:17:32] have not seen nor ears heard what God
[1:17:35] has in store for them that love him.
[1:17:39] Amen. Isn't it Jesus that said, "I am he
[1:17:41] that liveth and was dead."
[1:17:46] Of all other men in the Bible, it is
[1:17:48] written, "And Methuselah lived a
[1:17:50] thousand years, and he died. And Isaac
[1:17:53] lived 700 so many, and he died. And this
[1:17:57] one lived, and he died." But what we are
[1:18:00] reading about now, he said, "I was dead,
[1:18:02] [screaming] but now I'm alive forever
[1:18:05] more."
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Alive forever more.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Showing you the original wheat seed can
[1:18:13] come back to life. He's telling you your
[1:18:16] resurrection is right in me. Praise God.
[1:18:19] And if I can come back, you're coming
[1:18:21] back. Amen.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; He's bringing you back by the grace of
[1:18:24] God.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Talk about a rapture. Amen.
[1:18:29] We're right in it right now for the
[1:18:31] glory of God. Hallelujah. Amen. Brother
[1:18:34] Brandham said, "Don't let the devil lie
[1:18:38] to you. If in your heart you're a real
[1:18:41] Christian, you are going to heaven. Just
[1:18:44] believe it like the rest of them
[1:18:47] believed it."
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're going. How many believes
[1:18:51] they're going? I'm going.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Please don't
[1:18:56] tell me don't get excited.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah, you know, God builds everybody
[1:19:01] different. Some people can be excited
[1:19:02] and still remain calm and nice, but uh
[1:19:06] you know, I'm an extrovert. [laughter]
[1:19:09] I like people. I like to talk to people.
[1:19:12] So, so, so, uh that's the way it is.
[1:19:15] Praise God. Said, "But you're you're
[1:19:17] older man. You should watch your heart
[1:19:19] and how you behave before you overdo
[1:19:21] it." [laughter]
[1:19:24] Is that right? Oh my. But I've got to be
[1:19:27] myself. Praise God. I wish I could be
[1:19:30] like that old man that Brother Brandham
[1:19:33] said. He says, "When I seen that man,
[1:19:36] old man preached that word and jump." He
[1:19:41] says, "Almost right over the rainbow
[1:19:44] down to the other side and preach that
[1:19:46] word." Hallelujah. Oh, brother. Every
[1:19:49] one of us should be like like Joshua and
[1:19:52] Caleb. Amen. Having strength to even to
[1:19:56] the very end of your days. Praise the
[1:19:58] name of the Lord.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah. Oh
[1:20:03] my. Let's have hope.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham often said, "Look and
[1:20:08] live, my brothers. Live. Look to Jesus
[1:20:12] now and live."
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Hallelujah. Amen. Yes,
[1:20:17] sir. Now, we've seen how believers die,
[1:20:20] but you know that a lot of unbelievers
[1:20:24] die, but they don't make a lot of noise
[1:20:26] about it.
[1:20:28] I've seen them die. I've seen them hold
[1:20:31] my hand and scream
[1:20:34] while they're dying. Too late. Too late
[1:20:37] shall be the cry. Jesus of Nazareth has
[1:20:41] passed you by. Oh my God have mercy.
[1:20:45] Amen. And infidel was there on his
[1:20:48] deathbed. He says, "Oh God, deliver me
[1:20:51] from that awful pit." And cried with a
[1:20:54] awful whale. And then he went silent.
[1:20:57] And then all of a sudden, he screamed
[1:20:59] again, "I'm in the flames. Pull me
[1:21:02] [screaming] out. Pull me out. Pull me
[1:21:04] out of it." Amen. Praise God. But listen
[1:21:07] friends, it's written in the scriptures.
[1:21:12] Then shall he say also to them
[1:21:16] on the left hand, depart from me, ye
[1:21:20] cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared
[1:21:23] for the devil and his angels. And they
[1:21:27] shall go away into everlasting
[1:21:29] punishment, but the righteous into life
[1:21:32] eternal, and cast you the unprofitable
[1:21:36] servant unto outer darkness. There shall
[1:21:41] be weeping, wailing, and nashing of
[1:21:45] teeth. Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:21:49] Friends, let me tell you, a young steel
[1:21:51] worker over in England, [clears throat]
[1:21:54] you know, we have a steel company in
[1:21:56] Hamilton and somebody died there the
[1:21:59] other day. Um, and that happens from
[1:22:02] time to time, accidents. But in England,
[1:22:05] this young steel worker somehow he
[1:22:08] stumbled and fell on a red hot steel
[1:22:12] plate.
[1:22:14] I don't know if you know what I'm
[1:22:16] talking about, that when they poured the
[1:22:18] steel and it starts, it's not solid yet,
[1:22:21] but it's starting to get solid, but it's
[1:22:23] red hot. He fell on what? stumbled
[1:22:28] passing by onto a steel plate like that,
[1:22:32] hot uh like that upon him. And when he
[1:22:35] they rolled him off, all of his one side
[1:22:39] of his body was cooked and burnt to the
[1:22:44] bone. So some of the workmates that were
[1:22:47] there cried out uh uh uh uh you know,
[1:22:50] they cried out to him uh like that. that
[1:22:53] you see they were saying, "Oh my God,
[1:22:56] send for the doctor." Amen. But the the
[1:23:00] man cried, "I don't need no doctor."
[1:23:03] Amen. Tell me how I can get born again.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Tell me how I can get born again.
[1:23:12] And it just so happened nobody there was
[1:23:16] born again. They didn't know what to
[1:23:19] tell him. And he says, uh uh uh he died
[1:23:25] uh like that without God. Later on,
[1:23:28] somebody met one of those workers and
[1:23:30] says, "But you fellas, why didn't you
[1:23:32] tell him?" He you you you're supposed to
[1:23:35] be a churchgoer and a Christian. He
[1:23:37] says, "But I couldn't tell him because
[1:23:40] my life closed my lips."
[1:23:45] Wow.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; And many times the life that we live,
[1:23:49] close our lips.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; You you can't tell the person nothing
[1:23:54] because you know they're going to come
[1:23:55] back and say, "Come on, you do this. You
[1:23:57] did that. You Is that right?
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Close your lips." So, let's ask God to
[1:24:03] help us to live such lives where uh we
[1:24:08] can open our mouths freely and speak his
[1:24:11] word. comfort the people, draw them
[1:24:14] closer to him, bring them into a
[1:24:17] knowledge of him that the Holy Spirit
[1:24:20] might minister to them and bring them
[1:24:22] into this atmosphere of salvation. Amen.
[1:24:27] I have to ask the question, is your life
[1:24:29] closing your lips? Then right where you
[1:24:32] are, just whisper a prayer to God and
[1:24:35] say, "Lord Jesus, help me, Lord, that my
[1:24:38] life will be freed up and that I will be
[1:24:42] able to be free to speak and testify of
[1:24:46] the grace of the living God."
[1:24:48] Hallelujah. Amen. I hope you're not
[1:24:51] neglecting your soul salvation
[1:24:55] because the scripture says, "How shall
[1:24:57] we escape if we neglect?" so great a
[1:25:01] salvation. If you are here and you are
[1:25:04] not born again, don't neglect your
[1:25:07] salvation. Don't neglect your new birth.
[1:25:10] Let the Holy Spirit speak to your life
[1:25:13] and say, "I must make a change. This
[1:25:17] can't go on. May the great Holy Spirit
[1:25:20] break the power of sin and of the devil
[1:25:23] from over me and set me free that I
[1:25:26] might love him and serve him and worship
[1:25:28] him with my whole heart.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:25:32] Christ. I'm preaching like this. I
[1:25:34] didn't know you were going to be here
[1:25:35] this morning.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; I didn't know anybody particular going
[1:25:39] to be here. uh uh you know of course
[1:25:42] before coming up all during the week I
[1:25:45] had all messages with all kinds of
[1:25:47] revelation and the Holy Spirit bring me
[1:25:50] to something this simple and I was
[1:25:53] trying to fight up and say no no no and
[1:25:55] move away no it brought me back keep
[1:25:58] bringing me back so I'm right here amen
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; you can think or say whatever you want
[1:26:03] to say but I'm following his leadership
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; amen praise the the name of the Lord
[1:26:10] Jesus. Hallelujah. Let me tell you
[1:26:13] friends, this gospel is real.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; This is gospel is real.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; A little a young lady laid dying on a
[1:26:21] bed. [clears throat] Little sister
[1:26:24] Hattie from a town called Buford. Um
[1:26:29] uh there's a sister and a brother. I
[1:26:31] used to go to their home in that same uh
[1:26:33] in that same town. Anyway, she laid
[1:26:36] dying there and as she was sinking into
[1:26:39] death, she said, "Uh, uh, mother, I
[1:26:43] forgot to say my prayers." And the
[1:26:46] mother says, "Oh, well, you can say your
[1:26:48] prayers." And she lay dying and she
[1:26:50] going to say her prayers. And you know
[1:26:53] the prayer now I lay me down to sleep. I
[1:26:58] pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I
[1:27:02] should die before I wake, I pray the
[1:27:06] Lord my soul to take. And she never said
[1:27:11] another word and went to be with the
[1:27:14] Lord.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. God has his own way.
[1:27:20] Another little girl lay dying.
[1:27:25] She said, "Oh, daddy, how sweet the
[1:27:27] sight. Uh, how sweet the sight that I am
[1:27:32] seeing now. The golden gates are open.
[1:27:36] The crowds of children are pouring out
[1:27:38] to greet me. Oh, crowds of them. They're
[1:27:42] running up to me and they're taking me
[1:27:45] in their arms and [screaming] calling me
[1:27:47] by my name. Oh my. Then she looked
[1:27:51] upward as she lay on the bed saying,
[1:27:54] "Yes, I'm coming, Lord. I'm coming.
[1:27:57] Amen." and she went to be with the Lord.
[1:28:00] Hallelujah. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:28:03] Amen. Friends, when he calls me,
[1:28:05] [screaming] I will answer.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; I'll be somewhere listening for my name.
[1:28:10] Amen. I'll be listening for my name by
[1:28:13] the grace of God. Hallelujah. Yes, sir.
[1:28:16] Amen. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Uh there's a
[1:28:20] little sister up there in Texas. A
[1:28:23] believer of years gone by testified that
[1:28:27] as her mother lay dying, the mother
[1:28:30] suddenly shouted and said, "I see the
[1:28:34] [screaming] angels. I'm seeing them now.
[1:28:37] They're all in the room." Oh my praise
[1:28:41] God. Can't you see them? Can't you see
[1:28:44] them? And then she went to be with God.
[1:28:47] You know, brother Brandham talk about
[1:28:49] brother Fed Bosworth when he laid there
[1:28:52] in the bed and and then all of a sudden
[1:28:55] he would jump up and say, "Oh, uncle."
[1:28:57] And he start talking to his uncle and he
[1:28:59] start talking to his father. He says he
[1:29:02] literally was seeing them in the room.
[1:29:05] Is that right?
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; You know when Jesus uh uh uh in the just
[1:29:11] before everything there and the veil of
[1:29:13] the temple ripped, it says they started
[1:29:16] seeing the saints. Amen.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; Right? In other words, they they were
[1:29:19] starting to seeing the saints while
[1:29:21] they're in their flesh. And I'm not
[1:29:23] surprised if some of you that are here
[1:29:26] and alive, praise God, because it says,
[1:29:28] "And we which are alive and remain, who
[1:29:32] do you think it's talking about? It's
[1:29:34] this last age.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; It's you and me that are alive and
[1:29:39] remain,
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; will be caught up to have a be with the
[1:29:42] Lord." And during that period of time,
[1:29:45] uh, uh, uh, Maybe Abraham, Sarah, Job,
[1:29:50] you say, "Oh my, you that's going to
[1:29:52] happen." That will happen with some of
[1:29:54] us.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; You don't believe it? I believe it.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:30:01] uh 1998
[1:30:04] I for the first time I was invited to go
[1:30:06] to Nigeria by one of the kings there um
[1:30:10] who happened to be a brother and um uh I
[1:30:14] was wondering if I should go and um I
[1:30:17] like to read. So I was in the library
[1:30:19] and I was going up in the elevator and
[1:30:22] this dark skinned man with kind of curly
[1:30:25] hair came in and he stood up beside me
[1:30:28] and we're going up in the elevator. this
[1:30:30] is a big library. And he says, "Um, are
[1:30:34] you going to Nigeria?"
[1:30:37] You know, it's I I was so shocked I
[1:30:39] couldn't answer for for for a moment.
[1:30:42] And before I could even say anything, he
[1:30:44] says, "If I were you, I'd go to
[1:30:46] Nigeria."
[1:30:49] And before I could come to myself, the
[1:30:52] doors stop and he stepped out. And then
[1:30:54] then I thinking well how could he know
[1:30:57] I'm thinking about going to Nigeria and
[1:31:00] and come with that. Praise God. Of
[1:31:03] course when I I immediately went back to
[1:31:07] the floor, opened the door and looked
[1:31:08] around, searched the whole floor. No
[1:31:10] such a person there. Right? So I
[1:31:13] realized then that God still send
[1:31:16] angels.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Praise God. See, see, I've got to be
[1:31:23] careful because when you start talking
[1:31:25] like this, people begin to think you're
[1:31:28] talking about yourself and you want to
[1:31:30] make yourself look spiritual or
[1:31:32] something,
[1:31:33] they don't realize that the closer a man
[1:31:36] or woman comes to God and start to be
[1:31:39] get that oneness, they almost starting
[1:31:42] to talk almost in the first instant.
[1:31:46] They start I and my father are one. Let
[1:31:48] me just say it that way.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. you start to actually
[1:31:52] come to that state where you I and my
[1:31:54] father are one. Brother Brenham said
[1:31:56] when Jesus was healing the sick when he
[1:31:58] was creating bread when he was a great
[1:32:01] preacher that was wonderful but he said
[1:32:04] when he came down to the end of his
[1:32:06] ministry and he started saying I and my
[1:32:08] father are one
[1:32:11] be before Abraham was I [screaming] am
[1:32:17] when he started talking like that he
[1:32:18] said that's what caused the trouble amen
[1:32:22] see Jesus's life you divided in three
[1:32:25] years of preparation.
[1:32:27] Amen. Years of popularity
[1:32:31] and a year of persecution and
[1:32:34] crucifixion and death. It It's that way.
[1:32:37] And that's way brother Brandham said
[1:32:38] every preacher has a first, second, and
[1:32:41] third pull.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; Everyone. And it goes the same way.
[1:32:46] First pull, second pull. He came to his
[1:32:48] third pull. And there it is. The the
[1:32:51] denominations all get away from him.
[1:32:52] They don't want to hear that because now
[1:32:54] he's not he he's preaching the word
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; and the word is a separator.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. The word cuts to the
[1:33:02] bone. It's a discerner of your thoughts.
[1:33:05] Hallelujah.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, how did that man know that? It's not
[1:33:08] the man. It's the Holy Ghost knows that.
[1:33:10] The Holy Spirit knows that. And he
[1:33:12] discerns [screaming] the heart by the
[1:33:14] word of God. Hallelujah. Word of God.
[1:33:17] Quick, sharp, sharper than a two-edged
[1:33:20] sword. dividing your spirit, dividing
[1:33:23] your your soul by the word of God. And
[1:33:25] that's what the word is doing right now
[1:33:27] while I'm preaching is discerning you.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Is discerning your heart.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. Glory
[1:33:34] to God. Hallelujah. Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:33:37] Wonderful. Praise the Lord. I tell you,
[1:33:40] friends, how wonderful it is to be a
[1:33:42] child of God and to walk in his light.
[1:33:46] Amen. DL Moody said,
[1:33:50] "This is beautiful." He was dying on his
[1:33:53] dying deathbed. He said, "This is
[1:33:55] beautiful. This is beautiful. It feels
[1:33:58] like I'm in a trance,
[1:34:01] right? If this is death, it's sweet.
[1:34:05] There is no dark valley here."
[1:34:08] Amen. You know, people talk about the
[1:34:11] dark valley. Amen. Amen. He says,
[1:34:13] "Listen, there is no dark valley here.
[1:34:16] All I can hear is God calling my name.
[1:34:19] Amen. He's calling for me and I've got
[1:34:22] to go. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:34:24] Hallelujah. Let me tell you friends, I
[1:34:27] anticipate heaven.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; I look forward to it.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Here this
[1:34:34] young believer laid dying
[1:34:37] and his mother turned to him and said,
[1:34:39] "Son, is Jesus with you in that dark
[1:34:43] valley?"
[1:34:45] He said, "What dark [screaming] valley?
[1:34:48] It's not dark. It's bright and it's
[1:34:51] getting [screaming] brighter and
[1:34:52] brighter and brighter. Oh, mother, it's
[1:34:56] so bright now. I've got to shut my
[1:34:58] eyes." And he shut them and went to be
[1:35:02] with the Lord. Ah, friends, as in life,
[1:35:07] so in death, God's promises are sure.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. He that followeth me shall not
[1:35:15] walk in darkness, [screaming]
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; but he shall have the light of life.
[1:35:19] John 8:12.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; Oh my, what of your future? What of your
[1:35:25] future? Amen. What I tell you, what lies
[1:35:28] ahead for you? What lies ahead for me?
[1:35:31] Praise God. Ask yourself that. Praise
[1:35:34] God. You don't deceive yourself. You
[1:35:37] know, Bible talks about being deceiving
[1:35:39] yourself or fooling yourself that you're
[1:35:42] okay. You don't need to listen to this
[1:35:44] preacher. You don't need to listen to
[1:35:45] your mother. You don't listen need to
[1:35:47] listen to your father. You just go on
[1:35:49] and live your life and have a happy
[1:35:52] wonderful time uh uh like that. Amen.
[1:35:56] But I tell you friends, the for the
[1:35:59] world, the future is bleak.
[1:36:04] The the the the future for this world is
[1:36:06] dark.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; It's bleak, my friends. Let me tell you
[1:36:10] friends, I can see the storm clouds of
[1:36:13] the oncoming storms [screaming] are
[1:36:15] gathering right now.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; And it's terrible for them. Amen. But
[1:36:20] for the Christian, it's bright. The sun
[1:36:23] is up. It's the rising of the sun. We're
[1:36:26] watching for the coming of that great
[1:36:28] day. Amen. That great hour, that great
[1:36:31] moment. And the power of the Holy Spirit
[1:36:34] is already preparing us for that going
[1:36:36] away.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Do you love him?
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; I love him.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I love him.
[1:36:49] I love him
[1:36:52] because
[1:36:53] he first loved me.
[1:36:57] and per chest my salvation
[1:37:04] all cal
[1:37:09] three.
[1:37:10] Now [clears throat] there are three
[1:37:11] things we must live in anticipation
[1:37:15] um for in going to heaven and that we're
[1:37:18] going to see and experience. First, the
[1:37:22] scripture says, "Then we shall see the
[1:37:26] king in his great beauty,
[1:37:30] and we're going to be like him."
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Listen, because we are in
[1:37:34] the flesh, you think you see Jesus, you
[1:37:38] can't see him clearly now because now we
[1:37:40] see through a glass darkly.
[1:37:43] But then you will see the king in his
[1:37:45] great beauty
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; because then your eyes [screaming] will
[1:37:49] be completely clean and clear.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. Amen. Praise
[1:37:56] God. Because your body is going to be
[1:37:58] changed
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; and you're going into a new body.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Don't let that sound mysterious. The
[1:38:03] body change. It's just a change of body.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Is that right? No, don't the
[1:38:09] explanations of, you know, of the
[1:38:12] translation and the end morphing and all
[1:38:15] of that. I'm not talking about that.
[1:38:17] Somebody else will do that. But we're
[1:38:18] just talking the change of your body is
[1:38:22] being changed to a new body.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; Leaving a flesh body and entering into
[1:38:27] your theophony body
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; which you bypassed. Amen. Being a part
[1:38:33] of the original log ghost. And when you
[1:38:36] came off from that as it illustrated on
[1:38:38] the day of Pentecost with pieces of
[1:38:41] flame going to each apostle um
[1:38:44] [clears throat] that we are going to
[1:38:46] meet that body. He says you see Jesus
[1:38:49] went he came with that. So that's why he
[1:38:52] could be the way he is but you are now
[1:38:54] going to that. Praise the name of the
[1:38:56] Lord. You're going to be changed from
[1:38:58] this to that by the grace of God. Isaiah
[1:39:02] says 33:17,
[1:39:05] "Thine eyes shall see the king in his
[1:39:08] beauty."
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; First Corinthians
[1:39:12] uh 13 12, for now we see through a glass
[1:39:17] darkly, but then we shall see face to
[1:39:21] face.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Praise God. Face to face
[1:39:26] will I behold him far beyond the starry
[1:39:29] sky. Face to face in all his beauty. I
[1:39:33] shall see him by and by. Praise God. 1
[1:39:38] John 3:2 says, "Beloved, now are you the
[1:39:42] sons of God. It does not yet appear what
[1:39:46] you shall be." Praise God. Look at us
[1:39:49] now. It don't yet appear. In other
[1:39:51] words, it's not showing yet. This is
[1:39:53] what John is saying. You're alive and
[1:39:55] it's not showing as yet. Praise the
[1:39:57] Lord. my but when uh when he shall
[1:40:01] appear we shall be like him for we shall
[1:40:06] see him as he is praise God hallelujah
[1:40:11] everyone is going to be changed praise
[1:40:13] the name of the Lord then we won't have
[1:40:15] to worry is God a Chinese
[1:40:20] is God Jamaican
[1:40:23] is God German
[1:40:27] I can go down the list. But the the
[1:40:30] Jamaican could say God is a Jamaican.
[1:40:32] Because you remember he told Abraham uh
[1:40:35] Sarah, go and kill a kid, a goat kid.
[1:40:38] [laughter]
[1:40:39] So God has to be a Jamaican because he
[1:40:42] was eating a young goat. [laughter]
[1:40:51] Oh. Oh my. And next one says, "Oh, uh,
[1:40:56] no. God is God can't be Jamaican. God
[1:41:00] God is actually Chinese,
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; right? Because you know, remember when
[1:41:07] uh I think it was uh Jacob there and he
[1:41:11] kind of the angel struck him on the
[1:41:13] thigh. He came back and he and you know
[1:41:17] Bible says his name was Limping.
[1:41:24] So God have a sense of humor. God must
[1:41:27] be Chinese.
[1:41:30] [laughter]
[1:41:32] You know, but God is not Chinese. He's
[1:41:34] not Jamaican. He's not German. He's not
[1:41:37] African. He's not Indian. Whatever. God
[1:41:42] is God. And he appeals to every race.
[1:41:45] All come out of him. He says he is the
[1:41:48] father of all nations. [screaming]
[1:41:50] come right out of him. Praise the name
[1:41:52] of the Lord. We give God praise.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Let's praise the Lord.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause]
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; You know, a certain boy was born blind.
[1:42:05] It's a terrible thing for us to be born
[1:42:07] blind. But if you think carefully, every
[1:42:09] one of us born blind. Born spiritually
[1:42:12] blind. Not physically, but you're born
[1:42:14] spiritually blind to the things of God
[1:42:17] and the supernatural events that takes
[1:42:20] place right in front of you sometimes
[1:42:22] and you don't even see it. You don't
[1:42:24] even recognize it. This man was boy was
[1:42:27] born blind and a surgeon operated
[1:42:30] successfully on his eyes. Praise God.
[1:42:33] I'm thinking of a brother that just had
[1:42:36] some surgery on his eyes and he's now
[1:42:39] recovering. And right now I pray that
[1:42:41] the Holy Spirit will go and touch him
[1:42:44] and bring him successfully through so
[1:42:46] that his vision will be clear and that
[1:42:49] he will be able to read and see clearly
[1:42:52] and fellowship fully once again for the
[1:42:54] glory of God. Do you believe that
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:42:58] forever in the simplicity of the moment.
[1:43:00] God works his marvelous ways. Amen.
[1:43:03] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. And so we
[1:43:06] see that um for weeks the boy's eyes
[1:43:10] were covered with bandages,
[1:43:13] covered over with bandages. And uh you
[1:43:17] know at the same as the time neared,
[1:43:20] they started taking off the bandages.
[1:43:22] And then one of the nurses asked him
[1:43:25] say, "Well, tomorrow we're going to have
[1:43:27] to take off the final bandage. And when
[1:43:30] we do remove it from your eyes, whom do
[1:43:33] you want to see first of all? Your
[1:43:36] mother, your dad, who do you want to see
[1:43:40] first of all? And the boy said without
[1:43:42] any hesitation.
[1:43:44] I want to first of all to see the doctor
[1:43:48] that gave me back my sight. Is that
[1:43:51] right?
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; And I want to say the same thing.
[1:43:55] I want [screaming] to give praise to the
[1:43:58] doctor that gave me back my sight
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; because spiritually I was blind but
[1:44:04] thank God now I can see the word. I can
[1:44:08] see the revelation that's in the word of
[1:44:11] God. Hallelujah. Amen. Don't tell me
[1:44:14] about this or that but let my keep my
[1:44:16] eyes on Jesus. Amen.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:44:21] Yes, sir. Job said, "I know that my
[1:44:26] redeemer liveth."
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he'll stand on the earth in
[1:44:30] the last days. Praise the name of the
[1:44:33] Lord. Praise God forever more.
[1:44:35] Hallelujah. Yes, sir. He's not because I
[1:44:38] tell you friends, what a time this.
[1:44:42] Forgive me if my mind is going this way
[1:44:45] and that way. I'm seeing a lot of
[1:44:46] things, but I just want to keep one line
[1:44:49] here. uh a choir was singing Handel's
[1:44:51] Messiah and singing some other songs and
[1:44:54] the the [clears throat] maestro stopped
[1:44:57] the the soprano that was singing.
[1:45:01] She was singing I know my redeemer
[1:45:04] liveth.
[1:45:06] I know my redeemer liveth and striking
[1:45:10] the right notes carrying it out
[1:45:12] perfectly like that. But the maestro
[1:45:16] stopped her and said, "Do you really
[1:45:19] know that your redeemer lives?
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Do you really know it?"
[1:45:26] Oh my God. He said, she said, "Yes, sir,
[1:45:29] I do." He said, "Then if you know it,
[1:45:32] sing it like you know it and tell me so
[1:45:36] that I too will begin to know it.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; That your [screaming] redeemer really
[1:45:42] lives." go back and sing again.
[1:45:45] Hallelujah. Oh my my my my. You see? And
[1:45:50] so she went back and began to sing it
[1:45:52] again. And it had them all spellbound.
[1:45:57] That my struck came to her at the end of
[1:46:00] that with tears in his eyes and said,
[1:46:04] "Now I know that you know and you have
[1:46:08] just told me so." Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:46:13] Hallelujah. [screaming]
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; What am I saying? Let's not come up here
[1:46:18] just to entertain.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; Let's [screaming] not come and stand on
[1:46:23] this platform uh just to sing.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; We come to church to sing a few hymns.
[1:46:30] My friends, we ought to come and sing
[1:46:33] within our hearts and tears within our
[1:46:35] eyes
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; because we are feeling what we are
[1:46:39] singing about. We're not just singing
[1:46:41] and singing a song of some imaginary
[1:46:45] something, but we are experiencing it in
[1:46:47] our lives. What he has done for us.
[1:46:50] Amen.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; Many of you experience that sometimes
[1:46:53] you're reading brother Brandham and you
[1:46:55] hit a certain spot, you can't help it
[1:46:58] before you know it. The the front of
[1:47:00] your shirt or your blouse is wet because
[1:47:03] the tears are streaming down because of
[1:47:05] the love of God that is within your
[1:47:07] heart. Something strikes you. Amen.
[1:47:10] Warms your [screaming] heart because you
[1:47:12] know it's real. Praise God. All your
[1:47:14] doubts are settled and you know that
[1:47:17] it's real within your heart.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God forever more. Yes, sir.
[1:47:22] Hallelujah. Yes, sir. I tell you, let's
[1:47:26] preach it.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; Preachers, let's preach it.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; If you're praying, pray [screaming] it
[1:47:32] like you mean it within your heart.
[1:47:34] Amen. We're not some sick saply and sad
[1:47:38] ducklings
[1:47:39] hopping around not knowing what we're
[1:47:41] doing, but we are people that have been
[1:47:43] quickened by the Holy Spirit.
[1:47:46] [screaming]
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; Anointed by the word and prepared for
[1:47:48] this moment. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:47:52] Yes, sir. Praise God. I think it's
[1:47:55] brother Brandham that spoke.
[1:47:58] If I can find a quote, but I don't like
[1:48:00] stopping to find quotes. It's there.
[1:48:02] Praise the Lord. He says a certain slave
[1:48:06] working on a plantation and somehow
[1:48:10] through the the church was going on and
[1:48:14] they were not just allowed to go into
[1:48:16] any church like that but you can hear
[1:48:19] the preaching while picking the cotton
[1:48:22] and he got converted
[1:48:25] and
[1:48:27] uh he told the master that he was
[1:48:29] converted
[1:48:30] and the master said that's wonderful.
[1:48:33] ful to know that you're converted. And
[1:48:36] because the master was a Christian, they
[1:48:39] they they still had the relationship of
[1:48:41] master slave, but they had a better
[1:48:44] relationship, right? And they were going
[1:48:46] on like that. And it just so happens,
[1:48:49] brother Brandham tells the story. He was
[1:48:51] about to die. And while he was there
[1:48:54] dying,
[1:48:56] uh, he says, um, an angel
[1:49:02] is calling me for my crown.
[1:49:05] He says, but I just told him,
[1:49:09] don't tell me about no crown. Don't tell
[1:49:12] me about a crown. All I want to do is to
[1:49:16] see Jesus.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; Is that right,
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; my friends? In the book of Revelation,
[1:49:23] it says the 24 elders cast down their
[1:49:25] golden crowns before the throne of God.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; Cast down your ambitions.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; You can plaster the wall with diplomas.
[1:49:34] They're good for worldly existence,
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; but cast them down in the presence of
[1:49:39] God.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "I come to them all dung and
[1:49:42] ash in the presence of almighty God."
[1:49:46] Amen. Praise God. and let God receive
[1:49:49] all the praise, the honor and the glory.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the God. Uh let the Holy
[1:49:55] Spirit speak to you beyond what I'm
[1:49:56] saying with voice and with words uh like
[1:50:00] that. Praise God. Hallelujah. Yes, sir.
[1:50:03] He says, "My I'll see Jesus only." Oh
[1:50:06] my. Praise God. What a day that will be
[1:50:12] when my Jesus I shall see.
[1:50:16] When I look upon his face, the one who
[1:50:21] saved me by his grace.
[1:50:25] When he takes me by the hand and leads
[1:50:29] me to the promised land, what a day,
[1:50:35] glorious day
[1:50:38] that will be. Yes, brothers, we will see
[1:50:42] our savior, but we will also see our
[1:50:45] loved ones again.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; We'll see our loved ones again.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; That is why he says, don't you uh behave
[1:50:54] like the unbelievers do like you're
[1:50:57] never going to meet them again. We'll
[1:50:59] meet them again.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; We'll see them again by the grace of
[1:51:03] God. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Praise God.
[1:51:07] Hallelujah. Let listen. I can't uh go
[1:51:10] through beyond the curtain of time, but
[1:51:13] I can just tell you about it. Praise
[1:51:15] God. Where this is the old booklet. Uh
[1:51:19] but anyway, when he talks about being
[1:51:21] caught up into heaven
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; and when the crowds came out and began
[1:51:26] hugging him and our precious brother,
[1:51:28] our precious brother and began talking
[1:51:30] to him, he says, "And they were just
[1:51:34] human and I can feel them just as much
[1:51:37] as you are here right here today. Heaven
[1:51:40] is real. [screaming]
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; It's not some religious fantasy somebody
[1:51:45] made up to get you to believe that." No,
[1:51:48] but it's [screaming] real. Praise God.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; My God. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:51:53] Hallelujah. Amen. Yes, sir. I tell you
[1:51:56] friends, he's the same yesterday. And we
[1:51:59] shall see him for the Bible says the
[1:52:02] Lord himself shall descend with a shout.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; We're not going into the doctrinal or
[1:52:08] the theological part of that. Amen. But
[1:52:10] the Lord himself has descended with a
[1:52:12] shout.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; Voice of the archangel, the trump of
[1:52:15] God. Amen. Yes, sir. And some of the
[1:52:19] saints already have gone, but we who are
[1:52:22] alive and remain while you remain.
[1:52:27] Praise God. And the you'll be caught up.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'll preach on that
[1:52:33] another time. You got to catch up before
[1:52:37] you can be caught up.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because friends,
[1:52:43] it's telling you they're playing. You're
[1:52:45] going to be alive and you're going to
[1:52:46] start being caught up. While you're
[1:52:48] alive, you're going to be caught up.
[1:52:51] You're going to be alive and you're
[1:52:52] going to be changed. But you see, if
[1:52:54] you're going by feelings, you're going
[1:52:56] to feel nothing. Yeah. You're just going
[1:52:58] to be changed. It's all going to happen.
[1:53:00] Not just the end part of it where it
[1:53:02] says in the twinkling of an eye. But the
[1:53:04] change already started. By the time that
[1:53:06] hits, the whole thing is done. Total
[1:53:09] deliverance.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; You're delivered out of this. And you
[1:53:12] enter into that by the grace of God.
[1:53:15] Hallelujah. Praise God. We're gonna see
[1:53:17] them just like the prophets saw them.
[1:53:20] Amen. And not only we going to see them,
[1:53:22] we're going to know them.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; Cuz remember Peter, James, and John saw
[1:53:28] Elijah and Moses
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; and they knew them.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; But they never met them.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; They never met them. But the moment they
[1:53:37] saw them with Jesus, they knew who they
[1:53:40] were. We are going to know [screaming]
[1:53:42] as we are known.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; We will recognize them because they are
[1:53:46] part of the same word.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; So they're going to know you and you're
[1:53:50] going to know them because we all one in
[1:53:53] the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[1:53:56] Hallelujah. Praise God. Now a certain
[1:54:00] Christian doctor died
[1:54:03] and his wife of course loved him very
[1:54:06] very much
[1:54:09] and you know she being a believer
[1:54:14] and knowing that she would meet uh with
[1:54:17] him her loved one again
[1:54:20] she took the old wooden sign
[1:54:24] that he would have
[1:54:27] right outside of his door of his office,
[1:54:30] his business that he had there, and she
[1:54:33] put it in the living room so that she
[1:54:36] could look at it every day and remember
[1:54:39] him. And the sign said, "Doctor gone
[1:54:44] out, be back soon."
[1:54:48] Is that right? And that's exactly what
[1:54:50] it is with us
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; as Christians and believers because when
[1:54:55] we come riding with Jesus back, him and
[1:54:58] his bride rides back down. Amen. Uh the
[1:55:02] white horse rider riding back, we come
[1:55:05] back to earth again with him. Praise the
[1:55:08] name of the Lord. Yes, friends, that's
[1:55:10] the way it is. All debt is to a
[1:55:13] Christian is they're gone out, but
[1:55:16] they're back soon by the grace of God.
[1:55:19] Hallelujah. I absolutely believe it.
[1:55:23] Amen. Praise God. Now uh it just so
[1:55:27] happens that the scripture says blessed
[1:55:32] uh the song says blessed hope that in
[1:55:35] Jesus is given
[1:55:37] in our sorrow and joy to sustain that
[1:55:41] soon our with our savior in heaven we
[1:55:45] shall meet with our loved ones again.
[1:55:49] Blessed hope, blessed hope,
[1:55:53] blessed hope, we shall meet with our
[1:55:56] loved ones again. Blessed hope in the
[1:55:58] word God has spoken,
[1:56:02] all our peace by that word we obtain.
[1:56:07] And as sure as God's word was never
[1:56:10] broken, we shall meet with our loved
[1:56:14] ones again.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. No matter how long they're gone,
[1:56:18] we're going to meet them again. Praise
[1:56:20] the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. So
[1:56:23] don't be like those who have no hope and
[1:56:25] grieving for the rest of your life,
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; like you'll never ever see them again.
[1:56:29] We'll meet them again
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; by God's grace. For the hour is coming,
[1:56:34] and now is, which all that are in the
[1:56:37] graves shall hear his voice, and shall
[1:56:40] come forth and have that have done good
[1:56:45] that have done good into the
[1:56:48] resurrection of life. Amen. We're coming
[1:56:51] into the resurrection of life. Is that
[1:56:54] right?
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; We are partaking of it now.
[1:56:58] Resurrection of life now. But the actual
[1:57:01] literal if you pass then you will
[1:57:04] partake of it then. Now another doctor
[1:57:08] died.
[1:57:10] His office used to be above a
[1:57:13] storefront. You know what's a storefront
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; and sometimes they have offices above
[1:57:19] and so he had a sign that was downstairs
[1:57:23] to point the people that his office was
[1:57:26] upstairs.
[1:57:28] So, um, they took the sign that he had
[1:57:31] downstairs and put it on his headstone.
[1:57:35] And the headstone read, "Doctor's office
[1:57:39] now upstairs."
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; Friends,
[1:57:49] God's word will never be broken.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; You may be gone from this world. They
[1:57:55] can't see you anymore. Paul said, "We
[1:57:58] are encompassed with a crowd of
[1:58:00] witnesses." What's he talking about?
[1:58:02] They're gone before. They can see us,
[1:58:04] but we can't see them. Praise God.
[1:58:07] Hallelujah. But we are encompassed with
[1:58:09] them by the grace of God. Hallelujah.
[1:58:13] When he calls his sheep, he said they
[1:58:15] will answer because I call them by their
[1:58:18] names. Praise God. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:58:22] Yes, sir. Blessed uh he'll call all the
[1:58:25] blessed dead by name and all that
[1:58:28] trusted in him. Praise God. And I
[1:58:31] believe God is calling his last sheep
[1:58:34] now.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; The hour is late and he's calling his
[1:58:40] last sheep now. Let's give heed to the
[1:58:43] word of God, to the voice of God, and
[1:58:47] answer the shepherd's call. Amen. Our
[1:58:50] great shepherd King is with us. the Holy
[1:58:53] Spirit and he's calling his children
[1:58:56] back to attention of his word. Are you
[1:58:59] ready to meet him?
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; Even if you're a believer, I'm asking a
[1:59:05] question.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; If you're unbeliever, a makeeliever, a
[1:59:09] churchgoer,
[1:59:11] are you ready to meet him? Are you
[1:59:14] really ready?
[1:59:16] You know, you say, "Yes, yeah, yeah, I'm
[1:59:17] ready." Yeah, but sometimes that's just
[1:59:20] uh fluff and fraught on a beer. Then you
[1:59:23] just move away like that. But when it
[1:59:25] comes from inside your heart, I'm ready.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; I'm ready to meet him in life. I'm ready
[1:59:32] to meet him in death. Praise God. I hope
[1:59:36] my friends when he calls that you will
[1:59:38] be somewhere listening for your name.
[1:59:43] Amen.
[1:59:44] Because we can anticipate rest from our
[1:59:48] labors.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's perfect rest beyond the
[1:59:53] river. Hallelujah.
[1:59:56] Oh my.
[1:59:58] After God finished his work in Genesis,
[2:00:01] he rested.
[2:00:03] After we finish our work, we're going to
[2:00:06] rest. We have already entered the
[2:00:09] believer's rest with the opening of the
[2:00:12] word taking away our doubts and affairs.
[2:00:15] The supernatural Sabbath has started
[2:00:18] within our hearts. But we going to be
[2:00:20] entering into a complete atmosphere of
[2:00:22] total rest, sinlessness. There is no
[2:00:26] temptation. No devil there. So there's
[2:00:28] no temptation. There's no nothing. You
[2:00:32] are free in the presence of God. You've
[2:00:34] entered into the final rest of God's
[2:00:38] people. Amen. Because you fulfill God's
[2:00:41] purpose while you're here on earth.
[2:00:44] Amen. What it is, fulfill his purpose,
[2:00:47] whatever that is. Praise God. So,
[2:00:50] there's going to be rest beyond the
[2:00:52] river.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; Rest for your for your body. Amen. Rest
[2:00:56] from work.
[2:00:58] Don't start resting now if you're still
[2:01:00] young.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when you get older, you can
[2:01:04] start talk about rest, but you're young,
[2:01:07] but you've got to work. But rest beyond
[2:01:11] the river, physical work. Your body is
[2:01:14] going to go through pain. So, you're
[2:01:16] going to want rest beyond the river.
[2:01:20] Tiredness. Sometimes you drag yourself
[2:01:23] home. You're so tired. Some of us, thank
[2:01:26] God, if you have one job and it's well
[2:01:28] paid and fine, you can try to make out
[2:01:31] other people. two jobs, some three jobs.
[2:01:36] They can hardly rest. They just got to
[2:01:39] work, work, work, work. Working all the
[2:01:43] time, day and night. Hardly any sleep
[2:01:46] whatsoever.
[2:01:47] My God. Weary in their body. Amen. And
[2:01:52] then also sometimes they in secret. They
[2:01:55] won't tell nobody. The tears come down.
[2:01:58] What am I going to do? How am I going to
[2:02:01] take care of this? How am I going to
[2:02:02] take care of these children? How am I
[2:02:04] going to take care of my home? Their
[2:02:07] body, physical body being worn out,
[2:02:12] tormented,
[2:02:13] troubled, tried and tested. Other people
[2:02:18] are looking forward to rest.
[2:02:21] Rested in their mind because their minds
[2:02:25] were constantly worried.
[2:02:28] worried. What am I going to wear? How am
[2:02:31] I going to pay my rent? How am I going
[2:02:33] to look after my car? How this? And then
[2:02:36] you may have some families phoning you
[2:02:38] and asking you to help for help. Uh and
[2:02:42] you can hardly help yourself, but
[2:02:43] they're asking you for help. And so
[2:02:45] therefore, you find yourself in that
[2:02:47] situation. Maybe you are not in it, but
[2:02:50] somebody else may be in it in that kind
[2:02:52] of a situation like that. And a life
[2:02:56] full of troubles.
[2:02:59] Oh my
[2:03:01] I I I once was in a state like that
[2:03:04] where it's like Job's messengers
[2:03:07] following you.
[2:03:09] You get one trouble and you think it's
[2:03:11] come to an end. Another trouble, another
[2:03:13] trouble, another trouble. It's like you
[2:03:14] have a whole life full of troubles
[2:03:17] coming after you one after the other.
[2:03:19] It's the devil testing you. It's the
[2:03:21] devil trying you like he tried Job also.
[2:03:24] Amen. And then he's nervousness
[2:03:28] and nervous breakdowns and all that
[2:03:30] stuff like that on your mind. And then
[2:03:33] uh your soul, the devil going to attack
[2:03:35] that too as a Christian with lies, with
[2:03:39] lust, with all kinds of problems. He
[2:03:42] come to you with sin. Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:03:46] Uh my friends, maybe you didn't have it
[2:03:48] easy in life. I didn't have it easy in
[2:03:51] life either. Amen. You face troubles.
[2:03:55] You face trials. You face trespasses.
[2:03:58] You face tribulations all within your
[2:04:01] life. You face uh a broken heart.
[2:04:06] Amen. I know you're not going to say
[2:04:08] amen to give yourself away [panting]
[2:04:12] because that's an inside thing. So we we
[2:04:16] get but we do have broken hearts.
[2:04:19] Amen. uh heartaches and sometimes
[2:04:24] uh used and abused
[2:04:28] uh misused uh like that. But remember
[2:04:32] after all this is over there'll be rest
[2:04:35] beyond the river.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; And now talk to a few ministers whether
[2:04:41] here or in the land of the internet.
[2:04:46] Maybe you live for the gospel. It could
[2:04:49] be a believer. Maybe you labored for the
[2:04:52] gospel your lifetime with no notoriety,
[2:04:56] no notice, nobody ever realizing
[2:05:00] how much you sold out your life as a
[2:05:03] prisoner to Christ
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; and had rough times. Paul had rough
[2:05:10] times, too. I seen the prison in Rome
[2:05:14] that they held him in. Dark and damp. Oh
[2:05:18] my. And rough stone like in that he had
[2:05:22] scars in his body from stoning
[2:05:26] claw marks. He says from the beasts at
[2:05:29] Ephesus.
[2:05:30] Body weary
[2:05:32] having only one cloak. You stop and
[2:05:35] think the life of some of these
[2:05:37] prophets. You realize that Elijah only
[2:05:39] had one suit.
[2:05:41] All well and good. It was a camel hair
[2:05:43] suit. [laughter]
[2:05:46] But it was one suit. Can you imagine how
[2:05:49] he smelt and then he has to go and talk
[2:05:51] to those people? They they don't want to
[2:05:52] hear him because people look at those
[2:05:55] things, how you appear and how you look
[2:05:57] rather than what you're saying. And they
[2:05:59] they make comments about this or that.
[2:06:01] Your socks, your tie, your whatever. And
[2:06:04] the devil use anything to distract you
[2:06:06] from the word instead of listening to a
[2:06:09] voice that's coming forth that you can
[2:06:11] receive something for your soul. Amen.
[2:06:14] But Paul went through all that. But he
[2:06:17] was anticipating heaven so much that he
[2:06:19] said, "But I am still persuaded that he
[2:06:22] is able [screaming] to keep that which I
[2:06:25] have committed unto him against that
[2:06:28] day."
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Just give me a little
[2:06:31] more time. Is that okay?
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; Praise. If you want to sleep, sleep
[2:06:34] right where you are.
[2:06:38] Just my voice is still going to come
[2:06:39] through to you. Not from the sound of
[2:06:41] it, but it's going to come through to
[2:06:43] you. Amen. Yes, sir. Praise God. He was
[2:06:47] finding rest. Praise God.
[2:06:50] Maybe some of you have lived your life
[2:06:53] raising your family
[2:06:56] and you lived a rough life, passed
[2:06:59] through some really rough times raising
[2:07:02] your family, giving your life's blood.
[2:07:05] Literally sometimes giving your life's
[2:07:08] blood. Coming home from work with your
[2:07:10] hands bruised and bloody. Amen.
[2:07:14] Oh my
[2:07:16] work,
[2:07:18] laboring day after day after day,
[2:07:22] going out early in the morning, snow
[2:07:26] flying all around the place, dark and
[2:07:29] you have to leave and go out to work,
[2:07:31] come back home late in the night, and
[2:07:35] the cycle continues. just get a little
[2:07:37] bit of rest back out to work and on and
[2:07:40] on like that. Amen. But let me tell you,
[2:07:45] God sees it and he knows all about it.
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; And one day, he's going to repay you and
[2:07:51] there's going to be rest beyond the
[2:07:54] river.
[2:07:56] One time, Dr. George Truit met a
[2:08:00] believing uh widow that was working to
[2:08:04] earn her living. husband died. She had
[2:08:07] her children
[2:08:09] and hands rough and gnarled.
[2:08:13] And he said to her, "Sister, what does
[2:08:16] heaven mean to you?" She says, "Pastor,
[2:08:20] heaven means to me, rest.
[2:08:24] I can rest now from those labors."
[2:08:28] Oh my. I tell you friends, you may have
[2:08:31] spent your life bearing other people's
[2:08:33] burdens.
[2:08:35] I I'm talking like this because it
[2:08:37] becomes emotional. I know my parents,
[2:08:41] they weren't members of any church, but
[2:08:43] they read their Bibles. They prayed.
[2:08:46] They taught us to read the Bible,
[2:08:48] memorize the Bible, and to pray. But yet
[2:08:51] they will cook, bake, and take breads,
[2:08:57] cakes,
[2:08:58] food
[2:09:00] to the people that were needy up the
[2:09:03] street, down the street, across the
[2:09:05] town. They'll find out and they'll just
[2:09:08] keep doing that all the time. But what
[2:09:10] do you get from that? Nothing. They
[2:09:12] didn't care. They just did it by the
[2:09:14] grace of God. And so uh you may uh spend
[2:09:19] your life bearing other people's burden
[2:09:21] and bearing other people's heartaches.
[2:09:24] You might be the kind of person that
[2:09:26] people will come to and sometimes tell
[2:09:28] their troublesh
[2:09:30] if you can solve their problem. But
[2:09:33] really it's not that they seeing
[2:09:34] something in you and that's why they
[2:09:37] came to you. Praise the name of the
[2:09:38] Lord. Don't worry about your physical
[2:09:40] body getting weary now while I'm
[2:09:42] talking. Right? is you know that that's
[2:09:46] human but let the Holy Spirit speak with
[2:09:48] your soul uh and and give you what you
[2:09:51] need. You may never hear this again like
[2:09:53] this. So receive it in the name of the
[2:09:56] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Praise the
[2:09:59] Lord. Sometime God wants us to bear the
[2:10:02] infirmities of the weak.
[2:10:04] Amen. Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:10:07] Hallelujah. Now u all these things you
[2:10:10] know uh they took care of people until
[2:10:13] the day they died
[2:10:16] like numberless people I can think of
[2:10:18] that come offering them their property
[2:10:21] I'll sign the deed the the children are
[2:10:24] not around the children don't want
[2:10:25] nothing to do with them they said no we
[2:10:28] are not doing it for that we're doing it
[2:10:30] for Jesus sake we're doing it for the
[2:10:33] Lord's sake amen praise God well people
[2:10:37] thought They were foolish. But in my
[2:10:39] eyes, they were not foolish. They were
[2:10:42] children of the living God. And they
[2:10:44] believed it with all their hearts.
[2:10:47] Praise the name of the Lord. Praise God.
[2:10:49] Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Praise God. Listen
[2:10:53] what the scripture says in the great
[2:10:56] book of Revelation. Hallelujah. Now it
[2:11:02] says here in the book of Revelation,
[2:11:04] "And I heard a voice from heaven,
[2:11:06] saying, blessed are the dead which die
[2:11:09] in the Lord. Yay, sayeth the spirit,
[2:11:12] that they may rest from their labors,
[2:11:15] and their works do follow them." Let me
[2:11:19] tell you, any little thing you do for
[2:11:21] the Lord,
[2:11:23] men may forget, but God won't forget.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Your works will follow you. Good
[2:11:31] or bad, your works is going to follow
[2:11:34] you. And he will he will reward you for
[2:11:37] everything that you do for his glory.
[2:11:41] Amen. Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:11:43] Hallelujah. Now, I think I'm going to
[2:11:46] wind this up here. I'm not finished, but
[2:11:48] I'll wind it up here because I can feel
[2:11:51] your spirits getting weak and weary and
[2:11:55] tired.
[2:11:57] And we all want to get out of here,
[2:11:59] don't we? Nobody wants to answer.
[2:12:02] Everybody wants to go to heaven. Nobody
[2:12:05] wants to die. Everybody wants to have
[2:12:07] lunch, but nobody want to admit it.
[2:12:12] [laughter]
[2:12:13] Amen. Well, every speaker needs to know
[2:12:16] that is, you know, you you can you feel
[2:12:19] the sense uh the people and where
[2:12:21] they're at and when it's time for you to
[2:12:23] stop, you need to stop, right? And you
[2:12:26] take it from there. But what I I want to
[2:12:28] close with this thought,
[2:12:32] you need to anticipate heaven. Some
[2:12:35] people don't want to anticipate it
[2:12:36] because to leave here and go there is
[2:12:38] judgment.
[2:12:40] others to leave here and go there. It's
[2:12:43] the blessing of God.
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; So we are anxious. It doesn't bother us.
[2:12:48] But if you are here and you have any
[2:12:49] doubt, may the Holy Spirit speak to you.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; Get born again. Get baptized in water
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; the right way in the name of the Lord
[2:13:00] Jesus Christ.
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; Come to him now while there is yet time
[2:13:04] to come. While the train is coming in
[2:13:07] the station, get ready to get on board.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; And let the Holy Spirit take you all the
[2:13:13] way through.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; This train is bound for glory.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; And I believe I'm part of the train.
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads in prayer. Praise
[2:13:24] the name of the Lord. Our gracious
[2:13:26] heavenly father, we thank you for these
[2:13:28] wonderful people in front of you. And
[2:13:32] Lord, I pray you'll bless them everyone.
[2:13:35] Some of them are here today with some
[2:13:39] trouble and trial in their life, some
[2:13:43] need to be met. I simply ask, Father, in
[2:13:46] the name of Jesus, that their needs will
[2:13:49] be met for your glory and for your
[2:13:52] honor. Hallelujah. And Lord Jesus, I
[2:13:56] pray for those who are sick in their
[2:13:59] body
[2:14:00] that Lord, if they can believe it, if
[2:14:03] they can see themselves moving freely
[2:14:07] and briskly and healthily and joyfully
[2:14:11] in the spirit of Christ, then Lord, set
[2:14:14] them free. Oh God, I pray you'll heal
[2:14:18] the sick among us. You'll touch the mind
[2:14:21] of those who may be disturbed in the
[2:14:24] name of Jesus Christ. And Lord, those of
[2:14:28] us who feel guilty and ashamed, lift our
[2:14:32] shame, lift our guilt, give us peace,
[2:14:36] give us perfect rest, Father in thee,
[2:14:39] for I ask it in the name of the Lord
[2:14:41] Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. Do you
[2:14:46] know the song? This world is not my
[2:14:48] home.
[2:14:53] It's not my [singing] home.
