everyone believe anything like the from us father we are here Lord to come here with a with a confidence that you hear our prayers that you won't hold anything against us father we need your presence father my desire is not just to preach A good sermon but Lord you take my mouth and say one thing it doesn't matter how much shall be Mumble or anything but I want you to help that one word will come from you to help help somebody that's all my heart desire that somebody will be blessed tonight may you please take me aside and help me Lord so that your children will be blessed that they won't live here the same way they coming but they will leave you more revive and drawing Closer to You Lord that's all we are here for Lord to be drawn closer to you in Jesus name amen um okay as we have two scriptures um it's taken from John chapter 16 I think vers um 20- 24 and Revelation 197 if you got it say Amen John 6 okay Revelation 19:7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife had made herself ready John 162 to uh 24 verily I say unto you that ye shall have ye shall reap and lament but the world shall rejoice and he shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into Joy a woman when a woman when she's in travail has sorrow because the hour is come but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remembered no more the anguish for joy that a man is Born Into the world and ye now therefore have sorrow but I I will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh from you and in that day you shall ask me nothing very verily I say unto you whatsoever ye shall ask the father in my name he will give it to you in the last verse he have you asked nothing in my name ask and you shall receive that your joy may be full let's pray Heavenly Father please bless the reading of the word and bless our fellowship with you in Jesus name amen please be seated one thing that we have to be conscious of and aware is that anytime we come here I believe Jesus Christ is here before even get here because the prophet said that if you are the angel of the Lord if you keep consistent time he always going to be there before you you get there so we are not here to see one another we are not here for any other thing else but to Worship the Lord Jesus Christ amen that's our own purpose to be drawn closer to him to live here better than we came and in every sermon you get what you expect either you live here more closer to God or you live here more away from God it depends on what you expect and you get what you expect so as we read from Revelation 19 it says that the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife had made herself ready so the marriage take place if I'll title it I would say the bride or the wife had made herself ready that should be my title she has made herself ready amen that should be my T So as we read from John I'll come back to that title but as we read from John 16 he said a woman when she's in travil has sorrow but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remembered no more of the anguish for joy that a man is Born Into the world braam talk about it in birth pains that's how the world is now so when any woman is given birth during the time of the labor the intensity increases with time the pain increases with time so before the child comes he going to go through from certain levels it's going to go Papa until the the child comes so is our world now the world has had this first world war second world war and that destraction is been rampant because the first world war was different kind of missiles um bombs and thing but second world war they went more higher with atomic bomb and he destroy heroshima in hagaki in Japan and the third world going to be worse and the Bible said that he going to what get W going to have farming and and earthquake in various places so this world is not going to get better if you looking for a better on this Earth no it's the new world to come because it's giving that pressure is giving way for a new world to come and that world is the Lord Jesus Christ coming only he can have peace the Prince of Peace that is all is botom up to is preparing for his second coming you know the first the second coming has come already in 1963 when the SE were revealed but you looking for that time to what catch up the bright to meet us in the air and then we're coming back for three and a half years with those times after the tribulation time but what is happening that is that a lot of people has forgotten that scripture that said there's going to be fing there's going to be pestilence it's not going to to get better I believe that that's the reason why if you check after the co the co came all those Prime Ministers and the presidents in all the various countries majority of them when they went back to the second election most of them lost their seat why they lost the election because the people are thinking that it's getting worse so change of government will bring a better life for them that's what America they chose Trump for the second time because when he came for the first time they compared when he left and Biden came things are getting worse so they want to go back and have a better life but the Bible said he going to get works and work people had is not going to was also cold The Love Will was cold so it's is never going to get better and the pressure will keep on what mounting increasing and how we going to survive the Bible said let let your heart be trouble believe also in me if you believe in God so for the believer our faith our anchor is in the Lord Jesus Christ amen he we said that a th000 will fall on your left 10 will fall on the right it will not come near you only with your eyes will you see the what the reward of the wicked so you don't have to be worried about what is going on but it's never going to get better that one I can assure you that but it depends on where your confidence lies right whom are you trusting because a true bride of Christ your confidence is in the word of God your confidence is in God and we believe that he is the source of our supply and he supply all our needs amen so we are not looking at the economy because right now what are they doing with all this tariffs everything they doing is bringing the pressure economic pressure on the people people are losing their jobs in numbers they just started people are losing their jobs in numbers why it's a pressure on the people but he's everpresent help in times of trouble so all that we have to do is just rely on his word and that word of God will bring us through every condition no matter what how W it gets to the word of God will bring us out because our confidence is in that word and that word is greater than anything said the Heaven and Earth will pass away but God's word will not pass away all this birth place is going to let this Earth pass away but the word of God will still remain sure so our confidence is not in each other our confidence is in the word of the Living God he's the same yesterday today and for forever if he brought those Saints before us back when they were in trouble he going to bring us also back because it's the same God who was in Moses when he delivered the children of Israel from the hands of Egyptians when he came to a pharaoh who did not know Joseph and he was so mad and increased their labor and everything God raised up Moses and he delivered the children of Israel from the hand of that enemy and that same God is here with us doesn't matter how the pressure mou doesn't matter how wor it gets to that same God will deliver us and we are not going down we are going to be raptured to meet the Lord in the end amen that's our purpose that's the Fulfillment of the scripture for our day amen that one day we going to be raptured Hallelujah because we are not going to All Die amen we're going to be raptured me the Lord in the air amen he's the same yesterday today and forever amen so what has happening it's a pressure time it's a pressure time if you watch on the Friday 28th February that is when um 19 2025 those um alignment of those planets it aligned back back in 1963 and the same night that have that um ziny and Trump in the White House the big argument and Mr Trump is trying to be a peac man trying to have peace all over the world which he's trying his best to do to have peace that's what he is doing but there is never going to be a perfect peace until the Prince of Peace comes the Bible said when they said Peace PE then the sudden distraction will comes but if you watch zalinski stood on his ground that he will never sign for it unless they gave him security guaranteed and then after three couple of days they redrew all their help all their aid to Ukraine and this man had no choice than to sign the deal prepare to sign that deal um I'm not blaming the man though but I'm just saying that that's the way the enemy works we are going to face pressure upon pressure as time goes on so you have to be ready I have to be ready there's a part you and I have to do because it's going to be a time as our Prophet let us know they're going to put pressure on us either to give in to baptize the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost to take all their doctrines but we won't take it I'm going to read just one uh scripture here this thing here marriage of the lamb um paragraph 110 just to build up my point okay so what is it going to do is going to bring pressure so we have three pressures economic pressure religious pressure political pressure and religious pressure so all three will unite to be one and place on the people so when it comes to religious pressure because listen those churches he calls them that they have what Esau spirit and what did Esau did Esau sold his birth right when he has a famine when he was anger when he has no food to eat and that is what is even happening right now a lot of people because of pressure and because of fing because of financial difficulties they have chose to solve it by themselves by taking more hours at job taking two job taking three jobs thinking that they can solve it themselves but the Bible said that seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all other things shall be added what unto you so as the time is getting worse and pressure is mounting the desire of of the believer is to be draw more closer to Jesus Christ is they seek the kingdom of God let that power of God um sanctify yourself rededicate yourself let God take control he will take care of you he will supply all your needs you don't have to compromise because of famine you don't have to compromise because of pressure stand on the word of God and God will stand by you because the children of Israel the three Hebrew children they stood by the word of God and in time of trouble when it seems all was lost God was there to deliver them and that same God is here tonight it doesn't matter what you go through doesn't matter what I go through we shouldn't bite down to the enemy because we going to go and face troubles it's a trouble time time I here it's pressure for you to give up it's pressure for you to give up on the word of God that is what is happening but a true child of God will stand by the word of God Amen zeli couldn't stand all the way amen but the bride of Christ will stand all the way like when I spoke about the last couple of weeks but um I've decided to follow Jesus Christ if you listen to that song before it came that person that man when the Indian guy when the missionary brought that word to them and he accepted it the chief told him to recount and he said you not recount if you do not recount I'm going to kill your wife he never gave up I'm going to kill your children he let them kill their children I'm going to kill you he said kill me and he was killed but the man realized that there's a power behind that man that could stand firm for the word of God and he became a Christian so when your trial came when your persecution came stand by the word of God and God will stand by you there's no one who has stand by the word of God that God never stood for him there are so many people that gave up their life for this gospel that we are enjoying amen but when they gave up their their life for this gospel they went to a better place because here is not our home you are here for tomorrow we comeone tomorrow even if nothing happens how long are you going to be here for for by 90 95 go you can't do anything you can't even enjoy your food even after 50 go you can't even e certain type of food so what are you here for what are your purpose on this Earth our main purpose is to Worship the Lord Jesus Christ our main purpose is to be there for one another our main purpose is to pray for one another our main purpose is to make ourself ready amen so that when God wants to use us we'll be ready for the battle that's our purpose on this Earth amen that's what I believe Esther did yes sir amen she was ready Hallelujah in marriage sa of the lamp Okay paragraph 17 said God calls you as an individual and it's you that got to clean up because he's taking a people from Gentiles for his name's sake his bride the Gentile Esther cleaned herself she cleaned her heart that's what she cleaned that's what the church needs a heart cleaning how do you clean your heart BR Abraham wash by the water of the word through the blood of Jesus Christ amen ES urge herself her heart before God walk up with a Meek and a humble Spirit the church is going to be the bride of Christ now remember Esther refused the worldly Ador she took the spirit in her heart to go before the king amen hallelujah amen so what am I trying to say if you have have that Spirit of Esther in you you what clean your heart you make your heart ready you're going to prepare yourself your heart you going to reconsecrate yourself so that when God is ready to use you he'll use you there's no competition we not comparing ourself one to the another all that you have to do to be ready to be ready to be used of God Amen and God is not going to use us at the same time so you have to I have to be ready and let his perfect will to be done our former pastor always says that in the Bible you can read about somebody only one time and that's all God wants to use that person for just one minute just one time for that purpose so you maybe all that even God called you to do is to just play the drums that's all your purpose so prepare your heart come and play the drums no competition amen just make your heart right if God wants to use you he use you but your heart has to be right you have to be at the right place at the right time and when he wants to use you to raise the debt he use you to raise the debt he wants you to give money to somebody who let you to do it he plac it in different places offices different H ranks and people to be the rich people so that they can what present the word of God to them people some people you make them lower to reach the poor he makes some people he he makes everything beautiful in his own time so all I'm trying to say that you recognize why you are here your purpose on this Earth and Lord work towards that and let God use you for his own Glory and Honor make yourself ready so that he can use you because if you are not ready when the time comes he'll baptize you and use the next person because that's why John the God is able to raise what souls to raise children for for Abraham so you we need God more than he needs us so we have to make ourselves ready because it's an opportunity he has given to us amen so don't think that if I'm not there nobody can do that job and don't get into your head that I'm the only person doing it and this will happen this no God is able to raise up people like to do that all that he wants a willing heart you have to have a willing heart to do it everything you have to have to do with with your all your heart all your mind all your soul the Bible say you shall love the Lord with all your mind all your soul everything within you that's what you have to love the Lord of God with amen so don't leave anything undone yes you have to have a willing heart and through that God will bless you abundantly because he said that so that your joy May what may become full he wants to bless us more abundantly he said I'll do exceedingly more than what you can even think of or even ask he's God of abundance some he said that a little fish say I'm going to drink all the waters the ocean how can you drink all the water the ocean you cannot overflow or you cannot overflow you cannot restrict God abundance he's a god of abundance ask abundance so that your joy may become full the same God that heals you from headache he's able to heal you from cancer he's able to heal you from any kind of disease if thou can believe all things are possible there's no there's no like big sin or Big H big sickness or big it's everything comes from sin is unbelief so it's all from the Devil is that right so there's no like this sickness is small this sickness is Big so I can trust God for healing for the small sickness I can't trust him for the big sickness the same faith that God gave you to overcome the small sickness that same faith will overcome the big sickness it will overcome everything amen believe God have confidence in his word amen with faith all things are possible all things amen amen He's Able tonight even to raise the dead amen whatever you going through tonight if thou can believe God will answer it it's according to your faith not mine your faith tonight your desires said you give you the desires of your heart tonight what are you Desiring tonight for what is it in your heart God is able to bring it to pass don't look at the circumstances don't look to those uncircumcised Philistines amen h Moses said that those Egyptians you see see them no more amen no more see them no more God is able to do it he's an awesome God he's on time God Amen he's still on time you'll be there right on time whatever you're going through tonight just believe it keep it in your heart and trust God thank you Lord and he'll give you the desires of your heart because he's the same yesterday today and forever if he did it back down for them if he here he would do it again because the same God who created the whole universe he came the fullness was in Christ reconcile the world to himself and we are part of that God you are not the fullness but we are part so if you are part that whatever you need he Grant it to you he said that act so that your joy may become fool a child who cries constantly they get what they want hey if you you newborn baby you put computer there or whatever Gadget and tell her tell that child that when you're hungry ring that Gadget he won't go to lose that the only way that the child knows what he can get is cry like a thing like that they said whatever you do you have to stop and take get get attention to that child so what you have to do is to cry onto the Lord because listen you cannot put your trust in any human being oh yeah they will fail you they will disappoint you no human being can help you but the Lord Jesus Christ can help you so we have to cry onto him because you care for us even in this part of the country like maybe in Africa sometimes they go and they cry to this person oh give me this borrow me this money borrow me that and they'll give food or but I know here people does that but don't get me wrong here is you have to trust God because sometimes even the people that you are trying to depend on naturally they want to help you but they might not be in the position at that time to help you so our confidence has to be on God all the time yes because he will never fail us nor forsake us he promised I'll be with you even in you until what the consumation of the time so God that created the whole universe he's in you tonight he's in me tonight people are trying to look back to the the the great the calvary for the cross Look to Him they remember that he has put on a skin and he's walking on the AIS sitting on the aisle with a bhead somewhere over there head bhead but that God is hiding in in him amen because he's the same yesterday today for he's hiding in the in the heart of the people you God disguise himself and reveal himself when he chose to and the whole plan of God all this is based on what revelation of the word of God so the more God reveals himself to you the more everything becomes easier so but it's by grace and grace and grace alone you cannot work yourself into Revelation but the bride of Christ is now resting all is well we have heard the message Shalom and all is well let's trust in him that all is well let's rest in the promise of god let's rest do not worry yourself God is in control amen he'll make all things is beautiful in his own time no matter what you are going through I Life is In His Hands Hallelujah we cannot even walk unless what he hold our hands you cannot do anything without him we ourselves we are nothing but he in US make the difference you are nobody but somebody has got inside of you to make you want somebody because he is in you he is greater than everything you going through greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world and that greater is the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he's never lost a battle he's never lost a patient he's never lost a case am so why are we worried tonight don't worry worry everything going to be all right hallelujah praise our God our God is great amen hallelujah praise God so what I'm trying to say back to that religious pressure with Esau spirit so he said that in paragraph 190 the S marriage of the uh lamp is going to produce still born baby when a baby is born the doctor has to give like that Spanky to what to cry and to revive and life comes into that baby but if you hit and he cann't cry it me that that baby is a stillborn baby so those P CA size those um people that system is producing what a still born baby an EC ecclesiastical system that is going to bring all the denomination together to produce an Esau that hates Jacob I mean I hope you see it a still born dead denomination all of them going together to what hate Jacob but the Bible say Jacob I have loved isau I hate and Jacob T the bride of Christ it was the works of Jacob between Jacob and Esau Esau was more gentleman than Jacob and he was doing all the work taking care of his father and everything and Jacob was a rascal but behind that Rascal was the seed of God so when he came to the best right he never played with it that birth right was everything to Jacob and that birth right is everything to a true sign of God it doesn't matter how the person has meded people still do every B thing on the earth when that word of God is presented to him a true genuine seed of God will grab it and accept it and move with it like the woman at the world all her outside was covered married divorc six times five times going to take somebody's wife but when her heart was revealed when she recognized the word for her day oh man she ran with the message she ran she took away all everything all her earings and everything and run with the message said come and he see a man have seen who have told me all by heart isn't the very Messiah and she witnessed and because of a testimony it brought a lot of people to the Lord Jesus Christ so our testimony is what has to bring people to Christ because the same Holy Ghost you were dead in sin and trespasses doing all kind of stuff kofu was saiding I used to go to Every Club in Toronto here he goes over there but when the spirit of God grabb his heart he won't go back to those things anymore no I've have decided to follow Jesus no going back to the world no turning back all those things are back those are the old philli old Kofi old Des past D those in our old self you don't even it's not even come into our mind anymore because God has delivered from all those things we are New Creation in Christ Jesus amen moving forward and and and going forward with the word of God we are going forward with the word of God Amen praise God so our life is in Christ amen and the true Son of God or daughter of God does not depend on yesterday's manner yesterday's manner will not work for today yes even though it was good for yesterday tourist experience is good but he wants fresh food the bride want fresh food fresh kill everyday present in the in the present of God she want to hear direct from God yesterday experience is good but you want a present day experience present tense he's a present tense God a lot of people are driving in a red mirror always looking back always looking back the only time we go to the back is to draw experience for what has done for us to move us forward to believe and have confidence that the same God that delivered us back from that back then is able to do it again and again and again and again so we are not focusing on the past we are focusing on the present we are focus on what God is doing now fulfillment of that word in our life now amen yesterday was good but today is what we are here for what God is going to do for us something new in my life today that's what I want something new every day amen because ever presentent help he's moving forward he doesn't want us to stay back let's move with the way said leaving everything behind let's walk with what the the cross before us accomplish what is before leave everything those things we leave them behind and we moving forward forward amen because you cannot go back back will not help you amen but let's move on let's trust God Amen let's move on the present stage of his ministry amen because the man that fall last week will not work for today it was good in Luther justification but that cannot fight and face the battles that we facing now the sanctification wday is good but cannot face the battles that we are moving right now now the ammunition have gone higher the styling all over the place the atomic body can just direct and oh my the palent here they have that technology they can just pinpoint and just take the person out that's the it has gone far so the word of God is also has moved higher Amen in a higher realm yes sir amen we moving higher higher climing Jacob's lad so we are not going back you are going forward amen and the bride has made her ready amen ready to take that sword of God and cut all the amal's head off amen what is bothering you tonight you have the word of God in your hand if your child your son everyone is sick take that sword pray for the person you face any situation take that sword and move for forward I mean one the greatest weapon that Christians have is prayer yes sir but sometimes we neglect it when you get in trouble you try to solve it ourselves but when he get in any trouble any problem our first thing is prayer because that's a weapon that God has given to us amen and that weapon Will Conquer everything one time even prayer change the mind of Christ of God so said that if prayer will bring God down why don't you pray and pray and pray amen prayer will bring God anointing that prayer will change situation prayer will do so many things to you that's our our spiritual warfare When you pray and make yourself ready then God can use you for his glory and honor it's so simple because he wants to use us more than what we want to that's why Des talk about aen Allan when he went to bra Braham he said BR Braham can God use me he said God can use anybody God is willing to use anybody but we have to be ready we have to be ready the only thing is we don't have to compete or how God used brother Billy might not be the way he going to use me so you don't have to worry about how God is using Billy that's right which area how God wants to use me that's what I want to know that's what I have to know that's what I have to be ready for Hallelujah so when the time comes he will come and grab me and use me to do that provided I'm ready provided my heart is Cle my listen don't let the enemy tells you anything all that God is looking for is the desires in your heart and once you desire to please God to be used of God any negative thing that comes to your mind reject it is not part of you am God is looking at your desire am your desire is to please God your desire to do his will that's what he's looking at he's not looking at your mistakes he's not looking at your faults because he knows we are human because we have this we make a lot of mistakes he's not looking at that no sir he's looking at your desire stand PR even if your heart condemns you God is greater than your heart amen so don't let nothing condemns you tonight you are son and daughter of the Living God Amen your God loves you you your apple of his eye amen so let's trust God have confidence thank you Lord no matter what comes our way our life is in his hand there is going to be a pressure the pressure is

anything always his heart was ready when the time came God went to him and told him tell that storm to stop and they sto he said are you hunting you need squares speak and it will come he never went
