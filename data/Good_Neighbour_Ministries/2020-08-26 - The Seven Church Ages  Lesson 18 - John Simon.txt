TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] praise the lord friends praise the lord it's good to be here again on this marvelous wednesday night may the lord bless you real good we are here to study on the seven church ages and particularly concerning the ephesian church age tonight our subject will be the counterfeit church we will speak from matthew chapter 24 verses 5 and 24 shall we read the word of god for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and shall deceive many verse 24 for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders and so much if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect dear god our gracious heavenly father may your great spirit anoint the word of god for tonight may you receive glory and honor as we declare the word of the lord in the name of the lord jesus christ draw near their great spirit in jesus name amen for they shall arise many false christs and false prophets and they shall shoot great signs and wonders and if it were possible they should deceive their very elected what then the answer is clear he is giving us a prophetic warning the lord jesus is warning his church and letting them know that there is a true church and a false church a true vine the false vine but of course the false church the vine that is the false body will always try to usurp or take the place or counterfeit copy the other they will contain and always present the argument that they are really the true church or that they are the elect of god now how are we to differentiate this for we know that the false will always try to kill to destroy the true church of the living god in the book of acts it is set forth clearly that during the seven church ages this time will be a a time that will be used as a bachelor background of how the false church will infiltrate and trying to destroy the true church who is trying to represent and to present jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever that the people may get to know him in the fullness of his life work now as we present this and this cannot be changed this working this invasion of the false into the true so that it might misrepresent christ in that true church so here we see a third principle the principle of the false vine and the true bonding it may be called the principle of the true church and the false church oh friends it is clear within the word of god that satan is a copycat that satan is a counterfeit one always the cutter feet right to the end in the book of revelation where he pro presents himself as a as christ when he is the false christ but he will always continue this avenue of trying to make counterproductive this word of the living god he will not allow it to go forth freely but he must intercept interject and try to do everything to be able to misrepresent the word of god by his usurpation now if we were to go back to the beginning go back to the book of genesis ages and times past and we are now in the book of genesis here we see isaac finding his wife and hair finding her we see clearly in the book of of genesis how that god provided him with a wonderful and beautiful wife and how god used him in a wonderful way now we see in the book of genesis in the garden of eden there were also two trees a precursor ah uh it was pointing to this that this was coming this was an evil since the beginning since the time when the mother eve gave a birth to these two boys cain and abel one of god one of the devil one a son of god one a son of the devil for it was not an apple that was just a beautiful way of them trying to cover it up hide it away in the very beginning of the bible to think that such a a horrible thing took place but it did it's in the word of god if you're to read your bible in the book of genesis you will find it's not an apple neither is it appear on a tree but certainly we see it as appear on the ground now certainly the word of god tells us in genesis 4 3-5 if you will read it how it will tell us that and abel brought forth of the firstlings of his lock and the fact thereof and the lord had respect unto abel and to his offering but unto cain and his offering he had no respect but the one cain was evil being of his father of course his father being the wicked one while abel was righteous before the lord and again there were two children that came from the same parents but these twins were now going to come from isaac and rebecca one was the elect of god and the other was a reprobate both worship god but were godly what were people that would serve god that would even if there was a house of god then they would have been in the house of god worshiping god shouting glory to his mighty name but one was of god and the other was of the devil one was righteous and one was unrighteous in every case every situation the evil one hated the righteous one and also persecuted the righteous one and in some cases as you will see as you follow this trail of the serpent the the journey of the seed of the serpent through the scriptures you will find that it has tried many times throughout the years right on down until it came to the uh persecution of the church day the day making the church into a persecuted hiding having to have itself like a speckled bird at all times lines in danger for living the truth telling the truth manifesting the truth showing forth the truth of the life of god may manifest in her now know this four things that these two groups did together so that the onlookers those were looking or trying to find the true church would be either confused or deceived as which was real uh which was not real which was true and that which was false now notice carefully both were planted together both lived together both made claims upon god together and both worship god giving glory to his name together this parallels clearly the story of that jesus told of how a sword went forth to sow and how that he sold and by night his entity came and also sold seeds mingled and mixed within the original seeds that were planted by the original sewer so the source of the good seed and his enemy came and saw tears and the bible says it clearly an enemy had done this now we know god did not plant those tears satan was the one that planted those tears within the kingdom of god now these two kinds of seeds these two kinds of plants or may i say these two kinds of people were both in the same field but they grew up together their worship in the same church together giving praise and glory and hallelujah all to god doing it together but remember while doing this one was a god and the other was a reprobate a devil in the presence of almighty god now the bible tells us clearly both seeds being planted both seeds received their strengths from the original nourishment of the ground in which they were planted bought drew their strength from from god bought drew all of their vigor and them from the presence of almighty god they shared the same son s-o-n-s-u-s they shared in the same rain that came to refresh them the holy spirit formal former rain latter rain that came upon them they shared in the same sun and rain and all other benefits that god sent down to benefit his seed because the tears also had themselves in there they receive those benefits on themselves that they might grow and ripen at the same time as the original seed so when the time came to be harvested or vested they were harvested each in their turn there were drawn out of their original position do you see what i'm saying simply can you receive this truth it's very important that we remember it as we study these seven church ages for time and time again through the ages we will see the manifestation of these two spirits one of god one of the devil one true one false coming out of the word of god and the manifestation of these two ancient uh enemies god against satan manifested in the people of that particular day the manifestation takes place where every eye could see in every ear could hear above all don't forget it especially in the last age the ledecian age for remember that is when both of these seeds come to their ripening of the fullness of their harvest that is the time when we will see them in the fullness of their good the fullness of their evil the fullness of their manifestation all in the light of that day for then we see the seed of god being called to a rapture to be taken out of the air by god's grace while the false seed that was intertwined within the church of god are bound together called together in a union one called to a union for a rapturing grace a rapture the other called to a union being prepared and bound for its burning at that time [Music] and they will try to shoot the the wheat out they'll try to push out the true seed of god and that is to be garnered into the presence of god now i want to carry this truth a little further on as we look into god's marvelous wonderful words that warns us and lets the saints of god be armed and be ready for this evil is an evil not only to come but is already here that is working among us and we must discern this evil that we might withstand it in the name of the lord now if you ever studied the history of revivals you will see that a revival is a significant moving of god's holy spirit moving upon his people in a mighty way and it never fails that whenever god moves for a revival on his people satan comes and is at the same time he begins to move also trying to confuse the issue of the movement of god now during the great welsh revivals that took place in the whales we find out that as god's spirit moved and souls were saved at the same time the devil's spirit was moving and the asylums insane institutions became so filled with people that were out of their mind because it satan's attempt of a great display of his demonic power upon the first upon the face of the earth the being made to take away attention from the great work that god was doing in the life of people and to mock the goodness and the mercy of god that was being shed abroad in the hearts of many that were willing and ready to surrender themselves into the very hand of god in luther's day it says the miracle of luther was not to see miracles but the miracle was that he was able to keep his sanity and his balance his way of worship in the middle of the sea of blasphemy and evil insanity that took place around him and so we are here now recognizing the why satan used the tools of religious fanatics intertwined into the church of god using these fanatics people that would be uh apparently on the outside of the piers as if they are sane but they are in sane they are fanatic to the genuine word of god and often they are filled anointed motivated by the wrong spirit wicked evil seductive moving on the hearts and minds of these religious ones i hope you're spiritual minded and that you're able to understand and get what i'm talking about because it's in progress right now very much so within the church of the living god now the true and false vines are mingling just as they mingle at the time of planting in they field of god the tears and the wheat the true and the false were mingling there together and they were both at work in our bible john chapter first john chapter 4 verses 4 1 to 4 and jude chapter 3 verses 4 to 12 we will find that there also now we read beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby know he that the spirit of god and every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ is coming the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesseth knowledge that jesus christ has come not in the flesh is not of god and this is the spirit of antichrist whereof you have heard that it would come even now already is in the world you are of god little children and who have overcome them antichrist spirit because greater is he that is in you god's holy spirit in you is greater than any devil that's working on the outside of you greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world jude chapter 3 verses 4 to 12. beloved when i gave you all diligence to write unto you of our common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and to exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered unto the saints for there are certain men bear that in mind now there are certain men of course and women that have crept in unawares certain saints certain people that claim to be believers mixed in mingled amongst the true ones mingled in with the flock of god that is a manual listen those who were of old ordained to condemnation think of it ordained to condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our god into lascuviousness and the saviour's and denying the only lord god our lord jesus christ these are spots in your feasts of charity when they feast with you feeding themselves without fear it cannot be denied friends that in the scriptures the true church and the false church are always intertwined having been planted together but both being of different seeds planted at the same time now of course this is being addressed or spoken for the benefit of the seven churches which we see they planted in asia minor and what i say this would be like a nursery uh like a nursery from which the entire gentile church will then issue fourth so the planting time the intertwining time the beginning time he is already warning the true church of god you are going to find your enemy not on the outside that much they will be there but you're going to find your real enemy on the inside of the church right beside you knee to knee shoulder to shoulder you are going to find your enemy right there beside you now these seven churches were of course it was addressed to john there and uh god didn't speak to the church at jerusalem because the church in jerusalem was mainly jewish but speaking to these seven churches that god was showing that he had turned his attention from the jews to the gentiles and so the whole of the church ages he would be dealing with the gentiles on the calling out of the gentiles unto himself taking out of the gentiles our people for his name a people for his name so that brings the church out and brings it to growing from that hour to this time which he calls the fullness of the gentiles that time the times of the gentiles until this time of the ripening of the harvesting or what is called the fullness of the gentiles now acts chapter 13 verses 44 to 48 and the word of god when the jews saw the multitudes that they were filled with envy and spake against those things which were spoken by paul and contradicting him and blaspheming against the word of god then fallen barnabas wax bald and said it was necessary that the word of god should first have been spoken to you the jews but seeing you have put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life lo return to the gentiles for so hat the lord commanded us saying i upset thee to be a light of the gentiles that thou should speak for salvation unto the ends of the earth and when the gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believe god's word romans chapter 11 verses 1 to 8 i say then had god cast away his people god forbid for i also am an israelite of the seed of abraham of the tribe of a benjamin god had not cast a ways people which he foreign what ye not the scripture saith alliance how he maketh intercession against israel saying the lord that they have killed thy prophets dig down thine altars i am left alone and they seek my life but what said the answer of god unto him i have reserved unto myself seven thousand who have not bowed their knees amen to the image of baal even so then at this present time there also is a remnant according to the election of grace and if by grace then is no more of works otherwise grace is no more grace but if it be of works then it is of no more grace otherwise work is no more work what then israel not obtained that which he seeketh not but the election had obtained it and the rest were blinded as it is written god had given them the spirit of slumber eyes that should not see an ears that would not hear unto this very day and in romans chapter 11 verses 25 to 29 paul speaks for i would not brethren that you be ignorant of this mystery how lest you would be wise in your own conceits the blindness in part is happen to israel until the fullness of the times of the gentiles be come in and so all israel shall be saved as it is written they shall come out of zion the deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from jacob for this is my covenant unto them then when i shall take away their sins as according the gospel they are enemies to your sakes but as touching the election they are beloved for the father's sake for the gifts and callings of god are without repentance now we know that these seven churches located in asia minor ordained this contained the certain characteristics these seven churches mentioned in asia minor contain certain basic characteristics that will be figured or will be able to see them manifesting themselves within these seven ages that are to come so we see then that these characteristics being in the churches the gentile churches these seven church ages that were to come they will mature both in their good their righteousness and also in their evil of the working of that evil one satan in their very miss so we see these two seeds will come to their maturity they will come to their maturity in the time of the end which and we are in that time of their vision now and how that in that time of harvesting that the seed plants will come to its fullness and to a mature harvest for as jesus said if these things be done in a green tree what shall be done within the dry so here we are friends we have looked at four principles by which we should see god one god is unchanging two we should see the true church stays with the original pattern or blueprint it stays with that that will be how you will recognize and identify the true church we must also recognize all that says it's christian or church is not christian and it's not church we should have this understanding through this prophetic warning that there is a true church in the church and a false church so we must discern the lord's body in his day and in his time lastly recognize this principle that the jed the true church mainly concerns gentiles gentiles is what concerns the true church not that there won't be any jews in it but not any jews in mass will only be jews in individually but in mass it will be gentile the church will be gentile let me repeat again friends we can't uh help to uh look at this carefully as i close out with these four principles one the true church stays with the original pattern two god is unchanging three recognize the true and the false mind and four the church mainly concerns the gentiles it's important that we understand this as we go forward into the church age the ephesian church age for if the messenger had to have a prophecy to enlighten him to understand it this way with this kind of foundation i believe we need the very same foundations also may god bless you real god may the foundation of god as the bible says stand it sure for the lord knoweth them that are his may god show you that he knows them that are his and claim you for himself the lord bless you real good and the lord plant firmly the truth of his word within the the very foundations of your heart may never leave you but keep you and draw you closer to him god bless you [Music] you
