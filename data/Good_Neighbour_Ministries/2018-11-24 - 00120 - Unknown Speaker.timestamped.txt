[31:56] [Music]
[32:05] [Music]
[32:12] [Music]
[32:32] [Music]
[32:45] because now what is way the work
[34:25] preach the word What did he say how many
[34:29] people do you think oh I think all of
[34:32] them under that's what every choice he
[34:34] says no really he says how many
[34:37] understood only by 3000 million Jesus
[35:08] kept saying fear not little stop for now
[35:15] is that right because we are working out
[35:22] or we don't want our picture numbers for
[35:34] various reasons it is wonderful when a
[35:38] large quarter people get together people
[36:43] [Music]
[36:53] [Music]
[37:00] and so the progress was out from places
[37:05] like that amen
[37:07] lower the gup-a yes sir now
[37:15] [Music]
[37:53] [Music]
[38:10] [Music]

[39:08] [Music]
[39:24] [Music]
[39:33] [Music]
[39:47] [Music]
[39:57] [Music]
[40:04] meaning meaning the understanding of the
[40:13] word to get intentions plain to his
[40:39] children hallelu so we could understand
[40:45] became general but when we
[40:57] [Music]
[41:12] [Music]
[41:35] [Music]
[41:39] farce is great not degrees away these
[41:52] theologians are like some of these men
[41:54] into studying their Western life study
[42:00] yet right
[42:02] for years one more they study for
[42:07] otherwise so they can get all right and
[42:16] there's no to study to drive home to the
[42:20] Bible the word is just sitting there and
[42:22] taking over they can compare with
[42:30] hermeneutics
[42:44] [Music]
[42:56] [Music]
[43:13] how can we take event Dora God if it's
[43:20] not revealed and if the skills were not
[43:24] opened but if that's the fact
[43:32] then we're necessarily talking to you
[43:48] [Music]
[43:51] right but somebody had to your
[43:56] understanding so that you see
[44:09] the walls of Zion see eye to eye we
[44:13] don't see two different things we see
[44:15] the same thing done you see the same
[44:21] thing country now pray tell are what the
[44:25] popular spiritual said oh my God all
[44:28] this time in the rock which Moses after
[44:31] the same word you're going to see the
[44:34] same scene you will see the same thing
[44:38] that's all you can see that the young
[44:40] praise the Lord
[44:42] so we have there something supernatural
[44:44] going on here lack of insulin in I'm
[44:50] convinced of that because God himself
[44:56] you remember the first phase when the
[45:00] church and then there was a certain
[45:05] phase of revival as we call it a place
[45:09] where people will turn over to church we
[45:13] don't know the earth well I custom that
[45:18] I was a prayer you know the problems
[45:22] with Pentecost going on
[45:24] I was the word for word what to do and
[45:29] mother brain the Holy Spirit said open
[45:33] your phone book for soup therefore close
[45:37] your eyes put your finger over there
[45:39] with Church and inviting anybody fooling
[45:52] them
[45:54] [Music]

[46:12] [Music]
[46:20] [Music]
[46:47] [Music]
[47:02] [Music]
[47:19] the shield itself start breaking to the
[47:29] individual
