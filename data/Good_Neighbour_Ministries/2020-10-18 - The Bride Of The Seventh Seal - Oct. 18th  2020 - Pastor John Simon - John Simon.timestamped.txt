[36:45] or I love her no you were chosen before
[36:49] the foundation of the
[36:53] world and you are now living out and
[36:56] acting out what he expected you to
[36:59] do even all your mistakes your
[37:02] stumblings all your
[37:05] failings the Lord knows the ways that
[37:09] are ordained for one of his
[37:12] seed do you understand that the seed of
[37:16] God can do the same thing as much as the
[37:18] people in the world they can murder they
[37:22] can kill they can lie they can steal but
[37:24] when his time comes and he decides to
[37:27] start talking talking to you then that
[37:29] brings a
[37:31] transformation why do you think the
[37:33] Apostle Paul cried out so much and said
[37:36] oh to think I am the chief of Sinners I
[37:40] kill
[37:42] Christians not one two many many he
[37:47] killed and God turned around and said
[37:49] yeah but I I choose you to be an
[37:54] apostle so don't let the devil come to
[37:58] your mind with all kinds of guilts and
[38:02] condemnation and this and that and the
[38:04] other you were living in Perfection
[38:07] before the foundations of the world sin
[38:11] was able to make him play all of these
[38:15] uh mind games and tricks with your mind
[38:18] and with your heart and get you all
[38:20] messed up and mixed up and wondering if
[38:23] and what and when and why and then but
[38:27] but then when God lifts that Veil and
[38:30] you realize that
[38:33] hey despite all of this that that going
[38:36] on around this is just like feathers on
[38:38] a bird it's just like fluff one you know
[38:42] and and it will all pass away as we
[38:44] surrender ourselves to him praise the
[38:48] Lord I further want you to know that
[38:53] um we have $10,000 that was is just um

[39:12] of it also to go towards Mission and
[39:15] missionary work and here uh we have
[39:19] $10,000 that was given by a company
[39:23] here
[39:25] Dynasty fantasy sor

[39:36] there I'm not thinking of John Crawford

[39:48] want to acknowledge it publicly

[40:15] uh of course brother Danny here in the
[40:17] back and brother Frank belissimo those
[40:20] some of you don't know him but he's a
[40:23] wonderful uh brother and uh they're
[40:26] Partners in that business and the Lord
[40:28] placed it on their heart to do that so
[40:30] we give God the praise the honor and the
[40:32] glory amen hallelujah may the Lord bless
[40:36] you real good uh I I'm very happy to be
[40:39] here and to uh share with you the word
[40:43] of the Lord amen uh in my Bible I want
[40:49] to turn to Revelation chapter 8 verse
[40:54] one and shall we stand as we read the
[40:58] word of God God is just doing something
[41:02] marvelous and wonderful CU now it's not
[41:05] by works you know not by works it's the
[41:09] holy spirit it's the Holy Spirit spoke
[41:12] to brother Joshua and Sister Charlotte
[41:14] and now they're in New Brunswick and and
[41:17] and doing missionary work there I didn't
[41:20] ask them I didn't even think about that
[41:22] well all of a sudden God speak to them
[41:24] so he's taking the whole message into
[41:27] another realm where he is in
[41:30] preeminence three brothers are heading
[41:32] into
[41:34] Jamaica led by the Holy Spirit to go
[41:38] preach the word of God uh uh to the
[41:41] people up there in the Hills mountains
[41:44] wherever it's uh um the Africans that
[41:48] were enslaved and taken to Jamaica but
[41:51] they escaped and when they escaped they
[41:54] went into those mountains and the
[41:56] British and the French French and the
[41:58] Spanish was never able to conquer them
[42:01] or get them back and they remained there
[42:04] and they got their independence like
[42:07] they're on reserves like and uh so um
[42:11] they still have a lot of those African
[42:13] traditions and things and their tongues
[42:16] have African names so um these brothers
[42:21] have a burden on their heart and they're
[42:22] going there to preach the word of God to
[42:25] them and it just happens by the way that
[42:29] they bump into um a man that is of that
[42:33] tribe in Toronto and he said what you're
[42:37] going up there I'm coming with
[42:39] you so that work of man this is the work
[42:43] of God this is the holy spirit now
[42:48] showing to the people I only have
[42:50] pastors a Shepherds but I am above
[42:53] everything I'm in preeminence I'm in
[42:56] control so we place it all in his hands
[42:59] and to him be all the glory amen praise
[43:03] the Lord let us read out of the word of
[43:08] God and when he had opened the seventh
[43:12] seal there was
[43:14] silence in heaven about the space of a
[43:19] half an hour praise the
[43:22] Lord praise God may God bless his word
[43:25] gracious father we thank you for the the
[43:27] reading of the word now we pray that you
[43:29] will bless your people as we worship you
[43:33] and fellowship around the word together
[43:37] in Jesus name amen please be
[43:41] seated now my my emphasis will not be on
[43:44] the half an hour
[43:45] assignments which is what you know a lot
[43:49] of the preaching on the 7 seal is about
[43:52] the half an hour silence and what that
[43:56] means and pertains but I want to uh talk
[44:00] about this uh I'm still series of the
[44:06] end time bride
[44:08] identified now she's being identified as
[44:13] the seventh seal or if you want to say
[44:15] as a part of the seventh
[44:19] seal so I want to uh entitled this the
[44:22] seventh sealed bride the seventh seal
[44:27] bride praise the Lord so we thank the
[44:30] Lord for
[44:31] her now we ended our last talk of how
[44:35] that the fullness of the word uh the
[44:39] prophet brother Bram said did not come
[44:43] and uh and was not
[44:46] available in the years of his
[44:50] preparation right I explained to you
[44:53] that Jesus life had the same three
[44:55] things the first the first year was the
[44:58] year of his preparing for his fullness
[45:01] of his ministry and the next was the
[45:04] year of
[45:06] popularity and after that once he got
[45:09] into his third pull of the word and he
[45:12] started to bring it saying I and my
[45:14] father are one when he start to say yes
[45:18] Moses said I say right and so on your
[45:22] father Abraham longed to see my day and
[45:25] he saw it and he was
[45:28] glad said what is he talking about is
[45:31] this man older than Abraham is they
[45:35] don't know they were looking at the
[45:36] Ancient of Days but he was in a
[45:39] body and he he began to talk to them
[45:42] because now he was in his third pull and
[45:45] he was bringing the word of God in such
[45:48] a way to identify himself now I won't
[45:52] touch on all that but brother Brenham
[45:54] said you know Jesus talked about all
[45:56] those seals but the seventh seal he said
[45:59] uh you know he he couldn't say anything
[46:02] he don't know that was left out and uh
[46:05] he says but that seventh seal started in
[46:08] the Garden of Eden and it came right on
[46:11] down through now if you want to study
[46:13] your Bible and look at you will see
[46:15] Abraham saw it you're going to see
[46:17] different ones that saw it God allowed
[46:21] them to see it not know it but see that
[46:26] there is a seven seal praise the Lord so
[46:29] there's people through the Bible that
[46:30] actually saw there was a seventh seal
[46:32] Daniel this one that one come on down
[46:35] even Paul praise the Lord so we give the
[46:38] Lord Jesus glory for that so years of
[46:42] preparation years of popularity and then
[46:45] the last year of persecution same thing
[46:48] with brother bradam when he preached son
[46:51] I identify this generation for the
[46:55] second crucifixion of Jesus Christ
[46:57] because by then he was being persecuted
[47:00] right and if you watch his life and line
[47:02] it up with those things you will see is
[47:04] exactly the same thing has happened and
[47:08] repeated again praise the Lord so the
[47:13] bride uh you know did not uh really
[47:19] catch a whole of the word our attention
[47:22] was not really
[47:24] galvanized until he started talking
[47:28] about those
[47:30] seals and the seals began to open up and
[47:35] we know that from those seals something
[47:39] or somebody came out of those
[47:42] seals and that caught her attention
[47:45] right it caught the bride's attention uh
[47:49] right at that point in time and I talked
[47:53] about the doing God's service without
[47:55] doing his will uh page uh 32 how that
[48:01] they how that the cloud which here
[48:05] appeared in Arizona over the
[48:09] mountains and that people
[48:12] recognize that that was not natural
[48:15] matter of fact if you can find a copy of
[48:18] a Life Magazine um from way back it's
[48:22] actually in Life Magazine where they're
[48:25] saying mysterious cloud we don't know
[48:27] what it is moisture is not supposed to
[48:29] be up there I I'm not sure whether I
[48:32] have that magazine somewhere but um
[48:36] moisture is not supposed 30 miles up
[48:39] you're not supposed to have moisture
[48:41] Cloud nothing like that is supposed to
[48:43] be out there uh as such so it remains to
[48:47] this day a mystery to them but a prophet
[48:51] came down and he told the people he says
[48:53] don't tell them they think it's some
[48:55] kind of a this or that he said but it's
[48:57] them seven angels that met me on the
[49:00] mountain opened up them seals and they
[49:03] were on their way back Hallelujah and
[49:06] they took the picture when they're on
[49:07] their way back glory to God and it came
[49:11] out and those Brothers had it he said no
[49:14] he says turn it the other way and turn
[49:17] it the right way and it came out the
[49:19] face of
[49:21] Christ the face of Jesus
[49:24] Christ within the those clouds
[49:29] Hallelujah now it's the second coming
[49:34] it's the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ
[49:37] it was Jesus Christ coming
[49:39] again but we failed to recognize that
[49:43] coming that now he was coming as the son
[49:46] of man right praise the Lord hallelujah
[49:50] I know you're hearing me but then it
[49:52] will become clearer as we go along now
[49:56] remember remember the wise men in the
[50:00] Bible we coming back now to Christmas
[50:02] time it's not Christmas yet but the wise
[50:05] men in the Bible they were in the
[50:08] East and they saw a star in the
[50:12] heavens and by seeing the star this
[50:16] Supernatural
[50:18] event the heavens of course decare the
[50:20] glory of God the heaven
[50:23] speaks and declares the glory of God go
[50:28] and when the wise men looked and saw the
[50:30] star in the
[50:31] heavens they
[50:33] recognized that that star those Stars
[50:37] which is three actually you know it
[50:38] wasn't one star it was uh uh Jupiter
[50:43] Saturn Mars all came together and one
[50:47] right it's one God not three he one
[50:50] anyway so there it is that when they saw
[50:54] that Supernatural event in in the
[50:57] heavens there were wise men they were
[51:00] separate from each other in different
[51:02] countries Prophet said one from India
[51:04] one from Persia one from somewhere else
[51:07] but anyway all of them recognize that
[51:11] star in the heavens is the sign that
[51:14] Messiah is on earth
[51:17] now for a star will arise in Jesse
[51:22] praise God when the Messiah comes so by
[51:26] seeing the star in the heavens they
[51:31] haven't seen the Messiah yet but they
[51:33] recognize Messiah is on earth now glory
[51:37] to God hallelujah oh my so do you
[51:41] understand we see those seven angels
[51:45] going back we see the clouds in the
[51:49] heavens the mysterious clouds to them
[51:53] but praise God to the true wise men of
[51:56] the this
[51:57] hour we recognize that was a
[52:00] sign fire is on the Earth right
[52:05] now because the heavens spoke before man
[52:10] even had a chance to actually recognize
[52:15] and realize that the son of man was on
[52:20] Earth amen hallelujah of course we know
[52:24] that the word which is is God was
[52:28] revealing
[52:30] himself now a quoting from a message
[52:34] called Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[52:37] today and forever paragraph 111 to 112
[52:42] and I'm saying it like this so you can
[52:45] and anyone else anywhere else can study
[52:48] it I can just preach if I want it to and
[52:51] not even mention that but I want you to
[52:53] be able to uh follow it there praise God
[52:57] you will find that there and also in in
[53:02] a message called the Messiah paragraph
[53:07] 26 here Jesus is mentioning about these
[53:10] wise men so that's not something that I
[53:12] just made up uh he's talk he's saying it
[53:15] there right in the word that they
[53:17] recognize Messiah was on the earth now
[53:21] when they saw that Heavenly event that
[53:24] was the sign to let you know Christ had
[53:27] come
[53:28] down that was a sign to let you know he
[53:31] had come back before the Rapture out of
[53:35] here and that he was on the earth praise
[53:39] God now in the Messiah a brief quote in
[53:43] the Messiah there he said and do you
[53:47] realize that the Messiah in this hour is
[53:51] really Messiah
[53:54] ex because he he the Messiah is now
[53:59] represented by his Messiah ex and his
[54:03] Messiah s his church his bride they are
[54:07] his
[54:08] Representatives so who really is the
[54:10] Messiah of the hour the son of man
[54:14] praise God it's Jesus Christ it's not
[54:17] somebody else even though we are
[54:19] involved in it it's not somebody else
[54:22] page 20 of the unveiling of God he says
[54:25] you realize what's happening it's
[54:28] Jehovah now unveiling
[54:31] God hallelujah now you know what he's
[54:34] talking about you were part of him
[54:37] you're part of the Masterpiece we got
[54:40] lost we come down but we are still a
[54:43] part of
[54:44] God and he identifies you that you're a
[54:47] part of God hallelujah but you were
[54:51] veiled by sin by Fog by clouds by doubt
[54:55] everything else but now Jehovah has come
[54:59] to pull the veil off the Masterpiece
[55:02] take the veil off of God that the world
[55:05] would recognize him in his people and
[55:08] know that he is the same yesterday today
[55:12] and forever in them praise God
[55:18] hallelujah hallelujah the spirit of God
[55:22] is doing what is taking a veil off the
[55:25] word so that our eyes and our hearts and
[55:28] Minds can see him Hallelujah because you
[55:31] would have just been reading the Bible
[55:33] like anybody else and the verses are the
[55:36] same verses the scripture same scripture
[55:38] but all of a sudden Jehovah begins to
[55:41] take the veil off of
[55:45] God God taking the veil off God what are
[55:48] you talking about it's that part of him
[55:52] that was the mystery Through the Ages
[55:55] he's now taking a Veil off of it he's
[55:58] letting people see his bride just before
[56:01] she go
[56:02] away he's starting to identify her to
[56:05] the world you can say what you like
[56:08] about her you can say oh H she has a
[56:13] mole on her on her um face on the left
[56:17] side of her face his eyes that mole is
[56:20] her beauty that MO is part of her beauty
[56:23] you think it's a flaw but to him it's
[56:25] her beauty praise God God whatever you
[56:27] oh you did this you did that you did the
[56:29] other I saw you when you you made this
[56:32] mistake you made that mistake he is not
[56:34] looking at your mistakes they're under
[56:36] the
[56:38] blood Hallelujah and if you're a real
[56:41] seed son or daughter of God you'll
[56:43] repent of it so he's not even worrying
[56:47] about that because you he knows you're
[56:49] going to come to him and repent of him
[56:51] and get those things cleared out praise
[56:54] God hallelujah glory to God hallelujah
[56:58] thank God that he is the one that holds
[57:00] the
[57:01] key I thank God the key is not in the
[57:05] hand of of a pope or or or super
[57:08] superintendent because uh when I was a
[57:11] boy and I'm saying it so that you can
[57:14] know how long ago that
[57:18] was I remember they had the Bibles in
[57:21] the Catholic Church big thick Bibles and
[57:25] they had a brass or gold has around it
[57:28] with a padlock you could not read out of
[57:32] the Bible nobody and they made it so
[57:35] mysterious that when the priest went up
[57:37] there and he opened that that lock and
[57:41] then he things it back he pulls it back
[57:44] and then he might read a small piece of
[57:46] it out of it all the rest is in
[57:49] Latin but you see that's just the devil
[57:52] copying the word for the Bible says he
[57:56] said I hold the
[57:58] key I hold the key of
[58:01] David I open and no man
[58:05] shut and if I shut no man can open if I
[58:10] open your understanding and your wisdom
[58:13] they can't put you back in a box anymore
[58:16] because you you you're been opened up
[58:18] the whole thing unlocked the Bible
[58:20] unlocked the seals unlock the message
[58:23] unlocked the the truths in the word live
[58:26] released to you it can't be locked up
[58:29] anymore praise God and if I lock up your
[58:33] understanding you can sit there and you
[58:35] can hear the same things that the rest
[58:37] of them are hearing and it will just be
[58:40] religious it will be good you'll enjoy
[58:42] it but the the the unwritten word the
[58:46] the the fullness of the word is not
[58:49] going to come right true to you as it
[58:52] should praise the name of the Lord
[58:55] hallelujah praise God think of
[58:58] it Jehovah taken the veil of God to show
[59:03] you the difference between right and
[59:07] wrong between truth and error who is the
[59:11] seed and who is not a seed that's not
[59:14] for us to judge but God's holy spirit
[59:18] will start causing you to be able to
[59:21] recognize hallelujah amen the six seals
[59:26] we know revealed Christ walking up and
[59:29] down amongst the candlesticks during the
[59:31] church
[59:33] ages but it also reveals to us the trail
[59:37] of the serpent the mystery of
[59:39] iniquity how iniquity intertwined itself
[59:43] down through the ages in the
[59:45] church moved amongst the people all of
[59:49] the
[59:50] while and so we
[59:53] see Jesus Christ and his actions
[59:57] and we also see Satan and his works now
[1:00:01] made plain in front of
[1:00:04] us praise God but through the opening of
[1:00:09] the seventh
[1:00:10] seal what does that do because the six
[1:00:13] seals it uh explained it revealed and it
[1:00:17] made known to us the good and the evil
[1:00:20] truth and error down Through the Ages
[1:00:24] right to this time
[1:00:26] okay now the seventh seal does not talk
[1:00:30] about those
[1:00:32] things if you read it if you checked it
[1:00:35] out it it seems like nothing was said it
[1:00:39] it it's a mystery and it is for it is
[1:00:42] the mystery that was hid Through the
[1:00:45] Ages it was hid in his mind Through the
[1:00:48] Ages the the the the Jews didn't know
[1:00:51] that God was going to have a bride he
[1:00:53] was the Jews didn't know he was going to
[1:00:55] have a church
[1:00:56] the the Jews didn't know nothing about
[1:00:58] that nobody knew what was going to
[1:01:01] happen that he was going to call out
[1:01:05] from among the Gentiles a people for his
[1:01:09] name I'm saying to you the bride is the
[1:01:12] mystery that was hid that Paul spoke of
[1:01:16] if the princes of this world knew they
[1:01:18] would have never crucify the Lord the
[1:01:20] glory amen why his wife was in his side
[1:01:25] and it turned around and pierced him in
[1:01:27] the same side and they brought about her
[1:01:33] manifestation because they pierced him
[1:01:35] in the side and there the wife was able
[1:01:38] to be expressed upon the Earth praise
[1:01:41] God so if the princes of this world knew
[1:01:45] they would have not crucified the Lord
[1:01:47] Of
[1:01:49] Glory Hallelujah and we would have just
[1:01:52] remained in him we would have remained
[1:01:54] in his mind whatever but they expressed
[1:01:58] it by what they were doing so through
[1:02:02] the opening of the seventh seal Christ
[1:02:06] reveals himself to his
[1:02:09] bride
[1:02:11] Hallelujah and he reveals to his bride
[1:02:15] as his
[1:02:16] bride not only to his bride but reveals
[1:02:20] to her that she must recognize that she
[1:02:24] is a part of this
[1:02:27] Hallelujah so the bride
[1:02:30] herself is the seven
[1:02:34] seal for she is the son of man the son
[1:02:39] of man but he's deliberately revealing
[1:02:43] himself in the bride
[1:02:46] form you
[1:02:48] understand it's still Christ he is the
[1:02:52] seventh seal but Christ now in this age
[1:02:57] has come back not to reveal himself as
[1:02:59] Jesus Christ back there one man but a
[1:03:02] many membered bride body amen revealing
[1:03:07] himself not in virgin born flesh but in
[1:03:12] redeemed flesh by the blood of the lamb
[1:03:15] and by the power of the holy
[1:03:18] spirit amen praise God how will Satan
[1:03:22] suspect something like that flawed
[1:03:24] people people with mistakes stumbling
[1:03:26] and failing and everything else like
[1:03:28] that he will never think that out of can
[1:03:32] any good thing come out of
[1:03:34] Nazareth in other words praise the Lord
[1:03:37] hallelujah he he he wouldn't expect that
[1:03:39] but God has done it amen and I am a
[1:03:43] testimony of it I am an example of it I
[1:03:46] believe you are an example of it and
[1:03:49] that's why we are gathered here today by
[1:03:51] the grace of
[1:03:54] God h Hallelujah GL the son of man
[1:03:59] revealing himself in the bright form
[1:04:02] sometimes we say these things we don't
[1:04:03] even know fully what we're saying amen
[1:04:07] but think about it we have been given
[1:04:09] the truth that we might know him the
[1:04:12] truth and we might recognize the
[1:04:15] activities of Satan the activities of
[1:04:18] error how can we ever mistake it you
[1:04:22] can't oh praise God let me just move on
[1:04:26] the seal book page 473 you write some of
[1:04:29] these things down go study it read it
[1:04:31] yourself I'm not going to sit here and
[1:04:34] and be quoting all those things you can
[1:04:36] go do that yourself so he said the book
[1:04:41] is holding the mystery
[1:04:45] Hallelujah the book is holding the
[1:04:47] mystery of whose names are on that
[1:04:51] Lamb's Book of Life glory to God so the
[1:04:54] book is on F holding the mystery praise
[1:04:58] God so we see that the names of the
[1:05:01] elect which you know brother brandham
[1:05:03] said that's why John wept because the
[1:05:05] book was holding the names of those
[1:05:09] elect in there praise God and and and
[1:05:12] nobody was allowed to open it up and see
[1:05:15] those names and recognize who was in
[1:05:18] there and who was not in there and a lot
[1:05:20] of presuming went on and and stuff like
[1:05:24] that and Satan could do a lot of a lot
[1:05:26] of presuming and dressing up of people
[1:05:29] and educating of people to deceive the
[1:05:31] whole world but God had the mystery the
[1:05:36] bride hid in there that seven seal bride
[1:05:39] was hidden as a mystery in the word of
[1:05:43] the Living
[1:05:44] God hallelujah so we couldn't know and
[1:05:48] we didn't know that our names were re
[1:05:52] written in the book until that seventh
[1:05:55] season seal broke praise the Lord and to
[1:05:59] this day when the seven seal broke many
[1:06:03] many people preach it say it and know it
[1:06:08] that the seventh seal is
[1:06:10] broken but
[1:06:12] broken yes but is it revealed to
[1:06:17] you you see it's one thing to know is
[1:06:20] broken and you can write books you can
[1:06:23] make tapes you can preach about it seven
[1:06:27] seal broken and this and that and the
[1:06:28] other yes but is it revealed to
[1:06:32] you as an
[1:06:34] individual that you might have an
[1:06:36] individual revelation of who you are and
[1:06:40] what and who the word of God is and then
[1:06:43] in Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:06:45] brother Bram said if you say that this
[1:06:48] word is revealed to you and it's not
[1:06:53] manifesting out of your life then you
[1:06:55] got the wrong Revelation amen you didn't
[1:06:58] get it you thought you got it but you
[1:07:00] didn't get it amen because once you get
[1:07:04] it it will begin to manifest itself in
[1:07:08] you and through your life
[1:07:12] effortlessly you don't have to work
[1:07:14] yourself up into anything you don't have
[1:07:16] to shout him down like um uh ahab's
[1:07:20] prophets you don't have to bring him
[1:07:22] down you don't screaming up it will make
[1:07:25] you do that but you are not going to do
[1:07:28] that as to bring him on the scene you
[1:07:31] are just going to be serving and
[1:07:33] worshiping him and the spirit of God
[1:07:35] will move across you and sometimes when
[1:07:38] you shout hallelujah you didn't realize
[1:07:40] that you wanted to even shout hallelujah
[1:07:42] praise God oh glory to God Amen
[1:07:46] Hallelujah like that now I said some
[1:07:49] things there but let me en encapsulate
[1:07:52] it broken
[1:07:56] revealed and now
[1:08:00] manifested the SE by back there by the
[1:08:04] lamb that don't mean it's being revealed
[1:08:06] to
[1:08:06] you you know you talk about it and then
[1:08:10] if you say oh yeah I I know it's it's
[1:08:12] revealed to me then the revelation will
[1:08:15] become part of you amen and you will
[1:08:19] recognize that you are a part of that
[1:08:22] Revelation and it will become manifested
[1:08:25] in and through you without you having to
[1:08:28] say anything so broken revealed
[1:08:31] manifested praise the name of the Lord
[1:08:33] Jesus hallelujah amen oh
[1:08:38] my it's like impossible to know that
[1:08:42] you're in the bride without having that
[1:08:45] seventh seal revealed to you you can't
[1:08:49] know if you're in the
[1:08:50] bride and this terms sometimes are
[1:08:53] mysterious the seven seal the fullness
[1:08:55] of the word revealed to you uh open up
[1:08:59] to you and they say fullness of the word
[1:09:02] I can't I can't even explain it all I
[1:09:05] can tell you is that something happens
[1:09:08] where when you look at your Bible you
[1:09:11] start to see and read between the lines
[1:09:15] it's not education it's not study it's
[1:09:18] not hours hours of fasting and prayer
[1:09:22] and and you know people are impressed by
[1:09:24] that that man must be spiritual he prays
[1:09:26] a lot that woman must be spiritual she
[1:09:29] fasts a lot you know you may do that as
[1:09:32] God leads you but that's not what gives
[1:09:35] you it's in you and you know I was even
[1:09:40] thinking of it today whether to even
[1:09:42] come out with these notes because it's
[1:09:45] all right to have the notes but to say
[1:09:47] exactly how I want to say it that's why
[1:09:49] I have the notes but it's it's in me I I
[1:09:52] can just stand here and and just open
[1:09:54] the Bible start in one spot and start
[1:09:57] talking about this Revelation and it'll
[1:10:00] go on and on and on and on and on
[1:10:02] because it's not just something I'm
[1:10:04] making up it's something that is in me
[1:10:07] and it's part of the word and the word
[1:10:11] is the season when it's unveiling itself
[1:10:14] and it's unveiling himself not as him
[1:10:17] back there but her right now that's what
[1:10:21] the holy spirit is doing but people's
[1:10:24] eyes are still looking back there and
[1:10:26] they're looking back there and they want
[1:10:29] to have another revelation of him there
[1:10:32] but they're not seeing the the very
[1:10:35] Revel Christ revealed in his own word in
[1:10:38] his own people amen hallelujah what a
[1:10:42] day what hour and what a time for us to
[1:10:46] recognize friends that the Deep must
[1:10:49] called back to the
[1:10:51] Deep God unveiling God the husband
[1:10:56] calling out to his wife brother brenon
[1:10:59] said I'm in the mountains he says oh and
[1:11:03] I hear the the elk and hear the Wolves
[1:11:09] call calling out to their mates wherever
[1:11:12] they are oh praise God don't you
[1:11:16] understand the same thing in nature it's
[1:11:18] the same in the word of God that the
[1:11:21] Holy Spirit calling out to his
[1:11:24] bride how is she going to know how's she
[1:11:27] going to know something about it there
[1:11:29] might be
[1:11:30] 1,200 wolves shouting at the same time
[1:11:33] or 12 Elks but that wife is going to
[1:11:37] know that voice my sheep know my voice
[1:11:42] and a stranger they will not follow
[1:11:45] there no mistake about it they recognize
[1:11:48] him because his sheep knows his voice
[1:11:52] blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:11:54] Hallelujah
[1:11:55] questions and answers page
[1:11:58] 239 then God became materialized in a
[1:12:02] man called Christ Jesus Christ which was
[1:12:07] his son and this son gave his life to
[1:12:12] bring other sons and daughters that God
[1:12:17] might again become tangible working in
[1:12:22] all all in all and in that day ye shall
[1:12:28] know I am in the Father the father in me
[1:12:32] and now I'm in you praise God that's
[1:12:35] this
[1:12:37] day God
[1:12:40] tangible in Jesus Christ and now it
[1:12:43] repeats again God again makes himself
[1:12:49] tangible but now it's in the bride
[1:12:52] for it's the same God
[1:12:55] the fullness that filled him is now
[1:13:00] filling her no one person
[1:13:05] is it or the Messiah or Jesus or
[1:13:09] whatever but you are a
[1:13:12] part to make you feel smaller you're a
[1:13:18] particle amen now brother Brenham was
[1:13:21] asked this
[1:13:23] question now brother Brenham
[1:13:25] is it true that every Jew born since
[1:13:28] Christ come will be saved amen
[1:13:32] hallelujah oh my no nothing will be
[1:13:36] saved only those whose names were put on
[1:13:40] the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:13:43] foundation of the
[1:13:45] world Amen see whether they be jew or
[1:13:50] Gentile that's
[1:13:52] all the book holds the
[1:13:56] mystery and the book is only
[1:14:01] unfolding it
[1:14:03] now not each one's
[1:14:07] names Hallelujah see but the
[1:14:12] mystery of the names that were in the
[1:14:16] book for the book would say now
[1:14:20] Lil he's supposed to be saved the book
[1:14:23] doesn't say oh Harman evil or whatsoever
[1:14:28] or whoever else is to be saved no it
[1:14:31] don't say it like that it just shows or
[1:14:35] reveals the mystery it unfolds the
[1:14:39] mystery of what the thing is that we
[1:14:44] ourselves by Faith by
[1:14:48] Revelation can believe
[1:14:51] it amen that's what I'm trying to say
[1:14:55] say that's what I said the other night
[1:14:58] you understand praise the Lord the seven
[1:15:00] seal breaks to you and what happens amen
[1:15:05] it's not a mystery to you anymore it
[1:15:07] becomes a
[1:15:08] revelation it was a mystery when you
[1:15:10] didn't know but it becomes a revelation
[1:15:13] when you're going to beiz wait a
[1:15:16] minute I'm seeing
[1:15:19] myself I'm I'm in the mirror I'm in the
[1:15:21] word hallelujah I'm a part of this
[1:15:26] I'm a part of this whatever it is I'm a
[1:15:30] part of it and uh I thank God for that
[1:15:33] Hallelujah let me give you another
[1:15:35] quotation here Christ revealing his own
[1:15:37] word uh I believe page 28 now the same
[1:15:40] thing is this if you are a son or
[1:15:43] daughter of
[1:15:46] God we were in God at the
[1:15:53] beginning Hallelujah
[1:15:56] and when Jesus became the fullness of
[1:16:00] the
[1:16:01] [Music]
[1:16:02] word then we were already in
[1:16:08] him so when he was
[1:16:12] crucified
[1:16:13] we also were
[1:16:16] crucified in
[1:16:19] him when he rose from the dead we also
[1:16:25] have already rose from the dead do you
[1:16:28] see why you can't miss the
[1:16:31] Rapture you already the prophet said it
[1:16:34] Christ he said it in the rising of the
[1:16:37] sun and a few other places he said don't
[1:16:39] you realize once you recognize once you
[1:16:43] have really caught the Revelation you
[1:16:46] are already
[1:16:48] resurrected this is just a manifestation
[1:16:50] of of your res you're you're already
[1:16:52] raised up he said don't you see your
[1:16:56] your spirit is living above sin above
[1:16:58] the world and above all that stff he
[1:17:00] said you're already raised up hallelujah
[1:17:03] praise God and the potential in other
[1:17:06] place he said of the Resurrection is
[1:17:08] already in you
[1:17:10] amen
[1:17:12] hallelujah so it's in you and it's being
[1:17:15] watered by the word of God hallelujah
[1:17:19] what kind of a faith it's going to take
[1:17:21] for you to go in Rapture brother rapture
[1:17:25] in facei hallelujah it's not one sudden
[1:17:29] all of a sudden one day you feel your
[1:17:31] chest that boom boom boom bo oh now I'm
[1:17:33] getting the Rapture in faith
[1:17:36] no it's a Rapture
[1:17:39] Revelation it's so simply said it says
[1:17:43] going to be so humble if you're not
[1:17:45] watching it'll pass right by you it'll
[1:17:48] just go right by you it w appear to be
[1:17:51] nothing
[1:17:53] much so when he wrot rose from the dead
[1:17:56] we rose with him and
[1:18:00] now since we have recognized
[1:18:05] it now we are sitting together with him
[1:18:10] in Heavenly places in Christ I wonder
[1:18:14] what Heavenly places he's talking about
[1:18:15] that's a totally different message and
[1:18:17] sermon but what a Heavenly place to live
[1:18:20] in all see this word of God swirling
[1:18:23] around your head in your mouth mind and
[1:18:25] your soul everywhere you turn the word
[1:18:28] the word the word you're not trying to
[1:18:30] put something on you're not trying to
[1:18:32] deliberately make an effort because the
[1:18:35] word is working mightily in you amen
[1:18:39] since we have recognize it we are Sons
[1:18:42] and Daughters of God we are children of
[1:18:46] God then we are the attributes of God
[1:18:50] then that means we got eternal life and
[1:18:53] that means god is the only eternal life
[1:18:55] there is then we were in him from the
[1:18:59] beginning and when Jesus became all that
[1:19:03] word then we were part of him then amen
[1:19:07] he says there you are when that is in
[1:19:10] there when that is in there in you there
[1:19:14] is no devil no powers no nothing can
[1:19:19] ever move that from you for that is the
[1:19:23] tpost of your
[1:19:25] soul amen glory to God what you're tied
[1:19:29] to the word of God you're tied up you're
[1:19:32] Tangled Up With Jesus oh praise God
[1:19:36] hallelujah he's got you in his arms he
[1:19:40] got the whole world but he's got you in
[1:19:42] his
[1:19:44] arms amen praise the name of the Lord
[1:19:48] Jesus Hallelujah think about it brothers
[1:19:51] and sisters what I'm saying here today
[1:19:54] praise the Lord I'm just a little bit
[1:19:56] slower because I want you to convey the
[1:19:59] truth of the word of God to you amen
[1:20:04] since we have recognized it have you
[1:20:07] recognized it have you recognized it
[1:20:11] praise the Lord you don't have to
[1:20:12] identify yourself to me but you know in
[1:20:15] your heart whether you recognize it
[1:20:17] within your heart hallelujah oh my see
[1:20:21] you see what he's saying if you can't
[1:20:24] are don't recognize you don't have a
[1:20:26] revelation that you were in God before
[1:20:30] the beginning how can you find your
[1:20:32] position in the bride how can you find
[1:20:36] your position in him if you don't see
[1:20:39] that seal book page
[1:20:42] 473 the book holds the mystery and by
[1:20:45] faith of course we believe it the bride
[1:20:49] gets a revelation of that mystery
[1:20:52] because it's not a mystery to her
[1:20:55] because she belied what she sees and she
[1:20:59] sees herself within the word of God she
[1:21:03] sees she begins to realize she was the
[1:21:06] mystery that was hidden from the devil
[1:21:09] or he would have destroyed her like he
[1:21:11] did the first Eve he would have deceived
[1:21:13] her like he did the first Eve but she
[1:21:16] was hid from him and it's when we come
[1:21:19] from behind the veil of the word amen
[1:21:23] that's when the devil is is able to
[1:21:25] attack her praise the Lord hallelujah so
[1:21:29] the bride is going to get a revelation
[1:21:30] of the word and by getting the
[1:21:33] revelation of the word that is going to
[1:21:36] call her name because whatever the word
[1:21:39] is preached whatever it
[1:21:42] says something is coming out of that
[1:21:46] word unseen unheard but you can he said
[1:21:50] the one whom you feel within your heart
[1:21:53] now you feel him but one day he'll
[1:21:57] become personalized before you praise
[1:22:00] the Lord
[1:22:02] hallelujah I can only tell my wife I
[1:22:05] love you but how could I really express
[1:22:09] love how could she really know all the
[1:22:13] emotions all the thoughts all the how
[1:22:16] could she know I can't convey all of
[1:22:19] that all I all I can do is use outside
[1:22:22] actions things I will do or say or you
[1:22:26] can do or say that will show that amen
[1:22:30] but that's Paul goes around and says but
[1:22:32] yes but then when we get on the other
[1:22:35] side then shall we know as we are known
[1:22:37] but here we are just expressing the best
[1:22:40] we can of what is in our hearts and
[1:22:42] within our minds and within our lives
[1:22:44] praise the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:22:47] hallelujah amen so we thank God that
[1:22:51] this revelation of this mystery reveals
[1:22:55] itself to
[1:22:56] her and by revealing itself to her it
[1:23:00] identifies her and she turns around and
[1:23:04] identifies herself oh it's talking about
[1:23:07] me oh it's talking about me so she's
[1:23:10] just identified herself it identify her
[1:23:12] she identifies herself she sees herself
[1:23:15] back in the fullness of the word of God
[1:23:20] Amen now talking about the spirit of
[1:23:23] Elijah doing God of service without
[1:23:25] doing his will page 34 talking about the
[1:23:28] spirit of Elijah of brother brandham
[1:23:31] said of course is nothing less than the
[1:23:33] spirit of Christ it's the spirit of
[1:23:36] Christ but uh you see a lot of people
[1:23:39] when you say that they don't understand
[1:23:41] they still got the trinitarian thoughts
[1:23:44] and so their minds operate that way oh
[1:23:46] he's talking about Elijah oh he's
[1:23:47] talking about Christ so it's two people
[1:23:50] they don't understand that the spirit of
[1:23:53] Elijah is just like a a facet of a
[1:23:57] diamond it's just a facet off of his
[1:23:59] personality expressed in a man called
[1:24:03] Elijah it's not a different person's
[1:24:05] different Spirit it was just used for a
[1:24:08] moment of time and um he uses that
[1:24:12] quality more than once matter of fact
[1:24:14] the Bible says he's going to use it at
[1:24:16] least five times so it's Jesus Christ
[1:24:20] who has actually come back in this day
[1:24:22] to identify his own own
[1:24:25] bride remember Eleazar brought Rebecca
[1:24:28] to Isaac
[1:24:30] Hallelujah but he didn't have to turn
[1:24:33] and say Isaac this is
[1:24:37] her or he didn't have to tell
[1:24:40] Rebecca uh Rebecca that's Isaac the
[1:24:44] Bible said from the time she arrived and
[1:24:46] she looked and see him and he raised up
[1:24:48] from where he was among those wheat and
[1:24:50] look and you see her they start running
[1:24:52] to one another you see have you ever
[1:24:56] seen any of those movies when the two
[1:24:58] stars are running
[1:25:02] to but that actually is what happened in
[1:25:05] the Bible Rebecca start running to him
[1:25:08] and he start running to her the Bible
[1:25:10] says and he took her to his father's
[1:25:12] house and he's going to do the same
[1:25:14] thing today take the bride to his
[1:25:17] father's house come and go with me to my
[1:25:20] father's house where there is joy joy

[1:25:29] hallelujah oh praise God hallelujah amen
[1:25:33] yes sir so he he the
[1:25:36] word has come to identify his own
[1:25:40] bride and at the same time his own bride
[1:25:45] identifies him because she sees that's
[1:25:49] the real word that's the real husband
[1:25:52] that's the word that I'm seeing over
[1:25:55] there praise God hallelujah amen because
[1:25:58] she hears and sees not just the written
[1:26:01] word but she she she she she doesn't
[1:26:04] even go just up to the spoken word
[1:26:07] written word spoken word and then she's
[1:26:09] gone into the third P Unwritten word
[1:26:12] she's hearing the logo speaking back to
[1:26:15] her she's hearing the pillar of fire
[1:26:18] talk into her soul amen praise God now
[1:26:22] remember when that's Spirit of Elijah
[1:26:25] came he said I am not
[1:26:28] him but he is standing amongst you now
[1:26:32] in other words John knew that if he was
[1:26:36] on the earth and uh he also among not
[1:26:40] the wise men but now John knew that if
[1:26:43] he was supposed to identify the Messiah
[1:26:47] and baptized the Messiah he has to be on
[1:26:50] the earth now it's just that I I don't
[1:26:53] know him yet uh and so he got to be on
[1:26:56] the earth now so the fact that that
[1:26:59] Elijah spirit and John was on the Earth
[1:27:02] was a sign that Messiah was on the earth
[1:27:07] when that Spirit comes back whether the
[1:27:10] man names William Branham or his Nam
[1:27:12] this or whatever name it is it happens
[1:27:15] to be William Marian Branham in our
[1:27:17] age then Messiah had to be on the Earth
[1:27:24] for him to be able to identify Christ
[1:27:27] amen for him to be able to reveal him in
[1:27:31] his own word amen oh praise God so we
[1:27:36] understand friends why if you go back

[1:27:41] the mystery of God being revealed

[1:27:53] not worthy to loosen his
[1:27:56] shoes when he makes himself
[1:27:59] known I can't do it and
[1:28:03] today I say he is standing amongst us he
[1:28:09] is here in the person of the Holy
