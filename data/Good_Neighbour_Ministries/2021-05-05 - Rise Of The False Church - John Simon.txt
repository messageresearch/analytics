TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] thanks be unto god for his marvelous gift of eternal life with joy become to draw water from the well of salvation may the lord jesus christ bless us tonight in a wonderful way as we delve into the seven church ages our particular study for tonight will be the rise of the false church i repeat the rise of the false church and our scripture is found in revelation chapter 2 reading from verse 14 to 15. together but i have a few things against thee because thou has there them that hold the doctrine of balaam who taught balak to cast a stumbling block before the children of israel to eat things sacrificed onto idols and to commit fornication so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the necrolytans which thing i hate let us pray a gracious god our heavenly father once again with the honor and privilege we come with boldness into the presence of god with the blood of jesus christ the righteousness of jesus christ the joy of jesus christ and the humility given unto us by the holy spirit that we may surrender ourselves for the hearing of the word receiving it with hearts that want to obey the word and live for and by the word to thee be all the praise the honor and the glory as we uh humiliate and humble ourselves father we lift you up and glorify your great and mighty name in jesus name we ask it amen and amen the rise of the false church now in this fergamus church age the lord has specifically taken the time to denounce two particular doctrines because those are the two things that he said i am against two things in the age of pergamos that god himself is letting the people of that age know that he hates it and he is against it and so he denounces these two major doctrines that we were being propagated at that particular time first the doctrine of balaam which introduced idolatry sinful excesses into the nation of israel and the doctrine of the nickelodeons which had been deeds in uh the ephesian church age has now that spirit that doctrine has now grown from its infancy and has come to a place where it's now going to change from deeds into a teaching for the word doctor it means teaching so doctrine means the teaching so we say doctrine of the church is the teaching doctrine of the word it's the teaching okay so here it is that god says this teaching of nickelodeonism these teachings of balaamism see now he hates them all and this when they're complained together like this it is emphasizing to us to be to to start be to recognize and to see why god identified pergamos as the seat where satan is because here is a collusion here is a here is a combination of two devilish false doctrines denounced by god himself because it was here at pardon us that the babylonian teachings that were propounded by nimrod who tried to form his own religion his mother uh his wife uh semiramis uh there as the woman in the picture he started to form his own religion with a mother and son with uh with himself to be worshipped as a god in babylon for as you know he was the founder of bay bell later babylon and from that later we got the god bail so on so here it is that the initial stages of it but now that spirit is growing in strength that teaching is growing in strength and now we see now it's trying to intermingle itself with original christianity just like the serpent did with eve in genesis trying to intermingle himself into the human race to pollute it to hybridize it to create confusion and chaos this is his purpose this is his idea this is what he is attempting to do and this is not just merely my assumption this is not merely the assumption scholars but it is also a historical fact that can be proved because when we go back to 36 a.d refined friends that that from 3680 actually to 60 uh 325 a.d when they had the council of nicaea we found that christians were at that time were mainly jews or jewish by birth and they were scattered from jerusalem because you remember how that james i believe james head was cut off and so the bible says and then were the believers scattered abroad so believers scattered and some ended up in rome but they were mainly jews okay so here they were from jerusalem now they're in in rome and they went everywhere preaching the gospel of the word of god particularly in the synagogues now about three years later we find two dear precious brothers apostles in christ uh preached the word in rome not peter but junius and also andronicious let me spell those names j u n i u s and andronicious a n d r o n i c u s you will find their names in romans chapter 18 chapter 16 verse 7 romans chapter 16 verse 7 where paul writes of them that there were apostles like himself also and so they went to rome and preached the word of god in the power of the holy spirit and there under their preaching the work of god flourished for several years until the constant altercations between the jews among themselves cause emperor claudius of that time to expel all jews from rome remember most of the jews were christians but there were jewish synagogues still teaching moses's faith and the doctrines and teachings of moses of the old testament now here comes this uh other group of jews from jerusalem on the inspiration of the revelation from jesus christ himself and they started preaching that in rome and in particular they went into the synagogues and began to preach it and of course that caused altercations argumentations debates stripes amongst the jews themselves and emperor claudius was very unhappy about this and so he expelled the jews from rome and banished them from the city and so therefore the backbone or the the foundation of faith of that little flock in rome itself was broken because the elders of the church being mainly jewish they were also banished juniors and dranices they were also banished and had to leave the city of rome remember they were the first christians to go into the city of rome and founded this church now they are expelled from that city of rome and remember the little flock that were already members of the synagogues and then got converted they remained in rome where they already lived the other ones had to leave but those ones that were originally there of course there were few and they were left unattended that is to say without an elder without a pastor you see the importance of having a pastor and not just saying you're a christian and having your bible and i can read at home and i can pray at home and i don't need nobody to tell me anything well god said in the church fivefold ministry of past of prophets and apostles and teachers and elders and administrators and so on it's there in the word of god book of ephesians and so it's important that sheep have a shepherd that churches have a leader a pastor or on the shepherd jesus christ above the pastor below and the pastor then has some helpers around him faithful men that will hold to god's word god's unchanging hand now remember the new testament was not yet written paul's letters were not written and put in this form that we read here now today so they had nothing to uh read every day or study every day or be able to as we have now uh digital and computers to listen to every day they had nothing at all and so philosophers of that day there were different kinds of philosophers of various tribes right of course where back in jerusalem and all over the empire there were stoics they were epicureans there were libertines there were many other groups of philosophers that were expounding all manner of ideas and there was pagans pagan priests pagan teachers that were teaching all manner of ungodly and unscriptural things so the grievous wolves were on the prowl they were now trying to encircle the little group the little church of god that was left there in rome trying to survive without any written word without any leadership or pastoral guidance they were left unattended because the leadership and other brothers and sisters were expelled out of the city of rome and so then the spirit of antichrist or the antichrist spirit took that as an opportunity to be released upon the people everywhere and we find out the little church in rome after consistent attacks of the drip and the dribble of this the attacks of the antichrist spirit it became a backslidden church that church became backslidden under the prevailing pressure and the constant knocks and hits and verbal and mental assaults that was made against it and so little by little it began to introduce pagan babylonian pagan ceremonies and rights within the christian church hiding it covering it up under christian titles oh my friends these names changed and hidden under christian titles let me not expand on that but you can take the your thought and take the word of god and think on these things now this period of banishment or expulsion ran for about uh 18 years for about 13 years and then we found that their founders the apostles junius andronicius and andre nishas came back they came back in 54 a.d imagine their horror imagine how horrified they were to discover that the christian church that they left that was christian was now woefully unhorribly pagan in its way and its action they found there were altars now in the church upon which altars that place incense was there in the church they found pagan rites were being celebrated and carried on within the church and when they tried to go to the leadership of the church that left behind that had now taken up these paganistic ceremonies rights and doings those leaders would not speak with them they would not have any contact with them they will take no advice nor word of god from them and unite them an audience together for discussion so with the few faithful to the word that remained that would not accept any of that they took those few believers that were still faithful to the word and started a new church so now my topic is the rise of the false church here we see the picture of two sons in the garden two vines two two two churches the false church and the true church for here now these brothers are starting a new church or a second church remember they had started the first one it started under genuine christianity but got hybridized and mixed with babylonian rites and ceremonies and the titles of their gods and goddesses were covered up by using christian names and christian titles upon them which the real believers could not stand and so by separating themselves unwillingly but they had to do it junius and andronicius founded also the second church of rome and god began to work amongst them in a mighty way with various signs and wonders and confirmations and authentications of the truth of the word of god that was being declared displayed and demonstrated by the evidence of the presence of the holy spirit of the living god amongst them and so the church second church was started a third church was also started but let's speak of the first and the second church now this first church was reproached rebuked for being pagan and not christian in its worship and still they would not give up their evil way contrary to the word of god and they refused to give up the title of being the first church of rome you see for their word of first church of rome founded by genuine apostles juniors and andronicious but then after their expulsion the church left by itself backslid it slid backwards it slid into paganism babylonianism philosopher philosophic teachings all manner of esoteric beliefs and were taken off into vain mysteries of the world and of the pagan uh culture of that particular time and so they refused to give up their title of being the first church of rome and remain and still remains to this very day they hold on to that title of first church of rome and of course we know it today in our modern times as the roman catholic church now the majority of us have this mistaken idea that any and all and everybody who just call themselves christians would be the target of the devil but that's not so because you may call yourself a christian but you will you may really be a a servant a slave of the devil and the devil knows his own and the devil will make a way for his own and so we find that government government tyranny persecution and trial my friends we expect to come against the real true church but the false church knows how to ingratiate itself how to insinuate itself intertwine along with the government and its officials and so it began to grow in numbers it began to thrive or succeed it began to grow in every possible way and they began to have influence with the with emperors various officials of the time uh of the government and so emperors and officials began to favor that particular so-called first church of rome let me repeat it was and still is and it is the truth when they make the claim that they are the first church of rome for indeed they are founded not by peter but by junius and andronicious there it is later the backslid from off the word of god right that backslid from the word of god into babylonianism paganism and all manner of false ceremonies and false forms of worship so now they found themselves in favor with the government with the officials of the day they used that as their opportunity to turn the government against the true believers that were holding to the word of god of course the true believers turn to be in little homes little churches uh here there in caves which i have personally visited some in rome itself uh visited there and so believers were scattered and had to even hide to really worship god and so these officials began to favor the first church because they had bigger buildings bigger numbers they had great uh colorful services colorful processions that will captivate the mind the eye the sight the sound the smell all the five senses satan knows how to manipulate it all and he uses the colors the sound the bells the smells and everything else to captivate to capture the minds of the people and be able to slip in all of his false teachings as if it's real in the name of christ untrue to the word of god but doing it in the name of christ while what the the persons or people are really being fed is babylonian religion disguised with christian words christian names and in the name of the christian faith and so here it is they turned the government against the true believers and demanded their persecution i just want to interject something is very careful because we see here whenever a church begins to grow in science whenever the pastor of that church starts to have some influence with hundreds thousands of people that is like a magnet for politicians and politicians in every way will seek some way how they can gain influence with that pastor with that church so when it comes for their election they can now manipulate those people they manipulate the public with various ways uh in in third world countries they'll manipulate the people with drink with drugs with food with chicken in every pot with the bottle for every person and stuff like that oh yes my friends that's what would happen but politicians practically they look at the numbers they analyze it and then they begin to play on it and see how how they can influence it therefore we need to be very careful and very watchful and vigilant about these things now i'm not saying every politician is evil i'm just saying in general when politics begins to introduce itself in the church we must be vigilant and watchful because i know of wonderful christian man and actually as i stand here speaking to you i can say with confidence i know personally and speak just like maybe about two weeks ago speaking with the president of a country of two presidents of two countries and they're christian men and so i'm not saying every politician but politics as a whole it's not really of god it's of the devil now we find out back to my subject here how that once this church gained favor it began to influence the government the government in turn wanting the numbers the influence the beauty and the system of that particular uh so-called christian faith or religion to use it and to have its power behind them they aligned themselves with it and began to persecute the genuine christians now my friends at that time the first bishop of that church of rome his name was anecetus e n i c e t u s and he lived in the second century bishop of the first church of rome and was a contemporary to polycarp the great servant of god no polycarp by this time was old and venerable but he took the time to travel for 1500 miles to return to rome to see if he could speak to anesthetists and to convince them or convince him and them that they had wandered away from the word of god he implored with them to change he went to visit the churches i mean the churches of the first church of rome and the one that had backslidden not the first church of christianity as might be suggested or claimed because the first church was already there started by the holy ghost himself on the day of pentecost we're talking about after that time the backsliding took place when the jews were expelled out of rome and the few that remained were under assault by philosophy by babylonian mysteries influenced by pagan theories and teachings and backslid off of the word of god and they are the first church of rome alone amen get that lie out of your mind first church of rome not of christianity yes that is true so polycarp traveled 1500 miles came back to rome tried to speak to anacetus tried to speak to the church he went to the church and what did he see to his surprise he saw them prostrating themselves before images which the book of exodus god tells us you shall not make any graven image thou shalt not bow down to them nor serve them for i the lord thy god am a jealous god nevertheless polycarp witnessed it with his own eyes that these people were claiming to be christians claiming to be believers but yet were bowing down and prostrating themselves to idols idol's named with the name of those apostles named after various christians bowing down to them he saw also them lighting candles in the church he saw them burning incense he saw them celebrating the passover and they changed the name and began to call it easter which we do use this very name today i as a believer no you i use the word easter too but i know really what is behind it and you ought to know also for the word easter really comes from the name of astarte that is the wife of nimrod that's another name for semoramus astarte and out of that easter don't be deceived it doesn't come from esther that is jewish but easter that is pagan it really comes from the name of astarte now watch it now we celeb we do celebrate easter if you want to call it that but we celebrated recognizing the blood of christ what he did for us how he died for us but that's a topic for another day or another time now here it is friends they celebrated that and what do they do they also bring in a cross but with the cross in the church they elevate a round disc which is a symbol of the s-u-n god they elevate the disc claiming that is the bread that must be broken and they even give you that in a wafer on your tongue a round disc like that and cause the people to use that and that is really honoring the sun god uh if you will look behind a lot of these altars somewhere or sometimes they'll have it on a pole the sun burst you'll see the form of a sun with rays going out in every direction that's what that is all about honoring and worshiping this sun god and then they'll pour out some wine claiming communion but the the last of the wine they'll pour it on the ground which was a they were pouring it on the ground which was a libation to those pagan gods of that particular time and polycarp was so distressed he turned to leave and as he was about to leave the voice of god spoke through him with the spirit of prophecy saying ephraim is married to his idols leave him alone let him alone and polycarp left and never returned to rome following an anastasius was a wicked bishop of rome called victor and he introduced into the church even more pagan festivals and ceremonies into that first church and he also made a great effort to go to the real or second christian church of rome to convince them to come back into a unity or oneness with him the false church they refuse and they would not do what he requested and so he went to the government and prevailed upon the government to persecute those believers who would dare to refuse to join themselves along with him oh and so the government started on a campaign where they dragged a lot of them into the courts cast many of them into prisons and even taking many of them to their debts oh vile what examples of his vile deeds can be found by reading history where emperor sekimus severus was prevailed upon by callistus the a friend of victor to kill seven thousand believers true believers at thessalonica there it was thessalonian because the these true believers refused to carry out the passover the way that these pagans did with their with their disc their sun burst of their sun god of course they will not tell you that it's just an emblem oh it's just something we have in the church it doesn't mean that that's it but the believers refused to bow down to it they refused to serve it they refused to recognize it and instead they carried out the lord's supper the way we do with the breaking of the bread the drinking of the wine amen and of prayers together in the name of the lord and not according to the way they wanted them to worship astarte worship the sun and the sun god so already we can see the false vine was killing the true vine turning its anger against the living god by destroying and killing the elect of that particular day even as kane killed a bell notice carefully here i want to make a parallel for here we see this first church founded by junius and adrenacious first church and it turned into a false church even so cain from the same mother with abel but by a different father which was the serpent who stood upright and was like a man but had no soul and she bore these twins cain and abel one of adam one of the serpent just as these apostles bore these two churches one my friends of the devil one of babylonianism and one of the true and the living god and by his word and just as cain was angry against god and killed his own brother the same spirit is now in that same church angry against its brothers and will even stir up the government to kill to hinder to stop his own brother watch watch cain's altar with flowers with fruits with everything else the bible says beautiful look at the contrast with abel simple humble killing a lamb and stressing this talk about the blood of christ the blood of the lamb back there it was in type but now we have the reality and see we i'm trying to show you it's the same spirit down through thousands of years present here today in our time in our day here upon the earth the true church of course tried to get the false church to repent to turn from its wicked ways and it would not do so and it would do so why because it was increasing in size increasing in influence see that's what they call success that's another topic for another time they don't know what real good real success is but then uh they grew in size and they started on the campaign to discredit and to belittle the true church building their great big ostentatious buildings so that when you have a little place to worship in that looks like a barn that looks like a that's nothing as far as they're concerned and that's how they uh belittle the true church and discredit it and belittle a true seed and be began to claim that they were the only true representatives of the lord jesus christ as they're claiming now that they are the only true representative of the lord jesus christ not in rome but here on earth they believe and teach such which is false against the word of god amen and so here's the bitter difference arising amongst them amen because they were they continue to claim to this day that they are the first church and that is undisputed it is the truth they are the first church that was founded in rome that is to say the first pentecostal church the first original church to backslide from the word of god and into evil and sin contrary to the word of god oh my dear friends we see now the churches began to have bitter differences amongst them departing some departing from the truth marrying themselves to idols having no life in them whatsoever hybrid dies taking the wrong seed to produce something half christianity half world half christianity half pagan half christianity half wrapped up with all manner of evil that we can see upon the earth of god amen and here we find out friends powerful in our numbers of her membership powerful in influence she is powerful and favored and loved by the high and mighty of this world and the other group they are persecuted they are counted as sheep to be slaughtered by these evil sayings doings attacks and undercover belittlings and discrediting by this wicked system that will come against the true church of the living god amen but thank god amongst this persecuted group the sick are healed the word is preached hallelujah the holy ghost falls upon the people and is alive with the word of god and demonstrations and interpretation of the word of the living god thank god the people of this group this true church they loved their own lives but not more than the word of god hallelujah and they hold his name and all to his faith and they will the bible says be faithful unto death and i will give you a crown of life may the great holy spirit give to every one of us that holds to god's eternal word and walls to the truth of the promised word of this day grant to us a crown of life that fadeth not away joy peace love and the grace of god be upon you amen i'll meet you in the morning when the lord jesus does come again we'll meet here next this coming sunday when will be mother's day and we would like to address that from the point of view of the word of god may the lord bless us all as we come together may i say the saints please stay with me as i declare to you from the word and from history these things that are true you may say oh i read that before oh i heard that i know that oh let me tell you there's always something fresh new and expressive coming out of the word of god and you need to pay attention to this none of us is a new at all i am learning god is revealing and making known his word to me even though i've read it 40 50 times the next time something new is there so let's open our minds open our hearts be receptive and receive the blessing of god for your day and time god bless you [Music] everyone [Music] you
