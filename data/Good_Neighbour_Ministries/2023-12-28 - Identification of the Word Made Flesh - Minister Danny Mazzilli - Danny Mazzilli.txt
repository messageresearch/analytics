not but if you were you could have said at the beginning of 2023 that really um the chances of the Bride of Jesus Christ being here at the stroke of midnight on 20123 2024 was probably slim yet here we are but what an amazing year huh Hallelujah it just moved everything right into line so here we are what are we going to say all we can say is we are the generation amen the last generation there

God bless you brother Mike thank you for the song service praise God forever more we are happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight praise God how many are having uh a good rest through the uh holiday season I know a lot of uh businesses are shut down and you get an opportunity to kind of uh pull back a little bit I know there's a lot of work around you know hosting and so forth we just hosted our entire family we had about 20 people at our home on Monday for Christmas and boy there was a lot of food a lot of a lot of Fellowship a lot of um fun with the with our great nephews that are here from Sweden we had a really good time Christmas uh is special when there's little little ones around amen it just um they get so excited and uh so we were happy to have them but boy what a lot of work praise God it's a full day you know right to the end of the day and nonstop and by the grace of God you get through it the next day you're just but praise God we have the strength of the lord we have his grace we have the power of prayer we have the ability to know that um he becomes our strength when we get weak and so uh we're privileged to have that fellowship and that relationship ship with the Creator himself praise God what a wonderful thing it is amen praise God so tonight we're going to kind of continue along in um in the similar uh thought uh we've been we've been um looking at um seeing our part in the word of God and um through it all we've been looking at uh many aspects of understanding you know our position in the word of God and how God has uh called us for a purpose that we all have a placing in the word that it's important that we start to recognize especially as we mature um you know we start to feed on the meat of God's word we start to mature and we start to realize that there is something very purposeful in the calling of God in our individual lives amen and that uh purpose must become a reality must become perfect in your understanding in the Revelation that God is giving us because that is what is going to give us rapturing faith that is what is going to provide the quickening power um in this day and in this hour which we're now experiencing we're already being quickened by the word of God Amen praise God so in that um in that series uh tonight we want to look at identification of the word made flesh that's what we want to take a look at we want to we don't know how far we're going to get tonight but we're GNA just allow the holy spirit to guide us and Inspire us and I'm trusting that you came with some sort of expectation in your heart because this is this is vital when you come into the house of the Lord you must come knowing and expecting that you're going to hear from God Amen this is the relationship you know when you go to meet with somebody you're going to meet with that person because you're going to communicate you're going to commune with them and you're going to enter into their thoughts and they're going to express their thoughts and you're going to express yours so as we are ministering tonight and as as the word is coming forth you you speak back you you you say Amen you say yes Lord that's me you identify with the word of God and then all of a sudden deep starts to call to the deep and the deep starts to respond and all of a sudden this becomes more of a reality this is not just a a gathering tonight of individuals this is a gathering of the mystical Supernatural body of Jesus Christ amen praise God and so we want to identify with the word of God Amen let's look at our scripture tonight first scripture is from Ephesians chapter 5 vers 25- 28 we're going to take our time and we're going to let the Holy Spirit just uh show to us exactly how we are now uh the word made flesh in this day and we can identify with it amen husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word I pay attention here that he might present it to who to himself that he might present it to himself amen a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish now is it possible that you as a human being could fulfill this scripture and be completely holy and without blemish in this hour and in this this day it's not possible as a human but as a Son of God and as an attribute of God and as a plan that God has has had in the back of his mind from before the foundations of the world it's going to happen and it is possible and it's going to happen but it's not going to happen by us looking at one another and looking at at one another's uh ability to become perfect in this flesh you're never going to do it that's why the scripture says we shall be changed hallelujah praise God you're going to need a change you're going to need to be translated and this body that's mortal needs to put on immortality so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself praise God let's pray pray father we just so appreciate your spirit and your anointing upon the word of God lord we know that without it Lord these just become written words in a book but because your spirit gives it life it becomes the living manifestation of the word of God and it becomes more real to us than anything else it sets us apart from the rest of this world as individuals called by the victory that comes in Jesus Christ father we commit this service tonight we commit each and every one Lord remember those that are at home that are watching online may your anointing move and speak and and direct and deliver and heal and do a mighty work because it's all you father we will give you the glory and the praise in Jesus name amen amen praise God you may be seated Hallelujah imagine that you know the scripture says here that he that loveth his wife loveth himself you know um we're going to look at this a little more as as we as we move through it but um you know we've got some thoughts here that we want to bring in its in in the right time here but you know in the next scripture in the in the Book of Genesis chapter 2 we want to look here in order for us to truly understand The Plan of Redemption and to fully understand how it is that we are the body of Jesus Christ that we are the bride of Christ that we are actually now the living manifestation of the word made flesh in our day it we need to we need to first get the history behind it we need to see why God had this plan and why he's going to fulfill it and how it is that we are going to be the word in our day and how it is that we are the word made flesh in our day amen in Genesis 2: 21- 24 it says and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God hath taken from man made he a woman that's why it's she's called woman because she was taken from the womb of the man amen praise God and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of the man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh praise God I want you to know here tonight that the Plan of Redemption that started from before the foundations of the world had a plan and you were a part of that plan you were in Adam before the foundations of the world you were in Christ before the foundations of the world you were in Elohim the self-existent one you were a part of God you were always a part of God you were always a part of his plan you're you're you're you're you're part you're you're co-partner with God in the Fulfillment of this Plan of Redemption there was never a time that you were not a part of God and if Adam took from his side a rib and created the woman and it says here that they too shall be one flesh that means that Adam and Eve were one God called their name Adam amen praise God so Adam and Eve are the same person Adam is Eve Eve is Adam because they two were one flesh God is expressing everything in in a in a spiritual form everything that that we read through the scriptures from Genesis all the way down to revelation God has this mystery in the word of God and it's all about him expressing himself him condescending down from the beginning of time you know before the fall took place there was no time because God is eternal God didn't need time time was a result of sin time was the result of the Fall he said the day you eat thereof ye shall surely die let's look at the next scripture we want to look at Genesis chapter 3 and we want to see where all of this started here and we want to have a clear understanding how it is that God has has given us Dominion God has given us a position in the body of Christ that that gives us full Authority remember everything is being restored back back to the original amen Adam Eve and the Earth everything being restored and remember when Adam and Eve were were were placed in the garden originally God gave them dominion over the entire Earth God gave him dominion over everything whatever he named the animals that's what it was if he would ask a tree to be moved it would have to obey it would move everything was by the spoken word everything was was in the Supernatural God was a Creator all he had to do was speak it and it would come to pass amen praise God but there was a there was a a a a part of the plan now you need to understand that a whole part of the plan that he had in the back of his mind from before the foundations of the world included Redemption it included the fall everything that we are that that that that we are reading here in the scripture God already had it in the back part of his mind he knew exactly what was going to happen but remember we're here on free moral agency God placed them on free moral agency that's why he said the DAT you the day you eat thereof you shall surely die so let's read it here now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made we know that the serpent is the devil it's not a snake Okay this is Bible study so we're going to hit on things that are going to expose certain things and we're trusting that you know as people uh you know listen in on these messages uh we're we're looking for for for Sons and Daughters of God that are that are under some spiritual Amnesia that are caught under the the the world systems that are you know they may be caught under a den denominational uh uh uh chain they may be caught under certain doctrines of man and and the preaching of the word faith cometh by hearing and by hearing of the word of God and we're looking to set captives free amen praise God we want to we want to see people get delivered praise the Lord Jesus so as we're ministering here as we're reading we're going to just interject certain things and he said unto the woman ye hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden now listen Satan knew exactly what God told Eve why is he coming to her and saying oh has God said he knew exactly what God said that's why he's going there to try and tempt her and to beguile her and to deceive her you got to watch that the devil he's the same today he's going to come to you he's going to say oh did did oh did God actually send a prophet oh oh did did God actually open the Seven Seals oh did did you know do you understand what I'm saying you're not to bow down you're you're to stay with the word of God Amen that's what this eve the the difference between the Eve that fell and the Eve that's in this day which is the bride of Christ the True Church of God is she will not be deceived she will not be beguiled she cannot and I and we're going to see why it's impossible for her to be beguiled praise God so he's he's telling her had God said that you can't you know talk to me you know I'm going to elaborate and the woman said unto the serpent we can eat of the fruit of the trees we can Fellowship in the garden we can talk you know with the with the trees because you know you've heard the scripture by their fruit you shall know them trees were were known as uh people in the Garden of Eden Trees of Righteousness the you know trees there there's uh you know you know and and the fruit is what what those trees bring forth that's why that by their fruit you shall know them you shall know what what they're saying so you can always know if somebody really has the Holy Ghost by the fruit that that they speak when they speak about the word of God Amen and so but but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden which is you you're you're the deceiver okay because you're the tree that knows both both good and evil all right right now I'm elaborating here okay but she wasn't aware of that at at that moment God had said we shall not eat of it neither shall we touch it lest you die and the serpent said unto the woman you're not going to die he was you know because he had an understanding of God he knew God was eternal he knew that God you know uh uh was perfect there there there's nothing but but he also knew that if God said something and you went against God then God had to honor his word amen and that's why when God told them if you eat of that tree you shall surely die and die was was separation from God you're going to lose that connection with me okay but remember that connection was lost and it was lost all for a purpose amen so ye shall not uh either tell okay for God doth know that so he's saying her no no you're not going to die for goth doth know that in the day that you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as Gods you know Satan wanted to pervert because remember Satan wanted to be worshiped as God and the only way that Satan could be worshiped as God was that if he got others to fall to fall into sin and to rebel against God God anybody that worships Satan it's because they don't worship God that's why Jesus said seek first the kingdom of God and all righteousness will be added unto you everything else that you have need of will be given to you all that you need but the moment that you're beguiled the moment that you're you're you're you're against God and you're you're following Satan and you allow Satan to control your mind and to turn you away from the word of God now you start to worship Satan and that's what he wanted he wanted so he says the only way I can get the people to to worship me is I'm GNA have to I'm gonna have to deceive God's children I'm gonna have to deceive God's children imagine the attributes of God you can't deceive God's children but because they were created and they were placed into this this Garden under free moral agency they they had the ability to make decisions and God knew that Eve would make the wrong decision praise God for God doth know and when the woman verse six saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes in a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat now we know that it wasn't fruit that she gave him that he gave her and that she partook of that fruit and ate the apple it's not an apple it has nothing to do with with with with an apple it was adultery Satan came to her because he needed to beguile he needed to create he wanted something that he could create he' seen that God had spoken uh you know uh Adam into existence in his own image taken Eve from his side spoken her her and and and created her from Adam he saw that God was creating his family and Satan was jealous he wanted to have his own family and he knew that God had said let every seed bring forth of its own kind so so the so the Beast the the serpent who was who who actually is the missing link to this very day all right scien is trying to figure out they're looking for ape that looks like a man that they're never going to find that Missing Link because that Missing Link was actually the serpent he was so much and so close to man that he was able to talk and actually make love with Eve in the Garden of Eden and that's where she got pregnated by uh by the serpent seed amen praise God and so it was not an apple it was an adultery it was it was a a a the serpent beguiling Eve to make love to her so that he could impregnate her with his own seed so that he could create a race of people that could that that he could have to worship Him amen praise God so go to the next verse um oh boy sorry I know it's up there but I just uh and so from verse um 3 uh or chapter 3: 7-12 let's read here so he says and the eyes of them both were open now remember Adam he she went to Adam she told Adam what she had done she says you got to do this you got to try this you you know this is this is incredible she experienced the Euphoria of uh of sexuality and you know she went to ad Adam now Adam knew exactly what she did but Adam being Christ Adam being being in that understanding and in the image of God he knew exactly what she did he understood what she did so so he made himself sin we've we've heard that he he didn't have to become sin but he but let's read it and the eyes of them were were both opened and they knew that they were naked and they sowed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and they heard the voice of the Lord God Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord that's what sin does When sin comes into your life all of a sudden you want to hide you don't want to come to church that's why you'll notice people when they fall into sin if you see somebody that's that you know they're they're they're in church and then you don't see them for a for a you know for a period of time and you're wondering where are they what's going on it's because sin has got a hold of them unbelief has got a hold of them they listen there's no other place that we should be but in the house of the Lord now we understand there's times when you're sick you're working you're you know all these things that's perfectly normal but when you're you're you know you're you're you're inconsistent you're not consistent with God you're not consistent with the ministry you're not supporting the ministry regularly you've got you know all these different excuses because sin has got a hold of you and you start to hide you can't come into the presence of God because you know that the that the preaching you know which is the Holy Ghost himself is going to start to uh find you out and and and deal with that situation in your life praise God but that's what you need you need to come into the house of the Lord you need to be assembled here you need to join together especially even more so as this day is approaching where where the the the Sons and Daughters of God are actually becoming the mystical Supernatural body of Jesus Christ literally you wonder what I don't need to be in church I don't need to go to CH I can watch it online you need to assemble you need to be one with the other you need to move together into Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Christ why does Christ need to preach then why why do we need the foolishness of preaching why do we need it because in this day and in this hour and in this Dimension God is going to speak line upon line precept upon precept and you being in the presence of God and you being that part of God that has a purpose you you you you've got a purpose in being in the in the body of Christ when you're not when you're listen when when when we're missing individuals that are pillars in the house of the Lord we we're we're affected by it we get encouraged when we see the the Sons and Daughters of God Gathering Together pulling on the word feeding in the Supernatural realm allowing the word to to purge them cleanse them because this is how the the green gets baked out of us the green gets baked out by the word coming and speaking and and and Discerning and and and and uh delivering you from the situations and the circumstances of your own human elements the things that that that you struggle with every day as a human being you need to come you need to be delivered you need to receive the word the word of God will deliver you praise God Amen Hallelujah and so you know we uh they they they were hiding from God and and they were they were uh hiding themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the Trees of the garden and the Lord God called onto Adam and said Where Art Thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid afraid because I was naked and I hid myself you see when when when sin comes in you know you're you're you realize that that God you know he's he knows all things you know that God knows your situation there's nothing that you can hide from God Amen praise God you might as well settle it right now praise God if you want to move on with God you need to know that you're naked before God hallelujah God knows your life God knows your beginning God knows your End Amen so you might as well settle it right now and just say Lord I give up I Surrender I'm coming to you have your way with me have your way with my life Place me in the body of Christ do with me and use me as you see fit glory to God that's what he's looking for amen and so and he said who told thee that thou was naked hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou should us not eat and the man said the woman whom thou gavest to be with me me she gave me of the tree and I did eat he was very very conscious of exactly what he did let's look at this quote here he typed himself this is from Christ The Mystery of God revealed there's a lot of quotes and a lot of um I've drawn from you know this this message from Brother brandham Christ The Mystery of God revealed like I said go back listen to it read it it's it's tremendous there's so much in there that God is bringing to light and you know as we grow and as we mature and uh you know grow in Christ the word becomes like a new book every day because this is the Living God this is the present Living God Amen praise God he typed himself in Adam knowing what was right but walked out to redeem his wife Adam knew exactly what was right Adam knew that God said that you shall not eat of that tree Adam knew exactly what he was doing but Adam also knew that there was no way that she could die there was no way that he could kill her why because remember what we said she came from him she was him expressed Eve is Adam expressed there was no way that he could go and kill him and kill himself Christ didn't have to be sin he didn't have to be sin but he became sin because he knew that his word could not be broken the day you eat thereof ye shall surely die and it was from that point on that that the human race and everything on Earth began to die it had a beginning from that point and it would have an end because of the sin because of the Fall praise God and so he walked out and took sin to redeem his Lost Child amen Christ himself became sin he knew what Eve had done she deserved death but there was no way that he could kill her because she was him she was an expression of him praise God his own word Eve was Christ and he could not kill her because she was him expressed Hallelujah but you see we need to understand that there's a Plan of Redemption in order for this to all make sense we need something that that that brings all the scripture and all the purpose and the plan of God there needs to be an understanding of the Plan of Redemption in order for all of this to actually make sense for us uh in this day and in this hour as Christians and give us a a purpose and a and a reality of God of why it is that we serve God Amen praise God forever more The Plan of Redemption is what makes it all clear the mystery of Christ is that he always knew us he always knew that we were in him he always knew that we that that we were going to be expressed at a certain time and season in a certain dispensation in the word of God now let's go to the next uh uh slide I want to continue in Ephesians 29:33 because for here here here is where it makes it clear for no man ever hated his own flesh there's no way that Jesus Christ could hate Eve but nourisheth it and cherisheth even as the Lord the church so that's why your your Redemption and your salvation comes with no condition you're Justified you you you're you're already Justified you're already glorified you you're already perfect in the eyes of God all you need to do is believe and surrender to the word of God and let the spirit of God take possession and control of your life so that it can manifest the purpose that God placed in you to manifest so here he says uh um even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body and I want you to see here because we're going to something here members of his body of his flesh and his bones remember Adam said she's Flesh of My Flesh bone of my bone it's because she was actually an expression of Jesus Christ Christ condescending and coming into this world and into this dimension in order to fulfill the Plan of Redemption makes him and gives him the ability to actually possess you as a son or daughter of God because you are an attribute of God there's a portion of God inside of you and so you are actually the body of his flesh and of his bones amen for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh so if you're in Christ like we claim that we're in Christ we got the Holy Ghost if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you it's going to Quicken your mortal body that same spirit is quickening you that same spirit is what's operating through you that same spirit is what's living through you and that same spirit is what's making and bringing the the interpretation of the word made flesh in this day Hallelujah they shall be they too shall be one flesh now this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the bride and the church remember the mystery was always in the back part of God's mind before Adam was created in the image of God God already had in the back part of his mind that this was going to be a plan and a and there would be a mystery that would be wrapped up in his plan and that mystery would only be unveiled in the days of the voice of the seventh angel all these Mysteries would be unveiled that's why God had to send a prophet amen praise God so we need to understand that there's a mystery that God is unveiling in this day and in this hour and that you're part of that mystery that you're a part of that body that you're a supernatural living mystical flesh and Bone body of Jesus Christ and when we come together we are literally Christ in Bride form fulfilling the word that's the only one that's going to take the Rapture remember it's only Christ and those that are quickened by the word in the moment in the twinkling of an eye you can't go in the Rapture unless you are the body of Jesus Christ so he's talking here about the mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband this is absolutely required in the body of Christ a True Believer somebody that has a revelation of their position in the word of God knowing that that's why we are baptized because we're taking his name remember everything that we do in word or deed or anything that we do as as human beings if we are expressing Christ then we're going to do everything thing that the word tells us we're going to fulfill the scripture when we get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we take on his name we are identifying ourselves as his bride that we are the obedient Eve now we're not the disobedient churches that that want to take the word of God put their own man-made traditions on it and and and make it fit their lives instead of their lives fitting to the word people want to just live any way they want they want to put an interpretation on God's word that they can live any way anyhow but they don't want to come according to the word of God but when we get identified by baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it shows that we are outwardly expressing the Revelation that we know that we are in Christ that we are taking his name that we are in the body of Christ we are identifying as the manifested word of God for this day and in this hour and when we do that we manifest the word made flesh and that's why we go to the baptism amen praise God hallelujah next look notice this brother Braham saying here he says but God fornew the bride in the groom God knew the bride was in the groom God knew that that that that his his Eve his restored Eve was was there it was going to come perfect amen God forsaw the bride in the groom Hallelujah see to save his wife like Adam he had to go with her Adam knowed what he was doing Eve didn't know what she was doing but Adam walked out with his wife amen she went into a spiritual Amnesia she she fell into a disbelief she fell into sin just like you we're the bride of Christ and we've always been the bride of Christ but when we came into this Dimension we fell into sin we were born in sin shaped in iniquity we were we were under an Amnesia we were we didn't know who we really were we heard about church we heard about Jesus Christ we heard about about salvation we did the the the doctrines of man we did the traditions of man if you're a Roman Catholic you would go through all the you know baptizing as a baby which is totally unscriptural first communion first communion you know when your first communion is is when you're born again and you receive the Holy Ghost and the spirit of God comes upon you and you have a supernatural communion with God not because of some tradition where you take you know kids at at the age of 10 or 11 and they and and they go for first communion it's you know what it's it's all it's all rituals it's all religious rituals they appear good and you know they seem good and you know they're they're teaching you know they're teaching from the Bible they teach the Bible but it's not the word of God it's not God's provided way a baby cannot repent there's no way a baby can repent the Bible says repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they baptized into the titles of Father Son and Holy Ghost because they have a trinitarian understanding of God making him three in one God is not three in one God is one there's only one God so all of these Traditions amen but Adam knew and know what he was doing Eve didn't know what she was doing but Adam walked out with his wife see and Jesus took his wife's place and became sin for her remember he became you he stood in your punishment that you might stand in his place amen God had to come down that's why you know you talk about Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved and you tell people you need to believe Jesus Christ as your savior you need to accept him because he's the one that paid the price he's the one that went to Calvary and took sin upon himself just like Adam he took that sin sin upon himself because he knew that if he put the sin on himself and he covered Eve that Eve could not die Eve Eve would not be destroyed his bride would not be lost amen praise God that's why you can't be lost you cannot you you cannot be lost God has already ordained it from the foundations of the world your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life you heard the word and you know Faith cometh by hearing and you were a sheep and you heard your Shepherd and you heard his word and you obeyed the word of God Amen you had no choice because it made perfect sense to you it's who you are amen praise God he stood your punishment that you might stand in his place he stood in your place that you might stand in his place what a love what a fellowship amen praise God Allelujah next slide listen here now I thank God that we had a prophet because I'll tell you something you know if we hadn't had the prophet of Malachi 4:5 if God hadn't sent us a prophet there's no way we could be bringing out these these Eternal truths because God was was operating through William Branham amen praise God he was operating through William Branham to um let me read something here now listen closely here understand that brother Branham there was there was a Ministry of Malachi 45 but it was all Christ Revelations 10:7 it was all Christ remember the word of God comes to the prophet amen praise God we need to put the prophet in his proper place amen the word word of God needs to be properly placed so that we can understand this has always been Jesus Christ listen to brother Bram he says now I want you to know this this this is sure and you that listen to the to this tape you might have thought today this is from the message anointed ones at the end time he says you might have thought today that I was trying to say that about myself being that I was packing this message because brother Brandon was talking about you know the supernatural that was taking place and how it was happening in his ministry and how the Supernatural and how he could discern the thoughts and the intents of the heart listen what he's saying here he says he says packing that that being that I was packing this message you know you're packing a message in this hour brother brandham was packing a message in his day amen but he had a he had a prophetic message he was the prophet of Malachi 45 he was the prophet of of of Revelations 10:7 he was Luke 17:30 amen praise God we need to realize and recognize his position in the word of God but it was all Christ and look what he says here I have no more to do with it than nothing no more than just a voice he says and my voice even against my better judgment I wanted to be a Trapper but it's the will of my father that I declare to do and determine to do I wasn't the one that appeared down on the river I was only standing there when when he appeared hallelujah praise God I'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens as perfect as they are I'm only one that's near when he does it I was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what I knew it's what I just surrendered myself to that he spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that God unfolded it's not a man it's God the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ he is the one that you're feeding on H Allelujah that's what we're feeding on here tonight amen we're not feeding on a man we're not feeding on man's theology man's teachings we're not feeding we're feeding on the on the body word of Jesus Christ and there's only one way you can feed on that and that is by revelation God has to reveal to you what he's saying in his word God has to reveal to you your part in the word God has to reveal to you that you are the word made flesh in this hour it's not something that you can because brother brandham says it you you you you believe it and that and then you are it no no it's because God said so it's because God's God's vindicating it from his word and then he's vindicating it through a prophet and if you go back and you and you listen to the messages of William brandom you go back and you study the life of William brandom you will see the supernatural was there was more supernat natural in his ministry now I'm not saying this to to to you know to say that he was more than Jesus Christ but he produced more Supernatural raising of the Dead healing of the sick uh Discerning of spirits in 1100 tapes from 1933 all the way to 1965 there's 1100 tapes if anybody does their study and does their research they will see that it was a man that was being Vindicated by the supernatural God that the voice that was speaking through William brandom was the voice of God when he was under that anointing to discern their hearts discern their lives bring the teachings on the scriptures bring the opening of those Seven Seals brother brandham didn't open those Seven Seals hallelujah it's the mighty Angel himself it was Christ it was the Holy Spirit the mighty Angel come down put his foot on the ocean put his foot on the land and on the sea and said time shall be no more there would be no more time there would be no more ages it was now going to enter into the Eternal age we were going to come under a supernatural age where there was going to become a supernatural bride was going to come into full view Hallelujah Christ was going to fulfill his purpose and his plan and if you go back and you listen to those messages you will hear the Vindication of God you will see the supernatural you will know that it was not a man that could possibly say those things tell people where they lived where they came from pray over the dead and raised right there in front of the people that was only Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that could possibly do that you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man amen praise God hallelujah thank you Jesus glory to God Amen thank you Jesus now I wna I wna um continue here praise the Lord Jesus so you can um you can go to the next slide okay and I'm just I've got notes here and I've got some other quotes we're going to continue from here another five minutes and then we'll we'll continue this later on because we're we're we're we're coming somewhere we're getting you know this is just is all laying in the foundation we need to understand the that you know who we are why Christ is manifesting himself in the word made flesh in this hour in each and every son and daughter of God that's that's a me M of the body but here in in questions and answers on the seals okay back in 1963 brother Brown gets a question is the bride of Christ and the body of Christ the same yes sir see now here now see I don't want to get started on it because I get and preach a sermon on it see but I won't do that but I want to show you when God gave adam his bride from his side he said she is Flesh of My Flesh and bone of my bone is that right when God give Christ his bride the spirit gave the flesh the bride the SP I'm going to repeat that the spirit gave the flesh the bride he was plush pierced in the side under his heart and water blood and Spirit came forth that become flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone we are the Flesh and Bones the bride will be the Flesh and Bones of Christ exactly they are that is his bride when we assemble when we come together when we Fellowship on the word of God when we come under this anointing and this atmosphere fear and we recognize our positions in Christ and we know that God called us to be in the body of Christ that God gave us individual gifts within the body that we might fulfill our destiny our purpose and our plan we are literally the blood we are literally the Flesh and bone of Jesus Christ coming together the blood is the Holy Ghost that's what we have in common that brings us into that mystical body but you as attributes of God you as daughters and sons of God when you join and when you come into this church into this local body there's many membered bodies all over there's many different churches but they are under this Revelation remember this this is the message that that that that has been sent to us in our day that brings together the True Church the true mystical Supernatural body of Jesus Christ comes together and is brought together by the message of this hour and the message of this hour is not that God sent to profit that is a part of the message but the message of the hour is that Jesus Christ the same yesterday today is alive forever more and that he's still speaking he's still still calling he's still placing he's still correcting he's still delivering he's still healing he's still doing all that he that he's always ever done he's doing it right now in you and me and you are extensions of that as we look into part two of this series you're going to see the supernatural that God has given to you but you need to know your position you need to know what you've been given you need to know that you're already in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that you are encamped about by a cloud of witnesses that are cheering you on Hallelujah let the musician song leader come that God has a purpose and a plan for you amen praise God hallelujah listen now he says here actually you know what I'm

Christ that we saints of God we are so blessed we are so privilege that we're that that God just you know has allowed us to see these things to draw these things from the word of God listen brother bram's message tells us that we are the Flesh and bone of Jesus Christ but there are scriptures that are also telling us that we are the Flesh and B bone of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ himself is is is
