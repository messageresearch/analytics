TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] we try to move was not practical crack is donation traveling crash we know what speaking of everybody somebody left now a limit for good a lot of this mind know that is only temporary because your boys vision of the technician in the forest when he said he was screaming don't come back he says but they are left anyway but I know that some of them will return but friends we build the life Christian so we are so certain about behalf you know is so certain about the many times I got to the point where fasting praying seeking the Lord and everything else like that I started realizing that what they're teaching is not is is not implement in other words it's not a complete workout and then when you start questioning my guest doesn't like that at all because if this entire denomination [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] just like pairwise who said you was [Music] [Music] [Music] and now the voice is one one to recognize your position and place that device now how do you freeze the leave the door listen to Jesus you shall know the truth and truth [Music] many are the problems are life because the revelation of the message or a message magnification of the language [Music] [Music] [Music] because we [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] right [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] we are [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] yes sir next thing is that this world is constantly changing the values in the world are changing so we this hour like this family might not changing now also we need some solid foundation if we are going to cause any form of leadership [Music] [Music] it's because people establish my righteousness and you know nominative lead people's further and regions so some leadership first gotta have the proper cocktail for you to be able to have real leadership in that way and that's really what Ricky rewards upon this foundation this upon this foundation you build something you building with gold or silver or precious stone are the truth you can skip it would pain but every man's work shall be for what if any man's work in which he has built thereupon he shall receive early for miscomi testified five it's going to be tested by fire on the day of judgment you can be rewarded if your building is less active right you can be rewarded if your building is left standing after the fire passes through Amen hallelujah and that revelation his work is the only foundation at the last you know you've seen this in many many other white houses burn right down putting a lock when you look is missing the foundations and that was still there on that because [Music] your life and you can try that you have received praise God nevertheless the foundation of God's and pure text in this sealed temporal years and that everyone that later the Living Translation so awesome teaching of the Lord Jesus Christ is the foundation that couldn't be more true I'll just Jesus is like a wise man who built his house upon that is from translation have you read about clearly hear these words I speak to you are not incidental additions in life they are foundational words they are words for you to build pretty stuff go back to the scripture quickly the airport everyone where these words of mine and to help them so you can hear the word ever late love it when you say you must put it into practice for it to me coming to power within your life put it into practice don't just hear it but put it into practice hallelujah amen praise God I'm not going to start printing some life-changing teaching quietly like the shapes a flower our planet will shape our life and ready to a place where it was to be demon and so that we will not be the same people they are silly because some groups by different their preacher will be preaching on this I think you know because it's almost like appreciate the truth that is deep that's not a place for that no but the preacher has to apply token to the liability so that the word goes into practice not just into technology but it was into practice so we now receive making this message of the Prophet that we write dragon but for us to the humility put it into practice [Music] praise God bless you next week we'll come back and we talked about the importance of having doctrine in your life praise the Lord hallelujah that doesn't mean I'm good with teaching with every doctor I'm speaking in a general way why it's important for efforts equals to actually at least know some of the essential doctrine taught by the Prophet Assad but doesn't required for you to know everything and the prophets had some some washing woman of old-world leaves back there the woods all by herself catches one revelation that's enough to take her home Sarah why because that one revelation says the veil [Music] [Music] praise God gracious Heavenly Father we thank you tonight for this this wicked of Portland generation that the devil keeps so occupied so busy putting the people into his nature where we like to run to a true great controversy from going to throw to throw all of you God keep your people with a common center and keep us in perfect peace whose mind rested only because our hopes tonight will be later physical bodies denims or is it black ribbon yes am their sleep shall be sweet for who giveth his beloved sleep granted or take away sleeplessness from some of these believers take it away now father I let them relax let go let God have a space then all stress that all the work passed away from their mind thoughts how am I gonna glue this up my red color will be bloated up I believe Fed says to not just the Gentiles think about these things by providing on a spiral I tell the film where to go on the water the way they taught you how to come up with ethical back did I not do the same for you father we surrender alight the earnings and we trust you for the rest of I sturdy until we meet you face to face and tell the story [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
