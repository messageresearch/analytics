[3:57] reading from samuel
[4:02] chapter 23
[4:06] reading from verse 14
[4:11] and david was then
[4:14] in and hold
[4:17] and the garrison of the philistines
[4:21] was then in bethlehem
[4:26] and david longed
[4:30] and said oh that
[4:33] one would give me a drink of water
[4:38] of the well of bethlehem
[4:42] which is by the gate
[4:45] and three mighty men
[4:48] break through the hosts of philistines
[4:52] and drew water out of
[4:56] the well of bethlehem
[5:00] that was by the gate
[5:03] and took it and brought it to david
[5:07] nevertheless he would not drink thereof
[5:14] but poured it out unto the lord
[5:19] god bless our hearts
[5:23] as we receive the word of god
[5:26] fresh water from the well
[5:30] of bethlehem oh praise god's wonderful
[5:34] name
[5:37] i re i i would like to recap
[5:40] so that we get ourselves
[5:43] in the stream of the word of god
[5:48] remembering how that david
[5:53] running hiding dodging from saul
[5:56] a fugitive in his own land just
[6:00] as much as the true genuine anointed
[6:04] word of god for this hour
[6:07] has in this day while
[6:11] denominations rule like king saul ruled
[6:14] at that time
[6:16] that the true word is found as
[6:20] a fugitive in his own land
[6:24] coming to his own and they received him
[6:27] not
[6:28] but unto them that received him
[6:31] to them gave he the power to become the
[6:35] sons of god
[6:36] oh blessed be his name so here was david
[6:42] in the cave of abdullah
[6:47] thirsting for a drink
[6:50] of fresh water
[6:53] and his mighty man catching his thought
[6:57] like we catch revelation or the thoughts
[7:00] of god
[7:02] catching his thought from his
[7:05] uh soliloquy of speaking to himself
[7:08] oh that i would get a
[7:12] cold fresh drink of water
[7:15] from that well of bethlehem
[7:19] oh praise god may god give us a
[7:23] fresh drink of water from that well of
[7:26] bethlehem today that we might praise and
[7:29] glorify him and pour out ourselves in
[7:33] service
[7:34] to our king forever and ever
[7:37] and so three mighty men heard him
[7:41] adino eleazar and
[7:45] shama heard him and
[7:48] fought their way through 18
[7:51] miles of the philistine
[7:54] hosts to get to the well
[7:58] of bethlehem at the
[8:01] gate of the city that they might
[8:05] bring david fresh water
[8:08] from that well
[8:12] of bethlehem
[8:15] now david's mighty men
[8:19] did not think or even
[8:22] say to themselves oh uh
[8:25] bethlehem is too far um
[8:28] you know uh david what wouldn't know any
[8:32] different
[8:33] we will stop some where at some
[8:36] pool or some cistern uh
[8:40] rock cistern by the way and we can
[8:43] get that water because uh
[8:46] water is water and we will just
[8:49] bring that back and we'll give
[8:52] that to david let's just go to a nearby
[8:57] place and
[8:58] uh rock cistern and get some water
[9:01] you see because that's important
[9:04] praise god doesn't matter if we get the
[9:07] water from
[9:08] somewhere else other than the the
[9:12] the well at bethlehem's gate
[9:15] it's still water but you see
[9:19] where you get the water from is
[9:21] important
[9:24] and what kind of water that you get is
[9:26] important
[9:27] also ah you may say oh
[9:31] it's too far for me to get to
[9:35] the church to hear and receive the true
[9:38] word of god maybe i can
[9:41] stop at a denomination or stop with the
[9:45] church
[9:46] close by because they're preaching the
[9:48] bible to
[9:49] they're preaching from the word of god i
[9:52] believe
[9:53] that water i can drink that water too
[9:57] but let me say this to you my friends
[10:00] where you get your water from
[10:04] is important and
[10:07] what kind of water that you receive
[10:11] is also important
[10:15] because you see
[10:18] sweet water there is bitter water
[10:22] there is alkaline water
[10:25] there is hard water
[10:29] there is soft water and there
[10:32] is my friends different kinds of water
[10:36] but you see david wanted just like our
[10:40] god
[10:41] wants to have specific
[10:44] water from a specific
[10:47] place water cool
[10:51] fresh water
[10:56] from the well of bethlehem
[11:02] i tell you friends god's got a people
[11:05] that's going to drink from that well
[11:08] even if they have to
[11:10] fight their way through every test and
[11:13] trial
[11:14] of satan to get to the fullness of the
[11:16] word
[11:17] they're gonna press the battle and fight
[11:20] their way
[11:21] through the armies of hell and find
[11:24] their way
[11:25] to receive the word of god hallelujah
[11:28] you may say you're crazy to go down
[11:31] there
[11:32] among the armies of the philistines
[11:34] you'll say to that believer
[11:36] you're crazy to go to those people or to
[11:40] that church or
[11:42] where they're preaching that word of god
[11:45] hallelujah brother sister i
[11:48] tell you i don't care if i'm
[11:51] called a fool if i'm called crazy if i'm
[11:54] call out of my
[11:56] mind i want that kind of blessing
[11:59] i want that word of god
[12:02] i want that revelation fresh
[12:06] coming down like manna from the heavens
[12:09] above
[12:10] glory to god from let me tell you i'm
[12:13] glad i
[12:14] serve a god that has a bakery in the sky
[12:18] just give me fresh bread for my soul
[12:21] praise god hallelujah thank god amen
[12:25] give me bread where there is no bakery
[12:28] oh
[12:29] my america working god almighty god
[12:32] same yesterday today and forever
[12:36] oh praise god crazy i'm crazy about
[12:40] jesus christ
[12:42] i said i'm crazy about jesus christ
[12:46] hallelujah if i if they're gonna call me
[12:48] a fool call me a fool
[12:50] for the word of god but i want you to
[12:53] understand
[12:54] preaching like this speaking like this
[12:59] i am not and we are not
[13:02] against the people that are
[13:06] in those denominations
[13:09] what we are mainly speaking and touching
[13:13] about
[13:14] is the system the evil
[13:18] system created by satan
[13:22] under guise of religion that is used as
[13:25] a a net to trap and
[13:28] capture the people under his spell
[13:32] oh my and bring them under his
[13:36] spell until they'll fight for a church
[13:39] rather than to stand up for the word
[13:42] they'll fight for a denomination
[13:44] rather than to stand for jesus christ
[13:47] and the revealed word of god for the
[13:50] hour
[13:50] but i'll strain for jesus hallelujah
[13:53] and he'll stand for me he'll stand for
[13:56] us praise god hallelujah oh
[14:00] praise god when we come
[14:03] let's come believing because even after
[14:07] some people
[14:08] hear this kind of preaching when they
[14:11] come
[14:12] some of us are going to use it use the
[14:15] washing of the water
[14:17] of the word of god as washing water
[14:21] to wash our souls wash our lives
[14:26] watch our wash our lifestyle wash
[14:30] our walk watch our wash our talk
[14:33] hallelujah
[14:34] and let the holy spirit bleach us by the
[14:38] bleach blood of jesus christ
[14:40] and make us white and snow
[14:43] or i can say as white as the inside of
[14:45] the coconut
[14:46] but white god that just symbolizes
[14:50] god wants to make you pure and
[14:54] clean by the washing of his word
[14:58] oh glory be to god hallelujah
[15:02] praise god we are not against the people
[15:06] we are i said we are not against the
[15:09] people
[15:11] the people but we are against the system
[15:15] that is barring or keeping the
[15:19] people away from the word of god the
[15:22] revealed work
[15:24] oh don't go over there that crazy man is
[15:27] preaching over there
[15:28] look those crazy people over there those
[15:31] people are this that
[15:32] you see they call jesus name they even
[15:35] say you're bastard born
[15:37] you're up the devil you're this is that
[15:40] oh my your father name he says do you
[15:44] know my father

[15:49] am in the burning bush of fire praise
[15:52] god oh hallelujah and jesus
[15:55] is his name oh praise god hallelujah
[15:59] amen yes they're trying to
[16:02] hinder object
[16:06] and the bar the children of god
[16:10] from getting to the word of god
[16:13] hallelujah
[16:14] but that's true warriors of jesus christ
[16:18] may we take the word of god and
[16:21] shop every way we can like real warriors
[16:25] of the lord
[16:26] and bring ourselves out and bring us
[16:29] many out as we can for his glory we are
[16:32] not here to
[16:34] proselytize but we are here to preach
[16:38] the word we are here to justify
[16:41] we are not here to go into somebody
[16:43] else's church or
[16:45] and make trouble or or or whatever
[16:48] that's not what we are supposed to do
[16:51] but if somebody asks us
[16:53] a man if somebody is interested there
[16:56] and they see you know have inquisitive
[17:01] nature about them curiosity to discover
[17:05] what is this then we'll say this is
[17:08] that spoken by the prophet william
[17:11] marion branham
[17:12] this is that spoken by joel
[17:16] this is that spoken by peter on the day
[17:19] of pentecost the real
[17:21] genuine original peptic cost of
[17:25] blessings
[17:26] that oh i want that kind of blessing

[18:31] restore
[18:32] back the fresh water the fresh water
[18:36] that comes
[18:37] from the well of bethlehem
[18:40] not from a denomination but from
[18:43] bethlehem's world praise
[18:45] god brother sister let's not take a
[18:49] creed
[18:50] let's not take any old
[18:54] stagnated smelly water coming from some
[18:58] man-made cistern that they
[19:01] dig out or form and
[19:04] make it looks nice painted on the
[19:07] outside
[19:07] but it's nothing but a system amen
[19:11] they're drinking water that fell forty
[19:15] fifty hundred two hundred three hundred
[19:18] years ago amen some of them are drinking
[19:22] looter and water the drinking baptist

[19:36] from these polluted cisterns
[19:40] water that fell from years ago
[19:43] that they're trying to preserve and
[19:46] conserve
[19:47] amen but what we want is the word of god
[19:52] falling for today glory to god yes sir
[19:56] but you see little bethlehem
[20:00] is rejected hallelujah
[20:04] that you rejected friends
[20:07] hallelujah but that's the word we want
[20:11] little bethlehem is rejected
[20:16] what we preach today what we
[20:19] declare in the name of the lord is
[20:22] rejected
[20:24] oh bless his holy name o
[20:27] praise god i wanna thank god
[20:30] that there are still wise men and women
[20:34] today because
[20:37] three wise men when the word
[20:41] jesus christ was born hallelujah
[20:45] three wise men were led
[20:49] by a star moving overhead
[20:53] led them and brought them to
[20:56] bethlehem's gate oh glory to
[21:00] god hallelujah i want you to know those
[21:03] three
[21:04] wise men did not know each other
[21:07] it's usually told as if they knew each
[21:09] other and they set out together no
[21:12] they came from different
[21:15] amen oh india persia
[21:19] hallelujah they come all the way
[21:22] not knowing one another each one seeing
[21:25] that star
[21:27] moving mysteriously overhead
[21:31] and the star led them
[21:34] they met or united
[21:38] or came into a oneness
[21:41] at bethlehem's gate where the water
[21:46] of that well was and they
[21:49] went to worship the christ child
[21:53] all glory be to god hallelujah
[21:57] my friends how blessed it is
[22:02] to walk with god and many times we find
[22:06] out what we
[22:07] preach and what the messenger delivered
[22:12] pass over the people's head
[22:16] and it's right there but they're not
[22:17] seeing it
[22:19] it's passing over their head right in
[22:22] front of them
[22:23] we're looking at it we see it bright and
[22:26] clear
[22:27] they're looking and they see nothing
[22:30] for they say what are you talking about
[22:33] oh praise god but i want a fresh
[22:37] drink from that well of bethlehem
[22:42] now last week i told you there's a big
[22:44] difference
[22:46] between a
[22:50] cistern and the well
[22:54] you see a cistern is a place
[22:58] dug in the ground to take
[23:01] the place of a well they may
[23:04] dig a cistern to take the place of a
[23:07] well
[23:08] because where people don't have a well
[23:11] they'll go
[23:12] and they'll dig a cistern in other words
[23:16] a cistern is a man-made tank
[23:20] it's a man-made uh
[23:23] area in the ground to catch water
[23:28] from man to use and then dig it out
[23:32] amen oh praise god
[23:35] some may use it for washing
[23:39] some may use the water of the word
[23:42] for drinking and others
[23:46] in different ways i love
[23:49] the water because i loved swimming like
[23:52] ezekiel
[23:54] oh praise god hallelujah
[23:58] and sometimes the waters fill the system
[24:03] system you have to go with your bucket
[24:07] oh or connect a pipe somehow
[24:11] to that cistern to be able to get
[24:15] the water to you or you're going to have
[24:19] to some
[24:20] have to get some kind of a pump where
[24:22] you can
[24:23] pump it up pump it up pump it up you
[24:25] know
[24:26] i could say jump it up jump it up jump
[24:28] it up trying to
[24:29] pump up the holy spirit to pump
[24:33] up the anointed word of god
[24:36] to pump up the purity of the word of god
[24:39] oh praise god friends i tell you
[24:43] a sister is different completely
[24:47] from a well first of all
[24:51] a cistern can get dry and empty
[24:54] when the dry weather comes
[24:57] it can dry out amen just like
[25:01] some of these religious organizations
[25:05] dry times come and the well
[25:08] dry up the brook dry up
[25:11] nothing there to drink oh my
[25:15] and you see another thing about the
[25:17] cistern
[25:18] a cistern can't refill itself
[25:22] it has to wait on the rains to come
[25:26] or someone to come and put water
[25:30] inside of it oh it's
[25:33] it's not reliable at all you can't rely
[25:36] on a cistern amen because the cistern
[25:41] itself has to wait on rains to come
[25:44] and fill it and so on and so
[25:47] when the dry season comes or
[25:50] in north america the winter
[25:54] comes upon us then the snow
[25:58] might run off when it unfreezes
[26:02] and some water will then get in
[26:05] to the system other than that you don't
[26:08] have any water
[26:10] and your cistern will dry up
[26:13] and can't refill itself
[26:16] amen it's got to wait hallelujah
[26:20] and when the rains do
[26:24] come when the holy spirit
[26:28] does genuinely fall
[26:31] then the genuine holy spirit or the rain
[26:35] falls on top of the roofs of the houses
[26:40] and then the rain
[26:43] washes off the roof
[26:47] and washed off from all the roofs
[26:51] all the bird down
[26:54] oh my washes down
[26:58] all the dead insects
[27:02] wash off of that old roof
[27:05] that they have there amen
[27:08] being in a church is a form of
[27:10] protection to some people
[27:11] being it at least keeps them from the
[27:14] from the
[27:15] weather uh like that but when the raves
[27:18] come
[27:20] it washes off the bird droppings
[27:24] washes off all the dead insects
[27:29] and it got to pass through a church
[27:31] board
[27:32] it has to pass through a man-made spout
[27:35] before it can get into their
[27:39] church tank ah before it is approved
[27:44] or recognized before you are
[27:48] allowed or authorized to be
[27:51] able to drink from that
[27:54] tank but listen to the true believer
[27:59] they look at the word and they look at
[28:02] that
[28:04] and they can see that all the filth
[28:08] gathers right there the same
[28:11] water gathers all kinds of filth
[28:15] and brings down all kinds of germs
[28:19] in the old days when they burnt the cane
[28:23] and burnt the fields the rain will
[28:27] bring down all of the black stuff and
[28:30] everything else that will fall into that
[28:34] water
[28:35] and mess it up in every way
[28:38] and sometimes you look into your
[28:42] sister and what do you see
[28:46] there is water frogs jumping about
[28:50] because they're happy that they're in
[28:53] some water
[28:54] but the water is cistern water and
[28:57] they're
[28:57] jumping and croaking and hollering and
[29:00] whatever else
[29:01] in that water and you look again
[29:05] and you'll see there is water lizards
[29:09] and they're they're running around in
[29:11] that water
[29:12] they're happy in that water that gather
[29:15] in there and the water keeps standing
[29:19] and standing there and then you're going
[29:22] to see what the spiders
[29:25] when you look some more that that
[29:28] balls begin to be inside
[29:32] of the very water every one of them an
[29:36] unclean animal or kinds of those things
[29:41] in there hallelujah
[29:44] but you know what do you know paul's
[29:47] can't live in real clear clean water
[29:50] it's too clean for them they can't live
[29:52] in it
[29:53] the water's got to be a little start to
[29:55] get a little bit cloudy
[29:57] they'll start when it is clear but then
[30:00] the water starts digressing
[30:03] and going down and they love
[30:06] that water when they can play around
[30:09] dance around move around oh my
[30:12] praise god they love it better
[30:15] when the water goes to the stage
[30:18] or state of stagnation when that water
[30:22] gets the stagnation then they know
[30:25] well on this day we pray these prayers
[30:29] on this other day you know we're
[30:32] stagnated right there
[30:33] this year this is the the preaching for
[30:37] this day this month this year
[30:39] it's all there and if it's not like that
[30:43] then the preacher has his routine that
[30:46] he goes through
[30:47] in every possible way amen
[30:51] and that is the same with
[30:54] a lot of the religious parasites
[30:58] oh my the try to
[31:02] gather together in their church tank
[31:05] in their organization will take they
[31:08] come together
[31:10] amen but there are parasites
[31:13] in that water that will make you
[31:16] sick if you drink that kind of a water
[31:19] that can't live in genuine fresh cool
[31:22] water from bethlehem's well or from the
[31:26] holy spirit
[31:27] that's not the water they want to live
[31:29] on they want to live
[31:31] in a religious atmosphere where they can
[31:33] duck and dive and hide and
[31:35] and like that and still carry out and
[31:38] carry on with some
[31:40] deeds and different things oh my but
[31:43] they don't want the fresh cold water
[31:45] oh my lord jesus oh hallelujah
[31:49] and that makes them want to fight and
[31:51] come
[31:52] firmly against this word
[31:55] of the holy spirit and say there's
[31:58] nothing to that
[32:00] i heard that before or it's
[32:03] contradiction itself
[32:05] there want to spread all manner of lying
[32:08] rumors and all matters things
[32:11] about the genuine word of god hallelujah
[32:16] because uh you see they're trying to
[32:20] stagnate
[32:21] what the word is doing they're trying to
[32:24] stop it
[32:25] and stagnate it so they can create the
[32:28] atmosphere
[32:29] that they can live in and mix in
[32:32] themselves
[32:33] within the moving of the world because
[32:36] they need a stagnated pool
[32:38] to be able to live and to be able
[32:41] to carry on what they want to do they
[32:44] want to be able to wiggle about
[32:47] we go this way and wiggle that way we
[32:49] end up having a lot of religious
[32:51] politicians that will put the as we say
[32:55] in in a regular talk that
[32:58] they put their mouth where the soup is
[33:01] dropping

[33:08] to put
[33:09] my mouth at the glory spout where the
[33:12] blessings are
[33:13] pouring out and the holy spirit of the
[33:15] living god
[33:16] is running down with fresh anointed
[33:20] word of god for this day time an hour

[34:52] the word of god expanding exploding
[34:55] and growing and moving in a mighty way
[34:58] like that
[34:59] amen it's they don't want that because
[35:02] it's not their nature to live there
[35:05] they'll

[40:48] but sex exposure dressing
[40:52] deliberately set up to seduce and to
[40:54] attract man
[40:56] and to become a man trap rather than a
[40:59] daughter and child of the king walking
