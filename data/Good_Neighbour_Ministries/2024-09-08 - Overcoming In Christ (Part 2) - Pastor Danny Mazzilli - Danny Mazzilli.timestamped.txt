[9:26] this
[9:27] morning to give him thanks listen to
[9:29] give him
[9:30] praise
[9:33] Hallelujah yesterday I was just reading
[9:35] Psalms 145 and David was talking about
[9:37] the greatness of God and there was these
[9:40] five words popped
[9:42] out that gave the distinct
[9:44] characteristics of God and it says it
[9:46] was God's goodness God's greatness God's
[9:48] goodness God's glory God's guaranteed
[9:51] and God's grace and I took some
[9:54] scriptures to match them it says God's
[9:57] greatness great is the Lord and worthy
[9:59] of praise His greatness is no one can
[10:01] fathom great is the Lord and greatly to
[10:04] be praised and his greatness is
[10:07] unsearchable God's goodness the Lord is
[10:09] good to all his compassion on all he has
[10:13] made God's glory they will tell of the
[10:18] glory of your kingdom and speak of your
[10:20] might so that all men might know your
[10:22] Mighty acts and the Glorious Splendor of
[10:26] your kingdom and this is one of my
[10:28] favorites here God's guarantee he says
[10:30] your kingdom is Everlasting Kingdom and
[10:33] your Dominion endures you you know when
[10:36] you buy something you get a guarantee
[10:37] but you only get probably two years 5
[10:39] years this is eternal guarantee and the
[10:42] last one God's grace the Lord upholds
[10:46] all those who fall and lift up all those
[10:49] that are bow down to him somebody give
[10:51] him praise this morning
[10:56] Hallelujah we are so happy to be in this

[35:25] speak and to meet our need needs he just
[35:29] does it that's what makes him so great
[35:32] amen praise God forever
[35:35] more and so um I want to welcome all of
[35:40] our guests and all of
[35:41] our uh friends praise God that are here
[35:46] with us this morning welcome into the
[35:48] house of the
[35:50] Lord amen let me just quickly fix this
[35:55] some reason it gets a bit of
[35:57] interference here in the mornings when I
[35:59] set
[36:00] up praise
[36:02] God but that's
[36:05] okay
[36:07] interference just gives us something to
[36:23] overcome praise God there it is okay
[36:29] good amen so uh how many enjoyed the
[36:32] services last
[36:35] weekend praise God Amen brother Maxwell
[36:39] uh I was in touch with him this week and
[36:41] um he says I'm still rejoicing myself he
[36:45] says uh what a wonderful group of
[36:47] Believers he said may the Lord just uh
[36:50] you know continue to prosper such a
[36:53] wonderful Ministry he just felt so
[36:55] blessed to be a part of the weekend he
[36:57] said there was such faith and and such a
[36:59] pull um he's a fine young man I believe
[37:03] the Lord is going to uh do great things
[37:05] with our brother amen he's uh he's
[37:08] certainly gifted with that uh with that
[37:10] Ministry of
[37:12] evangelism and um you know that's what
[37:14] uh the fivefold ministry is all about
[37:16] amen and when you know you when when you
[37:19] experience that you know you've
[37:21] experienced it you know that it's it's
[37:23] the gift of God it's the supernatural
[37:26] that comes into the midst and starts to
[37:28] discern situations and uh just light
[37:31] fires and you know uh refresh and renew
[37:34] now we know that he was speaking to the
[37:36] young people
[37:38] but who's not a young person
[37:42] here like like like like you think that
[37:45] all of a sudden there's a difference
[37:47] when it comes to the attributes of God
[37:49] that God's uh speaking you know to the
[37:51] older ones the younger ones yes there
[37:54] are believers that are you know like
[37:56] sheep Lambs they just first come into
[37:59] the realization but that attribute
[38:02] inside of them is is the same age as
[38:06] you so this was a youth meeting but
[38:10] we're having a youth meeting this
[38:11] morning we're having an eternal youth
[38:14] meeting if you've come into the
[38:15] revelation of this hour you've come to
[38:17] realize that age is not something that
[38:20] God looks at amen praise God and so we
[38:24] were very blessed by the word of God
[38:26] every single one that was in here I know
[38:29] that if they were pulling and they were
[38:31] seeking God uh they received the word
[38:34] from the Lord they got something and um
[38:37] if you take that what you received and
[38:39] you apply it and you hold on to it and
[38:41] you believe it and you
[38:44] overcome you see this is the whole thing
[38:46] this is what um you know there's
[38:49] responsibility that comes with the word
[38:51] of God and your part is to overcome and
[38:55] it's not in the way that you might think
[38:57] okay the overcoming in this hour we're
[38:59] going to be looking at it today we're
[39:01] gon to we're just going to continue
[39:02] where we left off last time but um uh we
[39:06] were certainly blessed by brother uh
[39:08] Miguel amen when he brought the word on
[39:11] Saturday morning that was just a
[39:13] tremendous word of God and uh I know
[39:15] that I was immensely blessed and I know
[39:17] many of you were um you took it and you
[39:20] applied it into your life into your
[39:22] experiences because that's what he
[39:24] brought he brought one of his life
[39:26] experiences and that's really you know
[39:29] the message of the hour when you really
[39:32] uh you know you start to recognize who
[39:34] you are as a son or a daughter of God
[39:37] you start to realize that you're
[39:38] actually having an experience with the
[39:41] Living God and then how you edify the
[39:44] body of Christ is through your
[39:47] experience uh with the the the rest of
[39:50] the body and coming into fellowship and
[39:53] recognizing you know the Living God in
[39:55] our midst amen and last weekend you know
[39:58] the the theme that the Lord laid heavily
[40:00] upon my heart
[40:02] was calling out from a pure heart to
[40:06] them that call unto the Lord from a pure
[40:09] heart in other words you you want God to
[40:13] do something in your life amen you want
[40:16] to see the reality of what it is to
[40:19] serve the Living God not some
[40:22] churchgoing experience you know one day
[40:26] you're hot the next day you're cold one
[40:28] moment you're you're excited about God
[40:30] and the next day you're cursing God not
[40:34] this kind of experience the reality of
[40:37] God in your life amen glory to God so uh
[40:41] you know I believe that um uh we can
[40:43] continue to Feast on the word of God and
[40:46] and he's he's going to progress and
[40:49] continue right from where he left off

[50:36] anoint us to have ears to hear what the
[50:39] spirit is saying granted father we pray
[50:43] in Jesus name amen praise
[50:48] God let's read our scripture from 1 John
[50:51] CH
[50:52] 5: 4
[50:54] to7 for who soever is born of God
[50:59] overcometh the
[51:00] world and this is the victory that
[51:03] overcometh the world even our faith amen
[51:08] it's it's Faith replace that word with
[51:11] Revelation you need a revelation of
[51:15] everything that we're going to read here
[51:17] everything that we're going to speak on
[51:19] this morning the foundation of it is God
[51:24] revealing it personal to you
[51:27] amen without that
[51:29] Foundation there is no overcoming amen
[51:34] amen praise God true overcoming so and
[51:37] this is the
[51:39] victory that overcometh the world even
[51:42] our faith who is he that overcometh the
[51:45] world but he that believeth that Jesus
[51:48] is the son of God this is he that came
[51:53] by water and blood even Jesus Jus Christ
[51:57] not by water only but by water and blood
[52:02] and it is the spirit that beareth
[52:04] witness because the spirit is truth for
[52:07] there are three that bear record in
[52:10] heaven the Father the word and the Holy
[52:14] Ghost and these three are a trinity no
[52:20] no these three are one amen here ye oh
[52:26] Israel the
[52:28] Lord thy God is one amen amen you may be
[52:34] seated praise God you see without you
[52:38] knowing who you're actually praying to
[52:40] how can you even get
[52:43] anywhere how can you get anywhere if if
[52:46] you're praying to an unknown God when he
[52:50] is in this day made himself known unto a
[52:54] people and that people
[52:57] have decided that they're going to that
[52:59] they're not going to just hold it and
[53:00] keep it to themselves because in every
[53:03] age when the Lord Jesus revealed himself
[53:06] to any individual that individual would
[53:10] cry out and let the people know that
[53:13] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[53:16] and forever he's a reality he's not a
[53:19] God that's just written in a book but
[53:21] he's the Living Word he's God he's
[53:24] Jehovah and his name name is the Lord
[53:27] Jesus Christ amen praise God you know
[53:30] John was was was uh writing the word
[53:33] here and under the inspiration he was
[53:36] saying that whosoever is born of God
[53:38] overcometh the world and this is the
[53:41] victory that overcometh it's faith and
[53:43] to know and to believe that Jesus Christ
[53:46] is the Son of God not a second person
[53:51] but that Jesus the Jehovah of the Old
[53:54] Testament was made flesh the the word
[53:57] came and was made flesh that's why the
[53:59] Father the word and the Holy Ghost
[54:01] they're the same PE they're the same
[54:03] person it's just that God in heaven had
[54:06] to manifest himself and come to fulfill
[54:09] his own word and the Word was made flesh
[54:13] and dwelt among us so that he could take
[54:16] on a vessel of Flesh and here John is
[54:19] he's clarifying like he's saying like
[54:21] Listen by not by water
[54:25] only every everybody that's born that
[54:27] comes into this world you know when a
[54:29] woman uh gives birth the water breaks
[54:33] amen and and then comes the and then
[54:35] comes the blood and then comes the child
[54:37] amen praise God and we know that that's
[54:40] all a type that that's the reality of
[54:42] the experience here but Jesus Christ was
[54:45] more than just water and blood there was
[54:48] a spirit that Beed record amen and the
[54:52] blood was a was a was a revelation that
[54:55] he was not not coming just as as God but
[55:00] he was coming as God in man so that he
[55:05] could go to Calvary as a man and yet God
[55:10] was in the man he wasn't just an
[55:13] ordinary so that he could go to Calvary
[55:16] and die for our sins so that we could be
[55:18] saved the whole Christian experience is
[55:21] based on this without the without the
[55:25] cross there is no salvation there is no
[55:28] church this morning there is no uh uh
[55:32] preaching on the word of God and
[55:35] overcoming then we're just like the rest
[55:37] of the world and this world is in chaos
[55:41] right now they're going into
[55:42] tribulation this world is not going to
[55:45] get any better it's actually going to
[55:47] get worse and you're going to need to be
[55:50] in Christ in order to overcome what's
[55:54] coming into this world world and what's
[55:57] happening right now around us amen
[56:00] praise God and so we need to recognize
[56:04] that amen so John was was uh showing
[56:08] here that he didn't only come by water
[56:11] it's not only by baptism you know a lot
[56:13] of people think that oh well I was
[56:15] baptized you know I can be I'm I'm I'm
[56:18] saved I got baptized as a baby you know
[56:22] making the word of God of none none
[56:24] effect because of man's
[56:26] Traditions but the scripture says very
[56:29] clearly that you need the water and you
[56:32] need the blood and you need the Holy
[56:35] Spirit to Bear record in your life to
[56:38] Bear record that you've had a true
[56:41] experience that you are a true Christian
[56:44] filled with the Holy Ghost in This Day
[56:46] and in this hour that has the ability to
[56:49] overcome the situations of this world
[56:52] and this life you will face challenges
[56:55] you will face situations that are that
[56:58] are sometimes life shattering Earth
[57:02] shattering relationship shattering
[57:05] Financial shattering all kinds of things
[57:08] that are going to come down upon
[57:11] people's lives but let me tell you you
[57:14] can overcome them if you're in
[57:17] Christ you can overcome them if you
[57:20] accept Christ as your Overcomer if you
[57:24] accept him as your lord and your savior
[57:27] amen hallelujah not just confessing it
[57:30] like the world says oh just confess that
[57:33] Jesus Christ is Lord and thou shalt be
[57:35] saved now there's going to be a lot of
[57:37] people that are going to be saved that
[57:40] are outside of the
[57:42] Bride but remember the category listen
[57:46] every age when Jesus Christ came to the
[57:48] Earth there was only a handful of people
[57:52] that actually recognized who he really
[57:55] was
[57:57] they were those that were
[58:00] predestinated elected to recognize the
[58:03] word in their day amen and All Through
[58:07] the Ages this last week we looked at all
[58:09] of that we looked at to them that
[58:11] overcame and every one of those ages you
[58:14] can go back and listen to that I'm not
[58:16] going to go over all of that now but but
[58:18] there were every age had to overcome
[58:21] every uh dispensation when where Christ
[58:24] was was condescending and himself to
[58:27] bring us to this day in this season
[58:30] where we're we're actually going to
[58:32] fulfill the Rapture remember that is our
[58:35] portion of the word that's the part that
[58:38] we're that we're fulfilling this is the
[58:40] hour that that we're in right now that
[58:42] this church that that is called out in
[58:45] this day and in this hour is going to be
[58:48] called into
[58:50] Christ they're going to be called
[58:52] they're going to they're going to
[58:53] recognize that they were in Christ not
[58:56] not just now but they were always in
[58:58] Christ before the foundations of the
[59:00] world but they got trapped into this
[59:02] human body and that they had to overcome
[59:06] the the themselves amen we're going to
[59:09] be looking at all that so that they
[59:11] could recognize that they are a son or a
[59:15] daughter of God an attribute of God if
[59:18] you're a son or a daughter of God you
[59:20] always
[59:21] were an attribute of God a part of God

[1:00:33] this uh quote struck me I listened to
[1:00:35] the message um you know how can I
[1:00:38] overcome and I suggest you do that this
[1:00:40] week if you get a chance go back listen
[1:00:42] to that message because everything that
[1:00:45] I've drawn I've drawn it out of that
[1:00:47] message most of it amen praise God and
[1:00:50] then the Holy Spirit can add whatever he
[1:00:52] likes in the midst of our our ministry
[1:00:54] here but he said says here I want to
[1:00:57] take my subject this morning of this how
[1:01:00] can I overcome now I chose this because
[1:01:04] that I think that it's a time that we
[1:01:06] should never let the spirit of Revival
[1:01:09] die I said man when I heard that it just
[1:01:12] it's just jumped right out of the tape
[1:01:14] and I stopped and I and I thought and I
[1:01:16] thought Lord Jesus hallelujah praise God
[1:01:21] you mean
[1:01:23] overcoming brings Revival yeah oh
[1:01:27] yeah you ever experiened when you when

[1:02:10] we're living in a day right now where
[1:02:12] there there's only one true Revival and
[1:02:14] that is in the bride of Christ it's in
[1:02:17] the people that are overcoming in this
[1:02:19] day and in this hour that have
[1:02:21] recognized that they've got something to
[1:02:23] to to to overcome if want their lives to
[1:02:27] be to to to to be effective to to allow
[1:02:30] God to do the supernatural in their
[1:02:32] lives they need to overcome brother Bram
[1:02:35] was saying here the spirit of Revival he
[1:02:38] says should never let the spirit of
[1:02:39] Revival die we got to keep in Revival
[1:02:43] constantly revived every day Paul said
[1:02:46] he had to Die daily that Christ could
[1:02:49] live and we must never let that Revival
[1:02:53] die within us he amen how do you keep
[1:02:57] the revival going you feed on the word
[1:02:59] of God how do you keep the revival going
[1:03:02] you testify that God is more than able
[1:03:05] to get me through this
[1:03:07] situation Jesus Christ is able to
[1:03:10] overcome my circumstances my financial
[1:03:13] burdens my health issues all the things
[1:03:16] my relationship issues all the things
[1:03:19] that I'm struggling with right now God
[1:03:21] is able to do it and when you overcome
[1:03:24] Revival starts to take place place the
[1:03:27] Dead starts to wake up in you the things
[1:03:29] that you feel like you're you you've
[1:03:31] lost the battle you feel dead in this
[1:03:33] area Life Starts coming back into it

[1:03:41] hearts of the True Believers amen

[1:03:45] overcome they're they're ready to face
[1:03:47] the enemy because they know that when
[1:03:50] they overcome there's
[1:03:52] Victory amen praise God let's go to the
[1:03:55] next slide
[1:03:56] Matthew 4 now we're going to be
[1:03:58] looking here at uh at uh you know we're
[1:04:01] going to call this the three assaults
[1:04:03] okay but let's read the scripture then
[1:04:05] was Jesus led
[1:04:06] up of the spirit Into the Wilderness to
[1:04:09] be tempted of the devil and when he had
[1:04:12] fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was
[1:04:16] afterward and hungered and when the
[1:04:18] tempter came to him he saidif thou be
[1:04:21] the Son of God command that these Stones
[1:04:24] be made bread' but he answered and said
[1:04:26] it is written man shall not live by
[1:04:29] bread alone but by every word that
[1:04:32] proceedeth out of the mouth of God then
[1:04:36] the devil taketh him up into the holy
[1:04:39] city and sth him on a pinnacle of the
[1:04:43] temple and saith unto him if thou be the
[1:04:47] Son of God cast thyself down for it is
[1:04:50] written he shall give his angels charge
[1:04:53] concerning thee and in their hands they
[1:04:56] shall bear thee up lest at any time thou
[1:05:00] Dash thy foot against a stone Jesus said
[1:05:03] unto him again it is written again Thou
[1:05:09] shalt not tempt the Lord thy God again
[1:05:13] the devil taketh him up into an
[1:05:16] exceeding high mountain and showeth him
[1:05:19] all the kingdoms of the world and the
[1:05:22] glory of
[1:05:23] them and saith to him all these things
[1:05:27] will I give thee if thou wil Fall Down
[1:05:32] and Worship
[1:05:34] me then saith Jesus unto him get thee
[1:05:38] behind me Satan for it is
[1:05:42] written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy
[1:05:45] God and him only shalt thou serve
[1:05:54] thankes glory to to God Amen and so what
[1:05:57] we're going to be looking at here today
[1:05:59] and what you know if there's anything
[1:06:01] that we want to make clear today and and
[1:06:04] and and make it you know stir you in
[1:06:07] your heart there's only one way that you
[1:06:10] will
[1:06:11] overcome and I mean truly overcome
[1:06:14] whatever it is that you're facing and
[1:06:16] that'll be by the
[1:06:18] word only by the word listen to The
[1:06:22] Prophet here we read this quote last
[1:06:24] week he says now what are we to
[1:06:27] overcome this is the normal question
[1:06:29] asked here but that is not the actual
[1:06:32] thought of this verse for it is not so
[1:06:34] much what we are to overcome but how we
[1:06:39] are to overcome now this is logical for
[1:06:43] does it matter what we are to overcome
[1:06:46] as long as we know how we can overcome a
[1:06:50] quick look at those scriptures which
[1:06:52] involve the Lord Jesus overcoming will
[1:06:55] bring out the truth of this proposition
[1:06:58] right in Matthew 4 wherein Jesus is
[1:07:00] tempted by the devil he overcame the
[1:07:03] personal Temptations of Satan by the
[1:07:06] word and by the word
[1:07:08] only right that's why a lot of people
[1:07:10] say you talk about the word too
[1:07:13] much you you you know you you lift up
[1:07:16] the word too much you read the word too
[1:07:17] much you quote the word too much that's
[1:07:21] our sword and our
[1:07:23] shield in this day in this hour you see
[1:07:27] that's what the enemy has done out there
[1:07:29] that's right he's made the word of none
[1:07:33] effect listen to what Jesus told you go
[1:07:35] back to St John chapter 6 Jesus rebuked
[1:07:39] the Pharisees and the Sadducees and all
[1:07:41] the high Priests of that day he rebuked
[1:07:45] them he said you've made the word of God
[1:07:48] of none effect to the people because of
[1:07:51] your
[1:07:52] Traditions when somebody comes to me and
[1:07:55] says oh Danny I go to church I go to
[1:07:57] church on Sunday I do the 14 Stations of
[1:07:59] the
[1:08:01] Cross you might as well go run the
[1:08:05] track that'll at least profit you a
[1:08:07] little bit more than than than than
[1:08:09] walking the 14 Stations of the Cross
[1:08:12] Jesus already walked out for you you
[1:08:15] need to accept the
[1:08:17] death not the suffering but the death
[1:08:21] and when you accept the death then then
[1:08:23] there will be some suffering that will
[1:08:25] come in your life uh because you're
[1:08:27] going to have to stand the reproach to
[1:08:29] stand for the
[1:08:30] word that said you need Jesus Christ in
[1:08:34] the present stage of his ministry not a
[1:08:37] historical Jesus but the one that's here
[1:08:41] this morning that's speaking right here
[1:08:43] this morning by the inspiration of the
[1:08:46] holy
[1:08:47] spirit amen praise God and so here now
[1:08:51] he says he overcame the personal
[1:08:53] Temptations of Satan by the word of and
[1:08:55] by the word only in each of the three
[1:08:58] major trials that corresponded exactly
[1:09:01] to the Temptation Of The Garden of Eden
[1:09:05] the lust of the flesh the lust of the
[1:09:07] eyes and the pride of life Jesus
[1:09:11] overcame by the
[1:09:13] word now look what he says here Eve
[1:09:17] fell to the personal Temptation Of Satan
[1:09:21] by failing to use the word Adam fell in
[1:09:25] direct Disobedience to the word Adam
[1:09:29] knew exactly what he was doing because
[1:09:32] Adam is a perfect type of Jesus Christ
[1:09:36] he saw that his church his bride that's
[1:09:38] why when you talk about the church
[1:09:40] you're talking about the bride of Christ
[1:09:42] it's always a type in the scriptures
[1:09:44] well Adam's bride was Eve and she fell
[1:09:49] to the lies of the enemy he came and
[1:09:52] tempted her go you shall not sure die if
[1:09:57] you feed from me you eat from me in
[1:10:00] other words you hear my words and you
[1:10:03] take my words and you listen to what I'm
[1:10:05] going to tell you and he he just you
[1:10:07] know you can go back and it tells you
[1:10:09] Eve was deceived in the scripture not
[1:10:13] Adam Eve was deceived by the by the by
[1:10:17] by the
[1:10:18] sub serpent who was an upright man and
[1:10:22] could talk not a snake he was turned
[1:10:25] turned into a snake as a part of his
[1:10:28] curse but he was an upright man because
[1:10:31] you can go back listen people say you
[1:10:34] know 6,000 years we say the Bible is
[1:10:37] 6,000 years old but Time and Eternity
[1:10:40] you know the earth the earth could be a
[1:10:42] hundred billion years old there was no
[1:10:47] death prior to Eve falling and being
[1:10:52] deceived and Adam being
[1:10:56] taken into it with his wife and death
[1:10:59] Came Upon the Earth there was no death
[1:11:03] Adam and Eve could have been in the
[1:11:04] Garden of Eden there was no even years
[1:11:07] there was no time time wasn't even an
[1:11:09] element time only is relevant to us
[1:11:12] because we die if there was no
[1:11:16] death what what what what what's time if
[1:11:20] you didn't age and you and you never
[1:11:23] died time would have no significance
[1:11:25] well Adam and Eve were in the image of
[1:11:27] God they were in their theophany bodies
[1:11:31] Eternal bodies that were expressed from
[1:11:33] God Amen and they were living and could
[1:11:37] have been there for a 100 million years
[1:11:39] before the serpent showed up and said
[1:11:42] hey you know because now God wanted to
[1:11:45] express salvation he wanted to be a
[1:11:47] savior so in order for him to be a
[1:11:49] savior something had to fall there's
[1:11:52] nothing out of cater here we are in the
[1:11:54] plan of Redemption we've just been
[1:11:57] awakened to recognize that whole plan
[1:12:00] and where we fit into it today and so
[1:12:03] here now the uh you know Eve was
[1:12:05] deceived by The Serpent and death came
[1:12:10] into
[1:12:12] Humanity amen praise God so this Eve
[1:12:17] because now he's going to have a church
[1:12:19] in this day and in this hour that is
[1:12:22] going to be without spot or wrinkle
[1:12:25] because she cannot be
[1:12:28] deceived she's the part of God she's the
[1:12:32] Eve that can never be deceived because
[1:12:36] he is going to go right back to the
[1:12:40] state that they were in before the fall
[1:12:44] did you know that
[1:12:46] Adam his name both Adam and Eve both of
[1:12:51] them were were in Adam when when Adam
[1:12:54] was made in the the image of God and God
[1:12:56] said and called their name Adam there
[1:13:00] was only one that's why when a husband
[1:13:02] and a wife join here naturally
[1:13:06] spiritually they are one they are one
[1:13:10] okay well that's what we're being
[1:13:12] restored back to that's what that's who
[1:13:14] the bride in this day the the church in
[1:13:17] this day she's come into the unity and
[1:13:21] the and the relationship of Jesus Christ
[1:13:24] her
[1:13:25] and the her and Christ becoming one amen
[1:13:29] okay that's why he says on that day ye
[1:13:32] shall know that I am in the father ye in
[1:13:33] me and I in you this is that day so this
[1:13:38] eve will not fall because Christ is in
[1:13:42] her
[1:13:43] amen she will overcome because she's in
[1:13:47] Christ amen hallelujah thank you Jesus
[1:13:51] let's keep going
[1:13:53] here so we're going to be looking at the
[1:13:56] three
[1:13:57] assaults okay you can go to the next
[1:14:12] slide okay so here listen so we're going
[1:14:15] to look at these three assaults and
[1:14:16] we're just going to go over them briefly
[1:14:18] and you're going to you're going to see
[1:14:20] certain things there and you know if you
[1:14:22] see yourself somewhere and how the enem
[1:14:24] is kind of attacking you in one of these
[1:14:27] assaults then you know just say
[1:14:29] hallelujah thank you Jesus that's me I
[1:14:32] receive that I'm going to allow that to
[1:14:35] be the word that's going to give me the
[1:14:37] overcoming power amen because remember
[1:14:40] it's the word in you but the word needs
[1:14:42] to be that needs needs to be stirred
[1:14:44] within you it needs to be brought to the
[1:14:46] surface your conscious mind and that
[1:14:49] attribute of God needs to come into the
[1:14:52] into the uh you know uh connection there
[1:14:54] where where all of a sudden you say I
[1:14:56] see it it's because the Revelation is
[1:14:58] being revealed unto you now listen here
[1:15:01] in the message how I how can I overcome
[1:15:03] brother Braham says now his 40 days of
[1:15:06] Temptation by God's word he overcome and
[1:15:09] I want to express something here just
[1:15:12] for a few
[1:15:13] minutes Satan made three major assaults
[1:15:17] on him in that Temptation now watch it's
[1:15:21] always in them three don't forget it see
[1:15:24] he made three major assaults from the
[1:15:27] highest to the lowest he tried his best
[1:15:30] to conquer him but he was the word amen
[1:15:35] he was the word what did he use himself
[1:15:39] the word Satan's three major attacks or
[1:15:43] assaults upon him but he met it with the
[1:15:46] word every attack he could make it with
[1:15:50] the word watch this now from the highest
[1:15:53] to the lowest amen
[1:15:55] so the first he made his attack upon to
[1:15:58] use his great
[1:16:00] power he says now which he know he was
[1:16:03] the word you don't you don't think Jesus
[1:16:06] knew who he was when he was here he knew
[1:16:09] exactly who he was he said I come to do
[1:16:12] the will of my father amen and if you've
[1:16:15] got the word in you then you're going to
[1:16:18] come to a place where you're going to
[1:16:19] want the will of the father in your life
[1:16:23] you're going to want his will in your
[1:16:25] circumstances you're going to want only
[1:16:27] his desire and his will for everything
[1:16:30] that you're facing amen you see this is
[1:16:33] the part of of of the overcoming he know
[1:16:36] he was the word he knowed his position
[1:16:37] he believed he did and the congregation
[1:16:40] says amen the son of man he knowed his
[1:16:43] position and Satan come and want him to
[1:16:46] use his own power on himself to feed him
[1:16:51] want to feed himself he was hungry a man
[1:16:54] gets hungry he can do almost anything
[1:16:58] he'll steal Rob beg borrow anything see
[1:17:01] he had the appetite and Satan used his
[1:17:04] first major
[1:17:06] assault upon
[1:17:08] him to take his power that he had been
[1:17:12] given to overcome with the use of it on
[1:17:16] himself he didn't use it on himself no
[1:17:20] he did he used it on others that's right
[1:17:23] he used it on others not himself it
[1:17:26] wasn't for him though he could have done
[1:17:30] it he certainly could have done it the
[1:17:32] Lord has given
[1:17:34] you
[1:17:36] gifts the Lord has placed you into the
[1:17:40] body of
[1:17:41] Christ your life once you've been placed
[1:17:44] into this Kingdom the mystical Body of
[1:17:48] Christ by a birth by an experience by a
[1:17:51] reality that you've met God face to face
[1:17:54] he places you in the body and he gives
[1:17:57] you a position in the body am and when
[1:18:00] you recognize your position and that he
[1:18:03] has placed you there and that he says
[1:18:06] now I'm going to operate that gift
[1:18:09] through
[1:18:11] you you overcome
[1:18:14] yourself and you allow that gift to take
[1:18:17] a hold of you when he wants to use it
[1:18:22] and when he wants to bring you into the
[1:18:23] house of the Lord and he shows you that
[1:18:26] you're in the media that you're in the
[1:18:28] cleaning committee that you're in the
[1:18:30] Sunday school and that you're operating
[1:18:32] in all these different areas of the body
[1:18:34] of Christ you surrender to it by
[1:18:38] humbling yourself to the Holy Ghost
[1:18:40] that's in you that's placing you and now
[1:18:43] Satan cannot tempt you he cannot use
[1:18:48] your position against the body of Christ
[1:18:52] but for the body of Christ not for your
[1:18:56] own benefit because just the fact that
[1:18:59] you've overcome and that you've
[1:19:00] surrendered to Christ you benefit amen
[1:19:03] you've overcome and you get Victory
[1:19:06] through that amen so you're going to
[1:19:10] need to really examine
[1:19:12] yourself okay as we're going through
[1:19:14] this examine yourself see where it is
[1:19:17] that that the enemy's got a hold of you
[1:19:19] in your mind somewhere somehow he's
[1:19:23] deceived you to believe certain certain
[1:19:25] things that that are that are outside of
[1:19:27] the word of God usually there are things
[1:19:30] that are that are that are uh uh you
[1:19:32] know to please this to please yourself
[1:19:37] look to see if it's if it's you know uh
[1:19:40] the lust of the flesh or or or the pride
[1:19:42] of life or or the lust of the eyes it's
[1:19:45] somewhere somehow listen until we die
[1:19:48] out to Jesus Christ in our lives we're
[1:19:52] going to constantly have to overcome
[1:19:54] ourselves
[1:19:56] that's your greatest enemy that's who
[1:19:58] we're talking to here remember he Satan
[1:20:01] went to Eve in the Garden of Eden and he
[1:20:03] knew that she was going to be
[1:20:06] weak by disbelieving by by by
[1:20:10] Desiring according to her own flesh she
[1:20:12] she desired to be like God he said oh
[1:20:15] but the day that you eat thereof you
[1:20:17] will be like
[1:20:19] God in other words he was trying to
[1:20:21] pervert that you could be a creator
[1:20:24] because I could inem because it was
[1:20:26] adultery that took place in the Garden
[1:20:28] of
[1:20:29] Eden he he deceived Eve made love to her
[1:20:34] and injected seed in there that brought
[1:20:36] forth
[1:20:38] Cain
[1:20:40] amen he that's that's what he you know
[1:20:43] you can be like God you can create like
[1:20:45] God look at God created all of these
[1:20:47] things you can be a Creator that's why
[1:20:50] God you know he'll you know he'll he'll
[1:20:51] pervert even Believers and oh you can
[1:20:54] speak anything you can speak this speak
[1:20:57] that and if you ain't got the character
[1:20:59] and your boss gets you mad you're trying
[1:21:01] to speak him under a
[1:21:05] car because you don't have the character
[1:21:08] or the ability to recognize what it is
[1:21:11] to really be in the throne with him amen
[1:21:15] praise God so you know your reasoning
[1:21:19] will try to get you to think what's in
[1:21:23] it for me attitude you know if I serve
[1:21:25] the Lord what's in it for
[1:21:27] me I'll tell you what's in it for you
[1:21:31] salvation a lot of people don't realize
[1:21:34] they you know people cry out scream why
[1:21:38] is this happening to me why is this
[1:21:40] happening to me and they'll they'll
[1:21:42] they'll Curse God not realizing that he
[1:21:45] is allowing them to go through that so
[1:21:48] that they can look to him for salvation
[1:21:52] am don't you want salvation from that
[1:21:56] pain don't you want salvation from that
[1:21:59] hurt don't you want salvation knowing
[1:22:02] like I can I can imagine there's people
[1:22:05] in Gaza in different parts of the Middle
[1:22:07] East there that are experiencing the
[1:22:09] atrocities and the terrible uh
[1:22:12] experiences that they're having they're
[1:22:15] crying out they're crying out and that
[1:22:18] cry needs to be to Jesus Christ because
[1:22:21] he's the only savior that can save the
[1:22:24] them from that Affliction amen so we
[1:22:27] want to we want to have the right
[1:22:28] attitude we we don't want to be looking
[1:22:31] at you know when we get hungry we're
[1:22:33] going to we're going to compromise on
[1:22:34] the word of God when we get when we get
[1:22:37] weak we're going to compromise on the
[1:22:39] word of
[1:22:41] God Jesus knew exactly who he was he
[1:22:44] knew that he had to go through these
[1:22:46] trials he knew that he had to face the
[1:22:48] enemy he knew that he had to suffer and
[1:22:52] you as a son or a daughter of God I'm
[1:22:53] telling you you need to know that you
[1:22:55] will have to overcome situations in your
[1:22:58] life but it's going to it's going to
[1:23:01] revive you it's going to strengthen you
[1:23:03] it's going to give you victory over the
[1:23:05] circumstances in your life amen praise
[1:23:08] God look at the second assault Brother
[1:23:11] Braham speaking here and how can I
[1:23:12] overcome he says now the second assault
[1:23:14] I'll hurry just look like the time goes
[1:23:16] so fast the next great assault was that
[1:23:19] he made upon him that he would be a
[1:23:22] showoff
[1:23:24] and how that does hit God's servants to
[1:23:28] be a showoff to show what you can do
[1:23:32] glory to God hallelujah I'm a deliverer
[1:23:35] I'm Soul see see come up here on top of
[1:23:38] the temple and sat down here he tempted
[1:23:41] him to do it now remember he was tempted
[1:23:45] to do it hard said now if you want to be
[1:23:48] something before the people stand up
[1:23:50] here on this Temple and jump off you
[1:23:53] know temp in Jesus to show that that you
[1:23:57] know that that that he could I can do
[1:24:00] anything you know you got Christians
[1:24:02] that you know you got to be careful you
[1:24:04] got to stay
[1:24:06] balanced you got to stay balanced when
[1:24:08] you're walking with the Lord and it's

[1:24:15] but you want to stay balanced you don't
[1:24:16] want to be you know uh you know like be
[1:24:19] zealous for the Lord but don't go
[1:24:22] tempting the Lord
[1:24:24] somebody comes up to you and says oh
[1:24:26] you're a Christian e well I got a snake
[1:24:29] over there it's a ronal snake it's my
[1:24:32] pet I dare you to put your hand into the
[1:24:35] cage and grab a hold of
[1:24:38] them that's just the
[1:24:42] devil it's the same devil that said to
[1:24:44] Jesus jump off the
[1:24:46] Hill somebody's going to grab you and
[1:24:49] you're not going to get hurt yeah we
[1:24:50] know the scripture says that that we can
[1:24:53] drink a poison and and and a serpent
[1:24:56] could bite us and any deadly thing will
[1:24:57] not harm us but it's not but did you
[1:25:00] read the Scripture it doesn't say you
[1:25:02] can go and tempt them you can go and
[1:25:05] tempt God because you're tempting God
[1:25:07] when you're doing that you're showing
[1:25:08] off you're trying to you're you're
[1:25:10] putting yourself you know before the
[1:25:13] people instead of putting God in in in
[1:25:16] there and standing on the word of God
[1:25:18] just like uh radshack mhach and Abednego
[1:25:22] when when when they when when
[1:25:23] Nebuchadnezzar said put him in the
[1:25:26] fire they didn't want to go into that
[1:25:29] furnace but they knew that God was a
[1:25:31] reality in their life and they knew that
[1:25:33] there was a gun to their head a sword to
[1:25:35] their head and they they were pushing
[1:25:36] them and put up the fire seven
[1:25:39] times and they walked in there but guess
[1:25:42] who was in there with them Jesus was
[1:25:45] there he was there before they were
[1:25:47] there amen and that's why when you face
[1:25:50] situations and you go into circumstances
[1:25:53] I want you to know that if you trust God
[1:25:55] with all of your heart and the situation
[1:25:58] arises Jesus will be meeting you there
[1:26:01] before you get there amen hallelujah
[1:26:05] glory to God now remember he was tempted
[1:26:08] to do it yes sir I'll give you a
[1:26:10] scripture for it because it's written
[1:26:12] he'd give Angels charge over
[1:26:20] thee uh now remember uh uh I'll give you
[1:26:24] a scripture he'll give the Angels charge
[1:26:26] over thee lest any time you dash a foot
[1:26:30] against a stone he'd bear thee up to
[1:26:33] make him a showoff to show his authority
[1:26:36] but you see how the devil gets the devil
[1:26:39] wants you to mind him the devil will try
[1:26:43] to distract you people will come and try
[1:26:45] to pull you away from you know tempt you
[1:26:48] in your faith oh you believe God e oh
[1:26:51] you believe this you believe that well
[1:26:52] what about this situation
[1:26:54] what about that and he'll point out
[1:26:56] situations that are in your
[1:26:58] life you need to know how to how to be
[1:27:01] still at those times you need to know
[1:27:04] how to trust God when the enemy comes
[1:27:06] and exposes things in your life and you
[1:27:09] know that you know that that it's a
[1:27:11] circumstance but you're just waiting on
[1:27:13] God you know that it's it's something
[1:27:16] that that that doesn't look really good
[1:27:18] right now but you're waiting on God
[1:27:21] you're trusting God and you're going to
[1:27:23] turn around you're going to say the Lord
[1:27:25] my God he is my
[1:27:27] healer oh you got cancer do you oh I
[1:27:31] thought you know I thought you were a
[1:27:32] Believer and that that God is your
[1:27:35] healer You're darn right he is he's my
[1:27:38] healer the doctor says I got cancer
[1:27:42] that's fine they've even diagnosed it
[1:27:44] and seen it in my body it's there it's
[1:27:47] in the X-ray yes sir but God is my
[1:27:51] healer and God has a time and a season
[1:27:54] for all things and he's the Lord God
[1:27:57] that giveth and the Lord God that taketh
[1:28:00] listen John the Baptist had a job to do
[1:28:03] but when God was done with him he
[1:28:06] allowed him to have his head sheared
[1:28:08] right
[1:28:12] off God is
[1:28:14] Sovereign God knows everything God knows
[1:28:18] why he allows everything to come into
[1:28:21] our lives but that doesn't change our
[1:28:25] stand doesn't change what we believe and
[1:28:28] how we are to
[1:28:30] overcome we overcome by the word nothing
[1:28:34] else will give us power to overcome but
[1:28:38] the word amen so he gets you he minding
[1:28:42] uh you know the devil wants you to mind
[1:28:44] him he minded only what the father said
[1:28:47] do that's what Jesus did he said that's
[1:28:49] right he said why Satan said it's
[1:28:51] written he'd give the Angels charge he
[1:28:54] said yes but it's also
[1:28:56] written see there you are see he knew
[1:29:00] who he was Satan did the thought runs
[1:29:04] deeper than what is wrote there see it's
[1:29:08] inspiration the kernel is on the
[1:29:11] inside and inside of you in that in that
[1:29:18] overcoming stand and testimony as a son
[1:29:21] or a daughter of God there's an
[1:29:22] inspiration that goes
[1:29:24] deeper and that's what's that's
[1:29:28] God that's the god that's in you that's
[1:29:31] the one that can overcome that can deal
[1:29:33] with that can that can heal your
[1:29:36] circumstances all of a sudden you wake
[1:29:37] up one day I remember I stood on this
[1:29:40] platform for for the first 10 years or
[1:29:43] so I can't remember how many years in
[1:29:46] pain constantly in pain playing my bass
[1:29:49] guitar having to sit down having to get
[1:29:52] up having to sit down every time that
[1:29:54] the that you know the pastor would would
[1:29:56] would say you have a need my God anytime
[1:29:59] I was standing over there that was the
[1:30:00] first thing that would come to my mind
[1:30:02] because the pain was on my mind it was
[1:30:05] constant it was a reality it was
[1:30:08] something that was real but I knew that
[1:30:11] God was a
[1:30:12] Healer and if it didn't happen this year
[1:30:15] it's going to happen next year or the
[1:30:17] year after and one day I'm standing up
[1:30:20] there and I don't even remember how many
[1:30:22] months had gone by and I'm going
[1:30:26] I got and that's
[1:30:29] gone it's
[1:30:33] gone you see you got to claim it you got
[1:30:36] to believe it and you got to stand until
[1:30:39] God interprets it don't put your own
[1:30:42] interpretation on how you're going to
[1:30:44] overcome just believe that greater is he
[1:30:47] that is in you than he that's in this
[1:30:49] world and that situation has to move it
[1:30:53] has to move in God's time I quote the
[1:30:56] scripture God makes all things beautiful
[1:30:59] in his time not my time you're
[1:31:02] distracted right now you're you're
[1:31:04] you're you're you're discouraged you're
[1:31:06] you're upset you know you're you know
[1:31:08] because sometimes you you talk to people
[1:31:10] and they get all upset and they're
[1:31:12] wondering why this is happening why this
[1:31:14] situation I said listen settle down
[1:31:17] let's get right back to the foundation
[1:31:19] here we got to go back and stand where
[1:31:22] God wants us to stand and that is on his
[1:31:25] word on his promises amen and until we
[1:31:29] come to that you're not going to
[1:31:32] overcome you're going to be battling
[1:31:34] you're gonna you're gonna one day you're
[1:31:36] you're all excited and the next day the
[1:31:38] devil takes a shot at you and right way
[1:31:40] oh I see I never it never worked it
[1:31:42] didn't work no if the devil is attacking
[1:31:46] you and striking you over and over and
[1:31:48] over again it's because you're getting
[1:31:50] Victory amen it's because you're
[1:31:52] overcoming it's because you're because
[1:31:55] he he wants to bring you down he wants
[1:31:57] you to get you out of the church he
[1:31:59] wants you to walk away from the body of
[1:32:01] Christ he's going to keep attacking you
[1:32:03] and where does he attack you right here
[1:32:06] right here over and over again you get
[1:32:08] up in the morning he's right there he's
[1:32:10] punching in right away okay new day
[1:32:14] you're defeated you can't do it today
[1:32:17] don't you see everybody's against you oh
[1:32:20] look at your children look at your bills
[1:32:22] the bills are coming next week oh that
[1:32:25] other bill is coming oh there's that's
[1:32:27] how he
[1:32:29] works and you got to say he's Jehovah
[1:32:32] Gyra when he tells you about the bills
[1:32:34] you say no no he's Jehovah Gyra he's
[1:32:37] going to
[1:32:38] provide I believe the word of God I'm
[1:32:40] not going to believe your lies I'm going
[1:32:42] to resist your lies amen when you resist
[1:32:45] he's got to
[1:32:47] flee Hallelujah now here's a good thing
[1:32:50] see sometimes Satan can take you and
[1:32:53] when you think think that you're doing
[1:32:54] the will of God and can make you a
[1:32:56] proposition you'll fall for it yes sir
[1:32:59] he sure can no true servant of God ever
[1:33:03] does that you see a man showing off his
[1:33:06] chest out or all like that just remember
[1:33:09] there's something wrong there no God
[1:33:12] don't want that Jesus set the example he
[1:33:16] could have done it he certainly could
[1:33:18] have done it but he didn't do it no
[1:33:22] servant of God is a show up of himself
[1:33:25] to try to take God's power and show
[1:33:27] himself above somebody
[1:33:30] else exalting self instead of exalting
[1:33:36] Christ oh I can do
[1:33:39] this when the brother said this morning
[1:33:42] I'm talking to him on the phone he says
[1:33:44] he says can you help him I said the Lord
[1:33:47] can help him I would be happy to pray
[1:33:50] for him I would be happy to talk to him
[1:33:53] but it's the Lord that can set him free
[1:33:57] it was the Lord that Set Me Free I
[1:34:00] didn't do it by myself I had to I had to
[1:34:04] just give
[1:34:05] up God had to just keep hitting me and
[1:34:08] Gabe would call me every every once in a
[1:34:10] while hey I'm going by you want to come
[1:34:12] to church this
[1:34:14] week I would say how many times you go
[1:34:16] to church cuz you always be asking me he
[1:34:20] said I go three times a week I said
[1:34:22] what three three times a
[1:34:26] week
[1:34:27] finally I was at a point where I
[1:34:30] realized that you know what maybe I
[1:34:34] should go something inside of me because
[1:34:37] I knew when I looked this way at my
[1:34:40] life I said man I can't face that I
[1:34:43] don't want that life anymore and so
[1:34:47] sometimes God will bring you to a
[1:34:49] place where you are not going to love
[1:34:52] yourself you're going to look at
[1:34:54] yourself you're not going to like the
[1:34:55] condition you're in you're not going to
[1:34:57] like the attitude that's on yourself
[1:34:59] you're going to hate the way that you're
[1:35:01] feeling you're going to hate the way
[1:35:03] that the enemy is bringing you down and
[1:35:05] causing you to act and everything else
[1:35:07] and then you're going to surrender and
[1:35:09] you're going to go right back to where
[1:35:11] he where he where he wants you right
[1:35:14] back remember he positions you he places
[1:35:17] you and when he places you it's because
[1:35:19] he wants you right there because he's
[1:35:21] got a work for you to do he's got
[1:35:24] something that's going to edify the body
[1:35:26] of Christ and is going to change this
[1:35:28] local body in the moment and in the
[1:35:31] twinkling of an I when we overcome
[1:35:33] together in the unity of the faith the
[1:35:36] supernatural comes
[1:35:37] in remember you know brother Brandon
[1:35:40] made that quote he says if everybody in
[1:35:43] this place would come to a place where
[1:35:45] they could look to their left or look to
[1:35:47] their right and see their brother and
[1:35:49] sister and see them as attributes of God
[1:35:52] see them as Sons son and daughters of
[1:35:55] God and project nothing but perfect love
[1:35:58] into that situation and and and get rid
[1:36:01] of all that negative feeling and all
[1:36:03] that the the lies of the enemy he says
[1:36:06] there wouldn't be one feeble person in
[1:36:08] our
[1:36:09] midst I believe that I believe he can do
[1:36:13] that for us even now I believe he can
[1:36:16] transform this church and make it a
[1:36:18] Powerhouse for where people can come in
[1:36:20] and the power of God can sweep down and
[1:36:23] and heal and and and deliver and set
[1:36:26] free and and and bring joy unspeakable
[1:36:29] because Joy is your
[1:36:31] strength we want joy in the house of the
[1:36:34] Lord amen praise God hallelujah I love
[1:36:36] the joy of the Lord amen praise God I
[1:36:39] love singing that song I just don't have
[1:36:42] the voice anymore to do it and laugh the
[1:36:44] way I used to but I used to love it that

[1:37:00] because they're
[1:37:01] wealthy and they want to influence the
[1:37:04] minister right they want to influence
[1:37:06] the leadership of the church they want
[1:37:09] to take control because of their

[1:37:58] like when when Jesus really knocks on
[1:38:01] your
[1:38:03] door and he starts to really you know
[1:38:06] knock on your heart and he starts to
[1:38:08] discern your situation starts to really
[1:38:12] tell you who you really are and where
[1:38:14] you stand and the portion of that and
[1:38:17] all that money that you got that's in
[1:38:19] the bank ain't going to do you one good
[1:38:22] in glory because you can't buy there is
[1:38:25] no price on your salvation it is
[1:38:28] something that is only directly given
[1:38:31] personally by Jesus Christ to you
[1:38:34] personal amen you personal not through
[1:38:38] your friend not through your influence
[1:38:40] not through not because I go to this
[1:38:42] church and he's the he's got the most
[1:38:44] people going to the church than all the
[1:38:45] community so if most of the people are
[1:38:48] going there then I should be going there
[1:38:50] listen everybody's got to go where
[1:38:52] they're supposed to go
[1:38:54] I'm not saying anything all I'm saying
[1:38:57] is that this place here we get to the
[1:39:02] word we talk about the word we lead the
[1:39:05] People by the word we want to see true
[1:39:09] genuine births by the word of God not
[1:39:12] some confession you know that you know
[1:39:15] you go in a a a a a a dry Sinner and you
[1:39:19] come out a wet sinner you just go right
[1:39:20] back to the same life no we're talking
[1:39:23] about the reality the change the Born
[1:39:25] Again experience the transformation of a
[1:39:28] son or a daughter of God amen glory to
[1:39:31] God Amen so even in the message listen
[1:39:35] even people will say I believe William
[1:39:37] brandom to be the
[1:39:39] prophet but they haven't even
[1:39:42] overcome the fact that William brandham
[1:39:46] came to introduce us to the Lord Jesus
[1:39:49] Christ not to
[1:39:51] himself and the people are so focused on
[1:39:54] William Branham not realizing that their
[1:39:57] their eyes are too much on just just the
[1:40:00] tapes listening to the tapes that's all
[1:40:02] you got to do no you need to listen to
[1:40:04] the tapes but you also need to feed on
[1:40:07] the Living God in the midst of the
[1:40:09] five-fold ministry in the Church of God
[1:40:12] where where brother Brenham himself said
[1:40:14] you need to be in church he says you
[1:40:16] need to be there because the Judgment of
[1:40:19] the Lord starts in the house of the Lord
[1:40:21] you need to be there to be scoured
[1:40:23] to be cleaned to be fortified by the
[1:40:26] word of God as you're out there you know
[1:40:28] when you're in your car and you're just
[1:40:30] listening to brother brandom and it's
[1:40:31] just you and him and your feeding and
[1:40:33] everything else that's great it's
[1:40:35] wonderful and God will speak to you in
[1:40:37] those things but if your mind is only
[1:40:40] that's all I need I don't need a pastor
[1:40:44] I don't need to pay tithes I don't need
[1:40:47] to give offerings if I want to give it
[1:40:49] I'll send it to the voice of God listen
[1:40:51] there's nothing wrong with sending money
[1:40:53] to the voice of God we send money to the
[1:40:55] voice of God we support the voice of God
[1:40:58] because we support the ministry we know
[1:41:00] that it was the angel to this church age
[1:41:03] we know that he was a prophet in the
[1:41:05] 20th century we've recognized everything
[1:41:09] brother Bram fulfilled in the scriptures
[1:41:11] Malachi 4:5 Revelations 10:7 the opening
[1:41:14] of the seals all of those things and we
[1:41:17] need them and that's why we're here we
[1:41:19] wouldn't be here had we not recognized
[1:41:22] that but he did it like John the Baptist
[1:41:25] I must decrease so that he can increase
[1:41:29] so that he can come on the scene and
[1:41:32] start dealing with you personal because
[1:41:34] you cannot overcome by flashing the tape
[1:41:38] of William
[1:41:41] brandham you're not going to overcome by
[1:41:43] just quoting William
[1:41:46] brandham you're going to overcome by
[1:41:48] knowing that greater is he that is in me
[1:41:51] than he that is in the world amen and
[1:41:54] this is a reality this situation is real
[1:41:56] and I believe the word I'm going to
[1:41:58] overcome because of my circum like like
[1:42:01] like like when they went into that
[1:42:03] furnace they went in there believing
[1:42:05] God's
[1:42:06] word and if it meant that they were
[1:42:08] going to burn up and be turned into Ash
[1:42:11] well praise God they knew that their
[1:42:13] bodies would just go from this Earthly
[1:42:15] Tabernacle to another one that's
[1:42:19] waiting Hallelujah they say I am in the
[1:42:22] message but is the message in
[1:42:26] you you see Christ is the message Jesus
[1:42:30] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:42:31] forever is the message we're not here to
[1:42:34] promote a man we're here to promote
[1:42:37] Jesus Christ who is the same yesterday
[1:42:40] today and forever wants to come into
[1:42:42] your life give you a revelation of the
[1:42:45] word for your day and you will never
[1:42:48] miss William brandham you will never
[1:42:50] miss Luther you'll never miss Wesley you
[1:42:53] will see the Reformation right there
[1:42:56] before your eyes you will see that it's
[1:42:58] in history you will see all the things
[1:43:00] that are going on in the world that it
[1:43:02] was all prophecy that is now being
[1:43:04] fulfilled you will see it crystal clear
[1:43:08] because the Holy Ghost will come in you
[1:43:11] and guide you like Jesus said into all
[1:43:15] truth you see you need the Holy Ghost
[1:43:18] you need the Holy Ghost you need him
[1:43:20] leading you you need him in you you you
[1:43:23] need him overcoming in you amen praise
[1:43:25] God listen to uh brother Bram says he
[1:43:28] says here and humble thyselves you know
[1:43:29] people they want Power they really they
[1:43:33] they they don't know what power is see
[1:43:37] he says they don't really know what what
[1:43:40] what goes with it the Way Up Is Down
[1:43:43] always if you want Power see humble you
[1:43:48] see how humble you can
[1:43:50] get just get away from all your worldly
[1:43:54] thinking and humble yourself before God
[1:43:58] and then you're and then you've got more
[1:44:00] power than the man that runs all over
[1:44:02] the building and makes a big lot of
[1:44:06] noise because you have been able to
[1:44:09] conquer yourself he
[1:44:11] says and commit yourself to Christ you
[1:44:14] see to humble yourself before him that's
[1:44:19] real power saints that is so true
[1:44:24] you show me a church that's humble real
[1:44:27] humble not an arrogant church just a
[1:44:30] sweet Humble Church I'll show you a
[1:44:32] church that has the favor and power of
[1:44:35] God in it that's right that's what he
[1:44:39] says that's the thing it takes humility
[1:44:42] humbling ourselves before God and
[1:44:45] letting God just work through us don't
[1:44:49] have to make a lot of noise above all
[1:44:51] things it's our IND individual Souls
[1:44:54] that were responsible before God in
[1:44:57] other words he's saying listen make sure
[1:44:59] your own calling an election don't be
[1:45:01] looking at your brother don't be looking
[1:45:03] at your sister be looking to you know
[1:45:06] don't don't be looking at their faults
[1:45:08] don't be looking at their weaknesses
[1:45:10] look at them in prayer trusting God In
[1:45:14] Prayer believing for them in prayer that
[1:45:18] God will do a great work and and break
[1:45:22] the power of the enemy in our lives amen
[1:45:25] hallelujah as I've always found out that
[1:45:28] the man that humbles himself is the man
[1:45:30] that God exalts and when you take a
[1:45:32] person with his chest out knows
[1:45:35] everything and you can't tell him
[1:45:37] nothing and he's arrogant and well
[1:45:39] that's that person that never gets
[1:45:42] anywhere but you take that person that
[1:45:44] humbles themselves and walks sweetly
[1:45:47] with God you're going to see the power
[1:45:51] of God hallelujah
[1:45:55] now don't miss this he says when this
[1:45:59] great battle started on Earth there had
[1:46:01] to be a mutual meeting place and we know
[1:46:04] where that meeting place is it's right
[1:46:06] here you got to stop listening to the
[1:46:09] enemy you got to stop allowing him to
[1:46:12] bring you down to convince you of
[1:46:15] something that God has not shown
[1:46:18] you listen if God is doing something in
[1:46:21] your life he always always works on both
[1:46:24] ends don't be don't be trying to work
[1:46:27] everything out on your own end you said
[1:46:30] you see that's the problem you're trying
[1:46:31] to interpret everything on your own end
[1:46:33] and not allowing God to work from the
[1:46:36] other end so that he can meet you right
[1:46:38] there in the middle and show you that
[1:46:40] he's in the midst of it amen that's
[1:46:43] where you get Revival that's where you
[1:46:46] get strength and that's where you get
[1:46:48] revived you become encouraged by the
[1:46:50] word of God and all of a sudden every
[1:46:53] changes around you the Lord all of a
[1:46:56] sudden that Gloom that oppression that
[1:46:59] depression it
[1:47:01] leaves because you've been trying to do
[1:47:03] it all on your own he says here there
[1:47:06] had to be a mutual meeting place there
[1:47:08] had to be a place selected for the
[1:47:10] battle to begin and for the battle to
[1:47:12] rage and that's the Battle Ground begins
[1:47:14] in the human mind there's where the
[1:47:17] battle starts the human mind was chosen
[1:47:20] for the place of the battle where was to
[1:47:23] begin and that is because that decisions
[1:47:26] are made from the mind and from the
[1:47:29] brain but you know where they're
[1:47:31] believed or accepted in the heart oh
[1:47:36] yeah as a man thinketh in his
[1:47:40] heart you see that's where you make that
[1:47:42] final decision that's where you give
[1:47:45] your heart to the situation you need to
[1:47:48] give your heart to the Lord amen glory
[1:47:52] to God now let's look at the final
[1:47:53] assault here as we wind this down the
[1:47:56] third great assault Satan offered to
[1:47:57] Forfeit this Kingdom to him he did Satan
[1:48:00] said see these kingdoms of the world
[1:48:02] they're all mine and I do with them
[1:48:04] whatever I want to I'll forfeit them to
[1:48:07] you but remember he was trying to get
[1:48:09] him to Forfeit it without the cross
[1:48:12] listen this
[1:48:14] world Satan still has control over all
[1:48:17] the kingdoms of this world how many
[1:48:19] knows that you've got to be able to see
[1:48:22] that
[1:48:23] okay and he's going to you know Satan's
[1:48:25] going to use the same tactics on you to
[1:48:28] try to get you to believe certain
[1:48:30] worldly government teachings and and the
[1:48:33] way that that everything is going to
[1:48:35] work out and that you know this is how
[1:48:38] the Antichrist is going to be made known
[1:48:40] this is how the world is going to go
[1:48:42] into chaos or this is all just going to
[1:48:45] pass or whatever listen we know what the
[1:48:49] word says we know the prophecy of God's
[1:48:52] word we know that heavens and earth will
[1:48:54] pass away and that the word of God will
[1:48:57] never pass away we know that the
[1:48:59] kingdoms that are out there are going to
[1:49:02] fall and Satan is not going to tempt Us
[1:49:05] by by showing us the kingdoms of the
[1:49:07] world and and that our government is the
[1:49:10] best government and we're going to stand
[1:49:12] for the Canadian government and we're
[1:49:14] going to vote for Trudeau or we're going
[1:49:15] to vote for the other guy there or we're
[1:49:18] going to vote for this one or we're
[1:49:19] going to be a Democrat or we're going to
[1:49:21] be a Republican
[1:49:23] Christians are not any of that there's
[1:49:27] nothing wrong with supporting your local
[1:49:30] municipality if you believe in it you
[1:49:32] want to support in certain aspects of it
[1:49:34] whatever it is you want to vote that's
[1:49:37] entirely up to you you can vote nothing
[1:49:39] wrong with that but you need to know who
[1:49:42] you are where you stand and what is
[1:49:44] actually going on out there and how
[1:49:46] things are going to work out things are
[1:49:48] not going to work out the way that you
[1:49:51] think and the way that the world thinks
[1:49:53] it's going to work out we know that
[1:49:56] Satan is going to have his time and he's
[1:49:58] got his control over the kingdoms of
[1:50:00] this world he still has them look he
[1:50:02] offered them to Jesus but Jesus knew
[1:50:05] that there would be no way to bring us
[1:50:07] back if he bypassed the
[1:50:11] cross he says Satan says worship me and
[1:50:15] I'll give you the kingdoms of the world
[1:50:18] Satan might come to you and get and
[1:50:20] offer you a job
[1:50:23] but you got to leave the
[1:50:25] church you got to go live in another
[1:50:28] part of the country where there is no
[1:50:30] church you got to go and and and uh work
[1:50:33] at a job that you know you're surrounded
[1:50:36] by total
[1:50:39] unbelief but you need to pay that bill
[1:50:42] so
[1:50:43] bad and you will
[1:50:45] compromise don't let him offer you
[1:50:49] anything that's going to take you from
[1:50:51] this word
[1:50:53] amen this word can never
[1:50:57] change everything around you can change
[1:51:00] God can change your circumstances God
[1:51:03] can deal with your circumstances God can
[1:51:06] provide your financial needs God can
[1:51:08] heal your body you don't need to to to
[1:51:11] be going spending hundreds of thousands
[1:51:13] of dollars in order to go and and and
[1:51:15] take a surgery in another part of the
[1:51:17] world because the doctor over there he
[1:51:19] did one and and cured the same person of
[1:51:21] the same illness no no those are all
[1:51:23] Temptations those are all things to get
[1:51:25] you away from standing on the word of
[1:51:29] God hallelujah praise God
[1:51:33] Amen but remember he was trying to get
[1:51:36] him to Forfeit it without the cross if
[1:51:38] he did we'd be lost he could have took
[1:51:40] the kingdom but he he followed he must
[1:51:42] come back he was tempted to do it now
[1:51:45] death is a hard thing he was tempted to
[1:51:47] take his Liberty and be the king of the
[1:51:49] earth without the cross but if he did
[1:51:52] his subjects would have died we would
[1:51:54] have never been redeemed Satan would
[1:51:57] have gladly made that proposition with
[1:52:00] him but he said get behind me Satan he
[1:52:02] didn't do it he come and he suffered and
[1:52:05] he took the hard rugged root he took the
[1:52:08] root of persecution he took the hard
[1:52:10] rugged root he took the uh he took the
[1:52:13] root of death and are we this morning
[1:52:16] willing to do that take that root that
[1:52:19] he has taken are you willing to die are
[1:52:22] you willing to give yourself up to God
[1:52:25] forfeit all the world and the things to
[1:52:27] serve him amen glory to God listen
[1:52:32] there's a victory for the Sons and
[1:52:35] Daughters of God in this scripture that
[1:52:37] we read and let me read it to you here
[1:52:40] it's a Divine promise amen and brother
[1:52:42] Braham says it reaches the weakest of
[1:52:45] Christians Listen to the message he said
[1:52:47] here in Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:52:49] today and forever he says now we find
[1:52:52] him as soon as God Came Upon him he's
[1:52:54] talking about Jesus going into the
[1:52:56] Wilderness he was anointed went into the
[1:52:59] Wilderness and out of that 40 days and
[1:53:03] defeated Satan by the word of God what
[1:53:06] did he do he brought any Divine promise
[1:53:10] in reach of the weakest of
[1:53:14] Christians he showed to each and every
[1:53:17] one of us that there is nothing that we
[1:53:21] cannot over come amen he brought any
[1:53:24] Divine problem if he was God why did he
[1:53:27] let Satan say if thou be the Son of God
[1:53:30] perform a miracle here and show me you
[1:53:32] can do it turn these stones into bread
[1:53:34] and eat he said it is written man shall
[1:53:38] not live by bread alone so then as Satan
[1:53:40] always tries to coat the word went back
[1:53:44] and told him when he when he put him at
[1:53:48] the Pinnacle of the temple and he again
[1:53:50] it is written and he defeated sat Satan
[1:53:52] on the word of God that shows that you
[1:53:55] can defeat Satan on the word of
[1:53:58] God no matter the word of God will
[1:54:01] defeat Satan any place anywhere under
[1:54:05] any condition it is in the belly if
[1:54:07] you're in the belly of a whale or you're
[1:54:09] in a lion's den it's it's on the it's on
[1:54:13] the bed with cancer or laying Yonder
[1:54:16] bleeding to death in an automobile
[1:54:18] accident the word of God will defeat
[1:54:21] Satan any
[1:54:23] where and the weakest Christian can use
[1:54:26] it it's your god-given privilege to do
[1:54:31] it
[1:54:35] hallelujah amen praise God just stand on
[1:54:38] the word amen let's go to the next
[1:54:40] scripture here we're going to wind this
[1:54:42] right off uh listen listen here now
[1:54:45] let's look at Daniel Daniel stood now
[1:54:48] Daniel knew that the writing was signed
[1:54:50] he knew that there was a decree that
[1:54:52] said hey you don't bow to anything but
[1:54:55] that
[1:54:56] statue you don't bow to anything because
[1:54:59] Nebuchadnezzar had made The Plea he had
[1:55:01] called it out he says anybody doesn't
[1:55:03] kneel to that statue and that was a
[1:55:05] statue of Daniel himself that's
[1:55:08] right you know and here here here you
[1:55:11] know Satan was trying to tempt him to
[1:55:13] show and here he says he went into his
[1:55:17] house and his windows being open in his
[1:55:20] chamber towards Jerusalem he didn't care
[1:55:22] who saw him right he was not going to
[1:55:24] bow to that he kneeled upon his knees
[1:55:27] three times a day and prayed and gave
[1:55:29] thanks before his God and he did as he
[1:55:34] did a four time they would look to that
[1:55:36] Temple look to the East look to that
[1:55:38] Temple they would pray to the god that
[1:55:40] they knew was their God Amen they didn't
[1:55:44] care what Nebuchadnezzar said they
[1:55:46] didn't care what the government was
[1:55:48] telling them to do it doesn't matter
[1:55:50] what the government tells us to do We
[1:55:52] Believe God's word and we will stand on
[1:55:55] the word of God Jesus Christ the same
[1:55:57] yesterday today and forever they want to
[1:55:59] come and close our churches because of
[1:56:02] of of trinitarian Doctrine or whatever
[1:56:04] it is that they're going to try to use
[1:56:06] to try and bring the World Council of
[1:56:08] churches together it's irrelevant to the
[1:56:10] Sons and Daughters of God because God is
[1:56:13] with us God will stand with us in
[1:56:16] whatever situation we will face amen
[1:56:19] praise God so Daniel now look now look
[1:56:22] look at the next slide here so Daniel
[1:56:25] did what he had to do but look then the
[1:56:27] king arose very early in the morning and
[1:56:29] went in haste under the den of the
[1:56:32] Lions because remember Daniel was thrown
[1:56:35] into the lion's den they couldn't go
[1:56:37] against the king's word but the king
[1:56:39] loved
[1:56:40] Daniel he was he was wondering oh my
[1:56:43] gosh what am I going to do but you know
[1:56:45] what maybe his God is God you need to
[1:56:49] stand on the word of God hallelujah you
[1:56:51] need to let people say whatever they
[1:56:53] need to say but God will prove in your
[1:56:56] life if you've if you've surrendered
[1:56:59] completely to him don't you worry about
[1:57:01] the circumstances the situations the
[1:57:04] oppression the the the the the the the
[1:57:07] insults or whatever comes your way
[1:57:09] because of what you believe God will
[1:57:11] prove himself and look at the king he he
[1:57:14] goes there and when he came to the den
[1:57:16] he cried with a lamentable voice unto
[1:57:19] Daniel he was he was like oh
[1:57:22] let this be his God that's what was in
[1:57:24] his mind he didn't want him to be eaten
[1:57:26] up and being digested by the Lions no
[1:57:29] sir he said he said and when he came he
[1:57:31] cried and he said he said with a
[1:57:33] lamentable voice unto Daniel and the
[1:57:35] King spake and said to Daniel oh Daniel
[1:57:39] servant of the Living God oh yeah listen
[1:57:43] the enemy listen your your friends your
[1:57:46] family your you know their situations
[1:57:48] are going to come upon their lives and
[1:57:50] at some point God you know God forbid
[1:57:53] situations do happen but they're going
[1:57:56] to come and they're going to realize
[1:57:57] wait a minute the Living God the one
[1:58:00] that you've been talking about is thy
[1:58:02] God whom thou servest continually able
[1:58:05] to deliver thee from the Lions and then
[1:58:09] said Daniel unto the king oh King live
[1:58:11] forever hallelujah oh yeah you listen
[1:58:15] don't worry my God is God he's going to
[1:58:19] prove himself he's going to show himself
[1:58:22] in whatever situation yes sir then
[1:58:24] Daniel unto the king said live he says
[1:58:26] my God hath sent angels and hath shut
[1:58:30] the Lion's mouths that they not hurt me
[1:58:34] for as much as before him innocency was
[1:58:39] found in me and also before thee Oh King
[1:58:43] have I done no
[1:58:45] hurt then was the king exceedingly glad
[1:58:50] for him Hallelujah
[1:58:52] glory to God and commanded that they
[1:58:54] should take Daniel up out of the
[1:58:57] den So Daniel was taken up out of the
[1:59:00] den and no manner of hurt was found upon
[1:59:04] him
[1:59:05] because he believed
[1:59:08] God hallelujah praise God forever more
[1:59:12] let's go to the next scripture here
[1:59:13] we're going to finish this we're going
[1:59:14] to get this done 1
[1:59:17] Corinthians chapter 15 next slide
[1:59:23] it says you
[1:59:25] now I want you to remember it's when we
[1:59:29] started here overcoming in
[1:59:33] Christ
[1:59:35] Revival comes from
[1:59:37] overcoming your life transforms from
[1:59:40] overcoming you get Victory upon Victory
[1:59:44] upon Victory and every time you do that
[1:59:46] here a little there a little you're
[1:59:48] being changed you're being changed
[1:59:50] you're being you're you're overcoming
[1:59:52] this Dimension every time he says now
[1:59:55] listen listen here he says behold I show
[1:59:58] you a mystery we shall not all sleep but
[2:00:01] we shall all be changed in a moment in
[2:00:05] the twinkling of an eye at the last
[2:00:06] Trump for the trumpet shall sound and
[2:00:08] the dead in Christ shall be raised
[2:00:10] Incorruptible and we shall be changed
[2:00:13] for this corruptible must put on
[2:00:16] incorruption and this Mortal must put on
[2:00:19] immortality so when this corrupt able
[2:00:22] shall have put on incorruption and this
[2:00:25] Mortal shall have put on immortality
[2:00:28] then shall be brought to pass the saying
[2:00:30] that is written death is swallowed up in
[2:00:35] victory victory comes when you
[2:00:38] overcome listen here he says oh death
[2:00:41] where is your sting oh grave where is
[2:00:44] your Victory The Sting of death is sin
[2:00:47] it's unbelief it's when you disbelieve
[2:00:50] God's word when somebody comes to you
[2:00:52] and says no you have not been baptized
[2:00:54] you need to be baptized in the water in
[2:00:57] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:00:59] according to those scriptures in Acts
[2:01:02] chap 2 verse 38 and you turn around and
[2:01:05] say nonsense I was baptized as a baby
[2:01:08] you're in sin because sin is unbelief of
[2:01:13] God's word and when you say I don't need
[2:01:15] that experience according to the word
[2:01:18] it's because you don't believe it you're
[2:01:21] just saying right out front I don't care
[2:01:23] how religious you are I don't care how
[2:01:25] many times you go to church you're
[2:01:27] disbelieving the word of God and you're
[2:01:30] in sin and that's the sting of death
[2:01:34] that's death is sin and the strength of
[2:01:37] sin is the
[2:01:38] law now we don't want to get into all of
[2:01:40] that but thanks be to God which giveth
[2:01:43] us the victory through our Lord Jesus
[2:01:46] Christ therefore my beloved Brethren Ste
[2:01:50] be ye steadfast
[2:01:53] unmovable always abounding in the work
[2:01:56] of the Lord for as much as you know that
[2:01:58] your labor you're overcoming your your
[2:02:02] your your your your persistence in the
[2:02:04] word of God Amen you're laboring in the
[2:02:08] word you're trusting God it it is not in
[2:02:14] vain in the Lord amen it's going to
[2:02:17] bring you the change that you need it's
[2:02:21] going to bring you the Deliverance that
[2:02:23] you need it's going to take you out of
[2:02:25] that addiction it's going to take you
[2:02:27] out of that financial burden it's going
[2:02:29] to take you out of the sick bed
[2:02:32] Hallelujah and it's going to take you
[2:02:34] into a mortal being changed from Mortal
[2:02:38] into
[2:02:39] immortality it's going to take you into
[2:02:41] the Rapture let the musicians come amen
[2:02:44] praise God hallelujah this is the
[2:02:47] promise of God's word you think listen
[2:02:49] it's all tied to the rapture everything
[2:02:52] that we're preaching here is tied to the
[2:02:54] Rapture it's tied to the body change
[2:02:57] it's tied to the overcoming of the
[2:02:59] believer so that you can receive the
[2:03:01] change that God has for you wherever you
[2:03:04] are right now whatever circumstance you
[2:03:06] might be in God wants to change it
[2:03:09] Hallelujah listen next slide he says in
[2:03:13] Revelations 3:20 he says behold I stand
[2:03:16] at the door and knock If any man hear my
[2:03:19] voice and open the door I will come in
[2:03:22] to him and will suck with him he said I
[2:03:26] will come into him into not to them into
[2:03:30] him you personal amen and he with me to
[2:03:35] him that overcometh will I grant to sit
[2:03:38] with me in my Throne not on my throne in
[2:03:44] my Throne because if you're in Christ
[2:03:48] you're in him and greater is he that is
[2:03:51] in you than he that's in the world and
[2:03:53] now to him that overcometh will I grant
[2:03:56] to sit with me in my throne even as also
[2:03:58] I overcame he overcame for us don't be
[2:04:02] trying to overcome every little thing
[2:04:04] understand that when you come to this
[2:04:06] place of maturity in the Lord and you
[2:04:08] realize that hey I've accepted him I
[2:04:10] believe him I'm not going I'm not
[2:04:12] looking left right or Center I believe
[2:04:14] that he can overcome this situation in
[2:04:16] my life then you will overcome and you
[2:04:20] will realize that it was him in you
[2:04:22] overcoming because he's got to keep his
[2:04:24] own word amen glory to God but he says
[2:04:28] you'll sit with me and my father in his
[2:04:31] throne he that hath an ear let him hear
[2:04:33] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[2:04:36] you need to have an ear to
[2:04:41] hear praise God I'm going to end it with
[2:04:44] this last
[2:04:48] quote Hallelujah
[2:04:52] he says unless we suffer with him we
[2:04:56] cannot reign with him this is from the
[2:04:59] Samia Church age you have to suffer to
[2:05:02] rain the reason for this is that
[2:05:04] character simply is never made without
[2:05:09] suffering he says character is a victory
[2:05:13] it's not a
[2:05:15] gift you're not given the gift of
[2:05:19] character your character shows in the
[2:05:21] way you
[2:05:23] overcome your character is revealed by
[2:05:25] the way you overcome the circumstances
[2:05:28] that come into your life and character
[2:05:31] it's a victory it's something that where
[2:05:33] where you know he says a man without
[2:05:35] character can't Reign because power
[2:05:38] apart from character is satanic but
[2:05:40] Power with character it's fit to rule
[2:05:43] and since he wants us to share even his
[2:05:46] throne on the same basis that he
[2:05:48] overcame and has sat down in his
[2:05:51] father's Throne then we have to overcome
[2:05:54] to sit with
[2:05:56] him and the little temporary sufferings
[2:05:59] we go through now is not worthy to be
[2:06:02] compared to the tremendous Glory that
[2:06:05] will that that that that will be
[2:06:08] revealed in us when he comes oh what
[2:06:11] Treasures are laid up for those that are
[2:06:13] willing to enter into his kingdom
[2:06:16] through much
[2:06:18] tribulation glory to God did you notice
[2:06:21] here he says in the in the message and
[2:06:23] I'll end it with this quote how can I
[2:06:25] overcome he says the arrangements of
[2:06:27] that see set with me in my Throne not on
[2:06:31] my throne in my Throne that's in his
[2:06:34] domain see and there as as Christ is the
[2:06:38] ruler Throne ruler at this time of the
[2:06:42] complete domain of God so will the
[2:06:44] church be with him the bride be with him
[2:06:50] in his throne in the entire domain see
[2:06:53] not on my throne but in my Throne see
[2:06:56] where his domain reaches a throne is
[2:06:59] over domain and a domain reaches just as
[2:07:02] far as its boundaries go and this is
[2:07:05] from eternity to
[2:07:07] Eternity just think of it praise God
[2:07:13] hallelujah oh glory to God let's sing
