pressure why Satan know that the time is here and who has the who has the word of God right now it's you and me Hallelujah who is Christ Christ is in you my topic tonight is identifications where is your identity that's my topic tonight as we all know we are living in the last days the scripture said it it's not me that said it everything around you you can see nobody don't have to tell you Hallelujah the same the word of God says so mat 22 he said it many hearts are failing for fear there's never be a time when people fear like this time that's right they fear for their life they fear for the the living at this moment of time they fear for living in their own houses they fear for driving outside you know now how Satan has come so much down and when people even driving they can stop them and demand their car from their hands there's never a time like this before the pressure is on hallelujah amen but thank God greater is in us than he that is in the world oh my Christians you

how they're going to solve the crime the crime has so much R arise they don't know what to do yes every breed day you hear the news everywhere the pressure is on we are about to go home where is your identity are you identified with Christ amen or who are you identify with because the Bible says there's two spirit that is working right now first one and the truth One how can you identify them by their characteristic thank you Jesus amen the scriptures cannot lie ver bence everywhere meanwhile the church buildings are fill up with Christians why is it that and they still building churches everywhere everybody's a Christian how can you identify the false and the True Vine Hallelujah but why by what their characteristic then you can find them characteristic I can make you know the identity your character can show you where you stand can prove you your words your work as Christian Hallelujah because the Bible said the false what here false Christ false prophets so people has made thems to be Christians and people has called them themselves prophets prophetes everywhere and meanwhile the crown cannot stop but everybody is a Christian who is who how can you identify them one time I was solving the problem on the phone so I was talking to this guy to solve this problem the guy was in Africa and why on the phone he said me I am a I am Pentecostal header if this guy if this guy didn't do whatever he's supposed to do I will take him the a witchcraft I said what are you calling me to tell me you are Elder in the Pentecost you C this man put that phone down I will not talk to you anymore do whatever you want so I shut the phone down he called me several times and when he come back he oh I made a mistake I said no you reveal yourself you show your character where

time that you have to inquire about it Hallelujah if you know that you don't see the way you're supposed to see you remember when Paul went outside to minister and the holy Paul ask them have you received the Holy Ghost yet since you believe he said we haven't received the same way that we heard it you need the Holy Ghost if you haven't received it you got to go on your knees and and ask God God will give it to you is freely give Hallelujah is your responsible responsibility to know that you have the Holy Ghost by the word of God let me tell you last time I said God comes he going to change check the blood tag you didn't come to check the church your blood tag remember when a pain or anything hurt you you know how feeling it is how hard the Lord Jesus himself came down here you

pressure people love to stay home I want to stay home and watch on the TV I want to stay home and watch on the live it's good but remember sacrifice remember all of you drove here you burn your gasoline you're tired from work you think somebody who was who is sitting right on TV watching you're going to get the same benefit that you getting you burn something so you going to get more blessed

identity what shows you your daughter or son of God what is your character your characteristic shows your identity hallelujah thank you Lord I'm sorry I'm talking too much but I feel good Hallelujah so this is uh there is two identification one fult false and one truth let me read a little bit in here for you to hear you know the same way when God came here you called the people he called Fai to call Nathaniel and nael came in and the lord gave them everything and the gospel started the gospel never finish it remain the same thing so if you don't see the C you don't see Christ as we supposed

for the gospel the Lord Jesus Christ even said try me try me are you trying him oh brothers and sisters let's keep on goinging and we going to see the hand of God in our lives Hallelujah ah I going to read identifications Abraham 1964 paragraph 118 let us read a little here paragraph 118 I say I said the same thing tonight the old ter is gone but the word the word is still the T that identifies the characteristic of God the promise of the hour that we are living there is God's characters characteristic identified by the promise of the hour that we are living amen that makes God the same as he was in s times look in diverse maners he spoke to the fathers by the prophet and the law the and the law and Prophet were un until John since then the Kingdom of Heaven noticed but in this last day speaking the same thing he did then through his son Jesus Christ God in s time diverse maners spake to the fathers through the prophets in this last day doing the same thing speaking to the people the fathers through his son Christ Jesus he raised him up from the dead he lives within us identify himself and for telling us things that he is a designer of the thoughts and intents of the heart Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever God in Cal times and divers maners spake to the fathers through the prophet but in in last days through Jesus Christ his son the scripture cannot be tempered with it is exactly as I have said before God don't need anybody to interpret his word the inter he interpret his own word when he say anything it happens that's the interpretation see amen he don't need anyone to say well I believe it means this God identifies it by his own interpretation Hallelujah prise is is if the promise is far is for the day we can live in the light of of a Luther and can and can and can live in the light of Wesley we can't live in the light of any those we got to live in the light that is Promised for this day amen Hallelujah glory to God what if Moses would have went down in Egypt and said well we are going to build a big Ark we are going to float out on the country the Nas is going to come up they they do they do look back in the scroll there is no
