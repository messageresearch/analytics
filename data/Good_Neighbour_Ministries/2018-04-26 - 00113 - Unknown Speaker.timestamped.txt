[2:02] feasting up that's what's changing
[2:05] that's what makes you different from the
[2:07] rest of the churches over here being fed
[2:11] and spoken to from the Word of God by
[2:15] the word God by the Spirit of God in
[2:18] there's a huge difference then when
[2:21] somebody comes in and says and this week

[8:28] scenes because you like this carnal
[8:31] right
[8:32] it's mmm it looks for the easy way out
[8:40] it's just designed that way because it's
[8:41] part it's in sheep than iniquity so I
[8:45] don't care you have faith and you are
[8:49] sins according to the Word of God as an
[8:53] attribute of God giving but it's not too
[8:55] sure in this question you can make
[8:57] mistakes oh yeah you'll pick something
