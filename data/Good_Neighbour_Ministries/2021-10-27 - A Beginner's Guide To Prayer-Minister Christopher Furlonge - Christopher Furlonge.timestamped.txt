[10:49] we pray
[10:50] amen amen
[10:52] i'd just like to take a little quote
[10:55] reading
[10:56] from our prophet
[10:58] amen
[11:00] from the message expectation what man
[11:03] calls great god calls foolish
[11:06] and what man calls foolish god calls
[11:10] great so what we've got to do is get
[11:13] back into the program
[11:15] of god and find out after all what god's
[11:20] god wants us to do
[11:22] amen and the only way i know
[11:26] to do it is pray
[11:29] amen prayer is the key
[11:33] that's the answer
[11:35] prayer changes things
[11:38] prayer is the most
[11:40] powerful weapon
[11:42] that was ever put in control of the
[11:45] human being
[11:47] there's no atomic bomb bomb or no
[11:50] hydrogen bomb as powerful as spread
[11:55] amen
[11:56] and our prophet encourage us
[11:59] pray is the engine of the church
[12:02] so why don't and prayer brings god's
[12:05] blessings
[12:07] so why don't we pray pray pray amen
[12:11] and tonight i just want to just go into
[12:14] our let's study a beginner's guide
[12:17] to pray
[12:19] amen
[12:20] hallelujah
[12:23] next slide please the first thing we are
[12:25] going to learn
[12:26] we are wired
[12:29] to pray
[12:30] amen
[12:32] your creator design you in a way
[12:36] that prayer seems natural
[12:39] everybody in the world prays
[12:41] amen
[12:42] muslims praise hindu praise
[12:45] everyone prays every religion they have
[12:47] some form
[12:49] of be a prayer
[12:51] amen hallelujah
[12:52] even the 80s he prays
[12:55] amen
[12:57] amen even though he deny god but punch
[13:00] him in his stomach
[13:03] the first thing he's going to say oh god
[13:05] he's going to cry out to god amen
[13:08] hallelujah
[13:10] everybody prays in every culture
[13:16] now who they pray to is a different
[13:19] matter
[13:20] but we as christians
[13:23] we pray to the only true and living god
[13:27] and his name is the lord jesus christ
[13:30] amen hallelujah
[13:34] there is a natural desire
[13:37] in every human to pray
[13:41] in fact
[13:43] what that what makes you a human
[13:45] amen
[13:47] praise god
[13:49] animals
[13:50] can pray they don't pray
[13:53] humans pray
[13:55] because god created us in his image
[13:59] amen
[14:00] hallelujah so there in every
[14:04] heart human being there is a desire
[14:07] amen to reach out to this
[14:10] great
[14:11] supernatural being out there
[14:15] and our prophet put us puts it to us
[14:18] when the deep calls to the deep
[14:21] the deep cutter respond
[14:23] so there's got to be a god out there for
[14:26] us to go to
[14:27] to call out to amen and that god
[14:30] responds to us when we call out to him
[14:33] hallelujah
[14:34] blessed be his wonderful name
[14:38] sly trip
[14:41] amen
[14:43] the bible says
[14:45] in ecclesiastes 3 11
[14:48] it says god has planted
[14:51] eternity into the human heart
[14:54] amen that means you have an eternal soul
[14:59] amen
[15:00] you're gonna last longer
[15:03] amen hallelujah you're just gonna you're
[15:06] not gonna just be here for a little
[15:08] short period of time
[15:10] god is telling you there's an eternity
[15:13] ahead of each and every one of us
[15:16] amen who doesn't want to live
[15:19] amen
[15:20] the main reason why you take our next
[15:22] breath is the day you want to live
[15:25] so there is a deep desire into every
[15:28] human heart they want to live
[15:31] why you go to the doctor why you go to
[15:33] the hospital when something wrong with
[15:35] you
[15:36] you want to live
[15:38] so god's saying there's an eternity
[15:40] ahead of each and every one of us
[15:43] hallelujah
[15:44] praise god
[15:47] so it gives us a natural desire or drive
[15:50] amen
[15:52] to know that there is more
[15:55] than just this life
[15:58] amen hallelujah
[16:00] thank you lord jesus
[16:04] so there has to be a god
[16:07] god
[16:08] wired us to look for him
[16:11] amen
[16:12] hallelujah
[16:14] and god wire us to talk to him
[16:19] man
[16:21] so what we're teaching at tonight is a
[16:23] it's a little guide for you for how
[16:27] you can reach out to this creator
[16:30] to this god
[16:32] amen hallelujah
[16:35] and in the next 40 days amen
[16:38] myself and all the other brothers who's
[16:41] going to be
[16:42] continuing in this study amen by the end
[16:45] of it
[16:46] you're going to be a prayer warrior
[16:50] amen
[16:51] hallelujah we're going to do just the
[16:54] basic things amen hallelujah
[16:57] of how
[16:58] to reach out to god
[17:01] it's not difficult
[17:03] when you when you look back at it you're
[17:05] going to say you mean to say
[17:07] this is what it's all about
[17:10] amen hallelujah
[17:13] everyone prays at some point in their
[17:16] life amen
[17:19] hallelujah
[17:21] slight floor please
[17:23] the second thing that we will learn
[17:25] is that we're not very good at prayer
[17:30] amen and all of us know that
[17:34] we can do better
[17:36] amen
[17:38] in fact we feel inadequate
[17:41] about it
[17:42] i don't really know what to pray i don't
[17:46] know how to pray
[17:48] and i don't know how to say it
[17:52] amen i don't feel confident
[17:57] in fact many of us feel we are not
[18:00] confident about praying publicly
[18:04] if i call any one of you up here tonight
[18:06] to open us up and pray or pray
[18:09] you're going to cringe
[18:14] you know why because we don't feel that
[18:16] we we we sufficient we if we're good in
[18:19] self we don't have that that confidence
[18:22] inside of us amen
[18:24] to pray and pray good
[18:27] nice fluent words
[18:29] and all this kind of thing right so we
[18:31] feel that we inadequate amen
[18:34] hallelujah
[18:36] i couldn't do that i won't know what to
[18:39] say
[18:40] amen and feel insecure and inadequate
[18:43] about your prayer life
[18:45] you won't even pray in front of other
[18:48] people
[18:50] while you're having a meal
[18:52] you know
[18:54] hallelujah no god doesn't want you
[18:59] to feel that way
[19:01] for you to feel inadequate
[19:04] like your prayers are second class and
[19:06] they have no good
[19:08] at someone else's prey
[19:11] you're trying to compare yourself oh
[19:13] that person would real
[19:14] could be real good enough i can't really
[19:17] reach up to them stand at the pray
[19:19] amen
[19:20] but in all of this
[19:22] we will we will teach you amen
[19:26] and guide you amen
[19:29] how to pray
[19:31] and at the end of this series amen
[19:35] you will be different
[19:38] amen
[19:40] see
[19:41] we don't want to cheat we want to change
[19:43] one person at a time
[19:47] this is our motto in church in this in
[19:49] this ministry amen changing one person
[19:53] after a time and if it just just benefit
[19:55] one person i know it's going to benefit
[19:57] each and every single one of you
[20:01] those that are here listening and those
[20:04] that are out there hallelujah praise be
[20:07] to our god
[20:09] thank you lord jesus
[20:11] hallelujah
[20:13] the fact is i've never met anybody who
[20:17] taught that they were outstanding in
[20:19] prayer
[20:21] they have a
[20:22] master's degree in prayer
[20:25] amen
[20:26] all of us can do better in our prayer
[20:28] life
[20:29] each and every one of us
[20:31] amen
[20:32] hallelujah
[20:34] thank you lord
[20:36] we're not a professional
[20:38] in praying
[20:40] no matter how long you've been with the
[20:43] lord we know we can do better in our
[20:46] prayer life
[20:48] amen hallelujah
[20:52] and my two hands are raised up
[20:55] we all can do better in our prayer life
[20:58] amen
[20:59] hallelujah
[21:00] it's like five next slide please
[21:04] the greatest christian who ever lived
[21:07] next to jesus himself was saint paul
[21:11] and hear what saint paul said
[21:14] amen and if you take a look at the
[21:16] screen
[21:18] in romans 8 26 he said
[21:21] we don't even know
[21:23] what we should pray for no how
[21:27] we should pray man
[21:31] and that's in our bible
[21:34] have you ever read that
[21:35] it's right here in front of us tonight
[21:38] amen
[21:39] that guy who wrote half the new
[21:42] testament
[21:44] he's saying we don't even know what we
[21:46] should pray for and we don't even know
[21:49] how to pray
[21:51] so we're all in the school of prayer
[21:56] we all are learning
[21:59] amen hallelujah
[22:02] we all need to learn if paul said it's
[22:05] okay for you to admit i need to do
[22:09] better at this
[22:10] amen hallelujah
[22:12] i need to know how to talk to god
[22:17] amen
[22:18] i need to learn the language of prayer
[22:23] excuse me
[22:26] the disciples that jesus had hand picked
[22:29] to follow him for his entire ministry
[22:32] they did not know how to pray
[22:39] in fact they said slide 6
[22:42] please
[22:48] luke 11 1 says one day jesus was praying
[22:52] in a certain place
[22:54] when he had finished one of his
[22:56] disciples said to him lord
[22:59] teach us
[23:00] to pray
[23:02] amen
[23:06] that's an amazing thing they watched
[23:08] jesus pray and they said teach us to
[23:11] pray
[23:12] no
[23:13] he
[23:15] is the amazing thing no he has the
[23:17] amazing thing about this
[23:20] these 12 were privileged
[23:22] to watch jesus do everything he did
[23:26] while he was here on earth
[23:28] amen
[23:30] saw him do all kinds of miracles
[23:33] amen heal the people raise the dead turn
[23:37] water into wine
[23:39] walk on water do miracles cast out
[23:42] demons amen all kinds of amazing
[23:45] supernatural things
[23:47] and not once did they ever
[23:50] ask the lord
[23:52] teach us how to do miracles
[23:57] amen
[23:59] and then they heard jesus teach
[24:02] great sermon on the mount amen
[24:05] the greatest teacher in history the
[24:07] greatest preacher that was on the ever
[24:10] on this planet
[24:11] man
[24:13] the great masterpiece messages and
[24:15] stories that jesus told that have been
[24:19] studied for over 2000 years
[24:22] amen
[24:23] never once did the disciples say lord
[24:26] teach us how to teach
[24:30] amen
[24:32] instead they said
[24:34] teach us how to
[24:36] pray
[24:38] amen hallelujah
[24:41] so isn't that the key to everything
[24:45] prayer
[24:48] miracles and all these signs and wonders
[24:51] and all these
[24:53] things amen that's coming forth the
[24:56] greatest thing that god has ever read it
[24:58] as we were opening
[25:00] the greatest weapon that god could have
[25:03] given you
[25:04] to fight against our arch enemy was
[25:07] spread
[25:09] amen
[25:11] so we need to learn how to pray
[25:16] amen hallelujah
[25:19] thank you lord
[25:21] you see
[25:23] why
[25:24] because
[25:26] watching the master
[25:27] they knew that all the power behind his
[25:30] miracles and teaching and his preaching
[25:33] was through
[25:35] prayer
[25:36] amen
[25:37] jesus prayed
[25:39] constantly
[25:41] he talked to god the father in the
[25:43] morning
[25:45] the afternoon the evening
[25:48] he set aside himself
[25:50] many times we have read
[25:52] amen
[25:53] and he went and prayed and so behind his
[25:57] power was
[25:59] pray
[26:01] amen
[26:02] and behind every successful
[26:05] powerful christian
[26:08] is prayer
[26:10] amen
[26:11] each and every single one of us need to
[26:14] have a prayer life
[26:17] or a life of
[26:19] prayer
[26:21] amen hallelujah i like that the sinking
[26:24] tonight amen
[26:25] hallelujah
[26:27] thank you lord jesus
[26:33] but as they looked at him
[26:35] they realized that all of the power and
[26:39] all the blessing that came in his life
[26:42] came through
[26:43] a connection with god himself
[26:49] amen
[26:51] so all
[26:52] your success
[26:55] all your power
[26:57] amen you need to be connected to the
[26:59] creator
[27:02] man
[27:02] you need to have a direct connection to
[27:05] him
[27:06] amen a direct line to glory
[27:10] amen that you could call on jesus
[27:13] anytime
[27:15] in any situation
[27:17] in any
[27:18] circumstance and he is more than willing
[27:21] to answer you
[27:22] he's never too busy
[27:24] never
[27:26] amen
[27:27] amen hallelujah
[27:29] praise god
[27:32] praise god
[27:34] so if paul says we don't know what to
[27:36] pray
[27:38] or what to pray or how to pray and the
[27:40] disciples said teach us to pray it's
[27:43] okay for us to feel a little
[27:46] inadequate amen
[27:49] hallelujah
[27:52] god doesn't want you to feel lousy
[27:55] about your prayer life
[27:57] or feel discouraged
[28:00] or you can't pray i don't know what to
[28:02] say
[28:03] i don't know how to say it
[28:05] it's like the little boy
[28:07] right
[28:09] right
[28:10] he recited the whole alphabet
[28:12] because he said he didn't know how to
[28:14] pray
[28:15] you say god you take it and you form
[28:17] words you know my heart what i have need
[28:19] of
[28:20] amen
[28:22] you take you take the alphabet lord and
[28:24] you form words
[28:26] amen and you know what i need
[28:29] amen hallelujah
[28:30] the abcs of christianity
[28:34] amen
[28:35] hallelujah is just believe
[28:38] thank you lord jesus amen
[28:42] hallelujah a third thing slides next
[28:46] slide please
[28:52] our frustration with prayer
[28:55] are caused by our
[28:57] misconception about prayer
[29:01] amen
[29:05] our frustrations about prayer i just
[29:07] don't feel satisfied with it
[29:12] are caused by our
[29:14] misconception about prayer
[29:16] and there is a lot of misconception out
[29:20] there
[29:21] amen
[29:22] there's a lot of phony baloney ideas
[29:28] there are a lot of lies

[33:47] come from
[33:49] amen i only learned that
[33:52] today
[33:54] amen
[33:55] it's actually a perversion of the latin
[33:59] in the catholic mass
[34:04] when the priest holds up the bread and
[34:06] say
[34:07] hawk es copas neon
[34:11] i don't know if i pronouncing it correct
[34:12] but it sounds more like hocus pocus
[34:17] that's what happened to a guy that was
[34:19] sitting in the congregation
[34:21] and he couldn't hear very well
[34:23] and he said
[34:24] amen he's saying this is the body of
[34:27] christ in latin that's where hoka spoke
[34:30] has come from some joker in the row

[34:35] so he said hocus pocus i'm turning this
[34:38] bread into jesus

[34:45] said well i'm turning this cat i just
[34:47] dog into a cat now
[34:51] amen so you see the way that tone come
[34:53] from
[34:55] my my mind
[34:57] prayer is not some ritual words
[35:00] that you see and all of a sudden things
[35:03] change mysteriously or magically
[35:07] amen
[35:08] you see prayer
[35:10] is communion with god himself
[35:15] and you've got to have a relationship
[35:18] with him
[35:19] to know who you're speaking to
[35:22] and amen hallelujah
[35:25] and that way you can speak to him amen

[35:37] the person amen really well you know how
[35:39] to speak to them
[35:41] amen hallelujah praise god
[35:44] another myth is that prayer is not a
[35:46] fire extinguisher next slide please
[35:50] mean
[35:52] this is like hanging on the wall and
[35:55] there's a sign that says
[35:57] break glass only in case of emergency
[36:03] yeah a lot of people treat prayer like
[36:07] that
[36:09] it's only when they reach
[36:11] an emergency situation in their life
[36:14] amen they're reaching out to pray
[36:17] all the prayers for men are
[36:20] just quickly sending a prayer request
[36:22] you'll never hear from them know
[36:24] anything but only in our
[36:28] emergency situation
[36:30] god is not a spirit iron
[36:34] amen
[36:35] and the pastor and the deacons and the
[36:38] brothers and sisters around you they are
[36:40] not the paramedics
[36:42] amen
[36:44] that only when you reach in a dire
[36:46] situation you're going to call on them
[36:48] you we need to have a constant prayer
[36:51] life
[36:52] lord said he said pray
[36:54] always
[36:56] in the good times pray
[36:59] not only when the bad time is rich
[37:02] is like money in the bank

[37:08] there's no bones you're gonna get bonks
[37:10] check
[37:11] you're gonna draw on something that's
[37:13] not there it's gonna bounce back to you

[37:18] some prayer life prayer oil

[38:16] praying constantly
[38:18] you mean hallelujah
[38:20] hallelujah
[38:22] and you only use it in emergencies in
[38:25] fact the terminology is often all we can
[38:29] do now is pray
[38:33] you mean to say
[38:35] you come to your last end the last
[38:38] resort is to pray
[38:41] when that is supposed to be the first
[38:43] choice
[38:46] in your life
[38:49] when you're buying the house
[38:52] you're buying the new car
[38:55] amen
[38:56] when you're going on your first
[38:58] date or you're going for your first
[38:59] interview in your job

[39:10] putting a request lord

[39:29] when the very first
[39:31] line of defense is spread

[39:38] single heart
[39:40] here and oh yeah amen praise god
[39:43] thank you lord jesus blessed be his
[39:45] wonderful name
[39:47] another misconception is prayer
[39:51] is not a tough war
[39:56] is not a talk of word with god the fact
[39:59] he made god
[40:02] a lot of people think that god doesn't
[40:04] really want to answer their prayer
[40:06] he doesn't even want to listen
[40:09] and that you kind of have to wear go
[40:12] down until he finally gives him
[40:15] amen

[41:46] before tiger next slide please
[41:49] pray is not a ritual to relieve guilt
[41:55] prayer is not a ritual
[41:58] to relieve guilt some of you grew up
[42:00] with this where you were taught if you
[42:03] sin
[42:05] and if it's a really big sin
[42:08] you have to go to say a certain number
[42:11] of prayers
[42:16] there you go
[42:19] that's not in the bible my friends
[42:21] my brothers and sisters
[42:23] the lord never teaches us that and you
[42:26] could never find that anywhere in this
[42:27] scripture
[42:29] that's man-made doctrine and ideas
[42:32] amen hallelujah
[42:35] it's traditional
[42:38] jesus taught us the opposite
[42:41] amen
[42:44] prayer is not punishment for your sin
[42:48] god paid the sacrifice once and for all
[42:51] you got to accept that sacrifice
[42:54] amen that he made on behalf of you you
[42:57] could never pay repay that
[43:00] never
[43:01] amen
[43:02] because the
[43:04] the wages of sin is
[43:06] death
[43:07] you did we all of us deserve to die
[43:10] god made the ultimate sacrifice to each
[43:14] and every one of us
[43:16] freely he gave his life for you and me
[43:18] amen so it's not upon his prayers not a
[43:21] punishment for sin hallelujah amen
[43:25] prayer is not penance for your sin
[43:27] prayer is a privilege
[43:30] amen
[43:32] hallelujah
[43:34] not a duty
[43:36] it is a joy
[43:38] not some responsibility
[43:40] you've got to pay back because you did
[43:43] something wrong
[43:46] that puts prayer in a whole wrong light
[43:49] it is not a ritual to relieve guilt amen
[43:54] hallelujah
[43:56] in fact jesus repeatedly said
[43:59] don't pray

[44:24] over and over again
[44:26] vain repetition
[44:28] do not use meaningless represent
[44:31] repetition thinking that you will be
[44:33] heard for many words
