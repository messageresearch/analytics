[19:36] if you got it let's read it together
[19:38] father how thankful we are
[19:42] for thy word
[19:43] we're so thankful to be in the house of
[19:45] god
[19:46] and to have your word the promise of
[19:49] this age
[19:51] brought to us by a certified
[19:54] prophet of god for the generation
[19:57] lord god we prayed now as we come
[20:00] this word which laid for thousands of
[20:04] years upon these pages
[20:07] may these words come to life quickened
[20:10] by the moisture of the holy spirit
[20:13] that we might all partake with joy
[20:16] father for we come together lord to
[20:18] worship thee and to acknowledge your
[20:21] unseen presence with us and among us
[20:25] that you may be glorified father lord i
[20:28] would say the same thing
[20:30] if i was in here alone just praying and
[20:34] talking to you
[20:35] so
[20:36] lord we pray in jesus name
[20:40] that the great holy spirit father that

[20:54] be so thankful for what you have given
[20:56] to us lord for this we ask in jesus name
[21:00] amen and amen praise god god bless you
[21:05] i'm so thankful for this message and
[21:08] especially when i have an opportunity to
[21:10] compare it with something else
[21:12] which i i had you know just uh yesterday
[21:17] and oh my it's just so different and i'm
[21:20] so thankful to god
[21:22] that he brought me in praise the lord
[21:26] into his word and his promise for this
[21:29] day revelation 2
[21:32] 14
[21:35] but i have a few things against thee
[21:38] because thou hast there them that hold
[21:42] the doctrine of balaam
[21:45] who taught balak to cast a stumbling
[21:48] block
[21:49] before the children of israel
[21:52] to eat things sacrificed onto idols
[21:57] and
[21:58] to commit fornication
[22:01] so as thou them
[22:04] so has thou
[22:05] also them
[22:07] that hold the doctrine of the
[22:10] nickelodeons
[22:11] which thing
[22:13] i hate
[22:15] verse 20
[22:16] notwithstanding
[22:18] i have a few things against thee
[22:21] because thou hast thou sufferest that
[22:25] woman jezebel
[22:27] which
[22:28] call it herself a prophetess
[22:31] to teach
[22:33] and to seduce my servants to commit
[22:37] fornication
[22:38] and to eat things
[22:40] sacrificed
[22:42] unto
[22:43] idols praise god
[22:45] the topic tonight is
[22:48] the doctrines of
[22:50] balaam and of jezebel right for god
[22:54] bless you please be seated and let us
[22:58] put our hearts place our hearts inside
[23:01] of this word of god
[23:04] of course you know out of numbers
[23:06] 22 how the story of balaam
[23:11] how that um
[23:13] balak
[23:14] who was
[23:16] the king you see israel had just
[23:18] conquered
[23:19] um
[23:21] uh and uh
[23:23] the king
[23:24] of baitian
[23:26] it conquered them
[23:28] and he knew that his nation his lands
[23:32] were
[23:33] next in line
[23:35] so he
[23:37] was waiting for that attack
[23:40] but he realized how that
[23:43] israel had driven these other nations
[23:45] that were bigger and greater than his
[23:48] and taken over their territory so he
[23:52] knew that he couldn't withstand them
[23:55] with just with his army alone
[23:58] so
[23:59] uh he didn't go to other kings around to
[24:02] ask their help you see he sought for
[24:05] spiritual help
[24:08] which he already sought and knew in his
[24:11] mind is greater than having all the
[24:14] armies that you can go in the
[24:16] neighborhood and and pay or whatever to
[24:19] come
[24:20] but instead of paying armies
[24:24] mercenaries to come and fight for him
[24:28] he told his servants take the price or
[24:31] the reward you will find the word
[24:33] rewards of divination
[24:37] to
[24:38] balaam
[24:40] and
[24:42] ask him to come down and see me and talk
[24:45] with me
[24:46] to have a conversation
[24:49] and
[24:50] they brought the money
[24:53] and gifts to balaam once you know
[24:56] you ask god shall i go up god says no
[24:59] you know they come back with more they
[25:01] raise the stakes you know he i go back
[25:04] to god and says
[25:06] god should i really not go that says no
[25:09] don't go
[25:10] and
[25:12] the king says uh to his servants you can
[25:15] read that scripture you know
[25:17] you can give him houses of gold in other
[25:20] words pilot as much as he wants and as
[25:23] long as he comes down to see me to have
[25:26] these discussions of what to do
[25:28] to stop these people who are covering
[25:31] the land and taking it over and balaam
[25:34] went back to god
[25:36] and says god
[25:39] shall i go up
[25:41] and see uh balak and talk with him
[25:45] and god says yes go
[25:48] go
[25:49] and
[25:50] as i was reading this i noticed
[25:53] something the bible says and balaam then
[25:57] decide then then
[25:59] gotten this donkey to go up
[26:02] and the scripture says but the lord was
[26:05] angry with him
[26:07] after he had just told him
[26:09] you can go up
[26:11] but the bible says the lord was angry
[26:13] with him
[26:15] amen why because he wasn't going into
[26:18] the will of god
[26:19] he was going in the permissive will of
[26:22] god
[26:23] right god permitted him to go but that
[26:25] was only his permissive will
[26:28] so there's a lesson there to be learned
[26:31] his desire of his heart was for the
[26:33] money
[26:34] what's for the wealth what's for the
[26:36] fame was for the name
[26:39] was for the association with great king
[26:42] and so
[26:43] he
[26:45] overruled god's word with the desire of
[26:48] his heart
[26:50] and we got to be watchful that we don't
[26:53] do the same thing
[26:55] you see pentecost made the same mistake
[26:59] the desire their heart was more the
[27:01] towns more than to have the real holy
[27:04] spirit that would be correcting them
[27:07] and it's proven because a prophet has
[27:09] come with the genuine holy spirit the
[27:12] power of god
[27:14] the the gifts of the spirit that they're
[27:16] talking about he was manifesting
[27:18] miles above them are everywhere i read
[27:22] somewhere where they said what these
[27:24] evangelists would uh have uh two three
[27:28] or ten this man would have thousands of
[27:31] miracles in one night some of them not
[27:35] right in front of him he doesn't have to
[27:36] be there right praise god people coming
[27:40] off trains to the meeting they're healed
[27:43] people
[27:44] come to the hotel before they could go
[27:47] out the heel they delivered praise god
[27:50] uh supernatural god was moving in that
[27:54] way praise the lord listen when we come
[27:56] to church like this you've got to
[27:58] realize whether there is a thousand ten
[28:01] or five of us hallelujah there's a
[28:05] person here who who we are serving and
[28:07] we're worshiping you're not seeing him
[28:10] but he is here the living god
[28:14] amen we talking about the pillar of fire
[28:16] pillar fire until it becomes like an
[28:18] imagination and just a talking but let
[28:20] me tell you my god is real
[28:23] i said he's real
[28:25] praise god not only because i read it in
[28:28] the bible seeing the picture on the over
[28:30] the prophet's head but as a young man
[28:33] i've literally seen it amen and watch it
[28:37] go up into the heavens oh praise god let
[28:41] me tell you we're not walking following
[28:43] something that's imagination we're not
[28:46] following something that's a fantasy or
[28:48] some religious illusion we are believing
[28:52] and following something that will lead
[28:55] us from art to glory
[28:57] or from the grave to glory if you will
[29:00] believe this promise of this word of god
[29:02] hallelujah i'm getting a little excited
[29:04] here oh praise god hallelujah
[29:08] but you see
[29:10] this king was having problems with his
[29:12] kingdom
[29:14] and
[29:15] balaam's help
[29:17] was just a maneuver for expediency
[29:21] to help him out to retain or maintain
[29:24] his power
[29:27] and so
[29:28] you know
[29:30] there balaam went up
[29:32] and gave advice
[29:35] that that you know
[29:37] upset
[29:39] the israel and their way of life
[29:42] and worship over
[29:44] and it was such a simple advice he gave
[29:47] to them
[29:49] why don't we just go over
[29:52] and talk
[29:53] with balak
[29:56] you know when you talk with somebody you
[29:58] sit down
[29:59] uh you know you have a nice meal and
[30:02] over that meal you have a conversation
[30:05] and you talk somewhere you can come to
[30:08] an understanding
[30:10] that's human understanding but you can
[30:12] come to an understanding
[30:15] and the relationship
[30:18] will not be so acrimonious it would be
[30:21] bad it will it will actually get better
[30:25] amen praise god hallelujah praise god
[30:28] and that's where ah he encouraged them
[30:31] to iron out their differences
[30:34] and to get over it and then you'll
[30:36] understand one another praise god and
[30:40] once you do that then you can accomplish
[30:43] things great things together by working
[30:47] together you can accomplish great things
[30:51] and then the next step was to seduce
[30:54] them into worshipping
[30:57] get into worship along with balak
[31:01] and so
[31:03] the same thing happened with the church
[31:05] in the new testament
[31:07] exactly the same thing
[31:10] but this time it wasn't balak of the old
[31:14] testament
[31:15] it was constant time
[31:19] of rome
[31:21] in our
[31:22] times
[31:24] that had the same problem
[31:27] he was having problems with his empire
[31:30] the roman empire
[31:32] and his stand was a bit shaky
[31:36] so he needs some propping up he needed
[31:39] some help
[31:40] something that will invigorate and
[31:43] inspire his people like that amen
[31:47] so
[31:49] not to sing in his empire
[31:51] outside of the vision of the cross and
[31:53] all of that he had that but the fact is
[31:56] he noticed that the christians were
[32:00] growing in number
[32:03] growing greatly in number so any
[32:06] politician you know that they deal with
[32:08] numbers
[32:09] and when you see those numbers well if i
[32:11] get these numbers on my side and i get
[32:14] this other coalition on my side and i
[32:17] get that together two and two makes four
[32:19] and then i would win
[32:21] right i would remain emperor so he
[32:24] decided that he was going to court the
[32:27] the the
[32:28] christians
[32:30] right well he approached the nominal
[32:33] christians
[32:35] and
[32:36] there it was
[32:39] to secure his kingdom
[32:41] he had a great talk with them
[32:44] and
[32:46] invited them to all come
[32:49] and that was what we know as
[32:53] the nicean council of 325 a.d that was
[32:57] the invitation and that was a purpose
[33:00] that was his scheme that he had in his
[33:03] mind we are talking about it now
[33:05] but back then
[33:07] uh you know the christians couldn't see
[33:10] that we are now talking about it but
[33:12] this was his scheme
[33:14] showing that the same spirit that was
[33:16] there with me luck and balaam is the
[33:18] same spirit that came back and was with
[33:20] him using him in the same manner to let
[33:23] them come together so as you can see
[33:27] here
[33:28] uh my brothers
[33:30] that all the christians came up to the
[33:32] meeting bought the true vine and the
[33:35] false vine
[33:36] because nobody knew what was going to
[33:38] come out of it
[33:40] but as the meeting went on
[33:43] the
[33:44] true believers uh begin to pull out
[33:47] uh they start staying away from it they
[33:50] just
[33:51] move out from the meetings
[33:53] they didn't want to have anything to do
[33:55] with it because after the
[33:57] argumentation with
[33:59] athanasius and the other
[34:03] fellow that was there
[34:05] representing
[34:06] the false vine
[34:08] for hours debating and talking about the
[34:11] word of god they realized that this was
[34:14] just like to them a waste of time and
[34:17] and plus they
[34:18] they were being attacked
[34:20] also secretly before they even got to
[34:22] the meeting by the false vine
[34:25] and so it was a dangerous situation to
[34:29] be in right
[34:31] so my brothers um
[34:34] the ones that
[34:36] remained in the meeting
[34:39] he offered them
[34:41] monies from the state treasuries
[34:45] the state will provide funds for you to
[34:48] build uh churches that's how cathedrals
[34:52] start being built right with the state
[34:55] money that he started give giving out
[35:00] to them and along with
[35:03] the uh monies from the treasury uh you
[35:07] will have recognition with me personally
[35:11] politically
[35:12] oh my those
[35:15] men were so proud and you will also have
[35:19] the power of my entire army behind you
[35:25] anything to do with the church so he
[35:28] gave them political power
[35:30] he gave them
[35:32] backing with military power he gave them
[35:35] backing with money or financial power
[35:40] and therefore
[35:42] the nominal church
[35:44] grew
[35:46] and
[35:47] he began to introduce
[35:50] through this nominal church now
[35:54] which we will go back over that how all
[35:57] those old roman
[36:00] rituals and things they have which were
[36:03] actually the religion the babylonian
[36:06] religion that had come that far which we
[36:09] taught on before
[36:11] but then they switched everything over
[36:13] they start switching the names and
[36:15] switching the
[36:16] everything over the other way no
[36:20] so
[36:22] he allowed the church now
[36:25] to begin to introduce to the people
[36:28] all these
[36:30] babylonian teachings
[36:32] which
[36:33] to cook
[36:34] here
[36:36] he introduced the people to idol worship
[36:41] and spiritism
[36:44] for statues with the names of saints
[36:48] dead saints
[36:51] placed in the buildings
[36:54] and the people were taught by the
[36:56] priests to commune
[36:59] that way with the dead
[37:03] right
[37:04] not realizing that there were actually
[37:07] committing what the bible says called
[37:10] necromancy
[37:13] they were committing
[37:15] spiritual
[37:17] necromancy praying to the dead
[37:20] like some nations some people pray to
[37:22] their ancestors
[37:24] right
[37:25] but here they were actually praying to
[37:28] so-called saints
[37:30] people maybe some were true some were
[37:33] not that lived holy lives and they
[37:35] respected them and loved them and and
[37:38] and they began to tell them that these
[37:40] people can help them even though they're
[37:42] dead
[37:43] and so
[37:44] they introduced them to spiritism you
[37:48] see
[37:49] just the pause here really uh just as in
[37:52] africa you got all the masks and things
[37:55] it's this it's the vision that the which
[37:58] doctor saw of that spirit that spoke to
[38:02] him that he actually gets them to carve
[38:05] out the face of the thing and then the
[38:07] person takes it and they don't know
[38:09] there's a spirit back of that
[38:12] there's a life that is back of that
[38:14] right and that is why
[38:16] when they're dancing around it doesn't
[38:18] mean not just africa all over the world
[38:20] it is a similar thing the influence is
[38:22] the same that that witch doctor or
[38:26] priest will put on the mask when he is
[38:28] going to dance or he's going to commit
[38:30] something because it is calling that
[38:33] spirit to come on him that he saw in his
[38:37] visions right like that okay and so
[38:43] they
[38:44] taught the people to pray to the saints
[38:47] which is nothing less than spiritism
[38:50] and you know
[38:51] the bible tells us
[38:53] the food we need
[38:55] is the word of god
[38:58] the word of god is our spiritual food
[39:01] praise god hallelujah but they
[39:05] uh
[39:06] they changed the diet
[39:09] and that the diet was changed to
[39:12] litanies and rituals and creeds that
[39:16] they started to come forth with all
[39:20] these great bishops and great men begin
[39:23] to produce their own writings and place
[39:26] them there and they start to slowly
[39:30] insert or insinuate
[39:32] those words
[39:34] in the common belief
[39:36] so that they can seduce the minds of the
[39:41] people away from the written word of god
[39:46] hallelujah yes that was their their
[39:50] dogmas and their creeds
[39:52] and saw
[39:54] one god then they slowly introduce
[39:58] three
[39:59] gods that are one
[40:01] so we're not
[40:03] saying nothing against you having one
[40:05] god but really the one god is three
[40:08] persons
[40:09] and they slip that in
[40:12] on the people
[40:14] amen like that right so here it goes
[40:18] they
[40:19] bring brought in that
[40:21] compound name they call it uh you know
[40:25] father son holy ghost
[40:27] and then my friends
[40:30] water
[40:31] baptism the genuine one gave way
[40:35] once they changed that one god to three
[40:38] then now they got so-called three names
[40:42] and they that's the way they introduced
[40:45] them to pagan warship
[40:48] right
[40:50] of venus zeus right
[40:53] astarte they they introduced them
[40:57] like that
[40:58] a gentle slow coming slip over
[41:03] right to that kind of worship
[41:07] but not the real believers
[41:10] they move out to that meeting they
[41:12] wouldn't go
[41:14] they wouldn't have anything to do with
[41:15] it and those that went came out of there
[41:19] and they had lost much of the truth
[41:21] roots of god's word already
[41:25] and from that time
[41:27] they began to
[41:30] lose
[41:31] uh the clear understanding
[41:34] of the one god and of the godhead
[41:37] now what i was just talking about you
[41:39] can see that that shows how satan was
[41:42] looking to dilute and to create chaos
[41:45] and confusion in what the people were
[41:47] believing
[41:48] because he throughout so many
[41:50] propagandas and unbelief and stuff like
[41:53] that now and we see the power of
[41:55] propaganda and lies what it's doing in
[41:57] the world right now so you understand me
[42:00] what i'm trying to tell you because the
[42:02] same principles they're using tell a lie
[42:05] over and over and over again and and get
[42:08] the people to believe that lie and all
[42:10] of a sudden to them that lie becomes the
[42:12] truth
[42:14] you see oh my
[42:17] there it goes my friends
[42:20] so now
[42:21] we find out
[42:23] let's consider this doctrine of balaam
[42:27] and his
[42:28] deliberate uh maneuver
[42:32] to
[42:34] influence the people
[42:36] to change
[42:38] the way
[42:39] their way of faith
[42:41] and from faith to unbelief
[42:45] i quote brother branham
[42:47] the nicolaitan doctrine you see
[42:50] was the corruption of the clergy
[42:55] and by the corruption of the clergy
[42:58] as they sought political power
[43:02] among
[43:03] themselves
[43:04] they were corrupted
[43:06] because they were looking for that among
[43:09] themselves one want to be higher than
[43:11] the other one wants to be in a bigger
[43:12] position
[43:14] of that nature right so
[43:16] see my
[43:18] you see but balaamism now
[43:21] nicoletian's ism corruption of the
[43:24] clergy balaamism is corruption and
[43:28] subjection of the people
[43:31] to their system
[43:34] of creeds
[43:36] their way of worship
[43:38] and by that
[43:41] they
[43:43] wanted to desire to hold them
[43:47] right
[43:48] so
[43:49] they wanted to bind the people
[43:53] with unseen chains of the mind
[43:58] so
[43:59] they brought it in that way oh the
[44:02] church looks so nice and nice stained
[44:04] glass windows beautiful doors brass gold
[44:07] everywhere and carpets everything but
[44:09] it's a prison house
[44:12] prophet said house of hell give way to
[44:15] the name of jesus christ
[44:17] her gates are the gates of hell oh my
[44:22] yes brothers hallelujah my
[44:25] god hallelujah
[44:27] so
[44:28] what bound the people in the church the
[44:30] constant drumming of the litanies the
[44:32] creeds the the whether it was latin or
[44:35] whatever they were singing and speaking
[44:37] they kept drumming it away from them
[44:39] since their children until they get old
[44:42] and it bound their minds
[44:44] it bound their hearts
[44:47] right like that see and that's what
[44:50] bound the people prophet asked it here
[44:53] what was it that bound the people to
[44:54] that nominal church what is this that
[44:57] destroyed them it was their creeds
[45:01] it was their dogmas
[45:04] and their dogmas were formed into
[45:08] tenants
[45:09] and those tenants are now the doctrine
[45:13] of the roman catholic church
[45:17] they were not given given they were not
[45:21] giving the people true food the word
[45:24] no sir
[45:25] they were giving them
[45:27] food offered to idols amen
[45:31] see there were giving them babylonian
[45:35] paganism wrapped up
[45:38] in christian terminology
[45:41] amen
[45:42] see
[45:43] that very spirit and doctrine
[45:46] is right now here amongst all the
[45:49] protestants here today
[45:52] and we call the name of that spirit
[45:56] denomination
[45:58] i usually say demon nations but uh
[46:01] you know it's not far from what is being
[46:04] sent forth here praise god hallelujah
[46:07] remember
[46:09] nicolasianism
[46:10] is organization
[46:14] humanizing the leadership of the church
[46:19] and by doing that
[46:21] they depose
[46:23] the holy spirit
[46:25] you put up a pope and you bring down the
[46:26] holy spirit you put up some other great
[46:30] name and you bring down the holy spirit
[46:32] for the prophet says the moment you
[46:34] humanize the leadership and you put that
[46:36] up he says you depose the holy spirit
[46:40] out of his position right
[46:42] bala mission now
[46:44] is not just organization it is
[46:47] denominationalism
[46:50] amen praise god because you got
[46:53] organization and business
[46:56] that's a principle all right that's
[46:58] there but
[47:00] denomination
[47:01] that's a real spiritual grip on a
[47:04] person's mind and a heart that they're
[47:07] out for right
[47:09] which takes the church
[47:11] instead of the bible
[47:14] is that the truth in other words he's
[47:16] trying to say they believe the church
[47:18] more than they believe the bible you go
[47:21] right now when you tell people some of
[47:22] the words here they'll tell you what my
[47:24] church says
[47:26] is that right that is a way of telling
[47:28] you that take the word of the church
[47:31] above the bible
[47:33] in their minds the church has more
[47:34] credibility
[47:36] than the bible does they'll even argue
[47:39] with you and say oh there's mistakes in
[47:40] the bible man wrote the bible and
[47:43] whatever else but the church says the
[47:45] church says
[47:46] his holiness so-called self and so on
[47:49] like that and they will try to dismiss
[47:52] the word of god
[47:54] hallelujah
[47:55] oh my think of it right the hour uh you
[48:00] see and right at this very hour now our
[48:04] day now brother brandon is speaking of
[48:06] many of god's people
[48:09] are still caught in the snare of the
[48:13] nominationalism
[48:15] and god is crying to them come out
[48:19] hallelujah of her my people
[48:22] lest you be partakers of our sins
[48:25] and that you receive not her place amen
[48:29] you see
[48:30] a lot of the people are in there and he
[48:32] says it here because they are ignorant
[48:35] they were not aware
[48:38] but sadly he continues on and i'm just
[48:41] speaking what he's saying here he says
[48:44] no plea of ignorance
[48:47] it's gonna make carry any effect or
[48:49] leniency
[48:51] in god's appeal court
[48:53] you can't go saying you were ignorant
[48:56] you had the bible even if they wouldn't
[48:58] tell you read your bible
[49:02] amen hallelujah praise god amen
[49:06] my my parents weren't church goers they
[49:08] were just reading the bible and the
[49:10] bible will speak to you
[49:13] it will reveal itself to you if you have
[49:15] a sincere heart and you are one of god's
[49:17] own he'll make himself known to you
[49:21] the word will begin to unfold hallelujah
[49:24] and you'll be seeing god hide in his
[49:27] word blessed be the name of the lord
[49:30] amen so
[49:32] we see
[49:34] nicoletanism clergy balaamism
[49:37] organization
[49:38] hallelujah i want you to understand
[49:42] i am not against the people
[49:46] what i am against he says
[49:49] is against that system
[49:52] and that's what we are against is the
[49:54] system
[49:56] and
[49:57] not against the people
[49:59] they're good people there's a lot of
[50:01] nice people wonderful people just don't
[50:03] let that seduce you to believe what like
[50:05] they believe that's all the difference
[50:07] is but you're against the system
[50:11] that is controlling them
[50:13] praise god behind the scenes hallelujah
[50:18] see
[50:18] with that kind of a state
[50:21] and church union the devil already had
[50:23] that principle way back is showing in
[50:25] the dark ages so when they do it now
[50:28] it's nothing new they're doing you can
[50:30] see it coming from on hundreds of years
[50:32] ago that is coming right
[50:36] it's been set for the dark ages
[50:39] and for a thousand years the church went
[50:42] into the depths of darkness
[50:45] knowing the depths of satan
[50:48] and when any
[50:50] religious
[50:52] believing people
[50:54] would
[50:57] embrace
[50:59] both nicholatism
[51:01] and balaamism
[51:03] and then are awkward
[51:06] political financial
[51:09] and physical power you see the same
[51:12] kind of atmosphere begins to come back
[51:15] again
[51:16] because all the elements of the cake
[51:19] you know are mixed together correctly
[51:22] right so once that happens again
[51:26] uh then you see
[51:28] the next direction is only one they can
[51:32] go
[51:33] and the next direction
[51:36] is in the direction of the doctrine of
[51:39] jezebel
[51:42] nickelodeonism balaamism and jezebel
[51:46] right history doctrines actually here at
[51:49] the outlying
[51:50] review actually an outline identifying
[51:53] back to us
[51:54] right these three doctrines are
[51:56] dangerous triple spirits back of these
[51:59] doctrines
[52:01] bringing a trinity of satan bringing the
[52:03] church into the depths of satan right
[52:06] here right remember
[52:09] this woman jesse bell
[52:11] was a sidonian
[52:14] she wasn't a jew
[52:16] daughter of
[52:17] abbay al
[52:18] king priest astante
[52:21] and he was a murderer
[52:25] see the woman married ahab king of
[52:28] israel
[52:29] for political purposes
[52:32] right
[52:33] then
[52:34] she took over the religion of the people
[52:38] and began to murder
[52:40] the preachers the levites
[52:44] and erected her own temples wherein
[52:49] she caused the people to worship venus
[52:54] who is astarte
[52:55] and baal the prophet here has who's the
[52:58] sun god
[53:00] and that's why you see the sun burst is
[53:02] always there people don't know it but
[53:04] you go and you see it always in the
[53:06] churches there like that that's what it
[53:09] really is
[53:10] okay of course if you said that even
[53:13] though one of their people standing
[53:14] right there they'll turn and say oh oh
[53:17] no come on don't become superstitious
[53:19] and all like that but really back of it
[53:22] all is the worship of baal
[53:26] right they're worshiping the devil and
[53:29] they don't know it
[53:31] amen they're being the temple of god as
[53:34] the bible tells us and thinking they're
[53:36] worshiping god and they're really
[53:37] worshipping the devil amen now notice
[53:42] what this jezebel spirit did
[53:45] what is her teaching what what does she
[53:48] do
[53:49] she first of all
[53:51] taught the priests
[53:56] her own teachings of what she said
[54:00] brother brandon puts it this way she
[54:03] formulated her own teachings
[54:06] and made the her priests her priests
[54:10] which means she's the one that made them
[54:12] priests they owing her
[54:14] their credibility their loyalty is to
[54:16] her and she made her priests teach
[54:21] her teaching
[54:23] and they in turn
[54:26] made or influenced the people to accept
[54:29] it
[54:30] now this is it this is what's going on
[54:33] even today
[54:34] right this is going on today got that
[54:37] same spirit is here oh praise god see oh
[54:41] my there you see is exactly what the
[54:44] nominal church was in the dark ages
[54:48] that's what's come back now
[54:50] they left the word of god entirely
[54:55] see
[54:56] for
[54:57] names and titles of the godhead
[55:00] rather than the real one name they
[55:03] exchange it for uh the word that what
[55:07] came to me when i was you know going
[55:09] that day was empty names
[55:11] right empty names right father
[55:16] son holy ghost empty names demons don't
[55:19] even respect that they won't even listen
[55:21] to that brother branham said when he was
[55:23] going to cast out the devil he said let
[55:25] me see and he says in the name of the
[55:28] father and the son of the holy ghost
[55:29] come out of him the devil laughed the
[55:31] devil wouldn't move right he says in the
[55:34] name of jesus christ
[55:36] out he goes amen power in the name of
[55:39] jesus hallelujah the others like that
[55:42] empty names oh and they're not even
[55:45] names titles they call them names right
[55:48] now remember
[55:51] see
[55:52] that
[55:53] left the word of god
[55:55] except for
[55:57] titles
[55:58] and a few
[56:00] scriptural principles
[56:02] they twisted
[56:05] what they did
[56:08] and took things out of the bible
[56:12] by changing
[56:14] its meaning
[56:15] amen
[56:16] see
[56:17] the college of bishops wrote vast
[56:20] treaties
[56:22] and their popes wrote
[56:24] you know we know some of the words
[56:26] encyclials
[56:28] and bulls they wrote them
[56:31] and they cleared themselves to be
[56:33] infallible now the infallible
[56:37] who's involved is god invaluable anymore
[56:40] but
[56:41] or
[56:41] anyway
[56:43] and began to claim
[56:45] that they
[56:47] were receiving revelation from god
[56:51] and they are
[56:52] speaking for god to the people
[56:56] all this was taught to the priests
[57:00] and brought fear made by fear made the
[57:04] people the believer that god was the one
[57:06] talking and saw the people were scared
[57:10] and
[57:10] fearful i don't know about you but since
[57:13] a child when i was going to the catholic
[57:16] saint aloysius
[57:18] boy school
[57:20] and going to attend the services
[57:24] i would go into the cathedral and i i i
[57:27] would feel so fearful and the things
[57:29] that i would smell and sense but i
[57:32] didn't know what it was then but my my
[57:35] mind such fear would be upon you because
[57:38] what it was nothing but a horse of hell
[57:42] nothing but legions of demons that were
[57:45] all around clouds of darkness were
[57:47] everywhere brother sister oh my think
[57:51] about it see this is what no
[57:55] watch
[57:57] here there were
[57:59] my friends
[58:01] that no extermination has become much
[58:05] worse than death
[58:07] in the minds
[58:09] of the people
[58:10] amen
[58:12] and the voice of the church he says here
[58:15] took over
[58:17] rather than the voice of god
[58:19] the voice you see he's going back now
[58:22] because spiritually
[58:24] that's what happened with jezebel
[58:26] and ahab
[58:27] after a while
[58:29] the soldiers the politicians they
[58:31] respected
[58:32] the words of jezebel and the commands of
[58:34] jezebel and they listen to her more than
[58:37] they listen to the king they have
[58:40] after a while the king had to go to her
[58:43] and saying i want that lion she said you
[58:45] call yourself a king and a man and you
[58:47] can't take the land from the boat
[58:49] let me get it for you and you know the
[58:51] rest of the story right that took place
[58:55] right there and then hallelujah but
[58:58] thank god
[59:00] he was god was faithful to his little
[59:03] flock in spite of what rome
[59:07] did to their bodies
[59:09] martyred killed murdered
[59:12] thousands millions of them
[59:16] but god will never forsake his own
[59:20] god will always be with his people
[59:24] oh praise god hallelujah i'm so thankful
[59:28] that we as they are surrounded by those
[59:31] devils and demons and clouds of darkness
[59:34] we are surrounded by the angels of light
[59:37] we are surrounded by the holy ghost
[59:40] amen we are surrounded by the anointing
[59:43] of the holy spirit praise god with us in
[59:46] us over us all through us hallelujah and
[59:49] i'm thankful of god for that amen
[59:52] oh blessed assurance jesus is mine oh
[59:56] what a foretaste of glory divine
[59:59] heirs of salvation oh my god purchased
[1:00:04] by god hallelujah himself oh glory to
[1:00:08] god amen oh
[1:00:10] the god was faithful to his little flock
[1:00:14] in spite of what rome
[1:00:17] might
[1:00:18] do have done to their bodies
[1:00:21] but rome could not kill that spirit that
[1:00:25] was living within them praise god
[1:00:27] hallelujah and rome can't do it with you
[1:00:31] or with me or anyone else that has the
[1:00:34] holy spirit within their lives
[1:00:37] hallelujah in the light of truth shun
[1:00:42] threw them back by the holy ghost
[1:00:45] and the power of god
[1:00:47] amen
[1:00:48] think of it
[1:00:50] deeds
[1:00:51] and doctrines of the nicolasians
[1:00:55] doctrine
[1:00:56] of balaam
[1:00:58] then the doctrine of the false
[1:01:00] prophetess
[1:01:01] jezebel
[1:01:03] these do not constitute three
[1:01:07] spirits
[1:01:08] or make
[1:01:10] spirit three spiritual principles
[1:01:14] these are
[1:01:16] three manifestations of the same spirit
[1:01:20] going from depth to depth taking them
[1:01:24] deeper and deeper into darkness and mire
[1:01:28] and death
[1:01:30] it is the antichrist spirit of
[1:01:33] organization
[1:01:35] in its
[1:01:36] three in its various stages
[1:01:39] and once the clergy separated themselves
[1:01:43] organized themselves and began to
[1:01:46] oppress
[1:01:47] the people by leading them into the
[1:01:51] organization
[1:01:52] binding them to
[1:01:54] the organization
[1:01:56] see
[1:01:57] the organization of course was based on
[1:02:00] queens
[1:02:02] based on
[1:02:03] dogmas
[1:02:04] and they taught the people that instead
[1:02:08] of the pure word of god hallelujah
[1:02:11] brother sister we are blessed
[1:02:14] i am thankful to god you know i sat and
[1:02:17] i was sitting there thinking
[1:02:20] the prophet left spoken word books
[1:02:23] some people may take them and throw them
[1:02:24] in the garbage
[1:02:26] believe some believers will take them
[1:02:27] leave them on the shelf
[1:02:29] the prophet is gone
[1:02:31] now the message moved to another realm
[1:02:33] some people may not even be reading
[1:02:34] their books anymore and i mean listen to
[1:02:37] the tapes anymore praise god while
[1:02:39] others who've really seen the light that
[1:02:42] thing has so gripped their heart they
[1:02:44] can't even they can't even stop reading
[1:02:47] it they can't stop seeing god they can't
[1:02:49] stop seeing him wherever they go
[1:02:51] whatever they look whatever they hear
[1:02:53] they're seeing god everywhere
[1:02:55] hallelujah and that's what happens when
[1:02:58] the word of god really gets a hold of
[1:03:00] you your body getting old what does that
[1:03:02] mean that would mean a thing the inward
[1:03:04] man is being renewed day by day paul
[1:03:07] said
[1:03:08] hallelujah praise god amen i'm so glad
[1:03:13] i'm so thankful praise god because in
[1:03:15] any case like paul said so if we drop
[1:03:18] this or what if this body in my body
[1:03:20] outward body be dissolved we have
[1:03:22] another one waiting praise god amen
[1:03:25] accent from the body present with the
[1:03:28] lord lord of god hallelujah amen oh my
[1:03:33] my my praise god hallelujah how
[1:03:36] wonderful to know that he is the same
[1:03:38] yesterday today and forever hallelujah
[1:03:43] so instead of the pure word of god they
[1:03:46] taught the people creeds and dogmas
[1:03:50] and rituals
[1:03:53] and ceremonies
[1:03:55] you know rituals and ceremonies can
[1:03:57] become habitual
[1:03:59] and habits can bind you you know that if
[1:04:03] you have a bad habit
[1:04:04] you don't know it's go it can't bind you
[1:04:06] oh i can stop smoking whenever i want oh
[1:04:09] i can stop using these drugs and then
[1:04:11] when they try to stop then they realize
[1:04:14] that the hobbit has bound them
[1:04:17] well it's that same thing they're doing
[1:04:20] with the ritual the creeds and the
[1:04:22] darkness but by this just saying it with
[1:04:25] religious terminologies over the pulpits
[1:04:27] and talking like that the people who
[1:04:29] think it's they're blessed they're being
[1:04:31] blessed they're not realizing they're
[1:04:32] being cursed they're they don't
[1:04:34] realizing what they're happening they're
[1:04:36] being imprisoned their minds are being
[1:04:38] imprisoned with bands not of steel but
[1:04:41] of demonic power spiritism they're being
[1:04:44] bound in every possible way amen see
[1:04:48] because what now that whole system
[1:04:52] right
[1:04:53] and their ceremonies their way of
[1:04:56] worship the whole system
[1:05:00] was a militant
[1:05:01] and diabolical power
[1:05:04] and it does its best to control all
[1:05:07] around it through persuasion
[1:05:10] of discourse
[1:05:13] the simple oh he's just talking he's
[1:05:15] just having a discourse
[1:05:17] but that is planting seeds in the hearts
[1:05:20] and the minds of those who are hearing
[1:05:23] it amen now of course
[1:05:26] you watch the word militant the prophet
[1:05:28] used there you understand where he's
[1:05:30] going back to he's going right back to
[1:05:31] nimrod
[1:05:32] because nimrod is the one that started
[1:05:34] to organize
[1:05:36] people into groups
[1:05:38] and armies
[1:05:40] with the intention
[1:05:42] of taking over other
[1:05:44] nations
[1:05:46] right not one of these churches out
[1:05:48] there not happy if the other one break
[1:05:50] up and then and they take them over
[1:05:53] every one of them they're gonna say oh
[1:05:55] oh we're not but they're happy so that
[1:05:59] they can conquer another nation
[1:06:02] or denomination right oh my there it is
[1:06:06] now
[1:06:08] it was antichrist then
[1:06:11] and it is antichrist now
[1:06:15] absolutely
[1:06:17] see
[1:06:18] he came in christ's name
[1:06:21] prophet said i put the word he operated
[1:06:25] in christ's name right they're operating
[1:06:27] under the guise that they're christian
[1:06:30] and this is christ and the work of
[1:06:33] christ praise god i'm going to wind this
[1:06:35] up just now okay praise the lord
[1:06:38] hallelujah praise god now it seems my
[1:06:41] friends
[1:06:43] by no stretch of the imagination could
[1:06:46] god be in such teachings
[1:06:49] of the roman catholic
[1:06:52] church
[1:06:52] and i'm quoting here directly from the
[1:06:55] church ages
[1:06:56] he says no way
[1:06:58] for
[1:06:59] the
[1:07:00] by their teachings and by their conduct
[1:07:05] god
[1:07:06] could not in any way possible
[1:07:12] could not place anything in their
[1:07:15] teaching in color
[1:07:17] these protests
[1:07:19] were disregarded
[1:07:20] and they died from failure to arouse
[1:07:24] anybody's attention this is doing the
[1:07:26] same thing today
[1:07:28] oh so many people die in the school over
[1:07:30] there so many of this happened over
[1:07:33] there this happened over there and it's
[1:07:35] just like water's falling from a duck's
[1:07:36] back
[1:07:38] thousands of years hundreds of years
[1:07:40] have passed and nobody is doing anything
[1:07:45] or it seems like they can't do anything
[1:07:48] whatsoever like that right
[1:07:51] oh my see but then thank god
[1:07:56] god in his sovereign grace
[1:07:59] when it seems like all was lost
[1:08:01] sent a messenger by the name of martin
[1:08:05] luther
[1:08:06] and started the reformation
[1:08:09] and it worked on the climate of the
[1:08:11] catholic church
[1:08:12] because the catholic church he said she
[1:08:16] started getting full of herself and of
[1:08:18] our power
[1:08:20] that he says
[1:08:21] [Music]
[1:08:23] the church
[1:08:24] had been given so much rope
[1:08:27] that she was about to hung herself with
[1:08:31] it
[1:08:32] they had so much freedom so much money
[1:08:34] so much power so much liberty right and
[1:08:38] it was in that climate and atmosphere
[1:08:41] that luther preached justification by
[1:08:44] faith
[1:08:45] amen the true vine for the first time in
[1:08:48] many centuries
[1:08:51] began to grow again in bountiful manner
[1:08:56] as the nominal church had used state
[1:08:58] power to back themselves up
[1:09:01] the very state that was for them
[1:09:04] began to go against them
[1:09:07] oh my
[1:09:09] and this is where martin luther
[1:09:12] at that time began to gain power and
[1:09:15] then he made his mistake
[1:09:19] listen to it
[1:09:21] two minutes and i'll be finished here
[1:09:25] see
[1:09:26] his mistake was
[1:09:29] that
[1:09:31] him
[1:09:32] and the believers that were with him
[1:09:34] they accepted state subsidy
[1:09:39] just like the
[1:09:40] false buying was getting money to build
[1:09:42] churches
[1:09:44] now that they
[1:09:46] uh
[1:09:47] constantine turn against them
[1:09:50] he just take the money that was going to
[1:09:52] the one side and put it on the other
[1:09:54] side
[1:09:55] right
[1:09:56] and they did not refuse it and look to
[1:09:59] god but they accepted the thinking it's
[1:10:02] a blessing
[1:10:03] it was not a blessing
[1:10:05] it was a curse
[1:10:07] to the church
[1:10:08] at that time
[1:10:10] and so they allowed the state to
[1:10:12] subsidize them
[1:10:14] and so you see this age did not
[1:10:18] launch out too far or too deep into the
[1:10:21] word
[1:10:23] right that they had but thank god that
[1:10:26] it even went as far as it did under
[1:10:29] those
[1:10:30] that claim it
[1:10:32] and conditions right because it leaned
[1:10:36] on political power
[1:10:39] by accepting those subsidies
[1:10:42] it leaned on political power rather than
[1:10:44] leaning on the arm of god
[1:10:47] right praise god hallelujah see and
[1:10:51] looters the very group that in luther's
[1:10:54] generation that had broken from the
[1:10:56] false vine now began to slowly turn
[1:11:01] right back
[1:11:03] to become
[1:11:04] daughters of the harlot
[1:11:07] for she went right
[1:11:09] into nicolithianism
[1:11:12] balaamism
[1:11:14] and
[1:11:15] jezebel religion
[1:11:17] and that is what we see here today
[1:11:20] hallelujah though they had many factions
[1:11:23] fighting among themselves for precedence
[1:11:26] and power
[1:11:27] amen
[1:11:28] but how far were they from
[1:11:32] the true seed of god
[1:11:34] far away from the true seed of god
[1:11:38] they persecuted each other even under
[1:11:41] death in many cases in the name of god
[1:11:45] hallelujah but thanks be to god and this
[1:11:48] is the last scent i have here
[1:11:50] that there were still a few names
[1:11:52] amongst them
[1:11:54] even
[1:11:55] also
[1:11:56] as we have
[1:11:58] in every age
[1:12:00] and might i say
[1:12:03] a few names left
[1:12:05] in our age amen hallelujah
[1:12:08] fear not little flock
[1:12:10] it is my father's pleasure to give you a
[1:12:13] king the kingdom may the lord bless you
[1:12:16] on this talk
[1:12:18] of the doctrines
[1:12:20] of
[1:12:21] balaam
[1:12:22] and jezebel may the lord bless you i
[1:12:25] hope that
[1:12:26] this is
[1:12:27] opening up
[1:12:28] your understanding
[1:12:31] because you heard
[1:12:33] much of these things before
[1:12:36] like the disciples heard much of what
[1:12:38] jesus said before
[1:12:40] but on the way
[1:12:42] back to their home amen wrote them yes
[1:12:47] he went back over the things he had told
[1:12:50] them
[1:12:50] and said don't you know this is what it
[1:12:52] meant that's what this meant this and
[1:12:54] advisor says he explained open the
[1:12:56] scriptures on to them
[1:12:58] and then hopefully then openly up their
[1:13:00] understanding praise god and what
