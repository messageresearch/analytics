[1:54] thou taketh knowledge of him
[1:57] or the son of man that thou makeest
[1:59] account of him
[2:01] man is like to vanity these days are as
[2:05] a shadow that passeth away
[2:08] about thy Heavens O Lord and come down
[2:11] touch the mountains and they shall smoke
[2:14] cars forth lightning and scatter them
[2:18] shoot out thine arrows and Destroy them

[28:37] we serve a wonderful and great and
[28:40] awesome God
[28:42] I don't know how many of you usually
[28:44] join our prayer meeting
[28:47] last week
[28:48] Friday not this Friday I entered a
[28:53] petition for my brother
[28:56] he was in a dire situation where he
[29:00] basically lost his job though he's
[29:02] contracted if there's no need for
[29:04] products to move production then he
[29:07] doesn't have work he is separated from
[29:10] his family and he has a court order that
[29:13] the judge has said you have children you
[29:15] need to maintain them
[29:17] and so unable to provide
[29:21] an issued warrant for his arrest due to
[29:25] non-payment
[29:27] my mother left an apartment
[29:30] and so him not being able to pay for the
[29:32] apartment that he was living in
[29:35] he asked those who were living in my
[29:37] mother's apartment you know this is a
[29:39] situation
[29:40] um I need the apartment
[29:44] they left the apartment and when they
[29:46] did
[29:47] they took the electrical wires off they
[29:51] broke the plumbing they took the doors
[29:53] and the window so he was left with a
[29:56] concrete wall which they hammered a
[29:58] couple of places then ran a hose from
[30:01] the outside to the window and flooded
[30:03] the apartment
[30:04] so no food no job no work no maintenance
[30:10] nothing it's a really really bad
[30:12] situation for anyone to be in but our
[30:16] Lord is all always mindful because you
[30:18] see when you go for a job and you have a
[30:21] certain skill set it's not asking you
[30:23] just to have recommendation provide your
[30:27] proof of licenses now they're asking you
[30:29] for a police check if you go for a
[30:31] police check and you have a record
[30:33] you're not going to get hired so this is
[30:35] what the Lord did
[30:37] he had an interview at a hardware
[30:40] he went in and he was grateful that they
[30:44] took him in for the day and he praised
[30:46] and he was so thankful but that was a
[30:48] day to test his skills because anybody
[30:51] can say I can do this just to get a job
[30:54] so
[30:55] the owner said I'll take some time and I
[30:58] will get back to you on Tuesday he
[31:01] received a phone call
[31:03] the owner called him and said I would
[31:05] like to offer you a full-time job six
[31:08] days a week praise the Lord so he got a
[31:12] job
[31:13] then the Lord moved in a financial way
[31:16] and paid off
[31:18] his outstanding payments
[31:20] so the warrant was now reversed
[31:23] amazing God and it continues my sister
[31:28] found an electrician he went in to see
[31:31] what they were looking at you know he
[31:33] simply asked well what's the situation
[31:35] what's going on
[31:36] and as my brother explained the
[31:40] electrician was moved with sympathy and
[31:43] compassion and love so he simply gave
[31:47] him a list of all the materials he would
[31:50] need and he said I will do it for free
[31:53] now that is the power of a living God
[31:58] thank the Lord hallelujah hallelujah
[32:01] hallelujah
[32:02] [Applause]
[32:03] Praise You Lord Jesus thank you Jesus
[32:11] God will never reject your prayer

[45:33] communion you know it's communion that
[45:36] we're here for today don't you
[45:38] uh because real communion is not just
[45:41] the bread and the wine the prophet said
[45:44] the real communion is
[45:47] um a group of people sitting and talking
[45:50] and chatting with each other and eating
[45:52] and drinking isn't that right well
[45:55] that's what we're going to do here we're
[45:57] going to eat and drink from the word of
[46:00] God
[46:01] is that right we will take in of the
[46:03] Holy Spirit and we Elite of the bread of
[46:06] life and we'll talk to each other
[46:09] wishing that preaching is not a school
[46:11] room
[46:12] you understand it's it's me preaching
[46:16] and talking to you and you talking back
[46:18] to me
[46:19] and that's what real preaching is but
[46:21] the system has got the people in a state
[46:25] where they believe that uh preaching or
[46:27] teaching is like a school room and that
[46:30] you're supposed to sit piously quietly
[46:32] and listen right while the preacher
[46:36] speaks but that is not the case uh we
[46:40] are here and we ought to talk with each
[46:42] other and talk with him
[46:44] amen sometimes you won't pay me
[46:47] attention you take your attention over
[46:48] and say praise the Lord
[46:50] is that right now that's okay but God
[46:53] that's what we're here for praise God
[46:55] God bless every one of you here today
[46:58] and you pray for me while I'm preaching
[47:00] the word is that right because we are
[47:03] here in spiritual communication that God
[47:06] might bless us together unveil himself
[47:09] open up the word open our hearts to
[47:12] receive the word and to see the word of
[47:15] God Amen praise the Lord God bless you
[47:19] richly hallelujah praise the Lord uh
[47:23] where uh if I can ask her now for my
[47:27] text to be uh placed up on the screen
[47:31] then that will be a blessing I have it
[47:35] here uh printed out John 15 16.
[47:40] and my subject is
[47:43] I chose you
[47:46] uh it just so happened on Wednesday
[47:50] night I was praying
[47:52] and what I was praying about is that uh
[47:56] brother Christopher doesn't break into
[47:58] my message
[48:02] because he just went across you know the
[48:06] ice and I just said well praise the Lord
[48:09] amen but praise God may the Lord bless
[48:13] us as we look into the word of God here
[48:16] today I chose you
[48:20] you have not chosen me
[48:23] but I have chosen you
[48:27] and ordained you
[48:30] amen praise God that you should go
[48:35] and bring forth fruit
[48:38] and that your fruit would remain
[48:42] that whatsoever you shall ask of the
[48:46] father in my name
[48:48] he may give it to you
[48:51] Heavenly Father we thank you for the
[48:53] reading of Thy word now we ask for the
[48:57] unveiling of the word and we ask father
[49:00] for the quickening of the Holy Spirit to
[49:04] come upon the word of God and praise God
[49:08] may you Lord anoint the Tabernacle and
[49:12] that you uh will receive the glory
[49:15] Praise Your Name May the Holy Spirit
[49:18] bless us now in Jesus name the Lord
[49:22] bless you praise the Lord hallelujah
[49:26] it's good to see my good friend brother
[49:28] Glenn here always a faithful praise God
[49:33] hallelujah you can be seated please
[49:38] amen
[49:40] amen praise the Lord hallelujah
[49:44] now
[49:45] um we know of course that God is good
[49:48] Hallelujah he's the same yesterday today
[49:52] and forever amen now we know God is
[49:56] light is that right
[49:58] and in him there is no Darkness at all
[50:01] no darkness no he's just light he's just
[50:05] wisdom understanding you can carry that
[50:07] out but God is light and he was in the
[50:12] beginning you know that
[50:15] um he was known or we know him now that
[50:18] he was Elohim in Isaiah in many of the
[50:22] prophets we read of him saying I am the
[50:27] only one there is none beside me amen he
[50:32] was the only one Elohim there now we
[50:37] know that name Elohim is really plural
[50:39] so when he says about himself being
[50:42] there alone as one being but uh out of
[50:48] him or in him was the sons of Light and
[50:52] Daughters of light praise the Lord and
[50:55] this great uh great Pillar of Fire this
[50:58] great God Almighty out of that
[51:02] out of himself because if he's gonna get
[51:05] something else he can't get it from
[51:08] anywhere it is nothing else it's just
[51:10] him
[51:11] so
[51:12] um these sons and dusters of light came
[51:15] off from him
[51:16] and that's signified by the the tongues
[51:21] and book of Acts chapter 2 but he the
[51:24] great Pillar of Fire just broke pieces
[51:27] off from himself so we are not made of
[51:30] any other material our original material
[51:34] is God himself and we're not from the
[51:36] ground we're from him praise the Lord
[51:39] the ground produced the dust the dust
[51:42] that produced their bodies where we come
[51:45] from we are of the Earth the physical
[51:46] bodies of the Earth but really the
[51:50] spirit men and women that were ordained
[51:55] as he said or chosen were are the ones
[51:58] that he elected to come out from himself
[52:02] and to come down here with a specific
[52:04] purpose that they might glorify him and
[52:07] produce fruit and you you study the
[52:10] scriptures you see the rest of it that
[52:12] they will produce him that he may
[52:14] receive all the glory and all the praise
[52:16] and and all the honor amen praise God so
[52:21] uh to produce those Sons he had to
[52:23] produce them by a spoken word so he said
[52:26] let there be light
[52:29] so when he said let there be light from
[52:34] himself went out light
[52:36] and the light naturally of course you
[52:40] know sun moon the stars that's not what
[52:42] I'm talking about here I'm talking about
[52:45] the sons of Light that came out from the
[52:47] presence of God the greater light to
[52:50] rule the night and the Lesser ones to
[52:53] rule in whichever age they come to be in
[52:55] now we see these sons and others which
[52:59] we will call the Lesser lights or one
[53:03] songwriter call them the lore lights
[53:05] they they came down that they might do
[53:09] the will and the plan and purpose of God
[53:11] Amen praise this wonderful name he's
[53:14] wonderful isn't he praise the Lord and
[53:17] so we come from I wanted you to know we
[53:21] come from an eternal source
[53:24] right we come from an eternal so it's
[53:28] not an but the Eternal Source who is God
[53:32] himself we come from him right now we
[53:36] know Paul was expressing this which I
[53:39] never understood fully clearly but Paul
[53:42] said he he that Sanctified
[53:46] under one that is Sanctified is of the
[53:51] same
[53:52] source is that right looking in your
[53:55] scriptures you're going to find it where
[53:57] Paul said that but you see all these
[53:59] things we used to just pass over them
[54:01] think it just means a cleansing healing
[54:04] you know and stuff like that which is
[54:06] true it does mean that too but they uh
[54:09] higher understanding and revelation of
[54:12] the word he that sanctifies
[54:15] Sanctified and the one that is
[54:18] Sanctified is of the same Source you
[54:22] come from the same place you're one amen
[54:25] you're one with him because you're from
[54:28] him praise the name of the Living God so
[54:32] when God said let there be light you see
[54:37] his spoken word allowed the thoughts the
[54:41] things the germs the genes that were in
[54:44] him to now go out to be expressed
[54:48] and uh all they have to do is live on
[54:52] the earth and while they're living on
[54:53] the earth their lives are the light of
[54:57] this world
[54:58] none of the Skies none of the heavens
[55:00] but their lives become the light of this
[55:04] world
[55:05] praise the Lord in other words the Stars
[55:08] don't have to work of themselves the
[55:09] moon doesn't have to work up and oh boy
[55:12] I better shine up or else I'm not going
[55:14] to shine bright tomorrow or or the next
[55:17] day no it just does lives just it's just
[55:21] there and while it is there is a force
[55:24] God the opportunity to flow through them
[55:27] to manifest his power and his presence
[55:30] through his sons and his daughters all
[55:33] glory to God isn't it wonderful to know
[55:35] we are children of the most high
[55:38] that we are Sons and Daughters of the
[55:40] almighty praise God let's sing that
[55:43] wonderful chorus that we all know so
[55:46] well will walk in the light will walk in
[55:51] the light
[55:53] such a beauty full light
[55:57] will walk where the Dew drops of mercies
[56:02] are bright
[56:05] shine all around us but day in by night
[56:12] oh it is Jesus he is the light of the
[56:18] world Amen praise God future home uh
[56:24] listen I want you to know friends that
[56:28] first of all I'm gonna
[56:31] lose some quotation from this book I'm
[56:33] not going to stop all the time to tell
[56:35] you oh it's from here it's from there
[56:38] but if if I gave them the quotes on the
[56:41] back and if it's timely you you may see
[56:43] it up there be able to uh read it amen
[56:47] now we know in the beginning what's the
[56:51] word
[56:52] right now remember you spoke the word
[56:54] and the word
[56:56] um let there be light I should go
[56:58] backwards now if you said let there be
[57:00] light
[57:01] and there was light Let There Be seeds
[57:05] on the earth and the plants whatever
[57:07] whether he call you a seed he call you
[57:10] light he call you whatever it's it's you
[57:12] right it's how he puts us down here for
[57:17] his Divine Purpose praise the Lord and
[57:20] for his glory that's the reason why we
[57:23] are here but it goes on and speaking of
[57:26] Jesus but you must understand when the
[57:30] word speaks of Jesus it's speaking of
[57:33] you and I we as sons and those of God
[57:36] because we were in him
[57:39] we were not yet separated from him we
[57:44] were in him so when it speaks about him
[57:47] is talking back to us right you
[57:50] understand in the beginning John 1 1 was
[57:54] the word
[57:56] and the Word was made flesh
[57:59] is that right praise the Lord so just as
[58:03] he came from him and then he was made
[58:04] flesh that he might go out on the
[58:06] ministry to a mission to carry out what
[58:09] God had in his mind so we come from God
[58:13] and a spirit man and then he ordained a
[58:18] certain mother father and and and then
[58:20] your body was formed that you might come
[58:23] into expression and manifestation on the
[58:26] face of the Earth to fulfill his Divine
[58:29] Purpose that the word of God might be
[58:31] spread abroad the light might shine
[58:34] across the Earth for his glory amen
[58:37] praise the name of the Lord so the word
[58:40] was red flesh
[58:41] the original great attribute was made
[58:45] flesh in that attribute were attributes
[58:49] uh Sons Daughters of God genes of God
[58:53] Amen praise the Lord will come later to
[58:56] see that these genes in him were all his
[58:59] wife
[59:00] so in him was all of that amen now
[59:06] quoting now now remember that the the
[59:11] was in the beginning was the word the
[59:14] word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[59:18] praise God are you glad you're here
[59:21] praise
[59:22] Hallelujah now the three stages of it
[59:27] it was an attribute first
[59:31] uh and as an attribute
[59:35] that was God
[59:38] that attribute was God hallelujah amen
[59:42] because God is the great attribute and
[59:45] we were in him part of him just like
[59:47] your hand your foot is a part of you but
[59:49] you don't call that God you don't call
[59:52] that yeah just you that's not you that's
[59:55] just part of you but the whole thing is
[59:59] God
[1:00:00] amen and so what the attribute itself is
[1:00:04] the person that the the hand is the hand
[1:00:07] of that person it's the foot of that
[1:00:08] person and so we are attributes of God
[1:00:11] we are genes of God praise the name of
[1:00:15] the Lord hallelujah amen now praise God
[1:00:19] that he thought of of
[1:00:21] who thought of himself then as being
[1:00:26] human or becoming human amen and so once
[1:00:33] he thought that that transmitted him him
[1:00:37] down
[1:00:39] it's him transmitted down to become
[1:00:43] Jesus to be Jesus amen and then you see
[1:00:48] the word goes on it's God
[1:00:51] transmission to Jesus right yeah praise
[1:00:55] the Lord I'm not going through the whole
[1:00:57] process transmission
[1:01:01] Jesus and Jesus to who you the elected
[1:01:06] seed of God
[1:01:08] the elected now that body had to grow
[1:01:11] and be built but it wasn't built like uh
[1:01:14] nine months it was built through the
[1:01:16] church ages
[1:01:18] it was built through the church ages
[1:01:21] praise the name of the Lord now if
[1:01:24] you'll ever be here
[1:01:27] amen if you will ever be here now
[1:01:31] Prophet speaking to the elected seed but
[1:01:34] he's talking generally and leaving his
[1:01:36] statements for the whole world to hear
[1:01:38] but the elect will recognize what and
[1:01:41] who he's talking to is that right he
[1:01:44] says if you will ever be here where is
[1:01:48] he talking about where was he that he's
[1:01:50] talking about that he was right in the
[1:01:52] same building but you see an
[1:01:54] understanding you understand now what he
[1:01:57] was talking about he said if you will
[1:01:59] ever be here
[1:02:01] you was with him then
[1:02:05] amen you was with him then for there's
[1:02:09] only one form of eternal life and that
[1:02:15] is God
[1:02:16] Hallelujah so it's just like ABC if you
[1:02:19] want to come intellectually two and two
[1:02:22] makes four one eternal
[1:02:25] and now you're going to say you're born
[1:02:28] again and you just got eternal life
[1:02:30] where you got it from you see in the
[1:02:33] first place you can't have it's not a
[1:02:36] whole bunch of Eternal lives it's one
[1:02:40] eternal life and that eternal life
[1:02:42] expressing himself through human beings
[1:02:48] amen who he elected to carry his life in
[1:02:52] him in them praise God and that's how
[1:02:55] they are Eternal they did not one day on
[1:02:59] a date become Eternal by repenting of
[1:03:02] their sins at the altar though we are
[1:03:04] supposed to repent but we repent because
[1:03:07] of the things done in the flesh
[1:03:10] is that right that is but then he turns
[1:03:14] around and says son daughter
[1:03:16] you couldn't help that
[1:03:18] you're trapped you were trapped in there
[1:03:21] and while you're trapped in there then
[1:03:24] you're moving by the nature of that you
[1:03:28] see but I I I'm not looking that because
[1:03:31] I know the devil is using that to wave
[1:03:33] before my eyes so that I could condemn
[1:03:35] you or condemn this or condemn that but
[1:03:38] I am not looking at that I'm looking at
[1:03:40] what I put in there
[1:03:43] I I'm looking at the gene I'm looking at
[1:03:46] the germ amen all these things are just
[1:03:50] him manipulating events circumstances
[1:03:52] conditions to make you look bad to make
[1:03:56] you look so evil or wrong and he thinks
[1:04:00] that that's going to stir me up to bring
[1:04:03] judgment or or or or take you out of the
[1:04:07] book which I can't because you're part
[1:04:10] of me
[1:04:12] you know so so the devil is is so
[1:04:16] foolish with his attributes and his
[1:04:18] actions that he's carrying on with that
[1:04:21] he's blinded by his own Pride that he
[1:04:26] can't see that he is absolutely a
[1:04:29] creature and a creation and that he's a
[1:04:33] loser and he can never win he can't he's
[1:04:37] a loser amen oh my praise God you see
[1:04:41] you have to be there with him because
[1:04:45] there's only one form of of eternal life
[1:04:49] that's God and you have to be a part of
[1:04:53] God at the beginning
[1:04:56] and so not what you just choose down
[1:05:00] here
[1:05:03] but he chose you
[1:05:06] Hallelujah and that's what I'm talking
[1:05:09] about here today he chose you
[1:05:13] you are in him
[1:05:15] now there's other parts of him that are
[1:05:18] doing other things in this world and
[1:05:20] through the centuries and ages there's
[1:05:24] other parts of him that he elected to do
[1:05:27] all the things that is not our concern
[1:05:28] like he told Elijah you know say what
[1:05:32] about this one no the disciples what
[1:05:35] about the other one he says none of your
[1:05:37] business what is it to you whether I let
[1:05:39] him go or let him stay or whatever you
[1:05:42] just do what you're supposed to do you
[1:05:44] are in this age living this age would
[1:05:46] you worrying about Martin Luther and
[1:05:48] this one and that one you read about
[1:05:50] them but this is not their time this is
[1:05:52] your time
[1:05:54] you're in this hour under the
[1:05:57] inspiration of the mighty Angel The
[1:05:59] Covenant Angel glory to God hallelujah
[1:06:02] amen so it's not that us a brother like
[1:06:07] I said touched a little bit on it on
[1:06:09] Wednesday night it's not that you chose
[1:06:12] him down here and and chose him and by
[1:06:16] that choosing you suddenly got eternal
[1:06:19] life no God is all knowing god god is
[1:06:23] omniscient and omnipotent he knows all
[1:06:27] those who would have loved him before he
[1:06:30] even started anything
[1:06:32] he knows amen and so he already knows
[1:06:38] who will be here and who will choose him
[1:06:40] and who will not choose him he knows
[1:06:43] that but the whole thing has to play out
[1:06:46] is that right praise God uh like for
[1:06:51] instance you may know this person here
[1:06:53] is going to try to steal my car this
[1:06:57] person here is going to put their hand
[1:07:00] in my pocket to pick pocket what I have
[1:07:03] in my pocket and you may know it but you
[1:07:06] don't have any any place for judgment or
[1:07:10] Justice until you let them do it and
[1:07:14] then catch them in the act and then you
[1:07:16] have a claim for judgment is that right
[1:07:20] praise God so God has the and for
[1:07:23] salvation the same way reverse right now
[1:07:26] he has to let the whole drama play out
[1:07:29] amen so that he he can comfort with
[1:07:34] Justice
[1:07:36] judgment
[1:07:38] salvation so he can come out with it and
[1:07:43] literally like the prophet said he will
[1:07:45] hardly even have to judge you he said
[1:07:47] you literally judge yourself because
[1:07:50] when that plays out on the great screen
[1:07:52] of Ages before you and you see yourself
[1:07:55] and everything you have done he says you
[1:07:57] think the things we're doing here just
[1:07:59] go on pass away like that he says no
[1:08:02] just like you have a tape recorder God
[1:08:04] have all the graphics all the pictures
[1:08:07] all the technical everything will replay
[1:08:11] and you can't fool around and say oh no
[1:08:14] I didn't do that oh no I wasn't here no
[1:08:16] I wasn't no it's all in front of you
[1:08:19] that's you everything is there praise
[1:08:21] God but we are forgiven
[1:08:24] from that if we are True Believers not
[1:08:27] make Believers not trying to con God you
[1:08:30] mean you're so evil like the devil that
[1:08:32] you're gonna try to pull a con game on
[1:08:35] God who knows everything you can't do it
[1:08:37] amen praise God hallelujah amen praise
[1:08:42] God Amen oh praise God it was this is
[1:08:47] all of him
[1:08:49] and all of him is all of us
[1:08:52] is that right he made us uh uh praise
[1:08:56] the Lord and this is just these little
[1:08:58] things looks like nothing to you but
[1:09:00] what he said said there that is why you
[1:09:04] man
[1:09:06] you colored man man with colors
[1:09:11] put them down here as you men and women
[1:09:16] praise the Lord that he can manifest and
[1:09:20] live through them like flowers in a
[1:09:23] field just put them in different colors
[1:09:25] they're out there each one accent the
[1:09:27] other one each one and no one color it
[1:09:31] has its beauty but put together they all
[1:09:34] produce a riot of colors that's a
[1:09:37] blessing to the entire world it's the
[1:09:39] same thing he did praise God hallelujah
[1:09:42] and thank God Jesus said you haven't
[1:09:43] chosen me
[1:09:45] I have chosen you
[1:09:47] you think you chose me and time
[1:09:51] when I'm the self-existent one right but
[1:09:55] I chose you thanks be to God I give God
[1:09:59] the glory go con now future continue in
[1:10:02] the future home now
[1:10:05] the Methodist said
[1:10:07] when you shout you got it
[1:10:11] but a lot of them shouted and they
[1:10:13] didn't have it uh brother is there any
[1:10:16] way
[1:10:17] um maybe the next time we'll try to get
[1:10:19] larger not just for me but larger fonts
[1:10:23] so that the people can read it properly
[1:10:27] even if you have to scroll it a little
[1:10:30] more yeah
[1:10:32] it's much bigger behind oh good I'm
[1:10:35] sorry Brothers
[1:10:38] sorry praise the name of the Lord
[1:10:41] um I'm not reading from there either
[1:10:43] because I have it here but when I looked
[1:10:46] there then I thought about you and said
[1:10:48] well now if it's that small how are they
[1:10:50] going to read it sir that's why I raise
[1:10:52] that up now when you shout when they
[1:10:55] shout they said they got it amen
[1:10:59] a lot of them shouted but they didn't
[1:11:01] have it it's still happening to this day
[1:11:04] a lot of people shouting and they don't
[1:11:06] have it and they claim they have it the
[1:11:09] Pentecostal said when you speak in
[1:11:11] tongues you got it and many speak in
[1:11:14] tongues and they don't have it praise
[1:11:17] the Lord look how all kinds of forms
[1:11:21] these Pharisees had
[1:11:22] amen
[1:11:24] but when the word was made manifest they
[1:11:28] did not recognize it
[1:11:31] in other words they were reading this
[1:11:33] they were reading the five books of
[1:11:35] Moses the pentateuch and you're reading
[1:11:38] all those scriptures and everything else
[1:11:39] and studying it in fine detail is
[1:11:42] showing you intellectuals will not work
[1:11:47] the Pharisees sadness is already tried
[1:11:49] it even with pins they they memorize
[1:11:52] until they can tell you with their eyes
[1:11:55] closed what verses that pin went through
[1:11:58] and stuck on and they could do it amen
[1:12:01] and still they did not recognize the
[1:12:05] word when he revealed himself
[1:12:08] because it's not by natural human
[1:12:12] recognition of intellectualism but it's
[1:12:15] by the revelation of the holy spirit
[1:12:18] that the True Believer recognizes God
[1:12:21] oh not by something you can say Oh by
[1:12:25] this skill or that skill or this
[1:12:27] knowledge but you you come to a place
[1:12:30] where you know that you know
[1:12:33] God brings you to that place
[1:12:35] supernaturally amen praise God we
[1:12:39] weren't worthy of it we want to work
[1:12:43] ourselves up into worthiness work
[1:12:45] ourselves up into Holiness work
[1:12:47] ourselves up into spiritual
[1:12:50] manifestations of activity and that made
[1:12:53] us worthy in the presence of God because
[1:12:55] we we have in healing we're having
[1:12:57] Miracles we're having dancings in the
[1:13:00] spirit and oh we're having rejoicing the
[1:13:03] services
[1:13:04] overwhelming and music that's wonderful
[1:13:07] but that's not it
[1:13:09] amen praise God you have those things
[1:13:13] but your blessed bless God Like Jesus
[1:13:15] said you better praise him that your
[1:13:18] name was already written up there in
[1:13:20] heaven
[1:13:22] your name have to be there praise God
[1:13:25] hallelujah glory to God Amen oh my oh
[1:13:29] see many in tongues they didn't have it
[1:13:32] Hallelujah but you see if you are the
[1:13:36] bride the Bride is a part of the husband
[1:13:41] amen the only place you'll ever
[1:13:45] recognize it is to recognize what part
[1:13:49] of that husband
[1:13:51] that you are praise God I'll talk touch
[1:13:55] on that little later praise God Amen you
[1:13:59] have to recognize your position
[1:14:03] recognize which part of the Bride you
[1:14:05] are glory to God now I've got courts
[1:14:09] there but sometimes I'm not even we'll
[1:14:11] look at them I'll just talk with you
[1:14:13] because you understand here what he's
[1:14:15] talking about in the in the body of of
[1:14:19] the lord of the of the church the body
[1:14:22] being built of his wife that was
[1:14:25] separated from him at at Calvary or
[1:14:28] Golgotha amen praise God you understand
[1:14:32] uh it was built through the church ages
[1:14:37] um you can go up maybe we'll find that I
[1:14:40] have the code somewhere here where he
[1:14:42] said you understand God building the
[1:14:44] body and then the foot let's say the
[1:14:47] foot was in Luther and then the this
[1:14:51] part of the body gets rid of the waste
[1:14:53] and Wesley Holiness he was preaching and
[1:14:56] then it came up to the the body came to
[1:14:59] the point of tongues where the
[1:15:02] Pentecostals come on a scene he says and
[1:15:05] now we see the seeing age seeing age
[1:15:08] what the prophet
[1:15:10] is that right oh my praise God and so we
[1:15:15] go to the seeing age with a prophet
[1:15:18] praise the Lord and then all of a sudden
[1:15:20] it goes from the seeing Edge he says
[1:15:23] after that there are no more moving
[1:15:25] parts
[1:15:27] amen why it goes to the Mind age
[1:15:33] praise the Lord it goes to the Mind age
[1:15:36] because you see after the sin Edge where
[1:15:39] the words start breaking
[1:15:42] and a few Believers start seeing they'll
[1:15:46] have a while in the message itself while
[1:15:49] they're here to begin to process that
[1:15:52] word
[1:15:53] and that word starts going through them
[1:15:56] and when it goes there like a Roman a
[1:16:00] firecracker whatever you want to call it
[1:16:02] takes them into another dimension
[1:16:05] where their breath into the very
[1:16:08] presence of the Living God
[1:16:10] they break into the spirit of the Living
[1:16:14] God and they begin to live from that
[1:16:18] Dimension or that place or position
[1:16:21] praise the Lord God help me to express
[1:16:23] amen but praise the Lord Jesus they live
[1:16:27] from that point there so I say I believe
[1:16:32] that we are past the seeing age
[1:16:37] we have past those ages we are now in
[1:16:41] the place where we are right back in the
[1:16:44] mind of God hallelujah and the entire
[1:16:48] body no more moving Parts moving around
[1:16:51] but back the only move by him only his
[1:16:55] Spirit only his thoughts amen
[1:16:58] manifesting through them for the glory
[1:17:01] and praise of God hallelujah amen see oh
[1:17:06] how many sees that amen oh see that
[1:17:11] recognize what part of that husband of
[1:17:14] the word that you are how many sees that
[1:17:17] you see that's what he's getting at way
[1:17:20] back there he understood these things so
[1:17:23] he's trying to tell those people that
[1:17:25] were still tied up in Pentecostalism
[1:17:27] tied up in this and tied up in that but
[1:17:31] he's just preaching it and hoping that
[1:17:34] somebody would see it then but he knew
[1:17:36] after he was gone that these things are
[1:17:39] going to be made manifest Amen to the
[1:17:42] three elected seed to recognize their
[1:17:45] position in the husband now to say it in
[1:17:49] clear words so that you might understand
[1:17:51] which part of that of the body you are
[1:17:55] you are not in the foot
[1:17:58] so you are not in the Wesley for the
[1:18:02] West you are not in the tongues
[1:18:05] you're not in the lips we enjoyed being
[1:18:09] with the prophet with the age of
[1:18:11] discernment and all those things we
[1:18:14] enjoyed it but then it breaks me on him
[1:18:18] and it goes into the realm of the mind
[1:18:23] or spirit and right into God himself
[1:18:29] praise God
[1:18:30] and he's saying to you now that wife
[1:18:34] must wreck or bride if you want to call
[1:18:36] her must recognize what part of the body
[1:18:41] she really is
[1:18:43] is that right praise God so you we must
[1:18:47] recognize what age
[1:18:50] and what part of the body is represented
[1:18:53] or manifested in that particular age
[1:18:56] praise the Lord a seed has processes the
[1:19:00] planting time with growing time it's
[1:19:02] this time is maturing and ripening time
[1:19:05] is Harvest Time and praise God you
[1:19:08] recognize what part of the day you are
[1:19:11] in
[1:19:12] praise the Lord that is your position
[1:19:14] praise the Lord not like we many years
[1:19:17] we thought oh you must recognize your
[1:19:19] position you must recognize if you are
[1:19:21] this or if you are that and replace
[1:19:24] people in all kinds of confusion because
[1:19:27] it's not talking about those kinds of
[1:19:29] human positions it talks about your
[1:19:33] position in Christ
[1:19:35] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[1:19:38] now you see then you can't recognize
[1:19:41] somebody else's position
[1:19:43] amen he's not talking about the people
[1:19:46] in the church like they might have
[1:19:48] thought you can't recognize uh brother
[1:19:50] Neville's position or brother so-and-so
[1:19:53] position that's not what he was really
[1:19:54] talking about but they might have
[1:19:57] understood it that way he was talking
[1:19:59] about in that body being built you must
[1:20:03] understand and recognize what part of
[1:20:06] that you are in there which part you are
[1:20:10] represented in where is your
[1:20:12] representation in there praise God see
[1:20:16] you can't recognize somebody else's now
[1:20:19] here it is what if Moses would have come
[1:20:22] with Noah's message
[1:20:23] see and Noah was a part was a part of it
[1:20:29] praise God but it would not work
[1:20:32] Hallelujah why would we know about
[1:20:35] Luther and all these people and it's not
[1:20:37] that we are
[1:20:39] um lessening them or putting them off uh
[1:20:42] we know they're a part of this too amen
[1:20:45] this is what he's saying Noah was a part
[1:20:47] of it but you see Moses couldn't go back
[1:20:50] and just recognize Noah's position no he
[1:20:54] had to preach what God gave him for his
[1:20:57] day for his time and to live out that
[1:21:00] part that he is supposed to play for the
[1:21:02] glory of God hallelujah it would not
[1:21:05] work what if Jesus himself would come
[1:21:08] with Moses message it would not work
[1:21:11] it's true it's right it's scriptural but
[1:21:14] the skill was not the position was not
[1:21:17] the time it was not appropriate thing to
[1:21:20] be made Express and manifest for that
[1:21:23] hour amen he was there to express
[1:21:26] Redemption
[1:21:28] he was there to express salvation he was
[1:21:31] there to express himself as the Lamb of
[1:21:33] God that taken away the sins of the
[1:21:36] world praise God he could not go back to
[1:21:38] Moses time burning sacrifices and and
[1:21:41] you see it would have been out of tune
[1:21:44] out of the rhythm of the word of God he
[1:21:48] would have been out out of that praise
[1:21:50] the name of the Lord hallelujah see it
[1:21:53] was like that because it was a different
[1:21:56] age
[1:21:58] Hallelujah it was a different prophecy
[1:22:02] different part of the word that had to
[1:22:06] be fulfilled there or in other words in
[1:22:09] his time amen and this is the last part
[1:22:13] of the word for our our church ages to
[1:22:18] be fulfilled now praise God so we're not
[1:22:21] here to fulfill what they already
[1:22:23] fulfilled we are here to fulfill this
[1:22:26] part of the word and what part you
[1:22:28] supposed to fulfill to be the wife of
[1:22:31] Christ
[1:22:32] to be the United wife of Christ
[1:22:35] and to walk with him hand in hand The
[1:22:38] King and I walk life's Road Together
[1:22:41] amen and the people are just in
[1:22:44] wonderment as we go passing by oh praise
[1:22:48] God now wonderful it's nice when a
[1:22:50] husband can walk hand in hand with his
[1:22:51] wife some wives don't like that
[1:22:54] depends on the timing
[1:22:57] sometimes I go to hold my Western and
[1:22:59] say oh get away
[1:23:02] foreign
[1:23:04] I said well this is not the appropriate
[1:23:06] time to hold my hand there's so many
[1:23:09] people all around and looking on all
[1:23:11] this kind of thing like that you know
[1:23:13] praise God but that's just the human
[1:23:15] part amen but we are walking with the
[1:23:18] King of Kings
[1:23:20] we are walking with the King of Kings
[1:23:23] praise God hallelujah now the word had
[1:23:28] to be fulfilled there there there there

[1:25:32] wonderful wonderful so
[1:25:34] you must recognize too I'm making
[1:25:37] several points he chose us and because
[1:25:41] he chose us that settles it in our heart
[1:25:45] that we don't have to wrestle with the
[1:25:47] thought anymore that from the inside out
[1:25:51] we are Eternal beings
[1:25:53] in a body of time
[1:25:56] is that right the body of time will pass
[1:25:59] away
[1:26:00] that because it's
[1:26:02] eternity dwelling in time for a period
[1:26:05] of time this world is not my home I'm
[1:26:09] just a passing through my treasures are
[1:26:13] laid up Way Beyond the blue amen oh
[1:26:17] praise God you feel the holy hills of
[1:26:20] Heaven calling out to you amen oh come
[1:26:24] home come home it's suppertime oh
[1:26:27] blessed be the name of the Living God
[1:26:30] Amen yes sir now quoting from who is
[1:26:34] this Melchizedek
[1:26:38] now being eternal
[1:26:41] with him
[1:26:43] at the beginning
[1:26:45] the eternal life that you had his talk
[1:26:50] of what you was
[1:26:53] only he wanted me to stand in the pulpit
[1:26:57] and his Prophet continues to speak but
[1:27:00] the thought I'm bringing here to you
[1:27:01] listen to what he said
[1:27:03] being Eternal with him at the beginning
[1:27:06] the
[1:27:08] eternal life that you had
[1:27:11] not that you just got
[1:27:14] amen but the eternal life that you had
[1:27:18] you already had it
[1:27:20] because you are you are part of it you
[1:27:23] are in it amen and you have it so you
[1:27:26] didn't come down here to get it
[1:27:28] you understand what I'm saying you
[1:27:30] didn't come down here to get it because
[1:27:32] you already had it praise the name of
[1:27:35] the Lord Lord we can't speak for others
[1:27:37] I'm just talking to you you if you are
[1:27:40] three elected seed and that's not for
[1:27:42] even for me to be able to uh separate
[1:27:46] that that's for God to do but I must
[1:27:48] preach the word so that he could fulfill
[1:27:51] his duty and you to know and I don't
[1:27:53] know where I am and here's wonderful
[1:27:57] praise God hallelujah amen oh yes I'm so
[1:28:02] glad go back to what we spoke on I think
[1:28:04] it's last week the spirit man God being
[1:28:07] spirit and making if you go to Genesis 1
[1:28:10] and Genesis 2 you're going to find this
[1:28:12] like two atoms because it says he God
[1:28:14] form God first of all uh you know
[1:28:18] brought Adam here and Adam was an image
[1:28:21] he says of himself right and it tells
[1:28:25] you in a Genesis 2 how God formed man of
[1:28:29] the Dust of the earth well it's not two
[1:28:31] men right or the Bible comes with itself
[1:28:35] but it's God being God as the Holy
[1:28:39] Spirit the eternal spirit Adam In His
[1:28:42] Image a spirit man a spirit being and
[1:28:47] then uh that man like we explained could
[1:28:50] not till the soil
[1:28:52] he couldn't take a fork he couldn't take
[1:28:54] a branch and dig the ground to to keep
[1:28:56] the flowers or anything so God had to
[1:29:00] form a body to put that Spirit man in
[1:29:05] and that's what happened the spirit man
[1:29:08] went into the man of Earth
[1:29:11] hallelujah praise God now today uh we
[1:29:15] find out because of sin that's how it
[1:29:18] should have been but because of sin we
[1:29:20] find that the Earth's man cannot last
[1:29:24] amen and he has got to pass away amen
[1:29:28] but that man on the inside goes to meet
[1:29:31] its maker good or bad it has to meet
[1:29:34] this maker come from God it's got to
[1:29:37] meet God and meet its own judgment
[1:29:39] praise God hallelujah amen but what the
[1:29:43] Bible tells us after death the Judgment
[1:29:46] doesn't matter that's the way it has to
[1:29:49] be Judgment of this judgment seat of
[1:29:51] Christ or the great white Throne
[1:29:53] judgment amen but after death the
[1:29:56] Judgment in the presence of the Living
[1:29:58] God Amen praise God so you understand
[1:30:01] that when God breathed the breath of
[1:30:04] life into Adam in the beginning it was
[1:30:08] an eternal life breathed into him Adam
[1:30:11] was already eternal
[1:30:13] right he was already Eternal it was the
[1:30:17] spirit of natural life that God breathed
[1:30:20] there that he that that body that he had
[1:30:24] formed could now live and move amen
[1:30:28] praise God and we thank God for that
[1:30:31] that God came like that and fulfilled
[1:30:34] his purpose like that amen praise God
[1:30:38] glory to God Amen I'm just when I look
[1:30:42] down like this is some of the scribbles
[1:30:45] and scripts I have made on uh on the
[1:30:48] parts of some of these Pages here amen
[1:30:51] glory to God works as Faith expressed
[1:30:56] the spirit can come out here and anoint
[1:31:00] you to do certain things and you do it
[1:31:04] but that don't mean you're saved
[1:31:08] is that right the genuine Holy Spirit
[1:31:11] can anoint you to do something
[1:31:14] and yet that don't mean you're safe
[1:31:17] think of it prophesied
[1:31:22] Judas even went and cast out devils the
[1:31:26] other side of the miracle ministry
[1:31:29] Judas was a world famous evangelist
[1:31:34] is that right
[1:31:35] Amen in other words you're taking this
[1:31:38] thing from back in those days and it's
[1:31:40] expanding and growing and coming up to
[1:31:42] our time right it's just the germ
[1:31:45] showing you what's going to happen up
[1:31:47] here right but that's what it is he he
[1:31:51] could perform Miracles he came back with
[1:31:53] the rest of the disciples Master we cast
[1:31:55] out Devils we even heal the sick in your
[1:31:58] name and that is when Jesus said
[1:32:00] wonderful but uh he says don't Rejoice
[1:32:04] over that Rejoice if your name is
[1:32:06] written in heaven
[1:32:09] is that right
[1:32:11] praise the Lord watch the events watch
[1:32:13] the scripture and you will see it's
[1:32:15] right away once they said that then he
[1:32:16] said that that's how he responded to
[1:32:18] them praise the Lord now wonderful isn't
[1:32:21] it Oh Glory to God Amen so that don't
[1:32:25] mean that you are saved right the spirit
[1:32:28] anointed him this rain falls on the just
[1:32:33] and the unjust
[1:32:34] and the weeds can Rejoice with the wheat
[1:32:39] but
[1:32:40] it is what is at the core
[1:32:44] what's at the core on the inside amen
[1:32:49] well another place he said you've got to
[1:32:51] look at what is on the inside of the
[1:32:54] inside
[1:32:56] that's the one you've got to look to
[1:32:59] find out and the word test of the word
[1:33:01] is going to tell what it is amen
[1:33:05] sometimes my wife have seeds at home and
[1:33:09] the seeds may get out of the packages
[1:33:12] and a few mixed up but you can't tell
[1:33:16] what seed is what anymore well just put
[1:33:20] it in the garden
[1:33:22] and then give it the water test
[1:33:25] it Pour some water on it and just wait a
[1:33:28] while and the next thing you know them
[1:33:31] seeds begin to sprout and each one
[1:33:34] coming up to show whatever it is amen
[1:33:37] and when you come in the house of God it
[1:33:40] doesn't matter what front what face what
[1:33:43] act what you put on amen that's why I
[1:33:46] try to tell just be yourself
[1:33:49] doesn't matter what you put on the water
[1:33:52] that is coming forth here God sending
[1:33:55] water deliberately to spray on you so
[1:33:58] that whatever seed is in your heart your
[1:34:01] life will begin to break out whether you
[1:34:05] want to or you or you don't want it it's
[1:34:07] going to happen anyway because every
[1:34:09] seed must been fought after its kind
[1:34:11] that is the law of God that's the
[1:34:14] purpose of God and it must be fulfilled
[1:34:16] praise the name of the lord it's going
[1:34:19] to be done for his glory amen praise God
[1:34:22] hallelujah isn't that wonderful how do
[1:34:26] we can Rejoice praise God hallelujah
[1:34:28] glory to God and dance in the spirit and
[1:34:31] the wheat also get in the same anointing
[1:34:33] as I praise God hallelujah and dance the
[1:34:36] same way shout the same way move in the
[1:34:38] spirit the same way but it's still
[1:34:40] different
[1:34:42] because one is manifesting
[1:34:45] eternal life and the only one is
[1:34:48] manifesting whatever it is in that way
[1:34:51] praise the Lord do you understand this
[1:34:54] or do are you understanding it even if
[1:34:56] not all of it you grasp some of it here
[1:35:01] for his glory praise the Lord oh my what
[1:35:04] How Great Is Our God you can act like
[1:35:08] you received it

[1:35:12] ain't meeting in this in this church
[1:35:14] here and you act like you received it
[1:35:18] I don't know that because your act your
[1:35:22] act not just your actions can be so
[1:35:24] polished that they're deceiving to me as
[1:35:28] a human
[1:35:29] but God is Not deceived God is Not
[1:35:32] mocked you can't deceive him or mock him
[1:35:37] amen listen scripture you act like you
[1:35:41] received it Christians can even act like
[1:35:44] if they are Christians amen real
[1:35:48] Christians right and act on the ever so
[1:35:52] good at it right but that still don't
[1:35:57] mean that you are saved
[1:35:59] that's exactly right the spirit can be
[1:36:02] there
[1:36:03] the real Spirit the genuine Spirit the
[1:36:07] Holy Spirit can anoint you but still
[1:36:09] don't mean you are safe
[1:36:12] it's that inside soul
[1:36:15] That Never Dies

[1:36:22] it's God eternal life it was always was
[1:36:28] eternal life

[1:36:33] eternal life blessed be the name of the
[1:36:35] Lord I'm glad we serve a God Like This
[1:36:38] amen and he's making things clear and
[1:36:41] plain to us for the glory of God now
[1:36:46] now we spined here in the word of God
[1:36:49] that um certainly friends it doesn't
[1:36:53] matter what intellectuals you have amen
[1:36:57] if that Soul doesn't come from God it

[1:37:37] has chosen Us in him I'm going to stop
[1:37:40] when I'm arrested to stop okay because
[1:37:44] I'm not going to finish here today I'm
[1:37:47] just bringing the word and then I feel
[1:37:51] that you know it's time then I'll just
[1:37:53] you know praise the Lord no Ephesians 1
[1:37:58] 4 to 5.
[1:38:00] according as he has chosen us

[1:38:10] I've ordained you that you might go
[1:38:12] forth and bring forth much fruit praise
[1:38:15] the Lord amen according as he had chosen
[1:38:20] us
[1:38:21] in him
[1:38:23] praise the name of the Lord you were
[1:38:25] chosen to be an astronaut to be on the
[1:38:28] ship
[1:38:30] right out of a whole lot of people
[1:38:35] you were chosen and uh trained God
[1:38:40] called God train
[1:38:42] pressurized and everything else
[1:38:44] Hallelujah like no other human beings
[1:38:47] was ever pressurized God pressurizes us
[1:38:51] for the journey and we we were in the
[1:38:54] Messiah ship already
[1:38:55] uh and praise God we recognize we are
[1:38:59] part of him glory to God hallelujah
[1:39:02] before the foundation of the world
[1:39:06] see you were there before the foundation
[1:39:09] of the world that we should be holy
[1:39:12] Without Blame before him in love having
[1:39:17] predestinated us unto adoption
[1:39:21] now I wanted to see this here you
[1:39:25] already
[1:39:26] in him chosen before the foundation of
[1:39:29] the world but now he's talking about
[1:39:31] this next stage when you come down here
[1:39:35] this part your predestinated onto the
[1:39:40] adoption which means placing the
[1:39:43] adoption of sons where you are placed in
[1:39:47] whatever age is supposed to come up in
[1:39:49] yeah yeah it's down to this age praise
[1:39:53] the name of the Lord the placing praise
[1:39:55] God hallelujah amen having predestinated
[1:39:59] us onto the adoption of children by
[1:40:02] Jesus Christ by the word the word is
[1:40:04] going to let you know your place and
[1:40:07] position according to the good pleasure
[1:40:09] of his will
[1:40:12] oh praise God now we're going to break
[1:40:14] into a little bit of the sovereignty of
[1:40:16] God for a little while here
[1:40:19] uh jump over some parts of this now uh
[1:40:23] now not without getting too involved in
[1:40:26] the subject of the sovereignty of God
[1:40:29] for that would take a book in itself
[1:40:32] let me point out according to those
[1:40:34] verses Jesus Christ is choosing his own
[1:40:38] bride praise the Lord hallelujah Jesus
[1:40:42] Christ is choosing his own bride it
[1:40:44] doesn't go the opposite way now this is
[1:40:46] the age where the bride is choosing her
[1:40:48] husband
[1:40:50] no but this is the way the the systems
[1:40:54] have preached it and taught it right
[1:40:58] causing us to believe that we as our
[1:41:03] brother quoted uh you take Jesus as your
[1:41:05] savior I'm going to take him too
[1:41:08] all right oh my it doesn't work that way
[1:41:11] I choose Jesus to be my savior it sounds
[1:41:15] good it sounds poetic it sounds uh
[1:41:17] religious and brings that evokes the
[1:41:20] feeling in our hearts but that's not
[1:41:22] what it is
[1:41:24] look we can't go I'm digressing a bit
[1:41:27] here but we can't go by this human body
[1:41:30] feelings emotions and that stuff
[1:41:33] let me tell you when I was in the
[1:41:35] Catholic church and you see they were
[1:41:37] singing the Ave Maria
[1:41:39] and they were singing some of those
[1:41:41] songs beautiful
[1:41:43] I would feel it
[1:41:45] I would feel it I don't know about you
[1:41:47] but I I would feel it it was wonderful
[1:41:51] and some of those guys you couldn't see
[1:41:54] who was singing because sometimes they
[1:41:55] would put them in a place to sing it
[1:41:57] where you only hear the voices coming
[1:41:59] like from heaven
[1:42:01] right and it's beautiful and I can see
[1:42:06] why those people are trapped and they
[1:42:08] believe and and they're held like that
[1:42:10] because they get those real feelings
[1:42:14] sacred feelings they go to pray and the
[1:42:16] atmosphere created they get those pills
[1:42:19] you see but that is where this message
[1:42:21] came to pull us out of that part of your
[1:42:25] being that you will divorce from that
[1:42:28] man divorce from them things and
[1:42:31] recognize the word for your day where
[1:42:35] you accept the word is as without
[1:42:37] sensation baptism the Holy Ghost without
[1:42:41] any sensation whatsoever you recognize
[1:42:44] afterwards who you are and your position
[1:42:47] in Christ oh my then your emotions may
[1:42:51] explode after that but you recognize Who
[1:42:53] You Are
[1:42:54] the word of God strikes you and you'll
[1:42:57] recognize your position in Jesus Christ
[1:42:59] amen Jesus Christ is choosing his own
[1:43:02] bride just the same as men choose their
[1:43:06] Brides today
[1:43:09] the bride doesn't simply decide she is
[1:43:13] going to take a certain man
[1:43:16] of course
[1:43:17] I know it sounds ridiculous but she
[1:43:21] doesn't just walk out there and say oh I
[1:43:23] want that one
[1:43:26] oh my that part looks so tall and
[1:43:29] strapping and manly and oh look at his
[1:43:33] abdominals look at this muscles my
[1:43:35] that's the one no she doesn't go out
[1:43:38] there and just choose like that amen at
[1:43:41] least a sensible woman don't choose like
[1:43:43] that praise God it doesn't work that way
[1:43:46] according to God see she doesn't decide
[1:43:50] she's going to have a certain man for a
[1:43:52] husband no sir it's the groom who
[1:43:55] decides and chooses a certain woman for
[1:43:59] his right
[1:44:01] and he quotes our text
[1:44:03] bar
[1:44:05] you have not chosen me
[1:44:09] I have chosen you
[1:44:11] amen now according to the word of God
[1:44:15] the bride was chosen before the
[1:44:19] foundation of the world
[1:44:22] praise the Lord she's not been chosen
[1:44:24] now
[1:44:25] amen that's not what's happening now
[1:44:28] praise God this choosing of the bride
[1:44:31] was purpose where
[1:44:33] in himself
[1:44:35] she was already there amen so she was
[1:44:38] purpose in him
[1:44:40] in his mind and his being he was purpose
[1:44:44] according to election might stand
[1:44:49] hallelujah praise God oh my you can't
[1:44:53] read this any other way the heart
[1:44:55] purpose the heart purpose amen and that
[1:44:59] word put in there the prophet said it
[1:45:01] but he's talking about his love for his
[1:45:03] wife his in there he chose her with the
[1:45:06] love in his heart his heart's purpose
[1:45:09] the Eternal purpose
[1:45:12] of God was to take a bride of his own
[1:45:18] of his own choosing
[1:45:21] and that purpose was in himself being
[1:45:26] Eternal was decreed before the
[1:45:29] foundation of the world now let's talk
[1:45:32] about you and I
[1:45:33] watch carefully now see this before
[1:45:36] there was ever a speck of Stardust
[1:45:39] before God was God Amen God is an object
[1:45:44] of adoration and no one was there to
[1:45:47] worship Him so he was at the time only
[1:45:51] potentially God which is to say he was
[1:45:55] eloh him the self-existing one he was
[1:45:59] known only as eternal spirit
[1:46:03] the bride was already in his mind praise
[1:46:08] the Lord hallelujah yes she was she was
[1:46:12] existing in his thoughts and what about
[1:46:16] the thoughts of God there are eternal
[1:46:21] amen so the Eternal thoughts of God let
[1:46:24] me ask you are the thoughts of God
[1:46:27] Eternal if you can see this you will see
[1:46:29] many things
[1:46:31] praise God and I believe we are seeing
[1:46:34] many things now
[1:46:36] when he said it then they could not see
[1:46:38] all them things back there but now we
[1:46:41] are seeing many things by the word of
[1:46:43] God opening up to us amen oh praise God
[1:46:47] God is unchangeable in both his essence
[1:46:52] and you're a part of that is that right
[1:46:56] and behavior
[1:46:58] praise God we have studied that and
[1:47:02] proven that already God is infinite in
[1:47:05] his abilities so therefore he as God
[1:47:08] must be omniscient if he is omniscient
[1:47:11] then he is not now learning
[1:47:15] right in other words like these
[1:47:17] theologians teach he's now finding out
[1:47:19] who is going to be saved and who is
[1:47:21] going to be lost
[1:47:23] Who belongs to him and who doesn't
[1:47:25] belong to him
[1:47:27] right so God is not now learning
[1:47:32] amen Lord is he taking counselor even
[1:47:37] with himself nor is he at any time
[1:47:42] adding to his knowledge
[1:47:45] yes he knew me
[1:47:48] yes he knew me but he is not adding to
[1:47:51] his knowledge or his knowing of who is
[1:47:54] going to be part of that bride that was
[1:47:57] already purpose
[1:47:59] in him with love before the foundations
[1:48:03] of the world well we just say that
[1:48:05] easily but the prophet kind of break it
[1:48:07] down by saying before there was even a
[1:48:09] speck of Stardust many other places said
[1:48:12] before there was even one molecule or
[1:48:15] atom and nothing was there but God
[1:48:18] himself and she was a part of him she
[1:48:21] was already in Him Praise the Lord glory
[1:48:24] to God now think of it no because all
[1:48:29] his thoughts he has always had
[1:48:34] they're eternal
[1:48:36] so you always had those thoughts in him
[1:48:40] amen and will always have he's not going
[1:48:45] to lose one
[1:48:47] because he loved them
[1:48:49] and knows the end from the beginning
[1:48:53] because he is God just the thoughts of
[1:48:57] God are eternal
[1:49:00] and they are real
[1:49:02] they are not simply like a man with a
[1:49:05] blueprint he has drawn up which one day
[1:49:08] will be translated into substance and
[1:49:11] form they are already real and eternal
[1:49:14] and a part of God in other words when
[1:49:17] God think of it he sees the beginning
[1:49:19] from the end
[1:49:21] and to him everything is real already
[1:49:24] it's just some passing of time
[1:49:27] for it to translate transmit transmute
[1:49:32] and more however you want to describe it
[1:49:35] it's just for that to take place but
[1:49:38] it's been spoken
[1:49:40] all right it has been spoken now let it
[1:49:43] be done praise God that's the way God in
[1:49:46] his wonderful that's out of the Smyrna
[1:49:48] Church age praise the Lord they are
[1:49:51] already real and they are Eternal praise
[1:49:55] the Lord God hallelujah amen God is good
[1:49:58] isn't he
[1:49:59] let's continue in the church age book
[1:50:02] here I just want you to see this now now
[1:50:05] you see uh I got this I'm pausing here
[1:50:08] now and I may even end in a little while
[1:50:10] where
[1:50:12] um people are saying that you don't have
[1:50:14] any choice
[1:50:17] really you don't have no choice
[1:50:20] because if you've been predestinated
[1:50:23] then you you don't have no choice
[1:50:25] right but that's not scriptural
[1:50:29] that's not the word
[1:50:31] see and that's not something that I'm
[1:50:34] confronting now I confronting this many
[1:50:37] years ago since the 80s where people
[1:50:40] were saying these kinds of things and
[1:50:42] the spirit of God took me back to the
[1:50:44] word and began to show it right out of
[1:50:46] the church age book here praise the name
[1:50:49] of the Lord now if we go out and says
[1:50:51] now it says in Isaiah 22 22
[1:50:56] and the key of the House of David will
[1:50:59] lay upon his shoulder
[1:51:01] so he shall open and None Shall shut his
[1:51:05] choosing his bride and he's going to
[1:51:07] talking about a key
[1:51:09] Israel right he's going to talking about
[1:51:11] the key and that key is going to be on
[1:51:14] his shoulder praise the Lord amen and
[1:51:17] when he shuts no man can open when he
[1:51:21] opens no man can shut because of um
[1:51:24] prior teaching you will understand what
[1:51:27] that is speaking about but it will
[1:51:29] become clearer and None Shall open the
[1:51:32] spirit uses this Old Testament reference
[1:51:34] concerning the Lord Jesus Christ and his
[1:51:37] ministry in the church what the Key of
[1:51:39] David signified at that time is mere
[1:51:43] Shadow which is now
[1:51:47] fulfilled when now when now fulfilled in
[1:51:53] this day Jesus standing in the midst of
[1:51:56] the lampstands it has to do with our
[1:51:58] Lord after his resurrection not his
[1:52:01] Earthly Ministry amen after his
[1:52:05] resurrection and not his Earthly
[1:52:07] pilgrimage what does this key signified
[1:52:09] the answer lies in the position of the
[1:52:12] key not in the hands of other men
[1:52:16] not in the hands of a theologian I have
[1:52:20] the master key
[1:52:22] right I have the key to decode the Bible
[1:52:28] I have the key to unlock the Book of
[1:52:32] Revelation these are the kinds of things
[1:52:34] that talk about and it sounds wonderful
[1:52:37] but they're Liars and the truth is not
[1:52:41] in them for the word of God says he
[1:52:44] alone holds the key of David
[1:52:47] no man can open up your understanding
[1:52:50] like that no man can open up your heart
[1:52:53] like that no man can open that up and
[1:52:56] when I shut you out you are shut out
[1:52:59] no man can put you in there but no
[1:53:03] matter they can preach like an angel
[1:53:04] they can sing like like Angels they can
[1:53:07] speak in tongues that cannot bless you
[1:53:10] in this dimension only he who has the
[1:53:13] Key of David that can open and said come
[1:53:17] you my good and Faithful Servants enter
[1:53:20] in to the joys of your Lord hallelujah
[1:53:23] only he can do that amen oh my it is not
[1:53:28] placed in the hands of other men or the
[1:53:30] verse could not be saying he alone has
[1:53:34] the use of the key for he alone opens
[1:53:38] and shots praise God oh praise God you
[1:53:42] see if you take it simple that we
[1:53:44] understand these things
[1:53:46] now we see these things
[1:53:49] not that other people may not be even
[1:53:51] hearing some preachers preaching the
[1:53:54] same thing but are they
[1:53:57] understanding by Revelation what they're
[1:54:00] hearing not talking about understanding
[1:54:02] intellectually because anybody here in
[1:54:04] English language being spoken can
[1:54:06] understand that so you can easily say oh
[1:54:08] yeah I understand but the real
[1:54:10] understanding of Revelation from the
[1:54:13] word of God hallelujah now where is the
[1:54:16] key it's on his shoulder but what does
[1:54:19] the shoulder have to do with it Isaiah 9
[1:54:21] 6 the government shall be upon his
[1:54:24] shoulder you see praise God remember
[1:54:26] keep this in the mind he just come from
[1:54:29] Jesus choosing his bride then he comes
[1:54:33] talking about the key he comes talking
[1:54:35] about the key being on his shoulder amen
[1:54:38] but what does that mean the answer is
[1:54:40] this the government upon his shoulder it
[1:54:43] comes from the wedding ceremony of the
[1:54:46] East
[1:54:47] now regards the wedding now praise God
[1:54:50] weddings now praise God when the bride
[1:54:53] has been committed to the groom
[1:54:58] she takes off her veil and places it
[1:55:02] over the groom's shoulders praise the
[1:55:06] Lord amen praise God I'm just speaking
[1:55:09] here now because those things at the
[1:55:11] time I wrote them on the side of my old
[1:55:13] church age book where right there is
[1:55:16] where God says no I chose the bride
[1:55:21] but she in turn has to accept my choice
[1:55:25] that is her choosing
[1:55:28] that is her choosing is accepting my
[1:55:31] choice and this is where the script that
[1:55:34] the quotation here the prophet is saying
[1:55:36] and now the bride has been committed to
[1:55:40] the groom why because he accept the
[1:55:43] choice that he made and so she commits
[1:55:46] herself into his hands his leadership
[1:55:48] his guidance to walk with him talk with
[1:55:52] him praise the name of the Living God
[1:55:54] and text then she takes off her veil and
[1:55:59] places it over the groom's shoulders
[1:56:01] praise the Lord I I briefly glanced at
[1:56:05] at some of that before I came and and
[1:56:07] there you know
[1:56:09] all my friends of our inward thoughts
[1:56:13] and hearts all of our being all of the
[1:56:17] things many of us we carry things you
[1:56:19] carry things I carry things that I have
[1:56:21] hid in my soul in my heart and the whole
[1:56:24] world don't know anything about it until
[1:56:27] I speak it but other than that is
[1:56:29] between Me Myself and God
[1:56:31] amen praise God what the real bride
[1:56:35] doesn't care I found the bridegroom she
[1:56:39] tells him anything she opens up a heart
[1:56:41] she speaks to him and reveals whatever
[1:56:44] is in her mind praise God and that's
[1:56:47] where we are at here today by the grace
[1:56:49] of God we have got nothing else but him
[1:56:52] he is our Everything Jesus is our
[1:56:55] everything amen
[1:56:58] Hallelujah and from there she blesses us
[1:57:02] on the groom's shoulder signifying not
[1:57:05] only is she under his Dominion are we
[1:57:08] under his Dominion we under his
[1:57:10] preeminence amen she has transferred her
[1:57:15] rights to him and he is the head and
[1:57:19] also that he Bears responsibility praise
[1:57:23] God and Care hallelujah praise God you
[1:57:29] know all the things a man should do
[1:57:31] protection provision so on so on all
[1:57:34] that is symbolized by her taking off how
[1:57:38] she used to Avail her personality Avail
[1:57:41] herself she take the veil off put it on
[1:57:44] his shoulder amen now you I I I take off
[1:57:49] the mascara I take off all the paints I
[1:57:51] take off all the ax I take off amen oh
[1:57:54] my she took it all off I want you to see
[1:57:57] the real me then
[1:57:59] amen I I I don't want you just to be
[1:58:02] attracted to me just that my beauty is
[1:58:07] just skin deep
[1:58:09] but I want you to see the real Beauty
[1:58:12] inside of the inside of me and recognize
[1:58:15] me for who I am
[1:58:17] so she takes off all the veil that she
[1:58:19] used to have hiding up her face and
[1:58:22] everything else like that amen and
[1:58:24] transformed her rights to him that he is
[1:58:27] the head and also that he Bears
[1:58:28] responsibility and care and that he and
[1:58:31] he alone no one else no other man no
[1:58:36] other power
[1:58:38] no system none of them have any right or
[1:58:43] responsibility and that beloved is the
[1:58:46] Key of David and I've got the key thanks
[1:58:50] be to God I got the key the word has
[1:58:54] opened up and once the word opened up he
[1:58:57] gives us the key the Revelation is the
[1:59:00] key amen
[1:59:02] the revelation of the word of God now
[1:59:06] don't you see why the Bible become a new
[1:59:09] Bible
[1:59:10] and you read all them chapters that
[1:59:13] you've read through the Bible maybe I
[1:59:16] don't know how many times you read
[1:59:18] through it and yet when you go back over
[1:59:20] and you read again you can't hardly get
[1:59:23] out of one chapter or maybe one verse
[1:59:26] will grab you and you can't get away
[1:59:27] from that verse whether Branham got that
[1:59:30] scripture over there about job and he
[1:59:32] says I've been preaching three months
[1:59:34] and I can't get away move I can't get
[1:59:37] away from job on the aspile I I I can't
[1:59:40] get them off of there until God said
[1:59:42] okay you you preach enough about that
[1:59:44] and then he could move on but he was
[1:59:47] right there and that's so with every one
[1:59:49] of us sometimes you wake up one morning
[1:59:51] and one scripture strikes your mind it
[1:59:54] won't leave you all day
[1:59:57] maybe I won't leave you the next day
[1:59:59] it'll keep you like that until out of
[2:00:02] that he's able to show you what he
[2:00:04] really wants to tell you out of the very
[2:00:06] scripture that's the way it is and I'm
[2:00:08] going to close right here now praise God
[2:00:10] he for new God being sovereign
[2:00:14] for new by Divine decree exactly who
[2:00:18] would be in his bride
[2:00:20] he chose her
[2:00:23] she did not choose him
[2:00:26] but that does not mean she did not have
[2:00:29] any
[2:00:31] part in that
[2:00:33] because she had to commit herself to him
[2:00:37] praise the Lord amen oh my Hallelujah
[2:00:42] he called her
[2:00:44] she did not call
[2:00:46] she did not come on her own amen he died
[2:00:51] for her he washed her in his own blood
[2:00:54] he paid the price for her she belongs to
[2:00:57] him and him alone amen she is Holy
[2:01:01] committed to him while the musicians are
[2:01:03] coming amen and he accepts that
[2:01:06] obligation he is our head for Christ is
[2:01:09] the head of his church as Sarah called
[2:01:11] Abraham Lord even so the bride is happy
[2:01:16] that he is our Lord he speaks
[2:01:20] and she obeys
[2:01:22] for that is her Delight
[2:01:26] is that your Delight
[2:01:28] is that your joy
[2:01:30] that is our peace
[2:01:32] amen praise the name of the Lord
[2:01:37] when their ring those golden Bells
[2:01:42] and why that caught my attention because
[2:01:45] it it has a part in there I can't even
[2:01:47] remember the entire song word for word
[2:01:49] but it just keeps coming and then my
[2:01:53] chosen ones within those Gates and
