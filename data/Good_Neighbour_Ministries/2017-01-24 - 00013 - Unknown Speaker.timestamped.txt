[0:00] able Ministers of the New
[0:04] Testament able Ministers of the New
[0:07] Testament not of the letter you're not
[0:09] Ministers of the
[0:11] letter right but of the spirit it's not
[0:16] so much the words only that you're
[0:18] talk but you're supposed to minister the
[0:21] spirit to the people right for the
[0:25] letter kill
[0:27] it what the spirit gives it life amen
[0:32] father bless your word to your people
[0:34] tonight in Simplicity and humility take
[0:37] all the glory and praise in Jesus name
[0:40] amen amen sounds so funny please receive
[0:44] it but I think um i' I've told it many
[0:48] times a few Believers about it I was in
[0:51] a foreign country and there were a three
[0:54] four ministers there and at this time
[0:57] this gentleman was one of the leading
[0:58] minister in church
[1:01] a thousand people come in the southern
[1:04] us there was well
[1:06] known and there was another brother and
[1:10] and he tried to you know the brother was
[1:12] talking with me and we were just talking
[1:14] back and forth on deep things to the
[1:16] Lord and this brother try to get in the
[1:19] conversation to put in his peace and
[1:23] this wellknown preacher turn and says
[1:26] shut up before I bury you with c
[1:32] he's going to bury him with quotes he
[1:35] was right the Bible tells us the letter
[1:39] kills what the spirit is
[1:42] like that
[1:45] right now it's true at the time when he
[1:48] said it it was just funny to me but you
[1:50] know I'm thinking of it now is truth the
[1:53] letter kills they can put you to death
[1:57] is all right I mean those brother B even
[2:00] used the term he says they can spit it
[2:02] out faster than the machine gun so so uh
[2:06] that's fine that but that doesn't tell
[2:08] you anything and people Shout Scream but
[2:13] what you screaming up is the Holy Ghost
[2:15] falling on you or are you so astonished
[2:18] and amazed at the man's uh elasticity of
[2:23] mind or his um mental agility or
[2:27] something like that uh his ability to
[2:31] retain his photographic memory and you
[2:33] get impressed by that but what are you
[2:36] actually
[2:39] hearing you've got to be able to see how
[2:41] the word places
[2:44] itself and as you grow in the Holy
[2:47] Spirit and as you listen for the
[2:50] revealed
[2:51] word you will be able to deser these
[2:54] Spirits much better than you did before
[2:57] amen the Indian chief puts it another
[3:00] way say Chief you went to service how
[3:03] was it what did you get he says much
[3:05] Thunder Lots lightning no
[3:08] R right it's the same thing right so we
[3:12] have to be aware that we didn't just
[3:15] come the music is good praise the Lord
[3:18] am fellowship with each other great
[3:21] wonderful but brother grandon we come to
[3:25] receive the word for this hour amen amen
[3:29] he is our King yes he is
[3:33] Sovereign and he appeared in flesh so
[3:36] that we get to know him they he
[3:38] disappear so that now when you don't see
[3:40] him at least you know his character am
[3:43] you know who he is and you know how he
[3:45] acts and so we are worshiping an
[3:50] invisible God an invisible
[3:54] King and he said he's going to be here
[3:56] Among Us yes because I w't Leave You
[4:00] uh comfortless or leave you alone but
[4:02] I'll be with you even in you to the very
[4:05] end of the age amen so we are comforted
[4:09] with the fact that he's here with us
[4:11] tonight whether the Thunders roll the
[4:14] lightning flash or what something breaks
[4:17] out whatever he chooses to do we are
[4:20] open to it but we know he is with us
[4:23] amen amen and that's what's important
[4:27] yes sir not where home brother is going
[4:31] to be there my God you know right now if
[4:33] you were to here even in the middle of
[4:35] the week that certain brother was going
[4:37] to be passing through here you see how
[4:39] many people will be here from all the
[4:41] churches is that right but
[4:45] Jesus you know we have him with the poor
[4:49] we have with us always is that right you
[4:52] see oh Jesus who who he Joseph's son we
[4:57] know him he's from Nazareth I mean uh we
[5:01] even know all his little wicked things
[5:03] when he was a boy you know running
[5:05] around and stuff like that playing boys
[5:08] pranks and stuff so what's he going to
[5:10] tell us right I've had older people tell
[5:13] me that when I was 16 and preaching to
[5:15] them boy I've been reading the Bible for
[5:18] so many years 34 years before you come
[5:20] on this Earth what you want to
[5:24] teach what are you going to teach me but
[5:27] you see they don't understand that
[5:29] Insight teacher amen and you must not
[5:34] fail to discern the Lord's body amen not
[5:38] that body back there but which one is he
[5:40] using now to be your mother your father
[5:43] your brother your sister Discerning the
[5:45] Lord's body amen and recognizing that we
[5:49] said at the beginning of the year the
[5:51] voice of the holy spirit amen because if
[5:53] you don't recognize it all you going to
[5:55] be doing listening to words and and and
[5:58] and that's you to feed just on words and
[6:01] the Bible tells you the letter kills yes
[6:03] but the spirit gives life let me
[6:05] approach that from a different angle
[6:07] another angle is that we are part of
[6:10] that word yes you realize that amen we
[6:13] are a part of that word but as humans
[6:16] the let it kill so you can't depend even
[6:20] on the
[6:21] religious uh um pronouncements of a man
[6:26] even that will kill you you see uh
[6:30] only the Holy Spirit getting true to you
[6:33] is what's going to give you life amen so
[6:37] even me speaking here tonight I may
[6:39] speak for an hour 45 minutes and uh all
[6:43] I'm speaking sometimes only one or two
[6:46] things out of what I'm saying gets right
[6:48] through to you like that grabs your
[6:50] attention right see your spiritual food
[6:54] induces
[6:56] amen and when you receive that you hear
[7:00] that that is what gives you life is that
[7:04] right amen say sometimes you're eting an
[7:06] apple I fine you come up against some
[7:09] pits you come up against different
[7:10] things he says well all you got to do is
[7:12] just push that aside but that part that
[7:14] really fits your amen KCK it in CU
[7:18] that's your portion amen praise God
[7:20] hallelujah amen amen
[7:23] well I don't know it look like I'm come
[7:26] to confession
[7:28] tonight but I've had the um I've had the
[7:33] reputation of being quite tough Through
[7:36] The Years
[7:37] from various uh people
[7:40] preachers even membership sometimes
[7:43] think you're you're too tough but they
[7:46] uh of course don't understand that
[7:48] that's what the love of God does yes and
[7:50] if your friend is in a house uh on fire
[7:54] and and they're asleep uh you're not
[7:57] just going to come and touch them that
[7:59] you want to shake them MH you want to
[8:01] wake them up you can argue with me later
[8:04] on when you're in
[8:06] heaven I don't think anybody be
[8:09] arguing but the fact is Wake Up Now
[8:14] Praise the Lord but you end up getting
[8:16] the oh you seems like you're driving
[8:19] away more people than you're winning to
[8:21] Christ well yes and no because you know
[8:25] you trash the wheat so that you can get
[8:27] the real grave amen you don't want to or
[8:30] a whole lot of shock or as we say in the
[8:32] wtin
[8:33] husk right we don't want husk and all of
[8:38] that you always going to have some of
[8:39] that but we don't want a whole lot of
[8:41] that and just uh let it be just numbers
[8:45] uh it looks like a great achievement
[8:47] reflecting on the man no but to develop
[8:51] uh Believers that will be Eagles amen
[8:54] where one Eagle is equal to a th000
[8:57] chickens mhm is that right amen cuz one
[9:00] e will leave those thousand chickens
[9:02] alive and a barnyard of chicken see one
[9:06] e come on the SE in the scatter right
[9:09] away the scatter that makes a great
[9:11] difference I here's somebody that just
[9:14] not knows the word but they know the
[9:16] spirit of the word praise the Lord
[9:19] hallelujah well Jesus had the same
[9:22] problem and he said eat my flesh drink
[9:25] my blood or you don't have any part with
[9:28] me and and what happened the Bible said
[9:31] and some of them followed him no more
[9:34] can you imagine that Jesus had a church
[9:36] SP yes and that out the Bible tells us
[9:41] he had about 500 disciples and we know
[9:44] that the tell us only 120 made it to the
[9:47] upper
[9:48] room that means that he lost
[9:51] 380 in one day after preaching that
[9:55] sermon about eating his flesh drinking
[9:58] his blood uh or you have no part with me
[10:01] the Bible says they walked with him no
[10:04] more amen John chapter 6 number of man
[10:07] anyway so they left him and they walked
[10:11] with him no more and so he had that
[10:14] church spit because of that hard type
[10:16] that kind of preaching that stays with
[10:19] the word and the spirit and truth of the
[10:22] word of the Living God Amen so brother
[10:27] brother the same thing they said Billy
[10:30] quoting him now if you don't stop
[10:33] preaching like that you'll run everybody
[10:35] away from
[10:37] you he says you know there's one thing
[10:41] that would go and that's the holy spirit
[10:44] amen because he won't go away from the
[10:47] word hallelujah and if the True Believer
[10:51] has the Holy Spirit he said he W go away
[10:55] from the word she W go away from the
[10:57] word of God because it's food for their
[11:01] soul that's what do you think we're
[11:03] feeding on just the writing or the
[11:06] reading or the the Bible uh the words in
[11:09] the Bible amen no we are feeding on him
[11:13] the bread of life am he is our man for
[11:18] today we have come to the Feast of
[11:22] Messiah we come to feed on him yes Satan
[11:26] feeds on his children and eats them up
[11:29] is that right but God allows his
[11:31] children to feed on him what a
[11:34] difference give his life for us amen
[11:37] that we can feed upon Him Praise the
[11:40] Lord the True Believer W go from the
[11:43] word it's food to his soul he loves it
[11:47] nothing can keep him away like Jacob he
[11:51] wants that
[11:53] Birthright amen hallelujah it don't care
[11:57] if it cost him friends he's got to have
[11:59] it don't care if it cost them his job
[12:03] they've got to have iten don't matter if
[12:06] it cost them church membership they've
[12:08] got to have it cost them anything they
[12:12] still go there for they have to have it
[12:16] why it's the Deep calling to the
[12:19] Deep there's something in us that we
[12:22] can't explain how we believe you can't
[12:26] explain how do you believe something
[12:29] brother B said the real things of life
[12:31] you can't purchase with money like what
[12:33] is Peace p having peace of mind what is
[12:36] it
[12:37] really you see you can't buy that you
[12:39] can't explain what is love you know he
[12:43] mentions some of those words things like
[12:44] that he said you they're Priceless but
[12:47] those are the things that these people
[12:49] count as not right I I believe that
[12:53] Christians are chasing after some
[12:55] imaginary something wasting their time
[12:58] going to church and worshiping God and
[13:01] praising God but that's not so amen what
[13:05] appears real now is fa yes and what to
[13:10] them that they think is foolishness
[13:12] that's the wisdom of God and that's what
[13:15] be arresting our Fai God hallelujah amen
[13:19] Brother P said all the spirits operating
[13:22] today he says you can find their every
[13:26] move page 18 of uh hearing recognizing
[13:30] and acting he said you can find there
[13:33] every move today right if you go right
[13:37] back to Genesis it's the SE chapter all
[13:41] of it came right out of that book of
[13:45] Genesis and so friends let that soak
[13:48] into you let that really soak into you
[13:52] see that's the things of God it's all
[13:55] coming to a end and Jesus said W the SE
[13:59] of God and the mark of the beast are
[14:03] here again two spiritual Powers
[14:07] working amen amen they're working praise
[14:10] the Lord hallelujah amen then he says
[14:14] how many of you know that the seed of
[14:17] God is our work
[14:20] right hallelujah amen the seed of God is
[14:23] our part right and the Seal of God is
[14:27] what who the holy
[14:30] spirit amen that is hard work right
[14:34] glory to God you know you have the right
[14:38] birth when the Holy Spirit comes to you
[14:41] or you have the Holy
[14:43] Spirit and him being in you you'll never
[14:47] deviate from the word but the spirit in
[14:51] you when it hears the word the genuine
[14:54] word it will recognize that word never
[14:58] having heard it before in that fight
[15:01] right even if you never heard it like
[15:04] that before yet something in you is
[15:06] going to tell you that's right
[15:08] right that's right your mind up here may
[15:12] not be able to explain it but you get a
[15:15] a testimony a feeling a burning in Soul
[15:19] did not our hearts burn with him as he
[15:22] talked with us along the way there
[15:25] record in your soul and you know your
[15:29] recogniz and nobody can take that away
[15:32] huj said once a man has genuinely heard
[15:35] the voice of God the P of the PF nobody
[15:40] can extend it away from him in the
[15:43] natural world the great philosophers of
[15:46] today there a statement used a mind
[15:49] expanded can never
[15:52] contract is that right it cannot
[15:54] contract because it's already expanded
[15:56] to receive knowledge and wisdom of the
[15:59] day praise God Ephesians 4:30 grieve not
[16:03] the holy spirit of God whereby you are
[16:06] sealed till the day of the Redemption
[16:10] hallelujah amen so the Holy Spirit comes
[16:13] into your life it identifies you that
[16:17] you have the right birth amen or the
[16:20] birth
[16:21] right and then also he becomes your
[16:26] assurance that you will be in the
[16:30] but the scripture is telling you you are
[16:33] sealed until the day of your
[16:37] Redemption Hallelujah that means that he
[16:40] he'll stay with you and do
[16:43] everything no matter your stumblings
[16:45] your failings your this and that he is
[16:47] there to assure you certify guarantee
[16:52] and warranty that you are making it to
[16:55] that Rapture because of him that is in
[16:58] you

[17:03] here make it out of this sodomite
[17:05] conditions that the world is in today

[17:10] Your Own Strength by your own resistance
[17:13] by your tur over and no but by him that
[17:18] has already overcome that dwells in you
[17:21] that's how you

[17:25] mother that lives in you is he that is

[17:53] the Lord is the strength of my life of
[17:55] what shall I be afraid wow God in you
[18:00] the Holy Ghost living in your life
[18:02] praise God I'm trying to get to a
[18:04] certain point here but I want you to see
[18:07] clearly that he makes the difference
[18:09] amen amen praise God Amen I told the
[18:13] story sometime of a woman that make a
[18:15] beautiful wonderful cake hope none of
[18:17] you sisters make that that mistake
[18:19] anyway and she presented her husband cut
[18:21] a nice slice for him to eat he started
[18:23] eating and she Noti his face looked kind
[18:25] of funny she says what's wrong he said
[18:27] the you know know it's missing uh any
[18:33] some of the ingredients it's missing you
[18:35] know the the yeast or whatever had to be
[18:39] inside of it she said oh M and she
[18:42] tasted yes I missed the most important
[18:45] ingredient and I think that's exactly
[18:47] what a lot of Christians do they miss
[18:50] the ingredient of the holy spirit with
[18:52] their life and sometimes the church miss
[18:55] the element of the Holy Spirit and
[18:57] thinks that he's just emotional or just
[18:59] or he's just coats or or he's just Bible
[19:03] studies or something like that but he is
[19:06] a living
[19:07] person Our God isn't dead but he's alive
[19:11] it's just that we don't see him when our
[19:13] visualize you just you know now you see
[19:16] me now you don't now you see me now you
[19:18] don't amen he appears when he wants to
[19:21] appear disappears when he wants to
[19:23] disappear right because that's his way
[19:26] he wants your faith to rest on the world
[19:30] not signs wers and miracles those things
[19:32] OCC but the rest on the world and when
[19:36] your fath rest on the word signs
[19:42] follow them that
[19:44] believe because the believer is now
[19:47] founded on the word and signs
[19:50] automatically follow you amen amen that
[19:53] right yes so we don't chase after that
[19:56] anymore we don't have to chase after it
[19:58] J whatever he Wills he'll do it praise

[20:31] the seal and open it up and go and pill

[20:55] strength is made perfect in weakness

[21:00] magnify your weakness so that you will
[21:03] now go on to a spiritual complex where
[21:06] you start hiding on the bushes and
[21:08] hiding from your red but God is trying
[21:10] to tell you don't look at your complex
[21:12] look at your cir look at the big God
[21:15] that's with you that's working
[21:17] everything out

[21:39] church AG book around page 151 to 157 he
[21:43] gives a wonderful uh talk there about
[21:46] many believe that when I say come and be
[21:50] filled with the holy spirit that I mean
[21:53] they must come up and speak with tongs
[21:55] or feel something come on them so they
[21:58] can have a shake or a shiver he says let
[22:00] me make it clear I mean come and be born

[22:15] hallelujah amen so I'm trying to make
[22:18] this clear to you what what's happening
[22:20] here it's a problem in the message it's
[22:24] a problem in the message the church
[22:26] world has that problem but let's not
[22:28] even deal with them they can't even
[22:30] handle that let's deal with it in the
[22:32] message the God said to one of the
[22:34] prophets glor ye the
[22:37] trumpet and let my people become aware
[22:41] praise God hallelujah listen now you see

[23:51] life and it is a life the little cells

[23:56] around jumping around
[23:59] but when it is born then it squeals out
[24:03] and become a living Soul hallelujah amen
[24:06] now he's going to transition to the
[24:08] spiritual part of it see though that
[24:12] baby is in the womb that baby can go to
[24:16] church and even say to everyone I
[24:21] believe I believe I going to do this I'm
[24:25] going to work in the church I'm good I'm
[24:28] living right I want to do right I want
[24:30] to do right but what it needs is
[24:33] somebody to give it a good go of SP to
[24:38] wake it up for it to sque out to eternal
[24:43] life and for the Holy Spirit to scream
[24:46] inside of it
[24:48] glory amen amen hallelujah it it Scream
[24:54] the Holy Spirit scream in it like it has
[24:58] never has scream before in its life it's
[25:01] a new creature it's born of the spirit
[25:05] then it begins to grow and move and have
[25:08] its being in God see just as a baby
[25:12] natural baby has to be in this living
[25:16] world what is describing as what not
[25:19] three kinds of Believers let's dismiss
[25:21] the unbeliever but two kinds of
[25:24] Believers within the framework of the
[25:26] church another message he said will come
[25:28] to pass twins in the beginning twins in
[25:31] the End Amen is that right he said you
[25:34] can trace it through the entire Bible
[25:36] from Genesis where is SC and Abel and
[25:39] you come down you throw on the do and
[25:41] you go to Moses and and and those guys
[25:45] against him and then you come down to
[25:47] Jes and Ja against Moses and then you
[25:49] come come on up everywhere in the Bible
[25:52] you got to have that there all the time
[25:56] to come to Jesus there is Judas with
[25:58] Paul and these Breen that were with me
[26:01] you know that were ravening WS but right
[26:04] they were right there in the and
[26:06] everything else it's right like that
[26:08] it's being like that it's really it's
[26:11] the mystery of iniquity traveling along
[26:13] with the mystery of godliness at the
[26:15] same time is that right until we come to
[26:18] the end and then they go to the burning
[26:21] and we are caught up in the presence of
[26:23] God one goes down and the next one goes
[26:25] up by God's grace Hallelujah amen so
[26:29] we're talking about Believers people
[26:32] that are right in the message let it be
[26:35] 5 years 10 years 40
[26:38] years but until the light breaks through
[26:43] I'm trying to explain un
[26:45] explainable until you CAU a genine
[26:48] revelation I know you going say what are
[26:50] you talking about Prophet said who can
[26:53] teach you to Desert who can tell you to
[26:55] dream a dream uh who can even get a
[26:58] dream of themselves God has to give it
[27:00] to you amen but you see if I preach
[27:03] healing then healings will break up if I
[27:05] preach the Holy Spirit then he has a
[27:07] chance to work with you amen right
[27:10] whatever the preacher is preaching on
[27:12] that becomes available to you at that
[27:14] particular time season and moment amen
[27:17] but now let a man woman examine
[27:19] themselves praise the Lord no matter how
[27:21] religious you are he says here he says
[27:23] no so you're in the message for so many
[27:26] many years but he saying there is two
[27:30] kinds
[27:32] begotten right and they have a Christian
[27:35] life even use the word Living God
[27:38] working in the church even said they
[27:40] believe everything else like that but
[27:43] they are missing what a
[27:45] spark amen there's a spark
[27:49] Hallelujah my I think I talked about
[27:52] this in many ways where some people just
[27:54] go around life and they just they're
[27:56] just going around like that and they
[27:58] have the other time to wake up in the
[27:59] morning they got to spark this like life
[28:03] is in got to get on the job my God even
[28:08] while they on the job you know you see
[28:11] guys walk around you know I got to talk
[28:13] construction because they walk around
[28:15] with their Hammer like that until one of
[28:17] them go bang bang and the old man say he
[28:20] said Jason I can't hear you are you
[28:23] using rubber
[28:25] Hammer cuz I can't hear a song The
[28:27] Hammer must be a sponge right but then
[28:30] you got all
[28:34] guys wow praise God my I've had them
[28:38] guys come to me and say come on man slow
[28:40] down man you're making things bad for
[28:44] us I said am I going to slow down I'm
[28:46] going to feel bad if I slow down I got I
[28:49] got to produce enough for the day or I
[28:52] don't want to feel bad you know but
[28:54] somewhere in there you got to find a
[28:55] medium though you know what I mean say
[28:57] you don't just show them off completely
[28:59] but the fact is Believers are like that
[29:01] they come to worship God they come to
[29:03] serve God they come to hear the word but
[29:05] they not uh and the words of Barack
[29:09] Obama they're not fired up and ready to
[29:11] go is that right you're not fired up you
[29:15] just come to listen I just come to
[29:18] church and hear what they have to
[29:21] say
[29:26] sorry oh my praise the Lord but I have
[29:30] to display that these are some of the
[29:32] attitudes and actions that the devil
[29:36] normalizes in the middle of the mess
[29:39] churches yes until people come become
[29:42] satis satisfied with themselves the
[29:45] Bible calls it self-satisfied Church
[29:49] satisfying with themselves you know and
[29:52] with their spirituality and their growth
[29:55] and and the other brothers are looking
[29:57] up to me now the other sisters are
[29:59] looking up to me so I must a little
[30:02] consciously think like that but the
[30:03] actions make you think that they believe
[30:06] now I've arrived at a point of
[30:08] spirituality and everything else of that
[30:11] nature but yet there's a spark missing
[30:15] amen when the spark is there it driv you
[30:18] to prayer amen when the spark is there
[30:21] it driv you in the house of God when
[30:24] that spark is there you want to be the
[30:27] first one that raise up your lightning R
[30:31] of them two holy hands you got to let
[30:33] the Holy Spirit strike you and go from
[30:35] your head to your to praise the Lord
[30:38] you're not scared I'm backing off and
[30:40] say my God I don't want to behave like
[30:42] that you know yeah you know because what
[30:45] it's not going to be you going be the
[30:47] holy spirit amen but I I I repeat again
[30:51] fair and pride are two of the greatest
[30:53] enemies of the modern Christian
[30:56] Christianity is all fear Pride concerned
[30:59] about how I'm going to look you know and
[31:02] my reputation being damaged you know
[31:05] because I you know you don't want to
[31:08] behave use a word there that most people
[31:12] wouldn't know
[31:14] sayal I us to use a word you know out of
[31:18] the way praise the Lord but he says
[31:21] that's it then it waks up it can scream
[31:25] freely it's a new creature it's born of
[31:28] the spirit hallelujah oh friends if this
[31:32] Earthly T not will be dissolved we have
[31:35] another one waiting you believe that
[31:37] amen praise God waiting yes he says even
[31:41] now when you've caught the first
[31:43] revelation you heard from
[31:45] your and it's just like a
[31:48] baby just before that child is born
[31:52] Prophet said the mother become sweet
[31:54] because the angel of that child was
[31:56] already circling yes
[31:58] waiting on that mother to deliver up
[32:01] that body so that that first or
[32:05] whatever yes right he says the same
[32:09] thing we are going the opposite way if

[32:35] you can fulfill your purpose and
[32:37] position Christ until the hour that you

[32:47] you to believe brother praise the Lord
[32:50] that's not hard for me to believe us and
[32:52] for me to understand and that's what
[32:54] we're walking into everything we're

[38:48] that's the reason you forget the things
[38:51] of the world because you are going de to
[38:55] that Hallelujah
[38:58] but there is the holy spirit for you
[39:01] all that child have to come up for air
[39:03] when it gets born right the holy spirit
[39:05] is waiting for us amen the full total
[39:08] Deliverance amen is that right
[39:11] Deliverance you're delivered you're
[39:14] saved you're being saved and you will
[39:17] totally be saved at the Rapture
[39:19] Hallelujah you're saved from the sin
[39:21] committed by Adam just by being born God
[39:24] saved you from that sin by the power of
[39:26] the blood
[39:28] but then you save from that and every
[39:30] day we are walking we committing our own
[39:33] sins so every day you are being saved
[39:37] it's the three tenses of Salvation past
[39:40] present and future is that right amen
[39:45] and then when you come through this
[39:47] everyday thing where we are being saved
[39:50] from the from the very uh Power of sin
[39:55] amen from Adam we saved from the penalty
[39:58] of sin forget that you're not going hell
[40:02] anymore but now we have being saved from
[40:05] the power of
[40:07] sin the Temptation that's the sin's
[40:10] power Temptation and every day God has
[40:13] to save us from that right but then when
[40:16] the Rapture comes and he takes you out
[40:18] of
[40:19] here he's taking you out and saving you
[40:22] from the presence of sin and then if
[40:26] you're in a L beyond the river where
[40:28] there is no uh Power to
[40:32] tempt there is no presence of sin there
[40:36] is no penalty that's you have to worry
[40:39] about anymore don't you see how you can
[40:41] live through the endless
[40:43] ages forever and forever and forever
[40:47] amen don't forget what I just said
[40:49] remember that
[40:51] save from the power of
[40:53] sin amen the penalty of Sin from Adam
[40:57] the power of sin in the present time and
[41:00] then you will be saved from the presence
[41:01] of sin that is actually what brother BR
[41:04] was teaching when he preached on total
[41:08] Deliverance is that right you're
[41:11] delivered yes from Adam's sin but you
[41:14] still have to be delivered as you walk
[41:17] as a Christian every day from the sins
[41:20] that you're committing yourself right
[41:23] and The Temptations you have to overcome
[41:26] but even if you do that as long as you
[41:28] live on this Earth even if you live a
[41:29] thousand years like mat you will still
[41:32] be caught in that uh Twilight Zone of
[41:36] the power of sin always coming at you so
[41:39] he couldn't leave us here so he's not
[41:43] he's going to take you now not just from
[41:46] the penalty of the power but from the
[41:47] very presence of it so that's when you
[41:50] go you are totally free and that is the
[41:54] state of total Deliverance amen is that
[41:58] right praise the Lord so that's what
[42:00] we're talking about amen hallelujah
[42:03] praise the name of the Lord Jesus what a
[42:04] wonderful day for you and what a
[42:06] wonderful time for me amen that this
[42:08] word has come and the word has open our
[42:11] eyes of our heart and of our mind so we
[42:14] can recognize what God is actually doing
[42:17] Hallelujah remember when I was a boy I
[42:20] always wanted why doesn't my father
[42:23] comes home on Friday afternoon and he
[42:26] gots PID
[42:27] I don't see you know he should be
[42:29] bringing home a nice bag of
[42:34] chocolates poor man have a family can
[42:36] take care
[42:38] of you don't know nothing about that
[42:41] yet he has to focus on his family but
[42:44] you're a kid all you're thinking about
[42:46] is getting
[42:47] chocolates and and stuff of that nature
[42:50] is that right and that's the same way
[42:52] with us until God opened our eyes and we
[42:55] start to become really responsible
[42:58] Christians and we start to recognize oh
[43:03] that's why he couldn't spend his money
[43:04] on those
[43:06] chocolates right cuz now you you're not
[43:09] going to just spend your money on
[43:11] chocolates so the old folks says don't
[43:14] worry you're
[43:16] coming later on you're going to find
[43:20] out and then you're going to understand
[43:22] but even though I try to explain it to
[43:24] you now you might not understand but
[43:25] when you actually get the situ situation
[43:27] you I will have to tell you nothing you
[43:29] going to absolutely know what it is all
[43:32] about and that's what the Holy Spirit
[43:34] wants us to know amen see now watch this

[45:15] he's my mother my father my sister and
[45:18] my brother he's everything to you are
[45:22] born of the spirit amen not born of your
[45:26] mother born of the spirit praise the
[45:30] Lord you are a son or daughter of the
[45:35] spirit and Sons and Daughters of God are
[45:38] led by the spirit Hallelujah because
[45:43] that's where what he becomes your guide
[45:45] your teacher just like your mother your
[45:46] father did Prophet preach that in
[45:49] leadership they do that naturally for a
[45:51] while but because your your father or
[45:54] your spiritual mother is the holy ghost
[45:56] He said you go let them you go into the
[45:58] hands of your mother your father and
[46:01] then later on you'll end up in the hands
[46:02] of a pastor and then in that state the

[46:32] message
[46:34] um boy that again I was called a lot of
[46:37] names when seventh years the Holy Spirit
[46:40] spoke and says out of the book of Acts I
[46:43] was reading one
[46:45] day Paul asked have you received the
[46:48] Holy
[46:49] Ghost
[46:52] since you
[46:54] believe you remember that was
[46:57] was it the AP one of them asks 19 Acts
[47:00] 19 have you received the Holy Ghost
[47:02] since you believe so it's not the
[47:05] believing but since you believe but then
[47:09] of course the Holy Spirit asked me that
[47:11] question so that I needed to know that I
[47:14] didn't have the Holy Ghost on the
[47:15] Pentecost he said have you received the
[47:17] Holy Ghost since you believe this
[47:19] message amen that's right that's how you
[47:21] ask the question have you received the
[47:23] Holy since you believe this message amen
[47:27] not that mother Pentecost thing amen but
[47:30] the spirit of God that will travel
