He says what we need today is a fresh pouring out of the Holy Spirit upon our hearts. That's humble. He said, "We need a real Christmas, a birthplace." If you could realize that you're nothing but a stable. Nothing but a stable. [snorts] God didn't go to Jerusalem, to Shiloh, to Ramadillion, [music] all those places. He said they were they were the high places in in Jerusalem. He said he didn't go there. He went to Bethlehem. [music] He said he he came to a stable that was polluted. When you let God become and you realize yourself is [music] nothing but a stinking stable and you open your doors when these great places and ends are turning him away. Open your doors of your manger of your heart and let Jehovah come into that and watch what takes place for he is the word. He said if you abide in me and my word abide in you, he is the word. Let him come into you and watch what takes place. Then ask what you will and it shall be done e flat. And so let your word be [music] born in the manger of my heart. [music] Let it live in me. that it's time live inside [music] this house of clay and mold it every day. [music] That's your word [music] in the [singing] manger. It was a time to stay [music] on or beaten and warm hardly [music] a place for a king to be born. He didn't do something [music] special to reveal his majesty. [music] So I know he gave control. He'll be born in [music] me. So let your word be born [music] in the manger of my heart. Let it live in me. Let it [music] stop. Oh live inside this house of clay. [music] I know it every day that your word [music] be [singing] born in the mure of [music] my life while I'm well outwardly [music] not much to behold unlikely the place [music] for his word to unfold. But if you just [music] heal this vessel and let him have his way from glory [music] on to glory, he'll change me day by day. Oh, let your [music] word be born in the manger of my heart. [music] Let it live in me. Let it s [music] live inside this house of clay [music] and mold it every day. [singing] Let your world be born in the manger. [music] Live inside this house of clay and mold it [music] every day. [singing] Let your word be born in the manger. [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

Amen. and raised this standard. you know, from one moment uh having to be in the hospital and they had detected that uh you know that there some sort of a virus had attacked her and was attacking her even in her brain and um that they had prepared they were doing tests and they had prepared uh and had a an ambulance helicopter on standby there at the hospital waiting um you know based on the results that because if it had hit a certain percentage of the viral infection, she would have had to been rushed uh immediately to uh Toronto um Western. But the results came back and they came back miraculously. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just in a short period of time, God came on the scene and so um the situation was uh completely uh changed in a moment and so she's back home with the family. continue to keep her in prayer. Uh continue to remember Sister Deborah as she continues to heal. Amen. Um we we believe in the power of God to heal and restore &gt;&gt; perfectly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So, let's just keep believing and let's keep under expectation. Glory to God. And so, um, we're just going to, uh, watch a quick video as an introduction video to, um, our Christmas service today. You may be seated. Sorry to keep you standing, but you'll be seated for a while now anyway. Amen. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [music] [music] [music] [music] Heat. Heat. N. [music] Amen. Let's all stand and read the word of God. Today we're going to be looking at the power to become. Amen. And then you can you can add to that uh many different aspects um of to become we know ultimately we are sons and daughters of God but we have the power we've been given the power to become overcomers. We've been given the power to become uh you know mediators, testimonies to the world and especially at a time like this at Christmas. Amen. Glory to God. And so this is the season of Christmas and it invites us to prepare our hearts. Amen. For the wonder of the coming of the Lord. Amen. This is what Christmas was uh is based on the coming of the Lord. Amen. God becoming flesh to dwell among us. Amen. So that we in turn may become children of God, sons and daughters of the king, transformed, redeemed by the word and by his grace. Amen. Now, we all know that December is not actually the time of his birth. Amen. His birth was in in the spring. Amen. Praise God. That's when shepherds are in the fields &gt;&gt; with their sheep. They're not there in the in the middle of winter. Amen. And so we we know that, but that's irrelevant because we recognize Christmas as something that we experience and we celebrate every day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because Christmas is to worship Christ. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Glenn. Welcome back, brother. Amen. You're looking good. You're looking all healthy and strong. Praise God. Let's read the word of God. Scripture is from St. John 1:es 10-14. It says he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not. He came unto his own and his own received him not. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become &gt;&gt; the sons of God. Even to them that believe on his name, which were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us. And we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the father, full of grace and truth. &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Father, Lord, we realize this time of year is a time where the world kind of comes into a focus of recognizing you, Lord. But in the ways of tradition, in the ways of of uh Lord doing things commercially and and uh Lord making it a time where it's just mostly about parties and about the giving of gifts to one another. But Lord, the greatest gift that that man could have ever received, Lord, we seem to uh put it aside and, you know, not give it the glory and the victory and the and the uh praise that that it deserves, Father, the gift of your life coming for your children. And Lord, we ask that you would just take control of the service now. Bless your people, Lord. Let this uh service be um a time of of uh looking within ourselves and searching within our hearts and really uh understanding the purpose and the meaning of Christmas. Lord, may it become a greater reality to us as we feed and as we uh uh ponder upon your word. Grant it we pray. Father take control speaker and hearers in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen and amen. God bless you. May be seated. Glory to God. Amen. The scripture says he was in the world. It's so incredible. God became man. Word became flesh. Eternal became time bound. Imagine God the creator became created in human form. It describes perhaps the greatest downward movement ever conceived where God would condescend from his self-existence from his spirit to where he would condescend to become and to be with man. Amen. Glory to God. Not just to be a baby, to be a single cell planted inside a young woman's body, but to become God, the word made flesh so that he could make a way back for his children to be restored back to their rightful positions as sons and daughters of God. Amen. Glory to God. There's an unspeakable mystery here that we all recognize that we all, you know, when we sing it in the song, veiled in flesh, the Godhead see. Oh, the incarnate deity pleased as man with men to dwell. Jesus, our Emmanuel. Amen. Praise God. It's a song that's sung every day at Christmas, you know, at Christmas time. Emmanuel. Emmanuel, but do they understand the mystery? You know, when we read here from from St. John, we see here that um you know that he doesn't he doesn't uh bring the scripture in the same way that it's you know that that we hear it in Luke and and um you know, Mark and Matthew where it describes all the events and how the angel came to the Virgin Mary and everything else. John just goes right to the point because John had a revelation of the mystery. You know, that's why John was different than the rest of the disciples. Amen. He had a a a a spirit of revelation upon him to recognize that the word was more than what the people had been reading about. &gt;&gt; You know, he says he says here that he was in the world. He He's like he's proclaiming, listen, this is God. God had come down and he was in the world. Amen. And and the world was actually made by him. Glory to God. It's what a tremendous revelation to know, you know, that what like what what the true meaning of Christ is, the true meaning of Christmas, the the the real uh significance that's that's taken a hold of our lives to the point where now we we live for him. We seek him. We we we talk about him. We can't we can't fellowship about the things of the world for too long. We have to bring him into the fellowship. Amen. Glory to God. He came to his own and his own received him not. But as many as received him, he gave the power. What power? The power of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to read a quote here from uh Christ is the mystery of God revealed because John had a tremendous understanding on the word of God. And we thank God that the Lord has sent us a prophet in our day. Amen. That would give us light upon the word of God and allow us to have that same spirit of revelation. Here he says the first thing was that God wanted to reveal himself to the people. He couldn't do it as the great Jehovah God who covered all space, time, and eternity. He could not. He is too great to ever be revealed to people because it would be too mysterious. How could that great being that never did begin? Amen. That that after you went beyond the cycle of a hundreds of billions and trillions and trillions of years of light space and on on out into the infinite into the eternity. and a great creature that was all that and still is. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Next slide. But but what he wanted to do, he loved fatherhood. &gt;&gt; For he was a father. &gt;&gt; And the only way that he could express it was to become a son of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. He had to take on human flesh. He had to come and be one of us so that we could be one of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. That's the reason Jesus kept saying the son of man. &gt;&gt; They did see they didn't know what he was talking about many of them. But now you get it. &gt;&gt; Congregation says &gt;&gt; amen. See he wanted to express himself. That was his one and his great three. One of his great threefold purposes was to express himself identify himself with human beings. &gt;&gt; To reveal himself in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we know that you know the prophet went on to say that you know that that that was you know one aspect of his three-fold purpose because he was God above us and then he was God with us &gt;&gt; and now he's God in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he wants he wants to be in us for one purpose. So that we might have the preeminence. So that he might have the preeminence in our lives. So that we can be the true meaning of Christmas. &gt;&gt; So that we can express the reality of Christmas. so that we can be living testimonies of what it is to to know and to understand what Christmas really is all about. In verse 10, it says, "The world did not recognize him." But you know, it's not surprising that the world did not recognize him. He could have chose
