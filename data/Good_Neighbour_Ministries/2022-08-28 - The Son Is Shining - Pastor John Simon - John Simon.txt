thy power and thy glory so as i have seen thee in the sanctuary because thy loving kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee thus will i bless thee while i live i will lift up my hands in thy name my soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips when i remember thee upon my bed and meditate on thee in the night watches because thou has been my help therefore in the shadow of thy wings will i rejoice my soul follow it hard after thee thy right hand upon me but those that seek my soul to destroy it shall go into the lower parts of the earth they shall fall by the sword they shall be a portion for foxes but the king shall rejoice in god everyone that sweared by him shall glory but the mouth of them that seek lies shall be

tom sister sharon are here with us some uh foundational members that unbelievers that have been with us for a long time and thank god their faith still holds amen miss the storms of life hallelujah as i said as i was coming in to brother corey i said brother corey you know the believer may stand on a rock they may slip and slide on the slime that's on the rock but they're still on the rock so we thank god for a steadfast faith in the word of god for this day and for this hour we will not shrink we will not be ashamed in any way fashion or form we won't swerve any way but we'll stand firmly until the crown in heaven regain we thank god that we have these promises in the word of god welcome brother tom welcome to see sharon praise the lord i'd like to ask him to come give us testimony praise the lord just whatever lord lays in your heart huh that's okay fine okay don't want to put anyone in a spot if god give him something then he'll say it but this is the way it is um i'll tell you the honest truth that's that's the way it was some if the preacher had nothing to preach that sunday he'd not be ashamed he just come and say well brethren i i i don't feel inspired i don't have anything to say uh this sunday is there someone here that the holy spirit anoints maybe a strange brother will step through the door and come and bring the word right or god may drop on a believer that you didn't suspect or expect right so so look we're coming all back to these things because we're going back to the original he preached what paul preached and in the atmosphere in which paul preached it and so that's why i i'm saying to you we don't really have to do anything we are like ruth now waiting for the boss to break out among us that's that's what we're doing we're keeping faithful to the world and we're waiting for the hour we come through the years of recognizing we come through the years of hearing first recognizing all of a sudden we start to recognize what we were hearing and now is the hour when the holy spirit is going to move on the believers to act on the word and that's the reason why the last message was a lot of believers of this message are acting prematurely trying to bring another pentecost by their own efforts which is good it's it's it's human that we feel that way but that is not what it is what it is is he himself coming back and moving on the believers hallelujah and breaking forth amongst them to fulfill his own word and we thank god and praise him in this hour that we are living in the midst of something that's going on something supernatural it's not natural it's not even human it's a it's a glory and presence of almighty god strengthen our souls with the glory divine thank god hallelujah i'm glad i'm in the midst of this and i'm one of them i'm glad i'm one of them i don't know boy but sister brother but something striking my soul when i open this word when i talk about the word something real gets a hold of me not something man made hallelujah look we have an internet uh service going on right now they are uploading it while i'm speaking but we are not here to make just an internet presentation we have no church program we are not trying to present something to you to make you join our church or to join us we are bringing this world that you may have the unfailing reality of recognizing jesus christ in the ever-present hour in which we are in and it's reals more real than what you see with your eyes which will pass away hallelujah but he this great one will live forever praise god hallelujah praise god forever i i like to try to sing a song and i say try because i don't know if uh i i will have the voice you know to do it not that i can't sing but uh i'm still trusting god in the simplicity of this just think about it and think other words i thought about this this morning and i thought i'd like to sing it i was weak and weary i was weak and weary i had gone astray walking in the darkness i couldn't find my way then a light came shining to lead me from despair all my sins forgiven and i was free from care i found the answer i've learned to pray join me if you knew it i walking in the darkness with faith to guide my way the sun is shining on me today i found the answer i learned to pray [Music] forgive me if i try to sing at the same time try to cry but i thank god for the holy spirit of the living god that but we have found the answer we have found that christ is the answer to all our longings all the hungers every desire in our heart christ is the answer within our heart thank god hallelujah praise god forevermore let me read the scripture and formally begin to preach amen genesis 1 14 to 18 followed up by romans 8 11. let us read together you'll find that it's up on the screen behind me and we'll read out of the word of god just before we read we thank god for fresh bread from heaven and we ask that the holy spirit will anoint it to our hearts father not that we have not heard or read these things before but lord we never want to take the word of god uh or ordinarily but that this word is now to us the living word is the word that lives again oh spirit of almighty god anointed to our hearts bring forth its truths bring forth its gems oh god and place them within our hearts that we might grow in grace in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ to your glory and honor in jesus name amen praise god hallelujah now let us read and god said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and it was so and the god made two great lights the greater light to rule the day the lesser light to rule the night and he made the stars also and god set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness and god saw that it was good and evening and the morning were the fourth day praise god bright time oh praise his name now romans 8 11 says to us but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that already dwelt in you we thank god for the great precious word of god hallelujah amen god bless you just please be seated hallelujah now i'm speaking here today on the sun is shining on the seeds today now quoting the prophet of god now at the rising of the sun when the world lay in utter darkness that was back then but we know about now when the entire earth lies in spiritual darkness and the people know not god that there's even one god they've been blinded by every form every tradition that they've placed on the earth here because remember satan start with his lies his rumors and his propaganda machine uh through spreading it out through all his lying angels to blacken as the prophet said in taking sides with jesus to blacken the name of jesus darken the name of god and to diminish it from the minds of the people and to establish his lies as the truth but notice here see now it the world was without form it was void it was all covered with water and was laying there dark dismal gloomy see oh my but then the spirit of god moved upon that see oh and then said let there be light amen hallelujah now god had a reason to do that for that light to come for down beneath that water there there were seeds them seeds were already planted but they were waiting they had to have that sunlight to come to life lord of god you i've just go quickly remember how dr pember uh uh spoke of the fact that there was some chaotic uh events took place because when satan was cast down after he come and started civilization there and all the filth and evil from that god just destroyed the whole thing and the bible begins how the world was without form and void but in the beginning it was not so god had a perfect earth in that first verse but after that the in between there came that time of evil sin and corruption and god put an end to it and we ended up with an earth that was oak form and void but there were trees and seeds already and when that destruction came they just got buried in the dirt buried under the earth covered with water covered with every form of junk just like you and i covered up with all kinds of stuff from in the world covered up by sin covered up by evil filth mud everything else but then god spoke let there be light hallelujah [Applause] and the light came shining thank god it's shining on me today because i found the answer i've learned to pray upon the answer in jesus christ hallelujah amen amen praise god hallelujah yes sir so we find out that them seeds were he had them seeds that were already planted but they had to have that sunlight to make them live oh praise god you've got to have sunlight you've got to have the light of the son of god shining upon you for you to live again i don't care how many layers of dirt how many layers of evil mud is around you how much you're covered up by satan's lies and junk tell the woman oh you're a witch but it took a prophet to come and stand before says you were no rich thus saith the lord oh praise god you're a daughter of god hallelujah it's the same spirit spoke through the prophet with the spoken word the original seed telling you and i you are not what the world says you are you are not who the your mother and your father tells you you are you are not whom your school teacher tells you that you are you're not who society tells you you are you are who i tell you that you are amen and you're gonna be what i already said you're going to be because everything you're going to be is already in you hallelujah praise god and i'm going to use the revelation the light of the word of god to strike that and bring it to life again to produce after its kind that it might bring forth what i have ordained oh praise god forevermore hallelujah or do you believe that oh my praise god amen now remember that first light was that was ever given on the earth was really god's spoken word for god said let there be light hallelujah so the first light the original light is god's spoken word never mind man messing with electricity messing with this kind of new power and everything else like that it's good that's for the human realm and they want to use that but the real original life is god spoken word amen hallelujah praise god see god's spoken word said let there be light and there was light and it turned darkness into light hallelujah in order to bring forth a creation of joy upon the earth the spirit of god moved over that with love and compassion at that day at the dawn of that creation upon the earth oh my the sun rose and swept its rays and dried up the waters and made an atmosphere for the first time and it was the purpose of that was to bring joy and life to the earth by a seed he's talking about jesus his body already laying in the earth the seed already laying in the earth and the whole world will have joy and peace by that sun oh it was nothing in other words that was nothing that sunrise like nothing to that sunrise that we had on easter morning can you say amen hallelujah for when the sun natural sun leapt into the skies it brought forth a greater sun's rise than it ever had because it became greater news with this sunrise than it did with the first one this sunrise brought news that he is risen the original seed praise god is quickened now from the dead something new is beginning now a new creation is coming forth this one is being quickened from the original seed hallelujah brother branham said every or every oak tree that you have now came from the first seed of the first oak that was buried now spiritually take that and see this first original seed that the s-o-n has raised up the s-u-n rose the first one now the s the s-u-n rose the first one now the s-o-n raises up this one and it raised him up at calvary hallelujah and brought him forth that he could multiply and cause the whole lord to be covered with oak trees now he's caused the whole earth to be covered with the vines from off his his original seed hallelujah oh praise god hallelujah listen don't don't don't tell me to hold your peace and calm down or be a little more structured that you know don't let your disciples carry on like this this is not going to be real church real church supposed to be orderly and decent and proper presentation techniques and uh you know and so on like that but that's wonderful and i know all about that but the point is here the spirit of god striking the soul amen the spirit of god striking the gene that is within us we can't help it we've got to respond why the deep calls to the deep and the deep must respond praise god lord god hallelujah amen yes sir he is risen from the dead now we know the first son was bringing a message that there would be life mortal life come on the earth hallelujah why would god put the sun if life wasn't going to come forth afterwards but the sons the news if you could understand it was the sign that he was going to create life on the earth after that praise god but this time when this sun rose there was a jewel sun rising another s o another s o n was riding rising not only a s-u-n rising but now it was the s-o-n rising hola hallelujah and this one was not to bring like natural life but he was risen to bring eternal life to all of god's promised seed that by far knowledge he had seen lying in the earth not in the dirt but in the earth god had promised seeds already laying in the earth what were they waiting for for the sunrise hallelujah but i'm not talking just about the sunrise then but when the sun will rise on you and i by the opening of this word and the light comes out of the world and shines upon your heart upon your life and brings understanding and wisdom and knowledge take god hallelujah i'm so glad are greater than solomon is here i'm so glad that jesus christ is the mighty god the everlasting one and that comes from the mighty council law amen hallelujah amen you see that light came today when sons of god is upon the earth it takes this s o and light to bring them to life then to life his chosen ones to life amen that he knew before the foundation of the world he had chosen them in himself before the foundation of the world you believe that praise god you believe that a part of god is in us you believe the significance of those tongues of fire over the apostles was god trying to show that the mortalized could see recognize and understand what he was doing that he was breaking himself up as the pillar of fire and putting pieces of himself in these little ones hallelujah signifying that he was in them now and that they were not walking alone but the father that was walking in them they can say i and my father are one it's the father that dwelleth in me doing the works hallelujah oh praise god remember look i'll go to that later because the seeds were in some dirt i don't care what color clay you're in my god when the holy spirit and that seed of god lies in the dirt hallelujah god brings that seed to life hallelujah i'm praising god for his great spirit that is in us amen hallelujah oh my now if the spirit at risk romans 8 11 if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you hallelujah now remember like the seed that laid upon the earth the one that had life in them many of them were already rotten seeds amen the waters and things burnt them up this takes me to another quotation when he says you see it's not the seed of god what happens is that that water instead of making that seed grow mature and so on it starts to rot it says right there by the water the very waters that's supposed to give it life stats are rotten right inside of this message that's supposed to quicken and bring them to life hallelujah the waters of it rottens them and they become dead seeds rotten by what they can't comprehend or understand see oh my but my no rotten seeds waters and things burnt them out but you know there was a seed laying there that was ready for life and god no it was laying there and them predestinated ones are are the first to be quickened by the holy spirit for the holy spirit came back to claim his own praise god he didn't come to claim some other person or whatsoever he knew his children like that all that all eagle flying over the barnyard she already knew her own all she wanted to do was pass over that barnyard and let all the screams so that they would recognize the voice that was calling to them hallelujah oh my i'm so glad i recognized that voice i'm glad you recognized that voice there's a voice calling me right off that old rugged tree i hear the call i feel the pull oh praise god and it's taken me right into glory amen hallelujah now this is deep now i hope you catch what i'm this good what oh my not all men who you see the sun was sent across the earth listen not to bring rocks to life not to bring the dark to life it was not to do that but was to bring the part of the dirt enclosed around a life the dirt enclosed around a seed amen a jersey germ an attribute not all men then will receive christ oh what a statement i thought the bible says whosoever will may come i taught whoever wants to just run up to the altar like that but you see what we did not understand is that god already knew he's elected and like a fisherman all kinds of fish will come in your net but it's only the ones you select or elect are the ones that you're gonna use all the rest have to go out and according to the pattern it's not that all are crabs and snakes and spiders not all are bad he said the good ones is the same pattern like this other one that's to make the dress but this is what i choose to make the dress it's just that this one is not within the confines of the pattern so we got to praise god that it shows us that we are one in a million oh my praise god forevermore that you were brought in by his grace [Applause] it's not that he loved you more than he loved the other person like god like the prophet of god said it's not that abraham was any better than any of those babylonians that were back there but god in his poor knowledge already elected and selected him unconditional covenant no conditions on it no works on it oh i got to get these virtues i i got to i got to try and live holy i i have got to develop this i got to develop that i got to develop that but when we see how it's unveiled to us that every potential that you need and will manifest through you god already had placed it in the sea and now we are here to work out our salvation with fear and trembling let go and let god have this wonderful way let him manifest himself let him bring his word to life amen oh my so the son was sent across the earth not to bring rocks which was also dirt to life see but to bring that dirt which was enclosed around the life not all men will receive christ but those which god had for ordained to life and that maybe house the wrong some of the dirt of the earth see oh my that's the one he comes to quicken i mean they're the ones he comes to quicken now that the dark real dirt will lay in the same sun amen just like you it will come to church it will lay in the sun but that dirt will say oh my god that old sun is so hot that sun is so hot this kind of preaching i can't understand i can't take this this is too hot right he said and them rocks will say oh that old sun is so hot he's preaching all the way from beyond before genesis before the foundation he's preaching about what happened after the foundations and he's preaching now of what's going to happen all the way up into eternity this is too hot for me i can't take this at all that old rock will say the sun is so hot but the little seed when the sun strikes it that seed begins to say oh that's what i'm looking for oh hallelujah praise god that's what i'm looking for oh i need that heat so i can germinate i'm i need the heat so i can bring forth after his kind o praise god so i can be more like him praise god forevermore i need that he to do that praise god see that's why you must understand that that seed from the heat it will spring forth to life it quickens because it's quickened from that part of the earth amen oh praise god because the sun was sent not to quicken their rocks not to quicken their dirt but to quicken the life of the seed that was in the dirt amen praise god you just happen to be in the body that you're in is that right you asked to be in a white body you asked to be in a pink body a brown body a yellow body or a black body or whatever body you didn't have to be it and how can i criticize god's creation how can i criticize anything god made a way he made it we made this flower this color and they had one color he got a purpose we don't worry about such things we broke through that kind of some barrier we're in the word of god the power of the holy spirit amen praise god hallelujah oh for the real message is to the believer not to them that perish it's foolishness to them but to them that are in christ that's a part of that seed it's life it's life praise god hallelujah aren't you glad that this is more than life to you i'm so glad this is more than life to me and i can't live without this because this is what god is showing me and god has given to my soul and i'm thankful to him for it praise god forevermore amen you know it's wonderful when the sun comes up just a few things i scribble here what the sun does is drives away the darkness amen and all of us were in darkness and we know when the sun came up and started shining on us when this revelation broke maybe it broke only with a little peep of light you know wake up early in the morning and the sun comes up so nice and gentle but it's coming up it's coming up before middle of the day it gets real hot hey man and then you're gonna know if you're a real seed because the real heat of the sun is now beaten down on you hallelujah and then you're going to know if you're a real seed but i thank god it drives the darkness away from us hallelujah amen book of acts what was it doing it was driving the darkness away from them you remember i've preached on it road to ms how them apostles they were even following jesus already is that right you're done following the message and they were even saying if they believe and there wasn't there but the point is that uh here it is they're going back discouraged because their prophet is dead and um out of the bushes steps a man and this man begins to tell them things taken from the scripture from the beginning and bringing it right down and showing them christ revealed in his own word oh praise god so that we find out he was driving the darkness away from them hallelujah on uh paul hallelujah when they come up there and the light struck paul and he fall from his heart it was driving the jewish traditions of darkness out of him knocking away all the darkness which he thought was light he was driving it away from him that he could see the real light of god that was shining upon his heart hallelujah there was one called cornelius and he was a man's sincere seeking god praying and fasting and grow walking in the light of the word and god sent peter to him oh my and there god used his spoken word through the mouth of a preacher to drive away roman doctrinal darkness away from him and that god still is alive here today to drive away paige and darkness trinitarian darkness all kinds of false baptisms all kinds of false titles and false things away from the minds of the people and to rip the veil once again that they can see the living risen christ who lives forevermore amen praise god hallelujah i'm so thankful he's the same yesterday today and forever second thing that the what the sun does when it rises up it dramatizes whatever seeds are hidden beneath the dirt doesn't matter what concrete is on that that that wonderful seed it will break through everything and come to its fullness of its life because it was predestinated to bring forth after its kind hallelujah no one of the holy spirit asked me many years ago whose kind are you going to be go read genesis 11 every seed must bring forth after it's kind who you're going to be his or mine this one no i'm going to be yours lord i'm going to be yours lord hallelujah and stay with the word of god through thick sin criticism everything else brother sister doesn't matter amen that's for his glory and for his own you see when you really caught something let me turn it the other way when something has really caught you oh my he will not let you go because you have become a prisoner amen paul said look even my own heart want to condemn me and i want to do this i can't even do it anymore i'd want to do that i can't do what i like anymore there's something inside of me telling me that that's not right that's wrong this that that and then directing me and moving me in different directions what is that it's the power of the holy spirit within the si the child's heart amen oh praise god forgive me sometimes because i'm on the brink of speaking in tongues and i'm just asking the holy spirit just to hold me back praise god forevermore oh my praise god those floodwaters that cover the earth when they're receded with the sun drying them up then the seeds begin to be able to dermatize and begin to come to life amen praise god so i thank god for this real sunrise that we are having amen the sun is still rising it's it's rising it's still shining it's going higher and higher and higher and then all of a sudden we're going to leave here and go to a land where there is no night there oh thanks be to god hallelujah amen laying there all these years we were waiting for the sun to rise amen but god sent a prophet to say like the young man you know the young slave that the prophet said on emancipation day he climbed on the very highest point of the barn he didn't want to wait down at the bottom and the moment the sun came up and he could see it peeping he said we're free we're free hallelujah the sun is coming up we are free that's what the prophet did for us of brother that could climb a bit higher to tell us oh the sun is out it is the rising of the sun come out to your prison doors come out your sickness come out of your pain come over your trials come out of your tribulation come under your crippled nonsense that you're in come out of your false doctrines back to the lord the sun is shining upon the seeds of god here today may it shine upon you wherever you are across the world where you will hear this oh you say oh that's a nothing church that's a nobody that's fine it's not nothing to do with me it's nothing to do with me i'm not even trying to to gain more numbers and subscriptions i'm not uh interested in whether it goes up it goes down cross way sideways all i'm interested in and we are interested is to get this word of god out that the last one may come in i don't care where they're buried if they're in china in your africa wherever you are islands of the sea let the spirit of god call his children let the spirit pull his own back to the word back to the presence of almighty god hallelujah amen praise god remember when that sun began to shine on that seed that that the sun didn't give the seed life you got me the sun didn't come to now make the seed get born again the sun did not come to make that seed yet saved but god has already predestinated that seed with the power to transform itself within the seed when the sun struck the seed the sin comes to life amen manifesting the life amen praise god for the life was already in the seed was just waiting for the s-o-n light to shine upon it hallelujah it was just waiting to start to manifest first that it was a son or daughter of god it was there to grow and to walk into its own maturity hallelujah uh as i have always said we are not in a a faith that puts us on the spiritual regimentation is that right we are walking completely free because your freedom is not my freedom and the other person's free because god will let me do this someone let you might let that person do something that you just wouldn't let me uh you see so you that's why paul said don't judge yourselves among yourselves because there's no comparison god is a god is he's a greater genius than anything you could think of he did not make two things the same with all the billions and billions of things he made no two things are the same is that right oh no god every one he makes is a masterpiece hallelujah i mean they might say oh you're a little too tall you're a little too thin you got too much weight you you too short oh i'm a masterpiece i don't care what you call me because i am made to fit somewhere in that building that no other stone can fit i got a job to do that nobody else can do i have a a will a purpose to perform that nobody else can do it because i'm sit down here you are sat down here with god's divine purpose to fulfill his word hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord god hallelujah amen yes sir what a time amen to think that god would brought bring us to life amen that we might be sons and daughters of god is that what john 1 1. he gave them they come down here in them with power already to become the sons of god right become don't mean now that you go now you're going to emerge to be a son from being a rock no but you now have the power you discover all of a sudden you got the power in you now for the holy spirit in you to begin to work in you and to bring out who you really are amen now that's why we know that we will not really know each other paul said you'll know each other you'll be known at that time when we don't see through a glass no more darkly amen but we will know as we are known as you're known of god you will know now of your brethren because they'll really see the real you amen as i've illustrated for all the years you've seen this flesh on the outside but you've never seen the real me but you'll see me in all my glory on the resurrection morning hallelujah when we are all transformed by the grace of god there is no old person walking like this no more hallelujah there is no more headaches there's no more this there's no more uh what you call it where they say that cramps and and things of that nature why all blindness darkness deafness have passed away all grief all sorrow all sadness passed away no more tears there you don't have those things anymore because you're living in the land of eternal joy you're in the presence of the living god where such things can't exist oh praise god forevermore hallelujah hallelujah oh my i take this is about the time friends that you almost want to jump right into glory i mean you want to shout yourself in him let me quote brother branham i think if someone could get this that bumps right into that at once amen if they could understand it it would send them right into eternity wow it's a rapturing thing going on oh they never knew it but if they break through things that we are seeing and begin to know and understand it will all bounce you one time you want to get a bounce from this i tell you brother sister it bumps you right into glory in the presence of god you know he says that woman that man that boy and girl will just probably lift up their hands and say let's go lord jesus let's go let's go lord let's go hallelujah amen how wonderful to know it praise god now i have a lot of things to say but not because i have to say i mean i'm going to say it all now i'll stop when the holy spirit feel lets me stop right that doesn't mean i'm going to go on until midnight or hours but i'll stop when i feel that i need to stop for the glory of god hallelujah now we're going to talk a little bit about moses here is that okay amen praise the name of the lord oh my how wonderful now remember in him there this is why christ speak in him there was the god of abraham in a light a pillar of fire back in a bush that fire had waves like going out from it but it did not seem to bother the bush the fire was in the bush but it didn't bother the bush oh my and the voice of the scripture the voice of god spoke through there and said i have chosen you amen praise god hallelujah oh my it's not wonderful what you heard is that this scripture has a voice is that right and actually it's gone through the cycle and the word has become flesh and this flesh that through this uh elected predestinated flesh the scripture can go back to having a voice having words coming through vessels that he predestinated for that purpose amen oh praise god now see then so it's that voice in the scripture that spoke to moses amen and said i have chosen you and i want to say to you i believe it's that same voice spoke to us hallelujah because we saw it lined up with the scripture but there was something calling us and we recognize that it's the voice of the scripture hallelujah amen praise god and the voice of the scriptures is none other than what we call the seven thunders for that's the voice of god that's the voice of the mighty angel when he shouted amen seven thunders out of their voices we know the seven voices of the seven spirits of god is one voice of the one living god when you put all the messengers and put their voices together their message together it's the message of god it's the voice of god amen coming to us in this hour in this time hallelujah and that voice spoke to us and we realized that we we are not just creatures of time we didn't just come on the earth to sport and enjoy and to party and to drink and dance and to wear our shorts on the beach and to jive or or to wear our handgun pants with the crotch touching the road no no sorry we know something was different about us when the spirit takes you back down the halls of your memory you realize you were different from the day you were born but you didn't know why but something struck your soul don't recognize hallelujah you're a child of the king oh praise god you're a son you're a daughter called by the holy ghost amen oh my yes sir praise god oh praise god you had heard the voice of the seven thunders that's a miracle we talked about it like this but let me quote here i have heard now i see and i just try to copy it here so that i can go directly from the page uh praise the lord listen brother branham he's saying about junior jackson just before he's talking about how junior jackson came to his meeting and was telling him about this dream and he talked about how that voice really has a gift that god uses with dreams so he's saying here that boy is a dreamer and i seen his dreams and i know that they are true see oh my and then he was saying to me on that last night of your meetings i was speaking and you were speaking and praying for the sick and then suddenly i said something's fixing to happen and when i said that it was like a clap of thunder oh my and some people began running oh my when this revelation really broke and breaks to the people that are around you that are evil in the message some of them gonna run away from you they literally run because they don't know what is this terrifying sound that they're hearing coming forth the people began screaming running and as the thunder but listen listen i want you to listen this close he said but now then that thunder see begin once that thunder begins to seem to go away then it began to make a voice see and it began speaking wow the seven thunders are speaking now they're not just making the sound and everybody can say oh the seven thunders oh the thunders oh the thunders oh yes my but the thunders began speaking hallelujah and that speaking was going on and on and it was coming true lattices windows that were up there praise god speak to one here one there one there one over there one over there praise god and of course i just showed the hint over to you in solomon one when he said he was speaking to his beloved through the lattice work amen these thunders began speaking and they were hearing it coming through the letters work and it's coming to every individual as the word begin to make itself known hallelujah oh my and then it formed the light like you see in the picture that is even now above the audience here but i said it but it said something it was still rumbling off somewhere and i stood still and said that is jehovah god the prophet is gone the thunders are still speaking that's why uh wednesday night when i said he said oh i wish i could be here i i would have loved to be here but he can't be here but that doesn't mean the voice stops speaking it's still speaking today hallelujah but it's gone from well one member is gone into a man remembered body it's gone into a bright form it's moved from elijah these are the days of elisha amen praise god the holy spirit speaking through his beloved bride in this day and in this hour praise the lord hallelujah thanks be to god so here we see it that voice of the scripture speaking to moses amen and that same voice now speaking to us amen hallelujah because we are chosen to fulfill the word if you fulfill if you read the scripture further it tells you there because he needs somebody to go and fulfill that 400 year old promise he gave to israel so you were chosen for that purpose that you might be the one that i will use to go to fulfill that purpose but that is that day but in this day god has his chosen ones and his chosen ones is becoming for them to fulfill all righteousness or all the scripture for this hour and for this day for his purposes and for his plan amen oh yes praise god oh my praise god i'm going to stop here because i see i'm going to pull into get pulled into a lot of other things that's going to kick me on and on and on and i believe that we have enough steak to chew on that we can i don't mean the steak is leathery or anything like that but i mean it's enough for you to feed on by the grace of god ah but i thank god just as i started i want to end it as musicians come and this worship leader comes praise the lord i found the answer hallelujah i wandered in the darkness for years hallelujah and i couldn't find my way i tell you all the roots that i took and i took it you say oh this denomination that denomination i just let you know factually that i you know pilgrim holiness seventh day adventists oh my i i i'll be talking maybe in a month's time when he gets back to a gentleman that i went uh and met him was talking to him because he he can sew he can do things and um while we are there talking you know i suddenly get a feeling and so i turned him and said well um i perceive you're some sort of a christian he said yes i'm a believer i'm a christian he says but you know i'm not this pentecostal or anything i i am an adventist but i really don't know if i should even say that that i'm adventurous because i come out because i seen so different things go and i i just can't stand it i just come out and uh right now i'm wondering what to do and this and that and the other i said oh is that right right so we start chatting on a light form and of course you know the spirits pull on him he wants to know more and this and that so let's pray for francisco that the holy spirit will continue to deal with his heart and life for the glory of god god has a way of doing things and he calls his own the day and the hour is up when we just got to take a track and chuck into another person's nose yeah but you remember when brother brown sat in his car and the young man came in the track he says did god lead you and tell you to give me a track and he's saying yes sir and this and that brother branham didn't really answer him but he said see see that's what the denominations have been doing in other words that they're hoping to catch one seed that might entangle it that's what they were giving out all these things for because they're attracted by spiritual things and they they get so many in to get so many in but it's to get those seeds of god that would be in that group to get them all entangled into all kinds of doctrines and dogmas and everything else like that but our eyes have been opened amen but thank be to god the holy spirit is calling he's speaking and this thing is progressing and i'm telling you this is going to break out amen because uh uh i i one quote which i'll get to maybe next time where he says oh when i begin to see this i i feel like repentance i feel like i need a revival i need i need an awakening amen but what is it it's all the sun shining on that seed bringing it to life amen and then what happened that seed now you don't have to go out and prematurely try to make the world do what it says it will do what it says when he chooses for it to do what it says don't act prematurely to open the heavens and close down the heavens and and all these kinds of things the holy spirit will have his own will his own way and his own work and while root is waiting patiently in the field it'll break out amongst her like that say oh but our service we we don't have much life we don't have much bands we don't have this you know you don't have to have that all you need to have is him when you have him in your midst anything can happen is that right any day and now any day now any day now just ordinary like where like that and all of a sudden he can break forth is that right you believe god and trust him with your walk in him and he is able to keep us praise the lord come up brother praise the lord hallelujah i was going to sing the first song i signed we can sing that together i'll tell you until you come around and find your direction it's okay i found the answer amen i think i have

sun is shining for me today i found the answer i learned to pray god bless you god bless you if you don't know the lord come to him if you're a believer walk with him in a hierarchy of the holy spirit
