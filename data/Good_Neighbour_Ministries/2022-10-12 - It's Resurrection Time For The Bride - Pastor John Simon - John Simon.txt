with us bless us and we see it growing every day I I am I feel him growing even in the Revelation and it's coming out in every other way so so God bless his heart amen amen God is good isn't he praise God and we're glad to be in the house of the Lord on this wonderful marvelous night as the message is growing as it's moving as the brain's Revival continues moving from octave to octave and you may not realize it but it's growing but not the way people are thinking they're thinking of some Pentecostal type like of Revival coming like that and it's not like that you'll see it in another way and you'll be so excited it's happening already but you'll see it even getting stronger and stronger until it's so plain that everybody will begin to see it amen you don't have to say anything just live the way God wants you to live bringing glory and praise to his glorious name let's turn to our Bible middle of the week and not being brother Branham I don't have a two-hour sermon or four hours but uh just something simple that we could share and rejoice with each other amen Hallelujah this is our scripture found in the Book of John chapter 2 verses 18 to 21. and it reads then answered the Jews and said unto him what sign showest thou unto us seeing that thou doest these things Jesus answered and said unto them destroyed this Temple and in three days I will raise it up again then said the Jews 14-6 years was this templin building and will thou rear it up in three days but he spake of the Temple of his body amen God bless you father we thank you for the reading of the word share with us your understanding wisdom and Grace and may we grow in your knowledge understanding May the light shine in this last day upon the fruits of the tree in the name of Jesus Christ we ask it amen praise the Lord God bless you please be seated Hallelujah it's Resurrection time again for the bride and I believe it amen but now it's not the resurrection of Jesus it's the resurrection of his bride the head has already been raised up but now the body is being raised up praise the Lord and that's what we want to talk about here tonight listen uh all most of these thoughts come from the restoration of the bright tree amen this tree is a different kind of a tree it goes from place to place it goes from one place to another place from one dispensation to another dispensation from Luther it went to Wesley from Wesley it went to Pentecost and went from Pentecost it will go to the word amen hallelujah he went through justification sanctification baptism Holy Spirit and gifts and then he says from there it goes to their word Hallelujah aren't you glad that tree is going to the word or has gone to the word because we are in the tree right now hallelujah amen therefore it's time for another Resurrection glory to God hallelujah all this never failing word it's Easter again it's Resurrection time again because God's got people there amen hallelujah oh my and it will be Easter Resurrection for them glory to God why because they have risen glory to God have you risen I believe God has Raised Me Up amen raise me up to a different plane Raise Me Up to Heavenly places in Jesus Christ and I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk this narrow way hallelujah praise God forevermore glory to God hallelujah now remember this he came risen from all them Creeds and denominations and come right up travel through them amen right right again for the Royal seed that was hid in The Roots the word hallelujah hid back there he was hit back there in this word amen for years and years and years but now he is being revealed praise God back to the word it went through the entire cycle it went from seed it went through the springtime and so on right through the summer and then we come to the Harvest Time Again by Harvest time it's gone through the cycle back to seed again Hallelujah and I'm glad it's back to the seed word again hallelujah amen you see that I I saw that but you know wasn't as strong upon it but I could see that that the uh from way back but now you see it clearer that everything started with Jesus and went through the resurrection went to everything and then it went to Pentecost and then I found that people were making we should be excited about Pentecost it's a great thing and we should always be happy for Pentecost it's one wonderful but really what the entire cycle is is not bringing it just a Pentecost that's just the trees start growing again it brings it right through the cycle back to the seed from seed to seed from alpha to Omega is that right that's the way God's law of Life uh is that's the way it works so that's how we must see it in the types and in the symbols all praise His wonderful name amen for that word was hit back there thank God aren't you glad you were hidden in the root can't you go back to your roots because you've been healed in the root for years and years and years until this time I spoke of him being revealed but I'm speaking of you now being revealed for she is him revealed praise God in this hour if she is him being revealed the son of man then but the son of man to be revealed again what in the bright form Hallelujah so now it's her that's being revealed to the people as he reveals himself to us then that same word reveals itself through us back to the people again glory to God what a glorious hour and time for us to be alive in hallelujah oh my remember this was on predestinated from the the foundation of the world Hallelujah now amen and thank God this church this bride is Beginnings to stand Hallelujah glory to God he just started seeing glimmers of it glory to God but I'm glad she is not only standing but she is getting ready to take a March into the skies glory god she's listening to the sound of the music moving according to the drum Hallelujah that music that we can hear but they can't hear but thanks be to God the Earth is coming when we'll walk right off the cap of the Hill amen and March into the presence of almighty God hallelujah remember let me say it he says remember page 7 72 of this spoken word The Original Seed restoration of the bright tree God predestinated this in the beginning hallelujah praise God and I'm glad it's time for another Resurrection or I should put it this way another Resurrection is now in progress Glory God hallelujah amen because the head was raised up amen but now a many membered body is being raised up Hallelujah and when the last one is raised up praise God my friends the entire body is ready to go amen hallelujah when that one is raised up not like raised up like he was raised up from the dirt from the ground but raised to be in heaven that places in Jesus Christ amen where you're raised up Paul puts it clearly you're quickened quickened from sins quickened from trespasses creating from darkness and everything else and raised up by the grace of God hallelujah amen yes sir oh we know uh quoting him Jehovah restored that first Perfect Tree in three days after his death amen hallelujah now after the first trees death remember it now He restored that back in three days but now the bright tree is also going to be restored and also it will go through its three stages hallelujah praise God now after them tree the first tree restored as at the beginning now at the end notice now it was only at the end of the third day the end of the first day oh praise God I hope you're getting it at that Thursday is what he meant really you know in speaking as a preacher sometimes you're speaking so fast and you go over your words now he says at the ending of that third day that's when the real manifestation not of Jesus listen what he's saying not of Jesus but of the Christ Hallelujah is being made known again I repeat at the ending of the third day now he just explained to us that that third day his Pentecost and then he says Pentecost is going to end and it's when Pentecost ends that's when the real manifestation of Christ the word amen is going to start moving amongst the people hallelujah praise God Amen a few places when I read I re read this before years years ago I had made a notes here saying prophecy I just put that one word prophecy prophecy praise God hallelujah now all praise God he's going to repeat it because he wants to nail that down that somebody will catch what he is trying to say Amen is wonderful through all the other ages but at the ending of that third day amen hallelujah remember first day dead forms second day still that forms on the third day rumors starting to go around like he's come to coming to life again amen hallelujah there was a rumor going around Hallelujah in that third day which is the dispensation of the Holy Spirit that room must start going around that he was the same yesterday today and forever praise God in other words when those ages like Luther and Wesley and them started to see the gifts manifested and seeing the supernatural taking place among the people he is categorizing that as a rumor starting to go out that that the church is really dead Jesus is not really dead the life is still here Among Us praise God and started going out as a rumor but remember it was at the end of that third day after all them signs after all them wonders after all those wonderful things that is where he himself makes himself known come right among his own people and begin to call out to them and say look at me the word that's not there but I'm putting that in so you understand what he's saying look at me the word amen I am the same one Hallelujah that was at the beginning and here he is now at the end Oh Glory to God Amen you see God allowed them dead forms to go on right until Pentecost came and then the rumors started to go around Hallelujah that he is here again in this last day moving Among Us is also in a nice way without saying us saying it to us telling us that that's good but that was not the word right it's after all of that happened at the end praise God we can go back you know what the end of that third day is end of the Pentecostal dispensation and the Pentecostal dispensation of which he was the messenger which is what a lot of people don't understand that brother Brown's role was twofold he was the one to restore the word right and to be the messenger to that Pentecostal uh age and he there could be no higher manifestation of that than his life is that right but then he was also to be the the what the man who stands in the gap to to point us the way from Pentecost over to the world but once the word come on the scene you will see that coming to the ending of his teaching on the seals he started saying I can't stay any longer I must decrease that he might increase for two of us cannot be on the earth at the same time what one has to go on one says so he had to go and he went like the first Elijah went up in a fiery uh Mercedes uh is that that's not what the Bible says but I'm saying that you might understand for our day it wouldn't be horses it would be in a car and that's he that's how he died in a car crash right that's how he died in a car crash and went to be with the Lord glory to God so we are thankful that all the time simple as you see it coming here every night my brothers and sisters in their Simplicity we're walking dead in line with the scriptures we're walking in line what with what is happening in the scriptures and when we can see that it points back and we see what's happening now what's happening in our day in our time and what's going to happen praise God hallelujah oh praise God Amen yes sir now them dead forms then till it got to Pentecost then the rumor started around that he was back he was here now amen see oh my yes and then it was at the ending of that third third day amen he can't stress it enough praise God he then appeared and began to show all of them his resurrection sign amen what Resurrection sign that he is the same word that was back there raised up again and here Among Us praise God he is the one talking with us you remember when he went with them uh not to go over all this stuff but after his resurrection then he started walking with the disciples and just like the bush the fire that was in the bush in the Book of Genesis came Exodus Genesis Exodus sorry and uh and step one being began to talk with Moses and call Moses now it doesn't say it in the Bible but they said as they were walking on their way to Ms and I've seen that road is bushes on every side and mountains on each side it's easy that that uh the way I see it a stranger stepped out from among the bushes the same Pillar of Fire that was back there talking to Moses from in the bush now steps out in the form of a man out of the ambushes and begin to explain to them the scriptures is that right begins to open up the word and it says he took from Genesis right on down through Moses and everything else and showed to them what is spoke concerning him amen wonderful wonderful wonderful amen so we are thanking God for this hour that he has come again and he is taking us night after night day after day and showing whom himself in the word praise the Lord he's not even pointing us back to his messenger the prophet though we love him though we appreciate him we look up to him we'll ever talk about them and tell you whatever he says and will obey the word of God that comes through him praise God but that now he is pointing to himself he's taking the glory amen hallelujah oh my yes sir before me he says There Were None amen beside me there is none and after me well there will be no other praise God for he is the same yesterday today and forever he is a living and here are the same words he is the same yesterday today and forever and now showing forth what I told you about the tree and when the tree sits by the river the tree starts bearing fruits amen and I showed to you that we are the fruits from that tree of life amen ripening in the sunlight of this hour praise God ripening under the grace of God so now you'll understand when he says this now we see them living fruits of his presence remember now I living fruits he repeats himself living fruits of his presence then he says are you getting it are you really getting it you're getting what I'm saying in other words real living fruits of his presence amen oh my a manifested at the end of the day when he appeared to all of them his church and why when they all get together amen that will be the end of it all praise God hallelujah oh yes he said what is it the evening lights praise God the evening lights have come the Bible said it that it would shame praise God in the last day the evening light in the East Hallelujah the same light that was in the uh I'm struggling because while I'm talking to you something is coming to me and that's why you see I I go back and forth like that amen the same light that was in the east the same light shine uh now shine on that first church and the Romans cut down that tree by their Pagan worship their Pagan worship cut down that tree amen but now the evening light has come again amen and what does it come out for amen it's come out to restore to raise up the evening light the same purpose as the Morning Light amen that tree that was cut down through the Dark Ages through Roman Dogma God is restoring her by shining forth evening light are you getting evening light you get an evening light are you getting it praise God hallelujah oh my oh now he says what is that now it's restoring the whole word of God again bringing the full manifestation of Christ in his church and what was coming to me was it was the evening light but then he starts singing and talking and now the evening lights have come Christ in the church and many membered body a bright body hallelujah amen Shine Your Light in which corner wherever you are you shine it in your corner I'll shine it in my corner unless together shine and represent the word the evening lights have come it is a fact that God and Christ are one the evening lights have come is the fact that Christ and his bride are one a man a man remembered body but yet they're one hallelujah praise God Amen yes sir and he himself used the words right here he says the evening lights according to prophecy amen according to prophecy amen oh yes so here it is now one we see that God is first going to prune off some of them branches that were there he will even allow bugs to eat them up see oh oh my and then you buy get them bound together and then will be the time of waiting waiting to be burned amen I'm not saying all will be burned because some will come to themselves some will recognize and and pull out but this is the time the bride is waiting Amen in love and they are waiting Amen in the same way amen oh praise God hallelujah he says wonderful amen now we see what's happening that it is the fruits on the top of the tree that begins to ripen first you believe that amen hallelujah see why because the evening light in other words he doesn't say it openly but it strikes them first they begin to see the evening light I'm thinking now of when Emancipation Proclamation for the slaves dug in the South he says some of them that were strong enough and young enough they climbed to the top of the highest buildings and they were looking for that sun to come up he sent us the sun soon as the sun came up they began to shout we're free praise God we're free we're not on the law we're on the grace we're not bound we're free praise the Lord we're not on the legalism we enter the light of the world we're under the freedom of the Holy Spirit we are not under lawlessness and then calling that Liberty we're under the word of God and we are free within the Limitless boundaries of the word of God hallelujah I said it before I say it again the a race horse is free there's those horses that say we are free but then they run off and they run on the hills and the mountains and everything else but the racehorse he allows as brother Branham says he allows the rider to train him and write him amen and he runs and he wins the race and he gets a crown or a cup praise the lord we are running in line with the word amen so we can have a praise like Paul said amen you're not just running here running there running all over the place you settle down you'll stay with the word you stay established establishing Christ hallelujah amen keep your eyes looking away to Jesus we're not looking for a new church about the church we're not looking for a a new this or a new that no sir we're not in any Monkey Business where we're looking for shiny stuff no we're looking to the word of God hallelujah to hold our soul glory to God Amen yes sir oh my what an hour amen yes sir now we know that that evening light shines towards the top of the tree the evening lights the Bible said but shine again Hallelujah and I believe they are here now and they're shining for the glory of God Amen oh oh so we know if it will shine to the on the top of the tree the Capstone the pyramid so then we know if we will shine on the top of the tree it is the top of the tree that sees the evening light and ripens first amen for this age amen praise God maybe they're ripened for the other ages that their past but for this age the ones who see that praise the Lord now you understand why the devil got them putting a star on the top of every Christmas tree right but they're not in this they got the star that they put up there but they're not connected to the real star of the word of God hallelujah oh my yes sir that light came out to shine us in the morning amen now that same light will produce the same kinds of fruit that was back there shining and living on that tree oh I say it's Resurrection time for the bride amen glory to God hallelujah all you see if you don't have a revelation on the word the way how he's talking and these things seems to be mixed in you wouldn't really be able to follow him with a direct train of thought except God opens up your understanding amen yes that tree was killed for messengers of death killed that tree yes that was it but them four Roman Devils with their dogmas kill the tree amen but thank God Hallelujah that this one the four messengers of life restores that tree back the tree that them Roman godmers killed that tree but the word in other words brings the street back to life again Resurrection brings it back on the scene glory to God hallelujah amen your word of the Lord came to the prophet how that in the evening light amen will restore it back and turn the hearts of them children back to the faith of their fathers that fourth light does that the evening light prophesy son of man can those Dry Bones live oh my we won't even talk about that I'll give you the scripture you read it yourself because he talks watch them four stages of how Them Bones raised up and then come back to life and then you trace how we might have been in denominations which is uh you know a cemetery or a seminary in a graveyard amen and now you're being raised up by the grace of God hallelujah amen prophesy son of man he said oh I wish I had time but I got it root down there they're here but I have to miss that oh my prophesy can those Dry Bones live them four stages of the coming fourth of the church again glory to God Hallelujah the four stages of Ezekiel Dry Bones coming forth the four stages of the coming forth of the church amen the life only come not when the skin was on them amen that life didn't come then even though skin was there upon them praise God hallelujah yes it come with the fourth message of life and brought them back Hallelujah oh my glory to God he says hallelujah he said Glory he says again praise be to God amen amen hallelujah that fourth light brings them back again the hallelujah amen yes but this fortnight is to come and that's where I said near things like that which I didn't understand back then I put the word here prophecy amen and now we are in that light amen isn't that wonderful hallelujah oh my see that fourth light you know is the word itself it's the word it's not gifts it's not justification there's nothing else coming for the people or to the people but will be the word he himself Gathering them together amen not in a little room brother Branham talked about there that was in a type but the people didn't understand that they think he's going to come back and have a little room and and do all kinds of healing a small tent and all of that oh praise God but is the Lord having you amen and I in the closet of our hearts and speaking to us himself revealing himself revealing his word to us that we might know him personally individually amen we're not talking about psychology we call this uh people being manipulated by mass mind Mass psychology you know how crowds behave if one person looks up and like they're seeing something what did you see in another one before another crowd is there and there's really nothing there but because of mass psychology amen but he's trying to tell you this is nothing going to be like that because I'm going to come to each one individual and reveal this in the this Revelation is going to be individual it's you saw it it's not your pasticide it's the deacons not the deacons you saw it not your mother not your father not your sister not your brother you caught it amen hallelujah and that when you catch something like that nobody can take it away from you amen praise God nobody persuaded you convince you uh or let's use a religious term or converted you amen the Holy Spirit himself spoke into your heart amen praise God that Fort Light is still to come amen but it will bring forth the same signs the same things amen the same Holiness the same rejoicing the same clapping of hands and joy and rejoicing it will produce that back again Pentecostal again but what the the fourth will be the word itself but it will be the word made flesh again praise God hallelujah oh my what he says fruits what fruits fruits of the Resurrection sign that Christ has finally after justification had been planted sanctification had been planted baptismal Holy Ghost how come then the organizations will begin to die out my and you know how many many times I read this book over over mark it doesn't even have a cover my original book amen but the point is now you've seen it clearly died out that is when Christ comes again and centers himself like that cap on the pyramid why because he become the center of all revelation he come the center of the church he become the center of our joy and of our life this the cap comes down to fit on the pyramid praise God hallelujah amen uh we will get to that but you know the pyramid has a certain shape on the top of it whatever Capstone comes the keys key at the bottom has got to fit in that other hole there perfectly and and so the Deep will call to the Deep the war the world will call out to his words of life that's a hair that were in The Roots and now raised up in a bright form to bring glory to his name in this generation amen praise God hallelujah yes sir lion oh my first line justification then sacrification baptism Holy Ghost get it now then the coming down of the cap what is it that is that Holy Ghost bunch now being honed out amen so that it could fit with the same kind of ministry that he had when he went away and when he comes back like that it will catch the whole thing up in a rapture is that right praise God he's right and line isn't that right for us you have a resurrection and in him it was his Ascension but for the bride many membered body Resurrection being raised up now in the process when that's over with Rapture praise God hallelujah right out of here the Rapture of the Bride amen he says you see then when it catches the whole thing in a Rapture amen where they're all having everything justification Sanctified back to the Holy Ghost all that that pyramid will then stand again is that right praise God hallelujah praise the Lord the pyramid will stand again but remember you've got to remember these little things that he says remember that that perfect stature of a perfect man so the pyramid is the symbol of the man Christ Jesus right when it says the pyramid will stand again that's the total entire body cap and the rest of of the ages all one together amen it will stand again that means the house of God will live again that is that tree of life here growing again praise
