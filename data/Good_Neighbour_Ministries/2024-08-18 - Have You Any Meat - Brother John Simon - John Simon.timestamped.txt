[43:37] if you'll find it in your Bible find it
[43:39] in your
[43:41] Bible oh they have it up there that's
[43:45] wonderful yes brother I can read from
[43:47] the back of my head I know
[43:52] that praise the
[43:55] Lord after these
[43:57] things Jesus showed himself again to the
[44:01] disciples at the Sea of
[44:03] tiberias of course it's the same Sea of
[44:07] Galilee which was renamed by the Roman
[44:10] emperor in his name right that's why
[44:13] it's called by both names Tiberius and
[44:16] in another moment it's called Sea of
[44:19] Galilee right uh there were together
[44:23] Simon Peter and Thomas called didus and
[44:27] Nathaniel of kaaa in Galilee and the
[44:30] sons of Zebedee and two other of his
[44:33] disciples Simon Peter said unto them I
[44:37] go a fishing now this is just after
[44:40] Jesus had died and uh again they had no
[44:46] they didn't know really much about his
[44:49] resurrection or anything like that so
[44:51] and they were waiting in that waiting
[44:53] period between his resurrection
[44:57] on the day of
[44:58] Pentecost they didn't know what to do
[45:01] like a lot of people in between the
[45:04] prophet dying and going up to glory and
[45:09] waiting for the Rapture a lot of people
[45:11] don't know what to do a lot of people
[45:14] are getting confused misled misdirected
[45:17] misplaced and stuff like that
[45:19] misinformed and uh they're in a state of
[45:22] confusion and don't know what to do yet
[45:25] they are true believers but they're just
[45:28] confused as far as that goes right now
[45:33] here Simon Peter said unto them I go
[45:37] fishing I'm going to go fishing I'm not
[45:39] going to sit here doing nothing in
[45:41] church I've got to go do something all
[45:44] right now they say unto him we also go
[45:49] with thee they went forth there's the
[45:51] influence of leadership is very
[45:53] important they went forth and entered
[45:57] into the ship immediately and that night
[46:01] they caught nothing that mean they
[46:04] fished all night and they caught nothing
[46:09] okay but when the morning was
[46:12] come was was now come Jesus stood on the
[46:17] shore but the disciples knew not that it
[46:22] was
[46:23] Jesus just as I may ask you the same
[46:26] question
[46:27] have you seen him since he's
[46:30] risen you knew him before but now he's
[46:35] risen he's in a revelated
[46:39] form Christ The Mystery of God now being
[46:44] revealed by the presence and power of
[46:46] the Holy Spirit not by human emotion or
[46:50] human
[46:51] instrumentality but by the grace of God
[46:54] he pours out his spirit upon All Flesh
[46:58] praise the Lord hallelujah and uh then
[47:02] Jesus said unto them children have you
[47:06] any
[47:09] meat they answered no and he said unto
[47:13] them cast the the net on the right side
[47:16] of the ship and you shall find the rest
[47:19] of the story you know you're aware the
[47:23] Nets were so filled they couldn't pull
[47:25] them in they had to call for other
[47:28] churches other ships to come and take
[47:31] some of the catch uh because it was so
[47:34] much but we praise God for his the
[47:36] reading of his word and using that as
[47:39] the absolute using that as the
[47:42] foundations right for us to say a few
[47:45] words for his glory and for his honor
[47:48] praise God hallelujah let us pray our
[47:52] gracious Heavenly Father once again we
[47:55] are honored to be here
[47:57] in your presence and with your people
[47:59] pray you'll take the word and apply the
[48:02] token to the hearts of the people that
[48:05] their hearts may may may be softened and
[48:08] maybe their eyes will be open their ears
[48:11] will hear and the Holy Spirit will
[48:13] represent himself through the word of
[48:16] God we ask this in jesus' name amen and
[48:19] amen the Lord bless you please be seated
[48:27] Jesus as we explained they they had
[48:31] fished all
[48:33] night uh not during the day and you know
[48:37] it's better fishing at night anyway
[48:40] fishes run by night and if you know
[48:44] anything about fishing when the moon or
[48:47] is in the right position the fish run
[48:50] even more and you're able to catch even
[48:52] more fish like that but they were
[48:55] fishing and they fished all all night
[48:58] first of all they made a decision to
[49:01] leave and go where they wanted to and to
[49:05] go
[49:06] fishing and they caught nothing with all
[49:10] their human struggle with all their
[49:13] expertise they were not just learning
[49:16] how to fish they were men who knew how
[49:19] to fish right just like these uh Jesus
[49:24] said the the stone which the build
[49:26] Builders rejected the builders
[49:30] experts they they they should be able to
[49:33] recognize that this was no ordinary
[49:35] Stone but the even the experts failed to
[49:39] recognize that was the Keystone The
[49:43] Headstone the Capstone that was the
[49:46] original Alpha and Omega amen upon which
[49:50] our faith rests upon Jesus Christ the
[49:54] same yesterday today and forever am okay
[49:58] now we understand here that when he said
[50:03] the scripture says there were fishing
[50:05] all night I want you to throw this
[50:08] thought in when he speaks of the night
[50:11] from the time they sun
[50:15] sets puts it in let me put it in the
[50:17] words of brother brandham he said the
[50:21] stars come out to shine only after the
[50:25] sun has gone down
[50:27] and so the messengers time of The
[50:31] Messengers started for them to shine it
[50:35] had to be
[50:37] night and so the church was out there
[50:41] fishing all
[50:43] night fishing through Seven
[50:46] Ages trying to catch something to eat
[50:50] even a crawfish even a a crab or
[50:53] something something to eat but we find
[50:57] they caught
[50:59] nothing drown Through the Ages it came
[51:03] that way phases different phases of the
[51:06] night they pass through it right and we
[51:10] know the darkest hour is just before the
[51:14] dawn amen I believe we are living right
[51:18] now in the darkest
[51:20] hour I believe all the prophet has
[51:24] prophesied is now coming to pass
[51:28] in his words modern events are making
[51:32] things clearer and clearer in the light
[51:34] of Vindicated prophecy amen so we are
[51:38] not only preaching talking living
[51:43] understanding the prophecies but we are
[51:45] part of that prophecy we are in the
[51:49] prophecy yes sir and we are making the
[51:52] prophecy known through our lives when
[51:55] Jesus died di on the cross around 400
[51:58] and something prophecies were fulfilled
[52:02] quickly just like that it's the same
[52:05] with us we are here amongst the people
[52:07] they think that we are just the ordinary
[52:10] persons like they are not realizing that
[52:14] we are not creatures of time we come
[52:16] from eternity and we return back to
[52:21] Eternity every Jew drop that falls
[52:25] brother Bram said the Sun comes out to
[52:28] shine he says they go right back up
[52:31] where they come from and every Jew drop
[52:34] that's here this morning is going right
[52:37] back where you come
[52:39] from and you can't help it because we're
[52:42] in the presence of the Sun the sunlight
[52:45] of revelation of God's word strikes your
[52:49] heart and you recognize that it's not
[52:52] just man it's god making himself known
[52:55] in this hour what the day in which we
[52:57] are living when the world is making
[53:00] himself manifest again Hallelujah glory
[53:03] to God hallelujah yes sir and so he
[53:07] asked them praise God have you any meat
[53:12] praise the Lord I want you to know
[53:15] something here friends brother brandham
[53:18] touched upon this and I want to go to
[53:22] his quotation his sermon blasphemia
[53:27] names he spoke about the vision that he
[53:31] had in the forest if you have time you
[53:34] can read it yourself I'm not going to
[53:36] read word for word but get the gist or
[53:39] the understanding out of
[53:41] it he said and there I was I saw myself
[53:46] standing in the
[53:48] Sun not just
[53:50] Su but he's in Christ he's speaking the
[53:54] word under the anointing of the the Holy
[53:57] Ghost amen yes and you see it was
[54:02] absolutely perfect and the words you
[54:05] know that I have spoken can never fail
[54:10] praise God I thought I was the happiest
[54:14] person I ever seen standing in the sun
[54:18] there praise God and there was a large
[54:22] Mammoth
[54:24] congregation oh they were sitting in the
[54:27] forest streaks of sun were shining on
[54:30] them they had a little bit of
[54:33] understanding right and they were
[54:35] listening to him there there as they
[54:37] were getting the word but then preaching
[54:42] too long preaching too late preaching
[54:46] again he repeats too long and I preached
[54:51] so long until the congregation began to
[54:55] become hungry for physical
[55:00] food right they want to leave the
[55:02] message and go out take care of their
[55:04] necessities and their natural things
[55:06] first not we are supposed to take care
[55:09] of our families and of ourselves but I'm
[55:12] saying when you get drawn away by all
[55:15] these things of natural life right not
[55:18] keeping your eyes on Heavenly things not
[55:21] keeping your eyes on the things of God
[55:24] then we enter into TR
[55:26] trouble so they became hungry for
[55:30] physical food some of them got so tired
[55:33] they just got up out of the meeting and
[55:38] went out to get them some food and when
[55:41] they did that I said don't don't do that
[55:45] don't for I have two climaxes yet to
[55:49] come right remember the third the puls
[55:52] one two three right one to the flesh one
[55:55] to the soul and the one one to the heart
[55:58] one goes to the soul amen praise God so
[56:01] you realize that God's holy spirit in
[56:03] this last pull this last time this last
[56:07] climax God is pulling now for his chosen
[56:10] ones that at the elected life and seed
[56:14] and Gene germ whatever you want to
[56:16] describe it in them that's why the
[56:19] discernment of the spirit is going to
[56:23] it's going right there and the
[56:25] attraction of it is the magnet of the
[56:28] word deep calling to deep pulling
[56:31] towards that Soul that's been hidden
[56:34] there waiting for this hour when the
[56:37] word of God comes on the scene and
[56:40] begins to draw them back where they come
[56:42] from amen hallelujah praise God Amen I
[56:47] know the Lord had given that to
[56:50] me and any preacher knows when you
[56:54] really know that is God that gave it to
[56:57] you and it burns within your heart see
[57:02] and I saw I was preaching so hard to
[57:05] them like that about these great things
[57:08] of God oh I shouted glory to God look on
[57:13] these wonderful things oh but people
[57:16] began to talk and murmur because they
[57:19] were physically hungry right and they
[57:23] had enough spiritual they had enough
[57:26] spiritual things so now they started
[57:29] walking away he said and brother Bram
[57:31] yawns at this point and he literally
[57:34] yawns he said and some of them I saw
[57:38] started yawning and walking away from
[57:42] the message I was preaching I thought
[57:46] what's the matter with these people
[57:49] what's the matter with everybody and
[57:52] there were some young couples going
[57:54] along to my side I said just a minute
[57:56] just a minute you'll be back again when
[58:00] the evening Shadows
[58:02] Fall I said you'll be back again but let
[58:05] me give you the first climax before you
[58:08] go where does all these things come from
[58:11] that I have showed you where are they
[58:14] from here they are they are in the word
[58:17] of God they are thus sayith the Lord his
[58:22] promise all of you bear me record this
[58:25] Witness this commission all of gods just
[58:29] stay with the word what's the matter
[58:32] with you all can't you understand the
[58:35] word that you are receiving you must
[58:38] understand it and some of them said man
[58:42] uh man the word but I love to get some
[58:47] biscuits they leave the word to go and
[58:50] get
[58:52] biscuits okay I thought well glory to
[58:55] God if they want biscuits let them go
[58:58] get their
[58:59] biscuits I turned around and said but
[59:02] you know the Shadows are going to fall
[59:05] darkness in other words and the Darkness
[59:07] is falling right now we know that the
[59:09] darkness is falling right now then
[59:12] tonight when a congregation comes
[59:14] together I'll put the climax to them and
[59:17] tell them the things they've seen me do
[59:20] is found in the word of God and not it's
[59:23] not a myth because that's what the devil
[59:26] is trying to put out now to get people's
[59:29] minds starting to think maybe this are
[59:31] just nice stories man of long ago with
[59:34] miracles signs wonders healings and is
[59:38] just like the other evangelists and it's
[59:40] all going to pass and it's not going to
[59:44] it's not going to stay forever it's
[59:46] going to pass away so the holy spirit
[59:48] let him say this is not a myth this is
[59:53] not from some mythical book
[59:56] it's not from an
[59:58] organization it is found in the word of
[1:00:02] God every bit of it in the word because
[1:00:06] I am commissioned to do that you know
[1:00:10] there'll everyone be back tonight so
[1:00:13] I'll background kind of background until
[1:00:17] they get back I'll do I'll do these
[1:00:19] things the church ages and things like
[1:00:22] that background and what I said before
[1:00:25] I'll back ground on the word of God when
[1:00:28] this marvelous climax what a time it
[1:00:31] will be amen and then I seen myself
[1:00:35] begin to fade out like that and here I
[1:00:40] was oh my there it is praise the Lord
[1:00:44] friends never look at the world or the
[1:00:49] cosmos as the message of God Amen none
[1:00:54] of them preaching out side of this
[1:00:56] message may be religious it may be
[1:00:59] spiritual but don't look to any of that
[1:01:02] for any
[1:01:04] leadership don't look to any of that for
[1:01:07] any guidance let the Holy Spirit keep
[1:01:10] you in the message of the hour praise
[1:01:14] God you
[1:01:15] see let me say this brother Brandon
[1:01:18] saying when you go you say well brother
[1:01:21] Bose said I had a dream years ago God
[1:01:24] would send me to Chicago and Shake
[1:01:27] Chicago for the glory of God Joseph said
[1:01:30] he I said to Joseph he's already done it
[1:01:34] he said why they haven't been shaken
[1:01:37] since the time of
[1:01:39] Moody I said I am talking about the
[1:01:43] church I'm not talking about the rest of
[1:01:45] them out there the church World he's not
[1:01:48] talking about the church world he really
[1:01:50] talking about the bride right oh my
[1:01:53] that's just the dust of the earth that
[1:01:56] Bunch cramming through the streets
[1:01:57] painted Jezebels and everything else I
[1:02:00] said them big old lodges and things will
[1:02:03] all crumble and fall in the streets but
[1:02:05] he's talking to his church the church
[1:02:09] that has seen the the church that has
[1:02:13] seen the revelation of Jesus Christ made
[1:02:18] manifest and they those ones recognize
[1:02:23] it they recognize it there may not be
[1:02:28] 15 out of this city of
[1:02:31] Chicago you remember Jesus said few
[1:02:35] there be that will find it it's a narrow
[1:02:39] way and a lot of people see thousands
[1:02:42] and thousands of people in the message
[1:02:44] they think everyone is going here but uh
[1:02:48] well they'll go in but not as the
[1:02:52] bride as I've said before maybe as
[1:02:54] bridegrooms
[1:02:56] uh maybe as a guard maybe as a servant
[1:02:59] uh different levels of those that are in
[1:03:02] the book of life but they are not going
[1:03:07] in the bride they're not going in this
[1:03:10] particular time because he says in the
[1:03:13] city of Chicago which you know is
[1:03:15] millions of people he said only about
[1:03:20] 15 right my goodness think of it just as
[1:03:25] it was there might not be 10 come out of
[1:03:28] this
[1:03:29] generation that's how close it is that's
[1:03:33] why we have to make our calling and our
[1:03:35] election
[1:03:37] sure is that right make your calling and
[1:03:40] election sure don't guess don't hope I
[1:03:45] hope I be in the Rapture I I I I trust
[1:03:48] I'm going to be there no sir uh it just
[1:03:52] as it was as in the days of Noah so will
[1:03:54] it be at the coming of the son of man
[1:03:58] wherein eight Souls were saved let me
[1:04:02] say that the church has already received
[1:04:06] their
[1:04:08] shaking the church world has been
[1:04:13] Shook and a lot of fruits you know when
[1:04:16] I was a boy we'd go by in people's mango
[1:04:19] trees or banana trees or what it's not
[1:04:22] too near the fence or it's hanging over
[1:04:25] and uh you you know we' shake the tree
[1:04:27] and all the fruits will fall on the
[1:04:29] ground and the church world has been
[1:04:33] Shook and we came out from the church
[1:04:36] world we were shaken Loose by the
[1:04:39] revelation of this Prophet thank you
[1:04:41] Lord amen and God set us free by
[1:04:45] bringing us out by his grace amen
[1:04:48] hallelujah and when the first message
[1:04:51] when they see it everybody rallied for
[1:04:54] it amen Oh Glory to God hallelujah they
[1:04:59] they recognize it they know the word
[1:05:02] they seen the word when it was being
[1:05:05] materialized and they caught
[1:05:08] it amen look at that now oh my see oh
[1:05:14] Hallelujah then they go away some of
[1:05:17] them the same way they come Hallelujah
[1:05:21] think of it praise God but don't worry
[1:05:25] the sh Shadows are close at
[1:05:28] hand amen the Shadows are close at hand
[1:05:32] we can say they are here right now
[1:05:36] Hallelujah now let me uh pick up back my
[1:05:40] thought here that we are talking about
[1:05:44] the question that he asked the
[1:05:47] disciples you fished all night and you
[1:05:51] caught nothing whatsoever you did not
[1:05:54] catch
[1:05:56] amen Jesus asked them from the shore
[1:06:01] after a whole night of
[1:06:03] fasting come and have
[1:06:06] breakfast come break your fast from all
[1:06:10] the stuff that you uh the hunger that
[1:06:14] you were bearing now I want to ask you
[1:06:20] individually what are you
[1:06:24] eating we have come from
[1:06:27] everywhere uh we come from different
[1:06:30] groups different churches I said groups
[1:06:33] in the message and I'm still asking you
[1:06:37] have you any
[1:06:39] meat oh oh but I was in the message I
[1:06:41] heard the word I heard about the prophet
[1:06:44] and oh my goodness I got all kinds of
[1:06:47] Revelation and stuff of that nature and
[1:06:50] and and so I know the word of God and I
[1:06:54] I don't know what you're talking about
[1:06:56] here in that regard see but I want to
[1:07:00] ask you have you any
[1:07:02] meet you might have heard the word
[1:07:05] preached the in the form of even this
[1:07:09] message but even when you heard that did
[1:07:13] you get any meat out of it right
[1:07:19] now I want you to
[1:07:22] realize that God didn't want you you to
[1:07:25] eat on
[1:07:27] History he did not want you to eat on
[1:07:32] theology God didn't want you to eat on
[1:07:35] the stored up accumulation of human
[1:07:39] knowledge put into books that you can go
[1:07:44] study and then when you study enough of
[1:07:46] it you're so filled with it you sound as
[1:07:49] if you have Revelation because you can
[1:07:51] bring forth all that knowledge and
[1:07:54] present it to the people
[1:07:56] in that way but God is now separating
[1:07:58] the whole thing and letting us know
[1:08:02] Revelation is not that men talk about
[1:08:06] men that tell preachers oh I studied all
[1:08:09] night I fasted I prayed I read all the
[1:08:12] books so many many times I I know every
[1:08:15] Dot and everything else that's more no
[1:08:17] better than a Pharisee yeah no better
[1:08:20] than a saddu see uh right that's not
[1:08:23] what this is just to give you a hint
[1:08:26] what Bible did Abel
[1:08:30] read what Bible did Abel
[1:08:33] read did he just decide that well I'm
[1:08:36] just going to grab some uh fruits and
[1:08:40] offer it on the altar will I let me
[1:08:42] catch a bird or or I'll just go how did
[1:08:46] he
[1:08:47] know the Bible says by
[1:08:51] Faith by
[1:08:54] Revelation and no no Bible was yet
[1:08:56] written for you to go study the Bible
[1:08:58] from cover to cover uh this book from
[1:09:00] cover to cover to be able to know but
[1:09:03] Revelation is God's thoughts through
[1:09:06] your thoughts and through your mouth or
[1:09:08] through your life amen thank you Jesus
[1:09:11] the revelation of God's spirit by the
[1:09:15] word wants to make itself
[1:09:18] manifest who was that MDC who is this
[1:09:24] MDC who is the Son of God who is the
[1:09:28] child of the most high God the Holy
[1:09:31] Spirit of this last day comes to fulfill
[1:09:35] his own
[1:09:37] word
[1:09:39] hallu
[1:09:42] hallelujah satisfied with crackers and
[1:09:46] biscuits disguised as the
[1:09:49] message that's not what the real seed of
[1:09:52] God is here for to eat on the word of
[1:09:55] God you got some Believers that are even
[1:09:58] satisfied with road kill
[1:10:01] message uh you know dead dogs and dead
[1:10:05] Hawks and whatever else on the side of
[1:10:07] the road they they they're happy with
[1:10:10] that and they'll feed on that but that
[1:10:12] thing has been on the road for for maybe
[1:10:17] five six seven days and it's all rotten
[1:10:21] in the street that theology is nothing
[1:10:24] but a bunch of mock don't you know
[1:10:27] you're feeding on the dog's vomit amen
[1:10:31] it's Satan's vomit they're feeding on
[1:10:34] the same lies that he told in the
[1:10:37] beginning that just rumored and went
[1:10:40] through the heavens and went to the some
[1:10:43] of those angels they were eating nothing
[1:10:46] but the dog vomit of that devil amen and
[1:10:51] he has now regurgitated his life re
[1:10:55] gradated all his mess and he's spreading
[1:10:58] it everywhere within the message within
[1:11:02] the very presence of the Living God
[1:11:05] hallelujah but every time he does that
[1:11:08] God raises up a standard against him
[1:11:11] Hall and we are here to raise a standard
[1:11:14] against
[1:11:15] him amen raise a standard Hallelujah

[1:14:00] teaching everywhere like that amen
[1:14:04] hallelujah regurgitating all kinds of
[1:14:07] history and impressing the People by
[1:14:10] quoting uh Shakespeare Spencer
[1:14:14] Kipling whoever they quote these great
[1:14:16] men and let them feed on that and they
[1:14:19] appear as if they're so brilliant and
[1:14:22] educated know something they know
[1:14:24] nothing thing because they're out of the
[1:14:27] stream of Supernatural
[1:14:31] Revelation not Revelation look there's
[1:14:34] two kinds of knowledge you know that
[1:14:38] there is sense knowledge and there is
[1:14:41] revelation
[1:14:42] knowledge education and all the highest
[1:14:46] forms of Education comes
[1:14:49] from the senses the accumulation of
[1:14:53] wisdom of men through their senses over
[1:14:58] centuries that is not Revelation that is
[1:15:02] human
[1:15:03] knowledge Revelation knowledge is what
[1:15:06] will make a prophet tells you not
[1:15:11] guessing but tell you your name is son
[1:15:14] so you come from this address
[1:15:18] 5432 whatever and your house has a blind
[1:15:22] and a blind the color of the drapes are
[1:15:24] this and that and oh by the way
[1:15:26] yesterday you went to the doctor and
[1:15:28] when you went there and the doctor was
[1:15:30] trying to give you the medicine his
[1:15:31] elbow knocked a bottle from off the
[1:15:34] shelf do you remember that the person
[1:15:36] screams and they shout why because it's
[1:15:38] a prophet speaking well God is making
[1:15:42] himself known to his people not at that
[1:15:45] level but it's the same vein of
[1:15:49] Revelation breaking upon his people and
[1:15:52] the word of God is opening up itself
[1:15:55] that we could recognize what he is
[1:15:58] saying hallelujah praise God do you
[1:16:01] recognize what he's saying
[1:16:03] amen amen yes sir Hallelujah yes sir I
[1:16:07] want you to know that that that's Satan
[1:16:09] trying to put forth his false tale
[1:16:13] knowledge that he stored up in all kinds
[1:16:16] of books listen I'm not just talking
[1:16:18] like that all this Pulpit commentary
[1:16:22] I've been been in all that stuff I still
[1:16:24] have them sometimes you need to look and
[1:16:26] find certain things to uh give you some
[1:16:29] understanding what other people thought
[1:16:32] about it but you're not going by what
[1:16:34] other people thought you're going by
[1:16:36] what God thought amen praise God
[1:16:40] hallelujah those things are wonderful uh
[1:16:42] and they're marvelous but if Satan got
[1:16:45] his lies mixed into these things amen
[1:16:48] yes sir let me tell you now friends it's
[1:16:52] so clear that when he ask have you any
[1:16:56] meat amen with all your works with all
[1:17:00] you working all night with all the
[1:17:03] theologians studying down through the
[1:17:05] centuries when you get that what have
[1:17:08] you got you've got nothing and your soul
[1:17:11] is starving for the reality of the power
[1:17:15] and the presence of almighty God
[1:17:17] hallelujah oh thanks be the God for the
[1:17:19] holy spirit that is the same yesterday
[1:17:22] today and forever praise God hallelujah
[1:17:27] amen now the it tells us that they saw
[1:17:31] him on the shore think of it a stranger
[1:17:35] on the
[1:17:37] shore they had spent three and a half
[1:17:39] years with
[1:17:41] him in the words of the Prophet they ate
[1:17:44] with him they slept with him uh they
[1:17:47] fished with him and yet when he came
[1:17:50] back with his
[1:17:52] resurrected revelated body
[1:17:55] they said they knew not that it was the
[1:17:59] Lord they did not recognize the same
[1:18:02] word that was there with them all the
[1:18:05] time I'm afraid that's what's happening
[1:18:07] with a lot of Believers following this
[1:18:11] message lot of Believers following this
[1:18:13] message fishing about fishing about
[1:18:16] fishing about and they're catching
[1:18:18] nothing some jump from church to church
[1:18:21] to church to church some run here run
[1:18:24] there let me tell you God's holy spirit
[1:18:26] will lead you and guide Le amen and
[1:18:29] he'll tell you where to be amen it's as
[1:18:31] simple as that it appears like nothing
[1:18:33] you see this kind of preaching God hides
[1:18:36] himself in
[1:18:37] Simplicity and and it appears like oh
[1:18:40] it's nothing I didn't hear anything yeah
[1:18:42] but God is speaking by his word and if
[1:18:45] you got the ears to hear you will hear
[1:18:47] it if you got the eyes to see you will
[1:18:49] see it praise the Lord so
[1:18:55] Jesus he said have you any meat and then
[1:19:00] they came to shore of course I don't
[1:19:02] want to go through the whole thing Peter
[1:19:04] jumping in the water and rushing to to
[1:19:07] meet Jesus all like that but look he
[1:19:11] already had the fish and bread
[1:19:14] prepared is that
[1:19:17] right he couldn't just light the fire
[1:19:19] just when they were close to the shore
[1:19:21] that means he had it prepared beforehand
[1:19:25] he had it roasting there and ready for
[1:19:28] them when they came in right and the
[1:19:31] food that we are eating now was food
[1:19:34] prepared before the foundation of the
[1:19:37] world this is not Seminary stuff this is
[1:19:41] not from some University this is not
[1:19:44] from some college this is not something
[1:19:47] I dig up on the Internet and look the
[1:19:49] internet is good I use it too but it's
[1:19:51] not just what we dig up on the internet
[1:19:54] that only as supports and helps what we
[1:19:57] want to try to make clear to you but
[1:19:59] this comes from the very mind of God the
[1:20:03] presence of almighty God God's holy
[1:20:05] spirit working across our hearts amen
[1:20:09] God revealing himself oh praise God
[1:20:13] forever more and so this word was there
[1:20:16] before the foundations of the world and
[1:20:19] the Bible said they found him roasting
[1:20:22] it on the fire oh praise PR God forever
[1:20:25] more let me tell you something friends
[1:20:28] we need the
[1:20:30] fire you can't uh and the reason why I
[1:20:34] say this do you know that God receives
[1:20:39] only his burnt
[1:20:41] offerings and to have a burnt offering
[1:20:44] it got to pass through fire and Jesus
[1:20:48] went down into hell so that he could be
[1:20:52] the true burnt offering of the people of
[1:20:55] God and even so I believe in this hour
[1:20:59] that we have to have calls of fire to
[1:21:02] roast and bring forth the juices and the
[1:21:06] life from out of the word of God I
[1:21:09] believe as in Isaiah six the fire from
[1:21:13] off of the altar was put on the town of
[1:21:16] the of the of Isaiah amen when he said
[1:21:21] speak my Lord I believe that same fire
[1:21:25] calls of fire from out of the word of
[1:21:27] God must come again upon the minister
[1:21:30] that there become burning fire brands
[1:21:33] for the glory of God hallelujah amen the
[1:21:36] message has got to come word to life yes
[1:21:40] and what's happened the devil has used
[1:21:43] when brother brandham said we are not
[1:21:45] Pentecostals oh my
[1:21:48] goodness that has made some people
[1:21:51] scared to clap their hands in church
[1:21:54] we're not supposed to be pentec they're
[1:21:56] scared to have a drum they're scared to
[1:21:59] play a guitar because they feel Church
[1:22:01] ought to be very Catholic Church ought
[1:22:04] to be very decently and in order not we
[1:22:08] must have order but that order is God's
[1:22:11] order of the holy spirit amen but let me
[1:22:15] tell you the day of Pentecost is the
[1:22:18] pattern for the
[1:22:19] church and we are the true original
[1:22:23] Pentecostals
[1:22:26] Alpha has become
[1:22:28] Omega amen oh he preached what Paul
[1:22:31] preached and the same way that the
[1:22:34] spirit made them act in the beginning is
[1:22:37] the same way the spirit will make you
[1:22:40] act here now at the
[1:22:44] end this is winding up this is all
[1:22:48] winding up because we're going up the
[1:22:50] devil is not going to shut us up we're
[1:22:52] getting out of here by the grace of
[1:22:54] God hallelujah glory to God Amen praise
[1:23:00] God glory to His Marvelous and wonderful
[1:23:03] name so the fish and bread had to be
[1:23:08] burnt in the fire praise God and I tell
[1:23:12] you I like the word burning within my
[1:23:15] heart praise God uh I went to a certain
[1:23:18] church and I was preaching there and
[1:23:22] after I finished preaching the a young
[1:23:25] preacher got up and we don't want any
[1:23:27] Pentecostals here and all because I
[1:23:30] spoke just for about five minutes and
[1:23:33] the people started shouting message
[1:23:35] people uh they forgot themselves and
[1:23:37] they started shouting and and like that
[1:23:40] and you know the senior preacher didn't
[1:23:43] even rebuke him didn't even correct him
[1:23:46] or anything because it seems like he
[1:23:48] himself can recognize what God is doing
[1:23:50] in this hour and in this time amen and
[1:23:54] that's the way it goes Hallelujah but a
[1:23:56] True Believer when they come in the
[1:23:58] presence of God nothing can shut them
[1:24:01] up nothing can shut them up amen they
[1:24:05] tell him when he when the when he was
[1:24:06] coming into Jerusalem amen they said
[1:24:09] tell your disciples to shut up tell them
[1:24:12] to stop shouting and carrying on like
[1:24:15] that but how could they shut up they
[1:24:17] were looking that prophecy being
[1:24:19] fulfilled right before their very
[1:24:22] eyes how could that shut up when they
[1:24:25] see uh zachariah's prophecy being
[1:24:27] fulfilled riding your king is coming in
[1:24:30] riding on the cult the fall of an ask
[1:24:33] how they going to shut up when they see
[1:24:35] the living word right before their very
[1:24:38] eyes my God Hallelujah the word making
[1:24:42] itself manifest in this hour

[1:24:51] spirit you think the spirit that was
[1:24:54] upon B brother brandham is gone
[1:24:58] no amen where is Elijah that's not what
[1:25:03] we are here for right where is the god
[1:25:07] of
[1:25:08] Elijah where is the god of Elijah and
[1:25:13] that same God that was anointing Elijah
[1:25:17] as I as as I was with Moses so will I be
[1:25:22] with thee and that that Spirit broke
[1:25:25] itself up and went in the 70 men right
[1:25:30] and it was the same Spirit but it
[1:25:33] started the hour came represented by
[1:25:37] book of Acts 2:4 telling you how the
[1:25:39] pillar of fire stood there and then it
[1:25:40] started breaking into little pieces and
[1:25:44] going to each one of them Apostles that
[1:25:46] were there that's what is happening
[1:25:50] now the word is embodying itself not in
[1:25:55] brother William Marian branam he served
[1:25:57] his purpose it's now come to come into
[1:26:01] Believers and use them individually for
[1:26:05] his glory you believe that am amen
[1:26:08] that's what's going on right now the
[1:26:10] Holy Spirit making himself known by the
[1:26:13] word of God making itself known to them
[1:26:16] Hallelujah hungry he says you're hungry
[1:26:19] come and eat there's bread and Fish on
[1:26:22] the fire look there's bread and fish in
[1:26:24] the word but you won't recognize it
[1:26:28] that's what sets it on fire it's when
[1:26:30] the fire falls the Revelation comes the
[1:26:33] same word that you were reading all your
[1:26:36] life all of a sudden it comes on fire it
[1:26:38] comes on light it becomes bright your
[1:26:41] understanding opens your heart opens up
[1:26:44] and you begin to see and understand the
[1:26:47] word of God you remember when David Saul
[1:26:52] was after him how many remembers that
[1:26:56] Saul was after his life well this is not
[1:26:58] Saul this is the devil after
[1:27:01] you I said the devil is after you he
[1:27:04] wants every one of us if he can take us
[1:27:07] back he wants us right and David didn't
[1:27:11] know what to do because Saul had gone to
[1:27:14] all sent out his people and warn all the
[1:27:17] tribes not to give him nothing he's not
[1:27:20] to eat if you found it then you found
[1:27:23] doing that you're going to be in trouble
[1:27:25] so David didn't know what to do then he
[1:27:28] remembered all he can do is go to the
[1:27:31] high priest and so he went into the high
[1:27:35] priest and told the high priest he was
[1:27:37] hungry the priest said well we don't
[1:27:40] have anything here except the loaves of
[1:27:44] bread that are on the altar in the
[1:27:46] presence of God now you know those
[1:27:49] loaves of bread that were on the altar
[1:27:52] they were sitting there and they could
[1:27:55] not
[1:27:56] rot they couldn't
[1:27:58] rotten amen because they were in the
[1:28:01] presence of the pillar of fire that was
[1:28:03] hanging there with the Ark of the
[1:28:06] Covenant there and Aaron's Rod was even
[1:28:11] buding because that that it the presence
[1:28:14] of God brings
[1:28:15] life and when the presence of God is in
[1:28:17] a church it brings life you can't help
[1:28:20] it it brings life to it so so there it
[1:28:23] is that the priest said I have nothing
[1:28:26] and if you're not a priest and you eat
[1:28:28] that bread you will will die but David
[1:28:31] said I'm so hungry you know I might as
[1:28:34] well die even if I eat that bread I've
[1:28:36] got to eat something amen and he grabbed
[1:28:39] the whole of that shoe bread it's called
[1:28:42] the shoe bread oh my and he ate from the
[1:28:46] bread and we know now he did not
[1:28:49] die we are called Kings and Priests to
[1:28:52] God and the prophet said that shw bread
[1:28:56] could never rot not at all because it
[1:28:59] was in the presence of God and this
[1:29:02] message will never
[1:29:04] denominate the real message come on Amen
[1:29:08] now there are people in this message
[1:29:09] that are already denominating they
[1:29:12] they're in their groups they're in their
[1:29:13] this and that but they're not led by the
[1:29:16] spirit word of the Living God hallelujah
[1:29:19] amen but let me let you know in this
[1:29:22] hour praise God we are here by God as
[1:29:26] his chosen ones to eat upon that true
[1:29:29] bread that we might live forever in the
[1:29:32] presence of God hallelujah oh praise God
[1:29:35] that we might be Warriors for Jesus
[1:29:38] Christ like David was draw your sword
[1:29:41] let's go to battle for the glory of God
[1:29:44] hallelujah amen praise God so he at that
[1:29:48] sh bread that God gave to him he fed on
[1:29:52] it and life came to him and he was able
[1:29:55] to go out and finish his mission for the
[1:29:58] glory of God hallelujah oh thank God

[1:30:15] will know when it is time for them to
[1:30:19] know not before but in the time and that
[1:30:23] breaks right down to the individual God
[1:30:25] doesn't come as a group and reveal us to
[1:30:28] he reveals to one by one we gain the
[1:30:33] portals there to dwell with the
[1:30:38] Immortals when they ring them golden
[1:30:42] bells for you and me one by one they
[1:30:47] gain a portal what is a portal it's an
[1:30:50] entry point it's an entry point into the
[1:30:54] old Revelation it's a Gateway praise God
[1:30:58] and he says you can't go in as a group
[1:31:00] singing no matter how much sing No
