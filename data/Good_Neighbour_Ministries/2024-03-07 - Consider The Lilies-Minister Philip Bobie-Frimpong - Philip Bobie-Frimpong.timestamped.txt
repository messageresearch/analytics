[24:53] my
[24:54] scriptures
[24:56] um
[25:01] I think my first scripture will be from
[25:04] Matthew
[25:08] 6 vers 25 to35 but my main thought my
[25:14] main thought is based on verse 28 and 29
[25:18] I just want I read the the verse 25
[25:21] coming but that's not what is
[25:24] really my
[25:26] thoughts but just as a background but
[25:29] the main thought is between 28 and
[25:33] 29 um okay you got it let's
[25:36] read Matthew
[25:40] 6:25 to
[25:43] 35 and you're going to con more on the
[25:45] 28 and
[25:47] 29 therefore I say unto you take no
[25:51] thought for your life what shall you eat
[25:56] or what shall you drink nor for your
[26:00] body what shall you put on is not the
[26:03] life more than meat and the body th
[26:07] rment behold the fowls of the air for
[26:11] they sow not neither do they reap nor
[26:15] gather into BNS yet your heavenly father
[26:17] feeded them are you not much better than
[26:21] they which of You by taking thought can
[26:24] add one cubit into a stature my main
[26:28] thing here verse 28 and why takeing
[26:31] thought for
[26:32] rment consider the L my topic is
[26:36] consider the lies of the field how they
[26:39] grow they to not neither do they spin
[26:44] verse 29 yet I say unto you that even
[26:47] Solomon in all his glory was not AR raid
[26:52] like one of these let's go to
[26:55] um um
[26:58] [Music]
[26:59] Matthew 22:37 to4 you can read the whole
[27:03] scripture it talks about how God takes
[27:05] care of his
[27:07] children Matthew
[27:09] 22:37 to4 if you read Matthew 22 verse
[27:15] 37 if you read in Mark 1229 it's the
[27:19] same thing but in mark it says that the
[27:22] first commandment said here oh Israel
[27:24] the Lord your God is one God Amen and he
[27:27] said Jesus unto them thou shall love the
[27:29] Lord thy God with all thine heart and
[27:34] with all thy soul and with all thy mind
[27:38] this is the first and great
[27:41] commandment and the second is like unto
[27:44] it thou shall love thy neighbor as
[27:46] thyself on these two Commandments H all
[27:52] the law and the prophets let's pray oh

[29:36] the future home paragraph
[29:43] 191 said consider the L of the field
[29:49] 64802 paragraph
[29:52] 191 consider the lies of the field how
[29:56] they t
[29:57] and spin neither I say and yet Solomon
[30:04] all his of his glory El has to
[30:09] struggle day and night to get the
[30:13] radians to keep his garments to keep the
[30:17] perfume and things going on and add this
[30:21] he just opens up his and they come by
[30:25] and take it out of him the bee and the
[30:27] Fly everything comes by good or bad just
[30:31] takes from him in other words how the
[30:34] Lily struggle and all the struggle that
[30:37] he's going through is to live for others

[30:50] and everything that the Lily is doing
[30:52] his struggle to what live for others and
[30:56] the preacher who said a man of God that
[30:58] is preaching if he that gift is not for
[31:02] him it's for the people so it's not his
[31:06] gift it's the people's gift it's the
[31:10] people that he's there to speak to help
[31:13] them he might have his own problems that
[31:16] he might be going through but it's not
[31:20] will say that it's not like um I have
[31:22] the power for myself if I need something
[31:26] I have to go to God myself but when the
[31:27] people need can just use the gift and
[31:29] bum bum bum so it's not for himself it's
[31:33] for the people and if you take it higher
[31:36] the Lord Jesus Christ God himself he
[31:39] came down and sacrificed everything he
[31:43] had and come and became
[31:47] low in a and born in a stinking measure
[31:50] to save you and me he didn't have to go
[31:54] through that but he did it for you you
[31:57] and me that was the love of God that he
[32:01] came he when he came here he had the
[32:03] right to marry to do everything that he
[32:06] forsook all so that he can what save you
[32:11] and me and for you to live he has to die
[32:15] to give his life for you and me to live
[32:18] and everything natural once you are here
[32:21] even our natural life when eat chicken
[32:25] that roaster is dead you survive on dead
[32:29] substance you say I'm a vegetarian all
[32:32] those things you eat something die
[32:34] because for you to live naturally so
[32:38] even to live naturally you have to die
[32:40] what about spiritual Which is far beyond
[32:44] the natural life and if you have to live
[32:46] the spiritual life you have to Die daily
[32:49] you have to die to your sins you have to
[32:51] die to yourself you have to die to your
[32:54] pride you have to die to everything
[32:57] unlike Christ so that Christ can flow
[33:00] through you so he came for you and me he
[33:05] didn't have to have done that but we
[33:08] were the one supposed to die like
[33:11] Barabas they chose the
[33:14] murderer we are the Barabas you are
[33:17] supposed to die and he took Barabas
[33:20] place so that you and I can go free so
[33:25] he became us so that we can become him
[33:29] by his grace and mercy so when he died
[33:33] he conquered death grave and H and hell
[33:38] so you don't have to go through that he
[33:41] has done that for
[33:43] you death grave and hell were conquered
[33:47] by him so death where is your sin grave
[33:50] where is your Victory death has no power
[33:52] over you anymore sickness have no power
[33:55] over you anymore because he was wounded
[33:57] for your transgression he was bruised
[34:00] for your iniquities the chastisement of
[34:03] his peace was upon you by his stripes
[34:06] you were healed so the sickness have no
[34:09] power over you it's all according to
[34:12] your faith it's all according to what
[34:15] portion you accept because he even if
[34:17] the Lord Jesus Christ was to be standing
[34:20] here tonight and you say oh Lord I'm
[34:23] sick he cannot heal you because he has
[34:25] done it already a finished work it's
[34:29] only based on your
[34:31] acceptance and in life whatever you
[34:35] accept is that's what going to happen to
[34:40] you remember
[34:43] job
[34:45] everything that job was scared of it
[34:49] came and happened to him so
[34:53] whatever that you are scared whatever
[34:57] you are worried it will come to you but
[35:00] God has shed his blood no matter what
[35:03] you are going through you don't have to
[35:05] worry because God has taken control you
[35:09] have to give God thanks you have to give
[35:11] him praise as Bovi spoke that that time
[35:13] that when you give thanks all the all
[35:15] the Ws of Jericho will break it's going
[35:17] to break loose all those WS will break
[35:20] loose so when you are going through a
[35:22] problem going through a situation the
[35:24] devil is what he never G up but you also
[35:28] have to show him that you are not going
[35:29] to give up you are a son of God so you
[35:32] have to stand on the word of God and
[35:34] make your G straight forward and keep on
[35:36] shooting keep on firing keep on standing
[35:39] on the word of God and let him know that
[35:41] you a Son of God you are far better than
[35:44] what he's trying to bring onto you but
[35:46] like listen when the male man bring you
[35:49] a
[35:50] post that letter if you don't accept you
[35:53] can send it back to the sender because
[35:55] if that thing is he's bringing you
[35:57] sickness say take your sickness back I
[35:59] send it back to you it's not for me
[36:01] don't sign for it because if you sign
[36:04] for it it's your property some people
[36:06] say my blood pressure my this if your
[36:08] property take it I remember one time
[36:11] when my wife was in a Shan and one of
[36:14] the guests they were saying that
[36:16] everybody have cancer cells in their
[36:18] system and this everybody has cancer but
[36:21] that's true he said I don't have cancer
[36:23] and they said no great Rose you have it
[36:25] he said I don't have it if you guys you
[36:27] guys have to take your cancer so what am
[36:30] I trying to say if you think you have it
[36:32] you accept it and keep on H magnifying
[36:35] it because as a man think in his heart
[36:39] so is he the enemy just put fears he
[36:42] bring all those things to bring fears so
[36:45] when you accept those fears it come unto
[36:49] you but he said that fear not little
[36:52] flock is your father's Kingdom pleasure
[36:55] to give you the kingdom om and that
[36:57] kingdom is within you and me so you have
[37:01] that Kingdom don't let the devil put any
[37:04] fears on you he's a
[37:06] scarecrow he always putting fears always
[37:09] saying this this will happen that will
[37:11] happen that will happen you say no God
[37:14] has done this God has done that for me
[37:16] God has done this God I'll give him
[37:18] praise I'll give him thanks for what he
[37:20] did for me when I was was sick he healed
[37:23] me one time he can heal me again he
[37:25] provide my need for me where there was
[37:27] no man he provide so he provide again
[37:30] God did this for me and that God will do
[37:31] it again and you stand on it and give
[37:34] him thanks and give him praise even
[37:36] though you can't see physically your
[37:37] eyes that things happening but give him
[37:40] praise anyhow and if you continue to
[37:42] worship him and give him the glory and
[37:44] the honor that thing will eventually
[37:48] come to pass the devil will run away
[37:51] because you can't stand when a Son of
[37:53] God stand on the word of God you become
[37:56] a heart Pato to him amen so let's stand
[38:00] on the word of God and just believe and
[38:04] trust God
[38:06] Amen Hallelujah
[38:09] and as we read in that
[38:14] scripture
[38:16] um I
[38:18] think the Matthew that says that the
[38:21] first Commandments if you read in Mark
[38:23] said that the Lord your God is one
[38:29] God God has never been three he's one
[38:33] living god Jehovah of the Old Testament
[38:37] is the Jesus Christ of the New Testament
[38:40] then Jehovah Witness people said that we
[38:43] have a mighty God and almighty God
[38:48] but Isaiah chter said the Virgin shall
[38:51] conceive his name Shall be Called
[38:53] counselor Prince of Peace Mighty God
[38:56] ever Everlasting father the kingdom
[38:58] shall be on his shoulders there's no God
[39:01] after him but if you go to Revelation 18
[39:05] He said that Jesus Christ who was who is
[39:09] to come the Lord God Almighty so he's
[39:13] the almighty God and the Mighty God
[39:16] there is none before him there's none
[39:18] after him here oh Israel the Lord your
[39:21] God is one God and his name is the Lord
[39:25] and savior Jesus Christ amen so the
[39:28] scripture say you shall love this God
[39:30] whose name is the Lord Jesus Christ with
[39:33] all your mind with all your heart with
[39:37] all your soul in Mark said with all your
[39:40] strength you should love and the the the
[39:42] good thing is about this you cannot love
[39:45] God unless he first love you and because
[39:49] he first love you first and you
[39:52] recognize what he has done for you then
[39:55] you will love him with everything within
[39:58] you your conscience your subconscious
[40:02] everything has to love this God because
[40:06] what he has done for you and me we
[40:10] cannot pay it but we are doing a little
[40:13] thing to what express our appreciation
[40:17] to this Mighty God that we love because
[40:21] he love us more than what we can even
[40:24] what talk about so he should love with
[40:27] everything within you in the past the
[40:31] people used to have Idols um in Africa
[40:36] they still have it they carve the things
[40:38] and they worship them a physical thing
[40:41] but in no here I think they C in the
[40:44] French Revolution they kill all the
[40:46] wites at that time everything so here
[40:48] you don't have like physical thing that
[40:51] they worship as Idols anymore but in
[40:54] Africa they even getting rid of most of
[40:56] them now
[40:58] but what is going on is that people
[41:01] don't have the physical thing that they
[41:04] have made with hands that they worship
[41:05] in the past but a lot of people have
[41:07] Idols that they are worshiping without
[41:10] even being aware of some of them are
[41:12] worshiping their wives some are
[41:14] worshiping their husband some are
[41:16] worshiping their cast some are
[41:18] worshiping their job their job becomes
[41:22] important that coming the coming to um
[41:27] coming to worship God or coming to
[41:29] congregate themselves with one another
[41:32] the their job become priority the word
[41:36] of God remember that anything that you
[41:40] think on it
[41:43] constantly it becomes your God because
[41:45] that becomes your priority somewhere the
[41:49] prophet of God said check what you are
[41:50] thought hourly by hourly and see what
[41:53] you are feeding on what your becomes
[41:56] what you you becomes what you think your
[41:59] thoughts is speak more louder in heaven
[42:03] than your words so what are you thinking
[42:07] right now sometimes it gets so bad if
[42:10] you are not even careful when we are in
[42:13] the church we thinking about the
[42:14] business but we are doing this thing
[42:17] that thing the Devil is a is is a is is
[42:20] is a fighter he will come and torment
[42:22] your mind and bring so many thoughts
[42:24] things that are not even necessary but
[42:27] like our ENC when we come to here our
[42:30] main priority is to worship God so you
[42:33] have to purpose in your heart that
[42:35] whatever happens during the daytime you
[42:38] are not focusing on that you throw that
[42:40] out of the way he going to bring it to
[42:42] your mind but you reject it and
[42:44] consecrate and concentrate on the word
[42:47] of God that is coming by singing with
[42:49] Revelation singing with understanding
[42:52] listen to the word with an open heart
[42:55] and just focus on on God don't let
[42:57] nothing hinder you because that's what
[42:59] he's doing little forces by the time
[43:02] maybe you leave here you might not even
[43:04] live with nothing because he has worried
[43:06] you and placed so many things that is
[43:09] not of value in your mind because the
[43:12] greatest battle that ever thought
[43:13] thought is going on in their mind even
[43:15] right now so what are you thinking right
[43:19] God knows all your thoughts so we have
[43:22] to we have power as the prophet of God
[43:25] said that you cannot stop that bear from
[43:27] flying but you have the power to what to
[43:30] stop it from
[43:32] what feeding on um nesting on you so you
[43:37] have the authority you have the power
[43:40] you have the
[43:41] choice is according to your choice so
[43:44] let's put God first let's God become my
[43:48] priority no wonder because as a true
[43:51] Christian I believe you are a bride of
[43:53] Christ we have reached that place just
[43:56] like Peter he said that Lord we have
[43:58] left our mother our father our children
[44:01] everything and followed you what are we
[44:04] going to get he said there's no one that
[44:07] has left mother father children and and
[44:11] job and whatever and follow me that will
[44:13] not be blessed in this present world and
[44:16] the world to come so once you have made
[44:19] that commitment God is under obligation
[44:22] to bless you how is going to come I
[44:25] can't explain
[44:26] but my God is an awesome God he's a God
[44:29] that will supply all your needs he will
[44:32] take care of you once you put him first
[44:37] all that he want seeking first the
[44:38] kingdom of God and his righteousness all
[44:41] other that things shall be added unto
[44:44] you he's a mighty God he never lose a
[44:46] battle he's God that loves us more than
[44:49] what we can even think or imagine or
[44:52] Phantom he is a mighty God he said that
[44:56] you see the thought that God have for
[44:58] you is not an evil thought he has a good
[45:02] thought on you to give you peace and to
[45:05] give what unexpected end that's how God
[45:09] loves you his thought for you is
[45:12] phenomenal amen so we on our part
[45:17] shouldn't let
[45:19] anything
[45:21] hinder because I'm
[45:24] afraid we've been hanging around with
[45:27] lot of culture and traditions and so
[45:29] many things it's we are still hanging on
[45:32] things family this I'm not saying that
[45:35] neglect your family I'm not saying that
[45:39] don't take care of your parents I'm not
[45:41] saying that don't take care of your
[45:44] children but when it get to a
[45:47] place that those things become more
[45:50] priority to you than worshiping and
[45:53] serving your God then you have to watch
[45:57] because those things the lord giveth the
[46:00] Lord take blessed be the name of the
[46:02] Lord It's God that gave those things to
[46:04] you in the first place without him we
[46:07] didn't have
[46:08] nothing we came here with nothing and we
[46:10] living here with our character so we
[46:13] don't want to be too attached as one
[46:15] time bra said that every child when he
[46:17] comes he's like this he's com to grab
[46:20] they make their hands like this when
[46:21] they are born when they are dead boom
[46:24] they leave everything behind
[46:26] you're not going with nothing so our
[46:29] priority has to be God don't let
[46:34] nothing come between you and your God
[46:38] that's why David said that I'll put the
[46:41] lord always before my face he's always
[46:45] conscious of God that's what the
[46:48] Believers we are we are conscious of God
[46:50] that's why in the job we singing We
[46:52] thanking God we praising God what do you
[46:55] think you are doing doing the spirit of
[46:57] God in you is what unconscious godliness
[46:59] is flowing through you amen because
[47:03] listen in life that's why the Bible said
[47:06] that come and buy from me without money
[47:12] without price is
[47:14] free satisfing God he's given everything
[47:17] to us to free without money without what
[47:21] without price he's giving us to us for
[47:24] free better thing of it
[47:27] is you don't have to pay anything for it
[47:31] but what is happening is that all other
[47:34] things that we are fighting for none of
[47:39] them have that satisfaction to the end
[47:43] it doesn't satisfy it for that
[47:46] long listen you can build a brand new
[47:49] house today in 20 years it crumbled you
[47:53] have to do renovate and try to bring it
[47:55] back a new car after 10 years it's
[47:57] crumbled you bought a new watch it means
[48:00] so much to you after a while that
[48:03] satisfaction it
[48:05] erods but there's one
[48:08] satisfaction that can never get eroded
[48:12] the presence of God when God visits you
[48:14] when he reveal himself to you when that
[48:16] went I don't know how to explain it your
[48:20] sometimes your mind become so sweet I
[48:23] don't know I don't know to how to put
[48:25] wor in it and that satisfaction never
[48:29] eroles it's Everlasting
[48:31] Eternal so that's what we are fighting
[48:34] for that's what's most vital the rest
[48:38] are good we are on this Earth we need
[48:41] them don't get me wrong we need our ni
[48:44] house our nice houses we need our cars
[48:47] we need our family we need everything
[48:49] but those things are bonuses that God
[48:52] has given to us that shouldn't become a
[48:56] priority I believe that job Focus was
[48:59] right because all the rich and
[49:04] everything that God gave to job those
[49:08] things was not attached to him so when
[49:12] the devil attack and took everything he
[49:15] didn't also leave God because why he
[49:18] said the Lord give it and the Lord take
[49:20] it blessed be the name of the Lord every
[49:24] Christian
[49:26] everyone that comes to God you going to
[49:28] be tried and tested sometimes the try
[49:32] gets so hard but don't give up God knows
[49:37] what he's doing he overcome your trials
[49:40] he overcome your Temptations he can
[49:42] bring friction to your marriage and your
[49:44] marriage will be tested your everything
[49:46] will be tested to the core but listen
[49:50] because greater is he that is in you you
[49:53] overcome all those because he overcome
[49:55] he conquered he will conquer for you but
[49:58] when you are going through those things
[50:00] not easy but also shaping you that's why
[50:03] BR preached that all things work
[50:06] together for good to them that love God
[50:08] Amen it's all working together it
[50:10] doesn't matter how it looks chaos like
[50:14] every birth is a mess but what comes out
[50:17] of it is beautiful it's Beauty so that
[50:20] it is
[50:21] so God should be our
[50:26] priority amen regardless nothing should
[50:30] come before you and the Mighty God
[50:35] hallelujah amen hallelujah our God is
[50:41] good and the second one is what love
[50:46] your neighbor as
[50:50] yourself that's the most important thing
[50:54] that's the part we have to
[50:58] do and it's not sometimes it's not
[51:03] easy when some people they get on your
[51:07] Des some people they do
[51:10] everything to get too
[51:13] frustrated but you know when Christ is
[51:16] in
[51:18] you he will help you and love the people
[51:23] anyhow you might get angry sometimes
[51:27] because the scripture said be angry and
[51:28] sin
[51:29] not you might react sometimes but don't
[51:33] look upon that God is looking to your
[51:36] heart so we should love one another and
[51:39] we also should live for one another
[51:42] because as Christ came to live for us so
[51:45] shall we also live for others
[51:48] Christianity is not to live for
[51:51] yourself I'm afraid in this part of the
[51:54] world and the time that you are living
[51:56] in it has become I I alone the people
[52:00] have become selfish just for
[52:04] themselves they don't care about anybody
[52:07] once they will make their money they
[52:09] will do things they don't care even if
[52:11] you going to die that is not their
[52:13] business and no
[52:23] wonder the bra Bram said
[52:26] when it's getting to the
[52:29] end there is not going to be any true
[52:32] love apart from the love of God in the
[52:36] bride not the
[52:37] church churches have all kind of people
[52:41] but the bride of Christ within that
[52:43] confines of that church that's why you
[52:45] going to have a pure love because they
[52:48] are part of God so they can love one
[52:52] another without that you they cannot
[52:56] have it if they are make believers they
[52:58] can't have because it's a love you Satan
[53:01] cannot
[53:02] laugh but God is love and if you are
[53:05] part of God you going to have that pure
[53:08] love but he said the people heart going
[53:10] to be what heartless he said parents
[53:14] against children children against
[53:16] parents brother against things that are
[53:18] going on it is happening right
[53:23] now people are
[53:25] heartless killing doing all kind of
[53:28] wicked things that you can't even
[53:30] Phantom it because
[53:34] listen and God is keeping the this thing
[53:38] because the bride is still
[53:40] around once you live over here it's
[53:43] going to be chaos and I believe that
[53:45] everything's fading Within part of it
[53:49] manifesting right in the eyes people
[53:51] killing even right now last to turn to
[53:53] somebody just a b station they just p p
[53:56] kill him for nothing like people is like
[53:59] you don't know what is going on but the
[54:02] love of God is only within the bride of
[54:06] Christ apart from the true bride of
[54:09] Christ who were ordained before the
[54:11] foundations of the world be Sons and
[54:14] Daughters of God you can never have a
[54:16] true love because so many people that
[54:21] kind of feel love when they do something
[54:24] for you they expecting something back
[54:27] but a true love of God in somebody's
[54:29] heart when he does something he doesn't
[54:31] expect nothing
[54:33] back he doesn't he didn't do it because
[54:36] you do me good I do you good it's good
[54:39] to pay people back when they do you good
[54:42] but when they treat you bad and
[54:45] everything and you can in your heart
[54:47] pray for them and recognize that the
[54:50] devil that is hiding there to attack you
[54:53] you project rejecting that love of God
[54:56] because you are living for them and
[54:59] that's what we are doing in the prayer
[55:01] meeting
[55:02] remember the people in Sodom and gomorra
[55:06] they were wor as wor can be their life
[55:09] do you think Abraham didn't know the
[55:11] life that the sodomite people were
[55:14] living he knew
[55:16] everything but when God approached him
[55:19] and said I'm going to destroy Sodom he
[55:22] interceded for them he oh God if there
[55:25] 50 will you destroy them he said if I
[55:29] found 50 I not destroy Abraham was
[55:32] interceding even though they were wrong
[55:34] as strong can be and so is a bride of
[55:39] Christ we are also doing that in his way
[55:44] do you think what is going on the prayer
[55:46] meeting when people have needs and they
[55:48] come to you and you intered what are you
[55:50] doing you doing exact same thing some of
[55:53] them your friends your family you know
[55:56] the life they are leading maybe you have
[55:58] witnessed to them years and years they
[56:00] won't listen but the love of God In Your
[56:03] Heart Makes You intercede for them when
[56:05] you see they are getting trouble you
[56:07] can't even sleep like Moses Israel was
[56:10] strong strong as strong can be and God
[56:13] wanted to wipe the whole people out and
[56:16] raise the people from Moses he said Lord
[56:19] kill me first he put himself as on the
[56:23] ground interceded for them why it was
[56:26] Christ in Moses so when Christ is in you
[56:30] you will do those things what
[56:33] automatically you don't fight for it or
[56:35] you don't go and read in the Bible and
[56:37] the Bible said I should do that
[56:39] unconsciously you are part of God so you
[56:42] do all those things
[56:44] unconsciously crying for your neighbors
[56:47] crying interceding praying all night for
[56:50] your family member that are sick or
[56:52] suffering you know they are wrong we
[56:55] know they are not listening to
[56:56] you sometimes they even rebel against
[56:59] you but you still love them many ways
[57:03] you can't sleep if they are your
[57:07] children that's the way between us and
[57:10] God so when your kids Rebel and they do
[57:14] things remember your relationship with
[57:16] God before he call you before you became
[57:19] a true we recognize who you really are
[57:23] we were stubborn some of us was were
[57:25] doing all kind of stuff but at that time
[57:28] God ring the
[57:30] eye and like the prodal stand when you
[57:33] recognized who we are and came he wasn't
[57:37] angry he was very happy and gave us the
[57:41] best Cal give us the best protection
[57:43] give us the best D the best of the best
[57:46] that's how God
[57:49] lovees and he make a way for
[57:52] us so our God is is
[57:55] good all the time he good God and he L
[57:59] us more than what we can even think so
[58:03] let's love one another let's intercede
[58:06] for one another let's press on because
[58:10] the thing of fa is like
[58:13] Abraham when God called him he called
[58:17] Abraham
[58:19] alone but Abraham took L took his dad
[58:25] took this and God could not bless
[58:29] Abraham until first his dad died and
[58:34] secondly until he separate himself from
[58:37] lot then God open up the windows and
[58:39] show him what he has in store for him so
[58:43] sometimes if you are not getting your
[58:46] blessings and things are not going on
[58:48] you got to check your life maybe you
[58:51] holding on to something that God wants
[58:54] you to get rid of it because the word of
[58:57] God to call us for total separation from
[59:01] unbelief unbelieving God's word total
[59:05] separation not to separate yourself from
[59:07] one from one another but total
[59:09] separation from everything that is
[59:12] unbelieved to God's word so you have to
[59:15] check and see that you are not holding
[59:18] on to things because God wants us wants
[59:22] separation separate us amen so we got to
[59:26] do that we got to search we got to
[59:28] search our life in the heart and see
[59:31] what this God has installed for us so
[59:33] that we are not hindering our own
[59:37] blessing because sometimes it's our own
[59:40] thing that hinder the blessings but God
[59:44] wants to bless us more he wants to do
[59:47] exceedingly abundantly more than what we
[59:49] can even think or imagine Hallelujah hey
[59:54] amen so what am I saying
[59:57] that we are going
[1:00:00] through no matter what you are going
[1:00:02] through that Lily he's always there
[1:00:05] struggle to help the
[1:00:07] people just like Naomi and
[1:00:12] Ruth some people when God called
[1:00:15] them and they started going through a
[1:00:18] lot of trials they just give up they
[1:00:22] don't want to go all the way to the end
[1:00:24] end like opah but Ruth has that attitude
[1:00:31] he said that your people will be my
[1:00:33] people your God will be my God where you
[1:00:37] sleep there will I sleep amen she went
[1:00:41] all the
[1:00:42] way and when she went all the way not
[1:00:46] only that she was
[1:00:50] obedient to what to
[1:00:52] Naomi so it is God to us one time I read
[1:00:58] this Abraham was so caught up with a
[1:01:02] love which is the last
[1:01:04] Capstone he was caught up with love of
[1:01:07] God that before the seats were open he
[1:01:11] preached that the evidence of the Holy
[1:01:13] Ghost is love which love is those fruits
[1:01:16] that manifest automatically go love with
[1:01:20] everything but over
[1:01:23] here
[1:01:26] let me
[1:01:30] see okay I'm just want to read this
[1:01:33] first before I come to where where I
[1:01:36] okay that's
[1:01:39] fine yeah over
[1:01:42] here he said now that's what we were
[1:01:45] talking the other day the evidence of
[1:01:47] the Holy Ghost see in in broken system
[1:01:51] 64726 e now that's what we was talking
[1:01:55] the other day the evidence of the Holy
[1:01:58] Ghost see the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:00] is when you can receive the word not
[1:02:03] some system but have a clear
[1:02:07] understanding how do you know the word
[1:02:09] is clear understand it watch it
[1:02:12] vindicate itself well you say I see this
[1:02:16] do it and that oh yes we live the same
[1:02:19] way see but it's got to be the entire
[1:02:23] word to be the bride you have to be part
[1:02:25] of him he is the word and what part of
[1:02:28] him is it the word that is Promised for
[1:02:31] this day when he calls his bride be a
[1:02:34] part of that um be a part of that you
[1:02:38] get it Hallelujah and then over here
[1:02:41] said Jesus said never said when the Holy
[1:02:44] Ghost come you speak with thums he never
[1:02:47] said the Holy Ghost come you do any of
[1:02:49] those things but he said he will take
[1:02:52] these things of mine and show them to
[1:02:55] you and will show you things that to
[1:02:58] scam there is a genuine evidence of the
[1:03:02] Holy Ghost According To Jesus himself so
[1:03:06] the Gen evidence to recognize what God
[1:03:08] is doing for your day and what go leave
[1:03:11] it and if you recognize that in that
[1:03:14] package you automatically love your
[1:03:16] enemies and pray for those that hate you
[1:03:19] because love is part of the package so
[1:03:23] what I'm trying to say that token said
[1:03:25] that total obedience to the word of God
[1:03:28] entitles you to what the token so what
[1:03:31] Naomi was doing was that he was being
[1:03:35] obedient to Naomi Ruth was being
[1:03:39] obedient to Naomi when she told her to
[1:03:42] go and what um in the
[1:03:47] field to
[1:03:49] glean she
[1:03:51] obeyed she didn't she didn't
[1:03:54] resist she didn't say that oh I was a
[1:03:58] princess back in uh Moab you expect me
[1:04:02] to go and glean in the field when
[1:04:04] there's nothing and it was even shame
[1:04:07] for her to do that but she obeyed that
[1:04:10] word of God and I know it's a gleaning
[1:04:14] tie but God want us to also witness
[1:04:19] anyhow he said gleaning but he wants us
[1:04:22] to and remember Noah preach for 120
[1:04:26] years he only got eight people of his
[1:04:30] family so Naomi Ruth was obedient to
[1:04:36] Naomi and even when he was giv the
[1:04:40] instructions to go and sleep by the
[1:04:45] feet of uh
[1:04:47] boas that was like a disgrace could be
[1:04:50] like like a prute doing that but she's
[1:04:53] she OB obeyed so what I'm trying to say
[1:04:56] that obedience to the full word of God
[1:05:01] entitles you to the token and if you
[1:05:03] love God you obey his Commandments it's
[1:05:07] simple as as simple as that so obedience
[1:05:10] is better than
[1:05:13] sacrifice and the love of God in you
[1:05:16] will let you obey God's word it's not
[1:05:20] going to be a friction because remember
[1:05:24] When you entered into his rest you are
[1:05:27] it's no more you it's Christ in you
[1:05:31] living his life through you is Christ in
[1:05:34] the bride we have come to rest place
[1:05:37] that we have come to a place that we are
[1:05:39] resting on him we recognize that we
[1:05:42] ourselves we are nothing without him so
[1:05:45] he is the one riding the train in us he
[1:05:47] is the one doing everything he is the
[1:05:50] one Healing The Sick he's the one
[1:05:52] raising the dead TR he's the one
[1:05:54] everything that we are doing is not us
[1:05:57] it's him that is doing it it's not the
[1:05:59] mountain that is Holy but the Holy Ghost
[1:06:01] on the mountain that makes it holy it's
[1:06:04] not the people that's why the acts of
[1:06:07] the Holy Ghost in the apostles it wasn't
[1:06:10] Peter that made the difference but
[1:06:12] Christ in Peter that makes the
[1:06:14] difference so he is the one riding the
[1:06:17] trail and we are resting on that word of
[1:06:21] God because it's him it's him before we
[1:06:26] are trying to do things by our own s i
[1:06:28] can pray this I can do that it's good to
[1:06:31] pray it's good to fast it's good to do
[1:06:33] all those things but if he is not in is
[1:06:36] all in vain you cannot pray one time I
[1:06:40] was looking for something and I keep on
[1:06:44] praying and bugging God and bugging God
[1:06:47] and praying and one time in the morning
[1:06:52] I had a voice
[1:06:55] Simon's voice and say that you cannot
[1:06:59] tell God what to
[1:07:02] do then I give up but the problem of it
[1:07:06] is sometimes you want to change God's
[1:07:09] mind you want to tell God what to do but
[1:07:13] remember his ways are higher than our
[1:07:16] ways his thoughts aree than our thought
[1:07:20] so we have to surrender our ways and our
[1:07:23] thought to him so that he can have
[1:07:26] preeminence he can have his perfect way
[1:07:28] in our lives because once you a son of
[1:07:32] daughter of God you are never going to
[1:07:34] have it your own way because you want to
[1:07:38] go your way is going to go through the
[1:07:39] hard way and you're still going to turn
[1:07:42] you around so I want God's way to be my
[1:07:46] way though the road be rough and steep
[1:07:50] but he leads me I will go I want God's
[1:07:53] way way to be my way because his ways is
[1:07:58] perfect it's
[1:08:00] clear amen so we have to get to that
[1:08:03] place and recognize and I believe that
[1:08:07] the bride of Christ has come to that
[1:08:11] rest and we know that we know that is
[1:08:15] not any human being anymore but is God
[1:08:19] himself doing it so we have to surrender
[1:08:24] to him so he can have full
[1:08:27] preeminence amen God is
[1:08:30] good he's a wonderful God Amen he never
[1:08:35] changed hallelujah praise
[1:08:38] God okay so I'm just going to conclude
[1:08:41] it with Mr Lily again
[1:08:47] hallelujah hallelujah our god is

[1:09:04] hallelujah
[1:09:07] okay and over here he
[1:09:10] said what we need
[1:09:13] today is the Life of
[1:09:18] Christ inside of
[1:09:21] us that's what p
[1:09:24] ifies not the
[1:09:28] outward a turn around color or a degree
[1:09:33] of
[1:09:34] psychology or something or something it
[1:09:38] takes the power of resurrected Christ to
[1:09:42] make us what we should be God had no
[1:09:46] other plan than to let the Holy Spirit
[1:09:50] Rule and reign in the church chur is the
[1:09:55] Holy Ghost ruling and reigning in the
[1:09:59] Church of the Living God a True Church
[1:10:03] of God is led by the Holy Ghost not by
[1:10:08] mind not by um bunch of men is led by
[1:10:13] the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost lead
[1:10:15] it where it listed he can move the
[1:10:18] church any way he wants the spirit of
[1:10:21] Christ it has to have the prent
[1:10:24] and move and do what it wants to do and
[1:10:28] the children the people that followed it
[1:10:30] have come to that place that they gave
[1:10:32] God the preeminence so they become
[1:10:35] prisoner of Christ you have no not no
[1:10:39] you don't have your thought anymore the
[1:10:42] very mind that was in Christ is now in
[1:10:45] you it's no more your thought it's no
[1:10:48] more your mind he has taken
[1:10:51] control of your mind of your actions

[1:10:57] bright is the the is the bride of Christ

[1:11:05] have surrendered to him door to the
[1:11:07] heart is not only that he has the
[1:11:12] preeminence only or not only is he Our
[1:11:15] Savior but he is our Lord and Lord means
[1:11:20] rulership so he is the one ruling Our
[1:11:23] Lives
[1:11:24] he is the one in control over everything
[1:11:28] we are doing and we are grateful we are
[1:11:31] thankful that his grace and mercy has
[1:11:34] brought us thus far amen so I'm just
