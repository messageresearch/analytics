========================================
he goes to a phone booth comes out right kind of same idea it's the Feast of booths Hallelujah that so it's true though Saints but think about it that people don't do not understand it we don't even understand how do I describe to you well I'm going to give you the one of the greatest evidences that I'm going in a Rapture I'm going to have a body change I'm going to give you that you ready yeah there's such a deep deep longing and hunger and calling from my insides of my insides I've got to hear God's word I am hungry for it I thirst for it I can't imagine going a day without reading it and if I do I I realize it I might go a day and miss it by a mistake and I'm like wow I haven't even read God's word in the last 48 hours something's wrong something really starts to churn in you I got to Feast I need to get to church I'm hungry I'm thirsty I've got to be bed why because there's a body in you spiritual DNA it's all there it's got to happen it's going to take over all the atoms in your body and rearrange them Hallelujah even the sub atoms and rearrange all that and become a permanent 20-year-old that can never be changed or destroyed in fact you'll have an indestructible body amen hallelujah say oh brother 60 years now we got people turning against the uh you know the message says be vulnerable just be vulnerable it's okay if you're hanging upside down in a cocoon you're not doing anything you're not doing much seems like we're not doing much yeah we're not doing maybe not you're just hanging there You're vulnerable some bird come and eat you right you could fall off you just we're in that stage Saints we're in that stage where there's a veil over the bride and nothing can touch you right now it's okay but it seems a little crazy going on in the world right now but you're you're you're just hanging there just for a little bit but I promise you there's an unveiling coming the midst Jesus Christ fail is just going to start rolling off it's going to start rolling off amen because it's it's fulfilling the wedding it's rolling off she's Mrs Jesus Christ going to roll up and the most beautiful Monarch Wings Hallelujah you are royalty right the most beautiful wings are going to be showing up and they're already there they're already there it's just a matter of moments now we're getting very close amuah do you believe it so I don't doubt any of these people people's uh experiences uh but I can I can relate some to some of their some of the other impossibility and and difficulty to be accurate try to explain God's glory and his presence I want to share with you a couple of things and I'm going to go ahead and close but I was 6 years old when I was aware of God's presence um I I remember laying on my bed and just talking to God and some of you could relate to this when you were young like that or a little bit older but something happened to you in your life where you there was something that woke up in you and you just realize there has to be God there has to be there something there's some strange awareness in your life of of you're either missing something or you're missing someone and it's God and you might even try to satify that with alcohol with drugs with friends girlfriend boyfriend wife husband all kinds of things children and nothing satisfies nothing replaces it it's a deeper hunger it cannot be met by any other human me and it's so deep uh and it's so Indescribable but you sense that that's what it is so six years of age I just had that start to come out of me and I was being very strongly aware that God existed and I had these conversations every night before going to bed with God and I I never I prayed I mean we prayed we were kids we were taught to pray but it wasn't until I was 16 that I had a true experience of Salvation I remember we were at a convention and um in this uh big Rada end that we were at had what was called an arcade room they don't have that anymore but it was an arcade room you put quarters in and you play games which is great for a 16-year-old and all my friends the other ones that were in this church they were uh doing that with me but instead of spending our own money we figured out we found a way that you can pull the back off of the game the machine and scoop the quarters out of the box just easy danger oh I was on Dangerous Ground believe me and in order you know we we didn't think we were doing anything wrong now I guess not right we were hiding the quarters in Coke can so you have an empty Coke can you can put 72 quarters in there and so we were in the at the end of the second service where they were preparing for the whole entire U meetings and they said we want everybody to make a 100% commitment everybody in this congregation come on and pray at least 10 minutes come up and pray at least 10 minutes and that will really get us into the Revival that need to be so we all we passed a note back and forth all of us guys all right 10 minutes let's go pray mom and dad will be happy then we'll go meet at the arcade room so we went up to this altar whatever we were praying and I was just sitting there praying and I looked at my watch 9 Minutes one more to go I wasn't praying I don't know what I was doing and it was in that last minute at 10 minutes that something happen that is hard to describe but I could see Jesus on the cross you know here I was raised in a message my whole life but I don't remember hardly anything that was ever preached this is really something that happens to the kids the young people they actually don't really remember much of what's preached Sunday school is a good thing we didn't have Sunday school but I didn't remember what was but all I know is I experienced seeing Jesus on Calvary and my sins disrespecting my parents disobedience lying cheating doing all kinds of crazy stuff was coming off of me and going on to him he was becoming more burdened with the weight of it and in pain and suffering and crying out and I was becoming more relieved of all my sins it wasn't anything I was asking him to do it was just something he was doing amen and I cried and I I was there for four hours you know puddle of you know puddle he melted me down and uh and he changed me I I I received salvation right then and there listen sints you raise your kids in this message doesn't mean they're saved [Music] one that's right it's never changed they got to meet Jesus Hallelujah I forget who was it might have been Spurgeon it might have been somebody else might have been Moody but one of those guys was raised with with a mother who would they would eat their meal then have devotions and they would read the Bible and she would close the book and she would pray a usual a prayer but this one particular time she prayed when he was 7 years old she said Lord God that my son is 7 years old he's heard the gospel over and over and over again and she says and I know that if he rejects it I'm the one who will have to reject him and send him to hell she said I don't want to do that that would break my heart as a mother she said if I do have to do it may that time be brief I couldn't stand it for more than just a minute or even more and as she cried and wept before God this little seven-year-old began to weep and he gave his heart to the Lord Jesus right there I'll tell you what keeps people from hell is Mama's prayers oh am Daddy's prayers that's what does it Hallelujah so saved at 17 at 16 and uh unfortunately a year later there was there was some manipulation and some things going on within the ranks of the ministry um in in the church that we were at and it just it impacted my family in a negative way and um I I I walked away I walked away from the church but that led to walking away from the message uh if the ministers can't live it how could I live it this was a devil's thought that came in my mind you know uh and and I walked away six years I was out there but God in his grace got a hold of me amen he got a hold of me and he brought me back and He restored me and one of the first things I did is I just start reading the Bible I just stayed with the Bible I still believe that God was God all these six years and I still believe that brother Brandon was a true prophet of God never doubted that I just felt like this message is is something that is very difficult for anybody to live it um and that was my struggle and I went through a quest in the world and a lot of other craziness but it was just what it was but uh as I was reading the Bible over a period of time God began to say listen to my message listen to the message and I began to listen to tapes and read my Bible together and connect those two and I got to 40 messages I finished 40 messages uh and it just struck me everything that this man is saying is right in the Bible everything everything I find it right in the word of God I searched it and uh that was it for me and I'm full fully full-fledged believer 100% and it was just a little bit after that that I was before God praying and seeking his presence and and um I want to tell you about the power of your pastor here and understand when I say that I'm not speaking about him but Christ that's in him and the gift that's in him but I was listening to a tape of another Minister uh who was preaching and quoting from the message and he was started to get into near the end of brother R's Ministry he started talking about something new in the science community in the bioscience Community called C called genetics and genetic code and genetic research and started saying that how brother bandam was like the scientist in a way and started digging into deeper things as as one Revelation open opens up the door to a lot of other Revelations these these doors are blocked by religious people but through a prophet we've had doors opening to us if one door opens it opens up other thing and it corrects all the errors it's amazing it's automatic it has to happen that way so he starts brother he starts talking about how he the prophet begins all in' 65 or so talking on a theme of C Gene you're a c Gene of God you know you're not just a thought of God you're actually part of God's genetic code amen hallelujah you're a part of God everybody understand that Hall that's that's why David said Lord restore unto me the joy of thy salvation you know people don't understand it exactly but in a way when when Adam when Adam gave up his life to save his wife Eve how many understands that's what happened he was not just saving Eve he was saving himself when Jesus was on the cross dying he wasn't just saving you he was saving himself right because he was redeeming his purpose he has a purpose going to happen he's a redeemer amen amen and so and so in that sense understand this that God's whole story the whole Plan of Salvation everything is Gods it belongs to him you just you and I are blessed part of it but there's something in you that's a part of him and that that Revelation started to strike me as I laid on my bed and and and all of a sudden the whole room began to become white it it it was lit up it was like a cloud had come into the room I became Frozen to my bed I couldn't move I couldn't speak God's presence was there and I could hear the preacher's voice and I could hear the prophet's voice and I could hear the voice of God you are my seed Jean you're my son you're my Offspring you're part of my it changed my life [Applause] s we have an identity crisis this whole world's in an identity crisis we have national identity crisis we have craziness going on and we have this it's true and in the message we have identitive crisis still but it has to come to this place and I hope right here maybe this morning someone right here is is really starting to impact your heart he's saying to me I'm his child I'm his CG I'm part of him he's part of me he can't let me be l lost the devil's been lying to me I can't be lost I'm part of him I know this it's [Applause] impossible have a hope within the veil an anchor amen am that that we are in him and we're in Christ and we're part of him so that really changed my life at at 24 years of age it's Indescribable I'm doing my best to share with you um from the time I was 19 to 25 I had a foot ailment I don't know even understand what it was but my uh the pediatrist that I was visiting um sent me the sports medicine and they said they were going to take a knife you know put me under the cut my cut my heels and shave and cut and I walked away I nobody's cutting me you're not cutting me leave leave me alone put your knife away buddy that's not going to happen but for for those years you know from 19 to 25 six years I I suffered with this foot illness it's a carryover you know when you go live out in the world you're going to you're going to pay for some things right and some things God's going to remove from you so by his grace um I was about 25 years old and I was listening to a message called the queen of the South I think it was 19 59 and I got to the healing line part of it was which is always the frosting on the cake for me I love that part don't you healing line amazing and I was just sitting there and I was and brother was going through the line and going through the line uh and I and I and I and the person he talked to and I didn't know this until till last year but the person he talked to just before this event that happenss with the tape was actually Katherine hickey anybody who know who Katherine hickey is she's a well-known Pentecostal charismatic t angelist look her up on YouTube but anyway she was she was actually the woman that was Barren that he prophesied she would have a baby so it's pretty cool pretty cool that I found that out later but here it was uh quite a few years ago when I was 25 I'm sitting there and he's he moves from the from the the heal the healing line he goes to the audience as he often did it says there's such a faith out there he says he says you over there he starts calling people and I just in my heart I just said Lord if I could have been there oh what an amazing thing I would have loved to even have been in the audience CU I'm just in so much pain takes me half hour I get the morning just to get my shoes on my ankles were swollen double triple size it's weird disease have when you're young you didn't even know what it was and I'm sitting there thinking this and all of a sudden he says young man sitting there you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ you have a foot trouble you're going to be healed believe the Lord Jesus [Applause] Christ God knock off the off onto the floor and I spent oh my and God healed me completely delivered me from this foot thing I couldn't run I couldn't barely walk in fact I worked for a shoe store for a while and the owner finally says why don't you go get another job I mean he says it's not because you're not good you're good but I hate to see you suffer I think a bad advertisement for you the shoes look at how they my brother-in-law called me Olympus he's a good but when God was ready and it was in his time he did something Indescribable he did something that you can't even put together in your own head you know there was a time when I was going to preach uh up in Canada over in Montreal and um I had a message in mind to preach called show me your face you know how Moses said Show Me Your Glory and God say you see my Lord you can't see my face so there's a song written by Paul Wilbur Who is uh part of Israel's hope a singing group Messianic Jewish singers which is they believe in Christ and Jesus is Christ and at any rate I I love that song and I think it ties in well have you ever heard that song brother Simon show me your face beautiful beautiful song you you've got to listen to it talks about moving past veils and going into the holy of holies to see God's face and I was going to I had this whole message based on that idea show me your face and um I thought you know I'm going to bring this song with me u i I copied it carefully on CD I stashed it away so that when I made my trip i' bring it with me and I thought I'll have the young people learn it so they can sing it in French because in montal you speak French so I had this great plan in my head and so the day came and I'm on my way and I'm driving up to Canada um halfway through Vermont and um I start thinking about this song and I say I started to down on me I left the CD home totally I oh it would have been so nice so I just let it go and I'm sitting in the office and I'm praying about the two messages I'm going to preach and which one I'm going to preach and I had two on mine I show me your face and another one called restoring the altar rehealing the altar as as you know Elijah did and I'm sitting there and all of a sudden I'm hearing this music in French young people young youth chir s show me your face how do you do that how do you even plan that stuff can't plan it come on God your whole life figured out you can't change your destiny and all that he's already got all all you are all we're here to do is Discover it and develop it and enjoy the ride and get there amen so they're singing and well you know what I preach right you have an idea okay good another time I remember we were traveling wife wife and I were heading down to Tennessee because uh she was from Tennessee and brother Donnie Reagan's church and he married us and dedicated our kids and all that stuff but anyway we were going to go down there so I had a preacher for her for the weekend and we were just going down there to visit family and I was having that weekend off I wasn't going to be preaching at all so Friday evening I'm in the word I'm in the word the Lord has anointed me I'm I'm preparing I'm preparing I think brother Chris forong knows and experienced something similar to this but I Was preparing and my wife comes she goes we gotta leave in the morning and you're in here studying why are you studying you're not preaching this weekend I said I don't know why but I feel like I just need to do this she said okay so I prepared and we went down and as soon as we got there uh on Saturday uh I believe it was brother Donnie Reagan saw me driving in and he runs over he says he says brother elah there's been a bad accident's family has been uh in a terrible train accident did you take service I said sure I'm ready I was ready but I really didn't know how that was going to happen but God already knew so we just have to be very good and very good stewards that when God's leading to do something get ready to do it doesn't mean you can describe it it doesn't mean you know how to put it together in words but just get out there and do the best that you can do so I'm going to close with that um how many loves him with all your heart amen [Applause] he's got all in control he's got all in control he's got everything mapped out perfectly perfectly you won't miss so all our worry and all our stress is nothing uh and don't even think don't even let it come into your mind about you know oh man these people they're saying that the cloud was from a from a Thor rocket and and all this stuff and uh you know all this stuff and you know these things [Music] saints come on let's be honest and by the way just so you know I did the research I spent hundreds of hours looking at all the scientific explanations including uh Mr McDonald who they say didn't write a final report but I found his final report I've read it I've made a chart that shows that all the rocket fuels that were in that particular rocket could not have survived amen without dissipating immediately as a cloud at that height so unless they know they exist and don't want to talk about it or unless they just been dig even up find the information either way they're irresponsible and I'm not against people I'm just against the spirit that would try to come against us but don't let it f you don't let it body like some sometimes you say I don't really care if it was a cloud of a rocket or was a supernatural or either way I still believe God it was God you mean yeah that's okay you know that's like saying the light that led the wise man was probably planet know yeah that's what they say but I believe it was a supernatural light so I have the evidence the proof is I I went ahead and went at it as devil Devil's ad Advocate to try and prove that the cloud was made from a rocket and I spoke to uh different professors and directors of meteorology and universities and other men who are in physics and the a Astro Aerospace type of technology in areas like that I spoke to these gentlemen and it all comes down to the same thing they all said told me the very same thing this is a phenomenon it shouldn't be there amen hallelujah hallelujah but I'm excited you can't describe it's hard to understand it but God knows what he's doing Arizona was the one state out of any other state in one country out of any other country that God said to our to brother Adam go there and then this Cloud shows up in the same area what are the odds lots of odds against it why Arizona by the way anybody know why Arizona because it's the backside America is the back side of the world Arizona is the backside of America and it was on the back side of desert amen Arizona was the last state added to the continent of the United [Music] States last age last state praise the Lord amen amen why did the cloud show up this day and then 7 Days Later he's over here and well then why did Angels show up around Persia Babylon fighting a spiritual war when Daniel was way over here in another place and it was 21 days later because angels have to get access first and they can't do it without getting jurisdiction I don't know if you guys understand what the war is with the angels there's a war with angels and God's angels woring against Satan his angels and it's a jurisic war and it can only be overcome by the word of God it's a it's bid words Satan was fighting over the body of Moses why because it's jurisdiction he has the right to take them decompose them and kill him he can't let he doesn't want him raising again that would be terrible but we know Moses probably did because that's what the argument was about it took Michael to come on the scene to finish that battle off amen so it's about of warfare and you say why why why in the north Why didn't it come over this other area because because God is a god of mountains God chooses Mount Zion he chooses Mount Mariah he chooses mountains all the time and Satan always wants to do what God does so he chooses mountains you know the King on the mountain and so mountains High the highest mountains in any area is the jurisdiction demons live on mountains the Hy Indians the the nav Indians were all worshiping at a certain Mountain the highest mountain in Arizona is Mount Humphrey and that's where the cloud hovered over amen why there cuz seven angels need to beat up the angels that are standing around there by the way the H Indians and the Navajo Indians and the the other Indians there are all worship that God called the God of Thunder yeah the God of Thunder anyone know who the God of Thunder is right he's Thor from Europe and they just stole that from the Greeks who got it from the Jews not the Jews but from the worshippers of Baal Baal is a god of thunder go study it Bale is the God of Thunder Thor is a god of thunder right that's why I had to be a Thor rocket which God will you serve it's up to you either that's Jehovah God or that's Thor it's up to you I know who it was it's time to chop off some heads at the [Music] river CH off that mentality I think it might have been a rocket but I'm still a message believer okay fine maybe when you go on a Rapture it'll be a rocket too better go to Nassau right now St as for me in my house I'm going to serve the [Applause] Lord this happened in 1963 100 years earlier Arizona became a territory of the United States by Abraham Lincoln Abraham Lincoln made Arizona a territory in the United States and 100 years later a cloud shows up Abraham in the Bible 100 years later the Lord shows up when he's 100 right 9900 so the Lord shows up and and where's Abraham and why does the bible tell us this I don't know it seems weird it doesn't even make any sense he's sitting under the oak trees it says Plains of M but look it up brother talks about it he was sitting under the oak trees the oak trees M he just sitting under oak trees who cares do I care do you care who cares he's sitting under oak tree so what it's important it's in the Bible guess what Arizona means in the vast language is ancient root language of of Spanish The Basque language ER on means Hallelujah the place of the good amen hallelujah isn't that exciting amen yeah God has such a sense of humor and it's so amazing how he plans this stuff out am so perfect amen there's Abraham years later there it is and everything is happening perfectly and I want you to understand that when God was done deserting Sarah's laughing in her heart that he was deserting the hearts the end of the second pole was happening right then really was identified but it was happening but it was also moving into a third pole at that moment I'm going to visit you in the time of life the son is coming Hallelujah you understand that so he says this third poll what is it how did God identif that because God said shall I continue to keep secret the thing that I shall do God had a secret it was a mystery and it was time for the mystery to start opening up and as it began to open up make that known to Abraham because he says Abraham will be faithful to what I teach him and he'll teach his children Hallelujah and that mystery that was revealed to Abraham has impacted him so much that he ended up standing in the gap for Sodom yes didn't he yes he moved into he moved into a mediator Ministry third poll is a Ministry of mediatorship for God's people for the Abraham group amen it's moving into the little prayer closet GL praise God Satan hates you to read your Bible he hates you to go to church but he really hates it if you pray don't PR oh yeah Satan can take away your church he can take away your worship system he can take away your Bible he can take away all your message books and tapes and put you in jail and you have nothing you'll be next to Paul and Silas Hallelujah PA and silus could worship but what if you put duct tape or something B now you can't even speak but he cannot remove from you pray Hall ultimately here's your little room Hallelujah brother R was seeing in his vision the third po the big Tabernacle we know all that whole story the people coming up and then there's this platform not the platforms not done now the second Po's over the little tiny room off to the corner and everybody ask what about little room little room little room well he asked the question did anybody know that he asked the question why the little room anybody remember what was what he was told don't you love every time he ask a question the angel or whoever it was speaking to him always pointed back to the word of God it's great he said why the little room and this voice said did not our Lord say when you pray go into your closet in secret and God who sees in secret will reward you we hav't close to the third pole like we ought to but the third poll works like this while his wife was in the room to be opera on for cancer brother R was in a different state was all the way across the country and he was told to stand to his feet and to speak in prayer and he spoke and he said let the cancer the size of the Grave fruit disappear before the doctor even comes back to touch it and it happened just like that Saints I don't know about you but it could be loved ones it could be people who are believers around the world you don't even know who they are that God's going to bring in front of you amen and you're going to pray for them and they're going to be delivered amen and they're not even going to know how it happen you're not going to tell cuz the third poll is not is it's no longer a man show flesh is being taken out of the picture human efforts are taken out of the picture the days of of that is ending can you say that Sodom and gomorra lot didn't even have a clue that there was a man on the hill standing between God the judge of the quick and the dead and themselves called Abraham who was standing with one hand this way one that way standing there in the Gap praying in the third pole Ministry he got it he understood it what was it it was the spirit of Christ rose up in before God that's what you're supposed to do and I'm supposed to do we're supposed to rise up to the occasion because otherwise the mighty Angel has no other way to manifest himself except through the people of God Hallelujah Jesus Christ put on the land on the sea and he can only do it through are people who are dedicated to what this is and it's called very simply nothing that you get credit for you say oh I heard somebody got healed I saw a newspaper I was the one who pray for them it was you're not going to do that because true mature character in a person is what gives you the right and makes you fit to rule and reign with Jesus Christ or you're only going to give the glory to the Lord Jesus this isn't for you and it's not for me and it's not for brother Simon this is for Jesus Christ Hallelujah don't follow a man we follow the lord Jesus hallah brother please come I [Applause] appreciate God me to rescue him from the anointing that just make him continue swimming moving in the spirit of God hallelujah that's wonderful to see the hand of God upon our brother and a unique Indescribable Ministry amen uh the way the Lord uses him it's absolutely unique and Indescribable and we want to thank the Lord for that let's give God [Applause] praise our our brother was speaking I I just thought of this uh scripture which I'd like to read and I believe that this is Indescribable listen he says here and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and read the book neither to look there on and one of the elders said unto me we not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David has prevailed to open the book and loose the Seven Seals thereof praise the Lord I believe this is Indescribable amen and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb Indescribable as it had been slain having seven horns seven eyes which are the seven spirit of God sent forth unto all the Earth Indescribable and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book with four beasts and four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints in this cable and they sng a new song worthy Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the the seals thereof for thou H was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood blood out of every Kindred and town and people and nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and he shall reain on the earth hall hallelujah Indescribable this this Vision to think about it and I beheld and I heard a voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them was 10,000 time 10,000 thousand and thousands of thousands in other words Indescribable saying with a loud voice wordy is the Lamb that was SL to receive th riches wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the Earth and such as are in the SE and all that are in them heard I saying blessing honor amen glory and power be unto him that sth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and there and the four be said said amen and the four and 20 Elders fell down and worship him that liveth forever and ever thanks be to [Applause] God time John said another place and I heard a voice saying the marriage of the land has come and the wife has made herself ready praise God I believe that's in theb and I believe that when it says that we will be caught up and change okay brother uh use that wonderful analogy of the butterfly my God that's in describable think about it Brothers we can't put words to it said I saw a man the paradise he said I don't have words he says it's unspeakable he he couldn't disra it and that's where we are brothers and sisters we are right in that position right now we're just trying to use human words to describe something somebody and an event that is Indescribable wonderful praise the Lord hallu w
