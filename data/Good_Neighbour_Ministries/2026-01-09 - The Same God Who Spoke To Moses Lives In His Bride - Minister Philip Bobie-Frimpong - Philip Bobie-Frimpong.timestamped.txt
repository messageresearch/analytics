[0:00] Heat. Heat.
[0:21] Heat. Heat.
[1:12] Hey. Hey. Hey.
[2:24] Heat. Hey, Heat.
[4:10] Heat. Heat.
[5:01] Hallelujah. Welcome into the house of
[5:03] the Lord. Amen.
[5:06] Let's sing this song here. If words
[5:08] could fall like rain from this lips of
[5:11] mine. If I had a thousand years, I'd
[5:13] still run out of time. If you listen to
[5:16] our hearts, every beat would say, "Lord,
[5:18] I thank you for the truth. I thank you
[5:21] for the life. I thank you for it."
[5:26] Amen.
[5:29] If words can fall like rain
[5:36] from this lips of mine.
[5:42] And if I had a thousand years,
[5:48] I'll still run out of time
[5:53] if you listen to our hearts.
[5:59] But every beat would say,
[6:04] "Lord, I thank you for the truth. I
[6:08] thank you for the life. I thank you for
[6:12] the way.
[6:17] Listen to our hearts.
[6:22] Hear our spirits sing
[6:28] a song of praise that flows
[6:34] to those who have redeemed.
[6:40] We will use the words we know
[6:44] to tell you what an awesome God you are.
[6:51] Words are not enough.
[6:54] Tell you of our love.
[6:57] Listen to our hearts.
[7:02] And how do you explain?
[7:08] How do you describe
[7:13] a love that flows from east to west and
[7:17] runs as deep as it has wide
[7:25] Lord you know our hopes
[7:30] Lord you know our fears
[7:35] and words cannot express the love we
[7:39] feel. We'd love for you to hear.
[7:46] Oh, so listen to us.
[7:51] Oh,
[7:52] hear our spirits sing.
[7:57] A song of praise that flows
[8:03] from those who have redeemed.
[8:08] And we will use the words we know
[8:13] to tell you what an awesome God you are.
[8:19] No words are not enough to tell you
[8:24] love. So listen to our hearts. Let's
[8:28] sing a chorus again. Oh, so listen to
[8:32] our hearts.
[8:36] Hear our spirit sing.
[8:41] A song of praise that flows
[8:47] from those you have redeemed.
[8:52] And we will use the words we know to
[8:57] tell you what an awesome God you are.
[9:03] Words are not enough to tell you of our
[9:08] God. So listen to us.
[9:14] Isn't that true tonight?
[9:16] Amen. The Bible said that likewise the
[9:18] spirit also helpeth our infirmities. For
[9:20] when we know not what we should pray or
[9:23] we ought, but the spirit itself maketh
[9:25] intercession for us with groaning which
[9:27] cannot be uttered.
[9:29] Listen to our hearts. Amen.
[9:32] I've got a revelation
[9:36] of predestination.
[9:40] I've got a revelation.
[9:43] God is my father.
[9:47] tells me where I'm going. Tells me where
[9:53] I'm going. And the gates of hell to
[9:57] never prevail again.
[10:01] Say I've got reation
[10:05] of predestination.
[10:09] I've got a revelation.
[10:12] God is my father
[10:15] and he tells me where
[10:18] I came from. He tells me where I'm
[10:22] going. Under the gates of hell, you
[10:26] never prevail again.
[10:29] Oh, I've got a revelation
[10:34] of predestination.
[10:37] I've got a revelation.
[10:41] Oh, is my father
[10:44] who tells me where
[10:46] I came from and tells me where I'm going
[10:52] for the kids of can you never pre

[12:14] has brought us to your presence. Father,
[12:17] we invite you to come. Lord, as your
[12:21] servant, come Lord, take him aside. Oh

[12:42] pastor, bless each and everyone. Those
[12:46] that are sick, those that are needy,
[12:48] those that will be watching in line.

[12:53] your hands. Bless, oh God, all the
[12:58] believers. We commit all things into

[16:45] 10,000 reasons for my heart to find.

[17:23] How many could say he's rich in love and
[17:25] slow in anger?
[17:28] Oh man, we so grateful for his love.
[17:31] Amen.
[17:33] Hallelujah.
[17:35] Amen. Amen. I take the key of C. Let's
[17:39] sing this song. Take these hands. I'm

[18:45] Oh, and all my soul
[18:50] needs is all your love

[18:58] All the world

[19:04] that I have one day
[19:09] without you.
[19:14] And take my body
[19:18] and build it up.
[19:22] Make me a temple of your mercy and love.
[19:28] For I have nothing.
[19:32] I have nothing
[19:35] without you.
[19:38] Take my time. Oh, take my time
[19:45] here on earth
[19:48] and let it glorify all that you are
[19:52] worth.
[19:54] For I am nothing.
[19:58] I am nothing
[20:01] without you.
[20:06] And all my soul
[20:11] needs is all your love
[20:17] to cover me.
[20:20] All the world
[20:24] will see
[20:26] that I am nothing
[20:30] without you.
[20:33] All my soul needs
[20:36] and all my soul
[20:41] need is all your love
[20:46] to cover me.
[20:49] So all the world
[20:53] will see
[20:55] that I am nothing
[21:00] greater.
[21:04] How many could confess that tonight? I
[21:06] am nothing without you. Amen.
[21:10] Amen.
[21:12] Give me the key of G. Try creating me a
[21:14] clean heart.
[21:17] creates
[21:18] in me
[21:20] a clean heart.
[21:25] Oh God,
[21:31] I renewed a right spirit
[21:35] within me.
[21:41] Oh create
[21:44] in me a clean
[21:48] heart.
[21:51] Oh God,
[21:57] and renew your right spirit
[22:01] within
[22:03] me.
[22:08] And cast me not away
[22:14] from thy presence.
[22:17] soul
[22:20] and take
[22:22] the dying holy
[22:25] spirit from me.
[22:32] Restore
[22:34] unto me
[22:39] the joy of my salvation.
[22:46] and renew the right spirit
[22:50] within me. Cast me not away.
[22:55] Oh,
[22:57] cast me none
[23:00] away
[23:02] from thy presence,
[23:06] oh Lord,
[23:09] and take not thy holy
[23:14] spirit from me.
[23:20] Oh, restore
[23:22] all to me
[23:27] the joy of my salvation
[23:34] and renew my spirit
[23:38] within me.
[23:42] Amen. Praise God. What a song to start
[23:46] the year because you don't want to have
[23:48] any condemnation in your heart. So
[23:51] that's very important that the
[23:53] restoration of the joy of our salvation.
[23:56] Amen. Because little things you do kind
[23:58] of bring you down. But David cried to
[24:01] God to restore the joy of his salvation.
[24:05] And that's what the bride of Christ
[24:07] need.
[24:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:09] &gt;&gt; Okay, you can sit down. So as
[24:13] we entering the year those things are
[24:15] very very important. Amen. That because
[24:19] God will not hear you if there is
[24:21] iniquity in you.
[24:23] &gt;&gt; And it als say that blessed is the man
[24:25] whom I will not impute sin
[24:27] &gt;&gt; and whose iniquity is forgiven. So no
[24:29] matter what just make things right with
[24:31] God.
[24:32] &gt;&gt; Repent and move forward.
[24:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what you're supposed to do.
[24:37] Praise God.
[24:39] Hallelujah. Okay, Pastor Dan, if you're
[24:41] here, just lead us in prayer, then I'll
[24:43] start putting the finish here.
[24:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us pray. Father,
[24:51] what a privilege and what an honor it is
[24:53] this evening, Lord, to be in your
[24:55] presence once again, Lord, on a
[24:57] Wednesday night, Lord, where we dig deep
[25:01] into your word and we allow your spirit
[25:03] to come and minister to our hearts and
[25:06] to our needs. Lord, I pray that you will
[25:08] take our precious brother Philillip this
[25:10] evening, Lord, and use him for your
[25:12] glory. Let your spirit come, Lord, and
[25:15] discern the needs of your people once
[25:17] again. And we will leave here rejoicing,
[25:21] knowing that it was good to be in the
[25:24] house of the Lord. Have your way now. We
[25:27] give you all the glory in Jesus name.
[25:30] Amen.
[25:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Okay, I have a couple
[25:34] of scriptures. So
[25:38] uh I'll be reading them. I'll be reading
[25:40] some of them whilst the service is going
[25:43] on. So um I have three scriptures now.
[25:47] Just short short scriptures. 3r John
[25:51] chapter 3:2.
[25:55] Deuteronomy 28:1213 and Hebrews 138.
[26:00] Beloved, I wish above all things that
[26:03] thou mayest prosper and be in health
[26:06] even as thy soul prosper. And in
[26:09] Deuteronomy 28:12,
[26:15] the Lord shall open unto thee his good
[26:17] treasure, the heavens to give thee the
[26:21] rain unto thy land in his season, and to
[26:24] bless all the work of thine hand, and
[26:27] thou shall lend unto many nations, and
[26:30] thou shalt not borrow. Verse 13.
[26:36] And the Lord shall make thee the head
[26:38] and not the tail.
[26:40] &gt;&gt; And thou shalt be above only, and thou
[26:42] shalt not be bed, if thou thou hecken
[26:46] unto the commandment of the Lord thy
[26:48] God, which I commanded thee this day to
[26:51] observe and to do them. And then Hebrews
[26:54] 138, Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[26:58] today, and forever. If I will title it
[27:02] is the same God who spoke to Moses lives
[27:05] in his bride. Heavenly Father, may you
[27:08] please bless the reading of your word.
[27:12] Bless your children. Please close my
[27:14] mouth from saying anything you don't
[27:16] want me to say. Help me Lord to speak
[27:19] the right word to help your children in
[27:22] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[27:24] &gt;&gt; Please be seated.
[27:26] So if I this thing has just been burned
[27:29] on my heart from prayer meeting and I
[27:32] spoke a little bit on it on the 31st and
[27:35] I feel led to just still talk about it
[27:38] that the same God who spoke to Moses
[27:42] lives in your heart and he lives in my
[27:46] heart. But before um I go much into
[27:51] that, I'm just going to encourage
[27:53] everyone of us that as we entered like a
[27:57] new year, the first Wednesday,
[27:59] let's we don't know what lies ahead in
[28:03] 2026,
[28:05] but our confidence is in the Lord.
[28:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:09] &gt;&gt; And we believe that God will see us
[28:11] through. And um as the children of
[28:14] Israel when they were
[28:17] um they were before they crossed the
[28:20] Jordan the ark of the covenant went
[28:24] before them and the priest high priest
[28:26] were behind that ark. So we have to
[28:29] behind that word let the word go forth
[28:32] and he promised that as he told Joshua
[28:35] you have not passed this way before but
[28:37] I'll be with you even in you.
[28:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. and he promised that I'll preserve
[28:42] your going out and your coming in.
[28:45] &gt;&gt; So I just a little of encouragement that
[28:47] as you entering we've entered the new
[28:49] year let's have that assurance
[28:52] &gt;&gt; that God will go before us.
[28:55] &gt;&gt; The word of God not only the written
[28:57] word but the revelation the revelated
[28:59] word
[29:00] &gt;&gt; will go ahead of us and
[29:03] &gt;&gt; fight our battles and do everything for
[29:05] us. So the same God who spoke to Moses
[29:09] lives in his bride. And just a little
[29:13] recap
[29:14] that um I know everybody know about it
[29:17] but I'm just going to bring it down
[29:19] there because when the fall happened all
[29:23] the purpose of God is to live in his
[29:25] bride live in human being.
[29:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[29:27] &gt;&gt; But because the fall it kind of um break
[29:31] their relationship.
[29:33] So for God to bring us back um when that
[29:37] thing happened Adam and Eve they form a
[29:40] thick leaf to cover their nakedness that
[29:43] is a lot of people hide behind religion
[29:46] to do so wicked things but God told him
[29:50] that that fig leaf that religion would
[29:52] not work.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; It has to be a blood sacrifice. So he
[29:56] killed that first uh lamp and they used
[29:59] to cover themselves. From then on the
[30:03] children of Israel anytime anybody does
[30:06] anything wrong after the year they have
[30:09] to sacrifice animals to for
[30:12] their sins. But because that the spirit
[30:15] of the animals is lower than that of
[30:18] human beings when they go and commit
[30:23] make that sacrifice in less than a year
[30:26] that desire is still there.
[30:28] &gt;&gt; So in need a perfect sacrifice to take
[30:31] away that desire from our heart.
[30:34] &gt;&gt; And when the cry went out no one was
[30:36] worthy of heaven or on earth. There was
[30:39] no one who was able to die for us to
[30:42] take the mind their sins away. So God
[30:45] himself, the lamb of God, he took that
[30:48] book and open it. He came and shed his
[30:50] blood for you and me so that he can have
[30:53] that privilege to live in you and me.
[30:57] &gt;&gt; That was all his purpose to live in a
[30:59] man. So after he
[31:02] after he was after the Calvary when that
[31:05] sacrifice took place
[31:08] the the what went out was a spirit. So
[31:11] it became available for him to live in a
[31:13] man that's when after that he said that
[31:15] you have become the temple of God
[31:18] &gt;&gt; and he who that defiled that temple I
[31:20] will destroy. Amen. So now you and me
[31:24] are the temple that God dwells in.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so from that time that same
[31:30] God, Amen, that came and died and did
[31:34] all the mighty works, he changed his
[31:37] office. He changed his mask. And then he
[31:40] became to live in man. And on the day of
[31:43] Pentecost, he multiply himself from 120
[31:46] to 3,000 as many as the Lord our God
[31:49] shall call. And is God still God
[31:51] calling? Yes. So he still multiply
[31:54] himself. So Satan has a problem. He was
[31:57] dealing with one man Jesus. But now when
[32:00] he died, he multiply himself. So he has
[32:03] so many of us to deal with. Amen. Praise
[32:07] God. So our God is awesome God.
[32:10] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and
[32:12] forever. So all I encourage you that the
[32:16] same God, he lives in you and he lives
[32:19] in me.
[32:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the same yesterday, today,
[32:23] and forever.
[32:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So what am I trying to say?
[32:29] Um a lot of people are trying to put God
[32:34] in the future.
[32:36] But he's a present help in times of
[32:39] trouble.
[32:41] &gt;&gt; He's God of today.
[32:44] &gt;&gt; Don't let people put him in future. If
[32:47] you allow them to put him in future,
[32:49] they're going to live under your
[32:50] privileges. Because as brother Daniel
[32:54] Mar used to say all the time, God
[32:56] doesn't want good intentions.
[32:59] &gt;&gt; He wants you to put things in action.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; You might have so much good intentions
[33:04] and you can never be able to put into
[33:06] practice. But when he comes into your
[33:08] heart, he will manifest every promise
[33:11] because people are putting that promise
[33:13] so far that they are not able to
[33:16] manifest it. But God is calling us don't
[33:18] live under your privilege. redemption in
[33:21] three part. Don't be satisfied with only
[33:24] your um your born again. Claim every
[33:29] promise in that book is yours.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; So believe God for all the promises in
[33:34] the Bible because it is all for you.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. So
[33:40] what I'm trying to say that don't let
[33:43] people put the third pool in future
[33:47] &gt;&gt; because as Kofi said one time
[33:50] immediately
[33:51] that that mighty angel came down in 1963
[33:56] to open the seals. Everything that we
[33:58] have need of was revealed.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; It was open.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. From that time the temple became
[34:05] available.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And demonstrate it in so many
[34:09] aspect to us. But the the thing of it is
[34:13] when it's needed for you to use it, God
[34:17] will come and speak it into existence
[34:19] and not something that you are going to
[34:22] h manufacture it or anything.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; When you are in need of it, he will let
[34:28] it come to pass.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; So don't let nobody put that in future
[34:33] for you. is a present help in times of
[34:37] trouble. And the same mighty God that
[34:41] spoke Abraham's need into existence
[34:44] &gt;&gt; when he wanted to he need a to sacrifice
[34:46] his only son
[34:48] &gt;&gt; God spoke a lamp into existence
[34:51] &gt;&gt; and he's the same mighty God he hasn't
[34:54] changed
[34:55] &gt;&gt; and that same God when his prophet
[34:57] brother Abraham needed a squirrel
[35:00] &gt;&gt; and he was need of squirrel that God
[35:03] spoke the squirrel into existence amen
[35:06] and that same God is here tonight
[35:08] &gt;&gt; to speak your needs into existence
[35:11] &gt;&gt; if thou can believe. All things are
[35:14] possible to them that believe because
[35:17] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[35:19] forever. The same God that spoke to
[35:22] Moses. The same God that his mighty
[35:25] words is so much to even to wonder. The
[35:28] same God that parted the mighty Red Sea
[35:31] for them to pass through. That same God
[35:34] lives in you and in me. is the same
[35:37] yesterday, today, and forever.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; Our God hasn't changed.
[35:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So don't let no one
[35:46] put those promises, divine healing,
[35:49] prosperity,
[35:51] don't let them put in the future.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a present help in times of
[35:56] trouble. Let me read this quote again.
[35:59] Amen. I said, um, let me see this quote
[36:01] is I see and somebody said something
[36:04] about divine healing. Um just one time
[36:07] Lord
[36:09] and they claim it was in another day.
[36:13] See pointing off to what was maybe it
[36:18] will be over in the millennium. What do
[36:21] you need divine healing in the
[36:24] millennium for when you are immortal?
[36:28] Today is the day. This is the day.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then perseverance. He said
[36:35] perseverant paragraph 127.
[36:39] He said
[36:41] perseverance
[36:43] 207. Yeah. He said, "But I was heading
[36:47] my father's sheep
[36:49] and God helped me to take a kid out of a
[36:53] lion's mouth and a bear and so forth."
[36:57] And he said, "The God that will take
[37:00] give me deliverance from that lion's pow
[37:02] and that bear's pow, how much more will
[37:05] he give me the victory over the
[37:07] uncircumcised Philistine who is divine
[37:10] saying the days of miracles is passed.
[37:14] that big denominational creed that tries
[37:16] to place God miracles way back in here
[37:21] and divine healing over in the
[37:24] millennium when he will be immortal. God
[37:27] is the same yesterday, today and
[37:29] forever. If there ever was a God, he's
[37:33] still God.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; Sure, there he was. And you know what
[37:36] happened in the story? So what he's
[37:40] trying to tell you is that you won't
[37:42] need cars in the millennium.
[37:46] Aircraft and all the airplane, you got
[37:48] you not need them in the millennium. Now
[37:51] you need them.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you need your healing.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; Because there over there you are
[37:58] immortal.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; You don't need healing back then. Amen.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; So if you have any sickness or any
[38:07] infirmities
[38:08] now, you have the right to claim your
[38:11] healing
[38:12] &gt;&gt; because healing is by your faith
[38:15] &gt;&gt; because it's done already 2,000 years
[38:18] ago.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; It's you that have to accept it. By his
[38:22] stripes, we were healed
[38:25] &gt;&gt; way back then. If even the Lord Jesus
[38:29] Christ was to be here, brother, he
[38:31] cannot heal you because that thing is
[38:34] done finished. You have to accept it.
[38:37] You have to have faith for your
[38:39] salvation. You have to have faith for
[38:41] your healing. You have to have faith for
[38:43] every promise in the book.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; Don't let them tell you you don't need
[38:48] money in the millennium.
[38:51] Now you need money to help your
[38:53] children, to help the work of God, to
[38:56] take care of your family, to help
[38:58] others, to be a blessing. Why you can
[39:00] also be a blessing to others. Amen. As
[39:03] we read from the Deuteronomy, the Lord
[39:05] shall open unto thee his good treasure,
[39:08] the heaven to give rain unto thine land
[39:10] in season, and to bless all the works of
[39:13] thy hand, and thou shall lend unto many
[39:16] nations, and thou shall not borrow. And
[39:19] the Lord shall make thee the head and
[39:22] not the tail.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; And thou shalt be above only, and thou
[39:26] shalt not be beneath, if thou hecken
[39:30] unto the commandments of the Lord thy
[39:33] God, which I command thee this day to
[39:36] observe and to do them.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; So
[39:41] what I'm trying to say, you are not a
[39:43] tail,
[39:45] you are ahead.
[39:50] Don't allow nobody to push you down.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; And the the highest sin is there. The
[39:55] saints are going to judge the world.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; And if you are going to judge the world,
[40:01] you are the highest on the face of this
[40:03] earth.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Don't look down upon yourself,
[40:07] &gt;&gt; not with a bright pride, but realizing
[40:10] that you are a son of God
[40:13] &gt;&gt; and God lives in your heart. on the that
[40:17] first night I was just chatting with
[40:18] pastor Simon back there and I believe
[40:20] that he said a profound statement when I
[40:22] was talking to him and he was saying
[40:24] that Phil you see what happened when we
[40:28] were children none of us worry about the
[40:31] food that we going to eat you never
[40:33] worry about the clothes that you're
[40:34] going to eat because we have confidence
[40:36] that your parents will provide those
[40:38] things and I don't think there's any
[40:40] child that will sleep and get up
[40:43] tomorrow and worry about how he's going
[40:45] to be fed or how it's going to be
[40:47] clothed. Multiply that by billion times
[40:51] our heavenly father who created heaven
[40:54] and earth. So if it become read to you
[40:58] and is revealed to you that lord Jesus
[41:01] Christ is your father as realized that
[41:05] he's no more a son of Ella and um
[41:10] Charles Brham that Bible became a new
[41:13] Bible.
[41:14] So when that revelation really strike
[41:17] you and you get out from your amnesia
[41:20] and realize that our heavenly father who
[41:23] owns all the earth the gold the minerals
[41:26] everything is your father you are a
[41:28] child of that king man your attitude
[41:33] will be different
[41:35] &gt;&gt; you will walk differently
[41:38] &gt;&gt; you're not going to be worry about
[41:40] tomorrow because you know that you Oh,
[41:44] he going to make a way.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; How he's going to provide, I can't I
[41:49] can't explain it.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; But if he can feed the animals, can feed
[41:54] the spirals and all those things, can't
[41:57] he take care of you? You of little
[41:59] faith, God take care of all those
[42:02] things. And if you are to be a child of
[42:05] your natural parent and you are a little
[42:07] baby, you don't worry about how you
[42:10] going to live. So why are we now tossed
[42:14] about worry about this, worry about
[42:17] that, worry about that. Just be still
[42:22] and know that God is God.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; Hide. Go behind the ark.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; Let the revelation of the word, let the
[42:30] ark of God go in front of you as a high
[42:33] priest. Because when they did that, they
[42:36] cross over Jordan. So in any j that you
[42:39] are facing when you put that word of God
[42:42] first that word of God will cross for
[42:44] you. The revelation of the word will
[42:46] make a way where there seems to be no
[42:48] way. Amen. Is the same yesterday, today
[42:52] and forever. The same mighty God.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. When Silas and Paul when they were
[42:59] in prison, they began to pray. They
[43:01] began to shout. Amen. What happened? The
[43:03] earthquake took place, brother. The
[43:05] whole uh prison doors everything was all
[43:09] the chains were loose. Amen. That what
[43:12] do you call the centarian was so scared
[43:14] for his life. He wanted to take his life
[43:16] out but he said calm down.
[43:20] Don't do any harm to yourself. Amen. Why
[43:25] that centurion being a son of God? God
[43:29] has to let Paul go through all that. All
[43:32] the other prisons they were free because
[43:34] he was a son of God and he has to hear
[43:36] the word of God. Amen. So the people
[43:39] that were around him they all have a
[43:41] liberty and that same God is here.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. When the children of Israel when
[43:47] they were going to um Jericho.
[43:50] Amen. That Jericho had a lot of wars
[43:53] everywhere.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; They think that the wall was too big so
[43:56] nobody can come there. You see sometime
[43:58] when people think they are fortified
[44:02] they do all kind of stuff
[44:05] like Nebuchad time they think that they
[44:08] have that garden and
[44:12] that thing so nobody can come over there
[44:14] and so sin was what in abundance so when
[44:18] like even recently that happened I'm not
[44:20] supporting whatever happened but Maduro
[44:23] he thought that he has that they call it
[44:25] um what room is
[44:27] safe
[44:29] safe room so he's comforted that
[44:33] anything happen once he get in that safe
[44:35] room nobody can get him but it was too
[44:38] late so what I'm trying to say that
[44:41] don't the people shouldn't feel um in
[44:46] their comfort zone you got to move away
[44:48] from there
[44:49] &gt;&gt; and let God have his own way so when
[44:52] that wall was so big
[44:54] &gt;&gt; they thought that they cannot pass True.
[44:56] But they begin to sing. They begin to
[44:59] shout. They begin to march. March around
[45:01] that thing. March seven times, seven
[45:03] church ages. And when the first under
[45:06] the after the seven, they said that you
[45:07] have to begin to what? Shout and praise
[45:09] God. And they begin to shout. They begin
[45:12] to praise God. And that Jericho wall
[45:14] came crumbled. Amen. The enemy was
[45:16] defeated. So what am I trying to say is
[45:19] that when you are in prison in your mind
[45:22] when you are things are not going well
[45:24] rise up and sing and praise God all the
[45:28] Jericho around you will crumble all your
[45:30] problems will be crumbled. Shout and
[45:33] praise God.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Sing and praise God because the singers
[45:37] go forth before the word of God comes.
[45:39] Amen. They pave the way for the word to
[45:42] come true. So when you are feeling
[45:44] everything just rise up. Don't let the
[45:47] enemy put pull you down.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; Remember who you are.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; You are a son of God.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; And hold the God, the same God
[45:58] who
[45:59] when Peter and John when they met that
[46:05] the lame man, he said that silver and
[46:07] gold have I done.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; But I came to you in the name of he said
[46:11] rise up and walk.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; I I believe that man began to shake
[46:14] himself. He began to walk. Why? That
[46:17] same God is in you.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. So what do you have need of
[46:21] tonight? Because he's the same
[46:24] yesterday, today, and forever.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; He will never leave you nor forsake
[46:29] thee.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. So as I read the quotation
[46:35] about David,
[46:38] David has an experience.
[46:42] God gave me an experience with the bear.
[46:45] He gave me an experience also with a
[46:48] lion. So when it came the time to meet
[46:51] that big giant, the Philistine, he
[46:54] didn't care. His faith was in the God
[46:57] &gt;&gt; that gave him those victories.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. So what I'm trying to say is that
[47:04] God in his infinite mind knows that
[47:07] there is going to be a time they're
[47:09] going to close our church doors, this
[47:12] will happen. And I believe this is the
[47:14] hour. We don't have much time to spend.
[47:18] The man of sin is here. Every promise
[47:21] that God spoke through our prophet has
[47:24] fulfilled to the doubt. The Lord Jesus
[47:26] Christ on the day that he was crucified
[47:29] about 300 prophecies it all happened bum
[47:32] bum bum bum bum bum. So don't let nobody
[47:35] put anything in future because Jesus
[47:38] Christ the same yesterday today and
[47:41] forever. So he is giving you an
[47:44] experience, a victory over here, a
[47:46] victory over here, prisoner upon prison,
[47:48] here upon there, there. So that when the
[47:50] final stage come, you have confidence
[47:53] and realize that what God has done to
[47:56] you, he will do it again. So you not
[47:58] you're not going to be scared of any
[48:00] situation because if God could speak
[48:03] something to existence in your life
[48:08] when you see that happen
[48:10] and then you are in a situation there's
[48:13] no way to go like Abraham's situation he
[48:18] has confidence in God so much that he
[48:22] said that I receive this child as one is
[48:26] impotent as old man. And if God could
[48:29] give him to me at that time, even if I
[48:31] kill him, he can also raise him up.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; So is you and me, you can HAVE
[48:35] CONFIDENCE.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; YES.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; GOD that brought you from the world.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; God that delivered you from cancer.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; GOD THAT DELIVERED you from worldliness.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; God that delivered me from drinking that
[48:47] brought all kind of life. When there is
[48:50] a need for anything to happen, that same
[48:53] God
[48:54] &gt;&gt; will speak it into existence. Amen.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; You just have to wait and see the
[48:58] SALVATION OF GOD. THAT'S what Moses told
[49:01] the people because they were encamp.
[49:04] Amen. They were facing the Red Sea and
[49:07] this Egyptian army, they were coming in
[49:09] numbers
[49:10] and the people had began to melt. But I
[49:14] believe that David, oh sorry, Moses had
[49:17] confidence in God. He realized God that
[49:20] appeared to him in that burning bush
[49:23] experience and he realized oh when I met
[49:26] this guy I told him I cannot even speak
[49:28] I gave him so much of my weakness I
[49:31] cannot do this I can't do this I can't
[49:32] do that but he said that I've ordained
[49:34] you are the one that going to do it
[49:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN HE SAW HOW God
[49:41] spoke through him with all the the the
[49:44] plagues and everything
[49:47] &gt;&gt; in the Egypt and how God brought them
[49:49] out and it came to a place that the
[49:52] Egyptians were even tired of them. So
[49:54] they gave them great substance to live
[49:57] from that country. Amen. If you they
[49:59] left great substances, we are living
[50:02] with another great substance. Amen.
[50:04] Because the same yesterday, today and
[50:07] forever.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; So when Moses reached there,
[50:11] inspiration strike him. He said, "This
[50:14] Egyptian you see, you cannot see. You're
[50:17] not going to see them no more." Amen. He
[50:20] spoke that and later he cried and God
[50:22] said, "What do you have in your hand?
[50:24] &gt;&gt; Just speak and go forth.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; What do you have in your hand today?
[50:28] Speak and go forth. That same God is
[50:31] here."
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. To speak your needs into
[50:34] existence. While the word is going on,
[50:37] whatever you have NEED OF, TRUST AND
[50:39] HAVE CONFIDENCE, THAT SAME GOD is here,
[50:43] he will speak that need to existence.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. If your motive is right and your
[50:49] objective IS RIGHT, THAT SAME GOD will
[50:52] be speak your needs into existence.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; So don't worry, everything going to be
[50:57] all right.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. So
[51:00] those Egyptians
[51:03] were nowhere to be found.
[51:05] Amen. And I believe that David one time
[51:07] also got the same situation when Saul
[51:10] was after him. The Philistines were
[51:12] after him. He was caught in the middle,
[51:15] but God delivered him. And some people,
[51:19] two people that really
[51:23] trust David. They knew he was going to
[51:26] be the king. Amen. It doesn't matter how
[51:31] they have I believe that revelation in
[51:36] the word of God. So you know what faith
[51:40] doesn't look look beyond earth.
[51:43] So they looked at man
[51:47] this our king this one we know is going
[51:49] to be the king but Saul is after him the
[51:53] Philistines after him but their
[51:55] confidence was still in the word of God
[51:57] and they stood by David. So when they
[52:00] heard the least desire of him they risk
[52:03] their life and go and get water for him
[52:06] to drink. Amen. That's how much
[52:08] confidence they have in David. And God
[52:11] delivered him from Saul and from
[52:14] everything. And it even came to a point
[52:17] that God gave him an opportunity to get
[52:20] rid of Saul, but he didn't do. He said,
[52:23] "I will not touch God's anointing." So
[52:26] what am I trying to say? Not every time
[52:30] that God gives you an opportunity for
[52:32] your enemy that you have to go after
[52:34] them. Sometime let grace takes over
[52:39] &gt;&gt; because remember Israel was wrong as
[52:41] wrong can be and normal people some
[52:45] people would have said oh if God told
[52:47] them I'm going to get rid of all the
[52:50] people Moses I'm going to start a new
[52:52] generation through you but with the
[52:55] spirit of Christ in Moses he said no
[52:59] &gt;&gt; he interceded for the children of Israel
[53:04] &gt;&gt; and the same God is here.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't look at what Israel has
[53:09] done. He interceded for them. And in
[53:13] Braban ministry, whilst he was
[53:16] preaching, a young man and his
[53:18] girlfriend were doing an act that was
[53:20] very wrong. And he said that they were
[53:23] trying to tempt me. And God said, "I
[53:26] gave them to you. Say whatever you
[53:27] want."
[53:29] He didn't say, "Let pill of fire come
[53:31] and strike them." But he said, "I gave
[53:34] them their salvation and they repented
[53:37] that time and have grace." So let's
[53:40] project grace, grace, grace, grace.
[53:43] Because sometimes
[53:46] we could have been there as John Wesley
[53:50] said, "There was I but what the grace of
[53:54] God."
[53:55] &gt;&gt; So let's project grace in every
[53:57] situation. And when grace projects, love
[54:02] takes over. Amen. So he's the same
[54:05] yesterday, today, and forever. Our God
[54:09] hasn't changed.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I'm coming back to my point. I
[54:14] haven't left that point yet.
[54:17] When
[54:19] you have need,
[54:22] God will speak that need into existence.
[54:26] Amen. because he's the same yesterday,
[54:29] today, and forever. The same God that
[54:34] was in Abraham ministry, that same God
[54:37] is here with us. Because remember there,
[54:40] he said that as he told Joshua, as I was
[54:44] with what? Moses. Amen. So I'll be what?
[54:48] With you. It's a Joshua ministry. So the
[54:51] same God that was with the prophet is
[54:55] with you and me. He hasn't changed.
[54:58] He'll do exact same thing he did in his
[55:01] ministry through maybe not to that high
[55:04] point but because a many members body
[55:06] going to do it um through us not only
[55:11] one person. So our God is awesome God.
[55:15] And as I was saying that don't let no
[55:18] one put that tle in the future
[55:22] because said that it will pass through
[55:29] the nose of a lot of people. Why is it
[55:32] going to pass through their nose?
[55:34] Because they were always putting in the
[55:36] future this will happen. So when the
[55:39] thing is happening they don't even see
[55:42] it.
[55:44] But that same God is moving. It's a
[55:49] mighty work.
[55:51] When God spoke
[55:55] bra
[55:57] to existence, I believe the same God
[56:00] when one time a former pastor was he
[56:02] said North Carolina or something and the
[56:04] lady came with a need and he said I gave
[56:08] you your husband. when he said that he
[56:10] said later I said my ministry but
[56:13] because it wasn't him
[56:16] a voice spoke through him that voice was
[56:19] God's voice
[56:21] &gt;&gt; and it has to come to pass
[56:24] &gt;&gt; it attract that man to walk all over so
[56:27] many miles to come and make things right
[56:30] the with the wife that same God is here
[56:33] with us
[56:34] &gt;&gt; he hasn't changed he's the same
[56:36] yesterday today and forever
[56:38] &gt;&gt; even Even as I always say that one time
[56:41] I went to go to work and the supervisor
[56:45] was not expecting me because the job for
[56:47] a Jewish guy. I spoke over here and over
[56:49] but then I have I was there like 6:30 in
[56:53] the morning. I drove like an hour and I
[56:57] didn't have nowhere to go. So I told the
[56:59] guy I'm not give me a little space to
[57:01] work. When those guys comes I will leave
[57:05] and I pack and I go home. And I believe
[57:07] that something came to me. I didn't
[57:10] think about it. When God is doing
[57:13] something, you don't even think about
[57:15] it. The thing just come through you.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; And I told the guy, "Those guys are not
[57:20] coming boldly." And he said, "How can
[57:23] you prove it? These guys, I've worked
[57:25] with them for 10 years. They are always
[57:28] on time. They are never late." I said,
[57:30] "They are not coming." And then
[57:32] something said once you spoke it so loud
[57:36] boldly if they come what's going to
[57:38] happen and a voice rose up in me said
[57:41] God said let there be light and light
[57:44] came and he believed and light came and
[57:46] I believe and I stand by that word of
[57:49] God within like 3 four hours the guy
[57:51] came to me asked me Phil will those
[57:53] people come said I don't know later I
[57:56] said you are more powerful than who what
[58:00] you think you
[58:01] I'm not powerful. The God in me is a
[58:04] mighty God. And those guys never show up
[58:07] until I finish the job. He told me they
[58:09] were going to come the following day. He
[58:11] gave me a lot of trouble. I said they
[58:13] are not coming the following day in my
[58:15] heart. And they never show up. They
[58:16] never show up until I finish and I left.
[58:20] And Braov, what do you think? What took
[58:22] place when God told Brahic to come and
[58:25] tell you that that sickness is not unto
[58:26] death. IT'S THE SAME GOD. SO GOD I have
[58:30] to give a floor. Every one of you have a
[58:34] testimony how God has done a mighty work
[58:37] through you. So you are a little David.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when there is a need for
[58:44] anything to happen, God will speak into
[58:46] existence when it's needed. So don't let
[58:50] people put the third pool in future. The
[58:53] third pool is here. The seventh or the
[58:55] seventh is everything is here.
[58:58] Everything that you have not available
[59:00] now, God is in you. You are greater than
[59:03] what you think you are. Everything you
[59:06] have need of today is inside of you.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; You have to activate it.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; You have to bring it to pass.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't look to anybody left or
[59:17] right.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Look to Jesus because he's the same
[59:21] yesterday, today, and forever.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Whatever you have need of is inside of
[59:26] you already. Yeah.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because when you take a glass of
[59:31] water from sea, that glass has the same
[59:35] ingredients
[59:36] &gt;&gt; as the whole sea. It might not be that
[59:38] big sea, but it has the same. And he
[59:41] said um he said that
[59:46] the father the I in the father, the
[59:49] father in me, and I in you. Amen. In
[59:53] other words, all that was in God, he
[59:56] poured into Christ. And all that was in
[59:59] Christ, he has poured into his bride.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; So everything is in you. That same God
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; is in you and in me.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; He lives in you.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't want as we entering the
[1:00:15] year, we have to have that confidence.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Moving forward that God lives in us. The
[1:00:20] same God
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; who created heaven and earth
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; whose mighty word who spoke to the woman
[1:00:27] and the world. The same mighty God that
[1:00:31] spoke THROUGH JOSHUA AND SAID son stood
[1:00:33] still and son obey him. The same God
[1:00:36] when he was here and the wind was
[1:00:38] blowing. Is there any wind in your life?
[1:00:41] He said storm calm down. He came down
[1:00:43] when was in Colorado. Amen. hunting. The
[1:00:48] voice said, "Speak."
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; And that wind
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; all the snow everything was clear.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Who was doing that? It's not him is God.
[1:00:59] The same God is here. He decoke
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; and first time he said am I hearing
[1:01:10] right? And he ignore he thought that it
[1:01:12] wasn't God but he came back but two
[1:01:15] times they say oh then he took his heart
[1:01:17] and he says stom yeah this that and
[1:01:20] everything obey him. Amen. Who was that?
[1:01:23] It was God in the prophet. It was God
[1:01:26] doing through that. And that same God
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; is here tonight.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; He's in you and in me. So as we enter
[1:01:34] the 2020,
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; let's have that confidence
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; and believe that same God is in you and
[1:01:41] me. Don't let nobody lie to you
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; that you're going to get your car in
[1:01:46] millennium. You're going to get healing
[1:01:47] millennium. Now you need your healing.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. That Peter asked him, we have left
[1:01:53] mother, father, brother, sister,
[1:01:55] everything and follow you. What are we
[1:01:58] going to get? He said there's none that
[1:02:00] has left mother, father and left or
[1:02:02] forsake everything and follow me that
[1:02:05] will not be blessed in the present
[1:02:08] and the world to come.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; That same God is here. Amen. Don't let
[1:02:14] no one put in the future. Now is your
[1:02:17] salvation getting near and nearer. Now
[1:02:19] redemption is nearer than before. Amen.
[1:02:22] Let's walk in the spirit as he in the
[1:02:25] spirit. sons and daughters BUT ARE LED
[1:02:28] BY THE SPIRIT OF THE LIVING GOD.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; LET THAT spirit lead you.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't lead yourself.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Give yourself away to Jesus
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; and let him lead you and direct you
[1:02:40] every step of the way. Amen. And oh man,
[1:02:43] he will do a mighty work through you. I
[1:02:46] mean God want to move this morning.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; He want to do a mighty work through
[1:02:49] rest. Going for that mighty west. Are
[1:02:52] you ready tonight for the mighty God to
[1:02:55] use you mightly because he's willing to
[1:02:57] use?
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:03:00] forever.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's going to use us more than we
[1:03:04] can even imagine. And the and the beauty
[1:03:06] of this, Pastor Danny, when it happens,
[1:03:09] you know that we have nothing to do with
[1:03:10] it.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; It's him that did it.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, the glory belongs to the Lord
[1:03:15] Jesus Christ. Let's give him an
[1:03:16] applause. Amen.
[1:03:21] Because now you know what the the bride
[1:03:24] is resting on they resting on God on the
[1:03:28] word of God on God's ability. Not the
[1:03:32] bride's ability but the ability of God
[1:03:35] to do mighty work through us. Amen. Said
[1:03:38] the works that I do shall you also do.
[1:03:40] Amen. And greater than this. Amen.
[1:03:43] Because he's the same God in you doing
[1:03:45] it. Amen. God hasn't changed. He's the
[1:03:49] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. He'll do mighty works. Amen.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Our God is awesome.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; He's wonderful God.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Let's give him an applause. Let's love
[1:04:02] him. Let's live for him. Amen.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Amen.
[1:04:12] Praise God.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So I believe that what we
[1:04:17] need as we entering the year is more of
[1:04:21] Jesus Christ
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; is more of him a closer walk with him.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; That's excuse me that's what the bride
[1:04:30] need nothing else so that he himself
[1:04:36] will lead his life through. Amen. When
[1:04:41] temptation rise, when anything happened,
[1:04:44] he is there to lead his life through us.
[1:04:48] He hasn't changed. He's the same
[1:04:50] yesterday, today, and forever. He
[1:04:54] promised he's never going to leave you
[1:04:57] nor forsake you. Amen. Because he's
[1:05:00] going to live his perfect life through
[1:05:03] you and me. Amen. Hallelujah. He hasn't
[1:05:08] changed. So as we seek more of him,
[1:05:13] the other thing too
[1:05:15] that um you have some people
[1:05:19] that comes to church
[1:05:21] and sometimes they think, "Oh, nobody
[1:05:25] talk to me. Nobody invites me. I'm not
[1:05:30] invited for this. I'm not invited for
[1:05:33] that." and they whining and they crying
[1:05:37] and they complaining and they doing this
[1:05:40] and they doing that. But you don't have
[1:05:44] to do that.
[1:05:46] Look at example that God gave to us. The
[1:05:50] prophet of God,
[1:05:52] he was raised up in a family that they
[1:05:56] were very despised. He said when I was
[1:05:59] young when he even go say sometime they
[1:06:02] tell that he's a trash nobody has to
[1:06:04] talk to him but the point I'm trying to
[1:06:07] make is that when God came into him when
[1:06:12] God called him and God used him and do
[1:06:16] that mighty work through him he was even
[1:06:18] hiding from friends. So what is it? What
[1:06:23] it is that Christians has to do? Have
[1:06:26] that relationship with God.
[1:06:30] Let your relationship with God be this.
[1:06:32] Hi. And when you are in love with him,
[1:06:36] he will draw his children to you. You
[1:06:39] become as brother that say you are
[1:06:41] become a nectar whatever li you attract
[1:06:44] everything just like um Esther. That
[1:06:48] spirit on her was so sweet that he
[1:06:51] attracted the king to her. So you just
[1:06:54] fall in love with God
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; and let God have the preeminence and who
[1:07:00] he wants to bring to your life, he's
[1:07:02] going to draw them to you.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Whom he want to kick out, he going to
[1:07:06] kick them out. You don't have to worry
[1:07:09] about friends. What a friend we have in
[1:07:12] Jesus.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What a fault it is to take
[1:07:16] everything to him in prayer.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; He's our best friend.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; He's the one that has to be your friend.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; And when he's your friend, he's a friend
[1:07:27] indeed.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Everyone will fail you.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; But he will never fail you.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. He will never leave you, nor
[1:07:37] forsake you. Amen. So why do you worry
[1:07:41] about earthly friends? Know why the
[1:07:44] psalm said when earthly friends forsaken
[1:07:47] hold on to God's unchanging hands?
[1:07:50] Because remember even Job who was the
[1:07:53] richest man in his in his time
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; when he was in trouble
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; when
[1:08:00] everything
[1:08:02] was gone away from him all the friends
[1:08:05] deserted him
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; and they began to even what blame him.
[1:08:11] Secret.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Secret sin.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; And look at your natural friends. When
[1:08:20] things are going on good, you got a lot
[1:08:24] of friends. They come to you, they char
[1:08:27] this. When things go wrong, you think
[1:08:31] they come to you, they're going to
[1:08:32] whisper. This guy, even when he get the
[1:08:34] money, he didn't use the money right.
[1:08:36] They're going to bring all your faults
[1:08:40] and let everybody knows your downfall.
[1:08:43] But a friend indeed is the Lord Jesus
[1:08:46] Christ.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; So let's put our faith in him.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; And Job confidence was in God.
[1:08:55] when that trial becomes so hard on him
[1:08:59] and even his life. You know the marriage
[1:09:02] couple, the greatest thing to your heart
[1:09:05] is your wife.
[1:09:07] And maybe Job was thinking that if
[1:09:11] everybody has forsake me, my wife will
[1:09:14] stand by me. When the trials get hot,
[1:09:18] this wife will never leave me. He going
[1:09:21] to she going to stand by me. And then I
[1:09:24] believe maybe Joe was surprised when the
[1:09:26] wife came one time she said why don't
[1:09:29] you curse God and die and be free. He
[1:09:32] said thou speaking like a foolish woman.
[1:09:35] Jo confidence was in God.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; He wasn't worshiping his wife.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; That wife was not his God.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; His money and the mansion. Everything he
[1:09:47] had wasn't his God.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; God was first to him. Amen.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; He have that revelation that the Lord
[1:09:55] taketh. The Lord giveth, the Lord
[1:09:57] taketh. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. We is the God of the mountains.
[1:10:02] He's the God on the valley. In the
[1:10:05] valley, when things go wrong, he will
[1:10:08] make them right. The same God is here.
[1:10:12] Amen. So when everything
[1:10:16] was gone
[1:10:18] and God showed him a vision
[1:10:21] and he said that I know that my redeemer
[1:10:25] liveth even the skin worm destroyed this
[1:10:29] body yet in my flesh I will see God.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; He saw the rapture. He saw everything.
[1:10:36] Amen. And he came out victorious.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Why? Because his confidence is in God.
[1:10:40] Amen.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; So seeking first the kingdom of God and
[1:10:43] his righteousness, all other things will
[1:10:47] be added onto it. When God bless you
[1:10:49] with material things, don't let that
[1:10:52] take you away from him.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; That should be a secondary.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; He blesses your wife and children. Don't
[1:11:00] let that be a a a hindrance to you.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Put God first.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Our family, we love them, but God first.
[1:11:09] Amen.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; I love my wife. I love my children. But
[1:11:12] God first.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the priority of
[1:11:15] everything.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe that Job have that
[1:11:19] revelation. So as we entering, we've
[1:11:22] entered the year and you are head the
[1:11:25] head not the tail when the riches
[1:11:28] increase remember God.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Don't let that riches become your God.
[1:11:35] Like the worldly people, they put that
[1:11:38] ahead
[1:11:39] and sometimes even believers,
[1:11:44] we get to a place
[1:11:48] that
[1:11:50] we sometimes let things that we need
[1:11:52] become so like life and death that some
[1:11:57] people will rather choose not to come to
[1:12:01] service but to chase
[1:12:04] that dollar. I'm not saying that you
[1:12:08] don't have to work on Sundays. The Bible
[1:12:11] said that when the off the date, you
[1:12:13] have to pick it up. But it doesn't have
[1:12:15] to be a habit.
[1:12:17] You have to make way because forsake not
[1:12:22] the assembly of yourselves even as the
[1:12:26] time what approaches. So in your heart,
[1:12:29] you have to have that desire to serve
[1:12:33] God. you have to have that desire to put
[1:12:35] him first. I remember when I first
[1:12:38] became a Christian
[1:12:40] and then I was just new in the country
[1:12:43] and uh I started going to church about 2
[1:12:47] 3 months and then I was not working then
[1:12:50] I got a call Sunday when I finished
[1:12:53] taking my shower about to take my
[1:12:55] clothes to go to church phone call hey
[1:12:59] we have a job for you can you come and
[1:13:00] do it right now agency I didn't even
[1:13:02] have a revelation of nothing said job
[1:13:04] church job said No, I'm not coming. Then
[1:13:07] I went to church. The following day, I
[1:13:10] got a better job more than the agency
[1:13:12] and I did for like 2 3 years until I
[1:13:14] left that place. Why? Because I praise
[1:13:17] God first
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; and he answered it. And I even remember
[1:13:22] when I used to work in 8 years, I used
[1:13:24] to do two jobs and then it came to me so
[1:13:27] much that I need to take only one so
[1:13:31] that I can be in the house of service.
[1:13:35] And then in my life to be honest with
[1:13:38] you, there's never a time that I I have
[1:13:42] a struggle to sleep. I always sleep like
[1:13:45] a baby every time. I don't have private
[1:13:46] I can sleep at any time. But the one
[1:13:49] time in my life that I never slept when
[1:13:51] that thing was weighing on my head, I
[1:13:54] didn't know what to do, how to like
[1:13:58] switch between the two jobs I was doing
[1:14:01] because one of them was a daytime and I
[1:14:04] didn't like that day job so much. But
[1:14:06] the one I like was in the afternoon. So
[1:14:09] I was thinking if I leave this afternoon
[1:14:12] job, I don't like this day job. But if I
[1:14:15] leave the day job, I won't be able to
[1:14:18] work in the afternoon. I won't be able
[1:14:20] to come to church if I take the
[1:14:21] afternoon job. So in the I was thinking
[1:14:24] about it like that and then all of a
[1:14:27] sudden a thought came to me go and talk
[1:14:30] to Ganet and he give you that job in the
[1:14:33] day where you like in the daytime and I
[1:14:36] went I said Ganet I want a day job over
[1:14:38] here. He said, "Phil, it's available."
[1:14:41] And once God opened that door for me,
[1:14:44] within two months, I rose to be a
[1:14:46] supervisor because the manager there was
[1:14:49] so in love with me. Show me everything
[1:14:51] he was doing. And if it's not, I could
[1:14:53] manage that business around that time by
[1:14:55] 15, 20 people around me because I put
[1:14:58] God first.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; So let's put him first in everything.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Don't let nothing comes before you,
[1:15:06] between you and the love of God. Amen.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; As we entering the year, let that love
[1:15:11] of God
[1:15:13] flow through you so much that it will
[1:15:16] even let you love your enemies. Because
[1:15:20] remember one thing Paul talk about
[1:15:22] Abraham, he treat everybody exact same.
[1:15:28] Let's treat everybody the same
[1:15:30] regardless.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; And let's love one another. Let's pray
[1:15:34] for one another. Let's commit everyone
[1:15:36] into God's hand. That's what I have for
[1:15:39] tonight. He's the same yesterday, today,
[1:15:41] and forever. And before I go, Grace, can
[1:15:44] you put on the same God for me? The Lar
[1:15:47] I call the musicians.
[1:15:50] Put that song on for me.
[1:16:14] I look back
[1:16:16] on history,
[1:16:18] see the mighty God
[1:16:22] unveiled,
[1:16:24] proving
[1:16:26] over and over
[1:16:28] that his word can never fail.
[1:16:34] But I can't keep on dwelling
[1:16:38] on some past me.
[1:16:43] Cuz now that same God
[1:16:46] is living
[1:16:48] in me.
[1:16:53] Oh, the same God
[1:16:56] who spoke to
[1:16:58] the woman at
[1:17:01] the well.
[1:17:03] The same God
[1:17:06] whose wonders
[1:17:08] too many
[1:17:10] to tell.
[1:17:13] The sing God
[1:17:16] who parted
[1:17:18] the raging
[1:17:20] resting.
[1:17:25] He is the same God
[1:17:28] who's living
[1:17:30] in me.
[1:17:36] The same God who created
[1:17:41] all the heavens and all the earth. He
[1:17:46] came back living in Jesus.
[1:17:50] And there was power
[1:17:53] in his word.
[1:17:56] But now in these last days, I'm
[1:18:00] beginning
[1:18:02] to see
[1:18:07] that it's that same God who's living
[1:18:12] in me.
[1:18:18] The same God
[1:18:20] who spoke to
[1:18:22] the woman at
[1:18:25] the well.
[1:18:27] The same God
[1:18:30] whose wonders
[1:18:32] too many
[1:18:34] to tell.
[1:18:37] Sing God
[1:18:40] who pardoned
[1:18:42] the raging
[1:18:44] red sea.
[1:18:49] He's the same God
[1:18:52] who's living
[1:18:54] in me.
[1:18:58] Oh,
[1:18:59] he's the same God
[1:19:02] who's living
[1:19:04] in me.
[1:19:14] Amen. Praise God. Amen.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.

[1:19:28] spirit that raised Christ from the dead
[1:19:33] dwelt in you,
[1:19:36] dwells in you.

[1:20:24] dwells in you,
[1:20:27] dwells in you.
[1:20:31] If the same
[1:20:33] spirit that raised Christ from the dead
[1:20:37] dwells in you.
[1:20:40] dwells in you.
[1:20:43] It is quickening
[1:20:46] my mortal body.
[1:20:49] For the spirit
[1:20:52] dwells in me,
[1:20:56] it is quickening
[1:20:58] my mortal body
[1:21:02] in the same
[1:21:04] spirit dwells in you.

[1:21:10] presence tonight? Amen. The same God
