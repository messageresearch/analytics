[17:58] confidence the blood of Christ It washes
[18:01] from all sins. May you come once more
[18:04] and speak to us as never been before.
[18:06] Father, we expect you because your word
[18:09] clearly said where two or three are
[18:11] gathered in your name, you are in our
[18:13] midst. So come once more and speak. We
[18:17] come against any contrary spirit. Let
[18:19] the great Holy Ghost have remnants. Lord
[18:22] Jesus Christ, we are depending on you.
[18:25] We are depending on you Lord. We are
[18:27] depend on your grace and your mercy
[18:30] tonight. Come and help us, Father. We
[18:33] are a needy people, Lord, in the name of
[18:35] our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[18:38] Oh, praise God. I have a lengthy
[18:41] scriptures. I kind of forget my notes at
[18:43] home, but doesn't matter. God will make
[18:45] a way and just scrapple something up
[18:48] right away over here. And I'm not
[18:51] depending on myself. I'm not depend on
[18:53] the nose. We depend on Christ. Amen.
[18:56] Amen. The nose is just a guidelines. The
[18:58] rest take care of it. So I'm not
[19:01] worried. Amen. So um our first scripture
[19:05] is Isaiah
[19:14] 53:5. Isaiah
[19:19] 53:5 But he was wounded for our
[19:23] transgressions. He was bruised for our
[19:26] iniquities, our iniquities, sorry. The
[19:29] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[19:33] and with his stripes we are healed. And
[19:37] I have one lengthy one. First Kings 3
[19:40] verse
[19:41] 1-13. That'll be lengthy one, but just
[19:43] bear with me. Today is a Bible studies
[19:47] anyway. So I hope you won't
[19:51] mind. Put this one here.
[19:55] Okay, put this one here. And
[20:01] Solomon, first Kings 3 verse 1-13. First
[20:06] Kings 3 verse 1-13.
[20:09] And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh,
[20:12] king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's
[20:15] daughter, and brought her into the city
[20:18] of David, until he had made an end of
[20:20] building his own house, and the house of
[20:24] the Lord, and the wall of Jerusalem
[20:27] roundabout. Only the people sacrificed
[20:30] in the high places, because there was no
[20:33] house built unto the name of the Lord
[20:36] until those days. And Solomon loved the
[20:39] Lord, walking in the status of his of
[20:43] David his father. Only he sacrificed and
[20:46] burned incense in high
[20:50] places. And the king went to Gibon to
[20:54] sacrifice there, for that was the great
[20:56] high place, a thousand burnt offerings
[21:01] this Solomon offer upon that altar.
[21:04] In
[21:05] Gibian, the Lord appeared to Solomon in
[21:09] a dream by night, and God said, "Ask
[21:12] what I shall give thee."
[21:16] And Solomon
[21:18] said, I love this, "Thou hast show unto
[21:22] thy servant David, my father, great
[21:25] mercy, according as he has walked before
[21:28] thee in truth and in righteousness and
[21:32] uprightness of heart with thee."
[21:36] And thou hast kept for him his great
[21:39] kindness that thou has given him a son
[21:43] to sit on his throne as this day. Verse
[21:46] seven. And now I like this here. Oh Lord
[21:51] my God, thou has made thy servant king
[21:54] instead of David thy father. And I am
[21:57] but a
[21:58] child. Here dependence of I know not how
[22:02] to go out or come in. He expressed his
[22:08] dependency on God, not according to his
[22:11] own wisdom or knowledge. And thy servant
[22:14] is in the midst of thy people, which
[22:16] thou hast chosen, a great people here
[22:19] tonight, that cannot be numbered, nor
[22:22] counted for
[22:24] multitude. Give therefore thy servant an
[22:27] understanding heart to judge thy people.
[22:31] That's the spirit of discernment. that I
[22:33] may zen between good and bad. For who is
[22:38] able to judge this thy so great
[22:40] people? And the speech, oh my somewhere
[22:44] he said, let the words of my mouth and
[22:46] meditation of my heart be acceptable
[22:48] unto thee. And the speech what? Please
[22:50] the Lord that Solomon has asked this
[22:54] thing. And God said unto him, "Because
[22:58] thou has asked this thing, and has not
[23:01] asked for thyself long
[23:04] life, neither has asked riches for
[23:07] thyself, nor that has asked the life of
[23:10] thine enemies, but has asked for thyself
[23:14] understanding of what? Diserning
[23:18] judgment." Wow. Behold, I have done
[23:21] according to thy ways. Lord, I've given
[23:25] thee a wise and understanding heart, so
[23:29] that there was none
[23:32] like thee before thee, neither neither
[23:36] after thee shall any arise like unto
[23:39] thee. The last verse, that's where I'm
[23:41] going to base my topic on. That really
[23:44] strikes my heart when I I read that
[23:46] scripture. And I have also given thee
[23:49] that which thou has not asked asked,
[23:53] both riches and honor, so that there
[23:57] shall not be any among the kings like
[24:00] unto thee all thy days. Heavenly Father,
[24:05] bless the reason of the word in the name
[24:07] of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Please
[24:10] be seated.
[24:11] So he said that verse 13, "And I have
[24:15] also given thee that which thou has not
[24:20] asked, both riches and honor, so that
[24:23] there shall not be any among the kings
[24:26] or like on thee." So in other words,
[24:30] God promised to bless him abundantly
[24:34] more than what he even what asked or
[24:38] anticipated. Um my topic tonight is
[24:42] redemption in three parts part two.
[24:45] Amen. Hallelujah. So that's going to be
[24:48] my
[24:50] um my topic. We're going to continue.
[24:54] And before I continue
[24:58] um I'm just going to read a little bit
[25:00] here because we know that
[25:02] redemption is buying
[25:05] back. And what is God buying us back
[25:08] from? All too because he shed his blood
[25:12] on Calvary to pay what? The price of our
[25:14] sins. And when he died, he brought us
[25:17] back. He brought us back to where? He
[25:20] brought us back to our original
[25:22] inheritance to how first Adam was to
[25:27] bring us back to that stage. That's why
[25:30] God has bought us for I'm going to read
[25:33] this and I'm going to base it my thing
[25:35] on that.
[25:38] Um in the the bridge between the seven
[25:42] church ages and the seven seals
[25:45] paragraph 97 to maybe 100 but I'm going
[25:48] to cut it off here and there.
[25:53] Now, okay, I
[25:57] think Okay, now when a man has been
[26:01] redeemed, he don't care anymore for
[26:04] scholarship. He don't care for any more
[26:07] of the things of the world, the wisdom
[26:10] of the world. He don't
[26:12] mind, he don't want no choice at all.
[26:16] Christ has been his choice and that is
[26:21] all of it. He is what? Redeemed. He just
[26:25] no more wants to lead himself. He don't
[26:28] want anybody talk him into where to go
[26:31] and what to do. He just wait and finds
[26:35] out the choice of his maker. See, then
[26:38] he goes in the name of the maker when
[26:40] the maker tells him to go. Okay. I think
[26:43] um and verse 99. Now when Adam
[26:47] sinned by heeding his wife reasoning
[26:51] instead of holding to God's word, that's
[26:54] what made Adam sin. His wife reason with
[26:58] Satan and then produce a product to Adam
[27:01] and Adam then lose the word and sold
[27:05] what? He sold us out. But then he lost
[27:10] also his inheritance when he lost his
[27:14] fellowship and right to life. Remember
[27:19] the day you eat thereof that day you
[27:21] die. And when he lost his life, he also
[27:24] lost his
[27:26] inheritance in life because he had
[27:28] completely supreme control of the earth.
[27:33] He was God of the earth.
[27:37] God is the God of the universe
[27:41] everywhere. But his son
[27:44] had this earth under his own control.
[27:49] What really strike me was here. Adam
[27:52] could
[27:53] speak, he could
[27:55] name, he could
[27:57] say, he he could stop
[28:01] nature, he could do anything he wanted
[28:05] to do. See, but when he did that, he
[28:08] lost his inheritance. In other
[28:13] words, the first Adam when he was in the
[28:16] garden, he have control over
[28:19] everything, all of inheritance. You can
[28:23] say
[28:24] this tree move over here, the tree will
[28:27] move. Whatever Adam said, it come to
[28:30] pass. And somewhere Abraham said that
[28:34] when Adam gave the names of the animals
[28:38] and all the trees, he he named
[28:40] everything, God was happy with Adam.
[28:43] Why? Because he was thinking God's
[28:47] thoughts. So when the fall
[28:51] happened, Adam lost all those
[28:54] inheritance. And because as sons and
[28:57] daughters of God, we are all in Adam, we
[29:00] also lost every
[29:02] inheritance. So when we came back
[29:05] because of the fall, we have we are
[29:09] dying. It came with sickness, gray hair,
[29:14] every headache, every problem came
[29:18] because of the fall.
[29:21] And there was no one
[29:24] worthy to bring us back to that. I could
[29:28] imagine Adam in the garden after he lost
[29:32] access the tree of life. He realized I
[29:35] can't have those things anymore. How sad
[29:38] he going to be that before I know I can
[29:41] say this happened, that happened, that
[29:43] happened. Now I've lost all this.
[29:47] So because we are in Adam, we all lost
[29:50] that because we came through
[29:52] um sex not through that spoken word. We
[29:56] all came in s we were born in sinship
[29:59] iniquity and we all just trapped in this
[30:04] thing and there was no one worthy to
[30:07] bring us back to that stage. And when
[30:11] the cry went out, there was no one but
[30:15] God
[30:15] himself, he left his throne above and
[30:19] came and died and bring us back to
[30:23] himself. And it was not easy for him to
[30:27] go onto the
[30:30] cross
[30:31] because him is a creator of the whole
[30:34] universe. He came and humbled himself
[30:38] even to be born in a
[30:40] manger. And if you read the
[30:45] scriptures on in that the garden of
[30:48] Gethsemane, the Bible said that he
[30:51] prayed and prayed until his sweat became
[30:54] what? Like blood. Because he saw what he
[30:58] has to go through. He saw the scarlet
[31:01] they're going to put on his head. He saw
[31:04] they're going to make him naked. He saw
[31:07] the bruise he's going to receive. He saw
[31:10] all this everything that was going to go
[31:13] that going to happen to him. He saw
[31:15] everything and he said if it were if it
[31:19] be possible let this cup pass over me.
[31:24] But he said not my will let thy will be
[31:28] done. And Abraham said, the angels came
[31:31] and they ministered unto him and he went
[31:34] to face that death. So what I'm trying
[31:37] to say that he that created the whole
[31:41] universe when he was facing that
[31:43] situation, the Bible said he prayed
[31:47] earnestly. And if he has to prayed
[31:49] earnestly, how much about you and me? We
[31:53] need to pray
[31:55] sincerely. And our prayer life is what
[31:59] give us victory as Christians. I know
[32:02] that we prayed every day as we walk is
[32:07] constant with this. But when a situation
[32:09] happens, when there's a desperation, you
[32:12] need to pray earnestly. And the
[32:14] scripture said Elijah was a man subject
[32:17] to like passion like you and me. And he
[32:20] prayed earnestly that it should not rain
[32:23] for three days and rain stop. He prayed
[32:26] and rain came. He was a man subject to
[32:29] like passion like so it means that he
[32:32] made mistake. Elijah has a temper
[32:35] problem. But God was not looking to
[32:38] that. He was looking at the sincerity of
[32:41] his heart. He was looking at how he
[32:44] sincerely cried to him. And if
[32:50] God could do that to him before that
[32:54] blood was shed, what about present
[32:57] tense? He's the same yesterday, today,
[33:01] and forever. I believe when the need
[33:05] arise, God will speak your needs into
[33:08] existence. Amen. It's not something that
[33:10] you going to make up. It's not something
[33:12] that you going to say I'm doing this or
[33:14] I'm doing that. But just be simple and
[33:18] live a simple Christian life and God
[33:21] will bless you. Amen. And
[33:24] that Adamic nature. I believe that Moses
[33:30] exercise that when he was in a situation
[33:34] that's why I'm saying that we don't make
[33:37] anything up when you are faced in a
[33:40] situation and that need arise God will
[33:44] speak for you to move forward because
[33:47] when Moses and the children of Israel
[33:50] was in the same
[33:52] situation they saw the Pharaoh army came
[33:55] in coming They saw in front of them the
[33:59] Red Sea and they were trapped in the
[34:01] middle. They know which way to turn and
[34:05] they cried unto God and they began to
[34:07] accuse Moses. And the prophet Moses
[34:10] asked God, "What shall I do? What will
[34:14] you have me to do?" He began to cry. And
[34:18] the scripture said, "Why cry? Speak and
[34:20] go forward." Amen. And he spoke. And the
[34:24] Red Sea departed and they passed
[34:27] straight. Amen. Who can part the Red
[34:30] Sea? Only God can do that. And that God
[34:34] was in Moses. So when the situation
[34:36] arise and Moses spoke, God came to pass.
[34:40] God stepped in and part the Red Sea for
[34:44] them to go. It wasn't Moses who said,
[34:46] "I'm going to speak for the Red Sea to
[34:48] go." God told him to speak.
[34:51] So what I'm trying to say that we don't
[34:53] make any chemics out of anything just
[34:57] depend on God. As Solomon said that I'm
[35:01] depending on you. I don't know how to
[35:05] rule my people. I don't know how to do
[35:07] even
[35:08] anything. He rely on Christ. And when
[35:12] the need arose, he showed up. And Joshua
[35:16] exact same thing. when he has a
[35:20] need and he need a son to stand still so
[35:24] that he can finish his
[35:26] battle. When that need came, he told the
[35:30] son to stand still and the son obey him.
[35:34] Why? He was exercising the same power
[35:38] that the first Adam has before. Because
[35:40] Adam could say, "Son, stand still." Adam
[35:43] could say this move, this move,
[35:45] everything obey him because he was
[35:47] control over the earth. And you now am
[35:51] aure God, son and daughter of God, a
[35:54] little God, you have control over this
[35:59] universe that the scripture said that
[36:01] speak to this mountain. If you speak to
[36:05] this mountain and do not doubt in your
[36:07] heart, but believe that what you have
[36:10] said to come to pass, you shall have
[36:14] what you say. Not I say, not the pastor
[36:17] say, not any deacon say, but you shall
[36:19] have what you say. That same God is here
[36:23] tonight. If you can believe, all things
[36:26] are possible. Don't doubt in your heart.
[36:30] Believe God and he will bring it to pass
[36:33] because he's the same yesterday, today,
[36:37] and forever. God never changes.
[36:41] Amen.
[36:43] And who are you? Let's give God thanks
[36:47] for sending us a vindicated prophet.
[36:50] William Maron Braham. Amen. He that God
[36:54] used him as a was wave shift for us. We
[36:57] know the first worship the Lord Jesus
[36:59] Christ himself but for the bride of
[37:01] Christ. God used him as an example for
[37:05] us to see how God could use a man
[37:08] dedicated to him. And as Desimon let us
[37:12] listen to the tape the last time when he
[37:15] was in a
[37:16] situation. It all comes when the need
[37:22] arise. We don't run ahead of ourselves.
[37:26] We just be
[37:28] simple and lead a simple Christian life
[37:32] and when the need arise, God will step
[37:37] in. Amen. As we heard from last
[37:41] Wednesday and there was a blazer,
[37:44] thunder, everything that was kept them
[37:47] for so long. And God said, "Go and face
[37:51] that blazer." and he faced it and he
[37:56] spoke and
[37:58] everything. Who did that? It's God that
[38:01] did that through him. And that same God
[38:04] is here tonight. If thou canst believe,
[38:08] all things are possible. He didn't even
[38:11] he didn't show it only in the prophet to
[38:13] leave it back there in
[38:15] 1963 or 65 when he left on the scene.
[38:18] That same God is here tonight. Amen. He
[38:21] can use you if you dedicate yourself to
[38:24] him. When a situation arise, he will
[38:26] show up. He's the same yesterday, today,
[38:30] and forever. He never changes.
[38:34] Amen. I remember I spoke this over and
[38:38] over again. I have a little example of
[38:41] this in a small way. When one time I was
[38:45] going to I was going to work in Lawrence
[38:49] and Lawrence and Bes for a Jewish guy
[38:55] and this Jewish customer did not tell
[38:59] his supervisor that I'll be around. So
[39:03] the supervisor didn't know that I was
[39:05] coming. So he made arrangement for the
[39:08] kitchen guys to work in that facility.
[39:11] So when I went there around 7:00, I get
[39:14] up like 5, get to work like 7 and the
[39:18] size person said, "Philip, you can't
[39:20] work over here. We have to go back
[39:21] tomorrow." I said, "No, I'm here. I got
[39:24] to work. I can't I can't drive all the
[39:27] way and go back." I said, "Okay, let
[39:29] give me a small portion when those
[39:31] kitchen guys I'll park and go home." And
[39:35] he said that those guys always on time,
[39:38] they will show up. So I began to work
[39:42] for like couple of hours and something
[39:45] supernaturally came over me. I can't
[39:47] explain but something came on me and I
[39:50] told the guy those guys are not coming.
[39:54] He said are you serious? I've worked
[39:56] with the guys for 10 15 years. They
[39:59] always on time they will show up. And
[40:02] then something began to play with my
[40:05] mind said the way you have said it
[40:08] boldly. If those guys comes what are you
[40:11] going to say? And then a thought spoke
[40:16] and said when God said let there be
[40:18] light he believed and light came. Amen.
[40:23] And immediately I heard that voice I
[40:26] kept coming. I said yes I believe.
[40:29] And could you believe like 12 or 2:00
[40:32] 12:00 guy came to me asked me Phil you
[40:35] think the guys will come I said I don't
[40:37] know he said you are more powerful than
[40:40] you think
[40:42] why I am not powerful but the god in me
[40:45] is a powerful god
[40:48] and believe me and you those guys did
[40:51] not show up on that day but the guy was
[40:54] so stubborn he was bugging me to work
[40:57] late finish the
[40:58] And something spoke against that the way
[41:01] the guy is bogging you tomorrow the guys
[41:03] will not show up again. Truly the
[41:06] following day when they never show up.
[41:08] They never show up until I finish what I
[41:11] wanted to do. So he's the same
[41:13] yesterday, today and forever. When the
[41:17] need arise, he will let he will step in
[41:21] and spoke. And what really h excite me
[41:25] is that this voice said God when God
[41:28] said let there be light. He believed and
[41:30] light came. So when we speak let's
[41:34] believe and it will come to pass. He's
[41:37] the same yesterday, today and forever.
[41:41] God has never changed. Amen. So back to
[41:46] my word. When he went on Calvary and
[41:50] shed his blood, he said what? It is
[41:55] finished. Wow. When he said it's
[41:58] finished, it means it is Spanish.
[42:01] Pito that's what Italian will say on
[42:04] Calv that day when he was there he said
[42:07] it is Spanish. When he said is finished,
[42:10] it is Spanish. And when he was there
[42:13] before he said it was finished, when the
[42:16] scarlet was on his head, he looked to
[42:19] the crowd. But whilst he was looking
[42:22] upon the crowd, his eyes was on on you
[42:25] and me. He lost. He looked beyond the
[42:28] time and saw you and me. You were on his
[42:32] mind on that day. I was on his mind on
[42:36] that night. On that day, he looked
[42:38] beyond time and saw you and me. While he
[42:43] was going through all that, even though
[42:44] the scarlet robe was on his head and
[42:47] everything, he look even though his eyes
[42:49] was on the crowd on that day, but he
[42:52] looked beyond the time Joshua and you
[42:55] were in his mind. I was in his mind on
[42:58] that time because it's the same
[42:59] yesterday, today, and forever. We are
[43:01] attributes of God. Amen. So he came to
[43:04] go through all that what to save us and
[43:08] to bring us back to himself to bring us
[43:12] back to the first Adam condition so that
[43:15] ye have
[43:17] authority over this earth. Amen. God is
[43:21] the God of the whole universe. But on
[43:23] earth he gave us the authority.
[43:26] In my name you shall cast out devils.
[43:29] You lay your hands on the sick and they
[43:31] shall recover. Amen. He's the same
[43:33] yesterday, today, and forever. He said
[43:36] nothing can stand before you. If you
[43:38] believe me. Amen. No demons, no said
[43:42] even no cancer can stand before the
[43:44] prophet God ministry. And that same God
[43:47] is here. Amen. He's the same yesterday
[43:51] to them forever.
[43:53] God took his prophet. He never took his
[43:55] spirit. That same spirit is here
[43:58] tonight.
[44:00] Amen. if thou can believe because he's
[44:02] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[44:06] He is on time God.
[44:09] Amen. Praise our God. So what am I
[44:13] saying? Let me just read this to cap it
[44:16] up with a it's finished on
[44:19] Calvary. Amen. in why it had to be
[44:24] shepherd. When the great shepherd was
[44:27] smitten, the great shepherd prophet when
[44:30] he was meeting back there, he said, "It
[44:33] is
[44:35] finished." And that minute, oh man, as
[44:39] soon as this shepherd was
[44:42] smitten, it was
[44:45] over. Sin is settled.
[44:49] There was no more sin.
[44:53] They were clean. The penalty was paid.
[44:59] The believers whose name were written in
[45:03] the book of life
[45:06] predestinated from the foundation of the
[45:09] world. It was finished the very minute
[45:12] that Jesus said it was finished.
[45:17] He that great shepherd had come for his
[45:19] sheep. It was finished. God's right hand
[45:24] was pulled from his bosom smitten. Then
[45:27] on Easter he
[45:29] returned raised up again to his bosom
[45:32] and extended it down to you and I in the
[45:37] form of what? Of his word to redeem as
[45:40] what? Back to the original garden. Oh
[45:44] man. As if I know this. I didn't even
[45:46] notice that. What? He redeem us back to
[45:49] what? The original garden from which sin
[45:52] took us from? That's why he redeem us
[45:55] back
[45:56] to see this. Wow. The hidden secret of
[46:00] his great heart was revealed by a
[46:02] prophet shepherd. It was read by what? A
[46:05] prophet shepherd. So he redeem us back
[46:08] to the original garden from where sin
[46:11] took us from.
[46:13] Oh man, that's redemption in three
[46:15] parts. God has redeemed our soul. When
[46:18] he died on Calvary, it is finished. Your
[46:21] sickness, everything, everything you
[46:24] have need of, he paid for it on Calvary.
[46:28] When he said it's finished is finished.
[46:31] You don't go back
[46:33] again. God has done it once and for all.
[46:37] As Brian Tony said one time, he shed his
[46:39] blood once and for all.
[46:42] Not like in the back when they have to
[46:44] kill the lamb over and over again. Every
[46:48] year they have to go and kill it. But he
[46:51] died
[46:52] once. When he died once, it was what?
[46:56] Finish. All your sins, everything that
[46:59] you have need of, it was taken care of.
[47:05] So he's the same yesterday, today, and
[47:09] forever. Everything is finished. Amen.
[47:14] And when that event took
[47:16] place, he divide himself. His blood was
[47:19] shed. The Holy Ghost was
[47:22] given. And on day of Pentecost, he began
[47:25] to multiply
[47:27] himself. And what God did was that
[47:32] um after
[47:33] the dark ages he resurrected the word
[47:37] back through justification,
[47:39] sanctification, baptism of the Holy
[47:40] Ghost. But now we are move past that
[47:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost where the gift
[47:46] and everything operate through the
[47:48] people. Now as one time his daughter
[47:53] said, "I want daddy." He said, "I'm
[47:55] going to buy you a milk. I'm going to
[47:56] buy you toys. I don't want the toy. I
[47:58] want daddy. So what the true bride of
[48:02] Christ is looking for. What we always
[48:05] need or what we have is God himself. The
[48:08] Holy Ghost, the person of Christ himself
[48:11] is past baptism of the Holy Ghost to the
[48:14] Holy Ghost himself, which is God himself
[48:17] in the bride of Christ. That's the age
[48:19] that we are in now. because it's no more
[48:22] you. The bride and the the the the bride
[48:26] and
[48:30] the the bride and Christ it has to be
[48:34] because a woman and a husband becomes
[48:37] what? One. They become one. And that so
[48:41] does a bride and Christ become one. And
[48:45] remember this format is
[48:48] for this form of have I wrote to you
[48:52] that Jesus begin to do and continues to
[48:54] do. His dad didn't stop him. No sir.
[48:58] Okay. The ministry of the bride and the
[49:01] ministry of Christ is what is the
[49:04] same. So the same
[49:07] God is in you and in me and is having
[49:11] the bright ministry
[49:15] now. So you are the one that God lives
[49:18] in. You are the feet that God used to.
[49:20] You are the one that God is speaking
[49:22] through. There's no one. You are the one
[49:26] that you are privileged for ordained,
[49:30] predestinated to hear the voice of God
[49:33] and to what? manifest it in this time.
[49:38] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[49:40] forever. And
[49:42] remember, everyone that follow the Lord
[49:46] Jesus, they take up their cross and
[49:48] follow him. Christianity is not a flurry
[49:53] bed of ease. There's a cost for you and
[49:56] me to pay. It's not a flurry bed of
[50:00] ease. sometimes can cost your family,
[50:03] can cost you everything. And it's God
[50:07] trying your faith to see how you stand
[50:10] by his word. Amen. Remember
[50:14] that
[50:15] Solomon for him to what?
[50:20] ize his gift that God has given to him
[50:24] through that there was when after God
[50:27] visited him and told him I'll give you
[50:29] this wisdom through
[50:32] that two harots one of them their child
[50:36] died you think that child died for just
[50:40] for dying sake that death has a purpose
[50:45] because that child has to die so that
[50:48] they can see and they will bring that
[50:51] problem to Solomon to solve so that they
[50:54] can see the wisdom that God has given to
[50:57] you Solomon to come to what
[51:00] manifestation. So when that child died
[51:03] then the other woman stole the child and
[51:06] said it's mine. Is that right? So when
[51:09] the situation went to Solomon because
[51:12] God has given him that wisdom a chapter
[51:15] before that when that situation arise
[51:19] God gave him wisdom and told them that
[51:21] he's going to cut the child into two
[51:23] pieces divide them into two and the one
[51:26] that the child belongs to her said no
[51:28] don't kill it don't kill the child sorry
[51:31] and then he realized that that is her
[51:33] child the other one wanted him to kill
[51:36] the child so that both of them will what
[51:39] lose lose it. So what I'm trying to say
[51:41] that everything that comes to our life
[51:44] has a purpose. There's a reason for you
[51:47] to go through the things you go through.
[51:50] There's a reason even for death to come
[51:52] to you because to come to your life to
[51:55] for family want to die for this to
[51:57] happen for this sickness for that to
[51:59] happen. There's a purpose for everything
[52:02] and through that through death comes
[52:06] life. Amen. So whatever comes to your
[52:11] life as a son or daughter of God, he
[52:14] said the steps of righteous are what?
[52:17] Ordered of God. So God orders your
[52:21] footsteps. So certain things it seems to
[52:23] be
[52:24] dark but God knows what he's
[52:27] doing. That woman child has to die for
[52:31] the people to see the wisdom that God
[52:34] has given to Solomon. And they said that
[52:38] Bible said from that time the whole
[52:41] world at that time they all feared
[52:44] Solomon because of how much wisdom God
[52:48] gave him to discern the situation. And
[52:52] that same God is here tonight to give
[52:54] you the same wisdom, the same revelation
[52:57] to discern situation that arise in your
[53:00] life because he's the same God and he
[53:03] has never changed. If he gave that
[53:06] wisdom to Solomon, he'll give you
[53:08] revelation, give you the same thing. But
[53:09] you have to desire for it
[53:13] first because Solomon did not ask for
[53:15] riches. He don't ask for anything. He
[53:18] wanted wisdom. So it's a true believer.
[53:22] You want more of revelation, more of God
[53:26] himself. The more you surrender, the
[53:28] more you see him, the more he will take
[53:31] care of you.
[53:33] He said that consider the liies. They do
[53:35] not toil or strain but they are sped by
[53:38] their master. God takes care of them. He
[53:42] will take care of you and me no matter
[53:44] what we going through. So everything
[53:48] comes for a purpose and has for a
[53:50] reason. So back to what I'm saying that
[53:55] when Jesus Christ went through like
[53:59] that on
[54:01] Calvary go through all that he went
[54:03] through those disciples who follow him.
[54:07] Every one of them gave up their life for
[54:11] this Holy Ghost gospel.
[54:14] Peter was crucified with his head down.
[54:19] Paul was killed. Philip they died in um
[54:24] in in India. Thomas died in India. They
[54:28] all of them gave their life for this
[54:31] Holy Ghost gospel. And you and I are not
[54:35] going to find it
[54:38] easy. It's not a flurry bed of easy. But
[54:42] he will see us
[54:43] through. Our promise is not like them
[54:48] who died. You are eagles. We're going to
[54:51] go up and meet the Lord in the air. But
[54:54] before you go, there has to be a
[54:57] squeeze. Come into full
[54:59] manifestation. You're going to be
[55:01] squeezed and whatever you are made up of
[55:03] will show. When the thing reach its
[55:05] final stage, it's in process. Economic
[55:08] hardship, political hardship, everything
[55:11] and religious hardship. It's all coming.
[55:14] the well councel of churches coming into
[55:16] manifestation with this hope on the
[55:19] scene to bring all those well counselor
[55:22] of churches back and war to do what they
[55:24] have to do. But remember when they said
[55:27] peace, peace, peace, sudden destruction
[55:29] comes. There will never be peace on this
[55:31] earth until the prince of peace himself
[55:34] is here. The Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[55:37] He's the one that going to bring peace.
[55:40] But every one of them they go through
[55:43] their lot. It was not easy. And last
[55:49] Friday this scripture came to me very
[55:51] strong. I'm going to read it anyway and
[55:54] then we talk about it about
[55:57] um in Mark chapter 2 verse
[56:00] 1-12. And it says, "And again he entered
[56:04] into
[56:05] capernium after some days, and it was
[56:08] noise that he was in the
[56:10] house. And straight away many were
[56:13] gathered together in so much that there
[56:16] was no room to receive them. No, not so
[56:19] much as about the door." And he preached
[56:22] the word onto
[56:24] them. And they come into bringing one
[56:28] sick of the
[56:29] pulsy which was born of four. And when
[56:34] they could not come near unto him for
[56:36] the press, they uncovered the roof where
[56:39] he was. And when they had broken up,
[56:41] they let down the bed wherein the sick
[56:43] of the person lay. What I'm trying to
[56:46] exercise is that those people do not
[56:49] care how much is going to cause them to
[56:52] repair the roof. It caused them the
[56:55] roof. It caused them the everything. But
[56:57] the salvation, the healing of their
[56:59] friend or of that man was so vital to
[57:02] them that they not care how much going
[57:05] to cost them. So is a true Christian. We
[57:10] don't have to worry or care how much
[57:13] going to cost you to receive this word
[57:15] of God. It's life and death. Between
[57:19] liberty and bondage, between life and
[57:22] death. Amen. Amen. Solomon, oh sorry,
[57:26] Jacob, he wrestled with the angel until
[57:29] he was blessed. He never let that angel
[57:32] go. It became life and death to him. He
[57:36] he cherished that birth right. He
[57:39] doesn't care his mistake. He didn't care
[57:42] how rascal or how his life was, but he
[57:47] cherished that. He cherished that
[57:50] birthright. He did everything to receive
[57:53] it. And you must have the
[57:56] token. Without the token, you cannot
[57:59] make
[58:00] it. And that token is your fair. You got
[58:03] to make sure that you have
[58:05] it. Amen. Because that's only way that
[58:09] will see you through.
[58:12] Amen. And it's all based on the
[58:16] predestination. It's based on the
[58:19] seed. Amen. the highlight
[58:22] Rahab, he applied the token to her whole
[58:26] household. But I believe before that
[58:29] thing happened, people might be sniffing
[58:31] their nose on her that oh this harot
[58:35] girl, what is she made up of? But
[58:38] outside looks so bad, but inside was the
[58:41] seed of God. Amen. When the situation
[58:44] came, she was able to what may show what
[58:48] she was made up of. So it's not so much
[58:50] of the outside, it's how much God is in
[58:54] you. It depends because he came only for
[58:57] his predestinated seat. And if you are
[59:00] part of him, nothing can stop you from
[59:03] seeing this because he's the same
[59:07] yesterday, today. I'm sorry, I'm just
[59:09] all over the place, but just forgive me.
[59:12] I'm just trusting God. Amen.
[59:16] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[59:19] forever. God has never changed.
[59:23] Hallelujah. So redemption is in three
[59:28] parts. Is the redeeming of the soul,
[59:31] body, and
[59:33] spirit. Amen. But some Christians have
[59:36] just emphasized only on the what? The
[59:40] soul
[59:41] part. But
[59:44] God is God that also what give
[59:50] extras. He gave those things that you
[59:53] are not even asked for. He said I will
[59:56] do exceedingly and abundantly more than
[1:00:01] what you can even what think or imagine.
[1:00:05] He's the same yesterday, today and
[1:00:08] forever. Amen. And when Solomon
[1:00:13] When King Solomon asked
[1:00:20] him, when King Solomon asked him for the
[1:00:25] wisdom, Bible said over here, "And God
[1:00:27] said unto
[1:00:29] him, because thou has asked this thing,
[1:00:33] and has not asked for thyself for long
[1:00:36] life, neither hast asked for riches for
[1:00:39] thyself, nor has asked for life of thy
[1:00:42] enemies, but have asked for thyself
[1:00:44] understand the judgment. Behold, I have
[1:00:47] done according to thy words. I've given
[1:00:51] thee a wise and understanding heart, so
[1:00:54] that there was none like thee before
[1:00:56] thee. And I have also given thee that
[1:00:58] which thou has not asked, both riches
[1:01:02] and honor, so that there shall not be
[1:01:05] any among the kings like une. He said,
[1:01:07] "I will give you what you have not asked
[1:01:11] for."
[1:01:13] So what I'm trying to express
[1:01:17] tonight that our God is able to do
[1:01:22] abundantly, exceedingly more than what
[1:01:25] you can even think of or
[1:01:28] imagine. Don't underestimate God.
[1:01:33] Don't underestimate the power of God
[1:01:36] that dwells inside you as a son or
[1:01:39] daughter of
[1:01:40] God. When you live that clean Christian
[1:01:44] life, when demons see you, they come to
[1:01:48] they they
[1:01:49] scattered. They don't want to have
[1:01:51] nothing to do with you. Greater is he
[1:01:54] that is in you than he that's in the
[1:01:56] world. Greater is God who is in you
[1:01:59] tonight than any problem you are facing.
[1:02:03] Than any sickness you are going through.
[1:02:06] That sickness cannot stand before you.
[1:02:08] If thou can believe all things are
[1:02:11] possible. Even if you having financial
[1:02:15] problems, God is greater than that
[1:02:17] financial problem. He's Jehovah Gyra. He
[1:02:21] promised I'll provide all your needs.
[1:02:25] The same God that spoke Abraham needs
[1:02:28] into
[1:02:29] existence. Amen.
[1:02:33] When Abraham needed a a
[1:02:36] ram and there was no hope
[1:02:41] anywhere. His son, imagine the very son,
[1:02:46] he has believed God for for 25
[1:02:50] years. He was asked to sacrifice the
[1:02:52] very son. God tried
[1:02:55] him. And if you're a seed or daughter of
[1:02:59] Abraham, you're going to go through
[1:03:02] trials. You're not going to have it
[1:03:05] easy. But you have to stand on the word
[1:03:07] of God. And Abraham stood by the word of
[1:03:11] God. And even
[1:03:14] before he took his son and put him on
[1:03:18] that, the faith in him was so great. He
[1:03:22] told his servants that you wait for me
[1:03:26] in the lad are going to worship and you
[1:03:28] come back. How did he know that he's
[1:03:31] going to come
[1:03:33] back? That very time that God told him
[1:03:36] to go and sacrifice. His confidence was
[1:03:38] in God was so much and he believed that
[1:03:43] God gave that son to
[1:03:45] him as someone who was important to give
[1:03:49] child to give birth to a child and if
[1:03:52] God could give him a child at that age
[1:03:56] even if he killed that son God is able
[1:03:59] to what raise him up. Amen. So is you
[1:04:02] and me. The same God that gave you
[1:04:06] salvation of your soul. If God is able
[1:04:10] to give you the salvation of your soul
[1:04:12] and has redeemed you to himself, what
[1:04:15] else can he do for you? He's able to do
[1:04:20] everything.
[1:04:21] The greatest thing of all that the whole
[1:04:24] world need is the salvation of your
[1:04:27] soul. And God has given it to you. And
[1:04:31] if he has given you that that should be
[1:04:33] the most you should be the most happiest
[1:04:35] people on the face of earth
[1:04:39] because death has no power over you
[1:04:43] because when Jesus Christ died he
[1:04:45] defeated heaven hell and grave
[1:04:49] they under your
[1:04:51] feet that's why Paul said death where is
[1:04:54] your sin grave where is your
[1:04:57] victory God is here tonight amen Amen.
[1:05:02] So he spoke. Abraham knew into
[1:05:06] existence. When the time came, Abraham
[1:05:09] was so faithful to God. Oh man, if
[1:05:12] you're a son or daughter of God, God
[1:05:14] wants that same faithfulness. That same
[1:05:17] faithfulness required from all of us. He
[1:05:20] was so faithful that he was willing to
[1:05:23] cut his side into pieces. He was so
[1:05:25] faithful to kill his only son. He took
[1:05:28] the knife like that and that voice said,
[1:05:32] "Abraham, I've realized that you love
[1:05:35] me. Hold on your um" And then a lamp
[1:05:41] cries somewhere there. He took him to
[1:05:43] sacrifice that instead. That's how
[1:05:46] faithful Abraham was. And if we are sons
[1:05:48] and daughters of God, we got to be
[1:05:51] faithful in everything that comes our
[1:05:54] way because God is able to take care of
[1:05:58] us. He will never leave us nor forsake
[1:06:01] us. He's on time. God, he may not come
[1:06:04] when you want him to be, but he'll be
[1:06:06] there right on time. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:06:10] That token is here. When the prophet of
[1:06:13] God, when that se were revealed in 1963,
[1:06:17] everything that we have need of is done.
[1:06:23] Everything was complete. That third was
[1:06:25] released. The third is a revealing of
[1:06:28] the seven
[1:06:30] seals. The things that Paul and the rest
[1:06:33] were looking
[1:06:35] into, God made it available for you and
[1:06:38] me. Amen.
[1:06:40] So we got to be
[1:06:42] faithful. We got to trust God when you
[1:06:46] can't see it our way through because our
[1:06:48] God is on time God. He's the same
[1:06:51] yesterday, today, and forever. He will
[1:06:55] never leave you nor forsake you. Amen.
[1:06:58] That God is real God. He is the same
[1:07:01] God. The God that could oh man when the
[1:07:05] children of Israel when they didn't have
[1:07:09] food to
[1:07:10] eat, he sent a mana.
[1:07:13] Amen. And that mana, you couldn't keep
[1:07:17] it for the next
[1:07:18] day. Wow. You have to eat it fresh. It's
[1:07:22] a fresh skill.
[1:07:24] And in this age, God is providing our
[1:07:28] mana every day. Amen. the word of God
[1:07:32] for today present stage of his ministry
[1:07:36] and we are eagles and being eagles we
[1:07:40] eat fresh food fresh kill amen we can't
[1:07:46] eat on those contaminated food it's not
[1:07:49] like hulk you see hulk can go so far but
[1:07:52] to a certain stage you can't go more
[1:07:55] than that but eagle he has the eagle eye
[1:07:58] go through all the stuff amen Amen. Oh
[1:08:01] my brother Desmond said, God told a
[1:08:04] prophet to face the storm. And eagles
[1:08:08] always face the storm. They don't run
[1:08:10] away from the storm. They go right into
[1:08:13] it. Amen. So I encourage you tonight,
[1:08:16] don't run away from your problems. Don't
[1:08:18] try to hide from the problems. Don't try
[1:08:21] to try. Don't hide when situation arise
[1:08:25] that looks so hard. Just go through it.
[1:08:29] Just face it. Face that devil. Face the
[1:08:32] enemy. He's under your feet. He's just a
[1:08:35] bluff. You know what bullies does? They
[1:08:38] try to bully you. If they bully you and
[1:08:41] you come down like them, they become
[1:08:42] happy. But when they bully and you bully
[1:08:45] them back, they run away. Amen. Sick
[1:08:49] boy.
[1:08:51] Hallelujah. No wonder. When the devil
[1:08:54] home said when he said boo, he was boo.
[1:08:59] He said boo back to him with the Bible
[1:09:01] and he become what? Lilo. Amen.
[1:09:04] Hallelujah. Golat was boasting but he
[1:09:07] boasted on the wrong time at the right
[1:09:09] wrong at the right wrong person. Amen.
[1:09:13] David was just a beauty kitty like that.
[1:09:16] Amen. Very skin doesn't have nothing.
[1:09:19] But what he has in him was God of the
[1:09:21] universe. Amen. He had gold in his skin
[1:09:24] hiding his heart. Amen. That's what
[1:09:26] golad forget. And he said that you you
[1:09:30] come against me in the name of your face
[1:09:33] God. The face that God created. That's
[1:09:36] what golad had confidence in. But he
[1:09:39] said you come against me in the name of
[1:09:40] your face God. But I come against you in
[1:09:42] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Today
[1:09:45] I'll take your head off. Amen. and you
[1:09:48] think like that five and boom that giant
[1:09:52] was down. So every problem every giant
[1:09:56] you facing tonight or those online
[1:09:59] wherever you are whatever giant you
[1:10:01] facing in the name of Jesus that giant
[1:10:04] has to crumble. Amen. Nothing can stand
[1:10:07] before you. Amen. In the name of Jesus
[1:10:11] receive your desires. Whatever you have
[1:10:14] you know receive it tonight.
[1:10:17] Don't leave here in the same way you
[1:10:18] came. Jesus Christ is here. He's here
[1:10:22] tonight. If thou kind believe, all
[1:10:24] things are possible to them that
[1:10:26] believe. He's here to answer your needs.
[1:10:29] He's here to live in you. He's here to
[1:10:31] provide you. He's here to give you
[1:10:33] anything you have need of.
[1:10:36] Whatever you need, salvation, healing,
[1:10:40] money,
[1:10:41] whatever, don't be
[1:10:43] scared. Ask abundantly. So that your joy
[1:10:48] may become full. Amen. So that your joy
[1:10:52] may become full. Because one time became
[1:10:54] so clear to me that the same
[1:10:59] faith that you can use to pray when you
[1:11:02] get a headache for that heading ghost.
[1:11:05] That same
[1:11:06] faith when you facing a big giant cancer
[1:11:11] whatever that sickness is. If you have
[1:11:14] confidence for God to heal you from uh
[1:11:17] headache when any big sickness whatever
[1:11:20] happen that same God will bring you out.
[1:11:25] So there's nothing like a small sin or a
[1:11:28] big sin. So there's no small thing or
[1:11:31] when you have
[1:11:34] confidence for the little thing that
[1:11:37] same confidence you have to have for the
[1:11:39] big things. Don't let anything scare you
[1:11:43] because greater is he that is in you
[1:11:46] than he that's in the world. He's the
[1:11:49] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:11:54] Amen. That's all I have for tonight.
[1:11:56] Amen.
[1:12:01] Amen.
[1:12:08] Let's have a little word of
[1:12:12] prayer. Oh, how gracious eternal God and

[1:12:38] desires of their heart. So I pray that
[1:12:42] your grace will be extended and they
