living in uh the end of the end times and the world has uh their attention on signs you know they're looking at signs and and right now um you know we're at we're we're in a time where signs and wonders are beginning to happen all over the world praise God and so um we're going to look at that you know here today we're going to see how far we can get we've got a small presentation for you so we're going to we're going to end the preaching just a little bit early today maybe by uh 12:40 or so and we're going to give um the Sunday School an opportunity to bless us with something that they wanted to do for Easter but how many knows that we're still in the Easter season don't ever leave the Easter season praise God let's go to our scripture amen So today we're going to be looking at um signs in the heavens but in particular um what we're going to be focusing on and what you know I want your minds to move into okay is go to the next Slide the voice of the sign there's a lot of signs that are taking place around us and you know people are looking for signs and people want to see signs and they're all bewildered by the signs but there's a voice that is speaking out of every sign that God gives amen amen praise God let's go to our first scripture the heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork day unto Day utth speech and night unto night showeth knowledge there is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard their line is gone out through all the Earth and their words to the end of the world in them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race amen praise God let us pray father Lord Lord this scripture alone just blessed us tremendously Lord just uh you know we could just go home and rejoice right now but father we know that there's just so much more that you have for us and so we're asking that your anointing will come and Lord just take control over every atmosphere around every one of these that are in the house of the Lord here today Father may your presence go and move through the pews and through the hearts and through the lives and Lord may they may they hear something Lord between the lines Lord I know that I can bring you've placed all these things on my heart all these scriptures and all these quotes but Lord it takes your anointing and your spirit to bring it to life that's the voice that's the voice that we're interested in this morning Lord speak to us through these words through this uh Ministry this morning Lord take this vessel I give it to you I Surrender it completely Lord because I know I can't do it but I'm trusting you and may you take control now and bless your people in Jesus name amen God bless you Saints you may be seated praise God we look at that scripture there and there is just so much that we can draw from there the heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork day unto Day utth speech in other words God is in the heavens God is in the firmament God is in the Sun God is in the moon God is in every Star God is in every constellation everything that we look at even when we look at nature we see God we see death burial and Resurrection when we look right now we're entering into the spring you can see all the trees out there they look dead but there's life inside of those trees there's life starting to climb up into those trees and pretty soon they're going to Bud forth and the evidence is going to be the buds and the flowers and the leaves and it goes to show that Jesus Christ is alive the same yesterday today and forever if you can't see God in everything then you need to look again you need to open your heart and your understanding because in a day like this we should be rejoicing because God is is real he's he everywhere we can look into the Stars you know he told Abraham he said Abraham look up he says can you Number the Stars he was showing Abraham he says that's as many as I those are those are all mine he was talking about you and me he was talking about every single one that was in his heart in his mind from before the foundations of the world he had a plan that he was going to fulfill and that you and I would be a part of that plan and as dispensations move forward there is no speech nor language where their voices is not heard all those stars all those planets all those constellations all the signs and wonders every time that God would raise up a prophet there would be a voice in the sign amen the prophet would come out one Prophet would come out and and show his backside why would he do that because God was going to send a sign to the people but you had to recognize the sign and the voice that was coming from the sign amen praise God glory to God their language and and where their voice is not heard their line is gone out throughout all the Earth and their words to the end of the world he's talking about every constellation every Star every attribute everything that he had in his mind he's placed it in the heavens how many times have we seen the signs we've seen it through the world word when they saw the star of David when they saw when the when the Magi they would study the stars they knew that Messiah was on the earth when they could recognize that North Star that was shining bright they followed it until they came to the word of God Amen and every sign must lead you to the word of God Amen praise God glory to God let's go to the next scripture amen thank you Jesus in Genesis 1: 14 to 18 and God said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night praise God aren't you glad that God sent his word to separate the darkness out of your life do you know that the light is the word for this hour that that his word is the light and without light you walk in darkness boy oh boy are we going to have an eclipse glory to God let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years and let them be for lights in the firmament of Heaven to give light upon the Earth and it was so and God made two great lights notice they're both great lights one to rule the day and one to rule the night Hallelujah praise God forever more the greater light to Rule the Day the Lesser light to rule the night he made the Stars also and God s them set them in the firmament of Heaven to give light upon the Earth and to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness and God saw that it was good hallelujah praise God every one of those Stars when you look up I used to wonder why I was so am Amazed by the Stars everybody aren't you amazed have you ever gone up north you know and just laid down on the on the sand in the in in in the very peak of the you know the the darkness of night and look up into the Stars you will see God's God's Bible speaking constantly it's glittering over here all of a sudden a star falls over here oh somebody fell somebody's Fallen away from from the Lord somebody's left somebody's uh something's going on because the star falls and it vanishes you see everything is written in the heavens every life there's a there's a book of life and there's the Lamb's Book of Life let me tell you if your name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life your star is there it'll be steady it'll never move it'll never be taken it'll never backslide it'll never deny the word of God it'll stand firm it'll sit in the firmament and God will bring it into its position when the time comes when the sun you know you know the constellations the way they work is that that the sun moves through the constellations and as the sun moves through the constellations they they they they shine they begin to shine and they show themselves more and you have what's called planetary alignments based on the movement of the sun the sun is is a type of God nothing can can survive nothing can live nothing can can can exist without the sun here on this Earth amen any botney life anything that that that that that that lives and breathes upon the Earth it relies upon the sun did you know that even the animals rely upon the Sun how are they going to eat what they eat if the things that that that are eating are not going to grow so that they can eat them and so forth and everything else because it's plant life that God gave for food so everything evolves and revolves and requires the sun glory to God without it you're in total darkness Hallelujah glory to God so we're looking today we're looking at at the signs in the sky signs in the heaven the significance of these signs what is the real purpose of them in this day you see God placed them for signs Seasons days and years and so those three have to be acknowledged he's placed them there for signs he's placed them there in a certain season and they're for days and for years because there's going to be a day that certain things happen there's going to be years that certain things when we're talking about time here on Earth we're here on Earth everybody come to Earth okay but get your spiritual thinking cap on okay because everything we're talking about is a type okay but here on Earth we have to recognize that that we deal with time we deal with days we deal with years and God said in his scripture in ecclesiastics to everything there is a time and there is a season amen so there's a sense of mystery and wonder and also a lot of fear you know that there's people that are that are you know wondering boy is this going to be the end of the world when this eclipse takes place next or tomorrow people are want there's people that are calling for doomsday there's people that are calling for this some are saying Jesus is going to come tomorrow some are saying the Rapture is going to happen tomorrow some are saying that it's that it's going to be total chaos and and and Wars are going to break out tomorrow I'm telling you I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow I'm just listening for the voice that is coming from the sign because the spirit of God is speaking to us as individuals giving us Revelation and understanding of his word all I can tell you is this one thing for sure that every sign and every Star and every constellation and everything that that's written in the heavens is the same as it's written in the word of God and it's talking about one thing the Plan of Redemption amen the plan of Jesus Christ it started with Virgo it ends with Leo the Lion he came the first time he's coming the second time this whole thing whatever you look at the sun the moon the eclipses all these events that are happening in the world they lead and should point you as Sons and Daughters of God to one voice and one word and that is the voice and the word of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to the rest of the world there's all kinds of chaos we're going to be looking at stuff like that we can see the mystery and the Wonder in these signs and we can know that these signs are you know have a significance in the world just look at Friday New York experienced an earthquake for the first time I think it was in 200 years that they've had that type of uh seismic event those are unusual things that are taking place you look at the condition uh you know you look at Taiwan they just had a terrible earthquake you look at um you know uh Wars that are taking place right now in in Ukraine in Israel in in uh Haiti and all these different like there's total chaos and we knew that the scripture told us that there would be Wars rumors of wars the sun would would turn to blood or the moon would turn to blood and there would be signs and wonders in the heaven all of these things we know from the word of God that they were already told to us we know that this is all scriptural but to the rest of the world that do not believe in the light will walk in darkness and so the Signs Now become fearful they become devastating to certain people they're they're afraid of what's going to happen tomorrow there's people that are that are not sending their kids to school there's people that are loading up on groceries and water and all kinds of you know fear that's been set into the hearts of the people but there's a reason for every single sign when we recognize that it comes from the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ glory to God Amen listen next slide William brandham says here now that's what God gives a sign for is to attract the attention of the people that's what a sign is for is to attract attention and we go down through the scripture here as we teach it now for a few minutes and find out if that isn't so that he gives these signs to attract attention and then when he gets the attention of the people then the voice of the sign begins to speak you see God's God's trying to get your attention we know that listen we know that he's he's he's got the attention of the people out there but their attention is not on him they're not looking to him for deliverance instruction leadership what to do how to understand to know that God has an escape plan for you God has something in store for those that know him those that have been called and have recognized him behind the sign that it's him it's his voice that's in the sign so so so the voice of the sign begins to speak Jesus healed the sick to attract their attention see then when he begin to preach see they always it attracts attention the burning bush was given to Moses to attract The Runaway prophet's attention a lot of people are going to and fro they don't know what church to go to they don't know what to believe they don't know if there's a trinity they don't know if there's a one God they don't know if there's a mighty God and then an an almighty God they don't know if God is in Buddha they don't know if God is in Muhammad they don't know if God is in in the in the the the punjabis because they've got all kinds of different gods like where is God so he's got to grab their attention but remember he can never change and it's his voice that will that will bring you out of the chaos or the condition that you might be in here this morning whatever the circumstances are I don't know I'm bringing a message here about the voice of the sign and I want you to recognize that there's a lot of signs that are going on around us but can you recognize the sign for this morning because that's what I'm interested in that's what stirred my heart God God was speaking to my heart through this through this I I was you know I was reading and then I would study and then I would get a part of the message and I couldn't quite you know and I was saying Lord I just you just know like as a minister you're you're waiting on that anointing to just strike the word and you know when it happens and I was moving through the house all week and I would go here go there and I was you know and it was it was on Friday night I was up right up until 11:00 still working I probably spent 30 hours on this and I was still not there I was just Lord you know and then I walked into my bedroom to get ready to go to sleep and my wife plays a tape she puts a tape on every night you know and I walked into the room and boom the spirit of God just just stopped me right in my and and I'm and the prophet was speaking on the voice of the sign and I said there it is that's where go that's where you're talking now now all of a sudden the anointing started to come around and he started to say what did you recognize what is it that called you what is it that that that pulled you when you went into that church when you went into when you met with those Brothers when you went into brother Gabriel's uh uh you know uh place there to buy furniture something attracted your attention and it wasn't the the the the fact that you were looking for signs and wonders but a voice a voice interceded and came in and and started to deal with you personal started to deliver you personally started to deal with situations with you personally and I said oh I see Lord in every sign in everything that's why that's scripture that we read from from from The Book of Psalms at the beginning there it was it just became so real that he utters he speaks he's constantly speaking to us revealing himself to us and we need to recognize what he's saying so he you know he said you know Moses was a runaway prophet and he needed to catch his attention and he turned aside to see what it was then the sign gave a voice hallelujah praise God you might be hearing me read scripture this morning you might hear me read a a quote you might see a picture that we put up here this morning and you might hear a comment on it or some kind of a fact surrounding it and God s just in in instantly just comes right in rides that word directly pierces your heart and shows you exactly what he is saying to you thank you that's what you need to be interested in here this morning when you come into Good Neighbor Ministries I want you to know you're coming into a place where God has absolute preeminence thank the ministers that stand here we've been trained by a pastor that showed us how to get out of the way that's something that's very important to be a minister of this hour where God wants to have total preeminence he doesn't need our thoughts he doesn't need our ideas he just needs us to surrender he will speak to every single need that's in the house here this morning not one of you can leave here the same way if you're paying attention if you fall asleep sweet dreams thank you Jesus but you might wake up to a nightmare because things are not going to get better here on Earth and we need to know what the word says about us and what we need to do glory to God so now these voices and signs are to alert the people of God's word word it's to alert us back to the word not to the sign the sign is speaking and it's telling us go back to the word that's me in the word that's me in the sun when you look at the sun you can see that I give life and light to everything so if you if if you're going to recognize my word you're going to need my spirit and you're going to need to know how to receive my spirit so that when you read the word it becomes life it becomes clear it gives you easy easy instruction on how to live how to please God what's required in order to receive his anointing in your life and his Deliverance in your life praise God it's just about ready to be Vindicated amen always a sign is to attract the attention of the people let's go to the next slide and so here now when we look you know when we look at um sign for example you know signs are are are something that that that just attracts the attention of the people but there's a lot more in the sign amen praise God it's to attract us to the word of God glory to God here you know uh he says here um the seed shall not be air with the Shu Jesus said no man cometh to me except my father has drawn him and all that my father has ha given me they will come my sheep my doves hear my voice a stranger they will not follow and what is the voice of God it's the word of God what's any man's voice but his word it's the word of God they'll hear the word of God and so when we look at signs we look at signs in the heavens signs in the skies are you know they recur over and over and over again particularly in prophetic timelines when we look at prophecy okay they often they're they're used to signify important events there's a lot of important events that are taking place right now within the body of Jesus Christ and we want to we want to know all about it we want to let the Holy Spirit come and have his his way through this ministry and through our lives so that he can fulfill the part that we are a part of so that he can move through our lives these signs are not just random occurrences or natural phenomena but they are divinely orchestrated by God Amen they serve as a Divine communication tool a way for God to speak to his people and to the world because at the same time that he's speaking light and instruction and giving you inspiration and Revelation on the word of God the word is being spoken to those that are souls that are in prison people that can never receive the light because they choose to walk in the darkness you talk to somebody that that is a Buddhist and their their mind is in this world of Buddhism and that they're all part of the universe and they've got so many truths but they're leaving out the very link that connects them to Elohim the self-existent one the universe the one who created all things they don't want to allow his light to come in to Enlighten them to the plan that he has for their life and the plan that he has for Humanity because at the same time that he's speaking through this these signs to the people of the world and like we said there people are being put into fear put into doubt put into all kinds of chaos and everything else but to the bride it's shalom thy light has come thy Victory is is here I am your Victory I am your light I am the way the truth and the life amen so there a way of God communicating the sun and the moon are significant in that uh they are signs and to understand the signs we need to recognize what the word says about those signs the sun is a Ty type of Christ and the Moon is a type of the church the Bride of Jesus Christ and it also types Israel remember Israel is a type of the bride and all the events that are now taking place that's why simultaneously there are events and here let's just move on here and then you're going to see as I come into the seasons but when you hear the word and you hear the word being spoken as a gentile remember God is speaking to the Gentiles God is speaking through the sun he's speaking to the Gentiles and those that are that that recognize the light they come into the word they come into the body of Christ the rest that reject the light they stay in darkness there's no light in them and therefore they walk in darkness amen praise God but seeing the signs is not enough it's like reading the Bible the letter s but the spirit gives it life and when you receive the light of God's word you receive the Holy Spirit you you obey God's how do I get the Holy Spirit you need to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I've said it over and over again I remember listen I didn't understand anything but when I got the Revelation that my life needed to be washed of an old life and needed to be buried and and and and left behind there was there was one thing that I was looking for the tank I said I want to be baptized I want to I want to I want to express something that's taking place within me and so that's why I had to run to the water amen and if you haven't been to the water yet it's not going to supernaturally change you but I will see and others will see that a supernatural change has taken place in you Hallelujah because it's God that does the work it's God that delivers it's God that that that sets the people free amen praise God and so it's not enough just to to to watch the signs to read about the signs you can go on Google and you can type in uh uh you know April 6th um uh eclipse and you can find all kinds of interpretations you can go on YouTube you can get 50 different interpretations on what's going to happen it's going to do you no good if you don't have the spirit of God to discern what you're watching what you're hearing amen and that only happens by the word of God Jesus says I will give you the comforter which is the Holy Ghost and he will guide you into all truth he didn't say some truth all truth that's the beauty when when when when when the Lord enlightened my mind he started to answer answer every question that I had it was like sitting with Solomon you know because he he he could answer every question he had the wisdom uh you know to to because he was the greater than Solomon he was the greater than Solomon praise God he was the one that could answer every question he could he says I knew you before you even came to the Earth you know he would tell us things like that do you hear him telling you those things I knew you before you came here you might be sitting at Good Neighbor Ministries here on April the 7th you know 19 uh 2024 but let me tell you God knew you before there was even a number you were a star in the heavens praise God hallelujah and now you walk in the light and have come out of the darkness seasons in scripture Seasons interpreted the Hebrew word moed it's from it's it's translated to English as Seasons but in fact derives from the Hebrew word ad which means eternity that's what it means that that that we are Eternal and that we are being expressed in a certain season and Israel at at the same time it's a common word used uh in the word of Hebrew for for holidays for festivals because they always took place at the same time of the year that's why these signs in the moon and in the stars and in the sun you notice that they always take place right around Hebrew holidays there's a reason for that God is in every single sign and everything that we if if you start to study and look into all of this you will see that God is dealing with a chosen people and I'm not just talking about Israel Israel is the type of the real of the reality God's Sons and Daughters God's stars that were placed there from before the foundations of the world those that came from God that are God attributes of God that are God all we're doing is we're playing it out as humans we're here in a human Dimension and everything is playing it self out in a human way but if we pay attention we'll see that everything is really scripturally it is that we are Supernatural attributes of God that are being called back to Eternity we are not creatures of time we're we're in time but our true identity is eternal with God and so these things that they happen in Seasons meaning the great lights the Moon the sun will be used as signs for upcoming events and the second meaning that can be understood from the original Hebrew is that the sun and the moon will be used for determining the time of the holidays as we can still see in the Hebrew calendar even today in which the moon and the sun play a significant role in determining when will be the exact date of biblical holidays amen praise God we're in the time of the Passover right now and we're having what's called a total solar eclipse here in the in the time of of the Hebrew uh Passover where it's it's Easter to them it's the Passover to us it's Easter to us it's about the resurrection of Jesus Christ to them it was that God passed over them and did not destroy them the death angel did not destroy them so to them all these all these holidays and all these um Jewish Hol holidays that they that they observe they all tie in Back to the word of God for a time in a season there's even a time of the of the Rapture there's a time for for them to gather together there's a time for everything to take place there's a holy convocation that's now moving into place where where you know where where the the whole world is going to witness things and and chaos is going to come into the land and we're going to go into a Great Tribulation and Israel is going to be awakened from their sleep to recognize that Jesus Christ is actually the Messiah praise God and the Lord so we know that these Seasons they they are significant in that they are uh uh all tied to describing God's time for his people here on this earth and the season that they're going to enter into we are now in the season of the Rapture amen we are now in the season to be translated out of this Dimension then the Lord has days and years well that's simple the Lord has appointed particular days and years for things to happen here on this Earth and we don't know the day or the hour but rest assured that the Lord knows the exact time for everything because in ecclesiastics 31 to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heavens you see it always goes back to the God's first Bible amen praise God let's go to the next listen to brother brandham here he's speaking he says God's first Bible was in the skies the Zodiac it starts off and runs every Age The First beginning with the zodiac is a virgin that's how he come first the last figure in the zodiac is Leo the Lion the second coming just before there is a cross fishes which is the cancer age that we're living in now praise God right from the future home he was talking about dispensations and time and things and he was God was giving him a revelation on the future home God was showing him that that for for the Bride of Jesus Christ there's going to be a time where she's going to be restored back to to to that Perfection again amen I don't want to get into all of that that's just another message all in itself praise God but here the Zodiac has been perverted today we know about the Virgin we know about Leo the Lion and we know all about the different signs that are in the Zodiac but yet you know there's a lot of perversion that's going on and people have taken the Zodiac to distract the people from the word of God and people even you are getting caught up into these things you'll go and you'll start reading the horror scope listen to the word itself horror scope it's a scope of of horror that's that that you know if you believe in those things and you think that the horoscope you're going to go into you know the Toronto Star I see people all they do you know I was it's funny I was with some you know family and one of them you know came and visited and he saw the Toronto son my dad reads the you know reads the newspapers and we were there with our family and the first thing he went right to the newspaper didn't even really pay attention to thing he went straight to the horoscope I looked at him I go what are you doing I read the horoscope I said oh okay yeah people live their lives based on what the horoscope tells them that day and they think that whatever it says there oh boy I'm having a bad day today it says that the Moon is over here and if the moon is over there then I'm going to be schizophrenic today so I guess I'm going to have to be schizophrenic today you see these things do affect people the moon the stars they do affect people okay but you as a son or a daughter of God that's filled with the Holy Ghost that's been sealed by the Holy Ghost until the day of your Redemption okay that's been washed and cleansed of all of that because that's all sin that's all unbelief remember anything anybody that's a psychic that'll tell you that you know this is going to happen to you that's going to happen to you this is going to go wrong this is going to go great listen if they aren't connected to the word of God and everything that they say isn't 100% I don't care if 90% of it is true it could be 99 % true but if it ain't 100 it ain't God because God is perfect I remember going to a psychic you know but God protects his children I didn't know God at the time but I was told by a very wealthy individual you go see this lady she's in Hamilton she's going to tell you things you want to know about your business you want to know about this and that person that told me to go today they are a company that's worth over 7 $700 million that company okay I'm not going to get into the names but they were personal friends of mine and they told me go there and I remember I was just young I just opened up fantasy over here in Oakville I thought okay I'm going to go I'm going to listen to him he's got four stores already you know I went there I knocked on the door I'm waiting there the lady opens the door she goes oh she says you know you have a very strong aura I said ' really okay she says come on in I went inside I sat down sat at the T at the desk I remember clearly she was sitting on that side of the desk I was sitting here I'm looking she goes give me your watch took my watch off I gave it to her she's holding the watch she goes like this are you looking for Jesus I said no thank she says I see the face of Jesus I said really I I said this lady's like religious or something right she goes back she comes all I can see is Jesus I see the face of Jesus she says but your father he has a hearing problem I said ow you got my attention because he does and she says you your your your lineage is is is from a priest Hood you come from a a a priest background of some sort he says you have priests in your family I said no he says oh okay well Jesus somehow I can't get anything more that's all I can really say and I left that place and I forgot all about it and I didn't think anything else of it and it wasn't for another seven years after that that was in 1987 in 1994 is when I came to the Lord and I recognized that Jesus was a big part of my past and my [Applause] future now what am I saying I'm not giving glory to the psychic because even the one that came and met brother brandham on the on the bus and said hey buddy did you know that you've got a star over you that you've got a you've got a sign over you and that he says get away from me but she knew because she was able to recognize she had a gift to see certain things but only what God allows them to see amen amen praise God but look let's read the the next slide here Jeremiah 10: 1-3 he says hear ye the word which the Lord speaketh unto you oh House of Israel and when he's talking about the house of Israel I want you to know he's talking to you he's talking to the Bride of Jesus Christ he says oh House of Israel thus sayeth the Lord learn not the way of the Heathen and be not dismayed at signs of Heaven in other words he's telling them listen don't you be getting caught up into the Zodiac horoscopes there's a real zodiac that's God's Bible but you need that interpreted by the spirit of God himself and remember God is his own interpreter he will make it plain you will not need to figure anything out he will he will uh interpret it right into your own life just like he did with me when I went to see that psychic I had no idea that Jesus was going to be my whole life but today he's all he's everything he means everything to me because because there is no no future but Jesus Christ the coming of the Lord he says don't you believe those Heathen and be not dis dismayed at the signs of Heaven for the Heathen are dismayed at them everybody oh boy I got to go see my psychic people I I got friends and family they visit psychics and I've seen some of them that have gone to see psychics and their lives went completely backwards not forwards when I tell him listen you want you want the real psychic you need to come to Jesus Christ he's the only one that can discern your life tell you exactly where you came from where you're going he can tell you everything about yourself he can tell you the part that you're going to play in his economy he's got a place for you he loves you he's he's got something beyond what you could possibly even imagine that's who you want to meet is Dr Jesus you want to meet him he'll tell you all about it for the customs of the people are what they're vain it's in vain they they want to go there and they want to hear good they want you know all these psychics now do you know that it's a big it's huge it's a huge business you can go online now and you can sign up for for for Madame Jezebel you can log in and put your name and email address and and your Visa card make sure that you can't go any further until you put your Visa card in because you want to hear exactly what's happening in your life what God what what the Stars they never mention Jesus Christ they mention the Stars what the stars have for you what the constellations are going to say about you it's not the word of God you know what it is it's a distraction it's a business to distract the people from the word of God we need to recognize the voice of the sign and we need to know that there's only one voice and the voice is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen praise God let's look at the next Deuteronomy here he says if there be found among you within any of thy Gates which the Lord thy God giveth thee man or woman that hath wrought wickedness in the sight of the Lord thy God in transgressing his Covenant and hath gone and served other gods and worshiped them either the Sun or the Moon or any host of Heaven which I have not commanded God don't want you worshiping the son there's people that worship the son and there's people that are called Christians that they you know like like like look at the Roman Catholic Church they've got the son you know they've got the son at every one of their uh you know churches a lot of them will have a big son there you know because they they indirectly they don't realize but but it's Pagan teaching it's pagan rituals to worship the Sun or worship the moon or worship the Stars that's not about worshiping the Stars the moon the sun it's about worshiping Jesus Christ who is in the stars the moon and the sun he speaketh through them by Revelation to the Sons and Daughters of God Amen those that will accept him receive his light amen praise God next slide look in Daniel Daniel answered in the presence of the king because the King was looking for an interpretation and a lot of people you know they get they get you know desperate you know sometimes just things aren't going right you know I just need to hear something I'm going to need to talk to somebody you know they want to go talk to a psychic or they want to go talk to a psychologist they want to you know I need a psychologist I hear people you know people talking you know I need to go see a psychologist people that call themselves Christians talk to a psychologist you need to talk to God In Prayer on your hand and your knees until God answers you because you either believe God or you don't believe God because that's the way of the Heathen that's the way of putting your your your trust now if you need somebody to talk to that's good there's nothing wrong with having somebody to talk to but thinking that they're going to give you the answer unless it's another brother or sister that's anointed by the Holy Ghost that's why we Fellowship that's why we come together in fellowship and when we come together with pure hearts and and our and our Spirits are clean and and there's nothing between us you know there's there's no unbelief between us and you I I love that kind of Fellowship you get into that kind of Fellowship it takes a while to get you know moving into that realm but once the love of God just overtakes you and you're you're in Fellowship around his word he starts to speak left right and Center he starts to unveil himself pride gets out of the way all those things at the end of that Fellowship all you want to do is you want to hug them you want to I love you brother praise God I so appreci why because the spirit and the anointing of God came into the midst of that that's that's real uh you know therapy you want good therapy you need to get into Fellowship around the word of God you need to love one another you need to spend time together people are people are getting caught up with this too much I see it all over the place I see it in listen we're human being means we can't help it we get tired we get miserable sometimes but listen you need to you need to pay attention you need to pay attention to your attitude and your and your expressions and the way you carry yourself and the way you greet one another you know that you can give somebody a look oh yeah oh yeah man I can tell you that guy he can give a look to somebody and spoil their whole day I know a lot of people that can do that right in this message they look at you in a certain way and you got it right you know that that don't come near me don't even look at me I don't want nothing to do with you what is that it's not God that's not God they're they're anointed and they're being controlled by an A different kind of a spirit because the spirit of God will humble you will will keep you humble will allow you to to to to see the the the reality is God real to you or not if God is a reality to you then then the the love of God should be pouring out of your heart you want to see situations change in people's lives and people's attitudes project the love of God into those situations project the love of God greet them love them show them that you appreciate them show them by by by shaking their hands and saying Hey Brother Hey sister I appreciate you I appreciate what you're doing thank you for this thank you for that it's important amen it's a part of the body of Christ moving and and and having the supernatural work within it you want to send the holy ghost out of the church you just get one person that starts to put an evil eye here and there and and starts to you know show attitude towards situations and everything else it'll grieve the Holy Ghost right out of the fellowship yet one person that's got a spirit of gossip on them starts talking about this brother or that sister or this or that God knows knows all about those things God is very very very aware of those kinds of situations and he hates it because it brings disc scord into the body of Christ and it's and it just puts his Spirit on the sideline so he's either going to take that Spirit out of you or he's going to take you out one or the other it's as simple as that we're not going to tolerate that in this house we want the spirit of God to move and to deliver and to set free and people to die out to their own ideas and their own attitudes and their own interpretations oh no God showed me this this is my interpretation of it this is the way it should have been this is how it should have been that shouldn't have gone that way pardon me what happened to the leadership of the Holy Ghost in the church that's what put the Holy Spirit out of every church denominations and everything else because they didn't want the word of God to have the preeminence and and just have his way have his way praise God Daniel answered in the presence of the king and said the secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men the astrologers The Magicians the soothsayers show unto the king but there is a God oh Hallelujah in heaven glory to God that revealeth Secrets oh let me tell you God can God can uh uh you know he can scour out the things that that he needs to get out of your life he can he can reveal and pull out those those things that he doesn't want you to be a part of remember Ephesians chapter 4 that God sent into the church all these gifts for what purpose to perfect we are in the perfecting time you wonder why is everything so on me why is everything picking on me why is this why why why why why is this happening why is that happening I'm being rejected over here I'm being rejected over there this one here doesn't want to talk to me this one here doesn't want to look to me this one here what is it it's constant distraction and the enemy is trying to defeat you and put you down and knock you down so that you can become absolutely useless in the body of Christ but there's a God that can go when you surrender when you say Lord I don't want it anymore I want to move on I want I want I want to I want to see the supernatural in my life I want to see Deliverance in my life I want to see the financial blessings that are mine I people want Financial blessings but then they don't want the word to control their Finance you got to let the Holy Spirit control your Finance if you want God to bless it the Lord It's the Lord that causeth the rich and the poor the Lord the Lord make it them all rich and poor we put our trust in the Lord amen there's one that can reveal the secrets and maketh known to the King Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days praise God well we just got started we go to the next slide how many knows that tomorrow is April the 8th and we're going to have a solar eclipse great what does it mean what's it saying how's it going to affect you how are you looking at it what do you see when you look you'll have to wait till Wednesday night to hear what I got let the musicians come praise God because if I go any further now there's just it just starts really unwinding praise God so we thank God for the signs and the Wonders that are taking place but we thank God more for the voice that's in the sign we thank God that God has given us the spirit of Revelation to recognize what is really going on what God is really wanting to do praise God that he's given us a a a an attribute that can discern and only believe God's word and take every sign every Wonder everything that that that comes into our lives and take it right back to the word and know that God will give us the proper answer praise God God bless you

are surrendered themselves to be used by the Lord so we trust the Lord that our presentation for you will be a blessing okay God bless you so much amen I know turn it up knife I know there be a messiah one who saved the world from sin he has promised to be born from my lineage the son of David will be seated on my Throne a so forever and ever he is the one by the by the people of God to bring Deliverance I also know that to save his people from sin he must die I've seen him in vision he would be rejected mocked we pierce his hand and feet casting Allah for His Garment but not his bones will be broken his body will not be corrupted and his soul will not be left in hell this is the promise of my God as shown to me in a vision I'm King David a man after God's heart I know the Messiah will be he will be my son and my Lord [Applause] [Music] if you knew him like I know him you would know the look of shame in the eyes of your friends families and neighbors they despised me for being a child before marrying Joseph but they didn't no I was visited by an Angel I surrendered my body as a vessel for the Holy Ghost I was chosen for all woman before me or after me to Bear the body that Christ came to live in he was exceptional he showed the wisdom of the ages even as a young child he astonished the elders in the temple they were shocked that such a young boy could have such knowledge such wisdom but they didn't know he wasn't just any boy I am Mary the steward of Jesus's Earthly body and if you knew him like I know him you would know that Jesus was born to die the Son of God if you knew him like I know him you would know that Jesus this with no respect or persons everyone despised me because I collected taxes on behalf of the Romans but not Jesus he was different he said two words follow me those two simple words changed my life I immediately stopped tax collecting and follow Jesus everywhere he went I witnessed him speak in way that confuse the religious leaders but the children and common people they all understood him I grew to love his words so much that I had to write them down and how else would others learn him about him uh Healing The Sick feeding the multitudes breathing the the Deads I am Matthew I was B born from the line of David and King David I became a writer of the New Testament because I know Jesus and if you knew him like I know him you would know Jesus is a miracle [Applause] worker if you knew him like I know him you would know that Jesus can make you feel brand new I was despised full of Shame regret and guilt everyone condemned me instead I was that kind of woman they knew nothing about my past they didn't know how I became in possession of my precious alabaster box of perfume but Jesus he knew and I realized I need to give him my most precious possession I heard Jesus was diing with Simon and the Pharisee and I took my perfume with me and in that moment I saw him I suddenly dropped at his feet in tears I couldn't help myself I just kept crying and kissing his feet I was thinking about my life all the things I did wrong I cried so much that Jesus's feet were being washed clean with my tears I didn't have anything to dry them with so I used my hair I dried them kissed them and poured the precious Alabaster perfume on his feet oh the smell filled the entire house then the Pharisees criticized him so he told me they told him a parable of what it truly means to be forgiven and loved after that he looked at me and my sins were forgiven and he said I should go in peace I am Mary and I received redemption and forgiveness because I know Jesus and if you knew him like I know him you know that Jesus can forgive all your [Applause] sins if you knew him like I know him you would know that Jesus is the most compassionate friend I didn't understand at first just how important he was when we welcomed him into our home I was busy attending to our guests as I always do preparing the meal and serving everyone it took some time before I noticed that Mary wasn't helping at all she was with Jesus and the others I didn't want to interrupt anything but when I asked Jesus if he didn't mind that Mary left me to do all of the work he looked at me with such kindness in his eyes and explained that Mary had chosen the better thing it was then I realized how privileged we were that the Son of God was a guest in our home I had to treasure his every word later it was his word that gave me hope after our brother Lazarus died I knew the promise of Resurrection but what a blessing to see that the promise fulfilled not in the latter day but this day my brother was dead and in a tomb for 4 days but Jesus the resurrection and the life called Lazarus from the dead I am Martha I saw the glory of God because I know Jesus and if you knew him like I know him you would know that Jesus is the resurrection and the [Applause] life if you knew him like I know him you would know what it means to be truly loved Jesus love is unlike any other I've ever known being the son of Zeb I felt loved by my father and my brother James but in jesus' presence I felt an etal love it gave me the strength beyond my understanding the strength to see Jesus transfiguring before my eyes his his body completely transformed shining full of light I saw Moses I saw Elijah it's the love of Jesus that made me strong strong enough to stand and watch him be crucified I didn't know I didn't understand why he let the soldiers nail him to the Cross why didn't he fight back I am drun the Beloved disciple of Jesus and if you knew him like I know him you would know that Jesus became the Lamb of God because he loves the [Applause] world if you knew him like I know him you would recognized he was the most remarkable person I had seen him in my dream so I warned my husband have nothing to do with the death of this innocent man I told him but he didn't listen he was afraid of a rebellion he wanted to satisfy the bloodthirsty masses they demanded the crucifixion of Jesus my husband traded the life of a murderer for the life of an innocent man after his crucifixion we saw and heard of phenomenal things happening they were nothing short of Supernatural first the sun went down in the middle of the day there was Darkness over the Earth from the 6th until the 9th hour we could hardly believe it 3 hours without sunlight later I heard at the same time the curtain on the Tabernacle was turned from top to bottom I know that Jews would not desecrate their Tabernacle in this way the curtain was over 30 ft High and 4 in thick it took over 300 priests to manage it no person could tear the curtain that size from top to bottom it had to be Supernatural I am Claudia pulia the wife of pontis pilot I Witness the supernatural because I met Jesus and if you knew him like I know him you would know that Jesus had Supernatural power he willingly gave his life when he was led to golgatha if you knew him like I know him you would have been amazed at the miracle of the fish we spent all night fishing without a single catch and then we met him in the morning the he told us to cast our Nets this the the boat was filled with fish so much that it began to sink this one encounter with him made all the difference how could I deny him why did I deny him I saw all his miracles right before my eyes I walked on water because of him and yet I denied him I never imagined I'd live to see this it was glorious if others weren't there I might have thought I was dreaming the most unimaginable moment of my life watching my Lord Ascend into heaven I am Peter I became a fisher of men because I know Jesus and if you knew him like I know him you'd know that Jesus is [Applause] Alive if you knew him like I know him you would know that it's worth leaving everything to to follow Jesus he saw me in the fields on his way to gal and he said follow me so I did something came alive in me I couldn't stop telling others about him at first nefo didn't believe me when I told him I found the Messiah but later he came and saw for himself he became a follower of Jesus after Jesus went up to heaven I continued telling others about him I traveled to mirror preaching the word then the angel of the Lord told me to go back towards Jerusalem there I met an Ethiopian he was reading a book of Isaiah but he told me he didn't understand who the pro prophet spoke about I helped that ethopian man understand the scripture he wanted he wanted to be bti immediately as he passed by the river I am Phillip my body was translated because I know Jesus and if you knew him like I know him you will know that Jesus the Messiah used my voice voice and hands and feet to spread the gospel [Applause] if you knew him like I know him you would know that Jesus lives in me like most people I heard about God but didn't think much of him I mean there's so many religions and different churches how do you know which is correct then a friend invited me to her birthday party I knew she was a Christian but I didn't mind I thought it was a a little strange when she'd always pray before eating driving or most things she did she always said she was praying for me I figured if she wants to pray all the time that's fine with me so I went to the party and after a while they were talking about the Bible discussing the one true God and Jesus's baptism someone mentioned that at creation when God made man he spoke to himself because man was inside him at that moment moment I felt like I was struck by lightning I understood that the creator of the universe created me to worship him this is my purpose to live for Jesus because he paid the price for my sin that I can have eternal life now I must die to myself I surrender all my desires to him I also get to tell my friends that there is joy peace hope and insurance in the middle of this dark world I am a believer I am a reflection of God because I know Jesus and if you knew him like I know him you would know that Jesus has the power to transform [Applause] you do you know him like I know him now we do have one more portion of our presentation for you it'll be a
