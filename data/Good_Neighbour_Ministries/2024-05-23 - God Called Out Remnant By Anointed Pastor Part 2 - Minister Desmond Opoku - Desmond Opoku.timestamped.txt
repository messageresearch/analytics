[29:19] People ye have scattered my flock and
[29:23] driving them away and have not visited
[29:28] them behold I will visit upon you the
[29:33] evil of your doings said the Lord and I
[29:37] will gather the remnant of the flock out
[29:40] of the countries where I have driven
[29:43] them and will bring them again to their
[29:47] FES and they shall be fruitful and
[29:51] increase and I will set up Shepherds
[29:54] over them who shall feed them and they
[29:58] they shall fear no more nor be dismayed
[30:01] neither shall they be lacked said the
[30:06] Lord behold the days cometh said the
[30:11] Lord that I will raise unto David A
[30:16] righteous branch and a king shall reign
[30:20] and prosper and shall execute judgment
[30:24] and Justice in the earth in this these
[30:28] days Judah shall be saved and Israel
[30:31] shall dwell safely and this is the
[30:36] name whereby he shall be called the Lord

[30:44] come said the Lord that they shall no
[30:48] more say the Lord leaveth which brought
[30:51] up the children of Israel out of the
[30:54] land of Egypt but the Lord leaveth who
[30:58] which brought up and which led the seed

[31:05] country and from all countries whether I
[31:08] have driven them and they shall dwell in
[31:12] their own land Hallelujah and let's go

[31:21] rise for Christ it didn't say Christ
[31:26] Christ
[31:29] that's more
[31:32] plural and false
[31:35] prophets and shall show great signs and
[31:39] wonders in so much that if it were

[31:51] hallelujah
[31:53] amen thank you
[31:55] Lord I think we last time I I'm going to
[31:59] recap a little bit about what I said
[32:01] last two weeks
[32:06] ago we talk about how these false false
[32:12] pastors has driven away the
[32:15] children the
[32:20] children and uh thank God for his rich
[32:24] and mercy he set up his
[32:28] Shepherd we talk about he shed up his
[32:32] Shepherd and feed them wherever they
[32:34] were or they are around the world bring
[32:40] them back to the house of the
[32:42] Lord house of the Lord and feed them and
[32:45] let them Prosper so that they will not
[32:48] fear no more and their their their their
[32:52] their
[32:53] spiritual food will be increased God
[32:56] himself promised them that he will bring
[32:59] them back because they fed food where
[33:03] they they get contamination and they
[33:05] couldn't eat so they get sick so they
[33:07] have to run away to for for so they run
[33:11] have to run away for shelter you know
[33:17] Hallelujah at the same
[33:19] time uh we talk about how are we going
[33:23] to bring them back through through
[33:25] emissions
[33:29] through you are giving to missions as
[33:33] brother Braham Sam always said if you
[33:36] can't
[33:38] go if you can't go send
[33:42] somebody how you going to send somebody
[33:45] through your sacrifice giving cuz this
[33:49] church here we talk about this church
[33:51] here the foundation of this church here
[33:55] is always focusing the
[34:00] evangelism we started for a long time we
[34:03] did so many evangelism in Bruce Dale
[34:07] when we were there hamon uh hamon
[34:11] downtown sharing food baptizing
[34:15] people this church is always focusing to
[34:18] bring people and mature them in the
[34:22] presence of God
[34:24] hallelujah that's our goal
[34:29] amen blessed be the name of Lord and
[34:31] this gospel is
[34:33] trueu and it was given and Vindicated by
[34:38] the prophet that we believe Mara
[34:42] 45am so today we are going to find out
[34:47] how these two
[34:49] Spirits are very
[34:52] close that it can deceive some people
[34:56] but it were not
[35:00] possible but God has ordained a special
[35:05] people
[35:06] like nobody can touch that he said they
[35:09] have them he has them in the palm of his
[35:13] son no matter what Satan does he cannot
[35:17] deceive
[35:20] them God going to give you a
[35:24] discernment that can you can discern the
[35:27] for one and the true
[35:30] one you know when we read the B when we
[35:32] read the word of
[35:35] God he said
[35:38] false
[35:43] Christ and we know he didn't say false
[35:46] Jesus Christ he said false Christ and
[35:51] Christ is the
[35:55] anointing Christ is the anointing
[35:58] anting and the Lord is one Jesus
[36:04] Christ
[36:06] hallelujah amen if you remember I'm
[36:10] going to give you a example about
[36:12] Moses the prophet of God whom God
[36:16] predestinated to

[37:46] that because you are part of that
[37:49] message in that
[37:52] age can

[38:26] why we always talk about PA why we
[38:29] always read about Matthew why we always
[38:32] read about John why you read about
[38:39] Luke is part
[38:42] because this Prophet is the Entre
[38:46] messenger what he did in the Bible how
[38:49] God used him never a man on this Earth
[38:53] here that God ever used that Willam
[38:56] Abraham if you you don't understand

[39:21] the
[39:22] messenger to us revelation 10:7
[39:28] so this brother came and fulfilled
[39:34] that that part of the word of God if it
[39:38] was the days where the Bible will be
[39:40] written his name would be
[39:42] there we don't worship him we quote him
[39:47] the same way as we quote the
[39:49] Bible
[39:51] Hallelujah no but we don't worship man
[39:54] somebody will why you always talk about
[39:57] Will
[39:59] let me tell you if has not
[40:02] been this message my life will not be
[40:06] like
[40:07] this
[40:09] because I used to go to
[40:12] church I can
[40:14] smoke I can
[40:16] drink I can go after everything what I
[40:20] need without seeing that it's not part
[40:24] of the word of God and I I I I can call
[40:28] myself a
[40:30] religious cuz I can give my tith I can
[40:33] give everything I can I can give money
[40:36] to help anybody I'm thinking that I'm
[40:39] thinking I'm doing good is and doing
[40:43] good cannot take you to
[40:46] heaven this
[40:48] message that time when I went there I
[40:51] was in those places I baptized in the
[40:54] name of the father and the Son and the
[40:56] Holy Ghost it couldn't help me by the
[40:59] time when God open my understanding and
[41:01] the pastor baptized me immersed me in
[41:04] the water my I I became a different
[41:08] person I never be the same I can I can
[41:12] hear the voice of God when something
[41:15] happen to me or anything when I pray
[41:19] brothers and sisters and those who are
[41:22] watching on the line I can give a
[41:25] testimony right here from all night
[41:28] since God took hold of me that I myself
[41:33] will tell you I have nothing to do with
[41:36] that by is by the grace of God because I
[41:40] cannot dream a dream by myself
[41:46] Hallelujah the reason why I'm I'm saying
[41:49] this sometime when we mention brother
[41:51] Braham people think we mention his name
[41:53] too much and we worship him we don't
[41:55] worship brother Braham we we worship who
[41:58] the Lord Jesus
[42:00] Christ he is only one God he died on the
[42:04] cross and save my soul without him I
[42:09] cannot do nothing and the Bible says
[42:12] everything to be a Christian everything
[42:14] that you do do it in the name of the
[42:17] Lord Jesus Christ he is only one true
[42:22] God
[42:24] hallelujah I mention brother BR name
[42:26] because because he was the prophet the
[42:29] last message that that has to be on the
[42:32] earth before the Rapture is William
[42:36] Maron Braham and God has destinated this
[42:39] Prophet for a special
[42:42] people and nobody cannot give it to you
[42:46] you have to take it by the Holy Ghost
[42:51] himself I couldn't take it I came in and
[42:55] I went out
[42:58] was it my time when the time
[43:01] come it's like death
