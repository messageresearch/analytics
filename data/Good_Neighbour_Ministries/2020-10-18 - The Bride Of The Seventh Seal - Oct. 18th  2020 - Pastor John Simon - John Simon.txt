be seated we are so happy to be here in the house of the Lord uh first of all I want to uh thank God for all these baptisms that took place during the uh pandemic so far I have about seven uh different certificates here I'm going to ask the deacons put them in the envelopes and give them to the people or give them with the envelop right praise the Lord and young people and they are coming to realization by the Holy Spirit himself upon their lives God Speak speaking to them and they're making their own decisions I want to thank the Lord for [Music] [Applause] that and that's what we are talking about and trying to teach the people it's not by the the works we do now it's in gratitude to God it's in praise and thanks to God he chose you if you're a Believer already you're not going to pray harder fast harder work harder for him to choose you now or for him to decide that I love him or I love her no you were chosen before the foundation of the world and you are now living out and acting out what he expected you to do even all your mistakes your stumblings all your failings the Lord knows the ways that are ordained for one of his seed do you understand that the seed of God can do the same thing as much as the people in the world they can murder they can kill they can lie they can steal but when his time comes and he decides to start talking talking to you then that brings a transformation why do you think the Apostle Paul cried out so much and said oh to think I am the chief of Sinners I kill Christians not one two many many he killed and God turned around and said yeah but I I choose you to be an apostle so don't let the devil come to your mind with all kinds of guilts and condemnation and this and that and the other you were living in Perfection before the foundations of the world sin was able to make him play all of these uh mind games and tricks with your mind and with your heart and get you all messed up and mixed up and wondering if and what and when and why and then but but then when God lifts that Veil and you realize that hey despite all of this that that going on around this is just like feathers on a bird it's just like fluff one you know and and it will all pass away as we surrender ourselves to him praise the Lord I further want you to know that um we have $10,000 that was is just um donated to the Church of the Living God uh for for more of the agap tablets to go out on the mission field and a half of it also to go towards Mission and missionary work and here uh we have $10,000 that was given by a company here Dynasty fantasy sor I don't know where my mind went there I'm not thinking of John Crawford so don't fantasy uh garden centers so I want to acknowledge it publicly brother could you give this to brother Mike praise the Lord so that he can see that I'm not keeping it praise the Lord amen so we thank the Lord and may God bless um the directors uh of course brother Danny here in the back and brother Frank belissimo those some of you don't know him but he's a wonderful uh brother and uh they're Partners in that business and the Lord placed it on their heart to do that so we give God the praise the honor and the glory amen hallelujah may the Lord bless you real good uh I I'm very happy to be here and to uh share with you the word of the Lord amen uh in my Bible I want to turn to Revelation chapter 8 verse one and shall we stand as we read the word of God God is just doing something marvelous and wonderful CU now it's not by works you know not by works it's the holy spirit it's the Holy Spirit spoke to brother Joshua and Sister Charlotte and now they're in New Brunswick and and and doing missionary work there I didn't ask them I didn't even think about that well all of a sudden God speak to them so he's taking the whole message into another realm where he is in preeminence three brothers are heading into Jamaica led by the Holy Spirit to go preach the word of God uh uh to the people up there in the Hills mountains wherever it's uh um the Africans that were enslaved and taken to Jamaica but they escaped and when they escaped they went into those mountains and the British and the French French and the Spanish was never able to conquer them or get them back and they remained there and they got their independence like they're on reserves like and uh so um they still have a lot of those African traditions and things and their tongues have African names so um these brothers have a burden on their heart and they're going there to preach the word of God to them and it just happens by the way that they bump into um a man that is of that tribe in Toronto and he said what you're going up there I'm coming with you so that work of man this is the work of God this is the holy spirit now showing to the people I only have pastors a Shepherds but I am above everything I'm in preeminence I'm in control so we place it all in his hands and to him be all the glory amen praise the Lord let us read out of the word of God and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of a half an hour praise the Lord praise God may God bless his word gracious father we thank you for the the reading of the word now we pray that you will bless your people as we worship you and fellowship around the word together in Jesus name amen please be seated now my my emphasis will not be on the half an hour assignments which is what you know a lot of the preaching on the 7 seal is about the half an hour silence and what that means and pertains but I want to uh talk about this uh I'm still series of the end time bride identified now she's being identified as the seventh seal or if you want to say as a part of the seventh seal so I want to uh entitled this the seventh sealed bride the seventh seal bride praise the Lord so we thank the Lord for her now we ended our last talk of how that the fullness of the word uh the prophet brother Bram said did not come and uh and was not available in the years of his preparation right I explained to you that Jesus life had the same three things the first the first year was the year of his preparing for his fullness of his ministry and the next was the year of popularity and after that once he got into his third pull of the word and he started to bring it saying I and my father are one when he start to say yes Moses said I say right and so on your father Abraham longed to see my day and he saw it and he was glad said what is he talking about is this man older than Abraham is they don't know they were looking at the Ancient of Days but he was in a body and he he began to talk to them because now he was in his third pull and he was bringing the word of God in such a way to identify himself now I won't touch on all that but brother Brenham said you know Jesus talked about all those seals but the seventh seal he said uh you know he he couldn't say anything he don't know that was left out and uh he says but that seventh seal started in the Garden of Eden and it came right on down through now if you want to study your Bible and look at you will see Abraham saw it you're going to see different ones that saw it God allowed them to see it not know it but see that there is a seven seal praise the Lord so there's people through the Bible that actually saw there was a seventh seal Daniel this one that one come on down even Paul praise the Lord so we give the Lord Jesus glory for that so years of preparation years of popularity and then the last year of persecution same thing with brother bradam when he preached son I identify this generation for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ because by then he was being persecuted right and if you watch his life and line it up with those things you will see is exactly the same thing has happened and repeated again praise the Lord so the bride uh you know did not uh really catch a whole of the word our attention was not really galvanized until he started talking about those seals and the seals began to open up and we know that from those seals something or somebody came out of those seals and that caught her attention right it caught the bride's attention uh right at that point in time and I talked about the doing God's service without doing his will uh page uh 32 how that they how that the cloud which here appeared in Arizona over the mountains and that people recognize that that was not natural matter of fact if you can find a copy of a Life Magazine um from way back it's actually in Life Magazine where they're saying mysterious cloud we don't know what it is moisture is not supposed to be up there I I'm not sure whether I have that magazine somewhere but um moisture is not supposed 30 miles up you're not supposed to have moisture Cloud nothing like that is supposed to be out there uh as such so it remains to this day a mystery to them but a prophet came down and he told the people he says don't tell them they think it's some kind of a this or that he said but it's them seven angels that met me on the mountain opened up them seals and they were on their way back Hallelujah and they took the picture when they're on their way back glory to God and it came out and those Brothers had it he said no he says turn it the other way and turn it the right way and it came out the face of Christ the face of Jesus Christ within the those clouds Hallelujah now it's the second coming it's the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ it was Jesus Christ coming again but we failed to recognize that coming that now he was coming as the son of man right praise the Lord hallelujah I know you're hearing me but then it will become clearer as we go along now remember remember the wise men in the Bible we coming back now to Christmas time it's not Christmas yet but the wise men in the Bible they were in the East and they saw a star in the heavens and by seeing the star this Supernatural event the heavens of course decare the glory of God the heaven speaks and declares the glory of God go and when the wise men looked and saw the star in the heavens they recognized that that star those Stars which is three actually you know it wasn't one star it was uh uh Jupiter Saturn Mars all came together and one right it's one God not three he one anyway so there it is that when they saw that Supernatural event in in the heavens there were wise men they were separate from each other in different countries Prophet said one from India one from Persia one from somewhere else but anyway all of them recognize that star in the heavens is the sign that Messiah is on earth now for a star will arise in Jesse praise God when the Messiah comes so by seeing the star in the heavens they haven't seen the Messiah yet but they recognize Messiah is on earth now glory to God hallelujah oh my so do you understand we see those seven angels going back we see the clouds in the heavens the mysterious clouds to them but praise God to the true wise men of the this hour we recognize that was a sign fire is on the Earth right now because the heavens spoke before man even had a chance to actually recognize and realize that the son of man was on Earth amen hallelujah of course we know that the word which is is God was revealing himself now a quoting from a message called Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever paragraph 111 to 112 and I'm saying it like this so you can and anyone else anywhere else can study it I can just preach if I want it to and not even mention that but I want you to be able to uh follow it there praise God you will find that there and also in in a message called the Messiah paragraph 26 here Jesus is mentioning about these wise men so that's not something that I just made up uh he's talk he's saying it there right in the word that they recognize Messiah was on the earth now when they saw that Heavenly event that was the sign to let you know Christ had come down that was a sign to let you know he had come back before the Rapture out of here and that he was on the earth praise God now in the Messiah a brief quote in the Messiah there he said and do you realize that the Messiah in this hour is really Messiah ex because he he the Messiah is now represented by his Messiah ex and his Messiah s his church his bride they are his Representatives so who really is the Messiah of the hour the son of man praise God it's Jesus Christ it's not somebody else even though we are involved in it it's not somebody else page 20 of the unveiling of God he says you realize what's happening it's Jehovah now unveiling God hallelujah now you know what he's talking about you were part of him you're part of the Masterpiece we got lost we come down but we are still a part of God and he identifies you that you're a part of God hallelujah but you were veiled by sin by Fog by clouds by doubt everything else but now Jehovah has come to pull the veil off the Masterpiece take the veil off of God that the world would recognize him in his people and know that he is the same yesterday today and forever in them praise God hallelujah hallelujah the spirit of God is doing what is taking a veil off the word so that our eyes and our hearts and Minds can see him Hallelujah because you would have just been reading the Bible like anybody else and the verses are the same verses the scripture same scripture but all of a sudden Jehovah begins to take the veil off of God God taking the veil off God what are you talking about it's that part of him that was the mystery Through the Ages he's now taking a Veil off of it he's letting people see his bride just before she go away he's starting to identify her to the world you can say what you like about her you can say oh H she has a mole on her on her um face on the left side of her face his eyes that mole is her beauty that MO is part of her beauty you think it's a flaw but to him it's her beauty praise God God whatever you oh you did this you did that you did the other I saw you when you you made this mistake you made that mistake he is not looking at your mistakes they're under the blood Hallelujah and if you're a real seed son or daughter of God you'll repent of it so he's not even worrying about that because you he knows you're going to come to him and repent of him and get those things cleared out praise God hallelujah glory to God hallelujah thank God that he is the one that holds the key I thank God the key is not in the hand of of a pope or or or super superintendent because uh when I was a boy and I'm saying it so that you can know how long ago that was I remember they had the Bibles in the Catholic Church big thick Bibles and they had a brass or gold has around it with a padlock you could not read out of the Bible nobody and they made it so mysterious that when the priest went up there and he opened that that lock and then he things it back he pulls it back and then he might read a small piece of it out of it all the rest is in Latin but you see that's just the devil copying the word for the Bible says he said I hold the key I hold the key of David I open and no man shut and if I shut no man can open if I open your understanding and your wisdom they can't put you back in a box anymore because you you you're been opened up the whole thing unlocked the Bible unlocked the seals unlock the message unlocked the the truths in the word live released to you it can't be locked up anymore praise God and if I lock up your understanding you can sit there and you can hear the same things that the rest of them are hearing and it will just be religious it will be good you'll enjoy it but the the the unwritten word the the the fullness of the word is not going to come right true to you as it should praise the name of the Lord hallelujah praise God think of it Jehovah taken the veil of God to show you the difference between right and wrong between truth and error who is the seed and who is not a seed that's not for us to judge but God's holy spirit will start causing you to be able to recognize hallelujah amen the six seals we know revealed Christ walking up and down amongst the candlesticks during the church ages but it also reveals to us the trail of the serpent the mystery of iniquity how iniquity intertwined itself down through the ages in the church moved amongst the people all of the while and so we see Jesus Christ and his actions and we also see Satan and his works now made plain in front of us praise God but through the opening of the seventh seal what does that do because the six seals it uh explained it revealed and it made known to us the good and the evil truth and error down Through the Ages right to this time okay now the seventh seal does not talk about those things if you read it if you checked it out it it seems like nothing was said it it it's a mystery and it is for it is the mystery that was hid Through the Ages it was hid in his mind Through the Ages the the the the Jews didn't know that God was going to have a bride he was the Jews didn't know he was going to have a church the the Jews didn't know nothing about that nobody knew what was going to happen that he was going to call out from among the Gentiles a people for his name I'm saying to you the bride is the mystery that was hid that Paul spoke of if the princes of this world knew they would have never crucify the Lord the glory amen why his wife was in his side and it turned around and pierced him in the same side and they brought about her manifestation because they pierced him in the side and there the wife was able to be expressed upon the Earth praise God so if the princes of this world knew they would have not crucified the Lord Of Glory Hallelujah and we would have just remained in him we would have remained in his mind whatever but they expressed it by what they were doing so through the opening of the seventh seal Christ reveals himself to his bride Hallelujah and he reveals to his bride as his bride not only to his bride but reveals to her that she must recognize that she is a part of this Hallelujah so the bride herself is the seven seal for she is the son of man the son of man but he's deliberately revealing himself in the bride form you understand it's still Christ he is the seventh seal but Christ now in this age has come back not to reveal himself as Jesus Christ back there one man but a many membered bride body amen revealing himself not in virgin born flesh but in redeemed flesh by the blood of the lamb and by the power of the holy spirit amen praise God how will Satan suspect something like that flawed people people with mistakes stumbling and failing and everything else like that he will never think that out of can any good thing come out of Nazareth in other words praise the Lord hallelujah he he he wouldn't expect that but God has done it amen and I am a testimony of it I am an example of it I believe you are an example of it and that's why we are gathered here today by the grace of God h Hallelujah GL the son of man revealing himself in the bright form sometimes we say these things we don't even know fully what we're saying amen but think about it we have been given the truth that we might know him the truth and we might recognize the activities of Satan the activities of error how can we ever mistake it you can't oh praise God let me just move on the seal book page 473 you write some of these things down go study it read it yourself I'm not going to sit here and and be quoting all those things you can go do that yourself so he said the book is holding the mystery Hallelujah the book is holding the mystery of whose names are on that Lamb's Book of Life glory to God so the book is on F holding the mystery praise God so we see that the names of the elect which you know brother brandham said that's why John wept because the book was holding the names of those elect in there praise God and and and nobody was allowed to open it up and see those names and recognize who was in there and who was not in there and a lot of presuming went on and and stuff like that and Satan could do a lot of a lot of presuming and dressing up of people and educating of people to deceive the whole world but God had the mystery the bride hid in there that seven seal bride was hidden as a mystery in the word of the Living God hallelujah so we couldn't know and we didn't know that our names were re written in the book until that seventh season seal broke praise the Lord and to this day when the seven seal broke many many people preach it say it and know it that the seventh seal is broken but broken yes but is it revealed to you you see it's one thing to know is broken and you can write books you can make tapes you can preach about it seven seal broken and this and that and the other yes but is it revealed to you as an individual that you might have an individual revelation of who you are and what and who the word of God is and then in Christ is the mystery of God revealed brother Bram said if you say that this word is revealed to you and it's not manifesting out of your life then you got the wrong Revelation amen you didn't get it you thought you got it but you didn't get it amen because once you get it it will begin to manifest itself in you and through your life effortlessly you don't have to work yourself up into anything you don't have to shout him down like um uh ahab's prophets you don't have to bring him down you don't screaming up it will make you do that but you are not going to do that as to bring him on the scene you are just going to be serving and worshiping him and the spirit of God will move across you and sometimes when you shout hallelujah you didn't realize that you wanted to even shout hallelujah praise God oh glory to God Amen Hallelujah like that now I said some things there but let me en encapsulate it broken revealed and now manifested the SE by back there by the lamb that don't mean it's being revealed to you you know you talk about it and then if you say oh yeah I I know it's it's revealed to me then the revelation will become part of you amen and you will recognize that you are a part of that Revelation and it will become manifested in and through you without you having to say anything so broken revealed manifested praise the name of the Lord Jesus hallelujah amen oh my it's like impossible to know that you're in the bride without having that seventh seal revealed to you you can't know if you're in the bride and this terms sometimes are mysterious the seven seal the fullness of the word revealed to you uh open up to you and they say fullness of the word I can't I can't even explain it all I can tell you is that something happens where when you look at your Bible you start to see and read between the lines it's not education it's not study it's not hours hours of fasting and prayer and and you know people are impressed by that that man must be spiritual he prays a lot that woman must be spiritual she fasts a lot you know you may do that as God leads you but that's not what gives you it's in you and you know I was even thinking of it today whether to even come out with these notes because it's all right to have the notes but to say exactly how I want to say it that's why I have the notes but it's it's in me I I can just stand here and and just open the Bible start in one spot and start talking about this Revelation and it'll go on and on and on and on and on because it's not just something I'm making up it's something that is in me and it's part of the word and the word is the season when it's unveiling itself and it's unveiling himself not as him back there but her right now that's what the holy spirit is doing but people's eyes are still looking back there and they're looking back there and they want to have another revelation of him there but they're not seeing the the very Revel Christ revealed in his own word in his own people amen hallelujah what a day what hour and what a time for us to recognize friends that the Deep must called back to the Deep God unveiling God the husband calling out to his wife brother brenon said I'm in the mountains he says oh and I hear the the elk and hear the Wolves call calling out to their mates wherever they are oh praise God don't you understand the same thing in nature it's the same in the word of God that the Holy Spirit calling out to his bride how is she going to know how's she going to know something about it there might be 1,200 wolves shouting at the same time or 12 Elks but that wife is going to know that voice my sheep know my voice and a stranger they will not follow there no mistake about it they recognize him because his sheep knows his voice blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus Hallelujah questions and answers page 239 then God became materialized in a man called Christ Jesus Christ which was his son and this son gave his life to bring other sons and daughters that God might again become tangible working in all all in all and in that day ye shall know I am in the Father the father in me and now I'm in you praise God that's this day God tangible in Jesus Christ and now it repeats again God again makes himself tangible but now it's in the bride for it's the same God the fullness that filled him is now filling her no one person is it or the Messiah or Jesus or whatever but you are a part to make you feel smaller you're a particle amen now brother Brenham was asked this question now brother Brenham is it true that every Jew born since Christ come will be saved amen hallelujah oh my no nothing will be saved only those whose names were put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world Amen see whether they be jew or Gentile that's all the book holds the mystery and the book is only unfolding it now not each one's names Hallelujah see but the mystery of the names that were in the book for the book would say now Lil he's supposed to be saved the book doesn't say oh Harman evil or whatsoever or whoever else is to be saved no it don't say it like that it just shows or reveals the mystery it unfolds the mystery of what the thing is that we ourselves by Faith by Revelation can believe it amen that's what I'm trying to say say that's what I said the other night you understand praise the Lord the seven seal breaks to you and what happens amen it's not a mystery to you anymore it becomes a revelation it was a mystery when you didn't know but it becomes a revelation when you're going to beiz wait a minute I'm seeing myself I'm I'm in the mirror I'm in the word hallelujah I'm a part of this I'm a part of this whatever it is I'm a part of it and uh I thank God for that Hallelujah let me give you another quotation here Christ revealing his own word uh I believe page 28 now the same thing is this if you are a son or daughter of God we were in God at the beginning Hallelujah and when Jesus became the fullness of the [Music] word then we were already in him so when he was crucified we also were crucified in him when he rose from the dead we also have already rose from the dead do you see why you can't miss the Rapture you already the prophet said it Christ he said it in the rising of the sun and a few other places he said don't you realize once you recognize once you have really caught the Revelation you are already resurrected this is just a manifestation of of your res you're you're already raised up he said don't you see your your spirit is living above sin above the world and above all that stff he said you're already raised up hallelujah praise God and the potential in other place he said of the Resurrection is already in you amen hallelujah so it's in you and it's being watered by the word of God hallelujah what kind of a faith it's going to take for you to go in Rapture brother rapture in facei hallelujah it's not one sudden all of a sudden one day you feel your chest that boom boom boom bo oh now I'm getting the Rapture in faith no it's a Rapture Revelation it's so simply said it says going to be so humble if you're not watching it'll pass right by you it'll just go right by you it w appear to be nothing much so when he wrot rose from the dead we rose with him and now since we have recognized it now we are sitting together with him in Heavenly places in Christ I wonder what Heavenly places he's talking about that's a totally different message and sermon but what a Heavenly place to live in all see this word of God swirling around your head in your mouth mind and your soul everywhere you turn the word the word the word you're not trying to put something on you're not trying to deliberately make an effort because the word is working mightily in you amen since we have recognize it we are Sons and Daughters of God we are children of God then we are the attributes of God then that means we got eternal life and that means god is the only eternal life there is then we were in him from the beginning and when Jesus became all that word then we were part of him then amen he says there you are when that is in there when that is in there in you there is no devil no powers no nothing can ever move that from you for that is the tpost of your soul amen glory to God what you're tied to the word of God you're tied up you're Tangled Up With Jesus oh praise God hallelujah he's got you in his arms he got the whole world but he's got you in his arms amen praise the name of the Lord Jesus Hallelujah think about it brothers and sisters what I'm saying here today praise the Lord I'm just a little bit slower because I want you to convey the truth of the word of God to you amen since we have recognized it have you recognized it have you recognized it praise the Lord you don't have to identify yourself to me but you know in your heart whether you recognize it within your heart hallelujah oh my see you see what he's saying if you can't are don't recognize you don't have a revelation that you were in God before the beginning how can you find your position in the bride how can you find your position in him if you don't see that seal book page 473 the book holds the mystery and by faith of course we believe it the bride gets a revelation of that mystery because it's not a mystery to her because she belied what she sees and she sees herself within the word of God she sees she begins to realize she was the mystery that was hidden from the devil or he would have destroyed her like he did the first Eve he would have deceived her like he did the first Eve but she was hid from him and it's when we come from behind the veil of the word amen that's when the devil is is able to attack her praise the Lord hallelujah so the bride is going to get a revelation of the word and by getting the revelation of the word that is going to call her name because whatever the word is preached whatever it says something is coming out of that word unseen unheard but you can he said the one whom you feel within your heart now you feel him but one day he'll become personalized before you praise the Lord hallelujah I can only tell my wife I love you but how could I really express love how could she really know all the emotions all the thoughts all the how could she know I can't convey all of that all I all I can do is use outside actions things I will do or say or you can do or say that will show that amen but that's Paul goes around and says but yes but then when we get on the other side then shall we know as we are known but here we are just expressing the best we can of what is in our hearts and within our minds and within our lives praise the name of the Lord Jesus hallelujah amen so we thank God that this revelation of this mystery reveals itself to her and by revealing itself to her it identifies her and she turns around and identifies herself oh it's talking about me oh it's talking about me so she's just identified herself it identify her she identifies herself she sees herself back in the fullness of the word of God Amen now talking about the spirit of Elijah doing God of service without doing his will page 34 talking about the spirit of Elijah of brother brandham said of course is nothing less than the spirit of Christ it's the spirit of Christ but uh you see a lot of people when you say that they don't understand they still got the trinitarian thoughts and so their minds operate that way oh he's talking about Elijah oh he's talking about Christ so it's two people they don't understand that the spirit of Elijah is just like a a facet of a diamond it's just a facet off of his personality expressed in a man called Elijah it's not a different person's different Spirit it was just used for a moment of time and um he uses that quality more than once matter of fact the Bible says he's going to use it at least five times so it's Jesus Christ who has actually come back in this day to identify his own own bride remember Eleazar brought Rebecca to Isaac Hallelujah but he didn't have to turn and say Isaac this is her or he didn't have to tell Rebecca uh Rebecca that's Isaac the Bible said from the time she arrived and she looked and see him and he raised up from where he was among those wheat and look and you see her they start running to one another you see have you ever seen any of those movies when the two stars are running to but that actually is what happened in the Bible Rebecca start running to him and he start running to her the Bible says and he took her to his father's house and he's going to do the same thing today take the bride to his father's house come and go with me to my father's house where there is joy joy peace peace peace within the father's praise the name of the Living God hallelujah oh praise God hallelujah amen yes sir so he he the word has come to identify his own bride and at the same time his own bride identifies him because she sees that's the real word that's the real husband that's the word that I'm seeing over there praise God hallelujah amen because she hears and sees not just the written word but she she she she she doesn't even go just up to the spoken word written word spoken word and then she's gone into the third P Unwritten word she's hearing the logo speaking back to her she's hearing the pillar of fire talk into her soul amen praise God now remember when that's Spirit of Elijah came he said I am not him but he is standing amongst you now in other words John knew that if he was on the earth and uh he also among not the wise men but now John knew that if he was supposed to identify the Messiah and baptized the Messiah he has to be on the earth now it's just that I I don't know him yet uh and so he got to be on the earth now so the fact that that Elijah spirit and John was on the Earth was a sign that Messiah was on the earth when that Spirit comes back whether the man names William Branham or his Nam this or whatever name it is it happens to be William Marian Branham in our age then Messiah had to be on the Earth for him to be able to identify Christ amen for him to be able to reveal him in his own word amen oh praise God so we understand friends why if you go back and think of all these things Christ is the mystery of God being revealed hallelujah amen you glory to God now quoting now uh he's standing amongst you I am not worthy to loosen his shoes when he makes himself known I can't do it and today I say he is standing amongst us he is here in the person of the Holy Ghost manifesting himself more and more doing what coming to his church and making himself known being because him and the bride him and the bride bride and the groom will be the same making himself known see oh my didn't he say one day you'll see the one that you f in your heart and you see his identification will become personalized before you then you and he are one what now you are united by the word you're United by the opening the revelation of the word oh my see then you are united with the word let me pick up here amen and the Word was in the beginning the word that was there with him in the beginning will go back to the beginning which is in God which is in the word she'll go right back to be living in that atmosphere in the word of God praise the Lord hallelujah and that's the day that you will know that I am in the Father the father in me I in you and you in me brother brandham shouts Hallelujah we are here I'm so glad to see him personifying himself Among Us and see what he promised for the word not somebody else's emotions not somebody else's singing not somebody else's jumping not some else dancing oh but by his word he is making himself known to me glory to God hallelujah praise the Lord if you want to Rejoice Rejoice Rejoice that's wonderful not what somebody else doing but what he's revealing to me that's what's exciting me that's what's moving within my heart and within my soul look I appreciate everything God is doing in this day and hour and I'm going to praise the Lord I'm going to start winding this down now I thought I'd be again another week I thought I'd be finished here but um I have to go on is that okay I don't mean today but I have to go on with this um message that the lord gave excuse me gave me here thank God Hallelujah praise God I'm going to end it no no no use might going on because it keeps unfolding and unfolding and unfolding and we thank God that that bride the seventh seal bride amen praise God down Through the Ages the princes of this world God couldn't let them know couldn't let them know because they would destroy the church they will eat her up alive but thank God he hid his faithful few and waited for the time when he would make himself know but praise the Lord aren't you GL glad that you could
