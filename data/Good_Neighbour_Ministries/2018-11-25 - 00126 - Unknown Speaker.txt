TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we communicate because part of this walk with God you know God is giving you more responsibility as you draw closer to them as you become freer because you're actually becoming free we please people on earth because we are we are being set free by the things that we speak we are being released from this world that's what we did this straight into tribulation we cannot change what is going to come to pass in this world it's not going to get better it's gonna get better because we are the church that leaves before this Great Tribulation strikes the earth and so with that character that God is giving us to walk with Him as we get closer and closer to that time and to that season he is putting more and work from our character and how ability to to submit ourselves to the Word of God and took and to be and we get to be free and to have the ability to receive is his spirit and his anointing in a simple way of this ministry of the third poll and what it actually is producing what it's actually supernaturally doing and placing coloring positioning the sons and daughters of God if you become responsible this is more you know the responsible and you get promoted to a certain position they're being given more responsibility and you've got a lot more conscious your authority and so God is but sure of the bride into the third pole get nervous this supernatural inspiration that UBC's she listen you can't work you are given the ability to receive it and then they're given the ability to seat to the seat being fulfilled you're given prophetic ability and vision to see the word being fulfilled around and you will see witness certain events and they'll be able to place to place in the situation you'll see what this happened so that this could come to pass Mimi you see it's all God working of this planet bringing the sons and daughters of God together in their position their portion of the word he does anything for you the world you want to hide the core department you wanna you want to submit the live for him that's how he does it and he does and he says greater is He that is in you it's me that's in you if I can think I got so many faults here we brother branham you know the brother brother was was out there hunting and the Holy Spirit he said all of a sudden he was there pray that the Holy Spirit concluded between those trees and and he felt that anointing that sweet anointing and then he heard a voice saying if you say say would you come to us see he was walking with God but even even because I believe that was taught to impress this was it's all about progression in your pocket cup and you're gonna come into certain stages at your walk what God has never become more personal with you he's gonna speak to you he's going to intercede and intervene into situations if you give them the opportunity sometimes we get so busy with our own interpretation that we miss pop and we visited intercede intervening and dealing with the situations in their lives but you see that's what this and in parentheses and such a place of God that God came to him and was speaking and yet he was he was wondering is this is that humor his IQ that you said you have to be or something you said you wanted it you speak it work and that's what he spoke the squirrels and he says that that from that day on things changed in his life because he had witnessed and ever had such a personal encounter with God that woman in his life and it goes on and you know in here arena where he talks about here and in perfect faith in 1963 says know what the same God comes to you and is pleased to love you please to honor your work hey what your decision is see like think about this this kind of a walk you know about this kind of a walk where all of a sudden pleased with your decision and and he says what was Joshua's decision stand still son and it stood there I'm sure what was Moses [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and I know it is the truth save and see the Creator bring a living creature into existence right in the presence of your own eyes shake your head and look around and see them bring another one just exactly like he's talking about those burrows that experience because you said so and turn over here and say there'll be another one there that's the truth Oh where should we there's perfect a nomination just speak the word never saw us he just said this Richard wasn't speaking but you say it'll be there like to God at His Word and it was there meaning that's right that's just this powerful and friend as her pastor that's just as powerful as it was when Joshua stopped the Sun because the Sun was already there the others was moving and he stopped the movement but this he brought something there that wasn't there he created and this is the hour where God is creating God is positioning God is giving the Yeti God is giving you supernatural ability to change these vital bodies these mortal bodies that are going to be changed it's going to come through the preaching of the word of God it's going to come through you recognizing the season of the word what it is that's good he said I am so proud to be acquainted with God that God that can take this dust of the earth someday without anything and talking back to life again [Music] you said she believed it I'll do it and then listen you know I'm talking about this progression we don't write it down and this walk with God and I want you to see how it was happening in delight in Brother president because study the Prophet and you wanna you wanna you wanna listen to those tapes you wanna feel those tapes you know why do you wanna be on those tapes so that you can experience the same God that he was experiencing so that you can hear the things that he's saying about the dog that wants with you see this is what I said to you this is what I meant what I said I will be with you I will not forsake you I'll be with you until the end he says have courage be not be not dismayed be not discouraged I'll be with you but he told Joshua he's a single table probably one of those tapes your feet on to the right breezes because we've got that same walk you've got that same experience we've got that same desire and you're hearing the same God speaking through that top and with that problem and that's what's excitement and here he says in the message you know $1 will be the closing poll he says the message be not afraid as I believe that this is what we need to recognize that this day we need to realize that Jesus Christ wants to encourage you he wants to possess him he wants to use you he wants to change you he wants to so incarnate your life he wants you to just be soul filled and overflowing with this I just I just want more it is such a wonderful blessing to know the Lord Jesus as our sake and to know him as our human and looking for him to count as our king to set up the kingdom on earth that we shall rule and reign with him for a thousand years forever and now beaten tonight is rather pushing for the service of healing and praying to the sick we want to say I'd love to make this statement the reason I haven't I haven't had any human loves this week there's been something that's been on my heart as I told you the last time here there was a new ministry there was a new ministry coming he says I spoke with some of the Predators today and was telling them about what's happened just just some of the Brethren today was telling them about what's happened just remember that the first time I was here you remember the Lord had told me something was going to happen change in the ministry it happened said another loves blood to happen and it happened everything that God was telling brother Branham was speaking they had all the promises that he made they just kept coming to pass me and he was the sons and daughters the pride of the Pricer [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] but even when you're angry see not projected which mean say Lord let the love of God take control over this feeling let the love of God take control over this this situation and this is holding this fabulous partner or or in this healing situation with the sickness Allah protects us it'll just relate so much to you that God just flows because God is God if you've got a revelation of God's love you know that it's not filled up maybe that doesn't please God it's not popping up maybe that's the kind of love that the musicians come that's the kind of apocalypse the kind of love that changes you and changes your character when people see they can feel they can feel that you actually care that trust me love that's you're happy that you're actually happy to see them you're actually happy to see them they can tell because you know you can get to them we've heard it sometimes Christians they can get soul into battles and they become more miserable than happening and it starts to become a part of their character word word you know you don't even want to be around because you can feel the misery I'll beg God to have people like that in this church don't worry doc but you know you know you see it out there and I'm just talking about that same kind of spirit it can get out of anybody if we focus too much time we want to show that we are the happiest people on earth I'm talking about Jesus Loves Me jesus loves you jesus loves you it's missus this is a walking table the Living God blessed be is wonderful god bless you let's continue to walk with Him just the culture [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
