TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good Sunday morning friends bless you neighbors welcome to believers from around the world and locally let us come into his house with Thanksgiving and into his courts with praise welcome to another broadcast sponsored by good neighbor ministries of Burlington Ontario I'm Pastor John Steinman let us pray our gracious Heavenly Father sincerely we pray from the bottom of our hearts for our prime minister for our premiere for the best of health and vigorous life we pray Lord for all frontline workers we pray for the safety of our neighbors and friends we pray for her loved ones and believers everywhere Oh God send forth thy light and truth from this broadcast may you shine your light of your word and your glorious gospel everywhere and your servant as we preach the word and take all the glory honor and praise for we ask it in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ well friends last week I spoke on this subject of the quickening spirit the spirit quickening the word to the age and now I'd like to read from our King James Version of the Bible I'm reading first Corinthians chapter 15 verse 45 and so it is written the first man Adam was made a living soul the last Adam was made a quickening spirit let us give glory to God that this marvelous quickening spirit of God is here with us this morning now before I begin to advance from where we left off last week I'd like to clarify the meaning of the word quicken what does this word quicken mean from Google it says to quicken means to make faster to speed up to accelerate something so quick for the means to stimulate as or to excite as in stimulating interest you know exciting interest to quicken means to restore life for example the body of Christ that laid in the tomb for three days was quittin by the Holy Spirit which means he was restored back to life now there's a ancient or arc-8 meaning to the word quittin but it has some application to what we are talking about and one of those meanings is to cause a fire to burn to quicken is the cause a fire to burn also to quicken means ah signs of life signs of life for example of signs of movement of a fetus and the mother can now become conscious that there is life life is coming forth signs of life now with that understanding last Sunday in part two of this series on the spirit Quinton's the word I quoted from a poem written by K L Brown called the little plant and here it is in the heart of a seed buried deep so deep a tiny plant lay fast asleep wakes at the sunshine and creeks to the light wakes at the voice of the rain drops bright the lip plant herd and rose up to see what they wonderful outside world would be that's a plan from KL Brown now I talked about how we are offsprings of the almighty Acts chapter 17 verses 26 to 29 for Paul there in the accent says for you are his offspring you are his children in other words you are his attributes you are his seat genes and uh now we understand I spoke of how we were in him from before the foundation of the world and uh just as a man would have his children in him until he is able to see his generation that were in him and then he can see his generation made manifest in front of him then he can talk to them and they can talk with him and they can have fellowship one with the other now if you're a true child of God then you really are an eternal being that has trapped in a body of time or a time body in one sense you're a soul imprisoned imprisoned here but thanks be to God the Word of God as it went down into the prison and set the prisoners free that same word of God is here in this last day this last age to sip every captive on every prisoner free by the opening of the word the opening of the prison doors and using the key of revelation upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell will not prevail against it by the opening of the Gateway you are able to come out into the unfailing reality of the Living God to recognize who you are and that you are an eternal being and you know in a movie some years ago there was a character in there called ET but that's just a movie you and I are the real et's eternal beings come from the presence of Almighty God trapped in a flesh body serving his purpose here on earth until our return back to glory yes ET it's going home time I'm here to tell you ET it's rapture time it's time for us to turn our hearts towards heaven and home and towards our heavenly father with joy within our hearts knowing that we on our way back to the Godhead we are way back going back into the presence of the Almighty God now with the opening of the seven seals we have witnessed the coming of the Lord in the form of his resurrected restored and revealed word which is now preparing our hearts and prepared the way for his corporal coming the rapture is at hand the time is at hand the Lord's rapturing power is here amongst us to prepare us for the event we are many by His grace in the process of the rapture which leads up to the event of the rapture and I'm glad I'm ending this stream of time this stream of Revelation this stream of the Holy Spirit I'm thankful today that we are caught up and being carried away by the light of the word and the power of the Holy Spirit I hear the midnight cry behold the bridegroom cometh wake up seeds of God wherever you are wake up the chains of your on your mind upon your

calling you now to rise up to another level of understanding he's calling you into another dimension of seeing him revealed in his own word yes sir he's doing that so you may be in a rupturing condition oh thanks be to God and I'm here to say if the light of God was planted in you before the foundation of the world then the preaching of the water of this word that you are hearing here today

for the Holy Spirit thank God those of you of course who are acquainted with this message of the hour we know and you know what was sent by the seventh church a messenger if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again sir changes page 172 if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again I believe he's raising it up again I believe have come into life I believe jeans are waking up I believe that attributes of God are recognizing their position in Christ I believe it's happening right now and it's happening around the world the Spirit of the Living God it's harvest time it's harvest time the Savior is calling the Spirit of God is calling the here of shepherds voice made God's Holy Spirit deep into your soul and call out to you yes yes the Spirit of God is here to quicken the word in you for a resurrection by revelation the angel of God is here to trouble the waters to stir up the word into your soul amen the angel of God is here to bring you to a place of decision back to the spool of Siloam and many he pleased himself and stir up that piece of the world whether your mom taught you one verse of the Bible when you were young may the Holy Spirit of God take ahold of that and grab ahold of your heart and lead you to himself by his glorious word did this day in this hour thanks be to God for evermore it was said in the token the Spirit of God identifies the gene as his own and then raises it up I believe he's here today to identify his own where he came to seek and to save those that were lost and he is seeking he is seeking the lost is kindly entreating Oh turn turn for white will you die come to Christ come to the perfect word come into a perfect understanding and a perfect revelation of who he is and who you are Oh clearly God sent his rain census rain on the just and upon the unjust yes sir and it indentifies his see yes by the holy spirit the reign of God oh the mighty cleansing reins of God searches and finds his own and brings them to a consciousness of God and the work that God is doing within their soul the Spirit is here to quicken the word and to make it live again he witnessed the word because he wants us to be his witnesses now I realize I'm not speaking only that he's quitting our understanding today words written in the Bible or in the message but the Spirit of God is here to quicken you and I who are living revelations of that word for we were a part of that word from before the foundation of the world and preach through the predestinated mystery of his will place into human bodies that we were born into for a purpose that we might manifest him we have a name to declare we have a mission to to perform and we have a word from him that we must make manifest we have a character that we must declare that the people can see God in Christ Christ in the church and that Kingdom coming listen be his holy and precious name yes sir now we realize that the Spirit which was the word to make it live and the word is a conductor for the Holy Spirit when the Spirit follows the Word of God and causes the Word of God live thanks Peter God the great holy spirit the white horse rider is here raining on the word into our hearts on the white horse of the revelation of the word Rivet revelation 19:11 2:16 and he came riding on the white horns and upon his time he was written king of kings lord of lords and his name was called the Word of God that conquering all conquering word King is writing into art spirits are so today we have the opportunity for him to be the mighty Conqueror and to have the preeminence in our lives and that we can surrender all and live for him forgetting the past that is behind and press towards a glorious wonderful future of a genuine Christian life walking in the light of the world amen oh of course we are the span friends that though they the word is a conductor for the Holy Spirit but plastic cannot conduct the Holy Spirit or me a conductor for the Holy Spirit if you're just a plastic Christian if you're a one that is a dramatic Christian that lives by oh and Christian is supposed to act this way and you perfect your act your your Christian act until it becomes nothing but a Christian from a life you're nothing but a plastic Christian you see God can't flow through that God can't use that as a conductor Oh God can't flow through rubber you know rubber is not a conductor it's an insulator so here you find that you've got these rubber Christians in the church they're out the church there in the front door of the back door today they're safe tomorrow their loss today there are real sanctified tomorrow they're back slidden somewhere out there like that God doesn't look for rubber Christians maybe not the rubber we're supposed to be conductors for the glory of God then you'll have most Christians that are like a block of wood right there wooden in church they'll just sit there and they'll grim and they'll stare at that preacher there to feel embarrassed even to say Amen there I feel embarrassed to say glory to God they'll be ashamed to raise their hands to their Creator and to their makeup Oh think about those wooden men those wooden women wouldn't Christians just told when they're to rise told when they're to sit told when they can say Amen or a certain uh you know canned phrase instead of fresh food from the presence of Almighty God oh we will have to be wooden Christians you can't be a conductor for the Holy Spirit you can't be a conductor for acts 1:8 acts 2:4 the power of God to flow through your life and to anoint you and use you for his glory and honor we are to be as we all know in natural life copper is a marvelous conductor of electricity we want to be like a copper wire that's filled with the energy and power and Dunamis of the Holy Spirit of Almighty God vibrating and living through your entire being animating and causing you to be a life under the anointing of the Holy Spirit I'm not talking about just an emotion and about the genuine 100 proof baptism of the holy spirit filling your soul for the glory divine Oh God take your Lord you'll save the best wine for last and here's the best wine for this hour may the ways of God in new white skins baptized you are going to use you fill you with his presence which is being to live through you all thanks be to his wonderful name yes sir him so he's calling every one of us to be conductors of his word so that God's Word must flow through us learn his name and so the great Holy Spirit is here to rescue by his word and to cause you to become prisoners of Jesus Christ that you might be go out working hard for the Lord in other words to be on the large chain gang to be prisoners of Jesus Christ chained to him shackled to him by the Holy Ghost that you might only do his will for sons and daughters of God are led by the Spirit of Almighty God may the Spirit of God take the whole of you until we are all handcuffed by the Holy Ghost and walking in his Divine Will and his plan and his purpose Oh conductors of his word that we might be able to say flow through me Holy Spirit flow through me flow through me Holy Spirit flow through me Oh God as I lift my hands to worship may the spirit of Almighty God flow right through my soul to quicken us to empower us to flow through us that we might become conductors of his love conductors of his life conductors as Mary was in the days when she received the Word of God how did she receive it she received it by the work spoken word of an angel who stood before her and said you shall bear a son his name shall be called Jesus and thanks be to God that God sent a seventh angel church each messenger in this last day to stand before us and to speak his word into our soul that there might be comforta a new birth a new creation and new life glory to God forevermore and here we are to become conductors and carriers of the Word of God who are willing to bear the shame and reproach for this message and for his name to be reproach for his name oh yes they call you one God people they call you serpent seed people they call you all kinds of names amen holy rollers Pentecostal even people of this message don't recognize the difference by an anointed message child of God to a modern-day Pentecostal contrary to God's Word they can't even discern the Lord's body and if you knew you're an animated anointed I'm moving on the inspiration of nineteen and leadership the Holy Spirit and the gifts of God are rich and pure and holy and working within the body they can recognize God's Spirit God help us in this hour thanks be to God we are here to bear the reproach for this word that we are telling right now even so he's calling you and I to become messengers of His grace and of his mercy to quicken to quicken quicken also means to cause a fire to burn oh thank god the mechanics of the word has been restored and a lot of believers are happy with the mechanics of the word they are happy with all the quotations they're happy with knowing all the wonderful things said spoken by the great messenger that came they're very happy with that the word has been restored on part of his spiritual body also being restored because the written word and spoken word that was restored was there was just a representation of the believers or of the spiritual bodies of the elect for this age and for this hour and the Word of God is calling out in this day and in this hour that's a spirit Gosport he crawls to his own o blessed be his name to quicken us and cause us for the fires of God come pertinent in our soul yes sir she the bright body is ready she's ready for the final fall let the fire fall let me anointing come let the rapture come I'm ready you are ready let's get ready that's being ready let's be prepared what fire I'm talking about the failure of the Holy Ghost I'm talking about far as it was on the day of Pentecost I'm talking about the dynamics coming up on the mechanics I'm talking about the pillar of fire there love ghosts of God coming up on the written word the Rhema of God the Lumos causes the written Rhema word to come wave to shine out the McNown itself to reveal God's secrets yes sir - cause that word to live again written spoken and living word to live again and to produce another book of Acts another book of actions moved by the Holy Spirit anointed by God God living moving and having his entire being in his people and he making himself manifest as their God their creat creator their Redeemer their Savior they're coming king blessed be his name thank you Lord hallelujah yes sir God's Spirit is here with us today now we want to use the illustration as has already been utilized by God's prophet that you can have a perfectly brand-new car a beautiful Porsche a wonderful Cadillac whatever the car of your heart brand-new but if that color has no gas in it you may keep polishing that car all day long all day long at Mariette admiring the church admiringly admiring your life even that you're a good man you're a good woman here you know you live for you're a church man or a church woman here yeah you can you may even say you're a message believer I follow the word that's that's okay but all you have is a polished a car and a good exterior where your actions and your acts your dramatizations are so less that none can see or discern what lurks our lives behind that veil oh but if there is no gasoline in the car the car will not move you can turn the key as much as you want the car will move but then if you went to God's filling station for inspiration and the Holy Ghost stretch your soul opens up the word and the word that you have been accumulating through the day that years like the Apostles did while they were with Jesus three and a half years they act with him they slept with him to fish with him and they knew him the word but they have no revelation of who he was who he really was they this sense things but here this brother sister the Word of God was a being stored up in your storehouse of your soul that word was dead back into you and you may have been following it for years and years following him but that still will not make your vehicle move for your vehicle to move you first have to be able to have a key electronic or a natural one that's placed in there and when that kiss turned our pressed something happens you must have have yes if they're already and when the key which is what I'm trying to turn by the Holy Spirit that Kia's turn then something happens within the combustion chamber of the color the combustion chamber of the human heart all of a sudden a spark a revelation a supernatural inspiration from the presence of God strikes that soul and the spark in the combustion chamber off of that spark Club strikes that gas in there and it just produces power it produces high-octane power takes you from the first and second pull and puts you under the inspiration of the mighty angel inspiration of the third Pole to move in him and live in him and have your being in him so that you may be a conductor for the word of God and that his word may come to pass in and through your life oh then you'll become an oddball then you become strange to people then you may be called crazy you may be called a different you can't be explained why because it's the Word of God making the self known in you as an individual Oh blessed be the name of our Living God yes sir so God just quit ins and us and uses us as conductors that we might relay convey that we might conduct his word witnesses you shall become witnesses after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you when he dwells in you and he flows through you oh thanks be to God he lives in me I pray God he lives in you I pray God that all you have is not just a baptism of the Holy Ghost one of we're baptized means that tips all comes from the word baptizo which means to dip him and under and to be brought back out so a baptism means you went in and then you will under yes you went under but to come back out but we're not talking about just a baptism of the Holy Ghost justification main wait for certification certification make way for the baptism of the holy spirit and now the holy the baptism Holy Spirit makes way for the Holy Ghost himself to end well the Emmanuel that again he may be God with us that he might become the son of man being revealed again in this church body the bright form making himself known to his people by living in them walking in them moving in them being their God in them the word that was made flesh back there now if you flesh that has been redeemed is going back to becoming word from the presence of Almighty God so how does the spirit quicken the word so that we are so that the word can become the vehicle to to make known his truth to make known his presence and his perfect stature his character his children walking like him acting like him moving like him under because it's in their nature they're a part of him and they're moving in the holy spirit of the Living God hallelujah now he does it by revelation Paul the Apostle did say that by revelation he made known to me the mystery Ephesians chapter 3 verse 3 by revelation Paul with all of his understanding Paul Peter turned to Paul and said Paul you're saying such deep things that even I have to think about them I I oh I have to really get to understand some of the things you're saying Paul but Paul said that's not me he revealed to me the mystery he had to make it known and no man with his own wisdom of understanding him stand before God's bride but God has to send his servants with his word for this hour and by revelation he made known to me the mystery or in other words he revealed to me his hidden secrets he revealed to me previously hidden things and made them plain yes sir Oh what is a mystery a mystery is a hidden secret something that was hidden no made plain but in which a supernatural element still remains I believe that supernatural element is the element of the Holy Spirit's ability to reveal the word and to propagate the word by revelation the fertilizer soul enter pollinate you with the presence of God and the power of the Holy Spirit that you might be saying be able to say I am my father are one I come from God and I'm going back to God thanks be to God for that kind of oneness that we are experiencing here today may the great holy spirit of Almighty God take these few words and anoint your heart and your soul to recognize what you are hearing who you are where you come from live a spring here today as we turn our thoughts back to God as we come to the end of this broadcast for today our gracious father we have preached the Word of God we pray that the Bliss of
