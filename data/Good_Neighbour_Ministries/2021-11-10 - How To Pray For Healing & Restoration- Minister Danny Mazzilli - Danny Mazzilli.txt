things around your life you're going to feel better you're going to feel more complete you're gonna have that that connection with god that you know that you know like we've all been walking many many years with the lord but then there's times where he just calls you to say okay hey i want you to focus now for the next 40 days i want to spend some extra special time with you and this is um what he's doing right now i i i know it i'm experiencing it i'm enjoying it and i know that if you are participating then you are definitely benefiting from it in a tremendous way praise god god bless you all tonight we're going to be looking at how to pray for healing and restoration you know um we're we're going through these series every service you will note that you know if you've got the prayer workbook you'll notice that the prayers um the daily prayers everything is just flowing you know it's just flowing together and um you're you're just going to see how it just keeps building and and the scripture becomes more real to you as you progress through it and so we're going to look tonight at how to pray for healing and restoration before we do that let's just go to the lord in prayer amen father we are so grateful tonight lord to be in your presence once again lord because we know that's what makes everything special is that when you promised through your word that where two or three would gather you would be right there in the midst and we find it so privileged tonight lord to know that you are here that you will speak to our hearts you will meet our needs father you know the things that are on our hearts you know how to discern the needs of your people like nobody else and lord we just submit ourselves to you now for service to hear to speak and to recognize and to be able to act upon your word father grant it tonight lord heal restore do a great work in jesus name amen god bless you saints you may be uh well let's read the first scripture go to slide number one the scripture here is from second chronicles chapter 7 verse 14 a very familiar scripture and in this scripture we're going to be looking at the scripture a little deeper tonight and you're going to see things that i'm sure you didn't see before that are going to really strengthen you and and and encourage you and kind of uh vindicate where you are in your walk with the lord in your prayer life amen it says here let's read the scripture if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then i will hear from heaven and i will forgive their sins and i will heal their land amen you may be seated praise god you know we can look in the world right now and we can see that the world is definitely in need of healing the world is definitely in need of restoration the world is in a condition where you know it's you know even though you look at it economically you might see that you know the stock markets at all-time highs you got you know housing markets at all time highs in the history of the world you've got uh certain economic uh signs that are like showing such prosperity like never before but yet we're in a time and a season where people are so under mental oppression that um division in the world separation in the world wars and rumors of wars and situations worldwide that are taking place all around us so we know that that something is not quite right amen praise god and so we can look at it from that perspective we can see that the world condition and everything else needs healing needs restoration but what about you what about me what about our walks with the lord you know what about our our condition because you know everything around your world starts with your condition and your relationship with the lord it is so important to understand that you know as we move through this 40 days of prayer we don't want to miss the aspect of what you have need of because remember i'm not saying here this is all about you but it is important for you to recognize your place your position in the body of jesus christ and where you have need and where you need healing where you need restoration because you as a human being as long as you're in this human realm you're going to need healing as you grow older you know here in this dimension in this human vessel you're going to feel aches and pains you're going to need to go see the doctor once in a while there's going to be situations that are going to rise up and you're going to wonder oh my goodness am i even going to make it so you know you need healing you need restoration in your own vessel and it's important for you to recognize that over these next 40 days that you know as you're praying focus in on the things that you need healing for and you know restoration you might need a restoration in your in your marriage you might need restoration in your finance you might need restoration in your relationships with with your boss at work or or or your or your teacher at school whatever it might be you know these are things that you can focus in on and and seek the lord in these areas and and see and experience change in your life that's what this is all about saints i hope you're looking for change i hope you're looking for your life to to move on to progress in the lord and to mature and grow up in the lord amen praise god and so um healing is something that is is um so important when you're walking with the lord and when you're walking with one another a lot of times there's division there's things that you need to get fixed between you and someone else i don't know but you know you know where you need restoration where you need healing amen praise god so when we look at this scripture we see here if my people now my people are god's people are sons and daughters of god we've got to recognize who it is that he's talking to he's talking about people who are called by my name you know a lot of people don't want to even be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ you go and tell them hey you know like if you're going to identify yourself with christ then you know he's your husband he's the bridegroom and you the church are the wife and if you you know call yourself a christian and i come to you and i say hey you need to be baptized in water in the name of the lord jesus christ and you turn around and say yeah well i was baptized i said well how were you baptized well i was baptized i don't know i i got baptized as a baby i said oh well that's that's another thing you need to be baptized as an adult you need to understand what you're doing you need to be able to repent and and turn away from your from your life of sin and then when the baptism takes place you're buried and you're resurrected and you become one with christ and you take his name because now you are identified as his church a christian somebody that's filled with his spirit so you got to be called by his name if you are his people and listen he says and will humble themselves and pray and seek my face we're gonna look a little deeper and turn from their wicked ways you know a lot of people think right away you know wicked ways you know like well i'm not wicked you know i'm not you know you know wickedness is is murder and wickedness is is uh um you know uh stealing from the poor and and wickedness is you know all these things of like you know that people identify wickedness with but we're gonna come to see a little bit deeper really what wickedness is wicked ways then i will hear from heaven and i will forgive your sin and heal your land now let's look at the next scripture here matthew 12 46 to 50 while jesus was teaching the crowd his mother and brothers waited nearby to speak to him someone told jesus your family wants to talk to you jesus says who is my family see a lot of people will instantly you know um think that that you know you've got to be uh family you know but jesus made it very clear who his family was his family are those that follow him hear his word recognize his word and obey his word next slide matthew 12 46 then pointing to his followers he said these people are my family anybody who obeys my father in heaven and does his will is my brother my sister and my mother so we come to realize that it's even though jesus had family on earth his family are the sons and daughters of god that are born again by the spirit of god if my people who are called by my name amen and so next slide if anyone is ashamed of me and my words and my words in this unfaithful in and immoral generation i will be ashamed of him when i return in glory with all my angels so the very first thing is to recognize that jesus christ is your lord and that he is your savior and that he is your redeemer and that you need salvation amen praise god without knowing him you cannot know true healing true restoration and true identification with jesus christ next slide so the first thing that we need to admit is that you're not in control you were an attribute of god from before the foundations of the world and god released you into this dimension to fulfill his word your life is no longer your life your life is his life now you've been redeemed by the word of god and when you came to recognize who you were that you were actually a son or a daughter of god you came to realize that there was something inside of you that's taken control of you it's called god's attribute you see we need to identify the difference between man and god human and the spirit of god you are not controlled by this human realm you are controlled by the spirit of god that's been placed in you from before the foundations of the world to fulfill this word amen praise god and so what we're going to be looking at is next slide if my people will humble themselves so this is the first thing we want to look at you know when you think about humility you think about humility and you think it's something that that that um you know uh i can do no it's not something that you can do it's something that you are it's something that you are and we're going to look at some things that identify humility in the scripture because humbling yourself is not something that you do it's something that um that that that god does through an experience with christ through a walk with god as a human walking with god and so uh i don't know what you need restored in your life but whatever it is you're gonna know after hearing some of these things here tonight how you can approach god in the right way humility god is god and i am not the first condition for healing and restoration in your life if my people will humble themselves humility is the first step to healing now i don't approach god arrogantly i don't approach god disrespectfully i don't come to god and demand things that's not humility okay i don't come to god that way did you know that in the scriptures never are you ever commanded to pray for humility so you don't even have to pray for it it's not something that you pray for god please humble me if you pray in that way you're going to be getting more more trials than you've ever had in your life that's not the way to approach it you don't want to ask him to do that it's humiliating you are never to pray god humble me i want you to think about these things because this really struck me why because humility is a choice humility is a choice you know what the opposite of humility is pride pride is the opposite of humility i can do this and i can do that and if i do this and if i pray more and if i pray louder than everybody else then god's going to hear me no that's pride that's not humility instead praying it says humble yourself it's something you do and it's over and over it's you can read this over and over in the scriptures humble yourself humble yourself it says it over and over again in the new testament humility is a choice it's something that you choose in your mind to to not let pride take control of your life we're going to look at some of the things so if that's the first condition for something to be to be restored in my life something to be healed in my life i want to know three things what is humility what does it look like how do i develop it and how do i show god my humility because he says right in the scripture if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves so the first thing we need to recognize is or try to identify is is humility and so we're gonna we're gonna take a little bit of inventory in ourselves and and see what it is that it you know like what really shows the characters of humility first of all we need to be able to confess our sin the moment that you realize it a lot of people you know like they're walking oh i've been walking with god for 25 years and you know what i can't make any mistakes and you know even when you make them you just you know like you get you get so christian you get so christian that you've got christian pride that you're afraid that if you make a mistake you can't confess it we've got to check our attitude we got to check our attitude look at look at what brother branham says here he says here look at the serf seraphician woman when she was told by jesus it's not right for me to take the children's bread and feed you dogs what would you have said if he said that to you join the next church but not her she knew who she was talking to she said lord that's right you're so right in that but the dogs is willing to eat the scraps under the master's table that got him that was it that's what he's waiting for you to do humble yourself into such a place no matter how god sends it to you if you're healed instantly if you're healed by degrees if if you're if you're put off for like abraham was 25 years waiting for the promise but instead of getting weak he got stronger all the time giving praise to god just so that you know that god promised it and you accept it for yourself it's not to come to pass just remember now as i go on re on record in these tapes i say this with all my heart that if any persons will take the right mental attitude towards any divine promise that god has made it'll bring it to pass what's he talking about humility recognizing that when you make a mistake you're willing to just repent you're willing to confess it you're willing to move on you know oh because i'm this or because i'm that even at work wherever whatever you do true humility is not looking so much itself all the time it's looking at others and how others can be benefited how others can be affected around you humility is forgiving quickly being able to quickly forgive someone you know when something happens and you know you know like things happen you know right away you know most people they want to point out when somebody makes a mistake they want to point it out instead of just you know forgiving them for that mistake and being able to move on that's that's true humility not carrying grudge you know grudges that's prideful humility is forgiving quickly you never hold on to a grudge you got to let go you confess your sin and and you move on amen humble people are forgiving people they are number three you are treated unfairly when you're treated unfairly be quiet you know we're doing 40 days of prayer and and uh you know these are things here that you might think okay well you know what are we looking at all these simple things for because this is all part of really breaking certain habits in our lives and and having real change take place in our lives when you're when you're treated unfairly be quiet and patient and don't retaliate that's real humility that's when you're more like christ you know you look at christ when when he stood before pilate pilate turned and says don't you know who i am don't you know that i can i have the power to to crucify you or set you free if you're a true son or daughter of god and somebody comes and tries to absurd power and authority and and demand over your life or or get hard with you or whatever you know who's really in control don't you remember the first thing we need to recognize is we're not in control he's in control when we allow him to do what he said he was going to do in our lives all we got to do is walk with him the bible says that when they stood him before the governor pilate and others it says he spake not a word unto them i am most like christ when i absorb the attacks you are most like christ when you absorb the attacks that come to you in life and they are going to come but you don't allow them to make you something that you're not number four when you look for ways to serve others that shows humility when you look for ways to serve others when you look for ways to to do things that are going to help others instead of expecting to be served serve when you accept criticism and correction graciously that shows god humility in you when you don't fight to get the best seat or the best table or the best parking spot that's humility you know i i just believe god that when i go into a parking lot there's a spot waiting for me i mean that's just that that's just simple so i don't have to look you know and say oh there it is oh that car's i got to get there before him it's not necessary you need to walk with god knowing who's in control these are simple truths but you know when i was looking at all of this i say my god it's the truth we really need to take inventory of these areas in our lives amen that's true intentionally being friends befriending people who have no status or who can't help you or who are overlooked by society that's humility you know walking down the street be friendly show yourself friendly don't be afraid of anybody you know that you're walking with god you don't you don't need to fear you know it you can you can treat anybody with love and respect it shows a person that has character and they're truly humble not because they're trying to be humble that's not humility when you try to be humble that's pride think about it humility is being respectful to the authorities in your life there's authorities in our lives we need to be respectful to those authorities in our lives even the bad ones sometimes we got a bad boss you know somebody that that's just plain nasty always pride showing pride all the time you just need to just step back it's not easy but it's the truth humility is when you pick up trash whenever you find it i'm telling you you know you're walking like you're walking somewhere and there's a big piece of trash in front of you like it's like you know you don't have to kick it out of the way it shows somebody that has character when they can pick up that piece of trash and throw it in the garbage these are simple things but just think about it just think about it humility is when you leave a public restroom cleaner than when you found it you ever do that it's okay to do it you know sometimes you go in there and there's paper all over the floor and man i i i just do it automatic i i just do it automatic i just grab another towel and i'll pick up the other towels and i'll throw them in the garbage and i'll leave i'm not saying that because all of i'm humble no just it's just something that i've i'm a bit of a clean freak you know sometimes i just get a little bit carried away but when i saw that i thought oh hallelujah there's a character of humility and it is true it is humbling to do things that you know you you would think oh let the cleaner do it when you admit your weaknesses in your sins to a few safe people it's okay you know to confide in some people that you trust and that you can you know that you can um let go of certain things that you're carrying you know you don't need to carry those things sometimes when you release those things with somebody that you love and confide in and you can really trust you can you know you can trust a person when you tell them something and you never hear it from anybody else you know that that person is somebody you can trust you should have somebody like that in your life that no matter what it's like you're putting it into a safe because they got a revelation of god you've got a revelation of god and you've you you realize uh that that there's an enemy out there there's an enemy that's constantly trying to bring you down and to smash you and defeat you in in any way that he possibly can you don't have to tell everybody but revealing your feelings is the beginning of healing it's something that you know because we're talking about you know healing and restoration here um this is good this is only going to be part one here tonight and it's gonna uh there's gonna be a part two and you're gonna see how this builds up and um you're gonna be really blessed as a result of it i i know for sure so i'm not good at this you know uh you can you can go to tell somebody you know like i'm kind of weak in this area you know this is something that that that i've been carrying you know i'm struggling with this is my temptation you know like um if there's you know don't be afraid to confess certain things amen that's humility another characteristic is when you always speak well of others there you know i just don't find any benefit whatsoever in speaking negative about anybody or anything other than the devil and usually it's in prayer attacking the enemy and putting him in his position that is the true characteristic of a son or a daughter of god not gossiping not talking about others in a negative way that shows that you're you're trying to make yourself better than the other always have something you know negative to say so somebody will do something and they'll do it so well but you will point out the one little negative thing that they did it shows that you've got a little bit of pride you need to overcome certain aspects of your character in those areas thinking that because you can identify the the thing that that was wrong that that makes you a little higher and a little more you know uh you got more discernment on the situation and you can and so you've got to speak it to other people to make you know other people think that oh i'm so spiritual or i'm sold this or that or i've got no no speak well of others always speak well of others there are times when people need to be corrected there are times when situations do rise up god has a provided way of dealing with those situations and we must allow god to deal with those situations in his way and when he does it it restores and it heals the person it doesn't tear down the person amen speaking well of others and then finally praying for your enemies because there's going to be people out there that you know situations out there that that you know they're after you so don't get defense full and get so caught up that you've got to you know um be so uh ready to fight up pray for the situation pray for their restoration pray for their healing pray that the lord will help them in those areas amen praise god humility is not thinking less of yourself oh i'm i'm you know i'm no good you know you hear these people oh i'm no good you know i can't do this and i can't do that that's that you know what that is that's not humility that's just pride humility is not thinking less of yourself it's thinking of yourself less humility is you're so busy focused on god and helping other people you don't even think about yourself if you go into a party and you walk in and you start thinking how do i look to everybody who am i full who am i focused on me how i you know how do i look you know how's my hair how's my suit how's my you know like like that's just all pride when i walk in who could probably use a word of encouragement today when you go into a situation that's humility humility is not thinking less of yourself i'm bad i'm no good i'm nothing i'm zero i'm zip no that's false humility humility is you're so busy focused on god and other people you just don't even think about yourself it's a hard way to live you know when you look at all these things that we've talked about you might look at it and say oh man you know like i really gotta sharpen up no you just need to break certain habits and allow change to come into your life as a character as a as a son or as a daughter of god and it's a choice it's just a choice to say you know what i'm going to humble myself by keeping my mouth shut more you know what i mean it's a choice of of not allowing certain aspects of your character that you might have bad habits of certain ways the way that you deal with situations let god show you here tonight that you can actually choose to make change in some of these areas in your life so let's look at some of these um next slide it says if i humble if i'm humble god will guide me look at let's look at some of the benefits that come with humility you know because it's important to understand why it is that he said in the scripture if my people who are called by my name shall humble themselves we're looking at this right now because if if we do there's a there's a there's a benefit to doing it and one of the benefits is that god will guide me look at the next scripture next slide it says here in in psalms 25 9 god leads the humble in the right way and teaches them his will it's beautiful isn't it simple but very beautiful are you moving the slides through oh okay well i'll just go on the next one says if i humble if i am humble god will bless me so it says in isaiah 66 verse 2 it says i will bless those who have humble and contrite hearts see these are promises right from the word of god we're looking at scripture here we're looking at you know how it is that that we're going to benefit how we're going to build the momentum over these next 40 days of really experiencing change in our lives next slide if i am humble god will give me the power to change and that's what we need you can put the heat down a bit now brother if you are humble god gives you power to change james 4 6 next slide says god opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble grace are things that you can receive that you don't even deserve but it's because you've become aware of your your your character you've become aware of your weaknesses you know because we all have them as long as we're in human vessels we're gonna have weaknesses brother anthony let's face it right i don't know anybody in here that can say oh i i'm perfect in everything you wouldn't be here there's no way you could be perfect in everything we have weaknesses we need to recognize them but we want god to help us change he's willing to give you the strength to do it i if next slide if i am humble god will relieve my stress how many people have stress everybody has stress as long as you're a mother you're a father you're a brother you're a sister you're a you're a husband you're a wife my god you know you're a worker i don't know is there anything that you can be in this life that you cannot have stress with even if you're retired and you got millions in the bank you got stress because your health starts to fail so but you know what the beautiful thing is this that if you walk with god and you have a relationship with god and you humble yourself god will relieve your stress look at the scripture next slide matthew 11 29 says take the yoke i give you and learn from me for i am gentle and humble and i will restore deep rest to your soul deep rest to your soul is relieving stress now i know that you have experienced where god relieves stress how many experienced that amen it's beautiful saints i cannot explain it nor can you explain it but when you are in service for the lord you know and you're in the midst of a very stressful situation sometimes then all of a sudden you wake up the next day and it's gone it's gone the situation that seemed so hard so stressful so you know bothersome is gone god can do that he said it right there i will restore deep rest in your soul i'm going to close it off here now because as we move along here um we're going to be looking at asking god for help because it's important to ask it's important to recognize that you know that when you get to a certain place you need to ask and you know you look back at the scripture that um that he said here if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and seek my face we're gonna be going a lot deeper into this on the part two series but just to give you an idea seeking god's face seeking him seeking the lord is something that that you know a lot of us we've done it in the past but there's a level of seeking god that you're going to discover as you continue in these 40 days of prayer that you're going to enter into a greater revelation of seeking the lord of really getting personal with god of really moving on to the next stages of what it is to really seek the lord praise god come ahead brother anthony we'll have one song amen we look forward to this sunday where brother christopher will be ministering to us this
