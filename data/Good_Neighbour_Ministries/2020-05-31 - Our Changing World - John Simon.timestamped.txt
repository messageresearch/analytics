[0:00] [Music]
[0:15] greetings friends another wonderful
[0:19] Sunday morning may the Lord bless you
[0:23] richly as we gathered together here in
[0:28] his wonderful and glorious name let us
[0:33] pray
[0:33] our gracious Heavenly Father we thank
[0:37] you for the privilege and opportunity of
[0:41] coming together on this wonderful day of
[0:48] the rising of the Sun made a great holy
[0:52] spirit bless every word and every
[0:55] thought bless the speaker bless the
[0:58] hearers in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:01] Christ we ask it amen and amen
[1:07] for the day our scripture will be found
[1:11] in the Book of Daniel chapter 2 reading
[1:16] from verse 19 then was the secret
[1:22] revealed unto Daniel in a night vision
[1:26] then Daniel blessed the God of heaven
[1:31] Daniel answered and said blessed be the
[1:35] name of God for ever and ever for wisdom
[1:40] and might are his and he changed the
[1:46] times and the seasons he removeth kings
[1:52] and setteth up kings he given wisdom
[1:55] unto the wise and knowledge to them that
[2:00] no understanding may God bless the
[2:05] reading of his marvelous and wonderful
[2:09] word friends my topic today will be our
[2:13] changing world times are certainly
[2:18] changing
[2:20] the whole world is changing we can
[2:26] clearly see this from the things that
[2:29] are occurring around us at this point in
[2:34] time you see our world is like a great
[2:38] highway with junctions turning points
[2:44] change points we may call it exit ramps
[2:49] which are symbolic of places and periods
[2:56] of change in time
[3:02] now the Scriptures that we just read the
[3:06] background Nebuchadnezzar king of
[3:09] Babylon had a dream one night and when
[3:14] he woke up in the morning he could not
[3:16] remember his dream so he called for his
[3:20] wise men called for the great
[3:24] knowledgeable men of that day asking
[3:27] them to interpret for him his dream and
[3:34] of course they said Oh King how are we
[3:37] going to interpret your dream you can't
[3:40] remember and you haven't told us what
[3:43] the dream was and being upset he said to
[3:48] them you ought to be able to tell me
[3:52] what my dream was
[3:53] break back to my memory and give me the
[3:56] interpretation if not off with your
[3:59] heads however one of his people
[4:04] remembered that there was one in the
[4:09] kingdom that had wisdom and his name was
[4:12] Daniel and so they called for Daniel
[4:15] presented the problem to Daniel and then
[4:18] you said he'll go and pray and ask his
[4:22] God to give him wisdom and understanding
[4:26] to be able to interpret the King's dream
[4:29] so Danielle went along with his come
[4:33] bunions Shadrach Meshach and Abednego
[4:35] and they prayed and sought God for the
[4:39] answer and God visited Daniels in the
[4:44] night and this is where Daniel returned
[4:48] back to the king and gave him the
[4:50] interpretation of the dream and in part
[4:56] of this interpretation he used this
[5:00] phrase that we have just read here in
[5:05] the Word of God Daniel answered and said
[5:10] blessed be the name of God for ever and
[5:14] ever for wisdom and might are his and he
[5:21] changed the times and the seasons he
[5:26] changes the times and the seasons
[5:29] according to his own will now from Adam
[5:36] to the fall Bible readers know that from
[5:41] Adam to Noah Adam to the fall it's
[5:46] called the dispensation of innocence
[5:50] when they were innocent living in
[5:53] idyllic conditions of innocence until
[6:00] the time of the fall after this we
[6:09] realize that it became the time of human
[6:16] government now we use the terms that the
[6:22] times really change and they really do
[6:28] now after the idyllic days of Adam and
[6:32] Eve enjoying their days of innocence in
[6:35] this wonderful garden that God had
[6:39] created and placed them in then came the
[6:43] sir
[6:44] which was not yet a snake he committed
[6:50] the first act of seduction and adultery
[6:53] which would Eve to produce King a wild
[6:59] uncontrollable man now when he did this
[7:07] the whole world changed the world that
[7:13] Adam and Eve lived in changed completely
[7:18] because of this wicked and evil thing
[7:23] and so from those idyllic days of the
[7:31] dispensation of innocence with Adam and
[7:34] Eve it changed to the wild wicked
[7:41] sex-crazed violent and pleasure man days
[7:46] called the days of Noah spoken of by
[7:52] none other than the Lord Jesus Christ
[7:54] himself when he said in Luke chapter 17
[8:01] which I would like to read right now
[8:06] verses 26 if you'll follow me in your
[8:09] Bibles attorney surly and as it was in
[8:16] the days of Noah so shall it be also in
[8:20] the days of the Son of Man they did eat
[8:25] they drank they married wise and they
[8:31] were given in marriage until the day
[8:35] that Noah entered into the ark and the
[8:39] flood came and destroyed them all
[8:44] likewise also as it was in the days of
[8:48] lot they did eat they drank they bought
[8:52] they sold they planted
[8:55] and they build it but the same day that
[9:00] lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and
[9:03] brimstone from heaven and destroyed them
[9:07] all even thus shall it be in the day
[9:13] when the Son of Man is revealed now as
[9:21] I've said they're all world changed from
[9:25] idyllic conditions from innocence to a
[9:30] wild pleasure crazy civilization at that
[9:36] particular time and God looked down upon
[9:42] this wickedness upon the spiritual and
[9:46] moral pollution of the land of his
[9:50] people he saw the violence he saw the
[9:55] wildness he saw the uncontrollable a sin
[9:59] and evil that prevailed over the land
[10:03] and about that time I believe God said
[10:09] it's time for a change
[10:12] then came the flood to wash away those
[10:17] that had polluted the earth now of
[10:22] course we know what pollution is not a
[10:24] new thing they were already polluting
[10:27] the earth at that time now this is our
[10:32] day we're in our day and in our time men
[10:36] women brothers sisters people everywhere
[10:40] just look around you and see what is
[10:43] taking place if the conditions as it was
[10:47] in the days of Noah
[10:49] if those very identical conditions do
[10:54] not exist in our time and in our present
[10:59] age and Jesus said it would prophesied
[11:03] as it was in the day
[11:06] up north so shall it be in the day when
[11:10] the Son of Man is being revealed and I
[11:14] believe that is this thing I believe
[11:16] again he is signaling it's time for a
[11:20] change
[11:21] God is signaling to us it's time for
[11:25] there to be a change oh yes
[11:29] shall it should be of course according
[11:32] to Revelation chapter 18 11 and verse 18
[11:37] when the scripture says God in his word
[11:42] speaking that he would destroy those who
[11:46] destroy the earth Oh brothers and
[11:50] sisters what a terrible time we're
[11:53] living in living in a world pollutant in
[11:57] every way nature itself is at a turning
[12:02] point
[12:04] nature is beginning to renew itself we
[12:08] have faced with the disaster of climate
[12:13] change the Earth's being ravaged by
[12:19] hurricanes typhoons tornadoes in the
[12:29] heavens tremors upon the earth beneath
[12:33] or quakes everywhere and all of these
[12:39] signs in the heavens and upon the earth
[12:42] are coming upon the world with
[12:47] increasing rapidity and as these dangers
[12:53] become closer and closer in time friends
[12:57] we're headed for the windup of all
[13:01] things I believe at this very moment
[13:05] while we're speaking whether it be in
[13:09] the political realm the realm of
[13:11] governments government world systems we
[13:15] are in the midst of
[13:18] spiritual global renovation the entire
[13:25] world system is now being renovated it
[13:31] is being reconstructed in a condition
[13:36] for renewal there's change going on
[13:41] there is absolute change taking place
[13:45] we're living in a changing world and
[13:48] things are changing around us and we
[13:51] must be aware of these changes that are
[13:54] taking place so the world systems
[13:59] various governments movements are being
[14:03] made movements are taking place whether
[14:08] you read whether you recognize them or
[14:12] not
[14:12] they're taking place and the
[14:16] reconstruction of this new world the
[14:23] renewing of all the systems of the world
[14:27] to meet the needs and challenges of our
[14:33] changing world is taking place right now
[14:36] while we are speaking many many discs
[14:41] disparate different things are taking
[14:44] place but really in fact they're all
[14:47] connected with one goal to change the
[14:52] structure of the entire world to change
[14:57] the way the world operates how it moves
[15:01] and that is taking place when we are
[15:04] speaking when noir came on the scene it
[15:09] was praying for the world to change from
[15:13] innocence to conscience when Jesus came
[15:18] it was time for the world to change from
[15:22] law to grace but the people of Jesus's
[15:27] day missed their day they
[15:31] mess what was really happening they were
[15:36] busy with their daily lives some were
[15:40] even busy with their church life busy in
[15:43] the synagogue busy and worshipping God
[15:47] and hurrying on but they with their
[15:50] religious sales of dogs and rams and
[15:54] goats n' and pigeons and various things
[15:58] merchandising had invaded the temple of
[16:01] god corruption and evil
[16:04] this guy's under the cloak of religion
[16:07] was everywhere and Jesus appeared on the
[16:13] scene first John the Baptist and then
[16:17] Jesus came on the scene now we realize
[16:21] that the people in Jesus's day missed
[16:25] their change they missed their change
[16:29] point they miss the turning point of
[16:32] their age and they fail to recognize God
[16:38] Saint boost for their day you say well
[16:42] rather say mean what do you mean God's a
[16:44] sign both now we know according to
[16:48] Scripture that the appearance of a
[16:52] prophet on the scene is a sign to the
[16:56] age something is fixing to happen
[17:01] God is fixin to move something is about
[17:06] to take place and so John the Baptist's
[17:11] coming on the scene his appearance was
[17:14] God's sign posts God's a signpost
[17:20] pointing to the coming of the word the
[17:25] coming of the Lord Jesus Christ this
[17:31] sign was to all peoples all nations all
[17:36] powers high and low it was a sign that
[17:41] God was fixing to fulfill his word
[17:45] I was fixing to change the age from law
[17:50] to grace now we recognize understand
[17:56] friends we recognize in our day at least
[18:00] I recognize what is happening and I
[18:03] trust that you will recognize what is
[18:06] really taking place because the people
[18:09] in John's day fail to recognize who he
[18:13] really was they failed to recognize what
[18:17] was actually taking place and that he
[18:21] was a signal to them that the times are
[18:25] a-changing our world was changing the
[18:30] world system was changing the way things
[18:35] were to be done we're going to change
[18:38] and this prophet John appearing on the
[18:43] scene was the sign and symbol of the
[18:47] appearance and cunning of the word and
[18:50] of the changing of the times now in the
[18:55] scriptures Matthew chapter 17 verses 10
[19:02] to 13 the disciples came to Jesus and
[19:09] asked him saying why then say the
[19:14] scribes that Elias must first come that
[19:19] is Elijah but I say Elias truly shall
[19:26] come first and restore all things but I
[19:32] say unto you that Elias is come already
[19:37] and they knew him not but have done unto
[19:43] him whatsoever they listed likewise
[19:49] shall also the Son of man suffer of them
[19:55] then
[19:57] the disciples understood that he spoke
[20:01] unto them of John the Baptist so John
[20:08] the Baptist was the Elijah for that day
[20:12] he was the man anointed with this spirit
[20:18] of Elijah to fulfill the Word of God for
[20:23] they D now brothers and sisters they
[20:27] missed God samples they miss God's
[20:31] signal to them that the time for a
[20:35] change had come from the old laws to
[20:40] grace for us Paul said the law was only
[20:45] used as a schoolmaster to bring us to
[20:50] Christ
[20:51] now the disciple says master a we
[20:55] thought Elijah was supposed to come and
[21:00] Jesus said he's already come but it was
[21:05] you who didn't recognize him you did not
[21:09] recognize who he really was he was the
[21:15] voice crying in the wilderness prepare
[21:20] ye the way of the Lord John the Baptist
[21:23] was the voice of God to the people for
[21:26] that day and for that age furthermore he
[21:31] was the Elijah that was supposed to come
[21:37] spoken of in the first part of malachite
[21:41] for fights when he says what Elijah will
[21:45] turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[21:49] children now we see friends that he also
[21:55] was the fulfillment behold I send my
[22:00] messenger before my face Malachi 3:1 he
[22:07] was the fourth
[22:08] of that one who was to be the messenger
[22:12] that would come before the Lord Jesus
[22:16] Christ the signpost to the age pointing
[22:22] to and making people aware of the coming
[22:26] of the Lord Jesus Christ his first
[22:29] coming his coming as the word returning
[22:35] as the word making them aware but here
[22:39] was the Word of God the Lamb of God come
[22:42] upon the scene so here we are John was
[22:48] there on the scene to identify and to
[22:54] certify that he Jesus was the real true
[22:59] certified Lamb of God the Word of God
[23:04] made flesh for he stood by the river and
[23:08] said behold the lamb of God that taketh
[23:12] away the sins of the world hallelujah
[23:16] praise the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[23:19] know their failure to recognize who John
[23:25] was also who John really was let me
[23:32] pause here little well that John was not
[23:35] just the son of you know Zacharias and
[23:39] Elizabeth he was much more than that as
[23:42] Jesus said he was a prophet and more
[23:45] than a prophet amongst men and so ah the
[23:50] people failed to recognize just a few
[23:53] resinize who he was but others did not
[23:56] recognize who really John was to them he
[24:00] was oh he was one of our local boys you
[24:03] know that born if you may say it this
[24:07] way he was born down in Kentucky he's
[24:10] one of our boys you know and we know his
[24:14] mother and father Charles and Ella Bren
[24:18] Hammer I
[24:19] to him when he went to school I know him
[24:23] when he worked on the hydro lines I
[24:27] don't know what profit you're talking
[24:30] about because I know John I know
[24:33] Elizabeth I know Zach
[24:35] Zacharias yes but they failed to
[24:38] recognize who he really was that he was
[24:42] the messenger for that day that turned
[24:45] the voice of God to that age and that
[24:48] season and a messenger that came before
[24:51] the first coming of the Lord and Savior
[24:56] Jesus Christ yes friends Tinkerman they
[25:01] failed to recognize who Jesus who John
[25:05] was and my goodness they failed to
[25:08] recognize who Jesus the word was which
[25:13] caused them to persecute and to crucify
[25:18] him my friends and they did not realize
[25:24] that they were persecuting and
[25:27] crucifying the very God they worship and
[25:33] claimed deserve there it was the word
[25:38] being fulfilled singing the songs and
[25:44] songs of Zion praises to Jehovah in the
[25:49] temple while crucifying him up on the
[25:55] hill but God signified who he was by
[25:59] ripping up the veil of the temple from
[26:03] top to bottom so they can recognize
[26:07] deity made manifest in humanity yes sir
[26:11] all of that happen because they fail to
[26:16] recognize the samples of their day and
[26:20] of their age they fail to recognize that
[26:26] everything John said and done was
[26:30] pointing to Christ
[26:33] was pointing to the word and as it was
[26:37] then
[26:38] so is it today the church is at another
[26:44] turning point as the Pharisees Sadducees
[26:49] and the Jewish nation was at that time
[26:53] so is it in our day that the church
[26:57] world is at another turning point
[27:01] because friends when you're on a highway
[27:05] it is very important that you recognize
[27:11] the upcoming turning points change
[27:17] points exit ramps where you can are a
[27:22] place where you can turn around they
[27:26] fail to recognize what is happening
[27:30] because they weren't looking for the
[27:33] same post it's happened to me
[27:36] I've been driving on the highways here
[27:40] in Canada or in the United States and as
[27:43] I'm driving along I am talking I'm
[27:47] talking to somebody beside me and
[27:50] somehow I missed this signpost that
[27:55] pointed to my turnoff my friends who
[28:01] hasn't done that this is what has
[28:04] happened and now the church is faced
[28:07] with that type of a situation they're
[28:11] there on a broad highway and as the
[28:15] church world has been traveling along
[28:18] God sent His sight both in our name a
[28:23] 20th century prophet by the name of
[28:26] William Maryland brand ham born in
[28:29] Kentucky anointed by the Holy Spirit and
[28:33] use across the world and vindicated by
[28:38] the pillar of fire in the presence of
[28:40] Almighty God and the church world only
[28:44] recognizes when he
[28:46] benefited them by bringing many many to
[28:51] Jesus Christ into their ranks but when
[28:54] God anointed him to call them vipers the
[29:00] callin snakes in the grass when God
[29:03] anointed him to put the axe to the
[29:05] foundation of their teachings the roots
[29:09] they turned against him when he began to
[29:13] expand the Word of God and said this is
[29:17] restoration time the Word of God is not
[29:20] being restored to the church because the
[29:23] church has drifted off of her foundation
[29:26] drifted off of her original position
[29:29] back to the word back to the original
[29:32] faith and he began to expand the word of
[29:35] God to them and then my friends as he
[29:38] began to expand them bring their word
[29:41] and bring out the various doctrines in
[29:45] the Bible that are founded in the Bible
[29:49] itself scripture upon Scripture by
[29:52] revelation to the people they turn
[29:55] around and rejected him and rejected the
[30:00] word on the basis that it did not agree
[30:04] with their teaching rather than the fact
[30:08] of it agreeing with the word we know
[30:13] that what he has taught and what he has
[30:16] said and breathe with the word as much
[30:20] as we can say 100% but it does not agree
[30:26] with their doctrines upon which they
[30:29] founded these various organizations upon
[30:32] and it's a truth to have a prophet
[30:37] bringing a message that will threaten
[30:40] their entire existence as an
[30:43] organization when he proves that their
[30:46] foundational doctrines are false
[30:50] misguided and built many times on
[30:53] sinking cents think about it yes sir
[30:57] so here is
[30:59] oh man ordinary man comes on the scene
[31:03] and the church world fails to recognize
[31:07] who he is who he was all friends all now
[31:15] we find that they began to attack him
[31:20] they wanted his head as they did John's
[31:23] head back there this do every pull every
[31:28] trick every religious trick the Bible
[31:31] said they mocked his mouth they watched
[31:34] his every move they criticized his
[31:38] message they criticized everything that
[31:42] he said they box
[31:44] they they they tried to pass an elephant
[31:49] through a needle and do everything else
[31:52] to try to prove him wrong but they will
[31:56] not stand with him face to face when he
[31:59] stood in Chicago in front of for
[32:02] hundreds of their church leaders and
[32:06] their diligence and challenged them and
[32:09] said show me in the scriptures anything
[32:13] that I've taught that is not according
[32:16] to the Word of God not one of them stood
[32:20] up to challenge him but after he's dead
[32:23] and gone and his message continues and
[32:27] it is not dead or dying but it's a life
[32:31] it's moving and it's growing more than
[32:34] it ever was by the thousands and tens of
[32:39] thousands and millions around the world
[32:42] my friends there is a revival going on a
[32:46] genuine Holy Ghost Pentecostal revival
[32:51] none of the smothered Pentecost but of
[32:53] the original one anointed by the Word of
[32:57] God for the aged and for the owl
[33:00] nobody's gone he is been called all
[33:05] kinds of names all manner of things have
[33:08] been said about him
[33:09] Oh
[33:11] evening wolves even amongst his own
[33:16] followers have arisen some that are
[33:20] nothing but reddening wolves false
[33:24] teachers twisting a word of god with a
[33:29] Judas spirit upon them that will walk
[33:32] with him for so long and seize their
[33:36] opportunity to sell him out and have him
[33:41] and his message crucified before the
[33:45] world shame upon you the Holy Spirit of
[33:49] the Living God sees and knows everything
[33:51] being said and done by every person
[33:54] that's saying undoing it and the Holy
[33:57] Spirit knows who we are and we reward us
[34:01] according to our works for his ability
[34:07] for his humility his unparalleled
[34:09] humility for the divine love manifested
[34:14] through this wonderful messenger prophet
[34:18] God said to the aged all my friends what
[34:23] a blessing that God sent him to visit
[34:27] leart but the church there goes flying
[34:32] fast on the highway speeding up the
[34:35] highway and go right past God signpost
[34:38] and feeling as if all this world because
[34:43] they could they're able to continue the
[34:45] drive they're able to continue to be in
[34:47] the driver's seat they continue to be
[34:50] able to base their drop their blessings
[34:54] their success their prosperity upon
[34:57] numbers of upon upon the finance upon
[35:01] all the amassing of properties and stuff
[35:04] of that nature and the Bible says in in
[35:08] Revelation chapter 3 verse 18 and
[35:11] knowest thou not that you're Richard
[35:15] blind naked and don't know it because

[35:28] growing yes my friends that's not the
[35:31] word the words that's because you sit
[35:33] like that because genuine faithful

[36:09] you don't know you don't recognize that
[36:12] you're being blinded you're being led
[36:14] away from the Word of God and you're
[36:16] gone past God signed book I'd like to
[36:19] call your attention back go back and
[36:23] study and look in the Word of God link
[36:27] it with the life of this marvelous
[36:29] wonderful prophet that God has sent and
[36:32] see God has fulfilled his word in our
[36:37] day and is fulfilling his word in our
[36:40] day and we ought to come to attention of
[36:43] the Word of God for this day and for
[36:46] this hour a true prophet William Marion
[36:51] Britton the servant of God a broad high
[36:55] waves before you but there's a highway
[36:59] there and there's a way there are lines

[37:32] bigger like the Giants that walk in the
[37:35] land in the times of North or the J
[37:38] that were in the time of David who had
[37:42] to strengthen with a rock uh uh under
[37:46] the brook the revelation out of the word
[37:49] so that they can recognize that there is
[37:53] a God in heaven there's a God who rules
[37:56] over all things but it is not my friends
[38:00] it is not the time for us to feel
