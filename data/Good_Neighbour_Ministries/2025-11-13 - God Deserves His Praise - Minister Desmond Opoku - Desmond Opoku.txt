Oh God, thank you father. We committed everything to the hand and we take every spirit in here under our control for the glory of God. Amen and amen. &gt;&gt; We're going to read the book of uh St. Luke chapter 19 verse 29 29-4 [snorts] St. In Luke 19:29-4 And it came to pass when he was come near to Beth and Bethany at a m at a mount called the Mount of Olives. He sent two of his disciples, saying, "Go ye into the village over against you. In the which acts you are entering, ye shall find a coat tied whereon yet never man shall lose him and bring him hither." And if any man asks you, why do you lose him? Thou shall say, thou shall ye say unto him, because the Lord has need of him. And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them. And as they were loosening the coat, the owner thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the coat? And they said, The Lord needed of him. And they brought him to Jesus, and they cast their garment upon the cold, and they set Jesus there on. And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way. And when he saw when he was come near even now at the descent of the Mount Olive, the whole multitude of the disciple began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty work that they had seen, saying, "Blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the Lord. peace in heaven and glory in the highest. And some of the Pharisees from among the multitudes said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples. And he said, and he answered and said unto them, I tell you that if thee should hold their peace, the stone will immediately cry out. May the Lord add his blessing. Um maybe maybe se may maybe be seated. You may be seated. My topic tonight God deserve his praises. God deserve his praises. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We have to praise our king &gt;&gt; the Lord Jesus Christ. where the word said even if these people stop rejoicing the soul will rise up every living thing will stand up and praise him because he was God and everything that's around them was created for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So every everything on this earth has to praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe every believer [clears throat] have to learn to praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You don't have to the preacher don't have to come and stand here praise the Lord and you stand praise the Lord. That is not real &gt;&gt; to me. That doesn't read that a preacher will come and stand on the pulpit and preaching the mighty gospel that God has given you and tell you praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's not right. There's something that is in you have to tell you you have to praise him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Nobody can tell me that I shouldn't praise my Lord. Hallelujah. God deserve his praises from the SAINTS OF GOD ALL THE TIME. &gt;&gt; Not sometime, all the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I love to praise the Lord. It doesn't matter where I stand. &gt;&gt; Even my death, I going to wake up and praise the Lord before I GO BACK. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND when I believe if the Lord tell it and I I I I even lay down before the time, you're going to see me smiling. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I will I will squeeze my FACE BECAUSE WHAT GOD HAS GIVEN TO ME &gt;&gt; NOBODY ON THIS EARTH &gt;&gt; CAN GIVE it to me. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I'M TELLING YOU I AM HAPPY. &gt;&gt; When I say I am happy, I am happy. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. THANK YOU. &gt;&gt; NOBODY CAN MAKE ME HAPPY THAN GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE EVERY MAN CAN FAIL ME, BUT GOD CAN NEVER FAIL ME. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. GLORY TO GOD. WE THAT'S WHY I ALWAYS SAY WE ARE THE HAPPIEST PEOPLE on the face OF THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HOW CAN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING? It's God that WAKES YOU UP. &gt;&gt; HOW CAN YOU GO TO WORK? GOD THAT TAKE YOU TO WORK. &gt;&gt; HOW CAN YOU COME TO CHURCH? GOD BRING YOU HERE. &gt;&gt; Why you BRING YOU HERE FOR? HE BRING YOU HERE TO PRAISE HIM. &gt;&gt; TO GLORIFY HIM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I believe there is no limitation &gt;&gt; to praise our God. &gt;&gt; You know every time we come here and the and the and the brother come here to stand there, let your church pass up, WE ARE HERE TO WHAT? TO WORSHIP HIM. WHY GOD TELL DAVID? David is a MAN OF MY HEART. &gt;&gt; DAVID IS A MAN OF PRAISE. &gt;&gt; YEAH. Have you ever checked in the book of Psalms? &gt;&gt; Lord of praises HOW THAT JERICHO FELL DOWN THE PRAISES. They sang, they danced, THEY PUT A tambourine and what and and they have that in the uh what do you the the trumpet? &gt;&gt; Amen. And they ser and when they going and they dancing and they praising and THEY ARE REJOICING. THE LORD HAS DONE IT ALREADY BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE him that HE HAS ALREADY DONE IT. &gt;&gt; SO THEY REJOICE BEFORE THEY SEE THE ACTION. &gt;&gt; IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE ACTION OF GOD, PRAISE HIM. &gt;&gt; THEN YOU CAN SEE THE ACTION OF GOD IN YOUR LIFE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Oh glory. Hallelujah. I'm tell you I'm happy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am excited. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHEN IT COMES TO THE GOSPEL OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST, I BECAME SO EXCITED. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. &gt;&gt; THE PEOPLE MAY THINK THAT I'M I'M CUCKOO, BUT THAT'S THE WAY I WORSHIP MY GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, JESUS. &gt;&gt; I find out even this message, people shy to praise God. SOMEBODY CAN SIT IN THE CHURCH THE WHOLE OF HIS LIFE NEVER AT ONE TIME praise the Lord until the pastor or the minister tell him praise the Lord before he praise God. &gt;&gt; What kind of believer is that? I too HAPPY FOR WHAT GOD HAS DONE FOR you &gt;&gt; on Calvary &gt;&gt; WHEN HE WAS HANGING ON THE CROSS. &gt;&gt; MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME? HALLELUJAH. WHO? BECAUSE OF YOU. HALLELUJAH. THANK YOU JESUS. If the Lord Jesus Christ hasn't come where we will be standing today. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Can you remember where you took from?

Who offerth praises glorify me. &gt;&gt; Who offer praises glorify who? God. Amen. 66 and 66 says 2, make his praises glorious. Hebrew 13:15, offer sacrifices of praise.

Sometimes all thy works shall praise thee. Isaiah 38:9. There's a lot of excuses about praises, but I just pick up a few. Isaiah 38:19, the living shall praise thee. The living, the living, THAT MEANS THE DEAD CANNOT praise God. SO WE CAN PRAISE HIM WHILE WE ARE ALIVE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH, glory to God. &gt;&gt; WHY THE CHILDREN OF GOD CAN PRAISE GOD? Every time when you read the Bible, you see when the Jewish the the our brethren, the Jewish people when they worshiping and dancing, they form a circle and and singing and go around and dancing and dancing and praising the Lord. &gt;&gt; They know how to praise our God. Let us learn how to PRAISE OUR GOD. THEN YOU SEE the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Acts 2:47. Praising God and having favor with the people and the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved. Praising God and the Lord have a favor and he added to the church such as to be save as uh uh such as should be saved. Hallelujah. Thank you Lord. Hallelujah. David was a man of God heart.
