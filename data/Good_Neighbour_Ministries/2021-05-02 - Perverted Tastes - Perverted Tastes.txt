TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] another good sunday morning to you my friends it is with great joy i come with to you in the name of the lord jesus christ believing and trusting god that the blessed holy spirit of almighty god will rest upon us as we hear the word and speak the word and receive the word may the great holy spirit receive all glory honor and praise for he has said and i if i be lifted up from the earth i will draw all men unto me may he receive his glory his honor and his praise this eternal everlasting and omniscient one god bless you my friends for coming into his presence as we wait upon him trusting him that he will send forth an outpouring of his word by his holy spirit may the lord bless us all together my subject for today is perverted tastes perverted tastes a scripture is found in john the gospel of john chapter 7. reading from verse 30 7. in the last day the great day of the feast jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water but this speak he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the holy ghost was not yet given because jesus was not yet glorified thank god for the reading of his word which is the breaking of the bread of life to our hearts praise god thank god amen yes sir we thank god for the lord jesus because we know that he is the one as the scripture says john 3 16 a very common verse god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him not on him but in him should not perish but would have eternal life thank god that he gave of that life or of that water of life amen and he gave it to a thirsty perishing people of that particular age you say brother simon well how did he do it he did it by being crucified allowing himself to be crucified on calvary and allowing his own and poured out his own blood he did not spill his own blood for spilling his blood that could be an accident he did not accidentally do this he did not accidentally die for your sins he purposely had a mission to die he had his purpose and his purpose was redemption through blood and so he gave his life as a ransom for many he is the one my brothers that literally poured out his life the waters of his life the water the life of course is in the blood and he poured it out with an intentional act of giving his life for others that he might be the fountain of life and also the bread basket of life oh hallelujah as david said oh this man was born there little bethlehem least among the tribes least among the cities of judah but oh thank god the wheat basket the wheat a basket of israel praise god naturally speaking spiritually jesus the bread basket of the entire world that we can feed upon him and the waters from the well types though he is the water of life to quench all of the thirst of the entire human race jesus born at bethlehem a bethlehem there he was cradled or in the hay cradled with the yoke they cl swaddling clothes he was cradled there but thank god he's looking for another place to be cradled here today oh my god hallelujah and to think that my god chose me chose you to come in and dwell in our hearts cradle himself within these stinking sinful hearts transformed by the power of god changed by the blood of jesus christ to a place where he can come and cradle himself within our hearts that he might display from us the pouring forth of the waters of life to to the perishing people that are around us that they they can come and receive refreshing waters pouring out from our lives praise god that he is the living bread and he is the living water of whom we partake of thanks be to god may he find a dwelling place within the manger of your heart and my heart praise god now from the text we read on the last day of the feast jesus stood up and shouted to everyone hello heart give me your attention every one of you who that you're thirsty come you can drink and when you drink out of your bellies will flow rivers of living waters of course they did not understand but he was speaking of the spirit of almighty god that would when it comes in to build the believer it will just overflow itself and pour out upon all those around it praise god hallelujah and so is it with a true genuine believer if you have a genuine born-again experience born by the word amen then your experience my friends you can hardly contain yourself you you're like you're walking on air praise god and that experience is like an artisan well springing up within you unto it into eternal life and as jesus said out of your belly flowing rivers of living waters praise squad bubbling up within you something about it that you have nothing to do with but the spirit of god that is in you keeps stirring it up stirring it up within your stove oh praise god hallelujah when the spirit of god begins to move in you my friends you can't freeze up in the house of god you can't no man made cold dead church is going to freeze you up nothing like that can hold you down amen praise god many of them out there they're frozen icicles all around them you gotta take a hammer to crack the ice around them before they can come alive and they can be moved in the spirit of almighty god hallelujah glory to god there's many of the churches out there begging for revival people are asking for revival within their hearts amen more praise god and man my friends that are under that is just like that way amen but glory to god forevermore brother sister i am happy to say that i have that within me you know when they had the last welsh uh revival the revival in wales in britain uh someone came off a train trying to find the spot where the revival was and when they got off the train he saw a policeman so he said officer officer or where is the revival where is the revival and the officer looked at him he says sir where is the revival you're looking at the revival i am the revival the revival is in me praise god hallelujah and that's what it really is oh my the review are the revival the move of god is in you the revival is in your soul and bubbles up as jesus said into eternal life and nothing can freeze over your experience oh the holy spirit is here to praise god let the joy of god be your strength and to bubble up within you every morning you're awake every day you rise from your bed every time you're walking out there with a whistle on your or in your heart with a joy in your soul with a spring in your step oh my a smile on your face and the grace of god bubbling up within you amen hallelujah thank god brother sister god created man to have a thirst to have desires within them and that thirst is a creation of god that god himself allowed to be within your heart right or wrong is set before each one of us the tree of life and the tree of death or of knowledge of good and evil is set before all of us as it was in the garden of eden and god has made us to thirst and many take that blessed holy thirst or desire or taste that god placed within them to curse after him and begin to thirst long desire and lust after the things that are in the world now there's a great uh man called plato many of you may or may not know of plato plato had this theory which of course is in the bible that man is a tree part being you're made up of three parts soul spirit and body so plato brought forth the theory that each part of the human being has appetites thirsts or desires tastes things that come from within you and as i four said god placed in man natural appetites natural thirsts and tastes and certain we find out friends that god has given us the desire to have food you can't go without food you can't live on air oh my yes man has made this made to be a social being and to have fellowship one with the other that is why isolation is a punishment when people are isolated oh my think of it because man was made to be a social being a man was made with sexual desires for sexual reproduction that is desire placed there in man giving them desire to love and to be loved god has given us that desire but what satan has done and is doing he has perverted these natural tastes desires and appetites that god has given to man and twisted them like he did eve away from the word to knowledge of good and of evil and the wisdom of this world and lead men and women astray from the things of god that instead of them having a source for god they are for the word they have a thirst for the world and the things that are of the world and so he puts a thirst in the people to run to night clubs and to cocktail parties and to live immoral and drink drugs smoke and that thirst is in there given to you by god but satan twists it around to the evil and to the wrong things and you will never be satisfied by such things i said you will never be satisfied until you come and drink from christ the fountain of eternal life that's flowing here today to fill your soul and satisfy your longing meet all your needs praise god and place you to a place my friends ah where you are alive because the devil is deceiving the people that now you're living now you're drinking now you're smoking now you're womanizing yeah now you're a harlotry around and uh going here and lying and cheating and do whatever you have to do now you're living but god's word says now you're dying now you're dead for he he or she that liveth in sin is dead even while they think they are alive oh praise god my brothers my sisters hallelujah we look to god the order of eternal life praise god when we are truly born again and have the artisan well of the holy spirit pouring forth from within our souls then my friends it's it's a living fountain because it's flowing day and night glory to god hallelujah you don't have to wait for uh for another local church revival in other words just church and advertise we have a revival but that's a local church revival meant for their local church oh my oh we have a revival i want to invite you to this revival for this certain brand of church i want you to invite you to this certain brand of church they have a revival over there we're not talking about that kind of revival we're talking about a god-sent heaven-set revival that reaches out to one and all and when the rain falls it doesn't discriminate it doesn't fall in one one place here and one church and avoid the other no it falls everywhere but as if you want it if you want it some people put up an umbrella because they don't want the holy spirit reign of the open word to fall upon them but they want to protect themselves and run from it and run and hide but to the true believer we don't have to wait on any local revival drummed up with the preacher coming with revival in his suitcase and when he's stepping that pulpit and open that suitcase revival jumps out oh no the revival is a heaven-sent revival no man no person has to be there the holy spirit takes charge glory to god move in the hearts of the people moving the hearts of the pastor move in the hearts of the deacons the helpers and all the blessed sisters of god those queens that god set here for his glory and for his honor hallelujah amen getting the fresh pure unadulterated uncontaminated word of god preached to your soul hallelujah and then the word vindicates itself by saints by wonders by miracles by supernatural occurrences which you may think it's an accident or or it's a coincidence it's not a coincidence god is in the midst god is on the move god is speaking goddess is the one outpouring himself glory to god hallelujah and we are happy in the lord because the holy spirit is in us bubbling up with a hidden power i tell you my brother sister you don't realize but you have hidden power within your soul you have hidden power within your being it's the holy spirit in you bubbling up within you and it's a secret that you're carrying around with you that's why you're going everywhere with a smile on your face with a joy within your heart because you're carrying a secret amen mary carried a secret for a while hallelujah and before it could be seen by others she already knew thus saith the lord thou shalt bear a son and you shall call his name jesus hallelujah thou shalt have a christ-like character amen oh and you carry that secret within your heart within your soul and the joy of god the peace of god passing all men's understanding bubbles up within you like a ever present water from the rock oh glory to god thank god you're carrying a secret you're carrying a secret because it's individual and a private secret between you and jesus christ one songwriter said me and jesus we got a good thing going me and jesus we got it all worked out me and jesus hallelujah the word of god i trust every one of you have something going with the lord jesus christ a personal private secret relationship within your heart that you enjoy between yourself and the lord jesus christ oh praise god satan's prime activity one of his prime activities i say friends is to pervert the original taste that god place in man when man was created perverting human thirst and desire away from the natural appetites to unnatural appetites remember satan is not a creator so he already he has to take what god already has made and then mess it up take a life that god has made clean pure mess it up that's what he does god gives us all natural taste as human beings natural desires and appetites and satan comes along with a temptation with a loss with a lie with some cheating and turns on our perverts that natural taste and causes you to use it for something contrary to the word of god listen friends this time that we're living in young men young women they're getting old before their time some of the men young men young women they get to 2025 and some of those young women are already entering into menopause how shocking you say brother simon how is that what's doing it let me tell you it's the hybrid food the hybrid food that they are feeding the people is causing this kind of thing to go on yes the life that the people are living today is influence because you become what you eat and so they eat perverted food and they end up living perverted life and it's uh the scientists splitting all these things and doing that brought us to this where they're literally killing you with hybrid food and in the churches this is what has happened the high breeding of the word of god they're mixing in man-made material along with the word of god and feeding that to you and when you're eating it it tastes like the word of god but at the same time you're taking in some man-made material and then what does it produce a perverted christ-so-called christian life a perverted representation of christ which is contrary to the word of god amen listen it's the hybrid food the hybrid spiritual preaching that's producing a bunch of hybrid church members claiming that they are really christians but that's not different than some of the oversized turkeys that they hybrid the turkey instead of a normal natural turkey or a normal natural chicken that's the meat is tight and sweet uh all to the taste they pervert it so they can uh profit and make money off of it so they can uh reproduce faster and they can grow bigger and have more pounds so they can make more money yes sir and this is what happens and then the turkey can hardly walk because it's carrying so much weight and it's so heavy and the hands the hands and the under all the chickens become so heavy because of the hybrid food it's not the bird's fault it's the kind of food that they're feeding to those birds and it's the kind of fifth uh foolishness fed to church members the hybrid nonsense that's being fed to them causing them to get big in the head filled with pride filled with self until they're falling over they can hardly walk the line straight they can hardly have a balanced christian life but other than that they're falling off left right and center on the extremes everywhere amen yes sir oh can't hardly reproduce themselves and there they find they got to have some kind of a a religious geological pill to wake them up or a pill to put them to sleep appeal to make them feel high and holy appeal for this and appeal for that but we got the power of god in a word of god that will lift your heart your soul for he said who everyone to me that thirst at oh drink from the waters and then you will never thirst again and out of your belly will flow rivers of living waters oh hallelujah praise god amen brother sister science civilization and human education now i'm not saying that education is wrong but i'm saying that they're putting all kinds of stuff in there and leading men astray from the word of god and teaching your children all kinds of things contrary to the word of god and the human race is being destroyed by this we destroy ourselves just like the dead mother eve there in the garden of eden and it's running on like that even on to this day as i've said before man is made with natural appetites and one of those appetites we are made to thirst we are made to thirst desire or have a taste for we have all a desire for love to love and be loved there's nobody i know not human they may say they don't desire that but we all have a desire to to be loved and to love because that's a natural god-given desire that he has placed in us and so it's not wonder or secret that young men and women in particular in the prime of their lives they thirst for love that thirst in their desires to love one another as the songwriter says someone to care someone to share all my struggles like no other can do you'll come down from the skies wipe the tears from your eyes you're his child and he cares for you hallelujah amen so it's not true for women to love man and man to love woman amen and we thirst and have this desire within us and satan takes that and perverts it and creates immorality creates all manner of adultery fornications causes all manner of sexual sin oh my friends let us pay heed to the word of god we see another uh thirst god has placed in the human race is a thirst especially in women these days you can't be too sure about that it may cross over and even go to some men but that thirst to be beautiful women source for beauty and it's natural for them to have that taste and that desire listen uh doesn't matter whether they're young or how old they get how many he how much here or or how little here they have on their head they still are built by god and made that way to have a thirst for beauty and it's a natural thing for a woman to want to look pretty because it's a god-given instinct that god has placed within the woman and god gave her that beauty for her particular mate that she already has or that she will meet later on but god gave you that beauty for that one mate that you're going to meet someday sometime or the mate you already have your beauty is for that person that god gave it to you for and so women want always to be beautiful and pretty and it's not wrong for a woman to want to be beautiful or pretty now i'm just saying my friends christian women i don't believe they should go around with their face all made up and when i say that i'm not talking about makeup i'm saying they're not to go around with their face like grim uh their face looking as we say the mother the kid said gross unnatural out of thought in other words they think by making their face serious making their face grim they're trying to provide themselves us a form of protection to push away anybody or any man any person that would look at them they they throw them off by making their face turn and cream and made up like that but god didn't say that that's what you have to do because that's not making yourself pretty that's making yourself petty but not pretty my brothers and sisters god wants us the women in particular to be beautiful and to be pretty god is not not against that he just doesn't want you to take satan's lie and for satan to come and to pervert that beauty and turn it to worldliness and to the chains of the world as he is doing to the entire human race at this particular time oh stay with me my friends give me a break here let me preach the word of god i trust you will open your hearts to receive the word of god for today some of you may not like it the way i say it but i've got to say it because it's in the bible it comes from the last day prophet it's thus saith the lord it's the saiyan the scriptures this is what we are here for judgment begins at the house of god you got to let the word of god judge you while you're here on earth in the church so that as the scripture said so later on when the real big judgment come you shall not be judged because you've already been judged by the word come my brother come my sister and let the word of god go through your life amen and judge you cleanse you and make you what he wants you to be oh praise god satan has perverted the beauty of women today until he's letting them become so unnatural and then turn around and tell them that is beauty be a model and you can be beautiful be like this dress like that use this certain fashion use a certain color whatever and what is he doing he is perverting the natural or at least playing on the natural appetite or desire god has in your heart and then he's trying to pervert it away from the word of god into the world and the things of the world but his perverted kind of beauty that worldly so-called prettiness is unnatural unholy and it's the most horrible thing that you could think about that a person can walk around like that unnatural out of kilter totally out of balance with life and with the word of god hallelujah you say well brother simon if a woman wants to be pretty if a woman wants to be beautiful and has the desire to do so what should she do your answer is in the word of god it's there in first timothy 9 let the women adorn themselves in modest apparel having a christ-like spirit that's the way the woman should quench her source of being pretty amen in other words your beauty is not so much an outside beauty even though you will have that which she dress modestly with modest apparel hallelujah beautiful amen but the real beauty is a christ-like spirit that is projecting out of that woman that is her real beauty pouring out of her christ in you your beauty christ in you hallelujah your everything praise god you want to be pretty get into christ you want to be pretty follow the word of god the way it should be followed that's the way you can make yourself pretty with a christ-like spirit and dress yourself with modest apparel hallelujah oh my oh i'll tell you what a perverted age we're living in an age where you can hardly differentiate between male and female some of the most horrible looking things you see around you and in the streets when you look at them sometimes they look like an alien from outer space some not even human anymores beyond human ice painted that way lips painted that way listen let me say something here before i continue to speak source people have a right to paint themselves pierce themselves do whatever they want it is their freedom their right and their liberty and i have nothing to do with that they can do that if they want they can twist if they want they can wear all the pants that they have dragging down they can have the chicago walk the special kind of swagger that they they can go with that's their right amen but i also and we as christians have a right also we have the right not to want that we have a right not to desire that and we have a right to also say to us that is wrong to us we don't want it we don't want to see it we don't want to have it we don't want to wear it we don't want to be like that and we have a right to say that too so i'm speaking about our rights amen but those people have their rights that's up to them if they want to live that way but we choose not to live that way i want god's way to be my way throughout my entire life walking in the light of the word of god and not to go around man and even women or i should put it the other way women and even men having lizard looking eyes paints all kinds of things provided by satan and his factories that he enriched a lot of people with to create these uh so-called products that will make you deceive women and deceive men by putting on these painted masks that they wear and a funny looking slanted lizard eyes and eyelashes and so on contrary to the word of god the wearing of all kinds of funny clothes my god they'll sell you a dress that will hardly cover anything that's that small and tell you three thousand dollars for that dress because i'll tell you my god are we becoming like the king that is told the story when the devil will lie to you and tell you that you are well dressed and you're not even dressed amen the king had no clothes and they deceived him and told him he was dressed and that's what the devil is doing today in the world today deceiving the people that they are dressed when they are not he is tripping them and they are ending up undress and dog meat within the world that we are living in god have mercy because we are surrounded by perversions when we have women desiring to have their hair long and reaching out for the bible says a woman's hair is her glory and she is not to cut it off but we find today some women want to shave it all off because it's it's it's it's like it makes me look with the times it's more modern i noticed this fimstar she wore that style and so they go after that instead of looking up the word of the living god oh my and then we have the men out there that bangs and whipped uh rollers in the hair and with earrings nose rings and everything else man and woman that think it's beautiful a little diamond here a little gold here a little dot there oh my nothing is wrong with someone or wearing an earring or somebody wearing rings or something of that nature but i'm trying to show you it's gone into the realm of perversion amen all kinds of piercing whether on your belly button whether it's a piercing on your ears or your nose and nostril and all these things praise god hallelujah brother sisters complete perversion everywhere when we can have men wearing rollers in the hair out there satan is the perverter satan i said is the perverter of the human taste and turning men away from god may i repeat first timothy 2 9 our sisters having the desire to be beautiful pretty the bible said let the women then adorn themselves in modest apparel with a christ-like spirit oh hallelujah milk and subject to their husbands subject to your own husband not subject to somebody else's husband or somebody else's friend or boyfriend or young man or young woman but subject to your husband your own husband amen hallelujah that's the way that you are to adorn your life and a way for you to live just a minute let me touch on something here when it says to be meek and to subject yourself to your husbands it just doesn't mean that you must be a pain in the neck in other words that uh the the woman should be the neck that thinks she always has to turn the head he he just happened to be the head but i'm going to be the neck and i'm going to turn him which side i want to turn him god didn't say that in his word amen listen god put the man to be the head of his home and to be the priest of his home the leader of his family and if there's any men listening to me here god didn't ask you to be some limp loose leaf god didn't ask you to be a mango but to be a man and to stand with the word of god and to have the spirit of a man exuding from you now let me balance that with this god wants the woman to be meek but god didn't take the woman my friends and turn her for you to turn her into a dish rag so that you can have her under your feet and you can step on her walk on her abuse misuse her in any possible way no we are not to do that mentally physically or any other way but the bible tells us in the book of genesis god gave the woman to be a help meet or a mate to help you as you both walk along life's road can two walk together except there be a greed the bible says one cord will be broken but a twofold cord will not be easily broken and the two shall be one flesh and that's going to be oneness when they are together when they work walk think talk and like that together then there's a oneness unbreakable that comes between them a love that grows between them and takes them right on walking down the road of life and when they look back my friends they can only see joy and peace and their offspring will bless them and thank them and praise them for what god has used them to do within their lies amen yes that is satan's job that he goes on with this to pervert your desires pervert the tastes of man and women amen to working giving your your body certain kind of lusting and temptations and desires and appetites and giving your spirit your mind mentally all kinds of pictures all kinds of different desires and stuff like that he plays on that and he will play on your spirit amen play on your body also perversion amen and that's what the nations of the world have taken perverted tastes perverted desires contrary to the word of god back to the bible back to the word of god back to the original faith stand upon the promise for this hour watch what god will do hallelujah they took the virgin thirsting to be pretty thirsting to be handsome trusting to be beautiful all these thirsts we got thirst for water everybody thirsts for joy everybody thirsts for fellowship hallelujah all these truths god put them into us but a lot of people try to satisfy that by partying they're gonna get joy in the jump up joy in the jazz they're gonna have joy like that twisting and twirling somebody else's wife round and round they go turn foot your partner to the left turn heart then to the right oh my god have mercy what a wicked devilish world that we are living in oh my god may he help us here today amen god made us to thirst for him we have to thirst after him and not allow the devil to twist the thoughts of our minds and of our hearts to thirst after something else and to pervert your proper desire and your proper thirst away from that amen hallelujah praise god may god help every one of us here today listening to the word of god god wants us to thirst for him and not for the church hallelujah next week we have mother's day and after that we will pick up this thought from another aspect and go forth in the name of the lord conquering with the word of god and ever to conquer under the anointing on the spirit of the lion of the tribe of judah amen hallelujah may the great holy spirit of this word come forth and watch cleanse save souls amen filled with the holy spirit bring those who were backslidden those who were cold and dead and frozen in denominational uh refrigeration units that the fire of god will unsaw you unfreeze you and bring you to a place of spiritual recognition of what god is doing in this day and in this hour oh god wants us to thirst for him like david said my soul searched this after the living god as the heart painted after the water brooks so does my soul pant or thirst after the living god hallelujah didn't jesus say blessed is he that hungers and thirsts for righteousness for he shall be filled may the holy spirit fill you with his righteousness with his truth of his word and call you to himself don't delay come to him today commit yourself to him not to me not to the any church not to any person but make your commitment in the quietness to christ himself our lord and he will see you through oh thank you lord for this thy word here today and may you bless everyone watching listening wherever they are from around the world in your place god's grace peace mercy and love be upon you god lift you up pick you up and put you on the good foot and you don't have to stand anymore limping around on the bad foot but now you can go on the good foot knowing that he will lead you all the way from earth to glory god bless you my brothers and sisters in christ in the name of jesus christ let us pray one for another much more we see the day approaching [Music] you
