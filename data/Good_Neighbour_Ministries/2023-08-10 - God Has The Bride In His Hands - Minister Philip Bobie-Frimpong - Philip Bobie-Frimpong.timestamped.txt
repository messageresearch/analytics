[22:47] our needs hey man let's give you
[22:49] Applause
[22:54] praise God without wasting my time I'm
[22:57] gonna go to my scriptures right away
[23:01] today's Bible studies I'm going to read
[23:04] a couple of scriptures
[23:06] just bear with me
[23:16] John chapter 10 verse 27 to 30.
[23:28] I have John 15 16 20.
[23:32] and second Timothy 4 17.
[23:51] okay if you guys say Amen
[23:54] my sheep hear my voice and I know them
[24:00] and they follow me
[24:05] and I give unto them eternal life and
[24:07] they shall never perish
[24:09] nether
[24:11] shall any man plug them out of my hand
[24:16] My Father which gave them me is greater
[24:19] than all
[24:21] and no man is able to plug them out of
[24:26] my father's hand I and my father are one
[24:30] in other words we are God you are in
[24:33] God's hand no one
[24:35] can plug you up from his hand even and
[24:39] John 16 16.
[24:47] ye have not chosen me
[24:51] but I have trust in you
[24:54] and ordain you
[24:56] that you you should go and bring forth
[25:00] fruit
[25:01] and that your fruit
[25:04] should remain that whatsoever he shall
[25:08] ask the father in my name
[25:11] he may give it to you
[25:14] these things I command you that you love
[25:17] one another
[25:18] if the word hates you
[25:21] you know that he hated me before he
[25:24] hated you
[25:25] if you are of the world
[25:28] the world will love his own
[25:31] but because you are not of the world
[25:34] but I have chosen you out of the world
[25:36] therefore the world hated you
[25:40] remember this word that I said unto you
[25:43] the servant is no greater than his Lord
[25:46] if they have persecuted me
[25:49] they will also persecute you
[25:51] if they have kept my saying they will
[25:55] keep yours also and my last scripture
[25:59] will be First Timothy second Timothy
[26:02] chapter 4 verse 7 to 10 then we pray
[26:14] in second Timothy chapter
[26:18] for if you have a time read the whole
[26:20] chapter of second Timothy chapter four
[26:25] I have fought a good fight
[26:28] have finished my course
[26:31] have kept my the faith
[26:34] hence for this laid up before me a crown
[26:37] of righteousness which the Lord the
[26:40] righteous judge shall give me at the at
[26:43] that day and not to me only
[26:45] but unto all that them also that love
[26:49] his appearing
[26:51] do thy diligence to come shortly unto me
[26:55] for demons
[26:57] had forsaken me
[26:59] having love this present world
[27:03] and is departed unto thessalonica
[27:06] christended Galicia only Luke is with me
[27:10] take Mark and bring him with thee for
[27:13] his profitable to me for the ministry
[27:15] let's pray
[27:17] who are gracious Eternal God may you
[27:20] bless the rhythm of the word father if I
[27:23] have done anything wrong may you please
[27:25] forgive me if they still don't believe
[27:27] we cast it out in Jesus name may you
[27:30] come and please take me aside and help
[27:33] me to say the right way to bless your
[27:36] bride we thank you we come against
[27:38] anything unlike Christ May the spirit of
[27:41] Christ take absolute control for the
[27:44] remainder of the service and bless
[27:45] everyone here in Jesus name amen please
[27:48] be seated
[27:50] there are so many things in the
[27:52] scriptures that you read
[27:53] that
[27:56] um I don't know if you where to start
[27:58] but
[28:00] as the Bible said that I have you in the
[28:03] hand I I have you in in my hand and no
[28:08] one can plug you out of my hand I was
[28:13] driving and what I was listening when he
[28:16] was talking about his two daughters when
[28:19] one of them said that I got all of daddy
[28:21] and he said that Daddy have got all of
[28:24] you so it's not how much you think you
[28:26] have God
[28:28] but how much God has you
[28:31] if that Living God have you in the palm
[28:34] of his hand then you are so certain that
[28:38] no one
[28:39] can plug out from his hand it doesn't
[28:41] matter what you go through doesn't
[28:43] matter your persecution whatever happens
[28:45] to you once God have you understand no I
[28:49] said my sheep hear my voice a stranger
[28:52] they will not follow because the seed of
[28:55] God dwell inside of you
[28:58] there's no one it doesn't matter what
[29:01] comes your way no matter what
[29:03] persecution trust whatever
[29:06] nothing can plug you out
[29:09] from his hand because he is holding you
[29:12] it's not you holding on to him if you
[29:15] are also pastor always tells us when a
[29:17] child is holding on to the mother's side
[29:19] hand she can just slip away if that
[29:23] mother is holding that child's hand and
[29:25] they're crossing the road there's no way
[29:27] that child can sleep and go anywhere so
[29:30] how much God is holding on to you it all
[29:35] comes back to the seed because all about
[29:37] predestination
[29:39] is that I chose you you didn't choose me
[29:44] so if God chose you
[29:46] then he didn't chose you when you came
[29:48] on the altar before the foundation of
[29:51] this world you were in his mind before
[29:54] everything was created so it wasn't here
[29:57] that he chose to so if God has chosen
[30:00] you and you are one of his chosen look
[30:03] that a movie chosen nothing can well
[30:06] take you away from him because it's not
[30:09] you and that choice is is not because
[30:12] God love
[30:14] um brother Glenn and hate in hate this
[30:17] or that because him being God he know
[30:20] our choices
[30:22] so before even
[30:23] said Jacob and his son were born he said
[30:26] Jacob have I laughed he saw have I hated
[30:31] they were not even born but he being God
[30:34] he knew their choices that they were
[30:37] going to make and Esau made a choice
[30:41] based on his stomach
[30:44] I thought I call it that belly
[30:46] Christians they didn't make he didn't
[30:48] make a choice based on the word of God I
[30:51] think I've been ahead of myself but
[30:52] actually because so many people made
[30:55] choices based on only job
[30:59] but if God has called you to be a
[31:01] Christian and bless you in a certain
[31:04] Ministry
[31:05] and if you know that God has placed you
[31:08] there your choices should be based on
[31:11] his red face
[31:13] not just because of only work because if
[31:16] God
[31:17] placed you under that Ministry his under
[31:20] obligation to provide your needs
[31:24] the moment that Abraham left where God
[31:27] has placed him he was always having
[31:29] trouble
[31:30] so any time that you let prayer God has
[31:34] ordained you to place you you live there
[31:37] you are in trouble because so many
[31:39] people they ignore a lot of warnings
[31:42] God sometimes put a stumbling block
[31:45] doing everything but because they have
[31:47] made their mind up
[31:48] just like
[31:50] um
[31:51] because his mind is full made up no
[31:54] matter what Trap God is putting his way
[31:56] he just gonna ignore it and later when
[32:00] they get in trouble then they want you
[32:02] to build them out I was talking to one
[32:04] brother lasting that so many people they
[32:07] made choices
[32:08] and you advise them they don't listen to
[32:11] you and they get themselves in trouble
[32:13] then they want you to come and build
[32:15] them out of that trouble you made that
[32:18] choice you have to be responsible for
[32:19] your choices you don't expect me to come
[32:22] when there was God made a provided way
[32:24] to make things right and you ignore the
[32:27] one you ignore the advice you ignore
[32:29] everything you went your own way
[32:33] then you are in big trouble then you
[32:36] calling me
[32:37] come and help me out of this whole it
[32:41] isn't going to happen
[32:43] you have to be responsible for your
[32:46] choices
[32:47] amen and the choices that lead the
[32:50] people to their final destination
[32:53] because remember that we are here we
[32:56] have five senses we contact our five
[32:59] senses in the three-dimensional world
[33:01] and that dimenses the matter time and
[33:05] at a matter time and Light
[33:08] so you contact that Dimension with ah
[33:12] five senses see taste smell and all that
[33:15] but there is a super sense
[33:17] which is Faith it doesn't it doesn't
[33:20] based on things that you see or taste or
[33:24] feel and in the Bible everyone
[33:28] that has ever pleased God they make it
[33:32] by faith by faith Abraham by faith
[33:36] enough by faith Elijah by all by faith
[33:39] and it's a revelation because without
[33:42] faith is impossible to please God and
[33:46] Faith doesn't look at things that you
[33:48] naturally see it doesn't look at things
[33:51] that you feel it doesn't look at how the
[33:54] doctor is telling you that your head is
[33:56] Carrying Your Destiny or that it looks
[33:58] beyond that it obeys God's word and
[34:02] God's word is the will of God and every
[34:05] faith has to line up the word of God if
[34:08] anything doesn't line up with this word
[34:11] of God get rid of it don't entertain it
[34:14] and fed up with people telling me I have
[34:16] this Vision I have this better check
[34:18] what they are saying doesn't line up
[34:19] with this word of God and we have to run
[34:22] away from it because everything has to
[34:25] come back to this
[34:26] that's our problem line that's our
[34:29] absolute absolute instead of man is this
[34:32] word of God we best our decisions
[34:35] actions on this word of God and if
[34:38] anything is contrary to it get rid of it
[34:40] don't entertain it amen don't tell me I
[34:44] have this picture I have this no that
[34:46] prophets whatever it has to line up with
[34:48] those words it has to be blessed alone
[34:51] amen praise God and as we know
[34:55] that fourth dimension Express scientists
[34:59] go and they capture the camera uh wave
[35:03] and all those things but from the fourth
[35:05] dimension The Fifth Dimension
[35:08] we swear the people
[35:10] who did not live for God
[35:13] sinners could not repent that's right
[35:16] that means they are because it's just
[35:18] like a nightmare
[35:19] it's like they are you are not fully
[35:21] awake
[35:22] you are not fully sleeping
[35:25] that's where they are those people
[35:26] because your work on this Earth is
[35:29] finished
[35:30] you can't go to the presence of God if
[35:32] you are a sinner
[35:34] but you can also
[35:36] not come back to this world because God
[35:38] has finished with you and it's a
[35:40] terrible place that's how the prophet
[35:42] said that you don't even want your worst
[35:45] enemy to be in that place but the sense
[35:48] of God God's word that sixth Dimension
[35:52] they are in the presence of God Amen
[35:55] that's the dimensions that they hear and
[35:57] they are resting they are the souls on
[35:59] the Altar and the last Dimensions where
[36:02] God himself forth is reciting so all I'm
[36:05] saying is that God has given us choices
[36:08] he's given us Grace and that Grace that
[36:12] God has given you it has a boundaries
[36:14] Once you walk around that boundaries you
[36:16] are free as someone always tells us that
[36:19] when the horse racing you have to that
[36:22] horse has to be in the boundaries of the
[36:23] lane if that horse can raise pain if not
[36:26] in that name they're gonna disqualify
[36:29] him so the grace abounds but that Grace
[36:32] has boundaries
[36:35] amen so all that I'm saying I got to
[36:38] that Festival second Timothy
[36:41] um
[36:42] chapter 4 verse 7 to 10 because I happen
[36:46] to be in a wedding this Saturday
[36:49] and in that wedding I end up sitting
[36:53] with a man I know that he was even a
[36:55] minister whilst we were talking he told
[36:57] Mr minister of the Gospel he had 100
[36:59] people under his ministry
[37:03] so we are talking talking and then
[37:05] asking have we heard about a man called
[37:09] William Maron Branham he said oh I've
[37:12] read about God's General and right away
[37:16] I knew because that God's General when I
[37:19] was like two years in the message
[37:22] I met an uncle here I didn't even know
[37:24] him Ghana and I was so excited to tell
[37:27] me about the word of God for our age and
[37:29] God has sent us the prophet and the man
[37:32] was so bored and angry say my niece my
[37:35] nephew are lost you follow This
[37:38] brilliant Marion Brown go and read God's
[37:40] General
[37:41] so right away I bought that book and I
[37:44] read it and whilst I was reading that
[37:46] book I realized that they take Brown
[37:49] Bram out of contest and put this and put
[37:52] this and they said that he endorsed
[37:55] polygamy and I have read and from
[38:01] um question and answers
[38:03] that even his own son Billy Paul he
[38:06] wouldn't even marry him because he said
[38:08] that he had promised a Catholic girl and
[38:10] you even married him so writer says just
[38:12] false I just throw it somewhere so I
[38:15] told him that brother
[38:17] search for yourself
[38:19] go and get his book and read it don't
[38:24] base it on this God's General and I
[38:29] explained to him I was even blessed by
[38:30] started that they said that he drifted
[38:34] at the end of his ministry that's all
[38:37] they saying that God's General now I was
[38:40] telling him that he's not drifted he was
[38:42] forsaken just like the Lord Jesus Christ
[38:44] in his first pool when he was a young
[38:48] man in one and a half years he was
[38:50] Healing The Sick raising the dead Rabbi
[38:53] everybody was praising him but one day
[38:56] he said John 6 says things he said
[38:59] except you eat of My Flesh drink of my
[39:02] blood you have no path in me and that
[39:06] the all the Bible said they walk with
[39:09] him no more when he started what his
[39:12] Doctrine then he went back and said that
[39:14] even the son of man who is timing here
[39:16] now in heaven and then that was too much
[39:20] for them it was left it only was 12 and
[39:23] one of them also a devil and it was even
[39:26] far beyond that
[39:28] from there
[39:30] it wasn't long that they crucified him
[39:33] and the god of hosts Heaven that created
[39:36] heaven and earth
[39:37] and he looked like he was Masha because
[39:41] they spit on him
[39:43] they put this on his throne they did
[39:46] everything to him
[39:48] and
[39:49] even the moon stopped
[39:52] on him the Earth everything first took
[39:54] him
[39:56] even all disciples
[39:58] except John
[40:00] that was there at the last minute and
[40:03] everybody thought that was the end of
[40:06] him but that was a crowning of his
[40:10] ministry and he came back he got
[40:13] resurrected him on Easter day and when
[40:16] he was resurrected that was there was
[40:18] crowning of his ministry and he said
[40:20] that because I leave you shall also with
[40:23] God that he lives in us forever because
[40:26] he does not Calvary there was not going
[40:28] to be Resurrection you will never be you
[40:31] never go got a victory unless you go
[40:34] through the fall the Hall of critics you
[40:37] have to be criticized you have to be
[40:39] forsaken you have to be rejected all
[40:41] those things are part of Christian work
[40:43] but in the end if you stay through the
[40:46] word of God he will Crown you because
[40:48] it's the same yesterday today and
[40:51] forever amen and I trust trust me Paul
[40:55] also went through the same thing
[40:57] that's why you read from
[41:00] second Timothy here
[41:02] Dimas was a rich young man
[41:05] that Paul converted him
[41:08] but he went to a got to a place
[41:11] you have a lot of demons here do Braden
[41:14] what was happening is that
[41:17] he was looking at Paul because we
[41:20] checked the Bible said that even the
[41:23] shadows of Paul and Peter was casting
[41:25] out devils
[41:27] and he couldn't differentiate between
[41:30] the man Paul and the spirit behind Paul
[41:33] operating
[41:35] so he just look at man Paul
[41:38] demons falling away from him
[41:42] Paul Casino devils
[41:44] raising the dead healing their sick
[41:47] doing all kind of Ministries everything
[41:49] going on fire dancing of Paul and then
[41:52] he realized that a copasmate
[41:56] blind people blind eh
[41:58] then he saw copper Smith put Paul in
[42:01] prison and Paul couldn't say nothing and
[42:04] Paul was even telling Timothy to beware
[42:06] of him
[42:07] and then Paul having all this eye
[42:10] problem
[42:12] and he sought God
[42:14] and God said that my grace is sufficient
[42:17] and Paul said I will work suffer in my
[42:21] infirmities
[42:23] but they must
[42:26] think that
[42:28] Paul is the one that has the power
[42:31] he forgot that it was God that was
[42:34] operating in power
[42:36] and God can choose to heal today live
[42:40] this today is whether I do not unless I
[42:42] see what my father was shows me first so
[42:45] the minister Pastor Samurai then they
[42:47] can't do anything until God tells them
[42:49] what to do
[42:51] so you don't look at them and say oh
[42:53] they didn't come and visit me they
[42:56] didn't do this they did this and you
[42:57] blame them you blaming yourself because
[42:59] you're looking at wrong you're looking
[43:01] wrong if you want to find your fault
[43:03] you're gonna have a lot of force to find
[43:06] I think that was what demons was looking
[43:08] at because he was looking at Paul being
[43:11] so Pious and then now he can't do
[43:14] nothing he was Masha
[43:17] but listen it wasn't Paul it was Christ
[43:20] and Paul it was never something that can
[43:24] pick up a Jawbone and kill a thousand
[43:26] people it was spirit of God in Samson
[43:29] that does that it wasn't David it's a
[43:32] young man 10 15 16 17 years old can pick
[43:35] up this and get rid of Goliath how can
[43:38] he do that it's because God in David so
[43:41] the people forget who is behind it God
[43:44] is telling us not to look at the flesh
[43:46] look at the Spirit behind that flesh
[43:49] what is operating behind it if it is me
[43:52] I'll bear record of that I will
[43:55] vindicate it if it's God behind that
[43:58] thing he will Vindicated but not what
[44:01] people expect because when people they
[44:04] look only at the flesh they only look at
[44:06] the mistakes they only look at this oh
[44:08] he's off he's mashup no it's the crime
[44:11] of their ministry that's why if you read
[44:13] in feasibility power says that I am
[44:16] willing
[44:19] see if I can read that scripture again
[44:23] he said that where is your Victory
[44:25] because what he was what he was happy
[44:28] for being going that that place let me
[44:33] see what he said over here exactly I
[44:34] think I forgot exactly
[44:41] oh
[44:45] oh okay that's fine oh Dad where is that
[44:48] I think oh grave where is that Victory
[44:50] because he was ready and prepared
[44:53] to face the death because he knew it was
[44:56] crowning of his ministry
[45:00] and the Lord Jesus Christ had the crown
[45:03] of his ministry too and we can talk
[45:05] about the Daniel Cedric music Abednego
[45:09] they all
[45:11] came to that place
[45:14] Daniel was rejected by everybody he was
[45:18] forsaken
[45:19] and when that forsaken came they thought
[45:22] that was the end of Daniel and in Lion's
[45:25] Den but in that I understand that's
[45:28] where he has the Victory and after that
[45:30] the king what
[45:33] raise Daniela and said Daniel God is God
[45:36] and made a proclamation in the whole
[45:39] country that they should all worship
[45:41] Daniel's God because he is a true God
[45:46] so it's not the end
[45:48] of the people when the world call it
[45:53] their end it's not the end of God's
[45:56] children when they are being forsaken by
[46:00] the world Amen so let me read this
[46:02] before
[46:03] um
[46:04] I continue
[46:06] if you read before 1963
[46:09] Brad Brown was all talking about the
[46:11] demons he left and be a Christian a
[46:14] gentleman God was separating him from
[46:17] Paul but if you read the state 30123 he
[46:22] said all with Paul
[46:24] when the popular world
[46:26] Grace paragraph 215223
[46:31] or with Paul when the popular world
[46:34] loving Demas forsake Him
[46:37] for his Christian so-called breeding of
[46:39] their popular opinion when Paul stood on
[46:43] the word they must left him
[46:48] loving this present World let him
[46:52] because that he was true to the word
[46:55] it was too straight for him
[46:58] who was God with Dimas or will you go
[47:02] with Paul
[47:03] check the word what side will you take
[47:08] in your present State at that time
[47:12] yet them was professed Christians
[47:15] Paul said all men has forsaken me
[47:18] poor little guy always was Allah my
[47:22] doctor Edinburgh I said you know when I
[47:26] get up to heaven first thing I'm going
[47:28] to do
[47:29] I said what is it by the end
[47:32] he said I'm going to go right up to dim
[47:35] us and slap him the face as hard as I
[47:38] can
[47:40] I said now Eric
[47:43] is that I'm going to say why did you
[47:45] leave Paul down there like that
[47:48] I said you really think he'll be there
[47:52] Aaron I said be careful of your desires
[47:56] to slap him in the face
[47:58] ah
[48:00] I said I would want to be where he was
[48:02] at maybe she had to do with that
[48:06] like the Infidel said to the little girl
[48:09] he said you that believe the Bible says
[48:12] sure
[48:14] said I guess you believe that story
[48:16] about Jonas the whale swallowing up
[48:18] Jonah
[48:19] she says certainly
[48:21] said how are you going to prove it
[48:23] otherwise by faith
[48:25] said when I got to Heaven I'll ask Jonah
[48:29] that's right said what if Jonah is in
[48:32] there
[48:33] said then you will ask him
[48:36] so I guess that status and see yesterday
[48:39] he would have to ask him so you see then
[48:42] that settless it I believe then if he
[48:46] forsook Paul and forsook the word
[48:49] he done the same thing Judas did
[48:54] yes sir
[48:56] what side will you take
[48:58] in that place
[49:00] now listen Pentecostal what side will
[49:02] you take
[49:03] I've been wrecking this praise there and
[49:05] so forth now what will you take
[49:09] what side will you take there so it is
[49:12] very very important
[49:16] because
[49:17] in the church not the bride
[49:19] Brown said that life is choices
[49:23] you have to you can choose your
[49:26] education you can choose
[49:29] um your wife or whatever it is and you
[49:31] can choose your churches he said don't
[49:33] choose your church the way you choose
[49:36] your wife
[49:37] because churches have spirits
[49:41] so if God by Sovereign Grace revealed to
[49:45] you a Ministry that you have to be under
[49:49] don't make mistakes and criticize when
[49:54] you don't see things going on your way
[49:57] if God has revealed to you then you have
[50:01] to follow because just like look look
[50:04] saw the same thing Dimas was looking
[50:07] but everybody for soup
[50:09] poor but look stay true to Paul
[50:15] so it is
[50:17] a true man of God if God has revealed to
[50:22] you
[50:22] a Ministry to be under you have to stay
[50:26] true to that man to that word of God
[50:28] because if God if you are saying it it's
[50:32] your testimony that God has revealed
[50:35] this to me and if God has revealed
[50:37] you'll go back and change his way
[50:40] so you have to have confidence
[50:43] and stay behind that Ministry and
[50:46] support it
[50:48] around
[50:53] so you got to support it with all your
[50:55] mind all your soul everything behind and
[50:59] if you see you meet all those
[51:01] criticizing people you have to chop your
[51:03] head off
[51:04] defend your pastor defend the ministry
[51:07] don't let somebody come just like David
[51:09] when that man was speaking at this
[51:12] person who you allowed this with you
[51:13] then let me cut his head off from here
[51:15] you see what I mean he was faithful to
[51:17] David
[51:20] so God is trying to tell us to be
[51:22] faithful
[51:24] don't be like demons you don't want
[51:26] demonstrate in this church
[51:28] it criticized it only look at the person
[51:32] without looking at the Spirit behind
[51:35] operating because it's God operating and
[51:40] God can change things at any time he's a
[51:43] sovereign God he does what he wants to
[51:45] do so I know they just have to write
[51:48] amen because if you think about you're
[51:51] gonna go crazy brother Billy Paul was
[51:53] saying that one time two people came
[51:55] with Abraham would identify the same
[51:58] question he gave somebody
[52:01] permission to do it he didn't allow
[52:04] someone to do it is God is sovereign
[52:07] we don't follow people you follow Christ
[52:12] and we are different it comes back to me
[52:16] one time
[52:18] I went to one brother we are
[52:20] fellowshipping and he was bringing
[52:23] himself down because the angel of God
[52:25] told by Abraham to be more sincere yes
[52:28] that was The Measure of Faith according
[52:31] to Abraham's level
[52:33] so God gave it according the measure
[52:35] award faith and Grace so you have to be
[52:38] sincere according to your level you
[52:41] don't look at him as or even if all this
[52:44] God wants him to be faithful but God
[52:46] wants you to be a sincere in The Measure
[52:49] of Faith according to your level
[52:51] because give us a prophet
[52:54] so he was raised up that you are not a
[52:56] prophet so you are sincer maybe God is
[52:58] requiring from you it's not the same as
[53:00] he was requiring from the prophet of God
[53:03] but you have to be sincere because the
[53:06] scripture said that in last was a man's
[53:09] subject to like passion like we are but
[53:12] he was he prayed endlessly very
[53:15] sincerely and rain did not he set up
[53:18] Rain
[53:19] and also prayed and gained and what rain
[53:21] came so if Elijah was the man that have
[53:25] ups and downs
[53:26] but if you prayed endlessly and God
[53:30] answered the prayer the same God is here
[53:32] tonight
[53:33] whatever you have made of tonight you
[53:36] can right now sincerely ask God in your
[53:38] heart and I believe that same God that
[53:42] Elijah prayed to that same God is here
[53:44] tonight he will answer your need he will
[53:47] give you the desires of your heart hey
[53:49] thou can't believe if there is no doubt
[53:52] in your heart and say to this man to be
[53:55] die removed it will remove because you
[53:58] believe it there's if there's no doubt
[54:01] if you believe with all your heart and
[54:04] you are endlessly asking God
[54:06] he's more than able to what give you the
[54:10] desires of your heart
[54:12] and another person that also people
[54:15] thought that your Smasher Was Elijah
[54:19] it all goes back to God's sovereignty
[54:22] because Elijah shut up Heavens he didn't
[54:25] rain any rain he killed all those build
[54:29] prophets he said the god that let the
[54:32] fire comes let him be the God and their
[54:35] God they did all things they do
[54:38] everything Pampanga nothing happened but
[54:40] in the cool of the evening he called the
[54:43] names according to my word and father
[54:45] came and he got rid of he cut all those
[54:47] people's heart head off but when Jezebel
[54:51] that little woman was after him he ran
[54:54] for his life because why Elijah has no
[54:58] power on his own to make decisions God
[55:01] has to what inspired him and let him do
[55:04] what he was doing so at that time it was
[55:08] like his ministry was he and he went so
[55:11] down that he thought that everybody has
[55:13] forsaken God
[55:15] and only him was serving God and God has
[55:18] to tell me I have seven thousand
[55:20] worshiping in Elijah's street that was
[55:23] what like the end of his Minister he was
[55:26] forsaken
[55:27] the one thing you know after the
[55:30] Forsaken after all they left him God let
[55:33] what
[55:35] um the bed bring food to feed him
[55:38] after all that
[55:41] he led charot carry him for rest
[55:45] Elijah walked
[55:47] Enoch walk and walk with God and let
[55:50] very well they sorrowed took Elijah that
[55:53] was a crowning of his ministry
[55:57] so it's really the bride of Christ
[56:00] is the same God
[56:03] how many sins God call us how many
[56:06] people have come to this Zone left
[56:08] sometimes you talk to people and the
[56:12] things that they see that they're living
[56:14] and you wonder my goodness things that
[56:17] they say can never even cross your mind
[56:19] and they're based on little
[56:22] be returns and they left
[56:25] and they're gone
[56:27] by what the my spirit
[56:31] but what I'm right trying to say
[56:33] we're heading towards what
[56:38] we are inward towards the consummation
[56:41] the World Council of churches has done
[56:43] and the whole church is the whole the
[56:45] Christian World they have United already
[56:50] but that unification that God is talking
[56:52] about is not what they are doing because
[56:55] the Baptists have their Doctrine
[56:57] Pentecost have their Doctrine everybody
[57:00] have their Doctrine but they all
[57:02] compromise on their doctrines to be one
[57:05] but that Oneness is not what God is
[57:07] talking about that Oneness is God
[57:11] coming into you dwelling you as my
[57:13] father was the one he is one with the
[57:16] individual so God being one with the
[57:19] bride is that true Oneness that he was
[57:21] talking about and when you truly become
[57:24] one with God and God has fully dwell
[57:29] inside of you this world will hate you
[57:32] as well said they hate me if they hate
[57:35] me they will hate you they will not love
[57:38] you
[57:38] but you have to move on with your life
[57:42] because it's forsaking times that there
[57:44] has to be a falling away first
[57:48] then before everything will come so
[57:51] people are Falling Away left and right
[57:54] but what do you think is keeping you is
[57:58] the grace of God it comes back to the
[58:01] seed something keep on holding me is
[58:05] what God himself holding you protecting
[58:09] his attributes protecting himself
[58:11] through you because it's part of God in
[58:14] you that's why the scripture says that
[58:16] even if your heart condemns you God is
[58:19] greater than your heart and the Son of
[58:22] God cannot even what sin because the
[58:24] spirit of God dwelt in him you are part
[58:28] of him you are part of his attributes so
[58:31] you not hold anything against that
[58:33] attribute amen so is going home time
[58:37] and
[58:38] don't be don't let it become strange
[58:42] when
[58:44] you see all those things going on
[58:47] and then begin to reject and forsake us
[58:51] we are not gonna go down
[58:54] they can close this up but we are going
[58:56] up
[58:58] they can close they said they are
[59:00] growing up time because they're gonna be
[59:02] our what I have Triumph time it's our
[59:05] victories is the time of God vindicating
[59:08] the bride of Christ because in the time
[59:11] of Paul and the rest
[59:13] dying for getting themselves to be
[59:17] killed was
[59:19] their victory was their promise for that
[59:21] day that's why Paul because he
[59:25] was there and considered them to kill
[59:28] Stephen
[59:30] he also got to a place that he was
[59:32] willing to give his life

[1:05:06] is so good
[1:05:09] I'm gonna just run up right away and
[1:05:12] just run it up
[1:05:15] by just reading just one
[1:05:17] could okay this is the one that I was
[1:05:19] trying to talk about
[1:05:22] the same thing Paul the same thing Paul
[1:05:25] he said
[1:05:27] oh they must as forsake give me all men
[1:05:30] forsaking me for the word I don't
[1:05:32] believe they must went to night clubs
[1:05:33] and things but this must wanted to go
[1:05:36] Dimas was a rich man he wanted to give
[1:05:39] goal with a popular group and so he went
[1:05:42] off there where all the rest of them did
[1:05:45] and then posted all men has forsaken me
[1:05:49] why his ministry he was coming to the
[1:05:52] Capstone of eight coming down to the end
[1:05:56] his desire was that's what I was trying
[1:05:59] to his desire was to be a mightier
[1:06:02] because he had killed Stephen
[1:06:04] he witnessed his death and sanctioned it
[1:06:08] he wanted to die
[1:06:10] when the agabus that noted Prophet stood
[1:06:12] by him and told him not to go up to
[1:06:14] Jerusalem he said I know not to go but
[1:06:17] I'm not only willing to go to go and
[1:06:20] change and bound to Jerusalem but I'm
[1:06:23] ready to go and die for the Lord Jesus
[1:06:25] what was it he was sealing his ministry
[1:06:29] amen he was willing to die for Jesus are
[1:06:33] you willing to give your all to the Lord
[1:06:35] Jesus Christ the mic I'm just going to
[1:06:37] run up very soon are you willing to give
[1:06:40] everything to him
[1:06:41] as Paul was willing to give all to him
[1:06:45] Moses was the one became a prisoner to
[1:06:48] Christ
[1:06:49] he gave All to Jesus Christ
[1:06:52] and
[1:06:53] that is the absolute you can't have it
[1:06:58] any other way
[1:06:59] if they give all their all before they
[1:07:02] get in we have to give all our all
[1:07:04] before we get in you have a lot of
[1:07:08] Damascus because Moses
[1:07:11] was someone that God used him
[1:07:15] to do what 10 place
[1:07:18] they all witnessed that but when he got
[1:07:20] to the rest they were asked what
[1:07:24] were complaining they forgot all that
[1:07:27] God did all the Miracles everything they
[1:07:30] forgot it
[1:07:31] and they began to complain that God came
[1:07:35] back and Vindicated his servant Moses
[1:07:38] now it wasn't Moses who was doing that
[1:07:40] but God was behind that screen
[1:07:45] that was what daytime and Korah forgot
[1:07:50] they think that God can also speak to
[1:07:52] them
[1:07:53] because even this message has become
[1:07:55] what we called it's been prayed for all
[1:07:58] so everybody can pick up and do this and
[1:08:00] argue and that and it has a message
[1:08:03] inflated a lot of faith ministers
[1:08:06] who are not called even to be on the
[1:08:08] puppet but they are preaching because
[1:08:11] they think that they can intellectually
[1:08:13] analyze it and what bring it down preach
[1:08:16] but this is not intellectual this is God
[1:08:19] himself
[1:08:20] if God hasn't called you step there
[1:08:23] you're a dead man
[1:08:24] that same God is here that current
[1:08:27] daytime spirit because Moses God allow
[1:08:31] him to let his Spirit go on those 70
[1:08:33] people they think they like Moses so
[1:08:36] they were challenging Moses and God said
[1:08:38] separate me from them and one night the
[1:08:41] Earth opening swallowed all those
[1:08:43] criticized people
[1:08:45] so I encourage you people
[1:08:47] if from today onwards
[1:08:50] it goes even on the
[1:08:52] on the air if anything is going on I'm
[1:08:55] not 100 sure don't criticize it if you
[1:08:59] don't know brother I'm saying just keep
[1:09:01] your mouths shout and God will vindicate
[1:09:05] and make it claim
[1:09:07] it's better you keep quiet and follow
[1:09:10] than to criticize and get yourself in
[1:09:13] trouble
[1:09:15] that's what I have for tonight let's be
[1:09:18] careful words that we speak
[1:09:21] and stand behind what God has given to
[1:09:24] you
[1:09:25] and that's our pastor is changing to
[1:09:27] brother I encourage everyone
[1:09:29] to
[1:09:31] behind dining as the rest supporting our
[1:09:34] pastor that's why I'll see you tonight

[1:09:59] struck me there that he's going to
[1:10:02] vindicate
[1:10:04] the Bride of Jesus Christ to this world
[1:10:07] but before he does that
[1:10:09] he vindicates to you
[1:10:11] Who You Are
[1:10:12] right
[1:10:14] Moses and all those guys everybody he
[1:10:16] named he named I don't know how many but
[1:10:18] they all knew who they were because God
[1:10:21] Vindicated to them who they who they
[1:10:24] were and who it was that was moving
[1:10:25] behind him amen and I'm so glad that I
[1:10:27] can say I'm one of them
[1:10:29] that's as simple as it gets for me amen
[1:10:32] I'm one of them
