[0:00] have the supernatural element operating
[0:02] in it it's not in the church it's a
[0:04] large is that right it's a large God has
[0:08] to vindicate the promise of the hour and
[0:12] of the day praise the Lord hallelujah
[0:15] that's the way it is so we've got to
[0:17] Humble
[0:18] ourselves what we try to do as as soon
[0:22] as God gives us a little sh of Blessings
[0:24] Now listen to this because this can
[0:26] apply to the message that we are
[0:28] following amen he spoke this back there
[0:31] and now listen to it what we try to do
[0:36] is as soon as God gives us shower a
[0:39] little Showers of Blessings we try to
[0:42] twist it all
[0:44] up then we try to start getting
[0:47] dignitaries Among Us in there and start
[0:51] going to make themselves great
[0:54] [Music]
[0:56] big then they try to begin to outdo one
[1:01] another and then this one starts this
[1:05] way and the other one starts that way
[1:08] they're trying to make themselves
[1:09] differentiated from the other one to
[1:11] stand
[1:12] out then God leaves the whole
[1:16] thing what we need today is a fresh

[6:00] God has provided himself a
[6:03] sacrifice God has provided himself a
[6:06] predestinated people God has provided
[6:10] humble simple hearts in which he can
[6:13] dwell one of the prophets
[6:16] said I make thy altars to be my Nest oh
[6:21] Lord just like The Sparrows have made
[6:24] your altar their nest so I made your
[6:27] altar my nest David turns around and
[6:30] says I will dwell in the house of the
[6:34] Lord
[6:35] forever amen that's where I want to
[6:38] dwell in the
[6:40] house of the Lord forever and ever
[6:45] praise the Lord I want to wind begin to
[6:48] wind this up now um for tonight so far
[6:52] we know of course that there is meanings
[6:54] in words and in names right the word
[6:58] Bethlehem Beth means House El means god
[7:02] and elim means bread so bethle Bethlehem
[7:07] means the house of God's bread right so
[7:12] we know that Abraham's name had to be
[7:14] changed Sarah had to be changed Saul had
[7:18] to be changed to Paul and Simon had to
[7:21] be changed to Peter see all these things
[7:24] have meanings praise the name of the
[7:27] Lord so think of it that he who was the
[7:31] bread of life would be born where in
[7:36] bethleem the house of God's bread where
[7:39] do you get bread bread comes from the
[7:42] B is that right that's where it comes
[7:45] sowh else could he be born he had to be
[7:47] born in Bethlehem it was the bread
[7:50] center of the then then known world but
[7:54] it's fitting now that now he is born at
[7:57] the bread Center of eternal life praise
[8:00] God hallelujah he is our bread of life
[8:04] for the journey amen Israel had bread
[8:09] that came out of the skies for their
[8:11] Journey as they Journey from Egypt to
[8:14] their promis land bread rained down
[8:17] nightly and daily from the sky God gave
[8:21] us the bread of life for our journey to
[8:25] come to his Bethlehem God's house of
[8:28] bread he come to where his name was his
[8:32] house of bread they receive fresh bread
[8:35] every night coming down from heaven for
[8:37] their Journey but Christ today amen the
[8:40] revealed word of course amen is our uh
[8:45] is our bread of life and every day we
[8:49] are receiving
[8:52] freshness from that from Heaven the Holy
[8:57] Spirit himself coming down upon the
[9:00] believer revealing what the word fresh
[9:05] bread for every day for your life's
[9:09] journey yesterday's experience many of
[9:12] us live on yesterday's
[9:15] experience we must do that fresh
[9:19] experience every day a fresh Revelation
[9:23] you know what you can read this
[9:24] scripture the same scripture I just read
[9:27] to you today and tomorrow you decide to
[9:30] take up the same scripture and if for a
[9:32] thousand years you're still here you
[9:34] read the same scripture you can get
[9:37] another Revelation on top of that
[9:39] Revelation on top of that Revelation for
[9:42] a thousand more years and still not come
[9:44] the depths of that one scripture for
[9:46] that part that's is God part of God is
[9:49] that right the prop said all Revelation
[9:51] is
[9:52] comound it just keeps unfolding and
[9:56] unfolding all the time like that see but
[10:01] the
[10:01] denominations they are living off the
[10:04] experience of John
[10:06] Wesley you must not live in the past
[10:10] they were living upon the experience of
[10:12] Dwight Moody spinny sanki KN looking
[10:16] back at Calvin many of those back there
[10:20] they are living on that
[10:23] experience but remember the breath that
[10:27] fell and then after after it fell they
[10:30] tried to keep it over after a while that
[10:35] bread that come from God God
[10:38] contaminated Mups in it we talk the
[10:41] message
[10:42] now right here I'm just trying to show
[10:45] you what's going on right now they're
[10:48] trying to preserve the anointing that
[10:50] was on Malachi 45 that served its
[10:53] purpose and fresh bre is coming down now
[10:56] now remember it's not going to
[10:59] or some new Fantastic Revelation because
[11:02] every Prophet come and confirm the one
[11:04] before before before and they have to
[11:06] say what was said before is that right
[11:09] but it's coming down fresh from God out
[11:12] the heaven is that right so that's what
[11:14] we're looking at here remember that
[11:16] bread that fell they tried to keep it
[11:19] and preserve it over but it got
[11:23] contaminated Ms got into it Wile got
[11:26] into it that's what's the matter tell
[11:30] today we are trying to live on
[11:34] contaminated uh bread or bread on the
[11:38] past that was that is
[11:41] contaminated you must have something
[11:44] today fresh from Christ amen you must
[11:48] have his word today for this hour amen
[11:53] for he is the freshness Upon Our bread
[11:58] that falls down down everything from
[12:02] Heaven upon every
[12:05] believer he is your Bethlehem and just
[12:10] like the natural bread is the staff of
[12:12] Life Jesus Christ is God's staff of
[12:16] eternal life that comes down upon you
[12:18] every day amen see something had to die
[12:22] so you can eat you can live the better
[12:25] devil have to die you have to cut it
[12:28] down said the cow had to die so you can
[12:31] get the meat he says it's just a time
[12:34] that Christ had to die so that we all
[12:36] could live he died that we could live
[12:40] eternally something died naturally so
[12:43] you can sustain your life naturally
[12:45] something had to die that's Eternal not
[12:49] die Eternal but something that's Eternal
[12:51] had to die so you could have eternal
[12:54] life amen praise the Lord and so that
[12:56] you can live eternally amen so that's
[13:00] the way it is then every one of True
[13:03] Believers in Christ is born in Christ
[13:08] when they are born in Christ they are
[13:10] born in God's
[13:12] Bethlehem right here you can be born
[13:16] again in God's Bethlehem
[13:20] God's house of bread amen but the spirit
[13:25] reveals it the word shows it it's the
[13:27] manifestation of God God's word that we
[13:30] have life through Jesus Christ and him
[13:34] alone here in the lesson for tonight I
[13:37] trust that you will dwell in the house
[13:41] of God's bread forever and ever amen
[13:45] praise the Lord amen bu in
[13:49] Christ in the
[13:52] world said God is not going to judge the
[13:54] World by any church doctrine that they
[13:57] print up in the booklet says God is
[14:00] going to judge the World by his own word
[14:04] is that right Hallelujah and all that
[14:08] are in Christ will God bring with him
[14:12] who is Christ Christ is the word John
[14:15] one one in the beginning was the word
[14:17] word was with God and the Word was God
[14:18] and the word became flesh is that right

[14:24] as many as receive him then gave he the
[14:28] power to become the sons of God and all
[14:30] that are in Christ will God bring with
