[26:56] amen praise God
[26:58] glory to God so go ahead
[27:01] this evening we're going to be looking
[27:02] we're just going to continue along the
[27:04] thoughts of no more condemnation now
[27:08] we just want to just continue to
[27:12] um
[27:13] allow these Wednesday night services you
[27:16] know the way that I'm going to be led is
[27:18] you know Outreach I want to I feel led
[27:21] on my heart that you know that uh people
[27:23] need to know about God's love and grace
[27:26] and why this message has changed our
[27:29] lives and how that uh you know by
[27:32] understanding the word of God it can
[27:36] change everything you know when God
[27:38] gives faith and Revelation to new
[27:41] Believers it is a transforming time in
[27:44] their lives I remember you know the the
[27:47] first few uh months that the Lord
[27:51] started to unveil his word it it was
[27:54] life-changing and and it's a reality
[27:57] that each and every one of us must
[28:00] experience through the word of God it's
[28:02] how we know that we've come in contact
[28:04] with the Living God Amen praise God
[28:07] let's look at the scripture tonight
[28:10] we're looking from The Book of Genesis
[28:13] chapter 3 verses 7 to 13.
[28:16] and it reads here and the eyes of them
[28:18] both were opened and they knew that they
[28:21] were naked
[28:23] and they sold fig leaves together and
[28:25] made themselves aprons
[28:28] and they heard the voice of the Lord God
[28:30] Walking In The Garden in the cool of the
[28:33] day and Adam and his wife hid themselves
[28:36] from the presence of the Lord God
[28:38] amongst the Trees of the garden
[28:41] and the Lord called unto Adam and said
[28:44] unto him where art thou and he said I
[28:47] heard thy voice in the garden and I was
[28:51] afraid because I was naked and I hid
[28:54] myself and he said who told thee that
[28:57] thou was naked hast thou eaten of the
[29:00] tree whereof I commanded thee that thou
[29:03] shouldest not eat and the man said the
[29:06] woman whom thou gavest to be with me she
[29:10] gave me of the tree and I did eat and
[29:13] the Lord God said unto the woman what is
[29:16] this that thou has done and the woman
[29:19] said the serpent beguiled me and I did
[29:23] eat
[29:26] next scripture
[29:30] actually let's not go there just yet the
[29:32] Lord had his blessings to the word you
[29:34] may be seated
[29:35] we'll go there in a minute
[29:37] and Romans chapter 8 verse 1 says there
[29:41] is therefore now no condemnation to them
[29:45] which are in Christ Jesus who walk not
[29:48] after the flesh but after the spirit
[29:52] amen praise God when we look at the word
[29:55] condemnation just in simple definition
[29:58] it is the expression of a very strong
[30:02] disapproval
[30:04] censure
[30:06] there was example there was a strong
[30:08] International condemnation of the attack
[30:12] so condemnation is is a is a disapproval
[30:16] it's it's it's condemning it's placing a
[30:20] sentence on on an action or or things
[30:24] that are being done that are not
[30:26] pleasing
[30:28] and so
[30:30] the action and the opposite of that is
[30:33] praise
[30:35] the action of condemning someone to a
[30:37] punishment sentencing
[30:40] that's condemnation but the opposite is
[30:43] praise
[30:46] now I want to read
[30:48] um you know I came across uh CH Spurgeon
[30:53] he's a minister that goes back to the
[30:55] 1800s who wrote and preached many
[30:58] sermons and he delivered a sermon
[31:01] on
[31:02] August the 29th 1886.
[31:06] and it was in Christ no condemnation
[31:09] that was the title of it and I just want
[31:11] to bring some thoughts out of it that
[31:13] you know caught my attention that I
[31:15] thought wow you know and and so he says
[31:19] here our Apostle he's talking about Paul
[31:22] after having said so then with the mind
[31:26] I myself serve the law of God
[31:30] but with the flesh the law of sin
[31:34] goes on to say without any break there
[31:37] is therefore now no condemnation to
[31:40] those who are in Christ Jesus the fact
[31:44] that Believers are in a state
[31:48] of conflict the fact is
[31:51] that Believers are in a state of
[31:53] conflict
[31:55] Believers now he's what he's talking
[31:56] about this will caught my attention but
[31:58] not in a state of condemnation
[32:01] and that at the very time when the
[32:03] conflict is hottest the believer is
[32:07] still Justified
[32:09] still Justified
[32:11] the man who never strives against the
[32:15] sin which dwells in him
[32:17] who indeed is not conscious of any sin
[32:21] to strive against that is the man who
[32:24] may begin to question whether he knows
[32:27] anything at all about the spiritual life
[32:31] if you're a son or a daughter of God
[32:34] and you feel that conviction in your
[32:37] heart and you feel that that that that
[32:39] energy around you of condemnation
[32:43] the conflict is what really is taking
[32:46] place within your heart
[32:48] there's a conflict that you feel
[32:50] condemned and that's a good thing when
[32:53] you feel that conflict within you it
[32:55] shows that there's an actual
[32:57] representation in you there's that God
[33:00] is actually calling you that God is
[33:02] actually dealing with your life
[33:05] he who has no inward pain May well
[33:09] suspect that he is abiding in death
[33:13] abiding therefore under constant
[33:16] condemnation
[33:18] but the man who feels a daily striving
[33:21] after deliverance from Evil who is
[33:24] panting and pinning and longing and
[33:27] agonizing to become holy even as God is
[33:31] Holy he is the Justified man
[33:35] there's something in you there's a deep
[33:38] representation within you that strives
[33:41] to serve God to to please God it's it's
[33:44] a reality something real inside of you
[33:47] that that you're aware that con that
[33:49] that you're conscious that God is
[33:51] actually a reality you know that there's
[33:53] people out in the world that that are
[33:55] totally
[33:57] deny God that are totally unconscious
[33:59] that there is a God
[34:02] it's a scary thing
[34:04] but the but the man to whom every sin is
[34:08] a misery
[34:10] to whom every to whom even the thought
[34:13] of iniquity is intolerable he is the man
[34:16] who may with confidence declare there is
[34:19] therefore now no condemnation to those
[34:22] that are in Christ Jesus
[34:25] Souls that sigh for holiness
[34:27] are not condemned to Eternal death for
[34:30] their sign proves that they are in
[34:34] Christ
[34:35] they're thriving they're there there's a
[34:38] desire for God there's something in
[34:40] there
[34:42] he goes on to say I would say first of
[34:45] all
[34:45] that this verse contains a refutation of
[34:50] the old Serpent's gospel
[34:53] Satan
[34:56] he is the master of condemnation
[34:59] and he's also the master Deceiver
[35:03] there is a Serpent's gospel he's talking
[35:06] about this back in 1886 you say what is
[35:09] that
[35:10] it is another name for the gospel of
[35:13] modern thought
[35:15] that gospel which casts a doubt upon the
[35:19] threats of the law and even denies them
[35:22] all together
[35:23] Satan's gospel is one of
[35:27] just like he went and said it back in
[35:30] the Garden of Eden as God said
[35:33] questioning
[35:34] questioning the word of God
[35:37] trying to make you come under a
[35:41] an understanding that you don't even
[35:43] need God you don't even need
[35:45] to serve God
[35:46] you can create your own life you can
[35:49] create your own existence you don't have
[35:51] to worry about a hell
[35:53] there is no hell there is no Heaven this
[35:56] is what he'll tell the unbeliever
[35:59] even denies them altogether quote the
[36:02] first few words of the text and stop
[36:04] there and this false gospel is before
[36:06] you there is therefore now no
[36:10] condemnation
[36:11] the serpent promulgated this gospel in
[36:15] the Garden of Eden when he said You
[36:17] shall not surely die
[36:20] he was denying the word of God
[36:22] with what greediness our first parents
[36:25] received that highly Advanced teaching
[36:28] which contradicted the Declaration of
[36:31] God which said You shall surely die
[36:35] the doctrine of no punishment for any
[36:38] man is popular at this day now he's
[36:41] talking back in 1986 or 1886
[36:45] and then he goes on to say and threatens
[36:48] to have even greater Sway in the future
[36:51] are we living in a in an age where
[36:54] anything goes
[36:56] we're living in under a new age teaching
[36:59] that you don't need to have an absolute
[37:02] you don't need to put Jesus Christ as
[37:05] your lord
[37:07] God is in you the universe the the the
[37:10] the the universal intelligence is
[37:12] operating and you're a part of that
[37:14] universe and all you need to do is
[37:16] become conscious of your yourself as
[37:19] part of that universe and that you are
[37:21] you Jesus was just somebody that
[37:24] mastered himself here on the earth you
[37:27] can achieve the same thing you can be
[37:29] just like God that was Satan's lie right
[37:32] from the beginning
[37:35] the doctrine of no punishment
[37:39] and generally it comes in the Serpent's
[37:42] favorite form of honest doubt yes has
[37:47] God said
[37:48] you know his way of you know listen this
[37:51] is the most deceiving age that you will
[37:54] ever experience that's the age that
[37:57] we're in right now
[37:58] and the Bible says it'd be so deceiving
[38:00] it would deceive even the very elect
[38:03] that means the Sons and Daughters of God
[38:06] that it would even deceive them if it
[38:09] were possible that's how deceiving it is
[38:13] can it be so he says is he not far too
[38:17] merciful is it possible that a god of
[38:20] love should condemn and punish his
[38:23] creatures
[38:26] the denial of the penalty attached to
[38:29] sin comes out in different ways but when
[38:33] put into a nutshell it amounts to this
[38:36] there is therefore now no condemnation
[38:40] to any man however he may live
[38:44] that's Satan's gospel
[38:46] there's no listen you can live any way
[38:48] you want you can you don't have to come
[38:50] under any condemnation that you know
[38:52] you're there's no hell when you die
[38:55] you're just going to go to a grave and
[38:57] you know your soul you're just going to
[38:59] start over again they've got all kinds
[39:01] of different teachings out there
[39:04] but he says here
[39:06] some teach that you may live in sin and
[39:10] die in penitent without repentance
[39:14] but it will not matter for at death that
[39:17] is the end of you the soul is not
[39:19] immortal
[39:22] and that has a lot of Truth
[39:25] to the unbeliever
[39:27] because if you're not a seed attribute
[39:29] of God if you're not a son of God there
[39:32] listen the Bible talks about the
[39:34] children of God and the children of this
[39:37] world
[39:39] there are people that had a beginning
[39:42] and they will have an end their soul had
[39:45] a beginning it will have an end
[39:47] but then the Sons and Daughters of God
[39:50] never had a beginning
[39:52] because they come from God
[39:54] they will never end they are immortal
[39:57] amen praise God so if Paul had only
[40:01] stopped
[40:02] when he had got as far as there is now
[40:06] no condemnation
[40:08] listen what he says here every drunkard
[40:11] and swearer and whoremonger would have
[40:13] cried Bravo apostle that is the gospel
[40:17] for us
[40:20] now you speak like a man of thought you
[40:23] have broken loose from the horrible old
[40:26] doctrine of Jesus of Nazareth and have
[40:28] found for us a larger hope hooray for
[40:32] Paul he is in advance of his age he is
[40:35] the man for the times
[40:39] what an hour that we're living in
[40:42] do you know that there's that that the
[40:45] world is just in a condition where
[40:47] there's no consciousness of God there's
[40:49] no uh
[40:51] desire to serve God
[40:54] people are not attending church services
[40:57] like they did in the past especially the
[41:00] new generation
[41:01] you talk about church and and it's it's
[41:04] like foreign to them
[41:06] they think what are you doing that for
[41:08] you know why do you have to feel like
[41:11] you need to be a part of something and
[41:13] why do you need to make God the Lord
[41:16] Jesus your absolute
[41:18] we don't need to do that
[41:21] it's Who We Are
[41:22] you can never be anything more than what
[41:25] you are
[41:26] if you're an attribute of God and the
[41:28] word of God comes to you in your day
[41:30] you're going to awaken to the word of
[41:32] God you're going to respond to that word
[41:34] you can't help it because it's it's a
[41:37] deep call to the Deep it's it's a call
[41:39] Jesus when Jesus was on the earth it's a
[41:42] proven fact when Jesus was on the earth
[41:44] he didn't have thousands and thousands
[41:46] of followers that were following after
[41:48] him yes he drew crowds but he drew the
[41:51] crowds because of the signs and the
[41:53] Wonders and because the people wanted to
[41:56] be healed
[41:58] but the Sons and Daughters of God that
[42:01] recognize the word of God it went much
[42:03] beyond that
[42:06] but what we need to see here from our
[42:08] scripture that we read is that Adam and
[42:11] Eve sinned in the Garden of Eden and God
[42:14] pronounced a condemnation on the serpent
[42:18] Adam and Eve
[42:21] that's where all of this originated
[42:23] because there is a penalty for sin
[42:26] and God said if you eat of that tree you
[42:29] shall surely die and God could not go
[42:32] back on his word
[42:34] So Adam and Eve they were handed down a
[42:37] condemnation sentence and it was handed
[42:39] down not just to Adam and Eve but to the
[42:41] whole human race
[42:43] everybody would now come under that
[42:46] condemnation
[42:47] that they're born in this world and
[42:50] they're actually born in sin and if
[42:52] you're in sin you're under condemnation
[42:55] because condemnation is a penalty being
[42:59] pronounced on you as an individual
[43:02] so if you're born in sin
[43:05] shaped in iniquity you're speaking lies
[43:08] being brought up in this world then
[43:11] there has to be a formula an antidote
[43:13] that brings you out of that sentence of
[43:16] condemnation
[43:18] and so God knew
[43:21] God knew that that this would happen
[43:23] because he like you know she now we got
[43:25] to go back into the mind of God and
[43:27] we've got to see the whole plan of God
[43:28] you see that's why this this serving of
[43:32] the Lord Jesus and serving God the
[43:35] reason as a son and a daughter of God
[43:37] and you as a Christian that that belongs
[43:39] to to a local body and serves god with
[43:42] passion is because God has revealed to
[43:45] you his mind
[43:46] God is made known to you his plan from
[43:50] before the foundations of the world
[43:52] do you know that that changes everything
[43:55] I remember when when when when I started
[43:58] to see that God had a plan for me that
[44:02] was way before I was a sinner
[44:06] way before I had made all my mistakes
[44:10] he said while you were yet sinning I
[44:13] loved you
[44:15] that and then and then and then he
[44:18] starts to show that hey you were
[44:19] actually with me before the foundations
[44:21] of the world
[44:22] it literally changed my whole experience
[44:26] my whole passion my whole desire
[44:28] something happened that changed from
[44:32] being a nominal Christian an unbeliever
[44:35] somebody that would go to church maybe
[44:38] once a year maybe attend a church
[44:40] because it was a wedding
[44:43] and just happened to go to the church
[44:45] and then wonder whether I should go up
[44:48] and you know eat the bread or not you
[44:50] know because I knew the way that I was
[44:52] living
[44:53] that's the way
[44:55] Christianity
[44:57] was interpreted to me at that time and
[44:59] I'm sure to a lot of you you had no idea
[45:03] that there was a living God you thought
[45:06] you heard you read but you had no idea
[45:10] until he revealed it to you personally
[45:13] gave you an understanding of his
[45:15] thoughts from before the foundations of
[45:17] the world and so God wanted to be a
[45:21] Healer he wanted to be a savior he
[45:23] wanted to be a redeemer so God knew that
[45:26] there would be man that would fall
[45:30] and so he already had a plan in the back
[45:33] of his mind that he was gonna he was
[45:35] gonna make a way for his children to
[45:37] come back
[45:39] and so when we look at this story here
[45:42] of Adam and Eve in the garden this
[45:44] recount of what actually happened
[45:47] in Genesis 3 21 unto Adam also and to
[45:52] his wife did the Lord God make coats of
[45:55] skins and clothe them why did God do
[45:58] that see first of all Adam and Adam and
[46:01] Eve how all of a sudden were they under
[46:03] condemnation
[46:06] they were under condemnation because
[46:09] they knew that they had disobeyed God
[46:11] why did they have to go cover themselves
[46:15] why did they know that they were naked
[46:17] because they had disbelieved the word of
[46:21] God they had done what God told them not
[46:23] to do and they became conscious of sin
[46:28] and when you as an individual you know
[46:30] you're a human being you're still
[46:32] walking in this flesh and you're still
[46:34] human
[46:36] you're going to make mistakes
[46:38] and you're going to fall into situations
[46:41] where you're going to come under
[46:42] condemnation
[46:44] but not if you're in Christ
[46:47] you see that's the difference
[46:49] not if you can get an understanding and
[46:52] a revelation of God's plan for your life
[46:54] and to know that you are Justified as
[46:58] though you never sinned in the first
[46:59] place
[47:03] so God was showing when he made those
[47:06] coats of skins God was showing that
[47:09] there was going to be a sacrifice
[47:11] because in order for God to get those
[47:13] animal skins he needed to sacrifice
[47:16] those animals he was showing that there
[47:18] would be a covering for their sin
[47:20] he was showing and that's why in Israel
[47:23] you know all the way through the Old
[47:25] Testament they would take a a lamb and
[47:28] they would and they would they they
[47:29] would kill the lamb and that lamb would
[47:31] be the covering for their sin but it was
[47:34] not enough to take away their sin
[47:38] but what we're drawing from this is that
[47:41] God was showing that he had a plan
[47:45] now
[47:47] let's go to the next scripture reading
[47:50] we want to understand this because we're
[47:52] doing Bible study here tonight we want
[47:55] to look at this in Romans chapter 5
[47:57] verses 12 to 15
[47:59] it says wherefore as by one man sin
[48:03] entered into the world
[48:05] and death by sin and so death passed
[48:08] upon all men for that all have sinned we
[48:12] just talked about it was the sin of Adam
[48:13] and Eve in the Garden of Eden it was
[48:16] that original sin that brought about a
[48:19] complete sentence of condemnation and
[48:23] death to all mankind
[48:27] for until the law sin was in the world
[48:32] but sin is not imputed when there is no
[48:35] law so God had to put a penalty on the
[48:39] law on on the sin
[48:42] but nevertheless death reigned from Adam
[48:46] to Moses even over them that had not
[48:50] sinned after the similitude of Adam's
[48:53] transgression
[48:55] so regardless
[48:56] people want to say oh I don't you know I
[49:00] live good I I'm not bad I've you know I
[49:03] hear people I never killed anybody
[49:05] yeah you may not have you know actually
[49:09] killed somebody by murdering them
[49:10] physically but you know that if you say
[49:13] one thing against somebody
[49:15] you're killing them
[49:17] it's sin it's unbelief
[49:20] it's you know you cannot justify you
[49:23] cannot be justified by your own Works
[49:25] never can you ever be justified by by
[49:29] you know you listen when the cop pulls
[49:31] you over and you you know you're doing
[49:33] 130 kilometers an hour and it's a
[49:36] hundred kilometers and he pulls you over
[49:38] and he says do you know you were doing
[49:39] 130 kilometers an hour
[49:41] the most foolish thing for you to do is
[49:44] to turn around and say no I wasn't
[49:47] are you sure meanwhile you look down at
[49:49] your Speedo when you saw that cop and
[49:52] you looked down and you've seen 130 and
[49:54] you said I'm done
[49:57] but
[49:58] the most foolish thing to do is to deny
[50:00] it
[50:04] I laughed because I remember back in the
[50:06] days I said are you sure
[50:09] you that was my car that you that you
[50:11] clocked oh yeah that was your car I
[50:13] clocked
[50:17] but nevertheless that's the law and
[50:20] there's a penalty when you break the law
[50:24] even okay so
[50:26] um Adam's friend who is the figure of
[50:28] him that was to come
[50:31] but not
[50:33] as the offense so also
[50:37] is the free gift for if through the
[50:40] offense of one many be dead much more
[50:44] the grace of God and the gift of Grace
[50:47] which is by one man Jesus Christ hath
[50:51] abound unto many
[50:53] next slide and not as it was by one that
[50:58] sinned so is the gift
[51:01] for the Judgment was by one to
[51:03] condemnation but the free gift is of
[51:07] many offenses unto justification so God
[51:11] was saying it's not just one sin listen
[51:14] it's not you're this this sacrifice
[51:18] this it it it it covers it all
[51:22] it takes it takes it to the point of
[51:24] justification and we know that that you
[51:27] know justification is as though you
[51:29] never did it in the first place
[51:31] for If by one man's offense death
[51:34] reigned by one
[51:37] much more they which received abundance
[51:41] of Grace and of the gift of
[51:44] righteousness shall reign in life by one
[51:47] Jesus Christ
[51:50] Hallelujah glory to God it was listen
[51:53] that's why you know people want to deny
[51:55] the Lord Jesus Christ people don't
[51:57] realize the Plan of Redemption
[52:00] you know believe on the Lord Jesus
[52:02] Christ you shall be saved you know
[52:04] people don't understand the power of
[52:06] that statement
[52:07] but it has to be revealed to the
[52:10] individual it has to be revealed to them
[52:12] that that that you're you're born in sin
[52:16] without the new birth there's just no
[52:18] way to get back to to make it to heaven
[52:21] to to escape the the condemnation and
[52:25] and the hell that goes beyond this
[52:28] Dimension when you die without Jesus
[52:31] Christ in your life
[52:35] glory to God even so by the
[52:38] righteousness for as by one man's
[52:41] Disobedience many were made Sinners so
[52:44] by The Obedience of one shall many be
[52:48] made righteous moreover the law entered
[52:51] that the offense might abound but where
[52:55] sin abounded Grace did much more abound
[52:59] aren't you glad for Grace
[53:02] aren't you thankful that the grace of
[53:04] God came into your life hallelujah
[53:07] praise God forevermore
[53:09] thank you Jesus aren't you glad that you
[53:12] know that that God came to meet you one
[53:15] day you were you know you were living a
[53:17] life and you you were standing by a well
[53:20] or you were standing you know inside a
[53:22] bar somewhere or you were you you were
[53:24] at a point in your life where you just
[53:26] didn't know which way to turn aren't you
[53:28] glad that God decided to come and visit
[53:31] you and and and and transform your life
[53:34] and turn it into another Direction
[53:37] let's read a story here back in an
[53:40] account here back in in Saint John
[53:42] chapter 8.
[53:44] I want you to notice this is this is
[53:46] God's intention this is what's in the
[53:49] heart of God Amen
[53:51] glory to God
[53:53] you know first of all I want to read um
[53:55] Saint John
[53:58] 3
[53:59] 16 to 19 and then we're going to go to
[54:01] chapter eight for God so loved the world
[54:04] that he gave his only begotten son that
[54:07] whosoever believed in him should not
[54:09] perish but have everlasting life we've
[54:12] heard that that that
[54:14] scripture we've seen it written all over
[54:16] on the roads on signs and everything
[54:19] else but let me tell you for God sent
[54:21] not his son into the world to condemn
[54:24] the world he didn't send Jesus Christ to
[54:28] condemn the world a lot of people you
[54:30] know when when you talk about the Lord
[54:32] when you talk about Jesus Christ you
[54:34] need to receive him they they feel like
[54:36] that that that they're being condemned
[54:39] because of the life that they're living
[54:41] but when they come to know him in in the
[54:44] purpose and the reason why he's making
[54:46] himself known to them is because he
[54:48] wants to set them free from that
[54:50] condemnation he wants to liberate them
[54:52] from that life he wants to set them free
[54:55] from that addiction he wants to set them
[54:58] free from that that suicide spirit that
[55:01] constantly tries to oppress them and and
[55:04] cause them to give up on life amen
[55:07] praise God he didn't come into the world
[55:09] to condemn the world but that the world
[55:11] through him might be saved he believed
[55:15] on him he that believeth on him is not
[55:18] condemned
[55:20] if you believe you're not condemned but
[55:23] he that believeth not is already
[55:25] condemned when somebody says to me I
[55:28] don't believe I don't care what you tell
[55:30] me about the Lord Jesus I don't believe
[55:32] it what they're declaring is that they
[55:35] are condemned
[55:38] to a life
[55:39] that
[55:40] is not going to be long-term
[55:43] is not going to be good they might have
[55:45] a short-term life here on Earth and you
[55:47] know because even the even the wicked
[55:49] will prosper so don't look at it you
[55:51] know like I've talked to many many
[55:53] people that are very very wealthy and
[55:55] they're living lives that
[55:57] there's just you know there's just all
[56:00] sin with other women thinking they can
[56:03] live any way they want they got the
[56:05] money to do this do that and do whatever
[56:07] they want and that is the life and and
[56:09] when you talk about God they uh they
[56:12] don't really want to know why because
[56:15] they can't accept him
[56:17] there's nothing in there that's
[56:20] representing God there wasn't something
[56:23] there from before the foundations of the
[56:25] world that would respond to the word of
[56:28] God Jesus said all that the father hath
[56:32] given me will come
[56:34] all that the father hath given that
[56:36] means there's only so many those whose
[56:39] names were written in the Lamb's Book of
[56:41] Life from before the foundations of the
[56:44] world
[56:44] so God has people here on this Earth
[56:48] that are able to respond to the word of
[56:50] God and come out of their sentence of
[56:53] condemnation
[56:56] already because he hath not believed in
[57:01] the name of the only begotten son of God
[57:05] and this is and I'll listen here
[57:08] listen he's making it clear here and
[57:11] this is the condemnation
[57:13] that light is come into the world
[57:16] and Men loved Darkness rather than light
[57:20] because their deeds were evil
[57:23] wasn't that what I just described about
[57:24] the rich you know where they can live
[57:26] any way they want they're so wealthy
[57:28] they can I'm oh honey I'm going on a
[57:30] business trip and they're down in Las
[57:32] Vegas and they've got all kinds of plans
[57:35] they're not there to just go and Gamble
[57:38] they're there to live any way they want
[57:40] so that they can fulfill their their
[57:43] lusts and their desires of the flesh
[57:46] but yet they're living in darkness
[57:49] and when light comes they reject that
[57:51] light
[57:53] it's just the way it is so don't expect
[57:55] that everybody's going to receive this
[57:57] light
[57:58] and the light for this day is the
[58:00] message of this hour
[58:03] because we're living in a day where
[58:05] people have created their own religion
[58:08] people have put their own interpretation
[58:10] on God people want to live the way they
[58:13] want to live and when you come to them
[58:15] and you declare that that there's a
[58:17] message in this day that Jesus Christ is
[58:20] present that he's here on Earth he's
[58:23] come back again people are waiting for
[58:25] him to come back guess what he's already
[58:27] here
[58:29] he's living in individuals that have
[58:33] received his word he said on that day ye
[58:36] shall know that I am in the father he
[58:38] and me and I in you
[58:41] this is that day
[58:43] this is that hour
[58:45] we are the ones that are going to
[58:47] fulfill the Rapture the the the the
[58:50] supernatural catching away of the of the
[58:53] church the real true church there's
[58:55] going to be a quickening power but the
[58:57] scripture says if the Same Spirit the
[59:00] holy spirit that raised Christ from the
[59:04] dead dwell in you it is going to Quicken
[59:07] it is going to speed up your atoms and
[59:09] your molecules to where you will be
[59:12] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[59:14] an eye you are the ones that God has
[59:16] chosen to fulfill that portion of
[59:18] scripture
[59:20] and we are declaring that message in
[59:22] this day and in this hour because the
[59:25] world is going into chaos
[59:27] somebody tell me that this world is not
[59:29] going into chaos when the world right
[59:31] now is it's burning like an oven it's
[59:33] heating up there's temperatures in the
[59:35] oceans that they have never experienced
[59:39] but in Malachi it says that this Earth
[59:41] shall burn as an oven
[59:42] that things will change that the climate
[59:45] change all these things people want to
[59:47] put it off as oh well man has done it
[59:49] man has you know yes it's a result of
[59:52] sin it's a result of the doings of man
[59:55] but God saw it from before the
[59:58] foundations of the world
[59:59] God saw that the world would go into
[1:00:01] that condition God knew that it had to
[1:00:04] go into that condition because he had a
[1:00:06] scripture that was that was ordained for
[1:00:09] this day and for this hour that says in
[1:00:12] a moment and in the twinkling of an eye
[1:00:13] you shall be changed
[1:00:16] you shall be changed in your mortal body
[1:00:19] shall put on immortality
[1:00:23] glory to God blessed be the name of the
[1:00:26] Lord
[1:00:27] so the Lord knew that we would be in
[1:00:30] this Dimension the Lord knew that we
[1:00:32] would be in this age the Lord knew that
[1:00:34] we would have to face the greatest
[1:00:36] battles ever fought
[1:00:38] and right now saints of God there's
[1:00:40] never been a time where mental
[1:00:42] oppression has been to the height that
[1:00:45] it's at where mental health is becoming
[1:00:49] a pandemic here on this Earth
[1:00:52] people are losing their minds people are
[1:00:55] are are completely going off the rock or
[1:00:57] they can't handle the pressure of this
[1:00:59] life
[1:01:00] social media and the amount of of
[1:01:03] information that is being constantly
[1:01:06] bombarded into the minds of the people
[1:01:08] they can't take it they're blowing up
[1:01:10] they can't take it but God has ordained
[1:01:13] you to take it

[1:01:17] attribute in you that can meet the
[1:01:20] challenges of this day so don't you fear

[1:01:34] return unto me void
[1:01:37] and you're a part of that word
[1:01:39] this is the Mind age this is the age

[1:02:42] that the world is falling apart we know
[1:02:44] that the men's hearts are failing for
[1:02:47] fear
[1:02:48] the minds of the people are exploding
[1:02:50] they can't take the pressure hallelujah
[1:02:53] praise God but aren't you glad that God
[1:02:56] knew you God knew that he had to come
[1:03:00] and meet your need
[1:03:02] here in chapter 8 of Saint John Jesus
[1:03:05] went unto the Mount of Olives and early
[1:03:07] in the morning he came again into the
[1:03:10] temple and all the people came unto him
[1:03:12] and he sat down and taught them and the
[1:03:15] scribes and the Pharisees brought unto
[1:03:18] him a woman taken in adultery and when
[1:03:21] they had set her in the midst they say
[1:03:24] unto him Master this woman was taken in
[1:03:28] adultery in the very Act
[1:03:32] now Moses in the law commanded us that
[1:03:35] such should be stoned but what sayeth
[1:03:38] thou here was the Lord himself
[1:03:42] he had written the word he had given
[1:03:44] Moses the laws
[1:03:46] he had he had given Moses the laws of
[1:03:48] the word what what was to be done and
[1:03:50] how things were to be dealt with
[1:03:52] but what the world did not recognize was
[1:03:55] that Grace had come to the Earth
[1:03:59] it's not by works that you are saved
[1:04:03] it's by the grace of God it's by God's
[1:04:06] grace that your name was written there
[1:04:08] that you were there with God that you
[1:04:10] were a thought Inside the Mind Of God
[1:04:13] that was an eternal thought
[1:04:15] it's not because you you deserve
[1:04:18] anything it's not because you did
[1:04:19] anything good
[1:04:21] she she was caught in a life just like
[1:04:24] the woman at the well she was living a a
[1:04:27] life of sin and unbelief but listen here
[1:04:30] then this they say
[1:04:33] this they said tempting him that they
[1:04:37] might have to accuse him but Jesus
[1:04:40] stooped down and with his fingers wrote
[1:04:43] on the ground as though he heard them
[1:04:45] not
[1:04:47] so when they continued asking him he
[1:04:49] lifted up himself and said unto them he
[1:04:52] that is without sin
[1:04:55] amongst you let him first cast a stone
[1:04:58] at her
[1:05:00] and again he stooped down
[1:05:02] and continued doing what he was doing
[1:05:05] and wrote on the ground and they which
[1:05:07] heard it being convicted by their own
[1:05:10] conscience
[1:05:12] Oh Glory to God when out one by one
[1:05:18] they realized that they had to face
[1:05:23] their own truth
[1:05:25] oh there's a lot of Hypocrites out there
[1:05:27] let me tell you
[1:05:28] but when the word himself comes
[1:05:31] just like when he came to you
[1:05:34] there was a different kind of conviction
[1:05:36] in your heart
[1:05:37] there was a there was a conviction to
[1:05:40] repent there was a conviction to to
[1:05:42] submit there was a conviction in your
[1:05:44] heart that God was a reality that you
[1:05:46] didn't want to continue living the way
[1:05:48] that you were living you didn't want to
[1:05:50] continue going down that road anymore
[1:05:53] and God supernaturally made a way for
[1:05:55] you to come out of that he's still doing
[1:05:58] it today
[1:05:59] he's still able to take you out of that
[1:06:02] condition pull you out of that
[1:06:04] circumstance give you life give you life
[1:06:07] abundant give you Joy you know that
[1:06:10] there's joy that comes with salvation
[1:06:13] sometimes you lose the joy of your
[1:06:15] salvation because sin starts to take
[1:06:17] control of your mind and you start to
[1:06:20] lose who you really are but you need to
[1:06:22] come back to the ABCs of God's word and
[1:06:26] seek him in prayer Glory to God but
[1:06:28] listen so when
[1:06:31] uh though uh so here now and again he
[1:06:33] stooped down and wrote on the ground and
[1:06:36] they and they which heard it being
[1:06:38] convicted by their own conscience went
[1:06:40] out one by one beginning at the oldest
[1:06:43] even unto the last and Jesus was left
[1:06:46] alone and the woman standing in the
[1:06:49] midst and when Jesus had lifted up
[1:06:52] himself and saw none but the woman he
[1:06:56] said unto her woman
[1:06:58] where are those thine accusers
[1:07:03] hath no man condemned thee
[1:07:08] see something had taken place right
[1:07:11] there
[1:07:12] she he was revealing something in
[1:07:16] advance that there was going to be an
[1:07:18] antidote to that condemnation and that
[1:07:21] he was that antidote and look what he
[1:07:24] says and she said no man Lord see she
[1:07:28] recognized who she was she called him
[1:07:30] Lord
[1:07:32] she she had come into a realization that
[1:07:35] she was not just in the presence of some
[1:07:37] some master teacher some just uh you
[1:07:41] know other priest or some heretic she
[1:07:44] was in the presence of the Lord she
[1:07:46] became conscious of God that's what
[1:07:49] takes place in the lives of every son
[1:07:52] and daughter of God when they hear the
[1:07:54] word in the sincerity and the word for
[1:07:57] their day for this day for this hour
[1:07:59] Jesus Christ for now Jesus Christ
[1:08:02] himself in this day and in this hour he
[1:08:05] changes things
[1:08:07] hallelujah it's a reality people know
[1:08:10] that you've been with God people know
[1:08:12] that Christ has changed your life people
[1:08:14] see there's a difference in your in in
[1:08:17] the tone of your voice in the passion
[1:08:19] and how you speak about the Lord
[1:08:22] Hallelujah so she had come to realize
[1:08:25] and she called him Lord
[1:08:27] glory to God Amen
[1:08:31] and Jesus said unto her neither do I
[1:08:36] condemn thee go and sin no more
[1:08:41] Hallelujah glory to God Amen praise God
[1:08:45] I'll tell you there's nothing like being
[1:08:47] set free from sin
[1:08:50] I'll tell you right there and then God
[1:08:52] spoke and when he spoke he placed Faith
[1:08:55] right into her heart he revealed to her
[1:08:58] when he said neither do I condemn thee
[1:09:01] he was saying I am the Lord I have come
[1:09:04] for you I came to redeem you all that
[1:09:07] was being revealed to her by Revelation
[1:09:10] and he said he says go sin no more just
[1:09:13] like he told the the woman at the well
[1:09:16] he told them who he was she came to
[1:09:19] realize my God this is the Messiah she
[1:09:22] had a real genuine conversion and God is
[1:09:26] still doing genuine conversions in this
[1:09:29] day and in this hour and we're to look
[1:09:31] for genuine conversions we're not
[1:09:33] looking to just get people excited about
[1:09:36] Jesus Christ they need to know him in
[1:09:38] the power of his resurrection because
[1:09:41] when they know him in that kind of a
[1:09:43] resurrected power they come to realize
[1:09:45] that their sin is truly God that they
[1:09:49] don't need to be you know people say oh
[1:09:51] Danny I want to come to church maybe
[1:09:53] next year I'll come I said what are you
[1:09:55] wait until next year for well I got a
[1:09:57] lot of things I got to clean up
[1:10:00] I said no no you need to come to church
[1:10:02] and let him clean it up for you
[1:10:05] you that's too that's too hard I try I
[1:10:09] thought maybe I would have to do I
[1:10:10] didn't even understand it but when he
[1:10:12] called me all I knew is that I needed
[1:10:14] help and so I decided to go there and I
[1:10:17] was under such an addiction on drugs and
[1:10:19] that when God delivered me from that
[1:10:21] there was nothing that I did
[1:10:24] I didn't have to do anything but believe
[1:10:26] the word of God all I knew was that I
[1:10:28] that God could do it
[1:10:30] once you've become conscious of God and
[1:10:33] the reality of God you know that there's
[1:10:36] nothing difficult for God
[1:10:39] he can do it God if he opens the blinded
[1:10:41] eyes he raised the he raised the
[1:10:44] Dead
[1:10:45] Eagle he he can do absolutely anything
[1:10:49] what all of a sudden he what he can't
[1:10:51] heal your sickness but your sickness is
[1:10:54] different from the one when Jesus was on
[1:10:56] Earth it's the same devil cancer is the
[1:10:59] Same Spirit back there that was back
[1:11:01] there he's the same one here today and
[1:11:04] God is the same God today as he was back
[1:11:07] there
[1:11:08] and if there's anything that you need
[1:11:10] that God has to take out of your life
[1:11:13] he'll do it in due season
[1:11:15] [Music]
[1:11:16] because that's his word
[1:11:18] his word cannot return void and God
[1:11:21] needs to use you for a purpose then
[1:11:23] God's going to prepare you he's going to
[1:11:26] deliver you he's going to do everything
[1:11:28] that's necessary to bring you out of
[1:11:31] that kind you don't need to come next
[1:11:32] year you need to come now
[1:11:35] you need to come right now and let the
[1:11:37] great physician deal with your life
[1:11:40] supernaturally and he'll do it in ways
[1:11:42] that you never thought were possible
[1:11:44] Hallelujah that's the God that I know
[1:11:47] amen praise God
[1:11:49] glory to God he gave that woman a fresh
[1:11:52] start
[1:11:53] he gave her a new life he said go and
[1:11:56] live your life
[1:11:58] and that's what he said to us
[1:12:00] we're not under condemnation we're not
[1:12:02] under conviction all the time we're not
[1:12:05] constantly oh I gotta do this I gotta go
[1:12:07] to church I gotta pay my tithes I gotta
[1:12:10] if you're under that you haven't even
[1:12:12] met Christ yet
[1:12:14] you heard what Spurgeon said there he
[1:12:16] says when a man is so unaware so uh
[1:12:21] uncaring of sin in his life he's not
[1:12:24] even come into Christ he hasn't even met
[1:12:27] Christ
[1:12:29] God forevermore
[1:12:32] let's look at this
[1:12:34] listen
[1:12:35] brother Branham here from the message
[1:12:38] possessing all things now we're going to
[1:12:41] talk about how God can wipe out sin
[1:12:43] we're going to wind this down it won't
[1:12:44] be long
[1:12:45] but he says here he that will confess
[1:12:48] his sins God requires for us that when
[1:12:52] that conviction comes you've got to
[1:12:55] repent you've got to confess you got to
[1:12:58] get to that place where you where you're
[1:13:00] willing to submit to the mighty Living
[1:13:02] God see that's that's the thing that
[1:13:05] that that really is strong out there
[1:13:07] when when you tell people that the Lord
[1:13:10] Jesus wants to take your burden he wants
[1:13:13] to take away that sin
[1:13:16] they feel like
[1:13:19] I'm gonna
[1:13:20] it's Pride
[1:13:22] bow down to this
[1:13:25] I don't need to bow down to an absolute
[1:13:28] the absolute is in me
[1:13:31] I can be who I want I can live the way I
[1:13:33] want
[1:13:34] and they continue in their sin and their
[1:13:38] life goes on and it only gets worse it
[1:13:41] doesn't get better I don't care how good
[1:13:43] temporarily it might be it's going to
[1:13:45] get worse
[1:13:46] but here he says in possessing all
[1:13:48] things he says he that will confess his
[1:13:51] sins God is just to Omit them see
[1:13:54] they're in the sea of the blood of Jesus
[1:13:57] Christ never to be remembered no more
[1:14:00] that's why if you have truly confessed
[1:14:03] your sin
[1:14:04] and you have repented before God and you
[1:14:07] know that God has forgiven you in your
[1:14:09] heart
[1:14:10] you'll never bring that up again
[1:14:13] you'll never bring it up and even if
[1:14:15] somebody tells you and confesses their
[1:14:18] sin to you and and and they and they
[1:14:20] repent to you because maybe they said
[1:14:21] something wrong to you or whatever and
[1:14:24] you bring that up again in the future
[1:14:25] you never forgave him
[1:14:28] and God doesn't work that way God says
[1:14:30] when you confess I forget
[1:14:33] you're it's done how many of you women
[1:14:35] know what bleach is all of you now let's
[1:14:38] just take a great big washed up full of
[1:14:41] Clorox that's one bleach a great big tub
[1:14:45] full of Clorox and then you're going to
[1:14:47] take a little eye dropper and you've got
[1:14:50] one drop of Black Ink in that eyedropper
[1:14:53] that's your sins
[1:14:56] and he says stand right over the tub and
[1:14:59] squeeze it down then look down in the
[1:15:02] tub and find it what become of it
[1:15:06] what become of the ink when it struck
[1:15:09] that bleach it was so powerful it just
[1:15:11] took the coloring right out of it and it
[1:15:14] can never be no more what is it it's
[1:15:16] gone it's eternally lost what is it the
[1:15:19] ink itself becomes Clorox that's the
[1:15:23] blood of Jesus Christ to every confessed
[1:15:25] sin what is it it's forgotten it's done
[1:15:28] it's finished it's omitted it's divorced
[1:15:31] it's put away it can never be remembered
[1:15:34] against you no more Hallelujah
[1:15:38] that's the kind of God that we serve
[1:15:42] that's what somebody can expect when
[1:15:45] they're willing to serve the Living God
[1:15:48] notice and while you're in that body
[1:15:52] when you're in Christ you are just as
[1:15:54] free from condemnation as he is you'll
[1:15:57] never have to stand any judgment God
[1:16:01] caused judgment to be struck upon his
[1:16:04] body Isaiah 53 5 and if you're in him
[1:16:07] God cannot judge you he's already judged
[1:16:11] you when he judged Christ
[1:16:14] so what are you looking to be judged for
[1:16:16] what do you why why do you gotta why you
[1:16:19] gotta wait a year to come to church
[1:16:20] because you got to deal with all the
[1:16:23] judgment and all the sin and all the
[1:16:25] condemnation and you got to go and try
[1:16:27] and make everything right no that's not
[1:16:30] the way to come to Christ you need to
[1:16:32] come to him now and allow the blood of
[1:16:34] Jesus Christ now to change your life now
[1:16:38] and find yourself now under no
[1:16:41] condemnation so that you can live a
[1:16:44] Victorious Life and now you can be put
[1:16:46] into the service of God
[1:16:48] [Applause]
[1:16:49] amen you can't be judged you can't be
[1:16:52] under judgment no more Christ took your
[1:16:55] judgment praise God hallelujah we were
[1:16:59] criminals the judge himself has become
[1:17:02] our attorney
[1:17:04] God became man
[1:17:06] so the judge become both jury attorney
[1:17:09] and judge himself and took the justice
[1:17:12] of his law in his own hands and paid the
[1:17:16] price of it himself glory to God how
[1:17:19] much more secure could you be
[1:17:23] when he becomes both judge jury and
[1:17:26] attorney he pleaded our case glory to
[1:17:29] God Amen we were found guilty by his own
[1:17:32] law and he come and took the guilty
[1:17:35] person's place that was in the sanctuary
[1:17:38] he took his sin he took it upon himself
[1:17:40] and died and paid the price and shed his
[1:17:44] blood and give back his own token his
[1:17:48] own life why we are perfectly the case
[1:17:52] is dismissed there is no more sin to the
[1:17:56] believer
[1:17:58] hallelujah praise God I amen thank you
[1:18:01] Jesus
[1:18:03] now
[1:18:06] go to the next slide
[1:18:13] questions and answers
[1:18:15] now there's a question
[1:18:18] because a lot of people you know they
[1:18:19] they got that question in their mind and
[1:18:22] the question is
[1:18:30] in 1959 now then they that are born of
[1:18:34] God does not commit sin
[1:18:40] if you're a Christian 61 hang on a
[1:18:42] minute sorry
[1:18:56] computers
[1:18:58] praise God
[1:19:01] so let's read it if you are a Christian
[1:19:04] and you're a born-again Christian you
[1:19:07] don't mean to do wrong now this is the
[1:19:09] question your intentions and everything
[1:19:11] is right
[1:19:13] but if you do as she said here make a
[1:19:16] mistake and do something wrong will God
[1:19:19] let you just go on and on
[1:19:22] and go on and die like that and be lost
[1:19:26] or will he bring you back to
[1:19:28] reconciliation
[1:19:30] he will bring you back that's right he
[1:19:33] will bring you back and if and then if
[1:19:36] you do anything wrong it don't condemn
[1:19:39] you and you go on like that on out
[1:19:43] remember you wasn't saved at the
[1:19:45] beginning so he's saying you can't just
[1:19:47] go and sin and go on and on and on if if
[1:19:50] there's no condemnation there if there's
[1:19:53] you know then then something's then
[1:19:56] something's wrong you never actually
[1:19:58] came into
[1:20:00] any kind of reality with God Amen
[1:20:04] glory to God go to the next slide
[1:20:08] he says here you wasn't you wasn't saved
[1:20:12] you just had to make belief
[1:20:14] you wasn't saved but when you're saved
[1:20:16] you have a different Spirit you're a
[1:20:19] different nature you're a new creature
[1:20:21] in Christ and the old things has passed
[1:20:23] away and they are dead and buried in the
[1:20:26] sea of forgetfulness you see but being
[1:20:29] you're living here in this world here
[1:20:31] there's traps
[1:20:33] there's traps set for you everywhere and
[1:20:37] you're walking with your eyes on Christ
[1:20:39] and remember that when you make a
[1:20:42] mistake a real Christian will always
[1:20:44] come back quickly for reconciliation
[1:20:49] halleluia praise God go to the next
[1:20:53] slide

[1:21:32] do when your back's slid
[1:21:35] now and if your heart begins to stray
[1:21:38] around you know there's something that's
[1:21:40] happened

[1:22:28] moments and times in our lives where we
[1:22:30] make mistakes amen but but it's it's
[1:22:33] you're but it's still your child
[1:22:35] certainly that listen your child could
[1:22:38] make mistakes but they're still your
[1:22:40] child it's impossible for that man to
[1:22:42] ever be to be gone again that once being
[1:22:45] born of eternal life God's not an Indian
[1:22:48] giver
[1:22:49] God once he saves you he's not going to
[1:22:52] turn around and lose you
[1:22:54] amen praise God God God
[1:22:56] saved you because he knew you from
[1:22:59] before the foundation of the world he
[1:23:01] knew that you would accept his word he
[1:23:03] knew that you would make mistakes and he
[1:23:06] would make a way for you to come back he
[1:23:08] that heareth my words and believeth on
[1:23:10] him that sent me has everlasting life
[1:23:13] and shall never come to the Judgment but
[1:23:17] passed from Death unto life and I'll
[1:23:20] raise him up at the last days that's
[1:23:22] God's promise amen praise God glory to
[1:23:27] God you might you might backslide but
[1:23:30] you can't be lost
[1:23:31] and if you stay in that state it showed
[1:23:34] that you didn't have it in the beginning
[1:23:36] praise God so you backslider out there
[1:23:39] if you're hearing this word and this
[1:23:42] word is convicting your heart and you
[1:23:43] know that it's the truth you just need
[1:23:45] to turn back to God you need to get
[1:23:48] sincere with God you need to get down on
[1:23:50] your knees with God you need to repent
[1:23:52] you need to turn away the repent means
[1:23:55] just turn away from that unbelief turn
[1:23:57] away from that thing that's got control
[1:23:59] over your life Hallelujah but if you are

[1:25:01] on for me and he put a love in my heart
[1:25:04] that holds there it's him holding me not
[1:25:07] me holding him if it was me holding him
[1:25:10] I'd probably turn loose but as long as
[1:25:13] he's holding me he will never turn loose
[1:25:16] he promised he wouldn't I'll never leave
[1:25:19] thee nor forsake thee is what he said
