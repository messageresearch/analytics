[16:48] the Lord tonight. You God bless you,
[16:51] saints.
[16:53] Amen.
[16:54] Hallelujah. It's uh good day today.
[16:59] Fellowshipping with the Lord and
[17:01] studying a little bit. It's kind of one
[17:03] of these uh messages where you know you
[17:08] need you need the Holy Spirit to come.
[17:11] Amen. The letter
[17:14] uh you know the letter is dead without
[17:18] the spirit. Amen. Hallelujah. That's
[17:22] what we've been emphasizing on. You know
[17:24] the mighty angels come down and Christ
[17:27] is the head of the church. emphasizing
[17:29] on that, you know, it's going to take
[17:32] the Holy Ghost, the spirit of
[17:34] revelation, the spirit of truth to come
[17:37] in our lives to reveal this to us. This
[17:41] letter to us, this message that has been
[17:43] given to us is going to take him to
[17:46] reveal it to us. Amen. Personally,
[17:49] individually. And that's what we're
[17:50] coming to. That's why we're here
[17:53] tonight. Amen. Not to see Brother Tim or
[17:56] any minister.
[17:58] Hallelujah. Hope you appreciate us.
[18:00] Amen. But you're not coming here to see
[18:03] us. You're coming here to get something
[18:06] like a light bulb. A little light
[18:10] glitter will come into your heart
[18:12] tonight. Amen. If your heart is
[18:15] prepared. Amen. If your heart is ready
[18:17] to receive it. God knows. I don't know.
[18:20] But God knows. Amen. And that's what we
[18:23] want to just hit on things tonight.
[18:25] We'll see where the Holy Spirit leads.
[18:26] Amen. A preacher can't really preach
[18:28] that good when he's a preacher. A
[18:31] teacher can, but a preacher like me
[18:33] can't preach that good unless there's a
[18:34] pull here, unless there's faith here.
[18:37] Amen. So, I'm trusting in the Holy
[18:40] Spirit to reveal something to us
[18:41] tonight. Amen. As we want to continue uh
[18:45] in this uh series of the power of
[18:48] tradition part 11, I want to title this
[18:50] tonight. The mighty angel has come down
[18:53] to open the book to the bride of Jesus
[18:56] Christ. Hallelujah. That is taking place
[19:00] and is taking place right now.
[19:03] Hallelujah. Like we say, the rapture is
[19:05] on right now. The body change is taking
[19:08] place right now. Amen. Are you in it?
[19:12] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Amen. Let's
[19:14] turn to the scriptures here. I'm going
[19:16] to go to uh Revelations 5:1.
[19:20] And then we're going to go to
[19:21] Revelations 10. Two long scriptures. Um
[19:26] but then we'll just get right into it.
[19:28] Amen. Revelations
[19:32] 5:1. And I saw in the right hand of him
[19:35] that sat on the throne a
[19:38] book written within and on the backside
[19:42] sealed with seven seals.
[19:45] And I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[19:49] with a loud voice, who is worthy to open
[19:53] the book, and to loose the seals
[19:57] thereof? And no
[20:00] man, Amen. No man,
[20:06] in heaven, nor in earth, neither under
[20:09] the earth, was able to open the book,
[20:13] neither to look
[20:15] thereon.
[20:16] Wow. And
[20:19] John, and I wept much, because no man
[20:23] was found worthy to open and to read the
[20:26] book, neither to look thereon. Think
[20:29] about it. not even to look
[20:32] on. And one of the elders said unto me,
[20:35] "Weep
[20:36] not. Behold, the lion of the tribe of
[20:40] Judah, the root of David, had
[20:43] prevailed." Glory to God. To what? To
[20:46] open the book and to loose the seven
[20:49] seals thereof.
[20:51] Oh, the mighty angel in this last day.
[20:54] Amen. Glory to God. Let us turn to
[20:56] Revelations 10 1. And you see right here
[21:01] in this scripture in Revelations 5, no
[21:05] man was found worthy to open the book
[21:08] even to look
[21:10] thereon. And
[21:12] then the lion of the tribe of Judah came
[21:15] and opened the book. He was found worthy
[21:18] and the only one worthy. Now we go to
[21:20] Revelations 10 1. And I saw another
[21:24] mighty angel come down from heaven,
[21:27] clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow was
[21:30] upon his head, and his face was it were
[21:34] the sun, and his feet as pillars of
[21:37] fire. And he had in his hand a little
[21:41] book
[21:42] open.
[21:44] Hallelujah. And he set his right foot
[21:47] upon the sea, and his left foot upon the
[21:50] earth. And he cried, he cried with a
[21:52] loud voice as when a lion roarth. And
[21:56] when he cried, seven thunders uttered
[21:59] their voices. And we know the seven
[22:01] thunders is the voice of God. Amen. When
[22:04] the voice of God thunders, it reveals
[22:08] something. Amen. It always reveals
[22:10] something. Amen. Hallelujah.
[22:14] And when I and when the seven thunders
[22:16] had uttered their voices, I was about to
[22:19] write. And I heard a voice from heaven
[22:21] saying unto me, "Seal up those things
[22:24] which the seven thunders uttered and
[22:26] write them not. They can never be
[22:30] written." Amen. Tonight, you can't
[22:34] receive anything from Christ that is
[22:36] written. It has to be revealed. Amen. By
[22:40] revelation. Yes, sir.
[22:42] It's impossible to please God. It's
[22:45] impossible to move forward without
[22:48] faith.
[22:50] Hallelujah. And we get it all mixed up
[22:53] with knowledge and and all this
[22:55] understanding and and that. But it's by
[22:57] faith. It's always been by faith. It
[23:02] doesn't
[23:03] change. Hallelujah. And the angel which
[23:06] I saw stand upon the sea and upon the
[23:08] earth lifted up his hand and to heaven.
[23:11] And he swore by him that liveth forever
[23:13] and ever who had created the heavens and
[23:16] things that are therein and the earth
[23:18] and things that are there are in and the
[23:21] sea and things which are therein that
[23:24] there should be time no longer. But in
[23:28] the days of the voice of the seventh
[23:30] angel, when he shall begin the sound,
[23:33] the mystery of God should be finished,
[23:36] as he has declared to his servants, the
[23:39] prophets. And the voice which I heard
[23:42] from heaven spake unto me
[23:45] again. So the mysteries have been
[23:48] revealed by the seventh angel. And then
[23:51] here comes the voice again speaking unto
[23:54] me. go and take the little book. Nobody
[23:58] was worthy of the little book, not even
[24:00] to look upon it. But now things have
[24:03] changed.
[24:05] Now the mighty angel, Amen, is saying,
[24:08] "Go and take the little book which is
[24:11] open in the hand of the
[24:14] angel which standeth upon the sea and
[24:17] upon the earth." And I went unto the
[24:20] angel and I said unto him, "Give me the
[24:24] book."
[24:25] Hallelujah. Give me the book. It's got
[24:29] to be a a a special individuals. Amen. A
[24:34] a a predestinated vessel, a seed that
[24:38] can go to the angel with the open book
[24:40] and say, "Give me the book."
[24:44] Amen. Hallelujah.
[24:46] give me the little book. And he said
[24:49] unto me, take
[24:50] it. He didn't refuse them. Take the
[24:54] revelation. Take it and eat it up and it
[24:58] shall make thy be belly bitter, and it
[25:00] shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.
[25:03] And I took the little book out of the
[25:06] angel's
[25:08] hand.
[25:09] Hallelujah. Amen. And I ate it up. You
[25:13] see, I'm talking about the bride of
[25:15] Jesus Christ tonight. I hope I'm talking
[25:17] about you. Hallelujah.
[25:20] Amen. And it was in my mouth sweet as
[25:23] honey. And as soon as I eaten it up, my
[25:24] belly was bitter. And he said unto me,
[25:27] "Thou must prophesy again before many
[25:31] peoples, nations, and tongues, and
[25:35] kings."
[25:37] Hallelujah. Amen. Let us pray.
[25:40] Father, we thank you tonight.
[25:42] Lord, that you are the same yesterday,
[25:46] today, and forever.
[25:48] Father, man, we read your word, Lord.
[25:52] Man cannot explain your word, Father.
[25:55] But come tonight, Lord, and just give us
[25:57] something that we could feed off
[25:59] tonight, Lord. Feed your people tonight,
[26:03] Lord, by your spirit. Not by might, not
[26:06] by power, but by my spirit, sayeth the
[26:09] Lord. Give something into the hearts of
[26:11] your people by your spirit. Tonight,
[26:14] that they can leave here. We know it's a
[26:16] little here and a little there, Father.
[26:19] A little revelation here, a little
[26:20] revelation there. Father, open up this
[26:24] book even more to us, oh God. And Lord,
[26:27] if we haven't taken the book out of the
[26:29] hand of the mighty angel tonight,
[26:31] Father, may by faith, Lord, because it'd
[26:35] only be by faith, take that book, take
[26:37] that word tonight, Lord, and uh believe
[26:40] it and apply it in our lives. Grant
[26:43] these things, Lord. We commit both
[26:45] hearer and speaker into thy
[26:47] hands. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[26:50] God bless you as you're
[26:51] seated. Hallelujah. Amen. There is so
[26:55] much in here and you know uh I
[27:00] I not capable of uh bringing all the
[27:03] things out that are in here.
[27:06] Amen. But we want to talk on a few
[27:08] things here
[27:09] tonight. Amen. The mighty angel has come
[27:12] down to open the book to the bride of
[27:14] Jesus Christ. Amen. I I I believe I
[27:18] believe everything's set. I believe
[27:20] everything is in order. Amen. I I
[27:24] believe that God is preparing a bride.
[27:27] Amen. And and God is waiting on a bride
[27:30] to get ready. The Bible says that she
[27:34] has made herself ready. Amen. I believe
[27:37] the word of God, Amen, is coming forth
[27:40] not just by what you hear from a
[27:42] preacher, but by his spirit. By the
[27:45] spirit of revelation, God is opening up.
[27:48] He's always done it. He's always
[27:50] declared it in the heavens before he
[27:51] does it on earth. Amen. It's always been
[27:54] opening up in the supernatural realm.
[27:57] That's where revelation has always
[27:59] opened up and where God has always
[28:01] fulfilled his word.
[28:04] Hallelujah. Amen. Glory to God. Now, the
[28:08] word
[28:09] revelation, we all know that how
[28:12] important revelation is to us. Brother
[28:14] Brandham said it over and over and over
[28:16] again. Hallelujah. And and and the
[28:20] reason why he said it is because he
[28:23] wants you to seek, Amen. He wants you to
[28:27] understand, come to an understanding,
[28:30] Amen. that this progression of the
[28:33] rapture of perfect faith comes by
[28:35] revelation. Amen. It comes from an
[28:38] individual who seeks God in that secret
[28:42] place. Amen. Hallelujah. And it takes an
[28:45] individual to die out. Amen. It takes a
[28:48] surrender, a consecrated life. You can't
[28:51] come halfway. Amen. This person that
[28:55] took the book, Amen. Hey, they were
[29:00] consecrated. They wanted it. They were
[29:02] hungered and thirsting for what was
[29:05] written in that open book to be revealed
[29:08] to them. Even the angels desired to look
[29:11] into and see what was in there, but they
[29:14] couldn't. But God has given, Amen,
[29:18] through a predestinated seed in this
[29:20] last day, the ability to look into what
[29:24] God has opened up.
[29:26] Hallelujah. It's a mystery, my brothers
[29:28] and sisters. But when it's revealed to
[29:31] you, it's no more a mystery. But to to
[29:34] them, like the Bible says, to to you,
[29:38] it's given to know the mysteries of God,
[29:40] the mysteries of the message. Amen. But
[29:43] to them, it's not given to no one.
[29:45] Hallelujah. When the spirit of truth has
[29:47] come, it will guide you and lead you to
[29:50] all truth. Amen. That's what we seek.
[29:53] That's what we should be thirsting and
[29:55] hungered and driving after. Amen. When
[29:58] God came and revealed himself to me and
[30:01] I got the new birth and the change took
[30:03] place. Amen. I knew there was an
[30:06] understanding that opened up to me that
[30:09] it this wool he won't reveal himself and
[30:13] this doesn't come by man. This is not
[30:16] explained and taught by man. Hallelujah.
[30:19] It's not done by education. It's not
[30:22] done by works. It's not done by good
[30:24] church attendance. All these things it
[30:27] has to come by the spirit of revelation.
[30:29] The spirit of God has to reveal this to
[30:32] us. Hallelujah.
[30:35] No matter how much you fast, how much
[30:38] you read, how much you pray, how much
[30:39] you do all these things, they're all
[30:41] good. It doesn't come that way.
[30:45] Hallelujah.
[30:48] Amen. The word
[30:50] revelation,
[30:52] unveiling. This unveiling is perfectly
[30:55] described as a sculpture unveiling his
[30:58] work. And that's what it's always been
[31:00] about. Unveiling God unveiling himself
[31:04] to his bride. Amen. It's an unveiling
[31:07] and
[31:08] unveiling
[31:10] constantly. It's an unveiling to the
[31:12] looker. It's an uncovering, revealing
[31:15] what was previously hidden. It was
[31:18] hidden under the seals. This token, this
[31:22] pillar of fire, this life that's behind
[31:25] the message was previously hidden. Amen.
[31:29] Hallelujah. The book was closed. The
[31:32] book was given to Adam. Adam lost the
[31:35] book. Amen. Then the book came back into
[31:37] the holder. God himself. Amen. And now
[31:41] man could not see, could not understand
[31:44] God. Could not know who they are until
[31:48] this happened in the last day. Amen.
[31:51] Where the lion of the tribe of Judah,
[31:53] Jesus Christ himself, Amen. came and
[31:56] opened the book. Revealed the book. Open
[32:00] the seals and reveal in the shields
[32:03] right now and calling the names the
[32:06] predestined names predestined names out
[32:09] of it. Amen.
[32:11] Hallelujah. Uncovering the revelation,
[32:14] the person of Christ, but it is the
[32:17] revelation of his future works in the
[32:19] unccoming seven church ages. The
[32:22] importance of revelation by the spirit
[32:23] to a true believer can never be
[32:25] overemphasized. Revelation means more to
[32:28] you than perhaps you realize. Listen,
[32:32] it's everything.
[32:34] It there if there's no revelation, there
[32:37] is nothing. Hallelujah.
[32:40] Amen. And as we see, we're revelation
[32:43] leads you somewhere. Amen. In this hour,
[32:46] now I'm not talking about the book of
[32:48] Revelations. I'm talking about you. He's
[32:51] saying hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm
[32:55] talking about all revelation is
[32:57] tremendously important to the church. We
[33:00] see in Ephesians 21 5:21, submit
[33:04] yourself one to another in the fear of
[33:07] God.
[33:08] Wives, submit yourself to your own
[33:11] husbands as unto the Lord. For the
[33:14] husband is the head of the wife, even as
[33:16] Christ is the head of the church, and he
[33:18] is the savior of the body. Hallelujah.
[33:22] Therefore, as the church is subject unto
[33:24] Christ, so let the wives be unto their
[33:27] own husband in everything.
[33:30] Husband, love your wives, even as Christ
[33:33] also loved the church and gave himself
[33:35] for it. Hallelujah. Now listen. That he
[33:38] may sanctify and cleanse it.
[33:43] This is not just written to to tickle
[33:45] your ears or you hear it over. Oh, I
[33:48] know about wives and submit yourself and
[33:50] this and that. Amen. This is an order of
[33:52] the spirit of God. When God develops
[33:56] character inside of you, a wife and a
[33:59] husband. Amen. When Christ comes inside
[34:02] of you, this word lives out of you. It's
[34:05] not obeyed by the law. It's not obeyed
[34:08] by commandments. Amen. is obeyed by
[34:12] revelation because you see it in Christ.
[34:16] Amen. That he may sanctify and cleanse
[34:19] it with the washing of the water by the
[34:23] word of
[34:24] God.
[34:26] Hallelujah. That he may cleanse it and
[34:29] sanctify it by the washing of the water
[34:31] by the word of God.
[34:34] Hallelujah. Now, I'm just going to recap
[34:37] a little bit here on the last message.
[34:40] Not too
[34:41] much.
[34:43] Hallelujah. Glory to God. The first we
[34:47] talked about the bride. Brother Brandham
[34:50] said only God can take you in that
[34:53] capstone. Amen. We read that that no man
[34:57] can put you in there. No sir. Amen. No
[35:01] man can give you an experience to be in
[35:03] go in there to cross that chasm. Amen.
[35:07] But God has to put you in there.
[35:10] Hallelujah. A church can't put you in
[35:13] there. The five-fold ministry can't put
[35:15] you in there. But God has to come and
[35:18] put you in there. Amen. So, it's between
[35:21] you and God. It's not between you and
[35:24] the preacher, how good he is or how good
[35:26] he's not. Hallelujah. How good your
[35:30] church attendance. It's between you and
[35:33] God. Hallelujah. It's an individual
[35:36] affair between you and God in this hour.
[35:39] God ain't coming for a group. He's
[35:41] coming for individuals. Amen. That he
[35:44] has predestinated.
[35:46] Hallelujah.
[35:48] Amen. It's going to take the Holy Spirit
[35:50] to put you in that
[35:52] capstone. Today is not the Today is not
[35:56] the prophet, but it's the mighty angel
[35:59] that is here. Hallelujah. And a lot of
[36:03] people still don't see that. Hallelujah.
[36:08] That it's the mighty angel. Their eyes
[36:10] are still on the prophet. There's it's
[36:13] still on the letter. They don't see that
[36:16] Christ has come down.
[36:19] Hallelujah. We talked about the new
[36:21] birth under the seventh seal. Revelation
[36:24] is not an imagination. It's not an
[36:27] illusion, but it's a reality. Amen. The
[36:31] new birth is real. It's a reality. Amen.
[36:34] It's when Christ comes. It's not just an
[36:37] experience or a feeling. Amen. Or even
[36:40] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[36:43] It's when Christ comes and awakens that
[36:46] seed inside of you and you start
[36:48] recognizing who you are.
[36:51] Amen. You start realizing that there's
[36:54] something different about me. Amen.
[36:57] Hallelujah. You already know that all
[37:00] your life there's something different
[37:01] around about you. Amen. God God didn't
[37:05] leave you and just come to you like he
[37:08] was been always since birth. I knew you
[37:11] in the womb. He said,
[37:13] hallelujah. Amen. Amen. We talked about
[37:16] the deception. The devil will meet us on
[37:18] every level of faith to try to deceive
[37:21] us and fight against us of what? Of who
[37:24] we really are. that we are. Amen. We are
[37:29] what God has prophesied in these last
[37:31] days. Who we are. Amen. It's not about
[37:35] just what's prophesied about the prophet
[37:38] and what he fulfilled, but what's
[37:40] prophesied about the bride of Jesus
[37:42] Christ. What has been spoken about her.
[37:45] Amen. When she recognizes who she is.
[37:48] Hallelujah. That's what the devil's
[37:50] scared of. When individuals come and
[37:53] recognize that they are sons and
[37:55] daughters of God, that there's an
[37:56] attribute, a seed of God inside of them,
[37:58] amen, that is sinless
[38:02] and that their flesh does not hinder
[38:05] them anymore.
[38:07] If they make a mistake, they they got a
[38:10] blood atonement. They know that. They
[38:11] come and they repent. Why? Because their
[38:14] heart, Amen, is pure before God. Oh yes,
[38:19] your heart is pure before God. Amen. In
[38:23] your heart, in that seed, there is no
[38:26] desire to sin. Listen, if you sin
[38:29] willfully and openly, Amen. There's a
[38:32] problem there. But each and every one of
[38:36] us here tonight, Amen. Even though you
[38:38] make mistakes in your heart, you don't
[38:42] want to sin. There's no desire to sin.
[38:45] That's why you're here to hear the word
[38:46] of God. So that faith can come to you.
[38:50] Amen. So that you can progress in faith
[38:52] tonight. Amen. That you can grow in
[38:54] faith tonight. Amen. Grow into the
[38:56] statue that he made you tonight. That's
[38:59] why that's your desire in your heart
[39:01] tonight. But Satan tries to on every
[39:04] level to try to deceive even our own
[39:07] hearts. And that's why the Bible says if
[39:09] your heart condemn you, Amen. God is
[39:12] greater than your heart. Hallelujah. God
[39:15] has so justified the bride of Jesus
[39:18] Christ in every way. Amen.
[39:21] He's removed every obstacle. He's
[39:24] removed every hindrance out of the bride
[39:26] of Jesus Christ's way so she can come
[39:28] and take this open book and eat it and
[39:32] keep eating it. Amen. We got to keep
[39:35] eating that open book. Keep feeding off
[39:37] of it. Oh yes. It'll make the belly bit
[39:40] better. Amen. It'll do things in your
[39:42] life. It'll stir things up in your
[39:44] heart. Amen. It'll reveal things like
[39:47] David said, "If there be any evil in me,
[39:49] take it out, Lord." Is that your desire?
[39:52] If there's any evil, take it out, Lord.
[39:54] I want this vessel sanctified for the
[39:57] Holy Ghost. I don't want no devil in
[39:59] this vessel. I don't want no devil using
[40:01] this vessel. Oh,
[40:04] hallelujah.
[40:05] Amen. Glory to
[40:08] God. Amen. We talked about people
[40:11] misplacing,
[40:13] misinterpreting, dislocating the word of
[40:15] God for the age that we live in. So
[40:18] important, my brothers and sisters. How
[40:20] can you Amen. How can any one of them
[40:23] for their age come to perfect faith for
[40:25] their age and fulfill the word for their
[40:27] age if you misplace it?
[40:29] Amen. And dislocate it. We got to find
[40:34] the revelation for this age. And we can
[40:38] only find it in Christ. Amen. Only he
[40:42] can reveal it. Hallelujah. I'm never
[40:44] going to go back to man and man is going
[40:47] to reveal this to you. This is not what
[40:49] this is about. This is pointing you to
[40:51] Christ. Amen. We got to point you to
[40:54] Christ. You got to meet up with Christ
[40:57] somehow. You got to make a connection
[40:59] with Christ in your soul, in your
[41:02] spirit, in your experience. You got to
[41:04] connect with Jesus Christ.
[41:07] Hallelujah.
[41:09] Amen.
[41:12] Amen. Yes. We talked about the changing
[41:15] of the age after the seals were open.
[41:18] How everything changed. Brother Brandham
[41:21] said the Bible became a new Bible.
[41:23] Remember he was just preaching what was
[41:25] he was re being revealed out of the
[41:27] Bible at that time. Now what he was
[41:30] preaching we call the message. Amen.
[41:33] Hallelujah. So he said at that time the
[41:36] Bible's become a new Bible. But what is
[41:39] the bride saying when these when these
[41:41] word opens up this book opens up to her
[41:44] in this day in this age? Amen. The
[41:47] message becomes a new message to us.
[41:49] Amen. Hallelujah. It's just not the
[41:52] seven church age message to us anymore.
[41:54] But it's the mighty angel Christ
[41:56] himself. If that's the message to us.
[42:00] Amen. Hallelujah.
[42:02] Glory to God.
[42:05] Amen. And crossing over to the capstone,
[42:08] the bride age. Amen. We talked about the
[42:12] shift. There's always a shift going on.
[42:15] Amen. We need to shift all the time. God
[42:18] is always marching on his word.
[42:21] Hallelujah. We talked about it isn't a
[42:24] future thing. It's a now thing. It's
[42:28] happening now. It's taking place now, my
[42:32] brothers and sisters. He said after he
[42:34] preached the token message, Amen. He
[42:36] preached desperation. Amen. Hallelujah.
[42:40] If there's never been a time and day
[42:42] that we should be desperate. Amen. And
[42:44] I'm not talking about desperation where
[42:47] you're just weeping and crying and
[42:48] weeping and crying. Desperate for that
[42:50] word to be opened up to you. desperate
[42:53] for Christ to come to you to give you
[42:57] the faith that you need to overcome.
[43:00] And how are you going to overcome?
[43:03] Brother Brown said, "When the devil
[43:04] comes in as a flood, he floods your life
[43:07] with unbelief." What does he do? He
[43:10] comes and makes his word more real to
[43:12] you. Amen. The word that you are, God,
[43:16] the seed that you are inside, comes and
[43:19] gives you faith and makes your position
[43:22] in Christ more real to you. So you can
[43:26] overcome because without that you can't
[43:28] take the word of God. Amen. And speak
[43:31] that word. Amen. You can only speak the
[43:34] word. Amen. In your position. And only
[43:37] in your position when it's revealed to
[43:39] you can you speak the word. And it
[43:42] becomes the living spoken word of God.
[43:44] Just like Joshua needed the son to stand
[43:47] still because he had a commission. He
[43:49] had a revelation of what God wanted him
[43:51] to do. So he said, "I need time. Stand
[43:55] still, son." And it stood still. Amen.
[43:59] It's like us when we recognize who we
[44:02] are. Amen. We recognize the battle that
[44:05] we're going through. We can say the same
[44:07] thing. We can speak that word.
[44:11] Hallelujah. Because we know what we have
[44:14] need of. Amen. The bride will know what
[44:17] to do with the word of God. She'll know
[44:19] how to take the word in her own personal
[44:22] life and apply that word of God to her
[44:25] life and speak it.
[44:28] Amen.
[44:31] Hallelujah.
[44:33] Amen. We talked about playing it safe.
[44:38] It's not good to play safe. This is not
[44:41] about playing safe. This is about
[44:43] stepping out in by faith. This is about
[44:45] taking
[44:46] risk. Hallelujah. The children of Israel
[44:50] were playing it safe when when Goliath
[44:52] came. And here was Goliath defiling the
[44:55] very armies of the living God. But here
[44:58] come David. Amen. and a warrior, a man
[45:02] filled with inspiration, a man anointed
[45:04] from Samuel the prophet with a
[45:07] revelation of who he was to be king one
[45:11] day with visions and revelations
[45:14] breaking upon him. Amen. And he said
[45:17] that God gave me the lion. Hallelujah.
[45:20] God gave me the bear. God will give me
[45:23] this Goliath in my hands. And he went
[45:26] and he spoke the word. Amen. Hallelujah.
[45:29] because he knew who he was. He knew who
[45:31] God was. He knew what he was called to
[45:34] do. My brothers and sisters, do we know
[45:37] the prophecies of this hour? Do we know
[45:39] what's been spoken of us and what to do
[45:42] with the word of God in this hour?
[45:45] Hallelujah. Oh my. When we come into
[45:48] that, when a son and daughter of God
[45:50] comes into that kind of maturity and
[45:52] she's walking in that kind of spirit of
[45:55] Christ matured inside of her, oh my.
[45:58] Hallelujah. That's where brother
[46:00] Brandham says, I long to see that day.
[46:03] Amen. Cuz he's seen that maturity inside
[46:06] of him as the wave sheep. Amen. He says,
[46:09] I long to see that day. But he says, you
[46:12] know what? I'll ride this trail again.
[46:14] not him. But this Holy Ghost life, this
[46:17] token life of Christ, amen, when when
[46:20] when you recognize that you're a son and
[46:22] daughter of God, amen, is going to ride
[46:25] again. I believe it's now riding again,
[46:29] my brothers and
[46:30] sisters. Oh, hallelujah. You know how
[46:33] great this calling is in this last day?
[46:36] out of all the prophets, all all of
[46:38] them. Here we are in the last days, my
[46:41] brothers and
[46:42] sisters, me and you here
[46:45] tonight, how great this calling is. How
[46:49] God must have seen us before the
[46:51] foundation of the world and placed us
[46:53] here. Do you ever think about that?
[46:56] Amen. Being here tonight, hearing the
[46:58] word of God, recognizing God sent a
[47:00] prophet, but even greater than that,
[47:02] recognizing that you're part of the
[47:04] prophecies. Amen. You're part of what's
[47:07] been spoken of the bride of Jesus
[47:08] Christ. And here you are in the gross
[47:11] darkness, the most wicked, most
[47:13] deceiving age. Hallelujah.
[47:17] The pale horse rider riding, taking the
[47:20] word of God and mixing it all up. And
[47:23] here you
[47:24] are,
[47:26] God. God calling you, calling me tonight
[47:31] to take this word of God. Hallelujah. If
[47:34] we just get one glimpse of revelation of
[47:37] the meaning of that that God placed the
[47:40] word inside of us to take it on to the
[47:43] rapture tonight.
[47:46] Oh
[47:48] my. We would see things in a totally
[47:51] different
[47:52] light.
[47:54] Amen.
[47:57] Hallelujah.
[47:59] Amen. Revelations 10:17.
[48:02] That's to be brother Brandon speaking
[48:04] here. Then there's a coming forth of
[48:06] seven mysterious thunders. That's not
[48:09] even written at
[48:11] all. Not even written at all.
[48:14] Hallelujah. That's right. I believe that
[48:17] those seven thunders will be revealed in
[48:20] the last days in order to get the bride
[48:23] together for rapturing faith. Amen.
[48:28] Because what we have right now, he's
[48:30] talking about back then, it wouldn't be
[48:32] able to do it. Hallelujah. There's
[48:36] something that's got to step us
[48:39] further. Hallelujah.
[48:42] That's why we press on. That's why we
[48:45] come and we preach. That's why we
[48:48] encourage. That's why we rebuke. Amen.
[48:51] That's why we expose sin. to keep you
[48:53] pressing forward, keep you pressing on.
[48:57] We have not arrived, amen, God is
[49:00] preparing us, amen, for that time, amen,
[49:03] with those seven thunders will utter,
[49:06] amen, and reveal what we need to know
[49:09] and see to bring that rapture and faith
[49:12] upon us. Amen. But we got to be
[49:15] prepared. Amen. We got to be ready for
[49:18] that time. This is a preparing time.
[49:21] This is a getting ready time. This is a
[49:24] consecration time. This is a dying out
[49:27] time. This is a surrendering time for
[49:30] that time to come. God is speaking to us
[49:34] to get ready. Amen.
[49:40] Hallelujah. Sometimes we don't even got
[49:42] enough faith faith to be changed in a
[49:45] moment to be swept out of this earth.
[49:49] We find that after a while, the Lord
[49:51] willing, we'll find these things that
[49:52] are written. We can hardly have enough
[49:55] faith for healing. Sometimes, think
[49:58] about it. When we get sick and we get we
[50:03] get pain or whatever comes upon our
[50:05] body, we we we fight with
[50:08] doubt within inside of us. hardly
[50:12] grasping unless the saints come together
[50:14] and the faith of all the saints come
[50:16] together and pray which we should. Amen.
[50:21] But brother Brandham said in in the
[50:22] meetings there he said I want this to
[50:25] come to a place where you just accept
[50:27] the word of God for what it said. Just
[50:30] accept it. When God speaks to you, you
[50:34] receive it. You accept it and you move
[50:36] forward. Hallelujah. And then faith
[50:39] takes place. Healing takes place,
[50:42] deliverance takes place, God comes on
[50:45] the scene. Amen. Hallelujah. When we
[50:48] stay and stand ranked with that word of
[50:50] God. Thus sayeth the Lord. Thus sayeth
[50:53] the Lord.
[50:54] Amen. Amen. That's the kind of
[50:57] perseverance, persistence that we got to
[51:00] have that it's thus saith the Lord and
[51:04] God you have spoken to me. Amen.
[51:08] The capstone revelation that reveals new
[51:12] knowledge or the revelation of God's
[51:15] plan at the end time in the book of
[51:17] revelation. The capstone is the final
[51:19] capping of all revelations to complete
[51:23] perfect faith in the
[51:25] bride that she is predestinated to
[51:28] fulfill because she is the final voice
[51:32] to the final age. Amen. Amen. There's
[51:36] going to be no other voice but her voice
[51:39] in this age. Hallelujah. Amen. I'm just
[51:43] laying some things. We're going to get
[51:44] into it a little bit more. Amen. Unto
[51:47] all people it is given to read the
[51:49] messages or listen to the tapes, but
[51:52] unto the bride of Jesus Christ is given
[51:54] to know the mysteries of the message,
[51:56] the revelations that are sealed behind
[51:58] the seven steels in the capstone. Then
[52:01] the bride starts recognizing that the
[52:04] scriptures that she is reading is
[52:07] identifying her and setting her free as
[52:10] the scripture says you shall know the
[52:12] truth.
[52:14] Hallelujah. You shall know the truth and
[52:17] the truth shall set you free. It's okay
[52:19] to recognize brother Brandham in the
[52:21] scriptures and what he fulfilled. Amen.
[52:25] But it's recognizing who you are in the
[52:27] scriptures. That's what it is today.
[52:30] Brother Brandon was here, he would say,
[52:32] "Don't look at me and and my and my
[52:35] position and what I fulfilled." Amen.
[52:37] Look to you. Amen. Look to you in your
[52:42] position.
[52:45] Hallelujah.
[52:47] Amen. Only the truth when it's revealed
[52:50] to you who you are sets you
[52:53] free. Why people are in
[52:56] bondage? Because they don't know who
[52:58] they are. Why the world is lost? Because
[53:01] they don't know who they
[53:03] are. The greatest power that God has
[53:06] given through revelation to the bride of
[53:08] Jesus Christ is for her to recognize who
[53:10] she
[53:11] is. Amen. That's why he said that's why
[53:14] he said you'll be an invincible army.
[53:16] You'll be a hot potato to Satan. Satan
[53:18] won't know what to do with
[53:20] you. He'll have power over you. He'll
[53:23] actually be powerless before you when he
[53:25] stands before you. Hallelujah.
[53:28] Amen. Glory to God. Amen. The prophet is
[53:32] not the Holy Spirit today. It's Jesus
[53:34] Christ, the mighty angel, come down to
[53:36] the prophet. And here he now he takes
[53:39] the word of God. He takes the word of
[53:41] God and now opens it up and releases it
[53:45] by the opening of those seals.
[53:47] Hallelujah. Amen. There's still a lot a
[53:52] whole lot the bride don't understand in
[53:55] the message. We don't see and understand
[53:58] everything, my brothers and sisters.
[54:00] Hallelujah. God is still
[54:03] unfolding. God is still revealing. Amen.
[54:06] These people that claim they know
[54:08] everything, they know the message. You
[54:10] hear them? I know the word. Amen. I I
[54:13] know the message. That's only the
[54:15] letter. That's only the intellect. Amen.
[54:19] Because you can never you can never
[54:22] release revelation on your own ability.
[54:25] No man was found worthy to release any
[54:28] revelation. God holds that power in his
[54:31] hand to release revelation. Amen. And he
[54:34] releases it in time and seasons. Amen.
[54:38] When it's need to be re released. Amen.
[54:41] That's why we're here. That's why God,
[54:43] we're going through trials and testings.
[54:46] Amen. God is molding us and shaping us
[54:49] and dealing with the very inner parts of
[54:51] us. Amen. Because there's times and
[54:53] seasons that God wants to release more
[54:57] of who you are, more of himself to you
[55:00] and unveil himself more to
[55:02] you. But there's got to be a
[55:05] preparation. Amen. There's got to be a
[55:08] preparation inside of us. Amen.
[55:11] Hallelujah. And that's the greatest
[55:13] battle ever fought. Amen. We're fighting
[55:16] the elements. Every one of us fighting
[55:18] this flesh as it gets older. We go to
[55:21] work. We get tired. Here we are
[55:22] Wednesday night, spent all day working.
[55:26] Now we're here. We're fighting the
[55:27] elements. Amen. Uh, Satan throwing
[55:31] everything at us. But God said he's
[55:33] going to have a bride, a a a spotless
[55:37] bride. He's going to have a bride with
[55:39] faith, perfect faith in this hour. He's
[55:42] going to have a bride that's going to
[55:43] overcome everything that comes her way.
[55:46] Regardless of what it is, he's going to
[55:50] have a bride.
[55:52] Amen.
[55:53] Amen. Now look at the word prophec
[55:57] prophesied. It means to speak forth by
[56:00] divine
[56:01] inspiration. To predict an event, to
[56:05] utter forth, to declare thing that can
[56:08] only be made known by divine revelation.
[56:12] And you could only know this by eating
[56:15] the book, by receiving a revelation for
[56:19] yourself for what this message really
[56:23] is. What is this message really
[56:27] about? What is this message supposed to
[56:31] do in me?
[56:34] Amen. Why was a prophet sent? Why were
[56:38] these things spoken?
[56:42] What is this supposed to do to
[56:44] me? Then the scripture said as we
[56:48] read you must prophesy
[56:52] again.
[57:01] Hallelujah. Now
[57:03] listen, prophesy
[57:07] again. We are not to move in a
[57:10] realm around
[57:16] us to try to prophetically see things
[57:20] and prophesy
[57:22] things. It says prophesy again. So
[57:26] something has already been prophesied
[57:27] about the bride of Jesus
[57:29] Christ. Amen.
[57:31] Prophetically means in a way that
[57:34] correctly tells or predicts what's
[57:36] happening in the future. It describes a
[57:39] statement or action that accurately
[57:41] foretells the future events. We don't
[57:44] need that, my brothers and
[57:47] sisters. We don't need to to move in a
[57:50] realm to prophesy like that again. It's
[57:53] already been spoken. It's already been
[57:56] prophesied. That's why he says prophesy
[57:58] again. We don't need to prophesy it
[58:02] again. The future events, it's already
[58:04] been prophesied of who the bride of
[58:06] Jesus Christ is. Her life has been
[58:09] prophesied. Her walk has been
[58:11] prophesied. Everything, her victory has
[58:14] been
[58:15] prophesied. Everything has been spoken
[58:17] about her. Now she has to prophesy
[58:20] again. Other words, she has to come to
[58:23] that same maturity. She has to ride this
[58:26] trail again. She has to move through the
[58:30] Holy Spirit in her life to bring forth
[58:32] the word of God inside of her
[58:37] again.
[58:39] Hallelujah. Amen. People running around
[58:42] with gifts and that prophesying this,
[58:44] prophesying that about the bride of
[58:45] Jesus Christ, prophesying God's going to
[58:47] do this, God's going to do that. God has
[58:50] already spoken it. God has already
[58:52] declared it. Amen.
[58:54] He's already spoken what he's going to
[58:56] do in these last days. It's already been
[58:58] released and opened up. Amen. The seven
[59:01] seals has been loosed. The names have
[59:03] been loosed. Amen. Hallelujah. The token
[59:06] is here. It's not coming. The token is
[59:09] here tonight. Hallelujah.
[59:13] Everything has been spoken. Everything
[59:14] has been prophesied already for the
[59:17] bride of Jesus Christ. Now, we have to
[59:19] walk into that prophecy by faith. Amen.
[59:23] That's what we're doing. Walking into
[59:24] that prophecy by faith. Second Peter
[59:28] 1:18. And this voice came from heaven.
[59:32] And we heard when we were with him in
[59:34] the holy mount. We have also a more sure
[59:38] word of prophecy. Whereto ye do well
[59:42] that you take heed as unto light that
[59:44] shineth in dark until the day dawn the
[59:47] day star rise in your hearts. Knowing
[59:50] this verse that no prophecy of the
[59:53] scriptures is of any private
[59:56] interpretation.
[59:59] Hallelujah. Amen. We don't need any
[1:00:02] private
[1:00:03] interpretation. We don't need anybody to
[1:00:06] come and tell us. Amen. What has been
[1:00:09] prophesied about the bride of Jesus
[1:00:11] Christ and what has been spoken. We
[1:00:14] don't even need anybody to really
[1:00:16] explain the message to us. Hallelujah.
[1:00:18] It's Christ. It's revelation that we're
[1:00:22] talking about. It's Christ that's the
[1:00:24] head of the church. It's the spirit of
[1:00:26] revelation that we're talking about.
[1:00:28] When the spirit of truth comes, amen,
[1:00:31] it's him that reveals it to us and makes
[1:00:34] it known to us. For prophecy came not in
[1:00:37] old times by the will of men, but holy
[1:00:40] men of God that spake as they were moved
[1:00:44] by the Holy Ghost.
[1:00:46] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:00:48] We know the spirit said through the
[1:00:52] prophet that I'll ride this trail again.
[1:00:55] This wave sheet hath had come to
[1:00:57] maturity and manifest in the same as the
[1:01:00] first fruit did which is Jesus Christ.
[1:01:03] We will lose we will lose our authority
[1:01:07] and our rights to be the final voice in
[1:01:10] the final age if we come underneath any
[1:01:14] mantle of revelation of of any other
[1:01:17] revelation of the prophet in these last
[1:01:19] days and of the mighty angel. Other
[1:01:22] words we come under any kind of mantle
[1:01:25] any kind of uh influence of revelation
[1:01:28] out there except this seventh angel
[1:01:31] message. Amen. This word revealed to us
[1:01:34] in these last days, we lose that right
[1:01:37] to be the final voice. We have to take
[1:01:39] the word that's been spoken. Amen. This
[1:01:42] word that's being revealed in these last
[1:01:44] days and receive that word. Then we
[1:01:48] become that voice of God. Like I said,
[1:01:50] the word comes to the prophet. The
[1:01:52] prophet receives the word. Then he
[1:01:55] speaks it. Then it becomes the voice of
[1:01:57] God. The bride receives the prophet's
[1:02:00] word.
[1:02:01] Amen. And she receives it. She eats the
[1:02:05] book. She eats the revelation. Amen.
[1:02:08] It's bitter in her life. But she
[1:02:11] overcomes. She presses through and that
[1:02:13] word becomes flesh again. And then she
[1:02:16] speaks only what has been spoken. Only
[1:02:19] what has been prophesied in these last
[1:02:21] days. Nothing else. Amen. Nothing else.
[1:02:25] Amen. Oh God. That's what God wants to
[1:02:28] see. Amen. mature sons and daughters of
[1:02:31] God, knowing who she is, knowing the
[1:02:35] word that's inside of her and how she's
[1:02:38] going to speak it, how she's going to
[1:02:40] live it. Amen. How she's going to
[1:02:43] conduct herself under this inspiration
[1:02:45] of this hour. Amen. The meaning of
[1:02:49] prophecy, the bride is commanded,
[1:02:52] hallelujah, to prophesy again. This
[1:02:54] bride will only and can only prophesy
[1:02:57] again what's already been prophesied of
[1:02:59] her. She can only prophesy what's been
[1:03:02] spoken over the wave sheet and that's
[1:03:04] been waved over the people. Hallelujah.
[1:03:07] Amen. He was the first fruit. You want
[1:03:09] to know what a son and daughter God
[1:03:11] comes to become like when you come to
[1:03:14] maturity. Listen, when I used to listen
[1:03:16] to those tapes, Amen. I wasn't just
[1:03:19] listening to a man's voice. I was seeing
[1:03:22] a life. I was being attracted to a life
[1:03:25] of Jesus Christ.
[1:03:28] Humility. How God I can see through the
[1:03:31] tapes how this Holy Spirit was taking a
[1:03:33] man and molding him and shaping him and
[1:03:37] revealing himself to him. Amen. I was
[1:03:40] seeing the life of Christ more and more
[1:03:42] and more. And if you listen to the tapes
[1:03:44] and you go up and up and up, you see
[1:03:47] that maturing of that life of Christ.
[1:03:49] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:03:53] Amen. That's what attracted me. I want
[1:03:57] that. I want that life. I want that
[1:04:02] experience. Amen. I don't want to be a
[1:04:04] prophet, a seventh angel prophet like
[1:04:07] some people want to be or be like him.
[1:04:10] No. But I want that life. I want that
[1:04:13] humility, that life of Christ. I want
[1:04:15] the same God that was dealing with him.
[1:04:18] Amen. Amen. bringing him to a place like
[1:04:21] Paul says, "I die daily." Oh God, bitter
[1:04:25] in the belly, my brothers and sisters.
[1:04:27] Amen. Sweet in the mouth, the revelation
[1:04:29] of who you are. Amen. That you're
[1:04:31] called, you're elected, you're
[1:04:33] predestinated, but bitter in the belly
[1:04:35] when God starts coming to your life.
[1:04:38] Amen. Hallelujah. And asking for a
[1:04:40] surrender.
[1:04:42] Hallelujah.
[1:04:44] Amen. And consecration in this day and
[1:04:47] age. That's in itself is going to be
[1:04:50] overcome in power and
[1:04:53] victory.
[1:04:55] Amen. Hallelujah. The first one to come
[1:04:57] to maturity. Now the bride will come to
[1:05:00] that same maturity. Hallelujah. That's
[1:05:03] her prophesying again. The bride
[1:05:06] believes everything. The prophet
[1:05:08] believes where God led him, how God
[1:05:10] matured him as a son of God. The bride
[1:05:13] wants that same revelation, that
[1:05:15] authority to be the final voice in the
[1:05:17] final age. We must stay under this
[1:05:20] revelation of the prophecies that have
[1:05:23] been given to us in this hour. Amen. We
[1:05:26] must see these prophecies, seek these
[1:05:30] prophecies to be fulfilled in our lives
[1:05:32] in this day. Not to waver from it, not
[1:05:36] to put our own interpretation on it, not
[1:05:38] to say it's going to be this way or that
[1:05:40] way. Hallelujah. How can you look at the
[1:05:43] life of Christ through the tapes,
[1:05:45] through a man in this last day, amen,
[1:05:47] and say, "I'm going to put my own
[1:05:49] interpretation on it. I'm going to take
[1:05:51] the message and I'm going to I'm going
[1:05:52] to fit it to me. This is who I am." What
[1:05:56] do you mean this is who you are? You're
[1:05:58] supposed to be dead. Dead in Christ.
[1:06:01] Buried in Christ. It's not who I am.
[1:06:05] It's not who I think my personality or
[1:06:07] where I fit in. It's not where you think
[1:06:10] you fit in. That's not revelation.
[1:06:14] Revelation reveals where you fit in.
[1:06:16] Revelation reveals the part of the word
[1:06:18] that you are. Hallelujah. And you know
[1:06:22] it's not by your own thinking, your own
[1:06:25] strength, your own understanding. You
[1:06:27] know it came from somewhere.
[1:06:30] Amen.
[1:06:31] You didn't have it before. Now you got
[1:06:34] it. You didn't know who you were before.
[1:06:37] Now you're starting to recognize who you
[1:06:38] are. Who is that? Amen. That's a mighty
[1:06:42] angel. That ain't man doing that. That
[1:06:45] ain't you doing that. Amen. We're to
[1:06:48] conform to the word. Not to ourselves,
[1:06:51] not to the world, not to the things of
[1:06:53] the world, but conform to the word.
[1:06:56] Prophecies of this day that God has
[1:06:58] spoken over the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:07:01] He's watching over his word.
[1:07:04] Hallelujah. God is watching over his
[1:07:07] word and he knows who is seeking.
[1:07:10] He knows those who are hungering and
[1:07:12] thirsting to become that word that's
[1:07:14] spoken for this day and age. He knows. I
[1:07:19] might not know. I might fool you. You
[1:07:21] might fool me and claim you're a good
[1:07:24] Christian and you want this word and you
[1:07:26] want you want to believe this word and
[1:07:28] that. But you can't fool him. He knows.
[1:07:30] He's watching over. Amen.
[1:07:34] Hallelujah. Glory to
[1:07:36] God. Amen.
[1:07:41] You keep praying for me. Amen. It's one
[1:07:44] of those messages that is not easy.
[1:07:48] Hallelujah. Because it's not men that
[1:07:51] can reveal it. Now, we look at this
[1:07:54] book. We look at this open
[1:07:57] book. It's
[1:07:59] for a peculiar people.
[1:08:02] It's for a special prepared people, my
[1:08:05] brothers and
[1:08:06] sisters in these last
[1:08:09] days. The bride of Christ is the only
[1:08:12] one that is able to look upon this
[1:08:15] book. She's the only one that can take
[1:08:18] the book. She is the only one that was
[1:08:21] given permission to take the book out of
[1:08:23] the angel's hand and to look upon the
[1:08:27] book. The only
[1:08:30] one. It's not given to
[1:08:33] everybody. Hallelujah. You see how
[1:08:35] blessed it is when you recognize who you
[1:08:38] are. You really recognize that you're a
[1:08:40] son and daughter of God and that you're
[1:08:42] called. How blessed you
[1:08:45] are. How peculiar you are. Hallelujah.
[1:08:50] right there in that revelation of of
[1:08:53] knowing that when God reveals that to
[1:08:56] you and you know that and a lot of us
[1:08:59] are coming to that revelation right now
[1:09:02] in our experience in our fellowship, our
[1:09:06] testimony, we're coming there and some
[1:09:09] are coming a little
[1:09:10] slower.
[1:09:12] Hallelujah. Amen. Not anybody can take
[1:09:15] this
[1:09:17] book and eat it up because that open
[1:09:20] book is only revealed to the bride. It's
[1:09:23] been given to her to know as it says in
[1:09:25] Matthew 13:11. And he answered said unto
[1:09:28] them, because it's given to you to know
[1:09:30] the mysteries, but not given to them.
[1:09:33] The bride of Jesus Christ cannot go to
[1:09:36] the seventh angel
[1:09:40] messenger for the open
[1:09:42] book. Did the scripture say that when
[1:09:47] she came to get the book out of the
[1:09:50] hand, what angel was it that the
[1:09:53] scripture prophesied? It wasn't the
[1:09:56] seventh
[1:09:57] angel. It was the mighty angel.
[1:10:01] She can't get it by just reading,
[1:10:04] knowing the
[1:10:05] message.
[1:10:08] Hallelujah.
[1:10:09] Amen. The seventh angel himself. Look at
[1:10:12] brother Brandham. He said, "If the angel
[1:10:14] didn't come to me when I was studying
[1:10:16] those
[1:10:17] seals, I was studying here. I was
[1:10:19] studying there. I was picking this
[1:10:21] commentary, this one here, what this
[1:10:23] person said and that." And he said, "I
[1:10:25] was going to go out and preach that."
[1:10:29] Do you hear what I'm saying? He said, I
[1:10:32] was going to go out and preach that. But
[1:10:35] he said, "Then an angel came into the
[1:10:38] room."
[1:10:39] Hallelujah. The angel came into the room
[1:10:43] and started revealing, Amen. these
[1:10:46] mysteries, these truth to him. What are
[1:10:48] we talking about? Amen. The mighty angel
[1:10:52] Christ revealing these things. Amen.
[1:10:56] Christ is the head of the church. Christ
[1:10:59] the mighty angel has come down. He is
[1:11:01] here today. He's the one that you should
[1:11:04] be in contact with. You should be
[1:11:06] connecting with. Yes. Hallelujah.
[1:11:11] Amen. Glory to God. I hope you're seeing
[1:11:13] something here. Amen. That's pointing
[1:11:16] you to Christ. Amen. In this hour, in
[1:11:19] this day. Amen. Brother Brandon was
[1:11:22] going to mess it up. Amen. But this book
[1:11:25] is only revealed by the mighty angel.
[1:11:28] Amen. This book is not meant for any
[1:11:31] half-hearted
[1:11:32] Christian. Amen. Any half-hearted
[1:11:36] message believer or or or or message
[1:11:39] follower or half-hearted in your
[1:11:42] consecration, half-hearted in your
[1:11:45] dedication to Christ. It's not meant for
[1:11:47] these kind of people.
[1:11:50] Hallelujah. It's meant for those, Amen.
[1:11:53] that are consecrated, that are
[1:11:55] wholehearted.
[1:11:57] He said, "Give me your heart. Give me
[1:11:59] your whole heart, my brothers. It
[1:12:02] doesn't come any other way. You can't
[1:12:05] get it any other way. The new birth is a
[1:12:08] mess." Hallelujah. It's painful. It's
[1:12:12] between life and death. Amen. We got to
[1:12:15] come this way. We got to dedicate our
[1:12:18] lives, consecrate our lives, every day
[1:12:21] of our lives. If this is real to you and
[1:12:24] this is open up to you every day, you
[1:12:26] should be seeking his face. Amen. In his
[1:12:29] presence, no matter what you're doing,
[1:12:31] Amen. You're seeking the kingdom of God
[1:12:34] with inside of you. I can be working
[1:12:36] seeking the kingdom of God. I can be
[1:12:38] doing certain things seeking the kingdom
[1:12:40] of God. When I wake up, the kingdom of
[1:12:42] God is on my
[1:12:43] mind. Oh God, I said, Lord, reveal
[1:12:47] yourself to me
[1:12:48] today. Give me something today. Give me
[1:12:52] some substance today that would make me
[1:12:54] stronger in who I am.
[1:12:57] Hallelujah. Oh, my brother, the the the
[1:13:00] devil, try to make you lukewarm, lazy,
[1:13:03] powerless, try to make you feel
[1:13:05] comfortable. Listen, I'm here to tell
[1:13:07] you, and I've been here telling you,
[1:13:09] Amen. You ain't going into rapture
[1:13:12] because you're in a message church. You
[1:13:14] ain't going into rapture because you
[1:13:16] believe God sent a prophet. You ain't
[1:13:18] going into rapture because you
[1:13:20] believe. You're going into rapture
[1:13:22] because God has called you, elected you
[1:13:25] to fulfill this word and become this
[1:13:28] word in this hour. You are an overcomer.
[1:13:32] Amen. You're not just overcoming little
[1:13:35] trials that the world gets. You're
[1:13:37] overcoming unbelief inside of you.
[1:13:40] You're overcoming the real true
[1:13:42] overcomer is overcoming the real sin
[1:13:45] which is unbelief. Amen. Unbelief in
[1:13:48] what God has spoken and prophesied in
[1:13:50] this hour. Hallelujah. This book is only
[1:13:54] for somebody who has sold out to
[1:13:56] Christ. Oh, listen. I've gone through
[1:13:58] ups and
[1:13:59] downs in the last 30 years, but I know
[1:14:02] when when he came and I didn't even
[1:14:05] understand what it was, but when he came
[1:14:06] and give me that experience of the new
[1:14:08] birth, I knew right there. I didn't
[1:14:11] understand it all. I was I wasn't at
[1:14:13] full maturity, but the deposit was made.
[1:14:16] The seed was woken up and I knew right
[1:14:19] there I was sold out for Christ. Amen.
[1:14:22] Oh yes, I was sold out for Christ. And
[1:14:25] here we are 30 years, some of us 33
[1:14:28] years later. Amen. And walking and
[1:14:30] seeking for this revelation to
[1:14:32] constantly be open up to us and unfold
[1:14:35] to us. We're seeking to overcome. Amen.
[1:14:38] To become more like Christ. Our hunger
[1:14:41] and our thirst is more for Christ today
[1:14:43] than it ever was. Why? Because a new
[1:14:46] birth bring me to a soldout position and
[1:14:50] condition way back
[1:14:53] there. I can't be sold out one minute,
[1:14:55] not the next. No, I'm sold out. I can't
[1:14:59] be born again and not born again. No,
[1:15:01] I'm born again.
[1:15:03] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Amen. I can't
[1:15:08] question my salvation. And yes, I make
[1:15:10] mistakes. I had to grow and understand
[1:15:12] that the seed of God is greater. The
[1:15:15] word of God is greater than the flesh.
[1:15:16] Amen. And I'm growing and understanding
[1:15:19] more and more. I still cry. I still
[1:15:22] repent. Amen. Of my weaknesses in my
[1:15:25] flesh. Amen. But that doesn't bring
[1:15:27] unbelief to who I am. Amen. It just
[1:15:30] makes me stronger in Christ. Amen. When
[1:15:32] I get weak, I I get weeping before the
[1:15:35] Lord. Amen. and I confess and I break
[1:15:38] down everything. Lord, search me and try
[1:15:42] me. Oh God, if there be any evil in me,
[1:15:45] take it out of me. Any thought, anything
[1:15:48] that I think, any way I speak, oh God,
[1:15:53] take it out of me. Amen. It's for this
[1:15:56] open book is for a peculiar people, a
[1:16:00] special called people, my brothers and
[1:16:01] sisters. You say, "Brother Tim, you're
[1:16:03] just up there yelling and screaming and
[1:16:05] this and that and making a big big
[1:16:07] rocket." No, I'm not. Somebody
[1:16:10] understands this.
[1:16:12] Somebody's experienced Christ in their
[1:16:14] lives this way. Amen.
[1:16:20] Amen. Glory to
[1:16:22] God.
[1:16:24] Amen. It's going to have to come inside
[1:16:26] of you, my brothers and sisters, as I'm
[1:16:28] going to start winding it down. come
[1:16:31] inside of you and
[1:16:32] possess you even your very thoughts as
[1:16:36] the scripture says bring every thought
[1:16:38] under the captivity of the word of God.
[1:16:41] What is it this revelation? We can't
[1:16:43] help the bird from flying over but we
[1:16:46] can help it from nesting. Amen.
[1:16:49] Unbelief. Amen. That bird was saying
[1:16:52] you're not the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:16:54] You're not what the Bible says the
[1:16:56] message says that you are. Amen.
[1:16:58] Hallelujah. That don't that don't land
[1:17:01] on my head. Amen. That don't land on my
[1:17:04] heart. But I bring every word, every
[1:17:06] thought captive to who I am. I'm the
[1:17:09] bride of Jesus Christ. I'm an elected
[1:17:11] seat of God. I'm called out. I'm a
[1:17:14] peculiar person. Amen. I've been born
[1:17:17] again and filled with the spirit of God.
[1:17:20] I'm on my road to heaven. I'm on my road
[1:17:23] to the rapture, a body change.
[1:17:26] I bring every thought captive to that in
[1:17:29] my life. Amen. And if doubt comes, doubt
[1:17:32] your doubts. Hallelujah. If Satan gets
[1:17:36] you and he's beating you on every corner
[1:17:38] of every doubt on every corner and
[1:17:40] you're getting confused. Yes, it
[1:17:42] happens. Doubt those doubts and start
[1:17:46] rising up and speak the word
[1:17:49] who you are in these last days. I'm a
[1:17:52] son of God. I'm a daughter of God. I've
[1:17:55] been called and elected to overcome you,
[1:17:57] Satan. Amen. You're going to be
[1:18:00] powerless before me. The gates of hell
[1:18:03] will not prevail against me because he
[1:18:06] has spoken it and he has come down and
[1:18:09] he's in me prophesying again.
[1:18:13] Hallelujah.
[1:18:14] There's prophesying going on. Lives are
[1:18:17] prophesying again. Amen.
[1:18:20] Hallelujah. Amen. Joshua 3:3. Look what
[1:18:24] Joshua when he was crossing over into
[1:18:27] the promised land. Amen. He commanded
[1:18:31] the people saying, "Yay, see the ark of
[1:18:34] the covenant with the word of God of the
[1:18:37] Lord your God. The priests and the
[1:18:39] Levites buried it, the five-fold
[1:18:42] ministry, then
[1:18:45] shall remove from your place and go
[1:18:48] after it. Don't stay in your place, your
[1:18:52] comfort zone. Amen. Go after that ark.
[1:18:56] Amen. Go after that revelation. Yes,
[1:18:59] sir. Keep going after it, my brothers
[1:19:01] and sisters. Don't stop. That's why the
[1:19:03] angel said to brother Brandham, "Keep
[1:19:05] pressing the battle. He was weak. He was
[1:19:08] tired. He was battle scarred." Some of
[1:19:11] us are the same way tonight.
[1:19:14] Hallelujah. But the angel said, "Keep
[1:19:16] pressing on. It's right beyond the other
[1:19:19] gates." Amen. Hallelujah. People are
[1:19:21] crossing over. Our sister we just heard
[1:19:24] crossed over. Amen. People are crossing
[1:19:26] over in a twinkling. In a moment of an
[1:19:30] eye, we're going to cross over.
[1:19:32] Hallelujah.
[1:19:34] Oh God, go after the ark. He says, that
[1:19:39] you may know the way by which you must
[1:19:42] go.
[1:19:43] Hallelujah. For you have not passed this
[1:19:46] way here. Therefore, and Joshua said
[1:19:49] unto the people, sanctify yourself, for
[1:19:51] tomorrow the Lord thy God was going to
[1:19:53] do wonders amongst you. I believe God is
[1:19:56] doing wonders amongst us. I mean every
[1:19:59] day, tomorrow, if you want to call it
[1:20:01] just tomorrow, but tomorrow, my brothers
[1:20:03] and sisters, God is going to do wondrous
[1:20:05] things when he starts thundering those
[1:20:08] seven thunders and start opening up the
[1:20:10] the final mysteries of the revelation of
[1:20:13] who we are. And the perfect faith is
[1:20:15] going to be starting to be released more
[1:20:16] and more to us. We're going to know who
[1:20:19] we are. Amen.
[1:20:22] Oh
[1:20:23] my glory to God. What hour are we living
[1:20:26] in? Where are we
[1:20:28] tonight? What's the spirit speaking?
[1:20:31] Amen. What is the spirit saying and
[1:20:34] testifying tonight? Not brother Tim.
[1:20:37] What's he saying? Where's God tonight in
[1:20:41] the present stage of his ministry in the
[1:20:44] bride of Jesus Christ in your life, in
[1:20:47] your experience? Amen.
[1:20:50] Hallelujah.
[1:20:51] Amen. Glory to God. I'm going to skip
[1:20:54] over some things here. I just want to
[1:20:56] talk about quickly. Hallelujah. I came
[1:21:00] across this and it just blessed my
[1:21:02] soul in Genesis 18 talking about Sarah
[1:21:06] which Sarah types the bride of Jesus
[1:21:07] Christ. You're Sarah tonight. Amen.
[1:21:12] Hallelujah. And they said unto
[1:21:14] him, who said unto him?
[1:21:18] Melazdc.
[1:21:20] Hallelujah. God himself.
[1:21:24] God didn't send anybody else to the
[1:21:25] bride of Jesus Christ in this day and
[1:21:26] age. He came
[1:21:29] himself. Amen. He's not he's not
[1:21:32] speaking to you through a third person,
[1:21:34] a second person. God individually comes
[1:21:37] to you
[1:21:38] himself. When when when when Sarah had a
[1:21:42] visitation, it was from God himself. And
[1:21:45] when we the bride of Jesus Christ gets
[1:21:47] visitations, Amen. It's not just from a
[1:21:50] feeling, an emotion, an experience. is
[1:21:53] from God himself. Hallelujah.
[1:21:57] And God visited Sarah and he said to
[1:22:00] Abraham, "Where is thy wife
[1:22:03] Sarah?" See, he visited Abraham many
[1:22:06] times before. And when he every time he
[1:22:10] visited Abraham, he came and brought a
[1:22:12] commandment to Abraham. Get out of thy
[1:22:15] country. Leave thy family. Go to a land
[1:22:18] where I'll show you. But you see this
[1:22:20] time here which really blessed my soul.
[1:22:23] This visitation was different to Sarah
[1:22:27] because it's already been
[1:22:29] spoken to from God to Abraham. Amen.
[1:22:34] That you were going to bear a son. Amen.
[1:22:37] Hallelujah. It was
[1:22:39] prophesied. Now when God is coming to
[1:22:42] fulfill that prophecy, Amen. He
[1:22:47] came and visit Sarah.
[1:22:50] Not
[1:22:51] Abraham. He spoke it to
[1:22:54] Abraham the prophet, but he spoke it to
[1:22:57] Abraham for Sarah. Sarah was the one
[1:23:00] that's supposed to bear the child. The
[1:23:03] seventh angel spoke the bride of Jesus
[1:23:05] Christ. And the prophecies over her.
[1:23:08] Amen. But now he's going to come and
[1:23:10] visit her. Not the prophet's going to
[1:23:13] visit the bride, but he's going to visit
[1:23:15] her. Yes, sir. And he said, "Behold, in
[1:23:18] the tent." And he said, "I will
[1:23:21] certainly return unto thee according to
[1:23:23] the time of life. And lo, Sarah, thy
[1:23:26] wife shall have a son, oh God."
[1:23:30] Hallelujah. This rapture, this this
[1:23:33] perfect faith is coming, my brothers and
[1:23:35] sisters, faster than you think.
[1:23:38] Hallelujah. And Sarah heard it in the
[1:23:41] tent door which was behind him. Now
[1:23:44] Abraham and Sarah were old and well
[1:23:47] stricken in age. We know the story,
[1:23:49] right? And it ceased to be with Sarah
[1:23:52] after the manner of woman. Therefore
[1:23:54] Sarah
[1:23:56] laughed within herself, saying after I
[1:24:00] am old and waxed, have pleasure with my
[1:24:03] Lord. You see, she was looking to the
[1:24:05] natural. She was looking to the flesh.
[1:24:08] She was looking at her circumstances.
[1:24:10] She was looking at the time of life, her
[1:24:12] age, his past. All the evidence was
[1:24:15] showing that she could not have a
[1:24:18] son. But God visited her because he
[1:24:22] prophesied and spoke that she's going to
[1:24:24] have a son. Oh,
[1:24:27] hallelujah.
[1:24:28] And the Lord said unto
[1:24:30] Abraham, "Wherefore did Sarah laugh,
[1:24:33] saying, Surely I of the surely bear a
[1:24:38] surely bear a
[1:24:40] child which am old." Is
[1:24:45] anything too hard for the Lord? Think
[1:24:49] about it. He came and visited her
[1:24:53] according to the time to fulfill his
[1:24:55] prophecy. She looked at all her
[1:24:58] circumstances, all her situation. Why?
[1:25:01] Because she didn't have the
[1:25:03] faith. The faith was not revealed to her
[1:25:06] then. Even though it was prophesied
[1:25:09] about her, she didn't have the faith.
[1:25:12] So, she looked at all these
[1:25:14] things and then the Lord said, "Is
[1:25:17] anything too hard for the Lord?" Listen,
[1:25:20] my brothers and sisters, it doesn't
[1:25:22] matter what you have gone through, what
[1:25:24] you are going through.
[1:25:26] Amen. How Satan has tried to to show you
[1:25:30] that your life could never fulfill
[1:25:32] what's being spoken
[1:25:34] here. God's saying, "Is anything too
[1:25:36] hard for me?
[1:25:39] Is anything too hard for the Lord in
[1:25:41] this hour, in this day, this age that we
[1:25:44] face, this life that we have here, this
[1:25:48] this Leoian church age, this battle that
[1:25:51] we're in, the greatest battle that's
[1:25:53] ever fought, the Lord's saying, I have
[1:25:56] prophesied all this stuff about the
[1:25:58] bride of Jesus Christ that you're going
[1:26:00] to bring forth a rapture, a body change.
[1:26:02] Is anything too hard for me? Hallelujah.
[1:26:06] Amen.
[1:26:08] Amen. Glory to God. He said, "At the
[1:26:12] appointed time, I will return unto thee
[1:26:14] according to the time of life, and Sarah
[1:26:17] will have a son. And I believe at the
[1:26:19] point of time, God is going to open up
[1:26:21] and thunder those seven thunders." Amen.
[1:26:24] And reveal what's left to be revealed to
[1:26:26] the bride of Jesus Christ. Look in
[1:26:29] Genesis 21 to uh 1. And the Lord visited
[1:26:33] Sarah as he had
[1:26:36] said. And the Lord did unto Sarah what
[1:26:40] he had spoken.
[1:26:42] Hallelujah.
[1:26:44] He visited her as he has said, and he
[1:26:47] did unto her that what he has spoken and
[1:26:50] prophesied that he'll do.
[1:26:54] There's no doubt, my brothers and
[1:26:56] sisters, amen, that God is going to
[1:26:58] fulfill his word in this day and age.
[1:27:01] Hallelujah. Joel 2:25, I will restore
[1:27:05] all the years of the locust has eaten
[1:27:08] the caterpillar, the cankerworm. It
[1:27:10] doesn't matter, my brothers and sisters,
[1:27:12] all the years of battles and trials. It
[1:27:14] doesn't matter with Sarah. All the years
[1:27:17] that the the body was being aged. Amen.
[1:27:22] The the womb was being destroyed.
[1:27:25] Hallelujah. God said, "I will restore."
[1:27:28] Sayeth the Lord. God is going to restore
[1:27:31] this bride, amen, to where he needs her
[1:27:34] to be to receive a body change, a
[1:27:36] rapture in this day. Now listen, as I'm
[1:27:40] winding right
[1:27:41] down, the Lord visited
[1:27:44] Sarah. And as he promised to do in every
[1:27:48] other visitation of Abraham, the Lord
[1:27:51] spoke and instructed and God said to
[1:27:57] Abraham. But this
[1:27:59] visitation, this last visitation, there
[1:28:02] was nothing
[1:28:03] said. Read it
[1:28:05] yourself. Nothing was
[1:28:08] spoken. Everything was in silence.
[1:28:12] The half an hour silence, my brothers
[1:28:13] and sisters.
[1:28:15] Everything was in
[1:28:17] silence. God don't need to speak nothing
[1:28:21] anymore. God has already spoken and
[1:28:24] prophesied. When he visits, he comes to
[1:28:28] do one thing. When he visits you, he
[1:28:31] comes to do one thing. He comes to
[1:28:34] fulfill and bring
[1:28:35] faith.
[1:28:37] Hallelujah. It was the half an hour
[1:28:39] silence. It was the third pull being
[1:28:42] revealed to Sarah. Now, now is time for
[1:28:47] Sarah to come into her own individual
[1:28:51] experience and receive her faith. Not
[1:28:55] Abraham, but Sarah had to receive that
[1:28:58] faith and bring her faith to receive the
[1:29:01] prophecies that was spoken over her. You
[1:29:04] see, she doubted, she laughed, she did
[1:29:06] all these things though the prophecies
[1:29:08] were spoken about
[1:29:09] her. But then she had to get that
[1:29:12] visitation, that third pull, that
[1:29:15] revealing of that word had to come to
[1:29:16] her as the musicians
[1:29:19] come. I was spoken. It was spoken over
[1:29:22] her. The Lord was coming to Sarah to
[1:29:25] fulfill these prophecies, especially to
[1:29:27] Sarah to give her faith to receive the
[1:29:29] body change. Hallelujah.
[1:29:32] That is her visitation. And everybody
[1:29:36] who receives their
[1:29:38] visitation receives faith. Now look at
[1:29:41] all in the book of Hebrews. Hebrews 11
[1:29:44] all talks about everybody who received
[1:29:46] their faith. Amen. And and it testifies
[1:29:50] of their faith and they came into that
[1:29:53] fulfillment. In Hebrews
[1:29:55] 11:11, look, it says right here,
[1:29:58] "Through faith also Sarah received
[1:30:01] strength to conceive seed."
[1:30:05] Hallelujah. All these
[1:30:07] years she could not conceive seed. She
[1:30:11] could not conceive the word, the promise
[1:30:14] that was spoken about her. Think about
[1:30:17] it. It was spoken about her, but all
[1:30:21] these years she could not receive it.
[1:30:23] But then when that
[1:30:25] visitation, hallelujah, to her
[1:30:28] personally came, she received faith. She
[1:30:32] received strength to conceive the seed.
[1:30:36] Amen. Because she judged him faithful
[1:30:40] who promised. Amen.
[1:30:42] Hallelujah.
[1:30:44] She went into that little room. She went
[1:30:47] into that tent. Hallelujah. where where
[1:30:51] where everything else is silenced, but
[1:30:53] she went in there. God called her in
[1:30:55] there. Amen. We don't know what
[1:30:57] happened. It's not spoken what happened,
[1:31:00] but all we know is she came out with
[1:31:02] faith. Hallelujah. She came out with
[1:31:05] that faith that she needed to receive
[1:31:07] that promise. Oh, God. When this bride,
[1:31:10] Amen, keeps going into that room, keeps
[1:31:13] taking that open book, Amen, she's
[1:31:16] continuing to receive faith. Faith,
[1:31:19] Amen. It's not explained. It's done in
[1:31:22] silence. It's done by personal
[1:31:24] visitation.
[1:31:26] Hallelujah. But then here she is just
[1:31:29] like
[1:31:30] Sarah receiving that seed in that little
[1:31:36] room. Therefore, leaving the principles
[1:31:40] of the doctrines of
[1:31:41] Christ, let us go on to perfection.
[1:31:45] Hallelujah. Let us stand.
[1:31:49] Amen. Brother Brandon speaking last
[1:31:51] quote
[1:31:54] here.
[1:31:56] Amen. In the token message, we are not
[1:32:00] to come together and talk about the
[1:32:02] message. We don't want to talk about
[1:32:05] it. We want to come together and get in
[1:32:08] the message. Become the
[1:32:10] message. That's what we're talking about
[1:32:12] tonight. becoming this
[1:32:14] message paying the price. I'll pay the
[1:32:18] price to become this word of
[1:32:22] God. I'll give my life as a sacrifice.
[1:32:25] I'll lay my life on the
[1:32:28] altar. I don't want to just know the
[1:32:33] message, know about it. I want to be the
[1:32:38] message. That pillar of
[1:32:40] fire, it's not about knowing. Brother
[1:32:42] Brandham, the quotes and all that stuff
[1:32:43] and putting it all together. It's the
[1:32:46] life. It's the pillar of fire. It's the
[1:32:48] life of the message. There's a life
[1:32:51] here, my brothers and
[1:32:52] sisters. And the message is Christ. He's
[1:32:55] the word. We're to get into it. Get
[1:32:58] beneath it. Yes, sir. That's what we're
[1:33:01] supposed to do. He's not responsible for
[1:33:04] any person out from underneath the
[1:33:06] blood. Not one. No matter who he
[1:33:10] is, he's not
[1:33:13] responsible. All had to take not only of
[1:33:17] himself but his whole
[1:33:19] family. There's only a safe. You're only
[1:33:22] safe when the token is on
[1:33:25] display. We cannot feel safe until this
[1:33:29] token is
[1:33:31] displayed. You hear what he's saying? We
[1:33:34] can't feel safe.
[1:33:35] [Music]
[1:33:38] That's right. You must come under this
[1:33:41] token, God's Holy Spirit, and it's
[1:33:44] displayed to you, Jesus Christ, because
[1:33:47] it becomes you and it lives inside of
[1:33:50] you. God is moving in so many
[1:33:53] supernatural ways in areas that no man
[1:33:56] can touch. We are getting ready to see
[1:34:00] something with our own eyes, and our own
[1:34:02] lives. It will be when the fullness of
[1:34:04] that capstone descends and cries grace
[1:34:08] graceal. That's when the fullness of
[1:34:11] grace will be made fully aware to the
[1:34:13] bride of Jesus Christ. And the prophet
[1:34:16] said we have only worked in a
[1:34:21] measure. We are getting ready to see in
[1:34:26] his
[1:34:27] fullness of what has been spoken.
[1:34:30] Listen, I'm getting excited because I
[1:34:33] see that the word of God is being
[1:34:36] preached all around. The five-fold
[1:34:38] ministry is breaking into this
[1:34:41] revelation according to the gifts and is
[1:34:44] breaking all over the bride of Jesus
[1:34:46] Christ. God is breaking it us to us
[1:34:49] here. I'm telling you right now, whether
[1:34:52] you see it or believe it or not, God is
[1:34:55] breaking this to us here now.
[1:34:57] Hallelujah.
[1:34:59] Amen. By his spirit, he's revealing.
[1:35:01] He's doing something. Amen. He's let
[1:35:04] He's sounding a trumpet. He's letting us
[1:35:06] know of coming events that's already
[1:35:09] been spoken. Amen. Hallelujah. He's
[1:35:13] bringing his visitation to us, just like
[1:35:16] he did to Sarah. Amen. Cuz he's going to
[1:35:18] come back and say, he's only going to do
[1:35:21] what he's spoken that he's going to do.
[1:35:23] Amen. She's going to conceive seed.
[1:35:26] She's going to conceive the faith that
[1:35:28] she needs for the rapture in this hour,
[1:35:30] in this day. Amen. Let us pray. Father,
[1:35:33] we thank you, Lord, for the word of God
[1:35:35] tonight. Lord, we know it's only not by
[1:35:38] might, not by power, but by your spirit,
[1:35:41] Father. Come, Lord Jesus, and visit us,
[1:35:46] Lord, in the time and season, Father.
[1:35:50] Lord, that we may receive the word of
[1:35:53] God that we need to receive in this
[1:35:55] hour. That our eyes of our understanding
[1:35:58] might be enlightened, Father. That the
[1:36:00] spirit of revelation and wisdom may come
[1:36:02] upon us, oh God. That we may recognize
[1:36:06] the hour and the time and the season as
[1:36:09] individuals. Amen. Who we are and what
[1:36:12] we're called to. So, as individuals, we
[1:36:15] can step out by faith. And as we all
[1:36:18] step out by faith on this word of God,
[1:36:21] hallelujah, then that's the bride of
[1:36:23] Jesus Christ. That's the rapture
[1:36:26] marching forth to the translation. Oh
[1:36:28] God, in this hour, granted, Father,
[1:36:31] bless each and
[1:36:33] everyone in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:36:36] continue to bless the ministry, our
[1:36:38] pastor.
[1:36:39] [Music]
[1:36:40] continue to lead and guide him in the
[1:36:42] word.
[1:36:43] Father, to inspire him, to strengthen
[1:36:47] him. Lord, he cannot do it on his own.
[1:36:51] We have declared and we have spoken that
[1:36:54] it's not done by man. Father, he's just
[1:36:57] a yielded vessel like I'm a yielded
[1:37:00] vessel. We're all yielded vessels,
[1:37:02] Father, to your spirit, to your will, to
[1:37:05] the portion that you place inside of us,
[1:37:07] oh God. Lord, we need you to come more
[1:37:10] and more and more.
[1:37:12] Father, separate us, Lord. Consecrate
[1:37:15] us,
[1:37:16] Lord, and dedicate us for this work that
[1:37:21] you have spoken in these last days.
[1:37:22] Grant it, Lord. In Jesus name we pray.
[1:37:25] Amen. God bless you saints. Amen.
[1:37:28] [Music]
[1:37:32] That day you set me free and made my
[1:37:39] heart is very
[1:37:43] true. My love is the one.
[1:37:48] I'm a prisoner of
[1:37:51] God. And now
[1:37:54] [Music]

[1:38:27] revelation on Calvary. On
[1:38:32] Calvary, he died to redeem his cross.
[1:38:38] the king of
[1:38:41] kings. He became my
[1:38:45] savior. This is God's great
[1:38:49] mystery of love
[1:38:52] expressed that Christ and
[1:38:58] I one.
[1:39:01] Oh, I
[1:39:03] [Music]
[1:39:05] am I
[1:39:06] [Music]
[1:39:08] am I can see
[1:39:12] now who I
[1:39:15] am, a part of my
[1:39:19] savior, a part of this world.
[1:39:24] It's a
[1:39:27] revelation of who I am. Oh, I
[1:39:31] am I
[1:39:35] [Music]
[1:39:53] am
[1:39:56] Revelation of who I am. It's your
[1:40:00] revelation. It's your
[1:40:04] revelation of who I am. It's
[1:40:07] predestination.
[1:40:11] [Music]
[1:40:17] Hallelujah. Ship off the old block.
