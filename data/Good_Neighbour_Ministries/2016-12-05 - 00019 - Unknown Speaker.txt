TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but [Music] they to the Seminary and out there they train you in all the various Sciences which I've outlined to you before esy horms pedagogy and this and that comparative religion a whole bunch of subject they start to train and all these things in the Greek and whatever and after they sure that you have now changed from just being a simple country boy into a refined elegant and persuasive speaker then they will certify ordain and calling to the ministry and when you call the ministry and you have your certifications from the organization then they will positionally place you in a parish or a church of their choosing God does the opposite God calls a man first when he's a partner with a STW in his mouth and a BL overalls arm amen he calls the man first right and then when he calls the man the guy learns of the job because sometimes the very people is preaching to criticize him right is that right also God allows the people to look at the minister and see the minister growing they're growing and the minister is growing and he's making his mistakes in front of them is that right right and that he's just a man like them and they see that while he is being trained Hallelujah and sometimes God makes the people deny him Titan offering so that he can go hungry sometimes and people telling him you don't need to to have a car you need to ride a [Music] bicycle sounds funny but it's the truth CU I know I've Been Told why you the car the bicycle you to be poor and humble so God continue to use you just stay right there of course that's not things that a general will hold against people you know they're saying that out of ignorance and blindness they don't know the word and they being inspired to talk like that but I'm saying it to you for your uh to teach you something amen praise the Lord and I'm a living example I'm not quoting from some post Master's quotebook quoting from the book book of experience or the book of human life say Amen praise the Lord but this is what happens God trains the man I've been in the church where people wants to live the church and instead of leaving peacefully they're up to me and their nose is touching my nose and they're speaking on the spittle and everything and I stand right there said yes sir yes brother I understand what God knows how to break you down and make you like a sheep I was born in under the sign of AUST where I supposed to be a lion king but instead God knows how to break you and mold you and shape you until you become like Mary's little lamb amen praise the Lord glory to God and that's what God does he trains you right on the job amen and you're in the ministry you're called You're trained and even though you are trained uh you know you say oh being trained being in the ministry you guys are already sent no that guy is not sent until that Ministry is matur and then the Holy Spirit says now you go out there amen and I'm going to be with you you don't have to say anything because when they attack you they're not attacking you it's me cuz now I got control of you amen now I I'm controlling the whole SE praise the lord it's like the first second P brother Brandon was operating those first two but when it comes to the third he said oh no this is got nothing to do with you when you sympathize with people or anything else like that because start going right to the soul amen and that's the revealed word amen is that right praise God hallelujah and you can't give them no Revelation you can only speak the word but you can't give them any Revelation I'm the one that will interpret my own word you be standing there and they still see the figure of Willam but it will be the voice of God these last days the voice of the sign how happy that we are under that kind of inspiration and we are speaking and living under the influence of another so you see I repeat the prophet wants to make sure we learn this principle God takes the simple things to identify himself through is that right amen what if you were to paint a white a cream painting on this beautiful wall here what are you going to see it's not going to really stand out but when God wants people the people to see him sometimes he'll make you even look bad he'll make you look dumb he'll make you look foolish he'll even allow people to persecute you so that they can see patience godliness brotherly kindness and all those virtues in you man no human being can stand there and take that that's impossible if it was me like one Pentecostal Minister told me I give him my right and I left and I thr it in the ditch that's a natural human reaction but after a while people recognize that just that's not natural praise the Lord after watching one of our sisters in here for a long while a woman walked up to her said are you a Christian never witnessed to the person never spoke to the person never really tell are you a Christian okay just smiled at the question the first time I didn't answer but then they go around in another long Circle and another day comes back and you got to be a Christian now they were certain than you they're preaching to you now you got to be a Christian in other words you can't act and live like that and not be a Christian you have to be one and then they finally give him their testimony praise the Lord you see you are the voice of God in these last days am you are the Living Word you are here to interpret the meaning of what love is what Grace is what patience is and so on and SW so you the living interpretation of word living Epistles and stuff praise the Lord amen hallelujah are you an apostle or an epistle little boy asked his mother what is a female to an apostle and she said I don't know he said are you sure it's not pistle say the darnest thing whatever he not wrong because an actual fact the brain is an epistle yes she is the word of God for this is that right praise the Lord look the Lord bless you real good we can we can continue uh floating down the stream of time like this forever and ever because we don't have long to stay amen but we know that we live in a body called time there was work that you have to go to tomorrow there's bed you have to sleep on tonight and uh uh uh you know you can only eat so much in a day right so when when you go to your neighbor's house and you eat eat he says after a while put like your TR doesn't to cut off your me you must know to stop to stop have some balance and everything else like that and I love the prophet but uh I'm not the prophet and I'm not trying to be like the prophet and I don't have to Pro to become spiritual by giving you 2 hours sermon is that right or 4 hours right or in 5 6 hours to make you realize that I'm really in the word praise the Lord now I'm saying that um I'm not casting off on anybody there's ministers that do that there are lot tons of them in Africa that do that cuz I seen them start in the morning and they're not finishing until the son of the do and the people are not moving they sitting right there they walk with a little thing beside and you know they will step away and they eat something drink some water use the bathroom come right back sit back down and the guy keeps going keeps going keeps going keeps going amen but praise the Lord Brother sister uh we under different inspir different cultures different uh different countries and there different things you know like that for instance how am I going to get you to walk for a week to come to church but yet when I was in the Sudan 3,000 people coming under a bunch of trees they don't have a building but they walk for a whole week because they hear this preacher is coming to preach to them they walk for a whole week and they're sitting on the ground all around praise the Lord and uh sometimes you can't get some Believers to walk across the street is that right some snowfall is it's not even nothing much in the ground man is cold praise Lord hallelujah or or or or or something like that look we not goats goat can sense the rain before start fall they run hide somewhere because and you know good smell keep I'm going to be like this teing tonight it's just going to keep going let's Hallelujah brother come here take up your cross and follow Jesus Hallelujah as we ease our way into this uh Christmas season into the spirit of Christ not the spirit of commercialism Amen is that right amen where we keep our eyes on the word we know the truth of what this is all about and we are happy at this time of peace and joy in the presence of the Lord hallelujah and they're going to be eating and drinking and we'll be eating and drinking but we rejoicing at something totally than what they're rejoicing over and as long as you can have that line of demarcation you'll be fine I realize as I'm closing to repeat myself it's a time when you may get opposition because the things you used to do you don't do them no more the friends you used to have you don't have them no more places you used to go you don't go there no more you may have some opposition but even in those opposition there's a seeds of opportunity for you to be able to share the testimony that God has placed in your heart God richly bless you let us pray
