TRANSCRIPT
========================================
guess what you are when you stand on the word of God and you receive the Holy Ghost you're the word for your day and if they rejected him back then those same Spirits are going to reject you or they're going to receive you just like when you receive the word of God you couldn't quite understand why it made sense to you why why because you were from eternity you were an act attribute of God that started in the mind of God in the in the presence of God that was an eternal thought and eternal means having no beginning and no end therefore you could not possibly miss the call because Jesus said all that the father in other words when you know people see he's talking to the father no he was in a human vessel but he was God that's why when Philip came to him says Lord show us the father he says Phil have I been with you so long do you not see when you see me you see the father but I'm I'm in a human form the father is the Eternal logos the god of Eternity the the all that filth it all remember the scripture that we read that God might give you the Revelation Ephesians 1 verse1 17 that God might give you the revelation of the knowledge of God and the understanding of who who he was you see how important it is to read the word of God and see what it is that God is speaking to you through the word of God you can miss these little nuggets but it's because you had the M you you were an attribute of God so you have to go back to God you cannot miss it my sheep hear my voice and that's why when you heard this message you were one in a million that's just the way it is you can't help that you can't change that I tell the people I can't something that I'm not this is who I am this is how I see the word of God this is what I believe this is what God is given me in this day I can't I can't deny the word of God Amen why because you came from eternity you're going back and how you going through a Rapture next slide and so we see that there was these seven Church ages it leads up to the seventh Church age in those Church ages there was different anointings right that's why you know the lion anointing right at the beginning they were bold the Christians were bold they received the Holy Ghost they went out there because God says okay time to bring my church home time to goow and call them all back and how was he going to call them all back through an anointing that he was going to place himself in the church and they went into the upper room and he says don't don't worry go there and Terry when I come back a on you in the spirit form you're all going to be anointed you're all going to have the power to go and to speak boldly preach this gospel into all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit and now if you remember in in in uh back in Matthew when he revealed himself to them he said it's I jesus this is after your resurrect and he said all power has been given unto me in heaven and on earth now if he's got all the power all how can you say the father Son and Holy Ghost when all the power was in in other words he was saying it's me it's me and what was his name Jesus he says now go into all the world Proclaim this Revelation that I've given you baptize in them in the name and he looked at them I could just see him looking at his children and they said yes Lord we know your name because the scripture says there's no other name that man must be saved by the name of Jesus Christ and in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit that was there and place there by Revelation and the carnal Christian out there takes that and says see there's a trinity there no all power was given to him to him and why did Peter on the day of Pentecost who was right there when Christ revealed himself and gave him that gave them the message to go out and preach this gospel baptizing them in the name listen my name is Daddy I am a father I am a son son and I am a human being but my name is Danny okay I have many offices and you have many offices God was Father Son and Holy Ghost but his name is Jesus Christ Jehovah savior the Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the New Testament hear ye oh Israel the Lord thy God is one Lord It's All Over the scripture you try and you know you try and talk to a trinitarian and they just keep telling you no that's not the way I see it and you have to say I understand because that's just the way they see it but if you've got a revelation then you're going to see what I'm talking about it's it's because it's plain and it's simple and that's why Peter on the day of Pentecost who had just received the commission from Christ goes out and you read it I tell people read it can you read me this right here acts 238 why did Peter on the day of Pentecost baptize 3,000 and read it to me how he did it so you're telling me that Peter rebelled against God when he said I bapti he said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ why didn't he say in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy why amen because he had a revelation that there was only one name that man must be saved by and those that receive the truth and have the Holy Ghost cannot go against this word you just can't do it you can't do it you just can't do it there's just no way and so Peter baptized them and every baptism in the New Testament every single one of them 8,000 over 8,000 baptisms every one of them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ this is important this is Bible study oh praise God he ain't going any further than where you leave Christ where you decide that you're going to disbelieve him and say not for me so when the time comes who is going to be responsible for rejecting the word of God you just got to let them know it's not you and you don't condemn anybody you don't tell them well you're going out because you know because that's not even true you don't know whether they're going to hell or not or anybody's going to hell it's up to God but what you see that's what you live that's what you believe and so there's these anointings that came through all these ages that and the calf age by the time you know we we were into the Third Church age we were into that that anointing of sacrifice and calf is is sacrificial you know and people died in the Dark Ages millions of Christians were slaughtered but they were under an anointing to die and fulfill the word of God for their time and their season and then came the Mad age by the time we came into Luther they were starting to teach the word of God and bring the people back to the word of God where they would by justification in other words your own personal understanding of the word of God because the the Catholic church had basically taken it and locked up the word of God and says hey if you don't do it the way we say you got to pay for this you got to pay for penants you got to pay for indulgences you got to pay for this and that and the people just they just obeyed it because of tradition and they figured oh we got to buy our way into heaven they're still doing it today but it's not the truth it's not the word of God and so man age was based on God now using man to reform and restore the word of God and then comes along the eagle age and God sends a prophet Eagle is one who can see beyond it's it's it's it has the ability to see higher than any other bird or anything else on this Earth that can fly gives the anointing to a William brandham to come and restore the word of God God gives him the Revelation to restore the word of God and give us Rapture in faith for the season then comes the opening of the seals the first the second the third we're winding down here we only got 5 minutes to go so this is takes us and then we come right to where the seventh seal is revealed and it gives us the opening of the word and the portion of the word that we need for our day which is Christ giving you rapturing Faith now in those seals wrapped up in all those seals if you keep going along you know it keeps showing everything that's going to happen from the 3 and a half years of tribulation the battle of armagan the Thousand-Year Millennium it shows the 70 weeks of Daniel as a prophecy right now notice that's where we seen her coming back to the millennial Temple over here at the end of the Jewish age the anointed he cometh the mighty conqueror yes sir to set up the millennium coming to the temple Glory theirs he meets that 144,000 and brother Brandon did a teaching on the on the temple right you got to keep moving along here with me uh go next right next in the temple and he showed how it was the the you know the three stages of justification sanctification and then receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost Christ himself now com com and filling you and giving you a revelation of the word let's move on and it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers exactly so we needed a prophet amen we needed a restoration of the word there's no possible way that you could have known which was the right Church where God was going to reveal himself next slide and so we get and this is the seven sealed book of redemption the book had to be open where our names would be spoken and revealed through the opening of The Seven Seals because all those whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life shall not be deceived this is the age where the greatest level of deception is striking the Earth there's never been more deception right and we're experiencing it right now in plain view where they've got fake news where you just don't know what is truth anymore it is total deception you think this one's got the truth you think this is the right president you think this let me tell you something president Trump okay is a placing of the word in order to fulfill a portion of Prophecy that will lead us into the culmination and bring this Dimension that we're in to a place where it will lead and directly bring this world into tribulation it cannot be stopped you cannot stop the prophecy of God's word in all these timelines that we showed you here okay these things must be fulfilled the book of Redemption on it there but it's to be revealed in the last days according to Revelations 10 these scriptures must be fulfilled amen praise God this book which is Christ it's Jesus Christ put together by God it's all Christ if you don't see Jesus Christ in every chapter in every verse and every line of the scripture you need to go back cuz he's all the way through it everywhere amen next slide next slide next slide just keep going we went through all of this go on you know I was going to get into each of the seals and each of the writers and and so forth but you need to go back and read the seven Church ages you need to go back and read the Seven Seals there's nuggets locked up inside there don't ever think oh I read it no go back and read it again go back and listen to it again there's things in there that God is revealing every single day amen and so you can see that the whole timeline now when you look at it in a complete cycle that leads us from the you know the the 2,000 years that Christ came on the Earth leading right up we are right now in that rapturing state once we leave here then things move on into the 3 and A2 years of tribulation we're in three and A2 years of honeymoon we go to the big wedding supper okay and then the battle of Armageddon takes place and then we enter into the millennial Reign Satan gets bound up and we come back with Christ we actually bind up Satan with Christ we come back to the Earth and we have theop bodies they're Eternal bodies they're bodies that will operate in this Dimension and in that other dimension because you're going to be you're going to be a super beam I love watching Superman cuz I'm going to do that one day just huah call me crazy whatever but I'm going to do that thousand- year Millennium Battle of Gog and MOG the white Throne judgment and then eternity you want to know about eternity and you want to know about what takes place there go back and listen to the Future home it's a glorious message praise God next slide and so it'll be like it was in the beginning a great Paradise of God that's what we're headed to Saints next slide and we can everyone set under our own let the piano player come up musicians and we can everyone set under our own fig tree and laugh and rejoice and live forever in his presence when he comes back as king and the wolf and the lamb shall feed together and the lion shall eat straw like the bulock they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountains sayeth the Lord in this glorious rain with Jesus of a thousand years of Peace the birds are waiting for that the trees are waiting for that all nature is bending and weeping and waiting for that time Amen brother Brown speaks here beyond the curtain of time friends you you just can't afford to miss that you just don't want to do it and I've seen the people the ones that's gone on I seen them there the old was young and they were standing there human beings just like I am only without sin it was beyond Perfection Sublime you just couldn't mention what it was whatever you do don't miss it don't miss it don't miss it you can't afford to miss it let everything else go but make ready for that whatever you do now according to the word of God the bride was chosen when before the foundations of the world this choosing of the bride was purposed in himself Ephesians 1:9 and in Romans 9:11 it says that the purpose of God according to election might stand you can't read it any other way the heart purpose the Eternal purpose of God was to take a people a bride of his own choosing and that purpose was in himself and being Eternal was decreed when before the foundations of the world and so we see this timeline that leads us into eternity in 1 Thessalonians 4:17 it says and so shall we ever be with the Lord are you looking forward to it get a little glimpse of it tonight you know I know we move through a lot of stuff real quick but I think it's important for us to be reminded through these studies what God has done what God is doing and what he will do and this way we know where we stand we know the hour that we're living in so share these things let them be tools of of uh you know testifying to people and letting them know you need to know what God is really doing in our day because that's where there's faith that goes beyond the faith that a lot of people talk about God bless you Saints I trust that you'll be blessed and that you'll go on and be a blessing and that you'll be encouraged through this teaching to share it with other people go back and read it go back and study it look through the seven Church ages read those Seven Seals God bless you brother Mike go ahead of these days these neighbors around here are going to say whatever happened to those people that used to come into that building I hope you're not still going to be coming to the building praise God let's all stand we'll sing I'm going home [Music] M I'm going soon I'm going where I
