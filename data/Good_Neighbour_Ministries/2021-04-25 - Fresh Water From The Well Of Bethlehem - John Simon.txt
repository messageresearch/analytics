TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good sunday morning friends it's good to be here with you again by god's marvelous and wonderful grace from the deserts of arabia my friends from the sweltering heat of the sahara from the humidity of of south america and of the islands of the sea we are here this morning to speak about uh fresh cool water from the well of bethlehem oh thank god for the fresh cooled water on a hot day when one is so thirsty and ready for a cool drink may the lord give us a refreshing this morning and may there be glory to his illustrious and marvelous name we ask it in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and amen around the world wherever you are and i say that because i receive emails from from kenya jamaica africa india different european countries around the world all praise god the word of god is going out and we thank him and praise him for it and may the holy spirit now settle down upon us rest his self upon us as we listen and watch and receive the word of god within our hearts let us pray just before we read the word of god our gracious father once again father we are honored to be able to approach the lord by the way opened up for us by the precious blood of christ may the great holy spirit of the living god so come down among us and upon us father may the anointing oil ran run down from the crown of my head father down to the souls of my feet that this entire human body mind and soul will be an instrument for your praise your honor and your glory that you may reflect yourself and reflect the word father through this facet of personality for we ask it in the name of jesus christ by the great holy spirit now amen bless the hearers wherever they are father and may the word of god spread out lord like fire fire fire the fires of god the reigns the refreshing soul cleansing reigns of the holy spirit father rain down upon us lord jesus and we give you glory and honor in jesus name praise god reading from samuel chapter 23 reading from verse 14 and david was then in and hold and the garrison of the philistines was then in bethlehem and david longed and said oh that one would give me a drink of water of the well of bethlehem which is by the gate and three mighty men break through the hosts of philistines and drew water out of the well of bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to david nevertheless he would not drink thereof but poured it out unto the lord god bless our hearts as we receive the word of god fresh water from the well of bethlehem oh praise god's wonderful name i re i i would like to recap so that we get ourselves in the stream of the word of god remembering how that david running hiding dodging from saul a fugitive in his own land just as much as the true genuine anointed word of god for this hour has in this day while denominations rule like king saul ruled at that time that the true word is found as a fugitive in his own land coming to his own and they received him not but unto them that received him to them gave he the power to become the sons of god oh blessed be his name so here was david in the cave of abdullah thirsting for a drink of fresh water and his mighty man catching his thought like we catch revelation or the thoughts of god catching his thought from his uh soliloquy of speaking to himself oh that i would get a cold fresh drink of water from that well of bethlehem oh praise god may god give us a fresh drink of water from that well of bethlehem today that we might praise and glorify him and pour out ourselves in service to our king forever and ever and so three mighty men heard him adino eleazar and shama heard him and fought their way through 18 miles of the philistine hosts to get to the well of bethlehem at the gate of the city that they might bring david fresh water from that well of bethlehem now david's mighty men did not think or even say to themselves oh uh bethlehem is too far um you know uh david what wouldn't know any different we will stop some where at some pool or some cistern uh rock cistern by the way and we can get that water because uh water is water and we will just bring that back and we'll give that to david let's just go to a nearby place and uh rock cistern and get some water you see because that's important praise god doesn't matter if we get the water from somewhere else other than the the the well at bethlehem's gate it's still water but you see where you get the water from is important and what kind of water that you get is important also ah you may say oh it's too far for me to get to the church to hear and receive the true word of god maybe i can stop at a denomination or stop with the church close by because they're preaching the bible to they're preaching from the word of god i believe that water i can drink that water too but let me say this to you my friends where you get your water from is important and what kind of water that you receive is also important because you see sweet water there is bitter water there is alkaline water there is hard water there is soft water and there is my friends different kinds of water but you see david wanted just like our god wants to have specific water from a specific place water cool fresh water from the well of bethlehem i tell you friends god's got a people that's going to drink from that well even if they have to fight their way through every test and trial of satan to get to the fullness of the word they're gonna press the battle and fight their way through the armies of hell and find their way to receive the word of god hallelujah you may say you're crazy to go down there among the armies of the philistines you'll say to that believer you're crazy to go to those people or to that church or where they're preaching that word of god hallelujah brother sister i tell you i don't care if i'm called a fool if i'm called crazy if i'm call out of my mind i want that kind of blessing i want that word of god i want that revelation fresh coming down like manna from the heavens above glory to god from let me tell you i'm glad i serve a god that has a bakery in the sky just give me fresh bread for my soul praise god hallelujah thank god amen give me bread where there is no bakery oh my america working god almighty god same yesterday today and forever oh praise god crazy i'm crazy about jesus christ i said i'm crazy about jesus christ hallelujah if i if they're gonna call me a fool call me a fool for the word of god but i want you to understand preaching like this speaking like this i am not and we are not against the people that are in those denominations what we are mainly speaking and touching about is the system the evil system created by satan under guise of religion that is used as a a net to trap and capture the people under his spell oh my and bring them under his spell until they'll fight for a church rather than to stand up for the word they'll fight for a denomination rather than to stand for jesus christ and the revealed word of god for the hour but i'll strain for jesus hallelujah and he'll stand for me he'll stand for us praise god hallelujah oh praise god when we come let's come believing because even after some people hear this kind of preaching when they come some of us are going to use it use the washing of the water of the word of god as washing water to wash our souls wash our lives watch our wash our lifestyle wash our walk watch our wash our talk hallelujah and let the holy spirit bleach us by the bleach blood of jesus christ and make us white and snow or i can say as white as the inside of the coconut but white god that just symbolizes god wants to make you pure and clean by the washing of his word oh glory be to god hallelujah praise god we are not against the people we are i said we are not against the people the people but we are against the system that is barring or keeping the people away from the word of god the revealed work oh don't go over there that crazy man is preaching over there look those crazy people over there those people are this that you see they call jesus name they even say you're bastard born you're up the devil you're this is that oh my your father name he says do you know my father can you tell his name he was the i am in the burning bush of fire praise god oh hallelujah and jesus is his name oh praise god hallelujah amen yes they're trying to hinder object and the bar the children of god from getting to the word of god hallelujah but that's true warriors of jesus christ may we take the word of god and shop every way we can like real warriors of the lord and bring ourselves out and bring us many out as we can for his glory we are not here to proselytize but we are here to preach the word we are here to justify we are not here to go into somebody else's church or and make trouble or or or whatever that's not what we are supposed to do but if somebody asks us a man if somebody is interested there and they see you know have inquisitive nature about them curiosity to discover what is this then we'll say this is that spoken by the prophet william marion branham this is that spoken by joel this is that spoken by peter on the day of pentecost the real genuine original peptic cost of blessings that oh i want that kind of blessing upon my heart and upon my life amen we're gonna cut our way through every devil we we have to get to that well to have a cool fresh water so that when we come back to david oh are the real david we can bring him a fresh cool drink of water oh praise god hallelujah amen we look around and what do we see the old cistern world consulate churches made up of churches some founded 300 400 they're bosting about how old how old an ancient the the church is and when it was founded amen oh praise god but we are not here to know world consulate churches we are here to restore back the fresh water the fresh water that comes from the well of bethlehem not from a denomination but from bethlehem's world praise god brother sister let's not take a creed let's not take any old stagnated smelly water coming from some man-made cistern that they dig out or form and make it looks nice painted on the outside but it's nothing but a system amen they're drinking water that fell forty fifty hundred two hundred three hundred years ago amen some of them are drinking looter and water the drinking baptist water the drinking the you know church of god water adventist water jehovah witness water catholic water they're drinking all kinds of waters from these polluted cisterns water that fell from years ago that they're trying to preserve and conserve amen but what we want is the word of god falling for today glory to god yes sir but you see little bethlehem is rejected hallelujah that you rejected friends hallelujah but that's the word we want little bethlehem is rejected what we preach today what we declare in the name of the lord is rejected oh bless his holy name o praise god i wanna thank god that there are still wise men and women today because three wise men when the word jesus christ was born hallelujah three wise men were led by a star moving overhead led them and brought them to bethlehem's gate oh glory to god hallelujah i want you to know those three wise men did not know each other it's usually told as if they knew each other and they set out together no they came from different amen oh india persia hallelujah they come all the way not knowing one another each one seeing that star moving mysteriously overhead and the star led them they met or united or came into a oneness at bethlehem's gate where the water of that well was and they went to worship the christ child all glory be to god hallelujah my friends how blessed it is to walk with god and many times we find out what we preach and what the messenger delivered pass over the people's head and it's right there but they're not seeing it it's passing over their head right in front of them we're looking at it we see it bright and clear they're looking and they see nothing for they say what are you talking about oh praise god but i want a fresh drink from that well of bethlehem now last week i told you there's a big difference between a cistern and the well you see a cistern is a place dug in the ground to take the place of a well they may dig a cistern to take the place of a well because where people don't have a well they'll go and they'll dig a cistern in other words a cistern is a man-made tank it's a man-made uh area in the ground to catch water from man to use and then dig it out amen oh praise god some may use it for washing some may use the water of the word for drinking and others in different ways i love the water because i loved swimming like ezekiel oh praise god hallelujah and sometimes the waters fill the system system you have to go with your bucket oh or connect a pipe somehow to that cistern to be able to get the water to you or you're going to have to some have to get some kind of a pump where you can pump it up pump it up pump it up you know i could say jump it up jump it up jump it up trying to pump up the holy spirit to pump up the anointed word of god to pump up the purity of the word of god oh praise god friends i tell you a sister is different completely from a well first of all a cistern can get dry and empty when the dry weather comes it can dry out amen just like some of these religious organizations dry times come and the well dry up the brook dry up nothing there to drink oh my and you see another thing about the cistern a cistern can't refill itself it has to wait on the rains to come or someone to come and put water inside of it oh it's it's not reliable at all you can't rely on a cistern amen because the cistern itself has to wait on rains to come and fill it and so on and so when the dry season comes or in north america the winter comes upon us then the snow might run off when it unfreezes and some water will then get in to the system other than that you don't have any water and your cistern will dry up and can't refill itself amen it's got to wait hallelujah and when the rains do come when the holy spirit does genuinely fall then the genuine holy spirit or the rain falls on top of the roofs of the houses and then the rain washes off the roof and washed off from all the roofs all the bird down oh my washes down all the dead insects wash off of that old roof that they have there amen being in a church is a form of protection to some people being it at least keeps them from the from the weather uh like that but when the raves come it washes off the bird droppings washes off all the dead insects and it got to pass through a church board it has to pass through a man-made spout before it can get into their church tank ah before it is approved or recognized before you are allowed or authorized to be able to drink from that tank but listen to the true believer they look at the word and they look at that and they can see that all the filth gathers right there the same water gathers all kinds of filth and brings down all kinds of germs in the old days when they burnt the cane and burnt the fields the rain will bring down all of the black stuff and everything else that will fall into that water and mess it up in every way and sometimes you look into your sister and what do you see there is water frogs jumping about because they're happy that they're in some water but the water is cistern water and they're jumping and croaking and hollering and whatever else in that water and you look again and you'll see there is water lizards and they're they're running around in that water they're happy in that water that gather in there and the water keeps standing and standing there and then you're going to see what the spiders when you look some more that that balls begin to be inside of the very water every one of them an unclean animal or kinds of those things in there hallelujah but you know what do you know paul's can't live in real clear clean water it's too clean for them they can't live in it the water's got to be a little start to get a little bit cloudy they'll start when it is clear but then the water starts digressing and going down and they love that water when they can play around dance around move around oh my praise god they love it better when the water goes to the stage or state of stagnation when that water gets the stagnation then they know well on this day we pray these prayers on this other day you know we're stagnated right there this year this is the the preaching for this day this month this year it's all there and if it's not like that then the preacher has his routine that he goes through in every possible way amen and that is the same with a lot of the religious parasites oh my the try to gather together in their church tank in their organization will take they come together amen but there are parasites in that water that will make you sick if you drink that kind of a water that can't live in genuine fresh cool water from bethlehem's well or from the holy spirit that's not the water they want to live on they want to live in a religious atmosphere where they can duck and dive and hide and and like that and still carry out and carry on with some deeds and different things oh my but they don't want the fresh cold water oh my lord jesus oh hallelujah and that makes them want to fight and come firmly against this word of the holy spirit and say there's nothing to that i heard that before or it's contradiction itself there want to spread all manner of lying rumors and all matters things about the genuine word of god hallelujah because uh you see they're trying to stagnate what the word is doing they're trying to stop it and stagnate it so they can create the atmosphere that they can live in and mix in themselves within the moving of the world because they need a stagnated pool to be able to live and to be able to carry on what they want to do they want to be able to wiggle about we go this way and wiggle that way we end up having a lot of religious politicians that will put the as we say in in a regular talk that they put their mouth where the soup is dropping they put their mouth where soup is coming down oh my friends i don't want that i want to put my mouth at the glory spout where the blessings are pouring out and the holy spirit of the living god is running down with fresh anointed word of god for this day time an hour amen glory to god hallelujah that's the way it is with frogs you talking about frogs lots of frogs in christianity lots of spiders waiting to catch some fly that's passing by lots of lizards inside of your cistern there's a lot of mosquitoes shaping up forming inside of your cisterns and tatpoles also hallelujah oh praise god until there whoa we've got a big church we've got thousands of people around the world yes you've got a large swamp you've got a large magos you've got something large enough for crocodiles lizards snakes and everything to live in but this word of god oh hebrews 4 12 is quick and sharper than the two-edged sword glory to god a discerner of the heart and the thoughts hallelujah and discern you and clear you out my brother sister so that's what's happening they want to go live in a swamp they want to be associated with a stagnated pool amen oh they're okay with growing in numbers they're okay with growing in numbers but when it comes to the word of god expanding exploding and growing and moving in a mighty way like that amen it's they don't want that because it's not their nature to live there they'll their nature is to run back to the mud they come from their nature is to get into the swamp swamp creatures amen that want to go there and you can't change the animal amen till the nature and that animal is transformed oh praise god you can't make a make a man see the word until his nature has been changed or he has come to see what his real nature is oh praise god and when god wakes him up to realize who he is and where he comes from lord of god he don't want to slop around with the pigs no more he don't want to slap around with the spiders and the frogs no more and tap poles and snap stagnated pools of water all over the place no he doesn't want to do that amen brother sister he wants to know he's a son a daughter of god and the holy spirit of god has come to him amen the one that wrought the word has now come to me in my life to reveal to me his word the author of the book is the best person i can ask about the book and i'm here talking to the author asking him to reveal the book amen and i want to live close to the author of the book so that the book can reveal and i can know amen what is in the book and i believe the author of the book for he is his own interpreter about what he wrote amen god is his own interpreter he will make it plain to you only believe all things are possible to them that believe amen praise god denominations are nothing but stagnant pools nothing but slimy bug water my brothers and sisters they're pools of swamp lands where men deacons even preachers call themselves christians and then men can still go and live with women in the church outside of the church and still claiming christianity and then you have them women in the church oh i'm a sister i'm a missionary i am this i am that and them women living and carrying on with man and claiming to be christian oh my living in the church when god says a woman's here is her glory and she's not to cut off her hair oh my they do that and they don't care nothing about it yes they're in their pants they're shorts all of their tiny little clothing at their where when god says that she should not put on anything amen that pertains to a man and then they you know they shave off their eyebrows pluck out their real eyelashes and they get the fake ones put that on and then they they try to make themselves look so sophisticated while they they they take a a man-made pencil and then they're going to go in front of the mirror and they're going to paint on an eyebrow god gave you a natural eyebrow why you got to shave it off and then paint it back on oh friend you're far from the word you're far from the spirit of the lord back to the word of god don't let the devil take you off the pattern of god's word stay with the blueprint build it the way that the great builder has produced it amen they want to go out calling themselves christians i passed by a certain church and there was a pastor's wife leading a bunch of women coming out to the church doors they're going for a christian swim together and they're going to a pool by the side of the road oh let me not say like it was directly beside the side of the road it was in the churchyard but visible to all passes by and they were all in their bikinis going for a lovely swim oh may god have mercy wearing all kinds of tight jeans and slacks wearing all these types of things arm-less blouses and if they bend over or lean a certain way it's nothing but sex exposure dressing deliberately set up to seduce and to attract man and to become a man trap rather than a daughter and child of the king walking in the light of the world and when god is ready to make a way for you or i man or woman he'll make a way amen hallelujah lord of god tank tops the men too wearing all kinds of tight pants oh god have mercy tighter and tighter pants women tighter and tender dresses on the women trying to show off their real estate their real condition oh their real spiritual condition yes sir and as they they walk with the walk as if they're waltzing uh in the west indies or in africa they will say like they're whining or i will tell you according to this bible they're moving and like their hips and their bodies even some men do it like a snake they're moving like a snake my brother's sister twisting like a snake on their high-heeled shoes god have mercy upon this world in which we live today but thank god there is still fresh water from bethlehem's well from which we can drink from that genuine fountain of life hallelujah and receive the power of god hallelujah because the power of god just pushes out it pushes its way and said i am the fountain of living waters they left me the word to go and and dig cisterns for themselves and look where they are in laodicea look the condition what they are in where nothing holy nothing true nothing genuine no seed of god can live in such an atmosphere or in such a state back to the word my children back to the hour that we are living in receive him oh praise god hallelujah praise the living god a cistern but let me tell you a well is like a fountain of living water a fountain of living water is not just of a fountain what a a man-made fountain but my friends a real fountain of living water is an artisan well an artisan well oh praise god oh you say what is that kind of a well well it is well or water coming from beneath the earth from the rivers underground rivers that are passing under the earth that is where the artesian well comes from and it pushes its water right to the top through the earth and it's flowing all the time an attention well is self-supporting it doesn't have to wait whether it's dry wheat season or it's winter season or some other season it's always in season oh praise god no wonder the blessed man or woman could plant their roots by the rivers of living waters hallelujah amen and they can drink and drink and drink and live and bear fruit in god's season and for his glory hallelujah it's not something that's dead it's living waters rainbow trout can live in those waters hallelujah jumping moving living rejoicing rainbow trout seven colors of the rainbow oh praise god shouting praising god and bringing glory to his marvelous name because we are worshiping him in spirit and in truth oh you say oh we worship just like they worship no they worship no they know not what they worship no they're under some trinitarian spell they're under some other spell oh my but we are worshiping god with the same holy spirit but the difference is with the truth the revelation of the clear understanding issuing out of the word of god the water pushing its way out glory to god hallelujah foundaines of living water hallelujah constantly doing what not the same water recycle over and over we're not talking about recycled water we're talking about living water where it's constantly fresh it's constantly new and different bringing up something new all the time moving on and coming up from an unseen resource bringing up all the word of god from that dead rock where it is coming from hallelujah self-cleansing well self-cleansing artisan well water cleaning itself supporting itself bubbling up all the time and giving its water free hallelujah the water coming forth free you don't have to go by that well and all they're talking about is this money that money money for this and money for that and money for the pastor's birthday and money for the the bishops uh uh the anniversary and money for the church this and money for that well we know that you you need to support your local church we know you need to support your pastor but this incessant uh lust for money my friend is just like the desire of a harlot to the word of god harlots standing by every street corner looking to receive money oh lord have mercy has religious faith gone that law back to where you come from back to the word of god back to the original faith do you think you're gonna find peter going in the church begging for peter's pants or peter's dollars or uh or some spare special miracle money or or something you do you think you're gonna find the apostle paul selling a miracle wallet and if you were to buy one of my miracle wallets whenever you have it in your pocket it will always have money in it and you'll never be short of money send for one of my miracle wallets and when you're sending send fifty dollars that's how they talk they're selling the wallet and they tell you it's a free wallet but remember to send an offering and and the first thing about it is this that if that wallet is so miraculous that money is always going to be in it money filled up in it then why don't you keep the wallet to pay for your ministry and all the things that you have to do miracle water miracle wallet miracle clock miracle this miracle that everything else and then the people are buying these fetishes buying all these little pieces of things miracle cross miracle this miraculous from from the cross at calvary and if you find all the miracle nails coming up in all these various ministries and churches it'll fill up truck loads of the same nail if you find the pieces of wood from the cross of calgary and put it together you can have enough wood to stock a sawmill god have mercy upon us what a disgrace that the church has wandered away from the fullness of the word of god and into fantasies and nonsense for this day amen hallelujah yes sir oh you don't have to pump water up from an adjacent well the well is already pushing the water out like that from the time you break the ground around it the dirt around it the water pushes itself out around that and gives itself free i won't spend my time on that but you can take that thought it's free of charge whatsoever praise the lord hallelujah amen and there it is friends you don't have to wind up the well you don't have to pump up the well you don't have to get all kinds of music and depending on the music to beat down the holy ghost drum him up and call him out and bring him down like this way or that you got to wind up the wind up wind up wind up when you wind up there spring then you lose this loose it and then the toys all just start to walk start to move start to move and when the spring gets low the whole thing has gone down but thank god we don't have to wind this up we don't have to pump it up we don't have to do anything of that we rest and rely upon the word of the living god because it's the fountain of living word living waters hallelujah from the presence of the living god with no winding no twisting no pumping but the preaching of the word reveals itself to us and we can't help ourselves it make us want to laugh and make someone to cry others want to sing oh praise god hallelujah others quietly weeping in their seats oh my other ones their thoughts look you oh their thoughts going in every direction because the holy spirit is working and moving in our midst and up in the heart hallelujah the function of god giving living waters you don't have to go in there and think you got to pray it down or you got to do this or that oh my but the true children of god they can drill down in the word in their bible until they hit the hidden springs under the earth and the water from the hidden rivers they're going to spring up oh hallelujah and then you can walk in it like ezekiel let me give you the chapter and verse ezekiel 47 verses 1 to 12 when the water comes out the level of the water keeps going higher higher higher the bible said it went to his knee then it come up to his right up from his ankle then it came up to his knees and come up to his ties then come to his waist then to his chest the bible said until ezekiel had so much water to swim in oh glory to god may god cause us to come under this anointing of the holy ghost until we have enough waters to swim in praise god hallelujah i tell you when a man hits oil on his land and the oil gush comes out or that man gets so excited oh my but when a child of god man woman young person oh drill down in the word come in the house of god and the word of god is going forth and they see the word making itself manifest oh praise god they are even excited because of the word of god somebody said how can you get excited over the world oh my but if you can see what i am seeing you'll rejoice in the house of god and in the presence of almighty god something got a hold of me oh praise god and what got a hold of me is the holy spirit of the living god praise god hallelujah amen i was talking about those wise men and how that star went before them passing overhead it passed overhead over jerusalem none of them seen it all but these wise men saw the star and they followed the star thank god he's caused us to recognize the star messenger of this hour thank god we recognize the twinkling of the star the message of the star we've caught the revelation of the last prophet's message we know who we are and what we are raised up for oh praise the lord that in us is the original seed life of the living god the attributes of the most high in our being praise god hallelujah amen that mighty mystery of god working in us amen that's the same thing today no one seems to understand no one seems to be able to catch it it's passing right over the top of their heads and they can't see it and you are looking at it and you can say when you look what do you see oh what when he looks what does he see when she looks what does she see oh i hope you're seeing what i'm seeing because i'm seeing the word of god making itself manifest the word passing over the tops of the people's heads and they're not even recognizing what the lord god is doing today they'll say to you who is this who who is that who would you think that word is oh do you catch it i i can't seem to catch it i i can't seem to grasp it hallelujah oh my that's what god is doing right now in spiritual bethlehem passing over hallelujah praise god and is moving the wise of this hour wherever they are they come from the east and west they come from the lands of farm to feast with the king to dine as his guests how blessed these pilgrims are beholding his high lord face by revelation aglow with light divine the word is lit up by the holy spirit oh bless partakers of his grace gems in his crown to shine oh glory be to god hallelujah while it's passing over the heads of the people you are receiving it right within your heart and god moving all the wise men wherever they are wherever they're scattered i don't know them they don't know me we never met we never seen each other but you know the spirit of god by supernatural operation bringing them together from east from west from the north and from the south and those men met where what was the meeting place at bethlehem's gate by the well what is the missing beating place today the opening of the word is what unites our hearts brings us together inspires us anoints us with the word of god today hallelujah amen amen hallelujah oh praise god wonderful wonderful jesus he is my all both great and small he gave his life to redeem me oh this jesus this precious precious jesus oh praise god brother sisters may god bless the word upon your heart you know of course i feel so blessed so incited so anointed that i can go on and on and that's marvelous but we're doing this broadcast to be able to reach you wherever you are you may be isolated far away in the desert up in the mountain in the woods in the jungles
