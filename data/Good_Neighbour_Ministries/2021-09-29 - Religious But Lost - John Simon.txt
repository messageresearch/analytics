TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] here we are once again in the house of the lord my friends my brothers and sisters in christ i am happy to be here with you and to rejoice with you to feed on god's word together with you together with the other lilies of the field in service for our king may the lord jesus bless you richly and enlarge your tents may the spirit of god feed us all together lambs and sheep on followers of jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever our study continues our study in the uh church ages and our topic for tonight is religious but lost and our scripture is found in revelation chapter 3 verse 5 he that overcometh this same shall be clothed in white raiment and i will not blot out his name out of the book of life but i will confess his name before my father and before his angels let us also read first corinthians chapter 10. verses 1 to 7. moreover brethren i would not that you should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and were all baptized onto moses in the cloud and in the sea and they'd all eat the same spiritual meat and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and the rock was christ but with many of them god was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted neither be ye idolaters as were some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play praise god for the marvelous wonderful reading of his word righteous father we ask your blessing upon us your blessed word is before us and now we ask your blessing upon us to understand to speak and for the hearers to be inspired to receive what is being sent forth from thy storehouse father i'm just here to be a voice for the word uh and to give voice to this written word may the great holy spirit bless us together and galvanize our attention that we may look away and see jesus only that he may be glorified in his wonderful splendor in jesus christ's name amen and amen of course the story of israel we want to take this story of israel leaving egypt and apply it in the sense of showing us from our last talk about judas and the spirit of judas and how judas acted to show that spirit was coming down through the ages we want to grab your attention at this point of how it acted and moved amongst and upon the tribes of israel when they left egypt for canaan and of course god's purpose for bringing israel out and as i like to say god did not bring israel out to leave them to wander about and god did not bring us out uh leaderless without a guide without anything just to wonder about but god brought israel out that he might bring them out to bring them in that they might love him and serve him that he might bless them praise god in out out in blessed by the grace of god through service to our glorious and marvelous king now when they all left egypt of course they're all left with good intentions when they left when when we came out of the world we came into christ we came into the church we came into the message all with good intentions that we were going through no matter what others do we're going to pay the price with god's despised few and no matter what happens i'm going through with jesus praise god hallelujah our faith is not in any man or faith was not is not and never will be in any man but our fate rests upon the rock foundations of the revealed word jesus christ himself glory to god but notice even though all came out of the world all of israel came out of egypt with the same wonderful intentions of going all the way to the promised land yet we find paul is magnifying this truth and saying when they left egypt they all came out under the blood amen they all came out under the blood of the sacrificial lamb they all came went through the waters of baptism in the red sea they all enjoyed the mighty miracles signs wonders in the wilderness all of the blessings of god all of them at manol in the wilderness and they all drank from that spiritual rock of which paul said that rock was christ they enjoyed all manner of blessings miracles signs wonders the pillar of fire became like an every night of fear the pillar of cloud and everyday affair he was there to lead them for the angel of god was in that cloud leading god's people guiding them to the promised land and they all partock they all each one had equal access to all the blessings of the living god but when they got to bail pure all of them died as the bible tells us in first corinthians in the old testament it tells us they died in the wilderness the carcasses fell there for it was there at bialpur they refused the word of god they turned away from the words of the great jehovah and sought their own way we know the the way of a man amen it it leads unto death amen praise god they went away from the word of god hebrews 6 1-9 says there my friends in the pergamos age that once we tasted the things of god the marvelous wonderful truths and revelations of god and uh we we walk away from that then then we go on to commit them pardonable sin and it's hard for one such one to be restored again because of all intent of own desire refuse the word and turn away from it listen praise god hallelujah you see god has always required that you don't just take part of the word that you like or the part of the word that is all love and sweetness or all of the word that you can reason in your mind over with but my friends we are required of god to follow all of the word even when we don't fully understand it jesus asked the disciples do you understand it no he did not ask us a question he asked do you believe it amen now it may not hit your five senses on the outside but does it hit the man on the inside does he believe it or praise god god's looking for real believers people that will go all the way not just be religious to a certain point or position and then after that fade away into the great unknown yes my friends when they got the moab and they came up to against the appeals of the god bail pr there we find that they died in the wilderness now if we're to play that today there are people who seem involved in the things of god up 100 but they're like judas iscariot amen remember no one but jesus himself knew who judas was and what his purpose was being in the midst amen jesus knew that person of judas and so the day came along that judas did exactly what israel did at beyond beyo he decided that he didn't want to associate any more with with moses and with israel and and and the people of god uh you know scrabbly people going in the wilderness and he dissociated himself with them whatsoever see he didn't want to join or to remain with the people of god but he joined himself to the false vine forces and those are the false vine so that he could enter into better financial conditions and i'm quoting right from the church age and also political organizations started to come into view but we know that well that is absolutely anti-word amen and it's also anti-christ amen but judas did it anyway he was fooled but the 11 were not fooled but they held to god's word and they held because they were elected and predestinated for that purpose hallelujah judas left by leaving you know he betrayed the lord he gave a wrong testimony of who jesus and his people and his disciples were and there he betrayed him amen and the bible tells us revelation 22 19 revelation 3 where it tells us i will blot his name out of the book of life amen praise god amen now i want you to notice those names and his name was in there as a a record of a religious or religious order of people amen and these people were religious they were good people but remember their worship centered around the true god and they worship the true god and glorified the true and the living god hallelujah but they did not worship him with the right spirit and in a revelation or having a revelation of the truth amen and like judas he did not go all the way hallelujah you see the bible says jesus said have not i chosen you but one of you is a devil you see he was chosen by jesus christ and the bible yet says he was a devil but remember my friends that this choosing which i will touch on in a moment for judas was chosen of god he was instructed in the ministry or in the preaching of the word in the things of god not by the bishop the archbishop the superintendent or even by me it was by the lord himself judas was under his instruction and it did him no good he also shared in the knowledge of the mystery amen and there it was that he was allowed to come on the border land of getting a knowledge of the mystery but not a revelation of the mystery of god so chosen for a purpose just like the lying spirit of first kings 22 20 to 23 when that lying spirit came up before the lord and said lord um uh uh let me go down i'll get in the mouth of ahab's prophets and i'm i'm gonna lie through them the spirit asks god if he could go down to do the job or fulfill the purpose of a liar and god permitted him so the word chosen and permitted could be used at that point we can look at it judas was permitted to betray the lord jesus christ and there it is i want you to illustrate that again in the book of job chapter 1 again another evil spirit comes up the day came when the sons of god came in the presence of god and the bible tells us and satan was amongst them and he said oh he's begin to speak about job you say he's righteous and this and that he doesn't curse you because you're blessing him just let me go down there and i'll tempt him i'll test him i'll do this i'll do that and you'll see he'll curse your name and yeah and everything and god's permitted him again he was permitted in that sense the word chosen by the translators was used but it's really he was permitted right to go down to do that job of being a liar a chapter an accuser all my friend and so he came to earth and this was judas's purpose chosen instructed and even entering in not into the revelation but into the knowledge he had the outward knowledge he could put all the scopes the old prophets together he could tie it together and make sense out of it he could trill your heart with it my goodness and more than that we understand that he had a ministry of miracles signs and wonders that was given to him my friends we're living in a day right now when this same spirit is very active and when many millions religious but lost lost in a world filled with confusion and chaos listening to the word of god out of the sermon demonology today my dear christian friends demons are working and they are on every hand and god's spirit is moving also right on out to counteract that every time you remember the scripture says when the enemy comes in like a flood thus god said ah his spirit will raise up a standard against him and i believe god's spirit is raising up a standard against this flood this onslaught of the attacks of the enemy upon individuals that serve god upon the true church of god it's under the attack of the devil as never before from every area amen here it is my friends not be fined you see demons they are working do you believe demons are working today yes they are my friends they and they are very religious we know that for satan was religious he was kicked out for being just religious in the realms of heaven kicked down to earth and you know the rest of the story how he produced the sun and his name was kane son of that wicked one and he also was very religious with his altar beautiful filled with flowers and lovely indeed but it was nothing but the works of his hands and there it is religious but lost satan religious but lost you'll find that principle running right through the bible which you just use your the scriptures and let the spirit of god lead you how very religious there were but lost many millions that are going to church every sunday my friends millions repeating the apostles creed with all sincerity millions singing doxologies and everything religious beautiful songs my friends satan himself was a beautiful heavenly singer but kicked out of heaven oh just as religious as they can be and as he was someone says is that the truth yes my friends that's the same kind of religious spirit that was there right throughout those gospels and even in the book of acts and if you continue to follow the trail of the serpent you'll find that same religious spirit that was dressed in all manner of religious paraphernalia with great religious titles uh doctor of this and doctor of that and rabbi this and rabbi that there were the very ones that crucified the word of god the revealed word and the reason why because the word did not come to them in the way they envisioned or the way they thought it would come the word came contrary to their senses the word come contrary to their culture the word came contrary to their wisdom and intelligence the word came contrary to their schools and their rabbinical uh schools and the schools they have today the word comes contrary to that and it comes out in a wilderness it comes out from out of the backside of the desert it comes out that way for that is god's way and god's principle and god will not change it not for anything in the world for god never changes his mind about his word oh my yes sir it was religious demons operating in the religious realms that actually hung jesus on the cross they pressed for his crucifixion they wanted to destroy the world then they want to destroy it now and they'll do everything in their power to do that oh but jesus said when they said we are about father abraham we be religious jesus said but you are of your father the devil and his works you will do his for he he was a liar and a murderer from the beginning and you are here doing the same works which abraham didn't do and claiming you're from abraham and your seed life your regions your genealogy proves that you are from satan you're from your father the devil and his works you will do now oh some say well russia rushes the antichrist russia let me tell you my friends russia is not the antichrist let me repeat not russia russia is not the antichrist don't look at the iron curtain my friends don't look at the bamboo curtain what you should fear the most according to this 20th century prophet is that soft smooth purple curtain that is coming up on the face of the earth watch my friends i tell you clearly demons working and they are working overtime in this time that we are in and it's getting tighter and tighter the pressure is on and it's coming down and they're working now in the physical realm we pray for the sick we pray for the disease the suffering many times we have to come against the spirit of cancer we have got to come against some growth but it's a demon it's a devil the doctor will tell you what it is and he is right from his point of view of what he can touch uh see feel shapes that he can x-ray and see but from the realm of those that are spiritual it's a devil that caused that interruption and there it is my friends that in that realm he goes by that name they're calling all kinds of other name he's dumb he's blind he's death is this and yet jesus reject come out thou deaf spirit come out your dumb spirit he even spoke to the spirit of death and told them to give way for their master jesus christ is here on the scene amen praise god hallelujah so we call it cancer out there but then when it operates only as a spirit as an invisible entity it carries the same corrosive acidic effect upon the minds and hearts of man it creates that atmosphere that will drive you away from god that will take away your spiritual health and your spiritual life from you oh my yes sir and we know that it's nothing but devils amen we come over here today and we see those same devils that are still working in that realm is also working in the religious realm they haven't changed their ways they haven't changed their tactics they were pious back then there were pious under the pharisees the sadducees they were real religious and learned there were real clean living but yet jesus tells us they're real who really who they were and how though they were pious he says that's how the people see you that's how they interpret you that's how you when trained to present that persona that you are you are a religious man person you know how to make a presentation of self but i am here the word of god which reveals and discern the hearts the intentions and motives of man and the word of god said you are of your father the devil you came from him and you are his uh progenitors you are his you are his descendants you come from him you are not of abraham for your religious spirits demons they're still here and they're still working in the world today yes sir i tell you my friends oh cain was religious he was there with his brother abell they were together with their mother they came from the same womb together like two believers same church shoulder to shoulder or close together brother sisters one of god one of the devil one king one of abel my friends one without any revelation one having only a knowledge of the truth and the knowledge of the revelation remember esau was also a very religious man and he saw look like the gentleman while uh jacob looked like he was the like they you know a roughhouse fat kind of fallow but yet he was god's seed god's elected for that day and for that time judas was also very religious close to jesus in jesus church a member of his congregation religious but lost oh my it's religion and when we look at it back then it was the religious leaders and today it's not the outside people that will try to destroy the church it will not the outside people that destroy that preacher that servant of god that tries to serve him faithfully no it will be the same demonic spirit amen operating on the religious realm being so religious so pious such a good person 100 brother branham said doing great work amen hallelujah he said here let me quote they're right in your ranks right in your ranks by graph 218 demonology see it's right in your ranks watch that but it's demonology maybe a little later on i'll touch on that a little bit more but remember this you recognize it as demonology it's moving the people influencing the people but condemn no one love everybody if you can't love from your heart then christ is not with you remember that my brothers and my sisters regardless of what happens around you whatever you see or hear or feel or whatever love everybody condemn no one but let the love of christ dwell richly within your heart by faith and the genuine love and grace of god not something that's put on or masqueraded with or using it as a mask but the genuine love of god must flow out of you in its richness and fullness and be a blessing to the world and all those that are around you judas had great power great evidence of the holy spirit moving on his life amen he even healed the sick like many preachers today many people today he even cast out devils and he was a devil but he was a great prince of devils or he can cast out any lesser devils anyway so here is my friends uh you see he cast them out in jesus name but when the great showdown came the time to make a decision with whose side you're on what is your stand where do you stand like like like luther said here i stand so help me god i can do no other my stand is upon the word of god the just shall live by faith amen hallelujah when the showdown came judah sold out for gold and silver sold out for political power with the powers of the day and he did not go up to pentecost to get the rest of the word or to get the resurrected word amen he just took that part of the word that he could see and study and and and feel and fish with and and and and be a friend with around that word but when the word went into another dimension of resurrection he did not go up to pentecost to receive the word of god in that form for he was devoid of the spirit i want to make a quotation here from the prophet of this 20th century brother william marion branham who says make no mistake about it a person that is truly baptized by the holy ghost into the body of christ receiving the fullness of the spirit will be in the word all the way that is the evidence of being baptized with the holy ghost that my friends from the mouth of god's servant the genuine evidence of the baptism of the holy ghost hallelujah is and i repeat a person that is truly baptized by the holy ghost into the body of christ receiving the fullness of the spirit will be in the word all the way god calls us not to go part of the way enough to say i believe it i'm religious i i live by the word i live it pure i'm doing the best i can god asks us to go all the way amen yes sir oh praise god forevermore hallelujah amen furthermore jesus said this removal of the name out of the book this blotting out of the name from out of the book let's take our thoughts back to israel with moses again exodus chapter 32 verses 30 to 34. and moses returned unto the lord and said all this people have sinned a great sin and have made them themselves gods of gold yet now if thou wilt forgive their sins and if not block me i pray thee out of the book which thou hast written and the lord said unto moses where whatsoever whosoever hath sinned against me him will i blot out of my book amen therefore go now and lead the people unto the place i have chosen unto thee my angels shall go before thee nevertheless in the day when i visit their sin upon them you will see amen now it is evident from the scripture we read that names have been removed and names were going to be removed from the book of life airtime passes god was going to take some names out of the book of life and in particular it was because of idolatry gods of gold and so on it was because of the sin of idolatry because the tribes particularly of dan and ephraim lost their rights as the tribes of israel by worshiping the golden calf worshiping money golden idols there it is and all who worship the idols have their names removed from the book of life when israel rejected the leadership of the great pillar of fire and turned away from the pillar of fire to worship golden calves their names were removed from the book of life exodus 32 verses 30 verse 33 whosoever has sinned against me him will i blot out of my book my friends if turning to idols demands the penalty of the removal of names from the book of life then surely the rejection of jesus christ himself as the messiah would demand a same or similar penalty according to the word of god think seriously upon what you just heard amen read psalm 69 which speaks of the humiliation of jesus verses 21 to 28 how they gave him gall and vinegar to drink and listen he speaks saying let their table become a snare before them that they should have been for their welfare what should have been for their welfare let it become a and let their eyes be darkened let them be chained in clouds of darkness amen yes my friends of course we understand back then their names were blotted out for idolatry and in our day again millions of names are going to be blotted out because of idolatry what idolatry we know my friends that denomination denominationalist is idolatry for a denomination is an idol or an image unto the beast and god said i'll blot out the names of those that worship idols turn away from his word and worship idols go into the nominations oh my friends think about it the word of god hallelujah amen god said let them come not come not come into thy righteousness but let them be blotted out of the book of the living and not be written with the righteous and so the jews who rejected jesus and turned away literally from their great jehovah god rejecting jesus on the clouds of darkness of not recognizing that the jehovah spirit had now become flesh to walk amongst men and to be emmanuel god with us even so we find the jews rejected jesus then and now the gentiles did the same thing acts chapter 13 verses 46 to 48 where paul and barnabas had to rebuke the jews and say because you reject the word you've turned it down we have been commanded by the lord hence we turn to the gentiles and the bible reads i have been set to be a light to the gentiles that thou should this be for salvation unto the ends of the earth and when the young gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed amen hallelujah praise god now this is not to suggest that there will not there will be no more names from amongst the tribes of israel on god's great book of life by the way the book of life lamb's book of life is used interchangeably so don't got get hung up upon that unless god would grace you with an understanding of the fullness of that amen but here it is my friends the jews rejected him and just as the tribes of dan and ephraim were blotted out from amongst them now the entire nation and tribe of israel rejected jesus christ as their messiah and when you do that rejecting the word then what does he do he said i'll blot out their names also now when that statement is made don't go to the extreme and to give a wrong impression it doesn't tell you that all of them will be blotted out but listen carefully god speaks in his word that amounts the gentiles that now are going to be coming in for now we know that the uh law changed to grace the dispensation of law changed to grace when jesus died and paul the messengers ministry began in the first church age under grace now under grace the spirit is calling to all men of all nations and as a result we know that there will be jews and there are jews in the gentile church even today hallelujah because we are not suggesting that all israel is blotted out from the book of the living for amongst the jews god knows them that are his hallelujah and he knows them and knows their position and will call them out in his time and in his season listen there are groups of people coming forth from the jews which i'd like to identify quickly here one jews that will be born again individually as individuals within the framework of the gentile church god is calling some of them and some of them are answering the call for they recognize that jesus is not a part of the trinity but that he is father son and holy ghost the name of the father son and holy ghost jesus christ the one true and only god jehovah made flesh for a season of time amen hallelujah the word became flesh and dwelt among us and revealed himself to us and among us for his glory and for his honor went back into glory came back down in the form of the holy spirit and is now here amongst us manifesting and revealing himself and making himself known to his children individually wherever they are whoever they are wherever they're from god is making himself known so first out of the jews individual jewish saints believers called out by god's election through the blood of christ amen called to answer their name spiritually speaking how amen then there are the martyred jews that were martyred under the fifth seal in the book of revelation martha practically during the time stalin hitler many others down through the ages they were killed by the millions of martyred oh my but many of those are people of god where god's great spirit hallelujah calls to their spirit to bring them into his divine presence amen not a bunch of tricky uh crooks and tricksters but people who laid down their lives for their faith and were martyred for the faith of the word of god amen yes sir martyr jews and then the 144 000 also is another group out of the jews that will be brought into the kingdom of god remember i say 144 000 jews not 144 gentiles never mind what name you put upon them whether you call them jehovah witnesses but you call them latter-day saints whether you call them christian scientists whatever name you place on them the bible says clearly in the book of revelation 144 000 jews 12 000 of every tribe amen that god will bring in as part of his own and no gentiles should have the presumption of inserting inserting themselves in there to say they are one of those 144 000 that is demonic that is absolutely false it's contrary to the word of our god for god has made it plain that he will bring out three three groups or sections from the jewish people to repeat individual jews during the gents saved during the gentile church age martyred jews as we can see from under the fifth seals from their sufferings through the ages their martyrdom and murders right andrew hitler and stalin and right on down my friends real ones god knows them and he's the one that calls them as his own and lastly the 144 thousands jews that god calls out israel in its majority its name was removed from the book of life because of what idolatry and the majority of the gentile church world also that's here right now their names will be removed from the book of life because again the same sin the sin of i dollar tree but the this idolatry is in another realm not just an idol on a wall or a calf sitting there on a block my friends but an image on to the beast you're worshiping an idol an image onto the beast amen so it is clear present presented to you clearly in the word of god amen but while that is happening my friends god will call out some whose names are not even on the book we'll bless them and reward them there's no assurance of who that is where they are they've done something good for the bride of christ they've helped the people of god they've supported the people of god they've encouraged the people of god they've comforted the people of god they've brought sucker and aid to the people of god listen from the word of god hear what it says here now then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come you blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for i was hungry and you gave me meat i was thirsty and you gave me drink i was a stranger you took me in i was naked you clothed me i was sick you visited me i was in prison and you came unto me then shall the righteous answered him saying lord when saw we be hungered you see the unconscious goodness flowing out of that person that did not recognize what they were doing and who they were doing it to because they saw you and me they saw the visible individual that they know every day not realizing god in christ christ in the church the kingdom being restored oh glory to god hallelujah amen when savi hungered or thirst or stranger naked sick or in prison and did minister unto thee then shall he answer them saying verily i say unto you inasmuch as you did it not unto one of the least of these you did it not unto me and these shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous into life eternal amen oh praise god hallelujah brother sister amen matthew 25 31 to 46 is where you will find that reading and i'll reserve the rest of this when we will speak next week wednesday we'll speak on the uh the judgment at the great white throne praying that god's holy spirit will once again bless and help us everyone as we gather with great anticipation expectation in the presence of the lord i trust you have been blessed i have been blessed i've been enlightened i've been inspired by the holy spirit and i pray he will continue to inspire and that the holy spirit will anoint you to pray for me as i pray for you until we meet again god bless you [Music] you
