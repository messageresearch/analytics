simple church here by the grace of God this morning we are blessed saints of God I'm excited I'm excited about the word this morning I'm excited to see each and every one of you I'm excited to see that the Lord um is moving in your lives that you have a desire to be in his presence amen praise God because things happen in his presence amen praise the Lord God bless you Saints thank you musicians we appreciate that brother Anthony thank you for the songs of worship praise God so we are starting a brand new year amen we're starting this is our first Sunday this I believe um is the beginning of something wonderful I believe the Lord is doing something marvelous in our midst amen praise God glory to God he's he's uh doing something special he's doing it in your life whether you know it or not you'll come to realize you'll come to recognize praise God you know you may be seated for a minute and just going to make a few opening comments praise God we certainly um are happy that uh we can be a part of this great move of God that he's doing right now in this day and in this hour and um you know we had a wonderful service here on Wednesday night praise God if you haven't uh tuned into that service you you should certainly tune into it you know I thought I thought maybe you know I said Lord should I be ministering the first service of the year you know and and it just didn't come on me strong I said he just let I just left it alone we left the schedule as it was and you know brother coffee came and ministered the word on on Wednesday night and you know on on last Sunday as I was you know just going out him and brother Corey were having some fellowship at the door there and brother coffee you know as soon as I entered into the room brother coffee said oh hold on a minute uh stop Corey don't say anything more he says you're breaking into my thought and I don't want brother Danny to hear you know I'm going to be ministering on Wednesday night and I said oh that's fine brother praise God that's good you know just left it alone praise the Lord anyway we came in here on Wednesday night and you know like um every time that I come into the house of the Lord you know I go into the Deacon's office and we've got a calendar there and so I'm given this testimony because the Lord told me to give it amen all right so this is not a testimony just for me this is for you amen so you know I went into the Deacon's office and I flipped it and I went right to January the 4th and the scripture said be strong and of good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee withs soever thou goest and I read that and I thought well praise God lord I believe it amen that's always been a strong scripture for me it's always been something that the Lord has dealt with me on you know even from when I started ministering the word of God and so I I I just left it at that and you know came in sat down we listened to the whole service and just about five minutes before the end of the service the Lord brought this back to my mind and I thought oh let me was that the scripture because brother coffee ministered on Joshua 1 he read that and then he read you know another scripture from Joshua and so I thought okay let me go to the office I went back I left here I went and checked sure enough that's what it was the Lord said okay there's a confirmation go let the people know I said okay praise God so I came out and I just exhorted on you know the the that God says to shout because God has given us the victory all the all the walls that are surrounding us any anything that surrounded you in 2023 guess what the walls are going to come down in 2024 because he says I'm with you I'm going to be I'm going to go before you just shout this message let the PE don't be ashamed because this is the message listen those children of Israel they received specific instruction from Joshua amen praise God God is given us specific instruction on what to do and how to apply the word of God in this day and in this hour amen he says you go and you seven times around they went seven times which was a type of the seven Church ages but he says but at that seventh time he says you're to shout you're going to shout all in one Accord you're to shout all with one voice amen praise God there's a revelation in the land right now that this bride is shouting one with one voice one message no confusion it's Christ himself coming down and he says I'm giving you the land I'm giving you the victory praise God and so that was wonderful went into the back and I said I got to let brother coffee know that the Lord Vindicated this message tonight and so I went there and I said brother coffee let me show you this and I showed it to him I said look the scripture and then I said look January the 4th and then I grabbed my phone and I said look January the the 3 I said it's January the 3 I said hallelujah praise God I said Lord you Blinded Me the whole day I thought it was January 4 all day I said glory to God I there was no like nothing zero complete listen you don't think God can do something like that let me tell you something you got something on your heart you got a situation that's heavy that you can get so burdened down you know that God can lift that like that because God does it by revelation God does things that you cannot do amen and so I rejoiced I said praise God brother coffee look at this and brother coffee was he says I'm I'm you know if you listen to the message he says four 2024 he says four is the number of the Bride he was saying four you know he kept on it you know like and and then look at the date January 4th Hallelujah I said praise God God bless you brother coffee have a wonderful night you know the Lord you know I'm glad that you yielded yourself now I understand why you know when I came into the foyer there that you had to stop brother story because God does things in his time and timing is everything to the Lord amen amen praise God it doesn't end there brother Chris comes walking right in right after brother coffee steps out of the office he comes in he says brother Danny he says God is moving I said yes brother I know praise God he goes I have something that I was supposed to give to you on Sunday I said oh he says yeah and then he handed it to me and it was this it says Joshua 1:9 for the Lord your God will be with you whether ever thou goest am one confirmation in the service two confirmation right here three confirmation that's only God Saints you need to Rejoice because God is telling you God is telling us to be strong to be courageous to be willing to allow him to do whatever he wants to do because I believe you know we're going to be speaking today on something that the Lord laid heavily on my heart and I know it's on a lot of people's hearts and people you know quote this scripture often you know more times than than uh you know Can Be Imagined but I'm going to read the scripture let's all stand and then we're going to start into the service praise God let's pray father Lord we just want to give you the glory this morning Lord that testimony is to your glory father we just Rejoice Lord knowing that we are a people that are known as your people and you said on that day they shall know that I am their God and that they are my people Lord we rejoice this morning Lord to know this we Rejoice to know your spirit is moving in this place in this ministry you started this ministry many many years ago Lord you have risen it up you have brought it to this time to this season for a purpose and here we are now Lord we're entering into a new season a new Time Lord we've not walked this way before but we're asking your anointing to come and break this word and the bread of life to us so that we can rejoice and leave this place different than the way we entered in Lord rejoicing and knowing that you are with us withersoever we shall go Blessed Be Your Name father we give you the glory and the praise now anoint speaker and hearer in Jesus name amen praise God it says here in Isaiah 43: 18 and 19 it says remember ye not the former things neither consider the things of old behold I will do a new thing now it shall spring forth shall ye not know it I will even make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert praise God God bless you Saints you may be seated amen praise God let's go to slide number one we're not going to have a lot of slides but we're just going to have them for scripture I want to welcome everybody into 2024 amen praise God let's let's all say goodbye 2023 goodbye 2023 amen praise God welcome 2024 because I believe God has much more amen praise God and so right now we're going to be watching three videos okay they are very short will be done all three within about five to six minutes but I want you to pay attention to these videos and just let the Lord speak to your heart get into the atmosphere get into what God is doing here this morning I'm telling you he's here he's doing something for us this morning there's an anointing in this place praise God if you can just enter in you're going to rejoice and you're going to leave rejoicing praise God go ahead ahead put on the first video make sure it's nice we can hear it clearly praise God and turn off the lights here on the stage little more volume [Music] please [Music] [Music] praise God so that's our first video and I'm just going to comment say a few things and really that video was to let you know it's January amen here in in in our civilization you know if you talk to the Hebrews and the and the Jewish people they're going to tell you no it's not the first month of the year and they're right because according to scripture Nissan is the first month of the year praise God but January is the first month of the year for us and so for us it's not a matter of days and times and Seasons when it comes to God doing something new amen God can do something anytime but here we are and you know people at this time you know January is a time where they they they they think of new starts new beginnings and God wants to give you a fresh start God wants to give you something brand new that you can uh look back on 2023 and realize that everything that happened to you every circumstance everything that came into your life God had a purpose in it because you're still here today and you're still serving the Living God Amen praise God January is normally the the theme around January when it comes to you know the Christian World they talk about repentance because repentance is you know to stop doing the things that you know you shouldn't be doing amen and to change and do things that you should be doing praise God and so there's a theme there that uh repentance you know um of our sin and transforming ourselves by the renewing of our hearts and by the renewing of our minds by taking on new habits by taking on new uh challenges praise God by making the sacrifices that we need to make in order to get the victory because without you know W Without You overcoming Without You overcoming yourself I'll tell you your greatest enemy is yourself because the enemy of Satan he works on your mind and he he he hits you from right from left he's constantly trying to bombard you with all kinds of heartache and circumstances and if you believe those things you start to speak them you start to become Your Own Worst Enemy you start to speak things remember you have the supernatural God living in you amen he's speaking in and through your life to change things to transform the things around your life and when you come into that understanding that you and God are one that you and his Spirit are are one now that he wants to work through your life you start to speak right amen amen praise God hallelujah let's play the second video [Music] [Music] now [Music] [Music] he [Music] [Applause] [Music] go [Music] [Applause] [Music] n [Music] Hallelujah starting today amen praise God you know um New Year's always has people thinking about New Year's resolutions you know I I need to make resolutions and so let me just give you a few simple facts about um what happens uh with New Year's resolutions many people make resolutions but did you know that over onethird of these resolutions are abandoned within the first two weeks that's onethird of all the resolutions that people would try to make you know within a couple weeks they're right back at it again they can't help it 50% of them are completely abandoned by six months would it make sense that if our resolutions are not working most of the time that maybe we should look to God's resolutions maybe we should consider what God wants to resolve in our lives to allow him to personally look into you and to search your heart and and for you to reconsecrate yourself in such a way that you know that you you and God can walk together and he can share with you the things he wants to do in your life amen would it make more sense because you know what those resolutions that he has for you he made them before the foundations of the world he knew you before the foundations of the world and he had plans for you before the foundations of the world Amen praise God and so it's not a matter of I've got resolutions and I've got to make resolutions let me tell you what you need to do as a son or a daughter of God you need to surrender you need to yield yourself to God's will that's why he said I'll put a new heart in you I'll give you my spirit he's going to give you overcoming power you can't do it on your own I'm telling you right now anybody that thinks that they can do it on their own they've been trying to do it on their own they think they can do it on their own they keep falling flat right back on their face again because their resolution is in their own ability and not what God can do he says I can do these things glory to God Amen praise God and so we're going to look at the the last video now and then we're going to start right into it we're going to get into some things amen praise God [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] praise God hallelujah I'm going to read a scripture here and we're going to get into some things here Exodus 12 you can go to the next slide Exodus 121 and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year and the next scripture which we read right at the beginning Isaiah I'm going to read it again remember ye not the former things neither consider the old things behold I will do a new thing now it shall spring forth shall ye not know it God's saying you don't think I'm going to hold it from you do you I'm going to let you in on it I'm going to let you in on what I have planned for your life you don't know what I have planned for your life but I've got something special planned for your life amen amen praise God I will even make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert praise God forever more here in this verse from Exodus God is speaking to the children of Israel right on the eve of their Deliverance out of bondage God was giving them instruction letting them know that he was going to do something new amen they didn't have any idea what God was going to do but he was going to do it and when he did it he did it with great demonstration he did it with great power he did it uh W with with such Deliverance that there was no doubt that it was God God doing it it wasn't their own ability it wasn't because Moses was doing it it wasn't because of their strength and that they could overcome pharaoh and the armies of pharaoh they didn't have a chance and I'm telling you there's things that are hovering around your lives and around this this Dimension and in this time and season that where Spirits are coming and and taking possession of the people controlling families taking taking families d destroying them destroying lives you don't have a chance against these Spirits unless God himself comes and does it with the demonstration of his power his glory his word in your life amen praise God this was the eve of their departure they were in long enslavement and on that night God threw Moses's instituting something new he says I'm giving you a new year I'm giving you a new start you are going to leave this place never to see it again because the word of his prophecy had come to pass Hallelujah you know that everything is prophecy you know that everything that God is doing he's already spoken it he's already seen it from before the foundations of the world you know that that's what makes you different from the rest of this Christian world is because God has placed his Spirit In You giv you the ability to look back into the mind of God and to see the things that God had already planned and and God had already instituted for this church for this Bride for this time for this season and do you know that when it comes into God's season he does things that Astound the people hallelujah he does things that go beyond human comprehension Beyond human sense but when God wants to do something new he just does it amen praise God and so here they were God was declaring his word so that Israel and the world could know because that was the world back then God had been silent for 400 years they my goodness they were listen those children of Israel all they knew for Generations was slavery that's all they knew but then God now comes on the scene to declare I'm still alive I'm still God I am that I am when he stood in front of pharaoh they couldn't recognize they couldn't see that in that man Moses that was carrying that staff was the mighty Living God they can't see in you when you tell them about what God is doing in this day what God is doing in this hour what what the word of God says not what I say listen when Moses went up before Pharaoh he said thus sayeth the Lord he didn't say thus saith me God has empowered me to tell you that this is what I'm going to do and this no no th thus sayeth the Lord God was showing that he was in his people again Hallelujah declaring his word praise God to show with great demonstration his power and that he was with his people amen thank you here they were about to step into something new we too are stepping into something new amen saints of God I've never been this way before here I am I've stepped into a new position as the pastor of Good Neighbor Ministries I cannot do this on my own I am going to tell you straight up straight simple that if God doesn't give you faith and God doesn't give you a revelation of how God and what God is doing in this ministry there's no way I can do this on my own God needs to give you faith to respect the office to respect the position to know that it's not that that Dan Brother Dany didn't put himself into this brother Danny would have run the other way amen I have so many things on my plate when this came up when the reality of it started to sink in I started to look around me and say oh my God how am I going to do this how is this possible Lord but I said Lord I'm just going to leave it alone and I'm going to go one day day at a time because I have not been this way but then you know what encourages me when I start to see the super natural moving through your lives Hallelujah he's vindicating to me he's showing me that he's with me but I need to see that he's with you that that he's that the same vision that that he's placed upon my heart is in your heart my heart is not to build up a Ministry with thousands of people no sir this F Foundation was built upon the Simplicity and the sincerity of leading people to Jesus Christ so that they could become what God meant them to be hallelujah praise God that will always be the call that will always be the purpose that will always be the The Passion of this ministry and if God places that passion in you this year I believe this year we we've turned a corner and God wants to do something new yes God wants to fill this place I believe he's going to fill this place amen praise God I believe he's going to pour Prosperity into this place like never before Hallelujah and I'm not just talking about the prosperity financially that's the last thing praise God I'm talking about where people are prospering in Christ amen where their lives are being changed being transformed by the word of God being delivered from from their from their lives and and allowing God to do a new thing in them praise God hallelujah glory to God Amen Psalms 138:8 says the Lord will perfect that which concerneth me I want you to say that with me the Lord the Lord will perfect that which concerneth Me Oh Glory to God that's what that's what he's interested in he's interested in knowing that that the Lord is going to perfect that which he needs to perfect in in me oh we like to look at brothers and sisters and say oh boy the Lord still needs to do a lot on his life the Lord still needs to do a lot on their life boy I wonder if this and that if they're going to do this and that never mind the Lord is not concerned about what what you think needs to be done in other people's lives God is Con saying you need to be you need to be you need to know that the Lord will perfect that which concerns you Hallelujah until you get to a place where you can get so one with God and so so yielded and surrendered to God to know that he can deal with anybody do not be afraid of anybody do not let anybody put you down don't let any body tell you anything different let God be the judge let the Lord come and deal with the lives of his children because this is all about God dealing with a people bringing them into the unity of the faith so that they can all recognize that this Rapture can only go when everyone is in the unity of the faith and they are in Christ Jesus hallelujah hallelujah outside of Christ Jesus Jesus there is absolutely no Rapture the Rapture is to those that are in Christ amen praise God hallelujah I I'm willing to surrender I'm telling you now today I am willing to surrender to this call on my life I'm willing to be the the one that that literally when we go to war I'll be the first one on the field I'll be ahead of you I'll be the first one on the field I will not hide behind anybody I will not hide behind circumstances and situations I'm not going to hide behind your problems amen when your problems when you come to me you come to the deacons and you've got a situation where you need God to move if you really want God to move then God is going to move and God is going to speak and God is going to deal and God is going to deliver you amen but you got to be willing to humble yourself to God's provided way you got to be willing to to allow the Lord to deal and to shape you and to mold you and to take out that that negative attitude to take out that gossiping Spirit to take out that anger to take out that Envy God wants you he's doing a new thing in you yes praise God hallelujah thank you Jesus Hallelujah this is this this this is all about you you are you willing to surrender to his will are you willing to surrender to the move that is now on in this ministry are you willing to allow God to do a new thing he says I am doing a new thing not I will no no no no no no no we're going to put God in the present tense Hallelujah God has been doing new things in our lives right from the first day that he called you praise God forever more Hallelujah let me just finish giving you my testimony because I know I didn't finish last Sunday it was brought to my attention you know because I was worried about the time I was looking at the time and I and I kind of got lost and then I realized that there was one more page in my notes that I didn't even get to and it was that God while I was under this influence of drugs an addiction under the drugs I had no idea that God was going to do a new thing in my life I had no idea that that there was a time and a season coming into my life so I was attending those Services I was listening to Pastor Simon Minister the word of God those words were like like arrows they were piercing my heart week in and week out I was going to the services you know for a period of maybe a month and a half or so and EV and then finally I just couldn't take it anymore I just realized that that that that because in my mind I'm going to tell you in my mind and in my thoughts I thought I would actually probably die from a heart attack from being on the drugs because there was times when my heart was pounding so much and I don't even remember I'd just wake up out of a stuper out of a out of a a night where where it was just it was just the the the drugs and I would wake up and I thought my God I can't believe it because because and I thought there I couldn't stop it there was there was no way I could personally stop it but then I came to a realization when I was hearing that word and I didn't know about brother brandom I didn't know God sent a pro don't listen you got to meet God you got to know that it's God that you have met first you can't even recognize you you will not even recognize that God sent a prophit unless you get god with you first because it's his spirit that leads you into all truth but all I knew is that I wanted to be delivered and all I could hear coming out of those Services was you need the Holy Ghost you need a power that's greater than your own power you need Deliverance that goes beyond what you think you you you you think you can go to a rehab you think you can go you can't go nowhere because I've called you for a special purpose I didn't know that I was being called for this purpose but God had a special purpose God was doing a break brand new thing in my life and so I walked up to Pastor Simon when he did a he did a a call to the altar where people could come up and I remember as Vivid as clear right now I went up to him and when it was my turn and he stood there and I looked at him and I said pastor Simon I want the Holy Ghost I need the Holy Ghost it's the only thing that I believe from what I'm hearing can deliver me and he looked at me and he said praise God brother you got the Holy Ghost I said what Hallelujah I said what I said I need to go to that water I need water I need to get to the water I want to be baptized because I heard what they said I heard the you know Gabriel and I would talk about baptism we talk about it on the way to church and I'd be asking Gabriel about the godhead and about the baptism in jesus' name and he would be answering me and I was it was ding in my mind and in my heart and I came to realize that that baptism was was was my life being buried my old life could be buried I said wow you mean that my whole life can be put behind me yes you can you can raise up into a brand new life amen I said I need to get to that water and we set it up and I don't care it was a horse trough it didn't matter to me what it was it could have been a muddy water somewhere I needed to be buried in the water and I needed to be cleansed by the word of God Amen Hallelujah and I got to that water and let me tell you something that's why I'm as zealous and that's why after after that day that I was baptized all hell broke loose around my life and everybody else's because I couldn't wait to tell everybody when I came up out of that water don't ask me to explain it all I know is that that man spoke words over for me and I remember him saying Satan get out leave this life you have no more hold on this life I don't I cannot explain to you but on that day I was supernaturally delivered from a cocaine addiction that held me for 13 years don't let me don't let me try to explain to you how it felt all I know is that it it just had no power over me anymore it wouldn't pull me when I was driving back you know when I when I would be driving back from work and or from the food terminal sometimes i' get pulled to go off here get off over here at Islington Avenue because there was a guy that had lots of cocaine and I'd just go there Flash the dollars and I'd pick it up no power anymore then I was walking down at the food terminal and there was guys in the food terminal that used to sell it to me all I would have to do was look at them and say and they knew exactly what I was saying they'd meet me right at the minion citris downstairs in the washroom and we'd make the exchange guess what all of a sudden they're looking for me you and and I'm I'm not even I'm not even responding I'm walking the other way there was no more power there was no more pull there was nothing left God God kicked that demon out I just walk and then and then finally they got bold they come to me say hey bro come on man what do you need I said no no what do you need Hallelujah I got something I got something that that can deliver you from this oh yeah okay oh yeah oh yeah what's happened to Danny now yeah yeah well we'll see in two weeks from now two years later all they could hear was this guy that was that was preaching in the Ontario food terminal telling everybody about the power of God God and how he was delivered and how he can deliver them and how he's got a message in the land that can set captives free hallelujah praise God let me tell you something within within within about five years between brother Tim and I he was my he was a driver at at our company and between him and I and the and the sermons that were being preached right on the docks I'm telling you you get listen I'd walk around the corner all of a sudden Tim's there Glory hallelujah praise God in the name of Jesus and I'd be walking in and i' be saying Glory Hallelujah brother speak that word glory to God every Demon's got a scatter out of this place glory to God Amen why because God was was doing something new there was a Revival taking place I was caught into that Revival I didn't even know it we were part of the Toronto Revival look it up there's a Toronto Revival that happened in the '90s and I didn't realize but God was calling attributes of God God was raising up Sons and Daughters to be called into a position into a season where the word was going to manifest itself hallelujah praise God and so long story short that Deliverance never ever changed amen he's the same yesterday today and forever and I stand to this day by the great of God hallelujah hallelujah praise God hallelujah oh Jesus is so good let me tell you than Lord I am a witness and I can tell you what he does stands it stands when he says I'll do a new thing oh glory to God Amen so these children of Israel they were excited the Lord was saying I will do a new thing for you and for me and for this ministry and for each and every one of us because he's got plans for us amen praise God at the beginning of a new year many people set goals and make resolutions and if those resolutions from the past year have not come to pass you know usually by Christmas they get really discouraged and they get you know they get nervous because they told a lot of friends they told a lot of family oh this is going to change in my life honey I'm going to be a better husband honey I'm going to be a better wife honey I'm going to I'm going to quit this honey I'm going to quit that you know I'm going to I'm going to work harder this year I'm gonna I'm going to do what I have to do in order to to to propel us forward and then a year later you look at your finance and you're you're deeper in debt what's going on it's just all part of God's plan it's just God still working on you it's just God still working on those things that he that that need to be that need to be altered and and tweaked and and and worked out in your life amen and so nothing has really changed unresolved relationships you know I'm going to lose 50 pounds this year the end of the year you weigh 20 more what is it you see you're going to be disappointed every time it's because your motive and the and the and the the the motive behind what it is that you're trying to achieve if that motive isn't foundational placed upon the word of God you got to have a you've got to have a motive that's placed upon the word of God God I realize that that to stand in this office and to stand in this position I cannot get overweight and and feeling sluggish and and and allow myself to just eat anything my wife is already started it gets on my nerves sometimes but she tells me no you need to cut that out you need no listen forget that sweet no no no I know you want to have sweet right after dinner just you know what skip a day you know she you know and and all these things but I know it's because she loves me because she's now she realizes she's a part of this ministry amen she's one with me she realizes that she's my helpmate that that she's got a part to do with all of this and if she can see it clear clearly that's her reward that's her placing in the word each and every one of you whatever office whatever position God has placed you in you do it not unto brother Danny you do it unto the Lord you do it unto the Lord you let the Holy Spirit place you direct you guide you but you're under the leadership of the Holy Spirit and we know that the leadership of the Holy Ghost has a provided way and those offices must be respected Mt I say this for your own benefits you need to know people coming to me and they're saying oh you know like you know uh just after the elections they were coming to me and they were saying oh Pastor Danny I said no I said not yet I said pastor Simon is still the supreme authority as a man in this church and you you I'm still brother Danny January the 1st if God gives you a revelation and an understanding of that office and that position and you want to receive the blessings that come from that office and that position then you will call me Pastor Danny and I will welcome it not because I'm I'm exalting the office no because I'm exalting Christ and knowing that you have got a revelation of this position in this office and you know you know you go back and read Christ The Mystery of God revealed brother bradam spoke a word to the church I can't remember everything but I do remember one thing he said you stay with your pastor there's going to be spirits that are going to come in and try to divide you and separate you and how does he do it he brings Rebellion he brings a spirit of rebellion on the people to where they don't want to submit to the pastor yes they don't want to call him Pastor oh yeah I'm telling you this is this is these are this is a reality I know I know but when God would check me when I would talk to Pastor Simon I have a hard time saying anything without Pastor in front of it because he is my shepherd He was my shepherd He was the one God spoke to me constantly he's still my mentor he's still a man of God that I will respect as my Elder until we leave this place Hallelujah because I believe that God has everything in its proper order and if we can see that and we can come under submission to that do you know how powerful this Army will become Hallelujah do you know that God will anoint that God will give me the the the the discernment to keep those Wolves Away you you don't want to get sniped by a wolf you don't want to get caught by by a by a a a Secret Snake because of your Disobedience and because of your rebellion and all of a sudden you're wondering why things aren't going right why things aren't happening the way they should and you know but but if you believe and you trust and you pray in the right way and we come under that unity and that understanding under the leadership of of Christ this church will be a powerful Church it will it will bring Deliverance to many people out there it because remember the Lord adds to the church but let me tell you you know God showed me something about that amen sometimes the Lord won't add to the church because of some of the disbelief and some of the unbelief of the people in the way that they that that they treat other people the way that they show respects under other people if you can't even respect your brother or your sister how can you tell me you're going to respect somebody that needs Deliverance in their lives God wants us to come under that leadership God wants us to be hospitable God wants us to express love in our testimony God doesn't want us going and condemning the people those people listen we're not we're against the systems because the systems are deceiving the people and the people themselves they get caught under Traditions they get caught under the teaching well because my mom and dad went to the Catholic church I go because they were were Baptist I'm Baptist but until the Holy Spirit comes personal into that life they will only know tradition they will only know what they've been taught but when we introduce them like God when Christ introduced himself to us when he says I'm going to do a new thing in your life personal when God did that it changed everything nothing could remain the same hallelujah praise God let me tell you when God wants to to to to pull you out and deliver you there's promises that come with that those children of Israel they were they were told listen you're coming out and not only are you coming out you're coming

their bad memories back in 2023 Hallelujah they left their poverty back there the Bible said that they went out with great substance hallelujah oh glory to God let me tell you Saints praise God they took they took the Egyptian silver and gold even the small children went right up to them and kicked them in the leg and took that gold chalice and said it's mine God give it to me everything that God he says he says it's all yours they took they took most of their gold they took most of their fine garments they did not leave Egypt sick no sir they were not there was not one feeble among them are you willing to forget the former things and take hold of the new today are you willing to let God do a new thing in in your life today Hallelujah he says I will do a new I am doing a new thing in you glory to God hallelujah are you willing to leave it behind I'm not carrying over my burdens in the 2024 no sir I I got lots of burdens but I've decided I'm not going to carry them over I'm not going to carry them over I'm not going to let the enemy put those burdens on me on my family sure there's circumstances that I want to see change absolutely I want to see a lot of change and I believe that God is going to do it God's going to God's going to make those changes amen praise God but I am putting the past behind me Hallelujah I refuse to carry sickness covid anything like that I refuse to carry it into this year amen I refuse to carry mental oppression no sir you know that that demon has raised his head up so much in the last few years that people are just falling apart people are on more drugs for anti-depressants and everything else than ever before they are calling mental health issues a literal pandemic they don't realize that all those demons that were in all those ages they're all pouring into this last age because we are at the end time we are headed for one of the worst tribulations that this Earth has ever seen I'm not saying it because I because I'm saying it I'm telling you what the word of God says amen praise God they went out they left it all behind they listen I refuse to carry a bad marriage yes if you've if you're having marriage issues and you you know sometimes you can you can be a little Tweaky with your wife or your husband you can you can be a little bit bold and you can get angry and raise your voice you know no more I refuse to allow that to be in my life I'm leaving that behind I want to treat my wife the way Christ treats the church if I'm supposed to be an example of Jesus Christ then then I'm I'm given a scripture that says you love your wife as Christ loved the church and you'll honor you'll respect you'll you you'll provide you'll protect you'll do everything that you have to do because she is you and when you disrespect her you're disrespecting yourself amen amen and vice versa it all goes the same way I refused I refuse to carry any kind of a dysfunctional relationship with my children Glory Hallelujah I tell them all the time I said listen I respect your opinion I love you I respect that you have an opinion but I don't necessarily have to accept your opinion but it doesn't change how much I love you oh Dad Dad Dad you mean you don't love me more than anything else in the world no I love God first I got to love God first if you're going to have any kind of a chance with my prayers and and and your mother's prayers and and what we believe for you and what we want to see God do in your lives if I put you first then what am I doing I'm I'm denying the word of God who what what what came first the chicken or the egg come on Saints we need to we need to ignore how can the creat tell the Creator this is the way it's got to be no sir God gave me a revelation that he's my absolute Hallelujah if I make him my absolute then everything that I do when I put the kingdom first everything else is going to come together even my children Hallelujah glory to God no more dysfunctional relationships with my brothers and sisters oh come on now sometimes you know little things get in between and you know that's just all this ehy we need to realize and recognize and put the blame where it should go amen don't put it on your brother don't put it on your sister put it on me fool you know shame on me for looking at the flesh instead of praying that that brother or that sister be set free so that they can be everything that God wants them to be because we are one we are one body in Christ the moment there's one sick in the house we're all sick we should all be praying the moment there's one rejoicing because God has done something wonderful we're not going to be over in the corner saying well God did this for me right away you know you tell somebody watch when you tell somebody about a victory and see if they respond the right way the right way is praise God brother Hallelujah glory to God that's the god that we serve amen if he does it for you I know he can do it for me glory to God or you tell them they don't say much but they want to tell you what God did for them right away they shut down what you just said they don't realize that's a spirit of like look at me look at look

with them become one with them understand that we need one another if we are going to move into 2024 Hallelujah listen to The Mighty God here I'm going to read a quote from Brother brandham hallelujah thank you Jesus brother Bram says here what does it take to make a Christian Life that's the message we're not going to get done today but that's okay what does it take to make a Christian Life brother B says now the Bible said here in Ezekiel speaking and Ezekiel was a prophet and he said a new heart will I give you I like it always God speaking of something new that he's going to do Hallelujah he doesn't he doesn't say now that doesn't mean that he will just patch up the old condition you see you know we got things on our lives and we just want God to patch him because not we're we're we're not willing for him to root it out dig it out we're not willing to come to that place where we just we we we just we're crushed by the power of God in our lives because of his correction his deliverance we just want we just want to read a scripture that says there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus and we want to use that to patch can you hear what I'm saying amen we want to patch those things that we know that we need total deliverance from because a month down the road two weeks down the road there's that old demon again there's that old Spirit again there's that old Envy again there's that old critical spirit again but but God says no I will do a new thing and when he does it it's total Deliverance when we can accept it by faith and by Revelation he says here he says he doesn't now that that don't mean just a patch up of the old condition but a new heart will I give you and I'll take away the Stony heart which you have glory to God and a new spirit will I give you he never said he would have a facelift to an old church that's what he said he never said that he would have a facelift to an old church no this is what he said he would have a new thing brand new Hallelujah glory to God you're going to be able to look at those demon powers and those enemies from 20223 and say bye-bye you got no power over me I I'm listen I just told you when he delivered me from that addiction it was broken it was God he did it it was a brand new thing that he did I just accepted it I got to a place of desperation where I didn't want it anymore you got to get to a place where you don't want Pride anymore you don't want those things to control your thoughts and your actions and your words you just want the spirit of God to take you mold you shape you and do whatever he has to do hallelujah thank you Lord a brand new thing and in doing this you can't mix an old intellectual church with a new Pentecostal experience church he said Pentecostal experience church he didn't say Pentecostal Doctrine a Pentecostal experience is a supernatural experience brother Gabriel amen you know when the presence of God comes comes and burns the hide out of that enemy you know when God comes on the scene and gives you a scripture that delivers you and it's done it's finished it's over hallelujah praise God thank you Jesus bless the name of the Lord amen glory to God hallelujah let's go on here so here he says I'm doing a brand new thing Glory Hallelujah now the children of Israel now remember remember Isaiah 43:1 18:19 said remember not the former things that means you need to put those things in the past and you need to leave them in the past whatever whatever struggle whatever sickness it didn't come to stay it came to pass Hallelujah you got to leave it in the past he says forget those things amen behold I do a new thing now the children of Israel had a choice they could view their past and the problems of their present and they could focus upon what God wanted to do in their lives that's what they were given the ability to do a lot of them you got to remember a lot of them when they got into the Wilderness they wanted to go back to Egypt remember this that we're in right now is not a Wilderness but it is the place between Canaan and the future home it's the place right now where we are still in time we're still being molded and shaped our characters and everything are being are being uh placed and and and corrected and molded and shaped for the Millennium we are being prepared for the Millennium remember that so we need to understand where we're at so here they were in order to discover what God wants for you you must first see yourself as God sees you you've got to get out of that old mental stinking thinking amen the children of of Israel felt as though they were getting just what they deserved because of the way they had lived some even believed that God would never have anything more to do with them because they were there for so long they were in bondage for so long that they didn't think they could be delivered we need to break out of that we need to know that God can do this new thing in our lives Oh Glory to God you may feel like your past has made your life A Wasteland but in God your life can become a dream of life you can out of your belly shall flow rivers of Living Waters amen hallelujah praise God and the scripture Romans chapter um 8 verse one says for therefore there is no C that is for you for sure but it's for you when you come into that place where you know you know God you you realize that that that that you're you're you're you're free you don't have to be under condemnation when you come to a place where you repent and and you change you you know you've decided that this year I'm going to let the Lord do that new thing in my life you can hold that thing up in front of Satan when he comes to bring your past before you he tries to condemn you for things that you did in the past then you raise up the sign and you say there is no condemnation Satan God has given me that Revelation it's different when you're using that sign to cover sin Hallelujah praise God that was fresh if you must listen you must see your possibilities as God sees them I am making a way in the desert so I don't care what the circumstances look like right now in your situation it could be really dry I'll tell you if you've got a dry experience with the Lord and you don't feel that anointing just get down after hearing this word today get down on your knees know that God is doing a new thing and that anointing you watch when you get sincere with God when you truly make that decision no more Lord I'm leaving those slaves behind they're not going to they're not going to control me that that demon of alcohol that demon of of drugs that demon of smoking that demon when it rises up and tries to come they got no power over me because I've made a decision I'm going to die I'm going to perish but one way or the other I'm going with Jesus hallelujah praise God forever more Hallelujah it also means that God is about to surprise your enemy hallelujah praise God Pastor Simon I enjoyed that Fellowship the other day glory to God he says he says listen God's going to do a new thing the devil don't know about it wo Hallelujah the devil don't know what that new thing is in your life he doesn't have any idea because God's going to do it by revelation God's going to show you things and deliver you from things supernaturally and Satan can't do one thing about it because he don't even understand it glory to God God didn't reveal it he says I will do a new thing for you he says I'm going to deal with the things that concern you the devil's got a place in the Bible and it's called the Lake of Fire Hallelujah glory to God he's under our feet did you know that Satan is under our feet if you're in the body of Christ and Christ is above all things there's he's got all power when he showed up to those disciples brother Chris he said all power has been given unto me yes in heaven and on Earth amen is there any other power no can somebody please tell me is there any other power if all power is in him that's why how can you believe a trinity how can you believe that there's three gods he said it right there it said that there was one that sat in the throne it didn't say three come on Saints we need to know our God he says they shall know that I am their God and that they are my people hallelujah you can't know God unless you know that he's not a trinity glory to God Amen they want to listen they want the new thing to come their way they want it to be according to their way they want to make Jesus the son God the father and the Holy Spirit the power they don't just realize that when Jesus said all that the father hath given me he was talking about himself Elohim the self-existent one he's gone back to his supreme authority as the Creator the Elohim the self-existent one it didn't say self-existent three that's right glory to God Amen praise God but you know what they want to come they want to do things their own way listen to brother Bram he says now in in in this message here he says Christ was smitten once Hallelujah that's the original experience that's the original way on the day of Pentecost Peter said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and we sprinkle in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost give all kinds of Creeds and everything else about it when we get off the word no wonder we can't get nowhere if you don't start right you can't finish right it's as simple as that you got to start right with the Lord that's the only way you're going to finish right amen and so here let me just finish we're going to finish up here and we're going to continue next week he says he says when we get off the word no wonder we can't get anywhere see God teaches us the lesson Moses Moses wasn't supposed to say now we'll start a new something here now and we'll organize and we'll make the Catholic church that's the first thing they done no then after a while well we'll start something new off of that we'll make the Lutheran Church you see and then come the Anglican and then the Baptist and more and more the campbellites and the Church of Christ and the Antichrist and all other things see they all started going one after the other one after the other making denominations and organizations now my point here is and this going to be quick is that we got to come God's provided way God is God is in God is in his church amen God is in his word praise God God is in the body of Christ if you're a Believer you've been placed there by God himself by placing his spirit in you and the way to receive his Spirit he's got a formula according to the word of God that if the spirit of God has come in you you've always had it but it can't help but go to the water because it's an outward expression of something that's real on the inside and that's why we get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so we can't go now he says now what is it we don't need nothing new go back Moses wasn't supposed to Smite The Rock in other words you don't change the Revelation no God said speak to the Rock God's given us a revelation that all we need to do is speak his word speak what he spoke don't speak your own interpretation don't put your own trinitarian Doctrine interpretation teachings of man and doctrines of man Jesus says because of your doctrines he rebuked the Pharisees and the Sadducees he says because of your doctrines you've made the word of God of none effect to the people and they don't know what to believe anymore and that's why when you go to somebody they won't stay there long enough to just listen to you just sit quiet for a minute and listen uh you know baptism in the name of Jesus Christ there's no other name whereby we must be baptized Jes says Jesus said he that believeth how does a baby believe how does somebody that you know you've got to repent you've got to know what you're doing amen praise God you got to come the right way or you're not even going to get started praise God but Moses was told to speak to the Rock not Smite The Rock not change the Revelation not do something that he wasn't told to do and again not try to start something new but to speak the old thing hallelujah praise God thank you Jesus listen I don't know about you but I have stepped into 2024 and I'm under expectation for something new God is going to do a lot of new in you let the musicians come thank you praise God we're going to continue this next week Hallelujah because we got lots to talk about that the lord has laid upon my heart and I believe that it's going to it's going to give us more strength it's going to give us more victory ictory Hallelujah we are going to progress in the word of God listen I want you to say after me the Lord is doing a new thing in me say it shout you need to shout the Lord is doing a new thing in me the Lord is doing a new thing in me hallelujah praise God this is the hour where we need to shout and we need to let the enemy know that this message is the message of the hour it is it is what brings Deliverance to the people there is no other message outside of Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and the people need to know that glory to God so that True Deliverance can come into their lives amen praise God I'm gonna let uh Pastor Simon come up you want to okay let's sing that song do something new let's sing that song Amen praise God hallelujah new in my life oh something new in my life something new in my life oh God do something new in my life something new in my life something new in my life oh god let's sing a verse Oh yesterday has come another day has come oh do something [Music] new in my life has come another day has come to something new in my life praise be to God do something new in my life oh Lord that is our hearts desire God bless you please be seated uh why I stepped up here is this morning just before leaving for service I took this jacket which I hadn't worn since sometime last year and as I was uh uh you know going to walk out I felt like there's some piece of paper in my pocket that you know might forget uh money or whatever sometimes you know in my pocket uh we all do that but then I took it out and when I took it out it says here um on the top Hebrews 138 Revelation 10 um 1 to 11 but the scripture I wrote the one that I have in my handwriting here Joshua 1 1-9 that's that's this morning just when I'm [Applause] leaving just so you know it's it's a supernatural in action and being able to see God in the simplest things if you can't recognize him it'll pass right by you you won't even know it and this is not something I wrote yesterday last week or the week before months ago and this was sitting in my pocket why am I going to find it now but here I find it and it says [Music] joshua9 furthermore I wrote uh here um God spake unto Moses in other words in all the text before all you can read this and God said unto Moses god spake unto Moses god spake unto Moses Joshua 1:9 I have it written here now God spake unto Joshua no more God speaking unto Moses because Moses is gone but God speaking unto Joshua so we believe God is going to speak to our brother we we believe God will speak through the Holy Ghost we believe God will anoint us with his word in this day and in this hour and the other piece of paper that I have here is about a new crop coming and um that this is then I will give him that one because it's wrote down before it's not something made up and so um just just so you are conscious that we are not just a church we are here I always say it because the reality to me when I just start talking like this I already sense his presence around me I I sense he's right with me um let me mention we why the brother was talking and I showed brother Tim I I took a photograph because for one moment uh there's just a flash there and like a person standing right there looking up at him talking about the new thing right and I caught the picture right then while this uh person just stands looking uh of this being said so the supernatural God is still in our midst am but we don't have you know the Pentecostals think they got to see a big miracle and they jump on their healing we are jumping too but not because of that brother Brenham said they on the day of Pentecost it wasn't Miracles and all that that made them jump they caught a revelation amen they caught a revelation of what he was telling them all the time it suddenly came to light Hallelujah and they couldn't speak they couldn't talk just tongues begin to break out praise the Lord so are we thankful to God and we see the anointing already beginning to flow and move in our brother's life how many could see that how many can recognize that amen I I want you to know that uh somebody had texted me and a few people have been asking me well brother now that uh uh uh pastor Dan is in his position um what should we call you uh what can we say you know I you know so I realize that it's a bit of uh confusion and we all get that confusion because last year has changed and I still went writing 2023 on a check writing 2023 on something else like you keep doing that until that old habit breaks you don't for force yourself it just happens as the year goes along then all of a sudden you're in the flow and you start 20124 right so so that's what's going on now because we we have a date when the transition supposed to have ended but that's just a date we as humans put but with a human beings dealing that transition is still going on you understand and it will after a while you will it will fade away and you will understand fully what it is but just to let you know you can say for a pastor praise the Lord uh and that is only um under certain situations you will do that it's just like um Talking to I've gone to churches where they call the pastor Tim and uh Tom or Jim um and that's okay to a certain degree um but don't do that in the presence of visitors in the presence of um other officials or anything like that you're going to call the Pastor Dan or John or Tom no praise God brother brother brandham encourage the people yes you can call me uh brother Bram Reverend brandham pastor brandham Pastor Neville but when we're together talk to me brother Bill that's what he told the people he said just call me brother Bill brother Simon you know me as brother Simon right so brother Simon brother Simon it's it's just normal praise the Lord just so you understand that and don't feel bad don't feel embarrassed if sometimes your mind goes back and forth like that that will pass and everything will find its level in its perfect and rightful time God bless you real good and my wife and I I I'll be here for another week or so around but after that we'll be off we'll be off for a while and you won't be seeing us but we know that you are in Good's hand good hands I said I know you're in good [Applause] hands and I know you think I'm talking about brother Danny's hands but I'm talking about God's hands then you're in brother Dan's hands praise the Lord because the the the God's order he we are under his umbrella and then he comes down to the uh local Shepherd pastor and then we are under that umbrella amen then down to the elders and so on so let us commit ourselves to him and let God do a new thing within our Lives May God richly bless you all pray for me as I pray for you amen praise the Lord Brother God bless you real good by the roadway in the wilderness he leads [Music] me is that [Music] I Heaven and Earth
