[0:00] [Music]
[0:13] it is indeed my
[0:15] greatest honor and privilege
[0:19] to have this opportunity
[0:23] to address you
[0:25] [Music]
[0:27] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[0:30] as a servant of the most high god
[0:33] giving me the opportunity to speak
[0:37] to his bride his elected
[0:40] lady for this age
[0:43] i am indeed blessed
[0:46] and on this wednesday night may the lord
[0:49] bless you
[0:50] also with his word
[0:54] as we give glory to him
[0:57] from the book of revelation chapter 2
[1:01] verse 20. here it is
[1:06] notwithstanding i have
[1:09] a few things against thee
[1:13] because thou sufferest the woman
[1:16] jezebel which
[1:20] call it herself a prophetess
[1:23] to teach and to seduce my servants
[1:27] to commit fornication and to
[1:31] eat things sacrificed
[1:35] unto idols gracious father
[1:39] we ask your blessing upon us
[1:43] as we deliver the word
[1:46] to your people to thee be all glory
[1:50] honor and praise
[1:52] in the name of jesus christ
[1:55] amen praise the lord hallelujah
[1:59] praise god our subject for
[2:03] tonight is that woman
[2:07] jezebel that woman
[2:11] jezebel now
[2:14] just uh to let you know
[2:18] god is speaking to the church
[2:23] but in actual fact when he speaks to the
[2:27] church
[2:28] he is speaking to the church as a
[2:31] whole for there is a part
[2:34] of the church that is the
[2:37] true church and
[2:41] a part that is the false
[2:45] church so in the eyes of god
[2:49] both true and false
[2:53] make up the church
[2:56] both whis and tears
[2:59] make up the church
[3:02] and so we find that
[3:06] one part of the church
[3:09] is one that is waiting for judgment to
[3:13] come
[3:14] the white throne judgment
[3:19] but the other part of the church the
[3:21] true church the elect church
[3:24] of the living god she
[3:27] is judging herself
[3:30] now by the word of god
[3:35] so that she will not have to go
[3:39] to that white throne judgment as the
[3:42] scripture tells us
[3:44] that if we judge ourselves here
[3:47] now by the word of god we
[3:51] shall not be judged
[3:54] or we shall not go into that white
[3:57] throne
[3:58] judgment and furthermore
[4:01] in first peter chapter 4
[4:04] verse 7 the bible cl
[4:08] clearly tells us that judgment
[4:12] judgment when does it begin judgment
[4:16] begins in the house of god
[4:21] when the word of god is read declared
[4:24] revealed and understood judgment
[4:28] begins in the house
[4:32] of the lord oh praise
[4:36] god hallelujah now god
[4:39] calls all those who are within
[4:43] the umbrella of the
[4:46] what is called the church they are
[4:49] called
[4:50] christians but you see
[4:54] parts of them are christians according
[4:57] to the flesh
[4:59] while the other part are christians
[5:02] by the spirit true believers
[5:06] by the spirit of god and so these
[5:09] ones that bear the name of christ
[5:13] calling themselves christians actually
[5:17] they're taking his name in vain
[5:21] and they're carrying it in vain for mark
[5:24] 7
[5:25] 7 tells us how be it
[5:29] in vain do they worship me
[5:32] teaching for doctrines the commandments
[5:37] of men
[5:40] listen my friends this is what kind
[5:44] of a christian they are indeed
[5:48] they take christianity just as a
[5:51] religion
[5:52] and as long as they are part of that
[5:55] religion and subscribe to that religion
[5:58] then they uh carry the name
[6:02] of a christian it's just like someone
[6:06] who might uh go into the
[6:10] muhammadan faith and no matter
[6:13] what kind of a life he lives as long as
[6:16] he
[6:17] or she subscribes to the theories
[6:20] of that uh religion then
[6:24] they claim their muhammadan so is it
[6:27] with christianity
[6:29] subscribe to what is today called
[6:33] the christian faith as long as they
[6:36] can say oh i believe jesus is the son of
[6:40] god i believe he
[6:41] died was crucified raised from the dead
[6:44] then and here you see as long as they
[6:47] subscribe
[6:48] to those uh fundamental type of things
[6:53] uh then they claim they're christians
[6:57] but that is just a christian
[7:00] nominally in name only
[7:04] but not in spirit and in nature
[7:08] by the indwelling of the
[7:12] blessed presence of the blessed holy
[7:15] spirit
[7:16] ruling and reigning within the heart
[7:20] of that believer o praise
[7:23] god hallelujah amen
[7:27] yes sir so these nominal
[7:31] christians amen there are
[7:35] not real true christians
[7:38] only a name but not
[7:41] in nature not in spirit
[7:45] whatsoever and so here comes the wheat
[7:49] and the tears growing together and god
[7:53] says leave them alone
[7:57] leave them alone they have a right to be
[7:59] in the field
[8:01] just as much as you have so leave them
[8:04] alone
[8:05] and he god will do
[8:09] his work of separation and judgment
[8:14] but we are not to uproot them
[8:17] we may identify them we may recognize
[8:20] them
[8:20] we may know who they are but we will we
[8:23] should not
[8:24] uproot them because that is
[8:27] god's work that he has reserved
[8:30] to himself so the spirit of god is
[8:34] speaking
[8:35] in this age of sayathira and as it was
[8:39] in the wilderness with israel
[8:42] so is it in in this age
[8:46] that god is speaking to a mixed
[8:49] multitude of believers through
[8:53] and false as they journey
[8:57] not from egypt to canaan
[9:01] but from earth to glory
[9:04] the great holy spirit has
[9:08] a group of mixed multitude
[9:12] believers and here we find
[9:15] he is praising one group
[9:18] while rebuking the other group
[9:22] praising the true believers
[9:26] by assuring them
[9:29] that he god is aware
[9:33] and that he intimately knows
[9:36] and recognizes their works their good
[9:40] works that they are doing and their
[9:43] faithfulness
[9:44] their loyalty to the promises
[9:47] and precepts of the word of god he
[9:50] is telling them i know your works
[9:54] be assured have blessed assurance
[9:58] that i recognize what you're doing
[10:02] but while i'm doing that i
[10:05] must rebuke the false group
[10:10] that is intermingled in your
[10:13] midst that call it themselves
[10:16] christians also so he is rebuking the
[10:20] false vine
[10:22] because they're compromising and
[10:25] tolerating
[10:27] that woman preacher
[10:30] bible teaching woman that
[10:34] claims that she is a prophetess
[10:38] of god having
[10:42] none other but the wicked
[10:45] and evil spirit of jezebel
[10:50] resting upon her and utilizing her
[10:55] and god says because you have
[10:58] legitimizer
[11:00] you have allowed her you have enabled
[11:04] her
[11:04] you have empowered her to go
[11:07] out using my name
[11:11] in vain preaching and
[11:14] teaching contrary
[11:19] to my word god says
[11:23] i rebuke you amen
[11:26] and the true church rebukes such
[11:29] teaching and such actions
[11:33] contrary to the word of god
[11:37] notice carefully what started
[11:41] my friend as just
[11:44] simply a very simple uh
[11:48] feeling you know and that's the way sin
[11:51] starts a feeling
[11:54] you have a good feeling uh going off the
[11:57] word can start right in the church
[12:00] oh a service is going on and you got a
[12:03] good
[12:03] feeling and and you feel that something
[12:08] is is just great and
[12:11] it starts with just a little feeling
[12:16] and from a feeling my friends
[12:20] comes death because from that feeling
[12:24] it starts going into actions and
[12:28] becoming
[12:29] deeds and from the deeds
[12:32] you begin to make it a
[12:36] a doctrine it becomes a fixed idea
[12:39] in the mind or heart and you begin
[12:43] begin to live by it act by
[12:46] it right it becomes like the north star
[12:50] of that person and they begin to act
[12:53] from that point of view and there it is
[12:57] it goes into a doctrine so it was
[13:02] entitled that the teachings went
[13:06] into nicolasian doctrine
[13:10] and that doctrine weakened the church
[13:15] to the point that the church began to
[13:18] embrace
[13:19] the state oh think of that
[13:23] analogy the woman church
[13:27] the white supposedly the wife of the
[13:30] word
[13:31] christ is now embracing
[13:34] the state why because
[13:37] the state is then able
[13:41] to give her the power of money
[13:44] and she embraces with that also
[13:48] paganism at this time
[13:51] oh hallelujah amen
[13:55] in this age we see satan has
[13:59] gone beyond that where he now has his
[14:02] own
[14:03] profit so call of this age
[14:06] and we know that will just lead
[14:09] multitudes millions
[14:11] masses right into the lake
[14:14] of fire my friends
[14:18] let us ask or quest ourselves the
[14:21] question
[14:22] why does god rebuke
[14:26] jezebel well of course the obvious
[14:30] because she calls herself a preacher
[14:34] and god rebukes any woman
[14:38] that would call herself a preacher
[14:42] when the bible clearly tells us
[14:45] she shall not teach nor
[14:49] usurp authority amen
[14:52] that is the word of god it has nothing
[14:55] to do with your education
[14:57] your abilities if you're able if you
[15:00] have the talent
[15:01] if you have the gifts you have the
[15:03] opportunity
[15:05] nevertheless god calls
[15:08] you into obedience of his word
[15:12] regardless of all those things and her
[15:16] word will never change
[15:19] she shall not teach nor your serp
[15:23] authority
[15:24] this is the word of god it speaks of a
[15:28] of women of a woman and
[15:31] also it's speaking my friends
[15:34] of the false church
[15:38] now god is denouncing and rebuking
[15:43] jezebel and you have to understand
[15:47] why he's doing that and to do that
[15:50] let us look back at some of our history
[15:54] as it is spoken of in the
[15:57] bible if we can see
[16:00] what she did back then
[16:04] we can be able to understand
[16:07] what she is doing and will do
[16:11] now and in the future yes
[16:15] modern events are made clear
[16:18] by vindicated prophecy
[16:22] the hand strikes the shadow
[16:25] shadow on the wall and the shadow
[16:29] on the wall tells you the hand that was
[16:32] back here cast the shadows on the wall
[16:36] jezebel back here in the bible
[16:40] her character her nature her spirit
[16:43] her actions and activities her
[16:46] strategies or trickeries
[16:48] all are scheming at all points
[16:52] to what she did then it cannot fail
[16:56] for the form of what was back there
[17:01] cast its shadow on the wall of time
[17:05] here we are first of all
[17:08] jezebel was not a daughter ever
[17:12] of abraham nor was she admitted
[17:16] spiritually and legally into the tribe
[17:21] of israel she was not like rooster
[17:24] muabaitis
[17:26] was redeemed by a kinsmen redeemer
[17:31] on the contrary she was the daughter
[17:35] of king attelbial
[17:38] and he was the king of sidon
[17:43] first kings 16 1631
[17:48] he was the priest the high priest
[17:51] of astarte the false god
[17:55] astarte and he gained the throne
[18:00] by murdering or assassinating
[18:04] his predecessor phillies
[18:07] so we right away we placed her
[18:11] as the daughter of a murderer one
[18:14] having a murderous spirit that makes you
[18:18] think of cain
[18:19] uh because your father was a liar and a
[18:22] murderer
[18:23] from the beginning and friends the same
[18:27] way
[18:29] she came to israel not by
[18:32] god's provided way
[18:36] or god's channel but she came
[18:40] her own way she did not come
[18:44] by the way god ordained a gentile
[18:47] should be should be admitted or allowed
[18:51] to come
[18:52] in and be a part of the tribe
[18:55] of israel she came
[18:58] in by marriage to it to ahab
[19:03] and that marriage was something to
[19:06] behold
[19:08] this marriage this union was
[19:11] not spiritual well absolutely not
[19:16] she married ahab for political reasons
[19:21] like a lot of scheming female
[19:24] today she married him for political
[19:29] reasons and so
[19:33] this woman jezebel was steeped
[19:38] into idolatry and did not have
[19:42] any desire whatsoever
[19:46] to serve jehovah the
[19:49] one true living god
[19:53] on the contrary she vowed
[19:56] that she would do everything in her
[19:59] power
[20:00] to move israel away
[20:04] from the worship of one god to the
[20:07] worship
[20:09] of venus
[20:12] the worship of real the sun
[20:16] god yes sir
[20:19] you see she smelled blood
[20:23] for she recognized that israel had
[20:26] already had a brush
[20:29] with idol worship in the wilderness
[20:33] they were tempted to worship the money
[20:36] the golden calf
[20:38] and there with that temptation
[20:42] uh in their past
[20:45] she could come which is what the devil
[20:48] does to everybody
[20:49] you have a weakness in your past god
[20:52] saves you
[20:53] you come into christ then the devil
[20:56] comes along
[20:57] and plays on that weakness from your
[21:00] past
[21:01] that's why brother branham said we all
[21:04] have a weakness but
[21:05] any boxer knows that you need to protect
[21:09] your weak point
[21:10] amen when you're attacking you got to
[21:13] always protect your weak point amen
[21:16] before you hit the devil
[21:18] because he's looking for your weak point
[21:22] amen oh praise god hallelujah
[21:25] amen from the time ahab
[21:29] married jezebel
[21:32] idolatry began to
[21:35] progress in the
[21:39] nation of israel
[21:42] and this woman this evil woman
[21:46] this wicked fornicating woman
[21:50] she began to build huge
[21:55] temples uh this
[21:58] princess of venus
[22:03] with of course astante
[22:06] that her father was the
[22:09] high priest of
[22:12] she raised up great
[22:15] temples to bail
[22:19] the sunburst the sun god
[22:22] and israel came
[22:25] to a crisis point
[22:29] in the life of the tribe of israel
[22:32] because she jezebel
[22:35] just like our world today uh finds
[22:38] itself
[22:39] in the stranglehold
[22:42] and influence of jezebel
[22:46] with her hands around their trout
[22:49] yes with this in mind as we
[22:53] look to the word of god we
[22:56] reiterate he have
[23:00] married jezebel
[23:03] as a political maneuver
[23:07] and from his point of view he married
[23:10] her
[23:11] to strengthen his kingdom
[23:14] just like constantine
[23:17] married himself to christianity
[23:21] or the false church back there to
[23:24] strengthen
[23:26] his political position his kingdom
[23:30] and secondly he married jezebel
[23:35] to secure his rulership
[23:38] and his kingdom there you go
[23:42] and that is exactly what the church did
[23:46] when it married not ahab but
[23:50] constantine when it married to
[23:53] constantine
[23:55] and together they both had
[23:59] political reasons
[24:02] but of course they put a spiritual
[24:05] atmosphere around this merging
[24:09] this union these this council of nicaea
[24:14] this coming ecumenical council
[24:17] they put a beautiful spiritual
[24:21] atmosphere around it
[24:24] so that it could make the true
[24:27] intents of those who give
[24:31] birth to this monster
[24:34] that is raising its head upon the scene
[24:39] no one should say
[24:42] or be convinced that because
[24:46] constantine had a vision of the cross
[24:49] that that made him a christian he was
[24:53] not he was a pagan
[24:56] matter of fact he was of the line
[24:59] of pontiffs he was the pontiff
[25:04] of the roman church the roman
[25:08] pagan religion of the time
[25:12] and he took on christian trappings
[25:18] because he felt they were lucky and
[25:20] blessed for him
[25:22] he began making crosses
[25:26] he began painting crosses
[25:29] on the shields of his soldiers
[25:32] as protection so called
[25:35] for him and he
[25:39] also know this he
[25:42] is the originator of the
[25:45] knights of columbus
[25:49] that is something else one should look
[25:53] at
[25:54] not necessarily just a religious order
[25:57] but has its political side to it and
[26:00] other parts to it
[26:02] there you find my friends the originator
[26:06] of the knights of columbus and the first
[26:09] one
[26:10] to put a cross on top of a cathedral
[26:15] he placed a cross on saint sophia
[26:20] and started by that a tradition because
[26:24] the other churches started copying from
[26:26] that
[26:27] and now crosses are everywhere
[26:31] as if that's going to scare off the
[26:33] devil
[26:34] as if that's going to make the devil
[26:37] become afraid
[26:39] now it's become like a mascot
[26:43] or some talisman or a magic
[26:46] if you wear it on your chest and it is
[26:49] not
[26:50] because the devil recognizes
[26:54] those who genuinely believe
[26:58] and have caught the revelation of
[27:01] jesus and his name
[27:05] and his actions and his mission
[27:08] here upon the earth amen
[27:13] yes sir so friends
[27:17] constantine his idea
[27:21] lives today even in our day that spirit
[27:26] that anointed him that anti-christ
[27:28] spirit that anointed him
[27:30] is still here with us today it anointed
[27:34] him then speaking in his ears
[27:38] and inspiring him
[27:41] to bring the what was called the church
[27:44] together and make it
[27:48] into one and so constantine
[27:52] got the pagans together got the
[27:55] false nominal church together
[27:59] with the the true church
[28:02] of the living god trying to bring
[28:06] a union for a while it seemed
[28:09] good but when the true believers
[28:13] recognized
[28:15] that they will never be able to turn
[28:19] the minds and hearts of the false ones
[28:22] back to the word they absolutely
[28:26] withdrew from that whatsoever
[28:30] and from that time that they withdrew
[28:32] from
[28:33] that time they were deemed as
[28:36] heretics and that term is still
[28:40] used today for anyone
[28:43] that disagrees disbelieves
[28:47] and disapproves of whatever they
[28:50] teach or propound yes
[28:54] they're called heretics amen
[28:58] oh praise god i'm like
[29:01] paul i believe i'm a heretic
[29:04] like paul in the way they call
[29:07] heresy so worship i the living god
[29:11] of heaven and earth who dwells within me
[29:13] and who
[29:14] lives forevermore or praise his holy
[29:17] name
[29:18] amen my friends they're coming together
[29:23] they're writing all manner of
[29:24] translations of bibles
[29:26] trying to arrive at one supreme
[29:30] translation pro proceeding from the
[29:33] minds
[29:34] and the acuity and brilliance
[29:37] of the minds of men rather than divine
[29:41] revelation and interpretation by the
[29:45] spirit of the living god
[29:47] and they get that bible and they
[29:49] legitimize it
[29:52] as their official bible hold on
[29:56] you think the king james version is
[29:59] wonderful
[30:00] but one one day there will
[30:04] take this king james version and
[30:08] they're going to say it has this against
[30:10] this group
[30:12] in here you have this against this other
[30:16] group over here it speaks against
[30:20] this other group and nothing about it
[30:24] is really uniting and therefore
[30:28] they will do away
[30:31] they will have their own way
[30:35] of doing away with king james
[30:38] and have their versions as i've said
[30:43] they'll do away with the king james
[30:47] version mark it believe it
[30:51] they'll get rid of it by doing away
[30:54] with it by the way i think there is a
[30:58] version already that's called the do
[31:00] away version or
[31:02] do a version oh my but think of it
[31:05] brother sisters
[31:08] that even while we speak
[31:11] that is being done they might have a
[31:15] bible that will satisfy
[31:17] protestant jews and
[31:20] also their pagan
[31:23] faith that they have
[31:27] they had the nicene council back
[31:30] there inspired by
[31:33] the devil true constantine now
[31:37] we're having the ecumenical
[31:41] council being inspired today
[31:45] bringing together all these various
[31:48] faiths while they are fighting
[31:52] the true faith of the living god
[31:56] today as was done back then
[32:00] do you know that when abe ahab married
[32:03] jezebel he
[32:04] sold out his birthright
[32:07] and any man any woman
[32:11] any church themselves
[32:15] into a denomination you
[32:18] sold your birthright
[32:22] if you go join a denomination
[32:26] you're sold your birthright
[32:30] the only thing you can do my brother
[32:33] sister
[32:34] if you're caught in the trap
[32:37] or in the grips of such a
[32:40] denominational system or structure
[32:44] is to heed the word of god in the book
[32:47] of revelation
[32:49] come out of her my people
[32:53] and be not partakers of her sin
[32:58] amen praise god yes
[33:02] it was truly the midnight hour
[33:05] in the life and history of the children
[33:08] of israel at nicaea
[33:12] it was the midnight hour for the church
[33:17] as it went right from that time
[33:22] into the dark ages
[33:26] and i believe my friends
[33:29] it's the midnight hour right now
[33:33] oh can't you hear the midnight cry
[33:37] may god give us a some spiritual
[33:41] paul revere oh i believe
[33:45] such a one has already crossed the land
[33:49] oh my a prophet has
[33:52] crossed the land and people don't
[33:55] understand
[33:56] his preaching his declaration
[34:00] of the word wake up people come alive
[34:04] recognize what is happening in your day
[34:07] and in your time amen yes sir
[34:11] midnight are again and the churches are
[34:15] coming together
[34:16] and those few brothers preachers
[34:19] men of god regardless of where they are
[34:23] that are crying out against such a thing
[34:26] they are counted as heretics they are
[34:29] counted as those that are against
[34:32] unity but they don't understand we're
[34:35] against that
[34:36] form that kind of unity
[34:39] that is contrary to the will
[34:42] and word of the living god
[34:49] married jezebel and
[34:54] immediately he gave her access
[34:58] to state funds state
[35:01] money was now available to her
[35:05] and so she erected two
[35:08] huge houses of worship to astate
[35:12] venus and to bail
[35:16] the sun god that is
[35:20] usually pictured by a sunburst
[35:24] my friends
[35:28] that was big enough she wanted to
[35:31] influence
[35:33] israel to come and worship
[35:36] there and so when constantine
[35:40] married to the church spiritually
[35:42] speaking he began to give them
[35:45] buildings and properties and enriched
[35:47] them and
[35:48] set them up so they can build high
[35:51] altars and and they could get
[35:54] all the great sculptors artists
[35:58] great artwork no doubt about it a lot of
[36:01] these images
[36:02] are a great artwork but god doesn't care
[36:05] about
[36:06] whether it's art whether it's it's
[36:08] beautifully formed
[36:09] that's wonderful to admire it from a
[36:12] human point of view
[36:14] but he says thou shalt not
[36:18] create any graven image thou
[36:21] shalt not bow down before them
[36:24] or nor serve them for i the lord thy
[36:28] god am a living god one
[36:32] true god amen and there is no other god
[36:36] beside him
[36:37] glory to god amen yes sir
[36:40] he did that allowed them
[36:44] to have large buildings money to build
[36:47] great golden altars
[36:51] altars my friends images
[36:55] by the greatest sculptors paintings
[36:58] by the greatest paintings the painters
[37:01] that we may admire today
[37:03] oh think of it and furthermore
[37:07] he organized a
[37:11] hierarchy a hierarchy
[37:14] of priesthood and order
[37:18] in other words he was going to do better
[37:20] than god
[37:21] and he was going to set up or organize
[37:25] in an orderly fashion
[37:28] the priesthood the way he thinks it
[37:31] should be
[37:32] just like satan god has his order
[37:35] of a five-fold ministry of preachers
[37:38] teachers
[37:39] evangelists pastors so administrators
[37:42] god
[37:42] has it his order but now satan
[37:46] creates his own and sets up
[37:49] this hierarchy that on the surface
[37:52] appears
[37:53] to be more organized
[37:57] orderly and systematic
[38:01] that you can know when a bell
[38:05] is supposed to be wrong when a certain
[38:09] type of sermon is supposed to be
[38:11] preached
[38:12] when certain words to be said he's got
[38:15] it
[38:15] all lined up none of this business
[38:19] where a man or can speak the word of god
[38:23] by revelation or suddenly say
[38:26] something by inspiration no that is not
[38:30] permitted
[38:31] you must go by the laid out
[38:34] order that is before him but i thank god
[38:37] for the holy spirit
[38:40] i take god for the presence of god
[38:43] in our lives to lead us and guide us
[38:46] so jezebel got the power of the state
[38:50] behind her
[38:51] and the moment she got that behind her
[38:55] she began to force the people
[38:58] to accept her religion
[39:01] how so later we find out
[39:05] my friends in the bible how she killed
[39:09] the prophets
[39:10] god's holy sages and prophets
[39:15] until elijah felt he was the only
[39:20] one left of course god had to reveal to
[39:23] him
[39:24] that he had seven thousand others but
[39:26] there were hidden up
[39:28] he had them living a hidden life
[39:32] as such oh my friends
[39:36] and here we find out right in the midst
[39:40] of
[39:42] nationalism there are thousands out
[39:45] there
[39:47] who are children of god
[39:50] and god has to wake them up to that fact
[39:53] that though they are in there they're
[39:56] not
[39:57] from there but they are they were only
[40:00] allowed to
[40:00] pass through there just as much as jesus
[40:04] was not from mary but he only
[40:08] passed through mary so that he could
[40:11] come
[40:12] into human manifestation
[40:15] and so god is calling you to a birth
[40:19] come out of her my people and
[40:22] be not partaker of
[40:25] her plagues amen back to
[40:28] god back to the word amen and in
[40:31] speaking this way recognize
[40:34] brother william myron branham was never
[40:38] against the people of god
[40:41] or the individual people in
[40:44] these various churches but what
[40:48] he was and is what i
[40:51] am what every other true
[40:54] servant of the living god is against
[40:58] is the system of denominationalism
[41:03] the structures the organizations
[41:06] that have a get out there because
[41:10] god hates it and if god hates it
[41:13] then we hate it and we're against the
[41:16] systems
[41:17] also that are out there
[41:21] remember all this started entire torah
[41:25] my friends where the people
[41:29] began to worship apollo the sun
[41:32] god amen the same
[41:35] veil sun god yes sir
[41:39] and how these people were
[41:42] began to teach the people to worship
[41:46] not by the scripture but by temple
[41:49] rights
[41:50] and temple traditions and
[41:54] by bringing services to the gods
[41:58] and sacrifices to their so-called saints
[42:03] gods that they had
[42:06] and they began to teach about
[42:10] death and life
[42:13] amen and they were doing their teaching
[42:17] at that time in taiseira through a
[42:21] prophetess
[42:24] by the name of jezebel
[42:28] who sat on a tree
[42:31] pronged stool or chair
[42:34] similar to the church of this age
[42:39] that sits on the
[42:42] comfortability in the tree-prong chair
[42:46] of trinitarian doctrine and
[42:49] speaking from that point of view all her
[42:53] teaching
[42:54] comes from that point of view and
[42:56] history says
[42:57] she had to go into a trance and then she
[43:01] would begin
[43:02] to become a voice for satan of course to
[43:05] speak
[43:06] true as god speaks through his prophets
[43:10] satan began to speak through this
[43:13] so-called prophetess teaching and
[43:16] seducing the servants of god
[43:19] to commit fornication which of course is
[43:22] speaking
[43:23] of idol worship began to have them
[43:27] going into idol worship
[43:30] ahab's union constantine union
[43:34] were illegal and
[43:38] both committed spiritual fornication
[43:42] against god oh my
[43:46] every fornicator will find themselves
[43:50] in the lake of fire god help you natural
[43:53] or spiritual
[43:54] you'll find yourself in the lake of fire
[43:57] and so we find the teaching
[44:02] of the catholic church
[44:06] and you know our church is typified as
[44:09] female
[44:10] or as a woman this
[44:13] church denies the word of god
[44:18] they have a modern version of the god
[44:21] apollo
[44:22] the sun god and that modern virgin
[44:26] of course is a pope
[44:31] amen and the church itself
[44:36] has become the prophet yes
[44:39] through whom the false god apollo
[44:44] speaks his orders through that
[44:47] church and give to the people
[44:52] rather than the scriptures the ideas of
[44:55] men
[44:57] they give you their thoughts of what
[44:59] they believe
[45:01] constitutes the forgiveness of sins
[45:05] their gifts to you their teaching of
[45:08] what they think
[45:10] is the blessing of god and some of the
[45:13] priests have gone so far
[45:16] as to categorize state
[45:19] that that there is a place called
[45:22] purgatory
[45:23] which does not exist in scripture
[45:26] anywhere
[45:27] nowhere in the word of god
[45:31] you can't find it they teach prayers
[45:35] they teach masses and money
[45:39] will get you out of the trap of
[45:43] purgatory
[45:44] if you got caught in there money can
[45:47] take you out
[45:48] printers and masses and candles can take
[45:50] you out
[45:52] and you see the whole system
[45:55] is based on false teaching
[45:58] contrary to the this word
[46:02] of the living god read your bible
[46:05] it's in the book amen don't get
[46:08] upset or angry with me
[46:12] are angry with the prophet
[46:17] william branham of whom i speak
[46:20] who is the one who god used
[46:23] to place his word so we
[46:27] his sons and daughters and servants of
[46:30] the living god
[46:32] can draw on that from that inspired by
[46:35] it
[46:36] and be able to preach and teach the word
[46:39] of god
[46:39] with power with us and with authority
[46:43] for the glory of his name yes
[46:48] they base their faith
[46:51] on the sinking signs of diabolical
[46:55] satanic untruths contrary
[46:58] to the word of god and saw the church
[47:02] has moved from organization
[47:06] to denominations that are spouting
[47:10] false teaching they don't even believe
[47:16] in the word of god where they'll say
[47:19] you say the word of god but the church
[47:22] says
[47:23] so and so you say the word of god says
[47:26] this
[47:26] but my church says this you see
[47:30] they have replaced the word of god with
[47:33] the word
[47:34] or teaching of the church contrary and
[47:38] in rebellion
[47:40] to the genuine word of god
[47:43] amen oh praise god forevermore
[47:47] friends i tell you the bible remains
[47:51] true
[47:52] let god's word be true
[47:56] and every other man's word
[48:00] be alive oh
[48:03] praise god revelation
[48:06] 17 amen
[48:10] we see this woman who has been living
[48:14] her entire historical life
[48:18] on a diet of false prophecies
[48:21] and not the word of god
[48:24] god calls her a
[48:27] oh that is the word of god
[48:31] himself that she is in idolatry
[48:36] and she trapped and caught the people
[48:40] into the very same thing
[48:43] what is the cure for this spiritual
[48:46] idolatry
[48:48] their word of god back to the bible
[48:51] back to the word there is your
[48:54] prescription
[48:55] there is your strong medicine there
[48:58] is the cure for idolatry
[49:02] for the word of god says this woman
[49:06] is a because she has
[49:09] left the word of god
[49:13] and she is sitting or ruling
[49:17] upon this great many
[49:20] waters multitudes millions of people
[49:23] billions
[49:24] masses of people she rains and rules
[49:28] over them and that is the false church
[49:32] because the true church of the living
[49:34] god is small
[49:36] for he himself said fear not little
[49:39] flock
[49:41] it is your father's good pleasure to
[49:44] give you the fullness of the word the
[49:47] full the kingdom amen
[49:50] notice she is like in the eyes of god
[49:54] what she is like
[49:55] in god's eyes no matter what she says
[49:58] about herself
[50:00] no matter when you look with your
[50:02] natural eyes like
[50:03] john in the book of revelation wondered
[50:06] with admiration
[50:08] you look with your natural eyes
[50:10] beautiful how it may seem how wonderful
[50:13] she looks to people
[50:14] how philosophical she sounds to people
[50:18] but the bible says she is rotten
[50:21] she is filthy she is unclean
[50:25] and she is a drunken drunkard
[50:28] a drunk woman tipping her way home
[50:32] drunk on her lies and her idolatry
[50:37] and her fornications drunk
[50:40] with the blood of the martyrs yes
[50:43] like jezebel who killed the prophets
[50:46] before her
[50:49] even so my friends
[50:52] we find this church today has
[50:55] killed will kill and continue to kill
[51:00] those who will not bow down before her
[51:03] nor subscribe to her teachings and
[51:08] her traditions and litanies so called
[51:12] yes sir amen praise god
[51:15] she'll use all her cruel methods
[51:19] but this church that deals in death
[51:24] the bible says she is dead herself
[51:28] amen she that lived in sin
[51:32] is dead while she appears or
[51:36] thinks that she is still alive and there
[51:38] is no
[51:39] life in her whatsoever because the
[51:42] spirit of god says
[51:44] that amen oh my friends
[51:48] that church is even more wicked and evil
[51:51] than ahab himself
[51:52] for ahab even repented for a while
[51:56] at one time yes sir
[52:00] but you can't say that about this church
[52:02] they refuse to
[52:04] apologize for any wrongs
[52:07] that they do and even if they do they
[52:10] they just mouse words and continue to do
[52:14] it through the centuries
[52:16] the very same murders evils
[52:19] the very same uh cruelties
[52:23] the very same things repeating
[52:26] over and over and she gets away with it
[52:30] and john shook his head and wandered
[52:32] with admiration
[52:34] at the scheming cunning evil
[52:38] wickedness of this evil church
[52:41] this woman was never repented
[52:45] and stubbornly destroyed anyone
[52:48] and all who stands in her way
[52:52] or tried to preach the word and help her
[52:55] to repent
[52:57] god raised up messengers she keeps
[53:00] destroying those
[53:02] wonderful messengers and their helpers
[53:06] martin columba patrick
[53:10] joan of arc many others wiped out
[53:13] carried away
[53:15] and then turn around and claim as if
[53:17] there were har
[53:18] from her or they were her own when they
[53:21] were
[53:22] not they were from and in the word of
[53:25] god
[53:25] she is drunk she has lost her
[53:28] senses towards spiritual things
[53:32] a carnal foolish fleshly
[53:35] lustful unclean heartlet
[53:38] to the word of the living god amen
[53:41] she repents not of our slaughter of our
[53:45] saints of the saints of god
[53:47] during the dark ages she is attempting
[53:51] now to unite with protestants
[53:55] making and tweaking her creeds
[53:58] to line up a little bit with the
[54:01] protestant
[54:02] teachings her daughter's teachings
[54:06] yes sir now oh and she never
[54:10] will apologize for her mass murders
[54:14] in every form whatsoever
[54:17] she want no matter how mellow
[54:20] take this warning that no matter how
[54:24] mellow
[54:26] like a cat no matter how sweet
[54:29] and purry and furry she appears
[54:34] to be no matter how
[54:37] she will rise up to kill again
[54:41] she will rise up to murder again
[54:46] she will rise up with another
[54:50] inquisition another
[54:53] tortures and cruelties again
[54:56] for murder and evil
[54:59] lies within the empty
[55:02] caverns of our heart and it reverberates
[55:07] and echoes once again within
[55:11] this age of thyatira may
[55:14] god bless you may god bless our hearts
[55:17] together
