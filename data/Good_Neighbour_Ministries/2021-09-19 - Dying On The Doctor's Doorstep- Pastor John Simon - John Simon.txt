richly we are going to go to the word of god praise god we welcome back those of you who were who haven't been here and those of you who went away and returned we appreciate you very much pray god will bless you in a mighty and wonderful way praise the lord now let us look to our bibles amen and we're reading from the uh gospel of of luke amen chapter 5 verses reading from verse 27 to 32. praise the lord shall we read and after these things he went forth and saw a publican named levi sitting at the receipt of customs and he said unto him follow me and he left all rose up and followed him and levi made him a great feast in his own house and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them but their scribes and viruses murmured against his disciples saying why do you eat and drink with publicans and sinners and jesus answering said unto them they that are whole need not a physician but later the sick i came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance amen lord bless his word to her hearts father we thank you for the reading of the scriptures now we pray father you will bring our hearts our thoughts our minds together in harmony and unity and oneness one accord so that your spirit may flow through the word and bless us all together as we come in your name amen and amen praise the lord god bless you now uh today uh i just want to talk to you um and let the holy spirit speak to our hearts amen in other words this is not uh a deep uh topic uh so much as one that is most practical one that we must pay attention to amen i want to first of all let me um look here to what i want to talk about i want to talk about dying on the doctor's doorstep dying on the doctor's doorstep the problem right now this world you know it's sick and we have this world is like a patient that's very very ill because we see right now you know the whole world is sick with coven is that right the whole and literally the world is a sick world that we're living in and it's sick with covid everywhere that we return to we know that the earth is also sick and we know that's been very clear to us from the bible revelation 3 and from the prophet that the church is sick and we know society right on down to the individual is sick so there is no shortage of patients the hospitals are bulging with patients and everywhere everything seems to be sick we find out as i've just touched on that the earth itself is sick i want to give you a quotation here if i can find it here amen now the world is made by the word of god you know that it's framed together by the word that's the only thing that will keep it together amen see that's the only thing that will do that praise god hallelujah uh okay praise god amen just a moment here i'm just trying to find something directly where he spoke on that directly said it here now now let me show you the reason that the world is sick and the world has got to do it the the frame of this world with all the iron and all the brass and the materials of this earth has been pulled out of it it's framework it's pulled out for war for industry that's you know money-making business until now she's just about ready to go we've never had an earthquake till the other day over here now you see it's everywhere she's getting so thin that's the earth she's getting sin praise god because all everything is taken off from her frame if she was just a full woman now her body or framework he said she's getting sin right oh my why she's getting so thin because they've pulled everything out of it amen see it's politics so polluted is hardly any honest among them it's its system polluted its morals law and its religion it's just conquered sick yes sir very it's time for that sick seal pretty soon to open up and when she does oh my it ends the bride has gone forth she's done the queen has done went to take her place married to the king while all this is going on hallelujah and now it's time israel's remnant to be sealed and ready to go amen glory to god do you believe that i'm telling you that the very earth that we're standing on building on is sick and we're being told why it's sick that took out all the vitamins all the framework all the minerals all because of what war all because of what commerce in the stream money making amen while they're doing that they are becoming a patient because if you're sick jesus said some people but let me just pause here some people think when they're sick they don't need a doctor is that right i may not go and read all the quotes but i'm just going to talk to you i'm going to just pick them up when i feel like it brother branham said nonsense he says people a fellow saying he needs no doctor nonsense amen you jesus he said himself says this the sick needs a doctor hallelujah it's the whole that doesn't need a doctor but he says jesus himself in the word says if you're sick you need a doctor hallelujah i have quotations here where he says i respect doctors he says and god anoints them with whatever talents they have and uses them for the healing of the sick and any good they can do is for the glory of god we can touch on that we're going to touch on that a little later but nonsense to people talking another place he says they're talking about they're going to believe like the blood and they have faith in god so you have to go to a doctor i'll show you where he said listen matter of fact it's right in front of me i'm saying it and some it's in front of me here he said here now oh my a good honest doctor hallelujah he will do all he can with all the power that god will give him to operate on you and do things that he can to help you amen well i just have to tell you there's more than i this one is more than i can do if you want if he's an honest doctor he'll tell you go see another doctor get another opinion amen then you go to another doctor and you say nothing can be done it's too far advanced see when he says that now that is the time you go to god is that right you used up all the natural resource he placed these things naturally here for you to use you don't even touch that and you want to go direct to him not that he will answer you sometimes but the main thing is what he placed down here for you to use brother branham in this quotation he used that is the time that is the time that is the time that is the time that is the time over and over again to emphasize when he's telling you that is the time when you're really going to go and cry out to god but not from the very beginning the moment you feel something you you just run to god at the first thing that's okay too but he says use the doctors use hallelujah now that is the time that is the time you must begin to call on the sixth sense that is the time for you to go and accept god now i repeat that is the time for you now to rely upon your spirit of faith that god has put in you for god to heal you amen lord of god amen but you go to god before you try or you go to all the other things he put on the earth for you he put herbs he put medicines he put scientists he inspired them right because you know the quotes are here where he says god inspired him with an injection an inoculation a toxin and then you are so stubborn you are so stubborn and he uses another term he says you with your stubbornness you really are selfish you become selfish you become stubborn and you're rejecting the very thing god sent to you because god he says anoint that scientist with an inoculation another quote he says he says i pray god will will inspire uh them scientists for an injection that will even wipe out cancer oh god give them an uh an inoculation and invent an injection that will kill tuberculosis oh god it's three times he's going like that give them spread is the scientist he prayed for give them an inoculation some toxin that will wipe out whatever else is going to come amen he's praying for them he says oh god let it be my praise god hallelujah oh but we get so spiritually minded sometimes we know earthly good for our own selves and we reject the very thing god sends for us amen of course there's all kinds of excuses or they might put this in the medicine they might put that in the medicine maybe they change your rna your dna your this your that whatever what does a real christian have to think and worry about such nonsensical things you're starting to think like the world your mind going off on the things of the world when you start to think with all these conspiracies and all these ideas use chaos in your mind the bible tells us in the book of mark already if you are in your duty walking as a christian and serving god thou shalt eat any or drink any deadly thing and it shall not hurt you that doesn't mean you're gonna go i'm gonna prove god that i'm gonna put my hand in this barrel of snakes and poison us and if they bite me i can't die no that's you you're provoking god you you're just being nonsensical foolish that way to push your hand in like that our prophet said you're going to go take a bottle of medicine of a poison and go drink it you're not going to deliberately drink a bottle of poison to go prove god no you don't do that but if hallelujah you're in the line of service you're serving him faithfully you believe in his word you drink any somebody tries to poison you even your doctor any one of them try to poison you trying to kill you he says they shall drink any deadly thing and it shall not hurt them praise god hallelujah you know i was really going to speak on satan's prison house today but then during towards actually the end of the week somebody that was sick very ill called for prayer amen oh my and prayer was made and what want to thank god the person is out of the hospital because the doctor says well we don't know what happened the spine should have been broke they they should have been paralyzed or in a terrible situation but hallelujah their home walking with some pain but delivered by the power of god you see when the doctors don't know what to do they get to a point where the brand said when they go to that point that's when you start to pray and talk to god but once they can handle it naturally you don't really have to go to him not that you can't but you really shouldn't be going to him for all those little things but when he says they come to the end of their knowledge their wisdom and what they know oh my then they ought to give you over to a specialist hallelujah and if the specialists don't know what to do then if he's a good man he'll hand you over to that great physician jesus christ hallelujah amen a great physician now is there a sympathizing jesus he speaks the drooping heart to chair or hear the voice of jesus christ amen they make jokes about it they're being lit but you don't understand oh praise god listen he says here one place he says you don't understand that they make an automobile and you take that to get fixed amen and when you are sick hallelujah and they can't fix it in any way you take it back to him now for he is your creator hallelujah your creator oh praise god i want to tell you today jesus can fix it maybe you have a situation in your life right now jesus can fix it maybe you're sick with what the doctors say is incurable amen jesus can fix it no matter what your situation is you must believe the true report you must believe the word of god by his stripes we are healed glory to god hallelujah is this what they call a healing service is this what they call a miracle service anything can happen if you believe the word of god the power of the holy spirit strike your soul amen put your back on your good foot and let you run watch out and praise his holy name amen lord of god hallelujah amen my my my brother sister i'm so glad we serve a true on the living god aren't you happy for that amen so the earth is sick they're pulling out all the things out of it and we find out that the world is sick the morals of the world is sick society morally bankrupt ill weak sickly most of all we see jesus prophesying the rise of heart failure in the end times for men's hearts shall fail them at that time for fear he predicted a rise in heart failure and then we have a prophet of this 20th century that prophesied the rise of mental illness for it shall come to pass that the entire world will go insane hallelujah praise god and we see it and we hear it every day the rise in mental illness why he says because of the pressure amen because of the pressure but thank god he said for that bride for that elect that holds to god's word the word is the one the thing that lets you let off the pressure praise god you can go in your prayer closet brother bill you can go in the quietness before god you can get still and know he is god and whatever pressure you feel on you you can the spirit of god can calm down your entire spirit your entire mind and your body comes back relaxed in prayer before god you don't need yoga for that i said you don't need yoga you don't need all the buddhist meditations you don't need none of that all you need is to listen to the word of god and relax and let god have his way within your world worry worry worry worry worry about this worry about that worry about that when the word of god just simply you just say it simply and you pass it and you don't even bother casting all your cares upon me for he cared for you you heard what he said there cast your cares your worries come up we are wondering and worrying how we are going to work it out but he didn't tell you that he said you cast the worries on me cast the cares on me you don't have to think how you're going to work it out god is going to working out [Applause] if you place your life in his hands and ask him do all you can and then let god step into the situation and he's gonna work it out praise god hallelujah the world is in a mess amen oh brother sister i tell you they're sick everywhere air must knew israel's ungodly lovers will someday destroy her and let me say with reverence to the every believer here today will know that the world of this america america's ungodly lovers they are going to destroy her you love politics they'll destroy her amen let me let that anchor in you for a minute you heard what he said her politics is going to destroy her because they love politics destroy that will that's talking about politics that will destroy this nation amen and you your love of the world not coming up with the word and not trying to do what's right by the word will also destroy the church amen denominationalism going along with nationalism women welded together one going down the road of politics the other one going the other way and what happens both becomes destroyed amen all these denominations destroyed because they reject the word of god hallelujah in the form of court i used he started out by saying you know the world is framed by the word of god spiritually then he suddenly switched he says but the framework of the earth with all the minerals and things he says they're pulling that out now if you're spiritual just switch back your mind where he talked about the world frame by the word of god well if you start taking out the minerals of the word you take out the revelation from the word you take out the vitamins from the world you take out the b12 from the word to give you blue stuff energy oh my goodness he said everything will what world's falling apart everything is going to fall apart because you don't have the word in it anymore and once the word is not in it brother glenn it's got to fall apart because everything is kept and held together by the word of the living god the church falls apart sick amen hallelujah he said what is it the world falling apart he said the whole thing is beginning to become corrupt they may the word of god of not affect by their traditions so the whole world system is falling apart every nation looking for some one looking for some other system some new system that could bring them out of it out of that something that they could use that will hold their nation together right there are so corrupted that they know they couldn't hold out the way they're going on and there was looking for something to hold them together if that isn't a picture of our world today i don't know oh my everything this world today looking for a system or something that will hold it together amen something that would keep it from falling apart and so now here it is again it's repeating again right national life is now uncertain the world has become uncertain right living in a place where the world is now going through nervousness and enormous prostration oh my every nation everybody one is afraid of the other they all talking peace amen oh my they said oh when we fight the whole the first world war and we finish with that that will settle all wars he says they didn't even get the smoke from the fanned out of the air until we were ready for another world war then when they finished that they had a league of nations that they're gonna put out there called that's going to police the whole world and that fell true now they put together something they're calling the united nations and it's just the same thing trying an experiment to find this uh some kind of a system that will hold things together amen there's nothing to it everything is shaky national life political life even devoting machines oh my they've got the whole thing shook up everything is sick everything is shook up oh my it's all gone corruption on every hand my brother all we can do is hold to god's unchanging hand hold to god's unchanging hand build your hopes on things that turn [Music] o my hold to god trust in him who will not leave you no matter what the world will bring your way he will not leave you he said i'll be with you i'll be even in you to the very end of the age hallelujah amen praise god praise god hallelujah glory to god church sick earth sick the world's sick look i'm not even expanding on these things you can take that i'm not talking about the contamination i'm not talking about the pollution you know just go search search these things out talks about the pollution how they're going to destroy themselves with the pollution how they're going to destroy themselves amen what we got with us now we got the whole climate change on the earth already amen everything is heating up is that right oh my you got fire on one side flood on the other side is that right oh my they said this winter it's going to be stormy and snowy amen extra cold in some places and extra warm in some places that's supposed to be cold it's all mixed up they got the whole thing messed up amen they got the world falling to pieces but thank god we serve the prince of peace hallelujah he can bring peace amen by trusting in jesus christ amen oh hallelujah glory to god amen oh my goodness then when you look to the individuals just like they like the priests it's all like the people people rebellious the people know it all they got wisdom they have knowledge they don't have to listen to no preacher they don't have to listen to the doctor they don't have to listen to the scientists they don't have to listen to any of the powers that god said i put these powers above you oh bad how you live these powers higher powers that i put above you render to caesar the things that are caesar and the kings that of god rendered to god amen they won't even do that basic they have some disrespect for the government and government power listening to the people of the world getting influenced by the people of the world and not listening to the word of god amen he said look even if you think they're bad i put them there to be a terror amen he said to do what it's actually to keep those evil ones from destroying you because they they're there with that kind of power to keep in line those wicked evil ones and this earth hair from destroying you so even that he's using to protect you so the government is doing their job and we are supposed to understand that the government didn't tell you stop preaching in the name of jesus christ well we know that we ain't going to listen to that is that right they're not telling you nothing like that oh don't do this don't baptize in that name don't pray for they're not telling you anything like that amen and you're running off healthy skeleton listening to all these people tell you all kinds of this and that watching you too with all kind of videos about this did you hear this do you hear that do you hear that that's another jackass theory you're coming onto [Applause] amen oh i hear this i hear that i hear you that's all you're full of no back to the word back to this bible amen back to the truth of the gospel of jesus christ amen let me tell you the government of morsi why do you think the government have parks because they know pressure is going to build up in the community in the minds of people and they need somewhere where they can connect back with nature and let off their pressure those are the natural means of allowing us to let off pressure is that right why do you think the government don't outlaw parties unless they go out of the boundaries of the laws they set they don't outlaw it because they know but that i don't believe in all that worldly dancing and carrying on but i'm understanding why the government is doing this and allowing this they they're not a sunday school they're the government so they're allowing that it's to let the people let off their pressures let off their worries let off their you know their drink they carry on this and that yup it's all wrong but the government understands they're letting off their pressure why do you think the government allowed churches to function and be tax-free you think the government is stupid it's because they want to lose money they are saving money because more people are keeping their mental health by coming in the church and serving god then they're going to have to go and pay in psychiatric hospitals out there and the government knows it so ministers regardless of what denomination they're from they're serving their purpose hallelujah listen listen my friends i am like myself and my brothers uh we wrestle in the house and you know we tumble up the bed and we fall down everything else like that and carry on like that but then when i go to the school and being as short as i was and some big tough guy come and push me around i know i can't beat him but when school is over and i see my big brother comes out i walk up to the guy knowing that my brother is looking i said who was that you were pushing this morning wow lord of god well that's what you got to do with the devil when you know jesus is back of you amen then you start to push him around because you know god is on your side by his traps you're healed you're delivered you're set free you're healed amen all god asked believe it hallelujah he said oh but i didn't see the thing gone he didn't ask did you see it did you feel it he said do you believe it as long as you believe it you can receive what you believe it may go instantly it may take a period of time but it will go is that right oh my glory to god hallelujah brother sister let's look to this word of god there's more things in this word that we haven't even tapped into us yet i thank god for the wonderful man of god that god went before us i thank god for the storehouse this is there before us listen i said it will come to pass before the end time comes there will be a great woman that will stand up in the united states because she will rise up either to be president or put this into parenthesis perhaps maybe the woman being beautiful and attractive may also be the catholic church is that right but cruel at heart and she will lead the nation which whichever or whoever that woman is and i'm not suggesting anybody here i am just giving you the quote heir he's saying that woman which means she will become president will lead the nation to pollution and he's using the reference of what happened to israel how jezebel polluted israel and then he's saying this one that will come in the end time is going to lead the nation to pollution right and then it shall be come to pass at that time there will have an automobile perfected at that time into a place i looked and seen a family driving in an automobile that was glassed up and didn't have any steering wheel in it i seen the other day in popular mechanics that a machine like that has now already invented you can take that machine anywhere you want to and you will go anywhere by some sort of uh i don't know what some sort of radar control just set your post to this it goes right just set your post or place to this and it will just go right on you don't even need to do anything and remember it's glass top amen i just thought i'd drop that by you to see that we're living in that time now [Music] we're living now in that time we are living witnesses of it because this was spoken since 1933 [Music] amen a prophet speaking thus saith the lord well somebody's going to say well you know he says it could be in the year uh 1977 it could be this yeah but they don't uh understand he said it could be a hundred years it could be a thousand years from now i do not know i predict i do not prophesy i don't know but amen i just in other words he's saying i'm just telling you what i've seen amen exact time and all that kind of stuff that you worry about that but i'm telling you what i see and i seen this car driving like that we already have them moving now they're perfecting right now amen hallelujah oh my another place he said i looked and seen a family sitting there the car taking them wherever they want to go and they're eating and drinking and playing cards and not even paying attention to the road or nothing because the car is taking them there amen hallelujah brother sister what times are we living in oh praise god i think it's later than many people think amen yes sir oh my yes think of it brother sister so we got a the hospitals bulging with patients from florida to texas to california to almost everywhere the hospitals are bouncing with patients they don't have place to put that anymore and the the world the church it's bulging with patients right now oh my but what's the use you have in patients and you don't have a doctor you turn up to the hospitals just before i left home they were saying people were driving from one state going all the way to california some are heading up to washington the moment they hear that let the the one hospital ease up ease up with amount of people in it and uh they rush over there in droves in their cars by the time they get there it filled up again in the hospital we can't take you but the thing about it the one doctor said is it's not because people are getting better that the hospital is emptying out he says because they're dying so fast and when they die out and we have a space more come rushing in to take that space oh my god have mercy brother sister you there's no lack of patience but you know what jesus said they that the they that are whole they don't need the physician and when some of these people are whole and they're well and they're hearty and healthy they can talk all they want uh i i i don't have time to go searching for the quote he said sometimes god get to let some of those very things come on you right sometimes he will let them come and grab a hold of you he said are somebody close to you he said then we start to pay attention then we want to listen i've seen you seen it on tv oh i'm not going to take no injection i'm not going to do this i'm going to do that next thing you know when a woman sees her husband gone he gets it by morning and by night or the next day he's gone right the next thing you know her child got oh oh my goodness all of a sudden she's telling the wrestle children you got to get that you got to get it now right now come let me take you let's turn around right the other way but why you have to wait for that to happen why didn't you believe amen praise god hallelujah god have mercy that that does not have to happen to us like that amen praise god so we have the patience but with the patience and with the sickness and illnesses we got a problem and the problem is that the patients don't want the cure the patients don't want to take the medicine and the prophet is speaking of this in several places he says them patients wouldn't want to take the medicine he says and when that happens it's not the doctor's fault he said it's not there and he used the word scientist's fault he said and it wouldn't be the medicine fault he said with the fault of the patient who refused to take the medicine that was provided for them will be your own fault amen for not taking the medicine that was provided for you you can't blame the toxin because science was allowed to find it for the disease amen that's the way it is oh my listen here we are what good can the doctor do amen if the doctor comes and the sick will not accept him amen we need the doctor we need them to take his medicine you need that patient to take this medicine for we are living in a sick world we are living in a sick church he says and we are at a sick time that we are in at this time and if that patient dies on the doctor's doorstep you can't blame that doctor amen oh my just because the patient sits on his steps and turns around and says i'm going in there to take no remedy oh my an honest doctor will work his hardest with all the power that god will give him oh my but when he gets so far advanced he can't do anything anymore that's the time you believe god that's the time to call on the sixth sense that's the time to accept god that's the time to rely upon the spirit of faith that god has put in you oh blessed be the name of the living god hallelujah you know sometimes it will have to get around you and get right into your house to make you begin to wander and call where jesus is is that right some people don't want to have the remedy they don't want the doctor no oh i'm just going to believe god i'm just going to believe the word that's all right buddy told you we place doctors herbs and things on the earth here for that purpose and you want to walk past it and run straight to him sometimes he'll listen but you go by god's provided way oh my oh my goodness go by god's provided way see he says think about it amen sometimes that has to get around your house or get like that to make you call and wonder where jesus is you ever seen that oh my they're talking big and they're talking much i'm talking about this and then when trouble strikes the first person they call oh jesus oh god i thought you said there was no god i thought you said god wasn't a healer why are you calling on him now how come he's the first person come to your mind come on your lips right away you're calling his name why are you calling his name all the time you don't want to call his name or you're using his name as a cursed word and all of a sudden now when you need help you call his name he told you in the first place when you have trouble calling up is that right jesus on the royal telephone call him up jesus on the main line call him up you're sick call him up you're in trouble call him up you'll be on the job and all and the boss carrying on everything else you don't have to go shouting oh i'm a christian and you're yelling all kinds of stuff just come down on the inside call on the man upstairs this is right you have a boss but you got the boss of bosses is that right praise the lord trust him trust the lord jesus trust this word amen yes sir trust every word that god has spoken and he will surely bring it to pass hallelujah think of it now think of this doctor having a toxin injection i forgot to bring my yellow there was a yellow vaccination book that i have it at home somewhere where they used to give you if you wanted to travel you couldn't oh you got one oh glory to god who told you to bring this see how god works in mysterious ways hallelujah amen it was so much in my thoughts to bring the one i have at home you got you couldn't travel unless you have one of these is that right you go on a plane and something like that which they wouldn't hardly let you on the plane but if somehow you slip by and you got on the plane you land in the other country and you don't have this to show you going back on it and go right back where you come from is that right and you got to have yellow fever vaccine you got to have the tyria you have a whole bunch of different things typhoid malaria a bunch of things matter of fact i think uh i sent a quotation to a few brothers where brother branham said uh i have to go uh overseas and now he says you know they're using me like a guinea pig they got a whole bunch of vaccination injections i have to get he says but you know that i don't really need that but they told me to take it and i'm taking all of them hallelujah he's taking them he never told anybody oh don't don't take that just believe god no no no he says no i am taking the vaccines is that right and he took them so that he could go and do whatever he has to do hallelujah my friends i use this and i i had to do that every year amen going to the sudan going among all those sick people going in the middle of the war had to have it go to the refugee camp in kenya uh amen had to have it you go in different parts praise god down to whether it's fiji or wherever you got to have it you don't have it they turn your back now the government says oh we have to revive that we need to have a vaccination passport and now people are acting like if it's something new is that right meanwhile they already have it in the schools that if your child don't have this they don't have this they can't go to the school because you're going to infect the other kids all right oh it's good for your kids but we we don't want no vaccine we don't want to have no no we don't want to have no passport and this and that it's idiotic thinking it's foolish thinking it's the thinking of the world and the church is sick because some of it is coming into the minds of people right in the church amen and i rebuke that spirit here today in the name of jesus christ of the glory of god [Applause] out leave the house of god leave the children of god leave the people of god lose the minds of god's children be delivered from the poisoning of the mind glory to god hallelujah amen think about it like that the doctor you got a certain disease the doctor got the medicine on the inside but you just say i ain't going in there why are you not going in there i don't like the doctor is who gonna die the doctor or you you're just gonna die because you don't like the doctor or i'm not gonna die but you're taking a chance with your life not the doctor's life your life you're taking a chance with the doctors that's in the message called why he says i don't like the doctor i'm not going to take his medicine right you see my the doctor is willing he's waiting patiently on the patient amen and he's got plenty of it it's because the patient don't want to come and take that toxin that's the reason he dies amen and there's many people will sit right in the church and die in their pews they'll die in sin because they don't want to take god's remedy they don't want to take god's cure for sin and god has got a cure for sin hallelujah matter of fact he says god has a double cure for sin jesus is the double cure because he is the healer of sin and sickness glory to god hallelujah jesus the double cure don't you want this double cure in your life i said don't you want the double cure oh he's a healer of broken hearts he's a healer of broken homes he's a healer of broken lives he's a healer of a broken world he's healer my friends of broken churches broken situations god is the mighty healer oh praise god hallelujah amen people don't want to take that cure and they'll die right there just imagine let me change the word you got the you got the doctor you wouldn't take his remedy god gave you a pastor and god inspires that pastor take this course of action you understand what you're doing when you say no i'm not doing that i'm doing what i feel like i'm doing right you see that spirit out there in the world that tell tell you that that you got your individual rights that's the odysseus spirit that's discerned right there people's rights is that right and then you you just take it casually because it's not a command right the preaching preacher's gonna come up and command just say oh you know this if you do this so you could do that or you could do that of course it is you're right and god doesn't force anything on anybody either of course it is your right which you got to make the choice but if you know what you're doing you will just go along with what god is saying you listen to what god is saying in his word and so god gives you a pastor but you wouldn't even listen to the pastor you you just think you're smarter uh he doesn't know he's talking about you know what you're talking about and what you know how to handle a situation well that's it oh my now remember this saints amen i do not take the place of any doctor for god has given us doctors and we are so thankful for them and i even try to work with the doctor if the doctor is giving you all the medicine now that's just as much as saying i work with the pastors all right god give us pastors god give us doctors right if the doctor giving you all the medicine that he knows how to give you and you can't get well or he's come to the point past his medical knowledge at that point then i feel is the time to go to god and ask god for his help you see how he again this is a different quote from the one he said that is the time now he said then right you come to this point where it's the end of medical knowledge then i feel we have the right to go to god and ask god to help us for he's the great physician and he has promised that he will do it amen and we must pray and believe for prayer changes things and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the lord will raise them up do you believe it i must refer to this because that may be happening and that can happen while i'm still in the middle of speaking for while peter yet spake the holy ghost fell on all them that heard the word of god and while i was yet speaking i repeated over and over again there sat a man with a cancer in his throat and all of a sudden he felt like and before you know it he crossed up the cancer on the floor what was it oh my that devil knew that was the word was on the charge amen the word was on the charge amen michael was on the scene he had to get out of there in the name of jesus christ hallelujah and if thou canst believe you can be delivered right where you are hallelujah the prayer of faith will save the sick who gonna raise them up the preacher no the lord will raise them up may god raise you up right where you are right now i said my god raise you up right where you are right now and set you free from your ailment for his glory and for his honor amen hallelujah oh my if some critical doctor now he's talking about a doctor that don't even believe god was to tell you that you are not healed and he don't believe in that you just go right on and do what god told you to do according to his word don't listen to none of that from him amen go to another doctor if you want to see another doctor go to another one that will serve god imagine brother branham tell you going from doctor to doctor before you come to wit's end then now come to god they can't do anything anymore god can do it amen hallelujah oh my think of it now remember i repeat i am not against doctors i am not against medical treatments i am not against hospitals or any of that anything that can help anybody relieve this poor suffering humanity may god bless their every effort that they put forth and i pray that god will send some kind of a serum somewhere to someone of those scientists that will go out there and kill cancer that is in the world i hope that he will sense something else that will kill tb something that can do anything that can be done i trust god will do it and i now pray that he will do it amen that's the prayer that god will send some kind of injection or medicine that will kill cancer that will kill tuberculosis kill whatever viruses or diseases come and i pray that god will give this to the medical treatment to the scientists to the doctor and let them use it for to relieve suffering humanity is that right another blessing said all healing is of god all praise god i believe that amen you must know if you misusing the medical uh the medical practice and i must know for myself you know i like to share this i'm going to soon be winding this up more i can speak on this but listen now remember the serum is there the doctor is there and he sits on the doctor's doorstep sit right in the church sit right on the doctor's doorstep because he says why why is he sitting there because he is too stubborn to go in and to take the medicine that that doctor has got for him and he'll die on the doctor's doorstep sitting there the doctor says i've got the remedy for your ailment he repeats he says but he is just too stubborn right to go in think of it that fellow could die he won't take the medicine and there's plenty of the medicine but he is too stubborn to take the medicine then when he does that you cannot lay it on the doctor you cannot lay it on the medicine it's the person oh my and so is it today men and women will sit in the church and hear the unadulterated gospel in the power of the holy ghost see the manifestations of the spirit of the resurrected christ amen working in their midst and oh my and they reject it not because there is no bomb in gilead not because there is no physician there it's because them people are too stubborn to take the medicine amen what they are trying to do is trying to find their least way of resistance and by doing that they are going the way of the rest of the world and they are perishing in the game saying of korra you see do you know what i mean do you know what korra done amen some leader that gets the people all mixed up and they perish in that game saying or lies of quora is that right that's happening today and it's even infecting the mind of so-called church people or people that's supposed to be believers or christians amen amen see that's right let the doctor go as far as he could because they are these doctors let me tell you they are god's agent for some many times people come around me and say well we shouldn't have to go to a doctor this is in the message called the great warrior david they come and say we don't we shouldn't have to go to a doctor listen to brother branham i disagree i disagree with you no sir they are all god's agents see just the same as you need your automobile that is a scientific discovery right see that's right you will also get a lot better working with your doctor but the doctor really you know as a believer isn't your healer see god is your healer the doctor he says he'll touch here okay the quote says it here god's your healer you your doctor is only an assistant to god amen that's right but when the doctor goes as far as he can he comes to his limit for you see he can only work and what he can see and what he can feel and all that he knows but then god controls the rest is that right the doctor can cut the doctor so the doctor can give you medicines but then he himself have to sit back and wait for what he may send nature he's going to wait for nature to heal you he says nature because he don't believe or may not know but you are a believer all you want to trust is that the doctor does the best he can and then god does the healing for god is the healer amen and when the doctor comes to the end of his knowledge there then the prophet said automatically he'll send you to a specialist because the specialist knows more than he does in a certain area he's about what happens when this you come to the end the specialist doesn't know anymore he says that's when you're go to god he is your creator hallelujah he takes over from that oh praise god hallelujah he takes over and he makes you whole only belief musicians only believe all things are possible only believe believe only believe all things are possible only be lee
