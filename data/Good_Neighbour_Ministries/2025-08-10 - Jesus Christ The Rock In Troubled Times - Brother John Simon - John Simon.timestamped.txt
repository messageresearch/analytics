[7:34] grace of God, your heart is right.
[7:36] &gt;&gt; He's done something. Praise the Lord.
[7:39] And you ought to not be able to hold
[7:41] yourself back this morning from the love
[7:43] of God. Amen. You know why? Cuz God

[9:13] him. But let it be between you and him
[9:15] and say, "Oh yes, Lord.
[9:17] He is tremendous." Why don't we sing it?
[9:19] Gee, can you put that up for us? I don't
[9:21] even have the words for it. All right.
[9:24] When I'm in need, I call on the Lord
[9:29] and he hears me. Yes, he helps me. He's

[19:12] &gt;&gt; Living God of heaven and earth, we
[19:14] humbly bow our hearts and our lives
[19:16] before your presence. Lord, this
[19:19] wonderful, wonderful Sunday morning,
[19:21] Lord. We gather, Lord, to honor your
[19:24] resurrection, to give you thanks and
[19:26] praise, Lord, for your mercy and grace,
[19:29] for the Lord shedding your blood for us,
[19:31] heavenly father, forgiving us, Lord, of
[19:33] our sins, transgressions, Lord,
[19:37] unbelief, heavenly father. We know,
[19:39] Lord, that you are a merciful God.
[19:41] You've seen how we've struggled through
[19:43] the week, heavenly father. Lord, ups and
[19:46] downs and trials, oh God. about our
[19:48] patience being tried, Lord. We've won.
[19:52] Sometimes we've lost, heavenly father.
[19:54] But we can count on you, Lord, that if
[19:56] we confess our sins, our shortcomings,
[19:58] Lord, that you'll forgive us, heavenly
[20:00] father. Lord, we just bring, Lord, our
[20:02] friends and our family, Lord, our own
[20:05] personal sicknesses and things that are
[20:07] burdens just upon our hearts, heavenly
[20:09] father. We just lay them down before
[20:11] you, heavenly father, believing, Lord,
[20:13] that you are able to, Lord, to solve any
[20:17] issue, to heal any problem, heavenly
[20:19] father. And we just want to say thank
[20:21] you, Lord. And as we've gathered here
[20:23] together, Lord, we want to thank you for
[20:25] a wonderful pastor, oh God. Lord, a man
[20:28] after your own calling, Lord, a man
[20:30] after your own heart who's taken time,
[20:33] Lord, to study your word, Lord, to bring
[20:35] forth something today for your people.
[20:38] And Lord, we all claim that there's
[20:40] something today that you have to speak
[20:42] to us, Lord. Some answer, something that
[20:44] we're seeking in our heart, heavenly
[20:46] father. And your word today has that
[20:48] answer. Oh God, we ask you, Lord,
[20:50] whether it's here, us, Lord, somebody at
[20:53] home, Lord, sitting on a couch or bed,
[20:56] unable, Lord, to get up, Lord, by the
[20:58] end of this service, heavenly father,
[21:00] may there be faith in our heart to know,
[21:02] Lord, that it's already done.
[21:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Heavenly Father, bless us now as
[21:06] we gather to worship and praise and
[21:09] sing. Lord, bless your servants. Oh God,
[21:11] thank you for brother Mike. Thank you
[21:13] for these musicians and singers. Oh God,

[21:17] Lord, they could be out there in the
[21:18] world and singing heavenly father, but
[21:20] they chose to dedicate it to you as Lord
[21:23] offering. Bless them, oh God. Give them
[21:25] skill and understanding and add unto
[21:27] those things, Lord. We ask in Jesus
[21:29] name. Amen.
[21:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[34:45] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[34:47] I'm happy to be here with you here today
[34:50] to give glory and praise and honor to
[34:53] God. God richly uh bless you. Um uh
[34:58] please be seated momentarily.
[35:00] [Music]
[35:03] Uh just to let you know that um
[35:08] I'm just here to bring a simple message
[35:11] that somehow bless your soul. Amen. Not
[35:16] to inform you but to transform you. Uh
[35:20] just to bring something that when we
[35:24] leave here we will be changed.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; That the word of God will change our
[35:29] lives and make us into what he wants us
[35:33] to be. In other words, what I'm doing
[35:36] here uh is applying the token. Praise
[35:40] the Lord. You see, I'm not presenting
[35:43] the token because by now you should know
[35:46] who and what that is. But I'm applying
[35:50] the token to your lives as a bomb in
[35:54] Gilead that God will bring about healing
[36:00] uh deliverance,
[36:02] encouragement
[36:04] and strength. Praise the Lord. uh for uh
[36:08] the topic today
[36:11] we'd like to speak on Jesus Christ our
[36:15] rock in troubled times
[36:20] we are certainly know what times we're
[36:23] living in but just before I commence uh
[36:27] let us just stand and have a brief
[36:30] prayer
[36:31] it's all right I'm just making you get
[36:33] some calisthenics so that You're always
[36:37] alert and awake, right? Praise the Lord.
[36:41] Hallelujah. Our gracious heavenly
[36:43] father, what a joy to know that we have
[36:47] this privilege of you allowing us to
[36:51] speak to your wife and to bring the your
[36:55] word to her. We pray Lord that as we
[37:00] come together with our frail and our
[37:02] failings that you will be our strength.
[37:05] You will be our guide. You will be our
[37:08] all in all.
[37:10] We pray you'll watch over us. May the
[37:13] Spirit search through the congregation.
[37:16] May he search every heart. May he apply
[37:19] the word where it's needed. Give
[37:22] strength to the weak knees. Lift up the
[37:24] fallen. Encourage those that are
[37:27] discouraged. The ones that may be
[37:30] swaying, uncertain. May the spirit of
[37:33] God give us certainty. Father, we give
[37:37] ourselves to you now for service, to
[37:40] receive, to hear, and to apply in Jesus'
[37:44] name. Amen. And amen. God bless you all.
[37:48] Our scriptures will be given to us now.
[37:51] Psalms 31:E3.
[37:59] For thou art my rock and my fortress.
[38:04] Therefore, for thy name's sake, lead me
[38:08] and guide me.
[38:11] 1 Corinthians
[38:13] 10,
[38:15] reading from verses 1 to 4.
[38:19] Moreover, brethren, I would not that you
[38:24] should be ignorant, how that all our
[38:28] fathers were under the cloud, and all
[38:32] passed through the sea, and were
[38:35] baptized unto Moses
[38:38] in the cloud and in the sea. And did all
[38:42] eat the same spiritual meat? and did all
[38:49] drink the same spiritual drink. For they
[38:53] drank of that spiritual rock that
[38:58] followed them, and that rock was Christ.
[39:04] Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. God
[39:07] bless you. Please be seated.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; There's an old hymn that some of you may
[39:15] know. that says, "The Lord's our rock.
[39:20] In him we hide, our shelter in the time
[39:26] of storm.
[39:28] A shade by day, defense by night, a
[39:33] shelter in the time of storm. No fears
[39:38] alarm,
[39:40] no fears of fright.
[39:43] He's our shelter in the time of storm.
[39:48] And the chorus of that song says, "Jesus
[39:51] is the rock in the weary land, a weary
[39:55] land. Jesus is the rock in the weary
[39:59] land, a shelter in a time of storm."
[40:05] Amen. Friends, in these troubled times
[40:10] of chaos,
[40:12] instability,
[40:14] and uncertainty,
[40:17] I want you to know that with everything
[40:21] around us shaking,
[40:23] everything around us falling apart,
[40:26] uh it seems like there is no solid
[40:29] ground anywhere that you can place your
[40:33] faith or your foot upon. on. But I'm
[40:36] here to tell you today that Jesus
[40:39] Christ, the word of God revealed to us,
[40:44] is our rock in the midst of these
[40:47] troubled times.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; None can dispute the fact that this
[40:53] world is weary and tired. The earth,
[40:57] brother Brandham says, is weary and
[40:58] tired. They have been taking out he says
[41:02] the framework
[41:05] uh or like he says like the skeleton or
[41:07] the bones of a man digging it away with
[41:10] all kinds of mining and everything else.
[41:13] Okay. But the world is weary and tired
[41:16] of what's been going on. Weary of wars,
[41:20] weary and tired of all the pollutants
[41:24] and pollution everywhere that's taking
[41:27] place. And we are certainly know that we
[41:31] are living in trouble sometimes. Can you
[41:34] say amen?
[41:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. These are times of stormy weather,
[41:39] brother. Amen. Everything is very stormy
[41:44] around us.
[41:46] The world and all the systems of the
[41:50] world are rocking and reeling. They are
[41:54] in total chaos.
[41:56] that do not know what they're doing.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And in the words of our prophet,
[42:04] this world is falling apart.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; But thank God.
[42:10] But Jesus lives deep down in our hearts.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; That is why we are here this morning.
[42:17] We're not gathered here for a treatise,
[42:19] a lecture or for some uh what should I
[42:24] say informational
[42:26] uh word. But we are here to have
[42:30] something that will make you act upon
[42:32] the word.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; You have heard, you have recognized the
[42:37] iron time is upon us that we must act
[42:40] upon the word.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; God is calling upon us for action.
[42:46] Hallelujah.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. Amen. Yes, sir.
[42:51] We see not only the world
[42:54] but the church, the worldwide church and
[42:58] all the church systems that they have
[43:00] made to create a better church than God
[43:04] himself.
[43:06] The church world is in birth pains.
[43:09] Hallelujah. And we know that we are the
[43:13] babe in their mind. simple people uh uh
[43:17] babes in the middle of it all. Well, we
[43:20] are they are in birth pains to give up
[43:23] for a rapture has to take place to take
[43:27] us out of this and bring us into the
[43:30] presence of God.
[43:32] Under the strains
[43:35] and the pressures of the present age,
[43:39] all the whole world and the individuals
[43:42] that live in the world are swiftly
[43:46] falling into deep pits of blackness and
[43:51] depression. How many knows that's true?
[43:54] Amen.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, they built a massive
[43:58] hospital up here on a mountain. Up there
[44:01] in a mountain in Hamilton, St. Joseph's
[44:04] before we had such an alarm, they
[44:07] already built it because they knew a
[44:10] wave of madness,
[44:13] a wave of insanity.
[44:16] And I'm going to say it the way Jesus
[44:18] used to say it because many times they
[44:21] try to make it in very nice cultured uh
[44:24] terms but Jesus call it a deaf devil or
[44:28] a blind spirit or a crippled spirit is
[44:31] on that person or he'll tell them that
[44:34] uh here was a legion insane and
[44:37] screaming and hollering
[44:40] right he didn't need a psychiatrist he
[44:42] needed a great physician.
[44:45] He needed a b from Gilead.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; He needed a touch from God. Hallelujah.
[44:51] And that's what most people need here
[44:53] today. But they won't admit it. They
[44:56] rather to go thinking they have to need
[44:58] some medicine. Amen. And they are okay.
[45:01] Doctors do their job and so on and so
[45:03] on. But in the depths of us, what we
[45:07] need is a power of God to strike our
[45:09] souls and bring us out of our chaos that
[45:13] we are in.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; Bring us out of the world's insanity and
[45:17] the madness that is all around us.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; People are trying to walk and be good
[45:23] people and they're falling into deep
[45:26] pits of despair.
[45:30] They're falling into holes of
[45:32] depression.
[45:34] blackness all around them. They wake up.
[45:38] Uh they can't hardly function.
[45:41] Uh it's nothing to do with whether the
[45:43] person is intelligent or if they are
[45:45] poor or they're rich. It hits everybody.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; Everybody that doesn't have the hold of
[45:52] God. And even those who have Jesus
[45:54] Christ have to watch themselves because
[45:57] the devil is coming after you.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; Praise God. He's coming after you. Amen.
[46:05] That devil is on the track as I've
[46:07] always sang and he's trying to turn us
[46:10] back, but I'm running up the shining
[46:12] way.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Yes, sir. Amen. Many others,
[46:19] they're making a slippery descent
[46:22] into the pits of hell,
[46:26] into darkness and madness.
[46:30] mental
[46:31] uh madness. Absolutely. Wasn't it our
[46:35] prophet who spoke the word and said it
[46:38] will come to pass the entire world will
[46:41] go insane
[46:43] &gt;&gt; except the members of the bride of
[46:45] Christ.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Those why because they already exchanged
[46:49] their mind for the mind of Christ.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They're not going by their
[46:54] own mind. Oh, my mind told me this, my
[46:56] mind told me that, my mind told me the
[46:59] other. No, they're not even trusting
[47:01] their own mind. They're resting on the
[47:03] word of God. They're resting on the mind
[47:06] of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Amen. Yes,
[47:10] sir. Praise God. How many people
[47:15] are being haunted
[47:17] and haunted
[47:19] by demons of their past?
[47:24] demons of their past
[47:27] rising up. And let me tell you, I'm not
[47:31] ruling out and saying, "Oh, it's only
[47:33] the sinners out there." I'm talking
[47:35] about even believers. The devil is going
[47:38] to try to haunt you. The hounds of hell
[47:41] are going to come after you and they're
[47:44] going to be howling in your heart, in
[47:46] your mind, bringing up all kinds of
[47:49] stuff you done before you were born
[47:51] again. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. And those
[47:55] countless hordes of demons, as brother
[47:58] Brham says, those 240
[48:02] uh is it thousand or million horsemen?
[48:05] &gt;&gt; Millions of horsemen, devils loosening
[48:09] this world. And why did they come down?
[48:12] He says what? War to the earth. Because
[48:15] your adversary has come, the devil has
[48:18] come down and he know that his time is
[48:21] short.
[48:22] He's going to try to do and he's trying
[48:24] to do as much damage as he can do before
[48:27] he is taken out of here.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Oh my. So, we've got to be on our guard
[48:33] with the word of God solid within our
[48:36] hearts.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. And sometimes
[48:41] these devils that haunt us are not
[48:45] devils maybe out of our personal
[48:47] experiences.
[48:49] Maybe not devils out of our personal
[48:52] past.
[48:54] Do you know you can be followed by
[48:58] family spirits,
[49:01] &gt;&gt; demons from your family past
[49:05] where in the word of God he says
[49:07] sometimes God let a curse upon a family
[49:10] because one family member did a certain
[49:14] certain thing. He says, "And that will
[49:16] follow them down to the third and fourth
[49:20] generation."
[49:22] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham one time went to pray for
[49:26] one woman and uh uh fine. He prayed for
[49:31] her. He was about to lay his hands on a
[49:34] another woman's child and pray for it.
[49:38] The Holy Spirit said, "No, take your
[49:40] hands off. There's a curse on that
[49:42] family. It hasn't worked its way out of
[49:45] that family as yet. If you pray that
[49:48] off, that thing will come on you.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; So you keep away from he just had to
[49:52] take his hands off completely. Amen.
[49:55] Praise God. Let me tell you something,
[49:58] friends. These are not story books. This
[50:01] is not a story book we're reading here
[50:03] or a picture book of some child story
[50:06] written thousands of years ago. This is
[50:09] real, friends. Devils are real. They're
[50:12] in this world
[50:14] &gt;&gt; and I'm telling you because I'm I face
[50:16] them. I've met them. I talk to them.
[50:19] They talk to me.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Cast them out in Jesus
[50:23] Christ's name for his glory and honor
[50:26] and they are real today. He tries to
[50:28] push himself in the background as if he
[50:30] doesn't exist. Witches don't exist
[50:32] anymore. Witchcraft, those are
[50:34] uncultured. People talk about those
[50:36] things. Rich doctors, those are
[50:38] primitive stuff. They they don't happen
[50:39] today. Let me tell you, they're right in
[50:41] your midst.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; They're right in the world here today.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Change their name, call it psychic,
[50:49] change their name, and and call it all
[50:51] kinds of stuff. Some have even come
[50:53] right in the pulpit.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; And call themselves preachers of the
[50:58] gospel of Jesus Christ. Amen. Yes, sir.
[51:01] And lying to the people of God. Yes.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; And the people of God have not put
[51:06] themselves in a place where they have
[51:08] enough discernment by Hebrews 4:12, the
[51:12] word in you should be quick and sharper
[51:14] than a two-edged sword. Hallelujah. To
[51:17] recognize your day and the day in which
[51:20] you are living. Amen. Praise God. We had
[51:23] one man came here to preach. Amen.
[51:27] Claiming he believed the message. Oh my.
[51:30] in the middle of preaching. I don't mean
[51:32] here in this church at this present
[51:34] time, but while the church was in
[51:36] another location and he came to preach
[51:39] in the middle of preaching, I'm sitting
[51:41] in the back all of a sudden it struck
[51:42] me. Amen. So, I could have stopped him
[51:46] right then, but I wait till he finished.
[51:47] We took him in the office. He said, "Uh
[51:50] uh, brother, you claim that you believe
[51:52] the message. You're a preacher and all
[51:54] this, but I perceive you're a
[51:57] homosexual.
[52:00] He says, "How dare you to tell me
[52:03] something like that? Do you know my life
[52:06] and who I am and don't fall into
[52:09] judgment?" Uh, you know, all this stuff
[52:11] about judging people and all. He started
[52:14] talking like that. I said, "Well,
[52:16] brother, you don't have to become
[52:17] emotional of it. Just just tell these uh
[52:21] deacons here that I'm I'm lying or I
[52:24] told a lie you or what I said was
[52:27] wrong." He says, "I don't have to do
[52:29] that." I said, "You know why you don't
[52:31] have to do that?
[52:33] Because you're not just talking to me.
[52:35] The one that revealed it to me. You're
[52:38] telling him he's a liar.
[52:40] And you know, you can't do that. If you
[52:42] do that, you wouldn't even walk out of
[52:44] here." So he says, "Oh, he he says, I
[52:47] preach in such big church somewhere out
[52:50] there with with so many thousand
[52:52] members." I said, "But you're not there.
[52:54] You're here."
[52:55] I'm talking to you now, right? So, you
[52:58] answer me of what I'm saying. He says,
[53:00] "I don't have to answer you." I said,
[53:02] "Then you can't stay around here. You
[53:04] have to leave right now." So, we we just
[53:07] got him a hotel, let him go, took care
[53:10] of it, and the brothers took him there.
[53:13] But the they did not stand around and
[53:15] wait to see him sign in. So, then but
[53:18] the next day I I sent them back to find
[53:20] out how is he doing. when they go back
[53:23] and they ask for him, the hotel said
[53:24] there's no such a person in here,
[53:27] said, "But he was at the desk." They
[53:29] said, "But even if he was at the desk,
[53:31] he did not sign in. That person isn't
[53:33] here. He disappeared." Well,
[53:37] maybe a month later,
[53:40] here comes the Hamilton
[53:44] U police and they came to me and said,
[53:48] "Uh, Mr. Simon, uh, did you have such
[53:51] and such a person, uh, at your church? I
[53:53] said, yes. They said, uh, uh, you do you
[53:57] know that, um, we have him, uh, arrested
[54:02] in Northern Ontario. He's now in jail
[54:05] because he committed acts, right, as a
[54:10] homosexual,
[54:11] and we have him in jail now. I said, "Oh
[54:15] my goodness, he's in jail." and and I
[54:19] said, "Yes, and he's going to stay
[54:21] there, right? Uh um and pay for his
[54:24] crimes."
[54:26] Okay. The word of God was fulfilled.
[54:30] About a two years later, I got a call.
[54:33] Hi, Mr. Simon. How are you? I said, I'm
[54:36] fine. Who's speaking? So, this is uh I'm
[54:40] about to speak his name. Inspector So
[54:42] and So, he says, "You know, we've caught
[54:45] that guy again.
[54:48] And this time we're putting him away for
[54:51] good.
[54:54] I want you to understand this was a man
[54:57] claimed to be following this message
[55:01] driving with the believers in the car
[55:03] and he will say when we go around the
[55:06] corner there's going to be a man uh
[55:09] doing this this this that and and he
[55:13] will tell them things and when they go
[55:14] around the corner there it is
[55:18] there it is. So you see, don't put your
[55:21] faith in miracles.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; No, don't rest your faith on gifts
[55:26] though are real gifts. Praise God. I
[55:29] know because some are in me. I can't
[55:32] help that. And I'm not saying it
[55:33] boastfully or anything like that. I I
[55:35] couldn't help that since I was a little
[55:37] child. I would know things and I didn't
[55:39] know how I knew. But but after the
[55:41] message came, then I began to understand
[55:44] that that that something wasn't me that
[55:46] I didn't put there. I don't have nothing
[55:48] to do with it. And so there it is,
[55:50] brother, sister. Now we're talking the
[55:52] message now. Is that right?
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. We're talking the
[55:56] message now because the message is not
[55:58] just the spoken word books. The message
[56:00] is not just the writings in the Bible.
[56:02] The message is Christ the Lost,
[56:06] &gt;&gt; the the invisible person of Christ on
[56:08] the scene.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; That's the message. That's really He is
[56:12] the message. Is that right? Oh, praise
[56:15] God. Do you believe the word of God?
[56:17] Amen.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; You believe he's the same yesterday,
[56:20] today, and forever.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; You believe he doesn't change.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. And God, he in
[56:28] our midst.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. To meet our every need.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If we trust him, he
[56:35] will never fail. The God we serve cannot
[56:39] fail. He cannot lie. He cannot change.
[56:42] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[56:45] forever. Thank you, Jesus.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. And so those
[56:51] devils and while I'm preaching, search
[56:54] yourself. I don't know. I'm This is just
[56:58] the word God gave me.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Right. Third, fourth generation.
[57:03] And those devils want to follow you. And
[57:06] you want to know why I'm acting like
[57:08] this, why I'm doing this, why I'm this
[57:11] way. They're there to try to influence
[57:14] you in every way. Amen. See, praise God.
[57:18] Following your following you right on
[57:20] down to this particular time. You say,
[57:24] "Well, brother Simon, why is all this
[57:27] happening?"
[57:29] It's happening because the whole world
[57:32] has moved away from its foundation.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; What's the foundation? Hebrews tells us,
[57:40] we understand clearly
[57:42] &gt;&gt; that the world was framed by the word of
[57:46] God.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; The foundation of the entire world is
[57:50] the word of God.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And without the word, the world
[57:56] will fall apart.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Take out the word out of the world and
[58:00] the world falls apart.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; All right? So, it's moved from its
[58:04] foundation.
[58:06] Not only the world but the church world
[58:09] has moved away from its foundation.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. And they they
[58:15] create all kind of mad man-made systems,
[58:20] right? uh and created all kind of
[58:23] religious chaos,
[58:26] confusion,
[58:29] and like some of the Israelites, they're
[58:32] going back to Babylon,
[58:35] back to Babel, trying to build up big
[58:38] cathedrals and big mega churches.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. I realize I'm not speaking just to
[58:44] you here,
[58:46] &gt;&gt; but this is going worldwide. Amen.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; It's reaching out across Africa.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; There are brethren listening over there
[58:52] in Africa.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Uh sometimes when I go home then I'll
[58:56] get the WhatsApp or text saying they
[58:59] watched or they listen to the service
[59:02] other people that not in this building
[59:05] right in this country or even in America
[59:08] that will respond and let me know they
[59:11] heard the word.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. So don't just look at yourself and
[59:16] think it's you alone. No, there are
[59:18] thousands around hearing the word of
[59:20] God.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. Praise God. They moved
[59:26] away from their original foundation
[59:30] which was the unchangeable, unshakable
[59:34] word of God. For Jesus said, "The true
[59:38] foundation, upon this rock, I'll build
[59:42] my church, and the gates of hell will
[59:45] not prevail against it."
[59:47] &gt;&gt; And that wasn't on Peter. And that
[59:50] wasn't on some rock, you know, on the
[59:53] shores of uh uh uh Galilee. Praise God.
[59:57] Amen. I know because uh there's a
[59:59] Catholic church there, and they have a
[1:00:01] big rock with a brass plaque on it. This
[1:00:04] is where Jesus was standing when he said
[1:00:06] so so so upon this rock. Amen. Not upon
[1:00:10] the pope. Not upon anything like that.
[1:00:13] Amen. They all have their place. Amen. I
[1:00:17] even the pope I respect him in this
[1:00:19] position. Amen. And the power that he
[1:00:22] exercises. He is even a brother in
[1:00:25] Christ because he names the name of
[1:00:27] Christ. And if they're not uh against
[1:00:30] us, they're for us. Amen. Praise God.
[1:00:33] Just leave them alone. Let them do what
[1:00:35] they have to do and you do what they
[1:00:37] have to do.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Focus on what you have to do. Amen.
[1:00:41] Praise God. Hallelujah. Praise God. And
[1:00:44] the gates of hell will not prevail
[1:00:47] against it.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; You hear that?
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; The denominational gates of hell, right?
[1:00:56] Uh let me not go off there because
[1:00:58] that's the whoredom of Revelation 19.
[1:01:02] Her gates are the gates to hell and so
[1:01:05] on and so and he said they will not
[1:01:09] prevail against it
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; which means they're going to fight. They
[1:01:14] are going to fight and they are fighting
[1:01:17] but they will not prevail
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; because they they they think you born to
[1:01:24] lose. Well, you're not born to lose.
[1:01:26] You're bound to win.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're bound to win because God
[1:01:31] already wrote it that you are going to
[1:01:33] win. You are going in the bride. Amen.
[1:01:36] Praise the Lord. You are part of it.
[1:01:38] Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. So,
[1:01:42] individuals
[1:01:44] have done the same thing and moved away
[1:01:47] from the word of God.
[1:01:50] Some move to monasticism.
[1:01:54] Some move off into masonic lodges. Some
[1:01:58] move into silk secret societies.
[1:02:01] Some move into things that will give
[1:02:04] them influence and power and riches like
[1:02:07] such and they move off from their
[1:02:10] foundations of the simple word of God.
[1:02:15] Amen.
[1:02:16] Let's have the scripture of Matthew 7:24
[1:02:20] and let's read it uh together.
[1:02:27] Therefore,
[1:02:28] whosoever heareth these sayings of mine
[1:02:32] and doeth them, I will liken unto a wise
[1:02:37] man who built his house upon a rock. Say
[1:02:43] rock.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Rock.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Say rock.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; Rock. He built his house on a rock and
[1:02:50] the rains descended and the floods came
[1:02:54] and the winds blew and beat upon that
[1:02:57] house and it fell not for it was founded
[1:03:00] upon a rock. He's speaking about the
[1:03:02] bright church here of course that all
[1:03:05] that's going to happen. Persecutions,
[1:03:06] winds, storms going to come but it's not
[1:03:09] go it's going to beat on it but it'll
[1:03:11] try to prevail but it can't. Amen.
[1:03:13] Because what? It was founded upon the
[1:03:16] rock.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Christ is our rock in these
[1:03:21] troubled times.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; And everyone that heareth, Amen. Not
[1:03:27] with your ears. Amen. Everyone that
[1:03:31] heareth understands hears with your
[1:03:34] heart. Speaks to your heart. Amen.
[1:03:38] Praise God. these saints of mine and
[1:03:41] doeth them not shall be lightened unto a
[1:03:45] foolish man who built his house upon the
[1:03:48] sand. And the rains descended and the
[1:03:51] floods came and the winds blew and beat
[1:03:55] upon that house and it fell and great
[1:03:59] was the fall of it. Of course, there's
[1:04:01] prophecy in there and everything else
[1:04:03] telling you about Babylon's going to
[1:04:05] fall and so on so on. Praise the Lord.
[1:04:08] Now, uh, in the Old Testament, David
[1:04:11] said, "The Lord is my rock
[1:04:16] and my fortress."
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. I come forth up in the Lord. Amen.
[1:04:22] Uh, they said, uh, Rock of Ages, the
[1:04:26] person that wrote it, he was out in the
[1:04:29] rain. He was walking. Rain came and he
[1:04:33] was looking for somewhere to shelter.
[1:04:35] And he noticed birds flying around.
[1:04:38] Noticed a dove just fly and go right
[1:04:41] into a cliff in the rock and and sat
[1:04:45] there while the storm and the rain was
[1:04:47] just going on. And he wrote that
[1:04:49] wonderful hymn, Rock of Ages cliff for
[1:04:53] me to hide in. In other words, praise
[1:04:55] the Lord. And we're so thankful that
[1:04:58] Jesus Christ is our rock.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Paul said the rock that went with them
[1:05:07] in our opening scripture was Christ.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Now this was no ordinary rock. It was a
[1:05:14] supernatural rock because the rock that
[1:05:17] followed them, that rock was Christ.
[1:05:21] This was a rock that was moving.
[1:05:23] Wherever they went, it went with them.
[1:05:25] And you can be assured everywhere you
[1:05:28] go, the Lord is with you.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Do you know that? How many knows that?
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; You are never alone.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; The Lord is always with you.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; No matter whether you feel his presence,
[1:05:40] you don't sense his presence. You don't
[1:05:43] think so. It has nothing to do with your
[1:05:45] thoughts. The Lord is always there with
[1:05:48] his people.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; God in the shadows watching over his
[1:05:53] own. Amen.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Yes. With his watchful eye, loving care,
[1:05:59] he's watching out for his children.
[1:06:04] Now, when Jesus spoke about building on
[1:06:06] a rock, give let let me continue to
[1:06:09] speak and let me finish what I have to
[1:06:11] say. Okay?
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; He was making sure that we understand
[1:06:16] that he wants us to build on a solid,
[1:06:21] stable, and sure foundation. Amen.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; That's what he was talking about. You
[1:06:26] build. Now that principle applies to the
[1:06:29] church as you could see there. Uh you
[1:06:31] know what a prophet has that drawing. Of
[1:06:34] course we know that the foundation is
[1:06:36] Jesus Christ. Uh right there it's
[1:06:39] founded on him. The word of God. But he
[1:06:42] want to be sure that we understand that
[1:06:45] principle. We always build on a solid
[1:06:48] foundation. Amen. Praise God. If you're
[1:06:51] building any building, you need a solid
[1:06:54] foundation.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Somebody tell me if I'm telling you the
[1:06:58] truth.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; You don't just go take a building and
[1:07:02] just build. No, they drill down until
[1:07:07] they find bedrock.
[1:07:10] They got to find bedrock. You think they
[1:07:12] can go up and up 73 stories and more up
[1:07:16] up like that and didn't go down first?
[1:07:20] My friends, the Bible just always tell
[1:07:22] you before you can go up, humble
[1:07:24] yourself.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; You you the the more you go down is the
[1:07:28] more you go up.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; You see, you humble yourself. Praise
[1:07:31] God. Don't even think of yourself as
[1:07:32] anybody or anything. Amen. Just go down
[1:07:36] and then you'll go up. So, they got to
[1:07:38] drill down until they hit bedrock. Then
[1:07:42] they say, "Ah, now we can start." Praise
[1:07:45] God. You think they're going to stop
[1:07:47] halfway and build on something else? No
[1:07:49] sir. Amen. You got to have a solid rock
[1:07:52] foundation.
[1:07:54] If you're building roads, you need to
[1:07:56] have proper solid rock foundations. If
[1:07:59] that area don't have rocks, they got
[1:08:02] they're going to bring the rocks. They
[1:08:05] got to truck the rocks in and put the
[1:08:07] rocks there because it needs a proper
[1:08:10] rock foundation. If it doesn't have it,
[1:08:13] the road breaks up in a short while,
[1:08:15] right? But you got to have solid rock
[1:08:18] foundation. If you're going to build a
[1:08:19] bridge over the ocean, and I traveled on
[1:08:23] one from uh Portugal right across that
[1:08:28] narrow straight in the Mediterranean
[1:08:30] there, I think it was 18 miles across
[1:08:33] there and it was right across the that
[1:08:36] Mediterranean Sea where it meets with
[1:08:39] the Atlantic there. Praise God. And a
[1:08:43] marvel of engineering. Just think of it
[1:08:46] there. Build it. But you know what?
[1:08:48] Before they can even start to build,
[1:08:51] they had to have people going down there
[1:08:54] diving and drilling and digging until
[1:08:57] they can hit bedrock.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. When they hit bedrock, then
[1:09:04] they'll start putting the pylons or
[1:09:07] pillars. They start to put them in
[1:09:10] before they can go over. Praise God. And
[1:09:13] the same thing goes for everything else.
[1:09:17] If you are going to build a church,
[1:09:21] you have to build it on the rock
[1:09:23] foundation.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; You cannot build it on yourself.
[1:09:27] It'll fall apart. Build it on your fame.
[1:09:31] You build up a great name. You spread it
[1:09:34] around the world and people know you.
[1:09:36] They turn up by thousands to hear you
[1:09:38] speak. You build it on that. It only
[1:09:42] will last for a certain amount of time.
[1:09:45] It will not last in the presence of God.
[1:09:48] It will not last in eternity. We must
[1:09:51] build on Christ, the solid rock, the
[1:09:54] word of God. Hallelujah. Build it upon
[1:09:57] ourselves, building on a denominational
[1:10:00] system, trying to build a church and
[1:10:02] various means. Right? Like that. If
[1:10:04] you're going to start a family or you
[1:10:07] are in the middle right now of starting
[1:10:09] a family, you need the solid foundation
[1:10:12] or the word of God to build it on. If
[1:10:15] that family is not built on that and
[1:10:17] later on the pressures of life begin to
[1:10:20] come,
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; the family is going to be stressed out,
[1:10:24] strained out, and it may even fall
[1:10:26] apart.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you. And what I'm saying,
[1:10:29] this is not to sinners out there in the
[1:10:31] world, only even to Christians.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. precious scum even on the marriage
[1:10:36] of Christians and the tension comes.
[1:10:40] Amen. Praise God. So the family needs to
[1:10:43] be built on the word
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; so that you always go back to the word
[1:10:48] of God. You go back to the revealed word
[1:10:51] of God. Praise the name of the Lord God.
[1:10:54] You want to build a proper real
[1:10:56] friendship. What's it built on? You
[1:10:59] think it just built on like it built on
[1:11:02] love? Oh. Uh. Oh. H. I like her because
[1:11:06] she nice blonde hair. Or I like this one
[1:11:09] because of dark nice flowing hair. My
[1:11:13] go. That's That's what it's founded on.
[1:11:16] Oh my goodness. It's founded on because
[1:11:18] physically he looks so handsome. And my
[1:11:22] goodness, that little curl he has on his
[1:11:24] forehead. Oh, that makes my heart leap.
[1:11:29] Yeah. You build it on that. That can be
[1:11:31] worms tomorrow.
[1:11:34] Yeah, you build it on that. See, we
[1:11:36] build on these fickle, foolish nonsense
[1:11:39] of the world that's out there. Let us
[1:11:42] build our lives upon Christ, the rock
[1:11:45] foundation, the word of the living God.
[1:11:48] Hallelujah.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. Building church, family,
[1:11:53] friendship, or even with your personal
[1:11:56] life. You're going to build a life.
[1:11:59] You want to see that you have a solid
[1:12:03] path of life from beginning to end under
[1:12:08] the leadership of Jesus Christ. Then my
[1:12:11] friends, you got to let the Lord Jesus
[1:12:14] Christ be your rock foundation. And
[1:12:17] while I'm speaking to you, may the
[1:12:19] presence of Almighty God bear witness to
[1:12:21] what I'm saying here.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:12:25] You see, a rock is godmade,
[1:12:29] but a brick is man-made.
[1:12:34] I'm afraid we got a lot of bricks
[1:12:36] instead of rocks.
[1:12:39] You see
[1:12:41] a brick you can make with sand.
[1:12:46] You can make it with mud.
[1:12:49] You can make it with clay.
[1:12:53] You can make it with mud. A mixture of
[1:12:56] mud mixed with grass mixed with hay. You
[1:13:00] can make a mixture of different things.
[1:13:02] And one might be a harder kind of a
[1:13:05] brick that will last for a longer time,
[1:13:07] but it's still a mixture that you made
[1:13:10] up. A man-made mixture that you made up
[1:13:13] like that, you see? Oh, my friends. See?
[1:13:17] My goodness. You can even make better
[1:13:20] than that. You can make it a sundried
[1:13:22] brick or a fired brick that you put in
[1:13:25] an oven to make it hard hardened like
[1:13:29] that.
[1:13:30] Oh, I can even make it better than that.
[1:13:32] Mix some put some wire mesh in it. You
[1:13:35] can even reinforce it with steel bars.
[1:13:38] And my god, when that brick comes out,
[1:13:41] it's a it's a real hard solid brick and
[1:13:44] it comes out there. But let me tell you,
[1:13:47] no matter what the composition of that
[1:13:49] brick is,
[1:13:51] no matter how sophisticated the mixture
[1:13:55] of that brick is, you can use all the
[1:13:58] chemicals you want to even get a brick
[1:14:00] in the middle of winter. And no matter
[1:14:02] how sophisticated that brick is, it is
[1:14:06] still nothing but a brick.
[1:14:08] That wouldn't change that brick into a
[1:14:10] rock. The the the the brick remains a
[1:14:13] brick. Amen. So in the same way you take
[1:14:18] a man or a woman, you can pass them
[1:14:21] through the best universities,
[1:14:24] pass them through the best theological
[1:14:26] seminaries,
[1:14:28] pass them through the most rigorous
[1:14:30] training, the most uh secure training
[1:14:34] and train them to perfection.
[1:14:37] And when they come out of there, all
[1:14:40] they are is going to be nothing but a
[1:14:43] brick.
[1:14:45] You can then
[1:14:47] give them like they do for some bricks,
[1:14:51] give them, authorize them
[1:14:55] and certify
[1:14:57] this is a brick that was made in Italy.
[1:15:03] This is not no ordinary brick from
[1:15:07] China.
[1:15:13] This is a brick that will last. It will
[1:15:17] hold and it will last with whatever you
[1:15:20] have to do with it. So, we authorize it
[1:15:25] and we put a stamp on it. And there the
[1:15:28] indentation in the brick saying where it
[1:15:31] come from and how it's going to last.
[1:15:34] Uh, like that. You can certify some of
[1:15:37] these people and even give them
[1:15:39] authorized by Northwestern Bible. Uh you
[1:15:43] authorized by so and so. My when people
[1:15:46] hear that, oh, they jump back say, "Oh
[1:15:48] my goodness, that man is really
[1:15:51] something else. He's got to authorize
[1:15:53] with a BA,
[1:15:56] BD, and he's got a a MA and he's got a
[1:16:01] doctor of philosophy and a professor of
[1:16:05] this and that and
[1:16:08] you know, doctors of this and doctors of
[1:16:10] that and and call themselves professor
[1:16:12] this and and they're right in a way
[1:16:14] because they're professing to know and
[1:16:15] they don't know anything, right?
[1:16:19] It's still a man-made brick.
[1:16:22] I'm sorry, but praise the Lord. It's
[1:16:25] still a man-made brick.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Right. That wasn't shaped by God.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; That wasn't called by God. Amen. Praise
[1:16:33] God. But thank God,
[1:16:36] Jesus is still the rock in this weary
[1:16:39] land.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; He is still our shelter in the time of
[1:16:43] storm.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:45] All the rest, whether they be
[1:16:48] patriarchs, whether they be prophets,
[1:16:51] whether they be apostles, or even
[1:16:54] individual believers of this unwritten
[1:16:58] word of the hour, uh you are just like
[1:17:01] Peter. We are we are little rocks,
[1:17:04] right? He says, "Your name is going to
[1:17:07] be uh Peter. You're going to be Cphus,
[1:17:10] little stone, little rock." Amen. In
[1:17:13] some culture we call it rock stone but
[1:17:17] right a rock but the difference is a
[1:17:21] rock is is when you pick it up rough but
[1:17:24] the stone is is the same rock polished
[1:17:28] over time.
[1:17:30] That is why we are just little stones
[1:17:33] because the Holy Spirit polishing us,
[1:17:36] right? Uh, I don't know about you, but
[1:17:38] he ain't finished with me yet.
[1:17:41] But he's still polishing. And to polish
[1:17:43] it, Samson says, just like how God
[1:17:46] polishes, he says, two or three stones
[1:17:48] in a brook and the water passing and
[1:17:50] they're tumbling up together. He says
[1:17:52] the face of friend sharpens the face of
[1:17:54] the other friend. It smooths out a lot
[1:17:56] of things in the life of the other
[1:17:58] person. Amen. Is that right? And it
[1:18:00] smooths us out together. That's why we
[1:18:03] are walking together as a people of God.
[1:18:05] and to the church of the living God.
[1:18:07] Amen. Somebody get mad if somebody tells
[1:18:10] them about a little flaw, a little fault
[1:18:12] or something. And there's other people
[1:18:14] which I can't stand people like that.
[1:18:16] They see you doing something wrong
[1:18:19] and they love you so much that they
[1:18:21] wouldn't tell you.
[1:18:24] It's just how you tell the person. But
[1:18:27] you you can't have your friend or your
[1:18:30] sister or your brother walking into fire
[1:18:32] and say, "Oh boy, I don't want to tell
[1:18:35] them. They'll get mad." No, you have got
[1:18:38] to tell them.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; You got If you The Bible tells you how
[1:18:42] to do it. He says, "Get them by
[1:18:43] themselves. Take your brother aside.
[1:18:46] Talk with them." I said, "You noticed
[1:18:48] this. I noticed you're doing that. I
[1:18:50] noticed this happening. And if you
[1:18:51] notice anything about me, tell me, too."
[1:18:53] You know, I don't mind. But that you
[1:18:55] have to do it.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; But don't become people that say, "Oh,
[1:18:59] I'm your friend." And and while you
[1:19:01] saying you're a friend, you see the
[1:19:02] person doing something wrong. You hold
[1:19:04] it in your chest and you don't say
[1:19:05] nothing and let them walk into trouble,
[1:19:08] walk into problems. Am I saying the
[1:19:10] truth now?
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; And notice you're getting a little
[1:19:13] quiet. That's why I ask you.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. In the old
[1:19:20] days, I'm in the middle of preaching and
[1:19:21] the demons screaming and the door fling
[1:19:23] open and they're running out and all
[1:19:25] that stuff. Amen. You may you might be
[1:19:28] very uh you cultured to me here and just
[1:19:31] remain in your seat and just clear your
[1:19:33] throat
[1:19:35] and not say anything, but in your heart
[1:19:37] you have another thought, right? What's
[1:19:40] he talking about? Amen. Praise God.
[1:19:43] Shall we continue talking about rock?
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; This sermon is about rocks and bricks.
[1:19:49] It's nothing mysterious.
[1:19:54] You may you go out right now and a dog
[1:19:56] attacks you and the first thing you
[1:19:57] going to do is reach for a rock or a
[1:20:00] brick or something like that. Amen.
[1:20:03] Praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:20:05] Amen. Yes, sir. So, we are not uh
[1:20:09] authorized by the denominations.
[1:20:13] We have been certified by the
[1:20:15] denominations.
[1:20:18] But I can tell you, I am a certified
[1:20:20] seed of God.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; And I'm authorized by the Holy Spirit to
[1:20:26] preach this word of God
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; to you who will listen and hear it and
[1:20:33] receive it within your heart.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus, the prophets, the apostles,
[1:20:40] right on down to the bride of the seven
[1:20:42] church ages, they are not bricks. They
[1:20:46] are founded on the rock and they
[1:20:48] themselves are part of that rock. They
[1:20:50] are chips off. They are pieces from the
[1:20:53] masterpiece. They are one and the same
[1:20:56] because they are made of the same
[1:20:58] material.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:21:04] Yes, sir. Praise the name of the Lord
[1:21:06] God. Amen. Revelations 2:17.
[1:21:12] He that hath an ear to hear, let him
[1:21:16] hear. Praise God. To him that
[1:21:20] overcomemeth will I give to eat of the
[1:21:23] hidden manner, and will give him a white
[1:21:28] stone,
[1:21:29] and the stone in the stone a new name
[1:21:33] written, which no man knoweth, saving he
[1:21:38] that receiveth it. Oh, praise God.
[1:21:42] Hallelujah. Oh, you come with the seed
[1:21:45] already in you. Praise the name of the
[1:21:48] Lord. You come with that stone of God
[1:21:53] inside of you. And you're walking
[1:21:56] through this world in white year after
[1:21:59] year. Uh let me go back to something.
[1:22:02] When Paul says, "Work out your salvation
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; with fear and trembling." In the old
[1:22:08] days in the preaching of the seven
[1:22:09] thunder message they were saying you got
[1:22:12] to perfect yourself
[1:22:14] and uh let the holy spirit perfect those
[1:22:18] virtues in you and later as the holy
[1:22:21] spirit real got us to realize is that
[1:22:25] when the seed of god comes in you that's
[1:22:28] a part of him it's already perfect
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; but you the man part of it the flesh
[1:22:34] part of it don't know its name. It don't
[1:22:39] know its purpose.
[1:22:41] It hasn't become aware or conscious out
[1:22:43] of this amnesia to recognize who it is.
[1:22:47] So little by little as he reveals and
[1:22:50] makes known to you who you are, what you
[1:22:53] are, what you're supposed to do, you
[1:22:56] know it inside. Nobody outside you don't
[1:22:58] know it. You got to work it out.
[1:23:03] Your salvation got to work out until it
[1:23:05] starts showing in your whole life.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Your whole being begins to reflect
[1:23:11] Christ.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Manifest Christ, the unwritten word,
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; the person of Christ.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; We're not not talking about the rha of
[1:23:21] the word, which is the writing part.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; But the spirit rides upon the word. And
[1:23:27] the spirit of God you can't see. But
[1:23:30] when the word of God is preached under
[1:23:32] inspiration, then the unseen presence of
[1:23:35] the almighty God is here with the word.
[1:23:38] Praise God. And if you're sensitive
[1:23:40] enough, you'll pick it up. If not, it'll
[1:23:41] just pass by you. That's okay. But he,
[1:23:44] the living one, is still with us.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; And he's with the word of God.
[1:23:48] Hallelujah.
[1:23:50] Praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:23:53] Praise God. Now, I won't talk about the
[1:23:55] diamond being a rock because a lot of
[1:23:57] women have a diamond, a rock on their
[1:24:00] hands. Amen. But it's just a rock. And I
[1:24:04] won't talk about the rock beneath a
[1:24:06] rock. These are things left for you
[1:24:09] brothers that can go back in the word
[1:24:11] and pick up stuff in there. Praise the
[1:24:13] name of the Lord. But I just want to
[1:24:14] thank our heavenly father that he sent
[1:24:17] to us, Jesus Christ, to be our smitten
[1:24:20] rock.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Right? that out of him will gush forth
[1:24:24] lifegiving
[1:24:26] and refreshing waters. Amen. Praise God.
[1:24:30] And we know that he came and uh uh was
[1:24:33] smitten on Calvary and and and his
[1:24:36] life's blood poured out of him. Praise
[1:24:39] God. To save this sin earth. Amen.
[1:24:43] Praise the Lord. It was poured out for
[1:24:44] everybody. But he knew that only a
[1:24:47] certain uh portion of it will receive
[1:24:51] him. And we know God so loved the world
[1:24:54] that he gave his only begotten son that
[1:24:56] whosoever believeth in him. But he
[1:24:59] already knew there's only a certain
[1:25:01] amount of people that has that capacity
[1:25:03] to believe in him.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. He came for his lost
[1:25:08] sheep. He came for his own. He came for
[1:25:12] those that are of his little little
[1:25:14] flock.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And thank God you are one of
[1:25:18] them. I believe so. One in a million.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Brother Brandham said the
[1:25:24] day you got saved, a million got lost.
[1:25:27] Amen. You got saved and a million lost.
[1:25:30] Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. Okay. We
[1:25:34] going to continue on now.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's wonderful to be in
[1:25:38] the presence of God, isn't it?
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Listen,
[1:25:42] while I'm preaching, you're not going to
[1:25:44] distract me. If you feel like going to
[1:25:47] the washroom, go to the washroom. If you
[1:25:49] feel like getting up uh and and walk and
[1:25:52] exercise, come back so you can remain
[1:25:54] fresh to receive everything. That's
[1:25:56] fine. Is that right? Neither am I going
[1:25:59] to stop you if the Holy Spirit hits your
[1:26:00] heart and you want to run these floors.
[1:26:04] Praise God. Hallelujah. Amen. You want
[1:26:06] to shout hallelujah, shout hallelujah.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; I don't like lock jaw Christians.
[1:26:14] I always tell the story and I've told it
[1:26:17] over and over again of the farmer that
[1:26:19] walk into this church and walking
[1:26:22] barefoot with the mud all between his
[1:26:24] toes from in the field and he walk in
[1:26:27] and sit down in the front bench
[1:26:30] in the front and the preacher start to
[1:26:33] preach thank God that the Lord Jesus
[1:26:36] Christ came and died for our sins. He
[1:26:38] said, "Glory to God. Hallelujah."
[1:26:45] All the people turned around, look at
[1:26:47] him.
[1:26:49] Amen.
[1:26:50] But they continue to preach him and
[1:26:52] says, "And they took him to Calvary and
[1:26:55] nailed him to the cross. But on the
[1:26:58] third day, he rose." He says, "Glory to
[1:27:01] God." Hallelujah. Praise God. He felt
[1:27:04] two arms,
[1:27:06] two deacons, one on this side, one on
[1:27:08] the other side. They pick him up, says,
[1:27:10] "Brother, we need to go to the vest
[1:27:12] tree, not the office, the vest tree." So
[1:27:16] took
[1:27:18] they took him into the vest tree
[1:27:22] and they said, "Let's make a deal.
[1:27:28] if you come back next Sunday, we are
[1:27:31] going to provide you a pair of shoes
[1:27:35] because we notice you don't have shoes.
[1:27:38] He said, "Oh, I'm glad for these shoes.
[1:27:40] I I never really had pair of shoes." And
[1:27:43] so, well, the regular shoe can't fit
[1:27:46] him. So, they bought him sneakers,
[1:27:48] oversized sneakers,
[1:27:50] brand new. But when you come back, don't
[1:27:54] say amen. In this church, we don't say
[1:27:57] amen here and praise the Lord and all
[1:28:00] this shouting, right?
[1:28:04] Well, he wants the the sneakers so bad.
[1:28:07] He says, "Okay." Right? Next Sunday, he
[1:28:12] dress a little better than he was
[1:28:13] before. Come back next Sunday. Doesn't
[1:28:16] even know how to walk with pair of
[1:28:18] shoes. So, he's slacking with this
[1:28:23] coming up the aisle of the church. proud
[1:28:25] that he had shoes,
[1:28:28] right? Take a seat in the front. And the
[1:28:30] preacher looked at him with a light
[1:28:32] slight nod. In other words, remember we
[1:28:34] have a deal.
[1:28:39] [Laughter]
[1:28:41] And so he begins to preach again and
[1:28:44] talk about our Lord healing the sick.
[1:28:47] And he came down to the point that when
[1:28:50] and the Pharisees were against him and
[1:28:52] they hated him for delivering the people
[1:28:55] and so they conspired against him and at
[1:28:58] last after the garden of Gethsemane they
[1:29:00] imprisoned him and they took him to
[1:29:03] Calvar's hill and there they pierced him
[1:29:05] in the side to the guy.
[1:29:09] You got to say praise the Lord.
[1:29:14] He said, "Then they buried him in the
[1:29:18] tomb, but on the third day he rose
[1:29:22] again." He said, "Go."
[1:29:28] He says, "And he spent the 40 days with
[1:29:30] his disciples and talking to them." And
[1:29:32] then he ascended up. He says, "Glory to
[1:29:35] God. Sneaker or no sneakers." Praise
[1:29:38] God. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Amen.
[1:29:45] So, I'm trying to tell you I hope none
[1:29:46] of you like that cuz I don't have any
[1:29:49] deal with you.
[1:29:54] And you don't need to hold back
[1:29:56] anything.
[1:29:59] Church is not a place for repression
[1:30:03] or oppression.
[1:30:05] It's a place for expression.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Prophet said God don't like
[1:30:10] conservatives.
[1:30:12] No, I'm not talking about the political
[1:30:14] conservatives.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about conserv too
[1:30:18] conservative in nature. Uh too
[1:30:22] conservative, too private with
[1:30:23] everything else. You you need to be a
[1:30:26] open person,
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; right? I don't mean you just go telling
[1:30:29] all your family secrets.
[1:30:32] [Laughter]
[1:30:34] Oh my goodness. I'm preaching now.
[1:30:39] Oh my goodness. Yeah. But but but to be
[1:30:42] an open-minded openhearted person,
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; right? God, he says God likes
[1:30:47] openhearted people. Amen. That's why he
[1:30:50] love Peter. You know, he just tell what
[1:30:52] was in his mind. He just tell you off or
[1:30:54] tell you what was in his mind. He's not
[1:30:56] going to be thinking one thing and then
[1:30:57] tell you something nice on the other.
[1:30:59] No, no, no, no. He'll tell you the
[1:31:01] truth. Amen.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; That's why we loved our brother Peter
[1:31:05] when he was here.
[1:31:09] Praise the Lord. God bless his heart.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Because he'll tell you, he say for
[1:31:15] crying out loud, that's how you going to
[1:31:17] behave or that's what you're saying.
[1:31:19] It's not that way. It's this this this
[1:31:21] this. He doesn't care whether you like
[1:31:24] him or you don't like him, he'll tell
[1:31:25] you the word.
[1:31:27] Amen. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:31:30] Hallelujah. See, you see, but I want you
[1:31:32] to know something. Rocks are not only
[1:31:34] for foundations,
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; but rocks are used also as anchors.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; You know, in the old days when they
[1:31:43] didn't have nice ski anchors, what all
[1:31:45] those big ships used to use, you know,
[1:31:47] it was rocks. They would get a big rock
[1:31:50] and tie their rope around it and that's
[1:31:53] what they would throw overboard uh to
[1:31:55] use as an anchor. Praise the name of the
[1:31:58] Lord. And I think that we as Christians
[1:32:01] not only need the rock as a foundation,
[1:32:04] but we need something that can anchor us
[1:32:06] to the word of God.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; We want our lives anchored to the
[1:32:11] promise of this hour.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because like I said, we
[1:32:16] living in stormy weather. We living in
[1:32:18] troublesome times. We living in perilous
[1:32:21] times. Chaos, confusion, madness,
[1:32:25] insanity is everywhere. And you need
[1:32:28] something to keep you anchored to the
[1:32:31] word of God.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; And the devil is putting all kinds of
[1:32:38] fakes around.
[1:32:41] Fake preachers, fake churches, fake
[1:32:43] this, fake that. Everything is fake.
[1:32:45] Amen. Praise God. But God wants you to
[1:32:48] have the real and hold on to it. Amen.
[1:32:53] rocks also are used or were used as
[1:32:57] ballasts.
[1:32:59] Now you say, well, what is a ballast? I
[1:33:03] look it up and it says a ballast is
[1:33:05] something whether in electrical use,
[1:33:09] in a car or on a ship, it is something
[1:33:14] that plays a crucial role
[1:33:18] in ensuring the stability.
[1:33:22] Amen.
[1:33:24] Preventing
[1:33:26] that object from swaying,
[1:33:31] preventing it from tipping over
[1:33:36] or from going overboard.
[1:33:39] In other words, a a balance gives you
[1:33:42] balance.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; That's what the balance does. And a lot
[1:33:46] of Christians need balance.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Is that right? A lot of preachers needs
[1:33:51] balance.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; A lot of churches need balance. They
[1:33:55] gone overboard on certain doctrines.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Some preachers riding a certain doctrine
[1:34:00] as their hobby horse.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; They got a little horse riding like the
[1:34:04] like a child riding on a hobby horse and
[1:34:06] that's all they can ride is healing or
[1:34:08] miracles or tongues or or they can uh
[1:34:12] they can ride even the prophet as the as
[1:34:15] the hobby horse. Yeah. That's all they
[1:34:18] can ride. they that what else is in the
[1:34:21] word is not open up to them or they're
[1:34:24] not using it or they're not walking in
[1:34:26] it. Amen. And we can go to either
[1:34:29] extreme. Prophet said you can get in
[1:34:31] there revelation. He said you can go to
[1:34:34] to weeds on it if you go too extreme
[1:34:37] that way or go this way. You got to stay
[1:34:39] right down the middle of the road. Keep
[1:34:41] your balance
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; on the word of God. Hallelujah. Praise
[1:34:46] God. Don't go extreme on anything, but
[1:34:49] stay in the middle of the road. Praise
[1:34:51] the Lord. Stay between the white lines.
[1:34:53] Obey all the right signs and you're
[1:34:56] going to get to heaven right on time.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. You see,
[1:35:02] when the ballast is on the ship and the
[1:35:04] ship is going back and forth in stormy
[1:35:07] weather, if you have a good ballast,
[1:35:09] even in the storm, the ship may move a
[1:35:12] little, but it's going to keep its
[1:35:14] balance and just go right through the
[1:35:16] waves. And that's what God is asking you
[1:35:18] as believers that you just don't take
[1:35:21] the word and say, "Oh, I got the word.
[1:35:23] I'm standing on the promises." Yeah,
[1:35:25] you're standing on the promises. You got
[1:35:27] the foundation. But don't sway.
[1:35:30] Don't let your mind be swayed.
[1:35:34] Oh, I I heard this preacher on TV. I was
[1:35:37] watching this on uh YouTube. Maybe I
[1:35:39] better stay home. I can listen to that
[1:35:41] or maybe I can uh there's a brother in
[1:35:45] this message that also preaching there.
[1:35:47] I better run there or I better listen to
[1:35:49] that or run over here or run over there.
[1:35:52] Well, and you're going back and forth
[1:35:54] like a chicken that lost his head.
[1:35:57] Is that right? Oh my goodness. This is
[1:35:59] not no old McDonald uh at a farm. A
[1:36:02] little peck here and a little peck there
[1:36:04] and a pec pe there and a pec here. No,
[1:36:06] no, no, no, no. We are here to stand on
[1:36:09] the word with stability, my friends.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; Firmly fixed upon the rock of God.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; And hold to God's unchanging hand.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Praise God. Hallelujah. Praise
[1:36:23] the Lord Jesus. Amen. Praise God. That
[1:36:26] is why Jesus Christ is described as our
[1:36:29] rock. He is our stabilizer.
[1:36:33] Amen. He's my anchor.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; He is my everything.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; He's our foundation stone.
[1:36:42] Amen. And he is the seed of God that was
[1:36:45] laid in you
[1:36:48] before the foundation of the world.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. I'm not so good
[1:36:53] with computers. I was trying to search
[1:36:55] for that coat I've presented to you all
[1:36:57] before many times and um not like
[1:37:01] before. I can remember those things and
[1:37:03] just bring them things like that say my
[1:37:05] God where did you get that? I I I can't
[1:37:08] remember but it's there in the word and
[1:37:10] if you search you you'll find it. Amen.
[1:37:13] Praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:37:15] So it was laid in you before the
[1:37:18] foundation of the world. The word makes
[1:37:21] you become conscious of that and then
[1:37:24] you start to work out. You're already
[1:37:27] saved. It's in there. But you got to
[1:37:29] work it out. The world don't know that
[1:37:31] you're saved. They don't world don't
[1:37:33] know that you are part of the bride. You
[1:37:35] the world don't know perfection dwells
[1:37:38] within. But you got to work out the
[1:37:41] perfection.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; You got to work it out. Your life will
[1:37:44] reflect what is inside of you.
[1:37:48] your character, your nature, your what
[1:37:50] you say, how you act, and what you do.
[1:37:53] Is this making sense,
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Steve?
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; I don't want to become an old man and
[1:37:57] just go rambling, rambling,
[1:38:00] rambling on forever. I'm not going to
[1:38:02] keep you here. So, before you all start,
[1:38:04] old man, why don't you just
[1:38:11] forgive me, brother Chris? I just got to
[1:38:14] be myself. I can't be anybody else.
[1:38:17] Praise the name of the Lord God. Amen.
[1:38:21] The Lord's our rock
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; and in him we hide.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; He's my shelter in the time of storm.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Stormy weather comes. And the oak tree
[1:38:33] knows if it stands firm, it's going to
[1:38:36] become stronger after the storm is
[1:38:38] passed. I know some of you here or maybe
[1:38:42] out there
[1:38:44] in the lands out there wherever you are.
[1:38:49] You may be going through a stormy
[1:38:51] weather and a hard critical crucial time
[1:38:55] within your life, your family, your
[1:38:58] marriage, your relationship,
[1:39:00] your personal identity
[1:39:03] within your person. You may be going
[1:39:05] through that. Amen. Peter was a little
[1:39:09] stone.
[1:39:11] But listen what
[1:39:14] Paul said in first Galatians 2:9. He
[1:39:17] said, "I perceived
[1:39:19] that James, Peter, and John
[1:39:24] seem to be pillars in the church of
[1:39:27] God."
[1:39:29] And when we go to Revelation 3:12,
[1:39:33] he that overcomemeth,
[1:39:36] I will make a pillar in the temple of my
[1:39:40] God,
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; and he shall go no more out. Hallelujah.
[1:39:45] Praise God. Be a pillar in the temple of
[1:39:48] God. I want you to know here today that
[1:39:52] uh pillars are solid and stable. Is that
[1:39:56] right? Amen.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; Even banks when they want to tell you
[1:39:59] that your money is safe with us, they
[1:40:01] build a building and they put two, three
[1:40:03] big pillars in the front to impress you
[1:40:07] with the stability of the bank will
[1:40:10] never go bankrupt. Your money will
[1:40:12] always be here and you and always get it
[1:40:16] when you want it. Maybe but you can only
[1:40:18] get only maybe a thousand at a time.
[1:40:24] But anyway, we are stable.
[1:40:27] We're not moving. All right. Praise God.
[1:40:31] Like that. See, my friends, I want you
[1:40:34] to know that clearly. That is the way it
[1:40:36] is. Praise the Lord. That uh we are the
[1:40:40] sons and daughters of God. And we are to
[1:40:43] be God wants us to be solid.
[1:40:47] He wants us to have stable lives.
[1:40:50] Amen. Praise the name. Not running from
[1:40:53] church to church.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; Sunday you're in this church and the
[1:40:57] next Sunday you're in another church.
[1:40:59] You're tasting the dishes in every
[1:41:00] restaurant.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; You want to eat at this restaurant, but
[1:41:07] go and pay in the next one over across
[1:41:09] the street. Pay your tithes across the
[1:41:11] street. No. You eat at this restaurant,
[1:41:14] you pay your tithes in this restaurant
[1:41:15] that you eat. Does that sound fair?
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Does that sound sensible? Yes.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; It's simply enough for anybody to
[1:41:23] understand that you don't eat in this
[1:41:26] restaurant and then tell the owner over
[1:41:28] there, I'm going and paying next door.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. Even the police won't
[1:41:33] agree with you with that one.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; And that's why we as believers need to
[1:41:39] be pillars in the temple of God.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; I believe sister Johnson was a pillar in
[1:41:45] this temple of God. Hallelujah.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; I believe brother Peter, sister Sharon,
[1:41:49] there were pillars in the temple of this
[1:41:51] of God.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; The Ivans, brother, brother brother Tom,
[1:41:55] sister Sharon, pillars in the temple of
[1:41:57] God. You can't move them. You can't
[1:41:59] shake them. Hey, praise God. And there
[1:42:02] are believers in here that are pillars
[1:42:04] in the house of God.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord God. Amen. Yes, sir. Oh
[1:42:09] my. You know, there's a difference
[1:42:11] between a pillar and a post.
[1:42:14] I'm sorry. Listen,
[1:42:17] you can either be a pillar or a moving
[1:42:20] goalpost.
[1:42:22] You decide which one you're really going
[1:42:26] to be. Amen. Either a pillar or a post.
[1:42:30] The seed of God in you makes you
[1:42:33] stabilized.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Can somebody say amen?
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Praise God. It keeps you from swaying.
[1:42:40] It keeps you from the devil even swaying
[1:42:42] you. The storm can't sway you because
[1:42:46] you are founded on the rock.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. You're not
[1:42:52] going overboard on nothing. You're not
[1:42:55] going overboard on all kinds of
[1:42:57] fantastic stuff in some parts of the
[1:42:59] message.
[1:43:01] If you're a real believer, you don't
[1:43:03] drink coffee.
[1:43:15] A real believer will be a vegetarian.
[1:43:21] You're not to eat juicy beef.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; You're not to have all these things. You
[1:43:27] see, you can go extreme.
[1:43:31] That might be your personal choice, but
[1:43:34] you don't tell somebody else that they
[1:43:37] can't do this and they can't do that.
[1:43:40] Uh Paul tells you plainly, he says,
[1:43:42] "Nobody tells you about this moon or
[1:43:45] that moon or not eat this and not drink
[1:43:48] that." He says, he says to Peter, he
[1:43:51] says, "Peter, you know, you and I know
[1:43:53] we can eat anything we want." He said,
[1:43:56] "But for that young brother's sake,
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; you can eat the pork,
[1:44:02] but don't eat it in front of him
[1:44:06] because he hasn't matured enough to know
[1:44:09] that eating pork or not eating pork or
[1:44:12] eating beef or it's nothing, right? God
[1:44:15] don't care about whether you eat this or
[1:44:17] you eat that is that you stay with the
[1:44:19] word."
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; And the word will lead you and guide you
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; for your own health. You going to decide
[1:44:24] what you want to eat and what you don't
[1:44:25] want to eat. That is your decision.
[1:44:27] Praise the name of the Lord. But just
[1:44:29] don't go off extreme.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm saying these things
[1:44:33] because I've been tested by those things
[1:44:35] through the years. Different uh
[1:44:37] believers coming with all kinds of stuff
[1:44:39] selling health foods and so on. Nothing
[1:44:41] is wrong with that, but they want to
[1:44:43] think that that is like gospel. But you
[1:44:46] stay with the word. Okay.
[1:44:49] Praise God. Hallelujah. Amen. Thank God
[1:44:53] we have an anchor
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; that will keep your soul.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; No matter what happens, my anchor holds
[1:45:01] and it grips the solid rock.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; That rock is Christ. Hallelujah. In
[1:45:07] these troubled times, this rock is Jesus
[1:45:09] Christ.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; And I'm anchored to him. Amen. I
[1:45:13] anchored my soul in the heaven of rest.
[1:45:16] Amen. I'll sail the white seas no more.
[1:45:19] Thank God I'm not wandering around
[1:45:21] anymore.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; This is my church home.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; This is my church home.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Praise God. The sister walked on the
[1:45:30] street. She's just passing by. All of a
[1:45:33] sudden, the Holy Spirit dropped on her
[1:45:35] and said, "There is your church home."
[1:45:37] She's never been here before, but she
[1:45:39] just the ne walk in here. Since she
[1:45:43] walked in the door, she Oh my god.
[1:45:45] Immediately I feel like I just come
[1:45:47] home. Amen. What was that? It's the
[1:45:50] living God who is alive forever more.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; He still leads us and guides us. And
[1:45:56] sons and daughters of God are led by the
[1:46:00] spirit of almighty God.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; They're not caugh caught up in forms,
[1:46:06] fashions, and systems. They're caught up
[1:46:08] in the leadership of the Holy Ghost.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:46:13] Hallelujah. Thank God. I'm the ship. I I
[1:46:17] I am the I am the ship that the sea is
[1:46:20] in. You the ship that the sea is in. And
[1:46:24] I'm referring more to Jesus cross in the
[1:46:26] Sea of Galilee in the ship with the
[1:46:28] disciples. Now he's in the ship with
[1:46:30] you.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Okay. He's in the ship
[1:46:34] with you. And the storms may come into
[1:46:36] your life. Yes. bad storms and
[1:46:40] lightnings might flash and thunder roll
[1:46:43] and the sail or your sales may be
[1:46:46] ripped. Your financial conditions all
[1:46:49] kind of problems. Your husband problems,
[1:46:52] your wife problems, your children
[1:46:55] problems. And humanly speaking, you
[1:46:59] don't know what to do. You don't know
[1:47:02] where to go. It seems like your night of
[1:47:06] is filled with blackness. filled with
[1:47:09] sadness and your ship you you you
[1:47:11] believe but your ship still swaying
[1:47:15] from side to side. You you you don't
[1:47:17] know which way to turn in the blackness
[1:47:20] of the night. But I want to say here
[1:47:22] today, go wake Jesus.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; Go wake Jesus. Wake up that seed in you.
[1:47:28] Wake up the life of God that's in your
[1:47:31] hair today. Amen. The lion, the tribe of
[1:47:34] Judah can break every chain and set
[1:47:37] every captive free. Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:47:41] Praise God forever more. Hallelujah. Let
[1:47:45] me tell you, he still can cause that
[1:47:48] seed to speak peace to your troubled
[1:47:51] heart.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Master, the tempest is raging.
[1:47:59] The billows are tossing high.
[1:48:04] The sky is overshadowed with blackness.
[1:48:08] No shelter or help is nine.
[1:48:13] Care us thou not that we perish?
[1:48:18] How can thou lie asleep? That's when
[1:48:21] people think God don't care.
[1:48:24] God is sleeping and he doesn't see my
[1:48:27] situation.
[1:48:29] My situation is so secret that he
[1:48:31] doesn't know. They forget that he is God
[1:48:33] because he knows all things and he knows
[1:48:36] your situation. It's not hidden from
[1:48:38] him. You don't have to be ashamed,
[1:48:40] embarrassed, and go hide up yourself
[1:48:41] somewhere and think that God doesn't
[1:48:43] know about you and he doesn't want to
[1:48:45] help you. Amen. He doesn't want to
[1:48:48] strengthen you. He doesn't want to bring
[1:48:49] you out of your situation. The devil
[1:48:52] wants to just separate you from your
[1:48:54] brethren because that's how these uh
[1:48:56] these lions and animals work. Once they
[1:48:59] can separate you from from the from the
[1:49:02] group, then they'll eat you up and chew
[1:49:04] you alive.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. But not to be around the group
[1:49:07] where the group is going to surround the
[1:49:09] sick and the weak and defend them for
[1:49:12] the glory of God. Hallelujah. Amen. Yes,
[1:49:15] sir.
[1:49:17] Oh, careest thou not that we perish.
[1:49:22] How canst thou lie asleep when each
[1:49:26] moment so madly as threatening
[1:49:31] the grave in the angry deep. The devil
[1:49:34] threatened to bury you with all kind of
[1:49:36] problems. The winds and the waves
[1:49:40] circumstances
[1:49:41] got to obey his will.
[1:49:44] The winds and the waves must obey his
[1:49:47] will.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; Whether the wrath of the storm or sea or
[1:49:53] demons or men or whatever it be, no
[1:49:58] waters can swallow the ship where lies
[1:50:03] the master of ocean and earth and skies.
[1:50:09] They all shall sweetly obey thy will.
[1:50:14] Peace be still.
[1:50:17] Peace be still. They all shall sweetly
[1:50:22] obey thy will. Peace. Peace be still.
[1:50:29] Yes, Jesus is our rock.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; He was a rock with David
[1:50:36] when he was being hunted.
[1:50:39] When Saul was after him, he was David's
[1:50:42] rock. David hid in the rock in a cave in
[1:50:47] the rock.
[1:50:49] He was David's rock when Goliath come
[1:50:53] against David and against the people of
[1:50:56] Israel. And he placed his hands in the
[1:51:00] brook and randomly he thought picked up
[1:51:04] a stone.
[1:51:06] And with that stone from the brook, he
[1:51:09] was able to slay Goliath.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, Jesus Christ is the
[1:51:15] word made flesh.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; And he came down from glory to confront
[1:51:22] the Goliath of the ages.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And in that contest up there in
[1:51:29] Gethsemane and on Gat's hill, Amen.
[1:51:35] Jesus Christ through the stone, the
[1:51:38] revelation of the word. I know who I am.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; I and my father are one.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; Though you slay this body and lay it in
[1:51:49] the tomb. Amen. I'll raise it up. I will
[1:51:52] raise it up in three days.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know who I am. Yes.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; Defeated the devil and the contest on
[1:52:03] Golgata's hill. Amen. Praise God. In
[1:52:07] David's situation, one stone changed the
[1:52:10] history of Israel.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; In the history of the church, one rock
[1:52:16] changed the history of the whole church.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is the rock.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; And that's why we have now AD, BC, and
[1:52:25] AD. The whole history changed.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Now his he's written all over it whether
[1:52:31] they like it or not.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank God. But it didn't end
[1:52:35] there. God sent a seventh angel
[1:52:40] through this seventh angel of the seven
[1:52:42] church ages.
[1:52:45] Brother William Marian Branham,
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; the true prophet of the 20th century.
[1:52:51] And I say true prophet because many
[1:52:53] claim they are prophets. But there's
[1:52:55] only one true prophet
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; of the 20th century and he was,
[1:53:03] you know, I found some old photographs.
[1:53:05] I was going through them and I found one
[1:53:07] where the bed that brother Brennham
[1:53:09] slept in the house, brother Ernie
[1:53:11] Fandler. And I didn't know that I was
[1:53:15] sleeping on the same bed until brother
[1:53:17] Fandler told me. But there it was, just
[1:53:20] a simple ordinary bed. And when the
[1:53:23] clothes that were in the closet, simple
[1:53:26] ordinary, he was a small man, a small
[1:53:29] stature,
[1:53:32] a man of small stature,
[1:53:35] but he had the rock revelation of the
[1:53:37] word of God.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; Like no man ever had.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, the first time I heard
[1:53:43] it, brother, sister, I couldn't sleep
[1:53:46] because there's something going on in me
[1:53:48] that tells me that's right. That's the
[1:53:51] truth. Amen.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. Amen. And he
[1:53:56] took that rock revelation of the word of
[1:53:58] God.
[1:54:00] You know, I'm saying these things like
[1:54:01] that, but you got to understand,
[1:54:04] nobody ever saw this before. And all of
[1:54:08] a sudden, these things start revealing
[1:54:09] to you. You got no doctor so and so.
[1:54:14] This person you can go refer to to
[1:54:16] confirm your stuff to say, "Okay, now I
[1:54:19] know it's right." You you just have the
[1:54:22] word and that prophet had to have faith
[1:54:27] revelation to believe that this was God
[1:54:31] speaking to him.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he held it until it's blossom
[1:54:36] and bloomed until it is what it is here
[1:54:39] today. Covering every nation under the
[1:54:41] sun, every tribe and every person
[1:54:44] everywhere. It's gone all over the
[1:54:46] world.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; They thought they could stomp it out.
[1:54:51] thought they could destroy it. They
[1:54:53] thought that they'll pour water on the
[1:54:55] fire by blackening his name,
[1:54:58] destroying him. But he said it long
[1:55:01] after I'm gone. And though I lay in the
[1:55:04] grave, he says they're going to
[1:55:07] recognize the things that I have said
[1:55:10] are thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; Everyone will come to pass.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. He says, "Let them come
[1:55:20] and show me where anything fails. Let
[1:55:22] him show." Not one, nohere. Amen. He
[1:55:27] took the rock relation that word and
[1:55:30] faced off. I got five minutes more and
[1:55:33] I'm going to squeeze this mango until I
[1:55:36] get all the juice out of it.
[1:55:38] Right? So, just relax. I'm You're going
[1:55:42] to leave here on time, but I have to get
[1:55:45] in to talk to you here. Praise the Lord.
[1:55:48] Amen. He took the rock revelation of the
[1:55:51] word that God had revealed to him and
[1:55:54] faced the Goliaths
[1:55:58] of denominational systems out there, all
[1:56:02] the religious organizations of the day.
[1:56:04] And by God's grace and with his
[1:56:06] supernatural power, he slew them
[1:56:08] everyone.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; And right now, they're running around
[1:56:12] not knowing they lost their head. He's
[1:56:14] already chopped it off.
[1:56:17] They lost their headship which is Jesus
[1:56:19] Christ.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; They're calling his name. They're
[1:56:21] writing books. They're making records.
[1:56:23] They're doing all kinds of but they lost
[1:56:25] their head.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; The sword of the word has taken their
[1:56:28] heads off already.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. You said he that she he she's dead
[1:56:34] while she is still alive. She's dead
[1:56:36] while she live. That's that's them
[1:56:39] right. They're walking around still
[1:56:41] around like if they're living but
[1:56:43] they're really dead. Look around you. Go
[1:56:46] into them. Visit some of them. Oh, lots
[1:56:48] of shouting. Lots of jumping up. Lots of
[1:56:51] screaming and shouting. That's not life.
[1:56:53] That's just a snake with his head
[1:56:55] chopped off and his body is just keeping
[1:56:57] a whole lot of going around and not
[1:56:59] producing any life. That's not life.
[1:57:02] Amen. The life is Christ in you working
[1:57:05] himself on the outside. Amen. Praise the
[1:57:08] name of the Lord. Amen. But now is our
[1:57:11] time.
[1:57:12] We are the part of the bride that we are
[1:57:15] the rare guards of the Lord's host and
[1:57:19] we are here confronting the god of this
[1:57:21] evil age
[1:57:23] in the name of Jesus Christ in a form of
[1:57:26] a religious system. It's a giant. We're
[1:57:30] facing another giant here. And this
[1:57:32] giant we are facing is steeped in
[1:57:34] witchcraft.
[1:57:36] Amen. Praying to the dead. steeped in
[1:57:40] all kind of hedaism
[1:57:42] and and it's Christianity once again
[1:57:45] versus paganism.
[1:57:48] So we are engaged in a contest. We are
[1:57:51] about to carry on this contest and to
[1:57:54] end bring to an end the greatest battle
[1:57:57] ever fought the end of the church ages.
[1:58:01] So we need the kind of preaching and
[1:58:03] teaching that is not just going to
[1:58:05] preach, let me say even preach the
[1:58:08] Bible, but God wants the preaching that
[1:58:11] will drill down to the bedrock.
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; So that you can lay foundations for the
[1:58:17] people.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; You see, I notice a lot of brothers,
[1:58:23] they're preaching the word next level.
[1:58:26] They're preaching even the message.
[1:58:30] and preaching a message in a way that
[1:58:32] they're giving a lot of information
[1:58:36] and sure you get enlightened with
[1:58:38] information but we are in this stage now
[1:58:43] we have heard we have recognized now
[1:58:47] it's time for the applying of the token
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; that the in other words the word I
[1:58:53] preach must relate to you
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; yes
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; so when I step off of here what you
[1:58:58] going to do about
[1:59:00] How you going to live? What you going to
[1:59:01] do? Amen. How you going to walk? You
[1:59:04] going to go out the same way you came
[1:59:06] in?
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; You're going to think the same way you
[1:59:08] used to think? No. It must transform
[1:59:10] you.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; It must change your way of living, your
[1:59:13] way of thinking.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; Must make you want to do something.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. Praise God. So,
[1:59:21] it's the age of the application of the
[1:59:24] token.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So, we are not here to
[1:59:27] impress one another with our knowledge
[1:59:29] of the message.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; We are not here to to to show you how
[1:59:35] shiny my sword is because I polished it
[1:59:37] up last night.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; You know, we we we we don't have, you
[1:59:42] know, these soldiers, brother uh Henry
[1:59:44] told me, they polish up all the brass
[1:59:46] buttons and everything else and polish
[1:59:48] up the rifle and oil it up. And so, when
[1:59:51] the battle start, they're the first one
[1:59:52] to throw down the gun and run. And the
[1:59:55] ones they thought were cowards and were
[1:59:57] just hanging on, those are the guys.
[1:59:59] They don't want to die and I am not
[2:00:02] going to die first. You going to have to
[2:00:04] die. So, and they end up becoming the
[2:00:06] heroes.
[2:00:09] Amen. God has stood their ground.
[2:00:12] Hallelujah. Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:00:14] Amen. So, we need preaching that will
[2:00:16] drill down to the bedrock.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. and take the
[2:00:22] word to the people's lives. Amen. Yes,
[2:00:25] sir. What how am I doing to the
[2:00:28] marriage? What am I going to do with
[2:00:31] just uh the lamb and the dove?
[2:00:35] And the dove, the Holy Spirit came down
[2:00:37] on the lamb and the lamb.
[2:00:40] But you see you have to take that truth
[2:00:45] and apply it to the person's life
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; or else the truth only gonna remain in
[2:00:51] their head
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; and it will remain even in their heart
[2:00:55] but they won't know what to do about it.
[2:00:58] So every time you will notice every time
[2:01:01] I make a point or a position here then I
[2:01:05] will uh say but the what the Lord is
[2:01:08] showing is that you are the pillars.
[2:01:11] It's not that we preaching but pillars
[2:01:13] in the word of God here it's you have to
[2:01:17] be stable. You got to have a stable
[2:01:19] life. You don't have to have a a flighty
[2:01:21] mind as they call you a flighty person.
[2:01:24] No but a mind of heart that is stable.
[2:01:27] You're founded on the rock.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; Uh you're you're a man, not a mango.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; In other words, a breeze blow and a
[2:01:34] mango fall until it drop. Right? You're
[2:01:38] a woman. You're not just a a leaf in the
[2:01:41] wind, but you're holding to God's
[2:01:44] unchanging hand.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, 1 Samuel Samuel said,
[2:01:50] "There is no rock like our God."
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Why did he say that? Because
[2:01:56] water comes from this rock and because
[2:01:59] oil comes out of this rock. Because
[2:02:01] honey comes out of this rock. Praise
[2:02:04] God. We need a rock like this.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; I need a rock to give me oil for light
[2:02:08] so I can light my lamps. Amen. Praise
[2:02:11] the Lord. I need water to quench my
[2:02:13] thirst. Amen. And we human beings, we
[2:02:16] got to thirst. We need the light of the
[2:02:18] Holy Spirit. We need heavenly sunshine
[2:02:20] like Paul had. Amen. To shine upon us
[2:02:23] for the glory of God. Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:02:26] Yes, sir. And further than that, thank
[2:02:28] God for this rock. We can stand on the
[2:02:30] rock because he said, "Moses, that rock
[2:02:33] there, go stand on the rock." When you
[2:02:35] really stand on this rock, you'll see
[2:02:37] the glory of God.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; You'll see the glory of God if you're
[2:02:40] really standing on the rock.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I hope what you're standing
[2:02:44] on is not a brick,
[2:02:47] but you're standing on the rock. Amen.
[2:02:49] So let me encourage you today
[2:02:52] to press on
[2:02:55] because what God wants you to be a
[2:02:57] pillar. Do you want to be a pillar in
[2:02:59] the house of God?
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; God wants you to be a pillar. Amen. See
[2:03:05] a rock or a stone. It speaks of
[2:03:07] permanence. It speaks of stability. It
[2:03:09] talks about steadiness. Men and women
[2:03:13] that are steady. Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:03:17] Praise God. even young people, steady
[2:03:22] children that you can rely on because
[2:03:25] that's what the rock is speaking of.
[2:03:27] It's it's uh it's portraying the fact
[2:03:31] that it's stable. It's steady. It's the
[2:03:34] rock of ages. It's not moving. It's it
[2:03:37] has its way that it's going to live. And
[2:03:38] this is the way I'm going to live. And I
[2:03:40] live by the word of God and by God's
[2:03:43] unchanging hand. Amen. Praise God. So
[2:03:46] God wants you to be and I'm winding up
[2:03:48] to close now. God wants you then
[2:03:52] to be a rock in your home.
[2:03:56] He wants you to be the stable person in
[2:03:58] your home. It don't matter your husband,
[2:04:02] your wife, the way they're that way. You
[2:04:05] be the rock in that home. You be like
[2:04:09] the pillar in that relationship.
[2:04:12] Be the permanent balanced in that
[2:04:17] friendship. No matter how it go back and
[2:04:20] forth, go back and forth, you hold to
[2:04:23] God's unchanging hand.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; You're steady in one direction. Amen.
[2:04:29] Praise the name of the Lord God.
[2:04:30] Hallelujah. Yes, sir. I want you to see
[2:04:34] that clearly. God wants you to be the
[2:04:36] rock not only in your home,
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; but he wants you to be a rock in your
[2:04:40] neighborhood.
[2:04:43] Praise the Lord. Sister Johnson
[2:04:46] was a rock in her neighborhood.
[2:04:49] She never come to church in her vehicle
[2:04:52] alone.
[2:04:54] You hear what I said? She never come to
[2:04:57] church in her vehicle alone.
[2:05:01] So what do you mean? Because she always
[2:05:04] coming with somebody with her. Sometimes
[2:05:08] her van is filled with people who never
[2:05:10] came before.
[2:05:12] because she's talking about the Lord,
[2:05:15] sharing the grace of God, sharing
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; what God give to her, neighbors,
[2:05:20] friends. Praise the Lord. Her daughter's
[2:05:23] right here. She knows I'm telling the
[2:05:24] truth.
[2:05:26] Wherever she's coming, but now it's
[2:05:29] become, you know, standard and
[2:05:31] satisfactory for some of us. Uh, make
[2:05:33] sure I get myself to church. Yeah,
[2:05:36] that's yourself. But think of it. God
[2:05:38] wants to use you more than that.
[2:05:41] Amen. God wants to use you and God and
[2:05:45] you got to make yourself available for
[2:05:47] him to use you
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; for his glory and for his honor. How's
[2:05:51] he going to show his glory? Give God the
[2:05:53] chance to work a miracle.
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; So you provide the environment, the
[2:05:58] atmosphere. Praise God. And God will do
[2:06:00] it for his glory and honor. He wants you
[2:06:04] young people to be the rock in your
[2:06:06] school.
[2:06:08] In this generation where young people
[2:06:10] are swayed back and forth, drugs, drink,
[2:06:14] sexology, and madness in the schools,
[2:06:17] even what they're teaching in the
[2:06:18] curriculums, not based on the word of
[2:06:21] God. God wants you to be a rock
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; in your school
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; in right there. Hallelujah. Doesn't mean
[2:06:31] you're going to walk up and be
[2:06:33] confronting the teacher and this and
[2:06:35] that, but you don't move off of what you
[2:06:38] believe.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; Don't move from your foundation. Stay
[2:06:41] with the word of God. I'm hearing what
[2:06:44] you say.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; Just like I'm here. When I go out, I
[2:06:46] hear people cursing.
[2:06:48] What? Brother Simon, you you hear people
[2:06:51] cursing? Yes, I do. My ears are not so
[2:06:54] clean that I don't hear.
[2:06:57] or I'm not so Christian that I'm gonna
[2:06:59] do like it's there. You go on the bus,
[2:07:02] you hear it all around you. Listen, the
[2:07:04] the world is weary. It's tired. It's
[2:07:07] going and it's all around you. You're
[2:07:10] you're surrounded by darkness and it's
[2:07:12] all around you. But in the middle of it,
[2:07:15] Amen. Praise God. The ship can be in the
[2:07:19] sea, but the problem is if that ship
[2:07:22] allow the sea to get inside the ship.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; Yes. then the ship has trouble.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; It's the same with the believer. You be
[2:07:30] in the world but not of the world and
[2:07:33] don't let the world permeator come into
[2:07:35] your life.
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; You hold to the word of the living God.
[2:07:39] And even in the school, be a rock on
[2:07:43] your job. Be a rock.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:07:47] Hallelujah. Now, quickly, I know I'm
[2:07:50] going over a little time. Just give me
[2:07:52] the time. Let me finish here. Um,
[2:07:56] I went to the Home Depot. I wanted to
[2:07:59] buy a certain thing and when I tried to
[2:08:02] buy it, it didn't have another part. And
[2:08:04] the guy that was selling me said, "Ah,
[2:08:08] that part is they have the part over
[2:08:10] here. I can I can give you one of those
[2:08:12] and you can just take it and go out with
[2:08:14] it." And I said, "No, I I don't do that.
[2:08:18] I can't do that."
[2:08:21] He He says, "No." Oh, he smiled and he
[2:08:23] says, "No, no, no." He says, "No, okay."
[2:08:26] He take the part he gave me. He wrote a
[2:08:29] note and put his name on it.
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Walk up to the counter and
[2:08:33] give this to them." I walk up, of
[2:08:35] course, they checked it out. When I go
[2:08:36] out, his name is Dave. Let me not say
[2:08:40] it. I go to say the rest of it. He gave
[2:08:43] me his old name. And then when I walk
[2:08:45] out, I realize, oh my goodness, that is
[2:08:48] my old supervisor.
[2:08:51] When I was working in construction,
[2:08:54] there was all kind of gravel. There was
[2:08:55] all kinds of wood and all kinds of
[2:08:57] stuff. And certain men would fill up
[2:09:00] their truck and they gone home with it.
[2:09:02] And one day saying to me, you know, you
[2:09:05] can take some of this and you can you
[2:09:07] can take it home with you. I said, no, I
[2:09:10] don't do that. I don't care whether the
[2:09:12] boss sees me, the boss knows, or the
[2:09:14] boss don't know. God knows, and I know,
[2:09:18] and I'm not taking anything. That was
[2:09:21] the same person that was testing me
[2:09:24] again there by saying you can take this
[2:09:27] part you know and then when he sign his
[2:09:30] name and give me the thing and I go out
[2:09:32] he's smiling you know he thought maybe I
[2:09:34] would remember but I didn't remember
[2:09:37] until I leave then I realized oh my
[2:09:39] goodness it's the same thing but you it
[2:09:43] means you're permanent you haven't
[2:09:44] changed
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; many years pass still the same principle
[2:09:49] founded on the rock, founded on the
[2:09:52] word. Amen. And that's what God wants
[2:09:54] all of us to be, founded upon the word
[2:09:56] of God.
[2:09:58] Hallelujah. If you're found in a
[2:10:00] wilderness situation,
[2:10:03] between a rock and a hard place, maybe
[2:10:06] you're like Jacob
[2:10:09] and it's so hard you got to make a
[2:10:14] pillow. Your pillow got to be a stone.
[2:10:17] In other words, you lay your head on
[2:10:19] your pillow, you can't sleep
[2:10:22] because it's
[2:10:24] so hard.
[2:10:26] Things are so tough that you can't
[2:10:29] sleep. Whatever you're in a sour, bitter
[2:10:33] battle, in a marriage or in a
[2:10:36] relationship
[2:10:38] situation, no matter how hard or how
[2:10:41] difficult it is, you can still find
[2:10:44] there is honey in the rock.
[2:10:47] You might find yourself again like Jacob
[2:10:53] having sleepless nights
[2:10:57] and you got to lay down yourself
[2:11:01] on that pillow.
[2:11:03] Symbol of lay down your five senses on
[2:11:06] the stone. Lay on the rock. Take your
[2:11:11] five senses and lay it on the word.
[2:11:13] Trust the promise. Put your faith in
[2:11:16] that
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; and you're going to start dreaming
[2:11:19] dreams. You're going to see visions and
[2:11:22] God will tell you what to do.
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; He'll lead you and guide you and bring
[2:11:27] you out of your wilderness situation
[2:11:30] that you are in by his mighty hand.
[2:11:33] Redemption by blood and by power. He'll
[2:11:36] bring you out. Praise the name of the
[2:11:39] Lord. Hallelujah. And then you'll find
[2:11:42] rest in Christ. And some of you may have
[2:11:46] recently come to Christ.
[2:11:48] You've been baptized
[2:11:51] and while you're on the rock,
[2:11:54] you're standing on the rock. But you
[2:11:56] know, when I was a boy, we go swimming
[2:11:59] in the creek or in the river and there's
[2:12:01] big rocks in the river. You stand on it,
[2:12:03] but you know, you got some green moss on
[2:12:05] that rock.
[2:12:07] And sometimes you're on the rock and
[2:12:08] your foot still slip.
[2:12:11] The devil going to want to tell you now
[2:12:13] you're lost. Now you're backslid. But
[2:12:16] what he forget is though you slip.
[2:12:17] You're still on the rock.
[2:12:19] You still believe the word. You're not
[2:12:21] going nowhere. You're still on that
[2:12:23] rock. The rock hasn't moved. It's your
[2:12:26] foot slip. Praise God. Brother, sister,
[2:12:30] even though you have slipped. Even
[2:12:32] though you have made mistakes, you're
[2:12:34] still on the rock.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; You're still on the word. Amen. Doesn't
[2:12:38] matter how whatever it is, he's going to
[2:12:42] shame you in your mind. He's going to
[2:12:44] embarrass you in your mind and and
[2:12:46] everything else until you don't even
[2:12:47] want to come and fellowship. You don't
[2:12:49] even want to come and meet the brethren
[2:12:51] or anything of that nature. Amen. Praise
[2:12:54] God. But I tell you in the words of the
[2:12:57] prophet, no matter what the devil tells
[2:13:00] you, tells you that you're a loser.
[2:13:02] Amen. He says, "Rise and try again.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; Don't give up. rise and try again.
[2:13:10] Hallelujah.
[2:13:12] They try to tell you you failed in your
[2:13:14] marriage.
[2:13:16] You failed
[2:13:18] in your relationship with your
[2:13:20] girlfriend or your boyfriend.
[2:13:23] You failed. That's why he going to be
[2:13:25] speaking to you and telling you that you
[2:13:27] failed like that. You failed
[2:13:31] with your children.
[2:13:32] Devil going to come and play on your
[2:13:34] mind and tell you you're a failure,
[2:13:37] right? Am I talking to you now?
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the name. Yes. He's going to want
[2:13:41] to tell you that you're a failure with
[2:13:44] your children. Then he's going to tell
[2:13:45] you on your job. Oh my goodness. That
[2:13:48] foreman don't like you. You must be a
[2:13:49] failure. Right? It's got nothing to do
[2:13:52] with that. The devil in the foreman or
[2:13:54] the supervisor is always going to want
[2:13:56] to attack the believer.
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; It's not the foreman. It's not the
[2:14:00] supervisor. It's the devil after you.
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; So, so leave the man alone. He got his
[2:14:05] own problems he have to deal with. Amen.
[2:14:08] I tell you, I want you to know that that
[2:14:10] you they're going to tell you you're no
[2:14:12] good. But remember, rise and try again.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; Because in Christ, you're not a loser.
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; You're a winner.
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; With God's help, I can and I will.
[2:14:30] Praise God. Hallelujah. Let's give God
[2:14:32] praise and honor and glory here today.
[2:14:39] Musicians come. We're going to sing a
[2:14:41] beautiful uh song here all together
[2:14:45] bringing glory to the name of the Lord.
[2:14:47] And media people are going to put that
[2:14:50] up there while we give praise and honor
[2:14:52] to God. Would you join me in us giving
[2:14:55] praise to God? Amen.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; And when you're singing to God, you're
[2:15:00] not just singing a song. Sometimes the
[2:15:02] song is a prayer. Sometimes in the song,
[2:15:06] you're telling God your story and asking
[2:15:08] him for his help. Is that right?
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; Never mind what it means to everybody
[2:15:13] else. What it mean to me when I sing it.
[2:15:16] I know how I'm feeling and what is
[2:15:18] talking to me. Praise the name of the
[2:15:20] Lord. So you let the word of God come to
[2:15:23] your life. Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:15:26] Come, brother Mike. Brother Mike, the
[2:15:28] sweet singer of Good Neighbor
[2:15:30] Ministries,
[2:15:34] is going to lead us in this song. And
[2:15:36] it's a song that says, "Stand by me."
[2:15:40] Not that one you thinking about.
[2:15:45] Praise God.
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you.
[2:15:50] When the storms of life are raging,
[2:15:55] stand by me.
[2:16:00] When the storms of life are raging,

[2:26:08] 60 or so coming, young people that we
[2:26:10] know of that'll be here that weekend,
[2:26:12] but we want to uh support the meetings,
[2:26:14] right? We want this church uh to
[2:26:17] definitely be here. Uh that's that's the
[2:26:20] number one way you can support is be

[2:26:25] here, but we want to pack out the church
[2:26:27] supporting them with singing, with
[2:26:29] specials, with with everything, right?
[2:26:32] And there'll be brother brother Kadri

[2:26:35] right. And uh so the Friday night
[2:26:38] service will be here at 7:00. We'll have
[2:26:42] a Saturday morning service at 11:00.
[2:26:45] We'll have a Saturday evening service
[2:26:48] and a Sunday morning service. You've
[2:26:50] been through it before. It's been a
[2:26:52] great weekend. Uh everybody's exhausted
[2:26:54] by the end of it. But that's okay. We're
[2:26:57] supposed to be exhausted by the end of
[2:26:58] it. Right, Brother David? If you're not
[2:27:00] exhausted, then you need to do anything.
[2:27:03] So, here's what we're going we need from
[2:27:04] you. Uh we need you to sign up for uh
[2:27:07] there's a there's it's very detailed out
[2:27:10] there. Michelle's done a good job with
[2:27:11] detailing it. She has the Friday night
[2:27:13] service. She has sign up for uh food.
[2:27:17] All right. And the Friday night is easy
[2:27:20] stuff. All we need is what's on the on
[2:27:22] the machine, right? Same with the
[2:27:24] Saturday morning. Easy stuff. Saturday
[2:27:28] night, easy stuff. Sunday morning,
[2:27:32] big time. All right. Sunday afternoon,
[2:27:35] we're going to have big time potluck
[2:27:36] dinner. It's only us that are supplying
[2:27:38] the food, and we got to we got to go
[2:27:40] crazy with food. All right. So, uh, look
[2:27:42] at those sheets and sign up um on there
[2:27:45] for that. Plus, we need volunteers. All
[2:27:48] right. Um, and the volunteers
[2:27:52] are all broken down into sections. You
[2:27:54] don't got to do everything, but we need
[2:27:57] people who are are are in the kitchen uh
[2:28:00] preparing the food. We need runners to
[2:28:02] go out and bring it all out. We need uh
[2:28:05] a cleanup crew outside. We need a
[2:28:08] different cleanup crew on the inside,
[2:28:10] right? So, not one person or two people
[2:28:13] doing everything, but spread it all out
[2:28:15] amongst us. Easy peasy, right? So, you
[2:28:19] can sign up uh for that as well. The
[2:28:21] other thing I would like to uh mention
[2:28:23] is
[2:28:25] these are young people's services,
[2:28:27] right? I do not believe that there's
[2:28:30] anybody in here
[2:28:33] who've been to more young people's
[2:28:34] services than me. There's not. I've been
[2:28:37] to more young people services. I didn't
[2:28:39] go to one as a young person, but as an
[2:28:42] older person, I've been to all all kinds
[2:28:44] of them. And not once did I not get
[2:28:47] blessed. Not once did the preaching not
[2:28:49] speak to me. Okay. So, don't be
[2:28:51] thinking, "Oh, I'm going to come to
[2:28:53] young people." No, no, no, no, no. God
[2:28:55] is God and God will speak and God will
[2:28:57] do everything and it's fantastic. Some
[2:28:59] people know that already. So, I
[2:29:00] encourage you, be here, support the
[2:29:02] people and uh uh young people. And we
[2:29:06] and in in in doing that just also keep
[2:29:09] in mind that because we're going to have
[2:29:11] a bunch of young people coming, we we
[2:29:16] don't necessarily want the young people
[2:29:19] after the service to be tied up in doing
[2:29:23] everything. All right? Uh we'd like to
[2:29:25] be a little bit more free and that they
[2:29:27] can fellowship with the other young
[2:29:30] people and kind of be hosts to the other
[2:29:32] young people. So don't get it in your
[2:29:33] mind, oh the young people got to help.
[2:29:35] Well, the young people will help, but we
[2:29:37] also want to have them free. Does that
[2:29:39] make sense?
[2:29:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:40] &gt;&gt; It does, right? Okay. So, let's let's uh
[2:29:43] think about all that. So, we really need
[2:29:44] your help in all kinds of ways. And uh
[2:29:49] you know, the last time brother Cadri
[2:29:50] was here, I mean, last year was great.
[2:29:52] Two years ago, brother Cadri was here.
[2:29:54] Do you remember anybody remember those
[2:29:55] meetings? Unfor you can't forget about
[2:29:57] them, can you? Especially if you're here
[2:29:59] on a Saturday night. It was something
[2:30:02] else. Uh, brother Kadri called it
[2:30:04] history, history in the making. And it
[2:30:07] was. So, are you prepared? You got three
[2:30:10] weeks to get prepared, brother, sister.
[2:30:12] And, uh, there's a lot of work that's
[2:30:14] being done in the background already.
[2:30:16] We're going to have tents outside. We're
[2:30:18] going to have barbecue on the Saturday
[2:30:21] afternoon only uh, for the young people.
[2:30:24] And you'll hear more about it as the
[2:30:26] pastor gets back and and and the
[2:30:28] brothers announce it and whatnot. All
[2:30:30] right. Sound good? Amen.
[2:30:32] &gt;&gt; Praise God. God bless you all. Hope you
[2:30:34] had a a good uh feast today in the word
[2:30:38] and uh may the Lord give you a great
[2:30:40] Sunday afternoon. Let's stand. We'll ask
[2:30:43] one of the brothers, Brother Chris, come
[2:30:45] and and and close us in prayer. Brother
[2:30:47] Chris is just back and then he's leaving
[2:30:50] again and we won't see him for a couple
[2:30:53] of months, but we're sorry about that,
[2:30:54] but we also wish him a good uh vacation.
[2:30:57] All right. So, God bless you.
[2:30:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's give the
[2:31:01] Lord a round of praise today.
[2:31:03] [Applause]
