[0:00] [Music]
[0:14] hallelujah and praise the lord
[0:17] may the lord richly bless you
[0:20] what a privilege what an honor
[0:24] to address the sons and daughters
[0:27] of the living god now today
[0:31] we continue in our wonderful
[0:34] study of the
[0:38] seven church ages and
[0:41] my topic for tonight will be
[0:46] cain the son of satan
[0:50] may the holy spirit bless us together
[0:54] as the we open up the word of god
[0:58] and see these glorious hidden truths
[1:03] unveiled from the word of god
[1:07] let us read our scriptures and pray
[1:10] first john chapter 3
[1:14] verses 11 and 12.
[1:19] for this is the message
[1:22] that we have heard from the beginning
[1:26] that we should love one another
[1:32] not as cain who was of that
[1:36] wicked one and slew his brother
[1:41] and wherefore slew he him
[1:44] because his own works are were evil
[1:47] and his brothers righteous
[1:52] god bless us together as we look
[1:55] to the word of god
[1:58] now we understand starting now that
[2:02] god had this glorious
[2:05] plan of redemption and the plan of
[2:08] redemption
[2:10] is for his glory and a
[2:13] testament to his love mercy
[2:17] and grace
[2:20] now this plan of redemption
[2:23] was a plan and is a plan of
[2:26] salvation now
[2:30] god being a savior
[2:33] to bring salvation he must be a savior
[2:37] and for god to be a savior
[2:41] it was necessary that he would
[2:44] predestinated
[2:46] a man who would require salvation
[2:51] in order to manifest his
[2:55] attribute of being a
[2:58] savior he must have
[3:02] a reason and a purpose
[3:05] for doing so now
[3:09] we find friends that uh
[3:12] first of all that's the reason why man
[3:15] uh had to be made manifested
[3:19] in the flesh but we will talk about that
[3:22] later
[3:23] he was manifest in the flesh so that he
[3:26] could sin
[3:27] for if he remained in his original
[3:30] form in the mind of god
[3:34] he could not sin for the seed of god
[3:39] do not commit sin and while he was in
[3:43] god he could not sin
[3:44] so god had to allow man
[3:48] to come to earth and
[3:51] be imprisoned now in
[3:55] a a temple or a veil
[3:58] of flesh so that he
[4:01] could sin and then
[4:04] god knowingful well of course
[4:08] that uh that god could then manifest his
[4:12] attribute his character
[4:16] as being a redeemer a savior
[4:20] a great and mighty god and so we thank
[4:23] him
[4:24] for his love and that we can now clearly
[4:28] see the very purpose and reason
[4:31] for the being of god for god being god
[4:35] god being a savior god being a
[4:38] healer god being a baptizer saving his
[4:41] people
[4:42] and then taking them out and being our
[4:45] soon-coming king
[4:47] that will rapture us out of here
[4:50] by his divine grace now
[4:53] in the book of romans chapter 11
[4:56] it tells us for of him and through
[5:00] him and to him are
[5:03] all things to whom
[5:06] be glory forever and ever
[5:10] amen praise the lord so we understand
[5:14] god gave his command that man was not
[5:18] to touch the tree
[5:21] of good and evil
[5:25] and he could not partake
[5:29] right then of the tree of life
[5:33] you see eternal life had to become
[5:37] flesh first then man
[5:40] in flesh see man in that state then
[5:45] could approach the tree of life
[5:50] praise god so before god could save a
[5:54] sinner he had to raise
[5:56] place one that he could save
[6:00] a one that he could receive to himself
[6:03] so man had to fall
[6:07] and man because man had to fall
[6:10] man had to be in flesh
[6:14] to be able to fall
[6:17] now the plan of redemption
[6:20] is of god
[6:24] and god being god had to get in flesh
[6:28] to be able to save man
[6:34] man had to get in the flesh so that he
[6:37] could fall
[6:38] so that god could save him
[6:42] now satan also had his plan
[6:45] whereby he would get into flesh
[6:49] but that is to cross the fall
[6:52] and to cause man to sin
[6:56] not knowing that god already had a
[6:58] hidden plan of salvation
[7:00] by which he would save man and deliver
[7:04] him
[7:05] from satan's truth
[7:08] praise be to god hallelujah
[7:12] now satan could not come true flesh the
[7:14] way
[7:15] god could come true flesh god came true
[7:18] flesh by his spoken word
[7:20] the word spoken to mary creating a cell
[7:23] in our womb
[7:24] and thereby a pregnancy which produced
[7:27] that
[7:28] holy person that holy thing jesus
[7:31] christ upon the face of the earth
[7:35] satan being a creature no matter how he
[7:38] tries to deceive you
[7:39] he was create he is a created being he's
[7:42] a creature
[7:44] he is corrupt he is evil in every way
[7:47] and because being a creature he will
[7:49] come to his
[7:50] end but the endless god of eternal life
[7:55] could speak his creative word
[7:58] and create a body as son
[8:02] that he might the father may dwell in
[8:05] the sun
[8:07] god becoming flesh for the word
[8:11] became flesh praise god hallelujah
[8:14] the word god spoke became flesh
[8:18] and walked among us praise god
[8:22] hallelujah
[8:24] now we understand praise god
[8:28] that there was the only
[8:31] animal that was close enough to man
[8:35] that satan could get into
[8:38] indwell as i spoke of last
[8:42] time and used them
[8:46] and through that beast
[8:49] he then could get himself
[8:54] into human flesh by
[8:57] his high breathing
[9:00] by the crossing of the species
[9:05] by climbing over a wall
[9:09] by crossing over the boundaries that god
[9:13] hath
[9:14] placed there he
[9:17] would come into human flesh
[9:21] and crossed the fall by
[9:24] injecting himself into the human race
[9:29] and into human bodies
[9:31] even to the extent of a resurrection
[9:36] thank god that jesus christ
[9:39] placed himself also in flesh
[9:42] so that by being in flesh
[9:45] he could raise up and show us
[9:49] show the true believer that they will be
[9:52] raised up
[9:53] also even though being in flesh
[9:57] and he would bring about the rapture the
[9:59] resurrection
[10:00] and take us out of here i want to thank
[10:04] god
[10:04] for jesus christ what he has done
[10:08] and what he is doing at this
[10:11] present time now
[10:14] satan getting into that beast
[10:17] that serpent still
[10:20] maintained his vicious
[10:25] uh character so he was
[10:28] vicious and poisonous even in the form
[10:32] of a serpent or of a poisonous
[10:36] snake after the curse is so
[10:41] cruel so bitter so wicked
[10:46] suicidal that in his anger
[10:49] in the poisonous venomous hatred that he
[10:52] spews
[10:54] he bit his own tail
[10:57] he outsmarted his own self
[11:01] and became a pawn in god's plan
[11:05] for as you know satan really can do
[11:08] nothing
[11:09] unless god takes his hands off and
[11:11] allows him
[11:13] to do it which it will fit right back
[11:16] into god's plan now
[11:19] god worked out his own plan and it
[11:22] started right
[11:23] before the foundation of the world down
[11:26] into
[11:27] the garden and then his predestinated
[11:32] plan
[11:32] began to come into view
[11:37] now satan actually
[11:40] as you know death killed itself
[11:43] on golgotha it was so blinded
[11:47] that he bit his own tail and destroyed
[11:50] himself
[11:50] and god used that that part of his
[11:54] nature his anger his evil
[11:57] for jesus became sin
[12:01] he became sin and death so
[12:04] that death will kill
[12:09] in killing jesus he destroyed sin he
[12:12] destroyed
[12:13] death because jesus became sin and death
[12:16] for
[12:16] us he became all those things
[12:20] that we may live again for his glory
[12:23] and for his honor oh thanks be unto god
[12:26] for this marvelous and wonderful gift
[12:30] that has been restored unto us oh
[12:33] praise god beloved now are we the sons
[12:38] of god
[12:39] and what a grace what a glory what an
[12:42] anointing that god has given us as his
[12:45] children
[12:48] now since man
[12:51] in the garden my
[12:54] sin could not get to that tree of life
[13:00] we find that because it wasn't a time of
[13:04] course
[13:07] an animal had caused the fall
[13:10] a beast had crossed the fall
[13:14] and we know when god gave out the
[13:17] judgment he crossed the ground
[13:20] he cursed the woman and he cursed the
[13:23] beast
[13:24] he cursed that serpent
[13:27] and from there we have the principle
[13:31] that animals caused the fall
[13:36] and because of this then animal blood
[13:40] had to be shed
[13:43] and his blood given
[13:47] was the substitute
[13:50] of man being able to have
[13:53] fellowship back with god
[13:57] again but there was to come a day
[14:02] when jesus would become sin
[14:05] or the serpent on moses's pole
[14:09] and that being
[14:12] sin becoming sin satan
[14:16] would destroy the very thing that he
[14:18] brought about
[14:20] to bring the end of man and the fall of
[14:22] man
[14:23] and god would use he himself to destroy
[14:27] it
[14:28] oh praise be to god the wisdom and the
[14:32] knowledge of god hallelujah
[14:35] and so he appeared jesus appeared in
[14:38] flesh
[14:40] for the humiliation of man
[14:44] and by this restored fallen
[14:48] man by standing in the gap
[14:51] so that a man will again
[14:55] become a partaker or
[14:58] partakers of the
[15:01] word of god the revealed word the tree
[15:04] of life
[15:06] praise be to god hallelujah
[15:10] now in the bible then we understand
[15:12] friends
[15:14] that we will be able to see clearly
[15:17] this scheme of the devil of
[15:20] using the serpent seed
[15:24] everyone will understand that the
[15:27] fruit of that woman was
[15:30] not her eating an apple
[15:34] the fruit was cane
[15:37] amen now here it is friends
[15:41] now what uh if eve
[15:44] fell that way what did adam do
[15:48] and why was he cast out the garden
[15:52] let us search out that in the word of
[15:55] god
[15:57] now we find friends that god
[16:01] laid the blame on adam
[16:04] for in the final analysis he
[16:08] was the man that got placed
[16:11] in the garden she came from
[16:15] him and he was responsible
[16:19] for her to protect her to pro
[16:22] preserve her in every possible
[16:26] way now of course we know the bible
[16:30] teaches us
[16:32] clearly that a woman
[16:35] that leaves her husband
[16:38] and goes and have knowledge
[16:42] with another man the
[16:45] bible says she shall be called
[16:48] an adulteress and she is
[16:51] no longer married amen
[16:55] and that husband really
[16:58] has not to take her back
[17:02] but in the bible adam did
[17:05] take her back you see
[17:08] adam did take her back because
[17:11] in and when he took her back he knew
[17:14] what he was doing
[17:18] for in him being our representation our
[17:20] representative
[17:22] and the entire human race being in him
[17:25] like the first oak tree all the oak
[17:28] trees that
[17:29] ever have come upon the earth all came
[17:31] out from the original one
[17:33] and all of us came out originally from
[17:36] the original
[17:37] man adam that was there
[17:40] so when he did that
[17:43] he knew what he was doing
[17:47] praise god she was a part
[17:51] of him oh thank god hallelujah
[17:54] that we are a part of the word we are a
[17:57] part of christ
[17:58] but she was a part of him
[18:02] and there she was but he was willing to
[18:06] take her uh
[18:09] foibles and failures take responsibility
[18:14] in other words upon himself
[18:17] because he loved her so much that he
[18:20] would
[18:21] not let her go oh my friends
[18:24] let me think of it the love of god
[18:28] the love of jesus christ for us that
[18:31] even though we have sinned we have
[18:33] failed him we have fallen
[18:36] in every possible way he loved us
[18:39] with a love that would not let us go
[18:43] oh may we come as the songwriters say
[18:46] and
[18:47] rest our weary souls in him for his
[18:50] love is deeper and greater far
[18:53] than any tongue can tell thanks be to
[18:57] god for that kind of a love
[19:00] now the bible tells us
[19:04] that eve conceived by adam he
[19:10] knew that she would
[19:13] he knew exactly what would
[19:16] happen in the human race by that
[19:20] and this is now the origin of slavery
[19:23] and by this he sold
[19:27] the human race into the slavery of sin
[19:33] and from from that every other form of
[19:35] slavery whether it be slavery to
[19:37] chemicals whether it be slavery
[19:39] uh human slavery whatever uh
[19:43] it all originated right
[19:46] there in the garden in your bible
[19:50] when he saw the entire human race
[19:53] into this slavery of sin
[19:57] that he might have eve
[20:01] and love her with all of his heart
[20:06] now that's what adam knew he was well
[20:10] aware
[20:11] praise god now
[20:14] from her two sons were born
[20:19] sons that would be the fathers of the
[20:23] human race that was even now
[20:26] polluted by high breeding
[20:30] by the mixture and mixing
[20:34] of these two different seeds
[20:38] or pity some people who have no
[20:40] understanding of high breeding
[20:42] uh it doesn't matter they're looking at
[20:45] colors they're looking at races they're
[20:47] looking at cultures they're looking at
[20:49] that and that's not the
[20:51] high breeding because the entire human
[20:54] race is
[20:55] one race amen praise god
[20:58] and so here we are the record
[21:02] tells us jude chapter 14
[21:05] enoch also the seventh from adam
[21:10] and genesis 5 of course is the genealogy
[21:13] of enlock and it gives the
[21:16] genealogy as such read it for yourself
[21:21] you'll find cain is not mentioned in
[21:23] there
[21:24] e adam set
[21:40] is not mentioned in adam's
[21:45] genealogy and he is not mentioned
[21:49] for he is not the son of adam
[21:53] he was the son of the serpent
[21:56] the son of the devil this
[21:59] son of satan that was
[22:03] now injected in
[22:06] the human race if cain was not the son
[22:09] of adam whose son was he
[22:12] he was of the son of that wicked one
[22:15] your answer is in our text that we
[22:18] read earlier today tonight
[22:22] the son of that wicked one
[22:26] who slew his brother
[22:30] the reason that we know that cain had to
[22:33] be a
[22:34] son of satan the son of that evil one
[22:38] first by his the very nature that he
[22:42] displays
[22:44] displaying the nature immediately at the
[22:47] beginning of the world
[22:49] oh my he is made manifest
[22:55] as a murderer of his own brother
[22:59] then manifested as a liar
[23:04] where is thy brother i don't know when
[23:07] he absolutely knew
[23:09] that he killed him he knew where he left
[23:11] him or buried him
[23:12] put him under the ground whatever he did
[23:14] it but uh
[23:15] i don't know a lie so a murderer from
[23:18] the beginning
[23:19] a liar from the beginning and his very
[23:23] nature displayed he was
[23:27] not the son of adam
[23:30] secondly he was not in
[23:34] adam's genealogy by
[23:37] law of the birthright the
[23:40] eldest or the oldest son
[23:44] should inherit the blessings
[23:48] which is what satan was trying to insert
[23:51] himself
[23:52] to do but far be it from god and the
[23:55] wisdom of god
[23:57] he is not even mentioned in
[24:00] adam's genealogy he was not worthy
[24:04] to receive the inheritance he was not
[24:07] qualified
[24:08] to receive that inheritance because he
[24:11] was
[24:12] not the son of adam he was the son of
[24:15] satan the son of the devil now
[24:19] praise god listen genesis 5 3
[24:23] adam lived 130 years
[24:28] and begot a son in his own
[24:32] likeness and after his
[24:37] image and called his name
[24:41] set now the third reason we know he was
[24:45] not adam's son he
[24:49] was not in adam's likeness
[24:52] he was not born in adam's
[24:56] image and any man knows that he
[25:00] would love to look upon his child
[25:03] and see some of his likeness
[25:07] some of his image reflected
[25:11] in the child for the scripture is that
[25:14] every seed shall bring forth
[25:17] after its kind in this case
[25:22] it was not so when
[25:25] adam looked upon him course he
[25:28] knew that this was not his child
[25:32] it was not his son oh my
[25:36] there it was this evil thing had reared
[25:39] its head
[25:40] within the garden of god
[25:43] by the love reproduction
[25:46] we see it by the law of genealogy
[25:51] we can see it oh praise
[25:54] god hallelujah and if you want to check
[25:57] the genealogy of adam check it in
[25:59] genesis
[26:00] check it again in the gospel of luke and
[26:04] nowhere will you find the name of
[26:07] cain mentioned as being a
[26:10] son of adam ins it
[26:14] does not say anything of that nature but
[26:17] it does say in first john
[26:20] cain who was the son of that wicked one
[26:24] he was of that wicked one that was his
[26:28] origin
[26:29] that was his gene his evil
[26:33] warp perverted evil
[26:36] gene was straight from the mind and
[26:40] loins of satan who got into the serpent
[26:44] and used him to inject himself
[26:49] into the entire human race
[26:54] now we find out friends
[26:58] that this one
[27:01] when we apply this we can see that
[27:06] even cain's approach to worship
[27:10] it alienated him from god he thought he
[27:14] could make god
[27:15] love him by building a great altar
[27:19] a high altar and place gold and brass
[27:23] and flowers and
[27:24] silver and and maybe he had some smoke
[27:28] from his sacrifice
[27:29] incense and that would endear him to
[27:32] god but that was not god's
[27:35] way that was not the correct approach to
[27:39] god which was given to abel
[27:42] by revelation and god gives that to his
[27:46] seed today
[27:48] by revelation yes
[27:51] worship everywhere
[27:54] all naming the name of adam the second
[27:58] adam
[27:59] all naming the name of christ all saying
[28:02] that came from
[28:03] adam but really no
[28:07] oh praise god by revelation
[28:11] one is of adam and one is a
[28:14] son of the devil and we recognize this
[28:19] by the testing of the
[28:22] word of god by his flamboyance
[28:27] by his way of worship by his
[28:31] programming he is revealing
[28:36] that he is not of god and his way his
[28:40] nature is not of god
[28:43] for it's contrary to the word of god
[28:47] so we see two lines two seeds
[28:50] two vines growing side by side
[28:54] one taking another to be left but here
[28:58] it is my friends that this
[29:01] line that we see
[29:04] of cain with its great
[29:08] ceremony and pomp
[29:11] and flamboyance and show
[29:14] and programs to capture
[29:17] by sound by sight by feeling by
[29:21] by these outer senses of the body
[29:25] rather than being captured by the
[29:28] revelation of the word of god
[29:32] making itself plain and so we see
[29:36] two lines we see the godly line
[29:40] flowing through sets for enoch was
[29:44] caught up to the presence of almighty
[29:47] god
[29:49] and we see the ungodly line
[29:52] founded by cain
[29:56] oh praise god hallelujah
[30:00] cain was a different kind of person
[30:05] than a bell and set
[30:08] for they were born of the adopt
[30:11] spiritual line
[30:14] oh glory to god oh
[30:17] hallelujah king
[30:20] really should have been spiritual
[30:25] and adam abell less
[30:29] and so on down the line that's the way
[30:32] he thought it would be but it wasn't
[30:34] like that
[30:37] and we find since sin came in
[30:42] every generation has gotten further
[30:46] and further away from god
[30:50] by time and by revelation
[30:53] of the word of god we are further away
[30:57] from god
[30:58] than mankind has ever been
[31:01] but while that is happening in time
[31:04] while that is happening by the flesh
[31:08] the spirit which is timeless worthless
[31:10] and deathless
[31:12] for the true child of god they are
[31:15] closer than they ever were before
[31:19] as the world is being made known to them
[31:23] and they're coming into a deeper
[31:26] spiritual
[31:27] walk on awareness with god so that
[31:32] they can say i and my father
[31:36] are one i am one with him
[31:39] in him and i walk with him alone
[31:43] glory to god hallelujah amen
[31:46] yes sir we find friends it's the same
[31:49] today
[31:52] that the wicked is wicked
[31:56] and violently will withstand the word of
[31:59] god
[31:59] for the owl we know the scripture does
[32:03] not play with words
[32:05] and god has a purpose with everything he
[32:08] says genesis 3 20
[32:11] adam called his wife's name eve because
[32:14] she was the mother
[32:16] of all living
[32:19] oh praise god amen
[32:22] that genesis 3 20 eve
[32:26] the mother of all but no word about
[32:29] adam being the father of
[32:33] all the entire human race
[32:37] for adam was not the father
[32:40] of all living the serpent's seed
[32:45] began to disperse itself
[32:48] all over the entire earth
[32:52] genesis 4 1 eve said i have
[32:56] gotten a man from the lord what
[32:59] if she deceiving her own self and
[33:03] deceiving
[33:04] the rest of the world trying to say that
[33:07] cain
[33:08] uh she got it from the lord
[33:11] when she got it from satan she got all
[33:14] these memberships
[33:16] this great big churches it's the
[33:17] blessing of the lord it's
[33:19] not the blessing of the lord it is a
[33:22] spawning of
[33:23] satan it is born of satan and his
[33:26] lies and the untruths
[33:30] that he has bended embedded in the mind
[33:34] and in the hearts of men she does not
[33:37] say eve doesn't give adam
[33:40] the credit with the fatherhood of cain
[33:46] oh praise god but in genesis 4 25
[33:50] she says god has appointed me
[33:53] another seed instead
[33:57] of a bell she calls cain
[34:00] another seed he's not like adam
[34:03] he's another seed oh my
[34:07] praise god study these things yourself
[34:10] which i cannot go into everything in
[34:13] depth here
[34:14] while we are now dealing with this
[34:17] oh praise god thank god
[34:20] set was appointed instead
[34:23] of a bell and she recognizes her son
[34:27] that came by adam but she does not now
[34:31] recognize cain
[34:32] for he came by the serpent
[34:36] and she says another seed
[34:39] instead of a bell
[34:42] praise god in other words she was saying
[34:45] cain is different from abel
[34:47] uh uh you see oh if it was from
[34:50] adam she would have said god has given
[34:52] me more seed
[34:54] but god hadn't given her any any seed
[34:57] like that
[34:58] so she said uh you know here's a another
[35:02] seed instead of a bell praise
[35:05] god hallelujah now we know that there is
[35:08] an inherent
[35:09] fear of snakes in the human race
[35:14] and we find out and we can
[35:17] uh read of this unconscious
[35:21] revulsion and fear
[35:24] that man has of snakes
[35:28] and it's natural for people to be
[35:31] fascinated by the glistening
[35:34] gleaming multicolored beauty
[35:38] of these uh beasts these creatures
[35:41] called snakes and
[35:45] we know that this is what
[35:48] causes birds people and so on
[35:52] to stand staring at snakes the hypnotic
[35:56] effect
[35:57] of snakes they also
[36:01] have a sexually unconscious
[36:05] uh aura that comes off
[36:08] from snakes sexual
[36:12] lure of snakes is also
[36:16] evident it's unconsciously evidence
[36:20] and snakes have always been attractive
[36:24] and that's why we know isaiah 53 there
[36:27] was
[36:27] nothing to be to uh was attractive
[36:31] a beauty to behold in him not whatsoever
[36:34] he was plain and simple
[36:36] but here we find a tall
[36:40] handsome attractive beast
[36:43] called the snake and so
[36:47] the snake has always stood for fertility
[36:52] evil sexuality and
[36:55] he stands also for both good
[36:58] and bad and has been
[37:02] a phallic symbol through all the ages
[37:05] now you know of all egyptian phallic
[37:08] uh turrets and and pillars and
[37:12] roman great phallic pillars that are
[37:16] there
[37:16] that's what they represent right under
[37:19] the noses
[37:20] of religion but then we find
[37:24] that of course in the garden the
[37:27] serpent is the personification
[37:32] of satan manifesting passionate evil
[37:36] upon the face of the earth and he's
[37:39] always associated
[37:41] with sex and often worshipped
[37:45] in conjunction with it now we find out
[37:49] the study of sexology of course i'm not
[37:52] telling you to go study anything like
[37:54] that
[37:54] i am hitting the surface just to bring
[37:56] the truth to you
[37:58] to you at this particular time
[38:02] hallelujah a lot of people
[38:06] don't read their bibles read your bible
[38:11] they don't know what the scriptures say
[38:15] we know the story of the flood is known
[38:17] throughout the world
[38:18] we know about the fall of man amen
[38:22] and consciously unconsciously
[38:26] in the heart of man they kind of
[38:30] know why sex is the primary
[38:33] sin upon the face of the earth
[38:37] and that eve did not eat an apple
[38:40] but she was an adulteress and committed
[38:44] a sexual act with the serpent that was
[38:48] not a snake but was looking
[38:51] like a man not going on his belly but
[38:54] walking around intelligent the bible
[38:57] says subtle
[38:58] and the scriptures tell us in the curse
[39:01] from today thou shalt grow upon thy
[39:04] belly see
[39:05] that's the way we see it that's the way
[39:08] it is
[39:08] in the word of god now you say well
[39:12] brother simon why didn't god warn
[39:14] eve about the danger of the serpent well
[39:17] god doesn't have to do that
[39:20] for god has already spoken his word
[39:24] god isn't ready stop you shall not touch
[39:26] thou shalt not
[39:28] eat he spoke the word clearly
[39:32] and eve believing the serpent
[39:35] added to the word of god and
[39:39] changed the word of the living god
[39:42] uh for instance the devil might have
[39:44] confused her and tell her
[39:45] well you know you can preserve the fruit
[39:48] you might not be able to keep it but you
[39:50] can
[39:50] preserve it or something uh of that
[39:54] way you see oh my
[39:58] and yet at the same time
[40:01] man she was trying to have her way
[40:05] and at the same time of god's way
[40:09] and it's the same with the so-called
[40:12] modern day christians
[40:14] they want to have their own way live
[40:16] their own way
[40:17] and still go to church sing and praise
[40:19] god and think that they are
[40:21] praising god in and
[40:25] pleasing him but you can't be a black
[40:29] white bird
[40:31] you can't be a drunk sober man you're
[40:34] either drunk or you're zoba
[40:36] that's the way it is you're either in
[40:38] truth
[40:39] or you're in error and he that
[40:43] is guilty in one point of the law
[40:46] has broken the entire word of god
[40:49] don't fool along with the word of god
[40:52] don't play with it don't add to it
[40:54] and don't take away from it but stay
[40:57] with the original
[40:59] word of god now what what did this
[41:02] tree of knowledge produce it produce
[41:06] death because cain killed his brother
[41:08] abel
[41:10] that wicked one my friends
[41:14] killed the righteous and that has set a
[41:18] pattern
[41:19] until this very day in which we live
[41:23] and that pattern will continue on
[41:26] until the restoration of all things
[41:30] spoken of by the prophets
[41:35] that tree of knowledge of good and evil
[41:37] brought death
[41:40] it also produced wisdom
[41:44] the serpent wisdom of satan coming on
[41:47] the face of the earth
[41:49] and producing men of renown
[41:52] clever men giants of knowledge
[41:57] giants in every possible way of
[42:00] scholarship
[42:02] looming over on the horizon as giants
[42:05] over the entire
[42:07] uh myriads of population and masses of
[42:10] men
[42:12] men of reputation and men have renowned
[42:17] but their ways are the ways of death
[42:20] their teachings and principles and
[42:23] philosophies
[42:24] are the ways of death
[42:27] god's people my friends are really a
[42:30] simple
[42:31] humble people called by god
[42:35] spiritually minded and they lean towards
[42:37] god
[42:38] they see god in his word they see him in
[42:41] his work they see him in nature
[42:43] they see god everywhere
[42:46] all praise god as they go about their
[42:49] business
[42:50] chilling the soil and praising god doing
[42:53] their work
[42:54] and praising god and giving him all the
[42:56] glory
[42:58] amen and these are a simple people
[43:03] they care for their care
[43:06] for god's truth rather than
[43:09] wealth satan's people love
[43:13] wealth rather than the truth they
[43:16] love their economy rather than
[43:19] loving humanity and they're caught in
[43:23] that trap
[43:24] and they elevate elevated to that place
[43:27] you see the seed of the serpent has
[43:30] always
[43:30] brought true commerce great commerce
[43:35] upon the face of the earth
[43:39] wonderful inventions but with those
[43:42] inventions along with the good
[43:45] of some of these inventions they bring
[43:48] along with them
[43:51] death their gun powder their atomic
[43:54] bombs
[43:57] killing war but it also kills in peace
[44:01] time
[44:03] their mechanical inventions whether it
[44:05] be guns whether it be tanks whatever
[44:08] even trucks cars whatever they they kill
[44:11] even more in peace time than
[44:15] those inventions do during wartime
[44:19] death and destruction are the fruits of
[44:23] eve's labors death and
[44:26] evil spawned by the serpent
[44:29] through her instrumentality and working
[44:33] through the modern day institution
[44:36] and so-called church bodies producing
[44:40] these
[44:41] uh bastard born to the word of the
[44:44] living god
[44:46] the real genuine born against sons of
[44:49] god
[44:50] changed by the word of god or revealed
[44:53] to them
[44:54] and brought into his kingdom to
[44:56] communicate with
[44:58] with him oh praise god hallelujah
[45:02] by the vine inspirations
[45:06] oh praise god amen yes sir
[45:09] these clever evil serpent seeds
[45:13] they're religious they're not out there
[45:16] anti-god they know there's a god for the
[45:20] devil believes
[45:21] and he trembles he knows there is a god
[45:24] so they are religious and they believe
[45:27] in god
[45:28] they are religious they are like their
[45:31] father
[45:32] the devil first i said they bring death
[45:35] secondly he sent down his serpent wisdom
[45:38] and now he works through the means
[45:41] of religion for he is religious
[45:46] and they are like their father the devil
[45:49] from the beginning their ancestor
[45:52] cain who was religious with an
[45:55] altar that could not
[45:59] please god for what is not of faith
[46:02] is of sin yes
[46:06] but kingdom never believe abel believe
[46:09] god they go to church
[46:13] cain and his generation goes to church
[46:18] they mingle along with the righteous
[46:22] just like the tears mingle with the
[46:25] wheat and in so doing
[46:29] they corrupt the righteous
[46:32] amongst them and produce
[46:36] a nickelodeon form of religion
[46:40] whereby they seek to dominate and
[46:43] dominar everywhere they
[46:46] go they spread their evil
[46:50] poison in every effort
[46:53] to destroy the seed of god
[46:56] even as cain killed a bell
[47:00] so does his seed to this
[47:03] very day there is no fear of
[47:06] god before their eyes oh
[47:10] my and god but i want to tell you
[47:14] god loses none of his own and i'm
[47:18] winding up on one of close now
[47:21] god does not and will not lose none of
[47:24] his own
[47:26] for he said i have them in the palm of
[47:28] my heart
[47:29] and there are none that can take them
[47:32] out
[47:32] from the palm of my hand and god will
[47:36] keep his beloved he's elected his chosen
[47:40] ones
[47:41] he'll keep them even in the time of
[47:45] death
[47:46] and he has promised that he will
[47:49] raise them up in the last days
[47:52] in the last day and because i
[47:55] live you shall live
[47:59] also thanks be to god

[48:05] this meal that you have received
[48:09] may the word of god find its way
[48:14] into the center of your heart and your
[48:17] being
