[0:22] because you can't miss this blessed be
[0:41] the name of the Lord in a wider
[0:42] breakdown in the wisdom versus faith
[0:47] brother brother says Jesus used the
[0:50] father's worked Satan used the father's
[0:55] worked but Shaitan the Satan
[0:59] it can never be anything but Satan
[1:02] that's why don't you think this when you
[1:05] hear those voices that speak to you and
[1:08] put all kinds of fear and doubt into
[1:13] your thoughts that's not God remember
[1:19] that anything that gets spoken to you
[1:22] that is contrary to all things are
[1:27] possible send it back to health working
[1:35] because you are not ordained to receive
[1:37] them all semen can do is like the
[1:42] greatest battle brother brother brother
[1:44] said the greatest battle that you're
[1:46] going to fight is the one between your
[1:48] two years in your mind is when you
[1:50] receive lives from the enemy this is not
[1:54] the hour to believe wise this is not the
[1:58] hour to believe if it and allowing fear
[2:01] to dominate your walk with talk Enoch
[2:06] pleased God because he walked with God
[2:10] and he had a testimony that he pleased
[2:14] God you think it pleases God when you
[2:20] speak you speak things that's not the
[2:34] Spirit of God this is the season right
[2:37] now with us perfecting us God is taking
[2:41] you know all those things that so easily
[2:43] besets because we're gonna run this race
[2:46] these things that so easily be put aside
[2:50] they gotta be moved aside we want to
[2:53] take what God said and we want to take
[2:57] it and believe it and we want to speak
[2:59] it we want to be positive positive
[3:05] positive not negative but we are a
[3:11] positive body of Christ others so here
[3:15] Satan was Satan Jesus was God that's the
[3:20] difference that's the truth lots of
[3:24] Creed and the other ones the word what
[3:27] is true and the other one is false
[3:31] Louisville produces the other can't
[3:34] produce it
[3:36] you see the difference you are all
[3:39] dating to produce you are ordained
[3:47] there's nothing in other words in order
[3:58] for you to finish the race you will need
[4:01] to stay nourished you will need to build
[4:09] not to assemble as often as humanly
[4:13] possible because here you know it's like
[4:18] how can you repeat how can you you know
[4:22] like listen yes the Spirit of God is
[4:27] everywhere but when there's a certain
[4:31] time and season were where the sons and
[4:33] daughters have not gathered together
[4:36] something special takes place and you
[4:40] can never replace that you can never
[4:42] repeat that moment you cannot repeat
[4:45] that moment because it could be right at
[4:48] that time in your walk that certain line
[4:51] of faith that certain level of faith
[4:53] that certain word of God that you needed
[4:56] and it came to you right at that time
[5:00] right on that service spiritual food and
[5:06] due season so that you could you need to
[5:10] overcome the trials the Bible says he
[5:14] that hath an ear let him hear what the
[5:17] spirit saith and to him that overcometh
[5:24] he goes up and he says why
[5:30] the tree of life which is in the midst
[5:33] of the paradise of God and so overcoming
[5:37] is a part of receiving and you see it's
[5:45] all goddess this is working everything
[5:49] for your book everything works together
[5:53] for good you see the whole Word of God
[5:58] just starts to come together like a
[6:00] perfect puzzle that there's just no way
[6:03] that you can possibly put all these
[6:06] scriptures together you know and just
[6:08] make it work just right and just at the
[6:11] right time and at the right season so
[6:14] overcoming is important so when you face
[6:19] a trial you need to know why you're
[6:22] facing that trial is it so that you can
[6:25] overcome and so it's because as you're
[6:29] overcoming you're receiving the spirit
[6:31] and hearing the spirit give you
[6:34] instruction on how to overcome you see
[6:38] how it's all so simple but then it all
[6:40] just works together you need to expect
[6:51] the competition as long as you're here
[6:55] and you're gonna run this race you don't
[6:58] need to know about competition and you
[7:03] hopefully are worthy only your best
[7:04] competitor is the devil because he's
[7:09] constantly telling you who you aren't
[7:12] and I can kept but you can't find the
[7:16] word
[7:18] and you can't find that worthy to Sutter
[7:21] the daughter of a cop so you must expect
[7:25] that you're gonna have to overcome that
[7:27] you're gonna have to face trials that
[7:29] you're gonna have a competition in the
[7:31] race and then you're gonna have to press
[7:34] on have to push through you're gonna
[7:36] have to face the world situations you're
[7:39] gonna have to face those circumstances
[7:41] but those circumstances they're really
[7:43] working through your trust your coach
[8:02] trust your posture trust the ministry
[8:06] that God has placed you under you need
[8:08] to trust that goddess positions cultures
[8:11] around your life to train you so that
[8:14] you can overcome and with grace somebody
[8:19] that's not willing to take the
[8:20] instruction of a coach that cults don't
[8:23] like those kind of players they're
[8:26] rebellious and there's an the only place
[8:30] rebellion came from was from Satan
[8:32] himself he's the author of rebellion so
[8:37] when there's a rebellious spirit of you
[8:39] that ain't up dot you know that thing
[8:44] that raised us up you know every time
[8:46] that somebody you know of authority you
[8:49] know you know if you're at work and you
[8:52] know you might not like your boss
[8:55] the fact that he's you know got a
[8:57] certain characteristic about him in this
[8:58] and that he swears a lot or he's Balder
[9:01] or he's you know always chasing after
[9:04] the women or whatever it is but that
[9:07] doesn't change who you are and that you
[9:11] must obey those that are over you in
[9:16] your in your chicken urine in your
[9:17] workplace as a boss I'm not talking
[9:21] about where he's going to come and he's
[9:23] going to try and pull any of that stuff
[9:24] on you that I just mentioned there no
[9:28] that's not what I mean
[9:29] but knowing that there's thora T's that
[9:33] have been placed there because God has
[9:35] placed them there well what about God's
[9:37] authorities and when God's you know
[9:40] generals they get into their position
[9:43] and they start to correct you and lead
[9:45] you and guide you and you don't want to
[9:47] take that direction
[9:49] you rebelled against that direction
[9:53] that's that's going to be one of your
[9:56] weaknesses and you need to overcome that
[9:59] you need to overcome that spirit of this
[10:03] world that that constantly wants you to
[10:05] lead out against your leadership against
[10:08] those that have been given certain
[10:10] authority over you to direct you and
[10:14] guide you in this life hallelujah and
[10:18] you need to have a winning attitude
