TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good sunday morning friends and thank you for being here and again thank you for the opportunity of being able to speak to you you who represent the bride of jesus christ the true church of the living god in these last days it is my honor given to me by god to preach his word and to be a blessing to your hearts and lives may the lord bless us all together as we come in as one in christ to him be the glory the honor and the praise my topic for today will be the voice of the resurrected one amen may the lord bless us all as we come together in his name my scripture is found in revelation chapter 1. reading from verse 17 and verse 18 and it reads and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death praise be to god for the reading of his word let us pray together our gracious god our heavenly father as we come in the name of jesus christ we ask your blessing upon the word of god upon the minister of the word upon the people that are here to receive the word wherever they are may my voice be heard father and may the great holy spirit use it as a vehicle to convey his truth that may bring light into the dark corners of the earth we ask this in no other name but in the name of our blessed lord jesus amen the voice of the resurrected one john is giving us the picture of him being on the isle of patmos and he hears a voice behind him and the bible tells us he turns to see the voice or the person from whom the voice came and when he turned and looked he saw it was jesus and jesus spoke to him and was telling him i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead now you know according to history even in bible genealogy you will read over and over again and adam lived for so many hundred years and he died and methuselah lived for a thousand years of whatever and he died and noah lived for so many years and he died but when we read about the lord jesus christ he turns and says i am he that was dead but i am alive forevermore praise be to god here he is the ever-living one the mighty christ risen from the dead the resurrected one and today i'm speaking on the voice of this resurrected one i can say voice of the resurrection for he is the resurrection and the life he is the rapture he is all in all this jesus whom we love and serve may ye declare himself by the word of god now we know that the early church was in the image of the second adam it was formed and shaped not by organization but it was shaped by the hand of the great holy spirit of the living god they were so much like jesus in their walk in their talk in their actions they were like him and so ought wheat to be to be like jesus in everything we do and say oh praise god the bible says they took knowledge of them that they had been with jesus hallelujah you know when you are uh the wife of someone or a good friend of someone somehow you begin to pick up each other's ways habits and certain peculiarities here the scripture says they took knowledge that these people had been with jesus oh praise god may it be on our record that we spent time with the lord we come to know the lord in the power of his resurrection until we we don't have to tell anyone i'm a christian because just looking at you perceiving your actions your attitudes your intentions and motivations their real lives from your the sweetness of your spirit amen from your action and your attitude they can recognize the christ in you god in christ christ in the church the kingdom being restored back again blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah the early church is the resurrected christ working and acting through his earthly body that early church that was there and he they were in seoul they were in such harmony with him or he the head was in such harmony with his body that they were just working together perfectly in signs wonders salvation manifestations of god movings of the holy spirit one sermon on the day of pentecost 3 000 were born again by the grace of god hallelujah why because christ the resurrected one was working through his earthly body which in his body is the church of the living god displaying the same kind of oneness that was there in the garden between adam and eve before the fall and now when he has come back to his people and bringing them back to himself and to his word then we see that oneness that union that uniting just emerging again that oneness is emerging again where there is hardly you can hardly pass a a razor blade between christ uh standing alone or jesus christ in the people because they're becoming so much like him the headstone praise god that you can hardly pass a razor blade between them because they can now say i and my father are one lord of god oneness in understanding oneness in the revelation oneness in the anointing oneness in the word of god for i recognize you should recognize that i am a part of that word praise god hallelujah that's why i understand that's why you will understand the word when you begin to recognize that you you have not you're not just here yesterday or 40 years or 20 years ago but you weren't in the mind of god before the foundation of the world but it's now made known to you and and you realize and recognize that you are not just a child of time but you are a woman a man that come from the presence of almighty god and you're going back to god hallelujah amen amen praise god hallelujah now realize the first eve that was in the garden with adam she fell because she was she allowed herself to be seduced by the false teaching of the serpent satan satan in the serpent which was not a snake at the time for the bible said it walked it talked it had reasoning powers it was smart and so on anyway the fact is she was seduced by the serpent this is a lie of the modern church that they will not address for they do not want to get in their pulpits and talk about the subject like this because to some ears it may sound a bit raw it may sound out of line but it's not out the line for it is in the word of god god speaks of it that she did not eat an apple to become pregnant with cane she did not eat a pier it was not a pear on the tree it was a pear on the ground and the result was a hybrid born uh boy by the name of cain who was filled with anger and every hateful attitude contrary to how adam was abel being adam's son and cain being the son of the serpent or the serpent's seed oh my she bore them twins one for god one of the devil even saw in the modern church justice came he fell back there the modern church has failed again in the presence of god and is allowing herself to be pregnated by false doctrine false teaching and the seed ideas precepts principles lies of satan has failed her and now she is producing what to theologians professors instead of possessors oh my praise god men that are looking for profits instead of being profit of god being a real prophet of god a real minister and man of god that will shoot the gospel gun barrel straight hallelujah so that you will know the truth and the truths will set you free amen and so he fell back there and they fell into sin but when the church fell at nicaea council they fell into the dark ages oh my take upon it brother sister here we are but thank god true this time of luther wesley pentecost god was starting to shine the light and bring back his word again and now we are in the midst what we are experiencing is the restoration of god's bride tree hallelujah the tree of god oh the wife of god that was separated from him glory to god now the holy spirit is bringing back a restoration bringing it back to the place amen and so once again god has a bride or calling a bride so that he would be able to have another move of god he would have another revival he would have another time of refreshing in the presence of god he will have another latter and former reign why because now he has a bride oh my where he can reproduce himself praise god amen reproduce himself again and the people can recognize that he is the same yesterday today and forever praise god hallelujah oh my do you realize friends brother branham came on the scene and many know of the fact that he spoke the word and squirrels suddenly were created suddenly they appeared on the branch and he shot them and killed them they were not his imagination it was real the spoken word being the original seed the creative force the power of the life of god moving and operating through a human being all to display to the rest of us that what we saw operating and moving in that prophet that minister of god you with a surrendered and open heart god will use you man woman child whoever you are if thou canst believe all things are possible does them that will believe the word of god god used that man in a mighty miraculous wonderful way and it was marvelous to see the multitude of miracle signs and wonders but the greatest things my brother was the preaching of the word for all things come from the word of god from the beginning of time in the book of genesis that nothing could appear nothing could come nothing could was made that was not made or created by god's spoken word and god said and it was so and god said and it was so god said and it was so it remains the same thing today you must go back to the word and see what god said and then when you believe what god said then the rest is fulfilled and it is so god fulfills his word one time he was in a storm and the black light the thunder the darkness came around and the blowing of the wind couldn't find his way out of the woods went in circles dead man's walk and then he heard a voice behind him saying oh just trust me believe raise up your hands and when he raised his hands it touched on a wire that was leading right down to the bottom of the mountain or the hill and he was able to follow that and get himself out of that situation my friends god's program is always genuinely based on the spoken word of god let there be let there be read genesis one you'll cheat they right on my friends it's always the case even hebrew says the worlds were framed by the word of god and nothing was made that could be made except by the word of god amen and it has not changed so we must rely not on the words of man beautiful uh dissertations beautiful deliberations of wonderful argumentations logic of beyond your your your imagination don't you rely on that that's wonderful that's marvelous it's to be admired but let me tell you we ought to rest our face upon the unfailing word of god the unchanging word and say like martin luther here i stand so help me god rest your faith in the rock revelation of god's word that is unfolding before your eyes amen so god is unchanging in his ways and he always creates by his spoken word god has set a time and a season for everything you know that the book of eclipse yes this tells you that there's a season and a time to everything there is a season and there's a time for everything under the sun hallelujah you see adam and eve should have waited god would have spoken to adam and told him it's time for there to be another son or another daughter then adam would have turned and spoken to eve a type of the church like how jesus is speaking to us as his church now and then she eve would take adam's word and speak it and the child son or daughter would be created instantly by the spoken word even so jesus who being the word john 1 1 in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was not a god but the word was god and the word is god same yesterday today and forever and he speaks his word to his wife his church his bride and now what is the bride supposed to do take the very word that was given to her and speak the word again hallelujah and it what does it do it brings about that creative ability creation comes again miracle signs wonders salvation eternal life manifestations of god multitudes moved by the word and power of the holy spirit why because it's the great i am the mighty god the everlasting christ amen that has returned once more to the earth again oh yes he spoke in the word hallelujah that at evening time it shall be light again the darkness that covered the earth covered the minds of god's people that darkness will be pushed away because with the rising of the sun the light of the sun just pushes the darkness out oh praise god brother sister i believe the light of god is shining into the eyes and minds and hearts of those that want to believe amen for the paths of us justin man or woman shine it more and more until they walk into the rapture day into that great perfect day hallelujah amen yes sir oh jesus said john 5 19 the son can do nothing of himself but whatever he sees the father doing do it amen now jesus had that by vision by vision he knew what he ought to do brother branham by vision knew what he had to do we have the word of god revealed to us which is greater than a vision greater than a dream greater than any other gift is the word of god hallelujah and when the true genuine word of god is revealed to you it explodes within your soul oh praise god it creates a transformative force within you changes your life from the inside to the outside oh praise god your past is cast into the sea of forgetfulness and you have a second chance a new beginning where you can start all over again and commit or recommit your life to the hand of almighty god and he says you know he will not look back he will not forget you but he will forgive you cleanse you walk with you and take you until you come to the end of life's journey oh my hallelujah amen so adam should have spoken to eve god's word and eve should have spoken the word and brought about the creation of another seed son of god called from the dust of the earth just as how adam called god called adam and formed him from the dusted earth eve would have used the spoken word and that is how the human being originally should have been reproduced and how they should have multiplied on the face of the earth by god's spoken word but instead eve went ahead of god's program and she did what was in our own heart and used the instrument of sexual relations instead of the spoken word of the living god and that brought death on the face of the entire earth oh praise god brother sister here we are in this hour in which we are living in and seeing the fullness of the word of the living god oh praise his name you see i let me repeat eve should have spoken the word like adam spoke the word to eve and that word would have taken hallelujah and eve herself my friends would already have that son that daughter that child within her then she could speak it into existence and this is proven by the fact god is showing how children should have been brought forth how the human race should have been reproduced for when that hour was come when the word should be fulfilled the bible tells us in the book of matthew that the angel gabriel descended from heaven from the presence of god and stood before mary what did he do and he spoke god's spoken word seed into mary's womb amen mary believe the words of the angel that was spoken hallelujah and by believing the word or message of that angel she became impregnated by the spoken word of god and brought forth what a child which was the living word hallelujah the word of god in the form of a human being now thank god history always repeats itself in our day god sent another angel amen not abraham but his name happened to be william branham god's 20th century prophet and he came with the word of god and stood before a virgin bright church of the living god and brought to her the opening of the seven seals hallelujah he preached and brought to her the unveiling of the mighty god hallelujah she brought to her christ is the mystery of god being revealed glory to god hallelujah amen and furthermore brother branham said he said do you know that the mind is is the spiritual womb of today praise god so in other words when the angel messenger speaks just saith the lord the truth of the word of god and we receive it within the womb of the mind and heart our lives become pregnant with truth our lives become pregnant with the life-giving word of god within us praise god amen oh the mind is a womb and what the spoken word is the original seed oh praise god and we believe that and the seed has caught within the womb of our hearts glory to god and what is it bringing forth in your life it's been in fort and you birth it's bringing forth and you walk a new lifestyle oh praise god a completely new person as the as the song said i'm a new creation i'm a brand new woman i'm a brand new man because why i've been born again by the revelation of the word of god and i'm happy i'm so happy because the word has changed me amen o praises name glory to god we are born in him and he is born again in us lord of god back there not in the manger back there but in the manger of your heart he is born again today oh praise god oh hallelujah oh the church age speaks to us saying and now what that does is flesh our flesh is changing back to become the word and he who is the word is coming back to being flesh in us so flesh is becoming word and word is becoming flesh glory to god hallelujah amen notice carefully brother sister that jesus was put into mary's womb by the spoken word and his body which was in the dust of the earth was called forth to connect with that seed which came forth as jesus christ hallelujah amen praise god hallelujah amen friends here we are in this last day and you and i have been put into god's church body or god's bride or god's wife's body by the spoken word of god is what called you it's what changed you it what's placed you in the body of the church which is pregnant with the truth with the revelation of this hour praise god hallelujah and here we are back to our text which we re we spoke on last week for the lord himself shall descend with a shout with the voice of the archangel or chief angel with the voice of the archangel and the trump of god hallelujah amen what do we see we see the picture that paul is presenting of jesus descending from the heavens spiritually descending here to do what to call his children from the dust of the earth to himself who is the word let me say that again jesus for this rapture he is descending and his reason for descending is to call his children from the dust of the earth to himself and he is the word so he is calling us back to the word back to the resurrected christ back to the ever-living one that was dead but is alive forevermore oh praise his marvelous name that is why we are here this morning to give glory and honor and praise to his mighty name somebody say amen somebody praise the lord out there somebody give him glory hallelujah somebody raise your hand and say hallelujah thank you lord jesus for your blessing and your hand on me here today oh bless his holy name amen amen oh praise god hallelujah why would he descend he is descending because he already knows that there are predestined seed for this age buried in the dust and dirt of humanity and denomination that he can utter his voice and his voice can crawl out those that were dead with dead doctrines dead teachings dead past dead and sin dead and iniquity o praise god and his voice can give them life praise god bring them back to themselves call them from the dust to the earth of human life and of the human race back to his word that they may know him in the power of his resurrection amen as we have said before the only way that a man can reproduce himself is through his wife because god met adam and eve god did not make adam and steve but he made adam and eve so here we are friends that a man only reproduce himself through his wife he only brings forth something that looks like him true his wife and so jesus is descending and he is descending to get some children where he's got to go he has to come to the church first he's got to reveal himself to the church praise god hallelujah amen comes to his wife for his true her that he will be able to bring his word to pass in this day and in this time and to bring forth his children amen he utters his voice while he is descending how does he utter his voice revelation 10 1 the mighty angel the covenant angel the bible said with a rainbow around his head here he comes descending from heaven glory to god the bible says and when he uttered his voice seven sunders roared and seven sanders unto their voices and shook the earth when the angel shouted out praise god who was that it was jesus christ the great covenant angel sputtering his the voice of his word voice of the resurrection this mighty god in christ letting his word go forth and when he comes the bible tells us if you will read revelation chapter 10 amen it tells you that the mighty angel of that chapter 10 spoken of in verse 1 how when he uttered his voice seven senators uttered their voices and revelation 10 the mighty angel went to the earthly angel of revelation 10 7. and the voice that he uttered the seven sunders that he uttered went like it did god came spoke to adam adam speaks the word to eve here he comes he speaks the word it comes to the prophet of this hour the messenger the angel of the age and then that angel now takes the word and presents it to the church of the living god the opening of the word of god amen for the seven thunders come at this hour right through that servant of the living god amen hallelujah the revealed word was being perfectly restored amen seven the number of perfection sunda signs it's the type and symbol of the voice of god even when i was a child and you were children you would always we were always told oh that was the voice of god that's god speaking you see even the natural normal man without the bible recognizing the rolling sundar of the mighty voice of the living god the voice that david said it breaketh the cedars in lebanon hallelujah the voice of god crosses the mountains to tremble oh glory to god he makes the hills to shout and tremble a glory to his marvelous name amen well the shout is the message that shout is the message the herald saying prepare yourself the rapture is at hand prepare yourself behold the bridegroom cometh amen i am he that liveth and was dead but i am alive forevermore john 11 25 i am the resurrection and the life glory to god hallelujah he is the resurrection he is the rapture he is eternal life he is all in all this lovely jesus this beautiful jesus this lily of the valley rose of sharon first and the last beginning and the end son of david mighty god wonderful counselor everlasting father prince of peace oh praise his glorious name yes sir amen oh my then he says a shout goes out uh which is the message that was brought to us and is being brought to you in this day and hour and after that the voice of the resurrection the voice through the archangel the voice of the archangel why because the mighty angel comes to the chief angel of the church ages lord of god and through him the voice of god is made known to us in these last days amen for the voice of the resurrection or the voice of the resurrected one speaking true the messenger of this age hallelujah and when he shouts this shout or voice comes through the prophet for the spirit speaks through the prophet amen the spirit is gets in the prophet and speaks through the prophet hallelujah amen oh my and we heard the voice in this day do you believe it i believe it that is why i'm here today i've been running with this word oh and i keep running and i'm not tired yet i'm gonna run until i get in the presence of almighty god oh hallelujah oh my glory glory glory glory story oh blessed be the name of the living god hallelujah amen his voice the voice of the resurrection voice of the resurrected christ amen what is a voice amen what is a voice praise god hallelujah amen let me say this friends the voice of god in the believer moving and working through them amen listen speaking the prophet speaking and the throne of mercy now the voice from the throne notice before the throne was seven stars and out revelation 4 17 and 18 out of the throne proceeded lightnings slunders and voices amen not one voice anymore but voices lord of god hallelujah amen what was it god speaking to the church glory to god reflecting himself through the seven church age messengers the seven spirits of god hallelujah god and when the true anointed of god speaks it's god deity is speaking through the veil of humanity god veiling himself in a human being and speaking his word all glory be to his wonderful name and when that voice and our voices are speaking then what lightning sunnah all the crack the role the moving of the living god and of the holy spirit god on the scene same yesterday today and forever amen oh my what a day are we living in when the preachers are trying to be so precise so cultured so symmetrical oh in every way they can't hardly even say hell in the pulpit they would hardly say hell and the other said say hell or preach about hell too much all they want to talk about is hell you want to talk about how to get to heaven how to get out of this place in a rapture how to get the escape hatch how to find christ in the midst of chaos oh glory to the name of the living god amen i tell you in this hour we need man that will not hold back but will preach the truth of the word of god and tell the people the very truth amen listen back in the bible the people did not like to hear what the prophets have to say but preachers men of god don't come to tell you what you love to hear they don't come to give you some medicine that you like my mother you would have my brothers come and hold me to put that bitter stuff down my truth and i will be kicking and fighting and screaming to drink that medicine down but that's what i needed and that's what the people need the people want to hear what they love to hear but not what god tells them they need amen they need to repent they need to change their way they need to get out of churchianity out of denominationalism out of trinitarianism out of babylon and out of the alder of the mess in the uh mystery that's out there and be set free by the power of almighty god oh hallelujah amen amen god needs men like that that will not mince matters tell you the truth amen you have a bit of money you're in the church you think you can manipulate the man of god oh a man of god or not real man of god are not manipulated by money how you appear whether you're rich whether you're poor whether you're ordinary or whether you're extraordinary they're not concerned with that they'll preach the word of god whether they have to eat crackers when they have to drink water and eat crackers alone hallelujah you say brother simon you believe that that's what i have done and others that i know of they're called to god's unchanging hand on swerving and will not change but stand upon the truth until the crown regain all blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah amen amen there are men believing this word around the world that truly believe it and will are they'll give up their lives for this crossbelt hallelujah this holy ghost gospel dripping with blood oh praise god i know in the bible there's stone steven they bashed his head in oh my but he looked up to heaven praise god because jesus was standing there any real son and daughter the living god a child of god will stand by the word of god until their crown they gain amen and when this battle of life is over we shall wear a shining crown we will wear the crown given to us by the lord jesus himself when he says come thou good and faithful servants enter in to the joy of your lord hallelujah glory to god amen amen praise god now everybody can't be a preacher amen but you got a voice you can't be a preacher to stand up here like i am standing here today and preaching the word of god amen but you still have a voice amen and if you can't preach the people a sermon then my friends you are still a preacher because what you can do is go out and live the people a sermon your sermon you don't have to preach it but you're preaching it by living it oh praise god made the holy spirit so anoint and bless the many of you hearing the sound of my voice here today go out inspired anointed set on fire by the power and presence of the holy spirit of the living god amen and while i'm even bringing the word of god i'm asking the god to baptize somebody with his power with his presence with the holy spirit with the opening of the word and a revelation of this day that they may recognize their day and the message and messenger of their day amen so you may not be a preacher but you still have a voice amen amen you may not have to preach a sermon from a pulpit but from the pulpit of your heart you can preach a sermon in the sense that you live your sermon before the people amen let your servant sermon be lived listen what brother branham says here let your sermon be live for it is the voice of god that will bring reproach to them who will reject that voice amen they say my friends when they look and you live for the lord look at that man look at that woman nobody can hardly put a finger on them they can hardly find anything to say about them they're living such a sweet life such a such a lovely christian such a beautiful christian what a gentleman what a what a man of integrity of a fortitude a man who stands by god's word and his own word a man who speaks the truth and lives by the truth of the word of god hallelujah amen oh praise god until the sinners outside would say if there ever was a man of god a woman of god if there ever was a real christian it's that man it's that woman it's that young lady it's that young boy it's that young child amen and i'm saying this because god can start with you while you're yet young i was 12 years old when early morning before day break i saw the lord high and lifted up he looked at me he did not speak any words but the way he looked it was a message that i could hear within my heart at 14 the anointing struck my soul was not a member of any church oh but still reading the bible i just took a bible head for the streets begin to preach the word of god along with a friend of mine who is a who is a mighty man of god in the united states today oh a revival broke out in that city oh glory of god hallelujah and there's a church there now with over 2 000 people in it oh glory to god but we didn't know that which was revival we did not know we thought that's how it's supposed to be that's the way it should be and i'm telling you that my friends go when god gets into you and begins to work through you you become the voice of god for the hour and god begins to speak through you in every possible way amen see you we got to live our sermons amen praise god live your sermons don't try to preach them amen woman don't you try to preach them just try just live the sermon oh my stop it stop trying to preach it don't you preach it and only will sound like you're preaching it you ought to live the sermon and let god flow through you in modesty dignity and and grace the love of god and the holy spirit so anointing you until the beauty of jesus christ is seen in you amen amen hallelujah praise god amen so we want to live our sermons amen and if the preacher can't live his sermon then he better stop preaching because we are supposed to preach it and then live it so let's live our sermons in the presence of all the people oh praise god listen to the cry of god's messenger all that there were thousands thousands of living voices living voices why because when the word gets into you amen the word isn't dead the word on the page of this bible that is dead the letter kill it it's the spirit that gives it life so when the spirit of god anoints the word that is in your heart then the word comes to life and you become a living voice for the living god to speak through you to anoint you to use you in every possible way and you the the anointing the power the miraculous presence of god you don't even know what's going to happen when you speak the word because christ in you your hope of glory greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world and god will use you and speak through you for his glory all that we there were thousands of living voices hallelujah in your city in your town in your country wherever you are whichever country you're in all that god would have thousands tens of thousands of living voices amen that he could speak through and make himself manifest walking upon the earth amen once more amen a living voice like jesus was walking around their lies thundering out thundering out with the thunder of god in sweetness sundering out in holiness thundering out in purity thundering out with undefiled clean living amen walking around upon the earth today when they tell you nobody can't live clean in babylon nobody can't link left clean on this earth nobody can't live not telling lies not cheating not womanizing not a harlotry not fornicating an adulterating stealing and lying or whatever and yet danielle lived godly in the midst of babylon which is a sign that you and i we can live godly and clean and secure under the hand of god in the middle of babylon mystery babylon of today oh glory to god hallelujah amen yes sir the real christian amen walking around with that kind of a life of christ in you that is the thunder that shakes the devil amen for he is the seven sunders he is the perfect word he is the fullness of the word and when the fullness of the word comes in you seven thunders blasts out to your life bam bam bam bam bam the power of the presence of the living god god in the father god in the son god in the holy spirit god the only one he is god all over creation he is god down in my soul amen god in the rolling thunder and his god rout all over the floor oh trust him believe him hold to god's unchanging hand in this hour so surrender your life to him completely amen oh my friend you believed the doctor's report you believe the surgeon general report they tell you prepare yourself you're going to die one time they went to a one of the kings in the bible and he was told you're going to die god sent the prophet and says no you go to him and tell him they can only tell him what they can see and according to what they see with their science he is going he's supposed to die but i tell you go to him and tell him he is bound to live he is going to live and the prophet went to him and delivered the word and he lived 21 years after that time oh blessed be the name of the living god oh praise god i believe that that god is alive today praise god amen amen hallelujah yes sir i tell you about that life of christ in you christ's life in you that is the thunder that shakes the devil for when the devil looks he doesn't see that you live in this house this body here anymore but christ lives in me amen so when he sees jesus that defeated him at calvary cast him out of the bondage cast him out to the sick cast him from the dead spirits and the crippled devils the dumb spirits of blind spirits sick spirits the woman with the issue of blood when he sees is the same christ in you he's on the run because jesus is on the charge oh glory to god hallelujah only believe all things are possible to them that will believe the word of the living god yes sir the devil don't care how loud you shout you can get in charge and you can shout as loud as you want the devil don't care how high you jump or how many times you run around the church god the devil doesn't care about that amen don't care about this or about that he doesn't care whether you can come to him with theology you come to him with all kinds of other things but let me tell you if you come to him with a sweet surrendered consecrated life that the lord god has taken over your life and he fills you and uses you for his glory then you become a voice of god in these last days a living person a living voice but a voice comes in you and speaks in you that's why in that day jesus said in that hour think not of what you will say for the father in you will speak through you amen is not i that do the works but the father that liveth in me he dweet the works glory be to god hallelujah amen the heart what hurts the devil is when he looks at you and all he can see is a sanctified life amen all he can see is a life holy surrendered consecrated to god amen see anything to him say anything to a man or a woman like that call him any name and they don't rile up and get mad and forget that they're a christian and before you know it they're all cursed words and swear words come out of their mouth and call the other person all kinds of names no sir it's not like that when those things happen the real christian is even more humble and simple and walk in the light of the word of the living god their sweet and they move right on and that throws the devil away from them that is the thunder that shakes the devil and breaketh the cedars the proud cedars and the proud trees of the wilderness and of the woods amen well you say oh brother simon if i could preach like billy graham or all roberts or like somebody else amen if i could ever be a great influential speaker amen you know what the devil will just laugh at you the devil doesn't pay no attention to that kind of thing oh this one went to bible school that went to seminary that went and studied theology this one got a phd this one introduces himself i had a when i was just a boy i knew a minister like that he was angry if he was not introduced in the proper way introduce me i am the doctor reverend so-and-so uh graduate in the respective fields of eschatology pedagogy hermeneutics and so on and so on and so on oh if he was not introduced like that he was mad and brother's sister this is the emphasis today rather than the life of christ shining out and moving in the people in his power and in his glory amen amen the devil don't pay attention to man's theology in your life amen he doesn't pay attention to your seminary training because he knows he's got you he's got you he trained you in his cemeteries of how to act and the devil just set back and just laugh at you but when he sees that life of christ in you that this is a different form of christianity amen this what i'm preaching to you it's not what the churches many of these churches preaching to you that you have got to take the word of god and go out and try to live like jesus and you're trying to live like jesus know what i am preaching to you what the word is revealing to you that you must surrender let christ come and live in you and then let him live his own life through you that is the life of christ that is not me trying to live it but him living his own life and when the devil sees that that is the real christ living through you that is the thunder that shakes the devil amen it shakes him away in every possible way oh praise god forevermore oh brother sister oh i surrender all to him tonight aim today praise god and i pray that the holy spirit will overshadow every one of us oh praise god are you faithless then come believing are you doubting come believing are you here wondering questioning come believing only believe all things are possible oh praise god brother sister i tell you only believe in the middle of a sermon like this one time a man was sitting there with a cancer in his throat and when the word was going forth suddenly he felt sick and suddenly started and before you know it that cancer got so scared it coughed up and was right on the floor oh praise god i believe is the same yesterday today and forever amen god can dry up god can kill that evil devil that's trying to work in anyone's body in anybody's life he can destroy any sickness any pain take away all your aches he can take away everything the doctor says it's can't be done it's impossible this can't be done that can't be done and god says the battle is not yours the battle is the lord's if thou can't believe all things are possible amen do you believe come to jesus believe him now receive his word and may the holy spirit make it so for god said and it was so and in the name of jesus christ be healed in the name of jesus christ be delivered in the name of jesus christ made that growth dry up shrivel die may the spirit of death pass out of your life and of your body go out from you and make god's spirit come into you and give you a new life give your new health that you might walk in joy walk in the presence of the living god praising him working with him and working in his kingdom amen and those of you who knows not the lord in the salvation of your soul you might have had churchianity you might have been a good man a good woman you say i never swear i never drank that's good but that's not being born again to be born again is for him to be born again in you for christ ask him lord come in forgive my sins cleanse me wash me clean make my white the snow father many mistakes of my life have been many that things in my past have been more i can
