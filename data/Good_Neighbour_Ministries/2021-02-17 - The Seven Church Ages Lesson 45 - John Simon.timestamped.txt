[1:12] here upon the earth may the lord bless
[1:15] you
[1:15] real god as we go to our
[1:18] uh bible study here
[1:22] in the seven church ages
[1:26] my uh scripture being
[1:29] revelation chapter 2 verses
[1:33] verse 11
[1:37] he that had and heir to hear
[1:42] let him hear what the spirit
[1:46] said unto the churches
[1:51] may i repeat he that
[1:54] had an ear to hear
[1:57] let him hear what this
[2:00] spirit said unto the churches
[2:06] gracious heavenly father once again
[2:12] you honor us with the great privilege
[2:16] of being able to approach you
[2:20] by the way of prayer through
[2:24] the blood of jesus christ
[2:28] and the great benefits that we have
[2:31] received
[2:32] for this we honor you bless you
[2:36] glorify your name and come into your
[2:40] presence
[2:41] to hear the voice of your word
[2:44] and to receive it within our hearts
[2:47] in the name of jesus christ our lord
[2:51] glory and honor be to thy name amen
[2:55] and amen praise the lord
[3:01] my topic will be
[3:04] he that had an ear
[3:09] to hear i'm
[3:13] sure that every one of us here today
[3:18] are fully aware of the importance of
[3:21] having your hearing
[3:24] many times in the bible you've read
[3:28] where
[3:29] jesus had to cast out some
[3:32] deaf spirit or a deaf
[3:35] devil or somebody that was just merely
[3:39] ill with a a disease
[3:43] of deafness and could not
[3:46] hear a sound or a voice
[3:50] or they could hardly they could barely
[3:54] hear
[3:54] a sound and we have
[3:57] the colloquial term
[4:01] the hard of hearing they are
[4:04] hard of hearing they can't
[4:07] hear very well
[4:11] when jesus was here on earth many times
[4:14] he spoke
[4:15] preached many messages wonderful things
[4:20] and there was a problem
[4:24] in the sense that when he spoke in
[4:26] parables
[4:28] when he delivered his messages
[4:31] when he began to say i and my father are
[4:34] one
[4:36] when he begin to declare i am the bread
[4:38] of life
[4:40] when he began to say that i am the way
[4:43] the truth
[4:44] and the light no man comes to the father
[4:48] but by me you must be invited by the
[4:52] father
[4:53] recognized by the father identified by
[4:56] the father
[4:58] to be able to approach the heavenly
[5:00] father
[5:01] you don't just come but he
[5:04] bids you to come or else your coming is
[5:08] in vain
[5:10] and so in jesus ministry
[5:14] in making known the great name of god
[5:18] which is jesus christ his great mission
[5:23] to die for the sins of man
[5:26] and to bring them to attention of his
[5:29] word
[5:31] while doing that he had to call
[5:34] out the rest of the
[5:38] seeds of god that were scattered
[5:42] in the earth from the great sore
[5:45] who god was that went forth and
[5:48] sowed his seed or his
[5:52] attributes or his germs
[5:55] upon the face of the earth not
[5:58] in the dirt but in this
[6:02] earth god sowed his
[6:06] seeds of life his sons
[6:09] and his daughters god's own
[6:13] original germs
[6:16] were planted and so jesus started
[6:21] the harvest and started to call them out
[6:26] you know the story how he called
[6:29] one then that one called his friend and
[6:32] that friend called up the other friend
[6:36] and andrew called peter and
[6:40] called philip called nathaniel and
[6:42] that's the way
[6:43] it went amen praise god and that
[6:47] still is happening today around the
[6:50] world
[6:51] where one is calling another and another
[6:53] and another
[6:54] and the word of god is growing and
[6:56] multiplying and
[6:58] god is adding to the church daily such
[7:02] as should be saved
[7:05] now we're speaking about having an heir
[7:08] to hear
[7:10] for three and a half years jesus
[7:12] speaking to the pharisees
[7:16] and only a few could hear him
[7:20] you say what do you mean well the
[7:23] multitudes
[7:24] heard him but they only
[7:28] heard him with their natural ears
[7:33] with which we are all given natural ears
[7:37] and we can hear language english and if
[7:40] we have some
[7:41] uh understanding common sense
[7:44] or education we can clearly
[7:48] define crystallize and understand
[7:51] what is being said to us
[7:55] however when jesus used the term
[7:59] he that had an ear to hear
[8:02] let him hear that was not his thinking
[8:07] of just the natural ear
[8:10] because even though he was speaking to
[8:13] multitudes
[8:14] he knew that only a few
[8:19] were hearing or
[8:22] understanding what he was saying
[8:28] he made the great uh definitive
[8:33] and differentiating statement
[8:36] to the disciples to show them
[8:40] that even though they were all religious
[8:44] pharisees were religious the sadducees
[8:46] were religious they were going to church
[8:49] peter and and andrew and the rest of
[8:52] disciples were going to jesus's
[8:54] little church that he had but he was
[8:57] letting trying to let them see
[8:59] but you are different
[9:04] you are hearing what i'm saying matter
[9:07] of fact they
[9:08] came to him and said master how is it
[9:10] that we
[9:12] we hear what you we understand
[9:15] what you are saying but the rest of
[9:19] of of these pharisees sadducees even the
[9:22] rulers
[9:23] the theologians the doctors of divinity
[9:27] the various
[9:28] reverence of different groups
[9:32] at that particular time they were
[9:36] puzzled and they
[9:39] did not understand and you know humans
[9:42] anything they do not understand they
[9:44] have no understanding of
[9:46] they're ignorant of blinded off it
[9:49] becomes or in their eyes it becomes a
[9:52] trap
[9:54] they take it as something threatening as
[9:57] if you're standing in the dark
[9:58] and you heard a sound and you don't know
[10:01] what the sound was
[10:03] it immediately been begins to evoke
[10:06] fear because you don't know
[10:10] what that sound is but jesus turning to
[10:14] his disciples
[10:16] said you don't understand unto you
[10:21] it is given to know the mysteries of the
[10:25] kingdom
[10:26] but unto them it is not given
[10:31] in other words the kind of hearing that
[10:34] you have
[10:35] doesn't just happen you can't educate
[10:39] yourself
[10:39] into it you can't go to a theological
[10:43] school
[10:43] for it you can't go to the greatest
[10:46] academies universities and places of
[10:50] higher education or learning
[10:52] no secret society no
[10:56] great denomination no matter who they
[10:59] are
[11:00] none can give you this but he says
[11:04] unto you is given to no
[11:08] unto you it's given to know the
[11:11] mysteries of the kingdom of god
[11:15] but unto them they don't have that gift
[11:19] it is not given so one set
[11:25] has been given ears to hear
[11:28] in her ears the
[11:31] ears of the heart the ears of
[11:35] gods of your heart
[11:38] that was placed in you
[11:41] before you were even born again or know
[11:44] anything about him
[11:46] or recognize him he placed that
[11:50] faculty that ability in you
[11:54] to be able to understand him
[11:58] so that when he speaks
[12:02] delivers his word the deep
[12:05] calls to the deep and the deep
[12:09] just understands they don't know how
[12:12] they don't know why nobody there oh no
[12:16] theologian has to tell them
[12:18] but something inside tells them
[12:21] that's the truth i believe it
[12:24] you don't know even why you believe it
[12:27] you you
[12:27] you don't fully understand it all but
[12:30] but yet
[12:30] something in the heart tells you that's
[12:33] right
[12:34] amen oh praise god hallelujah
[12:38] so here in the book of revelation
[12:43] we have this statement being made again
[12:48] the same one who made the statement
[12:51] back in the gospels now said
[12:55] i am alpha i am omega i am beginning i
[12:58] am in i am the first i am the last the
[13:02] lord god almighty
[13:04] and now by the spirit he
[13:07] says he that had an ear to hear
[13:10] let him hear praise god hallelujah
[13:14] amen praise god i tell you my
[13:19] first i want you to receive this within
[13:23] your heart
[13:25] recognize this within your entire being
[13:29] and hold it grasp it and hold on to
[13:34] it for the true evidence
[13:37] of being baptized with the holy ghost
[13:41] is for the believer to receive the word
[13:44] of god
[13:46] for the age in which
[13:50] they live now on the day of pentecost
[13:54] acts chapter 2 you'll find the entire
[13:58] story
[13:59] that pentecostals read and
[14:02] report over and over and over again
[14:06] and that tell you about airing a sound
[14:09] from heaven
[14:10] and how what the sound of a mighty
[14:13] rushing wind
[14:14] and it be moved up on the fire of god
[14:17] fell and how tongues of fire was upon
[14:21] their head
[14:23] and their emphasis is
[14:26] that the people received the holy ghost
[14:30] and spoke in towns
[14:34] and i believe that did but
[14:37] they with their human carnality
[14:41] took that and made it into a doctrine
[14:46] and called it the true evidence
[14:50] of the holy ghost is speaking in towns
[14:55] but in that canality and without the
[14:59] spiritual
[15:00] ears of god a gift from
[15:03] god within your heart that's why jesus
[15:06] said blessed are your eyes
[15:09] that you can see blessed are your ears
[15:12] that you can hear or understand
[15:15] what it is i'm saying unto you when you
[15:18] look in the chapter 2 of acts 4
[15:22] the emphasis is not on
[15:25] this speaking you will find the
[15:29] emphasis is on the hearing
[15:33] for he says they heard
[15:36] a sound from heaven oh bless god may god
[15:40] help you today that you hear a sound
[15:42] from heaven
[15:43] different from the sounds of the earth
[15:46] the voices of the earth
[15:47] may you hear the voice of god speaking
[15:50] in these last days
[15:52] that you might hear a sound from heaven
[15:57] for we it went on and you will read for
[16:00] we
[16:00] heard them we heard them
[16:03] speak with towns and prophesy
[16:07] and as you read the chapter you will
[16:09] find the people that were in the street
[16:11] said
[16:13] what do these for we hear them
[16:16] doing this acting like drunk man what
[16:19] needed all of this
[16:21] the point is the emphasis was more on
[16:24] the
[16:24] hearing the ability to hear
[16:28] that ability they hear so excited them
[16:32] and exploded within their soul
[16:35] with such a trill and with such a joy
[16:38] and an overcoming of the holy spirit
[16:41] that it caused them to tangle up their
[16:44] tongues and begin to
[16:45] babble under the anointing of the holy
[16:48] spirit
[16:49] praise god hallelujah but you see
[16:52] the speaking in tongues was an after
[16:55] effect
[16:56] of the hearing of the word of god
[17:00] it did not proceed but it was
[17:04] an afterglow or an after effect
[17:07] or praise god so the emphasis is
[17:11] on he that had an ear to hear
[17:15] let him hear what the spirit of god is
[17:18] saying
[17:18] to this generation when peter
[17:22] on that great day and jesus asked them
[17:27] who the men said that i the son of man
[17:31] am he some of them said well
[17:35] some of this says you're a teacher some
[17:37] say you're a prophet some say
[17:40] you know you're coming with a new
[17:42] teaching or some say you are
[17:44] your new young rabbi whatever he says
[17:47] yes that's wonderful
[17:49] to know the opinions of all these
[17:51] theologians
[17:52] that they put in books that they cause
[17:54] you to study
[17:55] it's wonderful to know their opinions
[17:58] that they give you in all their
[18:00] wonderful teachings and
[18:02] so on like that but who do you
[18:06] the individual now who do you
[18:09] say that i am what is your opinion
[18:14] what do you have in here to hear do you
[18:17] recognize
[18:18] and he's asking you what who do you say
[18:21] i
[18:22] am you as a person as an individual
[18:26] what do you see when you look what do
[18:29] you hear
[18:31] when you listen oh praise his wonderful
[18:34] name
[18:37] and peter out of the group
[18:40] uh i know who you are he says
[18:43] thou art the christ the son of the
[18:47] living god
[18:48] hallelujah the body in which god's
[18:51] dwelling now or
[18:52] praise his name oh hallelujah
[18:56] jesus answered to him blessed art thou
[19:00] simon barjona or son of jonah
[19:04] flesh and blood has not
[19:08] revealed this onto you
[19:12] but my father in heaven has revealed
[19:16] this onto you and upon this rock
[19:21] which rock the rock of
[19:24] revelation upon this foundation i'll
[19:28] build my church
[19:30] and that foundation is the ability
[19:34] to receive revelation
[19:38] that is the true evidence of the baptism
[19:41] of the holy spirit
[19:43] the gift from god placed within the
[19:48] heart
[19:48] and soul of an individual
[19:53] man woman child whoever they are
[19:57] the ability to re hear and receive
[20:01] the word of god for their age
[20:04] and then go out and manifest it or
[20:08] live it so the world can see
[20:12] what is in you they can't see what is in
[20:15] you
[20:15] until you work out your salvation
[20:20] without fear and trembling
[20:23] so the emphasis is on the revelation
[20:27] flesh and blood has not revealed this
[20:29] unto you but my father in heaven has
[20:32] revealed this unto you and upon this
[20:34] rock of what
[20:36] revelation of who jesus christ is
[20:39] i'll build my church and the gates of
[20:42] hell shall not prevail that
[20:46] over that kind of a church that is
[20:49] built on the ability of receiving
[20:52] revelation from the word of god
[20:55] you see the written word sits here it's
[20:58] static
[21:00] but revelation is the word come alive
[21:04] it's moving it's going to reveal itself
[21:06] any minute any moment
[21:09] to a hundred people a thousand people at
[21:11] the same time
[21:12] revealing different things to different
[21:14] ones at the very
[21:16] same time because it's a supernatural
[21:19] operation of the living god
[21:23] now we know revelations chapter 2 to 3.
[21:30] the seven church ages
[21:33] seven ages of the
[21:37] church of the living god
[21:40] during this time god is not dealing
[21:44] with the jews but god
[21:47] is dealing with the gentiles
[21:51] for it is the times of the gentiles
[21:56] and the times of the gentiles
[21:59] the cup of of corruption
[22:02] sin and also of
[22:05] righteousness comes to a point
[22:08] when it becomes full
[22:12] so we understand when you use the term
[22:15] the
[22:15] fullness of the gentiles
[22:19] the gentiles period or dispensation
[22:23] coming to its end or it's to its
[22:27] fullness
[22:29] just as much as babylon under
[22:32] nebuchadnezzar
[22:34] rose to its heights when it rose to its
[22:38] heights of its civilization
[22:41] and they came to the fullness of their
[22:44] time
[22:45] what happened a prophet stepped forth
[22:49] and they said to him what does all what
[22:52] does the towns
[22:54] the handwriting on the wall what do
[22:57] these
[22:57] towns mean and uh
[23:01] the prophet said no those towns
[23:04] that they're speaking that's not a
[23:07] blessing as you think
[23:10] it's really a curse and
[23:13] really a signal from god that it is the
[23:17] end of time
[23:19] the ending of the gentile dispensation
[23:22] minimum you farsin you are
[23:26] weighed in the balances and you are
[23:28] found wanting
[23:30] oh my oh glory to god
[23:33] here we are once again
[23:36] and the gentile world is glorifying
[23:40] speaking in towns and god is saying no
[23:44] the glory is departed ichabod
[23:48] ichabod the glory of god has
[23:51] gone from you oh lord have mercy upon
[23:55] them
[23:56] and so here it is we've come to the end
[24:00] of the gentile period or the gentile
[24:03] times when god was dealing and
[24:06] is still dealing with the gentiles
[24:11] during that time bringing them
[24:14] unto salvation
[24:17] now the bible tells us unto the
[24:19] messenger
[24:21] of the church and to every age that's
[24:25] how it comes
[24:26] the word of god the word comes from
[24:29] jesus
[24:30] and he delivers it to the angel of that
[24:33] church age one man
[24:37] anointed with the holy spirit becomes
[24:40] the
[24:40] angel of that church age the word angel
[24:43] of course not meaning a heavenly angel
[24:46] but an earthly messenger
[24:49] earthly messenger if you look the word
[24:52] angel
[24:53] it means messenger of good news
[24:56] so or it could be a dark angel but here
[24:59] it is
[25:00] the messengers to the church were angels
[25:02] of god
[25:04] so god said unto the angel
[25:08] of the church amen
[25:11] he that had an ear to hear
[25:14] let him hear take god
[25:18] not they but he one messenger
[25:22] to every church age and the other church
[25:26] ages
[25:27] have already passed
[25:30] and we know just to mention a few the
[25:33] first church age it was the apostle paul
[25:37] and later luther wesley
[25:41] and then under pentecostal church age
[25:46] william marion branham
[25:49] praise god god used that man
[25:54] as the angel to the church age
[25:57] whether it be all roberts t.l osborn
[26:01] all the great evangelists they all came
[26:04] out of his ministry for he
[26:08] was the angel to the church
[26:11] anointed with the holy ghost to fulfill
[26:15] the purpose
[26:16] and plan of god you'll hear more about
[26:19] this
[26:20] but god only speaks to one man
[26:23] in every age that one man
[26:27] then delivers his message
[26:31] and when he delivers his message
[26:34] ordained different ordained men
[26:38] hear that prophet messenger
[26:42] they receive his message and then
[26:45] they go out and begin to teach it preach
[26:48] it
[26:49] and magnify
[26:54] take it out to everyone who has an ear
[26:57] to hear
[26:58] praise the lord because god speaks
[27:02] by revelation to his
[27:06] churches but true church and false
[27:10] church
[27:11] must hear the messenger but only
[27:15] those who were given an heir will hear
[27:18] and the other churches or the other
[27:21] individuals
[27:22] will not hear they'll hear the same
[27:24] message but they're still they're not
[27:26] hearing
[27:27] and one set will hear the same thing but
[27:30] out of that
[27:31] they will hear the voice of god
[27:34] speaking to them through it
[27:37] hallelujah when that message is given
[27:43] then the message begins to be broadcast
[27:47] spiritually across the world everywhere
[27:51] the message becomes broadcast
[27:55] for all who will will come within
[27:59] range of the message within
[28:02] sound of my voice within the range
[28:06] of what is being said and when
[28:10] that message is broadcast or goes out
[28:15] this message is received individually
[28:19] praise god hallelujah
[28:23] you receive it individually in other
[28:25] words
[28:27] you can't go take a a book of
[28:29] fundamentals
[28:30] make up a list of of of things and and
[28:33] get
[28:34] everybody to to rally around
[28:37] that it's not like that god
[28:40] gives his word by revelation not by
[28:45] information intelligence wisdom of man
[28:48] but by the
[28:49] revelation of the holy spirit
[28:52] and you become a nor of the word
[28:56] annoying person a person to whom god
[29:00] begins to reveal himself and the bible
[29:03] tells you
[29:04] in in corinthians galatians ephesians
[29:08] that these gifts especially ephesians
[29:10] who have been given into the church
[29:12] god gives some the ability to to have
[29:16] really spiritual dreams not just
[29:19] dreaming
[29:19] all kinds of things but spiritual dreams
[29:23] some have the wisdom others are gifted
[29:26] with knowledge
[29:27] others discernment miracles signs and
[29:30] wonders
[29:31] and god gives some administrations
[29:34] others
[29:35] give them the power to be able to bring
[29:38] the word of god pastors teachers
[29:41] evangelists
[29:42] exhorters people anointed by the holy
[29:45] spirit
[29:46] and it's not something we work ourselves
[29:49] into study and
[29:50] or praise god but by his holy spirit
[29:54] that ability is placed in the individual
[29:58] and they come up with it not knowing how
[30:01] they got it
[30:04] but it's in them a thirst a hunger
[30:08] a desire within their soul o blessed be
[30:12] his
[30:12] wonderful name o glory to god
[30:15] i was only 12 years old
[30:18] i saw the lord high and lifted up
[30:23] oh praise god and brother
[30:26] when i was 14 we were i was not in any
[30:30] church
[30:32] but i suddenly began to feel a desire
[30:35] to preach the word of god where it came
[30:38] from i
[30:39] can't tell you what the desire came to
[30:42] preach the word of god
[30:46] and went out and began to preach along
[30:48] with a friend of mine
[30:50] two of us and to our surprise
[30:54] a revival broke out in that
[30:58] city or tongue i was in
[31:01] oh praise god people began to come from
[31:05] far and near hundreds
[31:08] saved healed delivered baptized in a
[31:12] name
[31:12] hallelujah and walk with god
[31:15] until to this day in that
[31:19] city there's a church of about 2
[31:23] 500 people oh glory to god
[31:27] god sent a revival now this is not a
[31:30] church revival
[31:31] where we decided we're going to have a
[31:33] meeting and invite
[31:34] people and try to work things up but
[31:37] this is something where the holy spirit
[31:40] himself
[31:42] came on the scene and began to move from
[31:45] person to person
[31:46] to person everywhere and begin to as
[31:49] paul as the apostle said in the book of
[31:51] acts and
[31:52] god not the superintendent
[31:56] and god not the evangelist and
[32:00] god not anybody but the holy spirit
[32:04] working through those who had already
[32:08] heard the word god added to the church
[32:12] daily daily
[32:16] such as should be saved oh it's a
[32:18] miraculous hand of god
[32:20] it's god working and moving by his
[32:22] blessed holy spirit
[32:24] can we have that again yes
[32:27] it's here again the holy spirit
[32:31] we are here writing another book of acts
[32:35] hallelujah go read the book of acts
[32:38] read that book of acts and make bless
[32:40] your soul i challenge you
[32:43] to read the book of acts below the god
[32:45] amen
[32:46] amen when i read that book of acts
[32:49] as a young man a young boy and said
[32:53] all the apostles did all this can i do
[32:56] all this that's that's written here in
[32:58] the bible
[33:00] of course it's true that's what the word
[33:02] says we are supposed to do
[33:04] lay hands on the sick they shall recover
[33:08] amen in my name they'll cast out devils
[33:12] o praises name and they shall drink any
[33:15] deadly thing and it shall not hurt them
[33:18] that doesn't mean you go and pick up
[33:20] poison and try to drink it
[33:21] but if when you are carrying the word
[33:24] somebody tries to poison you
[33:26] no evil thing formed against you will
[33:29] prosper
[33:29] glory to god hallelujah brother sister
[33:33] let's hold to god's unchanging hand
[33:36] let's preach the word let's pray
[33:38] let's let's love one another let's love
[33:41] the word
[33:42] and walk in the light of the word the
[33:45] word of god
[33:47] was received by whom those who had an
[33:51] ear to hear
[33:52] the word was received individually
[33:56] and then those individuals came
[33:59] together and that became a group
[34:03] but it was not the whole group all of a
[34:06] sudden
[34:06] uh all of a sudden they all believe
[34:09] and heard at the same time but each one
[34:12] heard for themselves
[34:15] and recognized the word of god for
[34:17] themselves
[34:19] and then that group
[34:22] was qualified by the holy spirit
[34:26] amen each individual in that group
[34:30] having their own ability whether
[34:34] they be a a child a young man a young
[34:37] woman
[34:38] praise god hallelujah look i was like i
[34:41] said i've been preaching since i'm
[34:43] 14 years old glory to god hallelujah
[34:47] and i'm still running up the shining way
[34:52] the devil is on my track and he's trying
[34:54] to turn me back
[34:56] but i'm running up the shining way
[34:58] blessed be his holy name
[35:00] amen so each individual
[35:05] in this group
[35:09] each one has to have their own ability
[35:13] to hear what the spirit of
[35:16] god is saying by way
[35:21] of the messenger amen
[35:24] so therefore what they are receiving
[35:28] and what they are saying and believing
[35:33] they're not getting their own private
[35:35] interpretation
[35:38] but they're getting god's interpretation
[35:41] for he is revealing it to them
[35:47] god moves in a mysterious way
[35:50] his wonders to perform he
[35:53] plants his footsteps on the sea
[35:56] the sea water the word
[36:00] and rides upon the storm
[36:03] god is his own
[36:06] interpreter he
[36:10] will make it plain oh thanks be to
[36:13] god on high glory to god hallelujah
[36:16] so it is each individual receiving a
[36:20] revelation from god so it's not private
[36:22] revelation
[36:23] it's god-given heaven-set revival
[36:26] it's heavenly sunshine it's light from
[36:29] above
[36:30] shining into the mind and heart of the
[36:33] individual
[36:34] and illuminating their thoughts their
[36:37] thinking
[36:38] on some of the scriptures they read it
[36:39] before they
[36:41] they read it maybe a hundred times but
[36:43] all of a sudden
[36:44] boom the light of god comes on
[36:48] oh praise god i want to tell you there's
[36:51] a
[36:51] man a person here that can turn on the
[36:54] light
[36:55] and his name is jesus christ thank god
[36:58] forevermore
[36:59] amen so
[37:02] each person is hearing
[37:06] and receiving by revelation
[37:10] what the messenger has already received
[37:14] from god
[37:16] but let me put my words here
[37:20] but maybe he never verbally expressed it
[37:25] he just spoke it and left it
[37:29] and the rest of it left unspoken
[37:32] but god takes that word and reveals it
[37:36] into the heart of the individual
[37:40] don't think that is strange because
[37:43] that's the pattern
[37:45] paul set under the hand of god
[37:49] for paul alone for his day had the full
[37:53] revelation even the other apostles
[37:56] admitted that paul had it
[37:59] and paul under the leadership of the
[38:01] holy spirit
[38:03] he was so surrendered to god that he
[38:05] wanted to go
[38:06] over to a belief to asia
[38:10] and god for the spirit of god forbade
[38:13] him
[38:14] amen and said no don't go
[38:17] there and then he said go to macedonia
[38:20] he said for the spirit bad me go
[38:24] hallelujah sons and daughters of god
[38:27] come into that state where they are
[38:29] truly
[38:31] genuinely led by the spirit of god
[38:34] who tells them to go or stay
[38:37] or sit still and wait until i
[38:41] speak into your heart and lead you and
[38:43] guide you
[38:44] and tell you what to do are you getting
[38:47] it are you understanding what i'm saying
[38:49] are you receiving it within your heart
[38:51] is this becoming clearer
[38:53] and clearer unto you every day
[38:56] hallelujah
[38:56] i pray the holy spirit will help every
[39:00] one of us it's the same pattern
[39:03] god the message comes the light comes to
[39:06] the messenger
[39:08] the messenger comes to a certain area
[39:13] and from that messenger the light
[39:15] spreads out to the ministry
[39:18] and lives of other people
[39:21] who begin to be faithfully taught
[39:25] by the word of the living god
[39:29] but of course many do not go out and say
[39:32] exactly what they were taught
[39:34] they begin to add and subtract and take
[39:36] out of it
[39:37] instead of staying with the word of the
[39:39] living god
[39:41] and paul spoke about that and warned the
[39:43] people saying
[39:44] there'll be people that will be coming
[39:46] with the same message the same
[39:48] things that i'm telling you but but
[39:52] don't listen right listen to what you're
[39:55] hearing from me
[39:58] amen paul even told them he says
[40:02] though an angel come down from heaven
[40:05] and tell you anything different don't
[40:07] you believe it
[40:09] if i come back and tell you something
[40:11] different don't believe
[40:12] me paul even used himself and said i
[40:16] can't change it because it's not my word
[40:18] it's the word of the living god and i
[40:21] cannot change it amen
[40:23] hallelujah is the commandments of the
[40:25] lord
[40:26] and friends that is the problem why
[40:30] revivals die
[40:32] revivals die when people go away
[40:35] from the word of god and revivals
[40:40] continue to move when the people stay
[40:44] with the word
[40:45] purpose and plan of the living god
[40:48] and don't listen to the voices of man
[40:52] and that's the reason why we don't hold
[40:56] with these fundamentalist pentecostals
[40:58] denominations
[41:00] and so on because we believe in
[41:02] primitive christianity
[41:05] we believe in active spontaneous
[41:09] anointed revealed word of god coming
[41:13] from the presence of almighty god
[41:15] to inspire anoint lead and guide and
[41:18] teach by the holy spirit that god is
[41:21] sent
[41:21] to teach us amen he
[41:25] that had an ear to hear
[41:28] what the spirit said on to the churches
[41:32] i'm starting to wind this up and i want
[41:35] to re-emphasize
[41:38] this ability god-given ability
[41:41] not man-given not man's
[41:45] knowledge human knowledge is just an
[41:48] accumulation of the six
[41:50] thousand years of human uh humans being
[41:53] on the earth and that knowledge being
[41:55] collected put into universities colleges
[41:58] encyclopedias and books and and then we
[42:01] go back and cram
[42:02] our minds with that and we call that
[42:04] knowledge and it is knowledge but that's
[42:06] just human knowledge
[42:07] that's the knowledge accumulated by the
[42:10] five
[42:11] senses and that is limited knowledge
[42:14] which they're still experimenting
[42:16] searching
[42:16] trying to find knowledge but god by the
[42:19] holy spirit
[42:21] is allowing his sons and daughters
[42:24] to tap into his knowledge the two kinds
[42:28] of knowledge
[42:29] sense knowledge knowledge coming from
[42:31] the senses
[42:32] and revelation knowledge you don't even
[42:35] know how you got it
[42:36] but it's just you just know because it's
[42:39] being revealed to you
[42:40] by the blessed holy spirit thank god
[42:44] it's not dead not since the days of the
[42:46] apostles
[42:47] not since the days of jesus it's not
[42:50] gone
[42:50] and we they did not need a school for it
[42:53] they did not need a
[42:55] denomination for it they needed jesus
[42:58] christ to reveal himself by the anointed
[43:01] word of god to them
[43:02] amen if you if you're a christian you
[43:05] will
[43:06] get it you will get what the spirit of
[43:08] god
[43:10] is teaching and what the spirit of god
[43:12] is
[43:13] saying to your age in which
[43:16] you live the cry of the holy spirit my
[43:19] friend
[43:20] is always don't leave the word
[43:25] that's a rebuke to the age don't leave
[43:28] the word don't swerve from the word
[43:30] stay with god's word of god
[43:33] hold to god's unchanging hand the cry of
[43:37] the holy spirit the rebuke to the age
[43:40] and at the same time this remedy for
[43:43] anyone who was turned from the word
[43:46] diverted swayed or bypassed the word
[43:50] is back to the word of god if you want
[43:53] to retain
[43:54] god's favor god's love god's anointing
[43:58] and god's blessing on your life your
[44:01] walk your growth
[44:02] in him the scabs from your eyes
[44:06] for like us like a baby they don't
[44:10] they don't just be born and their eyes
[44:12] are clear yeah
[44:13] the days pass you can see that
[44:17] whether it be in a puppy or some other
[44:20] animal
[44:21] pass and then the film constantly go
[44:24] from you amen seeing through a glass
[44:27] darkly
[44:28] but then god reveals and you begin to
[44:31] see
[44:31] you begin to recognize you begin to know
[44:34] what god is saying to the age in which
[44:38] we are living hallelujah but my friends
[44:43] it's getting darker and darker
[44:46] and now we are in the last church age
[44:49] revelation
[44:50] chapter 3 speaking of the odyssey and
[44:53] church age
[44:54] lukewarm wretched
[44:58] miserable naked blind undressing in the
[45:02] streets
[45:03] my god hallelujah god have mercy
[45:07] oh let's let's just let me leave that
[45:10] alone for now
[45:12] but we're living in the laodicean church
[45:14] age that
[45:15] lies era
[45:18] and a spiritual blackout
[45:22] is right now upon us
[45:25] where the people can hardly recognize
[45:28] the word of god
[45:30] but in the darkness the word says
[45:34] there shall come a day that is not
[45:37] dark nor light but at evening time
[45:42] it shall be light thank god hallelujah
[45:45] that is light coming again and the light
[45:48] comes from god
[45:50] and god himself
[45:53] is revealing himself by his word
[45:56] heavenly sunshine
[45:58] heavenly sunshine flooding my
[46:01] soul with the glory divine
[46:05] heavenly sunshine heavenly sunshine
[46:10] hallelujah jesus
[46:13] is mine it is my earnest prayer here
[46:17] today
[46:18] that we may all hear if god has given us
[46:21] an
[46:22] heir to hear may we hear what the spirit
[46:25] of god
[46:26] is bringing to us here by the
[46:29] by the air of the holy spirit
[46:33] what he is saying to us and surrender
[46:36] ourselves to him
[46:38] repent of our sins turn back
[46:42] from the lifestyle you were living
[46:46] and follow the lord jesus christ
[46:50] by the guidance of the word of god
[46:54] may god help every one of us as we come
[46:57] to the waters of baptism
