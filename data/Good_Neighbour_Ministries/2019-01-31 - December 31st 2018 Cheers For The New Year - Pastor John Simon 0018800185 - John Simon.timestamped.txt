[9:35] [Music]
[9:44] this came to me see and was very very

[9:53] point
[9:59] [Music]
[10:10] [Music]
[10:16] [Music]
[10:29] [Music]
[10:39] [Music]
[10:50] so after that we went to Harvard
[10:55] now this doctor is very very good
[11:01] [Music]
[11:08] [Music]
[11:23] [Music]
[11:38] two weeks no I
[11:51] [Music]
[12:07] I was
[12:39] [Music]
[12:48] [Applause]
[12:53] [Music]
[13:15] [Applause]
[13:21] you know danny has a song for us as well
[14:03] [Music]
[14:26] [Music]
[14:47] [Music]
[14:53] let's just-okay we do another ze one of
[15:07] the big dancer hardy is one of the best
[15:13] I said for 24 years I've been going to
[15:17] church we have a service and we go into
[15:24] the new year together and you know it's
[15:26] it's it's tremendous because we get you
[15:29] know opportunities to sing do specials
[15:33] and you know we've got a band that gets
[15:37] up there testimonies of people talk
[15:40] about what God did for them that year
[15:43] and how wonderful the Lord is and that's
[15:49] cool because that's our life you know
[15:55] you know I could sit here testimony
[15:58] after testimony you know I believe 2018
[16:01] was one of the greatest years ever for
[16:05] my wife
[16:12] because you know we had the best
[16:14] financial year in 24 years
[16:17] I'm not saying it because of that what
[16:19] we did this is a grace enough I'm not
[16:23] saying it because you know were still
[16:25] help being strong I've seen it because
[16:28] our walk with the Lord
[16:30] through thick and thin has gotten closer
[16:34] the event that's coming greater has got
[16:37] more supernatural because this walk is a
[16:41] supernatural block there's nothing
[16:43] ordinary about Saints and all I can say
[16:47] is you know right up until yesterday but
[16:50] I can give you testimony after testimony
[16:52] of what God did just in the last year
[16:56] but I can't remember I can't I can't
[17:00] remember them all because they have to
[17:02] almost every day because this is a
[17:05] supernatural if you're walking with God
[17:08] ladies you know where does Jesus Christ
[17:11] right now he's in his word he said an
[17:15] investment to the album and like I
[17:16] always tell people I solicited because
[17:19] you were on the earth when Christ was
[17:21] here back 2,000 years ago would you
[17:24] recognize them
[17:25] just think about would you breath or
[17:27] would you you know be looking at him as
[17:29] a as a heretic you know how you look at
[17:32] me right now
[17:33] the way I'm talking about the Lord you
[17:37] haven't heard something talked about God
[17:38] the way I talk
[17:40] we haven't then we know that there's
[17:44] definitely something different and I
[17:46] said you better believe me because
[17:55] sometimes you know sons come along and
[17:58] they and they strike your heart and this
[18:01] is one of the songs that you know that
[18:02] struck me is saying a couple songs to a
[18:04] man and this was one that that struck me
[18:09] it's called different because you know
[18:12] if there's anything that that we do want
[18:14] is we want to be different we want to
[18:19] continue to change and that's what makes
[18:22] you different as the world goes on
[18:25] things are happening things are always
[18:27] changing or slower we live upon line
[18:31] precept upon precept were being changed
[18:34] amen praise God

[22:20] you know one of the things that that
[22:23] holds us back a lot of times in
[22:27] achieving victory in our lives and
[22:31] moving forward is this thing called feud
[22:35] it's you know if you look at the word
[22:38] fear its faults evidence and it appears
[22:40] and I don't know what you Saints but
[22:42] this is this is a season or Satan is
[22:46] trying to put so much fear on the people
[22:48] that we really looked there's horror
[22:50] movies there's you know it's it's
[22:52] constantly trying to bring fear bring
[22:55] fear into control the minds of the
[22:57] people but you know what fear does not
[23:01] live you as a son or daughter of dog you
[23:09] should be able to know that God is on
[23:10] our side and he said all things are
[23:13] possible
[23:14] there's nothing wonderful thing that
[23:15] should stand in your way as a son or
[23:18] daughter hallelujah amen throne so I'm
[23:21] gonna sing this song is another song is
[23:23] called fear he is a vibrant amen amen
[23:27] so what feared comes and those thoughts
[23:31] tell me on the greatest battle ever
[23:33] fought you just say Satan you're a liar
[23:36] and a liar from the beginning there's
[23:39] only one fear that's the fear of God and
[23:42] to know him in the power of his
[23:44] resurrection

[42:41] meetings there was moving so I was very
[42:45] blessed with parents I was born eight of
[42:49] nine children when parents had to
[42:53] separate families I would say there was
[42:55] two children that didn't survive agency
[42:58] between the older flora and the number
[43:00] three
[43:01] so I technically was the oldest girl at
[43:04] home so guess what everybody's
[43:08] responsibility was so my dad was a
[43:12] deacon in the church near as big so
[43:14] there was great expectations you're
[43:21] expected to total behind
[43:23] responsibilities there was no
[43:25] negotiation my older siblings my parents
[43:30] were Christians we eventually went into
[43:40] Pentecost
[43:49] in tongues and my dad said anyway I can
[43:57] remember as a child my dad going for
[44:00] fast 20-day dots he would be the home go
[44:05] to captain woods and he would say forty
[44:08] days but anyway with the church because
[44:24] they were in many cost and there was a
[44:26] eleven year difference between the older
[44:28] siblings and the younger group my older
[44:32] siblings were not Christian when when
[44:34] parents come into Pentecost they do not
[44:39] adjust very well so they went to live
[44:43] with my aunt
[44:45] military my older sisters went to the
[44:47] pylon so I grew up not knowing my older
[44:51] siblings at all we saw them twice a year
[44:54] sometimes we Mother's Day Father's Day
[44:56] they show up creating kicked my parents
[44:58] and at Christmas time they would show up
[45:00] again bring this for us we thought that
[45:02] was fantastic
[45:04] so they were like uncles and aunts
[45:07] so as my dad was a deacon we had church
[45:10] several times with me twice on Sunday
[45:13] Tuesday night firstly and Saturday night
[45:18] because people live within like a
[45:20] 30-mile radius and anybody that traveled
[45:24] from a fair distance usually ended up at
[45:27] our house between services on Sundays so
[45:29] we had to prepare there at least 20 plus
[45:33] so every Saturday was spent thank you
[45:37] cookies eggs preparing food and we
[45:45] [Music]
[45:53] it was our Saturday morning Washington
[46:35] we were in the kitchen baking for Sunday
[46:40] March Break for spent going to my
[46:44] grandparents place staining to the
[46:47] wallpaper even as a child I guess you
[46:55] could say I had family she's built for
[46:57] responsibility maturity like fast it was
[47:05] [Music]
[47:12] was a physical activity skating they all
[47:17] go separation is just the church family
[47:22] was the family there was no connection
[47:24] with other family members basically grew
[47:27] up
