[11:57] [Applause]
[12:00] today.
[12:02] Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[12:05] Amen. Now, now that is the fact. And if
[12:08] you want to believe something different
[12:09] this morning, that's your
[12:12] problem. But you don't have to believe
[12:15] un have unbelief. You can just say,
[12:17] "Victory indeed is mine. It don't matter
[12:19] how I feel. It don't matter the
[12:22] circumstances. Victory is mine. Not
[12:25] because of my strength, not because of
[12:27] my prayer life, not because of any, but
[12:30] because he's here and I belong to him. I
[12:34] don't you know brother sister I I don't
[12:35] know how I how I belong to him. I don't
[12:38] know why why I belong to him but all I
[12:41] know is that I belong to him you
[12:45] settled. Amen. Not worthy but the worthy
[12:48] one has made me worthy has made you
[12:50] worthy this morning. We ought to praise
[12:52] the Lord this morning. We ought to
[12:54] praise him. We ought to give him the
[12:56] glory. We ought to give him the praise.
[12:58] [Music]
[13:01] Hallelujah. We ought to uh be free this
[13:04] morning. We're free from uh as we've
[13:06] been hearing it from tradition. And
[13:08] we're free from co culture. Whether it's
[13:10] your natural culture or the message
[13:12] culture or the the rules and the
[13:15] regulations and all these things. We're
[13:18] free people. Praise God. Why are we
[13:20] free? Because he's come and made us
[13:22] free. He's lifted us higher. Amen.
[13:24] Praise is what? And again, praise the
[13:26] Lord. All his doing, we give him all the
[13:29] glory this morning. If you have a need
[13:31] this morning though because uh one of
[13:33] these days we're leaving here. But until
[13:35] then, my there is such
[13:39] turmoil. But we're trusting in the Lord.
[13:41] And blessed is the man that puts his
[13:43] trust in the Lord. Was on my coffee mug
[13:46] this morning. Praise God. And it is
[13:49] true. Um we're remembering brother
[13:51] Coffee. All right. Remember him? He had
[13:53] a little uh trouble this week. He was
[13:56] home and then he had a fall and and uh
[13:59] but he's He's in the hospital again, but
[14:01] everything is good. All is well. He's on
[14:04] the mend again. Um the devil is just
[14:06] trying to, how would you say, uh uh
[14:09] fight against the word that has gone
[14:12] forth that the brother is well. So
[14:16] that's good. Let him fight all he wants.
[14:18] Brother Coffee is on his on the men, but
[14:20] remember him in prayer. As the saints
[14:22] gather around, fire some some bullets in
[14:25] the direction of that old devil and say,
[14:28] "Satan, hands off. Hands off." And it
[14:32] matters to you because he's part of the
[14:35] body.
[14:36] Amen. Psalmist said,
[14:39] um, I read it this
[14:42] morning. Oh, may not be able. Oh, here
[14:45] it is. He said,"I will sing unto the
[14:47] Lord as long as I live. I will sing
[14:51] praise to my God while I have
[14:56] being. And my meditation of him shall be
[14:59] sweet. Shall not be judgment. Shall not
[15:01] be any shall be sweet. I will be glad in
[15:04] the Lord." How many are glad in the
[15:06] Lord? Hallelujah. Someone say,
[15:09] "Hallelujah." Hallelujah. F please. I
[15:12] sing praises to your
[15:15] [Music]
[15:16] name, oh
[15:19] Lord. Praises to your
[15:23] [Music]
[15:24] name.
[15:26] Hallelujah. For your name is
[15:30] great and
[15:31] greatly to be praised.
[15:38] I sing praises to your
[15:42] name, oh
[15:44] Lord, praises to your
[15:48] [Music]
[15:52] name, for your name is
[15:55] great and
[15:57] [Music]

[16:08] name, oh
[16:10] Lord. Glory to your
[16:14] name, oh
[16:17] Lord, for your name is great.

[16:56] worship to your
[16:59] name, oh Lord. We worship for
[17:05] you, oh
[17:08] Lord, for your name is

[18:00] name, to exalt thee, to give you all the
[18:03] glory and the honor because you alone is
[18:06] worthy to receive and to open that back.
[18:09] There the cry went out there's no one

[18:24] the name of Jesus. We are here with one
[18:27] purpose in our heart to lift up the name
[18:29] of Jesus Christ on high to let everybody
[18:32] know that our Lord is good. We thank you
[18:34] and we love you and we appreciate you
[18:37] from the bottom of our heart. We say

[24:49] that we're not going to struggle,
[24:50] brother Phil. Doesn't mean you're not
[24:53] going to fight. But in the end, how many
[24:56] have noticed that in the end, the word
[24:58] always wins?
[25:02] If I'm speaking to somebody this

[25:59] to encourage somebody. Even if you

[30:18] Glory. Glory. Hallelujah. You
[30:21] know, I I had a good week this week. How
[30:24] many had a good week this week? Doesn't
[30:26] mean you didn't have troubles and
[30:27] trials, but um in the financial sense,
[30:32] he saved me a ton of money. Praise God.
[30:35] Not once, but twice this week. Twice in
[30:37] one week, he saved me a pile of money. I
[30:40] just thought, praise God. He knows how
[30:43] to do it real fine. But I find the
[30:45] windows of heaven are open. I find the
[30:48] blessings are falling. Praise God. And
[30:50] what are we to do? Stand to our feet.
[30:52] Hallelujah. Amen. Stand to your
[30:55] feet. Be flattered.
[30:59] And we're to worship the King of Kings
[31:01] and the Lord of Lords and thank him for
[31:03] his goodness. Of it all.
[31:05] Hallelujah. When I look into your
[31:12] holiness, and when I gaze into your love

[36:09] our soul.
[36:12] [Music]
[36:19] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. And there
[36:21] may
[36:23] I there may
[36:25] I But he washed all my sins away.
[36:29] Hallelujah. The precious blood shall
[36:32] never lose its power.
[36:35] never lose his power to all the church,
[36:38] the bride of Jesus Christ, be saved to
[36:41] sin no more. And that will be when we're
[36:44] out of here. Amen. In the body change,
[36:47] we have power this morning. Power in the
[36:50] blood. Amen. Hallelujah. We want to tap
[36:52] into that. God bless you, saints. We
[36:55] want to tap into that this morning.
[36:56] Amen. The unseen presence of God.
[37:00] Hallelujah. That's what we come for.
[37:03] Amen. We come not to be seen, right? We
[37:08] come to connect with him. But you're
[37:11] already connecting with him. Amen. Your
[37:15] life, Amen, is is a living epistle read
[37:19] of all men. You're constantly in
[37:22] fellowship because the father is inside
[37:24] of you. The spirit of revelation is
[37:26] inside of you. It doesn't leave you when
[37:29] you leave this building. It's
[37:31] communicating with you. It's dealing
[37:33] with you. It's changing with you. It
[37:35] does more work outside this church than
[37:37] it does inside this church. Amen. But we
[37:39] come this morning, Amen, as another uh h
[37:44] vehicle that God can use this morning to
[37:48] speak to our hearts. Amen. Sometimes we
[37:51] we have things in our hearts that, you
[37:54] know, uh we could hide and we can
[37:57] ignore. We can get busy in life and
[38:00] things could happen. Amen. And we don't
[38:02] get in contact with that still small
[38:05] voice and we come in here that the Holy
[38:09] Spirit may speak. Amen. Not brother
[38:11] Tim, not my voice that you're hearing
[38:14] over the microphone, but his voice.
[38:16] Amen. Hallelujah.
[38:19] Have you ever been there when the Holy
[38:20] Ghost is speaking to you? Sometimes I
[38:23] feel like I'm the only one. I'm exposed.
[38:25] Amen. When the word is coming forth. May
[38:27] that happen this morning. May the Holy
[38:29] Spirit speak to our hearts this morning.
[38:32] Amen. The letter killed, but the spirit
[38:34] gives it life. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[38:38] Glory to God. We're good to be here this
[38:42] morning. Everything is good. God is
[38:45] good.
[38:47] Amen. And everything is good with us. I
[38:50] don't care what you're going through,
[38:52] what
[38:53] circumstances, everything is good. Amen.
[38:56] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[39:00] Amen. Let us turn to the word this
[39:02] morning. I was preparing a
[39:05] message and I had it
[39:07] done and I went downstairs last night
[39:11] and all of a sudden everything
[39:13] changed. My wife is going, "Why are you
[39:16] going back upstairs? You were just up
[39:18] there for most of the day." I got to go
[39:20] upstairs. Everything changed again.
[39:22] Right. So, I don't know. It's not
[39:25] finished. I don't know why it changed,
[39:28] but God knows why it changed. Amen.
[39:31] Hallelujah. So, we want to go to Hebrews
[39:34] 10:19, Colossians 3:1, Philippians
[39:38] 3:13. And my title this morning is this.
[39:42] This third pull
[39:46] manifestation brings us to a higher
[39:50] ground. All that came to me was higher
[39:53] ground. Amen.
[39:55] We must go to higher ground. That's the
[39:58] only purpose why we're here is to go to
[40:01] higher ground. Amen. We want to get so
[40:04] high in the revelation of the word of
[40:06] God that is going to change our bodies.
[40:08] Amen. Hallelujah. Hebrews
[40:12] 10:19. You pray for
[40:15] me. You operate your faith because faith
[40:18] operates the gift.
[40:21] So, you're going to operate the gift
[40:24] this morning. If you're looking to me,
[40:27] then you're looking the wrong direction.
[40:29] Look to yourself. You're going to
[40:30] operate the gift this morning. All I
[40:33] have to do is yield myself and you
[40:35] operate the gift. And what you come to
[40:37] expect, what your faith is expecting
[40:39] this morning, you'll
[40:41] receive. If your faith is not expecting
[40:44] anything, you're not going to receive
[40:45] nothing. Hallelujah. Amen. That's the
[40:48] way it is, my brothers and sisters.
[40:50] Hallelujah. Hebrews
[40:52] 10:19. Having therefore, brethren,
[40:57] boldness to enter into the holiest by
[41:01] the blood of
[41:02] Jesus, by a new and living way which he
[41:06] has consecrated for
[41:08] us through the veil, that is to say, his
[41:13] flesh, and having a high priest over the
[41:16] house of God. This is the high pri. This
[41:19] is the house of God right here. We got a
[41:21] high priest over the house of God. Amen.
[41:24] Let us draw near with a true heart in
[41:29] full assurance of
[41:31] faith, having our hearts sprinkled from
[41:34] an evil conscience, and our bodies
[41:36] washed with pure
[41:38] water. Let us hold fast the profession
[41:42] of our
[41:43] faith without wavering.
[41:47] For he is faithful that promised. Amen.
[41:51] Let us turn to Colossians
[41:54] 3:1. Amen. Man, this word of God is so
[42:00] rich. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Colossians
[42:04] 3:1. If ye then be risen with
[42:09] Christ,
[42:11] seek seek those things which are above.
[42:16] where Christ siteth on the right hand of
[42:20] God. Set your affections on things
[42:25] above, not on things of the
[42:28] earth. For ye are
[42:32] dead. Wow. We're
[42:36] dead. And your life is hid with Christ
[42:40] in God. When Christ who is our life
[42:44] shall appear, then shall ye also appear
[42:49] with him in glory. Hallelujah.
[42:53] Philippians
[42:55] 3:13. We are dead. Brother Brham said
[42:58] that
[42:59] corpse, you know, you go up to a corpse
[43:01] and you hit it, you say what you want to
[43:03] it, it doesn't
[43:06] react. It doesn't move. It has no
[43:09] feelings. Has no emotion. He's totally
[43:12] dead. He and the Bible says we are
[43:16] dead. There's nothing of the
[43:20] world. Philippians 3:13, "Brethren, I
[43:24] count not myself to have apprehend
[43:27] it, but this one thing I do, forget in
[43:31] those things which are behind, and
[43:34] reaching forth unto those things which
[43:37] are before.
[43:38] I press towards the mark for the prize
[43:42] of the high calling of God in Christ
[43:46] Jesus. Oh, we press forward. Amen. I'm
[43:50] pressing on to higher ground. Amen.
[43:53] Hallelujah. Is that your desire this
[43:55] morning? Is that your hunger and your
[43:57] thirst to press higher? Amen.
[44:02] Hallelujah. Let us pray.
[44:06] Father, Lord Jesus, we come before your
[44:10] throne, oh
[44:13] God,
[44:17] not of ourselves, Father, not worthy of
[44:20] ourselves, not able to do anything,
[44:23] Lord. But we come this morning, Lord,
[44:26] both speaker and hearer, to get out of
[44:28] the way, Father, that the Holy Ghost may
[44:32] come
[44:32] now. You have placed the word with
[44:35] inside of us. You place gifts with
[44:37] inside of us. You place faith with
[44:39] inside of us, Lord. Now may the one who
[44:44] have given us this blessed
[44:47] assurance come and operate this morning,
[44:50] Lord. Lord, that we may hear the word of
[44:54] God and that our hearts may burn within
[44:57] us, oh God. Lord, we have nothing within
[45:00] ourselves. We can do
[45:03] nothing, but we can do all things
[45:05] through Christ who strengthens us this
[45:08] morning. Father, come Lord Jesus and
[45:11] manifest yourself. Lord, we surrender
[45:14] ourselves. bind every contrary spirit,
[45:16] every unbelieving spirit, Father, that
[45:19] would hinder the Holy Ghost from having
[45:21] the preeminence this morning. Lord, I
[45:23] commit myself to thee,
[45:25] Father. I commit the word to you, the
[45:29] people to you.
[45:31] Now, we take no thought what we would
[45:34] say, but in that hour, your heavenly
[45:38] father will speak through you. Come and
[45:41] honor your word now, Father, in Jesus
[45:43] Christ's name we pray. Amen. God bless
[45:46] you as you're seated. Hallelujah. By
[45:50] faith. You don't realize, my brothers
[45:52] and sisters, that
[45:56] um a minister walks up here by faith. He
[46:00] prepares a message. I got a message
[46:02] prepared here, but that ain't
[46:06] nothing. A minister walks up here by
[46:08] faith. Believe in
[46:11] God. Hallelujah.
[46:14] Because what you have need of in this
[46:17] hour is not just a regular church.
[46:20] There's many churches along the strip
[46:22] here everywhere and they're preaching
[46:25] their sermons this
[46:28] morning. But what we have need of this
[46:30] morning can't not come from
[46:33] man. This is a word that has been given
[46:36] through a real prophet in these last
[46:39] days. Allelujah. a perfect faith word, a
[46:44] perfect manifestation of Christ himself.
[46:48] Amen. And only he himself can come and
[46:53] bring us to the another level and bring
[46:56] us higher this morning. Hallelujah. Only
[47:00] he can lift our faith this morning. He
[47:03] is the one that started the work. He's
[47:06] the one that is doing the work. And he
[47:09] is the one that's going to finish the
[47:10] work in us. And that work is perfect
[47:13] faith. Amen. Bringing us to a perfect
[47:17] realization of who we are in this
[47:20] hour.
[47:22] Hallelujah. Amen.
[47:26] You know, I I was I was like I said,
[47:30] everything
[47:32] changed for
[47:34] me and I came across and it's been on my
[47:37] heart for a while. The high
[47:40] calling. I believe there's no greater
[47:42] high calling than what we got. The bride
[47:46] of Jesus Christ, Amen, is sitting in a
[47:49] position, the highest position that is
[47:53] on this earth today.
[47:56] Hallelujah. There is no higher position
[47:59] that is given out to man or woman in
[48:02] this hour than this high calling.
[48:06] But this high calling comes with a
[48:08] price.
[48:10] Hallelujah. Amen. This high calling
[48:13] don't mix with anything. Just like the
[48:16] word of God can't mix with nothing.
[48:19] Hallelujah. That's why when we come into
[48:21] the house of God, I don't know about all
[48:23] these other churches. Amen. But when we
[48:25] come into a true house of God where the
[48:28] true word is being preached, this is the
[48:30] judgment house. Amen. This is the
[48:33] judgment seat where we're sitting this
[48:36] morning. I'm not going to judge you.
[48:39] Amen. But the word of God, Amen. Jesus
[48:43] Christ himself is here to judge us.
[48:46] Amen. And this is the time that we're
[48:49] being judged because over there there is
[48:52] no judgment for the bride of Jesus
[48:54] Christ. She's going to receive all her
[48:56] judgment. Amen. And this morning, you're
[48:59] going to receive your judgment this
[49:00] morning. Hallelujah. You're going to
[49:03] receive it. You're going to accept it.
[49:05] Amen. And you're going to let the Holy
[49:07] Ghost and the work of God be done in
[49:09] your life. This high calling is a great
[49:13] calling. Is a great sacrifice. Amen.
[49:16] Hallelujah. And and as the scripture
[49:19] says, we are
[49:20] dead. Amen. And Paul says, "I die
[49:24] daily." This is a a death that's taken
[49:27] place. And you wonder why the word of
[49:29] God comes forth and it it shaves things
[49:32] off of your life. It it it hits things
[49:35] off of your life. Even the good things
[49:38] of life, the good pleasures of life, the
[49:42] word of God comes and speaks right into
[49:44] your heart and wants to shave those
[49:46] things off and cut those things off of
[49:48] your life because God is molding and
[49:52] shaping you. And that's what's taking
[49:54] place, my brothers and sisters. And
[49:57] those who will come out of the other
[49:58] side into the rapture into this
[50:01] perfection, amen, are those that are
[50:04] predestinated that had the seed of God
[50:06] that can accept the word of God. Amen.
[50:09] Accept the judgments of God, accept the
[50:12] word of God that's coming forth in their
[50:14] lives that has molded them and shaping
[50:16] them. Not everybody
[50:19] can. Not everybody can take this word of
[50:22] God and apply it to their lives. Not
[50:25] everybody can take this word of God and
[50:27] put it into their hearts. Amen. And let
[50:30] it have the preeminence and let God rule
[50:34] and control
[50:35] them. Not
[50:37] everybody, Amen, cannot lean to their
[50:40] own understanding and their own ways and
[50:43] die out to all those things. You think
[50:46] it's easy to die out to
[50:49] yourself? If you're playing religion and
[50:52] you're playing church and you're playing
[50:55] message
[50:56] believer, then it's
[50:58] okay. It's not too
[51:01] hard. Amen. Then the spirit say, because
[51:05] thou has chosen the harder way, you have
[51:09] chosen my way. That is my way to go the
[51:12] harder way. It's always been the harder
[51:15] way, my brothers and sisters.
[51:17] Hallelujah. And here we are at the end
[51:21] time. Here we are, my brothers and
[51:24] sisters in
[51:26] 2025. Prophecies being fulfilled out
[51:29] there in the world. Things coming into a
[51:32] place that we have read in in the
[51:35] message of the hour. Prophecies that we
[51:38] have seen come to pass in in in the
[51:41] message of the hour. The pope coming out
[51:43] of America prophesied when that will
[51:46] happen. Then then the mark of the beast
[51:49] which we we already know through a
[51:51] prophet is here. But then it will come
[51:53] into action. Then it will come into
[51:56] manifestation. And if that is right here
[51:59] right now, then where is the bride of
[52:02] Jesus Christ? Amen. I'm not talking
[52:05] about the message and and believers all
[52:07] around the world. I'm talking about the
[52:10] bride who's coming out of the message.
[52:12] Who's coming out of all these churches
[52:14] around the message? the bride of Jesus
[52:17] Christ that that particular life
[52:21] peculiar life that life that is being
[52:24] dealt with with God. Amen. Now listen.
[52:29] Hallelujah. I'm just going as the spirit
[52:31] will lead
[52:33] me. If God has called
[52:36] you to be really like Jesus
[52:41] Christ in all your
[52:45] spirit, not just part of your
[52:48] spirit. This ain't a part
[52:50] religion. This ain't a part surrender to
[52:54] God. I'll give God this part and that
[52:57] part of my heart, this part of my life
[52:59] and that part of my life. No. No. God
[53:03] don't mess around with that. Either you
[53:06] come full surrender to God. Maybe you
[53:09] can't or you don't know how to surrender
[53:11] everything. But when a heart comes to a
[53:14] place, Lord, take my life, take my
[53:18] heart, take
[53:19] everything, then that's a different
[53:21] story, my brothers and sisters.
[53:25] If he has really called you in all your
[53:30] spirit and that's a big thing right
[53:33] there,
[53:36] traditions,
[53:38] culture, my
[53:40] ways, who I am, my
[53:44] personality. This is the way I do
[53:46] things. This is the way I deal with
[53:48] things. I say things. But if God has
[53:52] really called you in all your
[53:56] spirit, he will draw you
[53:59] in to a life of
[54:04] crucifixion. It's not a life of
[54:06] pleasure. It's not a life of patting you
[54:09] on the back. It's a life of crucifixion,
[54:13] my brothers and sisters.
[54:15] It's a it's a death that's taking
[54:18] place constantly in your spirit dying
[54:22] out so that when you die more and you
[54:26] empty more, he fills more.
[54:29] Everybody wants to be filled with the
[54:31] Holy Ghost, but nobody wants to die out
[54:34] to
[54:34] themselves. Everybody wants the word of
[54:37] God to manifest through their lives and
[54:40] the power of God to manifest through
[54:42] their life and through their prayer
[54:43] life. But nobody wants to consecrate.
[54:46] Nobody wants to dedicate. Nobody wants
[54:49] to surrender their lives to the Lord
[54:50] Jesus
[54:52] Christ.
[54:55] Hallelujah.
[54:57] Amen. A life of crucifixion and
[55:02] humility.
[55:04] Humility. He will humble
[55:08] you. He knows how to humble you. Make
[55:12] you like nothing.
[55:16] You think he wants to lift you
[55:18] up. You think he wants to make you
[55:22] popular. He You think he wants to give
[55:24] you a big name above all
[55:27] names? We see it taking
[55:31] place. That's not what he said. But
[55:34] he'll keep you small and humble. He'll
[55:37] let other people do the work that you
[55:39] get the credit for the work that you're
[55:41] doing.
[55:43] so that Lord so that in the shade he can
[55:46] produce fruit. He knows how to hide us
[55:50] away. He knows what's best for our
[55:53] lives. We might think we want this and
[55:56] we're praying for this and that, but he
[55:58] knows what's best for
[55:59] us. He has a purpose in our lives. He
[56:03] has a portion of word. He said, "My word
[56:05] won't return void, but it will
[56:08] accomplish." He'll turn the world upside
[56:10] down. So that portion of that word
[56:12] inside of you can accomplish and bring
[56:15] forth because it's
[56:17] him. He can't deny
[56:20] himself.
[56:22] Hallelujah. He is swore by himself.
[56:25] Everything is by himself. Everything is
[56:28] in and through
[56:29] Christ. Do we understand what I'm saying
[56:33] here? Hallelujah. Or is it just words?
[56:37] Hallelujah.
[56:39] He'll put such strict
[56:43] demands of
[56:47] obedience such strict demands of
[56:50] obedience upon your
[56:52] life. Not when you want to
[56:54] obey. Not when it's convenient for you
[56:57] to
[57:00] obey. No. But he'll put that strict
[57:03] demand of obedience upon you. Is the
[57:07] Holy Ghost dealing with your life in
[57:09] this
[57:10] form? As we read the word, as we go
[57:13] through it, I hope you find yourself in
[57:17] this place with God that the Holy Spirit
[57:20] is dealing with your
[57:22] life in this way. If not, you need to
[57:26] get praying because the hour is late.
[57:29] Hallelujah. to know where you stand, to
[57:32] know who you are, to know that you are
[57:34] in that capstone, that you are in that
[57:37] rapture.
[57:38] Amen. I don't want to be in a place
[57:41] where I don't know. This is the hour
[57:44] where God has given the revelation that
[57:47] we will know. Amen. The bride will know
[57:50] who she is. She will recognize who he is
[57:54] and who she is in this hour. That's the
[57:57] place I want to be in. But that place
[58:00] doesn't come easy. Amen. With
[58:04] Christ. It's the harder
[58:08] way. I'll put strict demands of
[58:11] obedience upon
[58:13] you. God demands respect. God demands
[58:18] obedience to his people. Hallelujah.
[58:25] that he will not allow you to follow
[58:28] other
[58:30] Christians. No way. Not to a true son
[58:33] and daughter of
[58:35] God. And every
[58:37] way that is so wrong. Every
[58:41] way because we are
[58:44] individuals. God deals with us as
[58:46] individuals.
[58:47] the way God moves and the spirit moves
[58:50] in my life and he deals with me because
[58:52] I have a character. I have a
[58:55] personality. I have weaknesses and I
[58:57] have flaws and God knows how to deal
[59:00] with those better than I know how to
[59:03] deal with them. Frankly, I don't know
[59:05] really how to deal with them. I just
[59:07] surrender my life to him and let him
[59:09] deal with them. Hallelujah. Sometimes I
[59:12] say, "Ouch." I say, "Lord, it hurts.
[59:16] Lord, I'm waiting. How long? How long
[59:19] must I suffer these things? Amen. But I
[59:22] trust and believe. I've seen him over
[59:24] the last 33 years bring me through so
[59:27] many things. Amen. And take so many bad
[59:31] and ugly things in myself and make it
[59:34] work for my good. Amen. And turn it for
[59:36] my good. Amen. Was it easy? No, it
[59:39] wasn't easy. It was the harder way.
[59:43] Hallelujah. A rebuke from the Lord is
[59:46] not easy. My brothers and sisters, it
[59:48] breaks you sometimes. It breaks your
[59:51] spirit. Hallelujah. It can break your
[59:54] heart sometimes. A rebuke from the Lord.
[59:57] But then it molds you. It shapes you. It
[1:00:01] builds you back up. Amen. It
[1:00:03] restrengthens you. God doesn't only a a
[1:00:07] surgeon that cuts, but he heals. Amen.
[1:00:10] And he makes you better than you were
[1:00:12] before. Sometimes you get surgery out
[1:00:14] there. Hallelujah. the best doctors, the
[1:00:17] best surgeons. I've been through it.
[1:00:19] Amen. Major surgery. And sometimes they
[1:00:22] do their best they can and it doesn't
[1:00:24] turn out the way it's supposed to be.
[1:00:26] Amen. But when God does surgery on us,
[1:00:29] oh hallelujah. God's hands goes into us.
[1:00:33] Amen. We're not we're we're not worse
[1:00:36] than where we were before. We're not
[1:00:38] okay, but we are better. Amen.
[1:00:41] We are healed and we are totally
[1:00:43] delivered and we are totally changed and
[1:00:46] set free when he operates on us.
[1:00:51] Oh,
[1:00:54] hallelujah.
[1:00:58] Amen. He won't allow you to follow other
[1:01:02] Christians. In many
[1:01:05] ways, he will seem to let other good
[1:01:08] people do
[1:01:10] things which he will not let you
[1:01:15] do.
[1:01:17] Hallelujah. That's why, let
[1:01:20] me politefully say this. I don't care
[1:01:24] what you're
[1:01:25] doing. I don't care what you're doing in
[1:01:29] your life. That's your business. The
[1:01:31] Bible says, "Mind your own business. Do
[1:01:33] your own
[1:01:34] business." It's not in my business how
[1:01:38] God is dealing with your life. And I
[1:01:40] ain't going to take your business and
[1:01:42] how God is dealing with your life and
[1:01:44] apply it to my
[1:01:45] life because God is dealing with my life
[1:01:48] the way he does he deals with my life.
[1:01:50] And that's all I'm concerned about. I
[1:01:53] love
[1:01:54] you. I pray for
[1:01:56] you. Those who know me, which most of
[1:01:59] you do, you know my character. You know
[1:02:02] my ministry outside of standing here,
[1:02:05] but this I don't care about anything
[1:02:07] else but how what God is doing in my
[1:02:09] life. And I think if we mind our own
[1:02:12] business sometimes, Amen. It it would
[1:02:15] cut the spirit of gossip. Sometimes we
[1:02:17] don't realize I don't
[1:02:19] gossip. Oh, brother so and so, you know,
[1:02:22] this and that or sister so and so this.
[1:02:25] You know, just like Job, we still got
[1:02:27] those Job uh friends hanging around
[1:02:29] those Job believers, you know, his
[1:02:31] friends. Maybe maybe this happened to
[1:02:34] this person or this believer because
[1:02:36] there's secret sin. What is it any of
[1:02:39] your business even if there is secret
[1:02:40] sin
[1:02:41] there? Hallelujah. It's none of your
[1:02:44] business anyways.
[1:02:46] You pray for them. If you're discerning
[1:02:49] anything, if God has shown you anything,
[1:02:51] then he trustes you. And he trustes that
[1:02:53] you'll keep your mouth shut and you'll
[1:02:56] bring it into prayer and you'll hit that
[1:02:58] spirit and you'll pray for that brother
[1:03:00] and sister that they'll come out of that
[1:03:02] sin and be delivered from that sin.
[1:03:06] We don't realize when we open our
[1:03:07] mouths. Amen. We are we're supposed to
[1:03:10] be a family uh united together under the
[1:03:13] word of God here. That grace and
[1:03:14] atmosphere when we come together. But
[1:03:17] when we yap our mouths off in in outside
[1:03:20] of these walls and we bring it into
[1:03:22] here, you bring those spirits into here
[1:03:25] and you hinder the atmosphere of the
[1:03:27] word of God.
[1:03:31] My brothers and
[1:03:32] sisters, it's not good. It's a fearful
[1:03:36] thing to fall in the hands of
[1:03:39] God. Amen. That's why I said, "Touch not
[1:03:42] my oil. do my prophets and the ones that
[1:03:45] are anointed no
[1:03:47] harm. We need to have that
[1:03:50] respect. Amen. We have that kind of
[1:03:53] respect for one another and for God. God
[1:03:56] moves. Things happen. Things
[1:03:59] change. He's pleased. His spirit is
[1:04:02] pleased to come in the midst of people
[1:04:04] like that.
[1:04:07] Hallelujah.
[1:04:09] Amen. Amen. Sometimes we'll get blessed
[1:04:13] attractions. Oh, you know, they looked
[1:04:16] at
[1:04:18] Judas. Amen. When Judas went off to do
[1:04:21] what he was supposed to do, betrayed the
[1:04:24] other the other apostles didn't know it
[1:04:26] was
[1:04:27] Judas, they all said, "Is it I? Is it I?
[1:04:30] Is it I?" They were surprised it was
[1:04:33] Judas. Sometimes we're surprised. those
[1:04:37] who put a pious face
[1:04:40] on, religious
[1:04:44] faith. Oh, you might
[1:04:46] hide. Like I said, I'm just let being
[1:04:48] led by the Holy Spirit. You might hide,
[1:04:51] but the Holy Ghost
[1:04:53] knows. He knows you're naked before him.
[1:04:58] I would not dare come into the presence
[1:05:00] of God and before the minister of God
[1:05:03] that's speaking the word of God and not
[1:05:05] have my heart repented. I spend more
[1:05:08] time cleansing my heart so that I may
[1:05:11] come into his presence. You can't come
[1:05:13] into his presence. You can't enter into
[1:05:15] his presence with things in your heart.
[1:05:18] Things that you said, things that you
[1:05:20] done, things that you got to make right
[1:05:23] before
[1:05:24] God. You can't
[1:05:29] Hallelujah.
[1:05:32] Hallelujah. The Holy Spirit will put
[1:05:34] such strict watch on you with a jealous
[1:05:38] love and will rebuke you for little
[1:05:41] words. Some people still
[1:05:44] swearing. Believe in the message of of
[1:05:46] the
[1:05:47] hour. Cursing and
[1:05:50] swearing in many different forms and
[1:05:53] ways. putting the husband down, putting
[1:05:56] the wife down, degrading them in many
[1:06:00] different
[1:06:03] ways. But the Holy Ghost here says if
[1:06:06] you got the Holy Ghost, it will rebuke
[1:06:10] you for little words. That's not big
[1:06:12] words, little
[1:06:17] words. The apostles were men of few
[1:06:19] words.
[1:06:22] If you can't say something positive, you
[1:06:25] can't say something uplifting, you can't
[1:06:27] say something that's inspired by the
[1:06:29] Holy Ghost inside of you, don't say
[1:06:31] nothing at all. It's better just to keep
[1:06:33] it
[1:06:34] shut.
[1:06:36] Hallelujah. These are not in my notes.
[1:06:39] I'm just following what this Holy Spirit
[1:06:41] is doing.
[1:06:43] [Music]
[1:06:44] Hallelujah.
[1:06:45] Hallelujah. And
[1:06:48] feelings. Feelings.
[1:06:51] We keep
[1:06:53] feelings. Hallelujah. Little
[1:06:56] feelings. Sometimes things happen,
[1:07:00] things are
[1:07:02] said. Maybe maybe uh a a a a moment
[1:07:06] happens between you and a brother or
[1:07:08] sister or even some people at
[1:07:11] work. It's not only your brothers and
[1:07:13] sisters or your husband and your wife.
[1:07:16] People at
[1:07:17] work. Oh, it's okay for me to be racist
[1:07:21] against people out there at work because
[1:07:23] they are who they are, but against my
[1:07:25] brothers and sisters, Noah, it it's
[1:07:28] wrong. It's okay for me to feel this way
[1:07:32] about somebody out there because they're
[1:07:34] sinners and that's their nature and
[1:07:36] that's what they
[1:07:37] do. It's okay for me to feel these
[1:07:40] things and keep these spirits on
[1:07:42] me. But the Holy Ghost said it'll rebuke
[1:07:46] you for little words. It'll rebuke you
[1:07:48] for those little
[1:07:49] feelings. Listen, it's without spot.
[1:07:52] It's without wrinkle that God is
[1:07:55] preparing a bride in this
[1:07:58] hour.
[1:07:59] Hallelujah. He's preparing a bride. He's
[1:08:03] He's molded and shaping a bride. That's
[1:08:06] what this faith in this hour will
[1:08:11] do.
[1:08:14] Hallelujah.
[1:08:15] Amen. for wasting your
[1:08:19] time, wasting our
[1:08:22] time, being busy with so many things. I
[1:08:26] understand we got to clean our
[1:08:28] house. I understand we got to go to
[1:08:32] work, but
[1:08:34] oh busy. You come in the house of the
[1:08:37] Lord from the morning from even from
[1:08:40] Friday night prayer meeting. That's why
[1:08:42] I always say my brothers and sisters,
[1:08:44] keep it in prayer.
[1:08:47] Amen. You're you're doing the dishes
[1:08:49] Saturday. You're cutting the lawn
[1:08:51] Saturday, but you're praying. Amen.
[1:08:54] You're preparing your heart. Hallelujah.
[1:08:57] You don't go watch TV Saturday night.
[1:09:00] Watch your favorite program and then go
[1:09:03] to bed and say, "Father, bless the
[1:09:05] service and the speaker tomorrow and the
[1:09:07] song leader and just have your way and
[1:09:10] and speak to my heart.
[1:09:13] Where is the consecration gone in this
[1:09:16] hour? How many of us, Amen, spent the
[1:09:20] weekend with our mind on Christ, our
[1:09:23] mind on the word of God this morning?
[1:09:26] How many of us this morning are prepared
[1:09:29] to move into the presence of God?
[1:09:33] You don't come in here with busyness,
[1:09:36] with nothing, no consecration and
[1:09:38] dedication, no connection with God and
[1:09:42] expect to come in his presence. You come
[1:09:45] in here in his presence. You come in
[1:09:48] here speaking to him. You hear his voice
[1:09:51] before he you come into here. You're
[1:09:55] consecrated. You know your faith has
[1:09:58] gone to such a level that you're going
[1:10:00] to meet with him. Amen. And he's going
[1:10:02] to speak with your heart this morning.
[1:10:04] You know that you contribute to the
[1:10:07] service this morning. Your prayers, your
[1:10:09] consecration, maybe your little
[1:10:11] dedication of
[1:10:13] fasting. God sees it
[1:10:17] all. Well, God knows I'm
[1:10:20] busy. God knows I'm just going to say it
[1:10:23] plain. God knows I can't
[1:10:25] pray. God knows I can't prepare myself
[1:10:28] for service. But his grace is so
[1:10:32] sufficient for me that and he loves me
[1:10:36] so much. What kind of spirit is that?
[1:10:38] That's the spirit out there. He loves me
[1:10:40] so much that you know he's going to
[1:10:43] bless me. He's going to bless
[1:10:46] me.
[1:10:48] Hallelujah. Wasting your time which
[1:10:52] other Christians never seem distressed
[1:10:54] over. They
[1:10:56] don't. Hallelujah.
[1:10:59] distressed over not only wasting their
[1:11:01] time, it seems like they're not
[1:11:02] distressed over anything
[1:11:07] anymore. So, make up your
[1:11:11] mind. Make up your
[1:11:15] mind. Come to a place of
[1:11:18] decision. Are you going to be
[1:11:21] double-minded all your life?
[1:11:25] A double-minded person is unstable in
[1:11:29] all their ways. A person that can't make
[1:11:32] up their
[1:11:36] mind. Make up your
[1:11:40] mind what you want to do.
[1:11:43] If Christ this
[1:11:46] word be God, then serve him with all
[1:11:50] your heart, with all your mind, with all
[1:11:53] your soul, with all your strength, with
[1:11:55] everything that God's that's in with
[1:11:57] inside of you. Serve him. Now, you might
[1:12:00] not be at a place where you've given it
[1:12:02] all to him because he has to come and
[1:12:04] take it. But in your
[1:12:07] heart, you have made up your
[1:12:09] mind that Lord, come. Whatever it's
[1:12:12] going to take in my life, whatever
[1:12:15] you're going to have to put me through,
[1:12:17] I'm going through. Amen. I started out
[1:12:21] with Jesus and I am going through.
[1:12:26] Amen. I believe there's people right
[1:12:30] here today that have passed the point of
[1:12:32] no return. I believe they've already
[1:12:35] made up their mind. I believe they're
[1:12:38] going through I believe they've gone
[1:12:40] through that process and going through
[1:12:42] that process of surrendering their
[1:12:44] lives. And all that is happening is a
[1:12:46] more of a surrender, a more of a
[1:12:48] yielding, a more of the Holy Ghost in
[1:12:51] filling
[1:12:52] them. But listen, we got to catch those
[1:12:55] that are still in the fire. We are still
[1:12:58] here. And we got to preach the word of
[1:13:01] God like somebody's not in
[1:13:04] yet. Somebody hasn't made that
[1:13:07] decision.
[1:13:09] Hallelujah. So God can take a hold of
[1:13:12] their life.
[1:13:13] Amen.
[1:13:15] And breakthrough. You got to break
[1:13:17] through all the unbelief. The word of
[1:13:20] God has got to come forth and chop and
[1:13:22] break it
[1:13:23] all.
[1:13:25] Hallelujah. Maybe you've been
[1:13:28] indoctrinated.
[1:13:29] Maybe in your past you believe it a
[1:13:32] certain way to serve God a certain way
[1:13:36] but God is trying to show you no you got
[1:13:40] to come my way.
[1:13:43] Hallelujah. Make up your mind that God
[1:13:45] is infinite sovereign and he has a right
[1:13:47] to do as he please with his
[1:13:50] own. He has a right to do what he please
[1:13:53] with his own. Hallelujah.
[1:13:56] Oh
[1:13:57] no, no, you can't. You can't do that,
[1:14:02] Lord. You can't move in these areas,
[1:14:05] Lord.
[1:14:08] Hallelujah.
[1:14:10] Hallelujah. And he will not explain to
[1:14:13] you a thousand things that may puzzle
[1:14:15] your reasoning in his dealings with you.
[1:14:19] Oh, that's a big one.
[1:14:22] Most of our prayers are, Lord, why is
[1:14:25] this happening to me? Why am I going
[1:14:28] through all these things that I'm going
[1:14:30] through? Why do you want to
[1:14:32] know? What is it going to do to you?
[1:14:35] You're in a midst of a big trial. You're
[1:14:37] in a midst of a big
[1:14:39] situation. You're in a moment. What is
[1:14:41] it going to do if God explains to you
[1:14:43] what what is actually going
[1:14:45] on? How is it going to help
[1:14:47] you? When he he he tells you to trust
[1:14:51] him, we're supposed to trust
[1:14:53] him. We put our our life into his
[1:14:58] hands. Amen. We have faith and believe
[1:15:02] that God, amen, is going to honor his
[1:15:04] word. And he said, "All things will work
[1:15:06] together for my good." I don't need to
[1:15:09] understand what I'm going through, but I
[1:15:11] know it's going to work for my good. I
[1:15:13] know I'm going to grow through it. I
[1:15:15] know I'm going to come to higher ground
[1:15:17] through it. I know my faith is going to
[1:15:19] increase. I know more of God is going to
[1:15:23] be present in my life through it. So why
[1:15:26] do I need to understand
[1:15:28] it? All it does is confuse your mind.
[1:15:32] All it does then it works on your fear.
[1:15:34] It works on your emotion. It works on
[1:15:36] your 10 senses. Amen. Then doubt starts
[1:15:40] coming in. reasoning starts coming in
[1:15:43] because you opened up that channel for
[1:15:47] that. Settle it. He says, "Stle it
[1:15:51] forever." That he's not going to explain
[1:15:53] to you a thousand reasons why he deals
[1:15:56] with you the way he deals with you. Just
[1:15:58] have faith and believe God and move
[1:16:01] forward and press forward. Amen. He
[1:16:04] delivered you. Amen. Hallelujah. That's
[1:16:08] why all these stories in the Bible, the
[1:16:10] Red Sea, the lion's den, Amen. Joseph in
[1:16:14] the pit, all these things are for our
[1:16:17] faith. Amen. Amen. To believe that
[1:16:19] whatever it is in our lives, whether
[1:16:21] it's one of those things that happened
[1:16:23] to us, no matter what it is, my brothers
[1:16:25] and sisters, even in
[1:16:27] death, Amen. The worst thing that can
[1:16:30] happen to anybody on this earth is
[1:16:32] death. Even in death, there's victory.
[1:16:36] Hallelujah. for a child of God.
[1:16:40] Amen.
[1:16:43] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. With his
[1:16:45] dealings with you, God will take you at
[1:16:48] your
[1:16:49] word. Yes, he
[1:16:51] will. You raise your hand and you
[1:16:54] worship him. I believe you, Lord. I
[1:16:56] trust you, Lord. I have faith in you,
[1:16:59] Lord. I believe you're going to take me
[1:17:01] through everything, Lord. You're my
[1:17:03] healer. You're my deliverer. You're my
[1:17:06] savior. You're my everything, Lord.
[1:17:09] He'll take you at your
[1:17:11] word. He'll take you at your
[1:17:13] word. Amen. When these things come upon
[1:17:16] your
[1:17:16] life. Hallelujah. He'll take you at your
[1:17:19] word. I love you, Lord. You're my
[1:17:22] savior. I'll serve you all the days of
[1:17:24] my life. He'll take you at your word.
[1:17:27] Amen.
[1:17:29] Hallelujah. Glory to
[1:17:32] God. Amen.
[1:17:35] Hallelujah. And if you absolutely sell
[1:17:39] yourself, I might just be preaching on
[1:17:41] the high calling this
[1:17:43] morning. If you absolutely
[1:17:47] sell yourself to be his
[1:17:50] slave. What slave? I'm nobody's
[1:17:57] slave. Hallelujah.
[1:18:01] He will wrap you up in his jealous love
[1:18:04] and let other people see and do many
[1:18:06] things that you cannot do or
[1:18:09] say. Settle it.
[1:18:13] settle it forever. That you are to deal
[1:18:16] directly with the Holy
[1:18:18] Spirit and that he has
[1:18:21] a that he is to have the privilege of
[1:18:26] tying your tongue which we know in the
[1:18:29] scriptures the tongue is the most
[1:18:31] deadliest thing. Oh
[1:18:35] yes. Oh that serpent that serpent
[1:18:38] tongue.
[1:18:40] Oh Lord
[1:18:42] Jesus, help us all. Amen. Help us
[1:18:46] all.
[1:18:48] Amen.
[1:18:50] Hallelujah. The privilege of tying your
[1:18:52] tongue or chaining your
[1:18:54] hand or closing your eyes in ways others
[1:18:57] are not dealt
[1:18:59] with with now when you are so possessed
[1:19:03] with the living God that you are in your
[1:19:06] secret heart pleased.
[1:19:10] Oh my, that's another level of higher
[1:19:13] ground. That's another level of
[1:19:16] experience in our walk when you become
[1:19:19] pleased with the dealings of the Holy
[1:19:21] Spirit in your life in that area.
[1:19:24] Hallelujah.
[1:19:26] Amen. And
[1:19:29] delighted over his peculiar personal
[1:19:32] private jealousy guardianship and
[1:19:35] management of the Holy Spirit over your
[1:19:38] life. Then you have found the treasures
[1:19:42] of
[1:19:42] heaven. Oh, hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:19:46] That was the first
[1:19:50] page.
[1:19:52] Well, I ain't going through all this,
[1:19:55] that's for
[1:19:57] sure. My Lord
[1:20:01] Jesus. Brother Brand is speaking
[1:20:05] here. The identified Christ of all ages.
[1:20:09] And until you come in behind that badger
[1:20:12] skin, until you get out of your old
[1:20:16] skin, your old thoughts, your old
[1:20:19] creeds, and come into the presence of
[1:20:22] God, then the word becomes a living
[1:20:25] reality to you.
[1:20:28] Hallelujah. That's what we
[1:20:31] want. That's why we serve God.
[1:20:35] David said, "I want to know the living
[1:20:39] God." Hallelujah. I don't want to know
[1:20:41] religion. I don't know. I don't want to
[1:20:44] know church. I want to know and come in
[1:20:47] contact with the living God. And he said
[1:20:50] when he he opened my understanding. He
[1:20:53] awakened me to this word of God in this
[1:20:56] hour. He made it known to me that he's a
[1:21:00] reality. That he's a living God and he's
[1:21:04] a God that wants to live and dwell in me
[1:21:07] in this vessel. That's the faith that I
[1:21:10] receive with the new birth. Amen. And
[1:21:13] then the process started
[1:21:16] beginning of that to be fulfilled in my
[1:21:20] life.
[1:21:23] Hallelujah. Then you are awakened to the
[1:21:25] shikina glory.
[1:21:27] You know, Moses knew all about his
[1:21:29] calling. He knew all about his religion.
[1:21:32] Amen. And he tried to do it on his own
[1:21:35] and he made a mess of it. We know the
[1:21:37] story. But when he came up to that
[1:21:39] pillar of fire, hallelujah, and he met
[1:21:42] the shakina glory, hallelujah,
[1:21:45] everything changed for Moses. Amen. And
[1:21:48] that's when everything changes for us.
[1:21:51] We must be born again. We must come in
[1:21:54] contact with that shakina glory, that
[1:21:56] pillar of fire in our
[1:21:57] lives.
[1:22:00] Hallelujah. Satan trying to get us to,
[1:22:03] you know, take
[1:22:06] substitutes. Hallelujah. Substitute in
[1:22:09] so many things for our walk with Christ,
[1:22:13] for this reality of God in our lives.
[1:22:17] Oh, the devil's a master.
[1:22:20] He He He can outsmart each and every one
[1:22:22] of us a million times over. He's a
[1:22:24] master of distraction. Hallelujah. This
[1:22:27] world is nothing but one big distraction
[1:22:30] out there. Hallelujah. And he takes your
[1:22:33] own life. He takes your own mind. He
[1:22:36] knows your personality. He knows your
[1:22:39] train of thinking.
[1:22:40] Amen. If your thinking has not been
[1:22:43] trained, he knows how you think. He
[1:22:46] knows how to pull your number. He knows
[1:22:49] how to that that that to get you into
[1:22:51] such a place. Amen. You wonder why? Why
[1:22:54] do I always end up in this place? Why do
[1:22:57] I always end up in this trial or this
[1:22:59] circumstances or this happens to me? You
[1:23:02] know why? Because your mind hasn't
[1:23:03] changed. Amen. And Satan knows. He knows
[1:23:06] how to pull your trigger. He knows how
[1:23:08] to bring the people, the circumstances,
[1:23:11] the bills. Amen. The right personality
[1:23:14] out there to pull on you. Amen. But the
[1:23:17] prophet got to such a place of humility
[1:23:20] and surrender to God. And God became so
[1:23:22] real to him that he became a hot potato
[1:23:25] in the hands.
[1:23:28] Hallelujah. Why? Because his mind was
[1:23:31] the mind of Christ. Hallelujah. The wind
[1:23:34] bloweth. You don't know where it listen
[1:23:36] where it goeth. Amen. But the mind of
[1:23:39] Christ takes control of your mind. Amen.
[1:23:42] And Satan cannot counterfeit that. He
[1:23:45] can't interpret that. He can't uh
[1:23:48] discern that. Not in a son and daughter
[1:23:51] of God. Because even a son and daughter
[1:23:53] of God when they're walking every single
[1:23:56] day, Amen. They're being led by the
[1:23:58] father. Amen. As Jesus said, I do
[1:24:01] nothing unless the father show me first.
[1:24:04] They are so surrendered to the Holy
[1:24:06] Ghost. Hallelujah. They don't think a
[1:24:08] thought of their own, but they let the
[1:24:10] Holy Spirit give them the thought to
[1:24:12] speak.
[1:24:14] Hallelujah. Satan don't know what to do
[1:24:17] to do with a person like that that is so
[1:24:20] controlled by the Holy Spirit. Amen. Oh,
[1:24:23] but I'm at work. I, you know, I got to
[1:24:25] do it a certain way. I I got to do this
[1:24:28] or do that.
[1:24:30] Listen,
[1:24:32] listen. I ain't going to explain to you.
[1:24:35] If he's not going to explain to you a
[1:24:36] thousand ways that he deals with you, no
[1:24:38] preacher can tell you. Hallelujah. All I
[1:24:41] can tell you is what the word said. I
[1:24:44] don't care if you're at work. I don't
[1:24:46] care if you're over there, you're over
[1:24:48] there, wherever you are in life. Amen.
[1:24:51] The Holy Ghost, the word of God said
[1:24:53] he'll possess you. He'll speak through
[1:24:55] you in that hour. Give no thought that
[1:24:57] what you will say, but the father will
[1:24:59] speak through you in that hour. I'll
[1:25:01] give you words to say. I'll inspire you.
[1:25:04] I'll anoint you. Amen. Or I'll shut your
[1:25:06] mouth. Amen. Hallelujah. That's what
[1:25:09] I'll do.
[1:25:11] Hallelujah. No minister can explain how
[1:25:13] to put on this Christ, this life, this
[1:25:16] reality. All we can do is preach the
[1:25:19] truth. What what has been prophesied
[1:25:21] that will happen? What will come into
[1:25:22] manifestation in this hour when a
[1:25:26] person is surrendered to the Holy
[1:25:29] Spirit.
[1:25:32] Hallelujah. Then the Bible becomes a new
[1:25:35] book. Then Jesus Christ is the same
[1:25:37] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:25:42] We we have that saying right there. The
[1:25:44] biggest one of the biggest sayings in
[1:25:46] the message, right? You probably quoted
[1:25:48] it a million million times over and
[1:25:52] over. But have you really taken a look
[1:25:54] at
[1:25:56] it by
[1:25:59] experience with
[1:26:02] God? Has God give you an
[1:26:05] experience that he's the same yesterday?
[1:26:09] today and forever. Has he given you that
[1:26:13] experience that he's the same
[1:26:18] today?
[1:26:23] Hallelujah. You're living in his
[1:26:25] presence, eating his
[1:26:27] showbread that's only provided that day
[1:26:31] for believers, priests only. And we are
[1:26:34] priests, royal priesthood, holy nation,
[1:26:37] peculiar people, giving spiritual
[1:26:40] sacrifices to God. That's what we're
[1:26:43] doing. We're giving spiritual sacrifices
[1:26:45] to
[1:26:47] God. Are we giving our lives as a
[1:26:51] spiritual sacrifice to God every day,
[1:26:54] every moment of the
[1:26:56] day? Is he pleased with your
[1:27:00] sacrifice? When he's pleased with your
[1:27:02] sacrifice in your personal private life,
[1:27:07] he blesses
[1:27:08] it. He moves in your life. He moves all
[1:27:13] around you. He even causes your enemies
[1:27:16] to find favor with you. He moves this.
[1:27:20] He moves that. He orchestrates
[1:27:22] everything in your life to line up to
[1:27:25] bless you when he's pleased with your
[1:27:29] sacrifice. when you are bringing your
[1:27:32] sacrifices to
[1:27:33] him. I don't need to know your
[1:27:36] sacrifices. I don't need to you to tell
[1:27:38] me how much you pray and how much you
[1:27:40] fast. I don't need you to come before me
[1:27:43] and fellowship and quote quote quote
[1:27:45] quote scripture scripture
[1:27:46] scripture. Sometimes shut
[1:27:50] up.
[1:27:53] Seriously, be quiet.
[1:27:59] Sh. I know. I know it's tough, but this
[1:28:03] is the way God built
[1:28:06] me. God sees your
[1:28:09] sacrifice and he's pleased when you and
[1:28:13] him. What about a husband and
[1:28:17] wife? Their personal relationship is
[1:28:21] personal.
[1:28:23] It's between a husband and wife and
[1:28:25] nobody else.
[1:28:31] This the same way with
[1:28:33] Christ. He wants that personal
[1:28:35] relationship and love affair with you.
[1:28:39] When he spiritually makes love to you by
[1:28:42] revealing his word, his heart to you, he
[1:28:46] doesn't expect you to pour it
[1:28:48] out to everybody.
[1:28:52] He expects you to keep it personal
[1:28:55] between you and
[1:28:57] him.
[1:29:03] Hallelujah. And God is unveiled. That's
[1:29:06] his word manifest. The veil of
[1:29:10] tradition of unbelievers taken away. You
[1:29:14] see God when the veil of tradition has
[1:29:17] been removed, you can see that God is
[1:29:20] still God in his
[1:29:22] word. Oh, we've been preaching on it.
[1:29:27] Tradition power, the power of tradition
[1:29:29] because it's a powerful tool in the
[1:29:32] hands of Satan. Hallelujah.
[1:29:36] We don't know how to break these things,
[1:29:38] but when they come to our attention by
[1:29:41] the word of God, God inspiring these
[1:29:44] series that are coming through the
[1:29:46] five-fold
[1:29:47] ministry, it's your duty to get before
[1:29:51] God, to get serious before God and say,
[1:29:54] "Lord, show me." And if you're
[1:29:58] sincere, God knows your
[1:30:00] heart. God knows your heart. He knows
[1:30:02] your prayer. Oh, yeah. Yeah, they they
[1:30:05] speak a lot of words, but their hearts
[1:30:08] are far from
[1:30:10] me. You can't hide from God. You can
[1:30:12] pray like like an angel in front of me,
[1:30:15] but your heart God sees right into your
[1:30:19] heart. Your heart's far from
[1:30:23] God. You don't want God to deal with
[1:30:25] your heart. You don't want to open up
[1:30:26] all the doors of your heart to
[1:30:29] God. Hallelujah.
[1:30:34] Hallelujah. Traditions have been
[1:30:36] removed. You can see that God is still
[1:30:38] real. He keeps his word. He's the God
[1:30:42] author of his word. That's that's him
[1:30:46] hid behind skin and veils himself to
[1:30:50] others.
[1:30:52] What I have been saying about the
[1:30:55] message of each age receiving from God
[1:30:59] from some of the original truths of
[1:31:02] Pentecost is a type out of the Old
[1:31:05] Testament where Moses was commanded to
[1:31:07] take up three and a half pints of mana
[1:31:10] and place it on the golden vessel behind
[1:31:12] the veil of the Holies of Holies. there
[1:31:15] the high priests. Every generation could
[1:31:18] enter in with a sacrificial blood. Then
[1:31:22] you could take a small portion of that
[1:31:24] mana for it did not
[1:31:28] corrupt which was part of the
[1:31:31] original and eat it. Now every age the
[1:31:35] messenger of the Lord to that age was
[1:31:38] given the revelation of God for a
[1:31:42] special
[1:31:44] period. Once the messenger was
[1:31:46] enlightened by
[1:31:48] truth, he would bring that truth to the
[1:31:52] people and they and they whose ears have
[1:31:56] been open by the spirit would hear that
[1:32:00] truth and they would believe that truth
[1:32:04] and they would live that truth.
[1:32:07] Hallelujah.
[1:32:09] Not only just believe God sent a
[1:32:11] prophet, believe that this is the word
[1:32:13] of God, but live the truth. Brother
[1:32:17] Brandham said, "It's not good enough to
[1:32:19] agree with the message." Hallelujah. To
[1:32:22] talk about the message, but you must
[1:32:24] become the message. This word is a
[1:32:28] living reality of God. Amen. That has
[1:32:31] been spoken through a prophet in this
[1:32:33] age. Amen. that has been prophesied for
[1:32:36] the bride to put on this word to be a
[1:32:40] living epistle read of all
[1:32:45] man. It's the harder
[1:32:48] way, not the easier
[1:32:50] way. It's the dying out
[1:32:53] way. It's not always the rejoicing way.
[1:32:58] Hallelujah.
[1:33:01] Amen. Hallelujah. We know of Matthew's
[1:33:05] 25, the kingdom, the 10 virgins, the
[1:33:09] five wise, the five foolish. I believe
[1:33:13] we're right into that manifestation
[1:33:14] right now in this
[1:33:17] hour. The virgins are here. The 10
[1:33:20] virgins are here. Wise virgins, they
[1:33:24] have their oil. And the foolish virgin,
[1:33:28] they don't have the
[1:33:29] revelation. Hallelujah. And the
[1:33:32] scripture says that the the the foolish
[1:33:35] version is going to come to the wise
[1:33:36] version in this hour. Hallelujah. And
[1:33:40] say, "Give me some of that oil. Give me
[1:33:43] some of that life. Give me some of that
[1:33:45] revelation." Hallelujah. And the wise
[1:33:47] virgin is going to say, "I can't I can't
[1:33:50] give you this. Go and pray up. I don't
[1:33:54] want to be the one." Amen. You don't
[1:33:56] want to be the one that has been told by
[1:33:58] the spirit, go pray up because you got
[1:34:01] no oil, revelation in your lamp. This is
[1:34:04] 33
[1:34:05] years. 33 years of God dealing with this
[1:34:10] vessel. God breaking it, falling,
[1:34:14] getting up, molding, shaping, correcting
[1:34:17] it. Amen. Dying out to it over and over,
[1:34:21] trial, testing, testing. Amen. And every
[1:34:25] time I overcome, there's victory. Every
[1:34:29] time I overcome, there's oil coming into
[1:34:31] my lamp. Amen. How can I give that oil?
[1:34:35] Amen. How can anybody give that oil?
[1:34:38] It's happening today in the message of
[1:34:40] the hour. It's happening right now.
[1:34:43] People found, yes, they're virgins. They
[1:34:47] believe this message is the pure word of
[1:34:49] God. They believe that the prophet is
[1:34:52] the word of God. And God, the word comes
[1:34:54] to the prophet. They believe all that.
[1:34:56] Amen. But that personal life that we're
[1:35:00] talking about this morning that the Holy
[1:35:02] Ghost is talking about, I'm not talking
[1:35:04] about it. He's talking about it.
[1:35:05] Hallelujah. My notes are not talking
[1:35:07] about it. The Holy Ghost is talking
[1:35:09] about it. Hallelujah. The hour is
[1:35:12] closing. The hour is at hand, my
[1:35:14] brothers and sisters. It's no time to
[1:35:17] waste. It's no time to be loose and lack
[1:35:21] and lazy.
[1:35:22] Amen. Just like Jesus said, "Oh, can we
[1:35:27] go build a house? Can we go bury the
[1:35:31] dead?" No. That's the hour we're living
[1:35:35] in. No distractions.
[1:35:39] everything in our
[1:35:40] lives. If it doesn't line up with the
[1:35:42] word of God and God's calling upon us,
[1:35:45] God's strict demands of obedience upon
[1:35:48] us, his dealings with our life, then it
[1:35:52] doesn't matter. It's pushed
[1:35:55] aside. Oh God, the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:35:57] sees one thing now. I believe that with
[1:36:00] all my heart, hallelujah, I'm not the
[1:36:02] only one seeing the little thing that
[1:36:04] I'm seeing, the little small portion
[1:36:06] that I'm seeing. I believe the bride of
[1:36:08] Jesus Christ all over the universe is
[1:36:11] seeing this and she's coming to a place
[1:36:13] by the Holy Ghost and pushing everything
[1:36:15] aside.
[1:36:17] Hallelujah. Everything out of her life.
[1:36:19] Nothing matters to her
[1:36:23] anymore. But that
[1:36:25] word to be
[1:36:27] completed. Listen, he spoke a word in
[1:36:30] this hour. He's determined. Hallelujah.
[1:36:34] It's not you that's determined. It's not
[1:36:36] you that's going to do it. It's not all
[1:36:38] your effort and how holy you are and how
[1:36:41] even consecrated you are, which though
[1:36:43] those things are good. He's determined.
[1:36:46] Hallelujah. He has spoken. He said, "My
[1:36:48] word won't return to me void."
[1:36:50] Hallelujah. That's why he'll turn your
[1:36:52] world upside down. That's why he'll do
[1:36:54] what he has to do. He'll take people
[1:36:56] away from your life. Amen. Death will
[1:36:59] happen all around you to get you to that
[1:37:01] place. Why? Because it's him. It's his
[1:37:03] word that won't return to him void.
[1:37:06] Heavens and earth will pass away, but my
[1:37:08] word cannot
[1:37:10] fail. It must be
[1:37:13] completed. Do we understand this? Do we
[1:37:16] see what we're talking about here? The
[1:37:18] reality of what we're talking about in
[1:37:20] this hour.
[1:37:22] Hallelujah. It's the word within us.
[1:37:25] Hallelujah. The pearl of great
[1:37:28] price, the diamond within us, the
[1:37:32] greatest treasure that the world has
[1:37:34] ever
[1:37:35] known, the life of Jesus Christ.
[1:37:39] Hallelujah. That God in his grace, his
[1:37:41] sovereign grace, his love and his mercy
[1:37:44] would reach down his
[1:37:46] hand for a sinner like me.
[1:37:50] But even greater than that, that he
[1:37:52] would put me in his mind before the
[1:37:54] foundation of the world. Hallelujah.
[1:37:57] That he would think of me back there.
[1:38:00] Amen. Oh, hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:38:05] Thank you,
[1:38:06] Lord.
[1:38:08] Amen.
[1:38:10] Hallelujah. Thank you,
[1:38:13] Lord. You keep praying. I'll keep
[1:38:15] preaching for a few more minutes.
[1:38:20] Hallelujah. We understand going through
[1:38:23] the series that I've been going through
[1:38:25] power tradition that the message is in
[1:38:28] two
[1:38:29] parts. Coming out and going
[1:38:32] in. A lot of people are still in the
[1:38:35] coming out. They haven't gone in yet.
[1:38:39] But those who are ordained, Amen. the
[1:38:42] five-fold ministry is going to
[1:38:44] preach and going to preach. The Holy
[1:38:47] Spirit's going to preach through the
[1:38:48] five-fold ministry until those who are
[1:38:50] predestinated go in. Amen. If you're
[1:38:54] here this morning, you haven't gone in
[1:38:56] yet, the Holy Spirit is going to stay
[1:38:59] here and preach until you go in.
[1:39:04] Hallelujah. And when you're going in,
[1:39:07] the seals, see going coming
[1:39:10] out, the seals are
[1:39:13] breaking. Yeah. You're catching
[1:39:15] revelation. And you're catching things
[1:39:16] here and there in your
[1:39:18] experience. The seals are
[1:39:21] breaking and you're coming out. The word
[1:39:24] is revealing to you and revealing to you
[1:39:27] little by little. I'll deliver my
[1:39:29] people. A little revelation here, a
[1:39:32] little revelation here, a little truth
[1:39:33] here, a little truth there. It's pulling
[1:39:35] you and causing you to come out.
[1:39:39] Hallelujah. Come out of the
[1:39:42] world. Come out of circumstances. Come
[1:39:44] out of your flesh. Come out of your own
[1:39:46] thinking. Come out of all these
[1:39:48] things. But you see, when those seals
[1:39:52] opened up in
[1:39:54] 1963, the Bible became a new book to the
[1:39:59] prophet and it was going in
[1:40:02] time. Everything changed for him. Now,
[1:40:06] he was the wave sheet. And by faith, and
[1:40:09] I say this not by your own understanding
[1:40:12] or your education, how you can read the
[1:40:14] quotes and how you can put the quotes
[1:40:16] together, but by faith, the bride sees
[1:40:20] the wave sheet and how God transitioned
[1:40:24] him. Amen. Hallelujah. He was a seven
[1:40:27] church age messenger. We know that to
[1:40:29] the seven church age. Hallelujah. which
[1:40:33] we understand that most people in this
[1:40:35] message are still feeding off of old
[1:40:39] mana, the seven church age message.
[1:40:44] Amen. You can hear it in their
[1:40:46] fellowship. You can hear it in their
[1:40:48] understanding of the of the word of God
[1:40:50] that they have an understanding that
[1:40:51] they're still back in a seven church age
[1:40:53] and they're quoting the prophet. Amen.
[1:40:56] They're quoting the prophet. The brother
[1:40:58] Bram said, Brother Bram said, Brother
[1:40:59] Bam
[1:41:00] said, but remember there was a
[1:41:03] transition that he took it took place in
[1:41:06] his life that changed him and it became
[1:41:09] a new book. See, brother Brandon didn't
[1:41:11] have the message. We're like, we got the
[1:41:13] message. We quote the message. Brother
[1:41:14] Brandham said, Brother Brandon said,
[1:41:16] Brother Brandon had the message. He had
[1:41:18] the word of God. Hallelujah. He had the
[1:41:21] revealed word that was being revealed to
[1:41:23] him. That's what he spoke. The message
[1:41:26] ain't what we make it to be. We have no
[1:41:29] right to put a a a culture or title or
[1:41:33] message believer anything on it. It's
[1:41:35] the word of God in process and
[1:41:38] revealing. Amen. It's Jesus Christ.
[1:41:41] Amen.
[1:41:43] That's why they glorify a man. That's
[1:41:46] why they make an image unto the prophet
[1:41:48] in this hour and this day. And they
[1:41:50] don't see Jesus Christ lifted up on
[1:41:52] high.
[1:41:57] It's the
[1:41:58] word and the message confuses
[1:42:02] people. Puts the cow on top of the roof
[1:42:05] as the scripture says. Mixes everything
[1:42:08] up. Doesn't put it in its proper place.
[1:42:11] But God has an order to his word. God
[1:42:14] has an order and a process to our
[1:42:16] journey, to our experience, our new
[1:42:19] birth, our deliverance, everything.
[1:42:24] We can't change
[1:42:25] that. We can't go ahead of
[1:42:28] it.
[1:42:30] Hallelujah. Which most people are
[1:42:35] doing. It was the going in
[1:42:40] time. See, the unwritten
[1:42:46] word was revealed to the
[1:42:51] bride. what we call the
[1:42:54] message to the prophet. It was the word
[1:42:56] of God, the unwritten word being
[1:43:00] revealed. And we understand there is
[1:43:02] many traditions, many doctrines, many
[1:43:05] beliefs in this
[1:43:07] message that
[1:43:10] are
[1:43:11] birthed
[1:43:14] inspired under a past age word in this
[1:43:18] message.
[1:43:22] It's just like the
[1:43:24] law, the Old Testament
[1:43:27] law. The Bible says if if it was
[1:43:33] needed, there would be no place for it
[1:43:37] to be removed. But God removed when it
[1:43:40] came to the Gentiles, he removed the
[1:43:43] law. It wasn't needed because this was
[1:43:46] greater.
[1:43:48] Do we understand? I hope so. A little
[1:43:51] bit even this is
[1:43:54] greater. Hallelujah. And even the
[1:43:57] prophet came to a place and said
[1:44:00] that and many different ways he was
[1:44:03] expressing that. And many different
[1:44:05] times he said there's so many things I
[1:44:07] want to say to you and reveal to you but
[1:44:10] I
[1:44:11] can't. And people get boggled in their
[1:44:14] mind. the educated ones, the
[1:44:17] intellectual ones, their minds blow up
[1:44:21] when brother Brandham say that and they
[1:44:22] say, "Oh, he didn't complete everything.
[1:44:24] He didn't finish everything." So, I have
[1:44:26] to complete what he was saying. I have
[1:44:30] to put it all together what he was
[1:44:32] saying. But you see, it's the unwritten
[1:44:35] word. Amen. And the third poll, the Holy
[1:44:38] Ghost told him, you're not going to say
[1:44:41] a word about this. Amen. Hallelujah. I'm
[1:44:44] going to keep it to myself. Everything,
[1:44:47] the first pull, the second pole,
[1:44:49] hallelujah, all the church ages, Amen.
[1:44:52] All the six seals, Amen. You're going to
[1:44:55] reveal it. You're going to expose it.
[1:44:57] The people are going to know it. Amen.
[1:44:59] And Amen. The people are going to make a
[1:45:00] mess of it. And all the things that are
[1:45:02] prophesied will come to pass because of
[1:45:05] it. But the seven seal,
[1:45:08] hallelujah. Hallelujah. The seven seal
[1:45:11] ain't going to say nothing about it.
[1:45:13] Amen. Because the seventh seal is me.
[1:45:16] Amen. It's me myself. I'm going to
[1:45:19] reveal, Amen, these things to my bride
[1:45:21] in this hour. I'm going to show her
[1:45:23] things to come. I'm going to reveal the
[1:45:26] truth. Amen. Hallelujah. What the
[1:45:28] prophet seen that took him into that
[1:45:31] other dimension
[1:45:32] that rapture him. You know, he was
[1:45:35] raptured. His body was changed.
[1:45:38] Hallelujah.
[1:45:40] What what came to him, Amen. is that
[1:45:42] seven seal revealing to him is going to
[1:45:45] come to us, the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:45:48] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:45:50] Amen. No pulp is going to preach it. No
[1:45:54] five-fold ministry is going to preach
[1:45:56] it. Amen.
[1:45:57] Hallelujah. It's Christ himself.
[1:46:01] Amen.
[1:46:03] Glory to God.
[1:46:05] Thank you, Lord. The unwritten word.
[1:46:09] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Amen. That
[1:46:12] word will not fit today or produce a
[1:46:16] body change. And all that happens
[1:46:19] because there's no born again
[1:46:21] experience, no real revelation that
[1:46:23] brings life to them. Like the prophet
[1:46:26] said, a nonseed can never be born again.
[1:46:29] Hallelujah.
[1:46:31] But this unwritten word is a living,
[1:46:35] active, two-edged sword, piercing,
[1:46:38] dividing the soul and sunder. Amen. And
[1:46:42] the mirror and the discerner of the
[1:46:44] thoughts and the intents of the heart.
[1:46:46] That's what we're talking about this
[1:46:47] morning. When the Holy Ghost gets into a
[1:46:50] life, Amen. When the high calling is
[1:46:52] upon your life, that's what happens to
[1:46:54] you. That's how the Holy Ghost deals
[1:46:57] with your life. Hallelujah. is a living
[1:47:00] word, a vibrant with life. A word that
[1:47:04] carries power, life and a power of
[1:47:07] transformation. A persistent word. Oh
[1:47:12] yes,
[1:47:14] persistent. God is determined. Amen. I
[1:47:18] don't care how you feel, how I feel. I
[1:47:22] don't care if sickness comes, whatever
[1:47:24] comes in our lives. This word, amen,
[1:47:27] that started the work. Amen. It's always
[1:47:30] active inside of us. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:47:35] That's why we rejoice through your
[1:47:36] trials and trouble. Amen. This does
[1:47:39] never stops. Amen. This work never
[1:47:42] stops. If you know it's activated in
[1:47:44] you, you know the living God is inside
[1:47:47] of you. Hallelujah. And revealing to
[1:47:50] you, it never stops. It's always moving.
[1:47:54] Oh Lord, I don't feel I this. I that.
[1:47:57] But I thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:48:01] I'm not looking to myself. I'm looking
[1:48:02] to the promises of God in the word. You
[1:48:05] never stop working inside of me.
[1:48:08] Hallelujah. I'm going to try to wind it
[1:48:11] down here. Hallelujah.
[1:48:18] Somebody somewhere has drawn a lot of
[1:48:21] virtue out of me and I have to wind it
[1:48:24] down. I don't want to fall over here.
[1:48:26] Then one of your brothers is going to
[1:48:28] have to pick me up.
[1:48:31] Hallelujah. You can never confirm your
[1:48:33] position in this capstone age.
[1:48:37] Hallelujah. And the capstone revelation
[1:48:39] by the written
[1:48:41] word. 2 Corinthians 3:6. who has made us
[1:48:45] able ministers of the New Testament, not
[1:48:48] of the letter, but of the spirit. For
[1:48:50] the letter kleth, but the spirit giveth
[1:48:52] life. This third pull is the revealing
[1:48:56] of the word. It's the mysteries being
[1:48:59] made known only by the unwritten
[1:49:03] word. People are vindicating themselves
[1:49:07] today as a confirmation that they're in
[1:49:10] the capstone by the written word.
[1:49:14] Oh, I I I I understand the written word.
[1:49:18] I understand the
[1:49:19] message. I've heard it so many times. I
[1:49:22] understand what the prophet said here. I
[1:49:25] understand what he said there. I know
[1:49:27] this. I know that. That's not the
[1:49:29] confirmation. And a lot of people are
[1:49:32] vindicating their own ministries because
[1:49:34] they know how to put a message together.
[1:49:37] They know how to put an understanding of
[1:49:40] what the prophet said together. That's
[1:49:43] the written word. We can never be
[1:49:45] vindicated by the written word. It's the
[1:49:48] unwritten word. It's the life of
[1:49:50] Christ. Amen. They're born again, the
[1:49:54] bride, by the seventh seal, not by the
[1:49:57] written
[1:49:58] word. They believe all that is written
[1:50:01] in the word. They believe everything the
[1:50:03] prophet said, but it's not based on the
[1:50:06] written word anymore. is based on
[1:50:08] whether you can receive revelation from
[1:50:10] the
[1:50:11] unwritten word. It's not
[1:50:16] written. Hallelujah. You know that what
[1:50:19] I'm talking about right here is going to
[1:50:21] put the persecution on the bride of
[1:50:24] Jesus
[1:50:25] Christ. Oh yes. is going to put the
[1:50:29] persecution on the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:50:31] because this unwritten word when it
[1:50:34] starts revealing and it starts
[1:50:36] manifesting through the bride of Jesus
[1:50:38] Christ the ones who live by the written
[1:50:41] word of not only the Bible but the
[1:50:43] message are going to
[1:50:45] say no no no they're going to come
[1:50:48] against Jesus Christ again like they did
[1:50:51] back there when Jesus Christ did the
[1:50:54] things that he did what did they do they
[1:50:56] always came to him and said, "Why are
[1:51:00] you eating on the Sabbath day? Why are
[1:51:02] you healing on the Sabbath day? Why are
[1:51:04] you doing these things? Why are you
[1:51:05] doing
[1:51:07] that?" They came
[1:51:10] against the denominations came against
[1:51:13] the prophet of this
[1:51:14] hour. Hallelujah. Because they were
[1:51:17] based on the written word, the church
[1:51:20] ages. Hallelujah. They weren't based on
[1:51:23] the seventh seal. And that's why they
[1:51:25] came against the prophet and called him
[1:51:29] a false prophet. All his doctrines were
[1:51:32] of the devil. That God had all these
[1:51:34] things because they couldn't understand
[1:51:37] the unwritten word. The unwritten word
[1:51:40] is what reveals the written word.
[1:51:44] Hallelujah.
[1:51:46] Hallelujah. Amen. Just as Jesus said,
[1:51:48] flesh and blood has not revealed it to
[1:51:50] you, but my father is always based on
[1:51:53] revelation. Yes, because the unwritten
[1:51:55] word word reveals and brings
[1:51:59] more to you into your understanding of
[1:52:04] the life of Christ that the written word
[1:52:08] can never do. Think about
[1:52:12] it. Bring you to an understanding of the
[1:52:15] life of Jesus Christ. the spirit of God
[1:52:19] with inside of you. It's the spirit of
[1:52:22] truth that reveals to you, that shows
[1:52:24] you things to come. Amen. Not the
[1:52:28] written word. The unwritten word brings
[1:52:31] the life of Christ. That's where the
[1:52:34] bride will know what to do with the
[1:52:36] word. How does she know what to do with
[1:52:39] the word? Because she can read the
[1:52:41] written word? No. Because the unwritten
[1:52:44] word, the living word. Hallelujah. Is
[1:52:48] inside of her revealing these things and
[1:52:51] showing her
[1:52:52] things. It's the life of Christ
[1:52:56] himself, revealing himself to her.
[1:53:00] Hallelujah.
[1:53:02] Amen. Glory to God. Thank you,
[1:53:06] Lord. Amen. I'm going to wind this down.
[1:53:11] There is one here so many who doesn't
[1:53:14] have this quicking power in you. The sun
[1:53:19] has shined across and you sit in this
[1:53:23] tabernacle. You listen to the tapes and
[1:53:26] yet the spirit has never quicken you to
[1:53:28] follow the word of God. As people today
[1:53:31] are trying to say we should wash feet on
[1:53:34] this year Friday, Thursday, we should
[1:53:37] take communion on different doctrines.
[1:53:39] They argue whether it should be on this
[1:53:41] day or that day. And this is all going
[1:53:43] on even in the message. All kinds of
[1:53:47] fighting is going
[1:53:49] on. All kinds of ministers fighting
[1:53:51] against one another. This is right. That
[1:53:53] is right. This is right. This is the way
[1:53:55] it should be done. You shouldn't have
[1:53:56] this. I even heard not I even heard uh
[1:54:00] not too long ago from the from the
[1:54:02] brothers there that minister said we
[1:54:04] shouldn't be wearing these pins.
[1:54:10] I don't know. But this is what he's
[1:54:12] talking about
[1:54:13] here. They argue about whether it should
[1:54:16] be on this day or that day, whether it
[1:54:18] should be the Sabbath, the first day of
[1:54:19] the week, all these things. They're all
[1:54:21] just merely
[1:54:23] traditions. Arguments of man. What good
[1:54:25] would any of it do whether you had Lent
[1:54:28] or not Lent if there's no life inside of
[1:54:31] you? Think about it. What is all this
[1:54:35] bickering and
[1:54:38] fighting? What is all this bickering and
[1:54:40] fighting inside of you? The war that's
[1:54:43] going on inside of
[1:54:44] you. What good is it
[1:54:50] all? What what good is all this
[1:54:52] disagreement and all
[1:54:55] this confusion
[1:54:57] and whether this is right or that is
[1:55:00] right? whether this person is right or
[1:55:02] that person is right. What what is it?
[1:55:05] What does that have to do with
[1:55:08] anything? We worry about so many things,
[1:55:10] so many
[1:55:11] distractions. Satan puts so many
[1:55:13] substitutes in in in our way in our
[1:55:15] lives and distracts us in so many
[1:55:18] different
[1:55:21] ways. And he's saying, "What does any of
[1:55:23] this have to do any of your traditions,
[1:55:26] whether you you do it perfectly or not?
[1:55:32] If you have no life inside of
[1:55:35] you, if you miss that
[1:55:38] life, he says right there, if you miss
[1:55:40] that life, you're not coming up
[1:55:43] anyhow. We Listen, my brothers and
[1:55:45] sisters, I'm trying to make it as simple
[1:55:48] as
[1:55:50] possible. That's what we're going
[1:55:52] after is the life of God.
[1:55:57] If there's anything that you want to
[1:55:59] know that you should know is that you
[1:56:02] got the life of God inside of you.
[1:56:06] He said in the token message, you must
[1:56:08] have the token. He said, do everything
[1:56:11] that you need to
[1:56:14] do. Whatever it is that you have to do
[1:56:17] in your life, whatever you have to make
[1:56:20] right, get that token. Don't miss that
[1:56:24] token.
[1:56:26] I'm going to repeat his words because
[1:56:28] outside of that token, you're going to
[1:56:30] perish.
[1:56:32] We must have the token. That's why we
[1:56:36] come. That's why we listen. That's why
[1:56:39] we surrender our lives. That's why we
[1:56:41] die out. That's why we believe. It's the
[1:56:45] life.
[1:56:49] There's something driving me inside for
[1:56:52] more of that life.
[1:56:55] I got to have it.
[1:57:00] Musicians come.
[1:57:05] There's no life inside of you. It's only
[1:57:07] a
[1:57:09] memorial, which there's nothing against
[1:57:12] it, but you certainly have carried out
[1:57:14] your
[1:57:16] traditions, but left off the main
[1:57:19] thing. Think about it.
[1:57:24] We left off the main. There's going to
[1:57:26] be people that come hear the word of
[1:57:30] God. Hear the
[1:57:33] anointing. Hear the word that was
[1:57:35] delivered in this
[1:57:36] hour and left off the main thing. You
[1:57:41] come to church. You call yourself a
[1:57:45] believer. You support with your money.
[1:57:52] everything and those things are
[1:57:54] respected. You do great
[1:57:57] works. But didn't you leave off the main
[1:58:10] thing? Satan doesn't care how religious
[1:58:12] you
[1:58:14] are, how right you are in your doctrine.
[1:58:19] You could have the right
[1:58:20] doctrine and the wrong
[1:58:23] spirit. The prophet said, "I'd rather
[1:58:26] have the right spirit because if my
[1:58:27] doctrine is wrong, the right spirit will
[1:58:30] correct it." Not only your doctrine, but
[1:58:32] the right spirit will correct everything
[1:58:34] in your life and put you right in line.
[1:58:38] Stay in
[1:58:40] line. The voice cried out through the
[1:58:42] prophet in the vision. The bride getting
[1:58:45] out of line. Stay in line, my brothers
[1:58:50] and sisters. Stay focused. Stay in line
[1:58:52] with the main thing, the life of God,
[1:58:55] the token in this hour. We must have
[1:58:58] this token displayed and manifested.
[1:59:02] This third pull must be manifested in
[1:59:05] this
[1:59:06] hour.
[1:59:08] Hallelujah. Glory to
[1:59:11] God. Let us stand.
[1:59:14] I just want to read this last quote
[1:59:17] here. Jehovah
[1:59:20] Gyra.
[1:59:27] Hallelujah. It's already
[1:59:31] yours. It belongs to
[1:59:34] you. For you are Abraham's
[1:59:37] seed. If you receive the Holy Ghost, you
[1:59:42] are sealed.
[1:59:45] Hallelujah. Do you know you're sealed
[1:59:47] this
[1:59:49] morning? If there's a doubt or question
[1:59:51] in your
[1:59:53] heart, you need to settle
[1:59:55] [Music]
[1:59:58] that. You're dead and your life is hid
[2:00:00] with Christ through God, sealed by the
[2:00:03] Holy Ghost. How long until the next
[2:00:06] revival, until the next
[2:00:09] experience, until the day of redemption,
[2:00:13] until the day of a rapture? Ephesians
[2:00:16] 4:30, grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby
[2:00:18] you're sealed. Do not grieve the Holy
[2:00:21] Ghost in your life, my brothers and
[2:00:23] sisters. Don't fight against the Holy
[2:00:26] Ghost. Surrender to it. Yield to it.
[2:00:29] [Music]
[2:00:30] Come to a place, as the high calling
[2:00:32] said, where you're
[2:00:34] pleased. You are pleased with his
[2:00:37] dealings in your
[2:00:39] [Music]
[2:00:41] life whereby you're sealed into the day
[2:00:44] of redemption. Before a car can be
[2:00:47] sealed, a box car, everything's got to
[2:00:50] fit in there good and
[2:00:54] tight. Hallelujah.
[2:00:57] God is getting this word inside of a
[2:01:01] bride. Amen. Inside of her soul good and
[2:01:06] tight. This word of
[2:01:08] God.
[2:01:10] Hallelujah. That's the reason so many
[2:01:12] don't get the Holy
[2:01:14] Ghost. They're too
[2:01:16] loose. We talked about being
[2:01:20] loose. Why?
[2:01:22] Sure. An eagle is a specialmade bird.
[2:01:26] So he has to have a special
[2:01:28] feathers, a special eye to climb, way
[2:01:32] way, way up above everything else. Oh
[2:01:37] God, this bride has special eyes,
[2:01:40] special feathers, a revelation that she
[2:01:43] can climb, way up and see everything in
[2:01:46] her life. Amen.
[2:01:48] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's the way
[2:01:51] God's people does it. God's eaglets.
[2:01:55] They climb way up there. They're
[2:01:58] Abraham's seed. They believe everything.
[2:02:01] No matter what the circumstance
[2:02:03] is, they always they they're always from
[2:02:08] the earth. Circumstances, they're way
[2:02:11] high above the earth's
[2:02:15] atmospheres. Oh Lord, lift me above the
[2:02:19] shadows. Give me fellowship with thee.
[2:02:22] That's right. Plant my feet on higher
[2:02:25] ground. Take me up, Lord. Let me stand
[2:02:29] by faith on heaven's table land. A
[2:02:32] higher plane, a higher revelation this
[2:02:35] morning. Every day, Lord, lift my feet
[2:02:39] higher and higher, way, way, way up.
[2:02:43] Hallelujah. Abraham, his seed, and and
[2:02:46] and his seed after him. The covenant was
[2:02:50] absolutely
[2:02:52] unconditional to both Abraham and his
[2:02:55] seed after him. Unconditional, my
[2:02:58] brothers and sisters, there is no
[2:03:01] condition, amen, behind this word of
[2:03:05] God. Amen. God is saying, I put it
[2:03:10] unconditionally before you. this word
[2:03:12] that I've spoken in this hour.
[2:03:15] Hallelujah. There is no conditions on
[2:03:17] it. Just
[2:03:19] believe. Just
[2:03:21] accept. Just let the Holy Ghost Amen.
[2:03:25] take you higher. Just surrender your
[2:03:28] life. Hallelujah. There is no conditions
[2:03:31] based upon put on you. There's no
[2:03:34] nothing put on you. Nothing that you
[2:03:36] have to do. Nothing that you have to
[2:03:38] perform.
[2:03:40] Just surrender your
[2:03:41] life.
[2:03:43] Hallelujah. It's hard to
[2:03:46] die. It's hard to surrender. Just
[2:03:49] surrender to
[2:03:50] him unconditionally. He'll take you and
[2:03:54] he'll lift you higher and higher and
[2:03:56] higher until one day like Enoch. Come
[2:03:59] home
[2:04:00] Enoch. Come home my little bride.
[2:04:04] Hallelujah. Let us pray.
[2:04:06] Father, into thy hands I commit your
[2:04:09] people. Father, into thy hands I commit
[2:04:11] the word. You have taken me,
[2:04:17] Lord, to
[2:04:20] [Music]
[2:04:22] places that I didn't know I was going to
[2:04:26] go. You said, "My word won't return to
[2:04:29] me void, but will accomplish."
[2:04:32] You said, "I sent forth my
[2:04:34] word and healed the
[2:04:37] people." Lord, it's not only physical
[2:04:39] healing, but it's mental healing. It's
[2:04:43] heart healing. It's spiritual
[2:04:46] healing. God, sometimes the word
[2:04:49] cuts, but that's
[2:04:52] healing. That's the love of
[2:04:55] God. The love of God is corrective.
[2:05:00] Oh God, I love you Lord because you
[2:05:03] correct me.
[2:05:04] Father, I would not know how to correct
[2:05:09] myself, but you correct me.
[2:05:12] Lord, you know the hearts that you spoke
[2:05:15] to and the areas of the heart that you
[2:05:17] spoke into have the preeminence, Lord.
[2:05:21] May they open up the
[2:05:22] [Applause]
[2:05:23] doors or the door, Lord, that they've
[2:05:27] kept closed.
[2:05:31] You have opened the prison, Lord. You
[2:05:33] have broken the
[2:05:34] chains. Why are we still sitting in the
[2:05:38] prison when you have said
[2:05:41] go? You are
[2:05:44] free. Who the son of man sets free is
[2:05:47] free indeed. Be thou free, bride of
[2:05:50] Jesus
[2:05:51] Christ. Be thou
[2:05:54] blessed because the Lord God has
[2:05:56] declared it.
[2:05:58] and performed it and he has finished
[2:06:02] it in Jesus name we
[2:06:05] pray. God bless you saints.
[2:06:13] I lift it up.
[2:06:16] [Music]
[2:06:20] Come and
[2:06:24] quench this
[2:06:26] thirsty of my soul.

[2:10:23] right? And only give them what is
[2:10:24] needful at that time. But we certainly
[2:10:26] want to go out and and and speak the
[2:10:29] word uh to everybody that would seem to
[2:10:34] have a heart to receive. You can't just

[2:10:40] would open a door, see, that's what we
[2:10:42] did this morning, right? We opened a

[2:11:04] his family, growing them into maturity,
[2:11:07] equipping them for ministry to fulfill
[2:11:09] their life's purpose of glorifying God.
