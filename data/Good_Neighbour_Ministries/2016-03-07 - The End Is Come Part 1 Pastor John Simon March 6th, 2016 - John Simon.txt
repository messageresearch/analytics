"The End Is Come" Pastor John Simon March 6th, 2016
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
free and and it's its own person I don't have to answer to the pastor and it just moves when it wants to move then you really don't have anything because the house can fall down at any time but when you have people that are solidly AC in the presence of God are faithful they are like armor bearers to the minister unto the word they are in helps they have to minister governments on them administrations like um you know I don't really consider myself a great administrator but there are people in here that have those gifts uh that can assist me in administration there's other people that assist me so that's how the body works we we fing for one another and we don't think because I'm the hand and I can pick up something and the foot can only walk I'm better than the foot I'm not better than the foot because the hand is the foot the hand can't get anywhere without the foot everything has to work together amen and we need each other none of us is complete within ourselves no matter how confident you think you are you are not um fully complete within yourself right the body of Christ has to work together for the glory of God amen amen I must say uh I also am very happy to see how The Prayer Ministry is progressing and and what God is doing through it and the Miracles the signs the Wonders and the healings that are taking place I'm very thankful and pleased to God and I believe that by the end of this week by next Sunday uh I've written a booklet on prayer uh just brief on prayer that I think will be helpful uh to the congregation in how to pray under certain circumstances and we like to give that out to every one of you have my daughter starting to prepare it now uh it's just going to be about one page or two pages but it's just enough to stimulate you into an atmosphere of prayer praise the Lord and I trust God will richly bless you let a wonderful way I want to thank all the brothers that stood in the Gap while I was away um whether they ministered or not because everything still has to work uh like that amen for the minister to stand here a lot of background work has to be done and a lot of people are involved in it so we thank God that the church should work like a watch where you look and you see just the hands of the face right but you don't realize that there are main Springs and subsidiary Springs and everything else working in the background just for me to stand here right I just happen to be the face but everything is working in the background and we thank God for every one of you brothers and sisters amen amen is that right amen I want you to know that the only thing that God says a woman should not do in the church is to stand up here and preach or Minister the word of God other than that in this church you're open to everything else by the grace of God that's a white statement so take it um as it is the end is come is my topic today wow the end is come and the scripture is found in Ezekiel 7 verse 6 amen all right let's read together and uh the end is come the end is come it watch for thee behold it is come amen praise the Lord God bless his word father we thank you for the reading of your word we pray and ask your blessing upon it and sanctify it and give us the inspiration thereof in the name of Jesus we ask it amen and amen God richly bless you amen praise God you know when you're young time seems to um move slowly is that right it seems like the days are long the nights are long and when you get into the school it looks like uh the classes don't end it goes on forever and things like that you know but as you grow older it seems like time passes much quicker somehow like there are not enough hours in the day and that's the way it is um well 365 days is actually 8,760 hours five 25,600 minutes and 31 milon 536 seconds makes up an entire year praise the Lord uh when you think of uh of a year or of the future we can all say our future is certain amen and the reason why I use the word that the future is certain is because Ready or Not is coming is that right whether you are prepared to receive it or you are ready for it it's coming anyhow so we've got to be prepared now the Bible says I will guide thee with my eye and so we can see that even though God says he will guide us with his eyes yet our future is uncertain for sure it's coming but now you have to live in that future and then your future becomes uncertain because you don't know what is going to occur or what is going to take place and what the future holds the Bible tells us psalms 27 verse one Bast not thyself of tomorrow for thou knowest not what a day might bring forth a lot of things can happen in the day you can start out the day happy and right and everything else and before the day is over you can be as down in depression as possible so things can change on Dy just like that right and we know friends that happiness peace and all these things don't just go lasting forever while we are in human life it comes in waves and Cycles yes like that it comes there's got to be ups and they got to be Downs amen there's got to be mountain tops there got to be valleys there light and there is dark and so on we have to face these uh this cudes or changes of life that take place in The Human Experience uh turn with me to 1 Corinthians 10 uh verse 11 can we all read this now all these things happen unto them for amples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come didn't say the end of the world but the ends of the world so when I see ends I got curious and I looked at that and sure enough in the NIV it says there unto whom the Fulfillment of the ages have come wow amen so Paul is speaking here and he's talking about the cycle of the church ages and the things that were going to be in his time but now we can say that the end is G for the angel has already descended and plac his foot on the land and on the sea amen and as already announced time shall be no more now we understand it means time of the church ages the dispensational time for the church ages are now over it's over done with and here we are sitting at the end of those Church ages ready for what crossing over is all right we're at the Crossing we in the age of Brotherly kindness lodia amen and here we are physically I'm talking about we are at the Crossing which is what I've been preaching to you that only the Holy Spirit opening up the word to you like he opened up Jordan to the Israelites to cross over into the promised land yes you remember the scripture first Joshua Joshua chapter 1 how the priest had to advance uh by faith into the word into the water and as soon as their feet touched the water of Jordan Jordan parted yes and they were able to walk over on the other side which is a type that when the Ministers of the word begin to break into the genuine revelation of the word the word is going to start to open up to them and to the people and they're going to walk right over and walk right through and plant their feet in the promised land of God's word amen thank you Lord hallelujah so we thank the Lord Jesus for that now the Fulfillment of the ages have come what a wonderful time to be living in amen that we are living in the age of what the Fulfillment of Prophecy amen and more than that we are a part of the prophecy yes and we thank God that it is becoming unto us to play our part or to fulfill all righteousness all that is written of the Bride in the word we are called to fulfill amen and this is the hour where we are here taking the bride stand and you know what the bright stand is it's the stand by husband the word stand by the word and not to move from it but to stay right by the word of the Living God and not move from it praise the Lord now we know friends that uh there are four things that we want to look at here today that will come to an end we know the word of God is never ending amen but four things that we know we can look at that will come to an end Amen brother brother the seal B says he says we're at the end preach the message Serv is this the end time of the end well we know that he recognize end of what he didn't mean just the end of the world he was telling the people that the church ages are over amen it's the end of the church ages and now we are breaking into a new and brighter day amen now first of all four things when we look at it we've come to the end of these Church ages then we look at the end of Nations a lot of nations are going to begin to break up and fall apart you just have to look into uh the world today and you can see what is happening right now we see how uh Abraham was called out of or of the ches we see how out of him came Israel and we know how they disobeyed God's word and after disobeying God's word they was scattered all to every part of the earth and being scattered into every part of the earth they were no more a nation they were they only became a nation when the United Nations gave them that designation again but other than that they were just scattered tribes but then they were recognized and so uh we recognize that every nation sometime or the other in their relationship with God their Nation can be broken to pieces and come to an end brother sister let me tell you God have Mercy on North America and the United States of America and Western Civilization when we look at the scriptures here today it is getting from bad to worse God have mercy upon us I'm going to be careful Christ have mercy upon us hallelujah oh Jesus amen Catholic means Universal by the way doesn't mean Roman amen praise God but the fact is God have mercy upon us because what do we see here in this age that we are living in we see here that the nations are putting God out of the schools still claiming to be Christian but putting out of the schools they're breaking down the values of society they're teaching all kinds of ungodly things within the school system to catch the minds of children when they young hoping that they won't depart from it when they get older teaching them everything else about this that the other now when we look at the what is taking place brother the corruption everywhere in government in politics in the schools teachers with students students with teachers not to be graphic and to outline everything with you but you know you read the papers you hear the news the entire is going wild I'm glad I already raised my children and there have to deal with whatever they have to deal with in this age but I I pray for you young people and those of you who have young children because what you have to deal with is worse than my time amen worse amen worse with my than my time and God help you and that's why you need to be here in the house of God so that you have a strong faith and a strong foundation so that like Timothy's grandmother when when Paul looked at Timothy he said I can see the Fai of your grandmother you need see your mother in you I can see it in you because what that faith that was once given to the Saints was just passed on down to Timothy and he grabbed a hold of it God helped every one of us here everyday that we will pass on this Faith to our children and to our children's children that we can have something in this world a light still shining in the middle of this world Amen praise the Lord amen yes sir giv over to modernism giv over to science given over to human reasoning that is what is going on here now the end is come and it's watching for you it's almost like saying Hell has opened his mouth and it's ready to receive you it's enlarged it's ready to take in as much as it can take in not only the end of Nations because here we see friends Egypt was powerful thought it will never end to C he said when thepoon was coning he thought his Empire would never end the Persians when there were running over the entire world they thought their empire would never end and then after a while it went to Spain the Spanish Armada was everywhere into the Americas all over and then we find out L France was the world power and their empire stretched all the way down into the South America and all the islands everywhere Vietnam that conquered all those places and their power was in Africa everywhere and fraternity you know equality everything else is brought from the masses From Below because those that were on the top became so corrupt and they got so corrupt that the people say we're going to die anyway we might as well put an end to this thing some of us going to die the rest of us going to live and we can change the country amen and that's what happened and then France itself fell from being a world power and we we see we see uh uh Britain rose up as the world B britania rules the waves no setting on the sun of the British Empire because their empire went from the F Islands way to the north everywhere the British had their power and so they felt that Empire would last for thousands of years then come the marching hordes of hiters Nazis and the third right was at hand and they felt their empire would stand forever and everything else but what do we know it's fallen in the words of brother BR he said all those Empires where are they they're under the desert signs he said every one of their leaders are dead gone and buried and it's all over with Persia under Babylon but Nezar all gone amen but friends modern events are made clear by vindica prophecy come on now we're looking at the United States and Canada and Western powers that are here and we see what is taking place now we know that there are seven dispensations of time broken up innocense in the time of Adam and Eve until that was uh broken by sin and then after they fell into see God put them under the the dispensation of operating by their conscience God in them convicting them and they operated under the dispensation of conscience and then they were under the dispensation of Promise called sometimes it's called a patriarch patrial or abrahamic right because Abraham got the promise so they were all the dispensation of Promise after that there were ruled by human government which means Kings and stuff like that but then what happened is that God then brought them under the dispensation of law right under Moses they were under law and the law ruled as a school Master until Christ came and when the Lord Jesus came and died for our sins then they dispensation of grace started right amen the dispensation of grace started at the crucifixion it ends at the resurrection and Rapture of the church is that right that's how it ends it starts with the crucifixtion and it ends because nothing was paid for before so no nobody could really be genuinely borned again they had to wait for the Lamb's blood to be shed before that they just believe unto eternal life is that right and they had to wait until he could take them out of paradise take them out of where the devil had them and move them with him into Paradise so in actual fact the the dispensation of grace started when he died on the cross and paid the Redemption price for our sins thank you and with Grace which is what God's unmerited favor which we didn't deserve none of us were born we haven't done any evil or anything like that yet but before we were yet sinners Christ died for the ungodly died for our sins and already paid the price thank you Lord so that you can confess your sins raise your hands and say thank God I am free free from this world of sin free from adamic sin free from what Adam and Eve free from the curse because Paul said he blotted out the sermons The handwriting the condemnation that was against us he destroyed it Hallelujah and now we are free by the grace of God hallelujah amen and of course the last dispensation will be the millennial dispensation now we are aware the end under the Fulfillment of the ages are come Hallelujah now the next step is the rapture and the millennial dispensation I'm talking about for the church now for the world there is tribulation for us is the Millennium praise the name of the Lord Jesus hallelujah amen oh praise God forever more listen what the scripture says Titus 2 verse 11 for the grace of God that bringeth salvation has appear to all all men thanks be to God that the word of God has come to us the Bible tells us Revelation 227 whosoever will let him take of the Water of Life freely praise God oh come unto me everyone that thirs are you thirsty for more are you thirsty for the Revelation are you thirsty for the word of God I can't stop drinking I got to keep drinking God because I'm thirsty for the revelation of the word of God Amen so our this dispensation will end at the Rapture of the Church of the Living God and when this dispensation ends God will take the Holy Spirit out of from the earth hallelujah amen take the Holy Spirit right out of the earth glory to God and right now he's gradually fing he's gradually going out and another quotation brother said the holy ghost is now dealing with and in the bride so when she goes the Holy Ghost goes amen hallelujah because the salt she's the salt the salt goes the the light goes the Holy Ghost goes amen and when he the holy spirit is taken out he that let it or he that hinders ceases to hinder when is taken out then just imagine a world without the Holy Ghost operating the way that he is now think about it that would be equivalent to the 400 years that occurred between Malachi and the Book of Matthew there's a 400e period of History which in isra Israeli history they call it their dark ages or their tunnel period because during those 400 years they had more prophets they had no inspiration or Revelation the dreams the things that were taking place before was not happening they did not know and they were persecuted from Nation to Nation ruled by Greece ruled by Persia ruled by this one that one until the last one before Jesus came was Ro and so we find out that during that time they didn't have any real Pillar of Fire appearing or anything like that don't you see the type when the Holy Ghost is taken no more Revival no more Holy Ghost Revival no more real anointed PR things no more of these kind of things taking place but it will be like h on Earth because the demons will be loose now nothing there to hinder them no s to hold back the corruption and everything will be going wild brother said it shall come to pass the entire world will go insane it's already going insane with what you're seeing on heing on television the people have got to be mad they got to be mad and these people cling to be intelligent and their intelligence is a form of blindness and it's getting them mad what they call light is darkness and here we see it right now in our day it's equivalent Genesis 613 and God said unto do the end of All Flesh is come before me for the Earth is what filled with violence through them and behold I will destroy them with the Earth Matthew 2437 to39 as Jesus was breaking as Jesus was giving forth the Seven Seals in tight in parabolic form but as it was as the days of Noah so shall it be also at the coming of the son of man for as in the days that were before the flood there were eating partying drinking marrying and giving in marriage amen giving in marriage you know what that means that mean that's giving themselves to one another they just live with whoever they live and call it a marriage that's what is telling you here in other words shack up yeah right they're just going to shack up and they're going to call that marriage and everything else man with man yes you know oh my you know Adam and Steve think about it instead of Adam and Eve they changed the whole mixture of everything else amen that change the word of God instead of male and female genders they got male female and utter gender and of course it can't produce nothing else because it's already neutered it can't produce nothing else but thanks be to God hallelujah that the word of our God will stand forever than and they were eating drinking marrying and giving in marriage the entire world become one big party place is that right ha he he he on the television Comics jokes everything else laughing at preachers mocking at the oldfashioned preacher they want a modernistic style preacher with robes and dressed up and everything else modernized they don't want some backwards preacher or a preacher that preach in a backwards manner with all with an all rifle praise God Hallelujah with a one shot rifle that can hit a dime at 200 yard no they want a man with a scatter gun scatter gun that when he fir he hit something but he don't know what he hit oh my think about it glory to God so we got to come right back to the world the end is come the end is come it watch for thee behold it is come upon thee amen praise God brother the Bible tells us that they were eating drinking marrying and giving in marriage until until mm until the day that Noah entered into the AR Noah Noah was a noer of the word m k n o w e r of the word word he brought the Revelation for his day on who do you think is know today it's you amen and the Ark is the word amen praise God until the day that this Rapture takes place and pulls us out of here they're going to be eating and drinking and mocking and laughing and I thought you said Rapture was going to come I thought I thought you Jesus was coming again I thought this and that was going to happen but until that day yes and when we are missing out to here they're going to realize that there's an ingredient an ingredient gone from the cake and it's is not tasting good anymore the sweetness gone out of it the love gone out of it the brotherly kindness gone out of it the temperance gone out of it godliness gone out of it the whole world gone crazy and The Taste isn't there anymore and then they're going to begin to realize that what we were telling them was the sin Lord amen God help those ones that heard a little bit of this and have belied it and was hanging in there then maybe they will come up as foolish virgins maybe they will come up as God make Believers but they'll have to go through some persecution to be processed and purified before they can be acceptable the God and accept a lesser position than sunship but to be servants to the bride however God has made a way of opening there who's going to feel that we do not know but you have better make in this day and in this hour your calling and your sure of the word of the Living God the Book of Genesis says 63 my spirit will not always strive with them in other words this day of opportunity for salvation no it's not always going to be open the the doors are going to be shut you know brother old song it goes something like this if I can give it voice what then what then when the Great book is open what then when the ones that rejecting my message today will be asked to give a reason what then what then then when the Great book has open what then when the on that's rejecting the message today will be asked to give a reason what are you going to say that amen so they're going to be presented with that the end is come the end is come it's watching it's waiting for you oh praise God and behold we are living in the day when the end is come Ezekiel 76 amen amen thirdly not only the end of dispens the end of Nations not only the end of dispensations but the end of God given opportunities Hallelujah many of us know that opportunities come into our lives naturally and spiritually of course I'm speaking also of the spiritual opportunity of entering into the grace of God through the doorway called the Lord Jesus Christ and when we have an opportunity we have to season you cannot delay you know when I was in New York I was there with brother Neville Alexander a minister Pentecostal Minister that was very useful in my life a real blessing to me later on I witnessed to him and he became a Minister the message until the day he uh went to be with the Lord we were brought in New York to visit with Brother Joseph Colman at the time and uh uh he he love to walk early in the morning before the sun really Rises up really brightly so uh went out on the street and he was walking and while he was walking his foot picked something and it was a large round paper bag and when he kicked it it opened and it was watts and watts of cash in it choed full you know what happened in New York people find jewelry on the on the tra tracks they find bags of money because when the crooks are you know sharing their money if the police suddenly thr the corner they run and the bag is left and none of them want to go back in case the police find them and charge them and somebody will come along maybe find that money recently in New York a young boy kicked something like that on the on the train track or going to school early in the morning um and um they kept it for a year or so whatever the period of time and gave it to him and his mother they change their life completely so in this gu brother Alexander was walking and he kicked the bag there was all this money and he stood there looking at the Mion looking up to see you know any window anybody's going to see him while he's thinking about it a woman comes along you know how this woman walk her too late then he runs back to the house and he's telling me about it I said all you had to do was grab it your own you is that right Prophet says act upon the word of God if you want to see the Miracles of God and receive the bless God does not like conservative he so conservative you don't want to act he says act immediately if you don't act he said I know better than to delay because then the devil is going to begin to put things in your mind to make you even hesitate even more he says but when you get the thought act upon the word of God if you want to see the miracles of god amen hallelujah and friends I'm saying the same in natural life when opportunity of what it don't tell it no grab a hold of it if you want to release it later you can release it but now I got it the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and the violent Tak in by God Force you got to grab it by the neck Hallelujah any of you having some opportunity of faing this week is there some decision you got to make hallu something that you have to do grab a hold of it praise God hallelujah God give opportun SE they're going to pass you by and that particular opportunity never come your way again you may get another one but that one may not come your way so whatever opportunity you're facing now don't stop thinking about it act upon the word of God seiz it and receive the blessing heart and Inus name we have as a church we have an opportunity to be the last part of the church age to reap the end time Harvest I believe we have to plan we have to think we have to come with strategies and we have to act upon the word of God to seize this great opportunity that is before us to be able to be the Reaper of the Harvesters of the end time harvest in this hour John 4:35 Jesus said say not ye there are yet four months then comes the Harvest behold I see unto you lift up your eyes look on the fields for there are already white and ready for the Harvest praise the name of the Lord amen God is giving us this opportunity brother and sisters it's now or never amen hallelujah you can't do this after the Rapture we have to do it now we have to do the job now and I'm calling my soldiers under my guidance here Amen to come to attention as the prophet used to say to the word of God Amen of attention to the word of God and let salute the word of God act upon the word word of God and watch the word of God come to pass in our midst and in our individual lives Hallelujah for the glory of God John 9:4 I must work the works of him that sent me while this day for the night cometh when no man can work Hallelujah is that wonderful amen praise God let me back up a little bit here we now fa the fall of the American Empire how many recognize that that's she is honey and being eaten out amen by the PS are eating out like uh the ants that eat the wood out of a house yeah I've literally seen in Africa and in the southern climates where you have these wood eating ants yes there's a solid looking post a solid looking house and when you go you lean on it your elbow goes right through the wood because they eat out everything and leave a false fren facad yes that makes it look like it's solid yes but it's not solid it's empty it's shallow yes then then the Christians look like Christians empty shallow because the C the world time world the cater the buxs eat out the foundation and so with the nation all the foundations that was built upon out amen by his Wicked BS amen and we love we see the American Empire amen falling in every possible way look I looked up there before I came here researched on it the reasons for the fall of the Roman Empire and I I got about several reasons here one bad Emperors the Emperors became bad because they were having all kind of sexual ories and parties and drinking some of them were playing kill crazy Cula and the Nero was a mad man playing music you know caught up saying he's educated playing classical music while Rome is burning and people screaming and hollering and many others you know vaspian and so on different Emperors of Ro there bad leadership yes is that right yes bad leadership don't you see the same thing occurring right now again yes in the sense that American leadership from the time of of Abraham Lincoln George Washington Andrew Jackson it's it's deteriorating it's getting worse it's getting worse it's getting worse it's getting worse it's now g into the Cs brothers and sisters amen hallelujah amen and this is not left to one man you can put it on one man because he's mounting it but the whole thing is going down to the BS and we see the Empire falling right now so bad emper was one reason the second reason was economic troubl taking place because of over Reliance on cheap labor slave labor that's exactly what was in the book but I'm telling you they're bringing down wages to the point where people can hardly exist yes this is what this is saying Rome fell that was one reason why Rome fell because the people started getting desperate and they couldn't live anymore I'm not going to go deep in these things just give you them the next one was the rise of the Eastern Empire of Rome which means endless political in fighting the nation start fighting within itself what did Abraham Lincoln said a nation divided against itself it canot stand amen maybe he was prophesying but this is exactly what's going on now it's inviting it's not look brother BR he says don't worry about the the the uh Robin That's speaking the word that's speaking on the outside of the of the Apple New York which is symbolic of the whole United States he says you worry about the worm that's on the inside eating at the core yes yes don't worry about oh the K Trump you're going to fire rocket this one is going to do that that's not the thing you need to worry to much about he says you worry about the invasion of the United States of America from the inside am amen that's what you need to be worried about amen the next thing is overand I and Military overspending do you know that all the most powerful nations of the world the United States spends eight times more than all of them put together that is why you hear President Obama says what are what are they talking about you think China or Russia or one of them are stupid enough to try to attack us they're spending on their military budget when you add eight of those powerful Nations together it just start coming close to the American military budget it's just that they they are spending on more sophisticated technology so they don't have to have a bulk of a army oh Kim Jam has a million men a million men why you need a million men when I can fire two missiles and white a million men you see so this is why when uh Romy was saying we need to expand the Army we need to do this we need you you're cutting down the Air Force you're cutting down on the on the battleships and stuff he says Mr Romney you don't understand the time has changed one of our that our modernized aircraft carriers of bhip now can take out the whole Fleet of those ones you're talking about so we don't need as many right cuz they're sending out planes they're sending out guided missiles they're sending out all kinds of stuff from off of there it's like one big Armory like that so that's where we are over expansion on over spending on military budget government corruption and over taxation can somebody say amen I know some of you not over tax you want to pay more more I government corruption over taxation am the next thing for you know Mass migration because of War are we are you seeing something here mhm in other words when Rome was at its height War took place Germany was attacked by what by the Euro Asians which means to say I don't know if it was um if it was um um the H or whatever but they were attacked and and uh they were being overrun Spain and all those places were being overrun by these people and as such
