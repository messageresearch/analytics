name i'm so happy for this wonderful privilege but here in the word of god we will talk about jesus the king of kings is he will soccer talk about our lord and have a time of rejoicing together in him blessed be the name of the lord well many years ago my wife and i once visited a beautiful concert hall to enjoy the artistry of a marvelous christian group of singers called the blind bo five blind boys of alabama and there we sat in the semi-darkness of the great concert hall the curtains were closed the place was in semi-darkness when suddenly the curtains were pulled back and the artists the flying five blind boys came into view the lights came on the music came and the singing began oh it was wonderful uh artistry to see and to hear and to experience what was going on with them and what they could do you see before they began the curtains were closed but when they were ready to display their artistry uh their greatness uh they wanted to demonstrate what was in them then the curtains were pulled apart and they turned on the light and there they were in plain view with clapping and rejoicing because here were these wonderful artists well let's read from genesis chapter one verses one two three another great artist the greatest of all in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the waters face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light let us pray as we come to the lord's great table of his feast of this last day that we may partake of the bread of life our loving eternal father we come with our souls rejoicing we come with our hearts ready to receive what you have in store for us oh loving father we come home to thee and now your children want to sit around your throne sit at your feet lord and to receive the bread of life from the lips of our lord jesus christ by the holy spirit bless us together we pray with thankful hearts in jesus name amen and amen glory be to god hallelujah so they pulled back the curtains when they wanted to bring these great artists into view now i had already written down this topic and a few days ago started to work on this when i was moved to go into my library and there i was looking for a certain bit of information but while i was looking for that my hand fell on a book and i looked to see what it is i touched and there i felt to open that book so i opened it and when i opened the book my friends there was the very scene of this message that i had written on the page of that book at least uh 15 20 years ago and it is this when god rolls back the curtains and it came because at the time i read this marvelous quotation from brother william marion branham this great servant and prophet of the living god and this is what he said it was in the month of march 1945 one morning around 3 am that our lord jesus christ gave me a vision and he has done that many times at the beginning of this vision i was walking north east on a road when the spirit turned me and pointed me westward i was facing a great mountain it seemed to be the mountain of the lord looking to my left i saw a small heap of smooth fresh baked bread and there were some white fowls standing near the bread but they would not eat much of the bread then the lord said to me do you know them i said no lord then he said this is your tabernacle and they will not eat the bread of life anymore i am sending you now this way then i continued to journey on westward i was then brought to a plane plane and there was a platform erected there seemingly it was under a a tent or or some auditorium there were curtains drawn on the back of that platform and the lord told me he says pull back those curtains oh praise god and when i did i saw a great mountain of bread of of bread the bread of life and then he said go feed them and turning around i saw a lot of white robed people amen coming from everywhere making up a large audience now this is from the first book or booklet that brother branham ever wrote the book that is called i was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision it's not around now as far as i know but a lot of the older brothers may still have copies of it i didn't realize that i even had it and then like i said preparing this message already come down feel urge to come down and my hand fell on this book which was closed and my heart said open it so i opened it and there was this very theme or topic written from around 1981 it was written already on that page my let me quote again god has always in every age he has always hid behind a veil curtains behind a veil through all ages but he's still being god all the time even though he's behind the curtain he is still god all the time but he just kept himself hid from the world and reveals himself to his elected like he did with the apostles at that day now god was in christ speaking in christ you see one of my first books i ever published was called i was not disobedient to the heavenly vision this is 1954 and he is referring back to this booklet that he wrote since 1945. now he's referring to it oh praise god now listen 1960 help me lord because i sincerely i seek sincerely to know your will that i might bring it do it and bring it as you showed to me many years ago when i left the church the bread of life to all the to the peoples of the world and when i saw that great mountain of bread and them white robe saints coming from all over the earth not fowls but white robbed saints type of the bride they come from all over the earth to eat the this bread of life oh god let me lord let me never fail to feed the people on this bread of life blessed be the name of the lord i just wanted to give you the background that you might understand where it is that i'm coming from that god the great father of light the father of spirits was already living behind a curtain of darkness and when the time came the spirit moved and pulled aside the curtains all blessed be the name of the lord he pulled back the curtains on what on his creation like a great artist will cover his great work with a dark cloth or something from prying eyes and then pulls the that off at the right time and then his great creation comes into plain view and everyone can see what he was working on behind in the shadows he was working on a masterpiece now i want to take you to see god always hides behind curtains hides in simplicity and reveals himself in the same so god with the children of israel god went behind the curtains of the tabernacle and there they saw the great pillar of fire which hung above them suddenly come down and went into the tabernacle and as you know the scripture says the pillar of fire went behind the veil into the holy of holies and that pillar of fire stood right above the ark of the covenant between the wings of the cherubims there was the place of that great pillar of fire all the time behind the curtains and only the priests were allowed to go in there behind that curtain thank god he's going to have a people that are all kings and priests unto the living god that will be allowed to go in behind the veil behind the curtains to see that god whom they serve though blessed be his name and so the purifier was behind the curtain and it covered up this great mysterious light was was just covered up by simple curtains which as you know was not made with all kinds of human beauty but got skins and badgers skins and sheepskins it was just skins and had it there when the god of heaven could have had the richest the best everything else but he chose to use the skins of ordinary animals to cover his great eternal glory in the tabernacle there he was oh praise god hallelujah then my friends we understand that he was not going to always stay there because the bible tells us in the book in the gospel of matthew chapter 27 verses 50 and 51 speaking about the crucifixion of our lord and then the bible said he lifted up his voice and cried and he gave up the ghost and the scriptures tell tells us when he gave up the ghost the earth shook the mountains shook there were great earthquakes and the bible says the curtain of the tabernacle the synagogue or temple was shown it was torn cut from top to bottom oh praise god what god had pulled back the curtains on jesus his word oh praise god amen i believe we are living in this same season now the word was gone through another crucifixion and now come to a resurrection that word god pulled the curtains pulling the curtains off of his word hallelujah and it just happens that god is looking for white raw people oh people that will what what white raw people those of whom the 24 elders said oh praise god who are these with robes in white oh these are they who wash their robes in the blood of the lamb and made them white in the blood of the lamb oh glory to god hallelujah amen now my friends i could be labor or spend time on that quotation i use but i don't want to do that i my my my real object was to come to the place in that quotation where the lord said to brother branham saw the white fowls that were around the back bread already and could have just act as much as they wanted they just took a little bit and left the rest there so now here comes this great storehouse this mountain of bread that is there and god created another platform for him and he found a platform on the planes and there it was already built erected is the word he used and he said it had curtains but the voice said pulled back those curtains and so he the part curtains were pulled he pulled the curtains back hallelujah and and here they come those white robbed ones come running he says from everywhere they were running to do what to eat from that mountain of bread he said which was the bread of life glory to god i want to thank god my friends that i believe i caught sight of that bread of life i believe that i'm walking and eating and running towards it and eating from it and enjoying it and praising god for it but oh thank god that bread was behind the veil oh but thank god he pulled back the veil so that i could recognize the word the revealed word now because the veil is pulled back from my heart my eyes your heart your eyes and you could see the revelation of the word not the curtain over the word but the revelation of the word i want to thank god because jesus was trying to do it for the apostles but they never caught on until they got to the upper room what what curtains was he trying to pull apart jesus was trying to pull apart the curtains of prophecy filled with shadows types symbols of things that were going to be and so he was trying did not moses say this did not isaiah say that oh and he caught it from the various prophets trying to let them see what was behind the curtains of prophecy but thank god when he did that they could not understand what he was saying only bits and pieces and they said lord how is it we understand what some of what you're saying what you're saying because unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom but unto them it's not given oh praise god you're on the inside there on the outside they they can't see what you are seeing unless they were ordained to see it oh praise god in our day and time praise god i don't know who will see who what see who is in and who is out i don't know that i cannot say i cannot make any differentiation i am just saying what i am seeing or praise god because as the prophet said they will see what it is time for them to see maybe god allows some of us to see a little ahead and others will be coming in later i don't know but i'm here preaching the word of god i'm bringing the anointed word of life to you let us eat from the storehouse let us eat from this mountain of bread let us partake from this great storehouse that god has for us oh blessed be the name of the lord for the curtains are now pulled back and now he the word is in plain view oh behold the mighty conqueror he has rent the veil into he has pulled the curtains apart i've said he's pulled the curtains of prophecy that we can see the manifestation of prophecy taking place in our time until we can recognize that we are part of that prophecy hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord glory to god amen hallelujah amen yes god speaking through jesus christ telling them about the curtain of prophecy and there he was walking amongst them hid behind the curtain or the curtain of the skin of a man called jesus oh my glory to god and there was god behind that skin veil of the man called jesus christ but on that dark day of calvary when he gave up the ghost hallelujah glory to god when he gave up the ghost the curtain spotted and there he was the mighty god in christ god in plain view the great holy spirit now released to return back upon the disciples and let them feed from the bread of life which was stored up during his time on earth because they could grow back now and remember what he spoke with them what he tried to make known to them now it could make sense now it can make understanding now it could be revelation praise god because he had a mountain of bread also there waiting for them storing it up in his words in his sermons and his sayings and the things that he said at that day and time my friends think on these things as i speak and after i am finished speaking may the great holy spirit of almighty god take these words of life and continue to teach and to uh oh my friends just witness of his word to you not just my what i say but what the lord is saying right out of the word for yourself glory to god hallelujah amen so when he died dark day on calvary he gave up the ghost that was god parting the curtain to bring himself into plain view oh there i said he stands the mighty conqueror oh blessed be his marvelous name yes my friends glory to god hallelujah i want you to see friends sometimes god did at seven church ages and your during those seven church ages god was hiding in simplicity behind the curtains of time the mists the darkness of antiquity god in the shadows behind the curtains of time seven ages of past we have come through those seven ages and a new day has dawned upon us and the death star from an high has risen in the brightness and the scintillating ability of his his great splendor of his of his word is made manifest and chains upon us the great shaming light of god by the holy spirit amen shining upon this open bible and bringing it to life in our very sight in our very hearts in our homes wherever we are bringing the word of god to life oh glory to god hallelujah god hiding behind the curtain of time but then when it when that time came that time was to be over the bible said a mighty angel came down with a rainbow around his head whom we know to be the covenant angel who is jesus christ himself in that office oh my and there he comes and says time shall be no more in other words time has come to its end now i'm going to pull back the curtains of time oh glory to god how did he do it he used the prophet of malachi 4 5 william marion branham glory to god amen and use him through to pulls until this time of the manifest beginning manifestation of the third pull which is now in progress all glory to god hallelujah and work through that vessel veiling himself again in our day oh my and bringing forth his word his voice his promises his revelations of himself and when the hour was right then he parted that curtain left the scene brother branham went home but the word the message that he preached the bread that he baked the the food that he stored up comes into view glory to god and the white robe saints the believers the true believers genuine elected saints of god wherever they are whoever they are that is not my my uh i don't have to know that i don't know who they are but god knows them and he will direct his word right in their pathway and reveal themselves to them you hear me speaking over and over again and i'm talking about the word you hear me use the term revealed word revealed word it just sounds like you're just repeating yourself but no friends i'm seeing something on the inside that maybe you don't recognize us yet but soon all god saints all god's elect all god's people of the bright class are going to be in the same little room that he spoke about amen yes sir and in that little room they'll hear all the love secrets in that little room he'll whisper in their heirs whisper to them things in the night in the darkness of the night his voice his power his spirit amen will make himself known and reveal his word to you and through you for his glory and for his honor blessed be the name when god pulls back those curtains none can shut them friends because he is the one that opened the curtain and none can shut it because you're seeing it you're in it you are part of it glory to god he is the word and you become a part of that word and you know yourself you know the word you he you know him and he will reflect back on the earth that he knows you praise god you're recognized you're identified you're confirmed you're sealed by the spirit of the living god amen hallelujah amen yes sir god pulled back the curtains of time and we are able to see him in this great time oh and thank god for a prophet coming on the scene and preaching to us and saying oh saints of god we have got to come out of our spiritual amnesia you see god allowed us to be that way oh so that he could hide behind the curtains of memory oh but as we say in a little song roll back the curtains of memories no and then show me where you brought me from and where i could have been remember i'm human and humans forget so remind me remind me dear lord oh thank god he has rolled back and he is rolling back the curtains for many who have eyes to see and ears to hear the holy spirit is doing his great work in this season of convocation and manifestation of the third pawn of the word itself amen signs and wonders are marvelous wonderful they are sparks of the anvil they're just products of the word they're things that just happen they're supposed to follow you you don't chase after them they just happened when you are there in the world you have the word is with you and in you glory to god oh my the word itself is the attraction in this hour amen oh he wants to know do you love me enough that you love me for myself or do you love me for my gifts or do you love me for my power my influence or the position i hold not the president of a company but the god of eternity yo my friends is that what you just love him because he's no he wants you to see him like he's an ordinary guy and you still love him you don't care what you know there is something back there you recognize the word of god for your day the message for your day hallelujah oh my yes sir and so god's by this message of this last day has set forth his word to do what roll back the curtains of your memory and to show you where you come from remind you bring back to your spiritual recognition you are not a man of earth you are not just children of time you come from the bosom of god you come from eternity you're on a journey you're going back to eternity the great holy spirit of almighty god testifying from his own word pulling back the veil from off the walls of your memory that you might walk down memory road once again friends all the paths of memory once again that you might hear his familiar voice and come to yourself recognize your day recognize the call of your shepherd recognize the spirit's cry oh my hallelujah oh my friends many have wondered say oh brother simon your voice sounds like this maybe your boy how did it come i don't know god creates us makes us a certain way for a certain job oh and a certain sound for his glory for his honor hallelujah and he rolls back the curtains of memories that we might come out of our spiritual amnesia or misinformation dislocation from truth oh my friend misinformed and everything else we've gone away from the word back to the word back to your original position back to your father's house when you come back to him like a prodigal your father is not standing at the door to condemn you for there is no condemnation to them who are in christ jesus oh blessed be the name of the lord he is happy his sons his daughters his children they're coming home they're coming from the east they're coming from the west they're coming from the north they're coming from the south and he's happy they're coming home he has no time to condemn them he has just wants to oh welcome them rejoice with them come you faithful come you loving children of my father all praise god forevermore as he invites you into his divine presence of this great the sea of divine love o blessed be the name of the lord o blessed be god forevermore yes sir so we see how that in the message called the masterpiece the sermon he said often times as i referred before an artist would have a painting a glorious piece of work but it would be covered up and veiled until the time of display my my my oh friends i want you to know that he is the same god for in i believe it's around page seven or eight of the unveiling of the mighty god he said brother branham speaking he says now many of the things that i have said and done were deliberately said and done to cause some to go out amen and i say from this message and then he says and to cause others to come in some to wonder and to ponder and you may say would god do a thing like that yes he did and yes he still does yes and god allows them to be purposely said and done amen hallelujah oh so that only the elect will be able to see through those things amen then he uses the court when he says don't you know that is why jesus said hit my flesh drink my blood amen what was he doing he said he was sending out his crowd oh deliberately purposely sinning out the crowd amen yes sir oh those who could see oh they said lord whither shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life oh standing by the truth standing by the word no matter what because there's something back there even though intellectually they might not be able to explain it expound it or they might not be able to theologize on it analyze it debate it whatever but they feel enough the moving in their heart they have a witness that there is something back of that veil something back of those curtains oh glory to god hallelujah but when the time comes for a quick short work when the time comes for a display of the holy spirit and of the bride oh my then what happens the the curtains are pulled off that you can see god in his glory on the word praise god hallelujah time for display time for the veil to come off the masterpiece time for the veil to be lifted off of them oh my glory to god hallelujah veiling as a masterpiece but thank god the veil is ripping and renting hallelujah and is starting to reveal him and reveal his face christ revealed in his own word making himself known hallelujah oh my yes sir we know that this lord jesus christ this great eternal being amen oh hallelujah i will as i read and prayed today and the holy spirit showing not just the word but the spirit word the spirit in and of the word must come forth hallelujah amen and make himself known to you glory to god hallelujah amen for the word the logos was veiled by this message amen i mean the the written this words of the message is just a veil for the logos so the logos was very and has been veiled and to the eyes of many still yet veiled but thank god the field the harvest fields of god is beginning to ripen and one part is ripening others don't know what's happening what's going on but soon maybe it'll reach you i don't know that's in the hand of the living god for this rightening harvest of this end time harvest the holy spirit is doing his evangelism now as he brings them in from the field of sin of unbelief religious unbelief not that just worldly sin of the world but the unbelief hallelujah the sins of jezebel the sins of the old harlot the sins of judas the sins of esau the sins of cain all all those sins that are looked so close to christianity amen but contrary to the word of god the holy spirit has turned on the light and the shining light of the holy spirit my friends the great death star shining on the word brings it to life amen praise god forevermore oh there's a revival going on not a revival of masses of people and numbers but i'm a part of that revival that revivals in me that revival is in many others who believes wherever they are some of them i never met i don't know but there's got to be men women people around this world that's hearing and seeing the same thing by the manifestation of the holy spirit and the supernatural power of god who made known his word to the apostles back then oh praise god holy men of god wrote the word of god as they were inspired by the holy spirit and the same holy spirit has come again to inspire to anoint and to use men and women of god for his glory and for his honor glory to god so the logos was veiled by this message and a lot of folks just felt satisfied as long as they quoted the word form as long as they quoted the word form as long as they said exactly what the prophet said word for word their feeling is they got it oh all you got my friend is i gotta hold to the curtains all you got my friend is the curtains of darkness oh but oh ask god for a rising of the sun ask god like he said to brother branham don't just stand there pull back the curtains oh he said i pulled the curtains back and the people come running clothed in white robes or praise god amen amen yes sir oh hallelujah amen that mighty angel of revelation 10 1 came down hallelujah and veiled himself in revelation 10 7 o hallelujah and begin to speak the word not adding to the word not bringing something it's new to your ears it might sound like it's you but it's the same word of god the unwritten part of the word hallelujah a veil is coming off of that blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah oh praise god oh i tell you my friends the voice of the mighty angel those seven thunders utter voices pulls back the curtain on time pulls back the curtain of spiritual darkness pulls back the curtains of prophecy it pulls back my friends all those curtains amen and you are able to see him the word in all of his scintillating beauty oh thanks be to god hallelujah amen this message is the veil and so the logos was veiled and is still veiled to some many by the message and only the great holy spirit can lift the veil from your eyes and let you see only the holy spirit when he has come oh he is going to teach you he's going to reveal to you he's going to make known himself to you by the opening of the word hallelujah oh praise god hallelujah who could have ripped that curtain from top to bottom in the holy of holies when no man could enter there it had to be the angel of god himself rip the curtain from top to bottom and when this curtain of the word is rep listen the holy spirit rips it and you can see beyond the curtains of prophecy right from genesis right revelation for the things that are going to be why because the curtain is now open god himself has pulled back the curtain and you can see the word of god in its clarity in its purity my friends distilled by the hand of the one who gave the wine at the wedding feast the last part of the face oh praise god the supernatural stimulation by revelation through the opening of the word strikes the heart of the sons and daughters of god rip the whole veil from top to bottom and in our day rip the whole veil from genesis right through to revelation by the holy spirit himself hallelujah that's god himself now pulling back the curtain and we are able to see him and now here we see the next step or the last stage of it the holy spirit comes and he clothes the bride he clothes her with the word and the word becomes a curtain that hides her in simplicity oh and reveals her in the same by the baptism of the holy spirit the holy spirit himself come to live within you to quicken you to work with you move through you manifest himself through you for behold the habitation of god is with man and there shall be my people and i shall be their god one day said the prophet they'll know the god they seek is within them oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah amen yes sir so this bride had onward veil she was veiled veiled by not understanding prophecy not understanding the flow of time not understanding all of the sign symbols that were back of the actual curtain of the old tabernacle she was blinded if i i'm not preaching on that but blinded in our day by traditions blinded by rituals blinded by theology blinded by all these various forces that were coming and she had the veil on but the time for the invisible union of the bride and christ the word the invisible person christ on the scene oh he alone the holy spirit has the right the privilege or to lift her veil and claim her by the voice of the seven thunders her little heart begins to peace with anticipation with joy oh praise god because here is the one her dearest that she loves with her heart all her soul and her mind oh she loves him the word and she gives him the greatness of her love the fullness of her love the fullness of our faith of our belief of our all in all and so she receive the seven kisses from this great prince of life hallelujah and our heart with seven thunders oh my just beats hallelujah as she comes alive and wakes up out of our spiritual amnesia what are you talking about brother simon you if you know you'll understand oh praise god hallelujah claims her he claims her by the seven thunders the seventh thunder mystery is no longer a mystery it's a revelation of the word to the heart of the elected saints of the living god amen oh yes the rapture that was hid behind the curtains of misunderstanding and mystery perfection perfect faith all these various truths of god have been fully restored back to the church hallelujah but being restored doesn't mean you have it it's like brother branham himself said in the seals yes the seals have been broken amen oh praise god and yes they've been broken but have they been revealed to you you say oh they're revealed yes but are they revealed to you then christ is the mystery of god revealed then if you claim he says that it's been revealed to you and it's not manifesting through you and you can't see that life manifesting through there you've got the wrong revelation go back and check your revelation again all broken revealed and now manifested oh we're living in manifesting time oh the fruits are on the vine glory to god and here he comes the mighty one into plain view before the our eyes hearts are our hearts eyes all blessed be the name of the lord the rapture perfect faith in those things that seem that they were behind the curtains of time the curtains the mystic curtains of memory out of our spiritual amnesia god is pulling back the curtains hallelujah and there the great artist has come now when the edges are over and so he's pulling back the curtains and revealing to us what he has done for six seals and history and all those things beyond and what he is doing seventh seal broken revealed and now manifesting all blessed be the name of the lord my friends may the lord bless you real good this is not a as you would say uh a classic way of of ending a sermon oh oh my goodness brother sister but look i've come through all that all the great theologies all the great greek and hermeneutics and this and that and the other but are we i'm just here to tell you the word of god and let the word of god weigh in your mind roll back the curtain of
