TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] it's good to be the house amen praise God you're blessed to be here to be tonight I know it's cold up there animal was a sacrifice temptation to stay warm just relax fireplace you know pour a nice hot tea but I'm tired God do something reader for us tonight because he promises to assemble with us every time that we [Music] praise God we're gonna read tonight from the book of Hebrews we're not going to keep you long we're trusting that we're just gonna have some time with the Spirit of God just to minister to our needs a little bit because that's what we come for Hebrews 11 from verses 1 to 6 it says now faith you need to do something with the mic here it's just bringing back faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a report through things we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith and you could just replace the word faith by revelation Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased but without revelation it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently we are so grateful tonight Lord every time we come into your presence and the assemble around new word and the word especially the word of this day in this power and God just excites our hearts that our souls and excites our spirit Lord to know that this is what excites you that your people can recognize what it is that you're doing the day that we're living in brings us into such unity father where we can be led by your spirit and we can fulfill the purpose of the plan that you have for each and every one of us Lord bless our time together tonight father we we just are under great expectation Lord that you will do something special one word from you [Music] blessed be your wonderful day bless us in your presence now we pray in Jesus in Bruce chapter twelve verse 1 it says wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith you know I want to talk today a little bit about having the faith to finish the race I believe that you know there you know when we think about races there's there's a lot of preparation that goes into a race you know what an individual training to run a race he goes and he you know he feeds properly he he he hydrates himself properly he exercises he you know he does all the necessary things to prepare his vessel to get his body into ultimate shape so that he can run the race because his desire to run the race is not just a book and robberies but to actually win and this is you know there always comes a point but you know you're at that final stage in the race where you need that certain amount of energy that you just that you have endurance when you train that when you've done what you know is necessary to cross that finish line you know all the things that that you sacrificed at the time that you sacrifice and the life that you left you know you gotta sacrifice you gotta give up certain things you know professional athletes they're not just doing the things that that you know other people are regularly out doing and you know eating whatever they want and just you know doing whatever they want no they take the time to actually feed right they take the time to do the things that they know they must do you know there's a scene that I've always heard and the same is this that you do what you gotta do what you gotta do it they will come you can do what you want to do what you want you know I know that there's coming a time when we going to be so set free that we're going to be having fellowship divine we're going to be not at all the I know it's easy to talk about it it won't like talk about the other side but it's a reality Saint the other side is a reality this is our goal this is what we strive for this is why we you know we give up the things of this world we give up certain things because we know that there's a great victory when the race is about what the race has done but we need like the scripture says to put aside all those things that so easily drops away from the focus and and then the purpose and the plan of God for each and every one of our lives so that we can finish the race but in order to finish the race you you need to know that your injuries you know you know just see spectators running it off the you know the audience and decide that they're gonna just decide to run that race they're gonna get pulled out of the water they're not gonna have a chance they need to be prepared [Music] there's so many ladies in the race and what the organizers prepare that race they exactly who's gonna be a great destiny he's going to be in the race so that's sort of when they get there they can take their position there's only going to be one but you need to know that you're in the race in order to win the race you need to know you're in the records there's a lot of races going on out there right now there's a lot of different Church interpretations of the Word of God and they're all leading to certain places there's Trinitarian baptism there's there's teachings up it'll mighty God Almighty God you've got all kinds of different interpretations these are all different races these people actually believe that there's no one in the race that there is but God he's not the author of confusion or darkness God has prepared a church in the last days that's gonna win the ultimate race you know when we think about the children of Israel the ones that doubt it they couldn't possibly live the race there's no way you can belt and win when you go into a race you've gotta have confidence you can't have a negative report you can't be negative and run in a race you try going into the race and saying oh I can't win this [Music] because you've already told yourself that you can't win the race you've got to have the right attitude you've got to know who you are and why you have been ordained to win and to perfect the faith that's in you in order to overcome and win the race I just want to talk to you tonight about faith to finish the race you know brother Branham talks about here in the easter cele says but if God said in this day back in the beginning John Doe will be my servant millions of years ago now turn dough is born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies because he's a mortal but maybe he gets a little religious feeling he'll go join the church maybe he'll join a Pentecostal church oh no he might join anything but let him get under the atmosphere of God once John Doe is bound to recognize who his father is just as that Eagle recognized he the mother was it got to realize it see only that junk know as God's attribute that's become a word spoken and then all these spirit seats that word out here it is he calls it gives him everlasting life and brings him into his presence it's God's work and you see what-what were you when you came into that atmosphere and you received the Spirit of God in your life at the right time at the right season it awoke something inside of me that was ordained to live they were dating that you are predestined to win this race and it's not the time to give up it's the time to stand it's the time to to continue to your position it's the time to allow the Spirit of God to mold you shape you and prepare you for what you have been ordained to achieve the finish line for the holes that are better outside the price seems impossible but to those that are in Christ those haven't been read birthed by the Word of God those that have been placed into a body into a church where they know that that God is placing and given them faith those people they have certain endurance they have a certain desire they think they want to serve God they want to get into their position frame to allow place them lead them into guide them so that they can fulfill the purpose in the plan God has ordained that you you're an attribute of God even you cannot fit you give up you cannot not win because you are ordained to finish this now we know that there's a time of the season for all things and here we are now we've done you know over fifty three years since the Prophet went off the scene and we're seeing the events that are taking place worldwide we're seeing the events that that that we've never seen before I don't know if you noticed it but every year there's there's like another historical you know historical breaking event something that happens that that's never happened before why because we are at a time where all things are gonna culminate and where there's going to be a people that's going to surface but we can have a certain level of faith to overcome dimension after living in you've been ordained to overcome this dimension because of the word that you've been given in the word that's placed in you you have to be a god that's in you is ordained to be changed to eventually change do you have to come into the atmosphere that God has prepared for you for that dimensional change to take place and how is it coming it's coming by faith it's coming by a word that's being released into your hearts and into your lives as you walk and as you you serve the Lord this faith is being released it's actually being released in you and through supernatural it brings us up inside of us because in that attribute is everything that you need in order to fulfill the purpose of God you're given a position in the body and you must actively involve yourself in that position is he recognizing who you are and knowing brother Graham said that they'll know what to do with the word is when you can actively get yourself in the position that God has given you by faith and operating in that position don't be looking for some super high you know Revelation position that's not what God is looking for God is looking for this that you can just recognize that you've been called and that you've been placed into this body now I'm going to read here it's not based on intellectual faith this is based of supernatural thinking this is the faith that goes beyond human understanding you cannot describe faith you cannot you know interpret faith because faith is what God reveals to you what he wants you to do amen so intellectual faith all right that's as far as the nominal Christian knows he hears the word he believes it he has a mental conception that's why we believe that but notice when the matter come to the waters of separation which was word he cometh by hearing hearing of the word we believe that God wants us to believe it that's part of it but that's as far as he ever gets he never gets into fellowship yonder he just comes through the water separation and when he comes to that part he finds a mental conception yes I believe thinks it's in his mind raises up his hand accepts it and twenty days from there he's in fact in the same room he was in the first place because it never any farther than is that's not the kind of thing that is going to produce a body change it's not that kind of faith the kind of thing that's going to give us the power to finish this race it goes it goes beyond it's the kind of thing that you you have a receiver to receive perfect faith comes by hearing the words if you look back in the book of Revelation it says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God revelations 2:11 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death you see all these promises that he's talking about here it's Gd and he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith is constant revelations 36 he then happened here even happened here than 3:13 he that hath an ear now notice in ephesians church age brother bill says it says the spirit is speaking to the churches that is plural not senior the spirit did not have John write this down for a local TV ginger CH North for the first page only is for all the church ages this Bennett is a message for every Christian through every age until Jesus comes yes it is for it is the spirit speaking he that happened here that him hear what the spirit saith under the term servus how tragic it is that the first age did not listen to the spirit instead it listened to them but they got in the last stage there will be a group rise up the true pride of the last day and she will listen to the spirit in that they have lost darkness the light will return by the pure word and he will return to the power of Pentecost the Lord Jesus Christ so the Holy Spirit in every age and progressing the word bringing us on to that perfect faith but this brings us on to the completion of the faith because the scripture said he's the author and the finisher so whatever he started in you he's gonna finish even happier that I'm here with the spirit saith unto the churches this is not one church age where this verse is not mentioned every single age has the same admonition to the people of every age he that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit said but it is absolutely impossible for all men to hear what the Spirit says to the different ages it's not possible that everybody's gonna receive what we receive therefore they can't finish this race it's not for everyone it's for you it's because God ordained it for you we see there's only one group of people that a very special group of people were able to hear what the Spirit says in each age it is one special group that we seize the revelation for each age that group is of God because that group because the group that cannot hear is not the group that can and thus hear what the Spirit is saying and we sees the revelation thereof is that group described in 1st Corinthians chapter 2 and so we're gonna read them it says howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to nought but when you look at perfect because we're talking about perfect faith it talks a full age brought to its end finished the kind of thing that you're receiving now which is going to produce this change is a perfect thing it's a supernatural thing it will override all the circumstances in your life it will override all the things that are good doing you right now we all have things that are better ahem you eNOS we also have situations that we don't want in our lives that you know that that you know it's called fear it's those things in our lives that they seem to have an evidence but their thoughts they did that's why fear is false evidence it appears real but it's false and we need to overcome those things but we can't we can't do it as human beings we can't do it as as intellectual believers we must do it by revelation No thank God we started the work in us is not going to fail he's not going to stop he's not going to quit he knows what needs to be done and each and every one of our lives and he will do it but we speak listening in jetan 7 Corinthians chapter 2 verse 7 he says but we speak the wisdom of God in mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory he ordained a certain about faith that we were going to need to finish this race right the very end you're gonna need perfect faith to pitch this race brother Richard we are going to need it and God has prepared it he's ordained it and it's going to come in its time and in its season and there's no way you're gonna miss it because it was for ordained before the world unto your glory it was worth a to you which none of the princes of this world knew for half they builded they would not have crucified the Lord of glory but as it is written eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love but God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things so you see here that God prepared a level of faith for each and every one of you in order to overcome this dimension and in order to win this race for let them know what the things of God or what and the things of Matt save the spirit of Man which is in him even so the things of God will no man but the Spirit of God he see it's the Spirit of God that's in you it's that it's that election from before the foundations of the world that was placed in you that knows the things of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but the Spirit which is of government that we might build things that are freely given to us of God which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teaches but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God for they are foolishness unto you neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who have known the mind of the Lord that he Stockton but we have you see there's a big difference when God graduates you and places you into the body of Christ to fulfill his plan and purpose for your life in the summary interchange brother Brown talks about he told us the evidence or what would happen after being baptized with the Holy Ghost was that we would have the teacher come and teach all truth but that teacher was inside and inside of us everything that you have either many of you are facing certain situations maybe it's a health issue maybe it's you know a financial issue you know relationship issues whatever it is God has placed inside of you everything that you have either and he's he's saying I am the teacher I am the inner teacher that's gonna give you the faith that's going to give you the instruction it's gonna give you everything that you have Nina amen not an outside teacher if the spirit does the inside you wouldn't hear the truth and we seen it by revelation if you heard it every moment of the day you can read this Bible from front to back you can listen to brother messages you can feed constantly but if that inner teacher is not inside which is the Holy Ghost that you received when you were awakened by the Spirit of God by the spirit spoke and the prophecy came forth and called you into your position if that they didn't take place if that season didn't come in your life you would be able to receive this you would be able to overcome you would be able to know what to do it just be another Church memory you just be like anybody else up there just join the church become a member in a church there's a lot of people here becoming members of church it's not about being a member it's about being a son or daughter of God not the Spirit of God lives in you thousan you that direction got you it leads you praise God that was the side of the imploding spirit in the days of Pop those who were filled with the Holy Ghost heard the word received it and lived by you never aim to live this word you could ordained to overcome this by mention you've been ordained to live this race there's nothing that can stop you now you're gonna do this II just need to believe that you are what God said that you are [Music] not every promise that God made to you you can fulfill that promise because greater is He that is in you than he that is in great glory to God those who did not have the spirit heard it only as Carmel men putting on a rug interpretation and they live and they continued in sin you would continue in sin if it wasn't for the attribute that God placed in you from before the foundations of the world it'd be just like anybody else you go out there and you would live just like the rest of the world and you would have a religious spirit and you could think because you know they say if you just confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord you will be saved you know they did watered down the word of God but you can't deceive a son or daughter of God you can't be fooled by something like that you know that there's more the church you know disciple I you know now I can see them on religious and I've joined the church it's more than that to you it's a reality because you know that God is a part of your your entire life everything that you do you think about what's possible you don't look at your circumstances and see that you know I hope I can do it know if you're a separate daughter of God you've been retained to overcome in this hour you should have the kind that allows you to walk through every situation regardless of what it is you listen you know you might think as a kernel individual that that is not possible but we're not looking at those things since when did we look at circumstances according to the Word of God where it said some things are possible it didn't say some things it said all things are possible that's what we come into the church that's what we come here every Wednesday every Sunday we try we try to get into the presence of God because we know that the Word of God that's be spoken right now by the Angels giving us faith to overcome in this life and circumstances seem to be things that we can't do because this is a fitness and this is a season or there's going to be people that are gonna literally disappear from this earth and beautiful bugs that are going to disappear all these events all these situations you know like I say all the time there's gonna be a day you know I keep saying to my wife and said well maybe you know you don't need you know this situation because we [Music] morning and sometime between you know brother said so morning you know maybe around yeah there's gonna be a sweet spirit of god that's gonna sweep down over your life you're gonna give that anointing that's gonna lift you up so much you're gonna be changed right there in bed and we're gonna believe this dementia-related behind the pressures of this right because listen Saints my god or cuz of the under pressure especially the pride we're constantly under pressure but because we're supposed to be under pressure it's because we are being squeezed out of this dimension we're being pushed by the Word of God there's a Word of God that keeps coming to us as sons and daughters of God that's giving us a faith to push out of this dimension it's a supernaturally that there's a there's a there's a there's a power that's being released released by the preaching of the word because cometh by hearing not hearing words but receiving the Lobos of God the word that can change you because it's going to take a supernatural word that's gonna change it's going to take a supernatural that's because the Spirit of God speaks it's you know looking at ability listen I wasn't even supposed to preach here tonight I wasn't supposed to preach here tonight it was all set up you know another minister was supposed to be here but then certain things happened and I meet a certain estate you know when I when I set up the schedule and I missed a certain thing God knows and you know like why should I fear why what should we be afraid if I tell bastard assignment another brother it's not a maybe I could step in you know it's not a matter that he could step in or that I could step in but because there's a faith that's moving right now [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] the certain faulty certain times of the right time of the day and he takes that tone tini takes those carbohydrates there's certain things [Music] [Music] [Music] he knows that all these are not possible he knows that by the power of the enemy it literally changed demon power [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] those who have the spirit the teacher they heard the word the reason why you can you can you can go vision seen tonight is because you were here [Music] because because he was there's nothing everything is bleeding on God's time this season that's it that's what we put in the scripture he says to everything to everything he didn't say to some things are [Music] there's a power in due season it wasn't that brother branham had to preach all these messages so that they could store it up as food anybody can get all of those messages and there's a lot of people that listen to them three times or ten times more than you and they thought the Holy Ghost they've got the Holy Ghost so it's not matter just hearing those words that were spoken and reported in those messages that's why people said you just do look the Prophet said you just listen I just believe only what the Prophet said what about what the spirit saith unto the churches [Music] [Music] [Music] because it's the same yesterday today forever he does not change yes you can you can't take brother Greg out of the equation there's no way you could ever do it but the same God that was with brother branham's back in those meetings back there in 1933 all the way up to 1965 he's the same with us us to do the same thing once we get to the same rate he doesn't change don't looking for something new look for something real something that's gonna prove to you that you're gonna know that you're gonna know that you're gonna know that God's own reality he said he can do he can do it you should be able to leave here tonight regardless of the circumstances regardless of the body Halliburton and the condition to the peelings and everything else
