god there is something about that name blessed be the name of the lord god bless you real good please be seated just for a moment we want to thank god for his goodness we've all come through a real traumatic year and this covet culture seems to have set in on the entire world and it's transformed and changed um society and even changed individuals in the way of acting and thinking and we know that god is moving into another phase of his entire plan and we are just happy to be a part of what he is doing as long as we keep our mind our hearts in the word of god we know we'll be in our rightful position to bring glory and honor and praise his name we want to thank you very much for all the various um gifts and thoughts towards myself and wife for pastor appreciation i have to be honest with you i got home since that took place and i went home with one briefcase and i was so tired i put it down there and fell asleep in our chest of field and from then i've been using another briefcase and i did not go back to that original briefcase until i believe last week then i said oh my goodness oh so i want to thank you all for everything that you did for us and i want to give god the glory and praise amen also now here we are at this time of the year and i don't want you to get into a christmas spirit i don't want you to get into the church spirit uh i don't want you to get into the commercial spirit that gets you all caught up in the hype on the holly and the mistletoe and all that type of thing right and the jingle bells and dashing through the snow well these things are there there's no doubt about it the trees are there the christmas trees are there these things that they aaron it's wonderful you know the devil made an airplane and that will make all this stuff through science and god shows his servants how to use it because they turn around and use the airplane to go spread the god spell so now he's gone to rocket ship you know we'll see what else is going to happen but anyway whatever is there that they create and they call it christmas well we use it and we give god glory and praise um we don't curse it and cheer it down anything like that but we recognize it's wrong it's not according to the word but we still enjoy the season and the time because we know what it represents or who it represents in reality so here we find ourselves in the midst of a changing world and we remaining as the word unchanged and holding to god's unchanging hand praise the lord god bless every one of you thank you so much for your contributions much more can be said but my mind keeps going back to the word here now so but let's get to the word of god is that okay i think some of you are going to be uh leaving um during these holidays we're going to miss some of you and we pray that god will keep you safely take you safely bring you back again safely wherever you are or you may be right in town but you may be occupied with your family and things like that you know everything is tightened up now because of the latest variant of the virus and therefore they've tightened things up outside of churches it's down to 10 people but so far they've allowed and are allowing churches to go at 50 right so uh let's thank and trust god for whatever god is doing and don't uh again let me repeat my stand on the word don't listen to silly people who tell you they don't need to take the vaccines it is absolute ignorance nonsense and try to use the word of god to justify it saying that they have faith so they don't need to take it well you you're gonna have to dismiss a whole lot of scriptures i won't get into that now but you're gonna have to dismiss miss a lot of scriptures and get away from it by just saying oh i believe i believe don't worry with them even if you happen to be in the minority stay with the word stay in the house don't come out stay right there don't let that angel pass your way but stay inside of the house praise the lord may the lord bless you stay with your family enjoy your family and if you're used to being um with prayer like a person who is used to being alone with god and in prayer um you'll find that it doesn't make much difference much to them but those who are used to jumping around and running here running there running all the time and not a god having a chance to settle them down then you have a problem you'll have a problem in your spirit praise the lord however today i want to talk much not just about see people are looking at the birth of christ and they're looking back at jesus back there they don't realize that what we should be for god has allotted his word to each age there's a certain amount of the word has to be fulfilled in each age and this is the day when the son of man is being revealed again in the bright form so whose birth is it the one back there or hers which is really him revealed so we are celebrating that birth and especially because we are a part of that amen inside of this word of god part of him and here he is again according to his word that it would come to pass let's look in the book of hebrews chapter 11 we want to read verse 3 and we'll start from there praise the lord amen and let's have a real wonderful christmas time let us pray our gracious father we thank you for the uh by open bible we thank you for the reading of the word and we do pray father that the great holy spirit will anoint our hearts together and bless us as a family of gods sons and daughters of god rejoicing together not in heaven but in heavenly places in christ giving you glory as we did before the foundation of the world go father now we submit and surrender ourselves to you in jesus name amen true faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear praise the lord thank you lord for the reading of the word god bless you all please be seated by faith by revelation by faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god amen now we understand that when god made or created the earth uh this world the world let's use the world not earth because the earth is only part of god's world that he created and that world is made up of many universes galaxies suns moons stars endless layers and of various dimensions and so on that we are not even fully aware of the enormity of even the natural creation but the world was formed by the spoken word of god amen and we find out that the manifestation of god's word when god said let there be light and the bible says and there was light now light was a mystery because when god said let there be light if there was if there was anybody there where there was none uh they wouldn't know what light was light would be a mystery to them but when the light appears in the sky or wherever when they see this bright object they didn't have to ask what is light you see for the manifestation what is the interpretation amen that's what it is hallelujah now i want to go to brother branham's quotes here god is his own interpreter you know how many believes that amen see that's why paul said the word is of no private interpretation you see amen you see when god said let there be light there was light that was the interpretation of it amen see for the manifestation it was manifested and the manifestation is the interpretation it brings understanding so you will know what light is see when he said that it was in his mind before he said it see before he could say it it was in his mind it was in his thinking that there was such a thing as light and then he spoke it let there be light and the light sprung up across the skies that is the interpretation nobody has to give any interpretation of that because god has already given the interpretation and when god speaks it's manifested god makes a promise god unlocks his word or promises to each age and it comes down through the ages from beginning to end so much poor age so much for age and it keeps coming down see and the world has got these things mixed up and they have done it with all their traditions and mixed it up with so forth like that hallelujah and now we see this christmas season is all mixed up with traditions mixed up with satan's claws and mixed up with all kinds of uh uh old nick and uh mixed up with the tenon bomb and trees which the bible tells you in the bible there not to go out in the forest and cut them and nail them up so they can stand up and stuff like that in the book of jeremiah you'll find that right there where it tells you that but we are here like as i said not to celebrate the birth of jesus christ back there 1900 years ago but really with the clear understanding of the revelation of god's word she being a part of him and the head already having its birth there now it's her birth which is really the son of man being revealed again in this day and in this hour praise god hallelujah now just to give you some more background on that so we'll bring a clearer understanding god had spoken his word and told law he said it's not going to rain you've heard this before nobody knew what rain was there was no rain anywhere no such a thing as rain they had no idea so god's word was spoken through the mouth of a prophet hallelujah matter of fact there are certain parts in the bible where it calls the spoken word of a prophet for the mouth of the lord has spoken it amen right the prophet is counted like god's mouth all right speaking the word hallelujah so noah says reign praise god and they were all looking for whatever this rain was but they didn't believe law they didn't understand what he was saying they were misdefined by him talking about reign so when they rejected his word and the reigns began to fall it was too late because by then not just noah understood amen but everybody knew now what rain was but it was too late because the rain was already on the scene hallelujah and the manifestation of what was written was the interpretation of god's spoken word through that prophet noah amen hallelujah that's the way it was in the same way god spoke through the prophet isaiah and he said a virgin will conceive and bear a sound hallelujah praise god and when he spoke we know the scripture quoting is of no private interpretation when god said a virgin shall conceive and she did that just settles it right there see god himself is the one that does the interpretation many people may love him many people may even believe in him but yet when he speaks it's so much a phenomena that can't understand it when you talk about it see and being just the same as he was yesterday they couldn't understand him then they can't understand him now they claim they believe it but when it takes place right before them they don't understand it amen they can't believe it but it's the same thing happening happening again you understand one place here he says it's the same jesus christ yesterday today and forever hallelujah and the word making itself manifested so much to each age as it comes down hallelujah you see god has promised certain things for even this age that we are in and it has got to come to pass and what it does you don't need no interpretation for it you know you see the theologians are out all these seminaries are out you don't need that to get god's interpretation of what he's going to say or saying in his word for it is not of any private interpretation hallelujah praise god hallelujah when the bible tells us clearly your king is going to come writing on a quote the fall of an ass and then jesus comes writing in and they say who is this you know but those who were elected the moment they saw that they caught him that's what we're talking about revelation the moment they see him riding in they begin to shout out zamla hosanna and they welcome the word of god on the scene amen even if it doesn't come on a donkey like it did back there but it comes back to you in word form you're still saying amen hosanna yes it is he that cometh in the name of the lord because you recognize it hallelujah amen praise god god spoke it his name shall be called wonderful counselor mighty god everlasting father the prince of peace and then jesus is born and he comes on the scene and we understand his work is the interpretation of the word of god hallelujah amen so we understand it clearly here now i want you to see here i'm going to get to the heart of it i can go through there are more coats here but brother branham speaking here he talks about jesus having triples and he said i have triples and he says every minister has three pulls in their ministry but at this point he specifically began to emphasize how that he came through the healing then he came through prophesying popular when you're when the healing is going on unpopular when you start to prophesy teaching and doctrine of the word of god because a lot of them believe that prophesying is foretelling they don't understand that prophesying is also telling forth the word of god right so they're looking for somebody to prophesy and tell the future all the time not seeing that the restoration of the word comes back to tell forth the doctrines and the truths that were lost and were scattered throughout the ages amen praise god hallelujah now back to this pose then he came to the point where he began to emphasize the third poll and the uh main point of the turtle is creation is that right by the spoken word the spoken word creation taken place by the spoken word of the living god hallelujah amen and you know how the experience with sister hattie wright and how when god used him to speak the word and tree squirrel and the squirrels appeared and he shot them to show that they were real amen and we know he talked about the manifestation of that but in actual fact do you recognize and understand this is what he was pointing to that the bride would come forth by god's what spoken word like how he could speak he a man a prophet speaking the word who squirrels were created by the spoken word through the mouth of the prophet and god is strengthened to us through that that he who spoke in the beginning before anything was and said let there be light that same god said let there be a bride let there be a bride let there be a people that are a bride amen and that has to come to pass that has to come to pass amen and when she appears on the scene when she appears and is right there in front of them the manifestation is the interpretation praise god there's nothing they have to do say or explain because they themselves become the interpretation of the word of god from the hour that they are living in for the word of god is allotted to every age a portion to every age amen do you understand the bible was saying malachi 4 5 i will send unto you elijah the prophet amen and he shall turn the hearts of the church of the fathers fathers to the children amen let's let's smite the earth with a cross curse revelation 10 1-7 it tells you how he's going to send the seventh angel and the seventh angel will come and open up all of the mystery of god that was to be known in these days there is no more last days we are in those days right now and that seven angels will do it in these last days hallelujah amen when brother branham appeared on the scene started off with his ministry and the war began to flow through him spiritual elected people those who are elected began to recognize that is the fulfillment of malachi 4 5 just like they let in the book of matthew recognize that is the interpretation of our king coming sitting on an ass as quote the fall of an ass i thank god we have recognized what god has done i want to thank god that we recognize what god has done and is doing in our day and in our age blessed be the name of god of our god if he can speak he was trying to get you to see if he can make a man speak squirrel into existence can he speak his bride into existence his entire bride and uh like brother branham said concerning light for him to speak that thing in existence it means that he had the light had to be in his mind before the foundation of the world so then he could speak what is it was in his mind he spoke what in his mind and it was done lord of god and if you were in the mind of god if you're elected and you are in his mind his thoughts and god spoke the word in this last day and you appear on the scene by believing his word that you become what the manifestation of the word of god for this hour [Music] amen praise be to god hallelujah amen see that's where it is the word god speaking his own word out and taking the word for that age life amen the word for that is life and giving interpretation of it back then it was god in christ what is it today god in the pride interpreting his own word bringing his own word to pass because christ is the word and whenever that word is made manifest wherever it is it is christ again in every age amen hallelujah christ making himself manifest oh how could we apply that to this day oh when the holy ghost comes they lean on their own understanding and they cannot see it amen and they think that is not the word of the lord amen but the identification of it the age in which it is god's is his own interpretation and the interpretation is the manifestation of the promise lord of god hallelujah how wonderful to know it brother sister i tell you it might have taken ages and ages seven church ages but of the gentile dispensation yet a bride is here praise god hallelujah you understand what this is like brother brandon said he said i looked at those squirrels he says and when i looked at them i said no just by the spoken my spoken word that that these are real they may not be real let me shoot one issue and there's the blood and everything else he shoots another shoots another and then he took them home cooked them and at them to show that they were real and so he's what he's really saying there is that his spoken word produced a living present day manifestation of the word of god right in front of him amen and god is by that was letting you know i am going to by the spoken word produce a present day living manifestation of the word of god hallelujah and the bride is that manifestation of the word of god hallelujah praise god forevermore amen the coming of a bride amen who am i in this age you are living manifestations of this message you know hallelujah you and i are the manifestation of the prophet's word the prophet's words that were spoken always talking about the bride prank coming son of man being revealed hallelujah and you and i by believing and receiving the word are the present day living manifestation of the word of god hallelujah look i'm not talking about creation back there because you're gonna find here matter of fact uh where where will i find that amen notice when he did that creation then later on he went to make water into wine he took water first as a an already created substance and turned it into wine and fed 5 000 people then he took fish that was one swimming in the water somewhere broke it handed out multiplied it was a multiplied creation he took bread hallelujah that was baked in an oven broke it and so on handed it out to the people and it returned back notice i repeat it was a multiplied creation but now in these last days there is no sign of that kind of a creation for this he speaks this into creation hallelujah in other words this spoken word again is original seed he's not going to need nothing that he's got to pick up anywhere to multiply it but he speak his bride into existence by the spoken word amen and shows it to be the same god that created in the beginning with nothing but the spoken word hallelujah the same god with that spoken word can create squirrels he can create whatever he wants because he is god hallelujah and the word is infallible and it has to be manifested and fulfilled so god creates the bride in this end time of the world again but by this spoken word clean clear just by the spoken word you remember i'm continuing the same quote that is from shalom he says remember seventh is the finish could this be the finish it's over now amen seven is always the finish three polls jesus ministry three polls oh my notice that carefully how it was three poles oh my then we see here that they're still doubting it he was here they doubted him that he was the manifestation of moses prophecy when he said i am the prophet that moses spoke of and when he told them that that how they were living in things he became unpopular they didn't want to hear it they called him the altibul do you realize that those same spirits are living in the same kinds of people in condemned people that can never be saved because they were condemned before just like judas has carried born son of tradition amen he was very religious but remember in that day he could not go all the way and he got it here with the message he couldn't go all the way with the message now what he's really saying there just like when jesus was back there in that body fulfilling uh the word of moses right now we come here to fulfill the word of this prophet amen and when we come here we are going to be confronted by them same spirits that's what he's saying there he said that's going to call you blg bob and everything else he said but you must expect it because it's the same spirits that was on judas down through the ages they're gonna come back that only makes you know who you are is that right because they're not going to waste their time with anybody else they recognize they recognize who is going there and they want to do everything they can praise god to give you a black name see they can take healing they can take all them things but when it comes to believing god speaking squirrels into existence things into existence that's too deep for them see too deep it can't be you see and that's the spirit of judas i'm talking about and his spirit can live right up to that spot when that word manifests itself on going to the stage where it becomes the interpretation of it then it can't move beyond that spot amen for the word of god itself fulfills itself right there glory to god hallelujah amen amen hallelujah so now we're living in the days of the what not they as they think they the coming of christ yes but the bright coming of christ the bright coming of christ hallelujah the son of man being revealed in our day in our time and we are conscious of it but such stuff telling others they they want to know what are you talking about we read in the same bible we don't see that we're in the same prophet amen you see the coming of the bride was prefigured and prophesied just as much as eve was in adam we were in christ as we have taught before and just as she was made of the same material adam was made of god put you here your soul being a part of the same material he was made of amen which is the word he is the word you are part of that word he is eternal you are eternal because you are a part of it and we are in him because we are a part of any of him praise god but one day eve wandered away from adam just as we wandered away from the word of god amen and we did we wanted away from the mind of god and into this world of sin and of course we suffered and passed through our spiritual amnesia but god thank god he sent a prophet a man to try to ring our bell right uh you know just to bring you back to yourself that you might recognize who you are uh who you want to live uh like a beggar and yet i'm telling you you're the child of the king you want to live like you're a sinner or this or that whatever but you are not that you are this is the devil that tie you up and tell you this but you are justified you're justified you're sanctified by the blood by the word washed by the washing of the waters of the word of god hallelujah amen praise god amen yes sir oh my so god by revelation brings his members of his body my friends into manifestation of this message sure as we've said before perfect for a perfect realization of who you are that you are the present day manifestation of the word of god i don't want to repeat myself but you go to every prophet and you'll find they were the present day manifestation for the age there in god already said i'm gonna do this and then when the time comes a prophet comes on the scene god i'm going to do that and then a prophet comes on the scene they were not just the interpreters of the word in the sense that they're going to speak the interpretation but they were the living interpretations of the word they were the present day manifestation of the word of god we are the present day manifestation of god's word hallelujah amen praise god and so by perfect realization the bride begins to move to her rightful position what is her rightful position her position she was positioned in adam in his side and so we are moving back to his side we we are here we are siding with the world we're moving back to be living in him and being a part of him praise god hallelujah amen amen so here we are walking and talking with him and the rapture takes us back where we come from hallelujah put you back where you were in him and when you use the term i i'm gonna even preach and talk about that just pass over it ah el no him oh my glory god you go right back in him where you were to begin with hallelujah for his glory praise god brother sister let me just go over a bunch of things here praise god and just move right on and to show you how the third pull was to demonstrate the progression of the word of god you know from healing to discernment the word progressing in its power to transform and then it went into a higher octave of speaking things into existence amen or it moved from the realm of taking visible things to make another visible thing in a multiplied form now it's taking nothing just like he did from the beginning of the world just spoken word and taking that and speaking things the bride into existence and the word that he spoke after a while began to materialize until he become visible praise god when this prophet come on the scene began to speak the word bring his message there wasn't anybody that understood him or believed this message amen but way back somewhere one two three it begins to build what what a bride starts to materialize something began to form hallelujah right now just scattered around the world we don't have a denomination we don't know who she is she could be here she could be there she cannot be everywhere in the east the west the north the south but the form is taking shape hallelujah and the materialization of the spoken word of god is now on the scene amen lord of god hallelujah amen christ uniting with his bride praise god moving within and you moving with that bride uniting with her in every way praise god eternity present you understand humans we think in terms of oh eternity way back there sure it was way back but eternity doesn't have past present and future eternity is right now that's why god said i am the i am not i was no i am he always is there and when you come to understand that and recognize your position in christ you are the living present-day manifestation of god's spoken word hallelujah manifested right now hallelujah eternity again has come down amen and under the great power of the holy spirit amen he's catching us away in the rapture and when you're caught away in that rapture then he takes you for a thousand year honeymoon after that after that thousand-year honeymoon is over then here comes the white horse rider the word of god with his bride riding on powers of heaven charges of god horses the bible has it as horses but it's powers of god and charges of the holy spirit anointed and coming back together with him for the world to see that who they are that she and him are one together for the glory and praise of god amen prophet [Music] and then the prophet and then it moved to the prophet's prophecy and then you start walking in the manifestation of that prophet's word that has taken place amen how wonderful and blessed to know that he is the same yesterday today and forever praise god hallelujah now remember the bible tells us and i'm going to start winding down how that a sower went forth to sow and when he sow he sowed seeds praise god and uh if you know the sowing of seeds it always was they have a bag at their sides will take out and it will throw the seeds and then it's moved on to machines and technology that we have today amen but god already has higher technology than that because to sow his seed god uses prophets and his seed is his word and the spoken word is the original scene and the prophet when he speaks the word of god it is actually god sowing his seed his seed word the word is being so oh praise god hallelujah right through the prophet's mouth and so the word is planted in your heart my heart is planted in my heart your heart by the spoken word of god true a prophet for his glory amen praise god god spoke through a prophet and said there's going to be a bright tree hallelujah that word once is spoken he said my word wants to go out it cannot return void doesn't matter it's a thousand years that word is going to circle until it creates what god spoke it to create what god told it to do that world is going to go out and do exactly what god told it to do amen hallelujah spoke about a bright tree and how that bright tree is going to be restored brought back by redemption brought back by what brought back to heaven by what prophesied a rapture you know the prophets preaching filled with is speaking about a rapture jesus himself promising a rapture i've got to prepare a place for you that where i am you may be also he spoke the word there's gonna be a rapture this is not a myth this is not a story but this is the fullness of the word of the living god that this is going to be a rapture hallelujah amen now see all of god's words are seeds his spoken word and when he had spoke i'm speaking from the power of transformation here that he has spoke his word always brings forth of its kind the earth come and there was light there was sunshine when he said let sunshine amen see he had it in his mind and if the sun did shine the flower would grow that he's he spoke into existence so he makes everything to fulfill and meet its purpose whatever it is like just like speaking a tree amen i'm talking about the bright tree here now the bright tree spoken into existence by the word of god hallelujah then if it's to bear a certain kind of fruit a corn or apple or whatever he makes that fruit so forth because it is here to serve his purpose and it must come to pass hallelujah the only thing he had to do after he spoke it amen then he has to watch and wait i don't know how much that thing had to go through before it come to pass i don't know how many times it how many rejects it must have had and whatever more it had to come true but it has to come to pass amen listen there's got to be a bride tree there is a bright tree there is a bride on the scene by the spoken word of god the great shore showed the seeds through the ministry of malachi 4 5 and revelation 10 7 and we are the manifestation of those seeds that have come up to their rightness and fullness in this hour and in this day praise god [Music] we are the interpretation of his message we are the manifestation of the word of god hallelujah oh my don't you understand what i'm saying i'm continuing the quote the same thing is him about having his church here now in these last days so he talk about the tree and talk about all those things he said but really what i'm talking about is the same way scott spoke the word there has to be a bride a church in this last this matter of fact he says it here he's he is going to have a bride hallelujah for he has spoken the word hallelujah and now the word is making itself manifest now and again it repeats he is able of these stones to raise up children to abraham if we don't follow him he'll get somebody else that will follow him he's going to have it he's going to have that bride because he has already spoken whatever he says it has to be that way it cannot change it must comfort the way he said it because he said it would happen in this day amen praise god so that's the genesis of the genesis and that is the uh what should i say the fullness of what i'm trying to say here today is that we are the manifestation of god's spoken word through the mouth of a prophet that has gone on you see the prophet spoke the word and he's left the scene but the word continue to percolate and work right like one quote he says yes they may take the messenger the messenger may go but it's not the messenger it's the message and that message is still working in the world today because it's the spoken word of god still vibrating and moving and quickening and just working its way into the hearts of men and women changing lives transforming people the elected of god pulled by the word of god into the presence of the living god hallelujah not by multiplication of what was already there right he did that like he said with the wine and did that with the fish and the bread he says but now this is coming forth from pure spoken word just the words spoken no other material just spoken word material and then creation in the beginning ending of the world the same kind of creation taking place here again by god's spoken word and we thank god that we are in it we are a part of it and we are in it because we are that creation that's why he called us his masterpiece we are that masterpiece and the birth that we are here to celebrate is the birth of christ the lord once again the word made flesh you see i'm saying the same things but you see it meaning something else to you because you know what i'm saying the word made flesh not in him just back there but the word made flesh in you the word making itself manifest in you and declaring itself to the people that they may start to understand this book but you become the living epistles the living interpretations of this word of god and not because you have to try and make yourself look holy or try to work yourself up into something that is why he started the sim he said remember with these seals it's god hiding in simplicity just be simple be humble be reverent and go about your business and god will bless you just that's all you have to do because it is salvation is of the lord it's not of you it's not of works it's not of you trying to perfect yourself or to do this or that or whatever or or whether you drink a less coffee then you'll be more of a christian or if you don't drink tea you know what i'm saying all these kinds of things like that the spirit of god start taking your mind away from all these weird fantastic uh things like that and bring you to a sanity and a stability back on the foundations of the word of god amen so i believe that praise the lord so that is my subject for today and i trust it has touched your heart and bless your soul [Applause] i know i might have gotten so excited in certain parts of it that i might have just been flying over things and running you know like that but bear with me because i'm just a human just like you and i'm just as excited if not more excited for what i'm seeing in the world praise the lord and i want to thank god for the blessing of brother thomas brady spoke or touched on this subject uh in a small way and went on but i caught the seed of that praise the lord but it's only now many years because i'm talking about since like in the uh 90s early 90s uh that the thing has resurrected and said now is the time this is the hour right praise god not you're not just the manifestation of the prophet's spoken word for god uses the prophet to be his mouth you're the manifestation of god's word spoken through the prophet and now you are his creation standing living in this present age this present time standing on the face of the earth you not need no interpretation of that for the manifestation is the interpretation you need to go interpreting the message and people taking parts of it and trying to splice it here or splice it there on the tapes or take in pieces and coats here and coats there and putting it together to show their their dexterity and stuff like that just living and walking in the word and being at peace with god and with yourself with your brothers and your sisters you become and you are be conscious of god and be conscious of that fact that we are the present day living manifestation of god's spoken word through the mouth of a prophet that has passed our way and he had to pass our way because his ministry had to call out the elect of this age and if you are you are one or were one of the elect no matter how much dirt where you were buried or if you were living in a palace he had to pass your way and call you out of the path for the world [Applause] amen praise god so come let us adore him christ the lord same yesterday today and forever amen praise the lord he's a wonderful god isn't he lord of god as this that's this wonderful roman candle keeps bursting and keep going higher and higher and keep going like that praise god i thank god for his word i feel so badly for many who believe that brother branham is the pastor to the or this age that we're living in they don't understand yes he is the pastor of the seventh church age ah but he himself tells you clearly the seventh church age is finished it's over done is that right and now we're under the leadership of our bridegroom the headship of the word of god and more so because it is true the holy spirit the word of god that's why he said several times also no he says i'm only hitting the highlights wait till them young men come on the scene amen and they'll break it down they'll take it and they'll break the whole thing down well it's not them the holy spirit through them is going to take that word and break it down so that we can all feast upon the words that were placed the food that was in the storehouse is that right praise god hallelujah oh i just said that and when i said that your the holy spirit says almost like do you realize what you set food in the storehouse how could you how how could israel store up mana they couldn't store up manna the only food that could be stored up was the angels food was put that was put in the golden pot within the holy of holies and the pillar of fire standing above it that's the only only one that can be stored up right so that's what happened in that minute that's the second when i said storehouse that's what the holy spirit said look there it is you see what he placed there is food but that food is behind the veil right it's behind the veil only those who are permitted to go behind that veil those elected seed of god are going to feed on that storehouse and eat the present day word of the living god that is going to keep them for the journey amen god bless you god bless your hearts praise the lord hallelujah of course you know this is eternal and if i keep talking like this even if i calm down and smoke casually it's going to keep breaking and breaking and breaking so we give god praise honor and glory now it's a strange christmas message but it is a christmas message it is something to trill your heart and to trill your soul and rejoice that it is your birthday amen it's birthday of the bride it's the birthday of the bride the word again with flesh not the word now that comes in 65 but that word has now become flesh is that right manifesting itself true flesh for the glory of god hallelujah and i'm so glad i'm a part of it brothers i i'm just feeling at peace with myself at peace with the world at peace with those around me people want to argue worry fret fuss fight and all that kind of stuff no that's not in my spirit that's not in my economy whatsoever right doesn't matter a neighbor gets mad at me or something like that oh no it just becomes funny now crazy just becomes funny right because first of all if i were to speak and say oh i know you i know you because i know why you're reacting like that praise the lord god bless every one of you have a very happy holiday we'll be right back here next and we'll have a service on

god just wanted to bring a few announcements quickly today is the sunday the 19th that we said that we would have all of our offerings and our goods in for the missions hamilton um uh services will be delivering all those things we've already i believe we've already delivered a load right yep uh because there was um quite a bit of uh money that was donated by the grace of the lord and the sisters went out and they purchased a lot of stuff they delivered a whole load already you know they witnessed the amount of people that are in need is tremendous and especially at this time and so for those of you that have given the lord richly bless you um today's your last opportunity if you still oh i forgot series with us today so anyways if you have a desire to give today's your last day everything will be going out and we want to thank god for many that have given even outside of the ministry you know they heard and they said hey we want to be a part of it we want to give and they um you know they one family called me this week and i said yeah bring it you know and they brought a load a load you know and i thought wow praise god you know the lord is good so um uh thank you everybody that's

you're gonna see that at the front you know with the uh with the picture of the cloud it says transforming the world one person at a time and our actual writing the way that we do it is changing the world one person at a time but somehow it just it got done this way and you know pastor simon brought it to my attention and i thought wow we both missed that you know when we checked the uh you know the uh the proof and everything but then how did it get there and something kind of tells me that i unconsciously did it right because when i you know when i wrote it out but anyways i thought you know the word transforming is a powerful word and you know i looked it up and brother branham preached on the you know the power of transformation and this is what he said he says what is it transforming transforming by the word of god no i don't know about you but i was transformed today you were transformed today and he says making us sons and daughters of god and will also give us life in the world to come oh my what more could i say listen not to other things you know and i thought wow what a quote you know and i brought that up and i said praise the lord and then you look at the definition of the word transform and it's make a thorough or dramatic change in the form appearance or character of i don't know about you but we've certainly had some amazing transformations and witnessed it so this year you're going to receive that and i believe the lord has given us a message amen and so you don't if you've got somebody on your heart that comes to your mind not just to take you know extra no you actually the lord gives you somebody and shows you and says hey i want to give one of those to this person because it's a nice little calendar it's got you know useful things in
