hopelessly lost the way and you are the one that we praise you are the one we adore you give the healing and Grace our hearts always hunger for oh our hearts always hunger for as we bright brother Dan let's just sing you are the one that we praise you are the one one we adore you give the healing and Grace our hearts always hunger for oh our hearts always hunger for God bless you Saints amen praise God forever more thank you David what a wonderful song service and we thank God for the wonderful U song speci tonight amen and uh now this is the main reason why we came is to receive his word to hear what he has to say for us tonight uh yesterday we received a tremendous message of how the Watchmen is living in US directing us and guiding us and warning us and and moving us in our lives from situations that um we sometimes find ourselves in but you know the wonderful part about serving the lord in this day and in this hour is knowing that he started the work he started your journey he started the Deliverance in your life you didn't know you needed it but he knew exactly what you would need he knew the time and the season that he'd have to draw you out from all the let's call it Amnesia you didn't know who you really were but then when he opens the understanding all of a sudden you start to see wait a minute you mean I don't have to be trapped in the anxieties and the fears and in the doubts that this world you know tries to trap you in all the time making you think that this is who you are this is your life take it or leave it that's what the devil wants you to believe but that's not what God has for you I believe tonight we've got our brother Boaz who's anointed by the spirit of God is going to continue and give you exactly what you need to hear tonight I want you to be listening one word from God can change your whole life when he makes his word word real to you as an individual personal you're never going to be the same and your friends are going to know it amen praise God and so at this time I want to invite our precious brother Boaz he's an assistant minister at um literal Life Tabernacle his Pastor Paul LaFontaine the Le Fontaine family have been a tremendous blessing and now they're being a Blessing by allowing our precious brother to minister to our young people God bless you brother Boaz have the liberty of the Lord may he use you and bless you in a special way God bless you Saints amen God bless you all it's certainly a privilege to be here and to see you all again and uh certainly as brother Dan was saying is like uh where you seeking for that uh anointing of the holy spirit that he can come and talk to us uh this evening amen so I will say if if we can just bow our heads for a moment and let's pray and we're going we're going to go right straight to the word so let's let's bow our heads Heavenly Father once again we are so grateful to be um uh together Lord we know that uh this is an unusual way to get together father but you have provided all these means for us to to have this Fellowship father around uh the world and in your word father that's the greatest thing that we could ever experience father that one day we're going to remember these um these things and we're going to say certainly the Lord was with us providing ways that we could get together Lord we just give you thanks for this day we give you thanks for the life that you have given us to leave father give you thanks for our health father and for everything that you have given us father and even the things that we have not received yet we know that our lives are in your hands father if there is something that we need to ask your forgiveness Lord we just want to come in before your throne of grace father to ask you to forgive us Lord if we have sin or we have H against you Lord we just want to ask your forgiveness father May uh whatever we say tonight may be a a blessing to your children Lord because at the end of the day we are just instruments as I said it yesterday and you are the one that is going to uh speak to your children Lord we love you we give you thanks and uh we ask you to bless the reading of your word in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and we all can say amen amen so as I said it's certainly again it is a privilege to be back with you all and um and to be in this beautiful Fellowship uh not many times we hear the term it is around the word but now we can say that now that word is living in our hearts and that's the the greatest joy that a Christian can experience amen so if you uh have your bibles if you can turn with me there uh to the Book of Luke chapter 15 verse 17-9 and I'm going to share here uh my uh screen so you can see it as well you can follow with me uh in in these scriptures that we're going to be reading here so book of uh The Book of Luke chapter 15 verse uh 17-9 and it reads like this and when he came to himself he said how many higher Servants of my fathers have breed enough and to spare and I perish with hunger and he said listen to what he saying here and I will arise and go to my father and I will say unto him father I have sin against heaven and before Thee I am no more worthy to be called thy son make make me as one of thy higher servants now we can turn to the book of Colossians chapter 2 verse 13- 15 and it says and uh you being death uh in your sins and the in circumcision of your flesh had he quickened together with him having forgiven you all all trespasses blooding out the handwriting of ordinances that was uh against us which was contrary to us and took it out the way nailing it to the cross and having spoiled principalities and Powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it amen so you you may have your seats right now so as as I said it is certainly a privilege and once again uh uh I'm grateful for this opportunity that we have given to speak to you all and um you know in seeking God's mind and as we were talking yesterday about that Watchman and yesterday we said something and it's like certainly there are some times where you know you find yourself in in in situations where uh you have made the wrong choices you have made the wrong decisions but even in the middle or in the mid midst of that God has Mercy or has had mercy over your life and and he is a god of a second chance but today by God's grace we're going to keep uh you know with that that we talk we were talking yesterday about that Watchman and brother Dan he said something talking about Amnesia and I was like well stop there brother Dan because we're gonna focus a little bit on that and in a few more o other things so we're so grateful that we are in the same channel and and the one thing that I just want is that this that you see here or you are seeing on your screen is is just is just a human being standing but what we want we want his Spirit we want his presence we we want want uh the father we want him to speak through US amen because if I'm going to be giving you my idea if I if I'm going to be giving you my concept that won't work it won't change anything in your life but if it is the holy spirit going through this a screen going through these lips of Flesh you know it will do something in your life and that's what we want we want that quickening power that changing power that can come and change our lives amen so now as we just read here in the Book of Luke chapter 15 and if you have had the opportunity to read this uh this chapter specifically so here is Jesus talking and he's talking about uh you know different pares and uh one of them is the Lost ship and the other one is a lost coin and then he talks about the the prodigal son so today by God's grace let's focus a little bit and think about about the prodical son you know um if if we think a little bit about this this guy this let's say this guy um he had a good Watchman if we can if we can see it from that perspective his parents were Godly Parents were a parents that were always praying because the prophet of God said that the the the the parents were always praying for for his two their two children you know that God will protect them that God would lead them that God will be over them you know but you know as as we said uh when you have good wife judement sometimes we despite or or we kind of we take for granted what the Lord has provided in our lives amen so as we can say here you know he had Godly Parents that feared God and that gave the best instruction they could give to their two children but if we we find something here that uh this younger son he is that is surrounding himself by the wrong company you know he started having the the the wrong uh influence amen so therefore if we can say it this way the opinion of his parents you know the parents were like watch this don't go don't go to this specific location or this don't associate yourself with that people but you know what it seemed that he was going through here and and leing from and leing through here amen so what happened and uh you know he he had he he made a lot of new friends and and everything was good for him because you know he was feeling good he was being accepted in in in in the in the circle of friends that he had they they they were being a bad influence to him but he didn't see it amen he was despising the the the if we can say it that way the the advice from his parents amen so if we can focus a little bit on on on on uh he he did a few things that uh kind of we consequences of of his choices uh that we we want to talk or or we want to focus on right now and if we can focus on them we'll be three of them amen so let me put it here again on the screen number one and and this is for you young people it's like the the the gr company will bring Disobedience to the authority amen think about that one for a second the wrong company will bring Disobedience to to uh to the third and uh you know and and that's the reason you know one of the first things as as I said he started associating himself with the wrong people and that wrong that and that people was telling him you know what you don't have to go you don't have to go to the synagogue or you don't have to uh to go with your parents to the synagogue like that's that's for all people like that that's kind of out of fashion and you know just come with us let's do this let let's break the Sabbath and and you know all this the the Traditions they had you know and as I said the first thing you know the wrong company will bring Disobedience to the authority and and and he started doing that and little by little was kind of every single time the parents will tell him something it will seem that he didn't care amen but that's why the Bible speaks about about about your children or about the youth people in in in general everybody you know honor that your parents that that you it may be well with with the and you have a long life on Earth amen and uh and we can say this way as well like same thing happens with Christians when they start associating the themselves with the wrong company it will bring as a result discouragement Amen Let me let me put it this way you know if uh when you go to a camp uh you know if you're like uh doing some camping out or like you go camp a to to have some little camp out and you know when you're going to start a fire and and and all we all have seen the fire and and and then uh you know when they have all all the all the wood and and they start the fire while everything is a stick together you're gonna have a good fire amen so what's what what happens when when somebody uh suddenly removes a piece of that fire and put it on the side that that little little piece of wood is going to start dying because it's is not around the the rest of the fire amen so that's the same thing with a son of God with a daughter of God when you start kind of drifting apart or separating yourself from the fire of God or from the good company that you have from the good friends from from the from the right fellowship and this is what happened with this young man you know the the the the the parents will always tell him hey don't don't do that don't don't go with that people don't don't don't go don't do that but he as I said he was not listening he was just making one choice after one after another and and all the choices that he was making they were wrong amen so uh as I said as a result there there was discouragement or or in a Christian in a Christian uh let's say uh young lady or young men there will be discouragement because now what are you going to be talking to the with the people that that is not believing the same thing as you believe then you start dist distancing yourself from other Christians you know you start being discouraged you start you start distancing distancing yourself from other Christians and but what happened and that's what happened with this with this young man you know that was the first thing he started distancing himself from from other Christians and then the next thing you know a few a few days later he made a choice and he he said I will go to my father and I will ask him for the portion of my inheritance so the first thing he start associating himself with the wrong company and now he's gonna say you know I need to go and ask my father for my inheritance and he if you read your Bible and if you think about inheritance he had a right for that inheritance but maybe not maybe but it wasn't the time for him to receive that inheritance you know because he was not ready to receive that that that inheritance amen uh and now if we can think about about another thing that that he he he was uh going through you know we can say that he was making choices without praying and seeking for the correct advice anden and we and we can say that the when when you're going through through things like that let me put it again here on the screen so making choices without praying and seeking for the correct advice will bring temporary contentment certainly you know the the what the world has to offer is just for temporary contentment and that's it nothing else amen so what happened here if we if we can say it this way you know how wrong he was because he was just leaving the moment without thinking that his present decisions will have impact in his future so think about it think about it if you're making a decision right now is that decision is a decision that you are making Holy Ghost LED because that's gonna have an impact in your future you know because if you think about planting seeds you know what seeds am I planting right now that later on I will reap the fruits or I will get the fruits of those decisions or or the seeds that I am planted amen and uh what I can say may we today make the right decisions that will have an eternal impact in my life if today I'm making the decision to follow Christ that's gonna have an eternal impact in my life amen how many can say Amen you can say Amen there there where you are seated amen so and we can we get blindsided that we don't realize that our decision s will bring will bring us many problems when you make the wrong decisions or or or the wrong choices they will bring you a lot of progress how many how many times we have made decisions that later on we regret and say I should have listened to my parents I should have listened to my to my pastor I should have listened to my friend but guess what God as I said it at the beginning of of of of this sermon God is God that can give you a second chance because as I said if you are finding yourself right now that you have made a wrong choice there is a still Grace for you and there is still that opportunity for you that you can take it and God as I said God is a god of Second Chances amen so now once he got the portion of his of his inheritance he went uh to another city you know that's what the scripture says that he went to another city and and and he started uh spending or or he started living the good life amen let me share my screen again here and he started Living a good life you know because he he had money and and and he had he had good things you know he had a lot as I said he had a lot of friends you know but the first one as we said he started associating himself with the wrong company the second one he he he he uh made choices to have a temporary contentment but he wasn't looking at the long term and the third one he separated himself from his uh you know he he uh from his family as we're saying here family separation you know he left his family and spent all his inheritance in the wrong living why because that's what that's the that's that's the thing that he knew and he was not listening anymore to his parents because that's what happened with a lot of a lot of with this generation now they don't want to listen to the parents they want to do their own thing because they they think that they know everything you know but the Holy Spirit if we can bring it back again the holy spirit is is is is back or is here with you to uh uh to make you do the right choices or or to put it in to put in your heart to make the right choices amen so as we can see here he left his family and spent all his inheritance in wrong you know he lived the best life as if there wouldn't be a tomorrow and I can tell you remember young lady young man you know the so-called friends will be available only when they can take an advantage on you amen and that's the sad part you know because when when when somebody sees that they can get something good out of you they will they will be around you but as soon as you have nothing the So-Cal friends won't be there anymore and that's what happened with this young man you know he didn't have his he didn't have his family he he didn't have money anymore and now where was he what can what can we say this to this amen so every decision we can say right now this this point or we can bring this point every decision that he made in in in in simple words it was bringing him let's say to a prison in other words The Watchman was telling him if you're going that path you're going to prison and what he did he went that path and he went to prison and and I'm talking about a spiritual prison I'm talking about a circumstance that he was going and he was his own choice amen it was not that the parents sent him to go there it was not that that the the good friends sent him to go there but it was his own choice amen my desire My pray here tonight is that we by the Holy Spirit by that Watchman we will make the right choices Amen in other words as I said he became a prisoner of his own circumstance he became a prisoner of of his o of his own decisions amen we can say another thing here that our decisions either will set us free or will make us prisoners amen he and we can think a little bit about more more more about him you know he he he his parents were Godly Parents as I said and there one one more thing here you know after he didn't have any money after he didn't have any friends after he he didn't have a way to go back home what happened the Bible says that he went to a place and he and he and he went to to a to to a let's say to a farmer and he asked him and and he told him hey can work there and the farmer was like you know what I don't have anything to any any work for you oh you know what he said I have something for you you go and take care of the pigs go and take care of the swine let me tell you one thing according to the to the Hebrew law according to the to the to the Commandments that God gave to the to the Hebrew children in that time in those days the the to be around around the swine or around the pigs what was AB Abomination before the Lord so can you think about it that every single decision he made BR brought him so to such a low state that all the laws all God's God's uh requirements God's principles he broke them he wrote the Commandment of honoring his parents he wrote the Commandment that now that he was you know with with the with the hidden and now he was you know taking care of the pigs you know and that was a that was something humilate humiliating if we can say it that way but guess what as I said there is a God of second Chan and if today you may find yourself in a low estate Psalms 13623 says who remember us in our low estate and for and then the Bible says for his mercy endureth forever and also the scripture says that his mercies are new every morning so if if if do they you need one of those mercies you can say your mercies Lord are new every morning I want one of I want that Mercy or I want that promise that says that I can be forgiven I have I I want that promise that that says that you love me I want that promise that you can give joy on speak and full of Glory that is his promise and you have that right once you have repented once you have say Lord I'm so sorry the Lord can come and give you those mercies every single day amen because that's why this Bible is here for us that every day we can go here and say Lord your mercies on you every morning what do you have to tell me this morning and he says repent and be baptized and honor thy father and thy mother you know for sake not disembl together you know those are mercies that we can receive every day of Our Lives amen so we're so happy to hear all these things that Lord even in the middle of his worst circumstance Lord you bring him out of there and let me tell you one thing and we have some parents that have join this this this uh this uh Youth Camp the prophet of God tells us that his parents never sto praying for him his parents they had a promise that they that no matter how lost or how low their son will be he was going to return back to where he belonged so parent father or head of the family if you have a son or you have a daughter that right now is is is in Amnesia I can tell you that if you keep praying and and in in in Pro in in taking that promise that says that that none of the ones that you have received they will be lost you keep praying and saying Lord if I have applied the token in my home this my son that is lost is gonna be is gonna is gonna be fun this my my son that was that that is dead is gonna become to Resurrection amen because it doesn't matter the circumstance H as long as that son or that daughter are on the under a promise you can claim them today think about this time didn't matter how it didn't matter the hour didn't matter to them what matters to them was that they had a promise so if I can tell you tonight if you are claiming or or you are you you are in need of something time how when where it do doesn't matter you will come to pass because that is what he has promised in his word amen now if you find yourself in such a state either uh you you can be in this condition like this man was or or or as I said or or a mother or or a father are in this situation just keep praying just keep just keep claiming what the Lord has already promised to you amen no let me let me let me put this uh another one another thing here listen what brother randam says about Amnesia and then can keep talking a little bit here I hope you you guys are getting my point here but my desire my my my my aim or like what I want to bring here is that it doesn't matter in the circumstance or the situation that you can find yourself even though at first you didn't listen to that watch man but that Watchman is giving you a second chance amen so now now listen to what the prophet of God says he says now this Amnesia we're told is uh is you you're that you know you you it caused you to be to a place where you cannot identify yourself and then he said a little bit later in in in in in in that quote it says now worry sometimes causes that amnish amen and and and and another thing that causes Amnesia people is getting between two opinions that will cause Amnesia and it get you it gets you to a place you know that what you have that what you've done you you've lost your reasons you've lost your mind you can make you you don't know who you are you can't identify yourself you can walk around and eat and everything but you still can't identify yourself how interesting that is you know this man we think about it again he he he was uh you know he didn't know who he was he lost his identity and that's what the enemy wants in your life he wants you to lose your identity he he doesn't want you to listen to God he doesn't want you to listen to The Watchmen he doesn't want you to listen to your parents he doesn't want you to listen to your pastor why because he wants you to lose your identity he wants you to lose who you are in Christ but I can tell you if you can uh think about it and you can think in the promises of God that you can say I am a Son of God I am a daughter of God and it doesn't matter if I'm in in such a low estate I know that he will bring me up he will bring me through he will bring me to uh to heaven only places because that is his promise amen now brother renom he says he he he he he talk about a story and he was talking about uh you know this uh this guy that he was brought as an slave you know and he was there in the plantation and uh when uh when the Masters they they went and they wanted to buy some his slaves they saw this man and and they saw him and the man was there you know he was standing and and he didn't have a sad face he he he was you know like you know owning where he was you know he was standing he was I'm here and I'm gonna be the best and then uh people as as the you know the the Masters as the the as the broker and ask him hey we want to buy that one and and the broker said no that's not for sale and and they were like why he's not for sale and he's like do you feed him the same and the and the broker said yes he eats beans he eats uh water he eats hard bread he eats exact same thing and then so then uh they ask him so why is he in that position knowing that he's he's bound with chains and with chains and and and stuff like and he's like well one time I asked him the same thing because he was wor working and and he was doing everything you know with a good attitude and and all those good things and and I asked him why are you acting that way and and and and and the bro and that is like here reply you know what because I know that I have been brought to this place as an slave but I know that where I come from I am the son of a king and that even though I'm here like bound with with these chains here with whatever you want to bind me here I know that I am a son of a king so that's why the broker told the Masters that's why he's not for sale so I can tell you that the same for you tonight you know sometimes the enemy can can bind you but you know and that's as I said it when he as we're talking here about Amnesia when when the enemy kind of he he he makes makes you believe that you are are that you are not a child of God then what's going to happen then he's going he's going to bring you to that Amnesia but once you have recognize that you are a child of God that it doesn't matter the state where you can find yourself but you know that you're a Son of God you're gonna come from from that prison into freedom in Christ amen because where you come from where I come from I know that I am a son of the king amen so that's the greatest promise that we can have today that I am not just the son of a king I am a son of the king of kings the Lord of lords amen amen so what else can we say here you know we think we keep thinking about this prodal son God's grace is such is so amazing that even in in that state this son he was awakened from his admission he was awakened from from his nightmare that he was he was leeping so as I said by God's grace we know now that we are children of the allm mighty God we have been Washed by the Water of the word we have been forgiven we have been Justified we have been restored we have been redeemed we have been delivered from anything in our lives and now we know that we are the children of God because that's his promise that's the gift of God that was given to us and we don't have we didn't have to pay anything it was a free gift for us amen then here he said the prodical son again how many higher Servants of my fathers have bread enough andare and I perish with hunger and I'm here in this CH you know how many of you can say that in in in in the middle or in the midst of your mental chaos there God open his door of love and compassion just to tell you that that is not your place that you are his son that you are his daughter that that he cares for you I can tell you one thing once the enemy push you out of your position it will be easier for him to attack you that's why you know when when when the flock or when the ship when they are together like it's hard for the W the Wolves to come and attack them because this is what happened and that's that's an interesting thing to see you know when when when when that Wolf come in if the Sheep are together they will just kind of walk together and they will squee him and they will kill that wolf amen but what happen if there's one ship like far from the flock when the Wolf come the Wolf come he going to come and he's going to kill it amen that's why if we can say it this way when the enemy as I said it the enemy find you by yourself he's gonna come and attack you and if you are not with the right company you're are not with the with the right with the W uh with the the right Fellowship he's gonna come and he's going to try to kill you amen now let's bring this son or let's bring this prodal son out of the prison because we can say that even though he was in in in in that in that prison you know it was not a physical prison it was a mental prison as we said he was in a big an Mission he didn't know who he was he didn't know he he he he didn't remember who he was amen but suddenly he he recognized and he said you know what I am a son I am a son of of a king as well I am a son of a master that I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna tell him father I have sin against heaven and against you I am no longer worthy to be your son but let me tell you one thing it doesn't matter again I can tell you young people it doesn't matter in this state that you find yourself today what matters is if you come out of that and you recognize who you are in Christ that's what we wna tell you today don't forget who you are in Christ amen now look I would like to give you some things here that I have learned in my Christian Journey you know in when you find yourself in a prison don't think that that prison is going to be forever because when you are a child of God the Bible says and they shall know the truth and the truth will set them free amen what is the truth is a revealed word of the hour that is the truth for us so this truth is gonna set me free amen now let's share our screen here again very quick in the message he cares do you care the prophet of God says the trouble is that in our case we won't take that that we we we won't take what the remedy says to do he said we got the remedy but we won't take it we say we do because we can read it but to to really take it we don't do it in other words you have the word of God in other words you you have the message of the hour you have the sermons of your pastors but it is up to you to take care or not that's the remedy for all your problems there is nothing else that could be a remedy but the word of God the revealed message of the hour that's the remedy that we have for us to live in this neurotic age amen now the remedy or solution to get out out of our circumstance was and as I said it will always be in need is our Lord Jesus Christ there is nothing else there is not any uh denominational idea or Creed or a Dogma or anything the only thing that can set you free is not brother boas here speaking to you this this evening no is Christ in you the one that can set you free amen now as I said we can we can present this as principles that that I have learned in my Christian Life that can help you today if you're finding yourself in pre and that you can say you know what I can apply that principle that's fine but this is just what the Lord had placed in my in my heart amen now let's see here again if you ask yourself how do I get out of my Prison number one we have to an knowledge that we are wrong you know this is very important important why because this require humility and willingness to change if you're going through a through a situation in your life acknowledge that you have done wrong why because when you acknowledge that the Lord is mindful of your of your acknowledgement it's like let's let's put it this way when we're talking about acknowledge something is to realize oh I've done it wrong oh I have to mend this thing you know you know it where can we find that Luke 1518 through1 19 it says these young man said I will get up and I will go to my father and I will say to him father I have sinned against heaven and in your sight I am no longer worthy to be called your son just make me like one of your higher servants but I can tell you when you're a child of God it doesn't matter if you as I said if you're in a low state or like no estate at all it doesn't matter if you are his son once you acknowledge once you recognize that you have done wrong he is willing to forgive you he's willing to bring you up from that low lowest State then Psalms 325 it says and I acknowledged my sin to you and my iniquity I did not hide I said I will confess my transgressions to the Lord continually unfolding the past till uh uh all is so then you instantly forgave me the guilt and in iniquity of my sin in other words we can say here uh when you're acknowledging acknowledging something or when you're recognizing something this is not just once but like every day every hour every minute every second you have to say Lord if I have done something wrong please forgive me amen now and we have some other scriptures if you're going to take note of them but this is very important if you find yourself in a situation where you need God's forgiveness I will say one first thing that you can do is acknowledge that you have done wrong amen and we have another one you know and if we think a little bit about it and we go back to the to the prophets in the in in the Old Testament every single time they will have to go and and request something from the Lord even though they were they were not uh they have not uh kind of done anything wrong against the Lord they will always say Lord we have sinen against you we are living in a way that you don't want us to leave we come here to acknowledge our fault amen Jeremiah we we had it there Jeremiah 313 it says only know and understand and acknowledge your iniquity and guilt that that you have rebelled and transgressed against the Lord your God and have scattered your favors among strangers on their every Green Tree and you have not obeyed my voice says the Lord in other words the Lord is telling you acknowledge recognize that you have done something wrong what happened with this young man he went he he when he was you know with the in in the in the in the mighty in the mighty place or with the with the swine he was recognizing you know what I have to go back and I have to my father I have sinen against Heaven I have sinen against God and I have sinen against your side father forgive me that's what he said did did did the father rejected him no not at all so first thing we said you have to acknowledge second thing repent and ask to be forgiven why because many people they just acknowledge and they stay there they don't ask for forgiveness they they they they they think that if they have done something wrong they don't have to be they don't have to ask for forgiveness but God is telling us if I if I if I have acknowledged something I have to repent and ask and I have to ask for forgiveness amen now the prophet of God says Jesus said repent every one of you and Peter did and I mean Peter did it on the on the day of Pentecost repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost when you have TR truly repent and believe on the Lord now if we see here in the Book of Luke 5:32 and and is saying here I have not come to Rouse and invite and and call the righteous but the Airing ones in other words Jesus is talking and he saying I had I didn't come to the to the heal I came to the to the sick ones amen those not free from sin and what is he what has he come to them for to repentance to change their minds for the better and and hardly to amend their ways with a abhorrence of their past sins that is what the Lord wants he wants you to repent as we said the first one is to acknowledge the second one is that we have to repent and then acts 3:19 it says so repent change your mind in purpose turn around and return to God that your sins may be erased that times of refreshing and uh of a Reviving with fresh air we can see here may come from the presence of the Lord so in other words every single time that we repent brother Paul was preaching he's like when the Lord is coming with this refesh pring times in when he's coming to give you rest is when you you can enter into into into a rest with Christ and and and again I'm talking to you young people because now the situation or how things are are are going on you know like the the enemy is coming constantly and he's attacking your mind is is is bringing you know those thoughts is bringing those ideas that that go uh that they go against against against the word of God and that's we're talking about these things that you know every single time that that we that we uh make a m say we we make it right amen because if God had mercy on the on the prodigal son he had he can have mercy on you if you're going through a situation today amen now in the Book of Revelations 3:19 It also says here when he's giving the message to the last Church AG or like to one of the church ages here here he says to Those whom I dearly and Tenderly love I I tell their faults and convict and convince and reprove and chasen I discipline and instruct them so be enthusiastic and in Earnest and burning with Zeal and repent change your mind and attitude so what do we say we have to acknowledge first first the second thing we have to repent and ask for forgiveness and and and it but if it has to be like something that is coming from your heart that you say Lord I didly sorry I didn't mean it I didn't want to do it that way but you have to be honest amen now we said the first one was acknowledge and second one was repent and then there's another one that is hard for many people because it requires to confess your fault I'm going to tell you this this is beautiful because once your fault has been confessed it doesn't have power over your life confession sets you free it is one of the greatest things that could happen to a person a load is taken from you the doesn't have power over you anymore how many can say and rejoice on that that once you have confessed your fault nothing there will be any anything you know it's like let me put Let me give you this example you know some of you may like your chocolate chip cookies right so let's say your mom cooked them and and she said but you are not supposed to have them after you have had dinner right and then what happened you know as you love sweets and and you love those cookies then you're going to be like okay I have to wait I have to wait but then suddenly you know there is something that you start you know what I'm gonna eat it and when you were little you ate that cookie and your mom knew that you did it but she was like who did it who did it and everybody were like no we don't know and you were like no I don't know I don't know and then suddenly there was something in your little heart when you were a child and you were like you know what it was me Mom and what would your mom what would she do she wouldn't kind of say oh you did it oh no she will say you know what that's fine or sometimes mom will give you a a little a little bit of Fellowship amen but at the end of the day if I asked you today how would you feel after you confess it was there was there some Freedom that you were like oh I was able to confess it well that's the exact same thing that the Lord is in inviting us to do today that we can confess and that we can come and say Lord I have done this wrong I ask your forgiveness you know that's very important that we can come to the Lord with a with a sincere heart because it's what the Bible says that that a sincere heart uh he will not reject amen now in the message he cares do you care listen what the prophet of God says he says I think one of the things that's that keeps our people from being healed is the lack of confession is the lack of sincere of sincere confession and then he said God's provided way is repentance confessions and showing the results bringing forth fruit meat for repentance showing sincerity amen so what can we say here this world and he said it in this in in in in in this quote but it's a little bit lengthy so that's why I didn't put it here but he said in in in in this quote the prophet of God says you need this world needs repentance this world needs to repent because this is what is causing so many trouble but we know that this already finished that the Lord is just finishing his work in us but if people will really repent if people will really confess in people really be honest the Lord can use that honesty and bring something greater in that people amen so to you as a young PE as a young girl or as a Young Man the Lord is telling you if there is something that you've have found yourself again in a prison you know as as we have been saying here that W man if you didn't obey the first time the Lord is Mindful and he's telling you you know what the one thing that you have to do here if if you can do it you acknowledge you uh you you repent you confess and and and I can take that confession and set you free would you like to receive that today I believe that the Lord is mindful mindful o of your confession he he's close to those that are are are are are crying out to him and are saying Lord I'm sorry I didn't mean it I didn't want to do this I didn't I didn't want to do that but forgive me and he's able to forgive you amen now we if we look here there's another scripture that I would like to give you today the Book of Proverbs chapter 28 verse3 it says he who covers his trans transgressions will not Prosper but whoever confesses and forsakes his sins will obtain Mercy how many one obtain Mercy you can read that scripture and you can practice this principle confess your your your mistakes to the Lord and say Lord I have not done it the right way please forgive me we have another scripture 1 john9 and it says if we freely I'm reading from the Amplified version so if we freely admit that we have sinned and confess our sin our sins he faithful you know the Lord as the Bible says even when we ar faithful he remains faithful that's that's that's the the the greatest thing you know that even that we have done what we have done in our past but we have repented we have confessed we we have acknowledged it then he remains faithful a amen he's faithful and just true to his own nature and promises and he will forgive our sins and he just don't forgive but he forgets he places your sins in the Seal of forget forgetfulness amen he cleans us from all unrighteousness everything that is not in Conformity to his will in purpose in thought and in action that's his promise that's his gift and then James 5 5:116 says confess to one another Therefore your faults your sleeps your false steps your offenses your sins and pray for one another that you may be healed and restored through a spiritual tone of mind and heart the earnest heartfelt continued prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available and and we can say dynamic in its working what are we saying here that somebody if somebody here can be sick or or is is dealing with something but if there is something hidden there that that hasn't been con confessed the Lord cannot work in your life the prophet of God gives us an gives us an example of of a of of a couple you know this sister she was so sick and and the prophet of God will pray for her and she will get delevered but a little bit later she will get sick again and they were wondering why is she getting sick again every single time then the prophet of God one of the times he he he the angel of of the Angel of the Lord came and visit visit his home and what happened he then they they called the sister she came and the Lord God revealed some things or something that she she had H uh seen uh or in in like a few a year or a few years before but that she she she said I have them in my heart and I have I have asked for gift you know but the prophet of God says but sister uh when when he's talking about these things is like at the end of day the main purpose of how the prophet is telling us is that if you have seen or if you have done something again uh your your your your brother or your sister you have to go and make it right in this case after this sister made it right what happened the Lord set her free and that's what he wants for us today if there is something that needs to be confessed that we can say you know what Lord I'm so sorry I confess Lord if I have done something against my sister or again my against my brother against my father against my mom I'm gonna go and tell them to forgive me amen now listen let me share my screen again here very quick this is what the prophet of God says that UNC conf best sin and and they could he says like they could pour for our you know for uh oil on on your head till they got a gallon on there they could Stomp and kick and snort and run across the platform and screening holler but that devil will stay right there he's got a right to and as long as he's got a right to stay he will hold his grounds in other words when that devil is not exposed when that thing that you have to confess is not exposed the enemy is is going to have a hole in your life amen so you want to live a Victorious life if you have done something wrong just go and say Lord I'm sorry and if I done it against my brother against my sister God can can can come in and and bring that you know that that freedom to you and then this is the end of the quote and they confess their sins and uh they they came back you know with their arms around one another coming up and and um and then I I I wanna I want to focus here and I said now it is different now by God's grace and by the authority of God's word Satan will have to leave you that's right and and then the prophet of God says then there he left and she is the happiest little woman there in new oven Indiana she's testifying everywhere her and her husband both live a victorious victorious life that's what you want for your life today as I said before first thing we have to acknowledge second thing we have to repent the third thing we have to confess but don't stay there don't stay just in in in let's say in those three steps or whatever but the Lord is telling us to go to to go to press to keep going forward to keep to keep pressing on Amen so now we can write down or if you're taking some notes Here There is one more thing that the Lord is inviting us to do today he is asking us to press on and to go forward to don't dwell in your mistake you know because that's where the enemy always always will try to get you when you have made a mistake and and he will always come in because that's what the Bible says that he is the accuser of the Brethren amen but we have a a a high priest that he's always interceding for us but and now he's inviting us and he's telling us don't dwell in your mistake if you have acknowledged you have repent you have confessed just keep pressing on keep pressing on Amen now John 811 it says talking to the woman you know that was cut in in in the the act of sin it says she answered no one Lord and Jesus said I do not condemn you either go on your way and from now on sin no more as I said if you have made a mistake or if you have done something wrong don't dwell in that mistake because that's where the enemy can get can get you and that's where the enemy that's what he did with with that prodal son you know one mistake led him to another and another mistake and there where he found himself at the end of the day he found himself with the swine there with the with with the with everything was was was nasty can you imagine that but out of that the Lord had mercy on his life and he made him go back to his mind and say how many how many higher servants are in My Father's House and I am here he said I will go and and I will ask him to forgive me and I will I have a knowledge I have repented I have confessed and I'm gonna press forward that's what the Lord is inviting you to do today if there is something it doesn't matter the age that you are in it doesn't really matter what matters is if daily you can come to the Lord and say Lord forgive me Lord I have not done the right thing Lord I have lied to my parents I I have I I have watched the wrong website Lord please forgive me the Lord is willing to forgive you but don't as I said it here don't dwell in your mistake because if you dwell in your mistake every single time the enemy is going to get you amen now another scripture Deuteronomy 5:33 and it says you shall walk in all the ways which the Lord your God has commanded com commanded you that you may leave and that that it may go well with you and that you may live long in the land with which you shall possess and then John 812 it says Once More Jesus addressed the crowd and he said I am the light of the world he who follows me will not be walking in the dark but we have the light which is life would you like to have that in your life that is what the Lord is inviting us today and what we can say here if we can bring this to an end and if you can if we can see we can say this that even how he didn't hear his Watchmen and the warnings God is still gave him a second chance and I can say tonight that you still have an opportunity to M your way he is the god of Second Chances don't forget that he is the god of a second chance but what can we say here how can I get out of my prison I will acknowledge Lord I will repent I will confess my fault and I will press on Amen so if you have something today if you have something in your heart that you want to ask the Lord to forgive you he's willing to forgive you amen if I can as I can if I can say it this way from a personal experience by applying these principles the Lord has given me a Victorious Life from experience and I can tell you if you just yield your heart to the Lord you just tell him Lord please is is there something that I have to ask you forgiveness for I want to repent I want to confess I want to acknowledge it Lord and I want to go forward because that's what the Lord wants us today he wants us to keep pressing on Amen we all can stand there where you are and if you can build an altar in your heart today and you can ask the Lord Lord please we bow our heads and we can say Lord please come and SE search my heart come and search my life come and search my spirit is there something that I have to ask you forgiveness for is is is there something Lord that I have done that I that I don't remember that that needs to be uh brought to my memory Lord that it can be fixed it can be made right right they're in your heart you know your heart you know what's on your heart and the Lord knows what's in your heart I just want to invite you today to say Lord forgive me Lord I bring all all all what I am all what I have or my mind my spirit my body I just want to dedicate it to you today bow your hearts there bow your heads there and let's pray Heavenly

you my brother amen what a wonderful wonderful word of God tonight I believe uh the Holy Spirit has made it quite clear to us that he's a god of Second Chance and that he is looking beyond your mistakes beyond your conditions Beyond uh the circumstances that you may be facing right now in your life uh you need to look to the word of God you need to look to the blood and you know we heard very clearly tonight about confession and I know a lot of people all of a sudden they start to think oh I got to confess and I've got to go and I got to confess to this person or that or who do I where where do I confess there is one mediator between man and God now if you've done something and you know it's very obvious and it's a brother or a sister or a friend or your mother your father or whatever it might be then you need to go and speak with them and let them know that that because but before you go to them I hope you've gone to God I hope you've gone to that to that Fountain to know that this is a personal walk that it's not about you you you know displaying your confession God is looking at your heart and God is looking at the sincerity of your heart that you go directly to him and that you enter into that relationship personally with him and then I can tell you it'll be a lot easier to go and confess to that person that you may have done wrong because God will work on that person too you know that's the beauty that we're dealing with a living Supernatural God you you don't have to worry that you're going to be uh oh I'm going to be ashamed I'm G to be uh embarrassed no God works in such ways that when you are sincere and you go to him first he'll make all things brand new he'll change the hearts of your friends your your your your family those that you've hurt those that you've made mistakes to or even the hurts and the scars and the anxieties that you've got to deal with as a young person because of the scars and the situations that you've had to deal with this is the god that we serve I believe this weekend was a tremendous opportunity for you to start all over again to have a brand new start and to be brand new amen God bless you all you um uh Sons and
