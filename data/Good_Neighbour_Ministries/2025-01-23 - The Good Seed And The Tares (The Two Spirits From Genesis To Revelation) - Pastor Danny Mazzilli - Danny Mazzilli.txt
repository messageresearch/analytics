best and God knows how to keep his his children amen praise God welcome everybody into the house of the Lord tonight we are going to start a bible study this evening on the Seven Seals I believe that um we're GNA be blessed by doing this study um it's it's probably the most important um I would say it's the most important event that had taken place right up until 1963 when uh God's prophet ET William Branham received the revelation of the Seven Seals amen and um we are now living in the seventh seal manifesting the word of God fulfilling God's purpose allowing the word to move through our lives vindicate himself amen praise God the revelation of the Seven Seals is an event that uh literally affects the entire world and more specifically even to the Gentile church because it was directly for the Gentile church but it was an event that was required in order for uh the prophecy of God's word to come into full manifestation and lead us right into the uh final days of the church Israel and the world as we know it amen there's going to be great change as we move from this uh dispensation into the millennial dispensation amen praise God so we don't want to miss the importance of the Seven Seals um I'm going to encourage you over these next few months to dive into them read them read your seven seal book again take the time every day to read a little bit listen to the messages listen to William Branham speak on each of those seals um you're going to be able to draw so much much more because the the word continues to unfold it continues to reveal and make known and manifest exactly what our part is in this day and in this hour amen praise God and so like the prophet said when that seventh seal was open the Bible became a brand new Bible because the book has been open now and the Revelation is is is coming clear and the Sun and Daughters of God that are under that seventh seal that were ordained to receive that portion of the word is now rejoicing in it because it's the life of the word and the life is in you now to manifest and show what it is that God wants to accomplish today this day this hour amen praise God and so we're going to look um you know to really um get a a clear understanding on the word and the opening of the seals I believe it's important for us to understand um the two spirits that you know started from Genesis to Revelation and to follow and to see how it's always been the two Spirits the spirit of Christ God himself and the spirit of Satan the Antichrist anti- word am amen and for us to fully understand the battle and what it is that we're facing in this day we need to understand how that Spirit of the Antichrist has been moving right from Genesis in the same way that we want to understand how the Holy Spirit has been condescending down moving through each and every one of his children to bring us to the hour that we're in right now amen so we're going to read um you can flip over to to um to our first scripture in Matthew chap 13 verse 36-39 before we do that we're going to pray father we so appreciate this opportunity Lord to now uh be able to start this brand new study on the uh Seven Seals lord it's always been a wonderful um joy to to to read the the seals and to listen to your Prophet Lord bring forth such wonderful understanding and Revelation Lord it truly uh is who we are lord it's it's what lit us up in these last days to make us recognize who we truly are and Lord we just ask that your spirit would now move through the speaker through the hearer Lord let your word become alive in each and every one of us let us see ourselves in the word as we uh look look into this study father and Lord may we see more of you in our lives Grant it we pray father uh have your way now Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen praise God glory to God then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house and his disciples came unto him saying declare unto us the parable of of the tears of the field and he answered and said unto them he that Seth The Good Seed is the son of man talking about himself the field is the world the good seed are the children of the Kingdom those are the sons and daughters of God Amen but the tears are the children of the wicked one the enemy that sold them is is the devil the Harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the Angels amen God bless you may be seated glory to God so it's important for us to understand the Plan of Redemption to understand how everything began and how in the mind of God he had a plan and he was Elohim the self-existent one and in his mind mind he was Desiring to express himself to have a family to have um you know uh a son and a daughter that would that would Rule and Reign Over the Earth which was him expressing himself declaring himself a plan that he had in his heart and in his mind to redeem his children amen and that whole plan you know um had a had a a a deceiver that had to you know be in the midst of that plan in order for us to understand the light there would have to be darkness in order for us to understand good there would have to be evil and so God's Plan of Redemption because if you look at the word Redemption it means to redeem and to bring back something that was lost and so in order for to you know to bring something that was lost back something had to be lost amen and so God had this plan and you know we were there with him before the foundations of the world and he was explaining to us you know uh rejoicing we were rejoicing around the Throne of God and I I believe one day he said you know what you're going to have to go I'm I've got this plan and I'm going to send you down into the Earth I'm going to express I'm going to express us into another dimension we're going to call it Earth and we are going to go there and we're going to have Fellowship together but you're going to go through this whole plan of of uh um you know where you're going to forget who you are you what Lord you mean we're going to forget who we are he says yes you're going to forget who you are but then I'm gonna I'm going to send my word and you know my word oh yes Lord you're you're everything to us you're you're you're our life you we we feed on you all day long we Rejoice around the throne there's there's nothing greater but how can we possibly lose it he says well you're going to go into the these human bodies and you know he probably explained it but he says but don't worry you'll know my voice you'll know when I call you back you'll understand and know that it's me and then no other voice will you follow and so but he says but there's going to be a deceiver that's going to be in the midst and then this whole plan started to unfold itself in the mind of God and in that Dimension and Lucifer uh from before the foundations of the world he he he was watching all of this he was he was in the midst of it all but he was created for the purpose of deception that was his purpose and unless we understand that we start to you know look at the world and we look at evil and we look at the things that are going wrong around our lives and and and without that plan and that understanding that these that this is all part of God's plan that because you've recognized who you are because you've been given the ability to see that you're the good seed that was planted in the world then you understand better uh why the enemy is there why sickness comes into our Lives why things go so wrong sometimes and we wonder oh my gosh and we get all caught up into the circumstances of this life and fail to realize that this is all part of God's plan and unto you it has been given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom but God had this plan so designed because he knew that that that Satan would always be an impersonator he'd always be one to try and come in he came right there into the Garden of Eden he knew that God wanted to express his attributes himself in attribute form into individuals and express them onto the Earth that's why when he placed Adam and Eve there they were they were uh they were God the the two of them were where where God Adam uh and Eve was was was actually God expressed in a theop theophany form and all that he would have had to do was speak and bring forth each and every attribute of himself remember he's just expressing his thoughts and when he expresses his thoughts and speaks them they materialize so Satan was watching all of this and he says man I want to create I want to be worshiped I want that fellowship and so that's why when he went to Eve and he deceived her he was able to plant his seed in her because remember she was Adam's expression she came from the side of Adam she was God she was God expressed in female form but he knew that God had expressed them in such a way and that their body that once he created Adam it wasn't until he took from the dust of the earth and created Adam a body and breathed the breath of life into Adam that he actually became a living soul and that and that now every seed would bring forth of its own kind and so Satan saw this he saw a beding ground in Eve and he says if I can plant my seed in Eve I can create and I can be a Creator and then they will worship me me and this has been the thought and the mind of the enemy right from the very beginning and that's why he is very religious he knew the word he understood what was going on he can't receive revelation of what God is going to do and that's why God has always sealed up things because remember the Plan of Redemption doesn't fully culminate until the end time that's why the scripture said that that the tears are the children of the wicked one okay because there's two seeds two Spirits two Vines Jesus said I am the vine ye are the branches and so if you are of God you are going to come and be an expression of Jesus Christ if you're of the wicked one who planted his seed because he was a beast he was an upright being it wasn't a snake like they say he brought forth children on the earth and those children now have have a a nature in them and a character in them and their desire is going to be to worship their father regardless they cannot they can't worship God as much as they can put on a show that they're worshiping God okay they have they have a form of godliness but but then they deny the power which is the word because the power is all in the word and so God uh planned this whole Plan of Redemption so that the Harvest is at the end of the world in other words when time shall be no more when time shall be no more when this Earth will go from time and blend into eternity and that's why when we go into the millennium we as the Sons and Daughters of God time shall be no more for us we will not be governed by time we will not be controlled by by death though death will still be on the earth and people will survive and generations imagine 1,000 years on the earth there will be Generations after Generations that will be born and people that will live upon the Earth but the Sons and Daughters of God will be the government because the government will be upon his shoulders and there will be a brand new government and that government will be ruled by the righteousness of God's word Satan gets bound up for a thousand years so all those Wicked spirits that are anointing and possessing the people will be bound up for a thousand years and that's just around the corner Saints but we come back to the Earth after three and a half years that this earth goes through a massive tribulation period and Israel gets awakened Jesus Christ reveals himself to the Jews all of this is all part of the Plan of Redemption but it all happens in the end time and so God he sealed everything up up until the end so that Satan would not be able to impersonate and stop what it is that he's going to do now because at some point Redemption has to be completed right right and the enemy The Wicked one the devil has constantly infiltrated the churches and that's why you know uh the seven Church ages it was it was it started in Ephesus with Paul but the evil Wicked one was always moving and coming into the church and impersonating the Believers and then like Satan always does he pulls all those fallen angels that are in the children of the wicked one to worship Him and the way that he gets him to worship him he starts to introduce doctrines and that's why the doctrine of the Trinity right back in ad 325 was injected right away every baptism up until ad. 325 when they had the the meeting of the nian council every baptism up until that point was done according to the Bible in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you can actually go back and Google gole search it niasia Rome ad. 325 and the things that that when church and state came together through Constantine and they made the changes and they adopted church and state and they made the changes to baptize in the names in the titles of the father and the son and of the Holy Ghost and that right there was serpent doctrine that was that was the the mark of the beast Doctrine right there injected right into the lineage and and right there is where the where where Satan got right in there and he started moving with the church and that's why if you read the the seven Church ages and you go back and do a study of the seven Church ages you will see everything that we're going to be looking at as we go through this series on the Seven Seals the white horse rider the red horse rider the the the black horse rider and the pale horse rider those were all the different teachings and doctrines of that Antichrist Spirit moving from one Rider to the other but it was always Satan moving from one writer to the other from one Doctrine to the other infiltrating himself into the church so that he could get the people to go off the word but in every one of those Church ages there was Sons and Daughters of God those that were able to recognize the truth there was seed that was planted by the son of man Jesus Christ and every one of those ages had seed that would come into its maturity and those would be the ones that would believe the word and manifest Christ in their day and that's why when Luther caught the revelation of justification he broke away from the Catholic church and then Wesley comes along and he brings a revelation on sanctification and then the Pentecostals received the gifts all part of the body being restored the the original word being restored but then God sent a prophet the 20th century Prophet William Mariam Branham because there was so much teaching now was the time where God was going to finalize everything everything and that's why when when William brandham received that that Angelic visitation and the spirit of Christ came and said go back to Jeffersonville it is the time of the opening of The Seven Seals that was the time when God was going to start to unveil all the mystery that he had bottled up right from the the before the foundations of his world of the world which was Christ the mystery of God being revealed all the way down from Genesis all the way down through the Book of Revelation until we go into the Millennium and then the new heavens and the new Earth but he sealed everything up in those Seven Seals and in within those Seven Seals laid perfect Revelation perfect understanding and and divine revelation that only the elect of the last last days would be able to receive God was going to have a church that's why they get so confused when they read the book of Revelation they don't understand that it is a book that is that is actually concealed by Seven Seals the whole Bible was concealed by Seven Seals right up until 1963 even though things that that took place under the first seal the second seal right up until the Sixth Seal you know that the first and second world war was under the Sixth Seal it was all manifest under the Sixth Seal but yet brother brandham came after World War II but then the Holy Spirit was showing him everything all the Mysteries that were written under those seals so that so that it could be brought in our day and manifest and bring to the time of the opening of the seventh seal where you and I come in now you and I were not part of the first six seals most of us were born right around the time I was born in 1961 there was you know it was just a time where where brother brandham was was preaching on the seven Church ages a lot of us were born after even brother Bram left the scene and those of us that were here before our names our our our our representation didn't come into full light until the seals were open and in particular the seventh seal God had to hide us we were the we were the the the the the hidden revelation that was going to come forth after the opening of those seals that would would be the ones that would defeat the wicked one would not surrender to the wicked one we were the good seed that were placed under that seventh seal and God reserved it until the end time that's why Daniel said seal it up so here now let's let's let's move along here so the Lord sends his Messengers that's why it said in the end of the world and the reapers are the angels and angels are messengers and that's why there would be angels to every single Church age each one of those Church age Messengers were angels that God anointed to bring his word to that particular dispensation well the angel that he sent to our dispensation the seventh Church age dispensation was William Miriam Branham and that's why we don't worship the man a lot of people say why do you follow this guy well just go to a Lutheran and say why do you guys quote Martin Luther or go to the Presbyterians and and and go to the Anglican churches and and say well why do you guys uh quote John Wesley why do you got this big church Wesley Church you got this big statue of him the people recognized him because he received a revelation from God and he broke away from from the from the uh the the the unbelief that had infiltrated the churches because God had to have good seed in those churches and once his word came to season and time those seed would come to life and they would all all of a sudden Luther one day he's reading the Bible and he's reading there and all of a sudden the word the just shall live by faith and the Holy Spirit brought it to life the Bible to Martin Luther became a new Bible all of a sudden now everywhere he could see it's by Grace it's not by law you shall call no man father he's seen it in the scripture there's no mediator between man and God and Luther was caught up into all the the 14 Stations of the Cross and the Virgin Mary and and and sa this and Ain that and praying to all the saints and doing all the rituals with the smoke and everything else it's all witchcraft right amen and he realized it and his God awoken him God gave him a revelation and he broke away well this is exactly what's happened to you when William Branham was given the Revelation on the opening of the seals it was just the same way that Luther caught that understanding on on Revelation because the just shall live by faith means the just shall live by Revelation that it was a a a between you and God you need your own relationship right that's why you're a true Christian in this day and in this hour not because oh are you a Christian well I'm a Catholic I didn't ask you what church you went to are you a Christian well I'm a Baptist I'm a Jehova Witness I'm a presbyterian I'm an Anglican no no are you a Christian a Christian is somebody that is like the word Christlike the word So when you say to them baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ if they're a Christian they have the Holy Ghost in them amen and the opening of that seventh seal released the Holy Ghost for this hour to come to every elected seat of God and when the Holy Ghost come to you it it it it's always been following you it's always been around you because it's the attribute of God that's what the Holy Ghost is but it awakens you brings you into a cons conscious revelation of of the word and then all of a sudden now you're reading the word and it's making perfect sense you see baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's all the way through the Bible there's no other name whereby man must be saved but but by the name of Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ means Jehovah our savior because Jehovah God Elohim the self-existent one took on a body to be our savior and that's why Jesus Christ and the word Jehovah is Jesus our savior it's God taking on Humanity so that he could go and take your place in other words so that his word could not be broken remember heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall not pass away and when he said if a man sin a man must die then no matter what without Christ if you dis because sin is just unbelief the moment you disbelieve the word of God your soul is headed for death but if your soul has an attribute which is a portion of God himself in you written in the Lamb's Book of Life those whose names were written we read about these things they they they'll even teach them you know in Christian churches but they don't have a revelation that your name was written before the foundations of this world in the Lamb's Book and that's why Jesus could say all that the father all that I okay because he said if you've seen me you've seen the father you got to you know you got to get this trinitarian thing out of your mind because people think when Jesus says well the I do nothing L the father shows me what he was saying was that I do nothing that has not already been written and revealed in the mind of God because God knew from before the foundations of the world that you would answer and respond to this message amen praise God trying to lay in a a a good Foundation here so that we can understand as we go into these seals it it just makes everything so much clearer for us to really know why we believe what we believe people go to church and and and they go there to go to go have a nap a lot of people go to church just for a nap it's by tradition and they think that it's oh well at least I'm going to church every Sunday yeah it's good they say it is very beneficial to go and assemble yourself with people and clap your hands and sing hymns together it actually does you good physically and mentally too and mentally too absolutely but your soul must feed on the word if your if your soul is not feeding on the pure unadulterated word then you're just another church member and you're just going to this church going to that church and you and you know that's why you you when you talk to somebody about the word and you get into you know you meet somebody and you start and they say oh yeah you know I thank God and then you you know you start to lead them into the word God is the word and you start to show them in the scriptures you know what it says about proper relationship with God and how to receive the Holy Ghost and you could ask the question like Paul did when he seen the disciples in the book of Acts chapter 19 they were all excited about being you know that that God that Jesus Christ had come and that he had done great Miracles and and and they heard of all the things that he did but he looks at them and he says have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed it's not that I don't doubt you believe because you can go out there and you could walk down New Street and there's probably a dozen churches that you could walk into and you could ask them and walk into the first person that you see and say hey do you believe in Jesus Christ you're going to say what are you talking about of course we believe in Jesus Christ and you and then you say well how are you baptized and they'll say well if you go into a Catholic Church they say well I got baptized when I was a baby and then you'll go and show them in the word that baby baptism is not even in the scripture amen nowhere Jesus said he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved you see they think they're actually worshiping Jesus Christ but remember Satan is a very religious spirit and he knew that the only way because listen how could it be so deceiving in the end time because it said that that it would be so deceiving in this end time that it would deceive even the very elected of God those that are actually the seed of God because remember they're still in this human flesh and they're still dealing with a carnal mind that is at emity against God I can show you the scripture your carnal mind will deny the word just like Jesus told Peter he says Peter I know you would die for me but guess what you're going to deny me three times what yeah you're going to deny me three times because you're still in your human flesh you're still a human being and you're still susceptible to to the to this realm and that's why there's such a fight and a battle with this flesh to overcome and to deal with it and you think that this is what you are and you're looking at your situations and your circumstances and your problems and and and all of a sudden they become they they overwhelm you but I'm saying wake up Sons and Daughters of God Amen wake up to who you really are and that's why you could go down the street here and you could go into all the different churches you'll go into another one and and you'll say um do you um do you have women preachers in your church of course we do our head Pastor is is a woman I said well you know nothing against the woman or the pastor you know but did you realize that in the Scripture it says that she shall shall not preach she should not upsert Authority there's scripture where that's why Adam and Eve had their rightful positions in the word and that's why God never ever sent a prophet that was a woman that would come and say thus sayeth the Lord you show me one place in the Bible it's nowhere to be found not that God can't use women just like he used the Virgin Mary she was a blessed she was blessed amongst all women because God chose her body as a betting ground for his word to bring forth a body for himself and so she was blessed but we don't worship her because she was used she was she was she was that portion of the word that when Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive under the inspiration right at that moment God already knew it was going to be Mary of of uh the Virgin Mary the the one that he saw in his mind but that doesn't make her the mother of God how can God have a mother you understand you see all of these things and so a woman should not be a preacher or have a position of authority in the church to minister the word of God it's as simple as that now I don't want to get into all of that but you'll see but they'll turn around and say oh no no no no and they'll deny the word and when they've denied the word it's because the seed of the wicked one has taken control of their lives they have a form of godliness but they deny the power power of God's word in that he said it shall not return to me void let every man's word be a lie and my word be the truth he said in the scripture so why would we take a man's teaching or doctrine over the word of God but you see that's why God sealed everything up until the last days until the end time and that's why we are going to do this study on the seals and what it's going to do is it's going to completely open up and make so clear and anybody that that dares to to study and to search the scriptures those that have not received the Holy Ghost yet those that are listening in online that are listening in and wondering what it is that we teach here we don't teach our own doctrines we don't teach our own uh you know uh interpretation on the word of God everything that we teach is directly from the word and that's why we challenge you to read the word we quote William Maryam Branham because we recognize him as the prophet of Malachi 4:5 we recognize him as the seventh angel to the seventh Church age Revelations 10 1-7 we recognize him as the angel that would be on the earth at the time he's not the mighty Angel he was the man in the office of a prophet and that's why if you go back and you actually study like like you know go back and study Billy Graham everybody knows about Billy Graham go back and study about Oral Roberts everybody knows about Oral Roberts he was the he was the the the the Pentecostal King everybody knows that Billy Graham was the Protestant King he was the messenger he was one of the two angels right that was sent into the world Billy Graham Oral Roberts were the two angels that were with MDC when he went to Abraham and sent two angels into Sodom and Gomorrah to go tell them to repent and come out because God was going to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah but Abraham was a type of William Branham whom the Holy Spirit MDC was with at the time and that's why if you go back and you actually do a study and actually study don't just read the the the commentaries when you do a search William brandham on the internet and he comes up and the first thing that you might see is cult and right away oh not going any further why what's the matter you don't have your own ability to search the scriptures the Bible says search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life could you be wrong you you need to Deep dive and look into his life read his life story read about his ministry in the 1930s all the way through 1965 doctor's affidavits FBI documentation showing that that the light the the light that actually appeared over William Bram in 1950 in Houston Texas was a supernat natural light they scientifically proved it by the picture through a forensic testing of those pictures that that Pillar of Fire was actually something Supernatural and the healings and the people that were healed the meetings that were held there was meetings where there was thousands tens of thousands of people at meetings world all over the world seven times God said sent him around the world where meetings that he would Minister in the meetings and they would have to send in a tractor trailer to remove all the crutches and the stretchers and the hospital beds because of the people that were healed in those meetings never since Jesus was on the earth were there Miracles and healings and and raising from the dead where it was proven a child that was dead for 10 hours that morning from the morning and it finally the Holy Spirit showed brother brandham when the when the the deacons came to to William brandham and said uh Mr Bram there's a woman that's been here since this morning she's got a dead baby in her arms wrapped in a blanket and she says she wants to see you she wants you to pray for that baby and William branam he he he said well just you know tell her that you know there's nothing I can do unless the Holy Spirit showed me something there what can I do and as he was sending them to go and and go and tell her that you know that that we'll pray for her and this and that right there a vision broke right in front of him and he's seen the baby in his arms looking at the child and he's seen it come back to life he said who wait a minute he says go get the woman and bring me the woman with the child you can go back and you can read about it you can look it up that's just one story and right there in his arms in front of thousands of people thousands of people were converted in that meeting that night that child came back to life and and the doctors signed affidavit saying that that child was dead that morning they had pronounced a child dead now you tell me a child after 10 hours well that's no problem because lot Lazarus was in the grave four days we're talking about God he still can raise the dead did you know that he still raises the dead he still because there's a lot of people that come into churches that are more dead spiritually than anybody else because eternal life is the real life amen not this life you could live this life and you could have the riches of this life and your soul has be going right straight to Hell amen but come into the presence of the Lord and let the word awaken you to who you really are and then you come to realize wait a minute I am an attribute of God I am actually a seed that was sown by the son of man and I can recognize the word of God in my day and I've come and identified myself with the word amen and so understanding the placing and the positioning of these Angel Messengers because he said in in in the the harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the Angels it's not going to be angels that are going to fly down and appear before you and say oh Michelle you are a daughter of God that's not the way it's going to happen God has placed an attribute there and if there's an attribute there and the word is being preached something in her soul and in her heart is going to burn and it's going to say that's nothing but the truth and it's going to want to feed on the word of God it's going to want to feed on God's word it's going to want to hear the word of God because that attribute knows that Faith cometh by hearing the word and that's why it can't wait to get into the presence of the Lord not some church service where you're going to go have a nap where you're going to hear God's word speaking directly to your heart and bring you to a place where you realize that this is this is real this is not something that my mom and dad were religious Fanatics about because you know a l I know a lot of you young people your friends you know telling you that oh you go to church a lot eh are your are your family like really religious and kind of Fanatics or what just wait till the fire starts to really fall and tribulation starts to really come a little closer to home they're going to be asking you questions they're going to be wondering wait a minute here all those things that you were talking about I'm starting to see them a lot of people are starting to wake up to realize wait a minute here you talked about you know cars that would be able to drive by themselves years ago you talked about you know women presidents I know we haven't had it yet but we see the signs and and and and we know that brother Brenham didn't didn't say that it would actually be a woman now don't get me wrong it still could come there it could easily come who knows next time four years from now it could be Trump's daughter that's going to be running for the president of the United States or some other woman that's going to rise up because the woman is is is being accepted into those positions we had a woman vice president in kamla Harris and she ran for president and a lot of the Bible you know a lot of the message Believers were saying there she is that's the one she's going to win but that wasn't in God's plan that's why don't be looking to that be listening for the word and what the word is doing in your life a lot of people are just looking for signs and wonders to vindicate that they're actually a part of the Bride instead of looking for the signs and wonders in them in you Christ in you the word manifesting through you speaking through you praying through you glory to God Amen we haven't even gotten started here we're just on the first scripture we're going to end here in another seven minutes okay praise God but listen here let's move on here so we're looking at the good seed and the tears now listen to brother Brenham here in the seed of discrepancy 1965 he says and then the vision was interpreted now he was telling the story of you know how he seen the when he went to that Pentecostal meeting and and you know he met a Pentecostal there and he met one Pentecostal and because of this the the spirit of discernment and the gift that God had given brother brandham he could see their lives he could see that they were actually what if they were genuine seed or if they were actually tears God gave them the ability to see their lives because remember when he talks about the seed which is the word and the word gets into you then by your fruits you shall be known by the life that you live by the manifestation of your life your hidden life the person that you really are don't show me you know that you can be in church every every Sunday and every Wednesday night and then go out there and have a mouth like a like a like a [Laughter] pirate F bombs dropping left right and center and everything else that tells me the kind of fruit that's coming out praise God people people say I'm a Christian I go to church and you listen to them talk for 10 minutes and they'll drop at least a half a dozen F bombs while they're talking it's not what goes in that defiles it's what the kind of spirit that's inside that what comes out that shows the kind of seed Spirit that's actually in there so brother brandham was was talking about this experience that he had and he says my God this one was a total hypocrite and he was there praising God speaking in tongues and everything else and this one was a genuine Christian humble Spirit two different seeds so he's talking here and now he's he's and so then and then the vision was was interpreted to him the rain falls on the just and the unjust The Same Spirit can fall in a meeting and everybody rejoice in it Hypocrites Christians and all together exactly right he says but what is it by their fruits they are known see that's the only way it can ever be known then you see that now since Wild Oats or wild wheat and grain sometimes impersonates a genuine so he's talking about seed how you can actually go and and and and Harvest Grain and there'll be actual wild wheat mixed in there that looks just like the grain but it's not it's an impersonator one will actually bring forth life again you plant that seed that grain in the ground it'll bring forth life the other one you plant it it just dies because the life of the word is not in that seed it's one of the seed of the wicked one and remember Satan's serpent seed Satan's seed has a be beginning and an end it's not the Eternal Word that's why animals have a beginning and an end that's why the humans because of the original sin that took place back in the Garden of Eden humans were not supposed to die they were supposed to be expressed by the spoken word Adam would have looked at Eve and said eve bring forth Jennifer bring forth Phillip bring forth Eugene now maybe those weren't your real names from before the F but whatever it was and you would have come into full manifestation in a form of a theophany having no beginning and no end because you're an attribute of God it's just God expressing himself in different attributes and giving those attributes the ability to Fellowship one with the other it's God and so here now you can have a seed that originated from The Serpent and that's why the Bible says there are children of God and there are children of the devil amen that's why Jesus stood before the priests and the Pharisees St John chapter 6 and he's talking to them and they're saying we are Abraham's seed these priests and these Pharisees these they could read the Scrolls off off by heart they didn't even need to to they didn't need to open the Scrolls they knew all the scriptures you know off by Heart by memory and they're saying we're Abraham's seed just like today all the different churches you got you got thousands of different teachings and the nomin and they're all claiming I'm Abraham's seed even the Muslims and it's true they are of Abraham's seed but they're of the wild seed that came as a result of unbelief because Sarah did not believe that God could bring forth a son through her and she decides to give Abraham her Bond woman Hagar and says take her and Hagar brought forth Ishmael which today is the father of the whole Muslim nations and they claim Abraham as their father and it's true but they were not given the promise the promise was given to Isaac who brought forth Jacob who brought forth who who went from Jacob to Israel we're going to be looking at a lot of that this Sunday and so here now there's an impersonator and that's why if it is an original seed word it'll have an end and so here brother Braham says that domestic grain so close that it would deceive the very elect I think we're living in a timely age when these things should be preached on and talked about and that's why we're going to be preaching on and talking about this as the back bone and the foundation so that when we we do the study on the seals we will see those two vines that have been operating right from the Garden of Eden and you'll even find out that it even started before then when Lucifer fell and Drew a third part of the Angels unto himself let the musicians come we're going to be looking at that let's read the next and he goes on to say here he could not depend on some certain Church to separate them now he's talking about separating the wheat from the chaff okay the seed of discrepancy if you go back and you listen to this message it's all about you know the seed of discrepancy how that you know there's the wheat seed and there's the the tears and he goes on he says God could not depend on churches to separate them say the methodists or the Baptist or the Pentecostals to separate them he said he sends his angels his Messengers to separate them not even we not even us ministers we're not separating the sheep from the goats it's still the mighty Angel himself it's still Christ himself the angel Messenger to this age that's why when when we get to the seventh seal you're going to you're going to realize that that it's no longer a a one-man Ministry it's no longer just a a William Branham or a Billy Graham or or one of the seven Church age Messengers it's Christ himself now who has come down to possess the five-fold ministry to separate the wheat from the chaff to bring the rain into the barn into the body of Christ amen and so he says he couldn't use uh any man in other words an Angel is coming to bring the separation the segregation between the right and the wrong and no one can do that but the angel of the Lord it was always the mighty Angel himself the holy spirit that would possess those Messengers he's the one that is going to tell which is right and which is wrong God said he will send his angels at the last times in the end time not Angels down through here but Angels at the last time and would gather together we know that this is the coming Harvest time now now an angel is actually interpreted a messenger go to the next one now he said the seed of God the word of God Jesus said in a certain place that the word is a seed and every seed will bring forth of its kind and now if the Christian the Christian the children of God the children of the Kingdom has become the seed of God then they must be the word of God did you hear that if you have the seed of God in you it means that you are the word of God amen amen manifested in the age that they're living in for the promised seed of that age you see it you're a seed of God that will come into manifestation in the appointed time that God has appointed you individually that's why there's still people that you can invite to church and that you can share the message with because if the word which is the holy spirit comes upon the seed that's in them and that seed is a seed of the kingdom and he says and then you become children of the Kingdom the seed of God then it must be the word of God and the word of God manifested in the age that they're living in for the promised seat of that age God gave his word at the beginning and each age has had its seed it's time and it's promise and that's why you are the promised seed for this day and for this hour and you will bring forth the word in your day praise God we're going to end it right there father we thank you so much for just fellowshipping with us around your word and just being in our midst than
