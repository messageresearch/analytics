come tonight Lord You're the same yesterday today and forever father Lord grant these things in Jesus name we pray amen hallelujah we're going to go to Ephesians 1 3. read a little lengthy scriptures here amen we get we have scriptures for today we have Noah's message Noah's message is great and there are scriptures in the Bible that are great and it's all the word of God right just like there's quotes in the message and it's all the word of God but there's a lot of scriptures for our day that's what brings us faith that is being fulfilled in this day it's just like the message God sent a 20 a 20th century Prophet right and we have many many quotes but some of those quotes are for brother Graham's day some of the scriptures are for Noah's day but then there's a lot of scriptures for us there's quotes that relate to us in our day and that's what's going to bring us faith when they open up to us amen and as ministers we got to break in to those the spirit of God to bring the word for our day what what is our day today our day is perfect Faith amen perfect realization of who we are amen and that's what the seed does when it wakens up Ephesians 1 3. blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to his good pleasure of his will amen he has chosen us I mean we read this we read this but when it's quickened to us is a different story it's a different reaction and brings life to us we see here that he has chosen us we've heard this over and over and over and that he has predestinated us now listen closely and keep that in mind as we go through here to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he had made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood and forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he had abound towards us in all wisdom and Prudence Heaven may know and unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure he had which he had purposed in himself that in the disposition of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are in Earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise His glory who first trusted in Christ in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after you believe were sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory wherein I also after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love to All Saints cease not to give thanks making mention of you in my prayers that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him that the eyes of your understanding be enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and the riches of his glory of his inheritance in the Saints and what is exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power wow there's a lot wrapped up up in there but but what's wrapped up in there is us and him it's the promises that he has given us the assurance that all that he has called will come Amen in this hour Hallelujah Romans 8 1. now we're talking about the seed that has awakened in this hour there is therefore no now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus had made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sent in his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh for the sin condemns sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is at enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but Yea are not but ye are not in the flesh you see he's talking to a Pacific people here ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit now listen four times he says in the next couple of verses here's if and that's a big if if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raise up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by the spirit that dwelleth in you God bless you as you seated if the spirit dwells in you it will Quicken your mortal bodies by The Same Spirit that dwells in you Hallelujah you know when I read these scriptures and I read the word of God I I come to realize that that is not me as the scripture says my flesh is weak I could not serve God by my flesh I cannot serve God by my carnal mind and and I I look at the elements right I look at my weaknesses and I look at all these things and and if that's what you're looking at you can never serve God you can never look into the scriptures and what is Promised in this hour and this day to the Bride of Jesus Christ and say how can I live that because it's not us that lives it it's not it's the seed of God it's the attribute that God allotted for us in this age he allotted a word for every age we look at justification we look at sanctification we look at the baptism of the Holy Ghost those were seas that were allotted for that day and that age and they produced that you're looking you look go back Luther produced justification Wesley produced sanctification in the people the baptism of the Holy Ghost the day of Pentecost those genuine seeds produce the scriptures it wasn't a fake uh uh religious uh uh uh false interpretation life it was genuine lives that was that the seed was producing in their day and their age well we have a seed that was released in our day today and and only only that seed like brother Brown's seen the vision of the woman walking up she was justified she was Sanctified she had the baptism of the Holy Ghost she has gifts in their life but she left off one word what the word for the day for today and he's seen her fallen into the pits of hell because we have a word that is allotted for our day today my brothers and sisters that we must come into amen come into the understanding the enlightenment into it Hallelujah he breaks the seals and reveals and gives us an inheritance to his people he gives the inheritance that he inherit becoming Kinsmen Redeemer and he freely gives it out to us It All Belongs to him he was the one who redeemed oh the it's these seals opening up just beginning to reveal the Plan of Redemption how he did it Paul told us in the first chapter of Ephesians that God before the foundation of the world had predestinated us unto the adoptions of sons through Jesus Christ and John tells us here in the Book of Revelations that in the last days there will be religious people amongst us Cults and organizations amongst us that would try to deceive the very elected if it were possible but it's not when you look at the even look at that quote it's not the religious people out there that's going to deceive the very elect or try if it were possible it's right here it's here where where they're not preaching right present truth being established because the seed can only feed Amen on present truth that's why you don't feed off of a man you don't feed off of me or any Minister you feed off of him the spirit that brings present truth and that's what testifies it doesn't matter how educated you are how well of a Preacher you are it's the spirit inside that brings life that testifies God will always confirm where he's and where he's moving by what by bringing life perfect Faith awakens the seed of God in us in this hour perfect faith is God's tool that he uses to lift the veil of spiritual amnesia in each age there's a lot at word the word of God is a seed in this age the Seven Seals being opened and the Mysteries being revealed to the bride this faith is perfect and complete people that don't believe that the seals have been opened they don't realize when the seals were open the lamb opened the seals he spoke and when he spoke he spoke those seeds and those seeds are here tonight on the earth they are growing they are manifesting and they are coming into maturity to fulfill all that is promised to the bride see the bride doesn't waver the bride is not lukewarm and lazy and locked no she's not she's like Abraham's faith no matter how long she's waiting in certain areas of her life she knows God is going to fulfill his promise and bring forth the word and there's a promise to the Bride of Jesus Christ in these last days that he's going to fulfill you see this Faith to the bride is perfect and complete it brings perfect realization and everything the bride needs to overcome and it reveals the new birth for this hour and being under this birth brings a full manifestation of Christ in her I'm trying to get into the get into the thought of this amen bring in the real birth in this hour my so many different births Brother Brad I'm talking in the rising of the Sun he says dead seeds he said oh God don't let there be dead seeds amongst us but let there be seeds that will come to life eternal life all these things are just mirrored traditions what good would it do whether you had lent or not lent if there's no life in you it's only a memorial which there's nothing against it but they have certainly carried out their traditions but left off the main thing I wonder man is always that way until the Holy Ghost comes in the man's life carrying out traditions traditions in the message traditions in their life but if there's no life there now listen Satan doesn't care how religious you are or how right you are in your Doctrine if you miss that life you won't come up anyhow no matter how religious how good how many churches you belong to or will belong to how many churches you jump around to thinking oh I'm going to go to this message church I'm going to go the words over here in this message Church the words over here in this message are jumping jumping back and forth what what does any of that have to do with anything what does any Traditions have to do with anything it's the life it's the life in the sea has to be in there and that's what's coming to The Showdown in this hour that's what's coming into perfect faith and perfect realization and Rapture in faith in this hour in the bride that's what God is going to show off in this hour that's short quick work has been preparing that seed has been growing in the ground being nurtured by Water by Rain by the moisture of the Holy Ghost by trials Temptations and deaths and it's coming to that place in this hour it doesn't matter one thing unless you have been born again when we look deeply at our own spiritual lives we can see the image of the seed this is a great analogy for the spiritual path on so many levels everything we need for Spiritual Awakening is contained within each of us in the seed the very blueprint of enlight enlightenment Made In His Image all we need to do is water the seed of the soul and do everything we can to support its growth by making choices one after another that places the seed in water and in light and in Divine substance of his presence that's how we do it making choices one after another feeding that life and that's what the bride is doing in this hour that's what the spirit inside the True Believer is do it in this hour she's making choices one after another not to not to satisfy the pleasures of the flesh not to satisfy the carnal mind she knows the difference between she knows the two like Paul says he says oh Wretched Man that I am he knew the difference between The Wretched Man and the man Christ Jesus inside of him he knew that he was redeemed he knew that he he had the Holy Spirit the new birth inside of him he knew he was predestinated for a purpose knowing that is the most important thing when she recognizes who she is knowing who she is amen and all so many different levels knowing who she is in her life that's what's consuming the Bride of Jesus Christ in this hour that she's being possessed and consumed by the revelation of who she is in this hour that she's not up and what does it do when when Revelation comes it does two things that exposes Satan and it reveals God it exposes the Flesh and it reveals the seed of God inside of her and it re it exposes all the works of her flesh I'm talking about you personally in your life and it reveals the spirit of God when the spirit of God is pleased when you're walking and moving by faith amen you see in Galatians 5 6. it says this this I say then walk in the spirit that you you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh for the lust of the flesh lusted against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary one to another so yea cannot do the things that you would but if you be led of the spirit you are not under the law in Romans 12 1 I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is good and acceptable perfect will of God amen I know we read these scriptures we've been reading them for 10 20 30 years and and and uh these these scriptures amen they come alive more and more the word has to meet the challenge of the age the word has to meet and raise like the Bible's brother Brown said when the enemy comes in as a flood God will raise the standard what he'll make the word more real to you in other words personally in your individual lives God will come and make that word more real amen he will show you he will show you like he said right there he'll show you how to present your body a Living Sacrifice he'll raise a standard as you walk and as you grow it'll constantly grow with you the seed will grow the plant will grow and it comes out of the seed and it produces what it's supposed to produce in this hour Hallelujah it will constantly be showing you where you're being conformed to this world you see God could not show you everything when you first come in they couldn't it would kill you you can never live but here we are 30 years later amen the Bride come into a place in her maturity in this hour where God can show her deep things that separates her that he can have the preemus in her life and he can possess her but you got to be willing you got to be willing that's all you have to do is be willing to yield Your Vessel and become under obedience as we're going to see here there was the first sheath come up from all the prophets which was the son of God and the king of all the prophets there there has been churches and churches and there have been brides and Brides but there has to come a real bride there has to come a real bride it's spoken and already prophesied by the prophet in this hour there must come one that's not only got the mechanics the word word word word word I got the word I got the word you got to line up with the word word word it's not just the mechanics but it's the Dynamics is when the Dynamics the spark hits the gasoline amen and produces amen the power that's going to run through the engine the power that's going to move that car move that life inside of you what good is it if you got word word when you don't got any life inside of you you need to life you'd eat the spark in the gasoline to bring forth the life to bring forth the power that will cause you to overcome and become what he said that you are and what he said that you are that makes the church live and move in the power of his resurrection until we come to that place until we find that place until we come to that place in our individual walks in our experience until we come to that place what good does it do to polish the hubs what good does it do for her to give herself a facelift what good is it will it do to wear long hair long dress act polite all those things are respected but what good does it do nothing unless there's life in there that don't mean nothing in this day and age my brothers and sisters that through the Bride of Jesus Christ all this religious Acts all this Pious Acts is all becoming dead to her there's nothing to her it doesn't even move her anymore because she's lifted way above that you know we we always justify ourselves you know to try to not make ourselves look like anything but in reality we are something which God says I'm something I'm something yeah I'm not gonna I'm not gonna just belittle myself but all these things all these these religious acts and all these religious uh formal Traditions that people are doing are nothing because the Bride of Jesus Christ is moving and operating in his life he's in hurt revealing himself he she knows and and only she knows more than anybody else that she is nothing you don't have to tell her that she's nothing you don't have to tell her that she can't do nothing without him but you know why because she doesn't do anything without him more and more because he's possessing her life the seed of God that's inside of her is coming to such a place my brothers and sisters in this hour that is taking control of her Is possessing her we're in such an hour that we're living in look at the word that's coming forth look at the the maturity of the word that's coming forth that is being spoken it's showing something it's showing me personally me where I'm at in my walk where I'm at on my maturity with Christ it should be showing you the same thing now I'm not going to sit here say if it's not showing you the same thing if you don't feel this you feel that come to the Altar and pray and all that stuff that's a day gone past that's not in this day and hour this out this hour listen this hour is where where the bride the seeds of God are coming into maturity and all the other seeds they're coming into their position in place too everything is coming into their place in their position I'm not going to here to convince you oh you're gonna you need the Holy Ghost come up here and we'll pray for you and you'll get the Holy Ghost come and sit in the altar come fast and pray for hours and days read your Bible come to church every service and you'll get the Holy Ghost that's not the hour we're living in anymore that's not the hour my brothers and sisters that's not going to do it in this hour what good would it do if there's no Dynamics in it no matter how much the mechanics prove to be right there got to be Dynamics to make it work that's what Easter proved he was not only the word but he was God himself the Dynamics in the word I am he that was dead so dead to the son said he was dead the moon said he was dead the Stars said he was dead all nature said he was dead and now the whole world's got to recognize that he is alive again and it can only be the manifestation of the Fulfillment of all the revelations any other has spoken of the Bride of Jesus Christ that's what's going to happen in this day and age just like they have to recognize that he was dead they had to recognize that he was alive they're going to have to recognize the Bride of Jesus Christ in this hour the world's going to recognize the Masters is going to recognize that it's because it's him that is living it's not her it's him and her that's going to manifest is the same scriptures going to be fulfilled again in her we've heard the quotes over and over again I can quote and quote and quote the son of man being revealed in Bride form oh my brothers it's all sounds good all the Mysteries you can have all Faith to move mountains it's not about faith faith doesn't save you it's not about knowing all the Mysteries as predestination is is God putting a seed a allotted word we call it a seed of God an attribute of God because the word of God is a seed inside of you and not coming to life and revealing to you as an individual saves you you're not saved on some day you're not saved on some year you're not saved on some preacher that came and preached a dynamic Revival or you came to the altar you're eternal you were there before the foundation of the world you're Eternal as much as God is eternal but Faith Comes as a tool it opens up your Enlightenment it opens up the door it breaks the spiritual Amnesia upon your life to make you recognize that you are a son and daughter of God and it constantly being revealed to you and being revealed to you that you are over and over again it can only manifest it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone and life of his life and power of his power she is him until you come to that place of perfect faith wow you will you will you hear you hear preaching like this you hear quotes like this and you think in your mind you know your mind starts playing tricks on you until I come to that place no you know when I hear that when I hear the preaching like that being brought forth like that I say to myself the seed of God inside of me will come to that place I believe it I accept it I know it's being revealed to me and it's going to manifest you can't do nothing you can't how can how can we or or anybody bring forth this life it's his life he brings it forth amen Faith can't save anybody faith is a tool that opens up your understandings to see that you're predestinated and the place inside of you which saves you Faith opens the door for you to recognize that and it breaks the spiritual Amnesia on your life and you recognize that you see James 2 14 what do it profit my brethren though a man say he has faith and have not works can Faith save him even so if a man had not works is dead being alone yea a man say that thou have faith and I have Works show me thy faith without thy works and I will show you my faith by my works thou believe is that there is one God thou doest well but the Devils also believe in tremble and what he's saying in there you know I believe God I believe the message I believe God sent a prophet so does the devil the devil believes all that everything that most people in this message are believing amen and being religious right without this life the Devils believe even more yeah yeah people people all God said a prophet God said a prophet ten years later they walk away I don't know if this Prophet is real I I don't know if what he's saying is right not stuff let me tell you no matter what you say about any minister of God that's a true minister of God let me tell you the devil believes the devil knows more than most people know oh yeah he knows he knows what's real he knows what's life he I'm no match for him none of you are a match for him not one of us but I know he's no match for him my Lord and Savior oh that's what I trust in that's what I believe in and when you come to that place and the confidence in your life and in your walk and you know that you know that he's inside of you you know that he's there Hallelujah you see faith is the starting point it beckons us to move in obedience and obedience always requires action on our part the word tells us that it's impossible to please God without faith pleasing God happens when we have faith and apply it with action our walk of faith is a lifelong journey and there are two things that I know about it without a shadow of a doubt the first thing is no one else can run our personal race of faith no one it's you and you and God Alone you are an individual you got to know for yourself where you stand and who you are the second is truly walking by faith is not by sight it produces Eternal fruit of all which pleases God and brings his glory yes walking by faith is not walking by sight is not walking by works walking by faith is believing what he said like Abraham believe him look at we we we read about Abraham so much and Abraham's seed but look at Abraham's life we need to go back sometimes and draw faith and Power how Abraham believed the promises now our our promise is that Abraham that God spoke to Abraham in his day is not for us today amen right so we are looking at different promises that God is going to do God is going to change our body God is going to Rapture in all the world and even your flesh is against that truth it fights and batters against the truth amen this world is gross Darkness everything every image in this world is not the image of God the image of God is only in one place in this hour on this Earth and that's in the Bride of Jesus Christ and she doesn't believe in any other image but his image only his image that she believes in in this hour that's what Abraham walked by everything that came against him having a baby look at their age impossible scientifically everything that was against him but what did God do what did God do when his body deteriorated when the the everything around him deteriorated the promise looked like it was going to come to pass what did God do God changed their bodies like somebody told me I was talking to a a Muslim guy I known him for a while and we are going back and forth and back and forth and then he comes to me and says God cannot become a man and I looked I looked and I said I said who are you who is any man The God Who created the heavens and the Earth and everything that there is in that you believe that that God is Supernatural and God created the universe and everything who are you to save that God cannot become a man who are we to save who is Abraham Abraham's Faith did not stagger Abraham's Faith was perfect because you know why it was revealed to Abraham that's when Faith becomes perfect and that's the problem in this hour it's got to be revealed to you it's got to be revealed to you and made known unto you and then perfect faith comes and then confidence comes then you're walking in the power of the spirit of God then you know you can overcome then you know you're Victorious when is revealed to you until it's reveal to you you cannot walk in there I know that for myself I I make challenges all the time every time every time I overcome something there's another challenge and I know that's going to be right to the day I leave here one challenge after another don't think you're ever gonna arise you're never gonna arrive unless you arrive to the rapture the event of the Rapture that's the only thing you're going to ride to but until then from then to now is just one challenge after another and the same fate that came to you that cause you to walk is the same faith that he promised that he will give you and reveal to you every challenge that you come against it he will not fail he will not fail you oh my Hallelujah amen everything that you ask for you shall receive it if you believe it with all your heart now I'm going to ask you how can you believe it with all your heart you can't believe it with all your heart unless it's revealed to you it's got to be revealed to you I'm going to ask you upon the basis of the shed blood upon the basis knowing that you are a Christian and the promise is true if Jesus Promised life after death went forth into death and come back with life to prove it and give you life of the spirit in you and his presence here now how can it fail how can these things fail oh my oh my how many people are still under the fear of death death where Paul said death where is your sting see his faith came to a place with God right that God revealed to him that's why he could say death where is your sting grave where is your victory oh my what a revelation he had what an understanding he had that death had no power over him death has no power of you tonight if you're born again and the spirit of God lives inside of you that is gone from you death can never touch you you already died [Music] I know they're just they're just words but when they come alive in your walk in your faith in your confidence that you can walk we need this my brothers and sisters because there are challenges that we are facing now today and there's challenges that are coming upon us on this Earth that Mark of the Beast system that new world order that by I can't buy or sell all these things are coming into effect and God is building our faith to meet the challenges supernaturally to separate us into another dimension our faith into another dimension that we might have to speak things into existence we I don't know what's going to happen but I know the supernatural God can be present it's got to be present to beat and meet the challenges of that Beast system in its full power until we leave here until we leave here hey I'm telling you Manny you think people fell when Corvette hit many are going to fall that don't have their life you can't come and get this oil I just I just heard from the brothers I think brother Desmond or brother Philip were saying Down in Africa or somebody was saying that uh brother brother Christopher Christopher said that his brother went over and uh Revival broke out and there's like 10 or 15 churches Pentecostal churches that come to the message let me tell you my brothers and sisters we're not here long and this thing has been growing you can't come and get this oil you know that that is that is spoken already by the prophet that when you see those things happening and those things come into pass look up your faith is being completed your Redemption is being completed at that time when the Pentecostals start coming for this oil they're not going to get it look at the 10 fluids virgins people in this message that don't have the oil right now they're not going to get it that's the hour we're living in it oh my God oh my God hey man let's move on here Hallelujah have faith in what the word says you are and Jesus had faith in the word of God what he was It Was Written of me then David and the Psalms and the prophets all spoke of him I am the bread of life that cometh down out of God out of Heaven I am the Tree of Life from the Garden of Eden I'm all these things I am that I am and he knew with a perfect faith that he was the anointed Messiah that the spirit of God was upon him he said now I in myself do nothing but it's my faith in God and God was in him the word made manifest and when the word of God see he's leading up to something it always leads up to something when we speak about Jesus or the prophet it always leads to something in this hour and where does it lead to to the bride that's where it leads to and when the word of God comes in you it makes manifest who you are as a believer and a Believer is the faith of God that moves inside of you when it's revealed to you then it becomes perfect faith oh my you know I'm I I can imagine Abraham every time Abraham it was challenged Satan challenged him I can see him God said so God promised I'm going to have a child I don't care about anything and when I look at the word of God and I see what has been spoken what has been spoken about the bride what has been prophesied about the bride I look at has been spoken about me and prophesied about me I don't care about myself I know I'm no good at myself I know I couldn't my brother says uh take my bootstraps and go anywheres without God it's been God from the beginning that spoke to me when I came in 31 years ago was gone today it's gone tomorrow it's gone it's always going to be God [Music] so when I see what's been spoken there's a witness of the Holy Ghost of the life of God inside of me that says amen amen and then when God quickens the word in the time and season in my life my personal life and speaks that word amen then I know life is going to come forth change is going to come forth and it's happening brother Brown's seen himself walking and he was walking and then all of a sudden he looked around and he looked at his wife and he was and he said he's seen the bride in a vision walking walking walking walking straight up my brothers and sisters there's a transformation taking place there's elements I don't know the scientific uh breakdown of all of it I don't have enough education for that but the elements in our bodies amen the cells in our bodies right now are changing amen they're vibrating faster and faster and faster as the word of God is coming forth in the spirit of God is opening up and revealing and revealing and bringing it to pass in our lives our bodies are being changed Moment by moment we don't even have to think about how how I'm going to be different how I'm going to change oh I want to be different oh I want to change oh I don't want to do this anymore I don't want to do that anymore we don't think about that anymore it just happens it happens when you walk every day in your life and it's a transformation is just taking place inside of you it's just taking place and all that goal is just move and apply to your life and change in you the glory and Glory oh my I believe that I believe that oh yes there's gonna be there's going to be the word of God being spoken in this message I'm telling you my real Ministers of God that are catching the revelation of this hour of the Rapture that are going to be called crazy in fanatics what are you preaching what is that what if brother you see those traps set in there it's always been that way that's why Jesus spoke in Parables that's why the word was written The Way It Was Written because it's only revealed to the ones that are chosen it's giving you to know the mysteries of God to the other ones it's not given to no and there's things written in this in the message in these quotes right that is allotted for the Bride of Jesus Christ in this hour to speak is not written in word it's the unwritten word behind the quotes of the eye in the word we see how can she write how can she just when she comes into that life of God how can you write the life of God the life of God Lives the life of God's speech the life of God moves in the moment that it moves every day of Our Lives okay [Music] oh my God that's the life of God oh my thank you Lord I got 20 minutes you know me I go right to my time I'm not cutting it short Hallelujah what can you expect from perfect faith you can expect progress in holiness you can expect growing stability to your mind and emotions you can expect the god-given ability to handle tragedies disappointments of life you can expect to finish your race well and dying out to self and growing in your love for Jesus longing to be with him you can expect perfect Faith bring in perfect realization and your position in him you can expect perfect Faith to master all circumstances and situations and to overcome everything that comes your way that's what perfect Faith is doing in this hour oh my she's Victorious she's not going to leave defeated she's going to leave Victorious and overcomer oh my God I don't even look at the things that in my life how am I going to overcome this how am I over I'm not going to worry about that it's not for me to say how am I going to overcome it he's already overcame it he will overcome it I say Lord come on the scene come on the scene and overcome in my life oh my that's what it's all about bringing him on the scene calling Jesus on the scene oh my sometimes you gotta shake yourself you gotta wake them up this world the darkness and the carnality and the images sometimes put you in a little bit to sleep you gotta shake yourself constantly Move Yourself constantly oh my God oh my God Amen he is perfect everything it's him in us becoming perfect just let go and let his life live through us and that is Us in this hour now you can understand when Jesus said be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect I believe it you know what Saints I'm perfect I'm perfect just like my heavenly father's perfect because the perfect one the perfect everything is him that's living every every credit to my life spiritually speaking everything that I've overcome everything that I've changed in my life is credit to him the perfect one and he's going to make everything perfect not according to my interpretation that's a big thing with the human mind interpreting God we don't interpret God God is his own interpreter he will make it plain he will bring the word to pass he will show himself who he said he is and who he will be in your life amen Hallelujah I'm going to move right on here brother Brown is speaking in here quick and Empower lets us see his coming coming quickening power snatches us from death to life quickening power gives us discernment you know people look at the sermon right listen if you don't got discernment in this hour you're finished and I'm not talking about people you know they look at brother bradner's discernment does not kind of discernment no no no no this word discerns a very thoughts and the intenses of the heart even your own heart not anybody else's your own heart and it it discerns your motives your intentions how many times we quiet the spirit of God within us when he's speaking the voice of God in us when he's speaking when he's Discerning your very thoughts and your attentions of your hearts and your motives when he's speaking to you that happens to me when I go like like our Pastor said many times when when uh when you go to bed at night and you start praying you've done something wrong and not in the day or said something wrong it comes up it comes up oh yes I know I experienced that all the time that's the only way in the spirit I know I have a clear conscience and I'm right with God and I'm right with everybody else is because the spirit of God reveals and how many times the spirit of God even the Bible says it if you have ought against your brother or your sister go to them what are you keeping that inside of there I don't even know why I'm getting on this why are you keeping that inside of you that is hinder in the spirit of progress inside of you hindering the holy ghost from doing the things he wants to do inside of you you got to let that go you got to confess that that's that's our job if there's a job that we have to do is that is that is confess our sins one to another let the blood of Jesus may wash us and cleanse us amen and what it should have done and what it will will be the Lord Jesus Christ is so full of quickening power he said destroy this body and I'll raise it up in three days talk about confidence and quickening power it was the prophecy of the word of God and the prophecy if it's true word of God cannot fail and the same prophecy and the word of God that said it'll raise him up says that we are already raised with him no wonder he said fear not fear not the greatest tool that Satan uses still upon people's lives here fear but God is trying to reveal to us over and over by by what he's speaking here I conquer death Hell In The Grave I rose again I conquer death fear nothing fear nothing in your life hallelujah oh my my fear nothing oh you the flesh oh the flesh I I got nervous before I stepped up here every time I step up here I get nervous the flesh will do that I don't care what do you care about the flesh the spirit of God the life and God the life of God inside of you has raising so much up above the flesh you don't walk by the flesh you don't walk by your car the mind as the scripture says you walk in the spirit you walk in faith you walk in Revelation in Revelation there's no fear there's no Darkness it's all light just walk in the light as he is in the light keep walking in the light my brothers and sisters is a separation time there's another level that is going to it's going to another level it keeps going up to the levels and levels and levels this word of God with inside of us separating us bringing us to the place now you see right here when he's talking here talking about confidence and the quickening power my brothers and sisters the challenge is that Jesus had to meet in the Garden of Gethsemane the challenges that he had to meet going to the cross the challenges is that he had to meet going into hell and taking the keys of death hell in the grave and rising up again is the challenges that he was saying right there that we the bride he wants to put that Faith inside of us in this hour the get us prepared and ready for what's coming upon the Earth so that we can move and operate in the same power the same confidence that he operated in do I have all the words do I have all the understanding of what I'm saying right now no because he's breaking it he's unfolding it but I know there's a time that's coming very soon very soon that these quotes are not going to be quotes anymore they're going to be a living manifestation of individuals walking on this Earth producing it they don't have to talk it the preaching is going to be done one day to you the preaching is is actually getting to a place where it is starting to wind up now because Sons and Daughters of God know who they are I'm not saying that you don't need preaching and stuff like that I'm saying something different here that you need to catch by the spirit amen Hallelujah let us wind this down now amen that true Easter seal on that Sunrise broke the secret of life and death was revealed before that time we didn't know the world were grouped in darkness groped around man's suspicious theories amongst man's hearts and traditions made up man worshiped Idols they worshiped the son they worshiped all kinds of gods and all kinds of people made claims and they went into the grave and they stayed in the grave but the real seal had been broken and once and one who once lived as we lived and died as we died was risen from the dead and the Seeker was made known that he was both resurrection and life and he said when he came forth on that morning he said because I live you live also that life that was living in him is now in US no different life it's the same life that's what he's saying there because I live because I overcame I conquered you live you do the same things Hallelujah amen that's the way it is to all believers they are Mystic the people don't understand because they live in a world to themselves that's why you can't live there's no there's no that we're individuals we can't live uh you know uh groups this ain't no groups this ain't no uh bunch of people this is individuals God deals with us as individuals right we walk with God Alone with God you my wife don't walk with god with me alone no I walk with God Alone She Walks With God alone you walk with God Alone your wife or your or or or your husband might have great faith what about you where do you stand Hallelujah Jesus lived in the world that nobody else could touch so it is when a man lives by faith and walks by faith I mean substance Faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ there's now you're getting into bride material you see you're getting into Rapture condition mean now that's each one of us not just the pastors the deacons the trustees but the laity every individual walks in in a world with God alone you are baptized into his kingdom and there nobody's in there but you and God see he says he says it a lot if you notice if you read the message see see do you see he constantly says it see and then he says c c he wants you to see he gives the orders what is perfect Faith he gives the orders you pack them out whatever he says there's not a Shadow of Doubt nowhere you walk right on if the Lord says this there's nobody in the world that can talk you out of it you go right on just the same you see what perfect faith is now you're coming into perfect Faith perfect Perfection that cannot fail brother Brown says that faith never fails yes he was a Mystic to the world with his perfect faith and so it is now with those who have perfect Faith are a Mystic to others so now he's saying so it is now it's here now the bride perfect faith is here now that's what the seed has awaken up to in this hour is that perfect faith and only that perfect faith can produce a raptured in this day in this hour amen they want a Great Awakening I'll wind it down the musicians can come they want a Great Awakening their crying believing that there will be an Awakening well brother Brown is speaking back here recognizing your day and his message and you know he's talking back there but like I said the quotes are prophecies and you need to find the right quote quotes for the Prophecies of this day and age and this God struck my heart and revealed this to me and showed me that this prophecy this quote is being fulfilled today in the message that's what's happening with the confusion that's what's happening with all the false things that are going on all the Cults and Clans that are raising up everything that is is puzzling the people not the bride the bride was always based on his word and him she's not deceived by these things they are crying believing that there will be a Great Awakening sure they are look at the message look at the quotes look what look at the prophet said about the bride look what look what he said about her overcoming and becoming what some of the things we said here tonight of course they're believing all that they're good people they're not evil people they're not bad people they're good people they have not recognized The Awakening of the Bride by being a Christian they feel the pull of the hour oh there's a pull in this hour oh the pool is getting stronger and stronger as God is revealing to his bride more and more that pull is taken over the atmospheres oh yeah and it's become in her atmosphere that's what that's what is his life that she can that the people are going to see in this message that they can't deny because when she speaks it's going to come to pass and the atmosphere that's around her look remember brother Brian was the first wave sheep when he walked into a room the presence of God was so much around him the atmosphere of God was so much around it changed things oh my my brothers and sisters don't look at yourself right now I don't look at myself right now but I look at to the word of God and I see what's coming I see what God is doing inside of me and let me tell you don't put a time limit on God what he can do in your life God can Quicken things and Quicken things so much the word that's been planted and you've been feeding off it for years all it takes is one moment for God to Quicken us oh yeah that's why we don't put an interpretation on nothing of his word we believe it we accept it and that's it because he's going to bring it to pass when he's going to bring it to the Past in his time in his season now listen but they haven't recognized what's been done oh my something has been done brother Tim tell me what's been done something has been done I can't tell you I can't tell you not even even the messages that we preach and how clear we we hear the word of God so so clear and mature from from our pastor for many many years amen but even that cannot show you what's been done only the spirit of God can show you what's been done how many people been feeding off this word for many many many years how many people pass through even this ministry and gone and I look into my heart and we and I say how can it be like Peter says where can I go Lord you got the words of life it's not a word of a man I don't follow a man what's words of life it's Jesus in our camp it's Jesus in our midst it's him what's been done that's what's making them feel that way they know something is supposed to happen but they see they're looking for it way off in the future to come oh no tonight is happening it's happening tonight every day is happening in The Bride of Jesus Christ when it's already happened right by you recognizing your Danish message in Jehovah Jireh last quote here the bride is done chosen it's getting her ready now the Revival is over there is no more Revival spirit think about it is only a word Revival that's happening in the individual bride of Jesus Christ that's all everything else is dead even in the message if you're not under this word Revival is coming and manifesting is dead people are getting quoted to death educated to death dead seeds knowledge all these things there's no more Spirit Revival two hours of service everybody's complaining and so we are just gleaning in the field and Abraham just had to sweat it out until he found character and when he found character the next thing was prepare her to meet the vibe groom you remember when he found her it was in the evening time the evening light but the spiritual Royal Seed of Abraham which believes every word of God there is a confirmation of a living resurrect Jesus Christ in them that's the other oh I believe the message I believe those who believe every word of God there's a confirmation in them of the living resurrected Jesus Christ that is the difference that is going to be displayed in this hour between the believer and the make-believer and the unbeliever halleluia the church goes through the tribulation period let me tell you the message goes through the tribulation period but the bride not her she is redeemed she doesn't have to be purified she's already pure the Holy Spirit has come into her and purified her and took all the filthy of the world and she believes that word and becomes a part of it it's the bride that comes out of the Church of the message it's the bride and the spirit in this last day that says come amen oh it's the bride in the spirit that says come in these last days let us stand the Great Awakening of that seed it's a perfect faith in this hour [Music] oh my God father we thank you Lord [Music] foreign what can we say father but thank you Here We Are Tonight Lord Jesus believe in [Music] on the first time you spoke into our hearts and you spoke bright [Music] we had we found it hard to believe at that time lord and we kept wandering over the years am I really this that that is spoken by the prophet am I really this but you constantly came as that seed was Awakening and growing and being watered and in the sunlight in good soil with a good heart that you gave us Lord and you constantly came over and over and over and over all the things that were done in our lives all the signs wonders all the great things that you confirm to us was not to make us proud or Pride or make us feel that we're better than anybody else but it's just to show you to show us Lord that you were showing us that we are what you said we are yes we are the Bride of Jesus Christ in this hour [Music] oh Lord [Music] I can understand how in the in the day when you walk this Earth when the Pharisees and Sadducees came up and you had to you had to change from the first pull to the second Pole where everybody loved you Lord just like in this hour with our Prophet but when the third poll came that third pull was perfect faith that was the purpose of God that was predestinated before the foundation of the world that was the position that that you were called to manifest on this Earth and you were called to come here to die to raise again but you you were called to proclaim the kingdom the kingdom of God has come within men you are called to say I and my father are one and the same and I believe Lord that the bride is coming into that faith that perfect Faith where she can say in this hour and speak that I and the father are one in the same [Music] Jesus Christ has come in flesh again and is manifested oh God you have prepared her all these years and you have placed and taken everything that you need to take out of our Lord so that she can walk with this word and Proclaim this word that it will just be you Jesus you said I do nothing unless the father shows me you proclaimed all the time you didn't take any glory for yourself but you were showing us that when you come in US the same things will manifest again Lord my words are my words Lord but your words are Eternal they are the seed of God let them go forth tonight Lord and produce what you have spoken for it to produce in each and every one of our Lives Lord every seed will bring forth of its own kind and this is the hour where every seed is coming into full manifestation Grant these things Lord and continue to bless us as we walk in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you Saints slime foreign [Music] to glories [Music] foreign J easy did me from Earth lead things it's like
