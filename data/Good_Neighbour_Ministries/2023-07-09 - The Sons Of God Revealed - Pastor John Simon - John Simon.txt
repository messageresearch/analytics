blessed um to be with the young men's fellowship they are initiating it it's gotten started and now they're doing their planning of what they're going to do for the uh years ahead year and years ahead uh they're doing all of that and that's taking place and we thank the Lord for that so some of the young ministers be prepared because they're talking about from time to time inviting different ones to come in and to uh talk with them and to give them you know various words of God that God would want you to give amen so we look forward to that we look forward to starting I'm glad Sister Hazel is here because I want to start a seniors Club and I want to be a member of that I want to be a member of the seniors Club if they will let me in but you know I thank God at least we can meet once in a while you know have a tea or coffee or something and talk about you know you know just talk about things and open the Bible talk a little bit about that too but it's mainly the fellowship the friendship and the the unity that it brings to the people of God and the house of God Amen praise the Lord uh we also have in mind uh which is I believe is now in progress uh uh young women's Fellowship being uh formed or is being formed so that the young women can come together uh from time to time and they can be built up now um I know um in the beginning a lot of the uh sisters here will remember I spoke on um fascinating Womanhood a long series on how to become a fascinating woman and so if if the young women are still interested in being fascinating um you know as the Lord will lead it's up to them that may be old-fashioned but I'll do my best by the grace of God hallelujah but glad to see you we welcome you all Beverly welcome you Roseanne we're happy to have you all uh praise God God bless every one of you we remember let's remember all our Brethren who are not here today you know this is vacation time and they're scattered everywhere Trinidad here there Africa

back safely right uh very important that we do that let's pray in one for another that fervently all our needs will be met and if we're sick that we would be healed amen God bless you very much well today we would like to take for a a topic here Romans 8 19 first are scripture Romans 8 verse 19 one verse and of course you will read the surrounding scripture around that to give you more of a con context but Romans 8 19 which is on the screen in front of you if you have no Bible or if you have a Bible but you prefer to read it up there it says here for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God I read again for the earnest expectation of the creature weighted for the manifestation of the sons of God Amen and we want to take for a topic the sons of God being revealed praise the Lord hallelujah let us pray a gracious Heavenly Father we thank you on this wonderful day summer's day to be here in the house of God helpless as we are as human beings mortal as we are that will soon pass away oh God yet in the brief period of time we have here on Earth we come into your presence to acknowledge you to worship you to glorify and magnify your great name and more than that to offer ourselves not as dead sacrifices but as living people living sacrifices that will sacrifice or or Earthly things and all that Lord and lay ourselves upon thy altar to make ourselves channels of Grace that the spirit of Christ the word of God the power of the holy spirit will be able to flow through us and Bless the people Lord sending forth streams of Living Waters that will a water day the the the seeds of life that were out there placed out there Lord it might come to life and bring Glory To Your Great Name we ask it in the name of Jesus Amen and amen God bless every one of you uh please be seated where you are we'll speak for for a brief while here I Believe by the grace of God hallelujah you're used to me I always say it's a brief while but I myself don't know where it's going fully really praise the Lord now we read a scripture there which says the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God now when it says it waits for the manifestation of the sons of God I want to read you some other translations and I want to let you know that this is what caused me to uh not that I didn't know this but to put it in these words right uh that I thought I'd bring this to you here are some translations and this is off the page of a a book that brother Perry green had given to me um and I you know I picked it up and now it's of use praise the Lord actually and because it's a Bible it's a special Bible I don't think they're made again but it has about 20 different translations every top every verse you come to is give you about 20 different translations of that verse so are you ready for this are you really ready for this amen listen for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God for the eager Outlook of all creation are ardently waiting for the revealing of who are the sons of God another one for the longing of creation looks eagerly for that time when the glory of the sons of God shall be revealed here's another way much translation all creation is yearning longing to see the manifestation of the sons of God for the creation Waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God now let me read from the Amplified version for creation is waiting expectantly for God's Sons to me made known to them see waiting for the revealing of those Sons and for the disclosing of their sonship the whole creation Now Philips translation is now on tiptoes waiting to see the wonderful sight of these sons of God coming into their own o praise God I'm gonna just stop there but those are some translation that gives you a broad idea of what we're about to talk we are talking about right now by the grace of God now the creation we're reading the Bible says the manifestation of the sons of God but we understand these translators are showing you it's not just a a manifestation but a revelation the word revelation tells you that something was hidden something had to be healed before it can be revealed something had to be a mystery before it can be revealed I'm sure you know what a secret is and a secret is something that's hidden until it's actually spoken about or made known to others that they will know what it is that you held a secret and human beings are like that if two people are over there and they're talking and then you notice they'll lower their voice and they're talking right away you're wondering I wonder what they're talking about well this is what the Bible is telling us the whole creation is waiting with expectation to find out what it is that that God had hid all of all over all these ages Amen in so much that Paul said that there were things that God hid that even the angels desired to look into but they were not allowed to look into they were not allowed to see amen they weren't allowed to know the secret of redemption The Mystery of the church ages there were labeled by God's grace to look into the mystery of the dispensations and the sense conscience and so on Down the Line there were not able God did not allow them to see the extremity of his plans because he didn't want to expose or disclose to the devil right that's the reason why when John God begins to reveal at the end now God is revealing to John what it is a outline of what he had planned and God not wanting that to come to the devil said John I'm telling you when John was up he said but don't write don't write this part you're allowed to write the other parts they can have scripture that they can read that they can go you know they can know some of my plans but at this part when it gets to this part don't you write that down that part is not to be Unwritten so we're not talking here today to you off of just comparing scripture but we are bringing to you by the supernatural enablement of the Holy Spirit the unwritten word of God Hallelujah not different from what's in here but the unwritten word so that your spirit amen will be able to pick up if you have the spiritual equipment the unwritten word that God has placed out there now for the True Believers to be able to receive it amen amen yes sir now that mystery we find in if you will turn in your bibles if you have them I believe it's Colossians 1 25 to 26 or if it can be put up on the screen where we can all see it you understand that God is talking about this mystery and now we understand well wherefore I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God for the mystery which had been hid from ages it hit from all them Church ages hit from ages not for ages that is a fact it's hidden for our ages but even from the church ages he's saying is I mean him from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to his sense not to the whole world but to the True Believer to the elect it's made manifest it's being made known that the True Believer will recognize the word of the Living God hallelujah amen now we understand that uh God asked Joe he says job where were you when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy where were your job see God was trying to jog job's spiritual memory he's telling him job you're not just here on the earth for 70 years or 20 years that you're living but you were there back there with them Sons back there but can you remember where were you when you were among those Sons can you can that memory come back to you now we understand therefore what that tells me that the sons of God are that mystery the sons of God the bride of Christ the elected of God the the attributes of God the the seeds of Grace that they are the ones that were um let you conceive a thought every one of us from time to time will conceive a thought in our minds God our Father our mother or everything God conceived of us in his thoughts so we were hid in the mind of God we were hid in the thoughts of God away from everything else because remember God he was he is Elohim which is the self-existent one which means there he says in Isaiah there is none beside me there's none before me none after me nobody else I am the only one thank God we believe in one God we believe his name is come on we believe his name is Jesus Christ Hallelujah for there are many jesuses in Mexico and in the Spanish countries but there's only one Jesus Christ we believe is God in the father God and the son God in the Holy Ghost God the only one I am the Lord amen hallelujah yes only one God and we serve him with all our hearts we give glory to God so the sons of God were hid in the mind of God and God was turning to one of his sons and saying can you remember when you were way back there can you remember but he couldn't because now he was born in sin shaped iniquity and the shock of sin had thrown the whole human race into confusion where we can't even recall or remind remember who we really are we think ourselves just as a as Mortals that just come on the earth for a span of time and then we just go off and take a step in the dark and we are no more but the God is trying to tell us from the word here that uh we are not so because now the human race is we know it's not uh completely the way God wanted it to be it would have been only God's people but the devil came in and sowed his seed and therefore it becomes uh mixed up we don't know who is who you know sentences will come to church too you say what you mean Satan's come to church no the Bible tells us there's many scriptures that say and the sons of God came together in the presence of God and Satan was there amongst them and he came up and even asked God do you want me to go down and lie in the mouth of this person do you want me to go and go and and get that King over there stir him up for war or something uh he he has to ask God's permission amen right but yet he tries to make us think that he's in power and he can do whatever he wants but he can't he can't touch you as a Believer he can't do anything to you as the daughter of God he can't do anything to you as a Son of God unless God permits it you remember when David the king of Israel was coming in and mephibosheth took mud and was throwing it at David and pelting him with more than everything else like that and uh the soldier took his sword to cut off that man's head David said no he couldn't even Pelt a piece of mud at me unless Jehovah permitted it and if Jehovah permit him to Pelt that mud he must have a reason why and I won't have nothing to do with it I wouldn't touch it right you see because God wasn't watching at the man felt in the mud God was watching at David's reaction and God is not watching at the people harassing you haranguing you cursing you swearing at you or coming against you reproaching you for the word and calling you names or you're trying to block your way step in front of you drive that car deliberately to block you off or anything like that no God isn't watching that God is watching at your reaction or are you going to react in the spirit of Christ are you going to react like a devil in other words you'll pull out your sword you pull out your red shield pull out the hammer from your scar trunk and come out of there not God God is watching your reaction amen is that right I mean like you don't get into those kinds because there's some individuals can be really getting your nerves and really aggravate you I mean I know I do you sometimes and you feel like maybe give me a punch in the mouth but uh still thank God that Lord has helped you that you you have never done that yet but you see I've got to tell you things you don't want the hair or you don't like hearing and that's what I have to do from the word of God Amen I got to preach the word to you amen amen hallelujah do you want to work do you want the word or do you want biscuits you know you can have biscuits you know denominational biscuits you know nice graham crackers or something like that or or you can have soup made from you know the shadow of a skinny chicken so and you can drink that soup and see how it's going to strengthen you but that's not what we are here for amen we are here for the word of God we are here to receive God's word hallelujah so we're finding that God being our spiritual father mother we were hid in him before the foundation of the world in other words true sons and dust of God don't get uh saved here uh the lamb was already slain before the foundation of the world they're not saved here 19th of so-and-so date this year I come to the Lord no no sons and dust of God ours Eternal as God is eternal so what are you talking about well you know goats bring forth goats sheep and Fort sheep Horseman fourth horse and God brings forth ah then Jesus say if you are a son of God he says you know he says you know sons of God you are sons of God Amen Hallelujah did not the scripture call us sons of God Amen so your sons you're not even servants of God you serve God because as Sons you want to serve God but then there's the classes in the book of Redemption where you have servants you have guards and so on that are going to be there but thanks be to God we are sons of God he said Jesus said he said the servant you put him out whenever you want you fire him but the son he he abides in the house forever Hallelujah sons and thus of God are in the house of God forever praise the Lord why by blood relations by Blood connections we are connected to the Lord by the connection of his blood and the blood of God is Not blood that we know here but the God's blood is Spirit blood the Holy Spirit the token is the blood of God that lives in US praise God so we made a Life by the spirit of God flowing through our lives our lives are cleaned and purged by the presence of the holy spirit being in our lives our lives are empowered and given spiritual health and matured by the spirit of God living in us hallelujah greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world so we were hidden God and we were hit there before the foundation of the world and therefore you are regarded as the mystery or the mystery of God this thought the devil was trying to get at but couldn't find out what it was but we were the sons of God in the mind of God and we were conceived there in the mind of God now let me bring it to me to you on a literal level now every one of us sitting here was hidden in our mother's womb before we came to a manifestation before we become revealed and then your features can be seen your face your uh and as you mature then your nature begins to show your own personal character begins to disclose itself you don't have to do anything it just starts to disclose itself it starts to make itself known but you are HID in God you were hid in your bomb until you go through a certain period of time and then you come to a place where you are formed and shaped and then it brings you to a manifestation you are born Hallelujah from your mom now in the same manner I'm pulling the same thought down so were we God knowing that the world is mixed and it's filled with the Serpent's Seed as well as the seed of God for Satan Cain's generation spread around the whole world as well as Abel's generation through Noah and Abraham and all of them also spread around the world of God War the world and they're mixed in together as humans and no not this one from that one or the other one we don't know but it's what is in the individual that makes the difference what's in there because God's Sons and Daughters he planted in them this is the parable where he said a certain man went forth to soul and he sowed seeds and some fell here and some fell there you know they fell everywhere it was God telling you what he did planting his sons and daughters now that's let me come to that word when it says Sons because in actual fact uh this of course you will think it's controversial but there are no female angels there's nothing like a female angel and that is why Jesus said there is no male and female in heaven with God there is no male and female do you agree with that all right because when you don't say amen I think oh no what is he saying there but Jesus himself said there is no male and female in heaven and when it says Sons it's really children offsprings of the Almighty okay that's what he's talking about so even if I use the term Sons I want you to understand what I am talking about I'm not talking about just men I'm talking about all of you that are here that are believers amen I'm not talking about church members I'm not talking about make-believers I'm not talking about unbelievers I'm talking about true believers okay there is no male and female with God only those children that were in him in his talks conceived in his thoughts in his mind when they were sent down here upon the Earth then some were put in male bodies some in a female body you understand no humanly speaking there is a difference but on the inside there the spirit man the soul that's in there Jesus said there is no mail nor female in Christ praise the Lord now you got Brothers Be watchful how you take care of your wife and wife You Gotta Be watchful of how you take care of your husband right because you see uh sometimes you say oh um the women came out Eve came out from his side therefore she must be second class no he she came out from his side she didn't come out from under his feet so that he should step on her no now sisters I want you to know we are not here to step on you no sir because God didn't take you out of his feet right God didn't do that but he took you from his from his side as a symbol that uh she's a help meet she's to stand beside him there to walk together by the grace of God hallelujah that's the way it ought to be in a real marriage a real Union hallelujah praise God and I'm not talking about sexual relations I'm talking about the union of soul to soul mind to mind Spirit the spirit will meet Hallelujah and the two shall be one praise God and that where the other parts of our human uh relevance that that's just natural that's just human but the real part is a spiritual part where God unites them in one and Spirit one in mind one in thoughts oh praise God you ever notice in a real in a real marriage after a while sometimes the husband and wife find themselves almost saying the same things at the same time because their Union starts growing spiritually to the point where almost almost knowing what the other person is thinking without them even talking it starts getting like that but that's not my subject today I don't know how I got after that maybe somebody here needed that but but praise the Lord but the point is that I'm making that we were hidden God we were ahead in our moms and then God turns around and allow those sons and that is God to be hid in the church world in the church womb the church and I'm talking about the worldwide church here hidden the womb of the church everybody is a member everybody can run to the Altar and cry as they wipe off the mascara and everything else and say I'm born again you know you see them on TV also I'm saved I'm saved I'm born again but Esau sought repentance with tears and he couldn't get it because the fact is not because you're human I'm showing you again sons of God Sons of Satan or people of Satan one is made to receive the word they have a connection to the word right he that happened ear to hear he Jesus tell you not everybody has an ear to hear the word of God everybody can hear preaching but not everybody can hear the unwritten word of God by revelation God reveals that to your spirit and there's a witness gospel to your spirit that you recognize that's him by that word making you know that he's talking to you you might be using me as a voice but he's talking to you that you will recognize yourself and your position in this word of God hallelujah amen so God hid his sons and daughters in the womb of the church world and but thank God he had a plan you weren't going to stay there forever and uh behind me you see of course the graphic which you can look at that whenever you wished her but God had the plan the true seven Church ages he would begin to unveil these Sons slowly little by little or you know using One messenger after the other a spoken of in Revelations chapter 1 to 3 you will find that he tells you about the messengers he would send to the church ages there will be the main speakers or voice that he will use to express himself to that particular Church age and so we know in our last day we believe you know the one that was used by God was brother William Marion Branham praise the Lord he has acknowledged that there are many others that were here on the earth and spoke for God but he had the office of the messenger of the seventh Church age to fulfill Malachi 4 5 Luke 17 31 many other scriptures Revelation 10 Revelation 10 7 amen when the Heavenly angel came down with the book of redemption opened up in his hands the seals were tore off the book and now he comes down with the book open and in the book was all the names of those sons of those children of God in the book amen and the Bible says he went to what the the Heavenly angel slowing down here a bit because my thoughts are starting to move the Heavenly angel came down with the open book he goes to the Earthly Angel which was already prophesied one would be on the earth in every Church age and came to comes to that Earthly angel and reveals to him what was in this book he starts revealing to him what was in this book he goes fought now and he began to sound the trumpet the king is coming a Herald of the king that's even in the Earthly Kings have that cleared away they move all the crowds out of the way the king's coming The Queen Is Coming Jesus is coming he's coming back again uh preachers began to shout it he's coming again like it or don't like it he's coming you don't want him to come he's still coming where do you where do you you're rejoicing or you're fearful of it he's still coming but I want you to know Jesus is coming and so begin to declare that he's coming and while he's coming when the son of man comes will he find fruit fruit on this tree again well on this tree that he's speaking of spiritually speaking the fruit will be sons and daughters that will be produced at that particular time under the ministry of of Revelation 10 7 and be produced and ripened and matured that he can come and have something to eat so we now want you to know that this is a great time and season that we are living in Hallelujah praise the Lord now we know that the scripture as we read it again for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God back there they were waiting they were waiting for for it to be made known who were these Sons who are these daughters who are these children where they're coming from I want to know who they are in the whole creation Waits and the reason why the whole creation is waiting expectantly is because you know all the animals all the trees everything else on the in the universe came under the effects and influence of sin we as human beings lost our instinct we don't even know the right foods to eat is that right we got to have people come and tell us what kind of food to eat just try to keep a bit healthy we lost our instincts we lost those sensitivities the animals they haven't lost that your dog is sick he knows what's grass to go and eat he knows which Leaf to go on it a rabbits and they all know they just go on they take it and they just go lay somewhere drink some water and next time you know they're up and about and they're they're on their way but we have lost all that and we've got to be protected from wild animals we've got to be protected from the Sun we've got to be protected from prickly stuff and all this stuff we're going to be doing that because we lost it amen whatsoever praise God but I want you to know brother sister the creature whole creation as this translator said they are on tiptoe they're just waiting for the sons and dusts of God to come back into their own position they have to come back into their own place of who to recognize who they really are that they're not just another church member but they are here amongst the church members recognizing who they are that they are Sons and Daughters of the Living God raised up by the power of the Holy Spirit amen glory to God hallelujah waiting expectantly who praise God so the text is trying to intimate to us that this is something going to be in the future so they were working back then they were waiting at the back then they were waiting as Paul as at the bottom of the Pyramid of Christianity growing upwards and is getting fewer and fewer as we go along until it comes to a peak field there will be will find it but now we find out France that right now A Paul and them were waiting for this manifestation of the sons of God but praise God we I want you to know this is the season this is the time we are not talking about prophecy we are in the prophecy you are part of the prophecy of this book you are walking in the living Prophecies of the word of God being made known in this hour hallelujah praise God Amen Hallelujah you say brother Simon when will this revelation of the sons of God take place it's taking place now that's second place right now praise God the revelation of the sons of God the unveiling of God Christ is the mystery of God now being revealed in his sons and daughters who are now being identified by his personal presence in their lives and making themselves known to the world about them and around them without them having to say one word because it's not my works of righteousness which you have done or can do you do that in gratitude and in grace to God because you love him you want to serve him but it doesn't make you Holier or more righteous because you're fasted more days or you you did this or you didn't eat that or you didn't drink this or you didn't drink the other no it is not based on that it's best on God's election it's based on God's choice of you in his mind from before the foundation of the world you are now accepting his choice but what you already chose and giving your life to him to love him and to serve him praise the name of the Lord go praise God so all creation has been waiting for the time which is now when the sons and dust of God we begin to recognize who they are and when they recognize they will start to have a what a uniting Time is that right right look when when it comes winter here in Canada what happens the first thing you notice all the geese start flocking together just start flocking together and you're hearing all these Canadian geese honking Hong Kong all around the place what what's going on they're getting ready to leave are you getting ready to leave I said are you getting ready to get it all price God but you're ready to leave praise the Lord oh my they're getting ready to leave praise God then one day you want to see them take to the skies they're gonna circle like that oh my and all of a sudden you only see one of those geese start heading down south amen and then you see them form a v like behind him as they're going down there together they're going down south praise the lord they're getting away from the cold Frosty air of denominational teaching and Creeds and traditions and all kinds of mixed ups and all kinds of money traps that they have and all kinds of membership traps and everything else oh they're heading away from all of that nonsense they're going out of there and when they're going over there they form a v they're declaring this is our Victory Day praise God and when we leave this place brother sister that's our Victory Day where and we head out to here by the grace of God oh praise God and I believe it won't be long I don't mean I don't know if it's gonna be tomorrow but I'm not telling you it's going to be tomorrow I don't have no date or anything like that amen but I just know in my soul it won't be long praise God hallelujah amen praise God but that uniting time has taken place now amen where we are brought together not in church membership we are brought into a Unity not by leadership telling you that you have to unite but we are brought together in a Unity that the Holy Spirit himself brings about and Paul calls this oh that I may make all men see oh what is the fellowship of that mystery when the Mysteries revealed to this one that one the other one then that brings them into a fellowship and they can Fellowship around that revelation of the mystery that God had hid in his mind through all these Generations aren't you glad that you can say I am one of them can you say I'm one of them see I'm one of them raise your hand if you're one of them I believe I'm one of them I'm one of them among one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them I'm one of them Holy Ghost people amen I'm so glad that I can say one of them oh praise God we are one of them glory to God Amen yes sir Hallelujah so God at this time and I wouldn't even go out with those scriptures Jesus talks about oh there's a time going to come when he's going to send his angels and a lot of people thought it meant Heavenly Angels but he's talking about these Earthly Angels Angels meaning messenger the word Angel actually means messenger and there are Heavenly Angels Earthly Messengers Angels also and so here we find that they are supposed to do what divide divide because the Earth as I said before is all mixed up mix up with everything and humans we don't know but what makes the dividing Hebrews 4 12 for the word of God is quick and sharper than the two-edged sword oh praise God and the word is going to make the difference Hallelujah one hears the word and it's too hot is that right and if there's a seed of God inside the other individual they hear the same word of God and say oh my this is nice hell the word is making that seed come into life come into manifestation an expression then one loves the sunlight and the other one hates it oh praise God but I love the light praise God because we want to walk in the light as he is in the light having Fellowship one with the other and the blood of Christ amen cleanses us from all our sins amen one we walk together like that say Amen so as this division is taking place where are you today which group are you in which side are you on he asked Joshua choose you this day whom you will serve you want to take that facade of Christianity out there called churchianity and think that that is real Christianity the devil tried to paint a picture that real Christianity is that you have to be ascetic and you have to be Monkish and you have to be this and you have to be that and that is not real Christianity risk real Christianity is to be free and you are totally free you can do whatever you want to if you're a real Christian but because you're a real Christian you don't you yourself don't want to do certain things because it will be against your heavenly father and you do that not because just the scripture tells you or you're under some commandment no you read all that and you know that's true but you're doing it because it's in your heart not to do that not to do this not to do that you are moved by that praise the name of the Lord hallelujah grace of God hallelujah now you say well who are these sons of God what is the nature of their manifestation how are we going to be able to to know them amen but it's being revealed right now it's your reaction to God's word Hallelujah let me give you an example now uh there was this eagle and the eagle um had an egg and a farmer kind of stole that egg and took it on his farm and put it under some hands and and and and you know the heat from from any bird is about I forgot how many degrees but it is enough to hatch an egg um some Robins actually hatched a few out right by my house there and and stuff so they're sitting on it and then they bring it to that place so he hatched out or when he had Stout he had Stout in the middle of a big old church he he he thought he was born again inside of that big nest surrounded by a whole lot of chickens and because they were going cheap cheap he thought he had to go cheap cheap but every time he tried to say cheap he goes yeah look at it they want to know what where you they start laughing at him where you got that from and so on like nothing came like a mocking stock because it's different when they're walking and they run and they get in their little you know all their little seeds here and they're scratching and everything like that you know he don't know why why is it his his foot is different this he can't run like them on the ground like that and everything else and you know he always got this longing looking up at the sky you don't know why and they want to know you must be so you got suffering from Sudden stroke because you're always looking up at the Sun and everything else like that but thank God we look at the sun too but the s-o-n and he keeps looking up at the at the Sun and like that you know and when the mom calls she caught some worms in a certain part of the of the farm yard and yeah and they all run over there like that and he couldn't understand what what was that he didn't understand it but you see all of them running there so he run too so he can get some kind of little bit of wormy meat but this meat anyway so he added but now one day that old Eagle remember that she had a child a a an egg I want to know what happened to it so she passed over and to her surprise there was her child in one of those Church churches locked up in a church Barn can't fly out is that right can't get out of there and clocking and trying to do like if he's an Earthbound creature and that mother Eagle passed over and as she passed over she let out a real scream oh my when he heard the voice he recognized Hallelujah that he understood right away he couldn't understand the hand he couldn't he could not understand spiritus Santos Dominos biscuits whatever he couldn't understand that amen praise the Lord oh my I originally I was Catholic of course you know and and I also I you know I understood Latin to a great extent a lot of it is gone for me now but the point is the minute that she screamed like he understood that well how did he understand did he go to a Bible School did he study in Northwest Bible College did he go and take some uh course in analytics and you know that sort of said no no no no no no no no no no no because he was one and nature is the same his origin was the same you know he come from there and he right away he understood I'm telling you the same thing you come from God you go to God Jesus said I come from God when I go back to God God I come from there from there and I'm going back there I come from him and I'm going back to him amen and now Jehovah the great ego passes over the Barnyard is rotten stinking Barnyard of this world with all this confusion chaos and crises and he passes over it and he screams out his word you never heard it like that before but when you hear it listen what he says he says but the Deep the call to the Deep in the depths of your soul there is something in the deeper this word that calls back to that deep in your soul spirit with spirit will meet the Holy Ghost will be a witness for the sons of God the sons of God we are the sons of God we washed our robes in the Crimson Fountain we are the sons of God we are the sons of God we are the sons of God we washed our robes and the Crimson Fountain we are the sons of God I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them I'm one of them Hallelujah I'm one of them oh I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them though these people may not learn it be nor boast of worldly Fame we're all their Pentecost baptized in Jesus name and telling now both far and wide his power is yet the same I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them I'm one of them Hallelujah I'm one of them that stands just for a minute so glad that I can say I'm one of them praise the Lord one of them Hallelujah I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them God bless you please be seated [Applause] hallelujah praise the name of the Lord God is revealing who are these sons who these children of his are because they were planted here on the Earth and their response to the word of God tells you what was hid in them they're responding to the word of God that was in that he placed in them amen hallelujah so this is the day when he's revealing to the world what they are and who they are they're not just another mortal but they you you in other words your sons and daughters of God you have the same qualities as God has you don't have to go struggling and fighting to have patience godliness broadly kindness because you are of the same nature you were born of him you now have to work that out that salvation manifest it make it known to the rest of the world but he is in you and now he is making himself manifest in and through you do you believe he lives in me he lives in you he lives in you he lives in me amen we are the sons of God and God lives in us we are God's house we are his Temple we are his Tabernacle amen Paul tells us we know it scripturally that no you not amen that your body is the Temple of the Holy Spirit the God Lives within you and He makes himself manifest amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah but now we are being made manifested in our completeness or in our perfection for the holy spirit is bringing us to what perfection we are not perfect in our manifestations we still stumble we fall we make mistakes we got to go back and say father forgive me cleanse me amen so Christianity is not one where you are in a straight jacket but God says Be Free if you're going to make mistakes you make them I am here you can come wash cleanse and get up and try again amen you don't hold the hand of your child all the days of their life whereas at some point you've got to let them go and they have to learn to walk on their own uh even when they just start walking and they fall and bruising up their knees if you run every time and pick them up when they're gonna learn to walk it's those Bruce knees is going to make them learn to walk real quick because when they bruise their knees they don't want to bruise them again burnt child dread fire and a bruised child don't want to bruise that knees over and over again and they're going to learn to walk amen every generation says oh I don't know how the Next Generation going to make it and the Next Generation comes along and make it right so I don't know and they come along and they still make it amen you don't have to be like me you have to be what you are live the way God wants you to live not don't live like how I am living amen but you live the way God wants you to live Hallelujah but you can't just run off and run out there and live however you want and think you're going to get a prize it's like a race horse just take off and gone in the fields running up a hillside running down the other side then he comes back and he wants to have a cup it's not going to work you got to run within God's guidelines of his word and when you run in that when you come to the end of the way he then you will have a prize amen you'll have a crown that will not fade away praise the name of the Lord Jesus hallelujah praise God oh God bless every one of you here I got a few more things to say I know I should stop right now but I want to say a few more things is that okay I have your permission God praise the name of the Lord hallelujah so as the sons of God are coming into their Revelation by their perfection for the Perfection of those sons and others of God completeness of being a god having a complete manifestation of himself in the individual character of these Believers right this is bringing them to that place where they are becoming uh exposed or use the word unveiled because they are God's masterpiece the true Sons and Daughters of God are God's masterpiece and the the great uh the great uh Masters would have their masterpieces on the wraps while they were painting it and when it comes to that time when it's come to its completeness then they will just pull the veil from off of their Masterpiece and then it's exposed to the entire world oh it's a glorious day it's a wonderful day but it's also a day when the critics are come out when you they got to pass through the Hall of critics and that is God allows that they must pass through the Hall of critics amen and then uh the critics there's nothing to find there is nothing there they are children of God oh they're trying to be live simple live humble live reverent live sacred oh my live loving and God will bless you God will bless you in every way don't try to make yourself you're a bigger Christian than anybody else with a bigger Bible and a bigger heart and whatnot just be a child of the king just try to help a fellow human being right just try to love somebody else in some way or the other that's all God asked of us he doesn't put upon us a burden Christianity is not a burden amen he said my yoke is light it's easy if you rest in him and realize it's not a religion of works you don't have to flagellate yourself you don't have to you're not forced to come here and and bring bags of money to the church Altar and then I can say oh God will bless you and you'll Prosper no no no no no nothing of the kind amen no sir that's what not Christianity is about amen God will bless you no doubt God will bless you in every way that's his choosing and your individual walk with him praise God but but a blanket stuff like that no God wants to bless every one of us but that's not what it is about this is your soul being in the balances and you are offering yourself to him I want to live for him but you know even if you don't live for him the way I believe I live for him God wants you to be a better citizen you hear what I said amen God wants you to be a better person God wants you to be a better citizen one that can live on this Earth and be a blessing to someone else somehow you may not even think of it a a right word an encouraging word just even your The Way You Walk you live your expressions to your neighbor just whistling in the morning what are you whistling about well I'm so happy to be alive or whatever sometimes that can pick up somebody else's day it lifts another person's Spirit oh praise God I'm glad I'm a part of God's economy spiritual economy praise the Lord hallelujah oh my praise the name of the Lord I I think I'm going to end here glory to God for today I have much more I can say praise the Lord but you know what we have been telling people that we believe and when I say we I don't know who and who in here is part of what I'm talking about you need to know that for yourself individually praise the Lord this is not an Elvis Presley concert will I spread my arms and said oh I just feel a whole lot of love in here no well that's not what this is about you individually must recognize Who You Are what God is doing in your life and that you are not here as a spectator but as a participator you are part of God's economy and God's plan is that right praise the name of the Lord and he's he's coming back again and to be here with us now there was this uh and I want to close with this now there was this very wealthy man owned a lot of cattle and a lot of ranches and his son uh wanted to have a wife he wanted to get married but none of the young women that he could see came to his taste and um and everywhere he went because they knew he was rich because he knew he was good looking and he had power and stuff like that uh you know the women would dress up and you know do everything they can to attract his attention because they want to be the one right and and so um he passed by going to visit one of his um superintendents on one of the ranches when he came by they gave a big party for him and this man had three daughters plus he had his niece whose parents had died and he took her in this is not Cinderella's Story but it's true this happened down in Arizona area where those tree daughters mistreated this um their cousin they're mistreated her let her do all the dishes much much of the cooking and the washing and the cleaning and this and that and the other and they were always preening their nails and fixing their eyelashes and you know doing their paints and powders and perfumes and whatever else right my goodness forgive me there I'm starting to walk eloquently but the fact is they had her doing that and he came and they gave this party and they put on their best party dresses my and they made themselves that did their hair and their walk and mine they walk as if they were gliding across the floor but there was he saw them all and he was so tired of it he just said I need to get some air and he went outside unless he was passing by where the kitchen was this niece of the Rancher came out with a bucket of water to throw out and she threw it out and then she stood up looking at the stars and everything else like that and he walked over to her and he began talking to her and they started talking and as they were talking he realized this is the one somebody like this that's that's just humble that's just character has something inside of her right and he told her he says do you know who I am this is oh yes you're you're the boss's son and this and that he said you know that I came looking to find a wife and she said yes sir I know he says well I believe you were the one I Choose You to be the one and I'll come back next year around this time and I'm gonna pick you up and we're going to go out of here okay so praise the name of the Lord oh my and so she's so excited go back in and when our cousins telling her cousins Oh my he told me that he chose me and that I'm one of the I'm his chosen one I'm his elected I'm going to be his bride like that she thought they would all be happy for her and they would Rejoice this is not they started laughing they were having a grand you are you going to be his brain you don't have the sophistication and the dignity you don't have the

I am a Christian I am a believer I am the true bride yeah you can tell them all you want and you may be right but you can tell them all you want and that's good and that the money your the action is going to prove maybe this thing is true maybe it's true the way how she acting like that but you know when it was probably proven when the day came a year later and they were all laughing and mocking and said look the Dead Come and he hasn't even come for you so he was making a fool of you all this time and then all of a sudden they heard the sound coming and here he comes back in those days with his carriage and they stop in front of the gate he did not even come in he just called out to her gave a shout and she believed him and because she believed him she prepared all her wedding garments

they're putting all things she put it all together and brought it right to the back there one of the Coachmen came and brought it in and she just went out sat beside him and they drove away in that
