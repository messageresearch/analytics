[0:39] and praise
[0:40] we thank him we magnify him
[0:44] and we adore him praise the lord
[0:48] i ask god for grace and mercy
[0:52] to the families of those
[0:56] who have passed away
[0:59] we live in a great a time of great
[1:03] peril trial testing
[1:07] grief and fear
[1:11] but in the midst of it all god
[1:14] standing in the shadows watches over his
[1:18] own he has promised that he will never
[1:21] leave us
[1:23] nor forsake us but that he will
[1:26] be with us to the very ending
[1:30] of the very age and more so we give
[1:34] god the glory that christians
[1:39] physically may die may expire
[1:43] but spiritually he that liveth and
[1:47] believeth
[1:47] in me though he were dead
[1:51] yet shall he live thanks be to god
[1:55] may god strengthen and encourage
[2:00] hearts around the world who may be
[2:03] suffering
[2:05] from the grief of the passing of a loved
[2:08] one
[2:10] they're passed from you into the
[2:13] presence of god
[2:15] and i believe god's warming comforting
[2:19] presence reaching out
[2:22] and saying come thou good and faithful
[2:26] servant
[2:27] enter into the joys of your lord
[2:32] i believe those are the greatest words
[2:35] that will ever be heard by those
[2:39] who have passed on and left the rest of
[2:42] us behind
[2:44] may god straighten us comfort us
[2:48] as paul said there are others who have
[2:51] gone before us
[2:53] therefore let us run the race
[2:57] with patience let us run
[3:00] not looking back looking behind but
[3:04] pressing forward to the mark of the high
[3:08] calling
[3:09] which is in the lord jesus christ
[3:13] how good to come at a time like this
[3:16] knowing that one has crossed
[3:19] into eternity others have crossed
[3:23] into eternity praise the lord may the
[3:26] great holy spirit
[3:29] warm our hearts and our lives
[3:33] comfort us in this hour and straighten
[3:36] us
[3:37] in this time of grief
[3:40] i also want to say
[3:43] that from around the world i have been
[3:47] receiving
[3:48] various letters to good neighbor
[3:51] ministries here our website
[3:56] wonderful letters from various
[3:59] ministers individuals
[4:03] and so on speaking of the blessing they
[4:06] have been receiving
[4:08] from the preaching of the word the
[4:11] reception
[4:12] of truth oh and the continuity
[4:16] of the revelation of the word that has
[4:20] been going forth
[4:22] it has been a strength a comfort
[4:25] a guide to many who would
[4:28] love to use this
[4:32] now why i'm remarking on this
[4:36] is to make it clear
[4:40] we are not here to set up a new
[4:44] denomination i am not
[4:47] here to gather a following
[4:51] after myself i am not
[4:55] here to build a name
[4:59] or or to gather fame or notoriety
[5:03] uh a matter of fact i believe it may be
[5:06] the opposite
[5:07] just a rough and ready fellow just
[5:11] one who simply and humbly wants to
[5:14] declare god's word and let the chips
[5:18] fall wherever they will
[5:20] amen oh praise god
[5:24] we are not here to ask you
[5:27] for money we are not here
[5:31] to ask you for anything but to
[5:34] give your life to jesus christ
[5:38] the rest is in the lord's hands
[5:42] and so we thank god
[5:46] for all our brothers and sisters
[5:48] wherever they are
[5:50] around the world but let me again
[5:53] repeat i'm not here to
[5:57] form another organization i'm
[6:00] not here to gather churches around
[6:03] myself
[6:04] i am not here to elevate myself
[6:08] in the modern day terms of
[6:11] being a a great archbishop
[6:14] or something of that nature amen
[6:17] of course from the bible a bishop is
[6:19] just a regular pastor
[6:21] uh it's a bishop it's it's uh that's
[6:25] been changed
[6:26] by the system uh over the
[6:29] years from ancient times so let me make
[6:33] that clear
[6:34] i am just here to represent jesus christ
[6:38] and to preach the word of god
[6:42] in his purity and with divine
[6:45] understanding
[6:46] that god has given me
[6:50] now you may want to differ from me and
[6:53] that is absolutely fine
[6:56] for we are both looking at the same
[6:59] bible the same word
[7:02] and you may want to or say it's a post
[7:06] and another man may want to say oh no
[7:10] uh touching the ears it's a fan
[7:13] and another one touching the
[7:16] the this snout uh
[7:19] will turn around and say oh that's a
[7:22] large horse that's a fireman's hose
[7:25] that's nothing not a pulse
[7:26] but the fact is the entire thing
[7:30] is an elephant and each one may be
[7:33] touching on a part of
[7:34] it and he's giving his revelation
[7:38] or his thought of what was given to him
[7:42] so uh god bless you wherever you are
[7:46] if you think what i am preaching
[7:49] it is uh not to your liking
[7:53] or anything like that god has fitted
[7:56] people from around the world that will
[7:59] receive my message
[8:01] a goddess fitted people that will
[8:03] receive your message
[8:05] you may think this is nonsense this is
[8:08] foolishness
[8:09] well if you call this crazy
[8:12] if you think this is foolishness then
[8:15] leave me alone
[8:16] and let me be a fool for christ let me
[8:19] give him praise and honor and glory
[8:22] using this life that i have
[8:26] to use it for him and for him alone
[8:31] praise god well for today our scripture
[8:35] is found
[8:36] in the book of joshua
[8:39] amen chapter 3
[8:43] reading from verse 11
[8:47] to verse 17. shall we read together
[8:53] behold the ark of the covenant of the
[8:57] lord of all the earth
[9:00] pass it over before you
[9:04] into jordan now therefore
[9:09] take you twelve men out of the tribes of
[9:12] israel
[9:14] out of every tribe a man
[9:19] and it shall come to pass as soon as the
[9:23] souls
[9:24] of the feet of the priests
[9:27] that bear the ark of the lord
[9:31] the lord of all the earth shall
[9:35] rest on the waters of jordan
[9:39] that the waters of jordan shall be cut
[9:42] off
[9:43] from waters that come down from above
[9:47] and they shall stand upon a heap
[9:52] and it came to pass when the people
[9:55] removed
[9:56] from their tents to pass over jordan
[10:00] and the priests came bearing the ark
[10:03] of the covenant before the people
[10:06] and as they that bear the ark were come
[10:10] unto jordan and the
[10:14] feet of the priests that bear the ark
[10:17] were dipped into the brim
[10:22] of the water for jordan
[10:25] overflowed all his banks all
[10:28] that time of harvest
[10:32] that the waters which came from above
[10:35] stood
[10:35] and rose up upon
[10:38] an heap very far from the city
[10:42] adam that is beside zaritan
[10:46] and those that came down towards the sea
[10:51] of the plane even the salzi
[10:54] failed and were cut off
[10:57] and the people passed over
[11:01] right against jericho
[11:05] and the priests that bear the ark of the
[11:07] covenant
[11:09] stood firm on dry ground
[11:14] in the midst of
[11:18] the jordan until all the people
[11:22] were past clean over
[11:25] jordan oh praise his marvelous and
[11:29] wonderful name let us pray dear ones in
[11:33] christ
[11:34] our gracious god our heavenly father
[11:38] poured down upon us the blessed holy
[11:41] spirit
[11:43] anoint thy word and anoint the hearts
[11:46] to receive the word may
[11:49] you lord god receive all glory honor and
[11:53] praise
[11:55] may your name be uplifted may your
[11:58] word be made manifest may your word be
[12:02] made clear
[12:04] and mere hearts rejoiced in christ
[12:07] together giving you all praise
[12:10] honor and glory amen
[12:13] in jesus name praise god
[12:17] hallelujah now
[12:21] my subject today is the crossing
[12:25] the crossing but in actual fact
[12:29] i want to speak my friends
[12:32] about three crossings
[12:36] three crossings israel
[12:40] crossing first of all crossing from
[12:44] egypt into the wilderness
[12:48] crossing the red sea
[12:51] i believe my friends that if we are to
[12:54] go
[12:55] back and look at this picture
[12:58] we are thinking of moses
[13:01] and the children of israel down in
[13:04] egypt's land
[13:06] sun and sand er and everything all
[13:10] around them
[13:13] moving around their eastern garments
[13:17] task masters cracking their whips
[13:20] on the backs of those poor uh
[13:24] weight laden slaves that were
[13:28] forced to build the the pharaoh's
[13:32] treasure cities burial places
[13:36] all the places and roads for their great
[13:39] empire
[13:41] they were pressed into service
[13:44] and their taskmasters cracked
[13:47] the whips across their backs without
[13:50] mercy fear or favor
[13:54] but then the 400 years
[13:57] that god had promised abraham
[14:01] that after 400 years i will remember
[14:06] your children abraham when they
[14:09] cry to me i'll answer their cry
[14:12] and i'll deliver them from the hand
[14:16] of their oppressor and so what happened
[14:20] as you know i'm shortening the story
[14:24] how that god raised up moses
[14:27] from the baby in the bull rushes
[14:30] to the time when he became a son
[14:33] of pharaoh's daughter and there he was
[14:37] raised trained in all
[14:38] art sciences wisdom knowledge of of
[14:42] egypt and was accounted
[14:46] that in his day he was one of the wisest
[14:51] men
[14:52] in all of egypt and so
[14:55] there was moses at the height
[14:59] of his ambitions at the height
[15:02] of his great achievements
[15:05] and while he was at this great height of
[15:08] his achievements
[15:09] the god of heaven looked down and
[15:13] knew of course that moses was a chosen
[15:16] vessel
[15:18] and god plucked him out of that
[15:22] after his great uh
[15:26] the great time of killing the egyptian
[15:29] and then having to flee into the
[15:31] wilderness
[15:33] but it was the leading of god god was
[15:36] doing that for his own purposes
[15:39] and there we find that many times
[15:42] many of us even in the modern age
[15:45] we may have a great job we may have a
[15:48] great
[15:48] powerful position we may be
[15:52] anyone for that matter oh glory
[15:55] god hallelujah but yet one day
[15:59] god will come to you and
[16:02] speak into your heart whether by
[16:05] dream whether by the preaching of the
[16:07] word whether by the reading of your
[16:09] bible
[16:10] whether you're a king a commoner a
[16:12] priest a judge a policeman
[16:14] a fireman a scientist whoever you are
[16:17] wherever you are you may be in a
[16:20] powerful uh influential
[16:23] or financially capable position
[16:29] and yet god will come and find you
[16:33] wherever you are and let you
[16:36] know that you are his son you are his
[16:40] daughter
[16:40] you are one of his chosen vessels you
[16:43] are one of his servants
[16:45] hallelujah praise god hallelujah
[16:48] and he may cause me to even say this
[16:51] so that you may just hear
[16:54] these words and recognize that it's the
[16:58] god of heaven calling you speaking his
[17:02] word
[17:03] that you may recognize you may even have
[17:06] had
[17:07] a premonition before
[17:10] god might have given you some
[17:13] inclination before
[17:15] god might have spoken to your heart
[17:17] somewhere
[17:18] and now the irs coming the power of god
[17:22] the great holy spirit you calling you to
[17:25] your place and your position
[17:27] that you might recognize and know him
[17:31] and the story goes on in the midst of
[17:34] the heat
[17:36] of egypt and not the sands
[17:40] of the time
[17:43] moses across the pharaoh and his entire
[17:46] empire
[17:47] just imagine one prophet
[17:51] one man anointed by the living god
[17:55] was enough to go down to egypt
[17:59] and take over the entire empire
[18:02] by the power of god's holy spirit
[18:06] amen glory to god and there
[18:09] was moses and he
[18:12] told pharaoh about the plagues
[18:16] pharaoh in his obstinacy and his
[18:20] stubborn uh personality rebellion
[18:23] against god
[18:25] turns around and says who is your god
[18:27] and the plagues ensued
[18:30] the plagues began to come upon them
[18:33] and after a while pharaoh's own child
[18:36] died
[18:37] reaping wailing in his house and he
[18:40] couldn't take it anymore
[18:42] and he says go out go out take them
[18:45] and go out with your flocks with your
[18:47] words go
[18:48] out in the wilderness go out i don't
[18:51] want you anymore
[18:52] oh my praise god hallelujah
[18:56] some of you because of the holy spirit
[18:58] in you
[18:59] because of your choosing because of your
[19:02] predestinated position
[19:04] you may even be in a denomination but
[19:07] already you're
[19:08] finding they're ready to kick you out
[19:11] the reason why it's not because you
[19:14] already recognize
[19:15] who you are and what god is doing to you
[19:18] but the devil
[19:19] recognizes who you are and what is in
[19:22] you
[19:23] and the things you are saying the
[19:26] actions you are
[19:27] you are having in your life they are
[19:30] unnerving them getting them very
[19:34] nervous and so you find yourself
[19:37] as an ugly duckling and plays to the
[19:40] point
[19:41] where they want nothing much to do with
[19:43] you you may be a preacher
[19:45] in an area and you're preaching the word
[19:47] of god
[19:49] they don't like what you're preaching
[19:51] they get mad at you they want to harass
[19:53] you harangue you
[19:54] they want us a spell say all manner of
[19:57] things against you
[19:58] and they want to speak against your
[20:00] preaching your teaching
[20:01] instead of leaving you alone to preach
[20:04] the word
[20:05] because you're not troubling them let
[20:06] them preach the word anyone else preach
[20:09] the word
[20:10] and praise god just leave him alone
[20:13] but the devil won't leave you alone i'm
[20:15] afraid for jesus said they persecuted me
[20:19] and they're going to persecute you also
[20:22] praise god hallelujah
[20:24] now this is not deep message this is no
[20:27] mysterious
[20:28] message this is something to go
[20:31] straight to your soul and speak right
[20:34] into your heart
[20:36] to let you know where you are and so
[20:39] moses led the churn of israel out
[20:43] i can see them gathering their flocks
[20:46] and words
[20:48] oh i can see them piling and packing
[20:51] their
[20:51] things upon their their blocks upon
[20:54] their
[20:55] their mules and their horses and their
[20:57] asses and
[20:59] and and just streaming out
[21:02] of egypt and heading towards
[21:06] the wilderness of course
[21:09] before they got to the wilderness
[21:13] they had to cross the red sea
[21:17] amen oh and
[21:20] you know pharaoh which is a type of the
[21:24] devil
[21:26] had set them free but after a while he
[21:29] thought about it
[21:30] why should i set them free what's the
[21:32] matter with me that i let them go
[21:35] and better gather my army and go back
[21:38] and capture them and bring them back
[21:40] again
[21:41] that's the same way when one is prayed
[21:43] for for sickness
[21:45] or a devilish cast out jesus said he go
[21:48] it
[21:48] about and he he looks up for another
[21:51] house
[21:52] and when many can't find one he said
[21:54] well why did i let that person go i
[21:56] should really go back and get them again
[21:58] and that devil will seek to return from
[22:01] whence he came
[22:02] and so under the hot sun of egypt
[22:07] i can see pharaoh with his army
[22:10] coming down towards the israelites that
[22:13] were
[22:14] towards the red sea the banks of the sea
[22:17] wanting to go over but there is a wide
[22:20] sea
[22:21] in front of them they had to make a
[22:23] crossing
[22:25] but how are they going to cross oh
[22:28] my and so pharaoh
[22:31] coming down against them to take them
[22:35] back into slavery bondage
[22:38] and the task masters were ready to crack
[22:41] the whips
[22:42] once more upon them and if you know the
[22:45] geography of that area
[22:47] one mountain on one side another
[22:49] mountain on the other side
[22:51] the sea before them and pharaoh
[22:54] coming with his hosts behind them
[22:58] charging down upon them with thousands
[23:01] of horses and
[23:02] chariots and horsemen armor streaming
[23:06] their
[23:06] all my friends the brass the the gold
[23:10] the silver
[23:11] bucklers upon them shining in the
[23:14] sunshine
[23:14] the plumes upon their helmets swaying in
[23:18] the wind
[23:19] as they charge down upon them
[23:22] and the israelites got nervous begin to
[23:25] scream to moses
[23:27] but praise god moses turned to them
[23:30] and said you should trust the living god
[23:33] you'll know it if you've seen the
[23:35] great movie the ten commandments you'd
[23:38] have seen how
[23:39] charleston heston stood up on that large
[23:43] rock it may not have been that way but
[23:46] he dramatized it
[23:48] how moses stood upon the rock raised up
[23:51] his rod
[23:52] amen praise god and called upon god
[23:57] and asked god to deliver his people the
[24:00] lord will deliver you by the
[24:02] mighty hand and the bible tells us
[24:06] how the wind blew and when the wind blew
[24:08] the waters began to churn
[24:11] and moved the east wind and the west
[24:14] wind blew
[24:15] and planted the waters glory to god
[24:18] hallelujah
[24:20] and the water spotted and the wind dried
[24:24] up even the bottom of where
[24:28] they would walk normally that would be
[24:31] muddy and
[24:32] everything else but the wind blew the
[24:34] waters apart
[24:36] and then it dried up where they're
[24:38] supposed to walk
[24:39] oh praise god and god's people
[24:43] came right down and were able to
[24:46] walk right over hurry across that
[24:49] river that great red sea amen
[24:53] hallelujah being chased by satan
[24:56] oh praise god my brothers my
[25:00] sister many times we are in positions
[25:03] where we feel we don't know
[25:06] how we're gonna get over how we gonna

[25:25] oh all manner of stuff behind me
[25:28] how am i going to get out of this but
[25:30] thank god we
[25:31] serve a god that will make a way where
[25:35] there
[25:35] is no way he'll open a door where there
[25:39] is no
[25:39] door you think you got monk rivers you
[25:43] tinker and crossable
[25:44] he you got mountains you can't tunnel
[25:47] true
[25:48] god specializes in things that are
[25:51] impossible
[25:52] and he will do whatsoever that he wants
[25:56] to do for nothing is impossible with god
[25:59] only believe
[26:00] for all things are possible to them
[26:04] that will believe the word of god
[26:06] hallelujah
[26:08] oh my listen you'll notice
[26:12] from the inner veil brother branham
[26:15] speaking
[26:17] after israel and overcome the israel
[26:21] egyptians
[26:22] by passing through by grace passing
[26:26] through the red sea
[26:27] god drowned the egyptians behind
[26:32] which is a type
[26:36] of the passing through the blood
[26:39] of the lord jesus christ
[26:42] and that all the task masters
[26:46] that once drove you to sin

[35:18] december 1965

[35:28] should be around two
[35:30] thousand and five
[35:34] one generations past and passing

[35:41] that witnessed the ministry of this
[35:44] prophet
[35:45] has passed and their passing
[35:50] one by one they gain the portal

[37:38] and god blessed them and god used
[37:42] that and is using that for his glory
[37:45] and for his honor and that is just
[37:48] as powerful as a man that understands
[37:52] all the mysteries of the kingdom is just
[37:56] to
[37:56] tell what god has given you and what you
[38:00] know
[38:00] either in its complexity are in its
[38:03] humility
[38:04] and simplicity and god comes in just the
[38:08] same
