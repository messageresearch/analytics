========================================
[Music] good evening friends it's good to be in the house of God good to be together again on this wonderful Wednesday evening may the Lord bless you may he cause his face to shine upon you and grant you peace in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ now this is the continuation of the seven church ages lesson five lesson five on this online broadcast maybe pray read our scriptures and commence with this teaching out of the Word of God our gracious Heavenly Father we ask for your divine blessing upon the world we ask your blessing upon all these that are watching listening wherever they are even on to the uttermost part of the earth may you take all the praise the honor and glory and may your word go forth Lord Jesus with clarity and divine understanding be given to all those who desire to have it has become it ourselves to you our selves to you now in service for your glory and honor alone in Jesus name Amen reading from John from the book of Revelation chapter 1 verse 4 John to the seven churches which are in Asia grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the and spirits which are before his throne now friends let us go back to the Bible last week of course we touched upon the deity of Jesus Christ and showing to you the fallacy of the doctrine of the Trinity of the Godhead now let's go back to the Bible and see who or what God was in the beginning now according to the revelation that God gave about himself he Jehovah appeared to Israel in the form of a pillar of fire and there he was high above their tents in that form and as the angel of the Covenant he lived in that pillar of fire and a led Israel daily for they can see the pillar fire and when it moved they move when it stopped they stopped but one day he was made manifested he Jehovah was made manifested in a virgin born body that was prepared for him as it's written in the scriptures our body has now prepared me now the god that was tabernacled above the tents of Israel in the form of the pillar of fire now took upon himself a tenth of human flesh and tabernacled amongst us as a man but he was the same God now God above us God among us and now in our day it's God in us now the Bible teaches us clearly that God was in Christ the body of course was Jesus and in him in that body called Jesus in him dwelt the fullness of the Godhead bodily God dwelt in Christ but nothing can be plainer than that that we can see the truth of the revelation of the Godhead if he wasn't three people then back there in Israel above their tents and he isn't three people now for God is a God that never changes oh praise this wonderful name that we serve this mighty God now Jesus himself said in John chapter 16 verse 27 to 28 I came from God and I'm going back to God clearly that is exactly what happened because after he he was crucified of course he disappeared from off the scene his next reparent was when Paul met him on the road to Damascus and Paul saw him and the form of a pure fire or a blinding light that struck him off of his horse you see he had gone back to the way he was exactly the way he said he would do I came from God and I'm going back to God he was the purifier over the tents of his and now he went back to his original form and position as that purifier that's true pull off of his horse and to prove it the boys from the light said Saul Saul why persecutest thou me and Paul asked the question who art thou Lord and the voice answered back the purifier answered by this blinding shining light answered back and said I am Jesus whom thou persecuted Oh Paul immediately recognized that pure fire was God and he asked the question who art thou Lord and the voice from the pure fire answered back and said this God this purifier answered back and said I am Jesus you see he had gone back to his original form that he was in before he had taken on a tabernacle of flesh now Luke chapter 2 verse 11 says for unto you Is Born This Day in the City of David a saviour which is Christ the Lord now he was born Christ but eight days later he had to have an earthly name and the earthly name that was given to him was Jesus now I was born a cypress and when I was born they gave me the name of John you see he was given he was Christ but when he came to the earth he had to be given an earthly name and his earthly name was Jesus which makes him Jesus Christ because we know clearly friends that he that upward Tabernacle was called Jesus but on the inside he was the Lord of glory on the inside he was the great I am on the inside he my friends was the mighty God the Almighty God manifested in flesh he was God the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost the only God and he is all in all yes Father Son and Holy Ghost are just titles they are not names that is why we baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ if you were to come to good neighbor ministries and ask me or any of my deacons to baptize you in water they will baptize you in no other name but the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you see for the name Jesus Christ is a name not a title that is the Jesus Christ is the name of those titles just like if there was to be a you were to have a newborn a baby you find there that you would want to it is a son you will want to name him Jim or Jeff for or John now baby is his title but or John is his name see that's the way it is No so that's it friends just like that I I'm her father but that's not my name I'm a son to my mother but that's not my name I'm a human being that's what I am but that is not my name those are titles my name is John and that is the difference between the titles of Father Son and Holy Ghost and the name Jesus Christ and that is why we baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now we do not baptized in Jesus name for there are thousands of Jesus's many people even before Jesus was born what that were called in Jesus but there was only one born Jesus the Christ the Anointed One the Word of God the Word of God made flesh in a body called Jesus but he is distinguished by being the Christ the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ praise God John Scott's bells listen carefully in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us see there it is Jesus the tabernacle said my father dwells in me my father dwells in me why because the farmer spirit the great one had created this body and the body was the son of that spirit and the father came and dwelt in the son who was not another but he dwelt in the in the body that he had brought on the scene or created or prepared for himself God dwelt in Christ Jesus was the tent that God dwelt in this is which he spoke of when he said Solomon you want to build me a house how can you build me a house the heavens of heavens cannot contain me but I'll build myself in other words of my own house and that house of God is Jesus Christ for God dwelt in Christ amen and amen now God has many titles Jehovah our righteousness he is our peace he is the ever-present water from the rock he is father he is son he is all his ghosts but he only has one human name you may call him by many other names but he but by many other titles but he only has one human name oh praise the name of the Lord now don't be confused by any of these offices for it's God in a tree form manifestation on earth he was a prophet in heaven at this time he is our great High Priest offering in the session for our sins in the presence of his throne he was a prophet he is the priest and coming back to earth he is the king of kings and Lord of lords yes that's who he is yes no wonder the scripture says Amen he my friends that was that is and he that is to come thanks Peter God hallelujah blessed be his holy name now notice carefully now the revelation that we are bringing is that Jesus Christ is God I want you to understand that clearly that Jesus Christ is God and that day Jehovah of the Old Testament is the Jesus of the New Testament it's just that Jehovah went into a body fulfilling God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself and no matter what anyone tries to do you can never and cannot prove that they were three God's by using this Bible or from anything God has said in his word but it does take a revelation by the Holy Spirit for you to recognize that but and Satan has crept into the church into the highest heights of of accomplishments within the church and using his position as a great angel of light as he did in heaven has blinded the minds of men blinded and blindfolded the hearts of men that's why we sing this song open the eyes of my heart Lord that let me see you I want to see you which is the presuppose that that person was blinded and could not recognize who is Lord but I'm here to proclaim that Jesus Christ as Lord Jesus Christ is Father Son and Holy Ghost amen and amen yes sir Judas crept into the church blinded the preachers blinded the people to this marvelous truth but takes me to God it not long my friends where they vary Church of Rome stop baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ will touch on that later but we understand that originally they Roman the church baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ as I do and as true believers do they baptize in no other name but the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now this takes a revelation but takes me to God the God's powerful prevailing overcoming church is built on the rough foundation of Revelation upon this rock will I build my church and the gates of Hell will not prevail against it thanks be to God the foundation of God's church is prevailing revelation and I use the word prevailing because he clearly said that the gates of Hell will not prevail against the true Church of the Living God which is the same it will fight it will try to overcome try to block out try to to dumb down and line the Church of God but it will not prevail against the overcoming blood wash powerful Church of the Living God in this day praise God so we need revelation to recognize this but in actual fact for the water baptism we don't need a revelation you don't really need a revelation because it's right there before your very face in the Word of God in the Bible for you to recognize us now that's the way the Apostles baptized and if they didn't baptize that way if they did not recognize or what Matthew 28 men when it says baptizing them in the name of the Father of the Son and of the Holy Spirit if they did not recognize that then when they spoke in in Acts chapter 2 verse 38 and other scriptures acts 4:12 and so on is that then there will be in disobedience there would have been in disobedience to the Word of God but clearly when they were asked the question men and brethren what shall we do to be saved and a Peter the so called for spoken and said clearly and unequivocally he said clearly repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and that is because he understood the name of the person who carried those titles oh yes so he said be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so clearly here we see in the Word of God they knew what the name was then you what and who carried in him and so they baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and there is no place no place that anyone can find in the scriptures where anyone anywhere was baptized any other way but in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ no wonder the Apostle says all that you do do it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and again for there is no other name given under heaven whereby we must be saved but the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ now clearly friends common sense will tell you that they book of Acts is the Church of the Living God in action and yes they baptized only in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ then that is the way we should all be baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so because that's they as we usually say that's the original church that's the pattern for the ages that were to come and so we should accept the truth of God's Word despite all these traditions of men all these teachings of men all these insertions and interjections of men into the very word of God blinding poisoning and distracting the minds of men from God's Word and team with the Word of God that he has given to us to recognize what he has said no we realize that even in the Bible they that work they work some people that were baptized wrong and you may be baptized wrong here it was the great great the wonderful people Apollo's other ones that Priscilla Aquila they were baptized wrong and so fun moving through the upper parts of Ephesus preaching the word and being received of the people they said they never heard it in this fashion we have not ever heard of the Holy Spirit and Paul said listen he explained to them we should want to baptize them Anto because normally you're baptized in water in the name of Jesus Christ the next thing that follows is the Holy Spirit comes to the believer to open up their understanding to anoint them with the waters of the word of God hallelujah so tyrannous he said then unto what were you baptized and they said we were baptized to John's baptism he says oh no John was point - this John was pointing unto him that was to come and he asked him and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ so if you were taking John's baptism now you need to take the baptism of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and they were humble enough they were understanding and winning enough to submit to the teaching of the word of God and a Bible says for upon re baptize them in water proper Christian baptism in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ there were five people but they still got three baptized you may be a fine person they felt secure they felt there it was fine they were already Saints they didn't need to listen to anybody else but the Holy Spirit through the bridge and a fall opened up and expanded and magnified the Word of God in such a way that their understanding opened up and they recognized their deep need and asked to be rebaptised by Paul hallelujah thanks be to God I'm not Paul I can't be bald and never will be Paul but I'm still a servant here to baptize you in water if you're so desire in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ praise God now said if you have been baptized in water the right and proper way which is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ then God is obligated to fill you with the Holy Spirit and God my friends will begin to unfold the wonderful treasures of his word and His grace opening up the eyes of your understanding and filling you completely with His divine self praise God now Paul was teaching in Ephesus and Paul had not yet met Peter and yet he was written exactly what Peter preached in Acts chapter 2 why because they were of the same spirit which is why Paul later on said oh I wish I could make all men see what is the Fellowship of this mystery because if two persons are in that same genuine Holy Spirit led by him with never having met like the prophets in the Bible like the great sages and men of old without knowing each other over that period of 1,600 years yet they spoke the same things and everything they said rolled together until it formed one book by these different writers over this period of time the mighty paths all his spirit is still at work today he is still able to a night man use men for his glory by the same Holy Spirit that that's written off within the very Bible now you'll find if you have the time research this there is a genuine record of a water baptism that took place in ancient Rome in d 100 it was and has been reproduced in the Time magazine December 5th 1965 and I quote the deacon raised his hands and Publius Decius step through the baptistry door standing with the deep in the pool was Marcus Vaska the woods he was smiling as Publius waded into the pool beside him krita's he's he asked credo responded Publius I believe that my salvation comes from the Lord Jesus Christ who was baptized under Pilate Pontius Pilate and with him him I died that with him and I may have eternal life then he felt strong arm supporting him as he let himself fall backward into the pool and he heard Marcus's voice in his ears saying i baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ as the cold water flows round about him friends that's the way the baptism was done in Rome not for convenience sake not for a little sprinkle here or a sprinkle there not for a flag passed over your head not just for a handshake of fellowship not in the resort but just as Jesus was baptized coming up out of the water just as the Bliss was baptized here in ancient Rome which was original the Roman water baptism but the church has drifted away from her original position the entire Worldwide Church I'm talking about yes has drifted from the original Word of God and a way of baptism according to this Bible that we have here now right up until this time that your the truth was lost and did not return until this time this last page in this hour in which we live whoever tells us clearly that pervy Elijah the prophet will return in this Gentile Age praise God the spirit of Elijah will anoint a man in this age and he will turn the hearts of the children that apostolic children back to the apostolate father's oh praise God it's happening it's happening right now by the power of the Holy Spirit and I thank my God for this oh yes friends know this we are speaking about from the time of the Nicean council till the turn of the century this true baptism was not heard about any longer for it was pushed aside for a Trinitarian baptism which closed early misunderstood the word of God and misinterpreted what God has said and to this day continuing to baptize in titles empty titles of Father Son and Holy Ghost and not in the name of the person that carries those titles yes sir but now thanks be to God that's restoration and it has come back it's been restored the truth of the word is now being restored to everyone that had an ear let him hear what the Spirit of God is saying to you rip Satan can't keep that revelation down he cannot keep this revelation of the name of Jesus the revelation of the Godhead the understanding of the truth water baptism he can't block it out for if the spirit wants to give it he cannot block it for God has but who shall resist who shall bruise who shall prevail against the mighty god the almighty when he brings his words for he sends his word and his word performs what every sense and it runs throughout the earth oh please God to accomplish whatever he wills it goes to any person anywhere in any land in any language of any culture region race religion wherever you are the Word of God goes out hallelujah for it's him the word the holy spirit making himself known in these last days praise God hallelujah now if there are really three gods then maybe that's why because of thinking that they baptize in those titles but the revelation that's in this Bible that was given to John clearly is that there is one God and His name is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ and you you baptize or we baptize for one God and only one God Peter the Apostle Peter baptized that way he did it on the day of Pentecost Paul baptized that way all the Apostles baptized that is way now Paul had to be true to the revelation that God had given to him which was let all the house of Israel know assuredly which means for certain for sure that God had made this same Jesus but lower than Christ he is the Lord Jesus Christ thanks be to God I tell you friends this great Lord Jesus Christ is one God than the hope of the old testament is now manifested in human form under the human name of Jesus Christ Philip once said to him one day Lord show us the father and it will satisfy us and Jesus listen close to how jesus answered him because remember in the Old Testament he was called I am I am that I am when offended when those Pharisees and Sadducees you know asked him he said before Abraham was I am and now Philip is asking here Lord show us the father and obviously Jesus was puzzled that they did not yet fully recognize who he was and so he said have I been so long with you have I you're asking for the father and yet he said have I I'm the father the spirit that was in that body answering John Philip and saying have I been so long with you and you don't know me he that has seen me has seen the father why for I and the father are one the same person I am the father are one there is no three God I am one God hallelujah and so friends that's the way this hearing nice in that you may say well brother Simon yeah you know it's it's three gods because here we are he said I and my father are one they are one in purpose there one in objectives there one in planning but he made it clear that was not that kind of a oneness that was being spoken about he clearly said I and my father are one right no the question may be asked you're looking at me you're seeing me now but do you see my wife and if you were to see my wife does that mean you're seeing me obviously not Jesus wanted them to understand clearly that he was their one true God now made manifest in flesh and said I and my father are one praise God Zechariah chapter 14 verse 7 as I'm winding this down now said clearly it shall be light about the evening time or saying at evening time it shall be light in other words light will shine in evening time of the world revelation will come on the spending will come the power the presence of the holy spirit will prevail in these last days and will come upon the earth that's the little hymn written many years ago saying it shall be light about the evening time the path to glory you will surely find in the waterway is the light to be buried in the precious name of Jesus young and old repent of all your sins the Holy Ghost will surely enter in the evening light has come it is a fact that God and Christ are one thanks be to God God and Christ are one let me leave you with this tone and with this topic and may you sink upon these things search the Scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life don't just take my words for it go to the Scriptures searching the Scriptures and see one of these things be true in the name of the lord jesus christ god bless you real good saints god bless you wherever you are for listening for receiving the Word of God for this hour let us pray gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for the going forth of thy light thy truth thy words made a gospel bells ring within the hearts of the hearers and may the Holy Spirit take the word that was preached and long after the lights are out
