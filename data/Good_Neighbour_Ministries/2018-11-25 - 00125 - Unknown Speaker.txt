TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] he meets any kinds of singing Jesus constantly shifts constant planets that is constant inspiration under glass [Music] this purpose Lord it's Wednesday night and it's Bible study night and it gives us an opportunity to look at the areas of the word and study and kind of draw from it what we have need of and what we desire from the Lord because he knows that you need faith he knows that's why he says don't fail to assemble yourselves because that's where I'm going to give you the faith in order to overcome and produce the part of the word you are many more so tonight we're going to read from the book of second kings thank you musicians god bless you second Kings chapter 2 we're gonna read for a verse you mean two verse eight praise God our gracious Eternal Father Lord Jesus we thank you tonight or that we can assemble knowing that your anointing your spirit is in our midst and that Lord these are precious times for the sons and daughters of God when we can gather by faith and will that you come and bail with us and speak and hear through us and it just creates such an atmosphere or God you can be strengthened and encouraged and blessed and we can leave different than the way we entered in Fondren that is our desire tonight Lord that you would just take each vessel or move us aside now allow us to move into heavenly places with you and receive all that you would have for us granted we pray will humanity aside but the supernatural take control and the Elijah from verse 8 2nd Kings chapter 2 and Elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smote the waters and they were divided hither and thither so that they too went over on dry ground and it came to pass when they were gone over that I gave my job said unto Elijah ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken away from thee and he has said I pray thee let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me and he said thou hast asked a hard thing nevertheless it without see me when I am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so well praise God for it aren't you glad that you've recognized that God sent a prophet in this day aren't you glad that your eyes have been needed to realize that that the Word of God you know I remember when I came to this message I didn't realise brother Branham was but then there came a time in a season when it was made known unto me and it was made known unto you and this is what gives us to talk about tonight you may be seen double portion I believe it's a double portion a perfect favor praise God and so tonight we're going to be looking at that I believe that double portion anointing is what has come down upon the church in this and in this hour and she's operating under a faith that is beyond literal faith let's put it that way because I believe that it's going to take perfect fit for us to actually receive this body change that the word promises we are going to receive because that isn't a promise for this up it is a body change it is the rapture that is the portion of the word there but we have to you know sometimes become a look and see where it is that God is right now of what it is that he's fulfilling the portion of the word that is fulfilling and where the greatest strength and the greatest anointing the greatest overcoming ability comes when you recognize the place of the word the placing of the word the season of the word the anointing that's on the word for your day and what it is that you are expected to do by the portion of faith that's being released because it's an it's a portion of maintenance being released through the preaching of the word unity that's why it's so important that we get under it illegally we get under a ministry we must be hundra a God led pastor directed ministry in this David this hour and move in ways where you're jumping from here to there in the cab gaining speed right that's where you're going to get what you need you're under you're under the wrong revelation you're under the wrong expectation you're not you're not likely not where God wants you to be and God needs you in a certain place under a certain ministry fulfilling a certain portion of the Word of God and if you're if you're moving in different ways and your own interpretation and good looking for something you know you're looking for something you know really deep you're gonna miss about you're just gonna miss him a hundred billion miles amen but you want to look here you want to see just here we're gonna look at a live show and that notice that Elijah you know she'd have to her eyes Adie Elijah you know she recognized that he was the word her heard his name and she realized that this is where God loves this is the anointing for God was moving and revealing him and making himself known and doing supernatural things the word of the Lord was being released and spoken right from his love and I should realize that him and he crazy he just said there's no way I'm gonna let him out of my sight [Music] [Music] this was where he had to go you can't wait to assemble you can't wait for the word of God to come forth and meet your needs and speak to your life with your situations and to serve the very needs that you have the night show us was you know she was soul focus she realized that this is where I needed to be this is my place this is where God is gonna bless me this is where crockett amiss my blessing and I want you to know as it was when it was wet when they crossed over it was when they crossed over that ami Shia she realized that this is where I was to receive why because it was there that Elijah the word for her day said what is it that you have need and you know in this life you're going to school you're going to work you're doing all kinds of things and your focus in the things of the world is going to take you away from God if you get too focused on the things of the world and you get too focused on trying to preserve your own - and then you know work towards your own personal goals and everything else I mean that's fine but you need to realize that this is this is the hour where God is supernatural you need to just live marry and spend all our money and just saw your house and just burn it all up but you must have a revelation of who you are this message didn't he wants to give responsibility to just because work because remember when God comes on the scene and he wants to bulldoze work he's going to anoint some people because that's how his word gets fulfilled cerissa is a supernatural event but there's some people that's a revelation revelation of the rapture it's not a future event is because you're in it [Music] the change is what it's done in the progress and the at the end of faith in them and then and the body change in the Equality in happiness necessary to bring it to pass is now taking place it's filling of something it's perfect personalizing and self in you because he's is the word and he wants you to realize and I'm looking at my figure she caught such a revelation that with that double portion [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] what is your situation interpretation is you get four stars and they want anybody on any circumstance character [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and so we progression of the church for this name this hour have to recognize see what this has been already fulfilled and not be so you know because there's a lot there still you know every word that the Prophet said you can only say what we believe [Music] [Music] my position there's an anointing that comes upon that position it's like I've always said this is God's position in the place individuals in the body in the Church of God with a purpose and a plan and when he position he places a person or an individual into whatever office whether it be a deacon or trustee or a Russian or a sunday-school teacher it's a position that God individuals beyond and recognized and she went to pieces he's you gotta get rid of yourself you gotta you gotta get rid of your own ideas all your upbringing all your tradition all the things that you thought that they should be [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all these things because and what the sons of the prophets which were to view a gear pole sorry they said the spirit of Elijah does rest on the Elijah and they came to bow themselves to the before you see when you get to a place where you're walking with God you've got that desire to to please the Lord you just you're walking because this this is the our seats of God I want you to hear me though this is the hour where this church goes back to the free world agency and faith and revelation there was no fear there was no doubt there was perfect love and perfect harmony they walked together God said whatever you say I give you dominion over the earth look if you say to this tree he plucked up and will go whatever you made in the animals and he'll please me you see they were so one they were so one and they were walking so together there was perfect faith between it's a special block and like I can't even fully fathom sometimes I get to thinking about it and I think Lord I know that we're doing back for the foundation your position you're crazy you're talking it was all from the for the foundations of the world everything that's being released now through the preaching of the word should be bringing you out of your spiritual of Asia and into the position that God wants you to be walking in just before you take a rapture exactly so this is a walk this is a progression of God's Word that means [Music] [Music] [Music] there's I can't really describe almost around this walk we're all a part of it if you're if you're walking with God you've got the revelation of this day this hour you've got a desire to move on to press on to get to get to know understand the mind of God of the purpose of God for your life and for your walk so that you can do what it is that God requires of you it's a super habitable walk and set it up you know Enoch he walked with God [Music] [Music] [Music] for so many ways to please the Lord they think thinkin that they can you know work that they can you know do it's not a matter there's only one thing that you cannot wear it says so these you wanna say I've seen that this is a lot of faith this is a supernatural cockamamie and look at watch watch Howard Elijah progresses people top their be with my service fifty strong men because all of a sudden these these people that have recognized what God does you see they were starting to recognize better day and its message that's what it's all about this is all the progressive revelation and when God you know moves along he gets a hold of your life there's individuals that you're gonna cross paths might be one of those whose names was written in the Lamb's Book of Life at that point give it a speak a certain sentence and you're gonna think oh boy you know God's endtime prophecies Almighty God the revelations of God of the supernatural do you think that's good and something spoke to something inside we needed that wouldn't that cost me to respond with a certain way that I have never recognized or realized until it got hold of me and it's not so much what who's speaking [Music] and that changes all things that can change your whole circumstance in your own experience you receive this revelation [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that's why [Music] and there ain't no tellin how that can touch you how no leader didn't but he goes up he says so now I've got these 50 strong men let them go we appreciated seed my master less pre adventure the Spirit of the Lord had taken and cast it upon some know there's people still looking for brother brother still underrated right he's going to raise up he said don't go I'm telling you don't go there you don't need to go there you don't need to be looking for her attempt revival vision or anything come of the second calculon brother brandon where do the meet brother brandon again it's gonna be the first because they without us can only make perfect movies we would survive and remain shall be caught up together to be the Lord that's gonna be the next [Music] forward and so let's read on when they urged him till he was a shady said seven and they said the fifty minute of me Italy he just got to know just let him go don't get caught up in any of the doctrines this is the tousle the seventh under the this that God isn't the perfect 700 word of God that's being released through smoking of the seven seals that's where he is he's he's now speaking and talking those nations that were after that seventh seal that's where he is now he's right now that's where he is in the five fold ministry was speaking and calling and placing all this individual sons and daughters of God and the over that's happening right at your local church amen right at your local church and he said bring me a new crew stand back here and then when they urge duplicate when they came again to him for you Terry the terrible he said did I not say dodo and the men of the city seven time I shot the whole that created the situation of the city is pleasant as my lord see it but the water is not and the preppin barren and he said bring me into approves and put salt there live and they brought a tab and he led forth unto the spread of the waters and cast the salt in there and said thus see here I have healed these waters there shall not be from death any more death or barren land so the lovers were healed unto this day according to the same of a mashup which he said he was moving into his ministry he was moving into his ministry where he now is the carrier of the prophetic word of God [Music] we recognize we see we heard she's a type of the bride she's the female aspect of Christ in this demonstrates the power of the spoken word to heal to heal the better lives in other words he spoke prosperity into the city and we've got that same ability that lives and blows in us that we could speak prosperity into our homes into our families into our situations we know he was demonstrating that with the right character things notice because this is important for us to recognize - you are a carrier of Living Word of God and sometimes you find yourself getting frustrated if by yourself getting into situations you know like to insult Anika you know he got like personally attacked he lashed out he didn't say that was now that it worked to show that there's a purpose in yeah it's going to show us that as sons and daughters of God does looking for us to have the right character that were not angered and we're not to be controlled by my spirit that's why Jesus said love your enemies you know he's talking to a friend of mine you know because you know he was upset because certain deal people have done in a certain way they were they were not being very honest about situations the way he was getting upset I said I said well we're fighting evil I said things have a way of working themselves up you know I believe [Music] I want to say I say exactly what I could deserve the spirit was a little bit different and most active in the same way and so but you see with a revelation we understand the power that base within us end up at the responsibility that God has given us as sons and daughters head so that we can weaken because sometimes we can make a mess of things your to say it will never not be a son or daughter of God if you learn it can never change but you can do things that sometimes will bring about not good situations you know the law of sowing and reaping and everything else right and there is power in it words you know that you speak to somebody and you say something to them and you just sing in the wrong way that anger and it's not being done right it can hurt the person it could scar the person it can cause the vision it can do things that get you got what you needed so you want to be careful in the way
