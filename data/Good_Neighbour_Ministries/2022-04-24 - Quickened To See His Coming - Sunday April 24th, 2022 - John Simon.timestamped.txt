[32:07] matthew
[32:08] chapter 24 reading from verse 36 to 51

[32:16] give us
[32:17] some foundations and background
[32:20] for the word of god
[32:23] amen
[32:25] hallelujah
[32:26] brother tim can you come up here and

[33:08] and hour knoweth no man
[33:11] no not the angels of heaven
[33:14] but my father only
[33:16] but as
[33:17] the days of noah
[33:19] were so
[33:21] shall also the the coming of the son of
[33:24] man be
[33:26] for as in the days that were before the
[33:28] flood they were eating drinking marion
[33:32] and given in marriage
[33:34] until the day that noe
[33:36] entered into the ark
[33:39] and knew not until the flood came and
[33:43] took them all away
[33:45] so shall also the coming of the son of
[33:48] man be
[33:50] then shall two be in the field
[33:53] and one shall be taken and the other
[33:56] left
[33:57] two woman shall be grinding at the mill
[34:01] and one shall be taken
[34:03] and the other left

[34:12] hallelujah brother gabriel would you
[34:14] come read the rest of it thank you
[34:16] brother temple praise the
[34:18] lord reading from this verse thank you
[34:21] jesus
[34:23] but
[34:24] note this
[34:25] that if the good man of the house
[34:29] had known in what
[34:31] watch
[34:32] the thief that will come
[34:35] he will have watched
[34:37] and will not have suffered
[34:40] his house to be broken up
[34:43] therefore be also ready for in as
[34:47] an hour as he think not the son of man
[34:51] cometh
[34:52] who then is a faithful and wise servant
[34:56] whom his lord had made the ruler of his
[34:59] household
[35:00] to give them meat in due season
[35:03] blessed is the servant who is lord when
[35:06] he cometh
[35:08] shall find so doing thank you jesus
[35:12] praise god hallelujah
[35:14] let us pray gracious heavenly father
[35:18] we thank thee so much
[35:20] for the reading of the word
[35:22] and we ask your divine blessing upon us
[35:25] as we consider these things
[35:28] for your glory and honor we ask it
[35:31] amen
[35:32] god bless you
[35:34] please be seated and i continue the rest
[35:36] of that scripture
[35:39] verily
[35:40] i say unto you
[35:42] that you sh he shall make him ruler over
[35:47] all of his word all of his goods
[35:51] but if that evil servant shall say in
[35:55] his heart
[35:56] my lord delayed his coming
[35:58] and shall begin to smite his fellow
[36:01] servants
[36:02] and to eat and drink with the drunken
[36:07] the lord of that servant shall come
[36:10] in a day when he looketh not
[36:13] for him
[36:16] and in an hour that he is not aware of
[36:21] and shall cut him asunder
[36:23] and appoint him his portion with the
[36:26] hypocrites
[36:27] there shall be weeping
[36:30] wailing and gnashing of teeth weeping
[36:32] and gnashing of teeth amen god bless
[36:36] that word to our hearts
[36:38] now if you'll notice in this scripture
[36:41] i'm speaking on the topic of
[36:43] quickened
[36:44] to see
[36:46] his coming
[36:49] now jesus
[36:51] did not say we will not know the year
[36:55] nor the month
[36:57] nor the week
[36:58] but he says no man know it the hour
[37:03] in which the son of man
[37:05] comes
[37:07] and i'm saying to you here by the word
[37:09] of god
[37:11] uh we are in the season
[37:14] and we are quickened to see
[37:16] recognize be aware
[37:19] and sensitive to the season in which we
[37:22] are living
[37:25] the same quickening power from the
[37:27] rising of the sun
[37:29] of god present was represented as we
[37:32] spoke on last week and both of these
[37:34] prophets of elijah and elisha
[37:38] amen
[37:40] one representing
[37:42] the
[37:43] dead
[37:44] that dies and sleeps in the grave
[37:48] and the other representing
[37:50] the living saints
[37:52] that are caught up
[37:54] in the presence of the living god
[37:57] these are the two wings of the old and
[37:59] new testament
[38:01] and of course they also represent
[38:05] the
[38:06] the church
[38:07] of this last day
[38:10] the living saints and the dead saints of
[38:12] the church
[38:14] of this day
[38:15] and
[38:16] this is what i want you to see
[38:19] praise god and i want you to know as the
[38:22] scripture said the prophet says here
[38:24] that the quickening power
[38:26] that was back there still lives today do
[38:30] you believe that
[38:32] now remember now
[38:35] he says remember he repeats remember now
[38:38] remember
[38:40] you are quickened to see these
[38:44] things amen
[38:47] these things that are in other words are
[38:50] going on right now you're quickened to
[38:53] see and that's where the thought comes
[38:55] from
[38:56] god's holy spirit
[38:59] has quickened us to see these things
[39:03] now
[39:04] watch the quickening power
[39:06] but watch it
[39:08] for this day
[39:11] what is the action of that quickening
[39:13] power
[39:14] what does it do
[39:16] what is it supposed to accomplish
[39:19] in this day
[39:21] in which we are living and remember he
[39:25] says
[39:26] we are quickened
[39:28] by that spirit hallelujah praise the
[39:31] lord
[39:32] now
[39:33] you know under
[39:35] the first and second polls
[39:38] the
[39:39] anointing the holy ghost
[39:41] the quickening power came upon them
[39:45] and they're quickened by the holy ghost
[39:48] to heal the sick
[39:50] they were quickened to cast out devils
[39:54] they were quicker than my friends to
[39:56] even see visions
[39:59] and dreams and all these things
[40:01] quickened to even raise the dead
[40:05] many men were so anointed that god used
[40:09] them to raise the dead manifest great
[40:13] gifts and great works
[40:16] but under the third pull now
[40:20] when they are looking for greater works
[40:24] we are quickened to see
[40:28] the world making itself manifestated
[40:32] manifest manifested
[40:35] and
[40:37] the interpretation
[40:41] of god in this hour
[40:44] praise be to god
[40:46] because uh
[40:48] this is how the prophet says it back
[40:50] there but you gotta understand what he's
[40:52] saying he says when god said let there
[40:55] be light
[40:57] and the light appeared that was the
[40:59] interpretation
[41:01] hallelujah now he's just talking about
[41:04] that but he's left it to you now to see
[41:06] at evening time it shall be light again
[41:10] praise god and the manifestation
[41:14] is the interpretation for the hour
[41:17] praise be to god think
[41:20] of our lord what he said
[41:23] then think of paul of what he said
[41:26] what the father showed me
[41:28] i held nothing back
[41:31] and in these last days
[41:33] when we
[41:35] see
[41:36] the quickening power upon us
[41:39] he even gave them power to see the sick
[41:43] heel
[41:44] to seeing the quickening power working
[41:46] amongst them like it was them
[41:49] to bring visions to raise the dead to
[41:53] make the sick well you see that
[41:57] quickening power but it comes now to
[41:59] make you
[42:00] see hallelujah all the other things are
[42:04] going to take place
[42:05] but first of all you it comes to make
[42:08] you see the coming of the lord
[42:12] amen
[42:14] now just before going further you know
[42:18] we will see his coming
[42:20] but many who are expecting him what she
[42:24] is coming
[42:25] just like it was at his first coming
[42:28] the rabbis that all the wise men they
[42:31] were watching waiting for his coming
[42:34] but yet when he came only elected
[42:38] pre-destinated group were allowed to
[42:41] really recognize
[42:43] see and understand the coming of the
[42:46] lord
[42:47] oh hallelujah
[42:49] now
[42:50] o praise god now you see
[42:54] john the revelator was so filled
[42:58] with the quickening power remember john
[43:00] takes the bride
[43:02] that
[43:03] he when he stood up there he was
[43:06] anointed to see
[43:09] the very
[43:10] end from the beginning
[43:13] or in other words from beginning to end
[43:16] praise god and so
[43:18] john being a type of the bride that same
[43:21] quickening power comes upon the bride
[43:24] then she also
[43:26] is anointed to see the word running from
[43:30] beyond the foundations right back
[43:33] through the bible right back through
[43:35] time right back into eternity by the
[43:39] quickening power of the holy spirit

[56:25] big person
[56:27] can you say amen
[56:29] we don't care what these people say
[56:31] about us
[56:33] our name

[56:40] there is thousands of johns in this
[56:41] world so

[56:45] mr so-and-so mr so-and-so
[56:48] you know that's just a human pomposity
[56:51] you see it's not our life
[56:54] and it's not our name this is not about
[56:57] our name or about our life our life is
[57:00] just a messed up bunch of everything
[57:02] else that he had to wash and clean by
[57:04] his blood our name don't mean nothing
[57:06] it's his name
[57:08] it's his life
[57:10] his life in us makes the difference it's
[57:12] his power amen this only thing we want
[57:17] and we love to do
[57:21] is to see him
[57:23] glorified amen it's not what you love to
[57:26] do
[57:27] is not what you want to see through your
[57:29] life
[57:30] oh praise god how can it be
[57:32] you see he is being glorified in us now
[57:38] by his presence by his resurrection
[57:42] that is in us i i i i spoke how i was
[57:47] thinking but the words here are he is
[57:50] glorified in us
[57:52] by his resurrection
[57:54] that is in us amen praise god so that
[57:58] resurrection in us glorifies him praise
[58:03] god see
[58:04] he is represented again
[58:08] as he was
[58:10] he is represented today
[58:12] but not in the
[58:13] one
[58:15] member body the headship he is
[58:18] represented again
[58:20] son of man then and son of man are real
[58:22] again as we have said over and over but
[58:24] now in the form of a bride and they are
[58:27] missing it
[58:29] because through tradition they're
[58:31] looking back and looking for that one
[58:34] back there
[58:35] but that was only the manifestation of
[58:38] the head while we were stealing him
[58:41] but he's paid the price of our
[58:42] redemption
[58:44] christ eternal has released us from his
[58:47] side as much as eve came from adam's
[58:50] side and our souls are here represented
[58:53] in human bodies
[58:55] eternity trapped in time
[58:58] until the spirit of the living god sets
[59:00] you free from this prison house that
[59:03] we're living in
[59:04] oh praise god forevermore hallelujah oh
[59:09] my see did you get that
[59:11] our desire is not to be glorified can
[59:14] you say amen
[59:16] i want you to get you to uh agree with
[59:19] that that's being said that you don't
[59:23] want to be seen you don't you want him
[59:26] to be glorified
[59:28] because you realize that you are nothing
[59:31] you are only a predestinated prepared
[59:34] vessel from the for the foundation of
[59:37] the world
[59:38] that the quickening power could come to
[59:40] in this age and use for this age to
[59:44] display himself
[59:46] to manifest himself his word
[59:50] and the manifestation is the
[59:52] interpretation
[59:53] [Music]
[59:54] you see
[59:56] that is why our desire is not to be here
[1:00:00] to boost up some church
[1:00:03] you see
[1:00:05] we are not here just to make some great
[1:00:08] big sunday school

[1:00:12] our purpose here amen we are not here
[1:00:16] trying to bring
[1:00:18] thousands in
[1:00:21] or to do it
[1:00:22] by tying them
[1:00:25] bringing them in
[1:00:27] or to push them in
[1:00:29] we are not here to offer them uh you
[1:00:33] know picnic parties you're attracting
[1:00:36] them by picnic parties rather than what
[1:00:39] is the attraction on the mountain amen
[1:00:42] or to bring them in by bringing stars
[1:00:47] amen giving them a badge with a star on
[1:00:50] it that's one and bringing in
[1:00:53] high credibility people in this world
[1:00:57] bring in the mayor bringing the this the
[1:00:59] governor the president bringing
[1:01:01] this great star in hollywood and bring
[1:01:04] them in for the attraction amen some
[1:01:07] football player or something else like
[1:01:09] the other right praise god you see or
[1:01:13] something else like that give them some
[1:01:16] kind of button or whatever it's not how

[1:01:26] hallelujah
[1:01:27] not with self-pride
[1:01:30] but in us
[1:01:32] in our lives
[1:01:34] every day
[1:01:35] to prove he's not dead but he is alive
[1:01:39] and now living in us
[1:01:42] praise god hallelujah oh blessed be the
[1:01:46] name of the lord oh he says don't you
[1:01:49] see that's why i say if i can get myself
[1:01:53] out of the way
[1:01:55] where the people
[1:01:57] cannot
[1:01:59] when william branham the people
[1:02:02] cannot think of him
[1:02:05] or he isn't sought off anymore
[1:02:09] amen i want to get myself out of the way
[1:02:13] that you
[1:02:15] not even thought of till we can see
[1:02:18] jesus glorified among us you see and he
[1:02:21] repeats i want you to see him
[1:02:25] recognize him
[1:02:27] not me
[1:02:28] not william branham you know he's a
[1:02:31] prophet you know god sent him to the
[1:02:33] 20th century but it's not me i want you
[1:02:35] to recognize i want you to recognize him
[1:02:39] praise be to god that's our desire
[1:02:43] that gives us the quick new power that

[1:02:59] hallelujah the two shall be what
[1:03:02] flesh your flesh bone of bone praise god
[1:03:05] he's just referring to
[1:03:06] you gonna you're natural but your soul
[1:03:09] is word of word
[1:03:11] and your flesh
[1:03:13] you know your flesh now you're his flesh
[1:03:15] now that he's able to operate through
[1:03:18] even you don't have to think about that
[1:03:20] because he's going to do it it's not you
[1:03:23] going around trying to be a christian or
[1:03:25] trying to manifest christ i'm going to
[1:03:27] be perfect like jesus i'm gonna do no
[1:03:30] you of course want to do that but you
[1:03:33] realize that does not lie in you he has
[1:03:37] to do it through you amen and that's why
[1:03:40] i say in a natural way brethren all we
[1:03:43] have to be like brother branham said it
[1:03:45] too he says just go out and be a
[1:03:47] christian
[1:03:48] just just live your normal life he says
[1:03:51] be humble be sincere be reverent and god
[1:03:55] will bless you
[1:03:57] he'll just work through you even when
[1:03:58] you're not thinking about it god's
[1:04:00] spirit will work through you
[1:04:03] hallelujah being the bride of christ
[1:04:06] seeing those same vindicated methods
[1:04:10] and by that proving in us
[1:04:13] that he is now risen from the dead
[1:04:18] by his action in you and through you he
[1:04:21] has proven to the world he's not dead
[1:04:23] i'm alive because look i'm hearing this
[1:04:25] man look i'm in here not woman look i'm
[1:04:28] in here over there in that child look
[1:04:30] i'm here there he's proving to them
[1:04:32] hallelujah oh praise god so we are flesh
[1:04:36] of his flesh for him to use
[1:04:38] and manifest himself true you see
[1:04:42] god is his own interpreter
[1:04:45] you say brother simon is a wonderful
[1:04:47] coach you know you should give me every
[1:04:49] quote where you got it from and this and
[1:04:50] that
[1:04:51] well i'm preaching to believers
[1:04:55] and when you're speaking to believers
[1:04:57] you don't have to prove every sentence
[1:04:59] you say
[1:05:01] because they're part of the same truth
[1:05:04] is that right yes
[1:05:06] you don't have to prove it you see and
[1:05:08] not only that not only are they
[1:05:10] believers and you don't have to actually
[1:05:11] prove it but also i'm no more feeding
[1:05:14] babies
[1:05:17] that i have to give you
[1:05:18] every chapter force
[1:05:22] so that you know exactly where it's
[1:05:24] coming from is that in the bible is that
[1:05:26] in the uh is that brother bran said that
[1:05:28] this is that over here is that over
[1:05:30] there i'm not feeding babies
[1:05:33] is that right
[1:05:34] so when i say something when it catches
[1:05:37] your thought your heart then you go find
[1:05:40] that food
[1:05:41] because there's spiritual food that's
[1:05:43] been provided for you in your season
[1:05:46] there's food in the storehouse
[1:05:49] for you to find praise god
[1:05:51] but no the days are gone for man or papa
[1:05:54] to break the spoon with the food and
[1:05:57] open your mouth and then they're gonna
[1:05:59] put it in and they say hallelujah amen
[1:06:02] praise god no no no that time has passed
[1:06:05] this is no spoon feeding time this is
[1:06:07] for you now like a little eagle you
[1:06:10] swoop him down to pick up your fresh
[1:06:13] meat of the word of god hallelujah fresh
[1:06:17] kill for the day under the quick new
[1:06:19] power and inspiration of the holy spirit
[1:06:22] praise peter god hallelujah
[1:06:25] amen you see
[1:06:28] god is his own interpreter
[1:06:30] and back in the beginning
[1:06:33] when he said let there be light there
[1:06:36] was light
[1:06:37] and that light was the interpretation of
[1:06:40] his word
[1:06:41] and when god does that in any age any
[1:06:44] time and it's manifested
[1:06:46] you see the manifestation is god's
[1:06:49] interpretation of his word
[1:06:53] when he said let there be light that
[1:06:56] light had to be in his thinking
[1:06:58] before light could spring up into the
[1:07:01] skies
[1:07:02] see and when it did come forth that's
[1:07:06] the interpretation of his thinking that
[1:07:08] was back there praise god hallelujah
[1:07:12] nobody has to interpret that for him
[1:07:16] god said it and when he speaks
[1:07:19] and what he speaks
[1:07:21] is manifested
[1:07:23] then that is the interpretation of his
[1:07:27] word hallelujah see oh my my god don't
[1:07:32] you understand
[1:07:33] in the beginning that happened in
[1:07:35] genesis
[1:07:36] but he also allotted his word to each
[1:07:41] age right from the beginning right to
[1:07:43] the end amen
[1:07:45] amen in other words he said let there be
[1:07:47] light in every age whether it be on the
[1:07:49] luther justification that was the light
[1:07:51] for that day but that was just the sun
[1:07:53] coming up in the morning and then let
[1:07:55] there be light in the next age the sun
[1:07:57] get a little brighter
[1:07:58] every light then it's getting brighter
[1:08:00] and then at evening time it shall be
[1:08:03] light again oh praise peter god and the
[1:08:06] manifestation when the prophet said
[1:08:08] don't you understand it the evening
[1:08:11] lights have come it is a fact that god
[1:08:14] and christ are one in other words he
[1:08:16] started to see some people catching the
[1:08:18] word
[1:08:20] amen god and christ are one hallelujah
[1:08:24] oh blessed be the name of the lord amen
[1:08:27] just a moment praise god hallelujah
[1:08:29] thank you lord jesus how wonderful to
[1:08:32] know friends that he's the same
[1:08:35] yesterday
[1:08:36] today and forever
[1:08:39] hallelujah oh praise god it is god
[1:08:43] himself
[1:08:45] doing his own interpretation
[1:08:49] right god and you and me doing his own
[1:08:53] interpretation
[1:08:54] every verse of the scripture whether it
[1:08:56] be what is faith what is patience what
[1:08:59] is love what is this
[1:09:01] you see but they are thinking they might
[1:09:03] even think something wrong with you
[1:09:05] because they don't know what really is
[1:09:06] love
[1:09:08] so
[1:09:09] when the spirit manifests love through
[1:09:11] you they might think it's it's even
[1:09:13] hatred they might even think it's crazy
[1:09:16] you might think it's nonsense when they
[1:09:18] see patients they said oh this guy
[1:09:20] something is wrong with him when they
[1:09:21] see those virtues they see it from the
[1:09:24] human standpoint of how human beings
[1:09:27] will approach that or what they think it
[1:09:29] is but when it is interpreted through
[1:09:32] you sometimes it surprises you yourself
[1:09:36] hallelujah because god is doing his own
[1:09:39] interpretation and he don't need no
[1:09:42] anybody to interpret it for him he
[1:09:45] interprets himself by manifesting what
[1:09:49] he promised that he would do for when he
[1:09:53] said from isaiah a virgin shall conceive
[1:09:57] hallelujah and i've said it to you
[1:09:59] before i say it again the moment he said
[1:10:02] let every light
[1:10:04] said he he already saw that light it was
[1:10:06] in his thinking
[1:10:09] a virgin will conceive
[1:10:11] that virgin wasn't mistaken
[1:10:14] he knew exactly which one in the
[1:10:16] billions that were gonna comport this
[1:10:19] one he knew already wasn't mistaken
[1:10:22] when he says and i generally use this
[1:10:24] term i use a general term when he says
[1:10:27] there gonna be a bride in the last day
[1:10:29] son of man will be revealed in the last
[1:10:31] day there's gonna appear people in the
[1:10:33] last day then he had to have the thought
[1:10:35] back in his mind
[1:10:38] what is going on now is the
[1:10:39] manifestation of those thoughts
[1:10:42] and the manifestation of those thoughts
[1:10:45] is the word interpreting its own self
[1:10:48] through you and me
[1:10:51] flesh of his flesh and bone of his bones
[1:10:54] hallelujah amen you see oh my they
[1:10:58] didn't think it but god said it and she
[1:11:01] did it
[1:11:02] praise god who the believer virgins can
[1:11:05] bring for the child
[1:11:07] but god said it
[1:11:09] and he said when god said it
[1:11:11] she just did it
[1:11:13] hallelujah you see but when she did it
[1:11:17] the church of that day was too blind to
[1:11:20] see it
[1:11:22] see
[1:11:22] and they were blind be they couldn't see
[1:11:26] because they had their own ideas
[1:11:29] see
[1:11:30] they had a different it come a different
[1:11:33] way than what they were expecting and
[1:11:37] this is what blinds the people today
[1:11:39] when you talk about the resurrection you
[1:11:41] see
[1:11:44] their thoughts are
[1:11:46] um
[1:11:48] like sunglasses
[1:11:50] if your glasses is clear you're seeing
[1:11:52] clearly but then if they put some
[1:11:55] nice glaze and tell you it will keep the
[1:11:58] sun out of your eyes and so on and you
[1:12:01] put on the darkness on the shades right
[1:12:04] like that
[1:12:06] then you can't see and the darker they
[1:12:08] make it you can't see true at all and so
[1:12:10] they put so much uh
[1:12:12] ideas in the thoughts of the people that
[1:12:15] they're thinking
[1:12:17] of of what the word should say
[1:12:20] is being colored by these years of
[1:12:23] theology
[1:12:25] uh church systems and what they taught
[1:12:28] you and what they tell you
[1:12:30] what you accepted the ideas that you
[1:12:32] tried to live by and so on like that
[1:12:36] we've been colored by it
[1:12:38] is that right
[1:12:40] praise god like
[1:12:42] you know one time i had to tell somebody
[1:12:44] after i made a mistake
[1:12:46] and i said to this
[1:12:48] person i said i said uh uh you
[1:12:51] understand and this was actually the the
[1:12:53] um
[1:12:55] the superintendent
[1:12:57] of uh south america there of the whole
[1:13:00] assembly of god and we were talking or
[1:13:03] something like that and i said something
[1:13:04] to him and i said oh i'm sorry i
[1:13:06] shouldn't have said that you see
[1:13:08] i i am influenced i'm still influenced
[1:13:13] by the environment that i've lived in
[1:13:17] and on and the way
[1:13:19] what i'm coming out of
[1:13:21] i still have some of that influence on
[1:13:23] me
[1:13:24] so i said have patience with me the lord
[1:13:26] is still working and he's going to take
[1:13:29] all of those things off
[1:13:31] and there's nothing one of us is not in
[1:13:32] that condition here right now the holy
[1:13:35] spirit has to continue to work on us the
[1:13:38] quickening power of the living god has
[1:13:41] to swirl around this place into every
[1:13:44] life every cranny every crook of every
[1:13:46] heart
[1:13:47] uncleanness by the holy spirit that's
[1:13:50] not the work of man that's the work of a
[1:13:52] psychiatrist that's not the work of a
[1:13:55] preacher man that's the work of the holy
[1:13:57] ghost himself
[1:13:59] it's between you and god
[1:14:01] between me and god
[1:14:02] in the little chamber of the heart the
[1:14:04] little room that's where he meets you
[1:14:06] and you have a conference with him and
[1:14:09] he cleans us up every day praise god by
[1:14:11] divine grace amen praise god you see
[1:14:15] you understand now
[1:14:18] the edition church age why jesus said
[1:14:21] jesus did not say no man would know the
[1:14:25] year
[1:14:27] no man would know the month or even the
[1:14:29] week in which his coming was to be
[1:14:33] completed
[1:14:35] i want to understand that what i was
[1:14:37] teaching on you before that the coming
[1:14:40] started from the time that he come on
[1:14:42] the earth that was the beginning of his
[1:14:44] comment
[1:14:44] right that was his coming because he
[1:14:47] expected messiah to come jesus to come
[1:14:50] emmanuel to come and he came
[1:14:53] that was just the beginning of his
[1:14:54] comment and he's been coming down
[1:14:57] through the ages that's the
[1:14:58] condescension
[1:15:00] right that's the condescension coming
[1:15:02] down to us till this last age see
[1:15:06] my but now
[1:15:08] he's coming to be completed
[1:15:12] praise god so here
[1:15:14] he doesn't explain it but he's letting
[1:15:16] you know it's a whole process going on
[1:15:18] and then the thing is going to come to
[1:15:19] an end right it's going to be completed
[1:15:22] the edition church age and so he comes
[1:15:25] first you know when he comes to redeem
[1:15:28] his bride
[1:15:31] he comes second
[1:15:32] as a rapture to take his bride
[1:15:36] he comes third with his bride as king
[1:15:40] and queen with her
[1:15:42] amen oh my oh that's what many but you
[1:15:47] see that coming is what many people are
[1:15:50] expecting to be the coming of the lord
[1:15:54] when the real comment already took place
[1:15:58] and he's coming back now with her
[1:16:02] that is what they're looking for
[1:16:04] as the coming of the lord
[1:16:06] listen i think as i go on here praise
[1:16:09] god i'm preaching and at the same time
[1:16:11] i'm teaching you understand that's why
[1:16:13] i'm speeding up and then you finally
[1:16:14] slow down
[1:16:16] at the same time now
[1:16:18] you see that's what many people are
[1:16:21] expecting to be the coming of the lord
[1:16:23] but when he comes this time
[1:16:28] hardly none
[1:16:30] but those who are
[1:16:32] ready will even know when he comes
[1:16:38] they'll just be be an actions of the
[1:16:41] people
[1:16:42] they wouldn't know
[1:16:44] what even happened to them
[1:16:47] they'll just be
[1:16:48] caught away
[1:16:51] in a moment
[1:16:53] that they just come up
[1:16:56] missing
[1:16:57] in the rest of the world
[1:17:00] they themselves
[1:17:01] don't even know what happened
[1:17:04] but in a moment
[1:17:06] they are just
[1:17:08] caught up
[1:17:09] and come up
[1:17:11] missing
[1:17:12] changed in a moment
[1:17:14] in the crinkling of an eye
[1:17:17] oh my
[1:17:18] you see a misinterpretation again
[1:17:21] denominational misinterpretation of that
[1:17:23] change in the moment twinkling and i
[1:17:25] they don't understand that by time that
[1:17:27] happens you can't get in it anymore it's
[1:17:30] over it's done it's gone amen you see so
[1:17:34] just be ready for that
[1:17:37] amen
[1:17:38] oh my some morning
[1:17:41] oh yes
[1:17:42] you'll be gone
[1:17:44] and no one can find them
[1:17:47] wouldn't be too bad
[1:17:49] to know
[1:17:50] it wouldn't it would be so bad to know
[1:17:53] it's done past
[1:17:55] and you missed it
[1:17:59] at this very moment in which we are
[1:18:01] living
[1:18:02] we are in the completion
[1:18:05] of the fulfillment of matthew 24
[1:18:10] 24 praise god bear with me here today by
[1:18:13] the grace of god
[1:18:16] and so much as it were possible they
[1:18:18] were deceived very elected
[1:18:21] who is it
[1:18:22] in this day
[1:18:23] would attempt to deceive the very elect
[1:18:28] you see it's the same spirit of the
[1:18:30] antichrist right through the ages what
[1:18:33] do you think else you're going to be
[1:18:34] facing in this age right
[1:18:36] in
[1:18:38] working through in
[1:18:41] the false anointed ones of this last day
[1:18:47] those false ones
[1:18:49] they come also claiming in jesus name
[1:18:55] see
[1:18:56] claiming that they too have been
[1:19:00] anointed of god for these last days
[1:19:04] they are
[1:19:05] the faults of messiahs
[1:19:08] false messiahs they claim their two are
[1:19:12] prophets
[1:19:15] but
[1:19:16] are but are they one with the word
[1:19:21] are you going to be claimed to be a
[1:19:22] prophet and you're not one with the word
[1:19:26] for my the the prophet is the word of
[1:19:30] god to his generation
[1:19:32] praise god personified of course praise
[1:19:35] the lord oh my
[1:19:37] now
[1:19:38] and they claim to be a prophet yet
[1:19:40] adding to it or taking away from it
[1:19:44] no one denies the spirit of god is
[1:19:47] manifesting upon them in gifts
[1:19:51] surely amen
[1:19:53] but it's the same spirit that was back
[1:19:56] there like upon balaam
[1:19:59] having all their programs
[1:20:02] making all appeals for money
[1:20:06] can you say amen to that
[1:20:08] is that going on in our day
[1:20:11] exercising gifts
[1:20:14] but denying the word
[1:20:16] or bypass it for fear that they may
[1:20:19] cause some controversy that controversy
[1:20:22] that might diminish their chances for
[1:20:26] greater gain and glory
[1:20:30] is that right
[1:20:31] oh my yet they are preaching salvation
[1:20:35] yet they are preaching deliverance
[1:20:37] through the power of god
[1:20:39] just like judas did
[1:20:43] he said
[1:20:44] even with a ministry
[1:20:46] that was imparted by christ
[1:20:50] but because we see
[1:20:53] he had the wrong seed
[1:20:56] wrong seed to begin with so what else
[1:20:58] are you going to be producing how can
[1:21:00] you that's why he said don't you
[1:21:02] understand every seed must bring forth
[1:21:05] after its kind
[1:21:07] oh glory to god he says you can't be
[1:21:10] if the seed is supposed to produce an
[1:21:12] orange branch
[1:21:14] you can't have it suddenly producing
[1:21:16] lemons
[1:21:17] though coming from the same tree and
[1:21:20] claiming oh i'm from the same tree no
[1:21:23] you are not the original branch praise
[1:21:28] god but he's saying god has his original
[1:21:30] branch praise god amen
[1:21:34] yes sir they have the wrong spirit wrong
[1:21:37] seed
[1:21:39] wrong spirit motivating and moving them
[1:21:42] making them religious
[1:21:46] they're religious
[1:21:48] they're in the church
[1:21:50] they're in your midst
[1:21:51] like judas was with even jesus not that
[1:21:54] jesus was deceived not that jesus
[1:21:56] couldn't see it but he left him alone
[1:21:58] you don't tear up the tears like that
[1:22:01] well unless there's a purpose and a
[1:22:02] reason for it but you need to recognize
[1:22:05] so that you can fortify protect yourself
[1:22:09] and not be caught up with a naive
[1:22:11] so-called
[1:22:13] a christian belief of the holy spirit in
[1:22:16] you god these spirits come around you
[1:22:19] and try to
[1:22:21] wrap you up in the coils of their
[1:22:23] of their argumentation
[1:22:26] and say oh
[1:22:27] you know i'm so needy i got this problem
[1:22:31] and you by the way they might say plain
[1:22:33] like i'm saying maybe you got six
[1:22:35] blankets and i don't have none look how
[1:22:38] i'm shivering in the cold and you're
[1:22:40] supposed to have love
[1:22:42] you see
[1:22:43] the argument's so deceiving
[1:22:45] that if you're not watching you'll be
[1:22:48] caught up with human
[1:22:50] sympathy and not led by the real love of
[1:22:54] god
[1:22:56] and the holy spirit working in and
[1:22:58] through you and you don't let that
[1:23:00] happen to you even when i'm on the
[1:23:02] street and there is people begging at
[1:23:03] every street corner right
[1:23:06] there could be a hundred beggars i
[1:23:08] passed but do i go on uh and give them
[1:23:11] all money as i'm going out the lord said
[1:23:13] to give so therefore i give all of them
[1:23:15] money oh oh this money might have a
[1:23:17] bible while he's begging so i'll give
[1:23:19] him more no no no no no
[1:23:22] only if all of a sudden some this the
[1:23:25] holy spirit strikes me and said
[1:23:27] now give that one
[1:23:29] give this one
[1:23:30] it's only then other than that i'm going
[1:23:32] my way jesus said it's so plain he says
[1:23:35] were there not so many lepers in israel
[1:23:37] i mean
[1:23:38] elijah go out and heal everyone no he
[1:23:41] only gave and delivered those ones god
[1:23:44] gave him he said who do you think i come
[1:23:46] to i just come for everybody i came to
[1:23:49] the lost sheep of the house of israel
[1:23:53] a comforting elect hallelujah praise god
[1:23:57] hallelujah whosoever will
[1:23:59] may
[1:24:00] come you may come it's all right to come
[1:24:04] nothing's wrong with that at least
[1:24:05] you'll be a better person but i come for
[1:24:07] the elected seed of the living god
[1:24:10] hallelujah amen yes sir you see
[1:24:14] wrong spirit is motivating them
[1:24:17] and they'll even outshine the elect
[1:24:22] in all their efforts
[1:24:24] and with all their zeal
[1:24:27] you know in another message he said that
[1:24:30] he said don't you understand they're
[1:24:31] gonna elect they're gonna outshine you
[1:24:34] don't even try to don't even try you
[1:24:37] said because a mule will always outwork
[1:24:40] a horse
[1:24:41] is that right
[1:24:43] if they don't have nothing else
[1:24:46] we got heaven to gain they ain't got
[1:24:48] nothing else so they got to work work
[1:24:51] work they didn't even work this work
[1:24:53] that and and it's great it's wonderful
[1:24:55] they're building hospitals they're
[1:24:56] building universities they're building
[1:24:58] great things great they're helping the
[1:25:00] poor they're feeding thousands millions
[1:25:02] good it's wonderful and we even want to
[1:25:05] help them do those kinds of things but
[1:25:07] we know exactly the difference right
[1:25:10] there and then amen
[1:25:12] hallelujah oh my they're allowed shiny
[1:25:16] left in their zeal and in their efforts
[1:25:19] but it is all
[1:25:20] of the ledesian spirit
[1:25:24] it is not of christ
[1:25:26] for that spirit looks for big crowds
[1:25:30] always looking for big crowds big
[1:25:33] programs and
[1:25:36] their desire to see stackling signs
[1:25:39] taking place amongst them
[1:25:42] they preach about the second coming of
[1:25:44] christ
[1:25:46] and
[1:25:47] turn around and deny
[1:25:50] the advent
[1:25:52] of the prophet messenger
[1:25:54] of this age
[1:25:56] they don't realize that what was a sign
[1:26:01] that being the wave chief was assigned
[1:26:04] to the rest
[1:26:05] of the elect
[1:26:08] that he had come down
[1:26:11] christ had come down
[1:26:13] the seals were open
[1:26:15] and now here he is among us
[1:26:18] interpreting his own word
[1:26:20] and making himself plain to us do you
[1:26:23] get it
[1:26:25] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:26:27] oh my he said even though through him
[1:26:32] in power and in signs and in revelation
[1:26:35] eclipses them all
[1:26:38] ah
[1:26:39] yes
[1:26:41] even though that this false spirit in
[1:26:45] this last day is so close to the real
[1:26:49] can be distinguished only by its
[1:26:52] deviation from the word outwardly they
[1:26:55] look just like you amen everything
[1:26:57] religious everything sometimes he said
[1:26:59] the lord do you look more holier than
[1:27:01] you and perfect and walking in the
[1:27:03] walking in the bible better than you
[1:27:05] memorize it better than you know the
[1:27:07] quotes nor the scripture better than you
[1:27:09] he says i'll do you at every turn
[1:27:11] hallelujah but watch he said they can do
[1:27:15] all that and they're so evening you
[1:27:17] might not pick it up but how you pick it
[1:27:19] up what's their deviation from the world
[1:27:24] amen and whenever it is caught
[1:27:27] when it is caught
[1:27:30] being anti-world
[1:27:32] it always like to fall back on this one
[1:27:36] argument that it's always had through
[1:27:39] the ages
[1:27:41] that shows them to be false well look
[1:27:44] how the lord is working through me
[1:27:47] i get results
[1:27:48] we get results don't we get results
[1:27:51] then we have to be of god
[1:27:53] uh because we're getting results and
[1:27:56] holy spirit is walking through us
[1:27:58] working through us amen that is in the
[1:28:01] uh
[1:28:02] the resume of the ages uh under the
[1:28:06] seven church ages
[1:28:08] see
[1:28:09] in the days of the prophets that's
[1:28:11] exactly what happened they did the same
[1:28:15] thing
[1:28:16] they didn't recognize them
[1:28:19] people
[1:28:20] till
[1:28:21] they had done come
[1:28:23] done their ministry
[1:28:25] and had finished
[1:28:27] took out
[1:28:29] of that elected
[1:28:31] and after they were gone
[1:28:33] then they recognized that there was a
[1:28:36] prophet
[1:28:37] that was there
[1:28:39] walked amongst them
[1:28:42] jesus came to earth he said not even 19
[1:28:45] of the people on the earth even knew in
[1:28:48] that time that he the savior the world
[1:28:51] had come
[1:28:53] until
[1:28:54] they crucified him they buried him
[1:28:58] he rose on the third day before they
[1:29:00] ever knew
[1:29:02] who he was
[1:29:04] and it comes in and it goes out just
[1:29:06] like that all the time and people don't
[1:29:10] recognize it until it's over
[1:29:12] see because it never
[1:29:15] why does that happen
[1:29:17] why don't they recognize it it never
[1:29:20] fits their theology
[1:29:24] their rigid in other words their
[1:29:25] religious church teachings
[1:29:27] that they've been receiving and like i
[1:29:29] told you that that that shapes your mind
[1:29:32] when you're young and it shapes your
[1:29:34] environment your whole background and
[1:29:36] you come up to this time and it's a
[1:29:38] whole backwash of things that
[1:29:41] unconsciously been laid the devil make
[1:29:44] sure he tries to lay that in you and now
[1:29:47] the word the washing of the water of the
[1:29:49] world comes to take that all away amen
[1:29:53] and wash us clean and make us white as
[1:29:56] snow hallelujah amen you see
[1:29:59] wow let me give you some things i made a
[1:30:02] note here
[1:30:03] the people don't recognize what's
[1:30:05] happening he said because it never fits
[1:30:08] into their theology
[1:30:11] it never fits
[1:30:14] into
[1:30:15] their time of the day
[1:30:18] in other words they don't recognize
[1:30:20] that they um
[1:30:22] which time of the week they're in
[1:30:25] the time of the day they don't know
[1:30:26] which time of the week they're in so you
[1:30:29] know somehow still think they're they're
[1:30:30] lutherans they're lutheran age sometimes
[1:30:33] they're baptists they're back in
[1:30:34] methodist and wesley age they don't
[1:30:37] think like that
[1:30:38] that they're spiritually back in that
[1:30:41] age but what their spirit that is in
[1:30:43] them is spouting
[1:30:45] identifies it that it identifies with
[1:30:48] that age back there
[1:30:50] amen and those that are under that
[1:30:52] pentecostal influence that may even be
[1:30:54] under the in them in the message amen
[1:30:57] they may not be acting jumping and
[1:30:59] carrying on like pentecostals but when
[1:31:02] they speak and their response to the
[1:31:05] word their reaction to the message and
[1:31:07] the revelation of the word of god their
[1:31:10] activity as he said the motivating thing
[1:31:13] of that spirit that's back there oh and
[1:31:16] their reaction to the word proves what
[1:31:19] is back there what's inside that skin
[1:31:22] what's hiding in there it proves it see
[1:31:25] they it doesn't fit the time of the day
[1:31:28] they got their lines tangled up they got
[1:31:30] everything next mixed up hallelujah oh
[1:31:34] he said here not only that they don't
[1:31:37] recognize what's happening
[1:31:39] because they're always living in a glare
[1:31:42] of another age that has already passed
[1:31:46] amen they're living in the glare of
[1:31:49] another age in other words they are
[1:31:52] still
[1:31:53] allowing themselves or not even
[1:31:55] conscious sometimes that they're being
[1:31:57] influenced
[1:31:59] or motivated
[1:32:01] by the glare that they're getting from
[1:32:04] another age hallelujah he said see
[1:32:08] they're blinded by that glare also like
[1:32:12] it was back then
[1:32:13] oh we call it traditions but he never
[1:32:16] come according to traditions and the
[1:32:19] people are blinded by keeping to their
[1:32:22] church traditions
[1:32:24] amen oh my and so much
[1:32:28] but that they thought that when he come
[1:32:30] preaching the truth that he jesus had
[1:32:33] come to break up their churches
[1:32:36] you know what they thought about brother
[1:32:37] branham
[1:32:39] the truth that they're exclaiming their
[1:32:41] worship the god they claim to serve is
[1:32:43] standing right before them preaching the
[1:32:46] truth to them but you see the devil and
[1:32:50] the church leaders and elders had led
[1:32:53] them so far away
[1:32:56] from the truth of the word of god that
[1:32:59] when it comes and it's announcing itself
[1:33:02] he look like he is way out
[1:33:06] and they you see that's the way it is
[1:33:10] they couldn't accept jesus himself
[1:33:13] because they were living under the glare
[1:33:16] of the law and jesus didn't come
[1:33:19] contrary to the law he came to fulfill
[1:33:22] the law amen he come to make it real
[1:33:26] hallelujah but
[1:33:28] he says
[1:33:29] listen
[1:33:31] but because his message
[1:33:35] back then
[1:33:36] wasn't exactly the way the way they had
[1:33:40] it
[1:33:41] it was
[1:33:42] it was called them traditions they
[1:33:44] didn't come according to their
[1:33:46] traditions see they couldn't receive him
[1:33:50] but it was because of his message
[1:33:56] hallelujah
[1:33:58] we know you you are you are so-and-so's
[1:33:59] son but there's things that you're
[1:34:01] saying his message
[1:34:03] they couldn't receive him because of his
[1:34:05] message
[1:34:06] they think when brother branstad towns
[1:34:07] is not the evidence of the holy ghost he
[1:34:09] come to break up all the churches and he
[1:34:11] comes to town as one god they think he
[1:34:13] comes to break up all the churches but
[1:34:16] they don't realize he's bringing them
[1:34:17] back to the original truth of the word
[1:34:21] of god
[1:34:23] my friends
[1:34:24] that could happen again do you know it
[1:34:28] and if it happens again
[1:34:30] maybe we wouldn't even know it
[1:34:35] oh my
[1:34:37] i imagine
[1:34:39] if he would actually were to appear here
[1:34:42] tonight while i'm speaking to you
[1:34:45] he's talking to them
[1:34:47] and he's saying if he were to appear
[1:34:50] here amen
[1:34:52] and i i wanna just i won't give you the
[1:34:55] whole quote but another place he said if
[1:34:58] he were standing here in my place
[1:35:01] wearing a business suit on
[1:35:03] you know like i'm wearing and speaking
[1:35:07] to you you wouldn't many will not even
[1:35:10] recognize him it's not the truth
[1:35:13] oh my
[1:35:15] yes
[1:35:16] think of it if he would actually appear
[1:35:19] here again tonight
[1:35:21] it would be so contrary to what they all
[1:35:25] got figured out and drawn up on their
[1:35:28] charts
[1:35:29] what they are teaching in them schools
[1:35:32] and all them things they are giving out
[1:35:34] only a very few would recognize
[1:35:38] what was really going on he said it
[1:35:42] would be so
[1:35:43] and how that he would come hallelujah
[1:35:47] and men always have to have that is from
[1:35:51] this message called the presence of god
[1:35:53] amongst them
[1:35:55] unrecognized
[1:35:57] is that the truth
[1:35:58] is that happening again
[1:36:00] is it repeating again in our time
[1:36:03] as simply and plainly as we see it it's
[1:36:07] happening again praise god hallelujah
[1:36:11] they have their own their ideas of how
[1:36:13] god ought to be
[1:36:15] and what he when he appears what he's
[1:36:17] going to do
[1:36:19] amen
[1:36:20] but i've always made a spirit man always
[1:36:23] gives god praise for what he did and
[1:36:25] always looking forward to what he will
[1:36:27] do
[1:36:28] and ignoring what he is doing right now
[1:36:31] is that right
[1:36:32] that's the way they miss it nine times
[1:36:35] out of ten
[1:36:37] out of 10
[1:36:38] the thing is already happening
[1:36:42] around them
[1:36:44] and it's so simple and it's happening
[1:36:47] around them
[1:36:49] they don't know it
[1:36:51] is that right
[1:36:53] you're looking at it but you don't know
[1:36:55] what you're seeing
[1:36:57] when you look
[1:36:59] what do you see
[1:37:01] you heard the other quote where i said
[1:37:03] someone could tell you to go get such
[1:37:05] and such from the barn and because you
[1:37:07] don't know what's a hammer
[1:37:09] you can be looking at the hammer and you
[1:37:11] go pick up a saw because you think the
[1:37:13] saw is the hammer because you don't know
[1:37:15] what you're supposed to see you're
[1:37:18] looking but you're not seeing right and
[1:37:20] so the holy spirit has come to quicken
[1:37:23] us to see the coming of the lord
[1:37:27] praise god hallelujah now remember
[1:37:32] god hides in simplicity reveals himself
[1:37:35] in the same
[1:37:36] remember this is the complete revelation
[1:37:41] of jesus christ
[1:37:43] hallelujah
[1:37:45] the seven seals had the mysteries hid if
[1:37:48] that's what it all was
[1:37:51] but it was supposed to open
[1:37:54] and it's supposed to open
[1:37:56] in the last days
[1:38:00] at the edition church age
[1:38:04] but at the end of time
[1:38:06] at the end of the ladies and church age
[1:38:09] when time shall be no more
[1:38:12] when the changes are over
[1:38:15] that's when it's supposed to
[1:38:18] make itself manifest
[1:38:19] and reveal itself see
[1:38:22] in the last day
[1:38:24] at the end of time thanks be to god
[1:38:28] when that happens that shows
[1:38:31] and finishes the
[1:38:34] message of the church ages
[1:38:38] he repeats
[1:38:39] that now finishes it
[1:38:43] when you look back now
[1:38:46] and see what has been
[1:38:49] see
[1:38:50] where it all it's all brought up to
[1:38:54] and then now it finishes it yes
[1:38:59] it now finishes the age of the church
[1:39:04] right
[1:39:05] so it's now we can see it's not just
[1:39:07] mike coming to you a long while ago and
[1:39:10] saying he's talking about those the the
[1:39:12] the church ages the man who come to the
[1:39:16] last of those church ages statue of a
[1:39:18] perfect man and has entered into that
[1:39:20] eternal church age at the end of the
[1:39:23] seals he said it over and over in many
[1:39:26] different ways it's all done completed
[1:39:29] and now it's time for the bride to enter
[1:39:32] in hallelujah praise god and go into the
[1:39:37] word see it finishes the age of the
[1:39:42] church you know what he's saying one
[1:39:44] edge closes and another one opens
[1:39:47] it's always the case one edge closes
[1:39:49] another one opens so when those church
[1:39:51] ages end what opens up
[1:39:55] it can't be another church age that
[1:39:58] we're preaching or talking about don't
[1:40:00] let the devil mess your mind up to tell
[1:40:02] you that that's what i'm talking about
[1:40:04] that's a lie
[1:40:07] because he's talking about people that
[1:40:09] have eternal life
[1:40:12] and so people that has an eternal life
[1:40:15] their messenger can't be a man
[1:40:18] it has to be
[1:40:20] that mighty angel that eternal being
[1:40:23] the mighty elohim god
[1:40:26] the covenant angel i'm just saying it
[1:40:28] many ways but all
[1:40:30] eternal
[1:40:31] messenger to an eternal people that will
[1:40:35] live
[1:40:36] in the eternal church age if we call it
[1:40:39] church edge for the mortal heirs but to
[1:40:43] break back into eternity by the
[1:40:46] revelation of the word to enter back
[1:40:48] where you come from
[1:40:50] for we are not creatures of time we come
[1:40:53] from eternity we're going back to
[1:40:55] eternity
[1:40:56] we come from the beginning in the mind
[1:40:59] of god we're going back to the mind of
[1:41:01] god hallelujah blessed be the name of
[1:41:05] the lord hallelujah what oh he said i
[1:41:08] know this chokes you up when you hear
[1:41:11] that just so that you'll be sure
[1:41:14] hallelujah you must understand don't
[1:41:16] just read your bible like this like
[1:41:19] you're reading a newspaper you must read
[1:41:22] between the lines
[1:41:24] and see
[1:41:27] when you read
[1:41:28] hallelujah you're not just to read your
[1:41:31] bible but read and see
[1:41:34] what you read we are quicker to see
[1:41:37] he said see oh
[1:41:39] then when you read like that
[1:41:42] then the picture will begin to come
[1:41:45] oh praise god hallelujah amen feast of
[1:41:49] the trumpets oh the picture will begin
[1:41:51] to come and you recognize it's christ
[1:41:54] revealing himself in his own word oh
[1:41:57] thank god oh my continuing feast of the
[1:42:00] trumpets now you see the church of the
[1:42:04] pentecostal age is done finished
[1:42:09] it's over
[1:42:11] and now the bride has to prepare herself
[1:42:16] to step of the out of the way
[1:42:22] to go up now
[1:42:25] so that them two other servants of god
[1:42:30] them two spoken of in revelation
[1:42:33] them two prophets
[1:42:35] can appear on the scene
[1:42:38] to sound the seventh trumpet
[1:42:42] to them
[1:42:43] to make them
[1:42:45] make known to them
[1:42:47] christ
[1:42:49] like we know christ
[1:42:50] now when he said seventh trumpet there
[1:42:53] you gotta understand he's talking really
[1:42:55] about the seventh seal
[1:42:57] the seventh seal
[1:42:59] and that when that's the seal to us but
[1:43:02] the trumpet to them right praise god and
[1:43:05] he says and you see uh
[1:43:08] we have to go out the way he said
[1:43:09] because two two like that supernatural
[1:43:12] beings can't be on the earth here at the
[1:43:15] same time one has to go so that the
[1:43:18] other one can
[1:43:19] manifest and so the rapture is near
[1:43:22] the bride has to go out of here
[1:43:25] so that those can be man manifest
[1:43:28] hallelujah and the spirit of the living
[1:43:30] god can move upon the earth amen god has
[1:43:33] other things praise god if you have a
[1:43:35] little more time i'll speak a little
[1:43:37] more and bring this to an end i'm not
[1:43:39] going to keep you forever here but i
[1:43:42] want to get this thought out praise god
[1:43:45] hallelujah remember he was god
[1:43:50] remember
[1:43:51] he was the genuine mercy seat
[1:43:55] remember he was the atonement
[1:43:59] hallelujah we sing the hymn we say
[1:44:03] lo
[1:44:04] behold him in front of you
[1:44:07] oh
[1:44:08] he has the mighty conqueror
[1:44:12] since
[1:44:13] he rent the veil in two unveils a
[1:44:17] tradition he's talk he's singing about
[1:44:18] there there's a tradition veils of ideas
[1:44:21] he rent them into to cause you to see
[1:44:24] what you're seeing today by the opening
[1:44:27] of the word of god amen and now you see
[1:44:31] he he
[1:44:33] came
[1:44:34] and the bright sea
[1:44:36] the mercy seat
[1:44:38] is now hanging in clear view
[1:44:41] of the congregation
[1:44:44] but many of them being under popular
[1:44:47] opinion
[1:44:49] can't see
[1:44:51] the word of god
[1:44:53] for their age are you thinking of what
[1:44:55] i'm saying
[1:44:57] you're thinking about what i'm saying
[1:44:58] right
[1:44:59] praise the lord hallelujah amen
[1:45:03] but in the view of today
[1:45:05] in the view of what we have here today
[1:45:08] i'm afraid the traditions of the church
[1:45:10] fathers
[1:45:11] had has hid this from many people since
[1:45:17] the holy ghost has come
[1:45:20] in these last days as he prophesied
[1:45:24] and the veil has been rent
[1:45:28] past tense the veil has been red
[1:45:33] now while i'm talking there just strike
[1:45:35] me the scriptures just coming to me now
[1:45:37] remember when jesus was there on calvary
[1:45:41] on calvary and
[1:45:43] gave up the ghost and screamed with a
[1:45:46] loud voice to call for the resurrected
[1:45:48] dead while i'm talking to you all that
[1:45:50] came

[1:46:01] the same thing in your day an angel a
[1:46:03] seventh angel come with the perfect word
[1:46:06] of god hebrews 4 12 and rent the veil of
[1:46:10] traditions and ideas from the minds of
[1:46:12] man that you might see the mercy seat
[1:46:15] plain view before you oh praise be to
[1:46:18] god hallelujah yes

[1:46:23] of those who believe for he hid the word
[1:46:27] the real promised word of this day
[1:46:31] he hid that word
[1:46:33] and them traditions made a veil
[1:46:37] to hide that word behind but he
[1:46:40] quickened us to see
[1:46:43] what was there praise god mighty god

[1:49:47] has
[1:49:48] gone through some great burnt pains
[1:49:52] the church is also going through some
[1:49:55] birth pains let me just break this
[1:49:57] quickly to move away from
[1:49:59] much of this quote
[1:50:01] the world is going through its board
[1:50:03] pains through war
[1:50:04] the church is going through its birth
[1:50:06] pains through the presence of a prophet
[1:50:08] being in its midst
[1:50:11] and his preaching is the pulsation that
[1:50:14] causes that work pain in the church
[1:50:17] war is the pulsation that causes the
[1:50:21] birth pains in the world
[1:50:23] oh praise god hallelujah but see
[1:50:26] now all that the world has went through
[1:50:30] now it's getting ready for a third world
[1:50:33] war can you say amen
[1:50:36] and it's birth pains time again
[1:50:40] but there's only one thing that can
[1:50:42] bring peace
[1:50:43] and that is christ
[1:50:45] not the u.n not all these things that
[1:50:47] they're claiming let's go here to stop
[1:50:49] the war let's do this let's do that only
[1:50:51] christ
[1:50:52] amen all our schemes all our ideas all
[1:50:56] our ecclesiastic build up all of our
[1:50:58] politics all our science everything else
[1:51:01] they are proving themselves to be
[1:51:03] nonsense
[1:51:05] amen
[1:51:07] and then
[1:51:08] they're praying to god lord help us lord
[1:51:10] help us lord help us lord come and
[1:51:13] intervene
[1:51:14] come in do something for us lord
[1:51:17] and then
[1:51:18] when he does come in
[1:51:20] and intervenes i wonder if we would be
[1:51:23] able to understand
[1:51:25] what he's doing
[1:51:27] recognize what he's doing
[1:51:30] would we be able to receive
[1:51:32] what he's doing would we even be willing
[1:51:35] to consider
[1:51:37] what he's doing amen people a lot of
[1:51:40] people may be praying right now lord
[1:51:41] stop the war stop the war but he can
[1:51:44] stop the war but when he stops it in
[1:51:46] such a way that you don't recognize that
[1:51:50] is god stopped it and why he stopped it
[1:51:52] how he stopped him praise the lord i
[1:51:54] hope god opens your eyes to this now
[1:51:58] for i'm not just speaking to this church
[1:52:01] here
[1:52:02] i'm speaking
[1:52:03] where this tip will ever go
[1:52:06] worldwide
[1:52:09] i don't mean to hurt anybody's feelings
[1:52:13] but you see
[1:52:14] it's the ecclesiastical realm
[1:52:17] right
[1:52:18] that has loosed
[1:52:20] these spirits again
[1:52:22] are you getting that
[1:52:24] they've lose the spirits from out of all
[1:52:27] pagan rome
[1:52:29] that went forth back there on them jews
[1:52:32] who have always been their enemy right
[1:52:37] and rome has always been god's enemy
[1:52:40] it has turned loose that same spirit see
[1:52:44] by
[1:52:45] and on the dictators of the world can
[1:52:49] you say amen
[1:52:51] see what spirit is working through
[1:52:54] why do you think
[1:52:56] that people
[1:52:57] are just getting blown up by the
[1:52:59] thousands
[1:53:00] the rest of the world sits right there
[1:53:03] nothing's happening
[1:53:04] because they don't understand it looks
[1:53:06] natural but there's something
[1:53:08] supernatural going on right there now
[1:53:11] and god
[1:53:12] is saying
[1:53:13] see that in other words that same spirit
[1:53:15] that worked in the inquisition where
[1:53:17] they killed 25 million
[1:53:20] in the world
[1:53:21] what's the world done nothing
[1:53:23] right and they're still killing whether
[1:53:25] it's up
[1:53:26] whether it's up in the north here of
[1:53:29] canada where what is down in the united
[1:53:31] states in whatever city that was there
[1:53:35] all around the world is going on and
[1:53:37] they're killing by the thousands and the
[1:53:39] world is doing nothing about it
[1:53:42] why oh my he said it's that
[1:53:45] ecclesiastical spirit amen hiding behind
[1:53:49] the cross
[1:53:50] and committing evil deeds in the name of
[1:53:53] christ
[1:53:55] oh my what a deceiver oh my lord have
[1:54:00] mercy think of it see
[1:54:02] that it's moving on the dictators of the
[1:54:04] world
[1:54:06] because the religious system was still
[1:54:10] there were holding it but now it's
[1:54:12] loosed
[1:54:13] and it's being loosed
[1:54:15] how many of you recognize
[1:54:17] that it was an orthodox priest
[1:54:21] that actually told mr putin not my
[1:54:24] saying it is in the paper so you can go
[1:54:26] and search it on the internet that told
[1:54:29] him
[1:54:30] that he is doing this in the name of god
[1:54:36] and he is supposed to deliver those
[1:54:38] people from the godless nazism
[1:54:42] back to the original fate of the
[1:54:45] orthodox religion
[1:54:47] which is the eastern catholic church
[1:54:49] it's the same spirit is eastern that's
[1:54:51] the eastern arm and what we call rome is
[1:54:54] actually the western arm of the same
[1:54:56] catholic church and the bible already
[1:54:58] tell you they're going to come right
[1:55:00] back together
[1:55:01] like that anyway but it's that
[1:55:03] ecclesiastical spirit
[1:55:05] that's causing this war and you can go
[1:55:07] back far and you can see it was a
[1:55:09] catholic spirit that was there anointing
[1:55:11] hitler
[1:55:13] when he came forward to the war it's the
[1:55:15] same thing
[1:55:16] they were behind the scenes urging him
[1:55:18] on egging him on taking all the
[1:55:20] paintings and all the wealth and
[1:55:22] hiding it and passing it through the
[1:55:24] vatican and so on like that it's right
[1:55:26] there in history and in the world right
[1:55:28] you can see it and so that spirit has
[1:55:31] always been god's enemy and it's loosed
[1:55:36] but you see
[1:55:38] you must see the hour of slaughter
[1:55:41] bringing that slaughter for is the
[1:55:44] spirit the same spirit of the antichrist
[1:55:48] bringing protestant
[1:55:50] a ecumenical council of the churches
[1:55:53] together
[1:55:54] and taking them to a slaughter
[1:55:57] just like they did
[1:55:59] oh my but in the same hour
[1:56:03] the calling of the bride
[1:56:05] hallelujah why
[1:56:08] because loose in ecclesiastical church
[1:56:11] spirit
[1:56:12] that spirit is loose upon what or upon
[1:56:17] who
[1:56:18] not upon the denominations
[1:56:21] see
[1:56:22] they are now loosed upon the bride do
[1:56:25] you get it
[1:56:27] oh my
[1:56:29] then you'll find if you go back to
[1:56:30] revelation it talks about that woman's
[1:56:33] that was there and and made the
[1:56:36] antichrist spirit the dragon
[1:56:38] spew out of our mouth his mouth lies and
[1:56:42] spew out things upon that woman and
[1:56:44] trying to eat up that child that she
[1:56:47] brought for the man child amen praise
[1:56:50] god but you see it's war against the
[1:56:53] bride spiritual war amen these spirits i
[1:56:57] was telling you earlier in the year i
[1:56:59] just feel like like it's more
[1:57:01] devils around and more activity going
[1:57:04] around attacking the mind attacking the
[1:57:07] body attacking your being in every
[1:57:09] possible way my friends we talk about
[1:57:12] the war but you really are now living in
[1:57:14] the midst of an ongoing war that's
[1:57:17] taking place and those spirits are
[1:57:20] amongst us working in every possible way

[1:57:27] is there it's there upon the bride do
[1:57:30] you get it but the bride will not go
[1:57:33] through
[1:57:34] the tribulation the bible says no the
[1:57:38] church will but not the bride but the
[1:57:41] church has to go through
[1:57:44] persecution
[1:57:46] for her perfection

[2:08:05] me the other day while he was speaking
[2:08:08] about the quickening power he just said
[2:08:10] this in passing but you just get it he
[2:08:12] said a young man came to me the other
[2:08:14] day
[2:08:15] and um
[2:08:17] he hadn't told anybody what was
[2:08:20] wrong with him what i said um
[2:08:24] whatever his name was he says
[2:08:26] something's wrong with your ear he said
[2:08:28] oh yes
[2:08:29] brother bran he said but you never said
[2:08:32] anything about it he says yes brother
[2:08:34] bran he said you didn't tell me anything
[2:08:36] about it he says no brother branham i
[2:08:38] didn't tell anybody about it he says
[2:08:41] why didn't you come and ask me to pray
[2:08:43] for it
[2:08:44] he said well i didn't want to bother you
[2:08:46] or anything like that
[2:08:48] brother branham he said oh my he said
[2:08:51] and i just went over to him he said god
[2:08:53] bless you brother just
[2:08:55] just laid my hand on the shoulder and
[2:08:57] took it off of that and let him go
[2:09:00] a few days later
[2:09:02] it was all gone
[2:09:04] he said do you know
[2:09:06] quickening power
[2:09:08] in every one of you
[2:09:11] you have to go and make a big long loud
[2:09:14] prayer like you're you know that's okay
[2:09:16] if that's the way god built you you know
[2:09:19] this that's the way god built some of us
[2:09:21] really emotional and so on and so on are
[2:09:23] the ones a little quiet a lot of ones
[2:09:25] this way that way don't look at that
[2:09:27] person and say oh that's you should be
[2:09:29] done this way no
[2:09:30] let everything be in its own order
[2:09:34] but he says you know as simple as that
[2:09:38] i knew
[2:09:39] that which had started in his ear could
[2:09:41] have
[2:09:42] eaten out his total his brains
[2:09:46] he would have been dead
[2:09:48] because it would have taken his brains
[2:09:50] and his ears and rotted it all out
[2:09:53] but he said do you see
[2:09:55] just one touch
[2:09:58] and it was all over
[2:10:01] and that's what you got to understand

[2:12:08] region
[2:12:10] and you know that independent assemblies
[2:12:12] of god

[2:12:33] or to
[2:12:34] certify
[2:12:36] their ministers to go preach the gospel
[2:12:39] so they formed this
[2:12:42] independent
[2:12:43] assemblies of god
[2:12:46] and had it registered so that they can
[2:12:48] do that and they have been doing that up
