here uh with us and allow us the privilege of joining with you and be Witnesses of the dedication of this child here are a few words from God's book Deuteronomy 6: 4-9 you don't need to find it is just than here oh Israel the Lord our God is one Lord amen and thou shallal love the Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might and these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart and thou shal teach them diligently unto thy children and shall talk of them when thou sest in thy house and when thou walkest by the way and when thou liest down and when thou risest up Thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes and thou shalt write them upon the post of thy house and on thy Gates of course you know the Jews do that literally uh the real conservative ones carry the word of God in a little faty on their forehead and then they have something on their hand with it and then they have it on the the door by the door of their house where they touch it and say a little quick prayer when they go in and out uh and they carry that out according to uh the law praise the lord well Lord has blessed me with three grandchildren so I know um the feeling four sorry four grandchildren so I know the feeling uh yeah uh four of them so I want to thank the Lord for that and I know what the feeling is and also the responsibility that comes with it and to realize that there are awesome gift you're an awesome gift that comes from God that you should see your children oh how wonderful and especially the man here when you can see your children's children what a blessing praise God forever more and my uh wife's mom had her 95th birthday this week and she is seeing her children's children children prise God hallelujah of course we know the first responsibility of parents is the love the Lord thy God Amen uh uh you know we dedicate children regardless of whether their parents are Christians or not because we have a chance in the child's life to get them started right and for the influence of the Holy Spirit to be upon their lives whether or not the parents are Christian amen but when the parents are Christian what a blessing a double blessing that is amen that child in every possible way amen yes sir and uh they have their responsibilities through that to be examples for this child or for any child of any parent that they will have you need to be a responsibility need to have the responsibility you need to have the example and not only on Sunday morning but we have too many Sunday morning Christians but they don't live the life for the rest of the week right but God said when you're sitting down when you're when you're rising up even when you on your bed your thought should be on the Lord you should be talking about the Lord talk to the child about the Lord I know my mother with older uh you know the smaller children in our arms you know praise God and she'll be singing hyms or she'll be singing some song something that will make them relax and go to sleep and feel comfortable with in their mother's arms praise God hallelujah now our responsibilities is not just to be only examples but trainers we need to train them not to be the kind of prayers that would just loose them like wild animals and let them run all over the place or do whatever they wish to do but in the first stage you have to have a firm grip because you're shaping level you're shaping the character you you're bringing them to understand discipline to understand order and these kinds of things and when they have understood that then you take your hands off slowly not just take it off but slowly you start to take it off and allow God to move in their lives and then you'll see the effects of the word SE that you were you had planted within their hearts and within their lives so this passage is telling us train them when we are sitting down okay you have a visual already the mother or the father sitting down and the child is on their knee or the child is in their arm and they and they're they're talking about the Lord maybe maybe to the child or even when they're not talking to the child we do believe it the child is still listening amen you say oh they can't understand that's what you think right they can't express themselves but the spirit inside is older than that body right and then what happens is that they're holding the child and if the mother and the father is smoking even though the child is a baby they even influencing the child if they're cursing it's going in the subconscious of that child if they arguing fighting fting threat it's going into the subconscious of that child so even when you're sitting down and just the m the dad is talking back and forth there's still an influence going forth praise God hallelujah so we to train them even when we are sitting down and when we are walking as soon as you know we're walking with them in our arms and go for a walk we're talking they're still there with you or later on when they can toddle along you hold them and what do you do any parent knows this any Pastor Any teacher you slow down right to the level of how you congregation can walk because they can't walk faster they you know they're not seeing as far as you so you got to slow down praise God and it's the same thing you you slow down and you hold your hands so you're training them to walk but you know what happens after you train them to walk after whether they can walk properly the next thing you know they want to run is that right and you say no no no don't run too far slow down you know because they still have to keep an eye on you praise the Lord so God says train them when you lying down you know praise God it's nice that we have all these Nursery things and we put them in their own little thing and we teaching them to be in dependent from the day they born put them inside you know but the old days which I think is still real and even now if we have that nothing is wrong with having that but sometimes you need to have your child right behind you right beside you when you're taking a little dose amen praise God oh some of you scared I'm going to roll over and kill the child no you w roll over and kill the child I'll tell you one thing a real mother even though if her child is sleeping beside her she's sleeping but she ain't sleeping she's always conscious that child what's wrong but right away she is right there because that's how God built you sisters in that kind wait the man he got out the jail gone to gone to sleep to the world and something happened wait you didn't know how come I was I'm fast asleep right because man are made look different but God has built you sisters in a wonderful way that any sound from that child and they're right away right away like that so praise God so train them even when you're laying down train them with the word of God God within your hand in other words training is a conscious effort you don't just say oh they're going to learn and you just leave them no you got to train them and to train them it'll take you doing your part it'll take the church the Sunday School doing its part it'll take the school doing their part how much they can do I don't know but the fact is it will take uh training to train the child and train them with the word of God that you might want to have pictures on your wall you know you might want to have a Christian symbols around so that when they come conscious say Mommy what is that you say oh that that's Jesus what picture is that that's Jesus what's that oh that's a cross what do you mean cross and then there you go you have to start to you're training that right so this is important that we do this praise the Lord hallelujah amen oh praise God so we know that there are many many tools of course that we can use to train the child and we need uh to uh plan that and work with that and train them in the Lord praise God because without the plan uh you're doomed to fail uh I think I had an old principle that says if you fail to prepare then prepare to fail so you've got to prepare to do that praise the Lord hallelujah now that's our to train them and it's our right responsibility to to keep the Lord before our children's face and eyes you know when a baby is born what's the first thing the mothers do they hand up something with little uh eye catching colored stuff to catch their eyes and and to catch their attention well that is actually what the word is telling you to do that to keep the word in front of their eyes at all times and and and let them be seen it uh let them be hearing it and then it goes down into their soul praise the Lord amen CU a day doesn't go by when we don't learn things from God that we can pass on praise God hallelujah do it now and save yourself from the sorrow later is that right do it now and save yourself from the problems and the sorrow later on Hallelujah and when they get old enough do all your best that you can to point them to the Lord listen to some questions that you might want to think about do you love the Lord with all your heart and your soul and your might do you have the desire to train your child to love the Lord do you have yet a plan to train them do you set a good example for your child to follow do you have any knowledge of the doctrines of the Bible the disciplines of the scripture the books of the Bible do you have a time when you pray so that even your child may see you praying so that they understand the importance of prayer and let me ask will this church help these parents to be the best examples that they can be amen and so Let the Church Say Amen amen will this church pray for these parents and their child or children from this day forward say Amen will this church pray for the Salvation of this child right now even at an early age as soon as God will call them and Let the church say amen amen will this church pray for this child looking way ahead that God will give them a spouse house a a partner that Sav and knows the Lord will the church say amen amen will the church help again these parents with the training of this child amen praise the Lord hallelujah now I'm going to take the uh boy in my hand if if he will allow me if not then I will just lay my hands upon him and

all let to see faces amen richly bless everyone of you in the house of the Lord God bless you real good now um yesterday we were the leadership of the church were we're having a great wonderful leadership meeting together Friday night as well as on Saturday going over some things the direction of the church structure the church Financial um you Financial uh uh positioning of the church and our position also in the community positioning God's plan how are we going to carry out God's plan on Earth you know going over various uh things on a practical uh level so there are things that we're going to want to do in this to do this year uh with and in the church and of course we're going to want to uh change certain things but one of the most important things that's very important to us and to me as Pastor is to change Behavior and the preaching of the word of God is supposed to change Behavior change lives change character for the glory of God now um is there anybody homeless here today just raise up your hand do we have any homeless nobody is homeless so everybody got a home right and somewhere that you live and when we have a home they there's a certain like we just said every home has its rules its regulations it has its uh own fundamental way that it operates every home has that and you know that the church is a church family right so this is our church home right amen praise the Lord you see what I'm saying this is not a restaurant where today you decide if you come you come and eat because the food is good today and then tomorrow you run over to the next restaurant eat the food over there because that's good then you next run the next place I feel like heating Chinese tomorrow Indian food the next day Caribbean the next day African the next day we jump there you know it's it's all food it's true when you say it's all food but you got to settle down to a place where you're feeding on food that you believe overall is suited to your Constitution amen and um when you are in a certain home like I said that home has rules now if the home doesn't have rules what kind of a home is that where the mother leads the child to run up the front door with a dirty nappy running down the street uh you know this it literally happens so let me let me feel free to talk to you praise the Lord run out in the yard and play with the dog and all money up and everything else like that and uh you know the all leave the children to jump up on the on the uh the not just the bed CU I used to do that as a boy think I can fly like Superman but I'm talking about about loose the children leave them wild and they jump on the Chester Field or on the your chairs and they're jumping up and they're swinging from the chandelier from the light and you know and jumping off of a table with their father umbrella trying to fly something and uh smashing and breaking things and pushing things aside and oh they're only children is that right oh they're only children let them have their freedom while they young later on you know when they can understand then we going to start to no you have to start right now when they young right that's it and then you have your natural house and and you're in your home and your children come on from school and they're chewing gum and they throw the ground gum on your carpet and they grind the car the come into the carpets and you you're saying oh Johnny don't do that and oh it's sometimes you can almost see a devilish ble coming out to the eyes of some of these children not the child but the devil just comes on them and does some qu things and you don't understand what is actually going on they grind in the thing there or you go to get them some juice they knock it out on your hand knock it up the ground this you know the the coloration from it just stain up your your tablecloths T up your carpet maybe it fly in the air and hit the drapes or something and you still tolerating that kind of behavior and and running a house like that and everybody in the house eat paper you know eat the candy drop the the paper on the ground or something like that or if they were uh reading a book they leave the book right there and you know nobody going to move it bre it there they drink juice drop the cup go back and have you know go over there have a glass of milk drop the cup leave it there and then the Cup start to build up and you know C here and played over there and come there I don't want to ask if you know what I'm talking about for anybody to get themselves away but uh these kinds of things are happening and it happen so bad that um I went to a certain home I don't remember the church but I went to a certain many years ago around 25 years ago and when the door was open I was hit with the with a blast of the smell of cat pieces mixed in with whatever else pieces I don't know it's almost like you want to pass out and the person is living comfortable in that home they are climatized and they just so much to the smell and to the disorder that they don't even know that it's disorder and that it's a mess and everything else they're so comfortable and say oh brother Simon come in what have you like that and me said I don't even want to open my mouth for the inner to get in my lungs I know it sounds funny but this really really happened and to put insult to injury say come in come in come have a cup of tea [Music] see I I I haven't even touched the cup or touch anything I don't want to touch the the door to open the door push it or anything like that you know and I feel nauseous and I haven't drank one spot of tea or anything yet you might think I'm exaggerating but literally I was under that condition and had to really uh be quick of mind and Nimble of to be able to get myself out of a situation there because there's no way I was going to drink a a tea there or touch anything for that matter but anyway the Lord brought me out of that situation but what I'm saying there's a lot of people that live like that people believe it they live like that we carry all like that um I'm not talking about somebody being poor and they have um just uh cheap clothing or regular clothing or used furniture or or whatever or you go to a home where you know there's kids and they leave mag I'm not talking about the normal everyday house mess you understand what I'm talking about that's a normal thing because you're using the house I still I don't believe in these picture houses too much where every hair is in place everything is like a picture book it's nice when you have it that way but during the years when you're having children they do make a mess when they're gone then you can set them to place like that and that's why one of my grandchildren they said to me when they were trying to run in the um room there the room where we entertain and I said oh come out of there why you running around like a okay Grandad we're going to come up your Museum watch this K [Music] today it's so sharp it's on that you know you left with your mouth open and your say oh my goodness what what you answer that child so so that that that's it so I'm not going to either extreme but I'm saying there's a general thing but I'm talking about when the house is really a awful mess and some people live in the atmosphere until they become climatized or normalized to that atmosphere [Music] well God May save your soul but if you never learn that you have to brush your teeth saving your soul it don't have too much with you brushing your teeth when you going to work or coming to church so what kind of preaching is this because it's practical it's right where you live it's right where the rubber hits the road we're not just telling you all come to Jesus we all going to heaven before you get to heaven you got to live right here is that right you got to live right there before you get to heaven so here we go now are you listening to this or you want this to ever as quickly as possible I'll make the pain you know as quickly as possible but anyway the fact is I'm saying that people get saved but after they're saved what happens is that your habits don't change overnight your natural habits it just doesn't change overnight you have got to allow the Holy Spirit to work on your life and to begin to change you you from the inside out through God's power to transform and therefore it happens that some not sometimes the church then could be a meure just a mingling of a group of a disparate group of people different kinds of people uh with different habits and different cultures and if it's just a cultural thing that's one thing but cleanliness order that has nothing to do with just culture that goes across the board for every race Nation nationality and religion maybe accept um rest far right who don't wash their hair at all once they and leave it to grow uh as long as it goes but I'm just saying to you that um it cuts across the lines and this is just practical stuff so then when people get born again saved or come to the message they come in the house of God we all show praise the Lord hallelujah glory to God everything else like that that's wonderful but then the next thing you know because of B habits at all they start ring it in the church and then it starts making the church if the church like our church was built brand new and everything plac in it brand new they start acting in the church just the way they acted at home they start um behaving with their children and loose them and leave them alone to stick their hand here go over there run there do this do that and and then have the go to tell the pastor nobody speaks tell my child anything this is my child and I'm the only one to be able to tell them anything well you make a big mistake cuz I was reading where brother brand says he said one place he says brother Neville is placed there as a pastor and but as a pastor he said he's kind of different he has a nice patient and a very gentle nature and so much he says that as a pastor he hesitates to tell somebody that's misbehaving sit down or go over there or move here he said but I'm different I'm not like her never God built me with the strength to be able to say sit up or do this or do that stop doing this right now amen just the way God built men right but the fact is some people don't even want to be told Amen brother Simon why don't you just preach the revelations build us up in the revelation of the message and the prophet so we can know the word yeah but then you're not going to know how and the Holy Spirit has got to take these things out of us or else it's going to be sitting there forever until you leave here it won't hinder your salvation it will hinder your salvation but it will hinder your associations your relationships uh right here on the earth amen if you don't change the most natural things within your life that may be hindering you amen and when it hinders you and you come in the church and you bring all that baggage along with you then it starts to be baggage in the church right we here the preacher has to preach this kind of a message listen to the prophet of God he said that God has given us a wonderful beautiful building to Worship in can you say amen amen and it's our duty to make the inside right by the grace of God uh that it would be a beautiful building that we come to and that everyone most of all will see the beautiful characteristics of Jesus Christ in every person that's in here so the building can be beautiful we can have all the stained glass windows beautiful mural things on the wall and let's go there's nothing wrong with that some Churches just like the church to be completely plain other ones love to have all kinds of things there not nothing wrong with it it's just difference of how uh people decorate their home so to speak right but uh because that's not what's so interesed in God it's the beauty of Holiness of the character of the people that are in that building but the beauty of the building God uses that naturally as an attraction to to uh to Natural man who loves to be in that kind of a surroundings so God created that atmosphere naturally for them look he says we ought to be a this ought to be a consecrated place for the Lord if you agree say amen and the people that worship here ought to be a consecrated people to the Lord no matter how beautiful your church structure is and we that certainly will be appreciated but the real beauty of the church is the character of its people I trust that we will always keep this as a house of God a house of great Beauties amen praise the Lord so I he said I want to see this place correctly in order for God to Worship in with his people God is going to wash it in hair with his people like he used to fellowship with Adam and Eve that he can come down and have fellowship with us praise the Lord see and that we can only do that worship with him not by just having a pretty building but a consecrated life is the way that we can do that I agree completely with the prophet of God now I think we ought to have this this now we should keep it that way and one of the first things he said we should do listen Church listen deacons listen trustees we should never buy or sell anything in the sanctuary in the building praise the Lord now what he saying the building you know if you be theab they original if they hav changed it it was just before walls right the back wall and that's it and I remember coming in a side door from the back and sitting in the chair where brother BR sits behind that cross that he has up there cuz you know I came in with brother per GRE so sat us up there but that was it four walls they didn't have anything else there was no outside so he's talking when he said you should never he's talking about the sanctuary like we have this area dedicated set apart where we wash it right praise the Lord not talking about if you have a basement or if you have somewhere else that area overall it would be the best um the best action not to sell anything at all especially on [Music] Sunday amen so here he says we should never do any business in the auditorium here it should never be done in here right he stressing in the sanctuary in the Tabernacle it should not be done in here praise the Lord nobody should be buying or selling anything within this area that we separate and dedicate for the glory of God does everybody agree with that praise the name of the Lord uh does does everybody agree that we can sell from the pulpit and you know you know s between these four walls do you think that that's something that's all right after I've just told you that no we don't want to do that now we're bringing things back the way the prophet had it and the way God taught him and the way he taught us is that right praise the Lord and it's going to call from some strict adherence to the word not being too legalistic but to strict adherence to the word now we should not for ministers to come in stand here and sell books and everything else no matter what it is there is other places for them to do that amen amen not from the pulit here not within this area where we worshiping praise the Lord but maybe we permit them they can do that in the foer or they can do that in the basement where we where we we're going to finish up the library there where will be able to um materials can be displayed praise the Lord but not in the house of the Lord no matter what it is it should be a place of worship only holy consecrated for that purpose right amen he has given us this nice place let us dedicate to him and let us also dedicate ourselves to him by doing this praise the Lord Hallelujah by obeying the word we dedicate ourselves to him obeying him the word praise God remember not only selling a books but it's also pay attention here in the it's not a place for you to visit with one another it's a place for us to worship God now he's talking about our approach to washer over our front door as we come in we have the text of our scripture but the Lord is in his holy Temple let all the Earth keep silence before him listen it's not a place to visit for you to visit it's a place of worship we sh should never even murm one word inside of here when we come in outside of worship to the Lord to one another we should not murm to one another unless it is absolutely necessary right praise the lord we should never come in and rally around rally doesn't mean just run around but standing in groups talking inside of the sanctuary here is this coming through [Music] clear we should never run through the building ourselves or let our children go run through this building can I hear AOW amen praise God hallelujah amen we constructed this so that we could all take care of it can you say amen amen praise it's not the pastor constructed the deacons constructed the trustees constructed so they're responsible for it you also you are just as responsible praise God you put your heart on ties and your offerings into the house of God and then you're going to not want to go messing it up tearing it up uh you know damaging it bringing uh bad examples and bad habits dropping a gum dropping of papers you know just throw the communion cup leave it there um you know leave this H books whatever you know brother that's going to fix it brother coffee is going to do it this one is going to uh do the floor the other one you know is going to take care of the toilet so I can te up paper wet up the floor and you know I can just do whatever I want and make make a awful mess because other people somebody else is going to do it let me tell you we all have to do it we all have to do it and the te have right if there find people that are not doing it praise God we're not going to have no uh the deons are not going to turn themselves into uh headless police that washing using the washroom one of them run to check uh I'm not talking about those extremes uh like that praise God but the fact is they the trustees and deons are going to have to keep an eye on things because some people don't seem to want to do what is right unless the cop is standing on the corner right and then they're going to do what is right so they need some to have the cop just standing there right praise God hallelujah because you're in a different Society all right will take you to some of the church
