[1:03] for the rest of the week i would
[1:06] encourage you
[1:07] to read chapters
[1:10] 16 and 17
[1:15] of first samuel as
[1:18] those chapters outline they
[1:22] call an anointing of david as king
[1:27] as well as his battle with goliath
[1:32] may god richly bless us all together
[1:36] as we come together in his name
[1:41] reading from the scriptures
[1:45] first samuel 16
[1:48] 11 to 13
[1:52] and samuel said unto jesse
[1:56] are here all thy children
[2:00] and he said there remain it
[2:03] yet the youngest
[2:06] and behold he keep it sheep
[2:10] and samuel said on to jesse
[2:14] send and fetch him for we will
[2:18] not sit down till he come hither
[2:23] and he sent and brought him in now
[2:26] he was ready and little of
[2:30] a beautiful countenance and
[2:33] goodly to look at look to
[2:36] and the lord said arise
[2:41] anoint him this
[2:44] is he then samuel took the horn of
[2:49] oil and anointed him in the midst of his
[2:53] brethren
[2:54] and the spirit of the lord came upon
[2:57] david
[2:58] from that day forward so samuel rose up
[3:03] and went to rama
[3:06] praise god hallelujah
[3:09] our gracious heavenly father loving god
[3:14] we pray that the great holy spirit will
[3:18] bless us together
[3:20] as we bring our hearts our
[3:23] thoughts our minds in the great
[3:26] fellowship of this mystery
[3:30] meeting with you lord having
[3:33] a time of fellowship and the breaking of
[3:36] the word of bread
[3:38] of prayers of worship of thanksgiving
[3:42] to thy great and glorious name

[4:04] are lord as a part of you
[4:08] expressions of the word of god
[4:13] amen in jesus name we ask your
[4:16] blessing amen
[4:20] well praise god uh
[4:24] now in the nation of
[4:27] jordan i
[4:30] visited the
[4:33] hidden city it's also a lost
[4:37] city that was discovered and that
[4:42] is the city called petra
[4:47] one one movie made
[4:50] uh about indiana jones
[4:54] was actually made
[4:57] at the temple that is in petra
[5:04] so the filming took place there
[5:08] now the memory and scenery of that is
[5:11] is vivid and clear in my mind's eye
[5:17] on that trip i also visited
[5:22] the ancient nation of israel
[5:27] i walk the walls of
[5:30] the city of jerusalem
[5:36] and in walking on those walls i
[5:40] came to king david's citadel
[5:46] of course king david as you know
[5:50] was israel greatest
[5:54] warrior king i would say
[5:58] he uh seems or was
[6:01] or is the founder of that nation
[6:06] in the sense that his wars his battles
[6:10] laid the foundation for this nation
[6:14] of israel and he has a connection
[6:18] with that nation that is
[6:21] unbreakable to this very day
[6:27] now in 1st samuel chapter 16 verses 1
[6:30] to 13. we see the time lesson
[6:36] meaningful story of how
[6:40] a boy david
[6:43] who was about 16 years old at the time
[6:50] was elected by jehovah
[6:55] then because he was not
[6:59] on the scene he was called
[7:02] by his father
[7:06] and when he got to his father's house
[7:09] as the scriptures have said he
[7:12] was chosen by
[7:16] the prophet samuel and
[7:20] then anointed to be
[7:23] king of all israel
[7:28] now in first samuel chapter 17
[7:34] we see the challenge by the
[7:38] philistine goliath of goth and
[7:44] we also see it recorded in the
[7:47] scriptures
[7:49] god's response to goliath's challenge
[7:54] came true the boy david
[8:00] god used david
[8:03] to meet the challenge of that hour
[8:07] and may i say my friends
[8:12] you are never too young for god to use
[8:15] you
[8:17] you may be 16 or 60
[8:20] and god will still use you
[8:24] for when the challenge of the hour comes
[8:28] as it has in our day
[8:31] our god has promised that
[8:34] he will raise up a standard against
[8:38] satan and against all of his works
[8:43] and so my friends it's
[8:47] in the scriptures god
[8:50] using just a young person
[8:54] a young david
[8:57] a young maiden a young lady
[9:00] down in syria anointed to
[9:03] advise a general that was there that he
[9:08] could have
[9:09] his cleansing from leprosy in the time
[9:13] of elisha the same god
[9:17] used esther a young woman
[9:21] he also used danielle who was just about
[9:25] 18 years old
[9:28] and became prime minister
[9:31] of babylon there was joseph of course
[9:36] in in egypt and then there was mary
[9:40] who was just another teenager that gave
[9:44] birth to jesus the christ
[9:48] so to you young people especially at
[9:51] this time
[9:53] i want you to know you are not
[9:56] just warming a seat in a church
[10:01] you're not sitting and listening to me
[10:03] in your home
[10:04] as a pastime or as a tradition
[10:08] but i want you to know god
[10:11] wants to use you and god can
[10:14] use you god will use you just as
[10:18] much as he used king david
[10:23] of course king david in
[10:26] type is a type
[10:31] of the little nation of israel
[10:35] who has to face the goliaths
[10:39] of this age and of every age
[10:44] also david is a type
[10:48] of god's little flock
[10:51] his little group of believers
[10:54] you may have the worldwide church but
[10:56] out of that
[10:58] god has a little flock a faithful few
[11:03] and david is a type
[11:06] of that little flock also
[11:10] david is a type of you
[11:13] as an individual that god
[11:16] will use you for his glory
[11:20] yes there
[11:23] in the hot and rocky
[11:27] mountains and hills
[11:30] of israel i can see a young lad
[11:36] who was sent to take his brother's
[11:39] meals to the battlefield
[11:43] where they were all massing
[11:47] for the great war israel
[11:50] against the hosts
[11:54] armies of the philistines the saints
[11:59] i can see david
[12:02] with his shepherds clothing on
[12:06] staff in his hand and the lunch
[12:10] or the meals in his other hand
[12:15] and i can see him as he approaches the
[12:17] army
[12:20] and he stops and looks
[12:23] and he could see the mounds of earth
[12:27] he could see my friends
[12:30] all the bulwarks that were being set
[12:33] up against the enemy
[12:38] he could see men pushing
[12:41] rushing moving all around
[12:44] that army camp digging
[12:47] foxholes and preparation
[12:50] for the war which was imminent
[12:54] for one army was was uh there
[12:57] on one mountain and the other army was
[13:01] sparked
[13:04] on the other mountain and in the middle
[13:07] was the valley
[13:11] david being a young boy
[13:15] no doubt he felt no sense of danger
[13:18] when you're young that's the way it is
[13:22] he felt excited he felt fortunate
[13:26] that as a lad he was
[13:30] allowed to go in the middle
[13:34] of the army of israel
[13:37] with these grizzled uh soldiers
[13:41] these warriors he was fortunate within
[13:45] himself
[13:45] to be able to be allowed to go there
[13:50] oh praise god he must have thought to
[13:53] himself
[13:54] oh my all these
[13:57] tents scattered over the mountain side
[14:00] all these warriors these
[14:04] these are the army of
[14:07] israel hallelujah and as he looked
[14:12] he could see soldiers marching in
[14:15] formation
[14:17] he could see man parading
[14:22] and preparing others he could see
[14:27] polishing their weaponry
[14:31] and practicing with various
[14:35] implements of war
[14:39] bowls and arrows spears
[14:43] and swords no doubt they were fencing
[14:46] and and trying different techniques of
[14:50] war of
[14:51] how to kill a man to see who was the
[14:54] most skillful
[14:55] my friends uh getting themselves already
[15:00] and i believe that we can see our day in
[15:04] that picture
[15:06] there's a lot of religious parading
[15:08] going on
[15:09] there's a lot of religious uh
[15:13] practicing going on religious practice
[15:17] uh taking place uh there's a lot of
[15:20] people going to
[15:21] schools and geologies and
[15:24] taking on theology seminaries whatsoever
[15:27] and doing a lot of polishing polishing
[15:31] up their
[15:32] bible knowledge polishing up their spare
[15:35] their shields
[15:37] polishing up their swords polishing
[15:40] up everything oh my but no
[15:43] true warriors rugged warriors
[15:47] to be really found amongst them
[15:50] oh praise god oh all he could see
[15:54] was a lot of pretty uh uh polished up
[15:58] but not ready for battle soldiers
[16:02] yes they had on the arma yes
[16:05] a lot of people have the christian uh um
[16:09] armor on they they have on the
[16:13] the uniform of christianity
[16:16] and they have all the swords that their
[16:18] practice their
[16:20] fencing and their spear how they would
[16:22] stab the
[16:23] enemy and everything like but my friends
[16:26] that's parading that is practice
[16:29] that is learning systems and formation
[16:33] that is getting yourself ready for
[16:35] battle
[16:36] but you know let me refer back to the
[16:39] fact
[16:41] that i once had in my congregation
[16:46] uh a great soldier of the last war
[16:50] matter of fact he was the
[16:53] guard for several german generals
[16:58] very trusted and a very
[17:01] uh a real soldier
[17:05] and each remembrance day
[17:08] here in canada we would ask him
[17:12] to see a few words to speak
[17:15] something of his experiences
[17:18] and of the war and he would
[17:22] happily stand up and give
[17:25] his marvelous testimonies
[17:29] and one time he spoke telling
[17:32] us that he was always amazed
[17:36] at how there would be men that he was
[17:40] well aware of and how that they would
[17:44] be the best shot when they were
[17:48] parading when they were in practice
[17:52] before the war really started they
[17:55] they were crack shots they were the best
[17:58] marchers there were
[17:59] they were the best uh in fighting they
[18:02] were the best of
[18:03] this or best of that he says but you
[18:06] will be
[18:07] surprised that when the war
[18:10] started and the bombs began to drop and
[18:14] the bullets began to fly
[18:16] and the shots begin to go past your ear
[18:19] he said some of those fellas that were
[18:22] so
[18:23] well schooled well practiced
[18:26] the best on parade they will drop
[18:29] their weapons and run and try to
[18:33] hide their knees would be knocking they
[18:36] would be afraid they don't
[18:38] know what to do and some of those men
[18:42] that were thought that there were no
[18:44] real soldiers because they didn't have
[18:46] any real style to them
[18:49] no great spit and polish and
[18:52] they were not the best shots and
[18:54] everything else
[18:55] but one thing they had grit
[18:58] they had toughness they were of the rare
[19:02] breed
[19:03] that were ready to stand rather that
[19:06] they'd rather stand like a man and die
[19:09] or
[19:10] praise god or even if they have to go
[19:13] down they were going to go down
[19:15] fighting they're not going to just go
[19:17] lay down or
[19:18] get just fearful and be turned into a
[19:22] piece of jelly or jellyfish
[19:26] no sir there were warriors there were
[19:29] fighters
[19:29] men that meant business and that's the
[19:32] way
[19:33] we are to be because in the day in which
[19:36] we're living
[19:38] there's too much of this spit and polish
[19:42] too much of this it's got to be
[19:44] religiously right
[19:46] i'm not saying politically correct i'm
[19:49] taking
[19:49] that thought bringing it over and saying
[19:52] they want to be religiously correct
[19:54] in everything that they do every
[19:57] i dotted every t cross every
[20:01] quote in place everything perfect
[20:04] well that looks perfect all
[20:08] beautiful to behold marvelous
[20:11] but when the battle starts that's
[20:14] another matter
[20:15] oh my one time violin in
[20:20] in this message preaching the word of
[20:23] god
[20:24] under the anointing of the holy spirit
[20:27] and the holy spirit of god fell glory to
[20:31] god
[20:32] demons screamed and began to come out
[20:35] the holy ghost fell upon the church of
[20:38] the living god
[20:39] the holy spirit began to move and god
[20:42] began to deliver the people
[20:44] and do wonderful things amongst them at
[20:47] the end of the service
[20:49] that preacher says oh brother i don't
[20:52] know what happened there
[20:53] but when when that started
[20:57] i just felt something go down my
[21:00] spine i was so nervous
[21:03] i was so scared i didn't know what to do
[21:07] of course i was very surprised because
[21:10] as a man of god the sermon of god
[21:13] knowing being led by the spirit to deal
[21:16] with these
[21:17] the supernatural beings uh
[21:21] working their evil works in the midst of
[21:24] the house of god
[21:26] amongst the people of god the devil has
[21:29] polished himself
[21:30] so much that he's come in with sheep's
[21:33] skin
[21:33] looking like believers talking like
[21:36] believers acting like believers
[21:38] carrying on like if he's a soldier
[21:40] wearing the uniform
[21:42] oh perfection he's got that
[21:45] down pat and he can deceive your eyes
[21:49] you naturalize if you don't know
[21:52] what you're doing and if the holy spirit
[21:55] doesn't have
[21:56] control over you my friends
[21:59] i say in this day we need warriors
[22:04] we need warriors of god that will
[22:08] take up this gospel fight without
[22:11] fear without partiality without favor
[22:14] amen and will carry the battle to the
[22:18] devil
[22:18] to the his very doorsteps
[22:21] hallelujah praise god forevermore
[22:26] here was little david
[22:29] with his sling and his brother's lunch
[22:34] going down to that army
[22:38] not knowing that god
[22:41] had a plan for him
[22:45] because on the other hill
[22:48] was a great man called
[22:51] great in the sense of science called
[22:54] goliath you say well
[22:58] brother simon who is goliath
[23:01] well goliath was from a family of
[23:04] giants for he himself
[23:08] was a giant it is said
[23:12] that he was six cubits tall
[23:17] which is to say over ten feet tall
[23:22] and he had a coat of mail on
[23:27] and that coat of mail that he walked
[23:29] around with
[23:30] all day was 125 pounds
[23:36] in the heat of the met of
[23:39] of the middle east he walked around
[23:42] all day with that caught on
[23:46] and that was nothing to him for he was
[23:49] over 10
[23:50] feet tall and here he was
[23:55] with his spear that was about 14
[23:58] feet long and it is said according to
[24:02] the scriptures
[24:04] that his spare head was about
[24:07] 15 pounds heavy
[24:11] yes he was a giant among men
[24:16] and he had five brothers that were also
[24:20] giants and here
[24:24] we see goliath stepping out
[24:27] from the philistine army
[24:31] and coming down holding his great spear
[24:37] and saying choose you a man to fight me
[24:42] choose a man to come fight me
[24:47] i want to fight a man of israel
[24:51] well he was a giant
[24:55] then but i'm telling you we are faced
[24:58] with a lot of giants today
[25:01] not only giants and size
[25:04] but mainly giants in intellect
[25:09] giants of theology
[25:12] giants of human knowledge
[25:15] giants of religion and religious
[25:19] knowledge my friends and they are
[25:22] armed with diplomas
[25:25] armed with all kinds of certifications
[25:29] armed and shielded by their
[25:33] organizations
[25:34] shielding them being around them in
[25:37] every way
[25:38] their spears are their reach of
[25:42] influence or their sphere
[25:45] of influence my friends is so
[25:49] prodigious so far-reaching that it would
[25:52] strike fear
[25:54] in the hearts of many to approach some
[25:57] of these men
[25:59] and call them to attention of god's word
[26:03] and they give off that kind of aura
[26:07] to produce that kind of influence
[26:10] shielded by their organization and
[26:14] armed with their diplomas which they
[26:16] believe
[26:17] gives them their credibility
[26:20] and there they are
[26:23] hearing this great giant
[26:27] coming down and saying
[26:31] choose you a man to fight against me
[26:35] little did he know that god already knew
[26:39] all that was going to happen and god had
[26:42] already
[26:43] chosen a man and that man
[26:46] was no other than king david
[26:50] the devil of this age might be saying
[26:53] choose you
[26:54] a man to come down and fight against me
[26:58] but god always raises up a standard
[27:02] against the enemy
[27:03] and i believe our god already has
[27:07] raised up a people to meet the challenge
[27:10] of this day
[27:12] and of this hour for his glory and for
[27:15] his
[27:16] honor hallelujah oh my for david
[27:20] his heart began pumping
[27:24] oh my the excitement of the oncoming
[27:28] battle
[27:28] was right there hallelujah amen
[27:32] oh my he heard those words it didn't
[27:36] make him become fearful it made him
[27:40] want to do something for the glory of
[27:43] god
[27:44] but he to him he wasn't a theologian to
[27:47] him
[27:48] he was not a great church person to him
[27:51] he was not the having dd's lld's or
[27:55] uh trained and all these systems of
[27:58] marketing and business and
[28:00] uh and public relations and
[28:04] uh administrations and whatnot oh he was
[28:07] not so
[28:08] he he just stood back and oh there are
[28:11] great warriors here
[28:13] on the king saul there are great
[28:16] warriors
[28:16] they are able to go to battle and to
[28:19] fight
[28:20] this fight for the nation of
[28:23] israel but when he looked around
[28:29] to his surprise he saw
[28:32] some men some soldiers
[28:35] putting their head between their knees
[28:40] others were ducking behind
[28:44] tents some were sitting there
[28:49] trying to stop their knees from knocking
[28:52] because the knees were knocking so much
[28:54] they couldn't even stop it
[28:57] by holding it with their hands
[29:00] others their teeth were chattering in
[29:03] their
[29:04] in their mouth yes sir
[29:07] and they were scared sometimes that even
[29:10] slapped themselves to see
[29:12] if they can come to their right mind
[29:15] but the pharaoh of man was upon them
[29:19] the fear of goliath was upon them
[29:22] and today it seems the fear of satan
[29:26] evil and sin is upon them fear
[29:30] of the world the rulers of this world oh
[29:33] my friends
[29:34] it seems to be upon the people until
[29:37] they
[29:38] begin to back off and back away
[29:41] from the word of the living god who has
[29:44] called them to himself amen
[29:47] oh my david
[29:51] when he runs down there and says come on
[29:53] fellas let's go and get
[29:55] rid of this this man let's get him
[29:58] out of there how dare he says that
[30:02] choose a man from amongst you and he's
[30:05] going to
[30:05] defeat you oh my oh
[30:09] to his surprise
[30:12] those soldiers not me

[32:56] seen army the known army
[32:59] the one that can be perceived you may
[33:02] not even be
[33:03] counted that you are one of them but god
[33:06] has a seen a visible and god has an
[33:11] invisible army you remember the time at
[33:14] elisha
[33:15] when the syrians were coming against him
[33:18] and the young man got scared and said my
[33:21] lord
[33:22] look at these syrians they're coming
[33:25] against us
[33:26] and he says never mind don't be fearful
[33:29] they are more with us than those
[33:32] that are against us and then he said
[33:35] lord
[33:36] open the young man's eyes let him see
[33:40] and he looked and the bible said he saw
[33:43] a horse of angels
[33:45] hovering above those syrians ready to
[33:49] charge down upon them let me tell your
[33:52] friends
[33:52] greater is he that is in you than he
[33:55] that is in the world
[33:57] greater in number are they that
[34:00] are with us than they that are against
[34:04] us
[34:05] amen god is bigger than
[34:08] any of the circumstances that may come
[34:12] against you
[34:13] glory to god in your eyes
[34:16] that circumstance looks like a giant
[34:19] but in the eyes of god it's less than an
[34:22] ant
[34:23] it's less than a drop in a bucket to him
[34:26] nothing is impossible with god and
[34:29] greater is he
[34:30] that is in you than he that is in the
[34:34] world thank you lord jesus
[34:36] hallelujah praise god amen
[34:40] glory to god one time
[34:43] israel was marching from the city of
[34:47] jericho
[34:48] a small nation oh they look like a
[34:52] ragtag
[34:53] group of people aggressive great big
[34:56] civilization
[34:57] and yet god says much around seven times
[35:01] go around it for seven church ages
[35:04] then lift up your voice on the eighth
[35:06] day shout for the lord god has given you
[35:10] the city
[35:10] shout glory to god for god has given you
[35:13] the city
[35:14] israel shouted the earth shut the walls
[35:17] shut
[35:18] and the walls of jericho came
[35:21] tumbling down to the ground they charged
[35:24] in
[35:24] and took the victory for the glory of
[35:27] god
[35:28] and so can we so will we today
[35:31] if we trust and believe the word of god
[35:34] and the promise of this hour that we
[35:37] will
[35:38] chase the devil out of our lives our
[35:41] homes our churches
[35:42] every situation that he tries to insert
[35:46] himself into for the glory and praise
[35:48] that god will drive him out amen
[35:51] glory to god hallelujah david said
[35:55] yes i can with god's help i can
[35:59] and my friends that news travels like
[36:03] wildfire
[36:05] i'm telling you nobody
[36:09] not even king saul himself wanted to go
[36:12] out and fight against that giant
[36:16] so when one little no name
[36:20] nobody untrained rough and uncouth
[36:25] boy comes saying i'm
[36:28] ready to go to battle against this giant
[36:32] the news spread like wildfire
[36:35] and came the word came to the tenth of
[36:39] saul
[36:39] and so i said bring him bring him
[36:41] quickly bring him now
[36:42] i want to have a man like that that's
[36:45] willing to grow
[36:46] somebody that has the courage to go
[36:50] amen hallelujah we will have him do it
[36:55] you know even if we get the naive
[36:58] thinking that
[36:58] david was naive even if we got a naive
[37:02] young boy that wants to go out there
[37:05] we will send him out us as a sacrifice
[37:09] let him go out and suck what a great
[37:12] thing he will be doing
[37:13] to sacrifice himself for his nation
[37:17] and then we can we can go back with
[37:21] with some kind of semblance of having
[37:24] uh parts of the army at least went to
[37:27] defend us
[37:28] oh my so he called for david
[37:33] when he pulled the flaps of his tent and
[37:35] he looked out
[37:37] he thought he was going to see a great
[37:40] arnold schwarzenegger
[37:43] when he looked out he thought he'd see a
[37:45] johnson
[37:47] he thought he would see a miss mr
[37:50] olympia
[37:51] oh my yes when he looked
[37:55] what did he see a 16 year old boy
[38:01] that weighed between 90 and 125 pounds
[38:07] standing there with the sling in his
[38:10] hand
[38:12] and he says he's going out to fight
[38:15] against goliath
[38:17] well even if we have to send him out
[38:22] as a matter of form at least i can lend
[38:26] him my
[38:26] arm so saul took his
[38:30] arm of the armor of king saul
[38:33] and he offered it to david and said
[38:36] guard it put it on
[38:38] and go out to meet uh goliath
[38:41] so at least you will have some measure
[38:44] of protection oh my
[38:47] we know david of course knew that his
[38:50] real protection
[38:52] was from the great jehovah lord of
[38:55] sabbath
[38:56] o praise god the great lord of hosts
[39:00] the god of armies amen and so
[39:04] but david for the king's sake put on the
[39:07] armor
[39:08] and tried to walk out of the tent with
[39:11] it i can imagine what a funny looking
[39:14] scene that was
[39:16] 16 year old boy trying to put on the
[39:19] full armor
[39:20] of a man a six foot for tall
[39:23] saul was the tallest of them in israel
[39:27] and he was over six feet and here he
[39:30] was putting on the armor on a little boy
[39:34] that might have been just
[39:36] five feet four or five feet six
[39:39] and uh him trying to struggle out there
[39:42] with it
[39:43] and he felt so uncomfortable
[39:46] the bible said he refused the armor
[39:50] and told them to take it off he'd rather
[39:52] to go out there
[39:55] in the name of the lord with the spirit
[39:57] of the lord
[39:58] that should be the desire of every
[40:01] believer
[40:02] to go out praise god i'm speaking about
[40:05] king david
[40:06] the boyhood of king david going out the
[40:10] war to battle
[40:12] in the name of the lord glory to god
[40:15] hallelujah
[40:16] amen saul said david
[40:19] you don't understand war
[40:23] you're just a shepherd and i'm telling
[40:26] you i'm a real
[40:27] warrior and you've got to wear
[40:31] some armaments you got to have some
[40:33] diplomas
[40:34] you got to allow us to ordain you you
[40:38] gotta allow us to give you a a d d a
[40:41] ph.d
[40:42] so you can get some of the respects of
[40:44] the people
[40:45] we gotta give you a doctorate or or
[40:48] something
[40:48] some something that you you can catch
[40:51] the people's
[40:52] eyes but that was not for david
[40:56] god's anointing god's holy spirit
[41:00] upon his life was going to be the
[41:03] attraction
[41:04] of the hour amen the god's
[41:07] spirit the glorification of the lord
[41:11] jesus christ
[41:12] would be the magnetic pole that will
[41:16] cause men to lift up their eyes to jesus
[41:20] and see jesus only glory to god
[41:23] hallelujah
[41:24] amen so david said no
[41:28] no king saul right there
[41:31] is where you are mistaken
[41:35] i may be a boy
[41:39] but i'm not just a shepherd i am
[41:42] more than a shepherd
[41:46] hallelujah because
[41:49] i remember a day when i was with the
[41:53] sheep
[41:54] out in the field and my
[41:58] father sent and called me home
[42:01] when i got home there was a man
[42:04] called samuel and he was in our living
[42:08] room
[42:09] and the moment he saw me his eyes
[42:12] lit up he stared at me
[42:16] and came to me with a horn of oil
[42:20] and poured the oil upon my head
[42:23] i can still feel that oil glory god
[42:27] flowing from my head down no
[42:30] my clothing right on down
[42:33] amen hallelujah and i'm not
[42:37] just a shepherd i'm telling you king
[42:40] saul
[42:40] i'm not just a shepherd because
[42:44] i remember a day while i was watching
[42:47] the sheep
[42:49] a lion came out and he came
[42:52] after those sheep
[42:55] and when i was wondering what i'm going
[42:59] to do
[43:00] i suddenly began to feel something
[43:03] moving
[43:04] within my heart i
[43:07] grabbed that lion before i can think and
[43:10] we had us a battle
[43:11] out there amen hallelujah
[43:14] and now when i think about it my
[43:18] old mother has a lion
[43:21] skin coat at home
[43:24] to keep her warm in the winter time
[43:27] no king saul i'm not just a shepherd
[43:32] oh praise god another time
[43:36] while i was out in the field a bear came
[43:40] and he thought that he was going to take
[43:43] my sheep away
[43:45] but the spirit of the lord came upon me
[43:49] i had a battle with that bear and i
[43:52] tell you that i slew that bear
[43:55] in the name of the lord king saul
[43:58] i am not just a shepherd hallelujah
[44:02] i am the lord's anointed for this hour
[44:07] for this moment for this thing that is
[44:10] taking place
[44:11] in this day and in this hour i've been
[44:14] anointed for
[44:15] this time and i come here in the
[44:19] name of the lord and to the glory of the
[44:22] living god
[44:23] because the same god
[44:26] gave me the lion the same god
[44:31] that gave me the bear that
[44:34] same god will give me this
[44:38] uncircumcised philistine within my
[44:41] hands for his glory give me the victory
[44:45] amen hallelujah you see my friends
[44:49] david knew who he was david was
[44:53] certain of god regardless of who you
[44:57] are if you are a true believer

[46:30] and he sent a prophet in my day my
