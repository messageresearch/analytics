[2:57] that fear him and his righteousness unto
[3:00] the children's

[39:55] uh thought of seeing our part in the
[39:58] word of God we want to we want to uh

[40:03] scriptures and quotes that you may have
[40:05] heard and you may have read so many
[40:08] times over and over again that's great
[40:11] but when the Holy Spirit wants to
[40:13] minister to the body in a particular way
[40:18] and wants to um you know instill certain
[40:21] Faith then we then we uh receive
[40:25] inspiration and God speaks to us and
[40:28] reveals personally yes where we fit in
[40:32] the whole program of God there's nothing
[40:35] new Under the Sun that's right but the
[40:39] holy spirit makes all things new amen
[40:42] when he wants to and he can do things
[40:46] that go beyond our own you know ways of
[40:49] thinking and we're and remember you're
[40:51] still only human and humans forget
[40:56] but thank God that he reminds us and he
[41:01] reminds us over and over again praise
[41:03] God so this morning we're going to be uh
[41:06] just continuing from where we left off
[41:07] on Wednesday and then we're going to
[41:09] move on from there by the grace of God
[41:12] and so before we do let's just pray
[41:15] father we're so grateful this morning
[41:17] Lord you have a a a program you have a a
[41:20] plan it's all been from before the
[41:23] foundations of the world you had a way
[41:26] of of um organizing your plan and
[41:30] keeping it a mystery through all the
[41:33] ages Lord but yet in each age a portion
[41:37] of that mystery was made known and the
[41:39] individuals that could catch that
[41:41] thought and catch the understanding of
[41:44] their day it placed them into the body
[41:47] of Christ and it allowed them to put be
[41:49] put into action and to manifest and to
[41:53] fulfill the word for that day and here
[41:56] we are once again today Lord under that
[41:58] same Revelation under the anointing for
[42:02] this day and for this hour and your
[42:04] anointing is power it is the power of
[42:09] the church to accomplish and to have
[42:12] preeminence in all areas and so father
[42:16] may you take control now through the
[42:18] speaker and through each heer father and
[42:21] bless us and take us into Heavenly
[42:23] places in Christ Jesus we pray
[42:26] remembering our pastor as he ministers
[42:29] the word this morning in Africa may it
[42:31] come with great power and demonstration
[42:34] Lord speak to the needs there father and
[42:37] do a great work father as we give you
[42:39] all the praise the glory and the honor
[42:41] bring them safely home in Jesus name
[42:44] amen praise God let's go to the
[42:46] scripture 1 Corinthians 12 we read this
[42:50] on Wednesday night now concerning
[42:52] spiritual gifts Brethren I would not
[42:54] have you ignorant you know that ye were
[42:57] Gentiles carried away unto these dumb
[43:00] Idols even as ye were LED wherefore I
[43:03] give you to understand that no man
[43:05] speaking by the spirit of God calleth
[43:08] Jesus a cursed and that no man can can
[43:12] say that Jesus is the Lord but by the
[43:15] Holy Ghost now there are diversities of
[43:18] gifts but the Same Spirit God bless you
[43:22] you may be
[43:23] seated so you know when we're when we
[43:25] look at this scripture here and when we
[43:27] look at this thought like we said on
[43:28] Wednesday night we're seeing here that
[43:30] Paul is speaking to the Corinthian
[43:32] Church and they must have been in you
[43:34] know some sort of confusion because
[43:36] these gifts were obviously operating in
[43:39] their midst it was in it was in their
[43:42] midst they were operating but you know
[43:44] maybe Paul went there and the Holy
[43:45] Spirit showed Paul clearly that you know
[43:48] what there's a lot of people out of line
[43:50] here they don't have an understanding of
[43:53] these gifts and you know some of them
[43:55] were were were looking looking at it
[43:56] like competition well I can speak in
[43:58] tongues and you can't well I've got the
[44:00] the gift of Prophecy and you don't and
[44:03] so there was all kinds of confusion
[44:05] amongst them and that's why Paul had to
[44:08] come and literally rebuke them you know
[44:10] he would tell them listen I don't want
[44:12] you guys to be ignorant about these
[44:14] gifts because a lot of you are acting
[44:16] out of line you're not in your positions
[44:19] you're not understanding what it is that
[44:21] the word is actually asking of you and
[44:23] how it is that I am actually moving
[44:26] through these gifts that the holy spirit
[44:29] is the one that's moving through these
[44:31] gifts that they all operate by one
[44:35] spirit amen and having an understanding
[44:38] of that it it'll it'll it once you you
[44:41] clearly understand that it humbles you
[44:43] amen it brings you to a place where you
[44:45] realize that this is not something that
[44:48] that you earn you don't earn spiritual
[44:51] gifts amen you don't you don't earn them
[44:54] you don't uh you don't do anything to
[44:56] deserve them these gifts can operate at
[44:58] any time God can operate multiple gifts
[45:02] through one individual if he wants and
[45:04] God could use the least that's in the
[45:07] ministry that that may be the most quiet
[45:09] the one that you don't hear much from
[45:12] you don't see very much you know them
[45:14] trying to get into the Limelight but
[45:15] they've got a Ministry that is that is a
[45:18] solid Prayer Ministry that is supporting
[45:21] the ministry that is giving unction and
[45:24] giving an atmosphere and preparing in
[45:26] things for the spirit of God to come and
[45:28] move amen amen praise God and so we we
[45:32] need to understand these things and so
[45:35] when we're looking at these nine gifts
[45:36] we're going to move through this quite
[45:38] quickly um uh go to the next
[45:41] slide in the in the book of Corinthians
[45:43] it talks about nine spiritual gifts but
[45:46] actually there's a lot more gifts okay
[45:49] it's just how the Lord wants to um
[45:53] Empower each and every son and daughter
[45:56] of God to use them in some way and you
[46:00] know we were saying Wednesday that every
[46:02] single one of you Sons and Daughters of
[46:06] God have a gift amen there is something
[46:10] in you that God wants to bring to the
[46:13] surface he wants to use you he wants to
[46:16] manifest through you he wants you to
[46:19] recognize it because by you recognizing
[46:22] your gift and how it is that you edify
[46:25] by the body of Christ God gives you
[46:28] perfect faith God gives you rapturing
[46:31] Faith God's going to give you something
[46:33] that that you can't you can't work it up
[46:36] on your own but when you're just moving
[46:38] under the Simplicity of the word and
[46:41] allowing the spirit of God to use you in
[46:43] that particular way in that particular
[46:45] way then then it edifies it nourishes
[46:49] and it builds the body of Christ amen
[46:51] praise God so when we look at these nine
[46:53] spiritual gifts we're just going to look
[46:55] at it we can see them in that they fall
[46:57] into three divisions okay just a way of
[47:00] expressing it and the first is the gifts
[47:03] of Revelation the word of wisdom the
[47:07] word of knowledge Discerning of spirits
[47:09] and then the gifts of
[47:11] inspiration the the that prophecy can
[47:14] come forth diverse tongues and
[47:17] interpretations of tongues when we look
[47:19] at um the gifts of power then we look at
[47:22] the gift of faith and we see the gift of
[47:25] healing and the working of Miracles so
[47:28] when we look at these three aspects and
[47:30] we start by looking at the gift of
[47:32] revelation we see that it is something
[47:34] that God
[47:35] reveals Revelation is Supernatural and
[47:39] it's revealed in certain ways and we
[47:42] know that Revelation is what the whole
[47:44] church is built on it's the foundation
[47:47] of it all without revelation of the gift
[47:52] it's just works that's why faith without
[47:57] works but Faith with works is powerful
[48:01] amen praise God so the word of wisdom
[48:05] and so when we look at these things it's
[48:06] a supernatural Revelation or
[48:09] insight into the Divine will and purpose
[48:13] often given by the spirit to solve some
[48:16] perplexing issues or situations within
[48:20] the body of Christ you know all of a
[48:22] sudden you know we're at a meeting and
[48:24] the Holy Spirit you know is talking and
[48:27] and and ministering through one of the
[48:30] brothers or even one of the sisters can
[48:32] a sister have a spirit of w a gift of
[48:35] wisdom of
[48:37] course it's listen this is all leading
[48:40] up to as this series progresses it's all
[48:43] leading up to us
[48:45] recognizing uh that we have to come into
[48:48] the fullness of Christ and the fullness
[48:51] of Christ is Adam and Eve back one again
[48:56] amen and Adam and Eve back one again is
[48:59] Jesus Christ in the fullness of his
[49:02] spirit amen praise God and so we need to
[49:06] understand that the gift of Revelation
[49:07] is what operates through it all amen but
[49:11] wisdom God can give wisdom to
[49:14] anybody and it's not something that you
[49:16] know you because you've studied so long
[49:19] and you're a Divine you know uh PhD and
[49:22] lldd and so forth and you've been to
[49:25] you've been in in a in a a a seminary
[49:28] for half your life and you've learned so
[49:31] much about the Bible to the point where
[49:33] you don't believe it anymore because
[49:35] you've intellectualized it so much that
[49:38] you don't believe in the Supernatural
[49:40] element anymore and you're missing that
[49:43] element of the
[49:44] supernatural but wisdom God's wisdom is
[49:48] Supernatural it gives it when it when he
[49:52] wants to give it to the situation that
[49:54] he wants to give it to
[49:56] it's a gift of being able to sort
[49:58] through facts and data and discover what
[50:01] needs to be done for the church that's
[50:04] an example of wisdom so when we meet and
[50:07] we're looking for direction of the Lord
[50:09] and we're looking you know for for the
[50:11] leadership to direct the church and move
[50:13] it in a certain direction we're looking
[50:15] for the wisdom of the Lord and the Lord
[50:17] can come and he can anoint and give
[50:20] wisdom to anybody in that meeting right
[50:26] keep yourself
[50:28] open to what God can do through your
[50:31] life then we look at the word of
[50:33] knowledge the word of knowledge is a
[50:35] supernatural revelation of divine
[50:38] knowledge or Insight in the Divine Mind
[50:41] Of God will uh will or plan of God to
[50:46] know things that could not be known of
[50:50] oneself so God in other words God
[50:53] decides to you know to lead a certain
[50:55] brother or sister to to you know to
[50:58] study in certain areas and while they're
[51:01] studying God is releasing Revelation and
[51:04] giving them Supernatural knowledge on
[51:08] how to deal with certain aspects now
[51:11] that could be an aspect of dealing with
[51:14] the finance of the church God can give
[51:17] knowledge and
[51:20] Supernatural understanding so that when
[51:22] you're dealing with the finance as a
[51:24] trustee through the church you're doing
[51:27] it by the knowledge and the spirit of
[51:29] God and not by your own intellectual
[51:32] ways and the way that you would you know
[51:34] want it to be or your ideas or or
[51:37] anybody else's ideas you want it
[51:39] according to the knowledge and the will
[51:41] of God there's a supernatural element to
[51:45] gifts remember that they are without
[51:50] repentance which doesn't mean that
[51:52] because somebody is is uh you know not
[51:55] you know like uh so spiritual okay or
[52:00] even come to a place where they've
[52:02] actually been birthed by the word of God
[52:04] that something of knowledge
[52:07] supernaturally can't be spoken through
[52:09] them it can happen it's happened in the
[52:12] scriptures and it's happened around us
[52:16] amen praise God that's why gifts and
[52:18] callings are without repentance amen
[52:21] Discerning of
[52:23] spirits okay um that's that's uh also a
[52:28] supernatural Revelation or insight into
[52:31] the Realms of the spirit
[52:33] realm okay and it's a gift that God
[52:35] places usually amongst the ministry
[52:38] there's always going to be individuals
[52:41] that will have the ability to discern
[52:43] Spirits usually these individuals move
[52:46] into offices most likely offices of
[52:50] ministry preaching Deacon Etc okay
[52:54] because God is not going to be the
[52:56] author of confusion God is not going to
[52:59] have you know lay members that are you
[53:02] know that are just you know like they're
[53:04] they're they're not listen when I say
[53:07] just lay members you are just as
[53:09] important as anybody else in the body of
[53:12] Christ let's make that clear I do not
[53:14] put any uh oh I I'm I've got more
[53:18] Revelation than you I'm higher than you
[53:20] I'm lower than you no sir that does not
[53:23] exist in this body amen what exists is
[53:26] the spirit of God but we need to
[53:29] understand that if the holy spirit is
[53:32] doing things in its proper order he will
[53:35] do it through the authorities of the
[53:38] ministry he's not going to have somebody
[53:41] that that's that's you know a a Sunday
[53:44] school teacher coming up and starting to
[53:46] rebuke the de uh the the the deacons or
[53:48] the trusties and and saying you know and
[53:51] no if you see something as a lay member
[53:54] any member you see something on an
[53:56] individual you pray for them and you
[53:59] pray that the holy spirit will move
[54:01] through the office that it needs to move
[54:03] through in order to deal with that
[54:06] particular spirit amen so God's not
[54:09] going to be the author of confusion and
[54:10] start to put you know uh that's how this
[54:13] that's how the devil Works he'll come
[54:15] and say well I got a I got a gift of
[54:17] discernment brother and you've got a
[54:19] demon of lust on
[54:22] you just walk right up to the person and
[54:24] and and and do something like that okay
[54:28] there's a way of dealing with
[54:31] everything and God's provided way will
[54:34] do it in a way that it will
[54:37] edify it will build it will correct in
[54:42] love it'll be done in such a way that
[54:44] it'll be really you will know that it is
[54:47] the spirit of God and you will you will
[54:50] be edified and strengthened by it amen
[54:54] praise God then we look at Gifts of
[54:56] inspiration Gifts of inspiration are
[54:58] things that where God supernaturally
[55:01] starts to reveal through prophecy and
[55:04] prophecy is something that you know that
[55:06] that the holy spirit will will speak and
[55:09] it will not be confusion it'll be facts
[55:12] it will not be something that um you
[55:14] know that that that somebody makes up
[55:17] because they feel inspired to you know
[55:20] to to say something because they think
[55:23] that that's the way things are going in
[55:25] the world and so I'm going to get up and
[55:27] I'm going to prophesy here youo Church
[55:30] Israel is this is going to happen to
[55:32] Israel that's going to happen to Israel
[55:34] and it's going to happen before the end
[55:36] of the month well listen if it's the
[55:38] Holy Ghost and it's true then it will
[55:42] come to pass exactly as it was spoken
[55:46] but if it doesn't come to pass you don't
[55:49] listen to that anymore that's right
[55:51] actually the church will correct it and
[55:53] put it in its place and say you need to
[55:56] be silent amen because that's the way
[55:59] that the holy spirit is going to deal in
[56:02] the body of Christ amen praise God
[56:05] hallelujah then we look at diverse kinds
[56:08] of tongues the supernatural utterance of
[56:11] other languages and this is still very
[56:15] real it's still active in the church
[56:18] it's still a part of the of the body of
[56:20] Jesus Christ but it moves under the
[56:23] inspiration of the Holy Spirit spirit
[56:25] and it is not confusion so we're not
[56:28] going to hear all kinds of speaking in
[56:31] tongues and then there not be any
[56:33] interpretation to it when it's in its
[56:37] proper order there will be the tongues
[56:40] and there will be the
[56:41] interpretation that's what Paul was
[56:43] rebuking them for because everybody was
[56:46] feeling self- edified by by speaking in
[56:49] tongues they felt and and this is what
[56:51] happened in in the in the Pentecostal
[56:53] movement that if you did not speak in
[56:55] tongues then you didn't have the Holy
[56:57] Ghost and this is absolutely false
[57:01] speaking in tongues is something that is
[57:03] of the spirit of God and it happens when
[57:06] God wants to send and speak a message to
[57:09] the church if you listen to brother
[57:11] brandham and you listen to many of the
[57:13] tapes you will hear there are speaking
[57:16] in tongues and immediately after that
[57:19] there will be an interpretation and this
[57:21] is the proper order and so we want to
[57:24] understand that we want to understand
[57:26] that that that speaking in tongues is a
[57:28] gift but it is in its proper order and
[57:31] if you only feel inspired to speak in
[57:34] tongues and there's and it's because
[57:36] you're you're you're so caught up in the
[57:39] spirit uh great but there but there
[57:41] should be an interpretation of it
[57:44] otherwise keep silent and it's always
[57:47] subject to the
[57:48] preacher it's not going to just stand up
[57:51] in the middle of preaching and decide
[57:53] that it's got a message that's going to
[57:54] over ride the preacher doesn't work that
[57:57] way amen praise God and then there's um
[58:02] uh interpretation of tongues well we've
[58:04] covered that it's a supernatural ability
[58:07] to interpret when the Holy Spirit speaks
[58:10] in tongues through another individual or
[58:12] even yourself you could have both you
[58:15] could speak it and you could interpret
[58:17] it because God gives you the
[58:18] interpretation on it amen praise God and
[58:22] then there's Gifts of
[58:23] power and these gifts of power Gifts of
[58:26] faith and this is a super like you know
[58:28] a gift of faith we know that that's a
[58:30] gift of Revelation that's something that
[58:32] that you that you have that you know but
[58:34] then there's there's that Faith where
[58:36] you know individuals like you'll often
[58:38] hear me say listen either you believe it
[58:40] or you don't in other words you either
[58:43] got the faith or you don't have the
[58:44] faith in this particular area and if you
[58:47] do not have the faith in that particular
[58:50] area then you leave it alone but God God
[58:53] could give you a gift of faith in a
[58:55] certain area like for example in the in
[58:57] the in the area of healing okay where
[59:00] God will move supernaturally when you
[59:02] pray for somebody because God's placed
[59:05] that gift in you which is healing all
[59:08] right but you've got a revelation on it
[59:10] God's placed it in you you know that it
[59:13] operates you see it operate okay and you
[59:16] know that it's not when you want it to
[59:18] operate but it's when he wants it to
[59:20] operate amen and so people with this
[59:23] gift of Faith they have such great
[59:26] confidence in the power and the promises
[59:28] of God that they can stand strong in
[59:31] their belief no matter what tries to
[59:34] shake them okay they can also stand up
[59:38] for the church for the body of Christ
[59:42] okay and for their faith in such a way
[59:45] as to defend and actually move the
[59:49] church forward because they have that
[59:51] Faith they have that boldness on them
[59:54] and now God can use them in evangelism
[59:56] God can use them in leadership God can
[59:58] use them in committees amen praise God
[1:00:02] Allelujah gift of healing again it's a
[1:00:05] supernatural element the healing of all
[1:00:08] manner of sickness by Supernatural power
[1:00:11] without human Aid or
[1:00:14] medicine that's what healing is and
[1:00:17] healing can can happen in a in a a very
[1:00:20] miraculous way which is the next one the
[1:00:24] work of Miracles usually Miracles you
[1:00:27] know when the Holy Spirit does a miracle
[1:00:29] it's usually pretty
[1:00:30] instant you'll see it happen and it
[1:00:33] happens quickly and you'll know that
[1:00:35] it's a miracle and and and it'll cause a
[1:00:38] stir God will use it to stir the church
[1:00:41] and to stir the faith of the people and
[1:00:43] get the people back you know excited
[1:00:46] about the moving of the holy spirit amen
[1:00:49] so Miracles are usually instant in
[1:00:51] nature and not explainable by man
[1:00:55] then you know there's all these other
[1:00:58] gifts Okay so we've covered the nine you
[1:01:01] know major spiritual gifts that are
[1:01:03] mentioned in the book of Corinthians
[1:01:06] okay but then there's other gifts and
[1:01:09] these are the helps within the ministry
[1:01:12] and these are where you know you're
[1:01:14] gifted in certain special ways and I'm
[1:01:16] just going to give some brief you know
[1:01:18] um examples and uh
[1:01:22] Administration this is a gift of
[1:01:24] administration the ability to help steer
[1:01:27] the church or a Ministry towards a
[1:01:30] successful completion of God's given
[1:01:33] goals with skills in planning organizing
[1:01:37] and
[1:01:38] supervising these are certain skills and
[1:01:41] ability and you'll know that you have
[1:01:44] this ability because you will be
[1:01:46] inspired to to to volunteer and to move
[1:01:51] into certain uh Avenues within the
[1:01:54] ministry
[1:01:55] you're not listen you're not called to
[1:01:58] this church to just be somebody that's
[1:02:00] going to fill a
[1:02:02] Pew get it straight right now this is
[1:02:06] going home time this is where the bride
[1:02:09] comes into the perfect Faith a perfect
[1:02:11] revelation of who they are where they
[1:02:14] fit into the body of Christ what they've
[1:02:17] been called to do and to watch the
[1:02:19] supernatural move through their lives
[1:02:23] amen there's a Supernatural church right
[1:02:26] now that's coming together that's going
[1:02:28] to go in a Rapture and she needs to have
[1:02:31] Revelation on the word of God and how
[1:02:33] the Rapture is going to fulfill itself
[1:02:36] in each and every one of our Lives amen
[1:02:38] and so there's Gifts of you know of
[1:02:41] missions you know Apostle a person sent
[1:02:44] into new places with the gospel you know
[1:02:46] we're we're experiencing it right now
[1:02:48] we're seeing the fruits of it even right
[1:02:50] now our pastor and and brother coffee
[1:02:53] and brother Desmond out on the mission
[1:02:55] Fields these are things that they've
[1:02:58] been doing for years it's it's obvious
[1:03:01] it's obvious that God has placed those
[1:03:04] gifts within our ministry because we
[1:03:06] have been able by the grace of God to
[1:03:08] raise churches in different parts of the
[1:03:11] world this ministry has built and raised
[1:03:14] churches in many different countries in
[1:03:16] the world Amen now it's not because that
[1:03:21] that that that that we decided to do it
[1:03:23] it's because because God places the
[1:03:25] gifts within the ministry and then God
[1:03:28] feeds all the Avenues that are required
[1:03:32] for those gifts to move into their
[1:03:34] positions and that's why missions when
[1:03:38] when when a minister is called to be a
[1:03:40] missionary an apostle an evangelist to
[1:03:42] go out God will move on both ends of
[1:03:47] that Ministry he will open the
[1:03:50] invitation doors and he will provide
[1:03:53] everything that you have need of in
[1:03:55] order to fulfill that arm of the
[1:03:58] ministry and we want to continue to
[1:04:01] support it we want to continue to to
[1:04:04] speak it to to open ourselves to the
[1:04:08] opportunities amen but we want it to be
[1:04:10] done in its proper order under the
[1:04:13] inspiration of the Holy Ghost and
[1:04:15] through the identified gifts that God
[1:04:19] has placed in this local
[1:04:22] body amen
[1:04:25] and so then you know the same thing for
[1:04:26] an evangelist the ability to
[1:04:28] successfully communicate the message of
[1:04:31] the hour amen and and do it in such a
[1:04:35] way that uh uh and especially to
[1:04:38] non-believers you know sometime like you
[1:04:41] know when when when you've got that you
[1:04:43] you'll just find yourself that you know
[1:04:44] you're talking to some people and before
[1:04:47] you know it you're on the word and
[1:04:49] you're you're you're you're being an
[1:04:50] evangelist and you don't even know it
[1:04:52] because you're sharing your testimony of
[1:04:54] how God can move how real God is how
[1:04:56] Supernatural God is God can change your
[1:04:59] situation you know brother Phillip you
[1:05:01] could be talking to one of your clients
[1:05:03] and they they've got a certain problem
[1:05:04] and a certain situation and his marriage
[1:05:06] is falling apart and he's talking to
[1:05:08] brother Phillip and brother Philip will
[1:05:10] say do you know that God can restore do
[1:05:12] you know that God Is A Healer God can
[1:05:15] heal your wife God can heal you God can
[1:05:17] take away those things do you believe
[1:05:20] those things I believe those things I've
[1:05:22] experienced those things I've seen it
[1:05:24] happen in my life you see you've got
[1:05:26] that that Evangelistic Spirit on you
[1:05:29] remember these are gifts that you could
[1:05:31] have many many gifts on you I want you
[1:05:34] to recognize where you feel the
[1:05:36] inspiration where you're feeling it
[1:05:38] where you're recognizing that God is
[1:05:41] using you at those particular times and
[1:05:44] you will know you'll know it feels good
[1:05:47] you feel energized when the spirit of
[1:05:50] God moves into a into a conversation
[1:05:52] you'll feel the atmosphere osphere it
[1:05:55] starts to tingle it starts to change
[1:05:58] around the individual you start to see
[1:06:00] that they're actually catching something
[1:06:02] and they're responding it's because God
[1:06:04] is actually speaking and wanting to deal
[1:06:07] with that P with that particular
[1:06:09] situation amen praise God uh you know
[1:06:12] the the gift of exhortation there's many
[1:06:14] of us here there's Gifts of exhortation
[1:06:17] in our midst I've seen it many times
[1:06:19] where where you know just just just an
[1:06:22] excellent gift of of of uh encouragement
[1:06:26] and and uh edifying and lifting up and
[1:06:30] you know and it discerns certain
[1:06:32] situations in your life and when it
[1:06:34] discerns it in your life it does it in a
[1:06:36] way that God you can you know that it's
[1:06:39] God you know that God wants to deliver
[1:06:42] you God is loves you cares about you and
[1:06:45] they can exort themselves in such a way
[1:06:48] that it you know it it Comforts it
[1:06:50] supports and especially someone that's
[1:06:53] down that God wants them you know to get
[1:06:56] back up again amen praise God and then
[1:07:00] there's the GI you know the gift of
[1:07:02] giving you know a giver a true Giver is
[1:07:05] somebody that when they give they have
[1:07:07] no expectation of getting it back that's
[1:07:11] you know like if you want you know you
[1:07:12] try to put a a definition on the on the
[1:07:15] on the gift of giving and you wonder how
[1:07:18] you know what is the evidence of the
[1:07:20] gift of giving well first of all God
[1:07:23] will make way for you to give amen and
[1:07:26] you'll know that that that God just
[1:07:29] blessed me what am I going to do God
[1:07:31] just poured out Another Blessing how can
[1:07:34] I you know like and I know that it came
[1:07:36] from the Lord amen I know it came from
[1:07:38] the Lord because I only did this I only
[1:07:40] did whatever I I could whatever I could
[1:07:43] possibly do and listen we need to do the
[1:07:46] things that we know we should and can do
[1:07:50] we can't be just sitting back and just
[1:07:52] waiting for money to fall from the
[1:07:55] sky or going to buy a lottery ticket and
[1:07:57] expecting that's going to be my ticket
[1:07:59] this
[1:08:01] week that's not how it works with the
[1:08:05] Lord when the Lord places that gift upon
[1:08:08] your life to give you will not have
[1:08:11] anything in your heart that you need it
[1:08:13] back you will give without the
[1:08:16] expectation you'll have a
[1:08:18] revelation that you know God says you
[1:08:20] try me and see if I don't open the
[1:08:23] windows of heaven and that Revelation in
[1:08:25] the back of your mind is saying
[1:08:27] hallelujah Lord I know you're going to
[1:08:29] open those windows I just because I see
[1:08:31] you doing it I see you doing it for
[1:08:33] others and I believe you can do it for
[1:08:35] me if you haven't experienced it yet and
[1:08:38] you're looking at others that are
[1:08:40] experiencing it and you're looking and
[1:08:41] say well why doesn't God do that for me
[1:08:43] it ain't coming your way you got the
[1:08:46] wrong attitude right off the bat that's
[1:08:48] not the spirit of giving the spirit of
[1:08:52] giving is something that when it's on
[1:08:53] you you're not afraid to give you're
[1:08:56] you're you're you're willing to even
[1:08:58] stretch sometimes to give when you can't
[1:09:01] give okay because you know that you you
[1:09:05] you know that it's part of your
[1:09:06] experience you're not looking to others
[1:09:09] to you know to to repay you you don't
[1:09:12] look at anything like that if if if
[1:09:15] you've got a spirit of giving upon you
[1:09:17] you'll do it and you will look for no
[1:09:21] you listen don't let your right hand no
[1:09:23] what your left hand is doing okay that's
[1:09:26] what the scripture says okay so there's
[1:09:29] you don't need to be uh doesn't need
[1:09:32] nobody needs to know that you're giving
[1:09:34] or that you're giving in this way or
[1:09:36] you're giving in that way you do it and
[1:09:39] you just let God do the rest Amen Let
[1:09:41] the Holy Spirit deal with everything
[1:09:43] else God knows exactly where the need is
[1:09:47] you know it's like we're it's like we're
[1:09:48] saying about you know the Christmas
[1:09:50] dinner there are individuals that may be
[1:09:52] going through you know a little short
[1:09:56] season okay we've all gone through those
[1:09:59] periods of life where all of a sudden
[1:10:01] you know that extra payment needed to be
[1:10:04] done or one of the kids needed a payment
[1:10:06] for college or university and this comes
[1:10:09] up and that comes up and all of a sudden
[1:10:10] at the end of the month you're saying
[1:10:11] holy smokes I'm
[1:10:13] short well listen the body of Christ we
[1:10:17] need to come into the Revelation because
[1:10:19] this is all around the gift of giving
[1:10:22] amen I haven't left that topic yet okay
[1:10:25] we need to come into the understanding
[1:10:27] of how the body of Christ the the
[1:10:30] scripture says that the body every joint
[1:10:35] supplieth the other joint there's a
[1:10:38] there's a way that God moves through the
[1:10:40] body of Christ that can supply all the
[1:10:44] needs that are within the ministry every
[1:10:47] son and daughter of God is important to
[1:10:49] God Amen and so when we have an
[1:10:52] understanding of that then we can have
[1:10:55] confidence we're not going to be the
[1:10:57] kind of people listen if you've got if
[1:11:00] you've got the wrong spirit and you're
[1:11:02] just going to take advantage and you're
[1:11:03] going to do things don't worry the holy
[1:11:06] spirit will deal with you in those areas
[1:11:09] we're not worried about those things
[1:11:11] okay you need to understand that there
[1:11:14] are times and Seasons when you cannot
[1:11:17] give you cannot do those things that you
[1:11:20] want to do and so the body of Christ is
[1:11:24] set up in such a way especially if the
[1:11:26] ministry that you're under is operating
[1:11:30] under that
[1:11:31] Revelation not every ministry will
[1:11:33] operate in that way especially in this
[1:11:36] level of of faith and understanding
[1:11:39] because there's a lot of churches out
[1:11:41] there that they operate and their giving
[1:11:44] is what they push all the time give give
[1:11:47] give give you're not going to hear that
[1:11:50] coming from this
[1:11:52] pulpit you're going to give by faith and
[1:11:55] by Revelation and when you do it that
[1:11:58] way it allows the supernatural to come
[1:12:00] on the scene and when there's times
[1:12:03] where you're short and you can't give
[1:12:06] the body will provide because the listen
[1:12:09] the body provides for itself when when
[1:12:12] the body listen when you get a bruise
[1:12:14] you ever notice that it you know you get
[1:12:16] this blue and black buildup that's a
[1:12:19] bruise that's because all of a sudden
[1:12:22] there's been some damage done in that
[1:12:24] area over a period of time you'll see
[1:12:27] that bruise disappear naturally you
[1:12:30] don't know how it's happening but it's
[1:12:32] happening and sometimes we come into
[1:12:34] times in our lives where we get bruised
[1:12:37] in a financial situation and we you we
[1:12:40] you know yeah maybe you even made a
[1:12:43] mistake but because of the Revelation
[1:12:46] that you get back up again in order for
[1:12:49] God to continue to use you and move you
[1:12:51] through that mistake you can get back up
[1:12:55] and God will provide a way for that
[1:12:58] bruise to come and be naturally healed
[1:13:02] thank you Jesus the body operates in
[1:13:05] such a miraculous way that it's it's
[1:13:08] just Supernatural it's tremendous and
[1:13:11] we're blessed to be a part of the body
[1:13:13] of Christ amen amen praise God and so
[1:13:16] there's giving then there's you know and
[1:13:18] then there's Hospitality there's
[1:13:20] individuals that are given to the gift
[1:13:22] of hospitality they know how to welcome
[1:13:24] people they know how to you know
[1:13:26] entertain people in a way that makes
[1:13:28] them feel welcome makes them feel that
[1:13:30] they're that they're a part of the body
[1:13:33] of Christ amen we want all these gifts
[1:13:35] to activate we want everybody to to move
[1:13:39] and get into a spirit you know every
[1:13:41] single one of us should have the spirit
[1:13:43] of hospitality I'm not talking about the
[1:13:46] gift but the spirit of hospitality just
[1:13:49] the simple way of greeting one another
[1:13:52] with a smile SM with a smile not a frown
[1:13:56] with a smile it's good to see you
[1:13:58] brother it's good to see you sister God
[1:14:01] bless you you know and and and it's it's
[1:14:04] hospitable it's just makes people feel
[1:14:07] welcome praise God amen glory to God
[1:14:11] hallelujah we're almost done with
[1:14:13] these a gift of Mercy there's you know
[1:14:16] there's there's Gifts of
[1:14:17] Mercy it's right in in in 1 Corinthians
[1:14:21] chapter 12 there you know when when you
[1:14:23] being merciful do it as as as the mercy
[1:14:26] of God because God is a merciful god God
[1:14:30] is not a judgment God all the time God
[1:14:34] is going to judge the Earth God is going
[1:14:36] to judge according to whatever is
[1:14:38] against his word but God is God has a
[1:14:42] heart of mercy and we should have a
[1:14:45] heart of Mercy we should be able to be
[1:14:48] compassionate and merciful to one
[1:14:50] another when we Fellowship when we when
[1:14:52] we Ed ify when we encourage one another
[1:14:55] amen it's it's uh you know this is
[1:14:58] definitely a trait of a person with
[1:14:59] great sensitivity for those who are
[1:15:02] suffering it manifests itself in
[1:15:06] offering compassion encouragement and in
[1:15:10] love for giving practical help to
[1:15:12] somebody that's in
[1:15:14] need
[1:15:17] amen
[1:15:18] serving a talent for identifying tasks
[1:15:22] needed for the body of Christ and using
[1:15:26] available resources to get the job done
[1:15:30] you know you will notice things within
[1:15:34] the body of Christ you will see things
[1:15:36] within the body of Christ where you know
[1:15:38] that you could help that you could serve
[1:15:40] and you can move into those positions

[1:17:58] see how many different Avenues and Gifts
[1:18:02] God has within the body of Christ amen
[1:18:06] praise God let's go to the
[1:18:08] next slide now we want to get into you
[1:18:12] know nobody listen to brother Braham
[1:18:15] speaking here three kinds of Believers
[1:18:17] we know that there's three kinds of
[1:18:18] Believers in every church it's
[1:18:20] unfortunate but it's just the way that
[1:18:21] it is all right right but God has a way
[1:18:24] of weaving out I believe if we work hard
[1:18:27] enough there's only going to be one
[1:18:30] super natural believing body of Jesus
[1:18:33] Christ in this church and when it
[1:18:35] happens the Miracles are going to happen
[1:18:37] one after the other healings are going
[1:18:39] to take place one after the other
[1:18:41] because Satan's power is going to be
[1:18:42] it's going to be he won't know who to
[1:18:44] use anymore because you know he needs to
[1:18:46] use somebody he'll use he'll use
[1:18:49] individuals right here within these
[1:18:51] walls to to try try and tear down but
[1:18:54] let's let's move on here nobody can take
[1:18:56] your place no matter how little you say
[1:18:59] I'm just a housewife yeah you're a
[1:19:02] powerful housewife if you've got the
[1:19:04] Holy Ghost amen you've got a
[1:19:06] Supernatural Ministry as a housewife if
[1:19:09] you've got the Holy Ghost because you
[1:19:11] can now pray for your husband you can
[1:19:13] pray for your children you can pray for
[1:19:15] the church you can pray for the
[1:19:17] preaching you are a supernatural
[1:19:20] housewife you're not just an ordinary
[1:19:22] housewife when you've got Revelation
[1:19:24] nobody can take your place amen God in
[1:19:28] his great economy has set so has so set
[1:19:33] so the body of Christ in order till
[1:19:36] there's no one can take your place
[1:19:39] that's important to understand Saints no
[1:19:42] one can take your place how I would like
[1:19:44] brother B says how I would like to take
[1:19:46] Billy Graham's place any of us ministers
[1:19:48] but we can't do it but just remember
[1:19:51] Billy can't take our Place amen listen
[1:19:55] there's Ministries out there I'm telling
[1:19:57] you I go sometimes I'm flipping through
[1:19:59] YouTube and I look at some of these
[1:20:00] Ministries that are out there and these
[1:20:03] guys are getting 800,000 views you know
[1:20:07] preachers you know uh they got they got
[1:20:09] two million
[1:20:10] followers it's it's remarkable you know
[1:20:13] and then I'll go in there and I'll you
[1:20:15] know I'll say you know what let me hear
[1:20:16] what this guy saying let me you know
[1:20:19] because it's if it's the word of God and
[1:20:21] I've got a revelation
[1:20:23] that I don't I don't I don't look at
[1:20:26] Flesh and Blood I look at the word of
[1:20:30] God and God has given me the Holy Ghost
[1:20:33] and he said I will lead you into all
[1:20:37] truth when the Holy Ghost is on you
[1:20:40] you're going to be able to discern truth
[1:20:42] and you're going to be able to feed on
[1:20:44] the truth and you'll be able to like
[1:20:45] brother Bram says spit out the pits amen
[1:20:49] but it's amazing these ministries of
[1:20:52] these individuals they're operating
[1:20:54] Ministries Worldwide they're bringing in
[1:20:58] hundreds of millions of
[1:21:01] dollars it's
[1:21:03] remarkable but then you listen and
[1:21:07] they're preaching on the
[1:21:08] Trinity they're preaching on things that
[1:21:11] are you know on on doctrines of their
[1:21:15] church if we're going to have a class
[1:21:18] 101 in this church for new believers
[1:21:22] then we are going to teach doctrines
[1:21:25] from the
[1:21:26] Bible not doctrines from the church amen
[1:21:31] praise God and so you know it's amazing
[1:21:33] but yet these individuals have a
[1:21:37] incredible Ministries Billy Graham had
[1:21:40] an amazing Ministry it was worldwide and
[1:21:43] and and It produced hundreds of millions
[1:21:46] of dollars in offerings and so forth but
[1:21:50] that was his ministry our ministry if
[1:21:54] you go back into the word of God and you
[1:21:57] see clearly how our ministry fit in the
[1:22:02] scriptures from Genesis to Revelation
[1:22:05] you will see that it is a Supernatural
[1:22:08] Ministry it is not governed by the
[1:22:11] doctrines of man it is LED and
[1:22:14] controlled by the leadership of the Holy
[1:22:18] Ghost and it'll always be that way see
[1:22:21] we all have a Place some of us are
[1:22:24] evangelists some
[1:22:27] prophets some
[1:22:28] teachers some pastors whatever we are
[1:22:32] some Housewives here he goes again some
[1:22:36] mechanics oh yeah brother Mike even
[1:22:38] mechanics in the body of Christ Oh yeah
[1:22:41] and when God wants to use that gift and
[1:22:44] raise it up in whatever way just like he
[1:22:46] did with brother Alvin there when we
[1:22:47] were having the the youth meetings and
[1:22:49] the power went out God had every
[1:22:52] everything ready to go Hallelujah
[1:22:55] because somebody was sitting in their
[1:22:58] position and were willing and and ready
[1:23:01] and yielded to the spirit of God to do
[1:23:04] certain things and just naturally does
[1:23:07] these things that's why the greatest
[1:23:10] gifts let me tell you are the ones that
[1:23:12] you will not see uh you know being
[1:23:16] projected or lifted up or anything like
[1:23:19] that but they are the ones that that
[1:23:21] really do things in the background
[1:23:23] because God is a humble God the spirit
[1:23:26] of God is is is surrounded in humility
[1:23:30] amen and when you've truly got a gift of
[1:23:32] God and it and it operates in your life
[1:23:35] you you will you will bring that that
[1:23:38] Spirit of Pride that tries to control
[1:23:41] because remember that the pride of life
[1:23:44] you know the lust of the eyes the lust
[1:23:46] of the flesh those three things will
[1:23:47] attack you over and over and over again
[1:23:51] but you need to to bring you need to
[1:23:53] bring those things that's where we
[1:23:55] overcome that's where we got
[1:23:58] to we just got to bite the tongue once
[1:24:01] in a while and just wait on the Lord let
[1:24:04] him come and give it in such a way that
[1:24:07] it's just going to it's going to be in
[1:24:09] an in an edification and it's going to
[1:24:11] build the body of Christ amen praise God
[1:24:14] we want that kind of a spirit of
[1:24:16] humility because that's how the Holy
[1:24:19] Spirit operates and these gifts usually
[1:24:22] a lot lot of times they won't be a
[1:24:24] public
[1:24:24] show they're not going to be a public
[1:24:27] show don't be looking for big public
[1:24:29] shows if God wants to do something
[1:24:31] Supernatural because he needs to bring
[1:24:33] somebody into the church and deliver
[1:24:36] them supernaturally like he did for me
[1:24:38] and like he's done for many of you in
[1:24:40] certain situations in your life to get
[1:24:42] your attention he'll do it amen but then
[1:24:45] he'll just move on and carry on with the
[1:24:47] program of God some mechanics some
[1:24:51] Farmers what Whatever It Is God has set
[1:24:54] you in your place see amen praise God
[1:24:58] let's go to the next slide in Romans
[1:25:01] chapter 12 just going to take a quick
[1:25:04] drink
[1:25:10] here in Romans chap 12: 1- 4 we see here
[1:25:17] speaking to the Romans he says I beseech
[1:25:18] you therefore Brethren by the mercies of
[1:25:21] God that you present your bodies a
[1:25:24] Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto
[1:25:28] God which is your reasonable
[1:25:31] service and be not conformed to this
[1:25:34] world but be ye transformed by the
[1:25:37] renewing of your mind that ye may prove
[1:25:40] what is that good and acceptable and
[1:25:43] perfect will of God there's a foundation
[1:25:47] to serving God and having a gift that is
[1:25:50] gonna that is gonna actually
[1:25:52] benefit the body of Christ and without
[1:25:55] the foundation and understanding of
[1:25:58] renewing of your mind and and feeding on
[1:26:01] the word and and and coming into the
[1:26:03] presence of the Lord and and
[1:26:05] fellowshipping around the word and and
[1:26:07] making sure you read your scriptures and
[1:26:09] your Bible every every day and listen to
[1:26:11] the messages listen to brother brandham
[1:26:14] listen to the to the to the preaching of
[1:26:16] the word you're you're constantly
[1:26:19] Renewing Your Mind when you're doing
[1:26:21] that okay because you forget that's why
[1:26:24] you you know you you you're going to
[1:26:26] hear things today that that you're going
[1:26:28] to say praise God hallelujah there it is
[1:26:30] right there in the scripture look for I
[1:26:32] say through the grace given unto me to
[1:26:36] every man that is among you not to think
[1:26:40] of himself more highly than he ought to
[1:26:43] think there it is right there you see
[1:26:45] how how you know how the the the gifts
[1:26:48] they have to operate in such a way
[1:26:50] because remember it it it edifies and it
[1:26:53] and it builds the body and it feeds
[1:26:56] itself so you are you are feeding and
[1:26:59] you are being fed in the body of Christ
[1:27:03] and so he doesn't he says don't don't
[1:27:05] think you're you're more High than than
[1:27:07] anybody else but to think soberly
[1:27:10] according as God has dealt to every man
[1:27:14] the measure of
[1:27:16] Revelation so you can't be anything more
[1:27:19] than what you are that's right and what
[1:27:22] what you are
[1:27:23] naturally and and what you do without
[1:27:28] trying that's the faith that that gets
[1:27:31] expressed through your life amen in your
[1:27:34] everyday living in your everyday
[1:27:36] fellowshipping in your everyday talk in
[1:27:39] the way that you work you know listen a
[1:27:42] person that is a that is a help in the
[1:27:44] church that is somebody that's good at
[1:27:47] you know uh leadership or good at you
[1:27:50] know organizing they're usually good at
[1:27:53] that at their workplace and at home they
[1:27:57] usually have that that that same aspect
[1:28:00] upon their lives and then God just
[1:28:03] triggers it as a gift in the body and
[1:28:06] all of a sudden the individual starts to
[1:28:08] get blessed they don't know why they
[1:28:10] just got a raise at work all I did was
[1:28:12] you know last week I went and did this
[1:28:14] at the church nobody knew about it but
[1:28:16] Lord all of a sudden the boss comes to
[1:28:17] me and he says I need to have an
[1:28:19] interview with you uhoh I'm in trouble
[1:28:21] no you're not you just got a raise you
[1:28:24] just got a promotion you just got moved
[1:28:26] because God Is providing your needs
[1:28:29] because now you have the revelation of
[1:28:32] him being your provider amen he's your
[1:28:37] boss he's who you work for not for for
[1:28:40] brother so and so or Pastor so and so
[1:28:43] I'm doing this for him and because I got
[1:28:46] that Revelation he's watching over me
[1:28:49] amen it just it just happens it's just
[1:28:51] natural amen so so God according to the
[1:28:55] measure of the faith that he's given you
[1:28:57] for as now watch it says here for for as
[1:28:59] we have many members in one body and all
[1:29:03] members have not the same office see God
[1:29:08] has given us particular individuals that
[1:29:12] are suited in the in the right way so
[1:29:15] that God can use it in the body to build
[1:29:18] to edify and to bring us to that place
[1:29:21] of full
[1:29:23] maturity which is the goal go to the
[1:29:26] next slide he says nobody can take your
[1:29:28] place and you shouldn't try to take
[1:29:31] anybody else's place it's as simple as
[1:29:34] that be yourself be what God made you to
[1:29:38] be do what you do listen if you've been
[1:29:41] doing it in the house of the Lord for
[1:29:43] the last 20 30 years or last 20 30 days
[1:29:46] whatever it is just keep doing it amen
[1:29:50] God will confirm vind indicate and if
[1:29:53] there's any problem in that area the
[1:29:55] holy spirit will deal with it if not
[1:29:57] just keep doing what you're doing
[1:29:58] because guess what it's blessing the
[1:30:01] body okay if you see certain situations
[1:30:04] happening they will interpret themselves
[1:30:07] it'll come up it'll it'll become visible
[1:30:10] the holy spirit will show it to the
[1:30:12] proper office within the ministry to
[1:30:15] deal with it in whatever way it needs to
[1:30:16] be dealt with and God will do it amen
[1:30:19] praise God he says because you are an
[1:30:22] individual to
[1:30:24] God and God has a purpose for you he
[1:30:29] made you thus you say why did he do it
[1:30:33] because he's Sovereign God knew the end
[1:30:36] from the beginning God knew you before
[1:30:38] you came to this earth God knew that you
[1:30:41] would come under a certain family under
[1:30:43] certain influences under certain
[1:30:46] atmospheres God knew all the things that
[1:30:49] you had to deal with in growing up but
[1:30:52] listen when God wants to call you and
[1:30:54] place you there's no demon in in hell
[1:30:58] that can stop it amen glory to God he
[1:31:01] says because God is not listen we're
[1:31:03] always going to be that way he's got a
[1:31:05] reason for for making you that way we're
[1:31:08] always going to be that way because God
[1:31:10] is not a Sears and robu Harmony
[1:31:13] House Hallelujah he doesn't just put out
[1:31:16] clones and everybody's the same
[1:31:18] everybody's doing the same thing can you
[1:31:19] imagine a church where everybody
[1:31:21] everybody's a preacher everybody just
[1:31:24] wants to preach and they just they got
[1:31:25] to be a preacher and and and and and we
[1:31:28] don't need and the house of the Lord
[1:31:29] would be a mess there'd be spider webs
[1:31:31] everywhere there'd be a mess everywhere
[1:31:34] and we would never be able to operate as
[1:31:37] a living mystical Body of
[1:31:41] Christ he is a god of
[1:31:44] variety he makes one one way and another
[1:31:48] another but we must serve him the way
[1:31:51] way that God made us and be
[1:31:56] glad be happy that God made you that way
[1:32:00] use it for his glory and and turn it for
[1:32:03] good Hallelujah you know I used to be a
[1:32:07] feisty kind of guy back in the world and
[1:32:10] and and you know my wife even once in a
[1:32:12] while you know when when somebody cuts
[1:32:14] me off or something she settle
[1:32:16] down settle down you know like you know
[1:32:19] it's just it's just you know because
[1:32:21] there was just certain aspects but I was
[1:32:24] a go-getter I go get it man let's let's
[1:32:26] go let's go grab it let's do what we got
[1:32:28] to do amen but now God you know he he
[1:32:33] takes the gifts and he starts to mold
[1:32:36] them and shape them in such a way that
[1:32:38] he can use it in the right way and he
[1:32:40] can start molding and shaping each and
[1:32:42] every one of our lives and take the
[1:32:44] certain aspects that you've been built
[1:32:47] and and molded and shaped by amen and
[1:32:50] turn it into something that's it's going
[1:32:51] to be a Powerhouse in the house of the
[1:32:53] Lord amen praise God hallelujah I never
[1:32:57] I never imagine brother Phillip would
[1:32:59] have the the the anointing that that
[1:33:02] comes upon him to preach the word from
[1:33:04] time to time brother Tim you know
[1:33:06] brother Chris the the the the wisdom and
[1:33:08] the and the teaching uh ability that
[1:33:11] comes you would have never known that
[1:33:12] but you see when the gifts get exercised
[1:33:15] that's what starts to happen all of a
[1:33:17] sudden the maturity starts to come God
[1:33:20] starts dealing with the individual lives
[1:33:23] God starts to show that hey this is an
[1:33:25] office and you better take it serious
[1:33:28] you know I I'm going to move through
[1:33:29] that office I'm going to use that office
[1:33:31] and I want you to yield yourself
[1:33:33] surrender yourself and these gifts when
[1:33:35] we yield ourselves to them when we give
[1:33:37] to God God uses us and all of a sudden
[1:33:40] now we've got all these different
[1:33:42] powerhouses that God is developing
[1:33:45] because listen when the anointing comes
[1:33:47] on somebody that's the ultimate power of
[1:33:51] God did you know that if an anointing
[1:33:53] comes on somebody to pray over somebody
[1:33:55] with cancer and that person is healed
[1:33:58] right there and then only the power of
[1:34:01] God can do that no man can do that no
[1:34:04] man can claim I did this or I did that
[1:34:08] it's God when he wants to move and he
[1:34:11] wants to send his anointing that's why
[1:34:13] we just listen I get scared sometimes I
[1:34:17] got to preach again Sunday oh man Lord
[1:34:20] help me I'm out to the Lord amen I said
[1:34:23] Lord I need your help you know I pray
[1:34:26] for these brothers I know what it's like
[1:34:28] you know like you got to you got to you
[1:34:30] got to focus in on the Lord and you got
[1:34:31] to allow the Holy Spirit to you know to
[1:34:34] do you see you you got to do what you
[1:34:37] know you can and should do remember that
[1:34:40] then God adds to it God moves so don't
[1:34:44] be afraid when you're called to a
[1:34:46] position if if all of a sudden you know
[1:34:48] myself or one of the deacons or one of
[1:34:50] the trustees comes to you and says hey
[1:34:52] brother you know sister would you be
[1:34:54] able to assist in this area you you just
[1:34:57] you just right there and then say
[1:34:59] brother sister you know what I'm going
[1:35:01] to pray about that thank you very much
[1:35:03] or maybe God's already showed you and
[1:35:06] then because remember God works on both
[1:35:08] ends hey and all of a sudden brother
[1:35:09] Mike walks up to you and says hey

[1:36:36] God that's just the grace of God that's
[1:36:39] how God works because he knows the
[1:36:42] desires he knows what we're doing he
[1:36:44] knows that you know that that we have
[1:36:47] budgets and everything else God knows
[1:36:49] all those things we don't have to be
[1:36:51] fearful or worried God is still Jehovah
[1:36:55] Gyra and he will continue to provide
[1:36:58] until we get out of here and that's
[1:37:01] that's I I don't see it any other way
[1:37:03] and you'll either Believe it or you
[1:37:05] don't Hallelujah let's go to the next
[1:37:08] slide Romans chapter 12 we're just going
[1:37:11] to continue on the same scripture from
[1:37:13] verse five now he says so we being many
[1:37:18] are one body in Christ he's making this
[1:37:22] very clear here and everyone members one
[1:37:27] of
[1:37:29] another you mean we're
[1:37:31] all
[1:37:35] related I thought we talked Hey Brother
[1:37:38] Hey sister well last time I checked
[1:37:41] brothers and sisters they're
[1:37:43] related they're all members of the same
[1:37:46] family and especially this family of God
[1:37:50] because this family I could tell you of
[1:37:54] millions and billions of families that
[1:37:56] are
[1:37:57] gone but this family it doesn't end this
[1:38:01] is an eternal family it had no beg Look
[1:38:04] up the word Eternal had no beginning and
[1:38:07] it'll have no end am and so you are
[1:38:10] going to be my brother and sister into
[1:38:12] eternity you may not like me in certain
[1:38:15] areas and certain ways down here as a
[1:38:18] human but I promise you when we are both
[1:38:20] in our Eternal State theophany bodies
[1:38:24] there will be no iron to rub
[1:38:27] against
[1:38:29] Hallelujah glory to God we are going to
[1:38:32] be Brothers and Sisters in Christ and
[1:38:34] we're going to say Hey Brother let's go
[1:38:36] for a little trip to the other side of
[1:38:38] the world and we're going to be there
[1:38:42] and fellowship for a couple of thousand
[1:38:43] years because time will mean nothing
[1:38:46] Hallelujah brothers and sisters into
[1:38:49] eternity glory to God he says so being
[1:38:52] many are one body in Christ and everyone
[1:38:55] members one of another having then gifts
[1:39:00] differing according to the grace that is
[1:39:03] given to us whether prophecy let us
[1:39:07] prophesy according to the portion of
[1:39:10] Revelation in other words God reveals it
[1:39:13] to you and you know that it's a clear
[1:39:15] Revelation then you can you can give the
[1:39:18] prophecy amen don't be afraid you got to
[1:39:21] allow the gift to operate but you'll
[1:39:23] know if it's God or not and sometimes
[1:39:26] you know you want to run it by your
[1:39:27] pastor you want to allow the deacons to
[1:39:29] to to you know to you get a certain uh
[1:39:32] Vision or a certain dream you write it
[1:39:34] down you you go and you see you know you
[1:39:37] should go and see your Deacon and your
[1:39:39] Deacon will direct it to the pastor if
[1:39:41] necessary amen praise
[1:39:44] God and so according to the grace that
[1:39:47] is given to us whether prophesy let us
[1:39:49] prophesy accord or Ministry let us wait
[1:39:53] on our ministry or he that teacheth on
[1:39:56] teaching or he that exhorteth on
[1:39:59] exhortation see here's all those other
[1:40:01] gifts he that giveth let him do so what
[1:40:05] with Simplicity what were we saying keep
[1:40:08] it simple don't try and make your giving
[1:40:10] such a a complicated thing and you got
[1:40:13] to go and all do all the math every
[1:40:15] month and you got to make sure that it's
[1:40:16] exactly
[1:40:19] 10%
[1:40:21] you know what I'm saying like do it in
[1:40:23] Simplicity allow the Holy Spirit to just
[1:40:26] you know uh guide you and and direct you
[1:40:29] in Simplicity he that ruleth with
[1:40:32] diligence he that showeth Mercy see
[1:40:35] there it
[1:40:36] is with
[1:40:39] cheerfulness look at that mercy and
[1:40:42] cheerfulness now you just did something
[1:40:45] that is
[1:40:47] absolutely
[1:40:49] ridiculous and you you you you you hurt
[1:40:53] somebody and the deacon now is going to
[1:40:56] come there and he's going to correct
[1:40:57] that
[1:40:58] situation the Deacon you know he's if
[1:41:02] he's got Mercy in his
[1:41:05] mind now cheerfulness doesn't mean make
[1:41:07] a joke of
[1:41:09] it we're not going to make any jokes of
[1:41:12] anything but we are going to approach it
[1:41:16] with the right attitude to not slay the
[1:41:20] person person and make them feel even
[1:41:23] worse for doing what they did because
[1:41:27] they got trapped the devil set a trap
[1:41:29] and he beat them and boom he knocked
[1:41:32] them right down and God exposed it
[1:41:35] because he wants to deliver the
[1:41:37] individual not because he wants to kill
[1:41:40] him or destroy him or destroy his
[1:41:44] influence you understand amen it's
[1:41:47] important so listen with with
[1:41:49] cheerfulness let love be without
[1:41:52] dissimilation abore that which is evil
[1:41:55] cleave to that which is good be kindly
[1:41:58] affectioned one to another with
[1:42:00] Brotherly Love in honor preferring the
[1:42:05] other preferring the other we need to be
[1:42:08] reminded of these things you know I
[1:42:11] appreciate going through this series
[1:42:14] here because I'm learning so much about
[1:42:17] how God is dealing with me and molding
[1:42:20] my character and my ways and you know my
[1:42:23] certain characteristics because remember
[1:42:25] this is all about maturity this is all
[1:42:27] about God maturing and giving you the
[1:42:30] character for the next stage of your
[1:42:34] ministry yes whatever it might be even
[1:42:37] if it is for a thousand years ruling
[1:42:41] with Christ here on Earth remember the
[1:42:44] only thing you're going to take with you
[1:42:46] is your character amen that's it and
[1:42:49] you're going to have to have character
[1:42:50] that's fit to rule because character
[1:42:56] without power without character cannot
[1:42:59] rule it just it just makes a mess of
[1:43:02] things amen praise God let's go to the
[1:43:06] next
[1:43:07] slide so here first Corinthians now just
[1:43:10] to just to you know
[1:43:13] to confirm in 1 Corinthians 12:6 it says
[1:43:17] and there are diversities of operations
[1:43:20] but it is the same God which worketh all
[1:43:23] in all but the manifestation of the
[1:43:26] spirit is given to every man to profit
[1:43:32] himself is that what it said no no it
[1:43:35] said with all so whatever the spirit is
[1:43:38] doing and operating through your life is
[1:43:41] because he's trying to profit the whole
[1:43:43] entire body of Christ amen praise God
[1:43:47] Ephesians 4:16 says from whom the whole
[1:43:51] body fitly joined together and compacted
[1:43:55] by that which every joint Supply look at
[1:43:59] this just the way the Revelation that he
[1:44:01] had here according to the effectual
[1:44:03] working in the measure of every part my
[1:44:07] God he's talking about every every
[1:44:09] little detail of your body every aspect
[1:44:12] of the body of Christ every individual
[1:44:15] you might think you're not important the
[1:44:17] little girls that come up here and and
[1:44:19] bring our purpose statement and those
[1:44:21] young children that that do those plays
[1:44:23] and sing those songs and and and and the
[1:44:26] worship team when they're up there under
[1:44:28] the anointing and they they've taken
[1:44:30] their position as a serious position as
[1:44:34] a musician and so forth do you know that
[1:44:36] the spirit is riding those strings it's
[1:44:39] riding those drums it's riding the
[1:44:41] voices because the voices are
[1:44:43] consecrated unto the Lord they've
[1:44:46] they've got an understanding that
[1:44:47] they've been called they've got an
[1:44:49] understanding that it's not because they
[1:44:50] want to be
[1:44:52] seen I'm up
[1:44:55] here listen if the wrong spirit is on
[1:44:59] you while you're up here people see it
[1:45:02] amen I'll tell you right now you better
[1:45:05] be up here because you've got a spirit
[1:45:07] of humility and you want to create an
[1:45:10] atmosphere for the Holy Ghost to bring
[1:45:12] us into Heavenly places so that we can
[1:45:14] feed on the word of God than you Jes
[1:45:16] that should be the desire to be up here
[1:45:18] not any other reason or any other motive
[1:45:22] and your life needs to be in its proper
[1:45:24] order amen praise God hallelujah so and
[1:45:27] he says according to the effectual
[1:45:29] working in the measure of every part
[1:45:31] maketh look it it increases maketh
[1:45:35] increase of the body unto the edifying
[1:45:38] of
[1:45:39] itself
[1:45:41] itself in love love what's the Capstone
[1:45:46] that we keep seeing above the church
[1:45:48] ages love
[1:45:51] what's going to take us brother Braham
[1:45:52] says one of these mornings there's going
[1:45:54] to be an anointing which is the power of
[1:45:57] God to come down and he says It'll be
[1:46:00] such a love that it'll sweep you right
[1:46:03] out of your body you won't even know in
[1:46:06] the moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:46:07] you're going to be changed Hallelujah
[1:46:10] because God's love is the is the
[1:46:13] Fulfillment of his whole Plan of
[1:46:16] Redemption his love is the blood that
[1:46:18] flows through our bodies
[1:46:21] Hallelujah without the Holy Spirit
[1:46:23] without the love of God flowing through
[1:46:25] a body without blood that body is as
[1:46:27] good as dead hallelujah it's good for
[1:46:30] nothing amen it's just a dead carcass
[1:46:32] brother B says it's worth a couple
[1:46:34] dollars amen praise God but when it's
[1:46:36] got the anointing when it's got the
[1:46:38] blood flowing through it the Holy Spirit
[1:46:40] operating in all the gifts and
[1:46:42] nourishing and edifying it starts to
[1:46:45] edify itself let's go to the next
[1:46:47] scripture listen We Are One we are one
[1:46:51] this is Brother Braham speaking here in
[1:46:52] Christ The Mystery of God revealed I've
[1:46:54] been so blessed in reading that book you
[1:46:57] know over the last couple of weeks if
[1:46:58] you get a chance read it listen to it do
[1:47:01] both he says we are one I couldn't say
[1:47:04] left hand I'm mad at
[1:47:08] you and go and chop it
[1:47:12] off it doesn't make any sense he says
[1:47:16] I'm going to take you away cuz you're
[1:47:18] not a right hand
[1:47:21] but you're a left hand why you trying to
[1:47:24] make the left do something that the
[1:47:25] right can only
[1:47:26] do leave it alone let the right stay
[1:47:29] where it is let the left stay where it
[1:47:31] is amen he says he's my left hand I want
[1:47:34] him to stay there Hallelujah even the
[1:47:38] little tip of my finger you try to pick
[1:47:40] something up if you lose the tips of
[1:47:42] your fingers go try and pick something
[1:47:44] up it's not easy amen he says I want my
[1:47:48] little finger to stay right there I want
[1:47:50] it to stay right there every little part
[1:47:52] of my body stay right there and God
[1:47:56] wants us as a body of Believers to stay
[1:48:00] right exactly with one another right at
[1:48:03] with one another amen praise God forever
[1:48:07] more go to the next slide so what is it
[1:48:11] in
[1:48:12] summary we are joints that Supply one
[1:48:18] another we Supply and we edify one
[1:48:22] another we are spiritually linked to one
[1:48:27] another you're my brother you're my
[1:48:29] sister you come from God you're going
[1:48:32] back to God and I'm coming with you amen
[1:48:35] we are attributes of God then we will
[1:48:37] have a revelation of who our father is
[1:48:40] amen we will know exactly where we stand
[1:48:44] we will understand that God has called
[1:48:46] us into a local assembly for a purpose
[1:48:50] you don't want to be leaving here today
[1:48:53] and wondering and being confused if
[1:48:55] there's anything you want to be
[1:48:56] wondering about just let it be look Lord
[1:48:59] I am excited about being put into my
[1:49:02] position where you want me to be used
[1:49:05] because when you get into that position
[1:49:08] a supernatural anointing will come upon
[1:49:12] your entire
[1:49:14] life because your ministry in the body
[1:49:17] of Christ is something that affects
[1:49:21] everything around you outside of this
[1:49:23] church no matter where you are whatever
[1:49:25] you're doing you
[1:49:27] become like an anointing like Joseph on
[1:49:30] you that everything you start to touch
[1:49:33] starts to
[1:49:34] prosper amen it may take some time
[1:49:37] because there's things around you and
[1:49:39] things you're dealing with and things
[1:49:41] that you're overcoming that's okay
[1:49:43] that's okay I've been around the message
[1:49:45] for 20 years I've been around for 30
[1:49:46] years I've been I don't care how many
[1:49:48] years you've been around you still need
[1:49:50] perfecting amen because until you come
[1:49:52] into the fullness and you come into the
[1:49:55] unity and you come into the revelation
[1:49:58] of your position and how it is that God
[1:50:00] is using it in love and how God wants
[1:50:02] you to to understand that that we're
[1:50:04] spiritually linked to one another
[1:50:06] Hallelujah then you're you're you're
[1:50:08] you're still going to need perfecting
[1:50:10] you're still going to need to hear the
[1:50:11] word you're still going to need to to to
[1:50:13] be molded and shaped by the word of God
[1:50:16] I need to be molded and shaped every
[1:50:18] single day by the word of God
[1:50:20] amen the minute that you think you don't
[1:50:22] need to be shaped and molded anymore
[1:50:25] you're in trouble I'm telling you right
[1:50:27] now you're going to start to see things
[1:50:29] happening around you and you're
[1:50:30] wondering why is this going on why is
[1:50:31] that happening what what's going on here
[1:50:33] what's going on there because you got to
[1:50:37] stay with the program of God you got to
[1:50:39] allow yourself to be surrendered and
[1:50:42] yielded and and let the Holy Spirit have
[1:50:44] his way when we join the body we become
[1:50:47] responsible for one another
[1:50:51] you got to start thinking about how you
[1:50:53] affect the rest of the body by the way
[1:50:56] that your attitude and by the way that
[1:50:58] you come into the house of the Lord you
[1:51:00] come in prepared or you comeing in all
[1:51:03] ruffled up because you got up late and
[1:51:05] you didn't get your coffee and you're
[1:51:08] miserable no I'm serious we need to know
[1:51:11] that we have to be responsible for one
[1:51:14] another and the way we greet one another
[1:51:17] the way we treat one another and the way
[1:51:19] we we acknowledge one another is very
[1:51:23] important especially as a body of
[1:51:25] Believers that we come into the house of
[1:51:27] the Lord we need to come in we're coming
[1:51:29] into this Sanctuary we don't want to
[1:51:31] bring anything but a sweet humble spirit
[1:51:34] before God so that the spirit of God can
[1:51:37] move and minister to the needs of the
[1:51:39] people and lift burdens and and heal
[1:51:41] sicknesses and and and supernaturally
[1:51:44] provide needs that's what this Sanctuary
[1:51:47] is for amen listen it all all starts in
[1:51:50] the house of the Lord Brother Chris
[1:51:52] right it all starts right here where we
[1:51:54] come in and we come in broken down we
[1:51:56] come in broken up and you know maybe we
[1:51:59] need something and if you come in with
[1:52:01] the right Revelation and the right
[1:52:03] understanding you will not leave the
[1:52:04] same way you will leave with the joy of
[1:52:07] the Lord that you can't even explain
[1:52:09] it God's anointing you cannot explain it
[1:52:13] comes when it wants we don't live
[1:52:15] selfishly anymore but we live for one
[1:52:18] another AMJ Hal Hallelujah yes sir we
[1:52:21] love and we protect one
[1:52:27] another let's go to the next quote

[1:52:34] says and after making my own
[1:52:36] Consecration and after making having the
[1:52:39] church do so now if God blessed us the
[1:52:42] way that he has in these last few
[1:52:44] meetings he's talking about how he set
[1:52:46] himself aside you know as the minister
[1:52:49] for for a series of meetings that week

[1:53:28] that atmosphere and praising God and
[1:53:31] bringing down the anointing so that the
[1:53:33] Holy Spirit can meet the needs of the

[1:53:38] offices that have been assigned there's
[1:53:40] there's there's ushers that that that
[1:53:42] are covering the doors and everything
[1:53:44] else we're safe you just need to get
[1:53:47] into the sanctuary and you need to do
[1:53:49] your part heart so that God can do his
[1:53:52] amen praise God there's time after or if
[1:53:54] you need to do something you got to come
[1:53:56] a little earlier then and get it done so
[1:53:58] that you can be in the sanctuary amen he
[1:54:01] has a he has in the last few meetings so
[1:54:04] he says now just keep it up now listen

[1:54:09] seen you standing in the aisles this
[1:54:12] morning and this week with your hands to
[1:54:14] God and the lovely Spirit moving around
[1:54:18] over you he says now don't you listen to
[1:54:21] one foul thing the devil has got to say
[1:54:25] he's now he's because you know we know
[1:54:27] that the enemy is going to attack okay
[1:54:30] even after this preaching I'll tell you
[1:54:32] right now there's going to be some
[1:54:34] attacks but that's okay that's that's
[1:54:36] that's God vindicating and showing that
[1:54:39] you know what the
[1:54:41] word it was what I wanted to say so just
[1:54:45] be under expectation but be aware but
[1:54:47] know that God will never allow anything
[1:54:49] more than what you have been ordained
[1:54:52] and designed to handle amen he says now
[1:54:56] listen he says don't you listen to one
[1:54:58] foul thing the devil's got to say see if
[1:55:01] the devil shows you some or tells you
[1:55:03] something evil about one of the members
[1:55:05] of the body of Christ don't you believe
[1:55:10] it now that's a
[1:55:12] rule you hear something unless that
[1:55:16] thing has been absolutely investigated
[1:55:19] properly
[1:55:20] by the Holy Ghost through the proper
[1:55:22] channels and avenues you do not believe
[1:55:25] it and you do not repeat it you do not
[1:55:28] even allow it to be gone any further and
[1:55:31] if it's coming to you and it's not
[1:55:34] supposed to come to you you stop that
[1:55:36] person right there and then and say
[1:55:38] wh you need to speak to your
[1:55:41] Deacon and that's
[1:55:44] important we want to
[1:55:47] protect so he says here he he says don't
[1:55:50] you believe it for as soon as you
[1:55:51] believe it you Mar your experience can
[1:55:55] you
[1:55:56] imagine because all of a sudden if
[1:55:58] you're believing that without proper
[1:56:00] investigation and and and all of a
[1:56:02] sudden you've just been given an evil
[1:56:04] report about somebody do you know that
[1:56:06] that all of a sudden there's a picture
[1:56:08] in your mind of that person and if
[1:56:10] you're not careful and you don't know
[1:56:12] how to handle that you could have a a
[1:56:15] complex and all of a sudden you'll never
[1:56:16] trust that person again and meanwhile
[1:56:18] it's not even proven yet that that it
[1:56:20] actually happened but that's the way the
[1:56:23] devil works so be careful amen he says
[1:56:27] he says for as soon as you believe it
[1:56:29] you Mar your experience and if you see
[1:56:31] one of the members of the body of Christ
[1:56:33] doing something evil don't tell nobody
[1:56:36] else
[1:56:38] amen now it doesn't mean you don't tell
[1:56:41] absolutely nobody else you got to
[1:56:44] understand here he's talking about you
[1:56:46] going to another brother or sister that
[1:56:48] has no
[1:56:50] reason whatsoever to know about it at
[1:56:52] all and you start going to talk about it
[1:56:54] with them did you see that what he did
[1:56:56] there and what she did there and oh my
[1:56:58] goodness and everything
[1:57:00] else that's not the spirit of God I'll
[1:57:03] tell you right now that's not how we
[1:57:06] kick the devil out the Bible says resist
[1:57:09] the devil and he will flee he says now
[1:57:12] watch he says for as soon as you believe
[1:57:14] you Mar and if you are one
[1:57:16] of doing something don't tell nobody
[1:57:19] else but go to that
[1:57:21] member and with love and see if you
[1:57:25] can't bring them back to Christ again if
[1:57:28] you feel confident enough that you can
[1:57:31] go because sometimes there are things
[1:57:32] that you know between sisters and stuff
[1:57:34] like that you don't need to go to the
[1:57:35] Deacon if it's something you know you're
[1:57:37] an elder sister and you want to help
[1:57:39] that sister you should go and help that
[1:57:40] sister and sit down with that sister and
[1:57:42] say Hey sister I just want to bring
[1:57:44] something to your attention you know and
[1:57:46] and and I'm doing it because I love you
[1:57:49] because I want us to to to be strong in
[1:57:51] the Lord I want us to be I want us to be
[1:57:53] a Powerhouse as the body of Christ I
[1:57:56] don't want any division amongst us I
[1:57:57] don't want any separation and you will
[1:58:00] tell that person and then and then so
[1:58:03] you know he goes on he says with love
[1:58:04] and see if you can bring that person
[1:58:06] back to Christ again and if you can't do
[1:58:10] it then tell one other person that's
[1:58:13] where you'll go to a deacon and the
[1:58:15] Deacon will do it all in the proper way
[1:58:17] okay or let them go with you do it the
[1:58:21] way listen do it the way the scripture
[1:58:23] says see but don't if somebody says
[1:58:27] sister so and so and brothers so and so
[1:58:29] don't you believe one word of it you
[1:58:33] just leave it go because remember it's
[1:58:35] the devil trying to tear you to pieces
[1:58:39] now just look for him to come in cuz
[1:58:42] he'll do it that's he's talking about
[1:58:44] look for the Holy Spirit to come into it
[1:58:46] now you let the good man of the house
[1:58:48] fake stand right there and don't you
[1:58:52] receive one thing these people have been
[1:58:55] set in Heavenly places with you to
[1:58:59] Fellowship together around the blessings
[1:59:01] of God taking the communion at the table
[1:59:03] and the Holy Spirit has witness that
[1:59:06] they are the children of god let's just
[1:59:08] be real sweet kindhearted forgiving
[1:59:12] loving and if the person other person
[1:59:15] talks evil against you you talk sweet
[1:59:18] against them
[1:59:20] amen hallelujah watch how sweet comes to
[1:59:25] you then see that's right just always
[1:59:29] return good for evil and love for
[1:59:34] hate so the
[1:59:36] next
[1:59:38] scripture in Romans
[1:59:44] 12
[1:59:47] sorry let the music musicians come
[1:59:49] because I'm not going to go any
[1:59:52] further we're going to
