[10:26] Father, thank you for bringing to us to
[10:29] your house of worship. You are here Lord
[10:32] with one purpose to worship you in truth
[10:34] and in spirit. May you bless brother Tim

[11:11] Amen.

[11:31] in the angel beckoning me from heaven's
[11:36] open door. And I can't

[11:51] no hope. Oh
[11:54] [Music]

[12:03] I have been at home in this

[12:41] I if heaven's not my
[12:46] own life.
[12:49] angels beckoning me from

[13:01] world. Just over in
[13:04] glory will live
[13:07] eternally. The saints on every hand I
[13:11] shout victory.

[13:18] from heaven sure and I feel open this

[14:01] [Music]
[14:06] my
[14:08] back
[14:11] from. And I can't feel I in this world
[14:17] anymore.
[14:19] And I can feel I hope in this
[14:25] world. I saw the
[14:28] light. I saw the
[14:32] light. No more
[14:35] darkness. No more
[14:38] life. Oh, I'm so high. Be no sorrow
[14:45] inside. Praise the Lord.
[14:49] My
[14:51] soul was so
[14:54] angless. I
[14:57] feel I would let my dear
[15:04] Savior and Jesus came like a
[15:10] stranger. Praise the Lord.
[15:14] I saw the
[15:16] light. I saw the
[15:20] light. My
[15:23] soul. No
[15:26] more. No
[15:30] more.
[15:34] [Music]
[15:36] So, praise the
[15:39] Lord. I saw.
[15:41] [Applause]
[15:43] Oh, I saw the
[15:45] light. I saw the
[15:49] light.
[15:54] [Music]
[15:55] Oh, now I'm so
[16:01] high. Praise the Lord.
[16:08] [Music]
[16:10] Hallelujah.
[16:12] Praise the
[16:13] Lord. We saw a great light in this hour.
[16:17] Amen. Glory to Praise God. Amen. God
[16:20] bless you, saints. Amen. It's good to be
[16:24] in the house of the Lord tonight. You
[16:26] pray for me. It's been like five months
[16:28] since I've been up here dealing with
[16:31] work and a little bit of health
[16:33] issues, but uh God is bringing me along.
[16:38] Little by little, he's healing us. Amen.
[16:41] And he's delivering us. Amen. Not there
[16:43] yet, but we're getting there. And I felt
[16:46] the pull to, you know, say, I'll come
[16:48] back and see what the Lord will do.
[16:50] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Thank you for
[16:53] your prayers.
[16:55] Hallelujah. Praying is the break the
[16:59] biggest part of the church engine in
[17:00] this day. Amen. We shouldn't take it
[17:03] lightly. It breaks us out of the
[17:05] atmospheres of the Leo and church age,
[17:08] right? and keeps us on fire for God.
[17:12] Hallelujah. Praying with the
[17:14] understanding of who we are. That's a
[17:16] series I've been bringing with the the
[17:18] prayer meetings. Amen. Hallelujah. So,
[17:21] we're just a little grateful today. I'm
[17:23] a little nervous. Just trying to calm
[17:25] myself down a little bit. Amen. And um
[17:30] to get into the spirit of God and see
[17:31] what the Lord has for us tonight. Amen.
[17:34] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We're so
[17:36] thankful for, you know, just what the
[17:39] word's been coming forth lately. Amen.
[17:42] There's been a great shift. We were
[17:43] talking about that at the leadership
[17:45] meetings and um you know, how the
[17:48] battle's been great. Hallelujah. But
[17:51] it's because we we we there's a shift
[17:53] that's taken place and Satan is going to
[17:56] test us. You know, we we so relied on
[17:59] brother Simon for so many
[18:02] years. Come on. And now he's God placed
[18:06] them out of the way now. Put a new
[18:09] pastor here and we're going to be
[18:12] tested. But like I said, there's real
[18:15] births here. Amen. There's real births
[18:19] here. There's people have been really
[18:21] born again and and caught the revelation
[18:24] of Jesus Christ him. Hallelujah. In this
[18:27] hour, and that's what's keeping us. No
[18:29] man has never kept us. No ministry will
[18:31] ever keep us. But Jesus Christ is
[18:34] keeping us in this hour. Amen. Yes, sir.
[18:36] Hallelujah. I want to continue on in my
[18:38] series. It's prayer meeting. I mean,
[18:40] it's I was just talking about it's Bible
[18:42] study tonight. Amen. So, we want to we
[18:46] want to I want to get my glasses out
[18:47] here. I won't be able to see nothing. We
[18:50] want to continue on the series of the
[18:51] power of tradition. I didn't know if I
[18:54] was going to go back to it, but the Lord
[18:56] just wants me to stay on it. And this
[18:57] this message here tonight is going to be
[18:59] a couple messages. So, we'll try to lay
[19:01] a little foundation and bring out a few
[19:04] points on it. Amen. I know we got a lot
[19:07] of letter here, but we want the Holy
[19:10] Spirit to come and quicken the word to
[19:12] us. Amen. My title is the capstone has
[19:15] come
[19:15] down. Hallelujah. It has come down and
[19:20] Christ is the head of the
[19:21] church.
[19:23] Amen. Hallelujah. That's becoming a a
[19:26] revelation to the bride of Jesus Christ.
[19:28] Let us turn to Ephesians
[19:31] 2:18 and then we'll go to Matthew 21:42
[19:35] and then you can have your
[19:36] seats.
[19:39] Allelujah. Ephesians
[19:43] 2:18. For through him we both have
[19:46] access by one spirit unto the Father.
[19:51] Now therefore, ye are no more
[19:55] strangers and
[19:57] foreigners, but fellow citizens with the
[20:01] saints of the household of
[20:04] God, and are built up the foundation of
[20:08] the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ
[20:11] himself, being the chief
[20:14] cornerstone, in whom all the body fitly
[20:18] framed together groweth. unto a holy
[20:22] temple in the Lord. Amen. In whom ye
[20:26] also are built together for inhabitation
[20:29] of God through the spirit. Oh,
[20:33] hallelujah. Get your spiritual thinking
[20:36] caps on tonight. Amen. Hallelujah.
[20:40] Matthew
[20:42] 21:42. Oh, we are built. We're no more
[20:45] strangers and foreigners to this word of
[20:47] God, to this revelation that was given
[20:50] to us in these last days, but we're f
[20:52] fellow citizens. Hallelujah. The
[20:54] household of God. We are part of this
[20:57] prophecy that was that came forth from
[21:00] the prophet in this day and
[21:02] age. Jesus said unto them, did you never
[21:06] read in the scriptures the stones the
[21:10] stone which the builders reject? The
[21:13] same is become the head of the
[21:15] corner. This is the Lord's doing and it
[21:19] is marvelous in our eyes. Hallelujah.
[21:22] Let us pray. Father, we thank you
[21:24] tonight, Lord, for your love, your
[21:26] grace, and your mercy. Father, Lord, we
[21:30] prayed. God, you know, I prayed and I
[21:32] prayed not only for myself but for the
[21:35] people. Come, Lord Jesus. I pray break
[21:38] every atmosphere, every unbelieving
[21:41] spirit. Father, let there be such faith
[21:44] here tonight. Father, raise up, Lord.
[21:47] Take control of me. Use me for your
[21:50] honor and your glory. Put me aside,
[21:51] Lord. Let the supernatural come now,
[21:54] Lord. Touch, heal. Let your word go
[21:56] forth. As you said, my word went forth
[21:58] and healed the people, Lord. Not only
[22:01] physically, but spiritually, mentally.
[22:04] Father, let your word heal tonight.
[22:07] Father, deliver and set free. Lord, we
[22:09] commit each and every one into your
[22:11] hands to both speaker and hearer.
[22:14] Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, we
[22:16] pray. You may be
[22:18] seated. Hallelujah. Ephesians
[22:21] 5:23. For the husband is the head of the
[22:24] wife, even as Christ is the head of the
[22:28] church, and he is the savior of the
[22:32] body. Colossians 1:18.
[22:36] And he is the head of the body, the
[22:38] church, who is the beginning, the
[22:41] firstborn from the dead, that in all
[22:45] things he might have the preeminence.
[22:48] Amen. That's what he wants. Full
[22:51] preeminance in his church. Amen. That's
[22:54] why he's declaring, I am the head of the
[22:56] church. Hallelujah. I use men. I've
[23:00] given a five-fold ministry. Amen. to
[23:03] speak my word, but I am the head. Amen.
[23:08] And that's what we want to establish
[23:09] tonight. Glory to God. Amen. Just an
[23:14] overview that we what we've been
[23:16] speaking on. We talked about this
[23:19] message series of the power of tradition
[23:22] about traditions of the elders, how they
[23:25] didn't recognize Jesus, the revealed
[23:28] word of their day. And it's the same
[23:30] thing today. Not only out there, we know
[23:32] they haven't recognized the revealed.
[23:35] They haven't accepted a prophet in this
[23:37] day. Amen. But right here in the
[23:40] message, people are not recognizing the
[23:42] revealed word. Hallelujah. Amen. The
[23:46] dark ages, the nickel spirit through the
[23:49] Catholic Church. How that Wesley, I mean
[23:53] Luther, Wesley, Pentecost had a part
[23:56] truth. They all had truth. But we know
[23:59] that after they left the scene, they
[24:02] took that truth and they held on to it.
[24:04] They didn't move forward. Each age did
[24:07] not move forward and they denominated
[24:09] it. Hallelujah. The same the nickelian
[24:12] spirit today, denominational spirit
[24:15] today, it's here. Hallelujah. If your
[24:18] eyes have not been open to see it, but
[24:20] it's here. Amen. And how the message is
[24:24] two parts. It is a coming out of the
[24:27] church ages and a going into the
[24:29] capstone age, the rapture age. We call
[24:32] it the bride age.
[24:35] Hallelujah. Things change and they shift
[24:37] as we're going to talk about after
[24:40] 1963, the age change. Amen. Hallelujah.
[24:45] Just like we can't feed off of Luther,
[24:47] we can't feed off of Wesley, we can't
[24:50] feed off of Pentecost. And that's the
[24:52] seven church age message that was given
[24:56] through a prophet. He was the seven
[24:58] church age messenger.
[25:01] But everything changed when the mighty
[25:02] angel came down. Everything shifted when
[25:05] the mighty angel came down. There was a
[25:07] changing of an age. Amen. It's in the
[25:10] message of the hour. Brother Brandham
[25:12] call it the rapture age, the bride age,
[25:14] the capstone age. It's right there. It's
[25:17] not the leaning church age. It's not no
[25:19] more the seventh uh angel messenger age
[25:23] or message anymore, but it's the mighty
[25:25] angel. Hallelujah.
[25:29] Amen. Which only the Holy Ghost can do.
[25:33] No man can bring you into the capstone.
[25:37] And we understand that a lot of people
[25:39] in this message are still in the seven
[25:42] church age preaching a Pentecostal
[25:45] message and glorifying it with quotes
[25:48] with no understanding.
[25:51] Taking the message. Amen. Where has
[25:55] progressed? The word just like Luther
[25:57] Wesley has progressed. The message had
[26:00] progressed.
[26:02] Amen. It had changed and it was
[26:04] changing. And just like God is
[26:06] immorphing himself, the message, the
[26:08] word was immorphing itself and changing.
[26:12] The truth was marching on and people are
[26:15] taking what has been already passed and
[26:18] using it without any understanding of
[26:22] where we are today. We can see that. I
[26:26] hope we can see that now. Recognize that
[26:28] a lot more clear. It's not only been
[26:30] coming through my series, been coming
[26:32] through the pastor, these brothers in
[26:34] certain ways. Everybody has their gifts
[26:36] and their portion of faith. Amen. Amen.
[26:40] Hallelujah. G. The bride can only live
[26:44] in the capstone age.
[26:47] She can't live in any other age. The
[26:49] Luthers when they caught the revelation
[26:51] of justification, that was their age.
[26:54] That's what they produced. Just like
[26:56] Wesley, just like Pentecost. But the
[26:59] bride can't live back there. She can
[27:02] only be birthed into this seven seal
[27:05] mystery. Hallelujah. Into the capstone.
[27:09] Hallelujah.
[27:12] Hallelujah. That's where her birth is.
[27:16] That's where she
[27:18] overcomes. That's where per perfect
[27:20] faith will come to her and she'll
[27:23] receive her body change there.
[27:26] Everybody else will be left behind to go
[27:30] through tribulation. The foolish virgin
[27:32] in this message will be left behind to
[27:35] go into tribulation. But the bride of
[27:37] Jesus Christ, those who are chosen,
[27:40] elected, predestinated, are in the
[27:42] capstone now. The rapture is here now.
[27:47] Amen. A preacher can preach, but you got
[27:50] to know, you got to be certain of God.
[27:53] Your experience has got to line up with
[27:55] the word. You got to see yourself and
[27:57] recognize your own self that you are in
[28:00] that capstone.
[28:02] If not, brother Brandham said with the
[28:03] token, it's time to get desperate.
[28:06] Hallelujah. I can't make you desperate.
[28:08] I can't tell you to get
[28:10] desperate. You got to do it.
[28:14] Hallelujah. Amen. and the capstone
[28:17] revelation that reveals the new
[28:20] knowledge or the revelation of God's
[28:23] plan for the end
[28:26] times. In the book of Revelation, the
[28:28] capstone is the final cap off of all
[28:34] revelations to complete perfect faith in
[28:37] the bride that she is predestinated to
[28:43] fulfill because she is the final voice
[28:46] to this final age.
[28:49] She
[28:50] is. I know they're saying what they're
[28:52] saying out there. You know that the
[28:55] voice of God is still on the tapes and
[28:57] that. Yes, we get blessed from them. I
[29:00] listen to them all the time. Amen. But
[29:04] that voice, what happened when the word
[29:06] came to the prophet? When the word, see,
[29:10] the prophet didn't have the word. Just
[29:11] think about
[29:12] it. We're we're we're exalting him as
[29:15] God, not us. But people are exalting him
[29:18] as God. But the word came to the prophet
[29:22] just like John the Baptist. The word
[29:24] came to John the Baptist. Without the
[29:26] word coming to the prophet and then the
[29:28] word got into the prophet and then when
[29:31] the prophet spoke the word that became
[29:33] the voice of God. Now that voice, Amen,
[29:37] that word that was spoken by a prophet,
[29:39] where does it go? It goes into the bride
[29:42] of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. That's
[29:45] what's prophesied. And when it gets into
[29:48] her, when it really gets into her
[29:50] through the new birth, then when she
[29:52] speaks, what is it? God can't break his
[29:55] chain, he can't break his order, it
[29:59] becomes the voice of God in this last
[30:01] day. Amen. Hallelujah.
[30:04] And when we don't recognize that, Amen.
[30:07] Hallelujah. We think we're just playing
[30:09] church. We're playing religion. We're
[30:12] just coming to hear a man.
[30:15] My brothers and sisters, how can your
[30:17] faith grow when you think you're only
[30:20] coming to hear a man? How can you come
[30:22] with expectation on your heart to hear
[30:25] the voice of God speaking to you and
[30:27] your
[30:28] needs? Amen. How can your heart burn
[30:31] with inside of you? How can a change
[30:33] take place when you think that this is
[30:35] still the working of man in this last
[30:38] day? My God. Hallelujah. Yes, man is
[30:41] man. We know redemption. We know through
[30:44] the blood. We know that there's an
[30:46] attribute that cannot sin. But we know
[30:48] that there's a flesh that you see every
[30:50] day in man. But don't you see the
[30:54] redemption of man? Don't you see the
[30:56] blood of Christ in man?
[31:00] Hallelujah. Don't look at man. Listen
[31:03] for the voice of God. Hallelujah.
[31:08] That's why they had to
[31:11] wave the wave sheep for it was the first
[31:15] one that come to
[31:18] maturity and it was waved as a memorial
[31:22] of thanksgiving to God believing that
[31:26] the rest of them would
[31:30] come. It was a
[31:32] sign. What am I talking about here? Not
[31:36] only Jesus Christ,
[31:39] amen, but our
[31:42] prophet. Now listen, it was a sign to
[31:46] who? And today, because he was the first
[31:49] son of God to come to full maturity to
[31:52] be in
[31:53] God, but this was really the first fruit
[31:56] of them that slept. He was waved over
[31:59] the
[32:01] people, over the promised seed that had
[32:05] been promised to
[32:08] life and to be waved again. We realize
[32:12] in the last days according to seven Luke
[32:15] 17:30 the sun day again in the day that
[32:21] the sun s o n of man will be revealed or
[32:26] waved again over the people in the life
[32:31] hallelujah in his life and the tapes of
[32:36] the prophet we can recognize that Christ
[32:40] was waving
[32:41] over the people again. Yes. That that
[32:44] one that came to full maturity is a sign
[32:48] that you here tonight are going to come
[32:52] to that maturity. Yes, sir. Hallelujah.
[32:55] That's why we're here. That's why we
[32:57] battle. That's why we pray. That's why
[33:00] we overcome. That's why we press through
[33:03] because God, the Holy Spirit who started
[33:05] the work is finishing in the work in
[33:07] this last day. Yes, sir. Oh, God. But
[33:10] hallelujah.
[33:12] Lord, help me. You pray for me. Amen.
[33:15] That I have the
[33:17] strength. In the beginning was the word.
[33:19] The word was with God and the word was
[33:22] God. And the word was made flesh and
[33:25] dwelt among us. It's the rising of the
[33:28] sun.
[33:30] Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[33:35] And in this church age we can see that
[33:40] she is a dominating
[33:42] female. She is the mystery
[33:45] Babylon. She is the great She is
[33:48] Jezebel the false prophetess. Why?
[33:52] Because a true female a true female is
[33:55] submissive to God. Christ is her head.
[33:59] She has no word but his. No thought but
[34:05] his. You see where she's coming
[34:08] to? I hope you are she tonight. I hope
[34:12] you are the bride. But this is
[34:14] prophesied that like brother Brandon
[34:16] said, there will be a bride. I don't
[34:19] know who she is, but there will be a
[34:21] bride that will come and fulfill this.
[34:24] If you're not believing that you are
[34:26] part of these prophecies, Amen. that has
[34:29] been spoken in this day that God's word
[34:32] is going to produce this in your life.
[34:34] Then what are you
[34:37] doing playing
[34:42] church? She has no other leadership but
[34:46] his. Yes.
[34:49] Hallelujah. The power of tradition.
[34:51] Christ is the head of the body and
[34:56] churches. Amen. Message churches, all of
[34:59] them are just
[35:01] lodges in themsself. They're just
[35:04] lodges. This is just a building, my
[35:06] brothers. This building, no matter how
[35:09] nice it is, and there's a lot nicer
[35:11] buildings in this message, it can't do
[35:13] nothing for you. And it doesn't matter
[35:16] how how small it is, it can't do nothing
[35:19] for you. Amen. There is lodges that we
[35:22] come in. Amen. to meet with God, to meet
[35:27] with his word. Hallelujah.
[35:30] Whether this house or just like the
[35:32] apostles in the in the New Testament
[35:35] when the church first began at
[35:37] Pentecost, they met in their homes.
[35:40] What's the difference, my brothers and
[35:41] sisters? Hallelujah. The spirit of God
[35:44] is all over the earth moving.
[35:46] Hallelujah.
[35:47] Amen. That's a denominational spirit. To
[35:50] think that God is in big buildings. The
[35:52] better, the bigger, the more God there
[35:54] is. No, we are the church. We are the
[35:58] building of God that he has built. Amen.
[36:03] Jesus said, "You and your traditions
[36:05] have made the word of God to known
[36:07] effect." Mark 7:13, there is no
[36:10] difference.
[36:11] Listen, there's no difference between
[36:13] people in the Catholic Church believing
[36:16] in the Pope and that Mary is the mother
[36:18] of God for their salvation.
[36:21] Hallelujah. Then in the message of the
[36:23] hour where churches are believing in a
[36:27] prophet believing in me churches for
[36:29] their salvation.
[36:33] [Applause]
[36:34] Whoa. We're not to believe in message
[36:36] churches that we belong to a church or a
[36:39] message
[36:41] church or believe in a prophet for our
[36:44] salvation. We believe God sent a prophet
[36:47] and we believe the word which is Christ.
[36:50] God himself came through a prophet.
[36:55] We believe Christ for our salvation.
[36:57] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Brother Brandon
[37:01] said, "You must have the
[37:04] token." The token is something outside
[37:07] of joining a message church.
[37:10] Even the Bible says in Acts 19, "Have
[37:13] you receive the Holy Ghost?" Hallelujah.
[37:17] the token since you believe this
[37:19] message. Amen. Doesn't say that, but I'm
[37:21] saying it. Since you believe, but since
[37:24] you believe this message, Brother Simon
[37:26] brought out that many years ago. It
[37:28] stirred the people in the message right
[37:31] up. What are you talking about? All we
[37:33] have to do because they're on there that
[37:35] illusion. All we had to do is believe
[37:36] God sent a prophet and believe the
[37:38] message he sent. No, it's not all. No,
[37:41] it's not all. There's a Holy Ghost to
[37:44] receive in our lives. There's a dying
[37:46] out, a surrender of our lives. Amen. To
[37:51] surrender to his will, to his voice in
[37:54] our lives.
[37:56] Amen.
[37:58] Hallelujah. The true church is the body
[38:01] which is called the bride. And she knows
[38:04] what to do with his word. And she obeys
[38:08] it. She knows how to divide the truth,
[38:10] rightfully divide the truth. Amen. She
[38:13] knows how to take the word and place it
[38:16] in her life. Amen. Glory to God. Why?
[38:21] Because he teaches her, not man. You
[38:26] need no man to teach you these things.
[38:28] How can man teach you? He's not
[38:30] qualified. It can't be touched with
[38:32] man's hands. Hallelujah. Man preaches
[38:35] the word of God through foolishness of
[38:37] preaching. Amen. But God takes that word
[38:40] that is preached. You can I can preach
[38:42] here, which I will. I'll preach for
[38:44] another hour or so and and and you can
[38:47] walk out of here with nothing. Nothing.
[38:50] It doesn't matter how I preach, how I
[38:52] bring the word. And every week is coming
[38:54] forth. Hallelujah. We got a unique gift
[38:58] here. I've always said that. Amen. That
[39:01] breaks down the word and brings in such
[39:03] ways. But you walk out of here with
[39:05] maybe a bunch of knowledge or you might
[39:07] even lose it all. Or you can walk out
[39:09] here if the spirit of God is inside of
[39:11] you speaking through your heart and
[39:13] revealing things to you. Why? Because
[39:15] you got a consecrated life. You're in
[39:18] the word all the time. You and Christ
[39:20] are walking together every day. The
[39:22] spirit of revelation don't get tired.
[39:25] Amen. It doesn't go on leave. The spirit
[39:28] of revelation is constantly revealing to
[39:31] us. Yeah. The spirit gets we the flesh
[39:34] gets weak, but the spirit is willing our
[39:37] flesh. But that spirit of God, it
[39:40] doesn't sleep or slumber in us. Amen. If
[39:42] you want, the more you want to yield
[39:44] yourself, the more it will speak to you.
[39:47] I know what it's like to wake up in the
[39:49] middle of the night and stay up for two
[39:51] or three hours and just the spirit of
[39:53] God just speaking to my heart. Amen.
[39:58] Hallelujah. Amen. The book of Revelation
[40:01] itself does not fully reveal or express
[40:04] without mentioning the term capstone.
[40:07] However, the concept of capstone or the
[40:10] final stone in the building is used in a
[40:14] way that relates and represents Jesus
[40:16] and other parts of the Bible most nobly
[40:19] in Matthew 21 42 and Psalms
[40:24] 118 22. That's where you'll find it.
[40:28] These passages described how the stone
[40:30] of the builders rejected Jesus and has
[40:34] become the capstone signifying his
[40:38] center
[40:39] importance. Remember my title, the
[40:42] capstone has come down. Christ is the
[40:44] head of the church. Amen. Is importance
[40:48] and the completion of God's plan. The
[40:51] book of revelation forces is is forces
[40:56] and symbols and prophetic visions. And
[41:00] while it doesn't directly use capstone
[41:03] term, it's understood to be a part of
[41:05] the completion of God's work through
[41:09] Christ. So without the capstone, without
[41:12] being in the capstone, there is no
[41:15] completion in your individual life
[41:18] without you being in there. The fullness
[41:20] of the revelation is only being revealed
[41:23] in there in this
[41:25] hour. And if you're not in
[41:28] there, like brother Brandon said, and he
[41:30] cried out, if you're lacking behind,
[41:34] don't
[41:35] linger. Hallelujah. And I'm not talking
[41:38] about your church attendance. I'm not
[41:41] talking about how much you read the
[41:42] Bible or how much you pray. I'm talking
[41:45] about lingering, the voice of God, the
[41:49] wooing of the spirit of God trying to
[41:52] move you forward. Amen. In your personal
[41:54] life, trying to bring you under
[41:56] obedience because obedience is better
[41:58] than all your sacrifices. Amen. Obeying
[42:02] the spirit moving and moving on you and
[42:05] calling you closer to him.
[42:08] Hallelujah. God's going to have a bride.
[42:11] Amen. He'll do what he has to do. Now,
[42:14] brother Brandon speaking here and
[42:16] greatest battle ever
[42:17] fought. Leo, you remember the dream you
[42:20] had that time when you first come here
[42:24] about the pyramid and you thought you
[42:27] can come up
[42:28] there? You thought you can come up
[42:31] there. Type it
[42:33] spiritually and all your
[42:37] works. Hallelujah. I said, Leo, no man
[42:42] gets
[42:43] here. The
[42:45] capstone, no man crosses that
[42:50] chasm. No man gets here. God puts a man
[42:54] up there.
[42:56] Hallelujah.
[42:58] You climb every physical realm that you
[43:02] can climb. You climb the church ages.
[43:04] Amen. Right up to that gap before the
[43:07] capstone. You can climb all these. You
[43:10] can go through justification and catch a
[43:13] clear revelation of justification. Catch
[43:16] a clear revelation of sanctification.
[43:18] Catch a clear revelation and even
[43:20] manifest the gifts. But outside of that,
[43:23] in this hour, it's still going to take
[43:26] God to put you in that capstone. No man
[43:29] can do that.
[43:32] [Music]
[43:33] Hallelujah. I said you can come here,
[43:36] Leo. See, go back
[43:39] down. Tell the people that it comes from
[43:42] God and God
[43:44] alone.
[43:46] Hallelujah. Now think about it, saints.
[43:49] Unto all people it is given to read the
[43:53] message, to listen to the
[43:55] tapes, to come to a message church. It's
[43:58] given to all people.
[44:01] But unto the bride of Jesus Christ is
[44:03] given to know the mysteries of the
[44:05] message and the revelations that are
[44:07] sealed behind the seven seals in the
[44:09] capstone. Amen. Oh
[44:12] God.
[44:13] Hallelujah. If there's not a desperation
[44:16] in us in this hour that to move into
[44:19] that move into that experience with God.
[44:23] Listen, we're fighting the greatest
[44:24] battle ever fought that the devil don't
[44:27] think the devil is not after you. The
[44:29] devil will throw everything in your
[44:31] life, every distraction your way. He'll
[44:34] put everything in front of you just for
[44:37] one purpose for you not to
[44:41] recognize what God is doing in this
[44:43] hour. What God is revealing this hour.
[44:46] Oh yeah, you can hide behind church. You
[44:50] and there's nothing wrong with the
[44:51] committees and what you do in the church
[44:53] and all the works that you do. You can
[44:55] hide behind that though. You can hide
[44:57] your life behind that. You can hide your
[45:00] your life behind I belong in the
[45:02] message. I was born in the message. That
[45:05] don't mean nothing to God. Hallelujah.
[45:08] Unless you got this token. Unless this
[45:11] token is starting to manifest through
[45:12] your life and making itself known,
[45:15] unless the fruits of that token is
[45:18] manifesting in you. Listen, my brothers
[45:21] and sisters, now I've been praying to to
[45:23] be more and more positive, but unless
[45:26] that is happening inside of you, you're
[45:28] lost. That's the prophet's message.
[45:30] That's the prophet's word. Unless you
[45:33] got that token in this hour. Hallelujah.
[45:36] I'd rather put a a fear and a shaking
[45:39] inside of you. Amen. A desperation
[45:42] inside of you to make sure you got,
[45:44] Amen, what you say you got in this hour.
[45:49] Hallelujah. Glory to
[45:52] God.
[45:54] Amen.
[45:55] Hallelujah. Scripture she's the bride
[45:58] starts recognizing that the scriptures
[46:02] and the quotes the message of the hour
[46:04] that she is reading identifies her and
[46:08] is setting her free as the scripture
[46:11] says you you individually shall know the
[46:16] truth. Amen. What is truth? When you can
[46:21] identify yourself in what the word is
[46:23] speaking, amen, is identifying you.
[46:27] That's the truth. And when that is
[46:29] revealed to you, it sets you free.
[46:32] Hallelujah.
[46:34] Why people are most bondage today is
[46:37] because they don't know who they are.
[46:40] They know the quotes. They come to a
[46:42] message church, but personally inside
[46:45] their soul, it's not been revealed yet
[46:48] to them who they
[46:52] are.
[46:54] Hallelujah. Man cannot
[46:56] change election for anyone. It's not in
[47:00] the power of man. It's only in the power
[47:02] of God.
[47:04] But brother Bam says not everybody's
[47:06] going to receive healing. But I got to
[47:09] preach it like everybody's going to
[47:10] receive healing. Not everybody's bride
[47:13] of Jesus Christ, but you got to preach
[47:15] it like we're all bride of Jesus Christ
[47:17] here tonight. Amen. And it's not for any
[47:21] man to say who it is, who is not, who's
[47:22] not. That ain't in man's hands. That's
[47:25] between you and God. And that day when
[47:27] the rapture takes place, like brother
[47:29] Simon always says, all all things will
[47:31] be settled. All testimonies will be
[47:34] settled and who is left behind and who
[47:36] is gone. Amen.
[47:39] Hallelujah. Amen. Listen, I'm working
[47:42] out my own salvation with fear and
[47:44] trebling. Amen. I can't work out my
[47:46] wife's. All I can do is point her and
[47:49] point her. As God pointed myself to
[47:51] Christ, I can just point her to Christ.
[47:54] But she's got to work out our own
[47:56] salvation. We all as individuals got to
[47:58] work out our own salvation. Amen.
[48:01] There's a desperation every day that I
[48:04] wake up. Every hour I wake up in the
[48:06] middle of the night, there's a
[48:08] desperation inside of me to know more.
[48:11] We are still here. There's still more to
[48:13] be revealed. Hallelujah. I don't know if
[48:16] I'm going to get to it's all down here,
[48:18] but maybe the next time. I don't know.
[48:20] We'll see. The prophet is not the Holy
[48:25] Spirit today. Like people are saying it.
[48:28] They're using the tapes to press play.
[48:30] The prophet to marry people, to baptize
[48:33] people. Amen. To preach to people, it's
[48:36] in their churches. But the prophet is
[48:39] not the Holy Spirit today. Hallelujah.
[48:43] Jesus Christ, the mighty angel, had come
[48:47] down to the prophet. And he is here now
[48:51] to take the word of God and open up and
[48:54] release by the opening of those seals.
[48:57] Zechariah 4:6 says, "Not by might, not
[49:01] by power," think about it, "but by my
[49:04] spirit, say the Lord, it's by the spirit
[49:08] of God that these things are revealed in
[49:11] this day." Amen.
[49:13] John
[49:14] 16:13, just laying these things in so
[49:17] that you can see. Amen. How about when
[49:21] the Spirit of truth has come, he will
[49:23] guide you to all truth. He shall not
[49:25] speak of himself, but whatsoever he
[49:28] shall hear, that shall he speak, he will
[49:31] show you things to come. Who am I
[49:34] talking about here? Christ, the head of
[49:37] the church. The capstone that has come
[49:39] down, the mighty angel who has come
[49:41] down. Amen. Jesus answered them and
[49:44] said, "Blessed art thou Simon by Jonah.
[49:47] Flesh and blood has not revealed it unto
[49:50] you. I don't care how anointed those
[49:52] tapes are, how anointed any preacher is.
[49:55] Amen. It had flesh and blood could never
[49:57] revealed it unto you. But my father
[49:59] which in heaven, Matthew 16:17, has
[50:03] revealed all these truths unto you.
[50:06] Who's revealing these things to you?
[50:08] Who's giving you revelation?
[50:11] Who's delivering you in this hour? Who
[50:14] is bringing you into the capstone in
[50:16] this hour? Jesus. Jesus Christ the
[50:19] mighty angel. Amen. Have you recognized
[50:23] him since he's been risen? Hallelujah.
[50:27] We're going to celebrate Easter. One one
[50:29] person uh said to me says, "God bless
[50:32] you, my brother from the Catholic
[50:34] church." I love the brother. Amen.
[50:37] Joseph name is Joseph Shervetti. I said,
[50:40] "God bless you, my brother." He said,
[50:42] "Brother, we're waiting on the
[50:43] resurrection this weekend." I said, "No,
[50:46] my brother. I can't stand there and and
[50:48] and and just not say nothing and say
[50:50] amen to that. I said, "My brother, I
[50:53] ain't waiting on no resurrection this
[50:54] weekend. He is risen. Hallelujah. He
[50:57] risen 2,000 years ago. Hallelujah. He's
[51:00] not dead, but he's alive forever more.
[51:03] And without that in this day, we cannot
[51:05] be born again." He goes, "Amen,
[51:08] brother."
[51:10] Couldn't say nothing to that. I ain't
[51:12] waiting for his resurrection. He's
[51:15] resurrected in me. Amen. John 3:3 Jesus
[51:18] answered and said unto them, verily,
[51:20] verily, I say unto thee, except the man
[51:22] be born again, he cannot see
[51:26] the kingdom of God. Jesus answered and
[51:28] said, verily, verily, I say unto thee,
[51:30] except the man be born of water and
[51:32] spirit, he cannot enter in. He cannot
[51:35] see the capstone, he cannot enter into
[51:37] the capstone. He don't know the way
[51:39] there. Amen. Amen. It's the bloody
[51:42] footprints. We're following the buddy
[51:44] footprints right into the capstone of
[51:47] love. Amen. Glory to God. You see all
[51:51] the preaching that's been happening.
[51:53] Amen. Before you is just waving it over
[51:57] you. Waving it over you to see who will
[52:01] see Christ, who will catch the
[52:04] revelation. Amen.
[52:06] Who will be lit on fire with the Holy
[52:09] Ghost? Amen. And say, "Identify with
[52:12] that."
[52:13] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Glory. When a
[52:17] person is truly born again under the
[52:19] seven seal revelation, they have started
[52:21] their journey of faith to see the
[52:23] fullness of this capstone revelation of
[52:26] who they are. It's not going to point
[52:30] you to who the prophet is. We know who
[52:32] the prophet is. But this revelation is
[52:35] going to point you to who you are.
[52:39] Oh my. It's going to mold you. It's
[52:42] going to shape you. It's going to cut
[52:43] you. It's going to cut things out of
[52:45] your attitude. It's going to cut things
[52:47] out of your motives and your attentions.
[52:49] It's going to cut things and things that
[52:51] you say, things how you speak, man. It's
[52:55] going to cut desires out of you. It's
[52:57] going to cut pleasures out of you.
[52:59] Hallelujah. It's going to cut good
[53:01] things out of you. Anything that the
[53:03] spirit of God in your life, Amen.
[53:06] Because we got a portion of faith, we
[53:08] got a portion of word in us. Amen. And
[53:10] that word will not return void. Yes,
[53:13] sir. God is going to design your life
[53:15] with trials and temptation because every
[53:18] son and daughter of God must be tried
[53:19] and tested. Amen. He's going to push you
[53:22] through things to get everything out of
[53:24] the way so that word will not return
[53:26] void back to him. But it will
[53:30] accomplish. Oh God, that's all I'm
[53:33] praying. Accomplish inside of me, Lord.
[53:37] No matter what it takes.
[53:40] Listen, 33 years I've been walking. You
[53:43] think 10 years or five years coming into
[53:46] the message, I could receive what I
[53:49] receive now? No. I'd perish. Like the
[53:52] Bible says, little by little, I deliver
[53:54] my people. Brother Brandham put it this
[53:56] way. He says, listen, God can't take
[53:58] everything out of you in one moment.
[54:01] Amen. He can't take all those spirits
[54:03] out of you. Oh yes.
[54:06] Demons, not in your soul. if you've been
[54:08] born again, but in your flesh. Culture
[54:11] demons. Oh, culture demons, especially
[54:14] in some races, are very strong. But God
[54:17] has to break that out of your life. You
[54:20] don't even realize it influences your
[54:22] decisions. It influences your choices.
[54:26] Amen. And how you see things and
[54:29] everything in your life, God will cut
[54:31] those things out of you. And each and
[54:33] every one of us, no matter what it is.
[54:35] Hallelujah. We try to add our culture
[54:38] into the word of God. You can't add your
[54:40] culture into the word of God. Amen. You
[54:43] can't change the word of God for your
[54:45] culture and the way you believe things,
[54:47] the way you're brought up, but the word
[54:49] of God has got to change you into his
[54:52] image. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We don't
[54:56] want that to reflect in our lives. We
[54:59] don't want it to reflect in our in our
[55:01] spirits, in our words, in our choices
[55:04] and our actions. That goes for each and
[55:06] every one of
[55:07] us. Some cultures are stronger than
[55:10] others. We know
[55:12] that.
[55:14] Hallelujah.
[55:19] Amen. This she is has received. She did
[55:23] not receive it intellectually. It was
[55:25] revealed to her by
[55:27] Jesus said by the father. This is not
[55:31] her imagination.
[55:33] She's just not imaginating this. It's
[55:37] been revealed to her. This is not an
[55:39] imagination. And that's where the devil
[55:41] will play on your imagination. In the
[55:44] greatest battle of fought, if your
[55:46] imagination, your your your
[55:49] uh anything in your spirit, I can't
[55:51] think of it right now. It doesn't agree
[55:53] with the word of God, cast it out. Amen.
[55:56] God speaking to your life. He's speaking
[55:58] to your heart. Amen. If Satan comes in
[56:00] that imagination, that memory, amen,
[56:04] your conscience, all these things, and
[56:06] it doesn't agree with what God's
[56:08] speaking to you, cast it out. Amen. We
[56:11] we we we we let the devil battle us
[56:15] longer than we should. Don't let those
[56:18] battles linger. Cast them
[56:21] out. Why ain't I growing? Why ain't I
[56:23] maturing? Why ain't I developing?
[56:26] Because that's
[56:28] why God gave us a message to the church.
[56:31] Brother Brham said, "Greatest battle I
[56:32] ever fought is a message God gave him to
[56:34] the church to follow that." Amen. He
[56:38] gave us how to overcome, how to bring
[56:41] everything under subjection. Amen. All
[56:44] the 10 senses under subjection to the
[56:47] word of God. I can't get into all
[56:50] that.
[56:52] Amen. This is not an illusion.
[56:56] No, no, no,
[56:57] no. Satan will tell you you're you're
[56:59] having this as an illusion. Oh, we all
[57:02] go through
[57:03] it. Brother Brandon went through it.
[57:06] He's seen all the miracles, signs, and
[57:08] wonders, but he still came to a place.
[57:11] That's how real this battle
[57:12] is. He still came to a place where he
[57:16] says, "Oh, I know this is real. These
[57:19] things that I see, these revelations
[57:21] that I'm receiving, this is real. The
[57:23] kingdom of God is real. All these
[57:25] promises are real. He had to go through
[57:27] it. He was the wave sheet. This is not
[57:30] an illusion, my brothers and sisters,
[57:32] but this is a reality to those who are
[57:35] receiving it. Amen. God being made real
[57:39] in his word to her and she is a part of
[57:42] the prophecy. The devil will tell you
[57:44] that it's just your
[57:46] imagination.
[57:48] Hallelujah. But it's not your
[57:50] imagination. It's real revelation. It's
[57:53] the voice of God speaking to you. And
[57:55] when you can get all that out of the
[57:57] way, my brothers and sisters, amen, and
[57:59] get that real inside of you, that this
[58:01] is God's voice speaking to me, this is
[58:04] the real voice of God. This is the God
[58:07] of heaven has come down and he's living
[58:10] in me. Amen. Some people can't even
[58:12] believe God is speaking to them. Then
[58:14] there's another level. God living inside
[58:16] of me. Oh my God. That's perfect faith
[58:20] coming to the bride of Jesus Christ.
[58:22] Amen.
[58:23] Hallelujah. Because the devil will meet
[58:26] you on every level of faith of
[58:28] deception. No matter how much you grow,
[58:31] I know that I've grown and grown and
[58:33] growing. And let me tell you, he meets
[58:35] me on every level. And every time I
[58:37] grow, hallelujah, the word of God
[58:40] becomes more real to me. And then he
[58:42] meets me with deception on that level.
[58:45] Oh, he's wise with the word. He'll know
[58:48] how to take that word and try to make
[58:51] you disbelieve who you are. That's his
[58:55] job. If he can get you disarmed to
[58:58] disbelieve that you're a son and
[59:00] daughter of God, then you're disarmed
[59:02] right there and then. But my God said,
[59:06] when the enemy comes in as a flood, God
[59:09] will raise a standard. Amen. He'll make
[59:11] that word to me, the word that I am more
[59:16] real to me. so I can walk and continue
[59:19] to walk in faith in the Holy Ghost and
[59:22] continue to
[59:24] grow and come to perfect faith.
[59:27] Hallelujah. Praise God.
[59:33] Oh, I got a little bit of thing in my
[59:35] drink there to give me
[59:37] energy.
[59:39] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Amen. We got
[59:43] to be past this
[59:47] where it's good
[59:50] stuff. I better watch what I say. I
[59:53] better watch what I say is electrolytes.
[59:56] Make myself
[1:00:00] clear. I would tell you I would tell you
[1:00:04] it's filled with the Holy Ghost, but
[1:00:05] then you would think I'm a little
[1:00:07] crazy. Amen. The burning bush today.
[1:00:11] Amen. God's voice spoke to uh the Moses
[1:00:15] pro the prophet Moses. Amen. The voice
[1:00:17] spoke out of the burning bush and told
[1:00:19] him his commission. Hallelujah. Oh, what
[1:00:22] did Moses have a lot of excuse? I'm not
[1:00:24] able. I'm not this. I'm not that. And he
[1:00:27] says, I will go with you. I will speak
[1:00:29] through you. Amen. I will perform signs
[1:00:32] and wonders through you. Hallelujah. You
[1:00:34] speak my word to Pharaoh. Hallelujah.
[1:00:37] You speak my word to the devil.
[1:00:39] Hallelujah. And I will perform it.
[1:00:42] Amen. That's all he's called us to do.
[1:00:45] Amen. The bride has to
[1:00:48] speak in this hour. Good people are
[1:00:53] misplacing the very message and the
[1:00:56] prophet's words and his meaning. The
[1:00:59] Holy Spirit is the prophet of this
[1:01:01] capstone age. He speaks to our hearts
[1:01:04] and we can see that the bride has moved
[1:01:07] from brother Brandham the man prophet
[1:01:10] and now walking with the one who
[1:01:12] introduced us to the mighty angel
[1:01:16] himself. This is the bride age. This
[1:01:20] living bride age she's living in in the
[1:01:23] capstone age. That's why it's it'll be
[1:01:27] very close. If it were possible, it
[1:01:30] would deceive the very elected bride if
[1:01:33] it was possible. Hallelujah. But let me
[1:01:36] tell you, this revelation is coming to
[1:01:38] such a place. Amen. We're seeing it.
[1:01:41] It's starting to be preached by the true
[1:01:43] five-fold ministry. These things are
[1:01:45] being exposed out there. Yes.
[1:01:47] Hallelujah. It has nothing to do with
[1:01:49] brother Brandham. Like Luther, he says,
[1:01:52] "It's the people that are following me,
[1:01:54] not Luther's message, not Wesley. It's
[1:01:56] the people that come after." Yes. Wasn't
[1:01:58] it not the truth? Didn't he not say
[1:02:00] that? Hallelujah. Brother Brandham's
[1:02:03] gone. It's not brother Brandham. It's
[1:02:04] the people that have come after him.
[1:02:07] That is messing it all up.
[1:02:11] Hallelujah.
[1:02:12] Amen. Glory to God. In using God's word,
[1:02:17] there are three things that we three
[1:02:20] things that we must not do. Brother
[1:02:23] Brandon speaking here. You must not
[1:02:26] misinterpret the word. for the age that
[1:02:28] we live in.
[1:02:30] You say, "Well, I believe it means this.
[1:02:33] It means just what it says." Now, I'm
[1:02:36] not talking about, catch the revelation.
[1:02:38] I'm not talking about repeating what
[1:02:40] Brother Brandham said and being a
[1:02:42] parent, but there are prophecies that
[1:02:45] have been prophesied to the bride of
[1:02:47] Jesus Christ in this hour. And that's
[1:02:49] what he's saying there. It means just
[1:02:52] what the prophecy says. We can't change
[1:02:55] it. We can't water it down. There will
[1:02:58] be a bride filled with the Holy Ghost,
[1:03:00] filled with perfect faith, filled with
[1:03:03] the same power
[1:03:05] back to the seat form of God again,
[1:03:08] Jesus Christ, living in different
[1:03:12] portions. We're not all going to be
[1:03:14] brother Brandham's portion, but we all
[1:03:16] are different portions of the lick of
[1:03:18] fire inside of us. Oh God, I don't care
[1:03:22] how small your lick of fire is. That
[1:03:23] liquid fire inside of you is more
[1:03:25] powerful than anything inside of you.
[1:03:27] It'll bring your body under subjection
[1:03:29] to the word. It'll bring your spirit.
[1:03:31] It'll bring your mind. I don't care. Oh,
[1:03:33] I got to have the faith like brother
[1:03:35] Danny or brother Tim. No, you don't.
[1:03:38] That pillar of fire, that seed inside of
[1:03:41] you will bring you and your life under
[1:03:44] total submission and subjection to the
[1:03:47] word of God. Amen. That's a
[1:03:50] denominational Catholic spirit. Amen.
[1:03:53] Hierarchy spirit looking at the people
[1:03:56] that are high up. No, it's for every one
[1:03:59] of us. We are all equal in Christ, but
[1:04:02] we got different portions.
[1:04:05] Not all of us can get up here. No,
[1:04:07] listen. You might think you can get up
[1:04:09] here and
[1:04:10] speak that. But that's that's not it.
[1:04:14] That's not it. It's the battle that we
[1:04:17] have to go through before to get a
[1:04:19] thought, to get a message. It's a battle
[1:04:21] that we're up here fighting demons to
[1:04:24] make an effect, casting unbelief out of
[1:04:26] you. Unbelief is being cast out of you
[1:04:28] tonight. And then it's after it's after
[1:04:32] the preacher has to go and fight with
[1:04:33] those spirits cuz they're going to come
[1:04:35] after the preacher. I'm Amen. I'm used
[1:04:38] to it now. Our brother's used to now.
[1:04:41] And I rejoice when that battle comes.
[1:04:43] You know why? Because something
[1:04:45] happened. Somebody was delivered. And I
[1:04:48] take that demon. I wrestle with it. and
[1:04:50] I sent it back to hell so it'll bother
[1:04:53] you no
[1:04:54] more. That's what the real preacher goes
[1:04:57] through. Hallelujah. Brother Brandon
[1:05:00] says, "I'd rather be down there
[1:05:01] receiving eternal life than go through
[1:05:03] the things I have to go through. It's
[1:05:05] not just about speaking."
[1:05:07] Hallelujah.
[1:05:09] Amen. A real minister of God runs from
[1:05:12] this position. I still run from it. I
[1:05:14] say, "Lord, is this my last message?
[1:05:16] I'll be fine with it. Oh, you think I'm
[1:05:19] trying to be humble? People who really,
[1:05:21] really know me. No, this is the truth.
[1:05:23] God has to push me up here. I wasn't
[1:05:26] going to even come up here. And then God
[1:05:28] spoke to me one service. He spoke to me
[1:05:31] and said, "You must fulfill your
[1:05:33] position. You
[1:05:35] must, just like brother Brandham tried
[1:05:37] to walk away from his calling, you walk
[1:05:39] away, your wife will leave you. You'll
[1:05:40] become a bum. We can't walk away from
[1:05:43] this. We pass the point of no return.
[1:05:45] God's word must be fulfilled and come to
[1:05:48] pass in our high. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:05:53] You must not misplace the word. You must
[1:05:55] not dislocate the word. And if we would
[1:05:58] do either of these things, it throws the
[1:06:00] whole Bible into confusion and into
[1:06:03] chaos. Is that what we're seeing out
[1:06:06] there? Is that what we're seeing in the
[1:06:08] message? We talk about a thousand or
[1:06:11] more denominational beliefs and
[1:06:13] teachings out there. You're telling me
[1:06:15] that every Methodist church believes the
[1:06:18] same thing and believes it the same way?
[1:06:20] Then what is that? That's a
[1:06:22] denominational spirit. No different than
[1:06:25] them out there.
[1:06:27] Come on, bright brothers and
[1:06:29] sisters.
[1:06:31] Hallelujah. I'd rather get you scared
[1:06:34] and and and believing in a message and
[1:06:36] message churches and get you scared and
[1:06:38] point you to Jesus Christ, pointing you
[1:06:41] to the pillar of fire. Amen. When you
[1:06:44] got him, you'll never be deceived.
[1:06:46] Hallelujah. Amen. Because you're walking
[1:06:48] with him. Hallelujah. Interpretations is
[1:06:52] an act of explaining, reframing, or
[1:06:54] otherwise showing your own understanding
[1:06:56] of something. Meaning of misplace is
[1:07:00] unable to find. Oh my God, my brothers
[1:07:04] and sisters, unable to find the true
[1:07:06] revelation in this hour. Preaching all
[1:07:09] around it, but can't find it. Can't seem
[1:07:11] to get it.
[1:07:14] Hallelujah.
[1:07:15] Amen. Meaning of dislocate to put out of
[1:07:19] place to
[1:07:22] displace. Oh
[1:07:24] hallelujah. The changing of ages. After
[1:07:27] the seals was open, there was a change.
[1:07:30] The mighty angel was now separating the
[1:07:32] age. He was preparing a bride to cross
[1:07:35] over from one age to another by the
[1:07:39] opening of the seals. We come into the
[1:07:42] capstone experience. Hallelujah. I want
[1:07:46] no other experience. I don't want a
[1:07:48] Pentecostal, a Luther, a a a Wesley
[1:07:52] experience. I want a capstone experience
[1:07:53] because when I got the capstone
[1:07:55] experience, I got the fullness of the
[1:07:57] word experience. I got it all in one.
[1:08:00] Amen. But the the in this age, unless
[1:08:02] you're into that capstone revelation,
[1:08:04] Amen. It doesn't unite explode that that
[1:08:09] word of God in this hour to make a new
[1:08:11] birth inside of you to make Christ come
[1:08:13] alive inside of you. Hallelujah.
[1:08:17] Amen. Hallelujah. Christ was manifested
[1:08:20] in flesh in bride form now. Christ took
[1:08:24] his place now as the head controller of
[1:08:28] the body, the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:08:31] Hallelujah. He's the full controller
[1:08:33] now. Amen.
[1:08:36] Hallelujah. Notice brother Brandham is
[1:08:38] speaking here. Hallelujah. The the
[1:08:41] harmony of the father and son. These are
[1:08:44] all things my brothers and sisters I'm
[1:08:46] speaking here. Amen. May God reveal
[1:08:49] something to you. Amen. The father and
[1:08:53] the son. Jesus never did anything until
[1:08:56] first it was shown to him by the father.
[1:08:58] You see the example there? John 5:19.
[1:09:02] This harmony now exists between the
[1:09:05] groom and his bride.
[1:09:08] It exists now between you and him.
[1:09:12] Hallelujah. He shows her his word of
[1:09:16] life. Amen. Hallelujah. And she receives
[1:09:20] it. She never doubts it. How can she
[1:09:23] doubt it? How can that attribute doubt
[1:09:26] the word of God when it's being revealed
[1:09:28] to her? She can never doubt it. My
[1:09:30] brothers and sisters, no. No, no, no.
[1:09:33] Hallelujah. Like, like we always said,
[1:09:35] you don't know why you believe this
[1:09:37] word, but something inside of you, it
[1:09:39] made sense. It was clear. Hallelujah. I
[1:09:42] don't even know how I understand it at
[1:09:43] times, but oh, God, I see it. It's clear
[1:09:46] to me. Hallelujah. Fits me like a glove
[1:09:48] in my soul.
[1:09:51] Amen. And it hasn't stopped in 33 years
[1:09:54] since I first heard it. No, no, no, no.
[1:09:57] I don't care what condition I got into,
[1:09:59] what backsliding condition I got into.
[1:10:02] He was always faithful. He was always
[1:10:05] faithful to me. That seed of God. That's
[1:10:09] what he's watching over. That word of
[1:10:11] God inside of us. Amen. And as you get
[1:10:13] older, you thank God for that.
[1:10:16] Hallelujah. It brings such a faith
[1:10:18] inside of us that he's watching over
[1:10:20] that word. The devil can't take us. He
[1:10:23] can't do nothing to us. And that is less
[1:10:26] permission from the father because the
[1:10:28] father knows what's in inside of us and
[1:10:30] what needs to be fulfilled inside of us.
[1:10:33] Glory to God. Hallelujah. Just starting
[1:10:36] to get to preach now.
[1:10:38] Hallelujah. Therefore, nothing can harm
[1:10:41] her, not even death. Death, where is
[1:10:44] your sting? Grave, where's your victory?
[1:10:47] Hallelujah. Absent from this body,
[1:10:49] present with the Lord. As brother Chris
[1:10:52] said, if the Lord was going to take me
[1:10:53] and I went in there, I'm not coming
[1:10:55] back. I don't care how beautiful it is,
[1:10:57] whatever. Nah. No. Brother Brandham
[1:10:59] looked down at his body and he says, "I
[1:11:02] have to go back to that old carcass." Oh
[1:11:05] my. Glory to God. I think we're getting
[1:11:07] a foretaste of that place. I think we
[1:11:10] are. I'm not just saying it. I think the
[1:11:12] bride of Jesus Christ is getting a
[1:11:14] foretaste. She's getting a yearning, a
[1:11:17] longing to leave. Are you getting a
[1:11:18] learning a y a longing to leave this
[1:11:21] place to be on the other side? My
[1:11:24] revelation, my experience and this is
[1:11:26] not suicide spirit my brothers and
[1:11:28] sisters is getting a longing to leave to
[1:11:32] experience that translation. Oh, and
[1:11:34] that other dimension. Amen. I get
[1:11:38] jealous when I hear these people that
[1:11:39] are not even born again. They have
[1:11:41] near-death experience and they come back
[1:11:42] and they're saying how glorious it is.
[1:11:44] I'm going, "Oh, God. Lord Jesus.
[1:11:48] Hallelujah. But let me finish my work
[1:11:50] here, Lord. Because I want to hear. Well
[1:11:52] done, good and faithful servant. That's
[1:11:54] what you want to hear. Amen. That's why
[1:11:56] we go through what we go through. That's
[1:11:58] why we sacrifice what we sacrifice.
[1:12:00] That's why we struggle the way we
[1:12:01] struggle. We press through what we're
[1:12:03] doing.
[1:12:05] Press on. Hallelujah. Press on, Lily.
[1:12:09] Amen. Press on. The angel said, "You
[1:12:12] don't know what's waiting for you on the
[1:12:13] other side. We're almost home.
[1:12:16] Hallelujah. Glory to God. We're almost
[1:12:18] home. Press into this faith, my brothers
[1:12:20] and sisters.
[1:12:22] Hallelujah. Don't stop for anything.
[1:12:25] Don't stop for any trial. Don't stop
[1:12:28] even doubt your doubts. Doubt your
[1:12:31] doubts. Don't let your doubts take you
[1:12:34] down. Doubt them.
[1:12:36] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:12:40] For the seed be planted, the water will
[1:12:43] raise it up again and again and again.
[1:12:47] How many times God has raised me up?
[1:12:49] Raise me up. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:12:53] Now, listen. Here's the secret of this.
[1:12:56] You want to know the secret? He tells us
[1:12:59] certain things plain. The word is in the
[1:13:03] bride. As it was in
[1:13:06] Mary, birthed in Mary, the bride has the
[1:13:10] mind of Christ and she knows what he
[1:13:12] wants done with the word. There's a
[1:13:14] secret right there. Why you can't be
[1:13:17] lost. You can't be lost.
[1:13:21] Hallelujah. This isn't about dishonoring
[1:13:24] what the what has been done through the
[1:13:26] prophet's ministry or the truth that
[1:13:29] came forth of the seven church ages.
[1:13:31] It's about recognizing what must now be
[1:13:36] in this crossing over into the capstone
[1:13:38] or the bride age. You know that the
[1:13:40] brother Brandham what we're talking
[1:13:42] about here went through
[1:13:45] that. He went through the same
[1:13:48] experience. He crossed over
[1:13:51] himself. Yes, we still look at we still
[1:13:53] look at him as the the the prophet of
[1:13:56] the seven church ages after 63. But you
[1:14:00] know everything changed for him if you
[1:14:02] can see. If you can't see, you can't
[1:14:04] see. But if you can see everything
[1:14:06] changed for him and he came into this
[1:14:11] ministry right here. That's it. This
[1:14:13] this what's being happening right now.
[1:14:15] He came into this the bride ministry.
[1:14:18] First fruit first fruit came into this
[1:14:21] as being the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:14:24] Yeah. He's still preaching that stuff.
[1:14:25] But listen, he said greater than Solomon
[1:14:27] is here now.
[1:14:29] Hallelujah. Amen. He all the messages
[1:14:32] after 63, look, it wasn't about the
[1:14:35] prophet and the seven church age
[1:14:37] messenger anymore to the leosene church
[1:14:39] age. It was all different. It was all
[1:14:41] about the mighty angel, right?
[1:14:43] Developing and bringing him into that
[1:14:46] capstone. Come on. Hallelujah. So that's
[1:14:48] the same ministry that's taking place
[1:14:50] now. So he crossed over and people don't
[1:14:52] even recognize that he has gone through
[1:14:54] that. They call this Amen. Some people
[1:14:56] will call this not the truth. It's not
[1:14:58] the brother Brandon's message. Wow. But
[1:15:01] he experienced this this word of God
[1:15:03] that's taking place right now in us.
[1:15:06] Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We're here
[1:15:09] today because we had Amen. a messenger,
[1:15:13] brother Simon, that had gone before and
[1:15:15] grew and matured. He didn't see it all.
[1:15:18] He grew and he matured up to here. But
[1:15:20] listen, my brothers and sisters, we're
[1:15:22] at a different time now even to that.
[1:15:25] Not that he doesn't have the revelation,
[1:15:27] but we're at a time at the last the
[1:15:30] baton has been handed now. Hallelujah.
[1:15:33] It's the last smile now. Glory to God.
[1:15:36] We always look at the prophets of old
[1:15:39] and that's what they do out there and
[1:15:40] they worship them. But they had a
[1:15:42] portion. They fulfilled. Amen. Amen. The
[1:15:45] apostles, the prophets had a portion and
[1:15:48] they fulfilled. And we got a portion
[1:15:50] tonight that we got to fulfill.
[1:15:52] Hallelujah.
[1:15:55] Hallelujah.
[1:15:57] Amen.
[1:15:59] Hallelujah.
[1:16:01] Hallelujah. God appointed verse
[1:16:03] manappointed. You see, Saul was chosen
[1:16:06] by people. David was chosen by God. The
[1:16:10] capstone age will not be led by
[1:16:13] popularity, polished platforms. It'll be
[1:16:16] led by the Holy Ghost. and those with
[1:16:19] oil in their heads and in their lamps
[1:16:22] and fire in their eyes. Oh, isn't that
[1:16:25] the age we're living in now? Keep your
[1:16:27] lamps trimmed and filled with oil. What
[1:16:30] did the foolish virgin's mistake was?
[1:16:33] Because she was ordained to that
[1:16:34] mistake. No oil revelation of the
[1:16:38] capstone moving in the capstone
[1:16:41] revelation. The fullness of the
[1:16:43] revelation in her lamp in her body.
[1:16:46] Though she was a virgin, though she
[1:16:48] believed.
[1:16:50] Hallelujah.
[1:16:53] Like we heard the cloth. Think about it.
[1:16:55] The cloth. Here's the cloth. And the
[1:16:58] bride's dress is cut out of the cloth.
[1:17:01] It's all the same cloth, but only the
[1:17:04] bride's dress is going in. That's
[1:17:07] election.
[1:17:09] Predestination. Amen.
[1:17:12] And now how these angels come down.
[1:17:14] Brother Brandon speaking here. along the
[1:17:16] road
[1:17:17] messenger. I'm trying to separate as
[1:17:20] much as I can as a man the difference
[1:17:22] between you know what's happened in this
[1:17:25] age to reveal Jesus Christ and how these
[1:17:29] angels came down along the road the
[1:17:30] messengers of the church ages open up a
[1:17:33] certain part of that now the seventh
[1:17:35] hour the seven messenger that all these
[1:17:37] mysteries should be finished the seventh
[1:17:40] earthly messenger which was brother
[1:17:42] Brandham see this angel that he speaks
[1:17:46] of then was on the earth. The angel
[1:17:49] means messenger. And then after that,
[1:17:52] now
[1:17:54] listen. After that, I know we're tired
[1:17:58] and this and that in our flesh, but
[1:17:59] listen as much that lies with inside of
[1:18:02] you. And after that, he saw another
[1:18:06] angel, which means messenger come down.
[1:18:10] Not the earthly angel. difference
[1:18:14] dividing both of them that has been
[1:18:16] given the message here.
[1:18:21] But not but the other angel, the mighty
[1:18:24] angel, came from heaven with a rainbow
[1:18:27] over him and set his foot on the land
[1:18:30] and the sea and swore by himself and
[1:18:33] lives forever and ever that time shall
[1:18:35] be no more before but before he which
[1:18:41] angel which angel but before he broke
[1:18:47] forth those seven seals to reveal them
[1:18:51] that he showed
[1:18:53] marvelous. He showed it first in the
[1:18:56] heavens, the
[1:18:59] cloud that that day they took the
[1:19:02] picture all across the southern United
[1:19:04] States of Mexico. There it's hanging in
[1:19:06] Life magazine. Still a mystery to them.
[1:19:09] But he declared it in the heavens before
[1:19:13] he, not brother Brandham. He, that
[1:19:16] angel, the mighty angel, does it on
[1:19:18] earth. He always does that. He shows
[1:19:22] signs in the heavens first. The message
[1:19:26] shalom.
[1:19:28] Hallelujah. Can we see that there's
[1:19:31] something different here? Can we see
[1:19:33] start seeing a separation here?
[1:19:37] Hallelujah, sir. Amen. I got a few more
[1:19:41] minutes. Amen. A true shift from one
[1:19:45] place to another is significant change
[1:19:48] in location or circumstances of often
[1:19:52] involving personal growth, learning or a
[1:19:57] change in perspective. It can be
[1:20:00] literally move to a new location or
[1:20:04] change in heart, a revelation that opens
[1:20:07] up a new understanding, a new
[1:20:10] relationship or even shifts one's
[1:20:12] beliefs of the world view. When faith
[1:20:15] opens up to you, it changes your
[1:20:18] location. It brings a greater clarity on
[1:20:22] the word. Today that's moving into the
[1:20:26] capstone of perfect faith for the bride
[1:20:28] of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:20:30] Hallelujah. Amen. When brother Brandham
[1:20:33] said this Bible became a new Bible.
[1:20:35] Amen. After he after those seals were
[1:20:38] open, let me tell you this message when
[1:20:41] the mighty angel comes and faith starts
[1:20:43] opening up to you becomes a new message.
[1:20:46] Hallelujah. I don't see the message the
[1:20:49] way people are preaching it out there.
[1:20:51] There is a true five-fold ministry
[1:20:53] that's got caught the word of God. Oh,
[1:20:56] there is. But they're in the minority.
[1:20:59] The minority.
[1:21:02] Oh my. You're a message hater. Message
[1:21:05] church preacher hater. No. Then Jesus
[1:21:09] was than brother Brandon
[1:21:11] was. If you're reading the same Bible
[1:21:13] and the same message I'm reading,
[1:21:16] hallelujah. The spirits, my brothers and
[1:21:18] sisters.
[1:21:20] Men die, but spirits don't die. Do we
[1:21:22] understand that statement?
[1:21:25] Spirits, they live on. They move on. And
[1:21:28] they and and and what like like brother
[1:21:31] Simon always used to say, those spirits
[1:21:33] know vessels, right? They know
[1:21:36] characteristics. Hallelujah. And they go
[1:21:38] where they where they're allowed to go,
[1:21:40] but they're not allowed to go inside the
[1:21:42] bride of Jesus Christ because that word
[1:21:44] is inside of her. Hallelujah.
[1:21:47] Hallelujah.
[1:21:49] That word is inside of her. Real
[1:21:51] strategies for real shift. So how do we
[1:21:55] get there starts in the
[1:21:58] heart before anything else? We need him
[1:22:01] as the controller of our hearts. We need
[1:22:04] a deep personal connection with Jesus.
[1:22:06] Everything flows from
[1:22:09] intimacy and it identifies from the new
[1:22:12] birth into perfect realization of who we
[1:22:15] are in this hour. What are the
[1:22:18] prophecies to be fulfilled in this hour?
[1:22:21] Hallelujah. In this bride age, it is
[1:22:24] chosen ones coming into perfect
[1:22:26] realization and a perfect relationship
[1:22:29] with the bridegroom. That's what it is
[1:22:31] today. Hallelujah. It isn't the future
[1:22:35] thing, my brothers and
[1:22:36] sisters.
[1:22:38] Hallelujah. You know, that's a spirit
[1:22:41] that has always been through the ages.
[1:22:44] They they they they look at it what God
[1:22:47] did back there. They miss what he's
[1:22:50] doing here and they they see what he's
[1:22:52] going to do in the future. They're
[1:22:54] always saying it's a future thing.
[1:22:56] Listen, this rapture is not a future
[1:22:58] thing. This rapture is on right now.
[1:23:02] This rapture is taking place tonight,
[1:23:05] right now. In individuals. Amen.
[1:23:09] Hallelujah. The capstone age isn't
[1:23:13] somewhere far off in the future. It's in
[1:23:16] front of you right now. Like Jesus said,
[1:23:20] they had the same problem back then.
[1:23:21] They asked Jesus, "When is the kingdom
[1:23:23] coming?" And Jesus, "The kingdom himself
[1:23:26] standing right there and said, "The
[1:23:28] kingdom is standing right before you."
[1:23:31] The kingdom has come. Amen. The kingdom
[1:23:35] of God is here tonight. It has come. It
[1:23:38] stands right before you.
[1:23:42] Hallelujah.
[1:23:44] Amen. Glory to God. God is calling us to
[1:23:48] shift to move from holding ground to
[1:23:52] taken ground. Oh, we love to hold on to
[1:23:55] things. Amen. Didn't Luther do that?
[1:23:58] They got
[1:23:59] justification. What did they do? They
[1:24:01] hold on to it. Oh, we got a truth. Oh,
[1:24:04] we got a revelation. Let's hold on to
[1:24:06] it. But when we hold on to things, my
[1:24:09] brothers and sisters, it denominates
[1:24:11] around us. We're not holding on to
[1:24:13] nothing. We're like the Roman candle. It
[1:24:16] explodes. We see we see a truth. Then it
[1:24:18] explodes again. We see truth more and
[1:24:21] more. Listen, every son and daughter of
[1:24:23] God wants that word to continue to open,
[1:24:26] unfold, reveal itself more and more.
[1:24:29] Amen. More and more of Christ. Amen. We
[1:24:32] don't hold on to things. Amen. We go and
[1:24:36] we take the ground. Amen. From playing
[1:24:40] it safe. Amen. We like playing it
[1:24:43] safe. Walking in per but in walking in
[1:24:46] perfect faith. Stepping out into deeper
[1:24:49] water. Oh, we don't want to step out
[1:24:51] into deeper water. Amen. We got to step
[1:24:54] out into deeper water. Hallelujah. Don't
[1:24:58] get
[1:24:59] comfortable. Don't get complacency in
[1:25:01] this age. It's all around us. Gross
[1:25:04] darkness is around us. All these enemies
[1:25:08] of these spirits of the devil are
[1:25:09] fighting us. It fights me, it fights you
[1:25:13] to get
[1:25:14] complacency.
[1:25:15] Hallelujah. Perfect understanding of the
[1:25:18] season we are in and the faith that will
[1:25:22] produce a body change. Playing it safe
[1:25:24] means to act cautiously and avoid taking
[1:25:28] risk. This life is all about risk.
[1:25:32] This life is all about stepping out in
[1:25:33] faith. Hallelujah. You don't even know
[1:25:36] where you're stepping sometimes. Like
[1:25:38] Abraham, go
[1:25:40] Abraham. Go to a land where I'll show
[1:25:42] you. He had to just go and trust God.
[1:25:45] Amen. No matter what came his way, what
[1:25:48] circumstance came his way, he wasn't
[1:25:51] persuaded to go back. He knew God spoke
[1:25:53] to him. And if you've heard the voice of
[1:25:55] God tell you to go forward. Go into this
[1:25:58] land, this capstone, keep pressing
[1:26:00] forward. Amen. No matter what stands in
[1:26:03] your way, what battle comes your way,
[1:26:05] what circumstances, what hindrance.
[1:26:08] Amen. Your faith tells you to keep going
[1:26:10] forward.
[1:26:12] Hallelujah. Keep pressing on. Amen.
[1:26:15] Glory to God. Amen. And taking ground
[1:26:18] generally refers to process of
[1:26:20] ensuring sharing understanding and
[1:26:23] agreement in a conversation or
[1:26:25] fellowship. This process often invokes
[1:26:28] not acknowledging each other's contrib
[1:26:32] their their tributes and confirming that
[1:26:35] the message is understood. Moving
[1:26:38] forward together once taken ground is
[1:26:41] established. It allows the conversation
[1:26:43] to move forward. Our fellowship
[1:26:46] effectively without misunderstanding or
[1:26:49] confusion. This truth and harmony walks
[1:26:52] together with present truth. When we
[1:26:55] fellowship one another under this
[1:26:57] present truth. What present truth? Not
[1:27:01] just the message, but present capstone
[1:27:04] revelation truth. Amen. That we're
[1:27:06] walking in and moving in. That's the
[1:27:10] harmony. That's where brother Brandham
[1:27:12] said. Remember he said you talk to
[1:27:14] somebody for 5 10 minutes. I don't know.
[1:27:16] That's a number that he said his
[1:27:18] discernment was so high up there. Amen.
[1:27:20] I don't know what it is. But let me tell
[1:27:22] you, my brothers and sisters, Amen. I
[1:27:24] don't care how small it is or how big it
[1:27:26] is when we fellowship. Amen. Under the
[1:27:28] mystery of this age of this capstone
[1:27:32] revelation, I'll know. I'll eventually
[1:27:34] know. And you will eventually know if
[1:27:37] you're walking in that same revelation.
[1:27:39] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Amen. Let me
[1:27:43] just move. I'm going to skip over some
[1:27:45] things here. Got a few minutes this just
[1:27:47] to close this off. Uh the musicians can
[1:27:49] come. Amen. We're going to continue
[1:27:52] this. Amen. Hallelujah. I'll save some
[1:27:55] of this.
[1:27:57] Hallelujah. I want to read a quote here.
[1:28:00] Revelation of the Jesus Christ. Now
[1:28:02] remember this. Christ in the true church
[1:28:05] is a continuation of the book of Acts.
[1:28:08] The book of Revelation shows how the
[1:28:11] Antichrist spirit would come in to the
[1:28:14] church and defile it, making it
[1:28:16] lukewarm, formal, and powerless. We know
[1:28:18] we're under that. Amen. That that
[1:28:21] persecution, that's what Satan is
[1:28:23] fighting us. Amen. But the Bible says to
[1:28:26] the bride of Jesus Christ, "Resist the
[1:28:28] devil and he shall flee." Amen.
[1:28:31] Hallelujah. He It exposes Satan. The
[1:28:34] what? Exposes the word when it's coming
[1:28:36] forth. Amen. Hallelujah. Exposes satan
[1:28:39] Satan revealing his works his attempt
[1:28:42] destruction of God's people and
[1:28:44] discrediting the word of God. What word
[1:28:46] of God? Discreditreing this word of this
[1:28:49] capstone. What God is doing inside of

[1:29:33] the two spirits within the framework of
[1:29:35] the
[1:29:36] message of the Christian church but of
[1:29:39] the message and by God's spirit
[1:29:41] discerning withstanding the antichrist
[1:29:43] spirit by taking the revelation of the
[1:29:45] word for the hour. Satan will be
[1:29:47] powerless before her. He can't stand
[1:29:50] this revelation because he even knows is
[1:29:53] true. He knows what God is doing in the
[1:29:55] bride of Jesus Christ. He knows what's
[1:29:57] prophesied of her in this hour.

[1:30:03] a true revelation in our lives, the
[1:30:05] gates of hell will not prevail against.
[1:30:07] You see how how can it prevail against
[1:30:09] you? It'll attack you. Amen. But it
[1:30:12] won't prevail against you. Amen.
[1:30:14] Hallelujah. Satan will be powerless
[1:30:16] before her. Amen.
[1:30:20] Hallelujah. Amen. And we will prevail
[1:30:23] over him. Listen, my brothers and
[1:30:25] sisters, it's no more reading.
