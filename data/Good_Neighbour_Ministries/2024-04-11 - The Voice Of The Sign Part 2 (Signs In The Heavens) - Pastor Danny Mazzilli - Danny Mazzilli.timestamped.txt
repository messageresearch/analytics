[23:30] some facts and details and things that
[23:34] uh that by the grace of God we can pull
[23:37] from the word of God and I trust that
[23:39] you have faith tonight to um pull from
[23:43] the word
[23:44] amen we can only
[23:47] uh we can only Minister the word of God
[23:51] and then if there's faith in your hearts
[23:53] then uh the Holy Spirit can reveal
[23:56] things and that's what makes makes um
[24:00] the word so
[24:01] exciting for us as Sons and Daughters of

[24:14] to see it I hope you did amen praise God
[24:18] I mean with the proper glasses and so
[24:20] forth you know you got to take all the
[24:23] precautions but um I really enjoyed it I
[24:26] tried to get home in time you know from
[24:29] work to to kind of you know be there
[24:31] with sister Jen to to see it but the
[24:34] traffic was ridiculous I couldn't
[24:36] believe it when I pulled out of Oakville
[24:39] I thought wow that's a lot of traffic on
[24:42] Spears Road and then I get down to the
[24:45] to bronny road and it was just jammed
[24:49] like just jammed so by the time uh it
[24:52] happened I was I I was at the
[24:54] 407 just before Dundas so I just decided
[24:58] Ed to pull right off to the side of the
[24:59] road and I just put my glasses on I
[25:02] opened my sunroof and I watched it and
[25:04] it was it was marvelous I really really
[25:07] enjoyed it praise God I'd never seen a
[25:09] total eclipse in my life praise God so I
[25:13] I had a good time and I trust that you
[25:15] did I I saw a lot of shots and pictures
[25:18] of some of the saints that they uh that
[25:20] they took and I thought there were some
[25:21] really good ones there praise God so
[25:25] let's go to our scripture tonight we're
[25:26] going to read um you can go go to slide
[25:29] number
[25:31] 10 okay we're going to read from Daniel
[25:35] where we left off on Sunday Daniel 2
[25:40] 27-28 and then we're going to read slide
[25:43] number three Psalms our scripture from
[25:46] Psalms um which is from Psalms
[25:50] um actually let's read Psalms first go
[25:53] to chap yeah let's go to Psalms first
[25:56] amen let's pray father
[25:59] thank you tonight Lord for this
[26:01] opportunity to once again Lord to search
[26:04] your scriptures and uh these events that
[26:08] have taken place around us Lord you've
[26:10] given us um the spirit of discernment to
[26:14] recognize and to see Lord beyond what
[26:17] the human eye would see Lord we're we're
[26:20] listening for your voice through it all
[26:22] Lord because um Revelation is what stirs
[26:26] our hearts and what gives us um Liberty
[26:30] and and to know who we are and the hour
[26:32] that we're living in so we just ask that
[26:35] you would continue tonight Lord let your
[26:37] anointing come upon the word father and
[26:39] just bless us tonight father we pray in
[26:41] Jesus name amen Psalms
[26:48] 19 verses 1 to5 it says the heavens
[26:51] declare the glory of God and the
[26:54] firmament show his handiwork day unto
[26:57] day utth speech and night unto night
[27:00] showeth knowledge there is no no no
[27:04] speech nor language where their voice is
[27:08] not heard their line is gone out through
[27:12] all the Earth and their words to the end
[27:14] of the world in them hath he set a
[27:18] tabernacle for the sun which is as a
[27:21] bridegroom coming out of his chamber and
[27:25] rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race
[27:30] praise God you may be
[27:32] seated amen this scripture tells us very
[27:36] clearly that the Lord has set his word
[27:40] um his first Bible in the heavens and we
[27:42] were looking at that on Sunday and we
[27:45] were able to draw so many um things from
[27:49] the scriptures and we looked at how the
[27:51] Zodiac has been you know taken out of
[27:54] context and perverted and how that you
[27:58] know people are looking for signs
[28:00] they're always looking to hear what
[28:02] their future holds and they're trying to
[28:04] figure out what their future holds and
[28:06] they'll go to the Zodiac they'll go to
[28:09] psychics they'll go to try and find out
[28:11] things but we know that that God's word
[28:14] is only given by Divine Revelation by
[28:17] the word of God Amen and that Faith
[28:20] cometh by hearing and by hearing the
[28:22] word of God and so we were looking um at
[28:27] um how you know it was basically the
[28:31] Lord doesn't want us to be looking
[28:33] anywhere else he wants us to look to his
[28:36] word amen and um we read in Daniel chap
[28:40] 2 verse
[28:42] 27-28 Daniel answered in the presence of
[28:44] the king because the King was looking
[28:46] for answers he was having dreams and so
[28:49] he was getting you know signs and and uh
[28:52] things that that were in his dreams that
[28:54] were troubling him and just like a lot
[28:56] of people out there to day they're
[28:59] seeing all kinds of events that are
[29:00] happening worldwide they're trying to
[29:02] figure out what's going on they can't
[29:05] figure it out but Daniel turns around
[29:07] and says the secret which the king hath
[29:09] demanded cannot the wise men the
[29:12] astrologers The Magicians the
[29:15] soothsayers show unto the king but there
[29:18] is a
[29:19] God Amen there is a God in heaven that
[29:22] revealeth secrets and maketh known to
[29:25] the King Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in
[29:28] the latter days and so that's where we
[29:31] ended off and so here we are we're
[29:33] living in the latter days you can go to
[29:35] slide 11 now we'll go from there and
[29:37] we'll just continue
[29:38] on and so um we have just um uh
[29:43] experienced another solar
[29:46] eclipse and um the solar
[29:49] eclipses uh the ones that were kind of
[29:53] um you know interested in is the is the
[29:55] last two that just took place
[29:58] there's there was one in 2017 and there
[30:00] was one in
[30:01] 2024 now I want to give you a little bit
[30:04] of history on the solar eclipses that
[30:06] have taken place first of all you need
[30:09] to recognize that um the significance of
[30:12] these total solar eclipses is that they
[30:15] have happened in
[30:18] America where did God sent the prophet
[30:21] to America where did he come out of
[30:23] America and so here we are in North
[30:27] America and these things that are taking
[30:29] place we want to you know kind of see
[30:32] how it is that you know it ties into to
[30:35] us we know that the message of the hour
[30:38] is worldwide that the prophet did not
[30:41] just come to America but in fact coming
[30:44] out of America and ministering to
[30:48] America we also know that the word of
[30:51] God was pronounced against America
[30:54] through the prophet of Malachi 45 in
[30:57] that he
[30:58] indicted this generation for the second
[31:02] crucifixion of the word of God in other
[31:05] words they rejected the word They
[31:07] Crucified the word they they spoke
[31:10] against the word and America basically
[31:13] uh would go into darkness and that there
[31:16] would be no real opportunity for the
[31:21] nation of America you know a lot of
[31:23] people would like to say oh well America
[31:25] you know can still repent and and uh you
[31:28] know and turn and God will not pour out
[31:31] his wrath upon America sorry the only
[31:35] way and the only people that can repent
[31:38] are those
[31:39] individuals the Sons and Daughters of
[31:42] God that need to be birthed by the word
[31:46] of God somebody's singing somebody's
[31:48] phone is
[31:49] singing yeah praise God just a reminder
[31:53] to make sure you put your phones on
[31:55] silence and so um
[31:58] America received uh their last
[32:02] sign they received their last word as a
[32:06] nation okay you know it was in 19 or in
[32:10] 1776 that America became a nation and in
[32:14] in
[32:15] 1778 there was um there was a total
[32:18] eclipse it was the first one that was
[32:19] registered by nasau okay after that now
[32:23] we're going to look at the the the 20th
[32:25] century solar eclipses and we're going
[32:27] to see from there that there's you know
[32:30] certain um correlations that we can draw
[32:33] from the message of the hour and the
[32:36] word of God that we know has been
[32:38] revealed to us and given to us through a
[32:40] Vindicated Prophet amen now um the total
[32:45] solar eclipses are
[32:47] rare and aren't often visible from the
[32:50] US the last time one occurred here was
[32:53] in
[32:54] 2017 and the US won't will not see
[32:57] another another one until
[32:59] 2044 okay now I'm going to just run off
[33:03] a list of total solar eclipses in the US
[33:08] during the 20th century okay the first
[33:12] one was in 1900 right in the year 1900
[33:16] it was the first eclipse of the 20th
[33:19] century it was in 1900 according to the
[33:22] park services the path of totality of
[33:26] that Eclipse brought it over
[33:28] Wadesboro North
[33:31] Carolina okay in
[33:34] 1918 18 years later a total solar
[33:38] eclipse was visible from Washington to
[33:41] Florida according to the parks Services
[33:45] okay and this is information that comes
[33:47] also through NASA it was the last time a
[33:50] solar eclipse would be visible across
[33:53] the entire continent for nearly 100
[33:58] years because it wasn't until
[34:03] 2017 that another one took place and
[34:06] we're talking total in that fully
[34:10] visible from the US and over the US from
[34:14] coast to coast all
[34:16] right after that there was another one
[34:20] in 1925 and this was followed um uh on
[34:25] January the the sometime in January 1925
[34:30] which was visible from Minnesota through
[34:32] New England according to NASA now I want
[34:35] you to note here seven years apart from
[34:38] 1918 to 1925 7 years apart interesting
[34:44] right Lord Works in sevens
[34:47] 1932 is the next one from 1925 to
[34:52] 1932 7 years apart in August 1932
[34:56] another totally Eclipse was visible in
[34:59] North America the path of totality for
[35:02] this Eclipse was mostly in Canada okay
[35:06] according to NASA but was visible in in
[35:10] Northern New England including parts of
[35:12] Vermont Maine New Hampshire and
[35:16] Massachusetts okay Again 1932 was a
[35:20] significant year that was the year that
[35:22] the prophet basically brought forth some
[35:25] prophecies the year later 1933 and that
[35:29] was the time that he was actually
[35:30] starting to come on the scene with his
[35:33] public Ministry okay 1963 now 30 years
[35:38] later 1963 was the next total solar
[35:42] eclipse in the US and um this Eclipse
[35:46] was visible in Alaska and parts of
[35:48] Northern New England according to nasau
[35:51] what happened in
[35:53] 1963 the opening of the word the coming
[35:57] of the Lord Lord sunset Mountain amen
[36:01] praise God Revelations 10 1-7 the
[36:05] opening of The Seven
[36:07] Seals so there was 30 years between 1932
[36:11] and
[36:12] 1963 then the next one after 1963 was
[36:16] seven years later again notice the
[36:18] sevens okay March
[36:21] 1970 another total eclipse solar eclipse
[36:25] was visible from the coast of Southwest
[36:28] United
[36:29] States okay um again seven years
[36:35] apart and
[36:38] then we come
[36:41] to
[36:44] 2017 okay so in
[36:47] 2017 we had another total solar eclipse
[36:51] from coast to coast across the
[36:54] US right right across to to from one
[36:58] Coast to the other and it was a 100
[37:00] years after the last one okay now the
[37:05] crossing points are interesting we're
[37:06] going to be looking at those let's go to
[37:09] the next
[37:13] slide I want you to notice here now on
[37:15] this next slide it shows the path of
[37:19] totality going through the United States
[37:23] from one end to the other
[37:26] 2017 um is uh the one that's coming from
[37:29] the top down and the one of 2024 is the
[37:34] one from the bottom up you'll notice
[37:36] that it puts a big cross right over
[37:41] America okay the 2017 Great American
[37:45] Eclipse had a path Over America that
[37:47] passed by seven
[37:50] Salems okay at that time there was
[37:53] there's cities throughout the United
[37:55] States now the actual path of totality
[37:59] did not go or like you know where the
[38:01] total eclipse was did not go directly
[38:05] over seven Salems but if you look at
[38:08] those
[38:10] um uh well they're not they're not
[38:13] actually written on this map here okay
[38:16] but it was the one that goes from the
[38:18] top down down from the top all the way
[38:22] down there there are seven Salems in
[38:25] various United States
[38:29] um uh States okay significance of that
[38:33] well Salem we know is you know Shalom
[38:38] peace right the king of Salem was
[38:42] MDC okay you know I I'm just looking at
[38:45] all these things and meel MDC come out
[38:48] which was the king of Salem king of
[38:50] Peace the king of righteousness the king
[38:53] of Jerusalem that's brother brandham
[38:56] back in 1964
[38:58] and we are after the order of
[39:00] mzc all right and we've been under the
[39:03] leadership of mzc amen and God has a
[39:07] royal priesthood after the order of mzc
[39:11] and there's only one people that um
[39:15] Shalom uh can be directed to and that is
[39:18] the Sons and Daughters of the Living God
[39:21] to us it is Shalom but to the world
[39:24] they're going into more chaos it's going
[39:27] to get worse and then you look
[39:30] here um the the eclipse of
[39:34] 2024 first of all um it goes right
[39:39] across the US ends in Canada and um
[39:44] we're going to be looking at this later
[39:45] on but you'll note that there are seven
[39:48] ninas okay in the states in different
[39:52] parts of the United States that this
[39:55] kind of passes by okay it actually goes
[39:59] over two ninas one in
[40:02] Indiana that's significant right and
[40:06] another one in Ohio all right but the
[40:08] one that that kind of you know piqued my
[40:10] attention was the one in
[40:13] Indiana also just
[40:16] before um we had the eclipse here on
[40:19] Monday you'll note that on um I think it
[40:22] was Thursday or Friday that New York had
[40:24] a
[40:25] 4.8 magnitude ude earthquake okay 48 is
[40:30] April VI eth okay I know these are just
[40:34] simple things but but you see we are the
[40:37] sons and daughters of God we have the
[40:39] ability to catch the Revelation behind
[40:42] everything that's going on and we know
[40:45] that that that the message of the hour
[40:48] is the Revelation to this world there is
[40:52] no other Revelation outside of this of
[40:56] the message of the hour that we are
[40:58] carriers of we carry the pure
[41:01] unadulterated word of God and in US is
[41:05] the ability to recognize discern and
[41:08] draw out the mind and the faith and the
[41:11] Revelation that God is giving us praise
[41:15] God okay I want you to notice too that
[41:18] they ma they made
[41:19] mention of an
[41:21] enormous Comet that was actually visible
[41:25] during the Eclipse that took place on
[41:29] Monday this comet is called the devil
[41:32] Comet it's been it's been given the name
[41:35] the devil Comet because if you actually
[41:37] see it and I actually did see it it it's
[41:40] like it's like a round and then it's got
[41:43] like two horns coming up through the top
[41:45] of it and it looks like the devil the
[41:48] head of the devil right and that's why
[41:50] they gave it the nickname The Devil's
[41:52] Comet but what's interesting is that it
[41:54] was actually visible during the eclipse
[41:58] okay because of the darkness and the
[42:00] timing of it and I'll tell you it um it
[42:04] was passing by the Earth for the first
[42:06] time in more than seven decades 70 years
[42:11] okay the comet officially known as 12p
[42:15] ponds Brooks got its nickname due to the
[42:19] formation of two horns made up of ice
[42:23] and gas experts told the NBC the it has
[42:27] been unusually bright compared to others
[42:31] okay it's apparently the size of Mount
[42:35] Everest and orbits the sun about every
[42:38] 71 years so the last time that it
[42:42] actually orbited was in
[42:46] 1953 the next time it will return is
[42:49] like
[42:50] 2095 so I went back and I searched when
[42:54] did Brother brandham you know actually
[42:56] make mention of the serpent seed and
[43:00] expose the serpent seed and I went back
[43:04] and from
[43:06] Wikipedia I got
[43:08] this about William brandom it says in
[43:10] his recorded sermons branam first
[43:14] publicly hinted at his belief in the
[43:17] serpent Seed doctrine in
[43:20] 1953 he began to openly teach the
[43:24] serpent seed in
[43:26] 1958
[43:28] I did a research on the table you know
[43:31] the you know the table for brother
[43:33] brandham and the first result that came
[43:36] up when I did the search was from the
[43:38] message the pillar of fire
[43:42] 1953
[43:44] okay oh big deal it is a big deal okay
[43:49] these things don't happen by coincidence
[43:52] these things are God's Bible declaring
[43:56] in the heavens I mean if we could you
[43:58] know like I started reading um a book
[44:02] on God's Bible in the heavens and I'm
[44:05] really enjoying it like I'm I'm just I
[44:07] want to just you know read it constantly
[44:11] but in there you know like it just shows
[44:14] like without the shadow of a doubt that
[44:17] God wrote everything in the heavens it's
[44:20] all there and if we actually take the
[44:23] time you know to to study it and look
[44:25] into it it's just full of nuggets okay
[44:29] but you know obviously we can't get into
[44:31] all of that but um I found that
[44:34] interesting so the crossing points of
[44:37] the two
[44:38] eclipses of the 21st century which is
[44:41] the the only two that have now taken
[44:43] place that because we're in the 21st
[44:45] century was the one in 2017 and the one
[44:48] in
[44:49] 2024 and you see that you see where they
[44:52] cross
[44:53] there well you look to the just to the
[44:56] right of the cross there there's a place
[45:00] called Rapture
[45:04] Indiana you know I came across that um
[45:07] you know while I was doing the research
[45:09] on the internet and you know because
[45:11] somebody had mentioned that and they
[45:12] actually you know they these people that
[45:15] that kind of on YouTube they went and
[45:17] did a trip and they actually went there
[45:19] they drove to go and see what was
[45:21] actually there it's basically in the
[45:22] middle of nowhere you know but it was
[45:24] kind of funny I was watching it and I
[45:26] was kind of
[45:27] you know laughing because they would
[45:29] come across certain things and and you
[45:31] know as they were going there they came
[45:32] to this one street that was like within
[45:35] a few miles of of rapture Indiana and
[45:40] and the name of the road was
[45:41] Resurrection drive you know and and you
[45:45] know all these little things and they
[45:46] were kind of snickering at it they were
[45:48] laughing at it but they don't realize
[45:50] that that this this is all about the
[45:53] resurrection this is what we've
[45:55] recognized this is what differentiates
[45:58] us from the rest of of the Christian um
[46:02] you know denominational world is that
[46:05] we've recognized that the resurrection
[46:07] is present and here right now and he's
[46:11] resurrected us and taking us into
[46:13] Heavenly places where we can recognize
[46:16] the word recognize what God is doing in
[46:18] our day and it differentiates us
[46:21] completely from the rest of the world
[46:24] Amen so um the the eclipse of Monday
[46:28] actually did pass over Jeffersonville
[46:31] okay but it was
[46:33] only like it was only seen like as a
[46:36] partial eclipse okay very very partial
[46:40] you know and that kind of caught my
[46:42] attention because I thought oh you know
[46:44] didn't brother brandham say a sliver of
[46:47] light you know and it kind of just
[46:49] triggered you know my my thoughts
[46:51] towards that and so um you know for the
[46:55] bride she'll have light in the evening
[46:57] time amen that's what we're feasting on
[47:00] now we know that God has given us light
[47:02] to recognize his word today and so I
[47:05] went into the um into the um search and
[47:09] I found here brother brandham speaking
[47:10] from um the seven Church ages
[47:14] here he said Matthew 24 mentions signs
[47:18] in the heavens concerning this last day
[47:22] just before Jesus comes I wonder if you
[47:25] noticed such a sign recently fulfilled
[47:29] as to portray the very truth we have
[47:32] been discussing the truth is that Jesus
[47:36] has been steadily pushed aside until in
[47:40] the last age he is pushed aside he is
[47:44] pushed outside the church recall that in
[47:47] the first age it was almost a full orbed
[47:51] Church of Truth yet there was little
[47:55] error called there was a little error
[47:58] called the Deeds of the
[48:00] nians that kept the circle from being
[48:03] full then in the next age more Darkness
[48:06] crept in until the ball of light glowed
[48:10] less and darkness covered more of the
[48:13] circle in the third age it was eclipsed
[48:17] still more and in the fourth age which
[48:20] was the Dark Ages the light had all but
[48:23] gone now think on this the church
[48:27] shines in the reflected Light of Christ
[48:31] he is the sun the church is the moon
[48:35] thus this orb of light is the Moon it
[48:38] has decreased from almost a full moon in
[48:43] the first age to a sliver in the fourth
[48:46] age but in the fifth age it began to
[48:48] grow in the sixth age it the great step
[48:52] of growth forward this is when the
[48:54] Reformation started right Luther Wesley
[48:58] and then Pentecost
[49:00] right and then um
[49:02] Christ uh so that instead of
[49:07] light oh sorry to the sliver in the
[49:10] fourth age but in the fifth age began to
[49:12] grow in the sixth it took a great step
[49:14] of growth forward in part of the seventh
[49:17] age it was still growing when suddenly
[49:20] it stopped short and wan to almost a
[49:23] nothingness so that instead of light it
[49:27] was the Blackness of apostasy and at the
[49:30] end of the age it had ceased to shine
[49:33] for the darkness had taken over Christ
[49:36] was now outside the church and we know
[49:40] that if it wasn't for William Mary and
[49:42] brandham coming in the seventh Church
[49:45] age in the leoan church age there would
[49:48] have been total darkness everything was
[49:52] basically going to Darkness but there
[49:55] was going to be a bre pred and God was
[49:58] going to allow a SL a sliver of light to
[50:02] come so that there could be a
[50:05] restoration and this is what has been
[50:07] taking place since
[50:10] 1963 as soon as the prophet's Ministry
[50:13] went into the opening of The Seven Seals
[50:17] that was when the word was opened the
[50:20] seven seal was opened and the Word was
[50:24] being revealed and it started to call
[50:27] every son and daughter of God out of
[50:31] denomination out of you know uh
[50:35] doctrines of man and teachings of man
[50:39] praise God and
[50:42] so the pope now watch he goes on to say
[50:45] here it waned to total darkness in seven
[50:48] stages in the seventh stage the total
[50:51] darkness came as the pope of Rome Paul v
[50:53] 6 went to Palestine that took place in
[50:57] 1964 okay it was in
[51:01] 1964 that the pope went to Palestine the
[51:04] pope is named Paul the 6 Paul was the
[51:06] first messenger and this man goes by the
[51:10] by the name by the same name notice it
[51:13] is the sixth or the number of men this
[51:16] is more than a coincidence and when he
[51:19] went to Jerusalem the moon or the church
[51:22] went into total darkness that was when
[51:24] there was a lunar eclipse that's when it
[51:27] was you know that that the world was
[51:30] basically at its darkest point right
[51:34] when the pope was actually you know
[51:36] going the last time a pope visited the
[51:38] Holy Land um which was in
[51:41] 1964 Jerusalem was a physically divided
[51:45] City with landmines basically
[51:49] separating Palestine and Israel okay
[51:52] they were in they were in like a serious
[51:53] War okay and it was the 1967 you know
[51:57] six- day war that basically you know was
[52:00] another major event but but look at all
[52:04] the timing of all of these things and
[52:06] now look at the timing of where we are
[52:09] today and recognize how Israel is in a
[52:12] complete state of War okay um this war
[52:18] they
[52:19] want they want to divide the land they
[52:22] can never do it we you know we'll look
[52:24] at all that later on as we move along
[52:26] here you know brother brandham here he
[52:29] um in the message Shalom 1964 he says
[52:32] and isn't it strange that just before
[52:34] the pope took his journey to Jerusalem
[52:37] that the moon in the heavens made a
[52:39] total blackout just a few days before he
[52:42] took it his journey he's coming here
[52:45] also you know see now that's never been
[52:48] known see but what does it show that
[52:52] this he's doing this to win Fellowship
[52:55] as he met on the day after he come into
[52:58] Jerusalem he met with the Greek Orthodox
[53:01] hierarchy and what does that reflect
[53:04] Fellowship they're wanting Protestants
[53:07] and Catholicism joining together which
[53:11] they are doing and will completely do
[53:14] and we know that you know this is all
[53:18] part of what's happening with the World
[53:21] Council of churches and them coming
[53:23] together and so forth right
[53:27] so um and God reflected this to us in
[53:31] the moon of a total blackout by his
[53:34] mercy and Grace did any of you see the
[53:37] paper where they took the pictures of
[53:39] the Moon I have it here if it ain't a
[53:42] perfect image leaving out the seventh
[53:45] age which is not yet exactly the way I
[53:49] draw by the Holy Spirit the seven Church
[53:52] ages there's the six of them the seventh
[53:56] is not not finished yet the six
[53:59] conditions of the Moon how it is how in
[54:02] its brightness is the first church age
[54:04] dark in the second third fourth fifth
[54:07] and sixth just the way the holy spirit
[54:10] let me draw them on the board and then
[54:13] identified them with himself on the wall
[54:17] of the Tabernacle two years ago the the
[54:20] the Moon reflects itself and science
[54:23] again picks up the picture of the church
[54:26] Pages just as they picked up that light
[54:29] Yonder and put it in Life Magazine of
[54:33] the opening of the seals of the
[54:36] revealing in the age of the seventh
[54:39] angel and so we're going to be you know
[54:41] as we progress through this um we're
[54:44] going to finish it up on Sunday with you
[54:47] know talking how it all led to the last
[54:51] sign and how we've been given a sign and
[54:54] how the world actually missed the
[54:56] greatest
[54:57] sign but to those that have ears and to
[55:00] those that have
[55:02] representation they can't miss it the
[55:04] opening of the seals and the revealing
[55:07] in the age of the seventh angel in the
[55:09] days of his ministry the seventh
[55:11] messenger the mysteries of God which all
[55:15] the Mysteries has been along the ages
[55:17] should be revealed made manifest it
[55:20] should be at that time and he did
[55:24] it his words don't fail isn't that a
[55:28] mysterious thing God drawing in the
[55:30] heavens the thing the same thing that
[55:33] they hold same God let me draw it on the
[55:36] Blackboard and then by himself that's
[55:39] three times he's perfectly identified
[55:42] and just before the pope goes into
[55:45] Jerusalem which that was the church the
[55:48] Moon is the church represents the church
[55:51] and before the church the shadow of the
[55:53] world crosses the moon and the shadow of
[55:56] the world worldism the shadows of
[55:58] worldly ISM worldly church has swept AC
[56:02] cross to black out the entire light of
[56:05] the Bible the whole world went into
[56:08] absolute
[56:10] darkness when they rejected the word of
[56:14] God Amen praise God the world crossed in
[56:17] the light of the Moon and blinded out
[56:19] the sun and the reflection of the Moon
[56:22] that's supposed to be giving light to
[56:24] the Earth it was blacked out and it come
[56:26] in and draw the pictures just exactly
[56:29] like it did by inspiration before it
[56:34] happened praise God these eclipses over
[56:37] the last seven
[56:39] years I want you to know that they also
[56:42] they also signify the rising of the
[56:46] Bride okay because the the the solar
[56:49] eclipse okay where the where the moon
[56:51] now is coming into its fullness okay
[56:55] there's there's two sides sides to this
[56:57] the Gentile world is coming to the end
[57:01] of the Gentile dispensation if it hasn't
[57:03] already ended we don't know it could
[57:07] already have ended and you know God is
[57:10] just perfecting his bride for the
[57:13] Rapture because the Gentiles they they
[57:18] are now in total darkness unless they
[57:21] receive this Revelation that is in the
[57:25] Bride of Jes Jesus Christ the true
[57:27] church not saying just this church here
[57:30] there's the body of Christ and the bride
[57:33] is is is a is a
[57:35] supernatural body it's a many membered
[57:38] body that's all over the Earth but
[57:41] they're seeing the revelation of this
[57:43] word and they're hearing the voice of
[57:46] God through this message which is a
[57:49] message that calls you back to the word
[57:51] of God a message that tells you that God
[57:55] was progressing
[57:56] in the reformation and has progressed to
[58:00] the 20th century prophet in the in the
[58:03] uh calling out of William Mariam branam
[58:06] a Vindicated Prophet out of America to
[58:09] bring a restored word to call a people
[58:13] back to the original word amen praise
[58:17] God and so we know that um that there's
[58:21] a rise in in women power too okay
[58:26] everything everything remember the
[58:28] church types women women type the church
[58:31] you wanna brother brand would say you
[58:33] want to see the condition of the church
[58:35] just look at the condition of the women
[58:38] that are in the church okay now nothing
[58:41] against women but look at their
[58:44] condition look at their attitudes okay
[58:47] remember the reason why you know people
[58:50] say oh you're talking about women why
[58:52] did William Bram talk about women he was
[58:54] not specific ially talking about women
[58:58] the bride the church is a woman because
[59:02] Christ is the
[59:04] bridegroom Christ is the word and the
[59:08] church is the bride in the bride there's
[59:11] male and female it's not just male it's
[59:15] not just female okay it is the body of
[59:19] Jesus Christ but it's typed in a church
[59:23] and so when we talk about women we're
[59:26] not talking about
[59:28] women specifically we're talking about
[59:31] the condition of the church because the
[59:35] bride is is the is the wife of Jesus
[59:38] Christ okay and so when you see the
[59:42] women completely you know ha half naked
[59:46] going into the churches with mini skirts
[59:48] on showing sex appeal you know showing
[59:51] all of the things that that you know
[59:53] that is that that would cause a man to
[59:57] lust or even a woman these days to lust
[59:59] after one another right it's the
[1:00:02] condition of the world and it's the
[1:00:04] condition that that
[1:00:07] identifies the real true church that's
[1:00:10] why you know people will will come into
[1:00:12] our churches and they'll notice that the
[1:00:14] women they dressed modestly they wear
[1:00:17] dresses Okay go back into history up
[1:00:20] until the
[1:00:23] 1950s 9.8 women that you would ever see
[1:00:27] walking on the streets would would be
[1:00:29] wearing a dress it was not until the 60s
[1:00:33] until you know the great you know
[1:00:36] Darkness started to really come over the
[1:00:38] land and and the whole world went into
[1:00:40] total darkness that that women started
[1:00:43] to rise up you know started to remove
[1:00:46] their clothing their their dresses now
[1:00:48] started to come up higher and higher and
[1:00:50] higher and they got Tighter and Tighter
[1:00:52] and Tighter what was it showing it was
[1:00:54] showing Rebellion it was showing
[1:00:57] Rebellion against the word of God
[1:00:58] because the word of God says that a
[1:01:00] woman should dress modestly you know
[1:01:03] that that that she should not be dressed
[1:01:05] in a way that would cause a man to lust
[1:01:08] after her right these are just you
[1:01:12] know this is just common uh decency uh
[1:01:16] in the word of God okay and so here we
[1:01:20] are now and we're living in the you know
[1:01:23] in the 21st century and my God you can
[1:01:26] barely drive down the street and there's
[1:01:29] you know billboards with with you know
[1:01:31] like exposed women and and you you know
[1:01:35] like magazines every time you go into a
[1:01:38] store you look at the magazines you just
[1:01:40] just look over and you and you'll see
[1:01:43] all kinds of exposure right and it's all
[1:01:47] over the social media it's all over it's
[1:01:49] taking it's taking a hold of the young
[1:01:52] people pornography all of these things
[1:01:54] we're in an age where where where the
[1:01:57] minds of the people is being completely
[1:01:59] consumed by by the by
[1:02:03] the apostasy of God's
[1:02:07] word
[1:02:09] amen but the bride she's coming into her
[1:02:13] fullness and that's why the fullness of
[1:02:15] the moon and the sun when you look at
[1:02:19] the Moon and the Sun as as a a true
[1:02:22] Christian you see the
[1:02:24] sun typing Christ having your back he
[1:02:29] stands with you you become one the two
[1:02:33] are one he's got you he's got you
[1:02:36] covered because you you you've you've
[1:02:38] you've accepted him fully you've you've
[1:02:42] taken the fullness of the word of God
[1:02:45] and you've allowed yourself to be
[1:02:46] dressed in the fullness of God's word
[1:02:49] and in the fullness of his humility upon
[1:02:52] your life praise God and
[1:02:57] so these things are are you know things
[1:03:00] that we need to um recognize that um
[1:03:05] that that give us you know and allow us
[1:03:07] to hear God's word through these
[1:03:12] events let's go to the next
[1:03:18] slide this one
[1:03:20] here
[1:03:22] is the most recent eclipse that took
[1:03:26] place on Monday and all of those yellow
[1:03:30] and red dots are
[1:03:32] ninas that kind
[1:03:34] of they were in the path not directly in
[1:03:39] the totality but in the path okay and if
[1:03:45] we go to um to the next
[1:03:50] slide Luke 11:
[1:03:54] 28-32 Jesus
[1:03:58] he says here but he said yay rather
[1:04:01] blessed are they that hear the word of
[1:04:03] God and keep it now you got to
[1:04:06] understand the time that he was in and
[1:04:08] who he was talking to and when the
[1:04:11] people were gathered thick together in
[1:04:14] other words there was a big crowd okay
[1:04:17] and here he was Jesus was on the earth
[1:04:20] in his public Ministry all right he
[1:04:23] began to say this is an e evil
[1:04:27] generation okay well I could just
[1:04:30] imagine if you could look into this
[1:04:33] generation and see the condition of the
[1:04:36] global world and the condition of the
[1:04:40] people and the condition
[1:04:44] of the confusion between you know same
[1:04:49] sex and you know genders all kinds of
[1:04:53] different genders you want to talk about
[1:04:55] a a perverse like you know it's a
[1:04:57] perverse generation okay they've gone
[1:05:01] into total where the word of God has is
[1:05:04] absolutely it's just of none effect to
[1:05:07] the people anymore and here he's
[1:05:09] speaking he says this is an evil
[1:05:10] generation and they seek a sign that's
[1:05:13] why you know whenever there's you know
[1:05:15] these these eclipses and total solar
[1:05:18] eclipses or signs in the heavens
[1:05:20] everybody gets attracted to them
[1:05:21] everybody gets excited everybody wants
[1:05:23] to go see them thinking oh we're gonna
[1:05:25] you you know something is going to
[1:05:27] happen here and and then an earthquake
[1:05:29] takes place and they oh I wonder if that
[1:05:31] has anything to do with it you know
[1:05:33] because they're looking for signs but
[1:05:36] they've missed the real sign which is
[1:05:38] Jesus
[1:05:39] Christ the whole purpose of this whole
[1:05:42] world and the existence of this whole
[1:05:44] world surrounds the Lord and Savior
[1:05:47] Jesus Christ and he says they seek a
[1:05:50] sign and there shall no sign be given it
[1:05:53] but the sign of Jonas the
[1:05:57] prophet for as Jonah was in the was in
[1:06:00] the uh for as Jonah was a sign unto the
[1:06:04] ninevites so shall also the son of man
[1:06:08] be to this
[1:06:10] generation the queen of the South shall
[1:06:13] rise up in the Judgment with the men of
[1:06:15] this generation and condemn them for she
[1:06:19] came from the uttermost parts of the
[1:06:22] earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and
[1:06:25] behold old a greater than Solomon is
[1:06:28] here praise God the men of Nineveh shall
[1:06:32] rise up in the Judgment with this
[1:06:36] generation and shall condemn it for they
[1:06:39] repented at the preaching of Jonah and
[1:06:42] behold a greater than Jonah is here I
[1:06:45] want to say that you know God has sent a
[1:06:48] second sign to to America okay in
[1:06:54] 2024 and you know passing over those
[1:06:58] ninas I mean are they significant yes
[1:07:02] they are significant in that we have a
[1:07:04] revelation of what took place in Nineveh
[1:07:08] okay God had to send a prophet into
[1:07:12] Nineveh okay and um you can go to the
[1:07:15] next
[1:07:17] slide and and I want you to
[1:07:22] notice go to the next slide there
[1:07:27] brother brandham here he says and then
[1:07:30] every sign has a voice behind it and the
[1:07:34] voice must be a scriptural voice the
[1:07:37] same as it must be a scriptural sign and
[1:07:41] then the sign is accompanied by a voice
[1:07:43] like Moses when he went down into Egypt
[1:07:46] the voice of the first sign the voice of
[1:07:50] the second sign and every great thing
[1:07:53] that happens with God that giv gives a
[1:07:55] sign there's a voice follows that sign
[1:07:59] like
[1:08:00] Jonah when he was delivered from the
[1:08:03] belly of the whale that was a sign then
[1:08:06] his voice was repent or in 40 days
[1:08:10] you'll perish so there's always the
[1:08:13] voice going with the sign amen praise
[1:08:17] God and you know it was interesting
[1:08:18] because I I came across this in Exodus
[1:08:22] 4:28 you know and 428 there's that 428
[1:08:26] again April the 28th you read Exodus 28
[1:08:30] and it shall come to pass if they will
[1:08:32] not believe thee neither hearken to the
[1:08:36] voice of the first
[1:08:38] sign that they will believe the
[1:08:41] voice of the of the latter sign in other
[1:08:44] words the second sign I believe God is
[1:08:47] sending a second
[1:08:49] sign to America and to the world through
[1:08:53] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:08:56] and that same message uh that that God
[1:09:00] gave to to Jonah was was
[1:09:03] Resurrection was that they were to
[1:09:06] repent that if there if listen if you're
[1:09:08] a son or a daughter of God out there you
[1:09:11] need to recognize the word of God for
[1:09:13] this day and for this hour and you need
[1:09:15] to repent and you need to turn to God
[1:09:18] you need to give your heart to Jesus
[1:09:20] Christ because he's calling you to place
[1:09:23] you and to use you in this day and in
[1:09:26] this hour you're actually assigned to
[1:09:30] this generation amen praise God and
[1:09:35] so
[1:09:37] here
[1:09:44] um
[1:09:51] sorry slide 16 if you could go to slide
[1:09:54] 16
[1:09:59] so here now remember he said that that
[1:10:01] uh that uh
[1:10:03] Nineveh they're going to raise
[1:10:06] up because they did repent so what he's
[1:10:10] saying is that this generation is not
[1:10:12] going to repent they're not able to
[1:10:15] repent this this America this America
[1:10:18] cannot repent as a
[1:10:20] nation it it won't
[1:10:24] happen okay it's going to it's going to
[1:10:27] go into complete and total um
[1:10:30] tribulation unfortunately but those that
[1:10:33] are that are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:10:36] they're going to be called out and
[1:10:37] they're going to come out all
[1:10:39] right now I want you to notice we're
[1:10:42] just going to talk about Nineveh for a
[1:10:44] few minutes okay because from there
[1:10:46] we're pulling out this is Bible study
[1:10:48] tonight so you're not getting like you
[1:10:50] know like that uh kind of fire and you
[1:10:53] know this is just kind of things that
[1:10:56] that you can draw from it and let the
[1:10:58] Holy Spirit give you what you have need
[1:11:01] of Amen but there was actually a solar
[1:11:03] eclipse that took place back in the day
[1:11:07] of Jonah it was in seven because they're
[1:11:11] able now to
[1:11:13] calculate with NASA and with the planets
[1:11:16] and the way that everything has you know
[1:11:20] um repetition they were able to actually
[1:11:22] go back and they found that there was
[1:11:25] actually um an eclipse that took place
[1:11:29] back at the same time and Jonah in the
[1:11:32] Bible one specific clue as to when he
[1:11:34] lived was during the reign of jeroboam
[1:11:37] thei which was somewhere between 786 and
[1:11:41] 746
[1:11:43] BCE okay before Christ if we take 2
[1:11:47] Kings 14:25 as evidence of the latest
[1:11:50] that he could have prophesied okay so
[1:11:53] you can go back now there's over 2700
[1:11:56] years ago that this Eclipse appeared
[1:12:00] over the Skies of ancient Assyria and it
[1:12:03] may have played a key role in the
[1:12:05] ancient city of nineveh's turn to God in
[1:12:08] Repentance okay so it's interesting if
[1:12:12] the historical and astronomical
[1:12:14] calculations are correct it means that
[1:12:17] the eclipse occurred when Syria was in a
[1:12:20] time of national upheaval and
[1:12:23] internal ter turmoil okay if you go back
[1:12:26] into the scriptures you'll see that they
[1:12:29] actually were okay nineveh's guilt was
[1:12:32] concerning Assyria oppression against
[1:12:35] the Jewish people taking them into
[1:12:38] captivity to Assyria and exiling and
[1:12:41] exiling them from their Homeland Israel
[1:12:45] okay and it's the same thing now they're
[1:12:47] they're they're trying to annihilate
[1:12:49] Israel okay the whole goal of Hamas and
[1:12:53] Hezbollah and Isis and all these you
[1:12:57] know the the the the the Iranian backed
[1:13:00] um groups they're all they only have one
[1:13:04] purpose they want to literally
[1:13:07] annihilate Israel okay just like Satan
[1:13:12] our enemy wants to annihilate us that's
[1:13:15] why you know the battles are Fierce
[1:13:17] sometimes you got to press through the
[1:13:19] battles you know but that's all part of
[1:13:22] of of the reproach for the word of God
[1:13:24] Amen praise God but here Nineveh was the
[1:13:29] capital of the city of Assyria okay in
[1:13:33] the modern days ancient Nineveh is on
[1:13:36] the Eastern Bank of the Tigris River
[1:13:38] close to the modern day of a city
[1:13:43] of uh mo mo mosul in Iraq
[1:13:50] okay so in in 721 BC Assyria swept down
[1:13:54] out of the North captured the Northern
[1:13:56] Kingdom of Israel and took 10 tribes
[1:13:59] into Exile and the Assyrians then
[1:14:01] occupied the towns and Villages of
[1:14:04] Northern Israel okay and so you know
[1:14:08] through this archaeolog archaeological
[1:14:11] scholar uh Mr wisman he was um you know
[1:14:15] part of the the British Museum and
[1:14:17] leading expert on a Syria culture
[1:14:20] documents his research that a solar
[1:14:22] eclipse did in fact occur over Nineveh
[1:14:26] the capital of the Assyrian cap uh
[1:14:31] Empire what's not mentioned in the Book
[1:14:33] of Jonah but is recorded in ass Syria's
[1:14:35] historical records and is known to nasau
[1:14:39] and modern astronomers is that before
[1:14:42] Jonah's visit a solar eclipse occurred
[1:14:47] okay the first Assyrian Eclipse was on
[1:14:49] June 24th 791 BC and it and it covered
[1:14:54] 74% of of the Sun the second solar
[1:14:56] eclipse was in June 763 BC and it
[1:15:01] covered
[1:15:02] 98.7 and that was the the time that
[1:15:04] they're kind of putting for Jonah that
[1:15:08] he actually went into
[1:15:10] Nineveh so significance is that you know
[1:15:15] because here we are and Nineveh is on
[1:15:18] the map 7 times and for us we know that
[1:15:21] it's it's the Revelation behind it okay
[1:15:24] and we we also know that the the the the
[1:15:26] sign of Jonah was the resurrection right
[1:15:29] and that Christ resurrected and now
[1:15:31] Christ is living in us and now we are
[1:15:34] the we are the the the resurrected bride
[1:15:37] of Jesus Christ restored back to the
[1:15:40] word of God Amen and now we are the sign
[1:15:45] that's on the earth and a lot of people
[1:15:47] will run into you at work they'll run
[1:15:49] into you you know when when you're out
[1:15:51] with family and friends and they don't
[1:15:54] really recognize that inside of you is
[1:15:57] is a revelation of exactly what God is
[1:16:01] doing in this hour and that you are
[1:16:04] actually that sign to this
[1:16:07] generation praise God hallelujah
[1:16:11] Jonah oh by the
[1:16:14] way another thing that I noticed that it
[1:16:17] passed over Jeffersonville at exactly 37
[1:16:22] which was the the the most part of the
[1:16:26] of the eclipse that they could see I got
[1:16:28] that right off of the timeline and I
[1:16:30] went in and I thought I wonder when it's
[1:16:32] if first of all I said I wonder if it's
[1:16:34] passing over Jeffersonville and then and
[1:16:36] then how much of it was passing over
[1:16:38] Jeffersonville and then the time caught
[1:16:40] my attention
[1:16:42] 307 you look at Amos 3:7 God does
[1:16:45] nothing unless he reveals it unto his
[1:16:47] servants the
[1:16:49] prophets Jonah 3:7 to
[1:16:53] 10 okay I'll read it here and he caused
[1:16:56] it to be proclaimed and published
[1:16:59] throughout Nineveh by the decree of the
[1:17:02] king and his Noble saying let neither
[1:17:04] man nor Beast herd nor flock taste
[1:17:08] anything do not let them eat or drink
[1:17:11] water but let men and beasts be covered
[1:17:14] with sackcloth and cry mightily to God
[1:17:18] yes let everyone turn from his evil way
[1:17:22] and from the violence that is in in his
[1:17:26] hands who can tell if God will turn and
[1:17:29] relent and turn away uh from his Fierce
[1:17:32] anger so that we may not
[1:17:35] perish you know America has no hope as a
[1:17:41] nation okay there's there's there's
[1:17:44] things that are happening this year that
[1:17:46] are very very significant all of these
[1:17:50] signs all the the you know the the the
[1:17:53] seven Salems seven years ago go and here
[1:17:55] we are now exactly seven years later God
[1:17:58] works in seven seven seven and here we
[1:18:00] are now and you know that if you go
[1:18:03] another seven years it puts us right
[1:18:06] basically at 2030 to 31 and and that's
[1:18:10] exactly 100 years or 2,000 years that
[1:18:15] the Lord was crucified and
[1:18:19] Rose and so now I'm not saying that you
[1:18:23] know everything's going to happen happen
[1:18:26] in 2030 or 31 I'm telling you it's
[1:18:28] happening right now we're in the midst
[1:18:33] of the Rapture you've already been
[1:18:35] raptured you've already been called out
[1:18:37] of your home you've already been been
[1:18:40] you already heard this message that that
[1:18:42] that Jonah was talking here and then God
[1:18:45] saw their works that they turned from
[1:18:48] their evil way and God relented from the
[1:18:51] disaster that he would bring upon them
[1:18:54] and he did not not do
[1:18:57] it aren't you glad that
[1:19:00] God you know came to you that he that he
[1:19:04] revealed his word to you it caused you
[1:19:06] to repent and turn from from your wicked
[1:19:09] ways and to turn from from you know your
[1:19:11] your understanding of man's teachings on
[1:19:14] the word of God and allowed you to to to
[1:19:16] wake up and recognize the hour that
[1:19:18] you're living in and and and that your
[1:19:21] life changed right from that moment your
[1:19:24] your future became clear you know you
[1:19:27] you knew now that all of a sudden that
[1:19:29] you know death had no more sting over
[1:19:31] you you were you were totally you know
[1:19:33] free of the of the sting of death you
[1:19:36] know as a son or daughter of God you
[1:19:38] should not fear death death is death is
[1:19:42] not something that we fear but then it's
[1:19:44] not something that we go running after
[1:19:46] either you know a lot of people they
[1:19:48] want to give up oh I'd rather be dead
[1:19:50] than deal with this you know or if this
[1:19:53] comes I'm just going to kill myself
[1:19:56] they haven't they haven't
[1:19:58] found the Shalom they haven't found the
[1:20:01] prince of peace they need to know that
[1:20:03] there's somebody that can take all your
[1:20:06] burdens and and he'll take those burdens
[1:20:08] and he will he will wipe your sins away
[1:20:11] to the point where you've never he
[1:20:14] doesn't even remember them
[1:20:16] anymore that's how powerful our God is
[1:20:20] amen and so knowing now that a total
[1:20:23] solar eclipse
[1:20:25] foreshadowed Jonah's preaching to the
[1:20:27] ancient nevas in 763 BC is it tempting
[1:20:32] to note the parallels of Nineveh and
[1:20:35] America today internal and external
[1:20:39] upheavals and civil unrest uh uh
[1:20:42] threatened them as well as the USA you
[1:20:46] know that if you go back and actually
[1:20:49] research you know um this path of the
[1:20:52] nevas okay where where it actually comes
[1:20:55] in and you know where it actually goes
[1:20:57] out and they've they've you know where
[1:20:59] 2017 came in and where where 20 um 24
[1:21:04] goes out there's all kinds of of of um
[1:21:09] Clues as to the potential for another
[1:21:12] civil war to break out in the United
[1:21:16] States of America right
[1:21:19] now okay there's there's turmoil within
[1:21:23] the United States of America I
[1:21:26] experienced it I went I went into the
[1:21:29] United States there uh uh you know last
[1:21:31] month sister Jennifer and I were in
[1:21:33] Florida and we met people and um you
[1:21:36] know people and family that we have
[1:21:39] there and they're very strong supporters
[1:21:42] of President the future um the former
[1:21:46] president Trump and they said clearly
[1:21:49] they told us they said he is the only
[1:21:52] hope for America
[1:21:55] he is the only hope for America if he
[1:21:58] does not get elected as the President of
[1:22:02] the United States in November of
[1:22:04] 2024 the whole United States is going to
[1:22:08] go into Civil War this is what this
[1:22:11] individual was telling me he says I know
[1:22:14] people that are buying arms that are
[1:22:16] putting away ammunitions that are
[1:22:19] preparing for all kinds of of uh uh
[1:22:22] things to rise up uh you know if this
[1:22:25] doesn't go their way and a lot of
[1:22:28] military people okay remember military
[1:22:32] people are
[1:22:35] patriots that's why they were willing to
[1:22:37] give their lives for their country okay
[1:22:41] so you got to understand the the the
[1:22:42] mentality and the thinking behind you
[1:22:45] know these these people okay especially
[1:22:48] those that are in the military and
[1:22:50] you've got you know these people have
[1:22:52] guns and and ammunition and all kinds
[1:22:54] and they're ready just like you know we
[1:22:56] saw a little you know what what happened
[1:22:59] there in the Insurrection there when
[1:23:01] they went and and they stormed you know
[1:23:04] the Senate right that was just you know
[1:23:07] a a small sign of potentially what could
[1:23:11] happen if Trump doesn't get elected okay
[1:23:16] I'm just saying
[1:23:17] that we've already voted for for our
[1:23:20] president it's the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:23:24] amen man aren't you glad let the
[1:23:26] musicians come
[1:23:28] up we don't we don't we don't worry
[1:23:32] about the elections we're not concerned
[1:23:35] about you know um all the details of it
[1:23:39] and getting involved and getting into
[1:23:42] all kinds of you know debates over it
[1:23:44] and everything else we know exactly
[1:23:47] what's going to happen all right and so
[1:23:51] the one thing that you know as we close
[1:23:53] here the one thing that we need to be
[1:23:56] aware of is brother brandham said watch
[1:23:59] Israel that is a super sign to us we
[1:24:04] should be recognizing and knowing that
[1:24:07] that whatever they're trying to do
[1:24:09] against Israel in dividing the land
[1:24:13] unfortunately God says no it's not going
[1:24:18] to happen Okay in Joel chapter 3 veres 1
[1:24:23] to3 prophecies prophesies to us when and
[1:24:26] how the tribulation period will begin it
[1:24:29] deals with God's covenant he made with
[1:24:32] his people the children of Israel the
[1:24:35] god of Israel tells us clearly and
[1:24:37] directly why he judges the nations in
[1:24:41] Joel 3 1-2 for behold in those days and
[1:24:46] at the end time when I bring back the
[1:24:48] captives of Judah and Jerusalem I will
[1:24:52] also gather all Nations and bring them
[1:24:56] down to the valley of Jehoshaphat and I
[1:24:59] will enter into judgment with them there
[1:25:03] it's talking about you know when they
[1:25:04] surround Israel and when they come
[1:25:06] against Israel and when the Nations all
[1:25:09] decide that they're going to come
[1:25:10] against Israel guess who they're going
[1:25:12] to be meeting the same just like they
[1:25:15] did when they when they tried to
[1:25:16] overcome them in
[1:25:17] 1967 just like they did when they tried
[1:25:20] to overcome in
[1:25:21] 1948 Israel prevailed because of a
[1:25:25] supernatural intervention from
[1:25:28] God the bride of Christ the True Church
[1:25:31] of God will prevail and overcome because
[1:25:35] Christ is with
[1:25:37] her all right all the denominations all
[1:25:40] the World Council of churches they can
[1:25:42] come together and they can declare that
[1:25:44] they have a trinity and that they have
[1:25:47] their own doctrines and that they will
[1:25:49] govern and rule the church in their own
[1:25:51] way but God says my church
[1:25:54] will hear my voice and they will
[1:25:57] recognize my word and they will stand on
[1:26:00] my word and because they stand for me I
[1:26:03] will stand for
[1:26:05] them and Israel on account of my people
[1:26:09] my Heritage Israel whom they have
[1:26:12] scattered among the Nations they have
[1:26:14] also divided up my land behold I will
[1:26:20] make Jerusalem a cup of drunkenness to
[1:26:23] all the surrounding people when they lay
[1:26:26] Siege against Judah and Jerusalem and it
[1:26:30] shall happen in that day that I will
[1:26:32] make Jerusalem a very heavy stone for
[1:26:36] all people oh what a revelation praise
[1:26:39] God all who would heave it away will
[1:26:43] surely be cut in pieces though all
[1:26:46] nations of the Earth are gathered
[1:26:48] against it Zechariah
[1:26:50] 12 the Lord is warning very clearly and
[1:26:54] very directly here not to divide
[1:26:58] Jerusalem not to try and and and break
[1:27:02] up or destroy my people you can't do it
[1:27:07] or judgment is going to
[1:27:10] result amen praise
