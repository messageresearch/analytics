[23:44] [Music]
[23:45] okay all right well praise God we're
[23:49] just waiting on um a tally of all our
[23:52] numbers it'll take about 5 minutes or so
[23:56] so Nathaniel um we could either have
[23:59] some music or we could have maybe a
[24:03] testimony or two real quick somebody
[24:05] wants to share you know something that
[24:07] happened during the
[24:10] Watermelons well you know what actually
[24:12] why don't we have our pastor come up and
[24:15] and say
[24:16] hello last
[24:18] sign that's a good
[24:21] idea always putting me on a hot seat
[24:25] right I'll just saying hello that's all
[24:29] you can say hello you can you can
[24:37] preach we had a wonderful day at church
[24:40] we spoke on S um you know put us on fire
[24:45] send us on fire lord asking the Lord to
[24:48] set our hearts on fire and Inspire us to
[24:50] do his work but was good to come here
[24:54] and to see all of you in the presence of
[24:57] the Lord and enjoying another's presence
[24:59] that's what this is all about uh and to
[25:02] before I got here I heard the good word
[25:05] that the message and the services were
[25:10] pretty good and right to the point and
[25:13] just reached out to your hearts and I'm
[25:16] happy about that I'm glad all of you
[25:18] came from
[25:20] everywhere to get together like this and
[25:24] to be able to merge your hearts your
[25:27] minds your thoughts but we live in a day
[25:30] actually when um youth are not serious
[25:34] about anything really everything is just
[25:36] fun and games and jokes and uh that sort
[25:39] of thing and there's a place for that
[25:42] but when it comes to your
[25:44] faith that needs to be something dead
[25:48] serious dead
[25:50] Earnest that is not something to quibble
[25:52] about that's something you must be
[25:54] certain of God certain of your own
[25:57] experience erience not your parents own
[26:00] but your own experience and allow the
[26:04] fire of God to work within you until it
[26:07] consumes you and not much of self is
[26:10] left now it's okay I'm going into
[26:12] preaching and I don't want to preach but
[26:15] it's good to be here good to see your
[26:16] smiling faces and all those watermelons
[26:19] so really
[26:21] juicy I know I can get a piece at any
[26:24] time but at the same time it was good to
[26:26] see you slobbering over
[26:30] some people ferocious
[26:35] Lambs eating up the Watermelons and
[26:39] having it just uh soak up that's the way
[26:41] we ought to be eating the word of God
[26:43] until sing all over it oh my like
[26:46] brother gr said you know you just eat it
[26:48] like if it's honey until it's sticking
[26:50] on your face your all over your skin and
[26:54] you're licking your fingers and
[26:55] everything else taste and see the Lord
[26:57] is so God and blessed are they that put
[27:00] their trust in him you know I know this
[27:03] some
[27:04] trip and being an old person saying it
[27:07] but let me tell you if you set the
[27:10] trajectory of your life or the where
[27:13] it's headed now you wouldn't have to
[27:16] worry too much later you set it now set
[27:20] your foundations right now put in proper
[27:23] spiritual foundations and even if
[27:25] problems come up the road you'll find
[27:28] that God will be able to write your ship
[27:31] quite easily because he has control over
[27:34] a part or all of your life so I
[27:37] encourage you as they're counting these
[27:40] points and coming up with who's the
[27:42] winner right here today uh some people
