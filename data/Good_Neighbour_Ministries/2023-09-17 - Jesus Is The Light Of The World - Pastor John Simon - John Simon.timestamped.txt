[41:31] the Lord bless you please be seated
[41:35] we're so happy to be here today by the
[41:37] grace of God good to see you God bless
[41:40] you
[41:41] uh brother Mike sister Elaine are out of
[41:45] town
[41:47] brother Danny is away at this time
[41:51] but I'll be thankful to God that we can
[41:54] be here by the grace of God Amen brother
[41:57] Tim sister Deborah they're not here God
[42:00] bless them all I'm happy to be here and
[42:03] I'm happy to be back from our trip to
[42:05] Europe let me thank God for keeping us
[42:08] safe
[42:11] so we are here by the grace of God and I
[42:14] want you to know I'm not here to do the
[42:16] work of an evangelist but I'm here to do
[42:19] the work of a pastor
[42:23] a Shepherd which is to feed lead guide
[42:26] protect
[42:27] and preserve the Sheep of God the flock
[42:32] of God that he has put here with Among
[42:35] Us Praise the Lord so we give him glory
[42:38] and praise for that may the Lord bless
[42:40] you I'll just take my time and go into
[42:43] the word and you will see whether or not
[42:46] you receive something from it
[42:49] and I hear the preach some generalized
[42:52] sermon
[42:53] but we just try to yield ourselves so
[42:57] that the Holy Spirit can minister to
[43:00] each individual their need
[43:04] is that right there's no cookie cutter
[43:07] fate here
[43:09] where it is applies to everybody no God
[43:14] knows you God knows every one of us and
[43:19] so like on the day of Pentecost when he
[43:22] spoke
[43:24] everybody heard
[43:26] it's the same thing
[43:29] the mystery of preaching is that when
[43:32] the word is preached
[43:34] on the the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[43:38] then it goes to the congregation as a
[43:42] whole but to the every single
[43:46] individual that is in that congregation
[43:50] receives something for themselves
[43:55] it is my prayer today that each one of
[43:59] us will receive something from the Lord
[44:02] now these few thoughts were received
[44:05] while I was on the ship and I just kind
[44:10] of wrote them down so if I appeared to
[44:13] be
[44:14] um going back and forth I'm I'm not
[44:16] bringing a lecture or or something of
[44:19] that sort so that you look for
[44:23] um you know order and this and that God
[44:25] has his own order so we will just bring
[44:28] the word and may God bless each one of
[44:31] you today we will want to look into
[44:33] Genesis chapter 1.
[44:39] reading from verses 3 to 5.
[44:52] Genesis 1 3-5
[44:55] it's on the board so you may read it
[44:58] let's read together
[45:01] and God said let there
[45:05] be light
[45:06] and there was light
[45:09] and God saw the light that it was good
[45:13] and God divided the light from the
[45:17] darkness
[45:18] and God called the light day and the
[45:22] Darkness he called night and the evening
[45:26] and the morning were the first
[45:29] day now let's go to verse 14 and 18.
[45:37] and God said let there be lights in the
[45:41] firmament of the heaven
[45:44] to divide the day from the night
[45:47] and let them be for signs
[45:51] for seasons for days
[45:55] and years amen let us pray
[46:00] our gracious heavenly father as I stand
[46:03] here father in the Simplicity of
[46:07] ministering your word
[46:09] I am helpless
[46:12] I have nothing of human knowledge that I
[46:16] can add to the people that they can't go
[46:18] pick up in some books somewhere or some
[46:21] computer but father we would ask that
[46:24] the holy spirit will come to us
[46:27] supernaturally and speak to your people
[46:30] and bless your people and lift us up in
[46:33] another dimension where we can recognize
[46:37] that you are the same yesterday today
[46:39] and forever to be to thee be all the
[46:43] glory and the praise as we honor and
[46:47] uplift you in the name of Jesus Christ
[46:49] Our Lord amen and amen God bless you
[46:54] please be seated
[46:59] uh what I'm
[47:01] bringing to you here today is just to
[47:04] show you
[47:05] that um
[47:08] that God had here is expressing to us
[47:12] two creations
[47:15] one if you will notice in verses 1 uh to
[47:19] one three to five
[47:21] that God said let there be light
[47:25] and there was light
[47:27] later on he says Let There be lights in
[47:31] the firmament
[47:32] uh uh the moon the Sun the stars and so
[47:37] on let and let them be for this purpose
[47:39] you will know in other words you're
[47:42] breaking into time you'll need them to
[47:45] be able to measure days and seasons and
[47:47] times and so on
[47:49] so the first creation when he said let
[47:53] there be light that was not natural
[47:54] light
[47:56] or else you wouldn't have to go and
[47:58] create another life
[48:00] uh for the world so the first one was
[48:04] Supernatural like
[48:06] that first one was the logos
[48:10] you see that was the logos so then we
[48:14] understand from this friends
[48:16] that God had a
[48:19] an infinite if you want to say creation
[48:23] and he had a a finite one one that was
[48:28] eternal and one that was natural and
[48:34] bounded by time
[48:36] and that one will come to an end
[48:41] now we certainly know when God said let
[48:45] there be light and there was light what
[48:48] was that you must understand from The
[48:51] Book of Revelation but there was war in
[48:54] heaven
[48:56] Michael and his angels had to fight
[48:59] against the devil Lucifer and his angels
[49:03] and say there was a supernatural war
[49:05] going on in the heavens
[49:07] we understand from the scriptures that
[49:10] uh the devil was defeated
[49:13] and he still is defeated
[49:16] I want you to know the Devil is a
[49:18] defeated foe
[49:19] regardless of what trials he brings to
[49:22] you our mind your attention your family
[49:25] or wherever you are he is defeated
[49:29] and he is your football
[49:33] God says you are to make him your
[49:35] football in other words in plain kick
[49:38] him out
[49:39] you are supposed to kick him out of
[49:42] bounds and let the Holy Spirit have his
[49:45] way in your life
[49:47] don't invite him don't encourage him
[49:49] don't sympathize with him poor devil you
[49:53] know but uh you just kick him out of
[49:56] your life
[49:57] don't let him stay or have any place or
[50:01] hold upon your life
[50:04] now when God said let there be light
[50:07] what really that was was uh the logos
[50:12] and the armies of light
[50:15] will release against the Clouds Of
[50:19] Darkness of demons and Devils that were
[50:23] in the world for when they were defeated
[50:25] in the war in the heavens they came down
[50:28] to earth
[50:30] they came right down to earth we know
[50:33] that now we won't go into that because
[50:36] then you'll talk about Dr pember's
[50:38] Earth's earliest ages and how the devil
[50:41] who came down and made his headquarters
[50:45] and and create Havoc again and and then
[50:49] God had to now bring him to a place
[50:53] where he's dominated and replaced him
[50:56] and let man now begin to control and
[51:01] have dominion over the Earth and so he's
[51:04] still jealous
[51:06] to this day that mankind has been given
[51:09] the Dominion which he once had over the
[51:14] entire Earth and he's still considered
[51:17] himself as if he is the God of this
[51:20] world and he's projecting that but he is
[51:23] not anymore because you and I as Jesus
[51:27] said you are Gods you were the ones that
[51:30] are here to dominate over these Devils
[51:33] demons sickness troubled death trial
[51:36] whatever it is you are here for that
[51:38] purpose okay so we understand that God
[51:42] said let there be light so that the
[51:44] light could do what scatter the darkness
[51:48] when the light comes the darkness flees
[51:51] away
[51:52] it cannot stand in the presence of God
[51:55] amen oh praise God I understand your
[51:58] word and I watched it online who had
[52:01] wonderful Services how many of you can
[52:03] say Amen to that
[52:05] I understand in the middle of all this
[52:08] the Lights Went Out
[52:10] Darkness was here amen praise God but
[52:15] thanks be to God God used uh brother
[52:18] Alvin who happened to have two trucks
[52:21] that happen to be outside and and they
[52:24] had generators for his work that he does
[52:26] it just so happens but anyway they had
[52:29] generators so all he did was hook up
[52:31] whatever however he doesn't he's
[52:33] electrician and he knows that so he
[52:35] hooked it up and some lights came on by
[52:38] the grace of God and we all praise God
[52:42] even for a little light
[52:44] is that right we praise God for a very
[52:47] little light oh my goodness reflecting
[52:51] of the darkness that we arrince people
[52:54] were in spiritually waiting for the True
[52:57] Light wedding for the light of the Holy
[53:01] Spirit on the word
[53:03] what we have had down through these ages
[53:06] has been man-made wisdom and knowledge
[53:10] their accumulation of theological
[53:13] knowledge over seven Church ages and
[53:16] they present that inter and teach that
[53:18] in all the seminaries and uh Bible
[53:21] schools I'm not against knowledge I'm
[53:23] not against that type of thing I was in
[53:25] one of those schools I came out of one
[53:28] of those schools because the questions
[53:30] are asking and stuff like that but
[53:32] anyway but just so that you know for her
[53:36] fat brothers and sisters that uh this
[53:39] knowledge the devil is using it it was
[53:41] accumulated over so many centuries and
[53:46] they are going to that depository of
[53:48] knowledge and bringing back that to you
[53:52] and calling that revelation
[53:55] but that is not revelation
[53:58] Revelation is Supernatural deposit that
[54:02] God will deposit in the heart of the
[54:05] believer
[54:06] when they know nothing see God doesn't
[54:09] need your knowledge
[54:11] God doesn't need your wisdom
[54:13] God doesn't need anything from you all
[54:17] it needs is a humble heart
[54:19] all he needs is a surrendered life
[54:22] that he can flow through your life and
[54:25] be a blessing to the world Amen that's
[54:28] all God needs amen because his knowledge
[54:31] is infinite
[54:32] and if you have access to that knowledge
[54:36] then uh you just do all the things that
[54:41] are necessary to survive in this world
[54:43] you need to learn you need to go to
[54:47] school you need to have education but
[54:49] not for him
[54:50] if you look in the Bible just quickly
[54:52] most of those prophets were not educated
[54:55] man some of them couldn't even write
[54:57] their names and yet they would stand up
[54:59] and say oh I looked and I see like
[55:03] chariots moving swifter than horses and
[55:07] they have some big eyes a shining bright
[55:10] they were seeing cars
[55:13] but they weren't educated they could
[55:15] only speak from the what they knew
[55:18] naturally but it was God conveying to
[55:21] them like the Bible says holy man of God
[55:24] wrote and spoke as they were inspired by
[55:27] the Holy Ghost
[55:29] amen so they were they were doing it by
[55:32] inspiration if they gave it by
[55:35] inspiration you must receive it by
[55:37] inspiration
[55:39] you're not just here to sit in church
[55:41] you're not here to warm up you or a
[55:44] puppet
[55:45] but you are here to come in the presence
[55:47] of almighty God that you might receive
[55:50] something from his divine presence
[55:52] the Holy Spirit himself to speak to you
[55:55] out of this word of God Amen
[55:59] Hallelujah glory be to God Amen yes sir
[56:02] you see just like God had to create
[56:06] first when God created man you'll see
[56:09] the same principle in Genesis first God
[56:13] created man
[56:15] when you go back in chapter 3 you see
[56:18] like he's creating man again
[56:20] and then they say the Bible is
[56:22] contradictory they don't understand
[56:23] first he created a spirit man
[56:28] amen a man that was in His image and
[56:32] he's a spirit so it was a spirit man but
[56:35] later on the Bible says but there was no
[56:38] man to till the soil
[56:40] and to take care the garden see now he
[56:44] had to put that Spirit man into a flesh
[56:49] man into flesh that the man might be
[56:52] able to till the soil and that he might
[56:54] be able to do the garden and to do those
[56:56] things you see now I'm saying that it's
[56:59] the same principle God first had to have
[57:01] Supernatural light the logos
[57:04] and then he created the Moon Sun and the
[57:08] stars to be natural light for natural
[57:12] man to be able to see and go about the
[57:15] business of what they have to do amen
[57:18] hallelujah praise God now let's go to
[57:23] Psalm 27 1 if we can have that up on the
[57:27] board you don't mind my taking that time
[57:29] okay
[57:31] praise the Lord psalms 27 1. let's read
[57:35] that together everybody
[57:37] you have a voice right oh so let's all
[57:40] read it together using our voices the
[57:44] Lord
[57:45] is my light
[57:47] and my salvation
[57:50] Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the
[57:54] strength of my life of whom shall I be
[57:57] afraid praise God you see God is your
[58:02] light
[58:03] that Supernatural light was the logos
[58:07] and that light is your life or your
[58:10] salvation the same light because God
[58:15] first has to reveal his word to you
[58:18] reveal himself through the word to you
[58:21] before you can be born again
[58:26] and
[58:27] to be born again
[58:30] means you were born before
[58:33] so how you born again where do you got
[58:36] that from you think it's talking that
[58:37] you were born from your mother you had a
[58:39] natural birth
[58:40] and therefore you can be born again now
[58:42] spiritually no
[58:44] you are born again from the very womb or
[58:48] mind of God
[58:50] from Beyond the foundations of the world
[58:53] and then being born from the mind of God
[58:57] from Beyond the foundations of the world
[59:00] we got lost when we came down or were
[59:05] sent down here to dwell in this
[59:09] atmosphere of Earth
[59:11] and so God had to find how to have a way
[59:15] to bring his children back to himself
[59:20] a real True Believer
[59:23] is not a creature of time
[59:27] they are they come from eternity
[59:30] and they're going back to Eternity
[59:34] uh you must recognize horses bring Fort
[59:37] horses right
[59:39] yeah goats bring forth goats pigs pigs
[59:41] Lambs sheep lambs and and God Burns
[59:45] forth
[59:46] is that right Paul said you are the
[59:50] offsprings of the Almighty
[59:53] if you are the offsprings of the
[59:55] almighty and he is eternal then and you
[1:00:00] I'm talking about your soul now is has
[1:00:04] to be eternal
[1:00:05] it has to be if you are a son or a
[1:00:08] daughter of God
[1:00:09] then you have to be eternal
[1:00:12] then there was no time when you were not
[1:00:16] and there will be no time when you will
[1:00:19] not be
[1:00:21] because you were always in him
[1:00:25] and you are with him
[1:00:27] from before the foundations
[1:00:30] [Applause]
[1:00:31] of the world
[1:00:33] that is why God asked job he says job
[1:00:36] you don't understand where were you when
[1:00:39] the morning star sang together
[1:00:41] and the sons of God were shouting for
[1:00:45] Joy where were you
[1:00:46] God we're always there
[1:00:49] so so I'm cutting all of this I'm
[1:00:51] cutting off pieces here to come to a
[1:00:54] conclusion here therefore you are not
[1:00:57] born again on a certain day
[1:01:00] or a certain year
[1:01:03] or a certain time correct praise the
[1:01:06] Lord you come to an epiphany
[1:01:10] you come to a recognition
[1:01:13] of who you really are
[1:01:16] that you are not the son of a Florence
[1:01:20] Simon you're not the son of Andrew Simon
[1:01:26] but your real father
[1:01:29] is the father of Lights
[1:01:32] you come from God you're going back to
[1:01:35] God
[1:01:36] because you come from him you're going
[1:01:38] back to him this is why the scriptures
[1:01:40] write so often saying only those whose
[1:01:44] names are written in the Book of Life
[1:01:46] the book the Lamb's Book of Life are the
[1:01:50] only ones that really going to be safe
[1:01:52] that's not me saying that the Bible is
[1:01:55] telling you that
[1:01:56] that your names were already there in
[1:02:00] his book
[1:02:01] and we are not here questioning anymore
[1:02:04] is my name written there no you
[1:02:08] recognize and that's why the Seven Seals
[1:02:10] were given to open up and reveal to us
[1:02:14] and make you certain of God that your
[1:02:18] name is in his book
[1:02:20] amen and God reveals it to you I am his
[1:02:24] child I am his child to be born again or
[1:02:28] to come to a new birth is to recognize
[1:02:31] who you really are
[1:02:33] and the Holy Spirit how do you do that
[1:02:36] by the spirit the spirit of God drazing
[1:02:39] away the darkness brought to you by
[1:02:42] theology by tradition by false religion
[1:02:46] by false Faith all these things driving
[1:02:48] away the fuckiness and the Darkness and
[1:02:51] the questionings or wondering uh how did
[1:02:55] this happen how did that happen where
[1:02:56] did I come from where am I going uh all
[1:02:59] these questions you're doubting you you
[1:03:01] try this church you run to the other
[1:03:03] Church run over here run over there it's
[1:03:05] the your soul inside searching to find
[1:03:09] oh praise God you're searching to find
[1:03:12] your father your children to find the
[1:03:14] truth of God's word no no man can give
[1:03:17] that to you only the Holy Spirit can
[1:03:20] give that to you
[1:03:21] [Applause]
[1:03:23] praise the Lord the spirit of God make
[1:03:26] causing you to recognize who you really
[1:03:30] are amen the Lord is my light and my
[1:03:34] salvation
[1:03:35] Whom Shall I Fear amen praise God
[1:03:39] hallelujah you understand that this love
[1:03:42] goes first appeared as Melchizedek in
[1:03:45] the form of a man which was
[1:03:47] foreshadowing that one day it will
[1:03:50] become a man or be in a man and we know
[1:03:54] that man we recognize his name is Jesus
[1:03:58] Christ
[1:04:00] John chapter 1 let's read that again one
[1:04:04] to ten such just so you think I'm not
[1:04:06] just I'm just talking my own feelings
[1:04:10] it's in your book amen John chapter 1
[1:04:14] reading from verse 1 to 10. in the
[1:04:18] beginning
[1:04:19] was the word
[1:04:22] and the Word was with God
[1:04:25] see the word was with God but then God
[1:04:28] said
[1:04:29] let there be light
[1:04:31] and that word went out
[1:04:34] and it went out in what form it became
[1:04:37] light
[1:04:38] it became light today we know it as
[1:04:40] gospel like the revelation of the word
[1:04:43] that goes out to lighten what
[1:04:46] Jesus said it to lighten the life of
[1:04:49] every man and woman that is in this
[1:04:51] world if they want it they can receive
[1:04:54] that light it's the shine into their
[1:04:57] hearts in all the dark places of your
[1:04:59] heart all the places amen praise the
[1:05:02] Lord and the Word was with God and the
[1:05:05] Word was God
[1:05:07] the same was in the beginning with God
[1:05:11] all things were made by him without him
[1:05:13] was not anything made that was made
[1:05:17] in him was life
[1:05:20] and the life was what
[1:05:23] the light of man praise the God
[1:05:27] hallelujah light for your soul not not
[1:05:30] sunlight
[1:05:32] but s-o-n

[1:05:45] Heavenly Sunshine Heavenly Sunshine
[1:05:49] Hallelujah
[1:05:51] Jesus is mine that's what it is all
[1:05:55] about God's light shining into the dark
[1:05:58] places of our hearts so God came in the
[1:06:03] form of a man Jesus Christ who rose up
[1:06:06] and said John 8 12
[1:06:09] I am the light of the world
[1:06:13] praise God he's not saying that he's the
[1:06:16] son
[1:06:17] but the light of the entire universe the
[1:06:19] light of the spirit Realm
[1:06:21] praise God hallelujah so we understand
[1:06:25] that that is what it is and he sheds
[1:06:29] light not on the plants outside and the
[1:06:32] animals on the Earth but upon those who
[1:06:35] are willing to receive him
[1:06:38] he sheds light into their soul praise
[1:06:42] God hallelujah glory to God Amen that
[1:06:46] light that appeared
[1:06:49] in Genesis 1
[1:06:51] later we understand was the same Pillar
[1:06:55] of Fire
[1:06:57] that came above Israel
[1:06:59] and gave them light by night and A Cloud
[1:07:03] by day
[1:07:05] over them praise the name of the Lord I
[1:07:07] want you to know that that if he was
[1:07:09] here he would say I am that Pillar of
[1:07:13] Fire

[1:07:20] were shining in the temple praise the
[1:07:23] name of the Lord Jesus I am the Seven
[1:07:25] Stars of Revelation 1. that shine out

[1:07:32] what it is you had said uh would you
[1:07:35] place that back up brother the design up
[1:07:38] there
[1:07:43] seven Church ages
[1:07:45] starting from the bottom with the Jesus
[1:07:48] Christ himself
[1:07:50] and Then followed by Paul
[1:07:53] followed by Martin Luther Columbus
[1:07:55] Luther
[1:07:57] We Believe Wesley and we believe in this
[1:08:00] age followed by the 20th century prophet
[1:08:04] brother William Marion brabham
[1:08:08] and that God just used him as a vessel
[1:08:11] we are not preaching and teaching you
[1:08:13] about the man we're just telling you
[1:08:15] what the Holy Spirit did through a man
[1:08:18] and use them for the glory of God and he
[1:08:21] said it long after I'm gone
[1:08:24] they're going to say all kinds of things
[1:08:26] but they're going to recognize
[1:08:28] that God had a prophet walk amongst them
[1:08:31] the Jews received their prophets the
[1:08:34] Gentiles had none
[1:08:37] and so God had to send a 20th century
[1:08:41] Prophet according to Malachi 4 5 behold
[1:08:45] I'll send unto you Elijah the prophet
[1:08:47] who will turn the hearts of the children
[1:08:50] back to the fathers amen and praise God
[1:08:54] turn us back to the original faith that
[1:08:57] was there in the Bible praise the name
[1:09:00] of the Lord so we thank God for that
[1:09:03] Glory To His Marvelous name so we find
[1:09:06] out today what's happening people are
[1:09:08] following a lot of glares
[1:09:11] they're following anything that looks
[1:09:13] shiny
[1:09:15] it it looks like the real thing and it's
[1:09:19] not for all I know you can even have
[1:09:22] false coins in your pocket false money
[1:09:24] uh counterfeit stuff that's printed up
[1:09:27] that the devil has out there and you
[1:09:29] don't recognize it amen but God has the
[1:09:33] real true light he said I am the True
[1:09:36] Light
[1:09:37] he that followeth me shall not walk in
[1:09:39] darkness but he shall have the light of
[1:09:42] life
[1:09:43] his light will lead your life and lead
[1:09:47] you through all the darkness that is in
[1:09:49] this present world that we are living in
[1:09:53] praise the name of the Lord may God help
[1:09:55] every one of us as we walk with him
[1:09:58] praise God and follow him
[1:10:02] who do you think that great star you
[1:10:05] know scientists have said the Christmas
[1:10:07] star
[1:10:09] they realize that there's three stars
[1:10:14] came together to make one great big star
[1:10:17] that the Wise Men followed
[1:10:21] and we understand that that star was
[1:10:25] shining leading the wise man
[1:10:28] to
[1:10:29] Christ
[1:10:31] that was in the manger
[1:10:33] isn't that funny how God brings his word
[1:10:36] the god of Heaven comes down
[1:10:38] condescending a human body
[1:10:40] and he's not born in a palace
[1:10:43] he doesn't go to kahaifa's the high
[1:10:45] priest to recognize him
[1:10:47] he doesn't go to the king and say move
[1:10:50] out to your Palace I'm greater than you
[1:10:51] I'll take you no
[1:10:53] he comes born in a manger
[1:10:56] God hides in simplicity
[1:11:00] God hides himself in Simplicity and he
[1:11:03] reveals himself also in simplicity so
[1:11:06] when you're looking for these high and
[1:11:08] mighty things or Dr so-and-so said
[1:11:11] listen
[1:11:12] um your great Theologian spoke to me you
[1:11:15] know I studied hermeneutics and
[1:11:17] apologetics and you know eschatology and
[1:11:20] pedagogy and so on so on like that oh it
[1:11:24] impresses people or that guy knows
[1:11:26] something
[1:11:27] he really knows you know that man's a
[1:11:30] doctor that man is a dumb dog
[1:11:34] do you know that he has a bad attitude
[1:11:38] he has all kinds of these so-called
[1:11:42] degrees and he doesn't recognize that
[1:11:45] he's missing the supernatural element
[1:11:48] the supernatural element any woman knows
[1:11:51] she bakes a cake and she leaves out
[1:11:55] one part you leave out the sugar you
[1:11:58] lose out leave out the yeast or whatever
[1:12:00] thing all you got is a big lump of dough
[1:12:04] and a big heavy lump
[1:12:09] I'm sorry to be talking like this you
[1:12:11] know but that's that's the way I speak
[1:12:13] um
[1:12:14] because you missed
[1:12:16] there's a missing ingredient
[1:12:19] and that's what's happened in the world
[1:12:21] today and all the churches around us I'm
[1:12:23] not saying we're the only ones right
[1:12:25] because God is teaching men and women
[1:12:28] around the world wherever they are but
[1:12:30] the fact is that element is missing they
[1:12:34] they're caught up with systems of
[1:12:36] learning of religious learning religious
[1:12:38] education they're caught up with
[1:12:40] theology they're caught up with uh
[1:12:43] denominationalism they caught up with
[1:12:45] Traditions they caught it with rituals
[1:12:47] they caught up with all kinds of things
[1:12:50] except coming back to the original word
[1:12:53] of God
[1:12:55] and let not the Theologian that not me
[1:12:58] or anybody but let God be his own
[1:13:01] interpreter
[1:13:02] and he will make it plain God will
[1:13:05] declare himself by the opening of the
[1:13:08] word and you recognize that it's him
[1:13:10] taking the word and making you know who
[1:13:12] he is
[1:13:13] God being his own interpreter amen glory
[1:13:19] to God so we know then
[1:13:22] of on the day of Pentecost what really
[1:13:25] happened is not so much the tongues
[1:13:28] but the fact is that the Holy Spirit
[1:13:30] came down upon them and revealed to them
[1:13:33] who they really are
[1:13:36] reveal to them who their father is
[1:13:40] and they recognize it and in their
[1:13:43] excitement they began to speak and and
[1:13:46] talking and tongue slot out of them I
[1:13:49] speak in tongues but privately you know
[1:13:51] I don't go you don't have to go around
[1:13:54] and get out there speaking in tongues
[1:13:56] for people to teach is spiritual
[1:14:01] spirit of God will flow through you and
[1:14:03] be a blessing to the world and that's
[1:14:05] what we are here to to do and that's
[1:14:08] where what you are here to be and let us
[1:14:11] all shine our lights and brighten our
[1:14:13] little corner wherever God places us
[1:14:17] God bless you in a position light up
[1:14:19] that corner for his glory that doesn't
[1:14:22] mean going around with a big Bible
[1:14:23] saying I am a Christian you know and you
[1:14:26] are not you know no no no you don't just
[1:14:29] live the life God wants you to live
[1:14:32] amen just be full of these virtues full
[1:14:35] of the love of God brotherliness
[1:14:37] kindliness the grace of God that will
[1:14:40] shine out of your life because that's
[1:14:43] him in you shining out through you you
[1:14:48] are just the Veil praise the Lord and
[1:14:51] praise God a lot of these things I'm
[1:14:53] saying is not even what I notes I have
[1:14:55] here because the fact is we are the
[1:14:59] there's so much I can say we are the
[1:15:01] badger skins the Bible speaks of in the
[1:15:03] temple
[1:15:05] because you are not the Temple of the
[1:15:08] Living God
[1:15:09] Lives in You by faith
[1:15:11] and the veil hides the the light from
[1:15:16] the candlesticks and the pillar of fire
[1:15:18] that was back of that veil was hidden
[1:15:21] behind the veil
[1:15:23] and so uh we are the badger skins
[1:15:27] so your skin color don't matter to God
[1:15:30] whether it's a sheepskin gold skin
[1:15:33] whether it's a whatever skin black
[1:15:36] yellow brown white skin it was skins
[1:15:39] that made up that Veil that was six
[1:15:42] inches thick and no light can go through
[1:15:45] it until God Jesus was crucified on
[1:15:50] Calvary amen which was a symbol that now
[1:15:54] the veil was rent opened up and now we
[1:15:58] are able to look in and behold the glory
[1:16:01] of God Amen the great Shining Light of
[1:16:05] the spirit of almighty God was able to
[1:16:07] make itself known to the world Amen
[1:16:10] praise God and he still lives do you
[1:16:13] believe it
[1:16:14] he still is making himself known to the
[1:16:18] world in this day that we are living in
[1:16:22] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[1:16:24] praise God God bless you sons of Light
[1:16:27] Daughters of light children of light
[1:16:29] walking in the light of God's word for
[1:16:33] this day amen hallelujah amen now you
[1:16:37] got you notice
[1:16:39] that
[1:16:41] monkeys love things that Glitter
[1:16:44] and shiny and I love those shiny things
[1:16:48] and Ravens they like to steal ladies
[1:16:52] don't mistake and put your wedding band
[1:16:55] near the window
[1:16:56] because some of these birds like Ravens
[1:16:59] they're attracted by that and it's
[1:17:01] honest to goodness they do they'll pick
[1:17:04] that thing up steal it and put it in
[1:17:05] their nest and carry it away like that
[1:17:08] and that's the same thing people you
[1:17:11] have church memberships now and they're
[1:17:13] looking for a great big Tabernacle uh
[1:17:17] you know they're looking for a fantastic
[1:17:20] building they're looking for scholarly
[1:17:23] pastors they're looking for men with
[1:17:26] degrees that can blast on this wall and
[1:17:29] they're looking for man that can you
[1:17:32] know speak and like an angel and then
[1:17:35] sing like anything they're just looking
[1:17:37] for all those kinds of things and their
[1:17:39] minds gone away to get to the sincere
[1:17:43] original truth out of the word of God
[1:17:47] back to the word
[1:17:49] to the original faith back to what God
[1:17:52] wants us to be and to recognize him amen
[1:17:56] that he is Lord of all
[1:17:58] I am God he says be beside me there is
[1:18:02] none of none else
[1:18:03] I'm the only one none beside me
[1:18:06] non-belorming on beside me everywhere
[1:18:08] there is no such a thing as a trinity
[1:18:11] that's a lie from the pits of hell it's
[1:18:14] not in your Bible the devil used into
[1:18:17] inferences in the Bible like zero he
[1:18:20] says father son Holy Ghost he's
[1:18:22] referring to the titles that he himself
[1:18:24] holds
[1:18:26] amen I am the father I'm a son and I'm a
[1:18:30] human being doesn't make me treat people
[1:18:31] I'm the same person that I am that's
[1:18:34] exactly what it is and that's how God is
[1:18:36] God the great father of all
[1:18:41] wanting to redeem his sons and daughters
[1:18:43] created a body for himself
[1:18:46] that's why Jesus says it's the father
[1:18:48] that dwells to me he do it the works
[1:18:51] God wasn't Christ reconciling the world
[1:18:55] himself
[1:18:56] created a body for himself got in that
[1:18:58] body did the work of redemption to bring
[1:19:01] us back to him aren't you happy
[1:19:04] that he offered himself as a Living
[1:19:07] Sacrifice to bring us back to himself
[1:19:10] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[1:19:12] them
[1:19:13] I recognize Who I Am by the grace of God
[1:19:17] Amen so get away from all these shiny
[1:19:20] things that you see out there and let
[1:19:22] God have his way light is a beautiful
[1:19:25] thing how many of you recognize the
[1:19:27] qualities of Life uh just to talk about
[1:19:29] a few of it light is a a wonderful thing
[1:19:32] you know because a light revives and
[1:19:36] restores
[1:19:37] it brings life
[1:19:40] you know you have plants I'm not talking
[1:19:43] about rubber plants silk flowers I'm
[1:19:45] talking about real flowers
[1:19:47] those ones can live in any darkness and
[1:19:51] they can Thrive without any light but
[1:19:54] real plants have to have light
[1:19:57] amen and if you're a son or a daughter
[1:20:00] of God you can be going to a church but
[1:20:02] you really can't come into the fullness
[1:20:05] of who you are supposed to be unless you
[1:20:08] come on the light real light streams of
[1:20:12] everlasting light from the presence of
[1:20:14] almighty God to shine upon you amen
[1:20:16] thank God it's the rising of the sun
[1:20:20] amen praise God not the son out there
[1:20:23] but the Son of God shining upon us with
[1:20:26] his mercy and light upon us amen God's
[1:20:30] changing his bright shining light of
[1:20:33] wisdom and understanding no wonder he
[1:20:35] said a greater than Solomon is here
[1:20:40] The Book of Proverbs
[1:20:42] do you know that's the wisdom of Solomon
[1:20:45] Solomon speaking as a natural man with
[1:20:48] the heights of human wisdom God allowed
[1:20:51] that to be included in the Bible here
[1:20:55] and he's telling you that even that are
[1:20:58] greater than Solomon is here
[1:21:02] praise the Lord who is greater the
[1:21:05] wisdom of God reflecting for a man
[1:21:07] produce that now God's speaking through
[1:21:12] his own son or the body he created call
[1:21:15] it a son and spoke through it for his
[1:21:17] glory and what more can we ask for than
[1:21:21] to receive that from the presence of God
[1:21:24] wonderful praise the name of the Lord
[1:21:26] Jesus we give him all the praise all the
[1:21:29] honor and the glory amen praise God now
[1:21:34] God's light of man's you know I don't
[1:21:37] know about you but I received a a light
[1:21:40] bill the other day and I had to look
[1:21:43] twice
[1:21:44] because the cost of the light bill I
[1:21:46] don't know about your light bill but
[1:21:49] my goodness if you forgot one light on
[1:21:53] and let that thing keep running all day
[1:21:55] the next thing you know when the light
[1:21:57] bill comes it's way up there you're
[1:22:00] wondering what's going on see man's
[1:22:03] light
[1:22:04] you always got to pay for somehow
[1:22:07] whether the man is in the Pulpit say
[1:22:09] giving you light what is in a masonic
[1:22:11] Lord say he's given you light whether he
[1:22:14] is a rustic Christian or whatever he is
[1:22:17] or conspirator or he says he's giving
[1:22:20] you light uh you got to pay for that
[1:22:22] light but God's light is free
[1:22:26] the sun just shines
[1:22:28] you don't hear a booming voices now you
[1:22:32] must pay
[1:22:35] they go and they get solar light and
[1:22:38] then they go make money off of it
[1:22:40] right
[1:22:42] it's God's light and he just gave it
[1:22:43] free give the water free give the breeze
[1:22:45] you you're breeding free and any day he
[1:22:48] wants he can just stop it like he told
[1:22:51] job he says what are they talking about
[1:22:53] I can just tell the snow to just flood
[1:22:56] the whole place and they can't move
[1:22:57] nothing can happen all right and that's
[1:23:00] one thing God is God do you believe that
[1:23:04] amen he can dry up the ocean
[1:23:09] and turn the Sahara Desert into a into a
[1:23:12] sea
[1:23:14] he can do whatever he wants because he
[1:23:16] is God
[1:23:17] and we must trust him and believe him
[1:23:20] praise the Lord amen look I'm talking
[1:23:23] about him but he is here
[1:23:26] his presence is here
[1:23:29] we can't see him with our eyes
[1:23:31] but the one whom we serve by faith and
[1:23:35] believe in our hearts that that person
[1:23:37] is in our midst
[1:23:41] and we believe him with all our hearts
[1:23:43] and if we believe him one day there'll
[1:23:46] be a Rapture and we'll see him face to
[1:23:49] face and tell the story saved by the
[1:23:53] grace of almighty God not by my wisdom
[1:23:56] my my knowledge my effort of training to
[1:23:59] be a Christian but being empowered by
[1:24:01] the Holy Spirit to be what he wants me
[1:24:04] to be
[1:24:05] praise the name of the Lord I I'm going
[1:24:08] to try to say a little more and then let
[1:24:11] you go because as much I can stay say
[1:24:14] but praise God light is also a revealer
[1:24:20] because you may be walking on a dark
[1:24:22] path
[1:24:23] and you're walking and there's a
[1:24:24] pressing piss in front of you and you
[1:24:26] don't know it
[1:24:27] but if you had light shining you'll know
[1:24:31] where it is to avoid it you see light is
[1:24:33] a revealed it reveals to you also an
[1:24:37] enemy
[1:24:40] hiding in the bushes
[1:24:42] waiting with a hammer
[1:24:45] to hammer you
[1:24:48] but when you have light it reveals that
[1:24:52] enemy
[1:24:53] that's why the devil fears revelation
[1:24:56] he doesn't he's not scared of the Bible
[1:24:58] itself because he reads this do you know
[1:25:01] what the devil reads this
[1:25:03] you know the devil believe the Bible
[1:25:05] more than some of these people so
[1:25:07] there's no God
[1:25:09] and the Bible says the Devil Himself
[1:25:11] believes
[1:25:13] and he believes it's sincerely so much
[1:25:15] that the Bible says he trembles
[1:25:18] right he trembles because he knows the
[1:25:20] truth
[1:25:21] but he he's just the father of Lies he
[1:25:24] got to keep lying all the time I like
[1:25:27] that but so we find out friends that he
[1:25:30] can be hiding to try to Ambush you but
[1:25:33] the light of God will always reveal him
[1:25:36] to you and you'll recognize him and be
[1:25:39] able to get away from him amen praise
[1:25:43] the name of the Lord it will reveal to
[1:25:45] you these things unseen dangers
[1:25:50] Hallelujah reveal to you all this all
[1:25:54] kinds of lurking enemies you know also
[1:25:57] Darkness brings to you fear
[1:26:00] you're in darkness
[1:26:02] and you've gone into Fair
[1:26:04] why because you're uncertain of what to
[1:26:07] do
[1:26:08] and the devil wants to keep you in
[1:26:10] darkness so your your your your
[1:26:12] uncertain of who God is
[1:26:16] what should his children be like how
[1:26:19] should they live
[1:26:20] but I'm here to tell you be certain of
[1:26:23] God
[1:26:24] amen let the light of God shine into
[1:26:27] your heart amen so you can know what it
[1:26:30] is that you are doing praise God
[1:26:33] hallelujah when you're in darkness any
[1:26:36] little shadow
[1:26:38] you know I I told this to the church
[1:26:40] before when I was a boy I woke up early
[1:26:43] one morning when you know it's still
[1:26:45] dark and shadowy
[1:26:47] and I saw a man standing in the room
[1:26:51] oh my God
[1:26:53] like a a burglar or some I I start
[1:26:58] perspiring
[1:26:59] I'm not ashamed to tell you that uh in
[1:27:02] the instant I start perspiring I was
[1:27:04] fearful uh you know waiting for this man
[1:27:07] to make his move and I kept waiting and
[1:27:10] waiting and waiting for and he's not
[1:27:12] moving and then as the sun came up the
[1:27:15] light streamed Through the Windows only
[1:27:17] to see my father's pants
[1:27:20] on his shirt and on top of the he placed
[1:27:25] his hat
[1:27:28] ah
[1:27:31] so there were they in fear where no fear
[1:27:36] was
[1:27:37] needless fares and often we are in that
[1:27:41] situation of needless fears we're
[1:27:44] walking in a state of where we are like
[1:27:47] that so Darkness brings to us
[1:27:50] uncertainty
[1:27:51] it brings fear to us
[1:27:55] all kinds of Shadows and all kinds of
[1:27:58] fantasies now start coming to your mind
[1:28:00] monsters and whatever else you start to
[1:28:03] imagine because of the darkness but when
[1:28:06] the light is shining bright and
[1:28:08] everything else you can see where you're
[1:28:09] going what's all around you nothing can
[1:28:11] move without your seeing your fear is
[1:28:14] gone from you amen may God send the
[1:28:17] light of his word into your hearts today
[1:28:18] and drive away every fear from your
[1:28:21] heart every doubt from your soul and
[1:28:24] recognize your position in Christ
[1:28:28] amen yes sir Hallelujah you're walking
[1:28:32] in darkness you're walking having
[1:28:35] anxiety
[1:28:37] maybe you're here you're having anxiety
[1:28:40] I had it when I was a boy too I have to
[1:28:42] refer to this
[1:28:44] coming home after watching the movie
[1:28:46] Dracula
[1:28:49] and and it ended late
[1:28:52] and uh there was a graveyard that was a
[1:28:56] mile long
[1:28:58] and the road went right through the
[1:29:01] middle of the graveyard and my home was
[1:29:04] on the other side
[1:29:06] there's no way to get around that you
[1:29:08] must go through amen and so I'm walking
[1:29:12] well you know look how short I am when I
[1:29:16] was 10 years old recognize how short I
[1:29:17] was there
[1:29:20] and at that time I saw some adults going
[1:29:24] on the same road so I ran up a little
[1:29:28] bit close enough to them so as they walk
[1:29:30] I would walk and as they were walking
[1:29:33] but my feet were so short I couldn't
[1:29:35] keep up
[1:29:36] and the distance got further and further
[1:29:40] so all I can do is put my hands in my
[1:29:42] pocket and I'm whistling like I'm not
[1:29:44] scared
[1:29:45] and I'm whistling
[1:29:48] that's the way this world is
[1:29:51] we're in perilous times now
[1:29:53] trouble sometimes are here
[1:29:55] and the world is like whistling in the
[1:29:58] dark
[1:29:59] insane institutions are filled Insanity
[1:30:03] all around anxiety depression oppression
[1:30:08] is everywhere this is not a question or
[1:30:11] a matter of debate it's here everywhere
[1:30:14] people's nerves are on edge you get in
[1:30:17] the roads with the car and the nerves on
[1:30:20] edge you're walking and they're nerves
[1:30:23] on the edge you know all the time it's
[1:30:26] because they're walking in darkness
[1:30:29] but when a son a daughter a child of God
[1:30:32] is Walking In The Light of Life walking
[1:30:35] in the light of God's spirit and of
[1:30:38] God's word it lights up their life
[1:30:41] it gives them certainty they walk in
[1:30:45] confidence they walk knowing god is
[1:30:49] walking with them because he promised
[1:30:51] I'll never leave you alone
[1:30:54] praise be to God hallelujah amen God is
[1:30:58] good isn't he
[1:31:00] praise His name glory to God let me move
[1:31:04] on here now
[1:31:06] do you know

[1:31:11] tells us Revelation 21 to be exact could
[1:31:15] you put that up brother 21 23 to 27.
[1:31:21] I'm stretching this out because I want
[1:31:23] to keep you a little longer
[1:31:25] so you can receive some more of the word
[1:31:29] I could just keep talking and not give
[1:31:31] you the scriptures or say anything like
[1:31:33] that but I want to see it's not me

[1:31:45] the city the same light that was in rev
[1:31:48] Genesis 1.

[1:32:07] need of the sun neither of the moon to
[1:32:09] shine on it for the glory of God
[1:32:12] lightened it
[1:32:14] and the lamb is that light is the light
[1:32:18] thereof you see God the logos himself he
[1:32:23] is the light
[1:32:24] that is the light that leads the true
[1:32:27] sons and others of God and he said I am
[1:32:31] the light of the world he that followeth
[1:32:34] me shall not walk in darkness
[1:32:38] amen you will not walk around with the
[1:32:42] lack of understanding you will not walk
[1:32:44] reading your Bible with not having the
[1:32:47] spirit of Revelation
[1:32:49] you will not go out there uh thinking
[1:32:53] you have to have endless Bible studies
[1:32:55] to get to know God Amen praise the Lord
[1:32:59] you just fellowship with your father get
[1:33:01] close to him and you'll begin to know
[1:33:03] him more and more is that right praise
[1:33:06] the Lord my dad was alive I sit on his
[1:33:08] knee and he'd talk to me and I talked to
[1:33:10] him praise the Lord that's the same
[1:33:12] thing we go in prayer we go in the
[1:33:14] presence of God and we just talk to him
[1:33:16] praise God prayer is not something where
[1:33:18] you go and you have a real official
[1:33:21] prayer
[1:33:24] oh God I come to thee no
[1:33:29] Heavenly Father you're so good
[1:33:32] you're so kind
[1:33:34] you're wonderful
[1:33:36] I thank you so much
[1:33:38] that you remembered me
[1:33:42] millions billions have gone before my
[1:33:45] time but yet you remembered me
[1:33:48] amen oh that love of God filling and
[1:33:52] flooding the human heart to recognize
[1:33:54] that we are one with him we come from
[1:33:57] him we're going back to him
[1:34:00] and that's what he's here for the spirit
[1:34:02] of God is crying out and calling calling
[1:34:06] to his sons and daughters to come home
[1:34:08] come home why it's wedding supper time
[1:34:12] praise the Lord time to come home into
[1:34:15] the presence of God revelation 22 3-5
[1:34:26] and there shall be no more curse but the
[1:34:29] Throne of God and of the Lamb shall be
[1:34:31] in it and his servants Shall Serve him
[1:34:35] and there they shall see his face
[1:34:39] and his name shall be in their forage I
[1:34:42] won't talk about that for it says no man
[1:34:44] see God and live but is turning wrong
[1:34:46] and saying that these sons and daughters
[1:34:49] going to see God's face
[1:34:52] and they're not going to die they're
[1:34:53] going to live
[1:34:54] and it's simple just to know because
[1:34:57] they come from him when they are one
[1:34:59] with him and they are part of him they
[1:35:02] can see his face
[1:35:04] and if you're a Son of God you're a
[1:35:07] daughter of God
[1:35:08] you will see the word
[1:35:11] you'll recognize every word of it if I a
[1:35:14] true son and daughter of God sitting
[1:35:16] here today and the moment I just move if
[1:35:20] I move off of the true revelation of
[1:35:23] that word like that
[1:35:24] something in here John 1 says
[1:35:27] you have a witness
[1:35:30] this is not by comparison comparing
[1:35:32] scripture with scripture which you you
[1:35:35] should do but it's not that
[1:35:38] if you have a witness a supernatural
[1:35:41] witness within you is that right and and
[1:35:44] that's the he is the teacher is that
[1:35:46] right he's giving you what he's giving
[1:35:49] you uh inside teaching
[1:35:52] um to use a human term he gives you
[1:35:55] intuition
[1:35:56] you know tuition means teaching so so
[1:35:59] the spirit of almighty God is now
[1:36:02] teaching us uh his himself teaching us
[1:36:06] to recognize who he is that he is not
[1:36:09] just a God in the sky but he is your
[1:36:12] father he is your father not just using
[1:36:15] the terms Loosely really here's your
[1:36:17] father
[1:36:19] amen your parents only brought forth
[1:36:21] this natural outer man that will pass
[1:36:23] away and die but the soul Eternal on the
[1:36:27] inside came from God and it must go back
[1:36:30] to God because it's Eternal being that's
[1:36:33] in a body of time
[1:36:37] and when it drops that body it rises to
[1:36:41] go back absent from the body
[1:36:43] present with the Lord hallelujah isn't
[1:36:46] that wonderful to know we are one with
[1:36:50] him praise the name of the Lord you know
[1:36:52] the natural Sun can only shine on half
[1:36:54] of the Earth at one time
[1:36:58] when it's a light over this way it's
[1:37:00] Darkness on the other side
[1:37:02] but this light when it shines it covered
[1:37:05] the entire universe it's everywhere
[1:37:07] because it's God there's nowhere where
[1:37:09] God isn't there it's already there
[1:37:12] praise the Lord and we thank God for
[1:37:14] that in the same way in the book of Acts
[1:37:17] when that light shine in the book of
[1:37:18] Acts and and Peter and his Apostles
[1:37:21] begin to speak they say but how here we
[1:37:24] every man in our own language they were
[1:37:29] hearing
[1:37:30] those men who are speaking in known
[1:37:34] languages
[1:37:36] right
[1:37:38] praise God
[1:37:40] and some of those people didn't speak
[1:37:42] those languages and other ones did but
[1:37:45] they heard everyone in their own
[1:37:47] language
[1:37:48] see when God speaks his voice is
[1:37:51] universal
[1:37:53] let's say the God was just being here
[1:37:55] today and speak to all of us every one
[1:37:58] of us would hear regardless of what
[1:38:00] language we our culture or background
[1:38:02] we're from we've it all here because he
[1:38:04] is God
[1:38:06] and his voice will come forth to bless
[1:38:09] each and every one of us amen praise the
[1:38:12] name of the Lord glory to his wonderful
[1:38:14] name so
[1:38:16] the darkness in the church ages we were
[1:38:21] blessed by the lives of these seven
[1:38:23] Messengers
[1:38:25] spoken of seven stars in his right hand
[1:38:27] revelation 1.
[1:38:30] because stars reflect the light of the
[1:38:33] sun after the sun is dead or gone down
[1:38:36] and so these Messengers or men anointed
[1:38:39] of God were used to reflect the light
[1:38:42] and truth of God's word off of the
[1:38:44] throne back into the darkened Church age
[1:38:47] that we might have some light to live
[1:38:50] with but then Paul died and the church
[1:38:54] went into later on into what we call the
[1:38:58] Dark Ages how many knows about that
[1:39:01] it went into the Dark Ages this is not
[1:39:04] I'm not making this up it's right there
[1:39:07] um but now in the Dark Ages and during
[1:39:10] this Dark Ages God still had he never
[1:39:13] leaves himself without a witness as one
[1:39:15] scripture God never leaves himself
[1:39:18] without the witness so even in the Dark
[1:39:20] Ages he had a few men a few people here
[1:39:24] and there that he would reveal himself
[1:39:26] too and there were like star lights
[1:39:29] reflecting his light back into the
[1:39:32] church age and being a blessing to the
[1:39:34] people amen but now we know the church
[1:39:38] ages have come to an end praise God but
[1:39:42] then Here Comes what the messenger from
[1:39:46] heaven
[1:39:47] the Holy Spirit himself
[1:39:50] come to interpret his own word
[1:39:53] and I've said it like this before
[1:39:56] um
[1:39:56] when we were in school
[1:39:59] we see a young lady that we really like
[1:40:03] and we give our friends a note
[1:40:06] and
[1:40:07] take this note to her all right because
[1:40:10] we don't have the courage to to go and
[1:40:13] take the note of ourselves so we give
[1:40:16] him the note and let him take it to her
[1:40:18] and she'll read it and
[1:40:23] some we this is what we were trying to
[1:40:25] avoid some some of the girls were just
[1:40:30] and that's like a bad feeling to that
[1:40:32] guy to know he's rebuffed like that
[1:40:36] but if he wrote the note
[1:40:39] and she read it didn't say anything
[1:40:40] sends another note read it doesn't say
[1:40:43] anything send another note she reads it
[1:40:46] again and she's giggling
[1:40:48] okay things looks like it's all right
[1:40:50] now
[1:40:52] so what's he going to do at that point
[1:40:55] you think he's sending a note again with
[1:40:58] his friend
[1:40:59] no no no no no no he he is now going to
[1:41:02] approach her himself
[1:41:04] and that's what I'm trying to tell you
[1:41:06] God has done he sent prophets he sent
[1:41:10] Messengers down Through the Ages
[1:41:12] bringing his word to his people but now
[1:41:16] is the time just before the rapture
[1:41:20] when he is coming in he has come in
[1:41:24] person he's appearing
[1:41:27] preparing for his physical coming
[1:41:31] Supernatural appearing preparing for his
[1:41:35] physical coming and appearance right so
[1:41:38] he comes to her and approaches her
[1:41:40] himself and that's what he's doing to
[1:41:42] you now
[1:41:44] by revealing his word to you
[1:41:48] is trying to let you get to know him
[1:41:51] the Unseen god making himself through
[1:41:55] the opening of the word he's here now as
[1:41:59] the day star
[1:42:01] from on high not one of those seven
[1:42:03] stars but he is the day star from
[1:42:06] Mannheim
[1:42:07] bringing Heavenly sunshine and shining
[1:42:10] his light within our hearts and flooding
[1:42:12] our souls with his glory Divine praise
[1:42:16] God I know you read about Gideon how
[1:42:19] many of you ever read about Gideon in
[1:42:20] the Bible I'm going to wind this up now
[1:42:22] so don't get nervous that I'm going to
[1:42:23] keep you till midnight like Paul did
[1:42:27] but even if I did on your fell out the
[1:42:29] window I will have to raise you up
[1:42:33] is that right
[1:42:34] praise God at least I'll try about a God
[1:42:37] give me the ministry preach the word I
[1:42:39] don't know he gave me the ministry to
[1:42:40] raise the dead but anyway
[1:42:45] so Gideon had this what did God tell him
[1:42:49] he says get some lights put them inside
[1:42:52] of the picture
[1:42:53] these are all types and shadows speaking
[1:42:56] of you and I like I said but the light
[1:42:59] behind your body's skin
[1:43:01] right he had The Light Within These
[1:43:05] um little containers like that and then
[1:43:10] God said at a certain time when it's
[1:43:13] necessary for the drive away your enemy
[1:43:15] and go fight them
[1:43:18] a sudden light break the pictures amen
[1:43:21] and when you break that picture the
[1:43:23] lights begins to shine amen and when the
[1:43:26] light shines the enemy wants to flee
[1:43:28] from it right so you know that let me
[1:43:31] put it up down to earth way
[1:43:34] not that you're living in a house that
[1:43:36] wraps roaches unlock all kinds of stuff
[1:43:39] like that
[1:43:40] but you know that if the room is in
[1:43:43] darkness
[1:43:45] you turn on that light watch them rats
[1:43:48] run watch them they're running
[1:43:50] everywhere spiritual is the same thing
[1:43:53] happen
[1:43:54] casting out Devils is really casting out
[1:43:57] on belief
[1:43:59] out of the hearts of men praise the Lord
[1:44:02] yeah it's nice to say that but I've I've
[1:44:05] cast out living Devils right there right
[1:44:09] in the presence of God I had some run
[1:44:11] out the church because the word of God
[1:44:13] preaching the truth coming forth he
[1:44:15] can't take it and and just come out some
[1:44:18] run to the bathroom and they vomit up
[1:44:20] all on the floors in the church because
[1:44:22] the holy the devil wants to come out
[1:44:24] he's hearing the word he knows it's the
[1:44:27] word he recognizes that the truth of the
[1:44:29] word of God you know it don't take you
[1:44:31] to
[1:44:32] to make me look like I'm a devil master
[1:44:35] I'm a miracle man you are a man of power
[1:44:39] no no no no that's not you want to hide
[1:44:43] the true sons of God wants to get out to
[1:44:46] the scene and get the people to look
[1:44:49] away to Jesus
[1:44:51] so you see Jesus only
[1:44:53] see his face alone recognize he is Lord
[1:44:57] of all and we are just Sons
[1:44:59] and daughters Servants of the Living God
