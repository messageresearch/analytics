[36:41] chapter 8. We're going to continue um in
[36:44] the thoughts that we've been discussing
[36:47] over the last uh you know, five, this is
[36:49] our sixth week. I believe it'll probably
[36:52] end next week. I thought maybe it might
[36:54] end this week. I don't think so. But
[36:56] let's see what the Lord uh says and what
[36:58] the Lord does because every time I go to
[37:01] study I I see more and I I see the
[37:04] simplicity and how important it is to
[37:07] minister to every level of of uh sons
[37:11] and daughters of God and and and the
[37:13] people. Amen. They all need to hear the
[37:16] word of God for this day and this hour.
[37:18] So let's read the word. Revelations
[37:20] chapter 8 verse one. Very simple
[37:23] scripture. It says, "And when he had
[37:26] opened the seventh seal, there was
[37:29] silence in heaven about the space of
[37:32] half an hour." Let us pray. Father,
[37:36] we so appreciate, Lord, that we can read
[37:39] your word and we can even agree with
[37:42] your word. But there's more than that,
[37:45] Father. There's the part that we can
[37:48] receive your word. And Lord, it it is
[37:52] something that when we receive it, it
[37:55] changes our hearts. It changes our
[37:57] lives. It brings uh situations in our uh
[38:02] in our surroundings subject to your word
[38:05] because the word of God has an effect
[38:08] upon our lives. And Lord, today we're
[38:11] asking you to speak to the needs that
[38:13] are in our midst. Oh God, through these
[38:16] uh through this series, through these
[38:18] teachings, uh Lord, may you speak and
[38:21] and do great things in our lives that
[38:23] will draw us into a closer relationship.
[38:26] Bring us to the attention of how it
[38:29] pertains to us, personal in this day,
[38:33] not churchianity, but personal. Lord,
[38:38] this is what we're interested in. This
[38:40] is what we desire. that personal walk
[38:42] with you, Lord. Grant it. Walk with us,
[38:45] talk with us, inspire us, and hear
[38:48] through us. We pray in Jesus' name.
[38:51] Amen. And amen. Praise God. God bless
[38:53] you, saints. You may be seated.
[38:57] Amen. Glory to God. So, we've been on a
[38:59] series of being under authority. And
[39:01] when we recognize that being under the
[39:03] authority of the word of God, it places
[39:06] us in a in into a a position of
[39:09] authority. Amen. And it allows us to to
[39:12] be carriers of the word for this day and
[39:14] for this hour. And as carriers of the
[39:17] word, we carry the word of life. And you
[39:21] know, we become written epistles read of
[39:23] all men. We become uh the voice of God
[39:26] in in these in these last days when we
[39:29] can recognize what it is to receive his
[39:32] word and to come under the leadership of
[39:34] his word. Amen. And so last week we read
[39:37] the scripture on in Ephesians where you
[39:39] know where it talks about in in verse 10
[39:42] it says that in the dispensation of the
[39:45] fullness of times he might gather
[39:47] together in one all things in Christ.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; When we look at the word Christ it means
[39:55] anointed.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; It means the anointed one. It means
[39:59] where God's word is being anointed in
[40:02] this day and in this hour. And you know
[40:05] when Jesus Christ was on the earth, he
[40:08] was the anointed word being manifest to
[40:11] the people.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; And those that recognized him recognized
[40:17] the anointed word for their day.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; It brought them into the fellowship of
[40:23] the word. It brought them into being a
[40:26] part of the word. They walked with him.
[40:29] They talked with him. They fellowshipped
[40:32] with him. They were given power and
[40:34] authority to cast out demons to to to to
[40:38] pray for the sick. All of those things
[40:40] were because of the anointing of Christ
[40:44] that was upon them. And both which and
[40:48] it continues both which are in heaven
[40:51] and which are on earth even in him. And
[40:55] so we've been talking about dimensions.
[40:58] We've been talking about the influence
[41:00] of dimensions. how important it is to
[41:02] understand that it gives us the ability
[41:05] to understand our existence, our
[41:08] purpose, our uh placing in the word of
[41:12] God in the day that we're living in.
[41:14] We're not just churchgoers. We're not
[41:17] just church members. We don't just
[41:19] belong to Good Neighbor Ministries on
[41:21] New Street. We belong to the mystical
[41:24] living body of Jesus Christ.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; We've come into a contact with the
[41:29] living God. Amen. Praise God. And so
[41:33] this understanding and this uh you know
[41:36] um revelation of your existence, it it
[41:39] it gives you uh uh uh perfect faith to
[41:43] know what to do with the word of God in
[41:46] your day to realize what it is that God
[41:50] requires of our lives. Amen. And this
[41:54] is, you know, and and when you don't
[41:56] have a revelation of what God is doing
[41:57] in your day, you you you're you're being
[42:01] tossed about by the influences of that
[42:04] fifth dimension, which is the dimension
[42:07] of the lost, the dimension of death and
[42:10] hell. It's it's a it's a place where
[42:13] where uh influence is all over the earth
[42:16] right now. It's never been as strong as
[42:18] it is right now, but never has there
[42:21] been a time where the influence of
[42:23] Christ himself has been so strong upon
[42:27] the church in this day and in this hour.
[42:30] Amen. And so all religions of the world,
[42:33] they're trying to figure out, you know,
[42:35] what happens after death. They're all
[42:38] trying to figure out where they're going
[42:39] to go after this dimension. And that's
[42:41] why there's so many teachings. But we
[42:44] thank God that God sent us a prophet.
[42:46] Amen.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; That gave us an insight. Not only did
[42:50] he, you know, uh, read and talk about
[42:53] the scriptures and and expound on the
[42:55] scriptures, but he was the scripture
[42:58] being fulfilled in his day under the
[43:01] scriptures of Malachi 4:5, Revelations
[43:04] 10:1-7. He was given the ability to go
[43:08] interdimensional.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the people were all in
[43:12] confusion as to what would happen after
[43:15] death. There's confusion in all the
[43:17] different churches. Some are seeing a
[43:19] rapture where people are just going to
[43:21] float up into the air. They've got all
[43:23] kinds of teachings. Some say, "Oh, well,
[43:25] you were a dog in your previous life and
[43:28] in this one now you're a human. You've
[43:30] you've you know, you've you've risen
[43:32] into a higher form of consciousness."
[43:34] No, it's all teachings and theories of
[43:38] man. Amen. It took a God sent prophet
[43:42] with thus sayeth the Lord
[43:44] &gt;&gt; to come in the 20th century to restore
[43:48] the word of God back to the faith of the
[43:51] fathers. Amen.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; It took a a God sent prophet not
[43:55] vindicated by man, not because I'm
[43:58] telling you, but because God vindicated
[44:00] the ministry. God stood behind the
[44:03] pulpit. And when he when when he said,
[44:06] "Thus sayaeth the Lord, rise up, a man
[44:09] that was crippled from birth, a blinded
[44:12] man, somebody that would drop dead." And
[44:14] the Holy Spirit would say, "Pray over
[44:16] that and call it back to life." Over and
[44:19] over again, it happened. There was
[44:21] testimonies. What was God doing?
[44:23] Vindicating his word
[44:25] &gt;&gt; for that day so that the could draw the
[44:28] people to the attention of the word of
[44:30] God. It's always been the word. Amen.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; Drawing the attention back to the word.
[44:36] Amen. Amen. Glory to God. And so we
[44:41] looked at how God was bringing an
[44:43] anointing through every age and all the
[44:46] all the church ages and how the the
[44:48] anointing is the Holy Ghost. To receive
[44:51] the Holy Ghost is to receive the the the
[44:54] word and the standard to overcome the
[44:57] age that you're in.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so that's why it's so
[45:01] important. You're never going to not
[45:02] hear it from this pulpit. Have you
[45:04] received the Holy Ghost since you
[45:07] believed? You could be a Christian. You
[45:09] could be going to a Baptist church,
[45:11] Presbyterian church, Catholic church.
[45:13] You could be going to a message church.
[45:16] Have you received the Holy Ghost since
[45:19] you believed? Because to receive the
[45:22] Holy Ghost, it's is to receive him
[45:24] &gt;&gt; in the power of his resurrection.
[45:26] That'll open the word of God to you like
[45:29] never before. that when you read the
[45:31] word, the spirit gives it life.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; It comes out of the book, comes out of
[45:37] the becomes a brand new book. That's why
[45:39] brother Brandham, you know, when he said
[45:41] it's become a brand new book is because
[45:43] he was moving through the dispensations.
[45:46] Amen. Praise God.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; And so we are today we're going to be
[45:51] looking at go to the next slide. We're
[45:53] going to be looking at the seventh seal
[45:56] and how it completes the rapture
[45:59] dispensation.
[46:02] Remember, the opening of that seventh
[46:04] seal
[46:06] was the opening of the mystery of God.
[46:10] We're going to be looking at it a little
[46:12] more in depth to see how it is that it's
[46:15] that that that it just continues to
[46:18] unveil itself and it's going to complete
[46:22] everything.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; It's going to bring everything to a
[46:26] completion. The part that we are in
[46:29] right now is called the rapture of the
[46:32] church. And so we're interested in how
[46:36] the seventh seal is going to unveil
[46:39] itself, which is him to us in order to
[46:43] bring us into our position to fulfill
[46:46] the rapture. Amen. Praise God. So let's
[46:50] let's move along here. Let's see what
[46:52] the Lord is going to give us. And you
[46:54] pray and believe. I believe God will
[46:56] give us something that will uh inspire
[47:00] us and and give us something to to to
[47:02] look, you know, to to keep pressing on,
[47:05] saints. This is this is what this
[47:07] message does. The Holy Spirit gives us
[47:10] faith to keep pressing on. Amen. And so
[47:13] it's so important for us to recognize
[47:15] the ministry that that William Branham
[47:18] had in the opening of the word and and
[47:21] especially in the dispens dispensational
[47:25] change that took place in 1963.
[47:28] Last week I was reading to you some
[47:31] quotes from uh having conferences with
[47:34] God where brother Brandham gives his
[47:36] account of going beyond the curtain of
[47:38] time. And there was a portion of it if
[47:41] you remember last week I couldn't find
[47:43] it because I had accidentally deleted
[47:45] it. And so I realized that you know what
[47:49] it was meant for today. So let's go to
[47:51] the next slide.
[47:53] And here now so this is a continuation
[47:55] now. Brother Brandham is caught up into
[47:57] that sixth dimension. He's crossed over
[48:01] beyond the curtain of time and he's he's
[48:03] seeing, you know, uh the the woman there
[48:06] that he led to Christ when she was 90
[48:08] years old. And she was a young,
[48:09] beautiful woman in a perfect beautiful
[48:13] body of a young lady. Amen. But there
[48:16] was no connection. There was no
[48:18] sensation when they hugged and they came
[48:20] to him and oh God bless you, brother
[48:22] Brandham. The He said there was nothing
[48:25] but perfect love in that dimension. But
[48:28] look at what happens here. And he goes
[48:30] on, he says, "And I said,"Well, well,
[48:32] what what do you set me up here for?"
[48:35] Because they were taking him to set him
[48:37] up before the people. And they said,
[48:39] "You was a leader. You led us."
[48:44] And I said, "Oh, let me see Jesus if
[48:47] I've passed over." You see, he thought,
[48:49] "Well, praise God. I'm here. I've
[48:52] arrived, you know, and and and I want to
[48:55] see him." And that voice said, "You
[48:58] can't see him now." Said, "He will come,
[49:01] but first he will come to you." And
[49:05] said, "Judge you by the gospel you
[49:07] preached."
[49:09] &gt;&gt; You see, he was given a word for his
[49:11] day.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; He was given the revelation for that day
[49:14] and for that hour. And it led hundreds
[49:18] and millions of people, hundreds of
[49:20] thousands. He says he it was a sea of
[49:24] people. Amen. and said it'll and and I
[49:27] said brother Bram says and I said the
[49:29] gospel I preach they said yes and I said
[49:33] well with will St. Paul have to stand
[49:36] before his converts. They said
[49:39] absolutely he will too.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; And I said I never varied one word.
[49:46] He said I stayed just exactly the way
[49:49] the Bible said it. I don't care what
[49:52] anyone said or did not say. I stayed
[49:56] right with it like that. So if Paul's
[49:59] group is saved, mine is too. And a great
[50:03] scream came from looked like thousands
[50:06] and thousands and said, "We know that."
[50:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, they had they had received
[50:14] the word that that when they received
[50:16] their word in their day, it placed them
[50:20] into that sixth dimension, which is the
[50:23] the the the dimension of the redeemed.
[50:26] They realized that that was exactly the
[50:29] right word. And listen what brother Bram
[50:31] says. He said, "Praise God, I never was
[50:34] so happy that I stayed true to the
[50:37] word."
[50:39] &gt;&gt; Oh my. See, I was never so happy. He
[50:43] came to realize that the word that he
[50:45] had received was absolutely the truth.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. It had produced exactly what the
[50:52] Lord said that it was going to produce.
[50:54] And I'm saying to you, Amen. you stay
[50:58] true to the word of God that God has
[51:00] given you in this day and in this hour.
[51:03] Stay loyal to that word. Don't vary from
[51:06] that word. Don't allow the the the the
[51:09] you know the complacency of what
[51:11] Christianity has become in this day and
[51:15] in this hour to draw you away from from
[51:18] this uh this beautiful unadulterated
[51:21] word of God that he's placed into your
[51:24] hearts that he's given you in this day
[51:27] and in this hour. Amen. Praise God
[51:30] forever more. Hallelujah. And so
[51:34] we can um we can realize now that that
[51:37] this dimension of the of the redeemed,
[51:40] it's a reality. We don't have to
[51:43] question it. We know that that that you
[51:46] know, brother Brandham's ministry was
[51:48] vindicated of God. There was not one
[51:51] time that he said, "Thus sayeth the
[51:52] Lord," that it wasn't 100% accurate,
[51:56] proven over and over again. And we can
[52:00] believe that. Then you can believe this.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; You can believe that if you if you if
[52:05] you die, if you're not one of those ones
[52:08] that are going to be translated in the
[52:10] rapture, that's you know, because some
[52:12] are going to leave before before the
[52:15] rapture. Remember that the the rapture
[52:17] is a process and everybody's got their
[52:20] time and their season. And that's why we
[52:23] don't worry whether I die now or I go in
[52:26] the rapture. It's all the same thing.
[52:28] I'm going to be with the Lord.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to be in in that in that
[52:34] place of eternal life. Glory to God. And
[52:37] so, let's go on now. Let's move on. I
[52:40] just wanted to share that with you that
[52:42] you know that that this word that we've
[52:44] received. It's it's it's the only thing
[52:48] that we need. Amen.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; We don't need to vary off or go off and
[52:52] look for anything else. This is the word
[52:55] that will produce the rapture of the
[52:58] body of Jesus Christ. Amen. And so, here
[53:01] we go. Now, we're looking at the at the
[53:03] seventh dimension. Last week, we
[53:05] finished off with the sixth. Now, we're
[53:07] looking into the seventh. And the
[53:09] seventh dimension, well, the seventh
[53:11] dimension, go to the next slide, is is
[53:16] uh is where God is. Amen. It it's where
[53:19] God dwells in the seventh dimension. He
[53:22] alone rules the universe by his power
[53:24] and majesty. Heaven is his throne and
[53:28] earth is his foottool. One day his
[53:31] kingdom will come down on earth. Amen.
[53:34] Praise God. Heaven and earth will
[53:37] embrace together. The power of God will
[53:40] fill the earth and everything will get
[53:42] back to eternity. All those with eternal
[53:47] life. How do you get eternal life? You
[53:50] need the Holy Ghost because it is
[53:53] eternal life.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Repent. Be baptized. You shall
[53:57] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Long
[54:00] as you're human, you're going to have to
[54:02] come God's provided way. Amen. Praise
[54:05] God. You're going to fulfill the word
[54:07] according to the word because you are
[54:10] the word. When you receive the word,
[54:13] amen. And so, the power of God will fill
[54:15] the earth and everything will get back
[54:17] to eternity. All those with eternal life
[54:20] in them will enjoy
[54:22] their existence in his presence.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; You see, this is what we need to realize
[54:29] right now. We're living in a human
[54:31] existence and we're torn between the
[54:35] reality of God and having to go to work
[54:38] tomorrow morning and having to deal with
[54:41] with heartache and sickness and broken
[54:45] relationships
[54:46] and and all kinds of situations that are
[54:49] in our lives. We're we're we're living
[54:51] in a in an existence where if we don't
[54:55] wake up, if we don't come out of our
[54:58] stuper, and our slumber, and our
[55:00] laziness, and come into a recognition of
[55:04] what God is doing in this hour, we live
[55:06] miserable. We live uh you know,
[55:09] underprivileged. We don't live at the
[55:12] capacity. We should be the freest people
[55:14] on the earth, the happiest people on the
[55:17] earth. Amen. because God has filled us
[55:20] with himself with his spirit. Amen.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; But but we've only, you know, uh we we
[55:25] it's the Holy Ghost upon us right now.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And which is the anointing which
[55:31] is what which which is what gives you
[55:34] the ability to recognize the word in
[55:37] your day. The to to recognize God sent a
[55:40] prophet to to recognize that the the
[55:42] seals have been opened. What the se what
[55:44] the opening of the seals were. why the
[55:47] mighty angel comes down. You know, the
[55:49] lamb in in in Revelations 4 has got up
[55:51] to takes the book and then in
[55:53] Revelations 5, there's nobody worthy to
[55:57] open the book. And then all of a sudden
[55:59] in Revelations chapter 10, here's the
[56:01] mighty angel coming down with an open
[56:04] book. What does that all mean? We you if
[56:07] you go out into the Christian world
[56:09] right now and you ask them about what's
[56:11] the book all about, they're going to
[56:13] say, "What book?
[56:16] The Bible.
[56:18] Oh, the Bible. Oh, yeah. I've read the
[56:20] Bible. No, no, we're talking about the
[56:22] open book. We're talking about a book
[56:26] that that that John had a revelation of
[56:29] in in the book of Revelations. Let's
[56:32] let's move along here. Let's let's see
[56:34] how the Holy Spirit is going to show us
[56:36] things here. And so here now, um I I was
[56:41] Let's read the next scripture. We're
[56:42] going to go to Revelations chapter 1.
[56:44] I'm just laying in a little bit of a
[56:45] foundation here because we need to
[56:48] understand and people need to
[56:50] understand. That's why I'm saying, you
[56:51] know, you we we could go straight into
[56:53] the half hour of silence and and talk
[56:56] about all the the the deep things of the
[56:58] opening of the word and the seven seals,
[57:00] but but we need to have an understanding
[57:03] of God.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; That's where the confusion is. You see,
[57:08] this whole plan of redemption and the
[57:11] opening of the seventh seal in
[57:13] particular is all about the mystery of
[57:16] God. God uniting with man. It was all
[57:20] about God being with man and man
[57:25] understanding God and God being their
[57:29] their their their absolute so that they
[57:33] could walk with him, talk with him.
[57:36] Everything surrounds knowing who God is.
[57:38] Amen. And to not know him, to think that
[57:42] he's Allah in the Muslim teachings, to
[57:44] think that he's a whatever, a bird or
[57:47] something in the in the Buddhism or, you
[57:49] know, all these different existences
[57:51] that that they that they've created,
[57:53] they have no idea. They make him a new
[57:55] age uh consciousness. They make them
[57:57] know. You need to understand dimensions.
[58:01] You need to understand that God was
[58:04] moving from the self-existent one from
[58:07] before the foundations of this world and
[58:10] had a desire to move and to condescend
[58:14] and to become one with man,
[58:18] &gt;&gt; you and me. And there's a way that he's
[58:21] doing it. He's not the author of
[58:22] confusion. Amen. People say, "Oh, well,
[58:24] all roads lead to Rome."
[58:28] You might find yourself on a on a on a
[58:30] road and thinking that you're going to
[58:32] Rome and you find yourself uh meeting up
[58:35] with some some Roman soldier that chops
[58:38] your head off because of some teaching
[58:41] or some tradition of man. Amen. We need
[58:45] to we need the Holy Spirit. If the same
[58:48] spirit that raised Christ, the anointed
[58:52] word for that day, raised him from the
[58:55] dead, if it dwell in you, it'll not only
[58:59] guide you into all truth, it'll quicken
[59:01] you into that dimension with him.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not there yet. Oh, we we we
[59:07] we get to, you know, uh rejoice when we
[59:10] come to church and we get into heavenly
[59:13] places. Listen, we're going to tell it
[59:14] just the way it is. Saints, don't tell
[59:17] me you're living, oh, hallelujah, every
[59:20] day and you're praising God and
[59:22] everything is perfect.
[59:24] I'm telling you, tomorrow morning you're
[59:25] going to deal with stuff.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; You're going to have to overcome things
[59:29] in this world.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. We are in heavenly
[59:33] places when we come into the church and
[59:35] we get all caught up and it's wonderful
[59:37] to hear the word of God, but then you
[59:39] got to go out there and live it.
[59:41] But if you know that greater is he that
[59:44] is in you
[59:46] &gt;&gt; than he that is in the world out there
[59:49] while you're in this dispensational
[59:52] time element where you are being
[59:55] translated into the existence with God
[59:59] while you're in this transition you can
[1:00:02] you can receive word instruction
[1:00:06] uh uh uh uh revelation on on situ
[1:00:10] situations that are in your life where
[1:00:12] the enemy is trying to defeat you and
[1:00:15] and to bring you down. Amen. Praise God.
[1:00:18] But let's let's let's be real. We need
[1:00:21] to live our lives. Amen. We need to
[1:00:24] understand that we are overcomers.
[1:00:27] That we've been given the Holy Ghost for
[1:00:30] the purpose to to overcome.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; So whenever you face a trial, don't let
[1:00:34] the enemy just knock you down. get back
[1:00:37] up again and say, "The Lord gives."
[1:00:40] Hallelujah. The Lord takes and he's
[1:00:43] taken this spirit of condemnation out of
[1:00:46] my life. He's taking this spirit of
[1:00:49] depression out of my life. He's taking
[1:00:52] this sickness that's been trying to
[1:00:54] hinder me all the days of my out of my
[1:00:56] life. Amen. And he's given me peace.
[1:00:59] He's given me the the the the the
[1:01:02] ability to walk as a victor, as a
[1:01:05] overcomer in this day and in an age
[1:01:07] where the people are falling left,
[1:01:09] right, and center and and and being
[1:01:12] pulled into all kinds of man's teachings
[1:01:15] and traditions and deceptions.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:22] But here in Revelations 1:10
[1:01:25] to12, he says, "I was in the spirit on
[1:01:28] the Lord's day and heard behind me a
[1:01:31] great voice as a trumpet, saying, I am
[1:01:34] Alpha and Omega, the first and the last.
[1:01:40] And what thou seeest, write in a book,
[1:01:42] and send it unto the seven churches
[1:01:45] which are in Asia, unto Ephesus, unto
[1:01:48] Samia, unto Pergamus, unto Thitia, unto
[1:01:52] Sardis, unto Philadelphia, and unto
[1:01:55] Leodysia. And I turned to see the voice.
[1:02:00] He turns to see the voice
[1:02:03] which spake to to me. And being turned,
[1:02:07] I saw seven golden candlesticks.
[1:02:11] Now let's move to the next verse. And in
[1:02:13] the midst, next slide. And in the midst
[1:02:16] of the seven candlesticks, one like unto
[1:02:21] the son of man.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Now, now you got to notice here. This is
[1:02:26] what what what what I want to draw out
[1:02:28] of this because I want you to see that
[1:02:31] we have always had a part in this whole
[1:02:35] plan of redemption.
[1:02:38] You're going to come to realize that the
[1:02:40] God that you've come into contact with
[1:02:43] is is as much God in you as you are in
[1:02:48] him. When Adam was in the Garden of
[1:02:51] Eden, she was
[1:02:54] from him and she was an exact expression
[1:02:57] of him in female form. And so here, now
[1:03:01] listen. So he sees one like unto the son
[1:03:05] of man. Not the son of man. When we talk
[1:03:08] about the son of man, we're talking
[1:03:09] about Jesus Christ,
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; but one like unto the son of man.
[1:03:14] Because remember, you know, John is now
[1:03:17] interdimensional. You got to understand
[1:03:19] that like brother Brandham when he was
[1:03:21] able to look into that dimension and see
[1:03:24] the individual that had been at the
[1:03:26] doctor the day before and talking to the
[1:03:28] doctor and listening exactly what the
[1:03:30] doctor said and was able to tell her
[1:03:33] where and what the doctor said where
[1:03:35] what the ailment was where she lived
[1:03:38] where she city she came from everything
[1:03:41] that was because he was
[1:03:43] interdimensional. He was able to move
[1:03:46] into that dimension where there is no
[1:03:48] time.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; And now you can see everything that
[1:03:51] happened here and there and there and
[1:03:55] back there. You can see in every
[1:03:57] direction. That's why he knows the end
[1:03:59] from the beginning. And so John being
[1:04:02] caught up in the spirit on the Lord's
[1:04:06] day is telling you that he was in
[1:04:08] heavenly places. He was not in this
[1:04:12] earthly dimension. He was seeing things
[1:04:15] that nobody else could see. And he was
[1:04:17] told to write those things. And look,
[1:04:19] and he says, "Clothed with a garment
[1:04:21] down to the foot and a girth about the
[1:04:24] paps with a golden girdle. His head and
[1:04:28] his hairs were white like wool, as white
[1:04:31] as snow, and his eyes were as a flame of
[1:04:34] fire, and his feet like unto fine brass,
[1:04:37] as if they burned in a furnace, and his
[1:04:40] voice as the sound of many waters. Now,
[1:04:44] we we know that when we hear the voice
[1:04:47] was the sound of many waters, we know
[1:04:49] that that's people's, nations, tongues.
[1:04:52] Those are that represents the bride.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen here to what brother
[1:04:57] Brandham says in this quote here from
[1:04:59] the seven church ages in 1954. Now
[1:05:03] that's the Bible. He says that's what
[1:05:05] the spirit says. See the candlesticks.
[1:05:09] All right. He's he's commenting on this
[1:05:11] verse that we just read. Now the 13th
[1:05:13] verse. And in the midst of the seven
[1:05:16] golden candlesticks, one like the son of
[1:05:19] man. What? One like him. Who was this?
[1:05:25] his bride.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. You mean you mean she
[1:05:30] was always there? She was always a part
[1:05:33] of him. She was the voice of many waters
[1:05:36] that that that that that he was when
[1:05:38] when he said, "Tell these things to all
[1:05:41] the churches." You see, we are we are
[1:05:44] people of time and we are people that
[1:05:47] place things in the moment because of
[1:05:50] our earthly experience here in this
[1:05:53] dimension. But when you move into the
[1:05:56] mind of God and know that God is
[1:05:58] eternal. We've heard this over and over
[1:06:01] and over again.
[1:06:03] He had no beginning and he has no end.
[1:06:06] He sees the end from the beginning. The
[1:06:09] beginning from the He sees it all. He's
[1:06:11] omniscient. Amen. What he says his bride
[1:06:16] one like him.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Watch how it was clothed with a garment
[1:06:20] down to the foot. The holiness of Jesus
[1:06:23] Christ covering her has washed us from
[1:06:27] our sins with his own blood. Oh, glory
[1:06:31] to God. All right. Gird about the paps.
[1:06:33] Not a man, a woman.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She is the body of Jesus
[1:06:40] Christ. She is the female part of God
[1:06:43] himself. Amen. She's been always a part
[1:06:46] of him. He could never do this. He could
[1:06:49] not fulfill the plan of redemption
[1:06:52] without you.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Without me, we're we're a
[1:06:56] we're a part of that with a golden
[1:06:58] girdle. The gospel that held the power
[1:07:01] and glory of God over the body of
[1:07:05] Christ.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; So now we see here that this it was it
[1:07:11] we we've all always been in his mind. We
[1:07:15] were always a part when when the listen
[1:07:17] when the Holy Ghost came to to those
[1:07:19] that were the the the attributes of God
[1:07:22] through those church ages.
[1:07:24] They were receiving the the the
[1:07:27] anointing of the Holy Spirit of the Holy
[1:07:29] Ghost upon their lives which would give
[1:07:32] them the ability to overcome the age
[1:07:35] that they were in
[1:07:37] because God was working towards this
[1:07:40] great mystery of he himself
[1:07:44] coming down
[1:07:46] again.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; To indwell
[1:07:50] not just in the in the seventh
[1:07:52] dimension. He wanted to come and take on
[1:07:55] the seventh dimension, the sixth
[1:07:57] dimension, the first dimension, and the
[1:08:00] second dimension right here in our
[1:08:03] bodies. When we go into what is the next
[1:08:07] stage of our ministry,
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; we need to realize that there's a
[1:08:10] progression that's going to take us into
[1:08:14] that dimension. We're not there yet.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; We experience it.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; We experience the supernatural. You're
[1:08:21] going to see God do miracles.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; You're going to see God discern
[1:08:26] situations in your life.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; But as long as you're still in time,
[1:08:31] you're going to have to deal with this
[1:08:33] dimension.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a transition. And the seventh
[1:08:38] seal completes the rapture dispensation.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; But that's not the end of it all. It
[1:08:45] moves on. But we're but but we're
[1:08:48] concerned with what is going on right
[1:08:50] now. We want to know what God requires
[1:08:53] now. What the word is going to produce
[1:08:55] now. How I got to surrender to the word
[1:08:59] for my day so that it brings me into my
[1:09:02] position so that I can be what he wants
[1:09:05] me to be. Amen. Praise God. And so here
[1:09:10] we see and uh that that uh that that
[1:09:14] who the who the bride is and and and
[1:09:16] where she fits in. Now let's go to the
[1:09:18] next slide here in Revelations chapter 1
[1:09:21] 17 and 18.
[1:09:24] He goes on and he says, "And when I saw
[1:09:25] him, I fell at his feet as dead and he
[1:09:28] laid his right hand upon me, saying unto
[1:09:31] me, fear not. I am the first and the
[1:09:35] last. I am he that liveth and was dead
[1:09:41] and is alive. Behold, I am alive forever
[1:09:44] more. Amen. And have the keys of hell
[1:09:48] and death. Saints, he's the one that
[1:09:52] went to Calvary.
[1:09:54] He's the one that went to the cross.
[1:09:57] He's the one that took your sin. He was
[1:10:00] the He was Look, and he's making it very
[1:10:02] clear here. You don't have to be getting
[1:10:04] confused about Trinity. You don't have
[1:10:06] to be confused. He says, "I'm the first
[1:10:09] and the last." You don't have to get all
[1:10:12] confused about who Jesus is. Jesus, when
[1:10:16] he was in the form of Jesus, he was the
[1:10:19] son of God here on earth. But he was
[1:10:22] God.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was the anointed word in
[1:10:27] order to fulfill his own word.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; That said, if a man's sin, a man must
[1:10:31] die. And he says, "Don't worry. I'm
[1:10:33] gonna take that place
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; because my redemption has to be
[1:10:37] fulfilled.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; My plan of re of uniting myself holy
[1:10:42] with man must be fulfilled. My my my my
[1:10:46] my whole existence is based on myself
[1:10:51] with my with my bride with my my people
[1:10:56] with my own attributes. before we were
[1:10:59] even before he was even God. He was
[1:11:02] attribute form. He was the self-existent
[1:11:05] one. Before you were uh you know
[1:11:08] expressed here onto this earth as an
[1:11:10] attribute you were an attribute in God
[1:11:13] in female form.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; You were an attribute in female form
[1:11:18] within God. And God just expressed it.
[1:11:22] Amen. And so here he goes on. He says,
[1:11:24] "I am he that liveth and was dead.
[1:11:26] Behold, I am alive forever more. I've
[1:11:29] got the keys of death and hell. And And
[1:11:32] who needs the keys of death and hell in
[1:11:34] this hour?
[1:11:36] The bride.
[1:11:38] The bride. Because the pale horse rider,
[1:11:41] death and hell follows him. Everybody
[1:11:45] that that that that's that's under
[1:11:47] denominational teachings and the and the
[1:11:50] teachings of this world, Satan, that
[1:11:53] pale horse rider that's riding into all
[1:11:55] the churches, riding in right into this
[1:11:58] message, saints, the pale horse rider
[1:12:00] will never stop riding and death and
[1:12:04] hell is following him because they have
[1:12:07] not come into the understanding of the
[1:12:11] opening of the word and the importance
[1:12:14] of the mighty angel coming down to unite
[1:12:18] with the body.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so here we see what is
[1:12:24] Jesus telling us? He's the first. He's
[1:12:26] the last. There's no other gods. He was
[1:12:29] with the true church right from the
[1:12:31] beginning. Amen. From Pentecost all the
[1:12:34] way right up until now, he's been there
[1:12:37] with the true church. He raised a
[1:12:40] standard by giving each age his
[1:12:42] anointing to overcome each age. And now
[1:12:45] he's he went to he went to hell when he
[1:12:48] when he when he died at the cross. He
[1:12:50] went to paradise to hell right into that
[1:12:52] fifth dimension and he took the keys of
[1:12:55] death and hell and now he holds it. He
[1:12:58] he no more Satan can have power over the
[1:13:02] sons and daughters of God to keep them
[1:13:04] into bondage. If you recognize that the
[1:13:07] one who holds the keys to death and hell
[1:13:10] is in you today, there's nothing that
[1:13:12] should be holding you back.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; There's nothing that should be keeping
[1:13:16] you in a defeated condition any longer.
[1:13:19] Amen. You should be victorious. You
[1:13:22] should be overcoming every day. It's not
[1:13:24] easy to overcome. I'm not saying it's a
[1:13:26] bed of roses, but understand he that is
[1:13:30] in you, he that is with you, he that has
[1:13:33] already overcome for you. Amen. Praise
[1:13:36] God. All that was in God, he poured into
[1:13:40] Jesus Christ.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; And all that was now, all that was
[1:13:44] poured into Christ, he's poured it into
[1:13:47] the church.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Let's move along here. We're
[1:13:54] we're we're we're we're we're get we're
[1:13:56] going somewhere, saints. And God said in
[1:13:58] Genesis 1 verse 26-28, "And God said,
[1:14:02] let us make man in our own image after
[1:14:05] our likeness, and let them have dominion
[1:14:08] over the fish of the sea, and over the
[1:14:10] fowl of the air, and over the cattle,
[1:14:12] and over all the earth, and over every
[1:14:15] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[1:14:18] earth." I want you to understand that
[1:14:20] that when God made man in his image,
[1:14:24] when God was expressing himself, he had
[1:14:26] absolute supreme authority over
[1:14:29] everything.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; Everything.
[1:14:34] And so God created man in his own image.
[1:14:37] In the image of God created he him. Male
[1:14:40] and female created he them. You see, it
[1:14:45] was it's it's him expressed in male and
[1:14:48] female having full dominion, full
[1:14:51] authority,
[1:14:53] full uh he was he was the absolute
[1:14:56] supreme speh species on the earth that
[1:15:00] if he spoke nature would have to obey
[1:15:02] him that whatever he said it had to obey
[1:15:06] him. This is who we are. And God blessed
[1:15:10] them. And God said unto them, "Be
[1:15:12] fruitful, and multiply, and replenish
[1:15:15] the earth, and subdue it." And what did
[1:15:17] he say? Have dominion over the fish of
[1:15:21] the sea, and over the fowl of the air,
[1:15:23] and over every living thing that moveth
[1:15:27] upon the earth. Amen. Praise God. And
[1:15:31] the next slide says in verse 31, "And
[1:15:34] God saw everything that he had made. And
[1:15:37] behold, it was very good. Everything was
[1:15:42] perfect. Everything was exactly the way
[1:15:44] he wanted it. The way that he had spoken
[1:15:47] it, the way that it's exactly the way
[1:15:50] and everything and the evening and the
[1:15:52] morning were the sixth day." And now
[1:15:54] notice
[1:15:56] in the next chapter, chapter 2, thus the
[1:16:00] heavens and the earth were finished. So
[1:16:03] God had created this existence of heaven
[1:16:06] and earth and he had placed man and and
[1:16:11] and you know we we know that you know
[1:16:13] when we talk when when he says replenish
[1:16:15] we know that there that there may have
[1:16:17] been previous uh you know existences and
[1:16:21] previous uh you know uh worlds whatever
[1:16:25] that that's irrelevant. We know that the
[1:16:27] word of God that the worlds were framed
[1:16:30] by the word of God. But this is the
[1:16:31] world that pertains to us and this is
[1:16:34] what we need to be focused on. Amen. And
[1:16:37] so the heavens and the earth were
[1:16:39] finished and all the host of them. And
[1:16:41] on the seventh day God ended his work
[1:16:44] which he had made. And he rested on the
[1:16:47] seventh day from all his work which he
[1:16:49] had made. Now, Brother Brandham said
[1:16:52] that if you don't see Jesus Christ
[1:16:57] from Genesis to Revelation, go back and
[1:16:59] read it again because he's he's showing
[1:17:02] himself in every type
[1:17:05] throughout every character throughout
[1:17:08] the whole entire Bible.
[1:17:12] That seventh seal, he even said, was
[1:17:14] expressed in the book of Genesis.
[1:17:17] This seventh day is a type of the
[1:17:22] seventh seal where God rests from all
[1:17:26] that he had done. Does God need to rest?
[1:17:31] God doesn't sleep.
[1:17:33] God doesn't sleep.
[1:17:36] God is God is eternal. He just is.
[1:17:41] But notice what he said. It was all very
[1:17:44] good what he had created. Adam and Eve
[1:17:48] were exactly perfect in the way that he
[1:17:52] wanted to express and he knew that he
[1:17:56] could place he had given them the
[1:17:58] authority over the over the earth and he
[1:18:00] wanted them now to express themselves
[1:18:03] and to do all that he had in his mind
[1:18:08] all that he had desired to do. God
[1:18:11] didn't rest. God was showing that there
[1:18:14] would be a seventh day, a seventh seal
[1:18:18] that would come on the scene in in our
[1:18:21] day where God would would would step
[1:18:24] back and allow his bride now in in in
[1:18:29] the form of the church, the body of
[1:18:31] Christ through the opening of the word
[1:18:34] to enter into his rest, which is to have
[1:18:38] and to do what he had always desired to
[1:18:41] do
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; that seventh day when he rested and he
[1:18:45] stood back and said it's all good is
[1:18:47] because you were exactly the way God
[1:18:50] wanted you to be and he saw that
[1:18:53] everything was going to come forth until
[1:18:56] we see what happens in Genesis 3 where
[1:18:59] the serpent comes along and changes the
[1:19:02] program so that now he becomes a
[1:19:05] redeemer.
[1:19:07] Amen. So thus the heavens and the earth
[1:19:09] were finished all the host of them. God
[1:19:12] blessed the seventh day. Verse three and
[1:19:16] and sanctified it because that in it he
[1:19:19] had rested from all his work which God
[1:19:22] had created and made. But now there's a
[1:19:25] work that's going on because this was
[1:19:28] just a type of what God was going to be
[1:19:30] doing in this day that we were going to
[1:19:34] because this plan that he had in his
[1:19:36] mind, he's going to fulfill it. And we
[1:19:39] are going to we are going to be the body
[1:19:43] of Christ that's going to fulfill this
[1:19:46] uh plan of redemption and fulfill the
[1:19:49] rapture dispensation. Amen. Praise God.
[1:19:53] Let's read the next quote. He says, "And
[1:19:55] so God knew that we would be here.
[1:20:00] But then he put us in flesh so we could
[1:20:03] be contacted.
[1:20:06] In order he could contact, he become one
[1:20:09] of us when he become Jesus Christ,
[1:20:13] the son of God himself, the fullness of
[1:20:16] the manifestation of God. Therefore,
[1:20:19] that was God's purpose to display his
[1:20:23] attributes in fellowship. When I was in
[1:20:27] my father, I knew nothing about it.
[1:20:31] But when I become his son and was born
[1:20:34] of him, I was an attribute, a part of my
[1:20:37] father. And you're a part of your
[1:20:40] father. And as children of God, we are a
[1:20:43] part of God's attribute that was in him,
[1:20:47] made flesh like he was made flesh. So we
[1:20:50] can have fellowship one with the the
[1:20:54] other as a family of God upon the earth.
[1:20:58] And that was God's purpose at the
[1:21:02] beginning. It was always his purpose and
[1:21:06] his desire at the beginning. Amen. Next
[1:21:10] slide. That's what God wanted at the
[1:21:13] beginning. He had everything under
[1:21:15] control and he turned man over into the
[1:21:19] Garden of Eden on free moral agency.
[1:21:24] Say, "Son, it's yours."
[1:21:27] What a beautiful place. God was so
[1:21:30] satisfied till he just went back and
[1:21:32] rested from all his works.
[1:21:36] Every tree never brought forth thorns
[1:21:38] and thistles. No berries ever come off
[1:21:41] of a thorn tree. Everything was perfect.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; All seeds were perfect. Everything was
[1:21:48] in perfect condition. Then when he went
[1:21:52] to take a little rest,
[1:21:54] his enemy slipped in with deceit and
[1:21:59] took it over by misrepresenting his
[1:22:02] program to his children. And saints,
[1:22:06] this is what has happened over the last
[1:22:10] 2,000 years.
[1:22:12] The enemy had slipped in and and
[1:22:17] perverted the word of God and deceived
[1:22:21] many through all the church ages.
[1:22:24] But those that recognized their day and
[1:22:27] their message, they were those that that
[1:22:30] that because when when he went to to
[1:22:32] hell, he that that sixth dimension
[1:22:35] became available to those that were
[1:22:37] redeemed. All of a sudden, there was a
[1:22:39] place for those that could receive God,
[1:22:42] that could receive his word, that that
[1:22:44] could recognize what God was doing in
[1:22:46] their day. And if they died under that
[1:22:49] dispensation, they went right to the
[1:22:52] place of the redeemed. You see, he made
[1:22:54] a way for them. The enemy had slipped in
[1:22:58] and deceived. And the enemy is still in
[1:23:02] the camp.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; He's still deceiving the people.
[1:23:06] He has he's he's come in and and and and
[1:23:09] now it's it's working in the midst of of
[1:23:13] the same spirit, the same pale horse
[1:23:16] rider, the same deceiving spirit, the
[1:23:19] same denominational teachings, uh the
[1:23:22] same uh uh lying spirits to try and get
[1:23:26] the people off the word of God. Amen.
[1:23:29] And get them to go into a into the wrong
[1:23:31] direction. Amen. Praise God. But God
[1:23:35] knew that in 1963,
[1:23:39] there would be a coming. There would be
[1:23:42] an opening of the seventh seal. There
[1:23:45] would be a messenger on the earth to
[1:23:48] receive. There would be a son of man
[1:23:51] meeting with the son of man, the mighty
[1:23:53] angel coming down. That same one that
[1:23:56] John saw clothed with a white cloud.
[1:23:59] That same one appeared in 1963.
[1:24:03] Now,
[1:24:05] we can say all day long, it was the
[1:24:07] coming of the Lord.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; It was the coming of the Lord. But why
[1:24:11] is it that when we tell people about
[1:24:14] 1963 and about the cloud, that's why we
[1:24:17] wear the cloud? We don't wear this to
[1:24:19] say that we belong to some cult or some
[1:24:22] organization, some cloud organization.
[1:24:25] No, we recognize that this cloud was a
[1:24:29] significant event. It was a supernatural
[1:24:32] event that took place in 1963.
[1:24:35] It was the coming of the Lord.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; But let me tell you something. There's a
[1:24:40] lot of people that the Lord hasn't come
[1:24:41] to yet.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; The coming of the Lord back in 1963 was
[1:24:46] wonderful, but he has to come to you
[1:24:48] personal. Amen.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; It's not until the coming of the Lord
[1:24:52] becomes a personal experience with you
[1:24:55] on the opening of the word and and and
[1:24:58] recognizing the message for this hour
[1:25:00] that God sent a prophet that God opened
[1:25:03] those seals back in 63 and that there's
[1:25:06] now an open book that's in the hands of
[1:25:11] the of the of the actually it's now been
[1:25:13] given over to the church
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; to take the book. Hallelujah. Praise
[1:25:19] God. And so I don't want to get ahead,
[1:25:21] but here now we need to understand
[1:25:24] how it's important that it's not just to
[1:25:28] say that we saw a cloud in a newspaper
[1:25:31] article back in Life magazine.
[1:25:35] We need to understand what that cloud
[1:25:38] represented.
[1:25:40] We need to know why the clouds showed up
[1:25:44] in 1963
[1:25:47] and how there was an individual on the
[1:25:49] earth by the name of William Brham that
[1:25:52] was given visions and given uh
[1:25:55] instruction to go and and preach the
[1:25:58] opening of those seven seals. The
[1:26:01] opening of those seals unlocked a lot of
[1:26:04] the mysteries of what had already taken
[1:26:07] place throughout the seven church ages.
[1:26:11] The the the opening of the sixth seal
[1:26:13] that that opened up and there's many
[1:26:16] things that that were un unlocked
[1:26:19] through the mystery of the opening of
[1:26:21] that sixth seal. But it was a lot of it
[1:26:23] was history. Yes, the great tribulation
[1:26:26] is going to come, but it it opened up
[1:26:28] World War I, opened up World War II,
[1:26:31] opened up the the, you know, the dark
[1:26:33] ages and all the the the the wars and
[1:26:36] the rumors of wars and the and the and
[1:26:38] the pestilences and the and the and the
[1:26:40] earth, you know, uh having you know,
[1:26:43] shifting of the earth and floods and all
[1:26:45] these things and natural disasters on
[1:26:47] the earth. That's all under the sixth
[1:26:50] seal. It was all unveiled. All those
[1:26:53] mysteries were unveiled. But the seventh
[1:26:57] seal
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; is the one that that unveils the mystery
[1:27:00] of God.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; The mystery of how God himself is going
[1:27:06] to come into a a a church body
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; and and going to actually produce the
[1:27:13] rapture
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; for the next stage and for the
[1:27:16] completion of the rapture dispensation.
[1:27:19] Amen.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; The seventh seal is the element that
[1:27:23] that's why when when you know if Okay,
[1:27:26] let's read our next scripture here and
[1:27:28] then we'll get to it. We're going to
[1:27:29] wind down here slowly.
[1:27:32] Colossians chapter 1 verse 25- 27. It
[1:27:35] says, "Whereof
[1:27:37] I am made a minister
[1:27:40] according to the dispensation of God
[1:27:43] which is given to me for you to fulfill
[1:27:46] the word of God." Every minister that
[1:27:48] reads this scripture, when I read this
[1:27:51] scripture, I see myself as that
[1:27:53] minister.
[1:27:54] I see because because I've received the
[1:27:57] word and I recognize what the word is
[1:28:00] going to produce in this hour. And he
[1:28:02] says, I am made a minister according to
[1:28:04] the dispensation of God. And I'm in a
[1:28:07] rapture dispensation.
[1:28:10] The rapture is something that has always
[1:28:12] been of of of like intrigue in in in my
[1:28:16] life right from the very beginning when
[1:28:18] I came to this message. I couldn't get
[1:28:21] away from it because that's the portion
[1:28:24] of the word that I believe we fulfill.
[1:28:27] We're in that moment. We're in that
[1:28:29] time. And he says now, but he goes on.
[1:28:31] He says, "Even the mystery which hath
[1:28:34] been hid from ages and from generations,
[1:28:38] but is now made manifest to his saints."
[1:28:42] It's so now there's a word that's being
[1:28:45] revealed. There's a there's an unwritten
[1:28:48] part of the word of God because when the
[1:28:51] mighty angel came down, put his foot on
[1:28:53] the sea and on the land, he was
[1:28:55] suppressing some powers. He was
[1:28:58] suppressing some some powers that that
[1:29:00] that were controlling the churches and
[1:29:02] controlling the politics and and and and
[1:29:05] because he was now coming to say that
[1:29:09] time shall be no more and that there
[1:29:12] that seven thunders uttered their voices
[1:29:14] and even though John saw what was what
[1:29:17] was spoken because we know the thunders
[1:29:20] was the voice of God and even though
[1:29:23] John heard what was spoken he was told
[1:29:26] not to write it. So there was something
[1:29:29] that was spoken that was not for that
[1:29:32] particular time and we need to
[1:29:35] understand that that's where the
[1:29:37] dispensations come in. That's where the
[1:29:40] dispensational changes come in. That's
[1:29:43] where the dimensional connections come
[1:29:45] in where God who operates in the seventh
[1:29:49] dimension decides to come down clothed
[1:29:53] in a cloud takes on the sixth dimension
[1:29:56] of the angels. Brother Aram says that
[1:29:58] that that God made the angels his his
[1:30:02] way of becoming visible here into this
[1:30:05] dimension. And those and those angels
[1:30:09] they they represented God coming down to
[1:30:13] unveil and to open the word. It was God
[1:30:17] himself.
[1:30:20] God himself coming down to take
[1:30:23] possession of a people so that they
[1:30:27] could understand that that there'd be an
[1:30:30] age. Now it's made manifest to his
[1:30:32] saints to whom God would make known what
[1:30:35] is the riches of the glory of the
[1:30:38] mystery among the Gentiles.
[1:30:41] And look what he says. Which is Christ
[1:30:45] in you,
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; your hope of glory.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Let's read the next slide.
[1:30:53] God's provided place of worship. But he
[1:30:56] promised
[1:30:58] just before the coming of the end time,
[1:31:00] the world would get like it was in
[1:31:03] Sodom,
[1:31:05] where a man came down in human form,
[1:31:08] three of them, two angels, and God
[1:31:11] himself.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Now, how many understands that we're in
[1:31:15] the days of Sodom?
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; We're we're we're we're we're in a
[1:31:18] sodomite condition. Now, understand that
[1:31:21] we are talking now where brother
[1:31:22] Brandham now, here he is in 1965. the
[1:31:25] seals have been open. He knows that the
[1:31:28] seals are open. He knows what this that
[1:31:30] the book is now been open. He knows that
[1:31:33] the plan of redemption that the book is
[1:31:35] it's an open book. It's unveiling the
[1:31:37] mystery of God where God himself now is
[1:31:40] come down to take man and possess man
[1:31:44] and to become one with man. God and man
[1:31:46] becoming one. What he had in his mind
[1:31:48] from before the foundations of the
[1:31:50] world. Brother Brandham knew this was
[1:31:52] coming.
[1:31:53] He knew it was in progress.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; He understood the hour that he was
[1:31:57] living in. He saw the prophecy being
[1:32:00] fulfilled around him. And look what he
[1:32:02] goes on to say. He says, "And there was
[1:32:04] three of them, two angels and God
[1:32:06] himself." That was God. The Bible said
[1:32:09] it was. Now he came down and he
[1:32:11] manifested himself there by turning his
[1:32:14] back to the tent where Sarah was and
[1:32:17] told Abraham what Sarah was thinking in
[1:32:19] the tent.
[1:32:22] Listen, Abraham and Sarah is a perfect
[1:32:24] type of the bride and Jesus Christ.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Sarah was a part of Abraham.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. God had given Abraham a promise
[1:32:35] that she would bring forth a son. Amen.
[1:32:38] And it's just like the same promise that
[1:32:40] God's given you. We are God's Sarah in
[1:32:43] this hour. We're the one who says, "Be
[1:32:45] it unto me according to thy word." Amen.
[1:32:48] Because God went and visited Sarah.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; He went and actually visited Sarah and
[1:32:55] he told her and he came to her to to
[1:32:58] fulfill what he had promised he was
[1:33:00] going to do.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Just like he's come to you and to me in
[1:33:04] this day and in this hour to recognize
[1:33:06] that he is telling us exactly what he's
[1:33:09] going to do in this hour.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, uh, here, brother Brandham
[1:33:14] in his day, he realized the scripture
[1:33:17] that was being fulfilled around him. He
[1:33:20] knew, he even told us who those two
[1:33:22] angels were. It was Oral Roberts and
[1:33:24] Billy Graham. They were the ones like in
[1:33:27] the days of Lot. But who was with
[1:33:29] Abraham? There was one there by the name
[1:33:32] of Melzdc who had no father, no mother,
[1:33:36] had no beginning and no end. Who was
[1:33:39] that? Amen.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; That was God in human flesh that had
[1:33:43] come down to meet with Abraham to break
[1:33:46] bread and to drink milk. Hallelujah. God
[1:33:50] was in human flesh proving that he can
[1:33:54] come interdimensional anytime he wants.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. And that's
[1:34:00] what's promised to us. Amen. And so here
[1:34:02] he says Abraham what Sarah was thinking
[1:34:05] in the tent. That's right. Congregation
[1:34:07] says,
[1:34:09] Now Jesus himself said at that day when
[1:34:13] the son of man is being revealed in
[1:34:15] other words the son of man the ministry
[1:34:18] of Jesus Christ himself
[1:34:22] whenever he says son of man ministry
[1:34:26] it's Jesus Christ himself
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; and he is now moving into another son of
[1:34:33] man ministry
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; in bride form
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; in the bride
[1:34:39] to fulfill the next stage of the
[1:34:42] rapture.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And so we need to
[1:34:46] recognize and understand.
[1:34:49] Let's move on. Next slide. The church
[1:34:51] will come through justification, through
[1:34:54] Luther, through sanctification, through
[1:34:56] Wesley, through the baptism of the Holy
[1:34:59] Ghost or the Pentecostals and go right
[1:35:02] on into perfection of the Son of Man.
[1:35:06] Hallelujah. That's when husband and wife
[1:35:10] will be the same selfpersons.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; That's what he said. God will be so
[1:35:16] manifested in his bride, his church,
[1:35:20] till they will both be the same. They
[1:35:23] are one. Now you see where we're at.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Now you see. So, so you got to see that
[1:35:30] brother Brandham, he was the first
[1:35:33] fruits of the opening of that seventh
[1:35:36] seal
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; where the mighty angel himself would
[1:35:40] come down. What do you think when
[1:35:42] brother Brandham was saying that that
[1:35:44] that Abraham where the where the the the
[1:35:46] the the the angel came turned his back
[1:35:48] to Sarah and told Abraham what Sarah
[1:35:52] what what the promise that would happen
[1:35:54] to Sarah told her why did Sarah laugh
[1:35:58] was discerning the thoughts and intents
[1:36:00] of his heart. Did not William Brham
[1:36:02] stand on stages night after night and
[1:36:05] fulfill this very prophecy?
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; What was God doing? showing that he was
[1:36:11] now coming to fulfill the final stage of
[1:36:15] the word of God for our day. And he
[1:36:17] stood there and brother Brandham, it
[1:36:19] wasn't William Brandham that discerned
[1:36:21] those things. He could not he could not
[1:36:24] look into into their into their lives.
[1:36:27] It was the mighty angel himself. He
[1:36:30] says, "The angel is here right now. You
[1:36:32] know, I've been waiting on him."
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; He'd say, "I can't do nothing without
[1:36:36] him."
[1:36:37] And then he'd look to the lady and he
[1:36:39] says, "Now you know he's here, don't
[1:36:40] you?"
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Because he knew the presence. And all of
[1:36:43] a sudden, boom, he'd break into that
[1:36:46] other dimension. And he'd see what
[1:36:48] happened yesterday. He could look
[1:36:49] through time. He could see everything.
[1:36:51] And he'd tell them exactly what was on
[1:36:54] their hearts. What was he doing? It was
[1:36:56] the last sign of the Messiah. That that
[1:36:59] he was showing that he was come to the
[1:37:01] earth, that he was now a greater than
[1:37:03] Solomon was here. Who do you say this
[1:37:05] is?
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; A greater than Solomon is here present
[1:37:09] with the sons and daughters of God to
[1:37:11] fulfill his promised word for that day.
[1:37:15] And here we are now 70 years later over
[1:37:19] 70 years later. What do you think is
[1:37:21] promised to you?
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; What do you think is happening in your
[1:37:26] life? What was what what what what is it
[1:37:28] that that's called you? It's because you
[1:37:31] are a part of him.
[1:37:33] It's
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; because there's something in you now in
[1:37:36] this dispensation just like it was in
[1:37:38] William Brandham's day.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; There's a portion of the word now in you
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; that needs to come to life.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; That needs to express himself
[1:37:52] in the appointed time and season. Amen.
[1:37:56] Praise God. Forever more. And so
[1:38:00] I'm going to stop. I'm going to invite
[1:38:02] the musicians to come because next week
[1:38:04] we're going to finish
[1:38:07] and we're going to we're going to look
[1:38:08] at Revelations 10:es 1 to4
[1:38:13] and then verses 5-7
[1:38:16] and we're going to look at how the
[1:38:18] mighty angel descends
[1:38:21] and has come into this age into this
[1:38:24] hour into a a a time and a season of
[1:38:28] translation for the bride to receive
[1:38:31] Receive perfect faith for the change
[1:38:34] of dimension.
[1:38:36] We are in transition, saints. Everything
[1:38:40] will end with the seventh seal.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; Everything. We're going to read some
[1:38:46] quotes next week that tells us that
[1:38:48] everything completes upon that seventh
[1:38:52] seal because it is the mystery of God
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; being revealed
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; to the church
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; and to the world
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; and everything will will move on.
[1:39:04] Everything will continue. And our walk
[1:39:07] with God is only going to get greater
[1:39:11] and greater. There's going to be
[1:39:13] revelation that is going to come that is
[1:39:16] continuing to to move us line upon line,
[1:39:20] precept upon precept. We cannot stay the
[1:39:24] same. There's a word for us that that
[1:39:27] that God has prepared for us today that
[1:39:31] we need to manifest, that we need to
[1:39:33] receive, that we need to believe, that
[1:39:35] we need to make our existence.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. That's what we're
[1:39:41] looking for. We're looking for that
[1:39:43] great change. Amen.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. Father,
[1:39:51] we thank you this morning once again,
[1:39:53] Lord, for the word of God. that Lord we
[1:39:58] we realize that it takes your anointing
[1:40:00] and your spirit Lord to make it real to
[1:40:03] individual hearts and and to open the
[1:40:06] word in such a way where the hearts of
[1:40:08] the people oh God will will burn within
[1:40:11] them Lord it's a personal experience now
[1:40:15] Father like when you rose
[1:40:20] back from Calvary Lord and you made
[1:40:23] yourself known it was no longer a public
[1:40:25] ministry. It was a personal ministry,
[1:40:28] Lord, where you went one by one. You
[1:40:31] walked up to them while they walked on
[1:40:33] the road to Emmas. You made yourself
[1:40:35] known, personal. You made it real to
[1:40:38] them. You broke bread with them, Lord.
[1:40:41] You opened the word in such a way, Lord,
[1:40:44] that they realized who they were and the
[1:40:48] part that they were.
[1:40:50] Father, we're asking you to come and
[1:40:52] continue
[1:40:54] to unveil your word to each and every
[1:40:56] heart personal. Lord, as we move into
[1:40:59] the week that lays before us, there's
[1:41:01] many things that we must face the
[1:41:04] challenges of this life. Lord, won't you
[1:41:08] just let the reality of what was said
[1:41:10] here today that the Holy Ghost was given
[1:41:13] to us for that very purpose so that we
[1:41:15] could overcome those things. Help us to
[1:41:19] acknowledge you, Father, in every aspect
[1:41:21] of our lives. Draw us closer to you,
[1:41:24] Father. And let us know, Lord, greater
[1:41:27] is he that is within us than he that is
[1:41:31] in this world. We love you. We
[1:41:33] appreciate you. And we will never fail
[1:41:35] but to give you the glory in Jesus name.
[1:41:39] Amen.
[1:41:41] I'm ready to move.
[1:41:44] Amen. Ready to move. Ready to move.
[1:41:46] Glory to God.

[1:41:51] another dimension.
