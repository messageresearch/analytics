of time and the great holy spirit has not left us alone i'm still excited about this message and this glorious gospel that has been left in our hands by those who have gone before and we praise and honor and thank the lord for his grace and by his goodness tonight i want to bring to your attention some of the pictures that were taken in the nation of guyana and this is just uh simply last week i told and this this this week i'm going to show or show and tell all right so i trust the lord will bless your hearts because a picture speaks louder than words i can't show you all of them because they're maybe around over 200 and something or whatever but i i tried to collect as many as i could that pointed directly to our topic i just want to read one verse out of acts chapter 25 i believe it's verse 16. it says paul answering them after telling about his wonderful life to the king he said where upon o king agrippa i was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision i want to praise and thank god that i may be able to say that that through my life from boyhood to this time i have not been disobedient to the heavenly vision praise god i didn't see a light at midday but we saw a light around midnight right and we i give god praise honor and glory for that even today someone was remarking to me and saying did you know they're going to have celebrations for pentecost in guyana i said no i don't know and the thing about it they were remarking your name isn't mentioned well i said but why should they i said well did you realize that even what they're enjoying you are partially responsible for that also so we give god the glory this sunday will be pentecost sunday praise the lord it'll also be father's day so we want to talk about the things of the lord and trust the lord will bless us together let us just have a word of prayer over that little scripture and that topic and then we will go through these uh pictures which i know and believe you will enjoy and at the end of it whatever time that is 8 30 or whatever then you know we'll be finished if you want to give any comment or see anything that will be fine okay a gracious heavenly father we thank you so much for the privilege and the opportunity of going again into this land where a few seeds were sown and to return and to find a bountiful harvest oh god still coming in we pray that the holy spirit will bless us all together as we look at these pictures and tell of the goodness and of the grace of god we thank you for it father in jesus name amen and amen please be seated now these pictures are not in perfect order they just where they are and i'll just try to tell you what they are about right rather than um you know delay or put things in their places i couldn't do that that will take hours to put things together so if the if the is that ready now brother praise the lord then we'll take this light off so that it can show uh much better up there sorry you can take them all off up here no need to see me you know even those those are bright good that's good praise the lord okay all right i'll just talk from here and that should be fine we had just arrived coming into the airport and we were now just entering to the city of georgetown we were tired we were half asleep and half a week right and the brother was driving but anyway that's just using the um phone and taking a few pictures you can advance this is brother duncan king the chinese brother i told you about his family was converted under our uh well my ministry for the glory of god and most of them still believe one brother the eldest one lived in toronto worshiped at brother nelson and he has gone on to be with the lord alan and um we find one two sisters are as a result they are into pentecost and uh the other sisters at home and duncan is at home and they are still believing and pressing on he's a farmer and they came out of the city and moved out to where they can have the farm and do some farming and have a quieter life there praise the lord the brother just loves to do good and so he farms and uh one of the preachers were telling me that he he can't make hardly any profit because he keeps giving away the stuff and blessing widows and blessing orphans and blessing like that praise god all right he came the moment he heard that i was there by the next morning he was there right and we thank god for him it's a real blessing i always remind you that god used him to give me the church each book from which i teach every week and i've been doing so for so many years until it's falling apart but i thank god for him and may the lord richly bless him praise god okay just this street scene and you can see the houses how they're built differently than they are out here praise god just move on you're moving too quick what's happening now bang bang bang bang bang yeah okay there's a street scene again i'm doing that because you can see there's a building going up there that's just a steel framework you know that they're building there buildings are going up all the time all right uh advance okay uh we were go heading now towards a bridge to cross the demirara river and that river is one mile wide and there is a steel bridge across it um and it's a floating bridge they're now building a steel bridge like the one we have here across the river that's just started but now we're heading in that direction go ahead there it is it's one mile across and you get from one side to the other like that praise god part of the bridge of course is made so it can open and ships can pass but here it is we were crossing over going into the west coast next slide oh this is that's the four year of the hotel of the marriott hotel that just happened to be there we had just come in and i took a picture next praise the lord there he is and there she is next and there she is next just a few pictures of the inside of that hotel advance one at a time right one okay these are just little things just for you to see right next slide but you know who that is right or her face might be a little blurred but next this is the famous starbrook market built by the british since the 1800s and it still stands today it's still there and it is well known uh by those who are into history and literature and that sort of thing it's still there and of course people are doing business and taxi drivers and you know horns are blowing and people are calling and hawking their goods and stuff like that okay praise god next slide next slide okay we're we're just heading down these are new homes being built now they're building up all these homes people can buy them some of them the government is now giving all the young civil servants and professionals giving them a piece of land and a house and they can build it however they want to build it or change it or add to it but they're giving them a basic some of them a basic start right um that's what's you're looking at there right next slide okay street scene in the city take your time take your time don't rush go ahead next slide next one that's in the city go ahead next all right um we went to the church because we came in on a monday night we took tuesday uh we stayed brother king came and then in the evening or no not in the evening during the day we had lunch with brother maxwell lee's family together we had lunch together at their home and then for the wednesday night they normally would have a prayer meeting they have a prayer meeting and the whole church comes together for that prayer meeting praise the lord and so i attended that and was asked to say a few words i didn't preach but i greeted them and said a few words to them to encourage them to be back there on sunday by the grace of god next slide that's the inside of the church next next that's the pastor brotherly standing there praise god next slide next stop here i think we should have this here too a sign like this made up also we have that on the control but to be sure we should have something like that in the front there okay the people are very technological i'm surprised i was behind them when i went there the young people and and the ministers and stuff they are into their ipads until they're just you know and they're just texting away like crazy and stuff like that so they're well aware of that sort of thing right next slide hallelujah that was on the wall of the church so i took that picture and then this is continuing uh in that particular service thanks be to god this is the simon and uh beside her is brother maxi's uh wife or you're seeing her back but you'll see her later next there's brother maxey praise the lord now you must understand that his dad he was just a young boy a young man and grew up but his father is the one that received the message bailey was there and it took root in him since he's young and so when the father wanted him to take over the church that the father had which his brother is running that now he said no god didn't tell me to do that and the father said what why you're so young how could you be telling me but he did and the result is he's pastoring the present church that god helped him to raise up by his power and spirit amen next praise the lord hold on here now this brother is one that was there originally when i was there and i was glad to meet him because he's he's an original that was there along with brother hing brother greg samaru uh is his name greg samaru and i thank god for him hallelujah next one this is brother peter in guyana not the one you know up here but this is brother peter in guyana and they give him the name of son son son son they call him he is the son of brother mustafa muhammad who is the brother that that when myself and others shared books but i did the same thing here we walked the streets up at bruce deal and gave out books and tracks and stuff like that and some people throw them away they don't want it they don't want to receive it so this brother mohammed he found the book in the garbage but how do we know the story because myself and another brother who was working with him we went to his home together as this brother's friend just you know talked with him and while talking with him we thought we would start to witness to him about the message and he said may not believe nobody but prophet brahman so we are shocked now we go to witness to him and he's telling us how do you know about uh branham how do you know anything about him and then he told us the story how many you know i don't want to go into that parlance how he found this book in the garbage and how you read the book and he as a muslim didn't need nobody to convince him and look it's not easy for any you know that muhammadans don't walk away from their fate like that and when you see no man was there only god and he read that book out of the garbage can and was converted but he needed to be baptized and he knew it but he didn't know who he knew that could do it none of them around there would do it but here he comes in contact with us by the hand of god and he realized that's the supernatural operating there and we had a good time of hugging and laughter and fellowship and his wife went and you know you know how we do in the in the in the west indies or out east here in canada off goes the head of the chicken and there goes the curry in the pot and here goes the potatoes and everything and we had a fantastic meal and time of fellowship and rejoicing oh my so he came and introduced himself to me told me who he was the pastor confirmed it and praised god later on of course i have pictures of himself and his mother and there is now not just president brother must brother muhammad who passed on and his son there is a church there where that book was found in the garbage can praise god so that's one church okay let's move on this is the central assembly of god building of which i could have been pastor or superintendent for the country the person who's in charge there now was a schoolmate of mine and he is and has been for several years the superintendent over the country there praise god and there it is next slide next just so you see that uh how large and huge the the building is uh praise god let's move on next ah we're having uh in uh the the largest or one of the largest chinese restaurants uh in the country in the capital um and it's a beautiful place and this is not the it's one two about three floors and it's usually filled and it's usually the celebrities and the rich and the famous and the president and the vice president that goes to to eat there um as such right so we were blessed um they were so filled up downstairs that they gave us alone this room upstairs so we were blessed in that way praise god hallelujah next slide hold a minute now their sister lee brother maxwell lee's wife there is his mother-in-law that's the wife's mother uh sitting there and there's this beautiful lady sitting in the middle right next next slide there's the grandson brother lee's grandson uh he has uh uh four or five daughters one actually just before i left one gave birth it was her birthday and then she gave birth all right she's married and she's given birth but this is her son right so we thank god for that next this is the wife's sister his sister-in-law next and there is brother maxi lee you get a good frontal picture of him a very serious man i i guess he was he's the way i was like i have to say was because he's dead serious about the word um he'll joke with me but he's not a man that you know just fools around no he's serious about the word oh praise god hallelujah amen and by the way just so you know it's not just in guyana they're set for him to preach in south africa different parts of africa when i left he's gone to brazil and trinidad and you know england and ev everywhere as god would lead praise the lord but he remains very humble very simple ordinary praise god next slide okay i want you you're rushing this quickly take your time i want you to see him with the smile on his face because even his wife says bro maxis he hardly smiles he's always serious so here he is with a smile on his face thank god hallelujah and that's why she's smiling next slide there are his four not four daughters three daughters and the the other one that's not there but thank god for these amen the eldest one is the one beside my wife and next and then the youngest is there praise the lord next slide next i just threw these in so you have okay we are leaving now and you can see it's not a little restaurant because look the size of that bass it's all it's so high almost like over it feet right and it's huge sitting there uh in the foyer of the place the next slide welcome to neutral new thriving you can't see the full word chinese restaurant right okay next all right we're out on one of the streets there different isn't it it's different next and these are the houses they're building now because the the the money from oil and all that coming into the country and i can't show you all the pictures but as many many many that start going up the people are starting to try even in you know opportunities next okay i can't remember where this is but next slide okay i know where that is what it is now we were now heading out to visit brother um hing brother duncan hing because you see his sister elaine and sister simon went to school together and there were school friends together and so when preaching the gospel my wife got converted and she wants to come to here and see what this is all about and then she got converted and one the next brother and the next brother and so on got converted and the family got converted the mother went on just a year or two ago to be with the lord but we trust the lord for his great grace but we're heading out now you see how long the road is until it it's going up hills and valleys little valleys like that anyway but look how narrow right but that's what i'm talking about when i left there that was not even a pitched road those were just sandy roads that you just drive on it but they did that and now that they're able to do more they're looking now to widen all those things and and carry it as far out as possible next we're still going it's starting to rain that's why you see the foggy business okay we turned off the road to head to his farm and now this is way out in of the city in the countryside country and now we headed to his farm and all it is is a dirt road you don't expect to have pitch road going into your farms and stuff like that there next i'll show you how the road is winding we're going in and there he is on his farm right rather duncan he's all talked up praise god and he's busy trying to take my picture as i'm getting out of the van okay next that's the house that they are in he bought all the land and the house included so it's just him and his sister and the other sister had just gone back from canada to live now in guyana and so she is there with them uh next there he is the farmer right next and there are the two sisters elaine and pansy right and there is their sister simon beside them and those black containers you see there are you know they are set there to hold water and the water coming down creates its own pressure to be able to push it through your pipes and things within your house so that's what that is next okay that's just a scene of the some of the land you know the farm land that's there next we're going back out now praise god we're back in the city and the school children over there wear uniforms like the british do they wear uniforms so i was quickly passing i just took a shot of them as school was ended praise god next and there's a lot of supermarkets are springing up all over anyway next we had a second time i believe we went there but three times for the for the two weeks one with some of the ministers and this time we went out again on a sunday that's that's just the fourier of the restaurant right as you can see how big and deep it is and holds a lot of people and again we were blessed we were able to get our space easily next is brother lee with his usual face what's that well maybe he does right next praise god she's beautiful thank god isn't she i'm talking about sister lee [Laughter] all right okay next all right that's just going out of the foyer oh these are just scenery so you can see the buildings and how they were constructed in a lot of british style type of buildings but those this is the bridge again a lot of those british old buildings are now being torn down and people are encouraging them to keep some for history's sake you know very important now crossing that bridge again let's go i think here we may be going to s equivalent or something but anyway this is a one mile wide bridge this is um okay this is on the west coast you have to go through here first next we're going on to the ferry right the ferry is right ahead and we're going we're driving right into it next okay we are in it now with our vehicle now this is just part of the river and those is not that's not the other side those are huge islands where you have maybe a couple of thousand people are living on them right they're occupied they got buildings and everything on them right and farms and everything else next move on these are smaller craft smaller craft right um that um there can be fishermen they can be people transporting people up the river down the river things of that nature next okay we're out in the river and i told you before it's 22 miles wide right and these are islands occupied islands but we're just passing through them or beside them next that's another smaller ferry that's going to another area next okay we're near nearing the shoreline and i was kind of worried because this big ferry is going so close to the island i said it might go aground said no they already know that the channel the waters made the channel right there if you go out in the middle where it looks he said there's a lot of sand banks and things and the captain knows what he's doing so he brought the ship along there next this is just a scenery of inside so you understand it's big enough for several trucks and cars and vehicles next we're coming out of it we're now in s equivalent thanks okay along the way from the stilling to here um i mean removing these pictures but that maybe is a good i don't know trick quarter of an hour drive at this point we are thirsty and you know a little thirsty so we said we'd stop at this chinese supermarket that's there and so they went in to get some things and i just sat outside because remember um that's a warm country that's warm all the time so they don't have to make allowance for winter or anything like that praise god next slide this is just some of the things they're selling and they're not selling her but she's there thank god next okay we uh she's crossing the road to get a picture of this place next and you can see china supermarket right it's a big supermarket right next okay then we drive another hour up the coast from there and um this is the home of a believing couple right jenny and john and as i told you i call him big john right and we call her jenny brothers and sisters in christ believers of the gospel and going down part of the road it's not pitched and it's the same red dirt like you have in africa right and but on the inside what you see it's not concrete it's pure white sand there's a lot of that there on the ground pure white sand and when the rain falls that makes it settle down and becomes like concrete or it becomes packed on the ground right and we had lunch with them we fun with them uh if i might be descriptive we had roti we had some nice chicken barbecued and chicken curry and chana and we had pine and we had mangoes and we had a three finger drink it's a star fruit you know and oh it's everything was organic fresh and we really enjoyed it by the grace of god hallelujah amen next slide now i think i mentioned they would have to leave their house go out to the main road walk a long way to get to the next road that goes for four or five miles into the bush and that is usually dark because there is no lights and they would have to walk down that road all the way to get to this church right and by the grace of god you see next slide let me see what how the church has made uh it's just tin on some thin roof and some wooden things and slats around it and stuff like that they're thinking of now trying to build a church and i told them that we would like to help the best way that we can by the grace of god praise god next slide raise i'm in the middle of preaching now next slide this assignment took these pictures that you've seen here and because i couldn't be preaching and take those pictures from the back and all that next praise god hallelujah had a wonderful service there uh you know and god just blessed them and they were praising god and shouting and giving god the glory amen hallelujah next slide this is the first stop here this is part of the road and notices only the car light caused you to see the road you can look and see it's pitch black right pitch you don't know what you're stepping on you don't know what could spring out the bushes whatever it's there but this is highly unlikely because the animals and things they keep away where they know human beings are maybe if you're walking alone in the quietness of late in the night nobody else is around then you may have a problem but usually they're not there but i want you to see the conditions and what it is what believers are daring and doing by faith to be able to worship and praise god hallelujah and and and we we complain a little bit about the rain we complain a little bit of snow we come and we have a car that we're driving it's not you walking through you're driving through the snow heated on the inside cooled in the summer and everything else and these people are walking praise god like you know while he was taking us in some work men usually walk that four or five miles which is to people who are in those conditions that's nothing because when i was in the sudan people walk for two weeks to get to the meeting and it wasn't 10 or 100 people it was like 3 000 people right so so you can understand the mindset um they're built to survive there right you are built to survive hair you understand this system you understand that you understand what to do now if they just come like that when they immediately come they don't understand it and then they will be confused and disoriented and don't know how to get on a bus how to use a token what is a token and all this and after a while they'll pick it up and they'll start to survive too but same way with you if you're to go there you're gonna have to ask questions and things and things like that so you know how to protect yourself and survive right so there's the road but that's that's just a smooth part of it next slide okay you start seeing what's going on there and you can't really fully see it because you understand that vehicle is rocking it's going you know and it's no use you're saying on a dodge pothole because they are everywhere on on that road right amen next okay we are now at the camp that the brother the church is like two and a half miles in about let's say two miles and this camp is about four or five miles in next next slide it's got water tanks there for for water and those things are called water coconuts and next slide sister simon and i just drank these and then he split them open and got some spoons i wouldn't explain about cutting off the end and getting a piece and then scooping it out and whatnot but we at the white flesh you saw there it's soft and the water and that it's not water it's not just water it's sweet right because they pick it right off the tree and brought it to us nice i know you're feeling thirsty now that i'm talking next slide praise god there's the brother and there's the sister and there are two brothers that live right across from the church they live there on the farm there and the other one works cutting wood to make um coal right and so they keep an eye on the church and i mean the camp because one building in there is a little church building but it can no more hold when all the people go call people coming from trinidad people are coming from suriname people are coming from brazil people come from america um different parts of america and go down there and um you know participate praise the lord next praise god airmen join my coconut that's part of the yard there's a good scene you get an idea next there's a little building that they first built as a small church building but of course it's still there but they've outgrown it when you know the whole camp is filled and young people are tents are pegged there all around the place they usually tense and stuff of course brothers are there to patrol in the night and that sort of thing amen next this is a coconut tree that one i can climb you know why i say that because the real ones are way up next what next behind this assignment as you can see is a huge lake now that is what the scientists from all over the world germany britain different it's called a hot and cold lake and half of the lake is hot and you go in the next half and it's cold or your brother said you can be standing in the lake and the water is warm and nice and then all of a sudden freezing cold water right so the mystery of that is what the scientists are looking at but god give the young give i call him young man he's not a young man with grandson but vision and before the government could come to itself he bought up some of the land on the shores of that lake when nobody would hardly go there now they're encouraging tourists to go there and they are hurrying now to see if they can build a road to go there right like that so we thank god that he's a man not only preaching the gospel but thinking right greatly influenced by brother dionna raine ojar because he moved a lot with him uh when he was as a young young boy praise god next raise the lord the same is of the camp but you've seen the extent of the how big it is how much land surrounding it next there he is got a full picture of him and the sister next praise god we're fixing to leave now he says that vehicle that red one he has two of them that one is like an all-terrain vehicle the tires are made for you know the bush and stuff like that so he would not go in there with the with a real good vehicle because you know next oh we're back on the ferry again see i i left that picture of the truck so you can understand it's not a little boat it holds several of those and cars in it to cross over so little you or me being on it it's not much weight and then there's another upper floor with the canteen and chairs and stuff up there um for viewing next we're leaving back to we're still in lesser quibble but we're headed back all right we come over on the other side and we're coming off the ship that that's the front of the ship just goes like that right and hits the pier and then the cars are able to drive off so here we go next back to those locals making their living fishing transportation whatever else you know that's a that's the that's the ferry right there far away from it though now we are outside back on the street from the ferry and people of course got their wares everywhere trying to sell and hawk and call you and i have a cheaper and no my stuff is better quality and one right next oh the bank of nova scotia oh when i saw that as bank of nova scotia and the country spice kitchen oh my another restaurant there local next and that's the guyana bank republic bank they call it anyway next this that is in um the city called parika and i had preached there when i was like 18 years old and had a an indian family were converted and we were having meetings in there not many people maybe about five or ten and then afterwards i left and i never knew what happened but there's a church there now by the grace of god and next slide brother lee sitting there next slide and there is the pastor brother kusinat kusi not i should say but praise the lord next slide amen a real understanding of the message too not just preaching but he understands what i have been preaching what i understand they caught that same spirit amen and um if i might pause here a bit right look how time flies that um i always wondered why when there was a revival mini revival going on while i was there that lord will pick me up like philip and move move you in the middle but this brother max he didn't know he was explaining that to me but he was just talking and saying but brother you know it's so strange that when after you left most of those original brothers that were there they also left i didn't know that but they all left and the ones that didn't leave he said they all died so they were left with nobody to tell them anything and they got to go directly to god and the holy spirit and the bible and the message so what they have is not from me it's not from you it's not from anybody it's from the holy ghost amen but they're saying the same thing i have been preaching here even though we have not had contact whatsoever praise god hallelujah next is the pastor's wife there now he he has this he has this uh place that he's running and it's a lot of employees in there and stuff like that you know we praise god we're this uh this place is not his but this is a very wealthy man that put all his wealth in his hands like joseph and close his eyes he don't even worry and let him run it as a matter of fact that man allowed them give them permission build the church do whatever you want and that's what it is so but he is actually the boss there for everything that goes on all the trucking all of this all of that anyway praise the lord next oh we are back that's all seen in the hotel that's just a hotel kitchen next that's a scene from the hotel's window looking down you've got to pass the guard house that little blue circular building the security guards there and you can't even come to the hotel unless you go by them and the reason for that is also the there are a lot of conferences going on i met some canadians from bc that were having a conference there because of you know all the money that's coming in now everybody wants a piece of it so and the president is always there meeting delegates the vice president is always there me so there's always secret service there's policemen there's always uh there you might not be aware of it but they're always there day and night amen and that's why i actually chose that hotel to be honest because i'm going back the first time i don't know the conditions yet so i said let me go it might be a little bit expensive but let me go and use that and after i see how things are then i'll know how to really conduct myself but i don't want to you know i want her protected i don't want to endanger her in any way right okay this is a few government buildings nearby the hotel we took the pictures off with the river in the background praise the lord you understand me now brother anthony when i went to trinidad and and brother kedar says uh now we're gonna go up the river so i said where's the river because you know the river is not even the size of one of the creeks right right okay this is a mall and this is just the what's called food court in the mall built by you know trinidadians for rich guyanese who have the money to be able to do those things but they brought in trinidadian engineers and builders and this is just a food court now here is some of the local food next slide just hold that a bit there long enough until you feel your mouth dribbling one is duck and one is lamb mutton as you could see there look it's right in the front and chicken and so on there's different things there all right next take it easy take it easy okay i want you to see the size of the food court so you understand it's not just a little thing it's not as big as what we have but for them that is huge next back to church and um i believe this is now i know the last sunday last sunday we're having a service this young man i can't we can't bring him up closer but he is the son of a lady i knew that never married till she's about you know i would say he was about 50 years old and met one of the brothers there and he had a school on himself and she had her school in another part of the country but anyway they met and stuff like that but i was able to meet him and be introduced to him next just to show you just hold a minute this is outside of the church right this group of people you're seeing here this is outside of the church they're not inside of the building they had to make like a shed above their outside to be able to hold the people this young man that's sitting in the front he is the son of one of the original sisters portuguese sisters on was a convert too um and he was introduced to me and i praised god for that that she's gone to be the lord but gone believe in the promised word of this hour and we give god praise honor and glory next praise the lord and this is the end of it so there you go god bless you all praise the lord thank you very much for your patience in watching uh those and i trust this gives you gives you some idea of some of the society and you'll have to go there and flavor the culture yourself but i would like to encourage those of you who can to make a a trip there not just for the just the fun of it but i believe those brethren have a lot to offer spiritually with their understanding because very hard for to meet other people with this kind of understanding and depth because uh he said oh a certain brother was wondering how come you know you you know you weren't talking with him like you're talking with me i said no because he does not have the level of understanding that you have see i could talk to you and i don't have to hesitate and wonder because you're right there you understand you're seeing the words and not only that the penetration of the word to the people when you hear the people and now seeing and talking there and you realize my goodness he has been doing that for a while and it's soaked in on the people and i give god praise and honor for that praise the lord hallelujah it's quarter to ten accord tonight no i'm just getting you scared praise god god bless you all let's uh just have a word of prayer and brother may may be able to come back up and lead a song and then we can go our way and come back on sunday amen hallelujah let's come back on sunday and come believing go rejoicing as we go back into preaching the word praise the lord and i miss that of course preaching the word of god god bless you real good hallelujah glory to his marvelous wonderful name our gracious heavenly father we thank you for this opportunity of being able to speak to your wife your bride and to declare to her these things father that the seeds of the messes that were planted in the ground have woke up grown up and now the time of harvest and to see the churches
