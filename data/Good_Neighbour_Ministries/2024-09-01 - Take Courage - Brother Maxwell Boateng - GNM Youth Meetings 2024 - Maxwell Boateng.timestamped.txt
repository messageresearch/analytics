[1:02:09] take courage amen take courage amen as
[1:02:12] you read in the scripture amen is is a
[1:02:15] scene amen is a par to the journey the
[1:02:18] children of Israel amen and and the
[1:02:20] children of Israel had come to a point
[1:02:21] in their Journey where there was there
[1:02:23] was something happening amen and and and
[1:02:25] what was happening was that there was
[1:02:27] being a transfer of authority amen
[1:02:30] Authority was being transferred at this
[1:02:33] moment of the Journey of the children of
[1:02:35] Israel amen responsibility was being
[1:02:38] transferred at this moment of the
[1:02:40] Journey of the children of Israel amen
[1:02:43] Jehovah was going to take another vessel
[1:02:45] to continue on his work now this did not
[1:02:49] mean that all the work that Jehovah had
[1:02:51] done in Moses was had to be discredited
[1:02:54] are you with me amen the work that the
[1:02:56] Lord had done in Moses was not to be
[1:02:58] discredited but God was just going to
[1:03:00] take another vessel and continueing the
[1:03:02] same work amen so he was just passing
[1:03:06] the authority from Joshua's hand into
[1:03:09] the hand from Moses hands into the hands
[1:03:12] of Joshua that someone else was going to
[1:03:14] take this baton and was going to
[1:03:16] continue to run the rest amen what he
[1:03:19] was saying that it is not over with
[1:03:21] Moses amen but as Moses is going to step
[1:03:24] off the scene someone is going to carry
[1:03:27] on with the work of Moses amen are you
[1:03:30] with me so he was saying listen this is
[1:03:32] not over yet amen there there is more to
[1:03:35] come amen and there is more that I want
[1:03:37] to do with you but but there was
[1:03:39] something that he told Joshua amen is
[1:03:41] said Joshua you're going to prosper
[1:03:44] you're going to go ahead and you're
[1:03:45] going to take the land and you're going
[1:03:46] to do all this but there are certain
[1:03:48] things that are very key as you go on to
[1:03:51] continue in your position of authority
[1:03:53] and he told Joshua as you go on
[1:03:56] one thing I want you the few things I
[1:03:57] want you to keep and and he started to
[1:03:59] list them down and he said one thing
[1:04:01] Joshua I want you to do is observe all
[1:04:04] the law which Moses commanded you as you
[1:04:07] go forth observe all the law that Moses
[1:04:10] commanded you and he said don't turn
[1:04:13] from it to the left or to the right amen
[1:04:17] and again he said to him you know don't
[1:04:20] let this message that Moses had brought
[1:04:22] to you depart from d amen and he said
[1:04:26] now meditate upon it day and night amen
[1:04:32] so so these are Commandments that the
[1:04:34] Lord has given Joshua as he's passing
[1:04:36] the authority to him to say now that you
[1:04:39] are going forward meditate upon the word
[1:04:42] amen now that you going forward don't
[1:04:44] let the word that Moses has brought to
[1:04:46] you depart amen now that you are going
[1:04:48] forward observe these Commandments that
[1:04:51] has been given to you by the Lord amen
[1:04:55] and and and as you do these things stand
[1:04:58] strong amen as you do these things don't
[1:05:01] be discouraged stand strong be
[1:05:03] courageous actually he said be very
[1:05:06] courageous amen be very courageous amen
[1:05:09] be very courageous Don't Be Afraid don't
[1:05:12] be dismayed why because the Lord your
[1:05:14] God is going to be with you amen he was
[1:05:18] telling them as was with Moses I am
[1:05:21] going to be with you so don't be
[1:05:23] discouraged don't be afraid
[1:05:26] no matter what comes your way don't back
[1:05:28] down but take courage amen take courage
[1:05:32] because the same God that was with Moses
[1:05:35] is going to be with you amen be strong
[1:05:39] amen Never Back Down don't be afraid of
[1:05:41] anything that the enemy tried to bring
[1:05:43] to you just be courageous be because God
[1:05:47] is with you amen the god of the prophet
[1:05:49] of this age he's saying is going to be
[1:05:52] with you so don't be afraid young person
[1:05:55] no no matter what whether you were in
[1:05:56] school whether you at work wherever you
[1:05:58] are at he's saying don't be afraid
[1:06:00] because the God of Wars with Moses is
[1:06:03] going to be with you no wonder in the
[1:06:06] scriptures you know Psalm chapter 1 to
[1:06:08] verse 8 David will speak and he said if
[1:06:11] I Ascend into heaven Thou Art there if I
[1:06:15] make my bed in hell behold thou are
[1:06:18] there so David is catching a revelation
[1:06:21] to say listen no matter where I go the
[1:06:23] Lord is going to be with me amen no
[1:06:26] matter what situation or your man the
[1:06:28] Lord is going to be with me let me say
[1:06:30] to you a young person you're going to
[1:06:31] live this place you're still going to be
[1:06:33] facing battles you're going to live this
[1:06:35] place and the enemy is going to try all
[1:06:37] he can listen the battle is not over
[1:06:39] yesterday we came and and the Lord
[1:06:42] showed us how we're going to be able to
[1:06:44] face this battle and overcome the enemy
[1:06:46] but this doesn't mean that he not going
[1:06:48] to come against you amen you know the
[1:06:51] scripture will tell us that you know he
[1:06:53] he will encamp against you he will come
[1:06:54] against you but he can actually battle
[1:06:56] against he can't overcome you so as you
[1:06:58] live in this place the battle will
[1:07:00] continue there will be days that you
[1:07:01] will be in a valley amen there will be
[1:07:04] days that you feel like you are in a
[1:07:05] valley but don't you worry because in
[1:07:07] that Valley the Lord is still with you
[1:07:10] because if the Lord can descend all the
[1:07:12] way to hell and even there in Hell David
[1:07:14] is saying you will not live me then I
[1:07:17] tell you when you are in the valley of
[1:07:18] Life the Lord is still with you amen if
[1:07:21] you're on a mountain top the Lord is
[1:07:23] still with you if you're in a trial the
[1:07:26] Lord is still with you if you're in a
[1:07:28] battle the Lord is still with you the
[1:07:30] Lord is never going to leave you neither
[1:07:32] is he ever going to forsake you amen no
[1:07:35] matter where you're at as he was with
[1:07:38] Moses so is he going to be with you so
[1:07:41] take courage young person no matter what
[1:07:43] the situation is remember the Lord is
[1:07:46] with me amen the Lord is with me brother
[1:07:51] Brandon will say God keeps his word and
[1:07:52] said the Lord thy God is with thee where
[1:07:56] wherever they goes is said no matter
[1:07:58] what it is how hard it is how great the
[1:08:01] obstacle is that doesn't matter if it's
[1:08:04] then through the valley of the shadow of
[1:08:05] death the Lord thy God is with thee
[1:08:08] whether soever thou goest amen wherever
[1:08:13] you go the Lord is with you now now you
[1:08:15] know we we we know very well the story
[1:08:17] that we reading about and and we know
[1:08:19] the journey that we've been through and
[1:08:21] and how you know Moses you know had a
[1:08:24] burning bush experience
[1:08:26] amen Moses Moses had a burning bush
[1:08:29] experience and after that burning bush
[1:08:31] experience he he went forth to Egypt to
[1:08:34] deliver God's people amen he went forth
[1:08:37] to deliver God's people to bring them
[1:08:38] out of the bondage that they were in
[1:08:41] Amen to bring the m and move them on to
[1:08:43] the promised land that was that was
[1:08:45] given to them now now we know this this
[1:08:48] might seem you know maybe you know some
[1:08:50] sometimes young people feel that it's
[1:08:51] hard but it's not hard amen now the
[1:08:53] ministry of Moses amen the ministry of
[1:08:56] Moses is a type of the ministry of the
[1:08:58] prophet of this age are you with me
[1:09:01] young
[1:09:02] people the prophet of this age came to
[1:09:05] bring you out of your bondage not him
[1:09:07] but the message he brought came to bring
[1:09:10] you out of the bondage that you were in
[1:09:12] amen maybe you say well I was born in a
[1:09:14] believer's home okay amen but your
[1:09:17] parents might have been in a
[1:09:18] denomination or or might have been
[1:09:20] somewhere in the world or whatever it is
[1:09:22] but there was a message that brought the
[1:09:24] made from where they where amen now
[1:09:26] remember on the journey childr were born
[1:09:28] and they were born in other words in the
[1:09:30] message amen but before they came on the
[1:09:33] scene there were some people that were
[1:09:35] brought out from the bondage of the
[1:09:37] world Amen so so the prophet the message
[1:09:40] of the hour came to call out a broad
[1:09:43] amen and as he called out the broad and
[1:09:45] called out your parents and you were
[1:09:46] born in that family listen God had it
[1:09:49] all planned it that you will be born in
[1:09:51] that family but will talk about one in a
[1:09:53] million listen there were many that
[1:09:55] could have showed up but you showed up
[1:09:58] amen you showed up amen because you were
[1:10:01] part of the program of God Amen you
[1:10:04] young people are part of the program of
[1:10:06] God and so you know in this journey as
[1:10:09] your parents were delivered from the
[1:10:11] bondage so have you also been delivered
[1:10:13] amen and has been brought out and is on
[1:10:15] this journey and we know that brother
[1:10:17] brandham not only did he fulfill the
[1:10:19] Moses commission but he also fulfilled
[1:10:21] the Joshua Commission in that he brought
[1:10:23] us also into the land of promise amen so
[1:10:27] so as Moses brought the mid and at a
[1:10:29] certain point the authority changed and
[1:10:31] Joshua carried them on into the land now
[1:10:33] you've learned this in Sunday school
[1:10:35] have you know young people right so so
[1:10:37] so as he carried them on into now this
[1:10:40] promised land was Joshua doing and the
[1:10:42] prophet did the same now the prophet
[1:10:44] brought us into the land and then he
[1:10:46] told us now the Joshua that is going to
[1:10:49] lead you is going to be the Holy Ghost
[1:10:52] amen now it's going to be the Holy Ghost
[1:10:54] young people that is saying is going to
[1:10:56] lead you to possess every portion of the
[1:10:59] land that you are in are you with me
[1:11:02] young people all right so so the prophet
[1:11:04] brings a message it brings out your
[1:11:06] parents you're part of it amen and now
[1:11:09] you were growing and you come to a place
[1:11:11] that you understand oh there is a land
[1:11:13] that we're going to amen you understand
[1:11:16] there is a land that we're going to and
[1:11:17] in this land there are lots of
[1:11:19] promises and the Lord is saying this
[1:11:22] promises is not only for your parents
[1:11:24] you can have them too listen when they
[1:11:26] got into the land it wasn't only the
[1:11:27] parents eating the
[1:11:29] grapes you understand it wasn't just the
[1:11:32] PE parents you know having the noise
[1:11:34] honey the kids were having it too they
[1:11:37] were eating of the land of the fruit of
[1:11:39] the land amen it was their possession
[1:11:41] amen now we know that Joshua was a type
[1:11:44] of the natural amen I just want to lay
[1:11:46] some Foundation just so so we all on the
[1:11:48] same page and and then we keep we start
[1:11:50] moving on Amen but you see when when
[1:11:52] they got in the land amen and we know
[1:11:54] that Israel was was a type of the
[1:11:56] natural amen and so Israel as a type of
[1:11:59] the natural they get into this land and
[1:12:02] they had a promise of a natural land
[1:12:05] amen and this land was promised to them
[1:12:07] by their father Abraham that one day
[1:12:09] they were going to you know be in
[1:12:10] bondage but delivered and be moved into
[1:12:13] a land that flowed with milk and honey
[1:12:16] right and so all this is happening but
[1:12:18] this was in the natural and we know that
[1:12:20] the natural always will Tye something in
[1:12:22] the spiritual amen so just ask they were
[1:12:25] the Seed of Abraham in the natural so
[1:12:28] are you the Seed of Abraham in the
[1:12:31] spiritual amen now now just listen to
[1:12:33] the scripture here in Galatians
[1:12:34] Galatians chapter 3:29 says and if ye
[1:12:37] aboid if ye be in Christ ye are then ye
[1:12:41] are then are ye Abraham's seed and hairs
[1:12:45] according to the promise amen so if you
[1:12:48] aboid in Christ amen if you've received
[1:12:50] the baptism of the Holy Ghost then you
[1:12:52] are also a Seed of Abraham and HS to the
[1:12:55] promise amen now we know that a promise
[1:12:57] that we are Airs of is also a land that
[1:13:00] we'll get to one day amen that that is
[1:13:02] that is you know when we get raptured
[1:13:04] but while we are here there is also a
[1:13:06] promise given to us in this land that we
[1:13:09] in and the promise is the word of God
[1:13:12] Amen the promised land that we have
[1:13:14] today as young people that we can go and
[1:13:17] eat anything in it and take whatever we
[1:13:19] want from it is the word of God we can
[1:13:22] take that word of God and whatever we
[1:13:24] have need of we can believe it and
[1:13:26] receive it amen that is the promised
[1:13:28] land that now we have received amen so
[1:13:32] are you all with me up until now amen
[1:13:34] we're just laying down some few
[1:13:36] foundations amen so in the word of God
[1:13:38] we will find Salvation amen and so as a
[1:13:41] young person as you growing up you begin
[1:13:43] to learn in the word of God oh I can be
[1:13:45] saved amen and so what do you do you say

[1:14:00] all these things and you taking all
[1:14:02] these what you were eaten the fruits of
[1:14:04] the land then you get sick then you hear
[1:14:06] oh so I can be healed because the
[1:14:08] scripture said boy his St some more
[1:14:10] healed and so you can take that promise
[1:14:12] now in that land and believe it and
[1:14:14] it'll manifest in your life as a young
[1:14:15] person amen are you with me to say it
[1:14:18] this morning amen you you can have
[1:14:20] Deliverance you can have whatever you
[1:14:21] need but there was something that
[1:14:25] was intered in this land listen God has
[1:14:28] given them the land he said here it is
[1:14:30] you go take it whatever you want you
[1:14:32] take it but they had to
[1:14:35] fight for every inch of
[1:14:39] gr that they
[1:14:42] wanted you see young person you're going
[1:14:45] to have to fight for every inch of
[1:14:47] ground amen every inch of ground just as
[1:14:50] they fought so are we going to fight

[1:14:53] turn up God's just as obligated to keep
[1:14:57] to to his word to heal you as he is to
[1:15:00] save you is that it's this word that
[1:15:03] promised it it's God's word and we have
[1:15:06] no right to take away from it but just
[1:15:09] say it's the truth believe it no matter
[1:15:12] what happens believe it anyhow that's
[1:15:14] the way the rest of them had to believe
[1:15:16] it and we are not excl excluded from
[1:15:19] that God gave Palestine to Israel but
[1:15:21] they had to fight for every inch of
[1:15:23] ground they got the promise is yours but
[1:15:26] you have to void for every inch to claim
[1:15:28] it the devil will see to that certainly
[1:15:32] he will so the devil is going to try all
[1:15:35] he can to stop you from taking your
[1:15:37] promise but it is yours and that is what
[1:15:40] you need to catch here you need to catch
[1:15:42] that this is mine you know when I was a
[1:15:45] kid you know I love cars you know and so
[1:15:48] I'll have these little cars and you know

[1:15:54] you go and you playing with your cars
[1:15:55] and you know there's always that word
[1:15:57] guy among your friends right that he
[1:15:59] always want to play with your toys and

[1:16:04] toy and he's trying to take it away and
[1:16:06] you're like no I'm not going to give it
[1:16:07] to you and the fight begins and no this

[1:16:13] was to show up he was going to get okay
[1:16:15] listen this is your toy so you have it
[1:16:19] this is yours and so you have it so so
[1:16:21] the battle is Raging with fighting amen
[1:16:24] but ddy come and he said but but wait a
[1:16:26] minute listen devil this is for him so
[1:16:29] you you live it live it alone so that is
[1:16:31] the same thing here there are promises
[1:16:33] in the word you will take but it's a
[1:16:35] battle the enemy is trying to say no
[1:16:37] it's not yours but the scripture said it
[1:16:39] is yours Daddy bought for you listen
[1:16:42] that bicycle is mine daddy bought is M
[1:16:44] bicycle you can't have M

[1:16:52] and I am taking it amen I am taking it
[1:16:54] because it is mine so every promise in
[1:16:57] the book Is Ours but the devil is going
[1:17:00] to try all he can to try to keep us from
[1:17:02] us the promise of Deliverance is ours
[1:17:05] the promise of Freedom Is Ours but the
[1:17:07] enemy is going to do all he can to try
[1:17:09] to keep us away from the freedom and the
[1:17:11] Deliverance listen yesterday I believe
[1:17:13] that the Lord came by your way
[1:17:15] ministered to us delivered Hearts set
[1:17:17] free filled with the Holy Ghost but

[1:17:21] enemy is going to come and try to steal
[1:17:22] that away from you try to bind you again
[1:17:25] in the same change that you were in
[1:17:27] before you came to the meetings but I'm
[1:17:29] here to tell you take courage young
[1:17:30] person because the Lord your God is with
[1:17:33] you and this is a promise that God has
[1:17:36] given to you and you don't need to back
[1:17:37] down from it amen you don't need to back
[1:17:41] away from it because God has paid the
[1:17:43] price and has given it to you and when
[1:17:45] the enemy come you have every right of
[1:17:47] say to say this is mine this is mine
[1:17:50] property and you have no right to pull
[1:17:53] it away from me are you with me this
[1:17:55] morning amen you have every right to
[1:17:57] take it away from the enemy brother BR
[1:17:59] must say when it comes to Healing he
[1:18:01] said your healing remains as long as you
[1:18:03] believe it he said it's just as the same
[1:18:06] as your salvation as long as you believe
[1:18:08] you're saved you are saved amen so your
[1:18:12] salvation is as long as you believed and
[1:18:14] if you're healing as well as as long as
[1:18:16] you believe then I believe your
[1:18:18] deliverance is also as well as long as
[1:18:21] you believe so if you believe that you
[1:18:23] delivered and you keep holding on it it
[1:18:25] it is going to last forever if you
[1:18:27] believe that you're free and you hold on
[1:18:29] it it's going to last forever amen
[1:18:31] because now no one can talk you out of
[1:18:33] your salvation are you with me no one
[1:18:36] can talk you out of your salvation no
[1:18:38] one can say that you are not saved you
[1:18:40] know that you are saved because it's a
[1:18:42] revelation to you so you can take your
[1:18:44] deliverance and believe it the same way
[1:18:47] that I know that I am delivered because
[1:18:50] the word said so
[1:18:55] amen and you don't need to back away
[1:18:57] from it
[1:18:59] amen just as much as you believe
[1:19:01] yourself you can believe you have the
[1:19:03] Holy Ghost and the enemy can say
[1:19:04] anything the better it you can believe
[1:19:06] you're free and the enemy can do
[1:19:07] anything better it because once it
[1:19:10] become a revelation that's why brother
[1:19:11] Brandon was saying the church age it is
[1:19:13] so important that Revelation is so
[1:19:16] important because that's what Satan can
[1:19:18] battle against amen so once you believe
[1:19:22] it the enemy can't battle against it
[1:19:24] amen
[1:19:25] man but there is where the F comes in
[1:19:28] but you know what the scripture does
[1:19:30] tell us that we'll have to F for every
[1:19:32] inch of
[1:19:33] ground but you know the amazing part of
[1:19:35] it
[1:19:36] this is that you and not the one doing
[1:19:38] the F
[1:19:40] it you know many times when we hear
[1:19:42] about it we need to fight for every inch
[1:19:44] of ground we misinterpret it and we
[1:19:47] think that I have to fight but the
[1:19:50] battle is not yours the battle is the
[1:19:53] Lord's
[1:19:55] and I want you to cast this young people
[1:19:57] because Satan wants you to
[1:20:01] fight he wants you to fight he wants you
[1:20:05] to get in a wrestling match with him
[1:20:08] because he know so far as it is you he
[1:20:10] can defeat
[1:20:14] you but the battle is not
[1:20:16] yours the battle is the
[1:20:19] Lord he is the one that is here to fight
[1:20:22] for you
[1:20:25] so when Satan is coming trying to get
[1:20:27] you Deo you know in the middle of the
[1:20:30] anoint and he comes in your room and
[1:20:32] trying to pull your thoughts into
[1:20:33] certain things that not supposed to go
[1:20:35] into now you can try to F that and be
[1:20:37] like no I'm not going to do this you
[1:20:38] know man I tell you I'm not going to do
[1:20:40] this I'm going to pull my phone away man
[1:20:42] tell you and you can go I'm going to put
[1:20:44] my phone in the I'm going to put it in
[1:20:45] the in the sitting room and I'm going to
[1:20:47] go in the bedroom and you trying to f
[1:20:50] yourself and the enem is just there and
[1:20:52] they just keep keep pondering and you're
[1:20:54] like
[1:20:55] man you
[1:20:57] know no maybe I just watch this little T
[1:21:01] you see you were fighting
[1:21:03] it but if you if you just came and you
[1:21:05] said to him listen devil I am free
[1:21:08] because God told me I am free the
[1:21:11] scripture says that he that the soon set
[1:21:13] free is free indeed I know you believe
[1:21:15] it or am free so you just walk away
[1:21:17] listen he's just going to be okay sorry
[1:21:19] he just going to walk because he said
[1:21:21] resist the devil and he shall flee
[1:21:26] so when he comes and you begin to resist
[1:21:28] him with the word according to the
[1:21:30] scripture he has to
[1:21:34] flee it's just as simple as that you see
[1:21:38] the enemy is trying to complicate the
[1:21:39] word and complicate every it is not
[1:21:42] complicated it is just that simple you
[1:21:44] just take that one word that one stone
[1:21:47] is good enough he has to flee because
[1:21:49] the word says
[1:21:52] so are you with me young people so take
[1:21:54] take courage as you living take courage
[1:21:58] take that word and rap the devil like
[1:22:00] never
[1:22:01] before
[1:22:04] amen as I'm saying the battle is not
[1:22:06] yours but the battle is the Lord's you
[1:22:08] see one time the the children of Israel
[1:22:10] you know they were devoided there was
[1:22:11] Judah and Israel and so Judah was was
[1:22:14] under it came a point where King
[1:22:16] Jehoshaphat was the one that was laid in
[1:22:18] Judah and as king Jehoshaphat was
[1:22:20] leading Judah there came an invasion the
[1:22:23] Moa boys the AR and the people from Mere
[1:22:27] invaded the land of Judah and they
[1:22:29] wanted to take it and so Jehoshaphat is
[1:22:32] looking at the situation and and he
[1:22:34] knows that if he says I am going to go
[1:22:35] to battle with these people there's no
[1:22:38] way I'm going to win there are three
[1:22:41] against just this little Judah so we
[1:22:43] know if I try to go for them I'm not
[1:22:45] going to win and so Jehoshaphat a
[1:22:47] righteous man said okay I'm going to go
[1:22:48] to the Lord and place this battle before
[1:22:51] him and so Jehoshaphat goes and pray and
[1:22:53] pray and seek the face of the Lord and
[1:22:56] as he's seeking the face of the Lord the
[1:22:58] Lord hears his prayer and comes with an
[1:23:00] answer to the prophet of that age who
[1:23:02] was
[1:23:02] jahzel and he speaks to jhazel these
[1:23:05] words and tells jhazel to go and tell
[1:23:08] the king the king Jehoshaphat these
[1:23:10] words and he said hearen ye all Judah
[1:23:13] and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem this is
[1:23:15] 2 Chronicles 20:15 he said hearken ye
[1:23:18] all all ye Judah and ye inhabitants of
[1:23:20] Jerusalem and th King Jehoshaphat thus
[1:23:23] sayeth the Lord unto you be Not Afraid
[1:23:27] nor dismayed by the reason of this great
[1:23:30] multitude amen for the battle is not
[1:23:33] yours but the battle is the Lord's amen
[1:23:36] that's what he told the king Jehoshaphat
[1:23:38] Don't Be Afraid don't be this made of
[1:23:41] the great multitude that is gathered
[1:23:42] around you you're going to live this
[1:23:44] place and there's going to be a
[1:23:45] multitude that is going to try to gather
[1:23:46] around you but he's saying don't be
[1:23:48] afraid because the battle is not yours
[1:23:51] but the battle is the Lord's and you
[1:23:53] know how they overcame that battle you
[1:23:56] know they went to this battle and you
[1:23:57] know King Jehovah said to them listen
[1:23:59] the Lord told us that the battle is not
[1:24:01] ours but the battle is the Lord so you
[1:24:03] know all that we're going to do is f
[1:24:05] we're just going to sing we're just
[1:24:06] going to praise the Lord and as they
[1:24:08] began to praise the Lord as they began
[1:24:10] to lifts up the their Salter and lifts
[1:24:12] up their trumpets and they just began to
[1:24:14] sing and they just began to praise the
[1:24:16] Lord listen young person when you get
[1:24:18] into that bondage when you get into the
[1:24:20] place where the enemy is trying to close

[1:24:25] begin to praise the Lord you lift up
[1:24:27] your voice and begin to Worship the Lord
[1:24:29] because as the the children of Judah
[1:24:32] began to Worship the Lord and began to
[1:24:34] praise the Lord the scripture says that
[1:24:37] the enemies Tor against each other and
[1:24:39] they began to destroy themselves listen
[1:24:42] that's what is going to happen to your
[1:24:44] enemy when you begin to praise God in
[1:24:47] your darkness when you begin to praise
[1:24:49] God in your trial when you begin to

[1:26:29] land he wasn't the one doing the
[1:26:33] fight he wasn't the one doing the
[1:26:35] fighting it was the captain of the host
[1:26:37] of the Lord that was doing the fight
[1:26:40] brother Bram said that the captain had
[1:26:42] already been there and he has gone and
[1:26:44] weakened the foundations of the walls of

[1:30:09] come back and you come to check that
[1:30:13] room you come to see is that room filled
[1:30:17] or is that room
[1:30:20] empty and when it comes and it finds
[1:30:22] that room empty
[1:30:24] he's not going to come in but he's going
[1:30:27] to go back to hell and he's going to
[1:30:29] take seven more demons that are stronger
[1:30:31] than him and they're going to come into
[1:30:33] that
[1:30:34] house and it says the state of that man
[1:30:37] will be worse than what it was
[1:30:41] before but if the enemy comes and he
[1:30:44] finds that place filled up with the Holy
[1:30:48] Ghost with the power of God with the

[1:34:40] power as a witch it wasn't a remember
[1:34:43] yesterday we said were two Powers there
[1:34:46] the power of God and the power of the
[1:34:48] enemy and brother brandham said that the
[1:34:51] power of the enemy is real is a real
[1:34:53] power is the true power that's what
[1:34:56] brother brandham said so this woman said
[1:34:58] I had power when I walked down the
[1:35:01] street because I knew I I I could do
[1:35:05] whatever and I began to think if she can
[1:35:09] walk down the street with the power of
[1:35:11] the enemy and feel like she's got power
[1:35:15] and that is the lowest power that is
[1:35:17] ever here on the earth then what can a
[1:35:19] Believer do when he's got the power of
[1:35:22] God on the insert of them amen what kind
[1:35:26] of authority are we to have when we
[1:35:28] walking down the street with the power
[1:35:30] of God on the inser of us oh
[1:35:34] hallelujah
[1:35:37] hallelujah listen you've got more power
[1:35:40] than you think you have but you're going
[1:35:42] to have to allow the Holy Ghost to
[1:35:43] exercise that
[1:35:45] power because you know as we said
[1:35:48] yesterday God's confidence is not in
[1:35:51] your flesh or in your spirit but it's in
[1:35:53] the holy ghost that is on the inside of
[1:35:55] you that's why he's saying to you this
[1:35:57] morning take courage and Be not Afraid
[1:36:02] why because how can God Be Afraid God is
[1:36:06] courageous God is bold and he's the one
[1:36:08] that is in you Bo the Holy Spirit that's
[1:36:12] why this morning is saying to you take
[1:36:14] courage amen take courage amen and as he
[1:36:18] said to us for there shall not be any
[1:36:21] man be able to stand before bodyy all
[1:36:24] the days of your
[1:36:26] life from this moment on there shall not
[1:36:29] be any enemy that is going to be able to
[1:36:31] stand before
[1:36:32] thee if the Holy Ghost is in there the
[1:36:36] enemy is going to battle against you
[1:36:37] sure he will but he won't be able to
[1:36:40] Prevail we heard it yesterday if he
[1:36:42] didn't Prevail in heaven he can't
[1:36:44] Prevail
[1:36:45] here but you need to have the same God
[1:36:48] the same Michael that fought in heaven
[1:36:50] in you for him to fight for you
[1:36:55] you do you get a young people amen are
[1:36:58] you with me this this morning we're just
[1:37:00] laying down some few Foundation Ju Just
[1:37:02] So that we are we we get it that we go
[1:37:04] here with with boldness and and and and
[1:37:07] with confidence to know that we are Sons
[1:37:09] and Daughters of God so let me say this
[1:37:12] let's take courage this morning young
[1:37:14] people it is for you to awake the Jesus
[1:37:17] that's been Laing in your
[1:37:19] boat amen it is time to awake him L
[1:37:22] listen for so long he's been lying there
[1:37:24] you know just waiting he's just waiting
[1:37:27] for someone to say Jesus I am
[1:37:30] perishing it is time to awake Jesus in
[1:37:32] your boat amen he's been laying dormant
[1:37:35] for so long but awake him and he's going
[1:37:37] to calm every storm that you will face
[1:37:40] amen he can calm every storm that you
[1:37:43] face but you're going to have to wake
[1:37:45] Jesus in the boat amen iwake him in the
[1:37:48] boat allow the Holy Ghost to begin to
[1:37:51] fight for you that is how you awake
[1:37:53] Jesus in the boat when it begins to F
[1:37:56] fire in the form of the Holy Ghost
[1:37:58] because you know one
[1:38:00] Church the only way that this Holy Ghost
[1:38:02] is going to fail is When sin comes in
[1:38:05] and is
[1:38:06] unconfessed because the only time that
[1:38:08] the children of Israel lost the battle
[1:38:10] was when
[1:38:11] aen went and took some Babylonian
[1:38:16] garments he with me young people when he
[1:38:19] went and took some Babylonian garment
[1:38:21] and did not confess it and and thought
[1:38:23] he can hide it then he began to lose
[1:38:27] battles young
[1:38:29] people don't go taking any Babylonian
[1:38:32] garments from the
[1:38:34] world don't go taking any other
[1:38:36] entertainments from the world because
[1:38:39] there is where you're going to begin to
[1:38:41] lose your
[1:38:43] battles because just aen just aen you
[1:38:47] say but it was just aen all the other
[1:38:49] people are righteous but just aen but
[1:38:53] yet JS aen because of what he did they
[1:38:56] lost 16 men but they were told that they
[1:38:59] they were not supposed to lose even one
[1:39:01] man in any battle but just because of a
[1:39:03] nakan just because of some lustful
[1:39:05] Spirit or just because of some worldly
[1:39:09] fashion that you begin to
[1:39:14] entertain just because of that you begin
[1:39:16] to lose your battles you begin to open
[1:39:18] yourself up for the enemy to come in you
[1:39:21] say but but but it's just you know it's
[1:39:23] on the
[1:39:24] borderline listen don't stay on the

[1:39:30] all the way young
[1:39:31] person don't go pick up some worldly
[1:39:34] stuff and put it on here and and
[1:39:35] thinking it's pretty it's not pretty
[1:39:39] it's not pretty in the eyes of God
[1:39:42] that's why the prophet of God came in
[1:39:43] this age and he blasted all these wlon
[1:39:46] he blasted makeup he blasted all these
[1:39:48] kind of
[1:39:49] things listen it wasn't brother

[1:40:02] can I not be free why can I not receive
[1:40:05] when I'm in the church why is it that
[1:40:06] the word can't be real because you're
[1:40:08] holding on a Babylonian
[1:40:10] garment and that is hindering the spirit
[1:40:13] of God from moving and and having the
[1:40:15] preeminence in your life and you losing
[1:40:18] your
[1:40:19] battles because of the Babylonian

[1:53:19] they face the walls of Jericho now as I
[1:53:21] told you Joshua God there and met the
[1:53:23] captain of the host of the Lord amen and
[1:53:25] the captain of the host of the Lord told
[1:53:27] them listen if you want to tear down
[1:53:29] these walls that I have already weakened
[1:53:31] you're going to have to begin to March
[1:53:33] around these walls are you with me young
[1:53:36] people you're going to have to begin to
[1:53:37] March around these walls amen and so he
[1:53:41] said you're going to March around seven
[1:53:44] times are you with me young people
[1:53:46] you're going to March around it seven
[1:53:48] times now if we were going to bring that
[1:53:51] into the message of the hour those seven
[1:53:53] times represented seven Church ages are
[1:53:57] you with me young people you've heard
[1:53:59] that before right it represented seven
[1:54:01] Church ages so when they went marching
[1:54:03] around the wall the first time that was
[1:54:05] the Ephesian Church age when they went
[1:54:07] marching around the second time there
[1:54:09] was the smina church age and then the
[1:54:11] Philadelphia Church age and the toara
[1:54:13] church age and the Sardis Church age and
[1:54:16] then the oh sorry I think I messed up
[1:54:17] somewhere but then you have the
[1:54:19] Philadelphia Church age which was Wesley
[1:54:21] amen so March around how many time six
[1:54:24] times now on the seventh time which was
[1:54:26] the lean Church age which you are in now
[1:54:30] are you with me young people the Lan
[1:54:33] Church AG that you young people are in
[1:54:35] now and at this seven time the seven
[1:54:37] moment they had to go and March around
[1:54:39] it and not seven times on the seventh
[1:54:43] time that they March around
[1:54:45] it so the first day they just did one
[1:54:48] round second day one round third day one
[1:54:51] round fourth day one
[1:54:53] round fifth day one round sixth day one
[1:54:56] round but in the seventh day they had to
[1:54:58] do seven
[1:55:00] rounds are you with me young people they
[1:55:03] had to do seven rounds on the seventh
[1:55:06] day so in the seven age that you living
[1:55:08] in as a young person you have to do
[1:55:11] seven rounds amen and you know what
[1:55:13] those seven rounds are it's the opening
[1:55:16] of The Seven Seals are you with me young
[1:55:19] people now you say my this is so big
[1:55:21] this is so conflict it is not the
[1:55:24] opening of The Seven Seals is nothing
[1:55:26] but Jesus Christ revealing himself to
[1:55:29] you to be able to come and have the
[1:55:31] preeminence in
[1:55:33] you all
[1:55:37] right so you had to go around on the
[1:55:40] seven day seven times and now at the
[1:55:43] seventh time so at the opening of The
[1:55:46] Seven seal now the scripture said that
[1:55:49] there was silence in heaven
[1:55:52] young people it is not complicated don't
[1:55:55] because if you keep putting I can feel
[1:55:57] that I can feel some young people saying
[1:55:58] oh this is too hard this is too it is
[1:56:02] not listen if you sitting there and you
[1:56:04] you st in chemistry you did chemistry
[1:56:06] and then telling all the ionic bonds and
[1:56:08] the calent pawns and all these pawns
[1:56:14] man then we lost exactly
[1:56:18] right but this is you this is who you
[1:56:22] are
[1:56:24] so on that seven
[1:56:26] time that was the opening of that seven
[1:56:29] seal now at the opening of that seven
[1:56:31] seal there was some few brother brand
[1:56:32] will say and you talk about the third
[1:56:35] pool now the third pool were different
[1:56:37] is the opening of the word but in the
[1:56:39] tpol he mentions one thing and that is
[1:56:41] the speaking of the word that you can
[1:56:45] speak the word and that word will
[1:56:48] materialize listen young people this
[1:56:50] message is for you
[1:56:52] these things are for you it's not only
[1:56:56] for the for brother Danny it's not only
[1:56:58] for your parents it's for
[1:57:00] you but but I feel like many times the
[1:57:03] young people will just push those things
[1:57:04] aside and be like you know when I when I
[1:57:06] become 50 years old then I I began to to
[1:57:10] listen to the seals I don't understand
[1:57:14] no no at 13 years old you going
[1:57:19] understand what they mean and use it as
[1:57:21] a weapon against the enemy because that
[1:57:24] is your weapon the message is your
[1:57:28] weapon in this
[1:57:30] age so what that open another seven he
[1:57:33] spoke about the
[1:57:35] turple and in it he spoke about the
[1:57:37] spoken word and brother Brandon would
[1:57:40] show us how that spoken word

[1:58:02] them and they will come into existence
[1:58:04] amen and brother brandham spoke and they
[1:58:07] appeared in existence listen that wasn't
[1:58:11] just for us to read in the scriptures
[1:58:13] and say wow what God can do that was the
[1:58:16] wave SE that was the first one that was
