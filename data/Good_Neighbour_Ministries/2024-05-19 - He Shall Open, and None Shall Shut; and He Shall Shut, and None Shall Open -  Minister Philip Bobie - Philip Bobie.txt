know what everybody needs this morning please let their needs be met May no one live here the same way they came leave you more satisfied and drawing Closer to You Lord in Jesus name amen okay without wasting much time you read our scriptures first of all Pastor Danny send his greetings to the church and let's continue to lift him up as Joshua and cab lift Moses hands up continue to support and pray for him um our first scripture is Matthew 13: 11 to 17 um I'll be using that scriptures back and forth while I'm reading I'll go back to verse 12 verse 13 and just expanded so Matthew 131-7 he answered he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given for whosoever had to him um to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever have not from him shall be taken away even that he had therefore speak I to them in Parables because they seeing see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which said by hearing you shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive for the people's heart is wor gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed let at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear for very I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them my next scripture is revelation 3:7 and Isaiah 22:22 Revelation 3:7 and to the angel of the church in Philadelphia WR these things said he that is Holy he that is true he that had the Key of David he that open and no man sh it and Sh it and no man open Isaiah 22:22 and the key of the House of David will I lay upon his shoulder so he shall open and N shall shut and shall shut and None Shall open Heavenly Father please bless the reading of this word in Jesus name amen please be seated I think the scriptures alone is enough for the day can just okay um I'm just going to read this quotation and then um okay my topic will be he that hold the key of David when he shuted no one can open when he opens no one can shut Isaiah 22:22 that's my title he he open and None Shall shut and he shall shut and None Shall open that's the title so I'm going to read this here in um P loc Caterpillar by Reverend William Mar Braham 59823 paragraph 55 to 60 the other day I was talking and we were thinking of scripture I said why can't people see that I said that there it is and I happen to think I don't care how clear it is how much the scripture teaches it you will never be able to see it until God himself show it to you don't care how clear it is and the whole Bible is built and the whole Church of the Living God is built upon a spiritual revelation of the word why did Abel offer a more excellent sacrifice than King why did Abel follow King why didn't Abel follow King he had the most beautiful church but it was revealed to him when Jesus came from man transgression and they said who does man say I the son of man am one said Eli and one you are the prophet and so forth he said but who do you say person now I am Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God he said blessed art thou Simon the son of Jonas for Flesh and Blood never revealed this to you you never learn it with some books or by some Seminary or some station of mindmate schem but my Father in Heaven has revealed that to you and upon this Str I will build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it there you are spiritual revelation of the word of God in Matthew 11 the one that we just read I didn't even know that um this thing T that's fine I got the scripture then I found this tied up with that along it is written that though Jesus had done so many miracles so many signs that he was the Messiah yet the people could not believe it because Isaiah said they got eyes and they can't see they got ears and they can't hear how though they were Scholars though they were top religion religionists they were holy and without fault and Without Blame if they were found one iot wrong they were stoned without mercy no man could lay a finger on that they studyed the scripture day and night generation after generation and so God had blinded their eyes say God did that's what he said God does what he wants to we cannot tell him what to do did not Paul in the book of the Romans 8 said that God raised up pharaoh and hardened his heart blinded his eyes for the same purpose that his will might be work was not Esau and Jacob refused Esau refused before the boy was ever born God despised him you see it is all working according to God's Great predestination he's not one that is asleep he knows exactly amen so from the scriptures that we have read so many of them already it's clear to you and me that you cannot give yourself Revelation you cannot wake up yourself to receive Revelation he said I hold the key of David when I open no one can shut when I shut no one can open it's all about him he can choose to open your understanding he can choose to close it you can't for God he's a sovereign God he does what he desires to do he said that even he said that um except the Lord build a house the Builder build but in vain except the um the Lord watch the tower the watch man watch the city the watch man Wicked but in vain so you can do I'm not saying that you have to be lazy or you don't have to have knowledge or anything anything you can do your part but God is a sovereign he can choose to open your understanding he can choose to what close it but those that are his children because said that no one comes to the father except the father except I draw him first so those that are children of God God open thee understanding to see what is happening in every day and he reveal all the Mysteries to them because there's nothing that he going to hide from his children as when he was going to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah he said can I hide anything from Abraham and you been a royal Seed of Abraham God will never hide anything from you the whole world is in Tom oil the whole world is in chaos but the bride of Christ know what is going on because the prophet of told if you want to know what time you are living watch Israel so the bride of Christ will type what is happening in Israel and he knows what is going on on and the whole world is in Tomb oil you don't know what is happening but God has not hide himself from his children because if God hided himself from it means that you are not his those that are his he said blessed are your eyes for they can see amen you didn't work yourself out to that he gave it to you he open your eyes of understanding to see what is happening even now not in the past not in the future but you can recognize what God is doing present stage of his ministry because you are blessed you are chosen you are PR predestinated you are God's son or God's daughter so he cannot bypass you but he has revealed himself to you and all the time as we we read from the quote he said that those theologians those rabes those people they have gone to school from years and they know all the scriptures from A to Z but they couldn't recognize him when he was here because he blinded their eyes they are not his children they can study the Midnight Oil and study night and day but said I will not open your eyes of I've shut it but his children he open it to them amen and they can just see it clear as clear can be because revelation you canot receive by re Revelation by working through it you receive it effortlessly because God effortlessly give it to you if you are one of his children I'm not saying that you have to be lazy you don't have to dig in you have to but do God give it in on his own time and sometimes maybe it's not time for you to know something he W let let you know before time when you the time for you to know he will make what known to you that's the god that we are serving he is a living God and he never changed he's the same yesterday today and forever amen our God is awesome God hallelujah so those Pharisees those um learned people what is happening is that this Bible the letter kill it but the spirit give life when God God throws his light on it then it shines it light it it becomes life so the letter will kill you people are using the letter and killing and doing all kind of manner of things with it but the true bride of Christ God give them understanding and they know what to do with the word of God they don't go ahead of themselves they don't misplace the word they don't um put it anywhere they allow the Lord to lead them and make it clear has crystal clear and he becomes clear to them because it's God who is leading him he's not being led by himself but he has surrendered himself to the Living God and he's guiding and he's directing his footsteps and as we read he shut the eyes of some he opened eyes of some and this thing has been in the existence from the Garden of Eden it TNS in the beginning TS in the end it was Cain and Abel but Abel did not go to any SCH as our Pastor said he not have any bible to read but by revelation God revealed to him that it was blood that caused the fall of his parents and being that being revealed to him was able to make what the right sacrifice and the children of God is always word of God is always based on Revelation Cain just went by by his eyes the flowery and a lot of people are also thinking the same thing that good good works flowery thing best things design good to have a a wonderful church building good to have all those things but if God is not in that building if God is not the temple it doesn't become anything it's just a a symbol is that right it's it's not the mountain that is Holy but God in that mountain make that mountain holy it's not the people who are holy but holy ghost in them God in them makes it holy he lives his life through them so it's not by works of righteousness it's not how much you can do all I can do it's all about him and everything is based on Revelation without Revelation you cannot serve God you cannot please God that's what said it's impossible to please god without faith and faith is a revelation amen that's all the elders from the foundation of the world from the patriarch every one of them they they worship God by faith and faith is a revelation and when God reveals something to you you stand on it and you do it and God what V vindicate it because he reveal it to you he will make it clear he will testify of his gift let people know that he is the one that reveal himself to you amen and the Vine This has gone there all the time listen God doesn't look at your Works he looks into your heart amen he's looking into your desire amen that's the most important thing that's why Jacob and Esau before the children were even born God said I love Jacob Esau I hate why because him being God before the kids were born he knew that Esau is going to despise the birth right and that is what is happening even now a lot of people are selling their birth right so many people God has called them to this truth but they making their decision based on money not based on work not based on the revelation of the word God can even send someone to a good place is to receive the true word of God give him a job make some money but when opportunity comes to any I'm not saying you don't have to go but before you make that move you have to put God first a lot of people just go by their can mind they see the money they running you see what I mean and a lot of people even now the economy is very tough things are getting worse the Bible say going to get worse and worse and cold it's not going to be easy but stand by the word of God pay your sides be faithful to God how God is going to provide your needs I don't know but put him first seek him first the kingdom of God and his righteousness all other things shall be added unto it let's put God kingdom first let's put the word of God first let the word of God have prence anything we do we have to check it if it's in the word whatever you do you have to check is God pleased with what am I doing check it with the word of God don't be like Esau he was so hungry just for a pot of porridge he sold his b right Jacob was Rascal he was deceiver he did everything bad in the book when when he came the birth right he cherish it when he met that he said unless you bless me I'm not I leave you he struggled with the angel he fought with him until he got his Blessing so he a true Christian you got to fight is this is said the kingdom of God is taken by violence taken by violence sometime you got to force and push the devil away tell him Satan get hands behind me amen go to him and take whatever he stole from you if he stole your said I receive I take my health from you God restored me created me healthy you got no right to steal my health you got no right to steal my finances because God created you healthy he said whatsoever you ask in my name I will grant it to you amen amen so if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask whatever you will and I will grant it to you so God is willing to bless you God is willing to provide your need you have to ask you have to believe you have to speak and go for don't stay there don't let devil push you around he has pushed some of us around so much it's time to shake yourself when you say boo say boo back to him don't allow him to push you around you are greater than who you think you are because God is in you now why said that when the time come when they recognize who they are they were going to be invisible Army because oh man that's why P Sam was say like when one time King George was going to a battle he was going to turn back and one of his his servants said remember who you are in jge and just ride or ride or just for and get a victory it's time you have to recognize who you are you are a son or daughter of the Living God you are apple of God's eye amen with all the billions in the world God chose you he selected you he predestinated you to eternal life man what else what else blessed your eyes for they can see oh man I'm s i said I can't get away from this am it's become so clear and crystal clear to me the grace of God and the love of God Amen God is so good Hallelujah those two Vines are still here in the time of Jesus we have Judas it was still there amen you was with Jesus Christ what happened is that bra brah explained that sometimes God purposely say certain things to put some people out to let some Ponder and to bring some also in okay so he gave an example with Jesus Christ in the first pool of ministry there were thousands following his ministry one day he said except eat of My Flesh and drink of my blood you have no part in me and all left and it was left 70 then he said the son of man who is now here now in heaven and they say we haven't heard of this and they all left and it was left only 12 and one was devil Judas saying his ministry then he asked Peter will he also go then Peter said thou alone H has the word of life where can we go where can we go where God has brought us this far he has kept us all these years it's not by works of right God has kept you here through trials through tribulations all these years what is keeping you he has kept us it's his grace that has kept us some of us we have gone through a lot of Trials and the devil doesn't even leave us alone but listen we are not going to give up we're going to fight until we reach our final destination onward Christian soldiers fighting us to war with the cross of Jesus on before you amen don't ever give up he didn't bring you this far to leave you he didn't bring us this far to let us Dr oh man take stand on his promises everyone of them because his promises will never fail he keep all his appointment God keep all his word amen he said let every man's word be alive but mine be the truth God can never lie amen no he can never fail he will never fail you will not forsake you I God that you Serv a living God he loves you and he promised I will never leave thee nor forsake thee so he have kept us this far he's going to keep on keeping us until we reach our final destination although sometimes their trials may become stronger but don't look at it because it's all for trying to your faith oh man to draw you more closer to God ohen those tries didn't come to break you it came to shape you because and as you a human being even talk about it Hey listen you got to have Tri every day you going to have things to overcome every day oh he said I have problem with my wife or problem with my my my husband and you pray you fight through and that thing is solve you happy you are enjoy life for a while then you have Financial stress then bills this you fight you go through overcome everything is settled all your finances are all in what good accounting balance you even have some maybe surus then you going to have problems with your teenage children you raising with your children this grandchildren things coming up here and there you solve it after a while something will show up so we always have something to overcome you never going to have it easy easy if if you have everything is there the devil has already got you because he doesn't care about you but as son or daughter of God you always going to go through and one thing you have to remember that God that delivers us from that financial problem that delivered her from um maybe marriage problem deliver from this when the situation comes just calm down and commit it to God he will bring it to pass sometimes we look at the situation we look at conditions we force to make decisions by the flesh sometime you don't wait you can get into a tight corner and you just want to get the T fast fast and you want to use everything to get it but if you sit down quiet it and come down and commit it to God he will bring it to pass no wonder that the Bible said that the patience of Abraham he got patience to wait for 25 years and even after the 25 years God still try him and said the very thing that you have waited for all these years I I want you to give it to me sacrifice it to me amen you see what I mean God said I want to sacrifice the very thing that you have cried for you have waited for 25 years but you know what Abraham's Faith was in God he believed that he gave him that child as someone who was what um all his his vitals were all gone he couldn't give birth at that if he's able to do that then God is able to raise his son up even if he sacrific him that's where the confidence you have to have in God no matter what comes our way no matter what happens to you I our life is in his hand he's in hand he going to take control over it let's commit our ways to god let's commit our thoughts to Let's commit every situation listen when you plant a corn you plant something all that you have to do is what you water it you can't go every time and take it up and see how he's doing so is God when you commit something to him let's leave it there and just thank him and know that his perfect will will be done because so many times certain things we don't understand initially but after a while he comes down and reveal to you why this happened why that happened why that happened I remember one time braam said that he was so angry with God that he went to pray for somebody and that person died and he said God you owe me an answer you owe me an answer you have to explain to me and later when he revealed to him what happened that the person could have died maybe 20 years back or whatever but he wasn't ready to go but after he received the word of God he was ready to go he said oh God forgive me God don't owe you nothing amen he is a sovereign God Amen whatever he does is Right amen I remember one time even in my life and I needed something from God and I was bothering him and praying and crying and oh one time then I was going through that the same nor and a voice like voice said that you cannot force God you cannot tell God what to do then I let the I leave it from that time I learned my lesson we have to leave everything in God's hands let's commit you to him and don't fight and fast he will make it plain amen praise our God hallelujah so I'm still on my topic that two Vines is still here in the time of Paul said that there's a what um graving wolves or whatever in wolves in a sheep skin in in among you it's still here and our time is still here you got to have that spirit of discernment and just focus on your word and let God have his own way because as I said that you cannot foruse God to give you a revelation those things are effortlessly he will reveal to you what you need to do amen but it's not your business God is the one who taking care of every situation and you're going to make everything what clear to you hallelujah praise God so I'm going to go back to the scripture that I read again and I read a little quote and still goes back with it um in Matthew 13:16 it said blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for day here um I'll read this here in the church ages book he said that let me show you another reason why Satan hates This Book of Revelation of this Jesus Christ in the church he knows that it's a revelation of Jesus Christ I think page 15 he knows that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he changes not he's know that a whole he know that a whole lot more than do 90% of the theologians he knows that since God is immutable in his nature then he's just as imitable in his ways thou Satan knows assuredly that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God Maxis in action is a true church that God claims as his own all else is false it has to be now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of what the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how that Antichrist spirit will come into the church and defile it making it what look warm as our brother said is a spirit here formal and what powerless amen it exposes Satan revealing his Works attempted destruction of God's people and discing of God's word right down the time he cast into what the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stand for and that she cannot she can do the Greater Works she will be an invisible Army if they get a true revelation of the true Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit design and withand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be what powerless before her he will be as definitely thed today as when Christ witho his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it with through Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot what Prevail against but will will prevail okay this one said that making it look from former and Powerless there was a question asked that who going to seek more or who going to want to have God's more is that the person who have the Holy Ghost or the one who doesn't have if that person have the Holy Ghost he's the one that going to seek more of God he wants more because you can never reach that you always want to get more is is the presence of God listen in life that's why a lot of people they smoke read and they smoke cocaine they crack all this because God left a part of him himself in every human heart and in in only God can satisfy that test in that human heart some people try to satisfy with a brand new car it doesn't last a new house it doesn't last like for instance if you don't have a watch and you bought the swis watch for maybe a million dollar whatever it is for a couple of months or weeks you really H cherish it but after a while becomes common to you so everything that we strive for here um it doesn't last but one thing that you always desires more is the presence of God when you get to that height you can never get to a place as oh I'm so full enough I don't need that's I fill my cup every day with what love every day you need the presence of the his presence there's one um Coming of the Holy Ghost but there's more what in feeling so you need that presence every that's the only thing that H you cannot it it cannot become common to you all the rest we need them don't get me wrong we need to get a new house you need everything you have to enjoy them but that satisfaction doesn't what last the only thing that satisfies is God himself in human heart that's why David says I dear for the water Brook so my soul thirst after thee for the Living God that's say some place also that um um in Psalm Psalm 25 he says that all that I desire to be in the the house of the Lord that's to dwell in the house of the Lord that to live dwell in his presence that's why you have the most satisfaction that's why you long for and the capsule when you reach that love that thing nobody can take you there it's God himself amen he himself can take you there that's why I said that when I sh it no one can open when I open no one can sh he is the one in control all that you have to just leave our life commit Our Lives to him and what we have to know he's going to let us know at the right time and the right time so what I'm trying to say even sometimes certain things we don't understand just leave them alone amen don't fight with the scriptures don't fight with those things when the time comes for you to know he will let you know it amen because our God hasn't changed he's the same yesterday today and forever amen praise our wonderful God am hallelujah amen so um I think I'm going to read um okay in the verse 17 said that very very I say unto you the many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen them and to hear those things which ye hear and have not what heard them okay I'm going to take it a little bit far back and come over there um let's go to I think Matthew 17 11 to2 for very last okay and Jesus answered and said unto them El Li truly shall first come and restore all things but I say unto you that elas is come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise us the son of M suff of them so this is two coming of elas elas John the Baptist is two coming of elas one of them was for John the Baptist you know when John the Baptist came he never restored all things but God send us Malachi 45 Revelation 10:7 William myON br to restore all things he gathered all the truth all that the cans has eaten the caterpillars and the um and the what the cans have eaten the caterpillar has eaten the pal and all those God said I will restore said the Lord so all the missing truth after the death of um the Apostle John when the church went into the Dark Ages God used the prophet of God to restore all that missing truth so through that the bride of Christ the word is presented to us when he call you in you have access to all those truth that God restored through him and restoration is to bring something back to its original estate so like your health God created you healthy he created you to be healthy and strong but the enemy comes and bring you this disease bring you that disease and say you are this and the doctors giving you so many reports you have the right and go back to enemy's camp and tell him that by Stripes I am healed and stand on that promise and put your name over there because God gave you that promise so that disease that sickness has no part in you God promis to restore all things restoration is restoring this flesh too going to restore you so don't let the devil push you around you got a right to a perfect health no matter what the enemy is telling you no matter what the doctors are telling you yes they are doing their job but you can also say by his strengths I am healed amen I am healed I whole believe it and walk in it and you get your health if you have Financial Pro above all things are which thou May prosper and be in health even as your soul also Prospect redemption in three parts you have the right to all of them let's not focus to only one part god send us a former Pastor BR John Simon he he he drilled that into our heart don't be satisfied wanted Redemption you have all three parts redemption in three parts receive all the three parts of redemption amen so you have the right to those healthy life and everything but all that God needs from you just like job when God blesses him his heart was not on those things his heart was on God so when the enemy took everything away he never cares God because he was his his his main purpose was to please God and I think braam went through the same thing and when he lost his wife and his daughter he wanted to kill himself and in his dark moment the enemy came and told him all kind of lies and he was almost going to accept what he said that comes back to the predestination seed something rose up in him he said who am I I what what do I bring in this world we used to leave 10 people live in the same house God doesn't owe me nothing I didn't bring nothing in this word the Lord Give the Lord take it blessed be the name of the Lord so if those things become attached to you then you have power because that's why any power with that character become satanic but with character you can rule amen what God has given us character by revealing himself to you so we know what to do with God's word you know what to do with our lives this is the time when God blesses us we know how to to support his work to support his missions to enjoy some for our family and use the rest wisely but we are not attached to those things because we know that God is able to do everything and what important he has given us eternal life absence from here presence with the Lord amen amen one of these days we're going to be what move over on the other side hey amen he's the same yesterday today and forever amen he a consuming fire consuming fire amen praise our wonderful God our God is good he all the time is a wonderful God hallelujah praise God hallelujah so and another thing too Malachi 456 was fulfilled in brother Abraham Ministry and we are the manifestation of that Malachi 45 and being that it means that as we said that the original church is what the continuation of what the book of Acts so whatever happens in there over there with them God is doing exact same thing in your life in my life but we only have to be conscious of what God is doing because time when you are not conscious of it it will bypass you God is doing a mighty work in his bride the same thing we are not different from Peter John and all those people they were men that God was living inside of them and they did everything because God was inside of them and that same God that was in Peter that was in Paul that was in John that was in Matthew that same God is in you and in me today so you have power over everything because God is in you amen you are not different than those people the same God that was in them is in us and he's doing the same things and the work that I do shall you also do amen greater than this shall you also do so we have many member body and God is using this one here using that one here we are not comparing oursel one another we all make different based on measur of Faith somewhere he said that Apollo Apollo planted Paul watered and God gave the increase because he's the one that going to give the increase because when he open no one can shut when he shut no one can open so when the time come for you going to do his part so we are not here comparing ourself one another we are here with one purpose Amen to do everything for the kingdom of God that's all our purpose in this life here to do everything support the kingdom of God to get the last one in so that we can get up from here I'm sick and tired of this world I want to go home to my father amen it's time to go home but before it to go home we have our part to do amen we have those that God has blessed you to be prayer warriors you need to pray and pray and pray support the ministry those that have the money bring the money support it to do whatever it because when those people use the the what the f to go and to the remote areas to get a people you're going to get your reward over on the other side amen those that have to clean you have to clean perfectly to support the work of whatever you do you have to do your part don't look at one another don't say this one is not do I remember when I was a kid about maybe 12 or 10 years 15 hour in school and were doing some voluntary doing some work and this one was not doing this one was not doing and something spoke in my heart Philip don't look at what people are not doing just go forth and do your part from that age 12 years that has always stick in my heart even when I'm here when I came working for people I never look myself oh this guy is not doing work I'm comparing myself this one why this one is standing there I don't care about what someone is not doing I have to make sure I've done my portion so we have to make sure that we do our part and if you see someone's in error pray for that person pray for him if he does something wrong you don't like it go to him with love of God explain to him if he doesn't listen then you Elders no let some of the others go with you and settle it don't hold nothing in your heart because if you hold something in your heart you are the one suffering the person who said back to you he sleeping AR leg snoring and you are wor your head and thinking oh my goodness let's go and let God have his own way let's forgive ourselves don't be so hard on yourself sometime you become so hard on ourself oh I did this I should have done this what you did is what God wants you to do don't worry because said the steps of righteous men are ordered of the Lord even though you might mistake whatever Jonah made a mistake he ran from the presence of God but in the end it serve God's purpose amen so it's you and me even all our mistakes are ordered by God so don't look down upon yourself when you made that mistake make things right and move on with your life don't let it stay and bother you and bother you and cry and cry some people they can't let go they want to stick to this stick to that no don't let nothing stick to you let's go and let God have his own way you are free within the boundaries of God's word you are free whom the Son of God has set free is free indeed but your freedom is within the boundaries of God's word amen you can't take your grace into disgrace you have to run according to what within the parameters one time God gave me a thought that when you drive in in the on the street because you have your Lan is that right and someone ahead of you you can see maybe his car is moving this way that way that way that way all that you focusing that person is not driving good but you don't know how your car is also doing that's why the Bible said that take from your your eyes before you take somebody's side examine yourself if you are in the faith don't concentrate so much on other people's mistakes it's not going to help you the only thing you can do is to pray for them but don't gossip and take this message to he this side no God wants us to be all faithful love one another let's stand for one another let's stand for our brothers and sisters let the love of God project when love projects Grace takes over is a love that God has given to us he lovees first then we can love him back and if you love him back then you have to love our brothers and sisters because love covers multitude of mistakes let's love one another let's pray for one another is very important you don't know what anyone is going through it's a very um preure time it's a pressure age there's too much pressure out there if for the young people if you have a young person young son whatever in their 20s in their teenage you got to pray and support them the said that your children is going to have 10 times Temptations more than you have when you are in your youth the pressure is small but greater is he that is in next than he that's in the world he promised he never leave us nor forsake us when the enemy rise like a flood the spirit of God will raise a standard and that's always raise a standard amen so our confidence is in God that he raise a standard amen hallelujah no matter what comes to our way our life is in God's hands amen praise our god thank you amen hallelujah I'm still on the verse 17 I'm just going to close very shortly he said for verily I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and to hear those things which ye here and have not what Heen amen and you think about it someone like Prophet Daniel God told him shut up the book of those seven seeds until the end he told John don't open it wait until the end until the on the days of was the seventh angel when he began to sound all the Mysteries will be finished as he has declared unto his servants the prophet things that you are hearing and Desiring now and going through those P prophets were what they wanted to have gone through that to have heard those things those are precious Word of Life amen and God has revealed and open to us the seal has been open the lamb broke the book and through the prophet that still is open but has it been revealed Reve to you ever since it was open that this is accessible but it comes back I hold the KY of David when I open no one can shut when I shut no one can open our eyes of understanding God has what opened at last and we can see and we have desire we can go through all this and see what God has done for us and God is doing send as a Vindicated Prophet Malachi 4:5 says fulfilled Revelation 10:7 it must 37 all this things God sent a mighty seventh angel Prophet brother William Haron Braham to fulfill all those scriptures amen and now is the time of the Bride he said as Was Elijah Elisha Elisha types the bride and you know what's happening okay before I even go there let's let's read Hebrews 11374 Hebrews 37:4 okay he said he said they were Stone they were stor as sender were tempted were slain with a sword they wondered about in ship skin and goost skin being destitute Afflicted tormented of whom the world Listen of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and this all having obtained a good report through what Faith Revelation received not the promise God having provided some better things for rest that they without us should not be made what perfect what Assurance how God esteem is high that all this prophets without us they cannot be what made perfect some place they said they are what all waiting on what on Earth so the B is in our hands let's run with what God has put in our hands let's cast off laziness let's cast off anything un likee god let's approach it with sincerity with with um with sincerity with everything within us with reverence because God has put his confidence in Us in the bride of Christ that all those people without us could not be made perfect they are waiting on us that put what it make me sometimes even coming here I don't know what to express but it's I I don't have how to uh put words to it but re you know this is life and death yes right reverence is not a place of joke this is the time you have to be serious and put this in perspective because time Wast for us no more time shall be no more we are in a desperate hour it's a serious time brother and sister this not time to play Church let's forget about playing Church be serious with the God's word I know you have to work I know you have to make money but let's put God first that's why some said that because you have let your first laugh let's go back to our first La when this world came to us first when he revealed we couldn't wait to come to church we couldn't wait to pray all night support and pray for the one preaching it's time you go back to all those things Hallelujah pray for the preacher pray for the pastor pray for one another if Prayer Changes Things why don't you pray pray let's not let social media take all of our time we I'm not saying don't use it but don't let social media use you you use it but don't let it use you that that is the difference you have the right to use it but don't let it use you you have to have time and say maybe I'm spending 30 minut or 1 hour when that time come I don't care sh enough I don't want to see anything if you don't become disciplined then you're going to be taken way off like a family that don't even have a budget for their household expenses they will spend money wly you have to have a plan you have to have a budget you have to have everything you have to be in perspective so let's move on with the love of God in our heart and do whatever God wants us to do amen and then back to what I was saying that is a bright time God send us a Vindicated prophet he fulfilled all those scriptures and one time I had someone was just um arguing with me about the scripture Revelation 108 to 11 I say it's a bride Ministry and the guy was so angry braah blah blah brah didn't explain it and it just occurred to me last we just thinking about it how the people can always BR him appreciate things in the past and grab it and can talk in the future but when the thing is happening right in their eyes they can't see it because the people in the message they feel so good when bra bran preached birth pains and then he came and preached this day this scripture is fulfilled in your eyes he said that Jesus in Isaiah 61:1 to2 he didn't explain all the verse two he only gave them 61 verse one and some part of the verse two because it wasn't ordained for his time so he didn't touch it right so God sent us a prophet and being the prophet of God the eager eyes he said that I am going to what young men will I don't have time I'll lay what I'll lay the foundation young man will come they take this and run with it that young man are not going to say anything contrary to what he said has to line up with the word that he brought and the young man could just see and said that oh John tyes a bride Revelation 10 never came that's not pertain to him it's a bride Ministry and the people are still fighting the prophet did not explain it you want the brother to come back from death and explain that to you that is what is happening that part is for the bride of Christ in the book it will be sweeter in your mouth but bitter in your belly amen he took it and it's bit in the belly amen but said prophesy came going to go through persecutions amen you're going to go through trials it's not going to be easy they're going to mock about some of some of going I been mock even when I came my friends they left me oh flip is C I'm not cuckoo i' I've met the Lord Jesus Christ they are cuckoo not me I have a sad mind amen I've met the Lord Jesus Christ Christ has come to my life I made a new creature amen all things have been made new I'm changed for a better life he Change Me From the Inside Out amen they are those who are cuckoo bra said in the end going to be only what those within the bride who have a sound mind so many people are insane insane insane yes so you're going to go through persecutions but look if you look at a tree when storm comes shake that leaves shake it shake it but when those leaves shaking shaking like that the roots go more deep deeper what it get more settled so is the bride of Christ the more you go through those stries the more you go through those percs God is what establishing you amen he's dealing with your heart so don't look at those stries those stries came to refine you they didn't come to kill you amen let's praise God let's worship him let's thank him oh let's give him all the praise and the honor because he deserve to be worshiped he deserve to be glorified let's thank him he has done so much rest he has opened our eyes of understanding he has opened up at last amen blessed are your eyes for dous they see oh man your ears they could hear amen God who is rich in Mercy he hold the key of David has opened your eyes of understanding he has opened your ears to hear his word oh man what a God that you serve I'm so true I'm so thankful to God that billions of people now about 8 billion but God chose me he predestinated me to this eternal life it means everything to me brother this all this world worth for me I'm grateful I'm thankful for this grace that has God has come into my life I can't thank him enough for the eternal life that he has given to me it's worth millions of wellers oh man last yesterday we said I said one Soul repented all the Heavenly Host rejoices what shall proit gain the whole world and loses his soul that means that you that God has been saved you as a bride of Christ you work more than the whole world Hallelujah so you have to work just with your chest up amen knowing that God is behind you hallelujah our god is good I'm so thankful to God I can't thank him enough for this great salvation this eternal life being part of God I have no beginning I have no end like God himself oh man when you strike your heart man you cry and thank him and give him all the praise God is good amen let's go to I conclude with Isaiah 2222 Isaiah 2222 okay and the key of the House of David will I lay upon his what shoulders so he shall open and None Shall shut and he shall shut and None Shall open the prophet isain that upon his shoulders it's like in the Eastern uh wedding even I think they do it over here too they put the veil on the on the the the V put the husband put it on his shoulders it means that that husband has claimed responsibility of the bride and that's what the Lord say di did for us he came to die on Calvary for us he conquered death hell and Grave so that you should not conquer he has done it for you already he became sick so you can become what he healthy he became became poor so you can become what Rich he went through all that he took that responsibility all our response all our cares all he came to suffer and died a shameful death for you and me he didn't have to do that but for the love of God he took that responsibility and he had right said to even marry he chose not to yes he went through all this for you and me so what are you doing in 10 we have to accept it healing is not for your healing unless you accept it everything you got what accept it so it becomes yours and in 10 most of us all of us say our part that we have to do is that we also has taken God not only as our savior but we have given what the lordship as Sarah called Abraham my Lord when someone become your Lord he's in control of everything responsibility you not give him part and say oh don't come to this chamber this thought is my own thought nobody has to know about it um this is my own business God I give you this portion don't come to this portion but when he becomes the Lord of you you leave everything to him to be a lordship of your health of your body of your soul of your mind of everything everything that concerns you and me let God have preeminence in everything in our life as Moses and Paul became prisoner of Christ so should we be in our lives musicians comes he is Lord amen he is Lord he is Lord is Lord he has R and he is Lord every KN sh every tongue call first by Jesus
