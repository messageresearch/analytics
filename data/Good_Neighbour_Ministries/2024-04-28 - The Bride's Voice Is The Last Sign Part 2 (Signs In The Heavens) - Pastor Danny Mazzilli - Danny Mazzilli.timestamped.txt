[35:42] sleep
[35:44] Lo children are inh Heritage of the Lord

[36:12] the gate amen praise
[36:16] God in um in the book of
[36:20] Samuel uh verse um 1st Samuel 1 verse 26
[36:29] six um I'm just going to read that
[36:35] quickly praise
[36:38] God chapter 1 verse
[36:43] 26 and this is about Hannah when you
[36:46] know she had received a child and she
[36:48] had been praying unto the Lord and she
[36:51] said oh my Lord as thy soul liveth my
[36:55] Lord I Am Woman I am the woman woman
[36:57] that stood by thee here praying unto the
[37:01] Lord for this child I prayed and the
[37:04] Lord hath given me my petition which I
[37:07] asked of him therefore also I have lent
[37:12] him to the Lord as long as he liveth she
[37:16] liveth be lent to the Lord and she
[37:20] worshiped the Lord there and he
[37:23] worshiped the Lord there amen praise God
[37:27] today we uh are witnesses of a child
[37:30] that the Lord has given you into your
[37:33] home and today by you coming here you're
[37:37] making a
[37:38] declaration you're saying that that Leah
[37:44] Christine is a child that you want to
[37:47] give back to the Lord that you want to
[37:51] acknowledge that the Lord is is Lord and
[37:54] head and leadership in your life
[37:58] that her life is now something that you
[38:01] want to place into the safety of God's
[38:04] hands but her safety is in your
[38:08] hands at the same time in the way that
[38:11] you serve the Lord in the way that you
[38:13] dedicate yourselves as a husband as a
[38:17] wife as a mother and as a father will
[38:21] show the the the true faith that you
[38:24] have in really sincere wanting the Lord
[38:29] to place his hand over her life to watch
[38:32] over her every step to be there in her
[38:35] times of decision and eventually to make
[38:38] that decision where she herself will
[38:41] come to the Lord
[38:43] amen and
[38:45] so uh the dedication of a child to the
[38:48] Lord is an important statement by the
[38:52] parents and by the church
[38:54] family when we stand here together as as
[38:58] the children of God as the family of God
[39:00] we realize that it takes a village to
[39:02] raise a child and we're willing to do
[39:05] and to pray and to support those that
[39:08] are identifying themselves as a part of
[39:12] this local body amen and so uh
[39:17] god um you know and and so the parents
[39:21] are covenanting before God to raise
[39:24] their child to know to love and to serve
[39:28] the Lord Jesus Christ amen praise God
[39:33] and so at this time I'd like to dedicate
[39:36] the child unto the
[39:40] Lord I get a chance to hold the baby my
[39:44] wife says are you going to hold the baby
[39:45] I said
[39:47] absolutely praise God highly yeah oh

[40:45] hand be upon her May the angels of God
[40:48] be encamped about her and Lord these
[40:51] parents that have identified themselves

[40:57] that that you will bless them that you
[40:58] will be with them that you will give
[41:00] them Lord leadership wisdom Lord a
[41:04] loving environment for this child Lord

[42:30] and there's your uh certificate okay
[42:33] let's give them a round of
[42:34] [Applause]
[42:45] applause amen praise God so now we need
[42:48] to go to the word now I've got an
[42:51] unusual word
[42:52] today um it's going to uh possibly we're
[42:57] going to be here a little bit longer
[42:58] than we normally would but um as you
[43:01] know um in May the garden centers really
[43:06] take off and I'm going to be tied up
[43:08] there we have very able ministers
[43:11] actually next weekend we've got a
[43:13] visiting Minister then we've got Pastor
[43:15] Simon who will be stepping in on the
[43:17] 12th we've got brother Phillip who will
[43:19] be stepping in on the 19th we've got
[43:22] Pastor Simon again I believe
[43:24] 26th and then um and then then I should
[43:27] be back right around the beginning of
[43:29] June so um you know the lord has laid
[43:31] this message upon my heart over the last
[43:34] you know several weeks um so we want to
[43:37] get right into it I want to uh finish it
[43:40] today okay so I'm going to need your
[43:41] patience but if you come into the
[43:44] atmosphere of where we're going here
[43:46] today I believe you'll leave rejoicing
[43:49] amen I really do because um this is
[43:52] something that the Lord has certainly uh
[43:55] been dealing on my heart and um what I'm
[43:58] bringing to you today is all that that
[44:00] God has basically laid on my heart okay
[44:03] and I want to make it clear that you
[44:05] know there's going to be things that are
[44:07] going to be said here that um that I am
[44:10] not claiming any kind of you know the
[44:14] first to recognize this or to see this
[44:17] or to all I'm doing is what we're all
[44:20] doing we're walking with God amen amen
[44:24] and like I said right at the beginning
[44:25] this is a supern natural walk and if
[44:28] you're not seeing the supernatural in
[44:31] your walk then you need to dig deeper
[44:34] like you heard last weekend when the
[44:36] Lord was speaking to us we need to go
[44:38] deeper and and really get serious with
[44:41] our walk with God so that we can know
[44:44] assuredly who we are the hour that we're
[44:47] living in and what it is that God is
[44:49] doing in this day and in this hour amen
[44:51] praise God let's go to our first
[44:54] slide so we're going to continue along
[44:57] the same lines now it's going to go into
[44:59] another Direction but it's all
[45:02] surrounding signs in the heavens it's
[45:04] all about recognizing that God his first
[45:08] Bible was written in the heavens before
[45:10] he declares anything on the earth he
[45:12] declares it in the heavens in our last
[45:14] service we were looking at the cloud
[45:16] we're going to finish that and then
[45:18] we're going to be looking at God's
[45:19] perfect
[45:20] numerology okay that these things that
[45:23] have happened in our day that happened
[45:26] in the in the
[45:27] you know in the early 60s with William
[45:29] Mariam brandom in the in the visitation
[45:32] of the supernatural Cloud on Sunset
[45:34] Mountain was not just uh just another
[45:38] event it was a
[45:41] supernatural uh
[45:44] dimensional uh time
[45:46] changing uh uh dispensational changing
[45:50] event that the Earth was coming under
[45:54] and and was allowed to witness but it's
[45:57] not everybody that recognized it amen
[46:00] praise God and so when we look at
[46:02] everything we want to see it in the
[46:04] right perspective let's go to our first
[46:10] slide and let's read the scripture
[46:14] amen Luke chapter
[46:16] 21 25-28 let's all
[46:20] stand respects to the lord and there
[46:23] shall be signs in the Sun and in the
[46:25] moon and in the Stars
[46:27] and upon the Earth distress of nations
[46:31] with perplexity the Sea and the waves
[46:34] roaring men's Hearts failing them for
[46:37] fear and for looking after those things
[46:39] which are coming on the earth for the
[46:42] powers of Heaven shall be
[46:44] shaken and then shall they see the son
[46:47] of man coming in a cloud with power and
[46:50] great glory and when these things begin
[46:53] to come to pass then look up and lift up
[46:57] your heads for your Redemption dwth nigh
[47:02] let us pray
[47:03] father Lord you know everything that you
[47:07] have placed upon our hearts Lord we're
[47:11] we're going into areas of your word and
[47:15] we're believing in everything that you
[47:17] Vindicated and that you showed and that
[47:19] you came and confirmed through a a
[47:22] Vindicated prophet in the 20th century
[47:25] Lord we know that you are still the same
[47:29] yesterday today and forever you will
[47:33] never change what you did back then you
[47:35] are doing again today it's how you
[47:37] declare yourself it's how you make
[47:39] yourself known Lord we're asking that
[47:42] your anointing will come this morning
[47:44] Lord as a man I am weak but as your
[47:48] servant this morning as a yielded vessel
[47:51] I'm surrendering it to you Lord you can
[47:54] have absolute preeminence and you can do
[47:56] and speak the supernatural into the
[47:59] lives and into the hearts of your people
[48:01] that are here present and those that are
[48:03] listening online father Lord may you
[48:06] take absolute control you be The
[48:10] Interpreter Lord you be the one that
[48:13] vindicates you be the one that makes it
[48:15] real to each and every individual heart
[48:20] Grant it we pray in Jesus Christ's name
[48:24] amen God bless you may be seated
[48:29] next slide brother brandham speaking
[48:31] here in Christ is identified the same in
[48:33] all generations 1964 he says and then
[48:36] every sign has a voice behind it and the
[48:40] voice must be a scriptural voice okay so
[48:44] everything we're going to be looking at
[48:45] today I want you to bear that in mind
[48:48] okay that whatever we're looking at
[48:50] we're looking at the scripture God's
[48:52] word to to to to be the Vindication
[48:55] behind everything that we're bringing
[48:59] okay if there's going to be a voice it's
[49:00] got to be scriptural there's nothing
[49:03] that that I can bring as a man or that
[49:05] any Minister can bring as a man that of
[49:08] his own interpretation you see that's
[49:10] what they've done with all the rest of
[49:12] the denominational churches they've
[49:13] taken man's doctrines and man's
[49:16] teachings and man's interpretations on
[49:19] the word of God and by doing that Jesus
[49:22] said they've made the word of none
[49:24] effect to the people and so now signs
[49:28] happen things happen the supernatural
[49:30] takes place and people just keep on
[49:33] walking like nothing ever happened why
[49:36] because that's also
[49:39] scripture like Moses when he went down
[49:42] into Egypt the voice of the first sign
[49:45] the voice of the second sign and every
[49:49] great thing that happens with God that
[49:52] gives a sign there's a voice follows
[49:57] that
[49:58] sign like Jonah when he was delivered
[50:01] from the the belly of the whale that was
[50:04] a sign then his voice was
[50:07] repent or in 40 days you'll perish so
[50:12] there's always the voice going with the
[50:16] sign amen go to the next
[50:19] slide today we're going to be um
[50:21] continuing right along the
[50:24] thought that we had um and that the
[50:28] bride's voice in this hour and when I
[50:31] talk about the bride I'm talking about
[50:32] the church there's a church that's a
[50:36] church that's LED and directed by the
[50:39] Holy Spirit himself not a church that's
[50:43] directed and and led by man there is a
[50:47] real true church in this day and in this
[50:49] hour there's scattered all over the
[50:51] world okay and they're joining and
[50:53] they're getting together just like we
[50:55] are today we're not not the only church
[50:58] that's under this Supernatural
[51:00] leadership of the Lord himself the Lord
[51:04] himself but when the Lord comes just
[51:07] like he did back in the Old Testament
[51:09] you look at all the the the books of the
[51:11] Old Testament and all the prophets of
[51:13] the Old Testament when they stood before
[51:16] the people and stood there and said thus
[51:19] sayeth the Lord that was not the man the
[51:23] prophet that was God's voice in the
[51:27] prophet and so they were the voice for
[51:30] that time for that season and for that
[51:32] generation amen praise God and so God
[51:36] has always had a
[51:38] voice in every season in every time in
[51:41] every
[51:42] dispensation but it's it's not an easy
[51:46] thing to recognize his voice because his
[51:49] voice W it walks among the common people
[51:52] it moves among the common people and the
[51:55] common people will miss it most of the
[51:58] time just like they did when Jesus
[52:00] himself was here upon the
[52:02] Earth and so we're looking for that
[52:06] scriptural voice but brother Braham says
[52:08] here the seed shall not be a with the
[52:10] shuck message in
[52:12] 1965 Jesus said no man can come to me
[52:16] except my father draws him and all that
[52:20] the father hath given me they will
[52:25] come he says they will come my sheep my
[52:29] doves they hear my
[52:32] voice okay a stranger they will not
[52:36] follow and what is the voice of God it's
[52:40] the word it's the word of God being
[52:43] manifest in the day and in the season
[52:45] that we're living in and what is the
[52:48] evidence that you actually have the
[52:50] spirit of God in you is when you can
[52:53] recognize the word that's being
[52:56] manifested and fulfilled right before
[52:58] your eyes amen God has a church God has
[53:02] declared there be a Rapture God has
[53:05] declared that there will be a people
[53:07] that will unite in the end time under
[53:11] the leadership and the voice of the Lord
[53:14] himself and it'll be his voice that she
[53:17] will recognize and that will transform
[53:19] her change her bring her under obedience
[53:22] under the leadership of the word for
[53:24] this day and and for this hour amen amen
[53:27] glory to God Amen God is dealing with
[53:30] this Earth and this generation at this
[53:34] time I want to repeat that God is
[53:38] dealing with this Earth this generation
[53:42] at this time you know a lot of people
[53:44] always want to be praising God for what
[53:46] he did back there and what he's going to
[53:48] do but they always you know most of the
[53:52] time fail to recognize what it is that
[53:54] he's doing right now
[53:57] and right now we've had signs and
[54:00] wonders that have been made uh available
[54:03] to us that that that are telling us
[54:06] things that are that are being declared
[54:08] in the heavens that are going to be
[54:10] manifest shortly here upon the Earth
[54:13] they're already in process as we read
[54:16] the scripture when it said when you see
[54:18] all these things coming to pass I don't
[54:21] know how much more is
[54:22] left I don't know how much more is left
[54:25] to be fulfilled before all of this
[54:28] culminates and we're going to be changed
[54:30] in the moment and in the twinkling of an
[54:32] eye do you know that we just experienced
[54:36] a couple of solar eclipses all right you
[54:39] know that the Earth is the only place in
[54:42] the universe that a full eclipse either
[54:46] solar or lunar is
[54:49] possible okay that just tells me that
[54:52] God is dealing with
[54:53] us this is the only place in the
[54:55] universe where where you can witness and
[54:58] and actually see a total so solar
[55:01] eclipse why because the sun is exactly
[55:04] 400 times larger than the moon and
[55:08] exactly 400 times further away from the
[55:13] earth and when the two of them based on
[55:16] that perspective it makes them look the
[55:19] same and God is speaking to us through
[55:22] that amen he's saying that the bride and
[55:25] the groom
[55:26] they are one when you see me he says you
[55:30] see the father he said all that was all
[55:33] that was in uh Christ was poured into
[55:36] the church amen and so when the moon
[55:40] gets in front of the Sun or the sun gets
[55:43] in front of the moon it's because they
[55:45] are declaring themselves to be
[55:47] one amen although there are other
[55:50] messages that are coming off these signs
[55:54] and we want to see the scriptural
[55:58] signs
[56:02] amen let's go to the next slide no not
[56:06] yet sorry I'll read a scripture in
[56:09] Psalms 19 verses 1 to5 it says the
[56:13] heavens declare the glory of God we're
[56:15] talking about the voice that follows the
[56:19] sign all right we're talking about a
[56:21] scriptural voice the heavens declare the
[56:24] glory of God and the firmament show his
[56:27] handywork day unto Day utth speech and
[56:30] night unto night showeth knowledge there
[56:33] is no there is no speech nor language
[56:36] where their voice is not heard their
[56:39] line is gone out through all the Earth
[56:42] and their words to the end of the world
[56:45] in them hath he set a tabernacle for the
[56:48] son which is as a bridegroom coming out
[56:51] of his chamber and rejoiceth as a strong
[56:55] man to run a race glory to God I believe
[56:59] he's speaking about the Bride of Jesus
[57:01] Christ right here there's nowhere where
[57:04] her voice is not going to be heard she's
[57:07] going to have the final say she's going
[57:09] to have the final voice she's going to
[57:12] be the one that's going to declare
[57:14] exactly what it is that God is doing in
[57:17] this particular generation and in this
[57:20] time and in this season amen praise God
[57:24] and so we rejoice in knowing that that
[57:29] God is is speaking about us everything
[57:32] that he needs to declare he's now going
[57:34] to declare it through his bride through
[57:37] his his church amen the Church of this
[57:40] day and of this hour everything that
[57:44] that I'm going to be bringing forth here
[57:46] today is what the lord has laid upon my
[57:49] heart I've had some Supernatural
[57:51] experiences with the Lord and I can tell
[57:54] you there's no way I could bring with
[57:56] conviction the things that I'm going to
[57:58] bring to you today unless I had those
[58:01] Supernatural experiences I'm not and
[58:04] let's get this clear here this is not
[58:06] about Pastor Dany bringing his
[58:09] experiences this is about uh us
[58:12] recognizing the things that God is doing
[58:15] in our day and that you have a part of
[58:19] it I have a part of it you're going to
[58:22] need to recognize where you fit into the
[58:25] whole place
[58:27] because by you recognizing where you fit
[58:30] you receive perfect Faith to live this
[58:33] message you will fall away if you do not
[58:37] have this kind of a supernatural walk
[58:40] with God Amen this is the kind of walk
[58:43] that if you don't experience Christ in
[58:46] the power of his resurrection in the day
[58:49] that you are living and you don't start
[58:50] to see Supernatural taking place around
[58:54] your life you are missing
[58:57] something this is going to be a a a
[59:00] supernatural event when the bride is
[59:02] taken off the Earth and we are already
[59:05] being
[59:07] changed we're we've already been
[59:09] raptured we've already been you know a
[59:11] lot of us have separated from our
[59:13] families and our and and our friends in
[59:15] the way that we used to you know be with
[59:17] them it's not that that we're trying to
[59:19] separate from them we're not we love
[59:22] them we want to be with them we want
[59:23] them to know but because God has placed
[59:26] his word in us to fulfill the word for
[59:30] this day then it's automatically going
[59:33] to happen that the the people around us
[59:36] they're going to think that we're kind
[59:37] of strange they're going to kind of find
[59:39] that what do you mean these Supernatural
[59:42] things what is it that you see in the
[59:44] heavens that we didn't see well just go
[59:48] back Jesus rebuked them he says you
[59:50] could see you know when when when the
[59:52] times were changing when this when the
[59:54] the the the the sun would CH you know
[59:56] the the the red sky in the morning would
[59:58] show that there was going to be you know
[1:00:00] uh rain and you can read the signs but
[1:00:02] then you cannot read the actual signs of
[1:00:05] the times the things that God is doing
[1:00:08] right here in your
[1:00:09] midst and so this is the thing that you
[1:00:12] know that that I want to make very clear
[1:00:14] here everyone must meet God personal
[1:00:19] amen there's absolutely nothing that I
[1:00:22] can do for you to to to make you see and
[1:00:26] experience the supernatural in the way
[1:00:29] that that I'm experiencing it and many
[1:00:31] of you are experiencing it you know when
[1:00:34] God speaks to you you know when God is
[1:00:36] directing you guiding you rebuking you
[1:00:40] directing your life amen you need to
[1:00:43] have that experience and when you know
[1:00:45] it's real nobody can take that away from
[1:00:48] you there's nobody on this planet amen
[1:00:52] go to the next slide now we looked at
[1:00:55] the church Church ages and we recognize
[1:00:58] and we declare that the church ages uh
[1:01:01] spiritually the church ages are
[1:01:05] over okay they're over so we're not
[1:01:08] looking for any other Messengers there's
[1:01:10] no there's no eighth human Earthly
[1:01:14] messenger amen okay the seventh Church
[1:01:18] age messenger was William Mariam
[1:01:20] brandham he fulfilled that and and that
[1:01:24] church age has come to an end we don't
[1:01:27] know if the Gentile dispensation has
[1:01:30] come to an end I'm not saying that it
[1:01:32] has and I'm not saying that it hasn't
[1:01:34] I'm just telling you that there is
[1:01:37] things happening right now that are
[1:01:40] declaring a an a supernatural change on
[1:01:44] the earth the world has gone into
[1:01:46] absolute gross Darkness Israel is under
[1:01:49] under some serious bombardment right now
[1:01:53] okay because it's it's a portion of the
[1:01:55] word that must be fulfilled okay just as
[1:01:59] as the as the true church she's going to
[1:02:01] be rejected in the same way she's not
[1:02:04] going to be accepted you know people are
[1:02:06] not going to just easily accept the fact
[1:02:09] that you belong to the true church not
[1:02:12] that you are the true church that Jesus
[1:02:14] Christ the body of Christ is the true
[1:02:17] church but because you've identified
[1:02:19] yourself with him and you've you've been
[1:02:22] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:02:25] Christ you receed the Holy Ghost and
[1:02:27] your life is manifesting his life that's
[1:02:30] the evidence that Christ is in you amen
[1:02:33] and so the ages are
[1:02:35] over uh and you know here we are and if
[1:02:38] we look at you know that Leo deia was to
[1:02:41] be this the the the shortest Church age
[1:02:44] it places us right here in
[1:02:47] 2024 an observation that's it not saying
[1:02:51] that this year is the last year it's all
[1:02:54] going to end this year I'm I'm not
[1:02:56] saying that remember God is his own
[1:02:58] interpreter he will make it plain amen
[1:03:01] so let's go on now so I want to look
[1:03:05] here now at uh the fact that um prophecy
[1:03:09] is not something that we're
[1:03:11] taught okay prophetic events are not
[1:03:15] things that we are taught they are
[1:03:17] events and things that
[1:03:20] we that that that we catch they're not
[1:03:24] taught they're caught okay Proverbs uh
[1:03:27] 252 it says it is the glory of God to
[1:03:30] conceal a thing but the honor of Kings
[1:03:33] is to search out the matter and so when
[1:03:36] you get deep into God and when you start
[1:03:38] to really search God to find out what it
[1:03:41] is that he's doing in this day and in
[1:03:42] this hour you start to look deeper you
[1:03:45] start to search deeper and you know when
[1:03:47] you start to search in the way that I've
[1:03:49] been searching lately with these signs
[1:03:51] that have been taking place I can't help
[1:03:53] but see God God's Perfection everywhere
[1:03:57] amen God's perfect numerology everywhere
[1:04:01] it's everywhere it's in every aspect of
[1:04:04] this ministry in our lives personally
[1:04:06] and and and you're going to see here
[1:04:08] today that that this is not some
[1:04:12] coincidence all right let's go on so in
[1:04:17] the next
[1:04:22] slide we were looking at uh go to the
[1:04:25] next slide
[1:04:27] we were looking at the cloud and the
[1:04:31] supernatural uh uh High ring Cloud that
[1:04:34] showed up in in on May the 17th in the
[1:04:38] Life Magazine this actually took place
[1:04:40] February the
[1:04:42] 28 okay
[1:04:44] 1963 when it actually showed
[1:04:47] itself uh over sunset
[1:04:49] Mountain and what we want to bring to
[1:04:52] your attention Okay and this is going to
[1:04:54] be just f act okay that I'm bringing now
[1:04:57] and then we're going to see how the Lord
[1:04:59] unveils it all but this Supernatural
[1:05:02] Cloud it was something that that took
[1:05:05] place um and Life Magazine packed it and
[1:05:08] what we want to look at is the dates we
[1:05:11] want to look at how the dates you know
[1:05:14] coincide with a lot of uh different
[1:05:17] dates um and things that happened within
[1:05:20] the Bible amen now the first one that we
[1:05:25] know
[1:05:26] okay
[1:05:30] was before we go to that let's let's
[1:05:32] just
[1:05:34] um let's just go through these these
[1:05:36] slides one at a time okay and take note
[1:05:39] of these dates May 17th
[1:05:41] 1963 okay the the cloud was was uh was
[1:05:46] there and it showed itself in the
[1:05:49] heavens for about 28 minutes okay um in
[1:05:54] the evening time
[1:05:56] uh it was photographed in many different
[1:05:59] areas
[1:06:01] okay
[1:06:04] um it showed up in Life magazine and I
[1:06:08] actually have a copy you can go to the
[1:06:11] next
[1:06:12] slide I actually have the the the
[1:06:14] physical copy of this Life Magazine I I
[1:06:17] left it at home because I was going
[1:06:19] through it and it was just amazing what
[1:06:21] what I saw in there okay but um we're
[1:06:24] just going to look at at all these dates
[1:06:28] and I want you to see the res uh the the
[1:06:31] the timing on everything okay and it's
[1:06:34] going to lead us into more here okay so
[1:06:41] um the next
[1:06:46] slide okay these are just pictures of
[1:06:49] the actual
[1:06:52] magazine okay
[1:06:55] and then you can go to the next
[1:07:03] one
[1:07:05] okay
[1:07:13] now brother brandham speaking
[1:07:16] here in the Feast of the trumpets he
[1:07:19] says then one day in Sabino Canyon while
[1:07:22] God called me early in the morning up
[1:07:25] there I was up with my hands in the air
[1:07:28] praying and a sword came into my hands
[1:07:31] you know that I stood there and looked
[1:07:34] at it just natural as my hand is now not
[1:07:37] knowing what it meant and it was left
[1:07:40] and it was left me with a voice that
[1:07:43] said this is the sword of the king now
[1:07:47] this event that took place on February
[1:07:49] the 28
[1:07:50] 1963 was a supernatural event of the
[1:07:54] mighty angel God himself Christ himself
[1:07:57] coming down to meet with William Mary
[1:07:59] and brandham in order to give him the
[1:08:02] commission to go uh to to Jeffersonville
[1:08:05] where he was going to uh Minister and
[1:08:08] open the Seven Seals of the Book of
[1:08:11] Revelations okay but he had this
[1:08:14] Supernatural event that that he's
[1:08:18] sharing um where he where he was talking
[1:08:20] about and this is what's giving us the
[1:08:23] reason why this all took place
[1:08:26] and then later when the angel of the
[1:08:28] Lord revealed it it was the word in the
[1:08:31] hand immediately after that the angels
[1:08:34] of the Lord appeared and told about the
[1:08:37] Seven Seals that I was to return back
[1:08:40] here to Jeffersonville and preach the
[1:08:44] Seven Seals and there if ever said
[1:08:49] anything that was inspired it it was
[1:08:52] that there where the angel of the Lord
[1:08:54] met us and the Bible becomes a new
[1:09:01] Bible so here
[1:09:03] now I want you to
[1:09:06] understand that his commission was to go
[1:09:09] back to Jeffersonville and open the
[1:09:11] Seven Seals the supernatural Mysteries
[1:09:14] that were to be revealed and his
[1:09:16] ministry fulfilled Revelations 10 1 to 7
[1:09:21] okay it was the introduction of the
[1:09:23] mighty Angel himself coming down in
[1:09:27] 1963 to meet with the body of Jesus
[1:09:31] Christ and so as we move along now uh
[1:09:35] we're going to go into the numerology
[1:09:37] and we're going to look at the timing of
[1:09:40] all these things now uh go to the next
[1:09:42] slide when we look at God's numerology
[1:09:45] we can see you know one is God you know
[1:09:48] who is G there's only one God two a
[1:09:50] witness three Perfection seven
[1:09:52] completion eight new day the law of the
[1:09:55] word uh 10 17 is a representation of
[1:09:59] Victory 24 worship and
[1:10:03] dedication life is 28 okay we're going
[1:10:06] to be seeing that number 28 very often
[1:10:09] here today okay because it represents a
[1:10:12] woman's cycle you know to bring forth
[1:10:15] life the 28 day cycle of a woman when
[1:10:18] she you know brings forth life and 30
[1:10:21] you know uh calling the public Ministry
[1:10:24] King David Jesus Jesus and then there's
[1:10:26] other numbers that go on from there
[1:10:28] there's 40 uh you know which which is
[1:10:30] testing and then there's 50 which is
[1:10:32] Jubilee all right and
[1:10:34] so some of the things that we want to
[1:10:37] take a look at here okay is that God's
[1:10:40] numerology is perfect you know brother
[1:10:43] Bram says here he says the end time sign
[1:10:47] seed he says three is the number of
[1:10:49] perfection we all know that three is
[1:10:51] God's number in his numerology God is
[1:10:54] known by his numbers three is perfection
[1:10:57] seven is worship 24 is worship 40 is
[1:11:01] Temptation 50 is Pentecost jubile so
[1:11:04] forth all his numbers his numbers the
[1:11:08] his numerals of God is perfected and is
[1:11:12] perfection God is perfected in his
[1:11:15] numbers amen praise God and so there
[1:11:19] will always be some
[1:11:21] numbers okay that are going to stand out
[1:11:24] more and today I'm going to draw your
[1:11:27] attention to some numbers that are going
[1:11:28] to stand out a little more than others
[1:11:33] okay so let's go to the next
[1:11:38] slide okay I'm going to read here in
[1:11:41] Genesis 7: 11 to2 it says here in the
[1:11:45] 600th year of Noah's life in the second
[1:11:49] month the 17th day of the month the same
[1:11:53] day where all the fountain mountains of
[1:11:55] the deep the great deep broken up and
[1:11:57] the windows of Heaven were opened and
[1:12:00] the rain was upon the Earth 40 days and
[1:12:02] 40 nights and so we know that it was it
[1:12:05] was the second month May
[1:12:08] 17th when this event took place in the
[1:12:11] days of Noah and you'll also notice that
[1:12:15] you know that it was May 17th that the
[1:12:18] Life Magazine was brought to the public
[1:12:25] about the supernatural Cloud being
[1:12:29] displayed in
[1:12:31] 1963 over sunset Mountain these
[1:12:35] correlations are not
[1:12:37] coincidence this was showing God's
[1:12:40] judgment God's timing God's placing of
[1:12:44] his servants identifying and showing
[1:12:47] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:12:49] forever we need to recognize these
[1:12:52] things and we will see these things rep
[1:12:55] repeat themselves the second month on
[1:12:57] the Hebrew calendar is actually may did
[1:13:01] you know that the first month is April
[1:13:04] and so the actual second month according
[1:13:06] to the scripture was actually may and
[1:13:09] when was this uh Life Magazine brought
[1:13:12] out May the
[1:13:14] 17th
[1:13:17] 1963 the the cloud appeared on Sunset
[1:13:21] Mountain February the 28th 1963
[1:13:25] I want you to notice the number 28 28
[1:13:29] represents life okay and so everything
[1:13:34] that we're talking about here today I
[1:13:36] want you to recognize that this is all
[1:13:39] around the Life of Christ it's all
[1:13:42] around the life of the church everything
[1:13:45] is relating to the life if you look at
[1:13:49] 1963 you will see that 19 + 6 + 3 equals
[1:13:56] 28 there it is again right life the
[1:13:59] cloud remains sunlit for 28 minutes
[1:14:03] after Sunset all right there it is again
[1:14:07] 28 Victory so so Life Magazine publishes
[1:14:12] the article on the cloud on May 17th
[1:14:17] 1963 17 representing victory in the
[1:14:21] Bible okay because to the people that
[1:14:24] recognize what God is doing in this day
[1:14:26] it's victory Amen to those that do not
[1:14:29] recognize 17 represents judgment
[1:14:33] represents
[1:14:34] rejection okay and so if we look at
[1:14:38] Matthew
[1:14:40] 17 verse
[1:14:42] 5
[1:14:46] okay we'll go to
[1:14:53] that and when they saw saw him they
[1:14:56] worshiped him but
[1:14:59] some
[1:15:01] disbelieved you see so This Cloud this
[1:15:05] Supernatural event that took place it
[1:15:08] wasn't for
[1:15:09] everybody even when Jesus himself
[1:15:12] appeared before them in the Supernatural
[1:15:15] when he rose and he stood there before
[1:15:17] them in that Supernatural body he was he
[1:15:20] was in he was surrounded by a cloud some
[1:15:23] actually believe that it was him but
[1:15:25] some didn't believe because this is not
[1:15:28] for
[1:15:30] everybody this that that has taken place
[1:15:33] in our day you see it's the foundation
[1:15:35] of our faith without you recognizing
[1:15:38] what God has done through a Vindicated
[1:15:41] profit and what has taken place in in
[1:15:44] our ministry in the bride's Ministry
[1:15:47] over the last 61 years you will fail to
[1:15:51] recognize what God is doing today
[1:15:54] without recognizing that he's the same
[1:15:56] yesterday today and forever you're going
[1:15:59] to miss everything that he's doing
[1:16:02] now and so the Life magazine article
[1:16:05] came out on May
[1:16:07] 17th which which was Victory to to the
[1:16:11] Believers but to those that rejected it
[1:16:14] it was
[1:16:16] judgment I want you to notice Matthew
[1:16:19] 28 is the resurrection chapter in The
[1:16:23] Book of Matthew there it is again 28
[1:16:27] life the resurrection and commission to
[1:16:30] the church
[1:16:32] acts acts 28 is the only other book in
[1:16:37] the New Testament that has 28 chapters
[1:16:41] and the book of Acts is all about the
[1:16:44] acts of the holy spirit in the church
[1:16:48] and what is the the holy spirit in the
[1:16:49] church the life amen it's the life of
[1:16:52] the church amen praise God
[1:16:55] God and so acts
[1:16:58] 217 and acts 2:28 and there's those two
[1:17:01] numbers again 17 28 second month second
[1:17:07] month I will pour out my spirit which is
[1:17:11] his life 17 and 28 and two is a witness
[1:17:16] okay out of those two same scriptures
[1:17:19] because it's all about God pouring out
[1:17:21] his Spirit into the church giving the
[1:17:23] church the life that it needs to be
[1:17:26] God's representative in this day and in
[1:17:28] this hour amen praise God and so here we
[1:17:32] go and we continue now in Acts 21:17 he
[1:17:35] says and it shall come to pass in the
[1:17:38] last day saith God I will pour out my
[1:17:40] spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and
[1:17:43] your daughters shall prophesy and your
[1:17:46] young men shall see visions and your old
[1:17:48] men shall dream dreams Joel 228 and it
[1:17:52] shall come to pass afterwards that I
[1:17:54] will pour pour out my spirit upon All
[1:17:56] Flesh see there it is again and your
[1:17:59] sons and your daughters shall prophesy
[1:18:01] your old men shall dream dreams your
[1:18:04] young men shall see Visions H Allelujah
[1:18:08] acts
[1:18:10] 2:28 thou has made known unto me the way
[1:18:15] of
[1:18:18] life aren't you like like can you see
[1:18:22] here that that these are not just
[1:18:24] scriptural
[1:18:26] coincidences but this is actually God
[1:18:29] showing himself in the Perfection of his
[1:18:32] word vindicating that that cloud that
[1:18:34] took place in 1963 was not just some
[1:18:38] other phenomena in the sky that could be
[1:18:41] explained away but this was actually God
[1:18:45] coming to the Earth to vindicate that he
[1:18:48] was going to do something that he was
[1:18:50] going to call a church that he was going
[1:18:52] to meet with the mystical body of Jesus
[1:18:55] Christ that's why when you look at the
[1:18:56] cloud you see it as a as as a cloud uh
[1:19:01] that that is is the head of Jesus Christ
[1:19:03] which is the head coming down to meet
[1:19:06] with the body of
[1:19:08] Christ amen praise
[1:19:11] God another thing that was very
[1:19:14] interesting is
[1:19:16] that right around that same time when
[1:19:20] this event took place there was another
[1:19:23] event that took place on the other side
[1:19:25] of the US in
[1:19:27] Hawaii there was a a
[1:19:30] rainbow that was
[1:19:32] photographed and the person that was the
[1:19:37] writer in the
[1:19:40] article of the Life Magazine on May the
[1:19:44] 17th
[1:19:47] 1963 wrote this article on these Moon
[1:19:51] beams it was like a rainbow that he
[1:19:54] described as Moon beams because of the
[1:19:56] sunlight and the reflection of the moon
[1:20:00] on the rainbow and it gave off what they
[1:20:03] called like a a
[1:20:05] rainbow and this
[1:20:07] individual under the
[1:20:10] inspiration of God not knowing god not
[1:20:14] remember Life Magazine was a big you
[1:20:17] know magazine back in those days it went
[1:20:19] it went all over the United States and
[1:20:22] they had different writers that would do
[1:20:23] different articles and and this
[1:20:26] particular article was written and it
[1:20:29] was placed on page
[1:20:32] 11 of the Life
[1:20:36] magazine that we're talking about
[1:20:39] here on page
[1:20:42] 112 was the actual article on the cloud
[1:20:48] okay so if you took the actual
[1:20:51] magazine and you and you were to take
[1:20:54] that particular page you can go to the
[1:20:56] next slide and you would look through
[1:20:59] that page this is what you would
[1:21:01] see you would see a a rainbow cloud
[1:21:07] over the head or The Cloud of
[1:21:13] 1963 and this was not a coincidence this
[1:21:17] only could have been
[1:21:19] God and I saw listen Revelations 101
[1:21:23] says and I saw another Mighty Angel come
[1:21:25] down from heaven clothed with a cloud
[1:21:29] and a rainbow was upon his
[1:21:33] head now somebody try to explain to me
[1:21:38] how
[1:21:40] that is a
[1:21:42] coincidence that's no coincidence that
[1:21:44] was nothing but God vindicating and
[1:21:48] showing that he was coming to the Earth
[1:21:51] to vindicate his word and to show
[1:21:55] himself and fulfill scripture and come
[1:21:57] to a people that would recognize his
[1:22:01] scriptural voice amen because William
[1:22:04] brandham preached on all of this he
[1:22:08] ministered on the Seven Seals he his
[1:22:11] whole purpose was to come and Minister
[1:22:14] the word of God so that a church could
[1:22:16] be called out of the mess that they were
[1:22:19] in in all of these denominational
[1:22:22] churches worldwide
[1:22:26] this was not a
[1:22:28] coincidence this was a supernatural
[1:22:32] visitation listen to brother Bram in
[1:22:35] 1962 he says
[1:22:37] here is this the sign of the end sir he
[1:22:41] says this Angel come down from heaven
[1:22:43] see the other seven angels of the seven
[1:22:46] churches was Earthly
[1:22:49] Messengers but this Angel all the
[1:22:52] messages finished when this Angel comes
[1:22:55] down this is Revelations 10 1-7 in the
[1:23:00] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:23:02] when he shall begin the sound all the
[1:23:05] mysteries of God were going to be
[1:23:06] finished and there was going to be a
[1:23:08] supernatural faith that was going to be
[1:23:11] released unto the church and the church
[1:23:14] was going to start to recognize who she
[1:23:17] really is by the supernatural calling of
[1:23:20] recognizing the scriptural voice that's
[1:23:23] calling her
[1:23:24] and he says here all the message is
[1:23:27] finished the seventh angel winds up the
[1:23:30] whole thing and this Angel comes not to
[1:23:33] the Earth he isn't a man from the earth
[1:23:36] as The Messengers to the church ages
[1:23:39] that's finished he
[1:23:41] says back then but this Angel brings the
[1:23:46] next announcement and an angel means
[1:23:48] messenger he comes down from heaven
[1:23:52] clothed in the pillar of of light cloud
[1:23:57] with a rainbow over his head and a
[1:24:01] rainbow is a
[1:24:04] covenant a covenant to who a covenant
[1:24:06] people did not did not God tell Noah
[1:24:09] that I will not destroy you by water
[1:24:11] anymore I make a covenant with you my
[1:24:14] people I'll be with you I will come for
[1:24:17] you I will declare myself to you I've
[1:24:20] made a covenant with a with a people in
[1:24:22] this day and in this hour that have
[1:24:24] recognized the word of God for their day
[1:24:27] and she's walking with
[1:24:29] God Amen praise God hallelujah so the
[1:24:33] Rainbow on page 111 and the cloud
[1:24:36] picture on 112 was not just some
[1:24:41] coincidence it was God declaring to the
[1:24:44] world back then and today again I'm
[1:24:48] bringing it as a reminder to you and to
[1:24:51] everybody that hears this that God has
[1:24:54] declared himself he declared himself in
[1:24:58] 1963 and he continues to declare himself
[1:25:02] in this day and in this hour through
[1:25:05] signs and wonders in the heavens amen
[1:25:08] praise God H
[1:25:10] Allelujah God was speaking and
[1:25:13] vindicating his voice through the
[1:25:15] ministry of William Maryam brandham back
[1:25:17] then in
[1:25:19] 1963 if there was ever anything that was
[1:25:21] anointed brother Bram said the Bible
[1:25:23] became a brand new Bible to him because
[1:25:26] it wasn't him that was opening the word
[1:25:28] now it was the mighty Angel himself he
[1:25:31] said that if he had to come and taught
[1:25:34] what he saw in the scriptures without
[1:25:36] the the the those angels coming in to to
[1:25:39] speak to him and tell him exactly what
[1:25:41] the interpretation was on the word he
[1:25:44] would have made a mess of
[1:25:46] it and we in the same way without the
[1:25:50] spirit of God without the Holy Ghost an
[1:25:53] an ano Anin in on a minister to to to
[1:25:56] minister the word of God and to to bring
[1:25:59] forth the word under that Supernatural
[1:26:02] anointing of the Holy Spirit you'll make
[1:26:04] a mess of God's
[1:26:10] word William brandham was told to go
[1:26:13] back to
[1:26:14] Jeffersonville and I want you to notice
[1:26:21] that on March
[1:26:26] the
[1:26:29] 17th he began to
[1:26:32] minister the Seven
[1:26:36] Seals he ended on March the
[1:26:43] 24th we just had two eclipses one in
[1:26:45] 2017 and one in
[1:26:49] 2024 now you you're going to need to let
[1:26:52] the Holy Spirit reveal to you you what
[1:26:55] it is that's going on and what it is
[1:26:57] that he's telling us over and over and
[1:27:01] over again in these in these perfect
[1:27:06] numbers the seventh
[1:27:10] seal is something that he
[1:27:13] preached on the eighth day if you go
[1:27:17] back and you actually count the numbers
[1:27:19] the seventh seal was on the eighth day
[1:27:23] okay and eth is new beginning E is
[1:27:27] eternity e is an eternal messenger
[1:27:30] that's now it's no longer William
[1:27:32] Branham it's the voice of the mighty
[1:27:35] Angel speaking through William Branham
[1:27:38] and speaking life into the
[1:27:41] church calling her placing
[1:27:44] her it was on July the 28th of that same
[1:27:49] year
[1:27:50] 1963 that brother Branham actually went
[1:27:54] and preached Christ is the mystery of
[1:27:57] God
[1:27:58] revealed well do you know that the
[1:28:00] seventh
[1:28:01] seal was actually fully preached in that
[1:28:05] message you go back and listen to that
[1:28:08] message he'll say that it was one of the
[1:28:10] most anointed messages it culminated
[1:28:14] absolutely everything about Christ being
[1:28:18] revealed through that message and
[1:28:21] exactly what God was was trying to do do
[1:28:24] with the church in the in the placing of
[1:28:27] the church in Christ having the
[1:28:30] preeminence in the church remember he's
[1:28:32] restoring Adam he's restoring eve and
[1:28:36] he's restoring the Earth and everything
[1:28:39] was covered in that message and right
[1:28:42] now we're in the restoration of Eve
[1:28:45] we're right in the midst of it she's
[1:28:47] been called she's been restored she's
[1:28:51] been
[1:28:52] placed and it happened
[1:28:54] in July on the 28th day there's that
[1:28:58] number again 28
[1:29:01] life
[1:29:03] 1963 you add those numbers together 28
[1:29:06] again life these are not coincidence God
[1:29:11] was choosing these particular days for a
[1:29:15] reason God is is perfect in everything
[1:29:18] that he does amen amen praise God when
[1:29:22] we look at even the ti Christ is the
[1:29:25] mystery of God revealed it's seven words
[1:29:28] in the title it happened in the seventh
[1:29:31] month and it happened on the 28th day
[1:29:34] God was finishing up something in the
[1:29:36] preaching of Christ The Mystery of God
[1:29:39] revealed he was he was placing it all
[1:29:43] into a Supernatural Ministry at that
[1:29:46] time and the bride was now going to be
[1:29:48] called personally each one would receive
[1:29:52] their calling they would recognize and
[1:29:54] hear their their their their name being
[1:29:56] called under this message you wonder
[1:30:00] what is it about this message you know
[1:30:01] people say Danny how come you follow
[1:30:03] this message I said it's because it's
[1:30:06] called my name it's because it's it's
[1:30:09] identified me as a part of the body of
[1:30:12] Jesus Christ I can't tell you how I
[1:30:15] heard my name but all I can tell you is
[1:30:17] that I recognize the word I recognize
[1:30:21] what God has done I recognize that God
[1:30:23] sent a a supernatural cloud in
[1:30:26] 1963 that God sent us a prophet that God
[1:30:29] opened the word that God opened the
[1:30:31] Seven Seals so many people are trying to
[1:30:34] interpret the Seven Seals out there and
[1:30:36] they've got all kinds of their own
[1:30:37] interpretations if you go back and you
[1:30:40] listen to William Branham and the
[1:30:42] opening of those Seven Seals it is so
[1:30:45] simple it is so clear but it has to be
[1:30:49] revealed to you
[1:30:52] personal and when you see it you can't
[1:30:55] help but see it
[1:31:01] simple right at the end of that message
[1:31:04] in 1963 on July the 28th brother brandom
[1:31:08] and you go back and listen he say he
[1:31:09] looked at the clock he says look it's
[1:31:11] exactly 2:00 the second pull has ended
[1:31:15] and the third pull is at hand now I'm
[1:31:18] not going to get into everything about
[1:31:19] the third pull but the third pull was
[1:31:22] all about the opening of the word to the
[1:31:26] church and that God now was going to
[1:31:29] supernaturally reveal himself and that
[1:31:32] people would start to hear their names
[1:31:34] they they they somebody would give them
[1:31:36] a track somebody would talk to them
[1:31:38] about a prophet somebody would show them
[1:31:40] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ they
[1:31:43] would show them how the word is the
[1:31:44] absolute and and all of a sudden
[1:31:47] everything just starts making sense like
[1:31:49] I said when brother Gabriel handed me
[1:31:51] that tape I didn't know that William ROM
[1:31:54] at the time the the person that was
[1:31:55] speaking was was a prophet I didn't
[1:31:58] understand that he was a prophet till
[1:32:00] maybe almost a year later what his true
[1:32:02] position was but something was speaking
[1:32:05] to me through those tapes and then when
[1:32:08] I came into the church and Pastor Simon
[1:32:11] was ministering the word something was
[1:32:13] speaking to my heart and and I couldn't
[1:32:15] understand why I could recognize it why
[1:32:17] I could see it why I believed it it just
[1:32:20] made perfect sense to me why because
[1:32:23] there was representation in us from
[1:32:26] before the foundations of the world to
[1:32:28] receive this message it's not for
[1:32:32] everyone it's only for those that are
[1:32:34] called Jesus said all that the father
[1:32:37] hath given me will come those whose
[1:32:40] names were written in the Lamb's Book of
[1:32:42] Life from before the foundations of the
[1:32:45] world they'll be able to see it they'll
[1:32:47] be able to hear it they'll recognize
[1:32:49] it amen praise God and so the the third
[1:32:54] pull now was was was activated and here
[1:32:58] we are we're all in the midst of it and
[1:33:00] we're still under the leadership of the
[1:33:01] third pull because the third pull is
[1:33:04] Jesus
[1:33:06] Christ
[1:33:07] now I'm just going to read you know um a
[1:33:11] scripture here from 2 Thessalonians
[1:33:13] because this is all about the opening of
[1:33:15] the word and understanding that it was
[1:33:18] that it was a supernatural Angel The
[1:33:21] Mighty Angel himself that has come down
[1:33:24] and in 2
[1:33:25] Thessalonians 1: 4-7 it says so that we
[1:33:28] ourselves glory in you in the Churches
[1:33:32] of God for your patience and faith in
[1:33:35] all your persecutions tribulations that
[1:33:37] you endure it's not easy to re to to to
[1:33:39] receive this message and to and to and
[1:33:42] to stand for this message and and and to
[1:33:45] stand the reproach of this message it's
[1:33:47] not easy but here he's saying here which
[1:33:49] is a manifest token of the righteous
[1:33:52] Judgment of God that ye may be counted
[1:33:54] worthy of the kingdom of God for which
[1:33:58] you also suffer seeing it is a righteous
[1:34:02] thing with God to recompense tribulation
[1:34:05] to them that trouble you and to you who
[1:34:08] are troubled rest with us when the Lord
[1:34:12] Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with
[1:34:15] his mighty Angels you see God revealed
[1:34:19] himself he made himself known the word
[1:34:22] is declaring it there there's a
[1:34:24] scriptural voice there's scripture that
[1:34:26] backs everything up that we are talking
[1:34:29] about here you know it's been uh 61
[1:34:33] years since the opening of The Seven
[1:34:35] Seals the church Body of Christ has come
[1:34:38] into her
[1:34:40] maturity and they and she's come to a
[1:34:42] place where she's starting to know what
[1:34:44] to do with the word she's recognizing
[1:34:47] that she has the
[1:34:50] word and she's coming to realize that
[1:34:53] she
[1:34:54] actually is the last voice and the final
[1:34:58] voice to this
[1:35:00] generation now go to the next
[1:35:05] slide back
[1:35:07] in 2000 or 1995 we moved into this
[1:35:11] church here and we were known as the
[1:35:13] Eagles cry
[1:35:15] Ministry we moved into a church on Bruce
[1:35:19] Dale and you know it was at that time
[1:35:23] that
[1:35:24] we had our church dedication in in
[1:35:26] August I believe it was August
[1:35:29] 1995 and you know a picture was taken
[1:35:32] and I want you to look at this picture
[1:35:34] here and I want you to know that that
[1:35:38] eagle that eagle Cloud that's in the
[1:35:41] picture
[1:35:42] there that was not something that we had
[1:35:45] designed and put into the
[1:35:48] sign that showed up when our
[1:35:51] photographer was taking pictures
[1:35:54] in preparation for our dedication and
[1:35:56] then he handed the picture to us and we
[1:35:59] looked at the picture and I mean it's
[1:36:01] it's just look can you see that head
[1:36:05] there it's just sitting right in the
[1:36:07] nest there and it's surrounded by a
[1:36:09] white cloud it's outlined by a white
[1:36:11] cloud now I looked at the scripture and
[1:36:16] and right away you know Matthew 24 is
[1:36:18] all about the end time you go back and
[1:36:21] look at Matthew 24 and then there's that
[1:36:24] 28 number
[1:36:25] again and the scripture says for
[1:36:28] wheresoever the carcass is there will
[1:36:31] the Eagles be gathered
[1:36:34] together now like I said these are
[1:36:38] Supernatural events and to a lot of
[1:36:41] people they're going to think oh what
[1:36:43] are you bringing that up for Danny I'm
[1:36:45] bringing it up because I identify myself
[1:36:49] as one of those Eagles that's feeding on
[1:36:52] the fresh revelation of God's word in
[1:36:55] this day and in this hour and I came
[1:36:57] under a Supernatural Ministry when I
[1:37:00] come under our former Pastor John
[1:37:03] Simon okay it was a Supernatural
[1:37:06] Ministry because I was under bondage I
[1:37:09] was under drug addiction I was under the
[1:37:12] slavery of the of the of the
[1:37:14] principalities and the dominions of this
[1:37:17] world and Jesus Christ Set Me Free
[1:37:20] through this ministry
[1:37:27] and I'm not talking about you know to
[1:37:29] show that this Cloud this was a
[1:37:31] supernatural
[1:37:33] event there's no question in our minds
[1:37:36] anybody that knows this this uh
[1:37:39] remembers this sign and when this took
[1:37:41] place it was Supernatural we rejoiced in
[1:37:44] it it was God showing and vindicating to
[1:37:48] us personally this is all about a
[1:37:51] personal walk with God this is where I'm
[1:37:52] going here today okay this is all going
[1:37:55] to culminate you're going to see why
[1:37:57] these things have been brought forth
[1:37:59] here today why God laid it upon my heart
[1:38:01] so strong amen and so in
[1:38:04] 1995 we moved uh into this church and in
[1:38:08] 2004 we we moved out of this church and
[1:38:11] I remember at the time when we were
[1:38:13] leaving the church you know it was like
[1:38:15] this all came back to me and it was like
[1:38:18] now the eagle is stirring the nest he's
[1:38:21] saying it's time to you to go go out and
[1:38:24] move into your public
[1:38:26] Ministry okay it's time for this church
[1:38:29] to to move on and you know and you know
[1:38:32] sometimes when the nest gets stirred and
[1:38:34] you get kicked out of the nest you know
[1:38:36] we were we ended up on Walker's line and
[1:38:39] it was like kind of like almost like a
[1:38:41] Wilderness kind of experience we were
[1:38:43] walking we were walking we didn't know
[1:38:46] where we were going we didn't have a
[1:38:49] church we didn't have a home we were
[1:38:52] like the children of Israel we were
[1:38:53] looking for that place where God was
[1:38:56] going to place us and and and and lead
[1:38:58] us and you know kind of like we we kind
[1:39:00] of kind of felt like kind of scattered
[1:39:02] and didn't know exactly what the Lord
[1:39:04] had in mind but then God comes on the
[1:39:07] scene again
[1:39:08] supernaturally and in
[1:39:11] 200 uh um s the church that we were
[1:39:15] staying in which was uh Pineland uh no
[1:39:19] it was East Presbyterian uh Church on
[1:39:23] ERS line they came and approached us and
[1:39:25] said hey we're going to be amalgamating
[1:39:27] with our church pin land Presbyterian
[1:39:30] which was this building and this church
[1:39:32] is going to become available for sale
[1:39:35] would you be interested in putting in an
[1:39:37] offer well when we looked at the
[1:39:40] property we said
[1:39:43] yeah we love this church are you kidding
[1:39:46] me but then I knew exactly that this
[1:39:50] church was you know was was was in a a
[1:39:54] number that was definitely not
[1:39:55] financially in the reach of this small
[1:39:59] flock here okay but with
[1:40:03] God With
[1:40:05] God all things are
[1:40:09] possible God was going to do something
[1:40:12] that that that we had no idea but With
[1:40:15] God all things are possible and so they
[1:40:17] just came to us and they said listen
[1:40:19] just come in with your best offer and
[1:40:22] that's what we did and we came in with
[1:40:24] our best offer which was about half the
[1:40:27] value of this property at the
[1:40:30] time there was offers that were 7 to
[1:40:35] 800,000 higher than our
[1:40:38] offer but then they turned around
[1:40:41] because the holy spirit
[1:40:43] said I call the shots
[1:40:48] here they they surrendered to the Holy
[1:40:52] Spirit and I thank God and we Rejoice
[1:40:55] for P for for that pin land Presbyterian
[1:40:57] and East Presbyterian for what they did
[1:40:59] because God LED them that they wanted to
[1:41:02] keep the church as a Ministry they
[1:41:04] wanted it to still be in the service of
[1:41:06] the Lord all the other offers that were
[1:41:08] coming in were for people that wanted to
[1:41:10] develop the property because it's a very
[1:41:12] desirable piece of property and it can
[1:41:14] be turned into multiple
[1:41:16] homes and you know this this property is
[1:41:19] now probably four to five I don't know5
[1:41:22] million dollars in
[1:41:24] value that was the grace of God God was
[1:41:28] doing something new and so in
[1:41:30] 2007 God gave us this church and it
[1:41:34] wasn't until 2012 that the Lord moved us
[1:41:38] in here because he was doing something
[1:41:42] new God was going to do something new
[1:41:45] right here on New Street and it's always
[1:41:48] been a supernatural Church saints of God
[1:41:52] you've got to recognize that that God
[1:41:53] has always been moving in our midst sure
[1:41:58] we have our trials sure we have our
[1:41:59] fights sure we've got to overcome things
[1:42:02] but that doesn't mean he's not with us
[1:42:05] that just goes to show how much he is
[1:42:07] with
[1:42:08] us amen praise
[1:42:12] God let's move
[1:42:14] on so now we're going to bring this home
[1:42:18] okay we're going to look at the two
[1:42:21] eclipses that just took place and we're
[1:42:22] going to see how these numbers are all
[1:42:25] over the place and how God's Perfection
[1:42:28] is in his numbers and hopefully you can
[1:42:32] see yourself in those numbers you know
[1:42:35] it it was in in uh 1918 was the last
[1:42:39] time that America actually witnessed a
[1:42:42] total
[1:42:44] eclipse okay and when you look at 1918
[1:42:48] you take the number 19 plus one plus 8
[1:42:52] and what do you get
[1:42:54] 28 there's that number of life again see
[1:42:57] God showing himself you know that was
[1:42:59] the last time that America experienced
[1:43:01] it in the same way that they experienced
[1:43:03] it just now where it actually went right
[1:43:06] across all of
[1:43:09] America God was calling the Gentiles now
[1:43:14] let's go to the next
[1:43:17] slide
[1:43:19] 2017 so when we look at 2017 the the
[1:43:23] Lord led me to Luke
[1:43:26] 207 when you look at 20 again 17 you go
[1:43:30] 20 + 1 + 7 equals 28 there's that number
[1:43:35] again okay and he beheld them and said
[1:43:39] what is this then that is written the
[1:43:42] stone which the builders rejected the
[1:43:45] same is become the head of the
[1:43:48] Cornerstone when that Supernatural
[1:43:51] Eclipse took place in 17 and we covered
[1:43:54] a lot of what happened during that
[1:43:57] eclipse and how it went over you know
[1:43:59] the the the seven Salems and and uh you
[1:44:03] know that God was declaring certain
[1:44:06] things you know to the earth I believe
[1:44:07] it was God calling the Gentile
[1:44:11] dispensation to repentance again you
[1:44:14] know in the form of a warning and for
[1:44:16] those who have recognized they turn to
[1:44:18] the Lord which is the word you know and
[1:44:21] and and they've recognized
[1:44:23] actually it was it was the seven Salems
[1:44:25] yes and then the seven Church ages you
[1:44:28] know we looked at all of that you know I
[1:44:30] don't want to go into all of that I'm
[1:44:32] just looking at how this particular
[1:44:35] scripture in Luke
[1:44:37] 2017 it's it's it's a a a a rejection
[1:44:41] scripture how they're rejecting The
[1:44:43] Headstone that's what they did when when
[1:44:45] those that rejected the cloud back in
[1:44:48] 1963 didn't realize that they were
[1:44:50] actually rejecting the Cornerstone The
[1:44:53] Headstone Christ himself when they
[1:44:56] didn't believe that William brandham was
[1:44:58] the prophet of Malachi 4:5 Revelations
[1:45:01] 107 that it was Christ himself that
[1:45:04] brother brandham had to go off the scene
[1:45:05] so that he could introduce Christ again
[1:45:09] to this generation just like John the
[1:45:11] Baptist he had to go off the scene he
[1:45:13] was also under the spirit of Elijah the
[1:45:16] first John William brandham the second
[1:45:18] Spirit of
[1:45:19] Elijah okay actually the third fourth
[1:45:22] Spirit of Elijah
[1:45:23] and then there's one more coming of
[1:45:25] Elijah because if you go back into the
[1:45:27] Old Testament God used Elijah five
[1:45:31] times
[1:45:33] okay and then we look at the next
[1:45:37] slide and this is
[1:45:40] 2024's eclipse and then you look at acts
[1:45:45] 2024 and the scripture says but none of
[1:45:47] these things move me neither count I
[1:45:51] myself my life dear unto my myself so
[1:45:54] that I might finish my course with joy
[1:45:57] and the ministry which I have received
[1:45:59] of the Lord Jesus to testify the gospel
[1:46:02] of the grace of
[1:46:04] God you see here we've been given a
[1:46:08] Ministry God is God is is reiterating to
[1:46:11] us that hey I gave you a
[1:46:14] Ministry I gave you the ministry of life
[1:46:17] I've given you the word for this day and
[1:46:19] for this hour and here I'm identifying
[1:46:22] my myself in you and he's and he was
[1:46:26] declaring there was things that were
[1:46:27] speaking out of that Eclipse back on on
[1:46:31] uh uh April the 8th that we need to find
[1:46:34] the scriptural voice for and so I
[1:46:36] started to search and I started to dig
[1:46:38] and then even while I'm sleeping the
[1:46:40] Lord would show me certain scriptures
[1:46:42] and I would just write them down and I
[1:46:44] would write them down and I would say
[1:46:45] yes Lord and then when I came across
[1:46:47] this and I saw there's got to be
[1:46:49] something for 2024 and there it was the
[1:46:52] ministry that he gave us he's given us
[1:46:55] the ministry but to the world that
[1:46:56] rejects it it's
[1:46:59] judgment the whole world has gone into
[1:47:01] darkness
[1:47:03] Saints there's no hope except for the
[1:47:06] coming of the Lord
[1:47:09] amen and so I went on and then I looked
[1:47:13] at you know God's perfect numbers and we
[1:47:15] already talked about this the Seven
[1:47:16] Seals were preached on March the 17th
[1:47:19] through to March the 24th there's those
[1:47:22] two numbers numbers again 2017 2024 but
[1:47:26] then when you take those
[1:47:28] numbers and you add them and you look at
[1:47:30] you just take now this just all the
[1:47:32] numbers and you go 2 + 0 + 1 + 7 equals
[1:47:36] what
[1:47:37] 10 then you look at 2024 you look at 2 +
[1:47:41] 0 + 2 + 4 equal 8 what do you get the
[1:47:46] next
[1:47:47] slide Revelations
[1:47:50] 108 and what is that scripture
[1:47:54] and the voice which I
[1:47:56] heard a type of the Bride from Heaven
[1:48:00] spake unto me again and said go and take
[1:48:03] the little book which is open in the
[1:48:05] hand of the Angel which standeth upon
[1:48:08] the sea and upon the Earth what came
[1:48:10] down put his foot upon the sand and the
[1:48:14] the sand and and upon the sea back in
[1:48:17] 1963 it was the mighty Angel himself and
[1:48:20] he had a rainbow over his head which was
[1:48:23] a covenant to who to the
[1:48:25] church and the church was going to be
[1:48:27] given a commission that she would
[1:48:30] fulfill Revelations 108
[1:48:34] to1 brother William Mariam brandham
[1:48:36] never took this scripture because it
[1:48:39] didn't pertain to him it pertained to
[1:48:43] you and me it's for our season it's for
[1:48:47] this hour God is revealing prophesying
[1:48:51] and speaking to a generation out there
[1:48:54] that need to know that the word of the
[1:48:57] Lord has been restored and the word is
[1:48:59] now in a
[1:49:01] people and she's preparing for a
[1:49:05] Rapture amen praise God when we look at
[1:49:08] this scripture we see it so clearly
[1:49:11] praise God Amen and
[1:49:14] so let's go
[1:49:19] on the church has recognized her
[1:49:23] position she's recognized her placing in
[1:49:26] the word of God H Allelujah amen now
[1:49:31] let's go to the next
[1:49:36] slide all of this being said and the
[1:49:39] reason why God has placed the voice in
[1:49:42] US is so that we can unite the bride of
[1:49:47] Christ This is a uniting time and
[1:49:51] there's signs that God is giving to this
[1:49:54] world that it's uniting time and season
[1:49:57] and there's going to be signs and
[1:49:59] there's going to be a voice that's going
[1:50:01] to that's going to be behind those signs
[1:50:04] amen praise God go to the next
[1:50:07] slide acts 2:17 to 21 and it shall come
[1:50:10] to pass in the last days saith God I
[1:50:14] will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh
[1:50:17] and your sons and your daughters shall
[1:50:19] prophesy what did we just look at
[1:50:21] Revelations 108

[1:50:25] scripture thou must prophesy again

[1:50:47] they shall prophesy and I will show
[1:50:49] wonders in the heavens above and signs

[1:50:55] and vapor and smoke listen all these
[1:50:57] things are happening right now there's
[1:51:00] volcanic eruptions that are taking place

[1:51:07] there's all you know like if if we start
[1:51:09] looking all these signs they're all
[1:51:11] happening the sun shall be turned into
[1:51:13] darkness it just happened again these
[1:51:16] are things that are happening and the
[1:51:17] moon into blood before that great and
[1:51:20] notable day of the Lord come

[1:51:32] people that are declaring that you need
[1:51:34] to call on the name of the Lord you need
[1:51:37] to receive Jesus Christ in this day and
[1:51:39] in this hour because this world is going
[1:51:42] into Absolute Total Chaos total
[1:51:45] tribulation there is no hope but the
[1:51:48] coming of the Lord the people need to
[1:51:50] know it they need it needs to be
[1:51:52] declared amen praise God
[1:51:55] hallelujah glory to God
[1:51:59] Amen listen to brother brandham
[1:52:02] here the purpose of the final voice I
[1:52:05] want you to recognize now we've just
[1:52:06] turned into the final stages of this
[1:52:09] message here today and I want you to pay
[1:52:11] attention brother Bram speaking here in
[1:52:13] uniting time and sign he says now we're
[1:52:15] talking of this uniting uniting time the
[1:52:19] sign of the uniting time see Jesus was
[1:52:23] here in this last scripture reading now
[1:52:26] he's referring to Matthew
[1:52:29] 16:4 where he's rebuking them because
[1:52:32] they couldn't recognize the the the
[1:52:34] signs of the times okay and here Jesus
[1:52:37] was here in this last scripture reading
[1:52:39] he was rebuking the clergy for not being
[1:52:42] able to discern the time or the sign of
[1:52:45] the time now that has always been a
[1:52:48] great thing to the people see to be able
[1:52:50] to discern the sign of the time that
[1:52:53] you're living in because God writes it
[1:52:56] plainly so nobody could Escape it now
[1:53:00] ordinarily I'd go back it plainly so
[1:53:04] nobody would Escape now ordinarily I'd
[1:53:07] go back and pick up from other ministers
[1:53:10] other Servants of the Lord in the Bible
[1:53:12] time like the sign of Noah in his time
[1:53:16] the sign of Daniel's time and so forth
[1:53:19] the different signs but I want to bypass
[1:53:23] that tonight to save time to be able
[1:53:26] that it's always been God's way to give
[1:53:29] them a natural sign of the time so that
[1:53:34] everyone would know just what time it
[1:53:38] was it is and these Pharisees should
[1:53:42] have known their time they should have
[1:53:45] known what the time was he said in
[1:53:48] another place if you would have known me
[1:53:51] you would have known my day see it's
[1:53:55] very a great thing that we understand
[1:53:58] see
[1:53:59] without understanding what was he saying
[1:54:02] here that that these things that God is
[1:54:05] doing and what I'm saying to you here
[1:54:06] today these things that God is doing in
[1:54:08] our midst declaring himself through the
[1:54:11] cloud and and through these Supernatural
[1:54:14] events that he's done in our lives that
[1:54:16] these are things that that that you need
[1:54:19] to recognize that that the people it
[1:54:22] just goes over their head they can't see
[1:54:25] the sign of of of the Resurrection they
[1:54:27] can't see that Christ is now alive in a
[1:54:31] church declaring itself he goes on here
[1:54:34] to say here in the same message now just
[1:54:36] think every man and all the astronomers
[1:54:40] people them days their clocks was the
[1:54:43] stars there was a Watchman went up on
[1:54:46] top of the tower and he would get up
[1:54:49] there and watch and he seen what certain
[1:54:52] Stars was in the certain constellations
[1:54:55] and they were passing he knowed what
[1:54:57] time it was you remember in the
[1:54:59] scripture what time it is Watchmen and
[1:55:02] the Watchman come back and told him what
[1:55:05] time it was God's got Watchmen in this
[1:55:08] hour We're God's Watchmen we're watching
[1:55:11] we're seeing we're recognizing these
[1:55:13] signs these times these Supernatural
[1:55:15] eclipses that have that have been taking
[1:55:17] place and the Watchman come back and
[1:55:20] told him what hour it was see they kept
[1:55:23] time by the Stars Now isn't it strange
[1:55:27] that these stars were exactly in line
[1:55:29] for three men and nobody else saw
[1:55:34] it isn't it the same he says nobody else
[1:55:38] s see just exactly in line now you could
[1:55:42] you can be in so in line with the
[1:55:44] scripture see when those stars become in
[1:55:47] unity United themselves together in this
[1:55:50] constellation three men were're also
[1:55:53] United at the same time and you can be
[1:55:55] so United with God in his word until
[1:55:59] these things become
[1:56:01] realities and you can see them and know
[1:56:04] that they are
[1:56:07] true has it become a reality to you amen
[1:56:11] is this a reality that God has called us
[1:56:14] that we're in the last listen we're in
[1:56:16] the end time of the end
[1:56:18] times amen this is the greatest time of
[1:56:21] decep ception and if there was ever
[1:56:23] going to be a time of total deception
[1:56:25] it's going to be right now and don't be
[1:56:28] looking out there into all the different
[1:56:30] denominational churches they're A
[1:56:32] Million Miles Away we need to look at
[1:56:35] what's going on right around us and we
[1:56:38] need to realize that there's people that
[1:56:39] are
[1:56:40] sleeping they're not recognizing the
[1:56:42] signs of the times brother brah says it
[1:56:45] needs to become a reality the sign of
[1:56:49] the time he says you might look right
[1:56:51] over top of of it say ah
[1:56:55] nonsense but to you it isn't
[1:57:00] nonsense to you you're United with the
[1:57:04] word and here it is then it's it's
[1:57:07] absolutely light brother Pat when when
[1:57:11] when you see this sign Unite with the
[1:57:14] believer and that's who I'm addressing
[1:57:17] this to is the believer that's who I'm
[1:57:20] speaking to this this afternoon it's to
[1:57:22] the believer amen for for for the
[1:57:26] unbeliever will never see
[1:57:29] it oh my and what a rebuke it would be
[1:57:33] if he was on Earth today to many of our
[1:57:36] clergy today who cannot read this sign
[1:57:41] the signs that we're reading daily here
[1:57:43] at the Tabernacle and seeing the things
[1:57:47] and others reading it and seeing the
[1:57:49] handwriting on the wall and yet many
[1:57:52] just ignore it and don't even see it at
[1:57:54] all it's nothing to them at all they
[1:57:57] don't even notice
[1:58:00] it what an hour we're living in Saints
[1:58:04] what an hour glory to God Amen thank you
[1:58:09] Jesus
[1:58:12] listen

[1:58:18] cometh with clouds and every eye shall
[1:58:21] see him and they also which pierced him
[1:58:24] and all kindreds of the Earth shall

[1:58:39] almighty hallelujah praise God
[1:58:42] Amen I want you to go to the next
[1:58:48] slide on April the 8th
[1:58:53] 2024 at exactly 3:03
[1:58:57] p.m. on that Monday I was driving along
[1:59:01] the
[1:59:02] 407 and I pulled over to the side of the
[1:59:05] road I I just realized that I wasn't
[1:59:08] going to make it home the traffic was so
[1:59:10] bad so I pulled over to the side of the
[1:59:12] road I was there for about three or four
[1:59:15] minutes and then the lights came up
[1:59:17] behind me and it was a police officer
[1:59:20] and I was there like this looking with
[1:59:23] the glasses on waiting for the event to
[1:59:26] come and I I hear
[1:59:29] this and I'm there and I'm
[1:59:32] looking and I look over and it's a
[1:59:34] police officer with a big
[1:59:36] smile he says and I put my window down I
[1:59:39] said oh hi officer I had my those
[1:59:41] glasses
[1:59:41] [Laughter]

[1:59:46] you can't stop here he says you got to
[1:59:48] move along I said oh no problem he says
[1:59:51] thank you
[1:59:53] got up started driving couldn't get off
[1:59:55] the highway all of a sudden it was so
[1:59:56] jammed up I had to pull over again now
[1:59:59] there was like about 80
[2:00:01] cars and he's way back there and I can
[2:00:05] see him way back there the lights are
[2:00:07] going on and he's going from where I
[2:00:08] said by the time he gets here this
[2:00:10] eclipse is
[2:00:14] over and
[2:00:16] so I started taking pictures and the
[2:00:20] Holy Spirit led me to just take a few
[2:00:23] pictures and it wasn't until after that
[2:00:26] I looked at this picture and I realized
[2:00:29] that there was something there and if
[2:00:32] you look at the cloud it's almost you
[2:00:36] know the cloud of 1963 except it's
[2:00:40] looking the other
[2:00:41] way because if you look at the
[2:00:44] cloud you go to the next slide real
[2:00:47] brief you'll see that he's looking to
[2:00:49] the right if you go to the
[2:00:52] go back now to the other one it's
[2:00:54] looking to the left and so I thought
[2:00:58] okay where's the scripture there and so
[2:01:01] the Lord led me to look into the the two
[2:01:04] thieves that were on the cross one was
[2:01:07] on the left one was on the right and I
[2:01:09] found that the good thief was crucified
[2:01:11] to Jesus's right according to tradition
[2:01:16] and the other Thief was crucified to his
[2:01:18] left and so for this reason the dep
[2:01:21] itions of the crucifixion of Jesus often
[2:01:24] Show Jesus head inclined to his right
[2:01:26] showing his acceptance of the good
[2:01:29] thief I believe it was in
[2:01:32] 1963 that that God came down and was
[2:01:36] looking favorably to those that were
[2:01:39] that were sinners like just like you and
[2:01:41] me it was the opportunity for us to to
[2:01:45] say Lord remember
[2:01:47] me but here now in in uh 2024
[2:01:52] here comes another cloud and I'm not
[2:01:53] making this oh this has got to go around
[2:01:55] the message now and it's going to be the
[2:01:57] cloud and oh brother BR brother Danny is
[2:01:59] making himself special or anything like
[2:02:01] no I'm just showing you
[2:02:04] observations and I am expressing to you
[2:02:07] what the Holy Spirit showed me in my
[2:02:10] heart and the scriptures that he led me
[2:02:12] to and these were the scriptures behold
[2:02:15] he cometh with clouds every eye shall
[2:02:17] see him and so forth okay and those
[2:02:21] which pierced him and all kindreds and
[2:02:22] then and they also led me to these
[2:02:24] scriptures and if we look at second
[2:02:27] Peter because I looked at my at my
[2:02:29] picture and it showed me the exact time
[2:02:32] that I took it and it was at 3:03 p.m.
[2:02:36] it was about 15 minutes before the
[2:02:38] actual eclipse this was in the process
[2:02:42] of the eclipse taking place and I looked
[2:02:45] up second Peter
[2:02:48] 3:3 and it says knowing this first that
[2:02:51] there shall come in the last days
[2:02:56] scoffers walking after their own lust
[2:02:59] and saying where is the promise of his
[2:03:01] coming I said hallelujah praise the name
[2:03:05] of the Lord there's a lot of people oh
[2:03:08] yeah these signs yeah another eclipse
[2:03:10] okay this happens no God is again
[2:03:16] declaring to our hearts through
[2:03:19] Supernatural experiences and like I said
[2:03:21] said at the very beginning you need to
[2:03:23] be having Supernatural experiences with
[2:03:26] your walk with God and you need to be
[2:03:28] watching you need to be looking these
[2:03:30] things are happening around us all the
[2:03:33] time but it's to them that watch he says
[2:03:37] he says here where where is the promise
[2:03:39] of his coming for since the fathers fell
[2:03:41] asleep all things continue as they were
[2:03:44] from the beginning of the creation
[2:03:52] but
[2:03:54] yet in Luke chap
[2:03:56] 23: 42- 43 and he said unto Jesus Lord
[2:04:01] remember
[2:04:03] me go to the next
[2:04:05] slide Luke
[2:04:07] 23:43 and he said unto Jesus Lord
[2:04:10] remember me when thou comest into thy
[2:04:12] kingdom and Jesus said unto him verily I
[2:04:15] say unto unto thee
[2:04:18] today today you know this can be a brand
[2:04:21] new new day for you I don't know
[2:04:23] whoever's listening in today you can be
[2:04:26] with Christ today you can accept the
[2:04:29] things that God has done in our day and
[2:04:32] recognize the supernatural moving of the
[2:04:35] holy spirit amen praise God go back to
[2:04:39] the previous
[2:04:40] slide when we look at three it's the
[2:04:43] number of perfection 1963 you look at 1
[2:04:46] 1963 there's three all over the
[2:04:50] place you look at the number of
[2:04:52] perfection in 2024 here it here here it
[2:04:56] happens again another Supernatural sign
[2:04:59] right here in
[2:05:00] 2024 the three-fold purpose of
[2:05:03] God it's all threes 61 years later here
[2:05:07] we are 6 + 1 equals 7 the number of
[2:05:13] completion I mean there's so many
[2:05:15] different things that we can look at
[2:05:17] here
[2:05:27] and I I close here just another five to
[2:05:29] S
[2:05:33] minutes from the message an exposition
[2:05:36] of the seven Church ages the leoan
[2:05:40] church age brother brandham says in the
[2:05:41] Dark
[2:05:42] Ages the word almost entirely lost to
[2:05:47] the people but God sent Luther with the
[2:05:50] word
[2:05:52] the Lutheran spoke for God at that time
[2:05:55] but they organized and again the pure
[2:05:57] word was lost for organization tends
[2:06:00] towards dogma and Creeds and not simple
[2:06:04] word they could no longer speak for God
[2:06:08] then God sent Wesley and he was the
[2:06:10] voice with the word in his day the
[2:06:13] people who took his Revelation from God
[2:06:16] became the living Epistles read and
[2:06:18] known of all men for their generation
[2:06:21] when the Methodist failed God raised up
[2:06:23] others and so it has gone on through the
[2:06:27] years until in the last days there was
[2:06:29] another again another people in the land
[2:06:32] who under their message will be the
[2:06:34] final voice to the final age yes sir the
[2:06:38] church is no longer the mouthpiece of
[2:06:42] God it's its own
[2:06:46] mouthpiece so God is turning on her he
[2:06:49] will confound her through the prophet
[2:06:51] and the bride for the voice of God will
[2:06:55] be in her yes it is for it says in the
[2:07:00] last chapter of Revelations uh 17 the
[2:07:03] spirit and the bride say come once more
[2:07:07] the world will hear directly from God as
[2:07:10] at Pentecost but of course the word
[2:07:13] bride will be repudiated as in the first
[2:07:18] age it's not going to be easy to live
[2:07:21] this message Saints it's not going to be
[2:07:24] easy to recognize what what
[2:07:27] responsibility God has given us but when
[2:07:30] you start to look at God's Perfection
[2:07:34] and you start to see that that you're
[2:07:37] walking with the Living God this is not
[2:07:39] just a a simple church that you belong
[2:07:42] to this is a supernatural mystical body
[2:07:46] of Jesus Christ then you start to see
[2:07:48] and recognize all kinds of things I was
[2:07:51] laying in bed this morning I woke up
[2:07:54] just after 4:00 this morning I was
[2:07:56] laying there and the Holy Spirit just
[2:07:58] started pouring in all kinds of thoughts
[2:08:00] into my mind and he started to say he
[2:08:03] says look he says you you you've been
[2:08:05] looking into all my numbers you've been
[2:08:07] looking into my perfection he says he
[2:08:09] says look at you he says I want you to
[2:08:12] know something you were born in the
[2:08:14] second month on the 24th
[2:08:17] day I said yeah 24 there's that number
[2:08:21] again
[2:08:22] second month if you take the two and the
[2:08:24] zero and you reverse them you got
[2:08:27] 2024 what's he doing he's just telling
[2:08:29] me about that that you know what you're
[2:08:32] in my mind you're a part of my thoughts
[2:08:36] he says look at your wife she was born
[2:08:38] October the 8th
[2:08:41] 1961 I said yeah he says 108 the woman
[2:08:47] the bride I gave you a wife she was from
[2:08:50] before the Found Glory to God hallelujah
[2:08:54] I said Thank You Lord Revelations 108

[2:09:00] word of the Lord for this day and for
[2:09:02] this hour she's got a word amen glory to
[2:09:06] God I'm 63 years old and I was born in
[2:09:11] 1961 and when you add the two together
[2:09:13] it's 124 and there's that 24 again I
[2:09:16] said yep there you are Lord 24 in 2024

[2:09:24] yeah that's right I said praise God he
[2:09:27] says yeah you were also publicly
[2:09:29] ordained on March the 17th I said oh
[2:09:32] yeah he says yeah 17 there's a number
[2:09:34] again and if you go back and you look at
[2:09:37] Luke 3:17 look at John 3:17 look at
[2:09:40] Matthew 3:17 it was Jesus Christ moving
[2:09:44] into his public Ministry it was God
[2:09:47] saying I am pleased with him ye Oh Glory
[2:09:50] to God I said Lord you're everywhere not
[2:09:54] me him it's him it's about him bringing
[2:09:58] his word to his people declaring his
[2:10:01] word in this hour that it's always been
[2:10:04] Jesus Christ it's his public Ministry
[2:10:07] it's not our public Ministry but he's
[2:10:10] going to show us one of these days he's
[2:10:13] going to put us before the people he's
[2:10:14] going to let us know that I am with you
[2:10:17] and you shall know that I am your God
[2:10:19] and that you are my people I said Thank

[2:18:03] coming up from the 7th to the 9th of
[2:18:06] June amen and we like all those who will
[2:18:11] be attending amen there's a sign up
[2:18:14] sheet on the board and I have brother
[2:18:15] Mike here who's going to give us some
[2:18:17] instructions and some details of what is
[2:18:20] going to be taking place amen come on
[2:18:23] brother
[2:18:29] mik okay first of all um concerning what
[2:18:33] we just heard how many can say that's
[2:18:36] nothing but the
[2:18:38] truth it is it's the truth um but what
[2:18:43] does it mean it means life to the bride
[2:18:48] she's alive she's well he's alive he's
[2:18:50] well well he's living in his bride
[2:18:52] that's what it means brother
[2:18:54] sister you want to talk about
[2:18:55] supernatural in this
[2:19:13] day I don't know how this works
[2:19:17] here but there's life nevertheless all
[2:19:20] right
[2:19:21] so okay towards the uh the banquet what
[2:19:24] we just wanted to make this
[2:19:26] announcement uh this has to do with the
[2:19:30] Sunday dinner
[2:19:32] right you know whether you've been
[2:19:34] invited or not it's By Invitation or
[2:19:36] whatnot but we just realized that on
[2:19:39] that at that dinner time after the
[2:19:41] dinner we the the thoughts are just
[2:19:44] starting to become clear as to what
[2:19:45] we're going to be doing that day and one
[2:19:48] thing we know for sure right
[2:19:51] is that we know like like brother
[2:19:53] Desmond he wants to say
[2:19:55] something where is
[2:19:57] he anyway he wants to say something
[2:20:00] right am I right oh yeah brother coffee
[2:20:04] is gonna want to say something sister so
[2:20:07] and so is gonna want to say something
[2:20:08] and brother so and so and this one's
[2:20:10] gonna want to everybody's GNA want to
[2:20:12] say something right am I right why
[2:20:14] wouldn't you right so we just thought
[2:20:17] boy this could be a long after
[2:20:21] afternoon especially if everybody gets
[2:20:24] up and says Pastor Simon you are a great
[2:20:28] pastor we love you all that's true but
[2:20:30] if you keep if that's all we hear all
[2:20:32] afternoon it's going to be a long
[2:20:35] afternoon so here's what we we thought
[2:20:38] would be a good idea you've heard the
[2:20:40] phrase that a pictured um what's it
[2:20:44] what's that that phrase is worth a
[2:20:46] thousand words right so what we want to
[2:20:49] do is uh use words to draw a picture all
[2:20:54] right so when it comes my time to say
[2:20:58] something or your time to say something
[2:21:00] here here's what would be good I don't
[2:21:02] know if this is we're going to be able
[2:21:03] to do this or not but with your
[2:21:05] cooperation perhaps what we would ask is
[2:21:08] you can
[2:21:09] say God bless you Pastor Simon we love
[2:21:12] you we appreciate you yeah okay and then
[2:21:15] but we would like to have a story from
[2:21:20] everybody not a long story just just a a
[2:21:24] two or three minute blurb about
[2:21:27] something that took place in brother
[2:21:30] gab's life for instance brother Gabe
[2:21:32] comes up he says it was approximately
[2:21:38] 1998 when Pastor Simon came and spoke to
[2:21:42] me or preached from the pulpit and said
[2:21:45] something something something and this
[2:21:47] is what took place right I mean we have
[2:21:50] those experience expences do we not all
[2:21:53] right all the way up and what what I'd
[2:21:55] like to do is is try to um put it all on
[2:21:58] chronological order so
[2:22:01] from as far back as I go as uh
[2:22:06] 1988 so we do have a few that are a
[2:22:08] little bit ahead of me but we can start
[2:22:11] there and have a story in 1988 1990 92
[2:22:16] try to put it in chronic logical order
[2:22:18] go all the way up everybody gets to say
[2:22:20] something you can say your nice things
[2:22:23] but you have a little story and it'll
[2:22:24] paint a picture of his ministry for the
[2:22:27] last I didn't do the math but anyway
[2:22:30] whatever the
[2:22:31] whatever okay for this past few years
[2:22:34] right so is that do that sound
[2:22:35] reasonable so everybody gets a chance to
[2:22:37] say something a short
