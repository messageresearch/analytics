[34:44] you
[34:45] Saint I'm casine actually I came from
[34:49] Kenya I'm new here in
[34:52] barington and as he said my testimony I
[34:57] can say
[34:58] it's
[34:59] amazing how I found this church it's by
[35:03] God's
[35:04] grace I live nearby I was passing to go
[35:09] in this shopping center near here so as
[35:12] I was passing I saw the bellboard
[35:16] actually to me it wasn't a message
[35:18] believer church but it was a church so
[35:23] CU I decided now I have stayed in the
[35:26] house for long without going to Church
[35:28] in fact I have been attending a online
[35:31] service from my country all through like
[35:34] four five months since I came here and
[35:37] now I thank the Lord talk to me and told
[35:41] me what if you have a Ministry in you
[35:45] which is supposed to help the church
[35:47] what will you do if you you will
[35:49] continue fellowshipping in the online so
[35:53] I heard oh God this is not me I have to
[35:56] look for the church when I went in the
[35:58] Google The Google didn't show me this
[36:01] church in fact I I could say the scao
[36:05] and Bramton and it was very far for me
[36:07] so I told God you know what I'll go to
[36:10] the nearby church that's where you will
[36:13] bless me from CA even the prophet said
[36:16] uh if you go to the church it's not that
[36:18] must be a message believer's church but
[36:21] whever is preached there take the meat
[36:24] leave the bones so that's why I told my
[36:27] God you know what this church near me
[36:29] it's where I am going and in fact I W up
[36:33] in the morning I prepared my myself I
[36:36] came here the song leader somehow
[36:38] mentioned prophet he didn't mention the
[36:41] name of the Prophet but he mentioned
[36:43] Prophet I was like H what is this and
[36:47] now when the preacher came mentioned
[36:49] Propet Branham I told myself oh my God
[36:53] this is where I belong so Lord you have
[36:55] le me finally to where I belong and so
[36:59] now I decided I'll be fellowshipping

[37:07] every weekend which I'll not be
[37:09] fellowshipping I'll be coming here and I

[42:12] thanks and we give you all the praise in
[42:16] Jesus Christ's name amen praise God and
[42:19] so let's read our
[42:21] scripture same scripture that we're
[42:23] reading in St Luke chapter 2 verse 49
[42:27] and he said unto them how is it that
[42:29] that ye sought me wish ye not that I
[42:33] must be about my father's
[42:37] business amen God bless you you may be
[42:42] seated you know we read last week um we
[42:45] we were looking
[42:50] whoops computer decides to do a reboot
[42:53] right in the
[42:55] midst all right well any anyways um we
[42:59] will um correct this problem here in a
[43:05] moment but um we were talking last week
[43:08] and we we were looking at the scriptures
[43:10] and one of the scriptures that we looked
[43:11] at was Revelations 10 8- 11 and we
[43:16] realize that that that's that's the
[43:18] ministry that God has given us God has
[43:21] placed a Ministry in us to be Witnesses
[43:24] and to prophesy to take the word that
[43:27] was delivered unto us in our day amen to
[43:32] take the word that God uh provided for
[43:35] us in this day and in this hour and for
[43:37] us to take that word to feed on that
[43:40] word uh eat the word it's going to be
[43:43] sweet in our mouths because we're going
[43:45] to realize that my God this is the
[43:47] Living God this is the Living Word this
[43:50] is the word of God this is not just a
[43:53] religion uh I I didn't just come into
[43:55] contact with with uh some other you know
[43:59] Christian church but I've actually come
[44:00] into contact with the Living God Amen
[44:04] and now the Living God wants to use me
[44:07] wants to speak through me wants to
[44:09] anoint my life so that I can be a
[44:12] witness he said that you would be
[44:14] Witnesses in uh throughout all of the
[44:17] earth and that you would carry a witness
[44:20] of the word remember we're not Witnesses
[44:23] of doctrines we're not interested in in
[44:26] in enforcing Doctrine unto people this
[44:30] word that God has given us has got
[44:32] nothing to do with doctrines although
[44:35] there are many doctrines in the word but
[44:38] it has to do with the Living Word coming
[44:41] into our lives and fulfilling and
[44:44] manifesting the
[44:46] doctrines it's bringing the doctrines to
[44:49] life amen it's manifesting them before
[44:52] the people so that they can see that the
[44:54] word is a Living Word it's not a man's
[44:58] teaching it's not something that that
[45:00] that we have to uh convince somebody of
[45:03] but it is actually the Living Word that
[45:06] God has placed within our lives amen
[45:09] praise God and so we were looking at
[45:13] that and um uh I'm almost there I'm
[45:16] going to be right back to where I left
[45:18] off here praise God and so that we can
[45:22] uh move quickly and smoothly because I
[45:25] want to I want to be able to to deliver
[45:27] everything that the Lord has placed on
[45:29] my heart this morning and I want to I
[45:31] I'd like to finish this this series okay
[45:34] today part three and it'll be completed
[45:38] today by God's
[45:40] grace and so
[45:44] um let me just get
[45:48] there technology is amazing but
[45:51] sometimes it can be a little
[45:54] frustrating just decided to do a Rebo
[45:57] right
[46:00] then unusual but God
[46:03] knows we all need a reboot every now and
[46:06] then praise God
[46:10] hallelujah amen thank you
[46:20] Jesus praise God
[46:28] we're getting
[46:43] there all right praise the Lord
[46:51] Jesus and
[46:53] so now I want to um I want to read this
[46:57] um quote here that that we ended off
[46:59] with last week the prophecy that calls
[47:02] out the bride the true church for our
[47:05] day there's a prophecy that God has
[47:07] placed within us that calls the true
[47:09] church and we had read this quote these
[47:12] men
[47:16] why why was they called and was put in
[47:19] this condition these Pharisees by Jesus
[47:23] said in vain you worship me you worship
[47:27] him genuine worship true worship from
[47:30] their hearts in vain you worship me why
[47:34] teaching for Doctrine their tradition of
[47:37] man therefore you make the Commandments
[47:40] of God of no effect to the people if I
[47:43] taught you the Methodist message it
[47:45] would take no effect on you this is
[47:48] bride time it's if Moses taught the
[47:51] message of Noah it would take no effect
[47:54] if Jesus taught Moses message
[47:57] it would take no effect because the
[47:59] predestinated seed are laying there that
[48:03] will only be watered by that type of
[48:07] water that's given for that seed see it
[48:11] won't grow any other condition it must
[48:15] be in the condition that grows it so in
[48:19] other words it's got to be the word and
[48:22] the the revealed word for the day that
[48:25] we're living in because in you there's a
[48:28] seed there's an attribute of God to
[48:31] respond to that word you cannot respond
[48:35] to Luther's message although Luther's
[48:38] message of justification was a part of
[48:41] the word but it wasn't enough to call
[48:44] you you wouldn't you there wasn't enough
[48:47] in Wesley's message to call you that's
[48:50] why while you were in the world you know
[48:53] years ago before you actually came to
[48:55] this Revelation in this message you knew
[48:58] Christianity you had gone to church some
[49:01] of you maybe some didn't at all but you
[49:04] you you knew about the word but you
[49:07] didn't know that you were actually in
[49:10] the word and that there would be a time
[49:12] where there would be water of God's word
[49:16] that would come in its season that would
[49:19] actually awaken you now that's why I
[49:21] couldn't understand I was you know I
[49:24] remember in 1992 and '93 just before the
[49:27] word came and awakened me out of my
[49:31] Amnesia there was many people I had my
[49:33] nephew he was reading the Bible you know
[49:36] he had split up with his wife and he was
[49:37] living in the store upstairs and he'd be
[49:39] reading his Bible every day and while
[49:42] I'm T you know I would say okay you come
[49:43] to the market with me downtown you know
[49:46] and he'd be reading the Bible and he's
[49:47] telling me about the word and tell and
[49:49] I'm just saying oh man bible thumper you
[49:52] know this guy's driving me crazy you
[49:54] know he's my nephew and he needed a
[49:56] place to live live right now so I gave
[49:57] him a place you know and then I had a
[49:59] driver who was a 7 Day ad you know like
[50:02] he was like like Church of God and and
[50:05] he would be constantly telling me about
[50:07] you know uh you need to go to church and
[50:10] you need to go on Saturday and if and
[50:13] all these people you see these people
[50:14] that go to church on Sunday they're all
[50:16] lost he'd be telling me this and he'd be
[50:19] telling me you need to come to church
[50:21] you need to come to my church you know
[50:23] until finally you know like I was
[50:25] listening to my refu and then you know
[50:28] there was some discussions once in a
[50:30] while about you know religion and then
[50:33] you'd hear about the Catholic teaching
[50:35] and then you know and I and you know it
[50:37] was just going on and finally one day I
[50:39] said to my driver you know Carlo he you
[50:42] know he was telling me I said
[50:44] listen
[50:46] enough you know because he'd be talking
[50:48] to the people that were delivering to my
[50:50] truck too you know he was too fanatical
[50:53] I said listen that's enough I said said
[50:56] if God wants me he'll come and talk to
[50:59] me not you and I said that firmly to him
[51:03] and it shut him up but you see we didn't
[51:07] realize that we were around the word and
[51:10] we were hearing the word but it wasn't
[51:13] our time it wasn't our season yet to
[51:15] receive the
[51:17] word and so here brother Braham speaking
[51:20] he says the word must deliver the word
[51:23] bride
[51:25] Church Okay so there's a church in the
[51:27] last days we're in the end time people
[51:29] are talking about the end time you know
[51:31] there's all the churches are going into
[51:33] chaos and and things are happening right
[51:35] now and here we are in the end time but
[51:37] there's a word that's ordained to the
[51:40] word church those that are actually
[51:44] ordained just like in the days of Luther
[51:47] there was a group of people that heard
[51:49] Luther's message and it they responded
[51:51] to it they came out from the Catholic
[51:53] church and the Protestant churches
[51:55] started and and then Wesley was the
[51:57] continuation for sanctification Luther
[52:00] had had justification Wesley had
[52:03] sanctification and then the Pentecostals
[52:05] come along and here we've got the moving
[52:07] of the Holy Spirit the gifts of God
[52:10] manifesting speaking in tongues healing
[52:12] manifestations and so forth and that was
[52:15] another Revival but that was not the one
[52:18] that you were going to be called out
[52:20] under you had a messenger come in the
[52:24] 20th century which would turn the hearts
[52:27] of the children back to the faith of the
[52:30] fathers and there was a scripture
[52:32] ordained for your day that's why Malachi
[52:35] 4 says I send unto you that's right you
[52:40] personally amen not to your church not
[52:42] to your organization not to your priest
[52:45] not to your friends and family but to
[52:48] you personal amen and so the church has
[52:52] got to be delivered out of her abro died
[52:57] for Christ so in other words now you've
[52:59] got all these churches all these
[53:02] different denominations and Christ is on
[53:05] the scene now calling out from all of
[53:08] those
[53:09] churches those that will recognize the
[53:12] word for their
[53:15] day now some observations I was
[53:18] listening you know to the
[53:20] message last night this morning
[53:22] recognizing your day and its message and
[53:25] the Lord just laid these thoughts on my
[53:27] heart this morning just before I was you
[53:30] know going to get ready to come to
[53:31] church and I put them all down and I
[53:33] thought okay praise God I was listening
[53:35] to the message and it struck me and
[53:37] brother Braham
[53:39] says this has been the now if you go
[53:41] back and listen to recognize your day
[53:43] and its message okay in uh
[53:46] 1965 I believe it is 64 okay he says
[53:50] this has been the hardest
[53:53] message that I've had to put together
[53:56] and I'm I'm just listening to his
[53:58] opening comments before he actually gets
[54:00] into everything he said the devil was
[54:02] fighting me he says he was fighting him
[54:06] you know to to to to bring that message
[54:09] and but notice the scripture that he
[54:12] took okay now you go back and you think
[54:15] okay well recognizing your day and its
[54:17] message and we know what that all means
[54:19] but look at the scripture that he took
[54:22] he took the scripture from Hosea chapter
[54:25] 6 and he said says come and let us
[54:27] return unto the Lord for he hath torn
[54:31] and he will heal us he has smitten and
[54:34] he will bind us
[54:36] up after two days will he revive us in
[54:39] the third day he will raise us up and we
[54:43] shall live in his sight and if you go on
[54:46] he goes on and he reads all of that and
[54:48] you wonder you know if you if you go
[54:50] back and you actually think about it you
[54:52] think well that's an unusual scripture
[54:54] for recognizing your day and it's
[54:56] message but you know as I was listening
[54:59] to him when you get you know like as you
[55:02] go on brother brandham talks about
[55:05] Israel these are all in his opening
[55:07] comments he wanted to draw our attention
[55:11] to the time and I thought oh that's
[55:14] interesting aren't we in an interesting
[55:16] time right now she is the time piece he
[55:22] says he wanted the audience to realize
[55:25] and recognize the time he says that the
[55:28] time that we're living in here listen to
[55:31] what he says here he says we are dealing
[55:33] today upon a Sunday school lesson that I
[55:37] want you to realize and recognize the
[55:40] time that we're
[55:42] living we're just about to run out and I
[55:47] thought boy are we ever that much closer
[55:50] to running
[55:51] out this is back in
[55:54] 1964 as you see and then by this you
[55:59] should know the very hour and time and
[56:02] sign and message that you are to
[56:08] receive do you hear that you need to
[56:11] recognize that there's a message that's
[56:15] got to go to the church I'm not talking
[56:18] about just this church there's people
[56:20] online that are hearing this that are
[56:22] listening in on this message that that
[56:25] need to know that there 's a message
[56:27] that is going out to the church world
[56:31] and they need to know that this message
[56:33] is the message for
[56:35] today for this hour amen he goes on here
[56:39] he says brother brandham he starts
[56:41] talking about now if you listen you go
[56:42] back and listen he starts talking about
[56:44] the signs in the Moon and the Sun and
[56:48] how you know he says and the positions
[56:51] of the nations of that particular time
[56:54] and I thought wow Lord look at this look
[56:57] at the positions of the Nations right
[57:01] now right now today here we are in the
[57:04] midst of a world that's in in in global
[57:07] war there's Global chaos and the the the
[57:11] the nations are in in all kinds of
[57:13] different positions right now that are
[57:15] setting up to fulfill absolutely the
[57:19] word of God and the prophecy for this
[57:21] hour he talks about how the hierarchy of
[57:24] Rome left and went back to to Palestine
[57:27] well that to me just says that they're
[57:29] going back to Palestine in other words
[57:31] they're supporting Palestine they're
[57:33] they're they're they're they're bringing
[57:35] now listen of course we are human and we
[57:38] feel the emotional uh disturbance and
[57:42] and the burden of the of the people that
[57:44] are being killed and you know war is a
[57:47] terrible thing there's always the
[57:49] casualties that come as a result of war
[57:52] and many times it's innocent women
[57:55] innocent children innocent people we
[57:57] know that and it's terrible but here we
[58:01] also know that the scripture is very
[58:03] clear and that we know that Israel is
[58:06] God's time piece God's chosen people
[58:10] God's way of of communicating to the
[58:13] world the time and the season that we
[58:16] are presently living in and it's
[58:19] important and he talks about only the
[58:22] only light that was left when he was
[58:25] talking about the moon moon and the and
[58:27] the sun was was the minority Church
[58:29] would have a certain amount of
[58:33] light and it's a small light we're a
[58:37] small group people think we're kind of
[58:40] strange they think we're fanatical about
[58:43] the word of God but there always were
[58:46] individuals in every dispensation in
[58:49] every time in every book of the Old
[58:51] Testament God had Witnesses God had
[58:54] individuals God had had prophets that
[58:57] were anointed by the word of God in
[59:00] their particular day to bring forth
[59:03] God's voice God's mind God's desires for
[59:07] the world and for the for the world at
[59:09] that time and the conditions of the
[59:11] people it was God coming with his Mercy
[59:15] to speak to the needs of the people and
[59:17] here today there's a minority there's a
[59:20] small light he said it would be a very
[59:22] small light of truth that would be
[59:25] revealed he talked about the mysterious
[59:27] Cloud which was the mighty Angel we know
[59:30] coming down in
[59:32] 1963 to open the mysteries of the Seven
[59:35] Seals and how those seals were open and
[59:38] all the mysteries of God have been
[59:40] released and you are one of those
[59:42] Mysteries you are one of those
[59:44] individuals that were called under that
[59:46] anointed word of God that was brought
[59:49] forth you didn't realize what was going
[59:51] to call you you didn't know you know
[59:53] like Tim says he was at the altar there
[59:55] in the Catholic church and he and he
[59:57] heard a voice say you won't find me here
[1:00:00] you didn't realize that God was was
[1:00:02] actually a living God but he was
[1:00:04] somewhere you needed to find out where
[1:00:07] his provided place was you need it
[1:00:10] wasn't it's not in a church it's not in
[1:00:12] a building it's in the body of Christ
[1:00:15] amen it's when you come personal and you
[1:00:18] meet God lip to ear and he speaks to you
[1:00:21] and he calls you he delivers you from
[1:00:23] your
[1:00:24] circumstances nobody's going to tell me
[1:00:26] that God is not a living God and a real
[1:00:29] God if you've witnessed and you've
[1:00:31] experienced him you know what I'm
[1:00:33] talking about how the Lord has been
[1:00:36] calling a gentile bride he says here he
[1:00:40] talked about the seven sabbaths and now
[1:00:43] after the seven sabbaths would come the
[1:00:46] day of atonement listen here he's
[1:00:49] speaking here in same message
[1:00:50] recognizing your day and its message now
[1:00:53] we noticed last Sunday there there was
[1:00:56] preaching the feast days that there was
[1:00:59] a feast of
[1:01:00] Pentecost and between the Feast of
[1:01:02] Pentecost and the Feast of trumpets that
[1:01:05] was a long period of time exactly 50
[1:01:09] days between Pentecost and the Feast of
[1:01:12] trumpets and 50 days which Pentecost
[1:01:16] means 50 it was sheath waving or the
[1:01:21] ingat the first fruits of the Harvest
[1:01:25] was brought in in and we see it was in
[1:01:28] tyght back there with the natural first
[1:01:31] fruits representing first fruits of the
[1:01:34] Holy Spirit to be poured out upon the
[1:01:37] people that's why we are we we
[1:01:39] experienced
[1:01:41] Pentecost when you came to this
[1:01:44] Revelation your experience was what God
[1:01:47] was doing which was Pentecost which was
[1:01:50] God calling out a gentile church out of
[1:01:53] the Gentile Nations and so receiving
[1:01:57] Pentecost means you receive the Holy
[1:02:00] Ghost you receive the Holy Ghost which
[1:02:03] is the word of God in your day so you
[1:02:08] receive the word that's what came to you
[1:02:12] that's what we're talking about here all
[1:02:14] right God God now watch and we find out
[1:02:17] then that them 50 days was received by
[1:02:20] the
[1:02:20] Gentiles which God called from the
[1:02:23] Gentiles a people for his name that's
[1:02:26] why the church is a woman and she is the
[1:02:29] bride the wife of
[1:02:32] Christ the Feast of Pentecost and we
[1:02:36] have been going through that long Feast
[1:02:39] of Pentecost now actually from the 50
[1:02:42] days would be exactly seven
[1:02:46] sabbaths okay and seven sabbaths
[1:02:49] represent the seven Church ages that
[1:02:51] we've come
[1:02:53] through to the to to be called in the
[1:02:56] time of the Pentecostal Feast of
[1:02:59] Pentecost to call a people from the
[1:03:02] Gentiles for his name so we are the
[1:03:05] church that's being called for his name
[1:03:07] now at the end of these seven sabbaths
[1:03:10] and this is what caught my
[1:03:12] attention which has been there was to be
[1:03:15] a day of atonement which was the seven
[1:03:19] trumpets and the Seven trumpets was to
[1:03:22] call a day of mour back for or the
[1:03:26] sacrifice or the atonement and we find
[1:03:29] out then that
[1:03:32] Israel the seven trumpets pertained only
[1:03:36] to Israel and it's a time of atonement a
[1:03:40] time of mourning Israel is going to
[1:03:43] receive this
[1:03:45] message which is Jesus Christ in the
[1:03:48] present stage of his ministry in this
[1:03:51] day and it's going to bring them into
[1:03:53] the season of The Feast of atonement and
[1:03:57] mourning that they actually crucified
[1:04:00] their
[1:04:01] Messiah they're going to be awakened and
[1:04:04] how close are we to that
[1:04:07] now why is this all coming out in such a
[1:04:11] way and and being expressed and and and
[1:04:14] here we are in the condition in the
[1:04:16] world and Israel and the situation that
[1:04:19] it's under and how it's under attack and
[1:04:22] how everything is coming together
[1:04:24] perfectly so so that Israel will come to
[1:04:28] their day of
[1:04:30] atonement but the bride of Christ before
[1:04:33] all of that takes place she goes in a
[1:04:40] Rapture and so for us I only lay this in
[1:04:44] here as a background to bring us into a
[1:04:49] clearer understanding of the day that
[1:04:51] we're living in so that we can recognize
[1:04:54] now what it is that God is doing for us
[1:04:57] now here let's move on there was three
[1:05:01] stages uh to it as I said the Mar's age
[1:05:04] of the Martyr and then the stage of the
[1:05:08] reformers and now the calling out time
[1:05:11] he's talking about from the time of
[1:05:14] Pentecost all the way up to where we are
[1:05:17] now okay there was the time of the mar
[1:05:20] the Dark Ages many had to die for this
[1:05:23] gospel oh there was many Martyrs those
[1:05:26] that had to stand on the word of God but
[1:05:29] the but the you know but the enemy would
[1:05:31] destroy he would try and destroy the
[1:05:33] Holy Spirit you could never destroy the
[1:05:36] Holy Spirit in the people you could
[1:05:37] destroy the people but the spirit of God
[1:05:40] is eternal it would move on that's why
[1:05:44] there's it's not you that's coming under
[1:05:47] uh you know sometimes you're under
[1:05:49] oppression you come under the the the
[1:05:51] reproach for the word of God and people
[1:05:53] call you fanatical you're you're a
[1:05:54] little too fanatical about God it's okay
[1:05:58] they don't realize that it's not you
[1:06:00] it's the spirit of God that you've
[1:06:02] received in you that's going to stand on
[1:06:04] the word it's going to it's it's the
[1:06:07] it's the the witness that God is a just
[1:06:11] God God is not going to judge based on
[1:06:13] which church you went to God is going to
[1:06:16] judge you according to his word his word
[1:06:19] is a Living Word it's not a word that
[1:06:21] can be changed he's the same yesterday
[1:06:24] today and forever H amen and so here we
[1:06:28] are and then the stage of the reformers
[1:06:31] and now the calling out time when
[1:06:34] finished at leod Dean age according to
[1:06:37] Revelations
[1:06:39] 10 the mystery of all the Bible would be
[1:06:42] known to the bride is that right
[1:06:44] Revelations 10 now listen close uh-huh
[1:06:47] bride called called out by the word
[1:06:52] that's why you're never going to hear me
[1:06:54] coming up with you know or any real
[1:06:56] minister of God coming up with their own
[1:06:58] ideas they're just going to tell you
[1:07:00] what the word says they're just going to
[1:07:02] tell you exactly what the because it's
[1:07:04] the word that's going to call you out
[1:07:07] it's simple baptism in Jesus name you
[1:07:10] look into the scripture acts 238 it's
[1:07:13] right there it's plain as repent be
[1:07:16] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:07:18] Christ and then you read on and and it
[1:07:20] said 3,000 were added to the church that
[1:07:23] day and they were baptized that way way
[1:07:26] Peter was right there he was the one
[1:07:28] that that that cried out to them be
[1:07:30] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:07:31] Christ for the remission of your sins he
[1:07:34] was there when Jesus said go in ye into
[1:07:36] all the world because you know preachers
[1:07:38] will go back and they'll say to you know
[1:07:39] they'll say to me yeah but you got to
[1:07:41] read Matthew
[1:07:42] 28:19 I go yeah I read it Jesus says go
[1:07:46] ye on into all the world baptizing in
[1:07:48] the
[1:07:49] name of the father and of the son and of
[1:07:52] the Holy Ghost and Peter was right there
[1:07:55] the same one that was on the day of
[1:07:57] Pentecost was right there so why is it
[1:08:00] that Peter when on the day of Pentecost
[1:08:02] said in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:08:05] because Jesus said the name of the
[1:08:09] father he said to Philip if you seen me
[1:08:12] you've seen the father so what's the
[1:08:14] father's name the Earthly name was Jesus
[1:08:16] Christ amen in all that you do in the
[1:08:19] name do it all in the name of Jesus
[1:08:21] Christ you see it's simple to the to to
[1:08:24] the to the true church you can't deny
[1:08:26] that you you can't believe Trinity
[1:08:29] Trinity is not in your vocabulary
[1:08:31] there's no such thing the Lord thy God
[1:08:33] is one you see me you see the father
[1:08:37] Jesus made it very clear I and the
[1:08:40] father are one he never said
[1:08:43] to praise God anyway so here it is the
[1:08:48] Bible would be known to the bride is
[1:08:50] that right all the Mysteries would be
[1:08:53] made known and and the bride bride she'd
[1:08:56] be called out by the word Christ himself
[1:09:00] calling out the bride the church making
[1:09:04] plain Hebrews 138 that he's the same
[1:09:07] yesterday today and forever does the
[1:09:11] same and is the same I'm going to repeat
[1:09:14] that he does the same and he is the same
[1:09:18] don't be putting your own interpretation
[1:09:20] on the word of God it's of no private
[1:09:24] interpretation
[1:09:26] listen here he goes on to say here in in
[1:09:27] the visible Union of the Bride he says
[1:09:30] but you remember when it went down and
[1:09:32] the grain begin to ripen that you find
[1:09:35] before that grain can ripen everything
[1:09:38] in that stock has to be dead in other
[1:09:41] words all the the all the teachings all
[1:09:44] the doctrines all the things that you
[1:09:47] thought were the truth even though you
[1:09:49] were in a church remember a church is
[1:09:51] like a like a like a stock of corn every
[1:09:54] you know that corn that grain is going
[1:09:56] up through the stock and it's a carrier
[1:09:58] of the
[1:09:59] seed of the true word of the absolute
[1:10:03] perfect word of God and the church was
[1:10:05] carrying the seed but the but the church
[1:10:08] stock was not the seed it died and fell
[1:10:12] away and you can't bring any of that any
[1:10:15] of your own teachings any of your own
[1:10:17] doctrines any of your own ideas you
[1:10:20] can't bring that into the body of Christ
[1:10:24] you've got a let all of that die that's
[1:10:27] why you must be born again you cannot be
[1:10:33] born again when you want to hold on to
[1:10:36] an old life you got to let that old life
[1:10:40] go
[1:10:41] completely and then the spirit of God is
[1:10:44] the new life that comes in you by the
[1:10:47] Holy Ghost and then when you look at the
[1:10:49] word you read the word you can only say
[1:10:53] Amen to the word let my word be truth
[1:10:57] and every man's word I don't care if
[1:10:59] he's a priest if he's a theologian he's
[1:11:03] got 27
[1:11:04] llds if he says Trinity he's deceived
[1:11:09] and he is not of God Amen it's as simple
[1:11:13] as that if he gets the new birth he can
[1:11:16] become born again and the spirit of God
[1:11:19] will replace his own Spirit his own
[1:11:22] doctrines his own ideas and and it'll
[1:11:25] it'll only say what the word says amen
[1:11:27] praise God and so Hallelujah you can't
[1:11:30] can't you see where we're standing life
[1:11:33] is in the grain again Christ is in the
[1:11:36] word seed word again and the church is a
[1:11:40] is an isolated segregated group of
[1:11:43] individuals that are filled with the
[1:11:45] Holy Ghost and they will not deny the
[1:11:48] word of God Amen life is in the grain
[1:11:50] what is it just exactly like the same
[1:11:53] grain that went in the ground
[1:11:56] that same Jesus in Bride form same power
[1:12:00] same church same thing same word the
[1:12:04] same word sucked up through these and
[1:12:07] come out here and come to a head here
[1:12:11] and all the life that come through here
[1:12:13] picked up its people now it's forming up
[1:12:17] into a head for the
[1:12:20] Rapture hallelujah praise
[1:12:23] God all that the father hath given me
[1:12:26] will come that's right not one of them
[1:12:29] is going to be plucked out of my hand
[1:12:31] Jesus said my sheep hear my voice
[1:12:35] they're not going to follow any other
[1:12:37] voice amen praise God now here he says
[1:12:40] in Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[1:12:42] now we see the Promise being
[1:12:44] fulfilled Christ the true headship going
[1:12:48] in coming in his bride so now it's
[1:12:52] Christ remember it's always been Christ
[1:12:55] from Genesis remember the faith of the
[1:12:58] fathers it's always been Jesus Christ
[1:13:01] it's been Elohim the self-existent one
[1:13:04] in the in the beginning was the word the
[1:13:05] word was with God the Word was God it's
[1:13:08] always been Christ coming down through
[1:13:10] the Old Testament in in mzc who do you
[1:13:13] think mzc was MDC was Jesus Christ in
[1:13:17] the form of a man that he he he came and
[1:13:20] visited Abraham it was still the same
[1:13:23] God the Lord God it was Jes Jesus
[1:13:25] Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of
[1:13:28] the New Testament amen praise God and so
[1:13:32] he says here it's the same coming in his
[1:13:34] bride doing the same works that he did
[1:13:37] at the beginning and making ready and
[1:13:40] fulfilling his word as he did at first
[1:13:44] in John 14:12 he that believeth on me
[1:13:47] the works that I do shall he do also
[1:13:52] then the head and the body are becoming
[1:13:55] one in works and in sign and in life
[1:14:00] Vindicated by God himself through his
[1:14:03] promised word for the last
[1:14:07] days he promised this in the last days
[1:14:10] now if you're
[1:14:12] spiritual you'll catch it you see what
[1:14:15] he's saying you need to put on your
[1:14:18] spiritual thinking cap and and take away

[1:15:30] Sunday what do you got I don't know
[1:15:33] 100 what's the difference when Jesus was
[1:15:37] on Earth he had a dozen followers and
[1:15:39] the rest of them were saying he was a
[1:15:41] freak he was he was be above they would
[1:15:44] call him a devil what's the difference
[1:15:47] we're not looking for that we're looking
[1:15:49] for the
[1:15:50] word have you heard the word for your
[1:15:53] day have you re recognize what God is
[1:15:55] doing that can change and transform your
[1:15:58] life
[1:16:00] now right now not some not some you know
[1:16:05] great uh positive mental attitude yeah I
[1:16:08] believe in positive attitude I believe
[1:16:09] in in speaking positive I believe all
[1:16:12] those things that you should speak
[1:16:14] positive and have those things but if
[1:16:16] all you preach is positive and positive
[1:16:20] and Jesus is positive and even in your
[1:16:22] sin Jesus is positive that
[1:16:25] you you need to hear that you need
[1:16:28] deliverance from your unbelief cuz sin
[1:16:31] is unbelief drinking smoking lying
[1:16:34] cheating committing adultery all those
[1:16:36] things it's just unbelief in the word of
[1:16:39] God oh I can't come to your church
[1:16:41] because I got too much sin no you need
[1:16:43] to come into the house of the Lord where
[1:16:45] the word of God will cleanse you and
[1:16:47] Purge you of your
[1:16:49] sin
[1:16:51] hallelujah it's not about numbers here
[1:16:54] he says the first thing was that God
[1:16:56] wanted to reveal himself to the people
[1:16:59] he couldn't do it as a great Jehovah God
[1:17:01] who covered all space Time and Eternity
[1:17:04] he could not he is too great to ever be
[1:17:07] revealed to people because it would be
[1:17:10] too
[1:17:11] mysterious how could that great being
[1:17:14] that never did begin and that you went
[1:17:18] beyond the cycles of hundreds of
[1:17:20] billions and trillions and trillions of
[1:17:23] years of light space
[1:17:25] and on out into Infinite into the
[1:17:29] eternity and a great creature that was
[1:17:32] all that and still is but he wanted but
[1:17:36] what he wanted to do he loved
[1:17:43] fatherhood for he was a
[1:17:46] father and that's why we've come to know

[1:20:02] sermons that are preached the songs that
[1:20:04] are

[1:21:56] let's go to slide number
[1:22:06] three Colossians even Colossians 1:26-27
[1:22:11] even the mystery which hath been hid
[1:22:14] from ages and from Generations but now
[1:22:18] is made manifest to his Saints to whom
[1:22:21] God would make known what is the riches
[1:22:24] of of the glory of this mystery among
[1:22:26] the Gentiles listen if there's a mystery
[1:22:29] Saints don't be looking for all kinds of
[1:22:32] mysteries don't be looking to to you
[1:22:34] know oh it's it's a treasure that's
[1:22:36] hidden in in this certain place you know
[1:22:38] there's people that are still looking
[1:22:40] for the cup that Jesus drank from the
[1:22:43] Shroud the nails they've got some
[1:22:46] somewhere I don't know if they've got
[1:22:47] them somewhere in in the Vatican they've
[1:22:49] got and they and and they make it
[1:22:52] something they it's it you know what
[1:22:55] you'll be there and it'll be a total
[1:22:56] mystery until you
[1:22:58] die because the mystery is not the
[1:23:02] nails the mystery is where the nail
[1:23:04] Prince went and what the nail Prince
[1:23:07] represented and what it represented is
[1:23:10] right here amongst the Gentile which is
[1:23:11] Christ in you the hope of glory he went
[1:23:15] to the cross and shed his blood was
[1:23:17] nailed to the cross so that the spirit
[1:23:20] of God the Holy Ghost could come back on
[1:23:23] you in your your day your day don't be
[1:23:27] looking back there and people are always
[1:23:29] praising God for what he did back there
[1:23:32] yes he went to the Cross but it was a
[1:23:34] finished work from before the
[1:23:35] foundations of the world what are you
[1:23:37] going to do with that you see it
[1:23:39] happened before you were even born it
[1:23:42] happened before it actually happened
[1:23:43] here on the earth because he was slain
[1:23:46] from
[1:23:47] before the foundations of the world you
[1:23:51] see how theologians and everything they
[1:23:53] need to read the word word they need to
[1:23:55] recognize and see the revelation of the
[1:23:58] meaning behind Christ in you your hope
[1:24:01] of
[1:24:02] glory listen to brother brand he says
[1:24:05] here he says God expressed in Jesus
[1:24:08] Christ who was both
[1:24:10] Father Son and Holy Ghost the fullness
[1:24:16] of the godhead bodily now the complete
[1:24:19] fullness of the godhead bodily dwells
[1:24:24] in the
[1:24:26] church in his
[1:24:28] church the
[1:24:54] he says um you know uh it's about
[1:24:57] relationships here okay this you and
[1:25:01] Christ it's about relationships and now
[1:25:03] we want to look at you know um the the
[1:25:05] mission of the church what is the
[1:25:08] mission what is your mission our our
[1:25:10] purpose statement says to bring people
[1:25:13] to Christ so that they can
[1:25:16] fulfill their purpose in the body of
[1:25:19] Christ and like the sister Kon said when
[1:25:22] she said if God is placed a gift in me
[1:25:25] then I've got to I've got to join that
[1:25:28] body even if that gift is
[1:25:30] invisible even if it's one that's that's
[1:25:33] like you know you've got you've got you
[1:25:35] know you've got a pancreas that controls
[1:25:37] the sugar in your in your in your system
[1:25:41] and if that pancreas is not properly
[1:25:43] cared for and it's and it and it gets
[1:25:45] out of order then all kinds of sugar
[1:25:47] levels start to spike and what what
[1:25:50] happens is you get diabetes and all of a
[1:25:52] sudden your body gets you know uh
[1:25:54] diseased and there's problems well well
[1:25:57] God has Parts in the body of Christ that
[1:26:00] need to be here am that of this local
[1:26:03] body they were ordained to be here from
[1:26:06] before the foundations of the world Amen
[1:26:09] oh I don't need to go to a church I
[1:26:11] don't need to beong I can just listen to
[1:26:13] the tapes just press play and
[1:26:16] Obey how's that going to edify the body
[1:26:19] of Jesus Christ amen no you need to be a
[1:26:23] part of that body you need to assemble
[1:26:26] yourself even more so as that day
[1:26:29] approaches why because he's fulfilling
[1:26:32] the final stage of the Rapture and
[1:26:35] everyone must get into their position
[1:26:38] whether they're believer make believer
[1:26:41] or unbeliever it all works together but
[1:26:45] in the mystical Body of Christ that goes
[1:26:47] in the Rapture it's only attributes of
[1:26:52] God and there is no way you are going to
[1:26:55] keep an attribute of God at home
[1:26:58] listening to tapes no way there's just
[1:27:03] no way think about it you're G to you're
[1:27:06] going to miss out on the supernatural
[1:27:08] element of the preaching of the word
[1:27:10] where he can come and speak to your
[1:27:12] personal need right here speak to this
[1:27:15] situation deal with that healing heal
[1:27:17] you here and and deliver you there and
[1:27:20] give you the wisdom that you need listen
[1:27:22] God is a living God it's Christ in you
[1:27:27] Christ in the
[1:27:28] body he didn't leave back in 65 when
[1:27:32] brother brandham died that's right no
[1:27:35] brother brandham himself even said I
[1:27:37] must decrease so that he can
[1:27:39] increase John the Baptist said I must
[1:27:42] decrease so that he can increase he came
[1:27:45] into his public Ministry he came and
[1:27:48] progressed into the word that he needed
[1:27:50] to fulfill for this day and we are fulf
[1:27:54] fulfilling that part
[1:27:56] now Hallelujah listen let's read Matthew
[1:28:00] 22 next slide he says here then one of
[1:28:03] them which was a lawyer asked him a
[1:28:05] question tempting him and saying Master
[1:28:07] which is the great command which is the
[1:28:10] great commandment in the
[1:28:12] law Jesus said unto the him Thou shalt
[1:28:15] love the Lord thy God with all thine
[1:28:18] heart there's one and with all thy soul
[1:28:21] and with all thy mind this is the first
[1:28:24] and great commandment and now listen to
[1:28:26] the second one he says is like unto it
[1:28:30] Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[1:28:34] on these two Commandments hang all the
[1:28:37] law of and all the law and the prophets
[1:28:43] everything is hanging on that that you
[1:28:46] shall love the Lord your God in other
[1:28:48] words you got to love the word because
[1:28:51] remember in the beginning was the word
[1:28:53] the word was with God and the Word was
[1:28:55] God so you got to love the word with all
[1:28:58] of your heart your mind and your soul
[1:29:01] you're not going to compromise on the
[1:29:02] word when somebody comes to you and says
[1:29:04] hey you need to be baptized properly in
[1:29:08] the name of the in the name of Jesus
[1:29:10] Christ not in the name of the titles of
[1:29:12] Father Son and Holy Ghost you they need
[1:29:16] they need to know the truth Jesus said
[1:29:18] the truth shall set you free it's simple
[1:29:22] these are all just examples okay and so
[1:29:25] here let's read the next um
[1:29:28] slide Acts chapter 2 he goes on here and
[1:29:33] he says now listen this is the church
[1:29:35] now remember love the Lord thy God and
[1:29:38] love one another now look at the early
[1:29:41] church people ask me all the time what
[1:29:43] do you believe Danny what is it like
[1:29:45] what is your church like what what what
[1:29:47] Doctrine what who who's who's your your
[1:29:49] your mother church or who's the the we
[1:29:52] don't have we are the book of of Acts
[1:29:54] continuing we are the Church of Christ
[1:29:58] is basically a continuation of the book
[1:30:00] of Acts we're self-sufficient just like
[1:30:02] they were they went and they preached
[1:30:04] the word of God in season out of season
[1:30:08] here they were they devoted themselves
[1:30:10] to the apostles teachings and to the
[1:30:12] fellowship to the breaking of bread and
[1:30:15] to prayer that's what we do everyone was
[1:30:18] filled with awe and Many Wonders and
[1:30:21] miraculous signs were done by the
[1:30:24] apostles you know that he's still doing
[1:30:26] miracles signs and wonders amen he
[1:30:28] follows his word amen everyone all the
[1:30:32] Believers were together and had
[1:30:33] everything in common selling their
[1:30:36] possessions and goods they gave to
[1:30:39] everyone as he had need every day they
[1:30:42] continued to meet together in the temple
[1:30:44] courts they broke bread in their homes
[1:30:47] and ate together with glad and sincere
[1:30:50] Hearts praising God and enjoying the
[1:30:53] favor of all all the people and the Lord
[1:30:56] added to their numbers daily those who
[1:30:59] were being
[1:31:02] saved we're still the same church don't
[1:31:06] you think you need to be pulling people
[1:31:08] into this church you don't need to be
[1:31:10] pulling people God will move them right
[1:31:12] into the area and then God will lead
[1:31:15] them right by the church amen God will
[1:31:18] lead them to a to a message online God
[1:31:21] will lead them somewhere and when they
[1:31:22] need to hear his voice they're going to
[1:31:24] hear
[1:31:26] it he'll do it because he's still the
[1:31:29] same God Amen Hallelujah we need to pay
[1:31:34] attention to the manner at which Jesus
[1:31:37] conducted his Earthly Ministry because
[1:31:40] we are expressing him amen we're we're
[1:31:45] we're under the same Ministry Saints
[1:31:47] Jesus listen he he was a master at
[1:31:50] building relationships with people
[1:31:54] he could he he could he could share his
[1:31:56] gift with whomever he wanted the gift of
[1:32:00] salvation but he did it by relationship
[1:32:04] he did it by calling their names he did
[1:32:07] it by by by uh uh recognizing who they
[1:32:10] were and them recognizing who he was it
[1:32:14] was a real
[1:32:15] relationship amen but what happens
[1:32:18] listen Jesus never invited people to
[1:32:21] church
[1:32:22] meetings he simply built relationships
[1:32:24] with people and use those relationships
[1:32:27] as platforms from which to talk about
[1:32:30] the kingdom of God Amen about the
[1:32:34] father's business and that's what we
[1:32:37] need to recognize and and keep it simple
[1:32:40] but what happens is we get too caught up
[1:32:41] in our own
[1:32:44] business we get distracted and it keeps
[1:32:48] us from being about the father's
[1:32:50] business you know we've heard many times
[1:32:52] mind your own business business
[1:32:55] everybody said that you know my you
[1:32:57] you'll even hear it sometimes you know
[1:32:59] you you'll want to interject a little
[1:33:00] bit about well you know you hear this
[1:33:02] person having a problem and you know
[1:33:04] they've got somebody at home that's sick
[1:33:06] and you kind of get in there and you say
[1:33:07] Hey you know I'm I'm a Christian and and
[1:33:10] and I can pray for your brother or your
[1:33:13] sister or your mother and they turn
[1:33:14] around and say listen mind your own
[1:33:16] business well that is my business but
[1:33:18] okay I'll mind my own business you see
[1:33:23] if you're not a Christian then you're
[1:33:27] not obligated to involve yourself in
[1:33:29] God's business it's as simple as that so
[1:33:32] so if somebody doesn't want to be
[1:33:34] involved in God's business in the
[1:33:36] father's business you can't force
[1:33:39] them first of all God has to call them
[1:33:42] all you can do is create the atmosphere
[1:33:44] around them speak about the word of God
[1:33:47] let yourself be a witness and let God do
[1:33:50] the rest Hallelujah you know but here we
[1:33:54] are and I'm just you know bringing this
[1:33:55] analogy here according to the culture
[1:33:58] you're ex you're you're expected to mind
[1:34:00] your own business and to deal with your
[1:34:03] own life you through close family ties
[1:34:07] and really good friends will likely be
[1:34:09] invited to be a part of some other
[1:34:11] business and be caught up with the cares
[1:34:14] of this
[1:34:15] life but that's the problem it's this
[1:34:19] life but we're talking about eternal
[1:34:22] life we're talking talking about the
[1:34:24] father's business and the true benefits
[1:34:27] come from the father's business for it
[1:34:30] has Eternal
[1:34:32] benefits too many
[1:34:35] Christians are more concerned about
[1:34:38] their own business than they are God's
[1:34:41] business they make time for all the
[1:34:43] things that they want to do and squeeze
[1:34:46] a little bit of time in for
[1:34:48] God why because they're minding their
[1:34:51] own business
[1:34:54] as a first priority and God's business
[1:34:56] as a
[1:34:58] leftover most Christians do not give
[1:35:02] sacrificially to the Lord's work but
[1:35:04] often find time and the money for
[1:35:07] special events and big sales at
[1:35:13] Walmart they're minding their own
[1:35:15] business as a first priority and God's
[1:35:18] business as a
[1:35:19] leftover you need to know that God is
[1:35:21] not happy with leftovers
[1:35:24] he wants all of you if he calls you give
[1:35:28] him all give him your best give him what
[1:35:31] he deserves amen God has an expectation
[1:35:34] that his children will be about his
[1:35:37] business once they are called amen
[1:35:40] praise
[1:35:42] God we don't look for excuses we don't
[1:35:44] look for uh we don't put any other
[1:35:47] priorities we start to respond to
[1:35:49] opportunities to do things that God
[1:35:52] wants us to do sometimes there's a call
[1:35:54] that goes out hey we've got listen we've
[1:35:56] got a youth camp coming up in September
[1:35:59] it's already been set for September uh
[1:36:02] long weekend it starts on August the
[1:36:04] 30th it'll end on July the 1st it's
[1:36:07] Friday Saturday and Sunday and we're
[1:36:09] going to need to plan that event and we
[1:36:12] want to make it the best Camp ever we've
[1:36:15] been doing it for 27 28 years now we
[1:36:18] want this to be the best one ever we've
[1:36:21] secured a minister by the leading of the
[1:36:23] Holy ho
[1:36:24] spirit I believe that that's the most
[1:36:27] important element in the meetings is
[1:36:29] when God sends us the right voice the
[1:36:32] right the right the the right individual
[1:36:35] somebody that that he wants that he's
[1:36:38] going to use that he's going to speak to
[1:36:40] the the young people and all of us amen
[1:36:43] it's an opportunity but we need you to
[1:36:46] step up and to be prepared to do your
[1:36:49] part in preparation for this weekend
[1:36:51] event and so that's an opportunity and
[1:36:55] we need to get behind the opportunity
[1:36:58] because it's God's business it's the
[1:37:01] father's business and he wants you
[1:37:03] involved so that you can fulfill your
[1:37:06] part your part might only be to give
[1:37:08] your part might be to to give time your
[1:37:11] part might be to to to to be there for
[1:37:14] the for the church cleaning whatever it
[1:37:16] is get into the father's business
[1:37:20] because this Youth Camp God has been
[1:37:23] blessed blessing it God has been
[1:37:24] providing for it God has been
[1:37:26] vindicating it year after year after
[1:37:29] year and we are about the father's
[1:37:32] business and I don't take it
[1:37:34] lightly I want to give
[1:37:37] 1,000% of our abilities and our
[1:37:40] knowledge and our and our our knowhow
[1:37:42] and the gifts that God has placed in
[1:37:45] this local body to do their part just

[1:37:49] retirement celebration everybody came
[1:37:53] and they and they stood and and all I
[1:37:55] can say is that the Lord was proud of
[1:37:58] your sacrifices and your your giving and
[1:38:02] and all that you did and it came
[1:38:04] together and was a huge success for
[1:38:07] God's glory amen praise God it's the
[1:38:10] father's
[1:38:11] business amen and so God wants us not to
[1:38:15] be given any excuses we want to be
[1:38:18] getting there do uh listen do do any of
[1:38:21] us have more to accomplish on this Earth
[1:38:25] than than the Lord Jesus
[1:38:27] did most of us have lived already I'm
[1:38:31] I'm I'm almost twice the the the the the
[1:38:33] number of years that Jesus was on the
[1:38:35] earth and what he accomplished what
[1:38:38] about us we've got something that we
[1:38:40] need to accomplish and that we need to
[1:38:42] make the priority of the father's
[1:38:44] business our first priority amen praise
[1:38:48] God
[1:38:49] Hallelujah the New Testament teaches
[1:38:52] that we are all ambassadors for
[1:38:55] Christ and ministers in his
[1:38:58] name First Peter chapter uh 2 ver9 says
[1:39:03] but you are a chosen
[1:39:05] people a royal priesthood a holy nation
[1:39:09] a people belonging to God that you may
[1:39:12] declare the Praises of him who called
[1:39:14] you out of Darkness into his glorious
[1:39:19] light 1 Peter 4:10 says each one should
[1:39:22] use whatever gift he has received to
[1:39:26] serve others and to nourish and to edify
[1:39:30] the body of Jesus Christ Faithfully
[1:39:33] administering God's grace in its various
[1:39:36] forms amen as Christians whether we earn
[1:39:40] our living in a grocery store in a
[1:39:42] factory or in an office in our homes we
[1:39:47] are the Church of God In
[1:39:51] Action we are about the father father's
[1:39:54] business amen praise God and you know
[1:39:59] there's always promotion we're talking
[1:40:01] about business here and I'm I'm kind of
[1:40:03] mixing you know literal business with
[1:40:06] God's business and there's things in
[1:40:09] there that we can see similarities you
[1:40:11] know when I uh uh promote fantasy garden
[1:40:14] centers you know we'll run some ads in
[1:40:16] the newspapers we will do certain
[1:40:19] specials and promotions to draw the
[1:40:21] people in it's all part of promoting
[1:40:23] promoting right promotion is
[1:40:25] communicating the nature of what it is
[1:40:27] that you're trying to sell amen
[1:40:30] promotion is important because without
[1:40:32] it your product doesn't stand a chance
[1:40:34] of succeeding in meeting the people's
[1:40:37] needs and you know what our promotion is
[1:40:40] how many can guess what our promotion
[1:40:44] is your
[1:40:47] testimony your testimony is the greatest
[1:40:51] promotion that you will ever
[1:40:56] display when it comes to the father's
[1:41:00] business
[1:41:02] Hallelujah people you know businesses
[1:41:05] for example
[1:41:08] AT&T back in the 70s paid $60 million
[1:41:13] for a fword slogan Reach Out And Touch
[1:41:18] someone five $60 million
[1:41:23] but look at what it was Reach Out And
[1:41:25] Touch someone how do we reach out and
[1:41:28] touch somebody with our testimony that's
[1:41:31] all let them know what God did for you
[1:41:35] they will assimilate and say wait a
[1:41:38] minute maybe God can do that for me you
[1:41:41] see that's the father's business it's
[1:41:42] about relationships it's about you first
[1:41:45] having a relationship with Christ and
[1:41:47] then you through your relationship
[1:41:49] introducing him to them and if they have
[1:41:53] representation remember let's go back to
[1:41:56] the beginning you're ordained to receive
[1:42:00] this word from before the foundations of
[1:42:03] the world before you came here God
[1:42:06] prepared you to be the display of his
[1:42:09] word in your day and you'll only receive
[1:42:13] it if you're ordained to receive it amen
[1:42:17] praise God but how you going to know if
[1:42:20] they can receive it if you don't share
[1:42:22] it
[1:42:25] brother Gabriel handed me a
[1:42:27] tape he said ' are you a Christian I
[1:42:29] said ' I don't
[1:42:31] know I said I was brought up Roman
[1:42:33] Catholic if that's Christianity I'm a
[1:42:36] hypocrite because I don't practice what
[1:42:39] they
[1:42:41] preach he said yeah that's good I didn't
[1:42:44] say all of that all I said was the first
[1:42:46] part but he said yeah that's good here
[1:42:48] listen to this and he handed me a tape
[1:42:51] 1957 Hebrews series how Paul brother BR
[1:42:55] was preaching about Paul getting knocked
[1:42:57] off of his high
[1:42:59] horse so that he could
[1:43:01] recognize
[1:43:03] God was a reality Hallelujah and that he
[1:43:06] was going to call him no idea what God
[1:43:08] was doing but when God wants to do it
[1:43:11] he's going to do
[1:43:12] it hallelujah praise God and so you know
[1:43:17] our Our Testimony is our way of
[1:43:20] promoting Jesus Christ you know and as
[1:43:23] far as you know as far as the church is
[1:43:25] concerned re research consistently shows
[1:43:28] that people who have made Jesus Christ
[1:43:31] their lord and savior were led to that
[1:43:34] decision by the testimony of another
[1:43:38] person that they knew and were
[1:43:41] related what does that research tell us
[1:43:44] let less than 1% of Born Again Believers
[1:43:47] in Canada and the US made Jesus Christ
[1:43:50] their lord and savior through the
[1:43:52] efforts of
[1:43:53] Evangelical TV programs less than
[1:43:58] 1% a slightly higher number have become
[1:44:01] Christians by reading Christian books
[1:44:03] and magazines by listening to Christian
[1:44:06] radio
[1:44:07] programs about 5% became Christians
[1:44:11] through special programs at
[1:44:15] churches a slightly higher percentage
[1:44:17] did so because of the preacher at the
[1:44:20] certain congregation
[1:44:23] but listen to this however over
[1:44:27] 85% of those who make Jesus Christ their
[1:44:30] lord and savior have done so through the
[1:44:34] efforts and testimony of their friends
[1:44:37] families and
[1:44:41] neighbors so do you see why he wants to
[1:44:45] live through
[1:44:47] you you see how it is that he's reaching
[1:44:51] others by you EX accepting his word not
[1:44:55] a Doctrine not a man's
[1:44:58] teaching not because my dad went to this
[1:45:02] church my mom went to that church my no
[1:45:05] I was baptized as a baby no those are
[1:45:06] all excuses that keep you from coming to
[1:45:10] the word for your day and for this
[1:45:13] hour
[1:45:15] Hallelujah listen
[1:45:18] here I'm going to close with this
[1:45:25] every business does usually have a
[1:45:29] price
[1:45:31] that is offered for their
[1:45:35] product determining a price for a
[1:45:37] product is a very complex task it
[1:45:40] involves so many different
[1:45:42] variables the ultimate goal of price is
[1:45:46] the business in the business is that it
[1:45:48] should accomplish the following things
[1:45:50] bring a fair and reasonable return on
[1:45:53] your investment make the product
[1:45:56] financially accessible to the people who
[1:45:58] need it and provide a realistic value of
[1:46:02] service to those who need it keep your
[1:46:05] spiritual minds and thinking on here
[1:46:08] there's one important concept we have to
[1:46:10] remember as a church we can't cons we
[1:46:13] cannot confuse the concept of price with
[1:46:15] the concept of
[1:46:18] Finance we don't we don't correlate
[1:46:20] those two in in the house of God
[1:46:23] money does not correlate when it comes
[1:46:27] to
[1:46:29] Salvation the nature of our product is
[1:46:32] one in which a financial transaction is
[1:46:35] totally
[1:46:38] unnecessary the church on the other hand
[1:46:40] is required to make an
[1:46:42] investment an investment of of of
[1:46:46] commitment to the body of Christ amen an
[1:46:50] investment to the word
[1:46:53] an emotional investment a total personal
[1:46:56] and physical and intellectual commitment
[1:46:59] to the word of God that's the investment
[1:47:02] that we make as Sons and Daughters of
[1:47:06] God the church needs money to operate
[1:47:09] but that's not the price of our product
[1:47:13] we don't collect money so that we can
[1:47:16] put out the word that's not the way it
[1:47:19] works God will anoint
[1:47:23] individuals with Revelation to give to
[1:47:27] give tithing and to give
[1:47:30] offering if they're truly Sons and
[1:47:32] Daughters of God they cannot bypass that
[1:47:37] if they do they will
[1:47:40] struggle not necessarily
[1:47:43] financially you can struggle in many
[1:47:46] other ways than financially but when you
[1:47:50] miss that element because of certain uh
[1:47:53] you know fear or greed or not willing to
[1:47:56] let go and let God operate and flow
[1:47:59] through you in your tithes and offerings
[1:48:02] it it breaks down your your your
[1:48:05] spiritual strength your overcoming power
[1:48:09] it breaks down your
[1:48:11] relationships it makes you miss church
[1:48:13] it makes you disconnect from the body of
[1:48:16] Jesus Christ it all it all comes in many
[1:48:19] mysterious ways financial support for
[1:48:22] the church is an outgrowth of a person's
[1:48:25] desire to further spread the the the
[1:48:29] word of
[1:48:31] God it's it's it's it's something that
[1:48:34] somebody realizes hey by giving to the
[1:48:37] missions the word gets out there by
[1:48:40] giving and keeping our church healthy
[1:48:42] and strong and and physically fit it
[1:48:45] keeps people coming in and finding a
[1:48:48] place where they can hear the word of
[1:48:50] God keeping it clean and so forth amen
[1:48:54] Jesus listen he served as as a premier
[1:48:58] example of how to deal with this
[1:49:01] situation Jesus walked the roads and the
[1:49:03] streets in Judea and Galilee paying
[1:49:05] little attention to
[1:49:09] fundraising his primary concern was
[1:49:12] establishing
[1:49:15] relationships getting people to Christ
[1:49:18] getting them to that place where they
[1:49:20] can receive and get help from their
[1:49:23] condition and the circumstances and live
[1:49:26] a happy prosperous joyful life in Christ
[1:49:30] amen amen the investment the church
[1:49:34] needs to make is an investment from the
[1:49:36] heart and not So Much from the wallet we
[1:49:40] are about the father's business through
[1:49:41] our unique gifts and the abilities that
[1:49:45] God has placed within us as the mystical
[1:49:48] body of Jesus Christ we don't treat the
[1:49:52] church is promoting of the word as an
[1:49:54] opportunity for personal
[1:49:56] gain we're freed from using money as our
[1:50:00] scale of success money will come as a
[1:50:05] result of Faith because without faith
[1:50:08] there is no way you can please God with
[1:50:11] a million a trillion a billion it's got
[1:50:14] no relevance to God God wants character
[1:50:17] amen God wants you to have character God
[1:50:20] wants you to be so surrender and yielded
[1:50:23] to his spirit that that that when you
[1:50:26] come to that place and you're giving by
[1:50:28] Revelation and you know that he's
[1:50:30] Jehovah Gyra then blessings just
[1:50:33] automatically pour into your life
[1:50:35] they're your needs are just going to be
[1:50:37] met you don't you're not focused on on
[1:50:40] the money you're focused on on giving
[1:50:43] yourself to the to the ministry and to
[1:50:45] the father's
[1:50:46] business
[1:50:50] amen the church engages in mark
[1:50:52] marketing for a higher purpose the
[1:50:55] calling of the Sons and Daughters of God
[1:50:57] to an to the attention of the word and
[1:51:00] in closing let the musicians
[1:51:02] come I'll read you a little story here a
[1:51:06] young man in poverty named Howard Kelly
[1:51:08] and this is a true story was selling
[1:51:10] goods from door to door to pay his way
[1:51:13] through
[1:51:14] college one day he had nothing but a
[1:51:17] dime to his name and he was hungry he
[1:51:21] decided that he would ask ask for a meal
[1:51:23] at the next house however he lost his
[1:51:26] nerve when a lovely young woman opened
[1:51:29] the door instead of a meal he asked for
[1:51:33] a drink of
[1:51:34] water he thought she thought he looked
[1:51:37] hungry and so she brought him a large
[1:51:39] glass of milk instead he drank it slowly
[1:51:43] and then asked how much do I owe you she
[1:51:47] said you don't owe me anything she
[1:51:49] replied my mother taught us never to
[1:51:52] accept payment for kindness he said then
[1:51:56] I thank you from my heart as he left
[1:51:59] that house he not only felt stronger
[1:52:02] physically but his faith in God and His
[1:52:05] emotional well-being were strengthened
[1:52:08] too he had been ready to just give up
[1:52:12] and quit years later that same woman
[1:52:16] became critically ill the local doctors
[1:52:20] were baffled
[1:52:22] they finally sent her to the big city
[1:52:25] where they called in for
[1:52:28] consultation when he heard the name of
[1:52:30] the town she came
[1:52:32] from no oh sorry where they where they
[1:52:36] called in Specialists to study her rare
[1:52:40] disease Dr Howard Kelly was called in
[1:52:44] for the consultation when he heard the
[1:52:47] name of the town she came from he went
[1:52:50] down the hall of the hospital to her
[1:52:52] room
[1:52:53] dressed in his doctor's gown he went in
[1:52:56] to see her he recognized her at once he
[1:52:59] went back to the consultation room
[1:53:01] determined to do his best to save her
[1:53:04] life from that day he gave special
[1:53:07] attention to the case after a long
[1:53:10] struggle the battle against the disease
[1:53:13] Was Won Dr Kelly requested that the
[1:53:16] hospital billing department send the
[1:53:19] final bill to him for approval he looked
[1:53:23] at it then wrote something on the edge
[1:53:26] and the bill was sent to her
[1:53:29] room she was afraid to open it because
[1:53:32] she was sure it would take the rest of
[1:53:34] her life to pay for it all finally she
[1:53:39] opened the bill and looked at it and saw
[1:53:42] something that caught her attention on
[1:53:44] the side of the bill she read these
[1:53:47] words paid in full with one glass of
[1:53:54] milk signed Dr Howard
[1:53:59] [Applause]

[1:54:05] was
[1:54:06] paid you owe
[1:54:09] nothing there is nothing that you can
[1:54:12] do that could change your position in
[1:54:16] Jesus Christ as a son or a daughter of
[1:54:18] God there is no price that you need to
[1:54:20] pay because it was paid once for all
[1:54:23] amen it says in Ephesians 2:8 for it is
[1:54:27] by Grace you have been saved through
[1:54:30] faith that this is not from yourselves

[1:54:36] God this is a gift that God has given
[1:54:38] you salvation is your gift there's no
[1:54:41] price to pay a gift is something that
[1:54:43] you receive and it's
[1:54:45] free 2 Corinthians verse uh chapter 9:15
