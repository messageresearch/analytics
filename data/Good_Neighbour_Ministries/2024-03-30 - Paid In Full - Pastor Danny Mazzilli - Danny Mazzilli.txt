to our Friday night Good Friday service amen praise God let me tell you it's not just a good Friday it's a great Friday Hallelujah glory to God it's the greatest Friday ever amen if you've recognized what has taken place glory to God listen it was a horrible day 2,000 years ago when we think about the Lord Jesus having to carry that cross and then for him to have to be nailed to that cross there's no description of the agony that he went through and it was horrible but it was the greatest victory for the Sons and Daughters of God it was the greatest time on Earth for the Sons and Daughters of God it was the greatest time for all creation amen praise God glory to God and he's here to say I am alive forever more amen I'm not dead I'm alive praise God like brother Tim was praying we're not worried about uh you know a a Friday where where you know like the world out there is like mourning today they're mourning the death of Jesus why would you be mourning the death of Jesus when it happened 2,000 years ago when that you're the beneficiaries of his resurrection because he rose amen praise God we should be the happiest people on Earth he says I'm here now and I'm saying the debts been paid in full praise God amen glory to God you know the way of sin and death is one that none of us can handle alone there's not one of us that can do that amen men praise God that's why he had to die and take our place praise God he offers us forgiveness of sin reconciliation with with him and the gift of eternal life to them that believe what took place 2,000 years ago and that he is alive forever more amen glory to God like it says in St John chapter 8 verse 36 he says he whom the son of man has set free is free indeed praise God let's go to our scripture before we do that we'll just ask the Lord to send once more his inspiration to the word father we're so grateful tonight Lord we feel your spirit and your presence here this evening we're so grateful father that Lord that you are a living God to us Lord we're not mourning tonight Lord we are rejoicing father Lord we're we're we're in a time in our lives to know that we've accepted what you did for us 2,000 years ago and you resurrected and you came to be with us here tonight in our midst father you said I'll be with you even in you Lord we're calling upon that promise tonight and we're asking you to take possession of the speaker and the hearers Lord as we Fellowship in Heavenly places Lord may you take control in Jesus name amen praise God let's go to our scripture Colossians chapter 2: 10-4 and ye are complete in him which is the head of all principality and Power in whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ so in other words we're not doing the natural circumcision he's saying here there's a spiritual Supernatural circumcision that takes place and and that's the the the the the uh complete birth and Born Again experience of coming into Christ and being completely separated from the sin of the flesh amen praise God buried with him in baptism that's why we baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in water because it's a type of being buried and leaving the old life buried and and then being resurrected in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to a brand new life that is debt free amen praise God buried with him in baptism wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God in other words through the Revelation that God reveals to you of who you are who he is amen praise God who hath raised him from the dead and you you being dead in your sins and uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses trespasses yes translated debt Hallelujah blotting out wiping out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to the Cross amen the Lord add His blessings to the word God bless you you may be seated amen what was nailed to the cross is described as the handwriting of requirements ordinances in the King James version that was against us ordinances that were against us which was contrary to us because ordinances the word used in the King James version sounds like law some twist the meaning of nailed it to the Cross into Paul saying the force of the law of God ended at the death of Christ the law still exists and the penalty of sin still exists for those that do not accept Jesus Christ as the atonement for your sin so it wasn't so you know when we look at this okay and using the words Paul here like in in the scripture that we read okay nailed it to the Cross Paul was describing the record of our sins now I want you to understand something back in the days you know back in the days of the Romans and and going all the way back to Egypt and and and at the time when they would when they when somebody owed a debt they would take a a writing of ordinance they would write everything that the man owed they'd go to his door and they'd nail it to the wood post on his door to let everybody know this man is in debt this man owes and everybody needs to know it it's like a shame praise God and so when we look at how Paul describes it here in the scriptures we're seeing here that that we had sin on our lives we had debt in our lives there's there's natural debt and then there's spiritual debt and the spiritual debt comes as a result of being born in sin all have fallen short so don't look at anybody thinking oh this person is okay this person you know they didn't do anything wrong that no you're born in sin you're shaped in iniquity and you're speaking lies amen praise God and as you grow and as you you move in this world you start to build up debt sin and it's and it's written against you yes on that day on the great white Throne judgment when all are risen up they'll be judged according to the works of their flesh that's what the scripture says but to them that accept Christ and understand that he was nailed to the cross that when he went to the cross your sin was nailed to the cross because what would happen is when that individual's debt was eliminated and he paid it off they would go to his doorpost and they would put a cross over the ordinance saying he's debt free it's over he's been set free and they would also nail that to the door so that everybody could see it well Jesus Christ went and nailed himself allowed himself to be nailed to the cross and when he went to the Cross he took everything that was on you with him praise God hallelujah this [Applause] before we go to the Lord's Supper there's some of you that are carrying some unnecessary debt and you need to understand that that debt needs to be left behind because Jesus took it and said paid in full amen praise God he paid the price for our sins he took death upon himself and he resurrected himself so that he could give you eternal life because the penalty of sin was death and death is eternal separation from God that's what death is you should not fear death as a son or a daughter of God there is no death to the Sons and Daughters of God because once Christ has filled you with his Spirit once you have given your life to him and you know that the father now dwells in you on that day he says ye shall know that I am in the father ye and me and I and you all that was in Christ Christ ported into the church it's all in you now that eternal life is what holds you it what's it's what keeps you it's what brings you the ability to get back up when you make mistakes because you're going to make mistakes while you're here on this Earth so when we say Jesus took our debt we are acknowledging the reality that we've made him Lord in our life we've expressed it in baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ being buried in water not that it saves you but it shows that you've acknowledged the atonement you've taken the sacrifice you've you've allowed it to clean you cleanse you you know that it has the ability to wash you and to keep you and to give you life beyond this life everybody wants to live forever everybody's looking to somehow they can escape death all the health and beauty and the and the and the and the medicine business is is thriving very strongly these days the vitamin business huge because people are looking for ways that they can live healthier live longer I tell you there's one antidote where you can live eternally and that's Jesus Christ the atonement for our sin amen forgiveness and Reconciliation this transformation not only changes your status from Death to life but it also gives you purpose it gives you a reason to live a reason to overcome the trials and the tests that we all have to face yes we all have to deal with the things of this life but when you've come into that that that recognition you've You' come into that reconciliation with God With Jesus Christ it's something personal and it changes your status immediately it puts you into a a an an an area of life where all things start to work together for good everything comes under submission to the purpose of God because now he's in you remember it's him in you that's what that's what God is watching watchingg over he's watching over his word when individuals claim Christ and they'll go to church and they'll they'll they'll they'll believe in a trinity or they'll they'll believe in doctrines of man and they'll take man's interpretation on the word of God instead of the word which is Christ the spirit of God how can the spirit bear record of that the spirit will only bear record of the truth of his word and so when somebody says how are you baptized and you said I was baptized in water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of my sins and God filled me with his spirit I had the baptism of the Holy Ghost I experienced Christ and now he lives forever more in my life the word says amen the word says that's it but when somebody has a testimony that is contrary to the word of God there is no way God can back that word amen praise God listen it's one thing to have Earthly debt erased which would be amazing how many's got debt we all got debt some way somehow you know we choose sometimes to have debt that's life you know but debt is something that that we have to deal with in this realm financially as human beings but then there's another kind of debt it's the kind of debt that brings you down and you know it's an it's an entirely different kind of debt it's called the the the debt of sin okay debt free now can only be achieved in Jesus Christ because he justifies you he justifies you that you never did it in the first place it's not the kind listen imagine somebody coming up to you and saying how much you got on the on the house 500,000 here's the check paid how much you owe in the car here's the check paid Lord and by the way I'm your great uncle and I decided to look you up and your friends turn around and say hey what what's this all about what do you want from me I'm justified in the fact that he's my uncle he came looking for me and he paid my debt am so I can rejoice in that kind of Revelation amen well that's what Jesus did for you he came looking for you he saw that you carried all this weight of sin he saw that you were in a condition that you were so under oppression you were feeling the guilt and the shame of it that he says I'm going to set you free I'm going to pay it in [Applause] full praise God you know let me give you some facts here a study from the Royal College of psychiatrists they did a study around debt and mental health they found that half of the adults with debt problems also live with mental illness problems and issues these illnesses ranged from a consistent feeling of anxiety l mood to diagnosed mental health issues that can make you feel anxious especially if you don't have support thatt can be a huge burden made worse by dealing with it alone nobody likes to be alone nobody likees you know it's a it's it's wonderful when you've got friends and family around you that can be there when times get tough praise God nobody wants to be alone imagine somebody that's completely on their own and they haven't got any way of meeting that next month's rent payment it puts a lot of pressure on the people worrying about debt can affect your sleep losing out on one night's good sleep can make you moody lose your energy levels can also affect your ability to work and have good relationships with your friends and your family that's what debt can do sometimes you wonder you know you see people that you know financially they got no problems but yet they're miserable they're unhappy they're sick they're tired they're always having to deal with with family issues and and problems at work and situations what is what kind of debt is that that's the that kind of debt can only be dealt with by the blood of Jesus Christ no other way that's where you surrender where you come to a place where you realize you can't do it on your own anymore you need the antidote praise God hallelujah all of these things can further add to your debt problem all to say debt can be a very real mental emotional physical weight that we carry from time to time it's a reality let's go to our next scripture we're going to we're going to look at the weight of debt and sin and the antidote to that debt and sin in Luke chapter 23 from verse 33 to 43 we're going to read and when they were come to the place which is called Calvary there they crucified him and the maleactors one on the right on the right hand and one on the left then said Jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do and they parted his reignment and cast lots and people stood beholding and the rulers also with them derided him derided means they ridiculed him they mocked him saying he saved others let him save himself if he be Christ The Chosen of God and the soldiers also mocked him coming to him and offering him vinegar and saying if thou be the king of the Jews save thyself and a super scription also was written over him in in letters of Greek and Latin and Hebrew this is the king of the Jews and one of the malifa which were hanged railed on him saying if thou be Christ save thyself but the other answering rebuked him saying does not thou fear God seeing that thou art in the same condemnation and we indeed justify for we receive the due reward of our Deeds but this man hath done a miss and he said unto Jesus Lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom and Jesus said unto him verily I say unto you to thee today shalt thou be with me in Paradise when we look at this scripture it opens up showing us Jesus being nailed to the cross the immense weight of the wooden cross symbolizes not only the physical suffering Jesus endured but also the burden of Humanity's sin he had to carry all the weight of our sin when he was walking up galtha when he was moving up that street and he was falling with the weight of that cross it was because of the weight of our sin on him he didn't he didn't he didn't bow to the pain he didn't submit to the pain he knew the purpose that he had he knew why he had to do it he knew that there was nothing that was going to stop him from getting to the to the to the Finish Line amen praise God then he he was nailed to that cross like he said record of our sins were nailed to that cross all the things that were against us all the things that we hold and we try to hang on to as we live this life and we try to move through this Dimension we we we want to hold on to to old uh you know hurts and and pains we want to hang on to scars from the past we want to we want to say oh but you know it's generational things that that that we're dealing with my life listen when you were birthed by this word and the blood of Jesus Christ cleansed you from your sin your sin was placed in the sea of his forgetfulness never to be remembered no more why would you carry that he nailed it to the Cross glory to God Amen in the midst of his Agony Jesus uttered words of incredible mercy and kindness when he said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing it's like you and me we do things we we get caught into situations you know and we do things and and and and we don't realize what we're doing but the mercy and the grace of God keeps saying over and over you're forgiven you're forgiven have mercy he says he says forgive them Father they don't know what they're doing amen the amount of debt didn't cause Jesus to stray from his purpose he didn't give up he went freely and allowed himself to be the ordinances of our sin and he allowed it to be nailed right there to the Cross so that we could be free we're reminded of the magnitude of the sin that he carried you would have never been able to deal with these things in your life aren't you glad to know that God had an antidote for you that he made a way for you that he allowed you to come into the revealed word that he came himself personally you see that's what this is all about a lot of people are preaching on the cross and preaching about Jesus Christ you know Easter Sunday but they don't realize that he's risen now he's alive now yes we had some stones that we needed to roll away but now they've been rolled away praise God and now we can live free and be debt free and free from all the burden that there was just no way that we could have possibly handled it in the midst of all the mockery Jesus remained steadfast in his mission of redemption there is nothing he said all that the father hath given me will come he says not one of you is going to be lost I'm going to every single one of you's written and and in the palm of my hand your names are written in my book he says and I'm going to call each and every one of you at that appointed time Hallelujah he bore the reproach he bore the mockery and I believe some of us have had to Bear the reproach and bear the mockery it's not easy to stand for Jesus it's not easy for for you to stand and tell the people Hey listen Easter was all about salvation Easter was all about restoring the Earth and bringing us back to the to the state that we should have always been in before the great fall that took place Easter is about the spirit of God coming into us to take us out of this Dimension and to move us into Heavenly places where there's going to be a great meeting one day amen with the Lord Jesus in the air it's called The Rapture we're rejoicing around it we're talking about it we're experiencing it that's what we're in the midst of that's what he's saying tonight you can't take the Rapture with debt you can't carry your burden you can't you can't sit in that guilt and shame and expect the the the supernatural power of God to deliver you you got to allow the spirit of God to come in control take possession possess you move aside all the hindrances he's the Overcomer that's in you that wants to overcome every situation that you want to carry he says I've paid it in full all you got to do is accept it amen glory to God we're reminded here how Paul you know and and how Jesus probably did it he he was he was focused on what he needed to do Hebrews 12: 1 and 2 says wherefor seen we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses listen Jesus was on the cross and I can tell you if he would have allowed the eyes of the people to be opened they would have seen millions of Chariots and warriors just waiting there to pounce on the Romans all he had to do was move his finger and say destroy them all encamped about with all kinds but he denied himself because he had a purpose he had you in mind he had you in mind he had every one of you in mind saying no no no no no I got to fulfill this Plan of Redemption I could easily he could have easily uh just called down millions of angels and and everything would have been fine and there would have been a glorious uh uh you know uh Symphony singing around him but he endured the cross because he knew there was a penalty for sin amen and he knew that he was the only one that could pay the price so wherefore now you having received the spirit of God in this day having been given the responsibility of the representation of Jesus Christ in the flesh by his spirit in you that's why Paul says your hope of glory the spirit of God the Holy Spirit Jesus Christ is your only hope of Salvation by accepting his Spirit within you now you're encamped about by a cloud of witnesses now you're being watched there's those that died for this gospel we've come through the Reformation We've Come Through the Dark Ages the reformation and we're and here we are in 2024 and if you look around the world there's there's all kinds of signs of his of his of his uh uh complete uh uh wiping out of sin and unbelief because sin is getting so so heavy Wars and and and demonic Powers possessing the people taking them into all kinds of their own interpretations of of what man should be and how a woman should be and all this all this confusion the world is in complete utter dismay if there's ever a time where where he's he's just ready to come it's now there's ever a time where he's ready to take his church it's now I believe all prophecies are pretty much fulfilled around our lives for the church sure the world is going to go into Great Tribulation sure there's going to be all kinds of things that are going to happen in Israel but before this world goes into total chaos God is going to take his church he's going to remove his body his church the body of Believers those that are in Christ that have been debt paid in full and have entered into Christ Jesus we're we're encamped about and en encompassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight of debt and sin which doth so easily beset us and let's run with patience this race we got to patiently keep pressing on you got to press on oh you got to come into the house of the Lord you got to you got to serve the Lord you got to tell people about Jesus Christ you got to allow your life to continue to be an example and an expression of God in Christ in this hour amen the people need to know that salvation is a reality and the only way they're going to really truly experience it as they see it in your life looking unto Jesus let's finish this race that's set before us looking unto Jesus see Christ he's the author he started the work in your life he's going to finish the work in your life all you got to do is say Amen when the word comes and the word teaches you certain things and it wants to correct you in certain ways and it wants to move you and shape you and mold you and position you you just got to say Amen you got to let the word have his way he's the author he's the finisher amen who the joy who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross imagine that he saw you he saw me he saw us he wanted us back together again he wanted us to Rejoice with him again like job says where were you when the sons of God rejoiced together around the throne Hallelujah he endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God that means he set back in his seat of power the same God Jesus Christ the Lord Jesus Christ Lord God above us Jesus God who came as the atonement Christ in you your hope of glory hallelujah hallelujah look to Jesus in these last verses from our passage we see the two different responses that came from the two criminals that were on each side while one criminal joins the mocking crowd and questions Jesus the other one recognizes his sin and realizes that Jesus was innocent how do you see him today how do you look a lot of people they don't look at Jesus in the right way they're not seeing him in the right way like the way that the that that that the the the thief at the cross saw him in the right way when they realized this man has done nothing it was because of me that he's here and until you get to a place whoever you are wherever you are until you come to a place where all pride and all your teachings and all your your your upbringing and all the things that you say are generational and well my father was a Methodist my mother was a Methodist my grandfather was a method Methodist and I'm going to die a Methodist until somebody can come to a place where they allow Jesus Christ I am a Christian my parents were Christians right my grandfather was a Christian I am a Christian a Christian is one that is filled with the spirit of God and when they read the word they say Amen to the word of God they don't mock the word they don't mock the the the the teachings of the word they don't look at somebody that believes the the word so much that they want to live a certain way like when a woman you know uh adors themselves they adore themselves in a Christian way in a way that doesn't cause a man to look at them to lust after them I'm just giving you examples here of of life you know living a Christian Life yes a man that that that you know when he's when he's among workers every third word out of his mouth is not the you know word living examples of of of Christ in you if Christ is in you there's no way you can you can express that kind of a life in his humility he pleads and he says to now this is the the thief that recognized he had done nothing he humbled himself he came to a place to realize wait a minute here I need salvation I need to to understand this atonement remember me when you come into your kingdom he said to Jesus and in response to this simple yet profound Act of Revelation because that's what took place in him and until you catch a true revelation of who God really is he's only going to be a teaching Sunday school lesson to you he's only going to be a Sunday or you know a a Sunday churchgoer lesson to you he's not going to be a revelation to you like he was to Peter when when Jesus was on the earth and he looks he says he comes down from praying he looks to his disciples he says who do the people say that I am now imagine here's God in human flesh and he's asking a question and it's a good question you can ask that question who do you say Jesus is who do you say and he looks he says who do you say that I am and Peter you know one some of them says oh some say you're you know John the Baptist risen Jeremiah a Prophet this and that he looks to Peter and he says Peter whom sayest thou that I am because Jesus knew who he was and Jesus knows who you are and when that question comes to you as an attribute Son of God and somebody says to you have you been baptized since you've been saved who do you say Jesus is and if you're calling him well he's he's he's a trinity he's three in one I can't quite figure it out but that's what he is no no he hasn't revealed to you who he is that's the problem and now you've got an interpretation based on a teaching instead of a revelation where God reveals himself he says to Peter Flesh and Blood hath not revealed this to you but my spirit I revealed this to you directly it's the mind of God his thought directly into your heart and and if when that happens like it happened to me 30 years ago there was nobody that could convince me different I don't care who it was because it was placed in me and look what he says to to to Paul or to to Peter he says flesh and blood has not revealed this your your mom your dad your teacher your your your your priest he says but the spirit has revealed this to you amen and Upon This Rock not Peter a rock upon the divine revelation of God's mind rein expressed into your mind and heart and thought directly he says I'm going to build my church that way and you're a part of that building because you are one of those Revelations that he called in these last days and you've responded to the word and you've resp responded the right way amen praise God so so here now his response simple yet profound was an act of Revelation and Jesus offers the Assurance of redemption and declares truly I say unto you now he's speaking to him lip to ear this guy he's all ears right now he's he's listening and and because he knows that this is not some ordinary man speaking to him he says today you will be with me in paradise and when you receive that first revelation of who God is and that you're a sinner and that you need him and that you can't do anything without him that you'll remain in your unbelief until that day comes and he speaks to you and says today that's right today not tomorrow today not by going to church oh I got to clean up first friends that you know they say Dan I I got I got to I got to get rid of a lot of things in my life before I can come to church I say you got it all wrong yes you got it all wrong you can't get rid of those things you need to give them to Jesus you need he says he that's heavy laden let him come unto me I will give you rest you got to get the thing right you need to get into the house of the Lord you got to let the word of God wash you by the washing of the word of God Amen the Regeneration of of his word this encounter exemplifies the transforming power of the Lord Jesus that when he speaks to an individual who says Lord I need listen go back to your own experience go back to that genuine time when you when you you you came to God it was now you and God you were naked before God and you said Lord I need to know that you're real and when he unveiled himself to you made himself real to you everything changed amen it's a supernatural transformation that takes place your friends won't understand your family won't understand it's okay they're not supposed to understand they're supposed to experience it that's the only way to understand you need to experience Christ in the power like Paul says of his resurrection these criminals were about to receive their just penalty the eyes of the Romans at that time the way they saw them they were to die they were they were they were Sinners because of the works that they did but there was an atonement right there and one of them happened to recognize that atonement have you recognized the atonement tonight amen in the eyes of the Roman they were guilty but Jesus hung as an innocent man so that he could take on every sin that man could not bear one of them was fortunate enough to recognize who he was next scripture in Romans 3:23 as we wind this down it says for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God there is not one person that can say I'm okay right no you're not okay even you know like okay your your salvation it was done from before the foundations of the world let's get that straight when you respond to this word and you truly respond to this word You're just showing that you were always a Son of God and you were just coming in like people say oh I went to an altar call no the altar call didn't save you the response to the word by Revelation brought you to the Altar and displayed that there was something in you that could respond to the word of God for this day and for this hour and that is salvation that is the New Birth when you receive the word in your day not denominational word not all the words oh the the church has been here for 2,000 years I don't care how long the any church has been around if it's not foundationally found on the spirit word of the Living God let every man's word be a lie and the word of God be the truth it's as simple as that so all have sinned and fallen short of the glory this is true but also Romans 3:24 says and all are Justified freely by his grace through the Redemption that came through Jesus Christ so yes all have fallen short but yes Redemption comes through the cross paid in full Hallelujah listen to brother brandom here he says go to the next slide what uh what it takes for you to overcome oops your device ran into a problem okay yeah I know it ran into a problem I know who the cause of the problem is too praise God let's let's read it now all Redemptive blessings to us the human race was paid for for us at Calvary when Jesus died for us we believe that the work and the complete plan of God every Redemptive blessing was completed at Calvary we don't need anything else don't let anybody tell you oh you need to follow this guy you need to follow this person you need to follow this teaching you need no no no you need to follow the word Paul says follow me as I follow Christ amen praise God so he says here uh being uh at Calvary that all of God's promises was made possible to every human being that would accept it when Jesus died to clear the human before God at Calvary I believe that every man in the world was saved when Jesus died at Calvary but now it's a finished work now the thing to do is can we get the people to see it and accept it you see that's our part therefore Divine Healing doesn't lay upon some magic something that someone has in their hands or some holy oil or water that they sprinkle on the people I do not believe in those things I believe that the blood of Jesus Christ is is sufficient for everything we have need of see and I believe it's something has already been paid for amen praise God forever more let's go to the next slide let the brothers get ready so now that we understand who we are we understand what he's done can we go to the Lord's Supper a little different can we approach him a little different here tonight knowing that he did it all he paid it all he made a way for you praise God I'm going to read here from 1 Corinthians before we do that just bow your heads you've heard the word here today you've heard that every burden every heartache every every sickness every relationship issue even your financial problems he's concerned about those things he's concerned about every detail of your life and he wants you tonight to come to him with a heart that's wide open one that that's that's naked before him and say Lord I don't want to carry this thing anymore I don't want this weight anymore the debts too heavy the emot otal stress is too much maybe you're going through mental stress and you want to be set free from that that that oppression that anxiety that tries to attack you listen all things were nailed to the cross there was not one thing that was left so don't don't think that there's anything that that that you're carrying right now whatever that burden is whatever that that that hurt whatever that scar whatever that pain he can take it tonight and you can leave here different than the way you entered in take a moment to open your heart to Jesus right now and let him take control of those things in your life so that you can be debt free don't want to carry it anymore Lord I want to be free I want to accept your promises it's all I have to do let

we're we're dealing with the world we're we're dealing with situations we're human beings we're no different than anybody else but we've got a we've got an antidote and you just got to take the antidote you know it's like it's like the the the the uh prisoner that was in prison and the president had written a uh a statement to set him free it was a pardon that that you know because the the family went and said my son is innocent he's innocent but that you know that that individual had been so scarred with all the trials and all the mocking and all the people saying You're a murderer you did it you did it and he got so so depressed and so caught into the into the sin of the moment and then you know the family went to the president and the president saw his case and said I'm going to give him a pardon and he wrote the pardon and he says take it down to him and when they went to give it to him he he totally rejected them he said get away from me he he was he was so caught in his sin and unbelief he was so miserable he'd gotten into such a place because of the you know the scars and the and the hurts and all the pain that he didn't accept the pardon and they ended up having to put him to death and then the president had to come out and say listen a pardon is not a pardon unless the individual accepts and receives the pardon you need to accept that Christ paid in full glory to God Amen go to the next slide Easter Easter Sunday will be here and we'll be speaking on the stone is rolled away you were dealing with some stones in your life and you needed to roll them away and
