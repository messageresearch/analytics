[4:30] what the spirit
[4:32] saith on to the churches

[4:40] as we approach thee tonight we thank you
[4:43] for this
[4:44] wonderful privilege
[4:47] may the great holy spirit bless us
[4:50] together
[4:51] as we
[4:53] uh us thinking men and women
[4:56] pass through the filter of the blood
[5:00] may we think on these things
[5:04] putting our thoughts upon the things
[5:06] above
[5:08] and not being distracted by these things
[5:11] of earth
[5:12] and lord as we walk and talk and live
[5:16] for thee
[5:18] demonstrating and manifesting the word
[5:20] of the hour
[5:22] may you receive all the glory
[5:25] and the praise
[5:27] in the name of jesus christ our dear
[5:30] lord
[5:31] amen
[5:32] and amen
[5:36] as we
[5:37] said last week
[5:40] the
[5:41] name leodisia
[5:46] is a woman's name
[5:48] it was a commonplace name
[5:52] of women of that time
[5:57] it also means people's rights
[6:02] which was a very common thing
[6:05] in that day
[6:07] to have
[6:09] people
[6:11] wanting their
[6:14] their rights
[6:18] to their self
[6:20] uh that speaks of a day of selfishness
[6:23] of course and now
[6:25] we find that
[6:26] this name laodicea was a name
[6:31] of desire a name of honor
[6:34] rich
[6:36] um
[6:37] high born women
[6:41] all wanted to have that name
[6:45] something that others can look up to
[6:48] and admire
[6:50] when their names were called out
[6:53] as leo dcl
[6:57] this city
[7:00] my friends
[7:02] the city was the city of theopolis
[7:05] which is to say
[7:07] the city of zeus
[7:10] the god
[7:12] zeus
[7:15] it was a city of politics
[7:18] it was filled with a lot of political
[7:22] intrigue
[7:24] a lot of uh
[7:27] political importance
[7:30] was
[7:32] in the fabric of this city
[7:36] it was also
[7:38] a financial center
[7:41] it was
[7:42] a financially prosperous city
[7:46] it was a city admired by other cities
[7:51] as such
[7:52] it was an influential city
[7:56] it's influence was very far reaching
[8:01] in those days and times
[8:04] in which
[8:06] they live
[8:07] and as a financially flourishing city it
[8:11] attracted
[8:13] uh the richest the best the most
[8:17] dignified
[8:18] to that to live
[8:20] and dwell
[8:22] in that city
[8:25] it was also noted
[8:28] that this city
[8:30] of laodicea
[8:33] uh
[8:34] was a city filled with philanthropists
[8:38] a lot of
[8:39] went on
[8:41] and
[8:42] let me make a pause here
[8:45] because what i
[8:47] i desire to show
[8:49] uh with this
[8:51] message to you
[8:54] is the similarity
[8:56] between leodisia
[8:59] back then
[9:01] and our age
[9:04] of laodicea
[9:06] now
[9:08] so that we can
[9:10] uh focus on the parallels
[9:14] and these
[9:15] various similarities
[9:18] that we will
[9:20] find as we continue
[9:24] it was a city filled
[9:27] with philanthropists
[9:29] they had grown rich
[9:32] swelling with goods
[9:35] and so
[9:37] to satiate their
[9:40] uh sordid consciences
[9:44] that it would give them a better
[9:46] religious
[9:48] feeling uh i'm a good man i'm a good
[9:52] woman i'm a good person look i fed
[9:55] thousands of poor right look i've
[9:58] clothed
[9:59] thousands of of these needy
[10:02] uh
[10:03] look i've done this i've done that but
[10:06] they failed to realize
[10:09] this was the cry of the spirit against
[10:12] thou this age
[10:14] thou says thou art rich
[10:17] thou says i'm going prosperous every day
[10:20] i'm increased with goods
[10:22] but north down not
[10:26] miserable you're naked
[10:29] blind
[10:32] you don't even know it
[10:34] because you'll argue against that fact
[10:36] of course my eyes are wide open i know
[10:38] what's going on i know what's happening
[10:40] and you are blind
[10:43] and noise though not
[10:46] what a tragedy
[10:48] it's something for one to be blind and
[10:50] know it
[10:52] uh
[10:52] it's another thing to be blind
[10:56] and don't know it
[10:58] or blind and resistant to help
[11:01] blind walking to a a chasm a gulf
[11:06] walking to to your death
[11:09] and someone tries to tell you no don't
[11:12] go that way
[11:13] you're going to go over the cliff say oh
[11:16] no i'm seeing my way i know where i'm
[11:18] going and i don't need any help and
[11:21] shake off whatever i help you maybe uh
[11:25] that's what the spirit is referring to
[11:28] the attitude
[11:30] of the age in which we live
[11:34] blind
[11:36] miserable
[11:37] naked
[11:38] and don't even know it
[11:41] oh may god help us everyone
[11:44] in this age
[11:45] in which we live
[11:49] i want you to see also
[11:53] this city of lyodisia
[11:57] was a city of great medical schools
[12:02] great
[12:04] medical accomplishments
[12:07] and you must recognize we have the same
[12:11] thing in our day our times
[12:14] it was a
[12:15] seat
[12:17] my friends
[12:19] of all these great medical schools and
[12:22] as such it was a very distinguished city
[12:26] very much so
[12:28] and it was further distinguished
[12:31] for its arts
[12:33] and its various sciences
[12:37] it taught sciences
[12:39] now back then the word science used was
[12:42] also synonymous with magic
[12:45] because back then they taught a lot of
[12:48] magic alchemy and different things to
[12:51] various folks
[12:53] and that was that was thought or
[12:56] acceptable at that time
[12:59] as science now of course it's evolved
[13:02] and now we just use the word science
[13:06] like i'm using the word the terminology
[13:09] of magic
[13:10] towards because some of the
[13:13] accomplishments were thought
[13:15] through superstition
[13:17] to be magic
[13:19] and that human accomplishment
[13:22] so we must understand that evolution
[13:26] from
[13:28] magic
[13:29] to now we call it science
[13:32] and how it moved on from that time to
[13:36] this time in which
[13:38] we live
[13:40] now despite all of these wonderful
[13:44] things about this city that made it so
[13:48] fabulous
[13:50] and distinguished and influential
[13:54] this was a city who was constantly
[13:58] uh being uh let me let me say it was
[14:01] prone to earth earthquakes
[14:04] they often had earthquakes
[14:08] in that city of laodicea
[14:10] buildings shook architecture shook er
[14:14] capital building shook because they were
[14:18] having earthquakes
[14:20] after a while they become immune
[14:23] uh inured to earthquakes
[14:26] in other words they become
[14:28] um you so used to it
[14:32] that that they were just
[14:34] oh it's another earthquake it just
[14:36] shakes it'll go away another earthquake
[14:38] it just shakes but one day
[14:41] my friends
[14:43] i tell you the god who has allowed a lot
[14:46] of shaking to go on
[14:48] my friends it's going to shake this
[14:51] world one more time
[14:54] now
[14:55] this city of laodicea
[14:59] constantly being shaken by earthquakes
[15:04] it became such a city of fear
[15:09] misery
[15:10] constantly on the alert of how to escape
[15:15] a dangerous deadly
[15:17] sudden
[15:18] earthquake that would strike the city
[15:21] and after a while folks couldn't take it
[15:24] any longer and so they started an
[15:28] outward migration
[15:30] from this great city
[15:33] of laodicea
[15:34] they couldn't take it anymore too much
[15:37] fair
[15:38] too much uh misery uh mental problems uh
[15:43] and so they started to leave the great
[15:47] city of leodisia
[15:50] no wonder the scripture says how are the
[15:52] mighty fallen
[15:55] because what happened is that city
[15:57] became a ghost town
[16:01] it be a ghost city
[16:04] it was abundant
[16:06] by those who indwelted
[16:09] and became a habitation
[16:13] of buzzards
[16:15] hawks
[16:16] foul birds
[16:18] and every
[16:20] snakes rats and wild animals for no one
[16:25] lived there anymore
[16:27] it was completely
[16:29] abundant
[16:31] oh my friends
[16:33] i believe the character
[16:36] and nature of that city
[16:40] is so fitting
[16:42] that we ought to
[16:44] focus
[16:45] on these similarities
[16:47] and how it applies to our day
[16:51] and to our time
[16:53] their chief god as i mentioned
[16:57] was zias
[16:59] who was called the father
[17:02] of all gods
[17:05] the father of the gods
[17:08] all other so-called gods descended from
[17:11] him
[17:13] and he was the only one
[17:15] that could bring them together
[17:19] as the great father
[17:22] oh
[17:23] what a spiritual forecast for our age
[17:28] of this 20th century
[17:30] and of this idea
[17:33] that is floating
[17:35] in the atmosphere around us
[17:39] one god the father of us all
[17:43] oh
[17:44] and the father of all religions
[17:48] you may call him this the other one may
[17:51] call him that you may call him by
[17:54] different names but yet it's really one
[17:58] god and you have a right to call him
[18:01] whatever name you want to call him this
[18:03] one has a right to call him by whatever
[18:06] name they want to call him but it all
[18:09] comes down to
[18:11] no matter how we approach him
[18:14] it's just many rivers of religion
[18:18] leading to the one god the ocean
[18:22] of all knowledge this is the this is
[18:26] what is being said
[18:28] and taught
[18:30] this
[18:31] these are some of the ideas
[18:34] that are being floated
[18:36] to
[18:37] uh captivate the minds
[18:40] and imaginations of the people
[18:43] and to ensnare them
[18:46] into this
[18:48] uh one united church so-called
[18:52] that is already on its way
[18:55] oh
[18:56] one
[18:57] one religion
[18:59] to be on the face of the earth
[19:02] yes
[19:03] they speak of the fatherhood of god
[19:08] and the brotherhood of man yet they
[19:11] don't know who god is
[19:14] the generalization of god
[19:18] which only means
[19:19] any
[19:20] object of worship
[19:23] is a god
[19:24] so they say oh god
[19:27] so you're just saying object of worship
[19:29] but when you come to the fact what is
[19:32] the name of that god
[19:35] and
[19:36] our bible our scriptures tell us
[19:40] his name shall be called jesus
[19:43] for he shall save his people from their
[19:47] sins
[19:48] no they don't want to hear that they'll
[19:50] have any other name but not that name of
[19:54] jesus
[19:55] that honorable name that lovely name
[19:58] that wonderful name that powerful name
[20:01] that all conquering name they want
[20:04] nothing to do with it but they'll take
[20:06] any other name my friends nothing but
[20:09] demons behind such a move
[20:13] of one world church
[20:16] that would not
[20:17] have the name of jesus
[20:20] and what even in prison
[20:23] would stop you from
[20:25] speaking or living the way god wants you
[20:29] to live
[20:30] no matter how religious how legal lawful
[20:34] or whatever it makes itself it's really
[20:38] satan behind the scenes
[20:41] manipulating his puppets
[20:44] to bring about this kind of scenario
[20:48] yes
[20:50] when they talk about the fatherhood of
[20:52] god and the brotherhood of man
[20:55] then they said say this is the only
[20:58] thing
[20:59] that will bring together catholics and
[21:03] protestants
[21:05] this is the only thing
[21:08] that will bring together
[21:10] jews hindus
[21:13] mohammedans
[21:14] baha'u'llah jehovah witnesses
[21:18] baptists pentecostals everybody
[21:22] everywhere dancing to the same tune and
[21:26] on the same dance floor
[21:29] one
[21:30] father god
[21:32] the brotherhood
[21:34] of man
[21:36] and
[21:37] developing out of that
[21:40] uh go that that pot
[21:42] uh that witch's brew
[21:45] of so-called religion contrary to the
[21:49] word of god
[21:51] they want to say out of this they will
[21:54] be able to formulate
[21:57] a mutually acceptable
[22:00] form and way of worship that everybody
[22:04] despite their differences can rejoice
[22:08] and shout and sing and praise their god
[22:13] oh
[22:14] my friends and their field oh this way
[22:18] it will increase our love for each other
[22:22] it will increase our
[22:24] understanding for each other if we go
[22:29] this way of mutual love mutual respect
[22:33] nobody talk about anybody else nobody
[22:38] find fault with anybody else nobody will
[22:42] be able to say oh this is different no
[22:45] because that would not be according to
[22:49] them will not be right
[22:52] when the true sons and daughters of god
[22:56] were sent down here with the express
[22:59] purpose
[23:01] to separate right from wrong
[23:04] light from darkness truth from era back
[23:07] to the word back to the promise of our
[23:10] day and time when all sacredness and
[23:13] sincerity seems to have
[23:16] gone away
[23:17] we need to come back to the original
[23:19] faith where the holy spirit
[23:22] has a hold of our lives
[23:24] amen yes sir
[23:27] and we find friends
[23:29] right now
[23:31] many catholics and protestants
[23:36] many prominent catholics
[23:38] many prominent protestant
[23:41] evangelical
[23:44] preachers
[23:45] and
[23:46] religious
[23:48] princes of the church
[23:50] personalities
[23:52] are
[23:53] uh going hand in
[23:56] hand in hand
[23:58] down this road
[24:01] a brotherhood of man and the fatherhood
[24:05] of god
[24:07] and striving
[24:08] for that kind
[24:10] of religious
[24:11] unity
[24:13] and they are gaining ground
[24:16] with the
[24:18] motive
[24:19] my friends with this great motive in
[24:23] front of them
[24:24] that they will produce something that
[24:27] others will follow
[24:29] in the way that they go
[24:32] and this attitude
[24:35] is now being seen to be projected in
[24:39] and through
[24:41] what we know as the united nations
[24:45] yes and when world
[24:48] leaders
[24:50] are refusing
[24:52] to see
[24:54] different concepts
[24:56] and ideas
[24:58] about spiritual worship
[25:01] and all of them are beginning to come
[25:04] coming around to
[25:06] recognizing
[25:08] and recommending
[25:10] that all religions
[25:13] become leveled
[25:15] no difference
[25:18] because after all they're worshipping
[25:20] one god like in leodisia they believe in
[25:24] worshiping the same god zeus and all the
[25:28] other so-called gods are minor gods to
[25:30] him so they need to all
[25:33] worship him so
[25:36] so
[25:37] this is what is repeating in our time
[25:40] that leaders are starting to see
[25:44] their opportunities
[25:47] for
[25:48] control of their peoples
[25:51] by
[25:52] coming to this idea
[25:56] of one religion
[25:58] instead of having a confusion of
[26:01] thousands of various religions that they
[26:04] have to contend with
[26:06] if they have a state religion and of
[26:09] course this is in the laboratory in
[26:12] certain countries right now where
[26:14] certain countries already have
[26:16] established their state religion and any
[26:20] other religion that tries to
[26:22] come against that will be severely
[26:25] punished
[26:26] oh my friends
[26:28] look to the word of god
[26:31] our answers are in the word of god
[26:34] the prophecy
[26:36] and the word of god
[26:38] modern events
[26:40] being made clear
[26:42] by vindicated prophecy in our day and
[26:46] time
[26:48] yes
[26:49] so they believe
[26:51] if all the religions now this
[26:54] is happening now it's starting to happen
[26:57] it's on the cover but soon this will be
[27:01] in the public
[27:03] right
[27:04] that they will want to level all
[27:06] religions into one
[27:09] so
[27:10] they only have one major religion to
[27:14] fund
[27:15] to talk with the leaders
[27:17] and decide things with one religion
[27:21] rather than having uh
[27:23] thousands of them
[27:25] they prefer to deal with one and they're
[27:29] striving and working
[27:31] to that end so that they
[27:34] may have all the same purposes
[27:38] and we will look at all these religions
[27:41] being right
[27:42] because they are all serving
[27:45] this
[27:46] one god father of us all
[27:50] well
[27:53] this
[27:54] age of ledecia
[27:56] as the city of leodisia back then
[28:00] is an age of civil rights
[28:03] it's an age
[28:05] uh pervaded by
[28:07] uh a lot of selfishness a lot of
[28:12] unions
[28:13] a lot of everyone
[28:16] wants their rights
[28:18] regardless of who they are
[28:21] they're claiming
[28:22] their rights
[28:24] and not
[28:26] looking at how it affects
[28:28] other people's rights
[28:31] as long as they have
[28:33] their way
[28:35] and their rights
[28:37] of course people's rights also means
[28:40] justice for the people
[28:43] they're demanding
[28:44] justice for the people
[28:47] yes
[28:49] oh what a discussion
[28:51] that it would be
[28:53] if we were to discuss that
[28:56] and there never been an age
[29:00] like this age
[29:02] there's never been a century
[29:04] like this century that we are in
[29:09] all the nations
[29:11] are now rising up
[29:13] all nations all races all people rising
[29:17] up crying out
[29:18] for their liberty
[29:20] crying out
[29:22] for
[29:24] equality where
[29:27] they're looking to ah
[29:29] a beautiful golden age
[29:33] where all men
[29:35] will be really and truly equal
[29:39] but all that is my friend is
[29:42] the cry of the human heart for that
[29:46] but while you're on this earth
[29:49] you'll not have
[29:51] that real equality they may have it on
[29:54] paper
[29:55] they may have it in beautiful speeches
[29:57] songs and poetry but it will never occur
[30:01] here on the earth
[30:03] oh
[30:04] man will strive mind will fight man will
[30:08] do everything to bring it about but it
[30:11] will never happen while we are here with
[30:14] this wicked sinful
[30:16] perverted human hearts
[30:19] might turn away from god and the way of
[30:22] of the bible back to the word back to
[30:25] god's way amen back to the life and and
[30:29] teaching of jesus christ
[30:32] live the life of christ may he come into
[30:35] your heart forgive you of your sins
[30:37] cleanse you of your past and accept you
[30:40] into his kingdom where we can serve him
[30:43] with all our hearts and our lives
[30:46] oh yes
[30:48] they're demanding equality
[30:50] and they're demanding it
[30:53] socially
[30:55] and demanding it
[30:57] financially
[31:00] these things of course
[31:02] are things that i'm speaking on
[31:05] that have been already prophesied
[31:09] by
[31:11] william marion branham
[31:14] the prophet of this 20th century that
[31:18] people will be seeking financial
[31:21] equality
[31:23] social equality
[31:26] and the cry will be everywhere
[31:29] around the world
[31:31] oh
[31:32] oh my friends
[31:34] here we see it
[31:36] it's not they'll only have the equality
[31:38] and theory but they're not really going
[31:41] to have it in fact while we are here up
[31:44] on the earth oh
[31:47] this is an age also of a lot of politic
[31:49] politics and political disturbance
[31:53] because every party every group is
[31:56] seeking their rights
[31:58] and
[31:59] they'll use
[32:01] the the glove or the mask
[32:05] of uh
[32:06] political parties to be behind that and
[32:09] manipulate the fingers to create
[32:12] whatever uh world they think
[32:16] we should
[32:18] be living in
[32:20] and this is the reason
[32:23] in this age
[32:25] people are calling themselves oh we're
[32:27] christian democrats
[32:30] democratic but we're christian then
[32:33] others will say we are
[32:35] republican christians
[32:38] everybody's a christian
[32:41] social democratic christians
[32:45] like that and and we are also
[32:48] christian socialists and christian
[32:52] conservatives and christian
[32:55] liberals everything is mixed in
[32:58] uh
[32:59] all the iron the clay and everything is
[33:02] mixed in christian uh along that way my
[33:07] friends there it is
[33:10] and according to our
[33:12] liberal theologians
[33:15] some of them are trying to pull people
[33:18] into what is known as socialism
[33:22] and they take the very scriptures
[33:27] and teach
[33:28] that jesus was a socialist
[33:32] and that he practiced socialism
[33:36] and that the early church had all things
[33:38] in common
[33:39] so they were also
[33:42] socialists
[33:45] and we ought to
[33:47] be that way
[33:48] today
[33:50] what they continue to fail to understand
[33:55] that may be a very good and golden
[33:58] concept
[34:00] but it is only a concept now
[34:04] because with the perverted
[34:07] wicked
[34:08] human heart
[34:10] that will never be accomplished on this
[34:13] earth until the prince of peace comes
[34:16] jesus christ himself they'll cry peace
[34:20] peace peace there'll be no peace until
[34:24] jesus christ the prince of peace comes
[34:27] yes my friends
[34:29] oh
[34:30] i tell you friends
[34:32] the city of laodicea
[34:36] was a metropolis
[34:39] lots of people today think new york
[34:41] california tokyo mexico city their great
[34:44] metropolis says you know uh millions of
[34:48] people
[34:49] look they had metropolises
[34:52] way back in those days
[34:55] i stood
[34:57] on a mountain and watched
[35:00] the extent of the city of pompeii in
[35:03] italy
[35:05] it's not all been excavated
[35:08] but as far as your eyes could see
[35:11] houzz's house it was a metropolis
[35:15] and there were many other metropolises
[35:19] in those days
[35:22] there is nothing new under the sun
[35:25] the buildings may change the clothing
[35:27] may change up our of our language our
[35:32] terminologies and everything else what
[35:34] seem crude then we may do it in a more
[35:37] refined way we
[35:39] nothing new under the sunset solomon the
[35:43] wisest
[35:44] man
[35:45] that has ever lived
[35:49] a metropolis
[35:52] that had a one
[35:54] father god of us all
[35:56] government which was a forecast
[36:00] of what was going to come
[36:02] in this age with the similar attitude
[36:05] nature and spirit
[36:09] of one
[36:11] god ecumenical religion
[36:15] in the day
[36:16] in which we live
[36:20] now this that city is being
[36:23] uh
[36:24] gathered together again in spirit by
[36:27] great church councils
[36:30] great councils are meeting in their
[36:33] robes and in their riches
[36:36] discussing about this
[36:39] brotherhood
[36:40] fatherhood of god and brotherhood of man
[36:44] and and singing we are all brothers
[36:48] because jesus prayed let them be one as
[36:52] thou we i and you are one oh
[36:56] my friends that is the cry
[36:59] oh but
[37:00] i tell you
[37:02] we're seeing
[37:04] the binding together
[37:06] of the tears and the wheat
[37:09] all it's going on right now
[37:12] protestants
[37:14] catholics
[37:15] and everything else
[37:17] is coming together
[37:19] and the bundles are being bound together
[37:23] getting ready
[37:24] some for the harvest
[37:27] and some for the burning
[37:29] that lies ahead
[37:31] oh
[37:32] those of us were real believers real
[37:35] christian
[37:36] get ready
[37:37] it's harvest time
[37:39] it's harvest time
[37:41] the savior's crawling and the grain is
[37:45] falling oh do not wait it'll grow too
[37:48] late oh come home come home
[37:51] my friends it's harvest time praise be
[37:55] to god
[37:57] listen
[37:59] this
[38:01] city of ledicia
[38:03] was also
[38:05] as i said a city of great earthquakes
[38:08] which finally destroyed it
[38:12] and i believe this age
[38:16] will also end
[38:18] with great earthquake
[38:21] of course
[38:22] brother william marion branham
[38:24] has prophesied
[38:28] the downfall
[38:31] of hollywood
[38:34] this great city of angels
[38:38] located in the
[38:41] area of california
[38:44] prophecy already has gone forth
[38:49] that this city will sink beneath the
[38:51] waves
[38:52] and behind it his words thus saith the
[38:56] lord
[38:57] and so shall it be for it has been
[39:00] spoken
[39:02] and so shall it be done
[39:04] o my glory to god his words
[39:08] or the words of god through him
[39:11] must and will be fulfilled flee
[39:15] run for your lives
[39:17] all those of you who want to naturally
[39:20] of course abandon that that place that's
[39:23] up to you
[39:25] oh but my friends i'm preaching to you
[39:29] the word of god
[39:31] condemned
[39:33] condemned to be an empty place of every
[39:36] foul burden evil spirit that you can
[39:39] find on the face of the earth
[39:43] i tell you
[39:46] they've gone off
[39:49] making love to the old harlot
[39:54] church
[39:55] and the spirit and heart of pervading
[39:57] that city
[40:00] similarity of that city and of our time
[40:02] and age
[40:04] everywhere
[40:06] beautiful city but a harlot to the word
[40:08] of god beautiful churches harlots to the
[40:12] word of god
[40:14] my friends let us consider these things
[40:18] that are before us
[40:19] not with a a laugh a joke a shrug off
[40:23] but back to the bible back to the word
[40:26] of god this seems old-fashioned this
[40:29] seems ancient but let me tell you he has
[40:32] bought alpha and omega beginning in the
[40:36] end oh the circle has
[40:39] come around and we're going back my
[40:42] friends back to the original again
[40:45] listen
[40:46] as we see it in the word of god
[40:49] god is fixing to shake this world again
[40:54] he's fixing to give her a shaking that
[40:57] she's never had and one day he'll shake
[41:01] it
[41:02] so bad
[41:04] that when he shakes it
[41:06] at the very end
[41:08] it will also be a shaking
[41:10] and a renovation
[41:12] back to her original burning off evil
[41:16] and germs and devils and everything else
[41:19] will be burnt off and shall come right
[41:21] back renewed for the millennial kingdom
[41:24] of jesus christ the same yesterday today
[41:28] and forever oh my
[41:30] thank god help us
[41:33] yes a marvelously endowed city
[41:37] a city endowed with wet wealth
[41:42] a city full of culture
[41:44] dignified people
[41:47] a city
[41:49] abounding with sciences scientific
[41:52] achievements
[41:54] uh maybe they didn't have rockets like
[41:56] we had but we are seeing the same thing
[41:58] in our day
[42:00] dignity financial stability more
[42:05] trillionaires and billionaires than
[42:07] you've ever seen in your life it's
[42:09] happening right now let's not be asleep
[42:12] wake up and recognize your day and the
[42:15] message for your day don't let the devil
[42:18] rock you to sleep in a cradle of
[42:22] satisfaction but back to god's word may
[42:25] the word of god make you disturb
[42:29] and wake up to realize what is happening
[42:33] in our time lord jesus help us amen a
[42:37] city like today
[42:40] where are the churches were rich then
[42:43] and the churches are rich today
[42:47] unbelievably rich
[42:50] as the bible says increase with goods
[42:56] their
[42:56] worship
[42:58] beautiful
[43:00] worship but formal
[43:03] dignified
[43:06] cold
[43:07] dead
[43:09] yes dignified worship
[43:11] dignified but dead
[43:14] formal
[43:15] but no faith no revelation no
[43:18] understanding
[43:19] just singing to a
[43:21] an unknown god as paul said it
[43:25] yes just worshiping in that way
[43:28] beautiful
[43:29] wonderful atmosphere wonderful
[43:32] environment but
[43:34] contrary to the word of our god
[43:38] oh
[43:40] culture is everywhere
[43:43] beautiful paintings
[43:45] beautiful statues
[43:47] beautiful writings beautiful quotations
[43:51] of great men
[43:52] know all these things time will pass
[43:55] them away but the word of our god will
[43:58] stand forever
[44:00] a time
[44:01] filled
[44:02] with education
[44:04] yes
[44:05] an education
[44:07] has given way
[44:09] to replacing
[44:11] the holy spirit
[44:13] amen their work they want to have quick
[44:16] minds cunning minds
[44:19] oh they want to have minds like that
[44:23] instead of accepting hebrews 4 12
[44:26] the word of god is quick and sharper
[44:31] than every two-edged sword piercing oh
[44:34] my my brothers and sisters they reject
[44:38] the spiritual uh word of god they reject
[44:42] the person and ministry of the holy
[44:46] spirit with their lips they say they
[44:49] believe it they accept him but they
[44:51] reject him when he truly speaks the
[44:54] truth to them they reject him when the
[44:57] word of truth is unfolded and the light
[45:01] is shunned upon these rats and roaches
[45:05] creatures of the night they flee from
[45:07] this word of god not recognizing their
[45:10] day nor the message of their day and of
[45:13] their owl and they have allowed their
[45:16] faith
[45:19] their faith in this
[45:21] invisible god this invisible christ
[45:25] this jesus christ who died for our sins
[45:29] their faith has been superseded by their
[45:32] faith in science
[45:35] and that rather to believe science
[45:38] than to believe the revelation of the
[45:41] word of god
[45:43] thus
[45:44] bringing themselves to become victims
[45:48] of what their eyes can see
[45:50] victims of materialism
[45:54] yes
[45:55] prisoners
[45:57] of their five senses
[45:59] they can't get out
[46:02] of those prison bars
[46:05] of the senses
[46:07] amen
[46:08] of the
[46:09] you the natural man
[46:13] they want to hold on to those senses
[46:17] and so they're imprisoned by them
[46:20] and this causes what we know as
[46:23] sentiusness
[46:25] oh the entire world is becoming an
[46:30] sentius
[46:32] immoral
[46:33] world
[46:34] filled
[46:36] invaded saturated
[46:39] with immorality
[46:41] as it was in the days of noah
[46:45] as it was in the days of not lot
[46:49] so jesus said so shall it be but now
[46:52] today we can say so it is
[46:56] a time of violence
[47:00] a time of pornography and evil and
[47:03] senselessness
[47:06] but also
[47:07] because of the senses
[47:10] the sentence
[47:12] sexuality immorality
[47:15] on every hand has become an age also of
[47:19] unfaithfulness
[47:22] broken hearts broken marriages
[47:25] separations divorces on every hand we
[47:29] see it everywhere because it's the
[47:31] spirit of the age
[47:34] a marriage age
[47:36] an age of marriage and breaking up and
[47:40] going this way and uh people's rights
[47:43] and i have my right and you have your
[47:45] right and we have our rights and so it's
[47:48] that kind of a age of this chaos of
[47:52] culture and so-called dignity mixed in
[47:55] with their financial uh wealthiness and
[47:59] and and they try to cover up their
[48:01] consciences with their
[48:04] philanthropy and so on but it's all in
[48:07] the same pot
[48:09] and the
[48:10] witch's brew
[48:13] is now boiling on the fire
[48:16] while he satan sits there stirring the
[48:20] pot
[48:21] and waiting for it to become fully
[48:24] cooked
[48:25] yes but let's my friends the true
[48:28] believer
[48:29] is not waiting on his evil to come to
[48:34] its rightness
[48:35] before it comes to its rightness and the
[48:37] tribulation
[48:39] will be gone
[48:40] the rapture is at hand
[48:43] oh
[48:44] the
[48:45] great flight
[48:47] of the bride
[48:48] for the lord himself has descended with
[48:51] a shout and he said i'll take her away
[48:55] like a thief in the night
[48:58] with a secret rapture
