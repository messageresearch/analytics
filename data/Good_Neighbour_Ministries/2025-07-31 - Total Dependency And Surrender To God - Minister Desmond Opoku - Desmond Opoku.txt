Thank you for bringing brothers here this evening, Lord, to have fellowship with you. Father, I pray thee, Lord, let the Holy Spirit come down and take full control of this service. Father, without you, we have no words to say. And Father, we believe your word said wherever two or three people are gathered together in your name, you're in our midst. And we believe you are here to add just one step for our work. to heaven. Thank you, Lord. We give you praise. We give you the honor. We give you all the glory. Amen. And amen. Uh we're going to start uh this evening. Uh we're going to start this evening the trip that I took to Africa before we go into the word of God. I thank God that uh was a real struggle for me to go to Ghana. But any good thing there's always a battle. Satan will never let you do a good work. whether business as a child of God or doing God business because God is interested in everything that you do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because everything goes to the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whether money, health, preaching, worshiping, your entire life consists of God. Now we thank God for that. So I started a journey here. I'm not going through all the trials and stuff like that. I went to Ghana on uh I forget the date. As soon as I arrived I I arrived uh on Thursday. Friday I went to Kumasi right away and Sunday I went to the church and we have a wonderful tremendous time with the saints in Kumasi my and the one thing that was uh great is when we went to Africa me brother Kofi brother F we pray for a lady that he can't have a a child. So we pray for her and when we came 9 months time he had a baby boy. So that was I went there and I called her and he says he's going to go to church with me. So that was tremendous thing for me. So I I picked her up and we went to church and we brought that baby there. So everybody saw the evidence of the spirit of God that's behind us. So this gospel is not just you sitting here. It's real. And God came down. My goodness, we had a good service. Wonderful service. They couldn't they couldn't stop. They couldn't after the service. Nobody couldn't go. They we had a wonderful time. And then uh they want me back again but I went just only for 10 days. I couldn't have time to go there. So I went around and do some business for my after that I went to do a business of my own and the Lord helped me to achieve whatever I have to do. Everywhere I go God is there for me to to somebody there to help me. So it was good. Then after that uh I went to after uh after a couple weeks, a couple a couple days I went to the place where we building the church. My brother, can you put the the that thing down? I want you to watch a little video about what this church is building in Africa so that you all know what is going on, what our pastor is doing for every little thing that you place in the in the plate for the offering and then uh uh everything. So this is what is we accomplish over there. So I want you everybody to watch a little bit. Watch what is there. Yeah, this is the church now. It has a roof on. We started this church. Everybody saw that, right? Was just a a weed all the ground and just a foundation been there for years. So, Pastor Danny and the church, they managed to put this church. I I I don't know how attend this. [Laughter] Yeah. Yeah. I try to get everything not knowing I attend the camera said I show everything inside. You got I think I have a I have a I have a there's no audio audio on that. There's a voice on that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Whatever you can hear, maybe the Lord can open you ear. So They were congregation member already. I didn't know that inside of the church. &gt;&gt; This is inside inside of the church. The roof is there. This is the inside of the church. This is their secretary. &gt;&gt; The secretary is here. &gt;&gt; This is the This is the church secretary. &gt;&gt; You know this girl here? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I have a story about her. &gt;&gt; That's my girl. &gt;&gt; This all the money that I send there. I I everything goes to this girl and he give it to the church to the pastor. Everything, every penny that I send there, she received it and gave it to the the pastor to do the work. That's why I said she is the secretary. Okay, I think it's okay. Now, uh now you see the little the the two pillars that was in the front. Now the roof is on there as we are talking now. &gt;&gt; They put the the roof on this. Before you go inside the church, there's a porch, small porch. Before we go inside the church, there's a roof on now. &gt;&gt; So the side and the side they they put in a blocks to to close that gap over there so that everything will be in. So that church is right now what what they doing now they are pastoring inside and uh now they they this week they are worshiping inside. See? Yeah. Because they have no place to worship. So they are worshiping inside this week. And you know that little little young girl there, the testimony about that girl. Yesterday I called a girl, that young girl, I felt led to call her and uh you pick up the phone. Last time I call her, her her daddy was there drunk. He she drank. She didn't know what she was talking cuz I know that her daddy when she was when the the the young boy was maybe eight or something like that cuz that time I was young. So I know her daddy and he was drunk. She said she always drank. He always drank. So yesterday I called her and I was talking to her and I said, "How is your daddy?" And I I said he said my daddy is no more drinking. And I said why? He said whatever I got she won't allow me to take it by herself or she she want what she get to. So she stopped drinking. And now she's going to church with her. Every time she go to pray she goes with her. And now she I talked to him and I said, "I'm no more the same last time when you talked to me. I'm waiting for you when you come to baptize me." The life of that little girl there change her father. That's what we talking about. It's not what you do with what you are producing in your life as Christian. That's very very important that little girl because some time ago I was I when I was going brother Simon gave me a gave me a a little computer and a phone that uh I pray when I go whoever God lead me to give it to I said okay. So I went I did I never have anything so I left it there in my in my place in my bag. So this time when I went I felt led to take that computer with me still I didn't know who I have to give it to and the phone. So when I went there after I went all around to see I felt led to give it to this little girl. So yesterday when I was talking to her dad, he said, "I want to thank you for for the gift that you gave it to my daughter. Her computer is broken and she's always crying that you you he want money to buy this computer. He doesn't have and I gave her that computer. I said, "Thank you, Lord." He went to the right place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. the leadership of the Holy Ghost. It's very important. And I went there another time to before I come, I I left over there. I went there one evening and I gather all of them speaking to them about about about the gospel. And God was moving mightily. My brothers, God is with us. When we when we speak, we speak with authority. We speak the word that God has placed in our heart. Is what you hear from this pulpit here is not just a talk. It's not just normal preaching you hear from here. People are craving for this a lot. So what you get every time you come to church, try to get something out from that. Very very important, very very powerful. You see us standing here. Don't let us become a common to you. God has called us as a minister for you and for others. Whoever open the heart is what he he will receive what is coming out from here. You're going to reach a time you're going to think oh you craving but that time you don't have it. Okay. So I was speaking to them while I was speaking to them a young man came. I was speaking to them for how to they need the Holy Ghost. They need their ticket and I was giving them samples. How I came here, I have to have a ticket otherwise I cannot fly to over here. I cannot just go there. I'm going to Ghana or I'm going to Canada. I need a ticket. So you need a ticket, the Holy Ghost before you can enter to the kingdom of God. Without the Holy Ghost, you cannot get there. Why I'm and why I'm talking to them with the scriptures and everything? One young man just pops up. So what shall we do to receive the Holy Ghost? Said, "Praise God." Hallelujah. Today what we read in the Bible is right in in the in front of me. What shall we do to receive the Holy Ghost? Hallelujah. I I was so impressed and I was so I I I don't know. It just came to me like a a magnet and the worst was coming every They don't want me to move cuz the worst was coming powerful. The Holy Ghost was moving. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And why I'm talking all these people were young men and old old people and all of them said when we finish they all coming to that church. So this church that we see there one day one of you or some of you going to stand there and see the evidence what you are producing there. &gt;&gt; I thank God for that. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's where I I I I I I was and I I finished. I couldn't get time and I said I will come back maybe if the Lord tells November if the Lord tells I will try to go there and the people that the people that maybe the church will be very almost done and I I believe a lot of them are waiting for me to baptize them. When I go there, they are waiting and all the people, brother Philip, we baptized them that time when we went, they all waiting for this place to be finished so that they can come and worship there. Yes. So everything that we do, God is doing. &gt;&gt; Not us doing, God is doing through you and me. We thank God for our pastor for God place in his heart to do such a tremendous work. We will not see here but one day when we cross over and these people come. God bless you my brother. God bless you my sister. Where do I know you? Praise God. Hallelujah. And God will show you way down that village there where brother Desmond was born. Hallelujah. Cuz you know what excited me? I was born over there and I came over here and what I got I sent over there. And what I got is not just a normal thing. It's the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. The greatest thing ever happened to my life I took over there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My brothers and my sisters, when I came to this message, I didn't understand nothing. One night, I had a dream and I went and told brother Simon, I saw brother Abraham in my village. I didn't know nothing. And my brother whom me and brother Kofi pray for and and the Lord heal him with a two strokes his room he gave it to brother Abraham to stay there and I went with brother Bra and he gave his room for brother Ram to stay there and brother Abraham was thanking him for what he done not knowing the message one day is going to go there. And when the message go there, she he is the one God started and heal him. &gt;&gt; Wow. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He healed him and the whole village got uproar. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My brethren, let me tell you, you are not sitting here by chance. &gt;&gt; This gospel is real. Anything that happened to your life, don't take it granted. After that I came back that's that's my my my my trip was almost end. So I travel back to Ara day before I have to come to Canada. I have in mind there was another church that I will go and visit at Manasim. Me and brother brother Kofi and brother Simon we went to preach over there some time ago. I I preached that place before and I baptized about about 10 people over there before and I went over there. That's the picture there. Maybe you can show that picture there for them to see. This church is is young people. They they are there. Can you can is there any way you can make it a little bit Yeah. Yeah. You see brother Sam, brother brother Desmond. He's like a little kid. You see there? He's the one in the middle there. The pastor is the one the pastor is this one here. The one beside me over there. Yeah. That's brother Robert. See all young people, you see that when they begin to worship, my brethren, they worship, they bang their hand, they dance, everything is lively because why? They are young. Yeah. And the when the young people do that, the old people does that too. &gt;&gt; It motivate them. They all dancing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. And I minister over there. My brethren, the Holy Ghost came down mightily. One man got up. He start screaming and and he start screaming like that, screaming like and after that the pastor came to me. They never see that kind of thing in their church before. My brethren we standing here we look small we look I don't know why where why we look but Holy Ghost is in us when we go somewhere God honor what we have you have something special for us minister to you please do Do not underestimate the word. You see how the pastor is ministering to you your future where you going to be in dimensions. You think it's just a talking is reality. What you what he talking one day you going to stand there and see what he's talking about. It's not a joke. When I minister over there, I told them I said when I minister, I am serious because it's real to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have experience what what happened in the day of Pentecost is happen to me the same day today. Why I stood there and minister and somebody said, "What shall we do to receive the Holy Ghost?" Can't we don't read in the Bible in the day of Pentecost it's read we read every day it's happen today. &gt;&gt; So we are in something tremendous right now. So we had a good time. The Lord shook there and everybody so many people were crying. crying, not just like there crying tears. And when I was minister, I couldn't stop crying because my heart was heavy for on those people. I want God to do something special for them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And they were receiving and pulling. I couldn't stop. My brethren, we had a good time. And the message that I preach over there, the same message I'm going to talk to you right now. Total dependency and surrender to God. Total dependency and surrender to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I don't want to go to that right now. We're going to go to the word of God. This is then after that I came and then the following day here is brother Desmond in Canada. Hallelujah. Amen. That's why I'm tell you I am the happiest person in the face of the earth. I cannot be happy for you. I'm happy for myself. Hallelujah. You have to enjoy. You have to enjoy your salvation. when I finish and they singing a cold. So I said, "No, give me a happy song so that we all can rock like that. I have to dance in the presence of God and then they pull this instrument." Oh my brothers, like a you know the cockroach cockroach when they fall down on their back and they want to get up and they can't get up, they turn like this. Hallelujah. I had a good time with them. Yes, you come to the presence of God, you have to have a good time. Yes, you have to be happy and joyous. God has given us such a wonderful salvation that nobody has. At the same time, you are being protected by him. You are protected by God. Those out there, they don't know whether they going front or they going back. But God has set his eye upon you as a child of God. God bless you. Let us stand. I'm going to read the word of God. Hallelujah. I won't keep you all night. I'm going to give you just a little bit. Maybe 12:00 we can leave. Hallelujah. Amen. Because let me tell you in in in heaven there is no time, &gt;&gt; right? So we have to we have to exercise here so that when we go there we not get to get tired. Hallelujah. Amen. We going to read the book of uh Matthew chapter 18 verse 1-6. Oh God, bless your word and let us enjoy this word tonight. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen and amen. At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, and said, Verily, I say unto you, except ye be converted and became as a little child, little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of God. You hear what he said? Except ye be converted. If you are not converted, you cannot be like a little child. You're going to be a stubborn, you will not going to listen. Hallelujah. Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greater greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And who so shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me? But whosoever shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, who are the children, you who believe Christ, it it were better for him that a millstone were hang about his neck and that he was we were drowned in the depths of the sea. May the Lord add his blessing. You may be seated. My my topic is total dependency or surrender to God. You see the disciples they want they wanted to know who is the greatest among them. And then the Lord Jesus Christ called a little little child and he brought among them. Except I say unto except ye be converted and became as a little children you shall not enter the kingdom of God. Why? He said it has to be like a little children. You know little children they don't depend upon themsel they depend upon their parents because they cannot do nothing for themsel as we we are sitting here right now in spirituality. What can you do without the Holy Ghost? You depend the Holy Ghost. Otherwise, you cannot understand this word that we are preaching. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You depend the Holy Ghost. You need to be humble yourself. You be you need to become a little child that we the word of God can control you. &gt;&gt; This little child, you know, you have children. When the child hurt or sick or anything, he's crying. No matter how much headache, the mama go there, goes there and pick up the child or the daddy, the little child upon all the pain that he's going through. He go, you stop crying. He depend the love that the parents have for that child or through the pain and the love that they pick up that child. He make that child have confidence on them that's going to be well. We have to become like children can be ruled by the word of God. Sometime the pastor will you do something and the pastor will call you or the deacon will call you and tell you this instead of them to humble yourself your temper rises nobody don't know your heart holy ghost know you can't even become that blood child to listen A little chestilement. How can you grow in the presence of God? This little child here, children, they humble themselves. The parent feed them. What they do? They begin to grow to be mature. When they get mature, they become adults. So do we. We come to the presence of God. We have to be mature in the presence of God. Why? By staying and humble ourself like little children so that the they can feed you. The word the pastor can feed you and you grow in the presence of God to be maturity. Then you can go outside and show the maturity in the pre what God you are fed from God and show it outside there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Your life, your life is Christian. You are life. You call yourself a Christian. Why is the Christian's life? Except you become that little children. Little children they cannot be rude because you depend. Cuz they cannot cook by themselves. They cannot grow by themselves. They cannot do nothing by themselves. So they depend upon the parents. So you have to depend upon God and humble yourself and learn the statues of God. Then you can grow maturity and then you can go outside there and show that these people has been with Jesus. How many years these disciples stood with the Lord Jesus Christ and when the Lord Jesus Christ left them when they go outside the life they that they live in the day of Pentecost nobody can tell them that these people never been with cannot tell them that these people why they can tell them they are different because they have been with Jesus the character the Same thing the Lord Jesus Christ was doing. That's what they were doing outside. They never live different life. They never live different walk. The Bible says when even they were walking on the street, their shadow healed the sick. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The people believe the same belief that they were believing in their on their master when the master left that belief fell upon the disciples because they have believed Jesus Christ and their characteristic is the same never change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometime we resemble our parents. You see my forehead. You see Rebecca forehead is the same. Why they are my loins? Are we in the loins of the Lord Jesus Christ that the people can see us? Are you able to manifest the life of Christ that is in you outside? The Christianity is not only in the church, it's in your work. It's outside restaurant. Everywhere you go, the Holy Ghost is in you. Are you allowing the Holy Ghost to manifest through you? Can somebody see you and say this one has been with Jesus? Sometime people sit in the church and when they go from the church to outside the parking lot, they are fighting within themsel inside. They don't want to talk to the sister. The brother don't want to talk to the brother. Is that Christlike your own brother or your sister living in the church? You fighting with a just a little pity thing that you not supposed to fight with. When are we going to grow in the presence of God and to be ripe that God can use us? Are we sitting here for nothing? We are sitting here so that we can manifest the love of God deep in that. Jesus is what love. Love your brother. Love your sister. Love anybody that comes your way. You will see Christ in every one of us. You see this little little guy? He didn't say nothing to the father. She lived the life. He said he's a young girl, teenager. She lived the life. What the father saw that he said no. What you have, I will never allow you to have it alone. I would I want that one too. You know how how I jump and how I was. I spoke to that boy yesterday. I was so happy especially when he said when you come I wait when you come you come you coming to baptize me. One person in Christ worth everything. All my trips that I went to Africa, one soul were anything that Donald Trump has, anything that big, anything that Amazon has, anything. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; One soul in the kingdom of God. Please, we are not joking. this little petty petty things that you don't you do and you can't see the c you know when you do things wrong you can't see you can't pray how you going to have something a grudge a little grudge against your brother or your sister and you go God bless you sister why why why you drawing the hand you you you try to pull back you drawing the hand you pulling back but because some maybe somebody see God bless you sister then you just take your face like that and you you just go your way. Come on brethren those things are gone. &gt;&gt; And sometime even the married people you you one of you get something wrong and maybe the the husband say this and that and that then they get mad. They don't talk to you maybe one month. When they see you, they put the food on the table. But if you want to eat, eat. It doesn't work. Brethren, brother and the sister, we do that. Let everything go and let the Holy Spirit have his way &gt;&gt; so that we can be like Jesus on the street. &gt;&gt; Amen. God can manifest through you and me. It's time now. Where is the bride of Christ now? Where is the bride? You know when you something affect you like that and you come to church and maybe you praying the piano or maybe you singing or you doing something and you coming about, don't you know you releasing the spirit? Don't you know you receive the spirit to the church? The pastor can't be fighting. He has to fight hard and he cannot penetrate through the heart of the people because there's a there's a there's a block there that you blocking the message. The message cannot do whatever it's supposed to do. Brethren, those days let it go. God is here. He is talking to you and me. Not only one person. He is talking to you and me. &gt;&gt; Let us lead the life so that we can see Christ in our lives. &gt;&gt; You know, you know the sister I think one time I said that while he was sitting down there the sister has a leukemia and he said can I pray for you sister? And when she prayed for that sister, he went to brother Abraham. Brother Abraham said the child is already healed. You have this thing in your heart against your brother and your sister. You think God going to hear your prayer. God will never hear a prayer. The spirit cannot manifest among us. How can we get a testimony if we don't clean oursel? &gt;&gt; God need his testimony. Let us not block what God has given to us. This is serious business. God business is serious. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not a joke. It's not a joke at all. Oh, one brother sit here. Oh, brother, can you take can you get up and sit here? He said, "Oh, that's my seat. Why you sit me here? Why you sit me here? Come on. The only thing you need, no matter where what you in the church, you have to sit where you sit that you can hear the word of God. Let nothing distract you because Satan will never leave you alone. He will always do something to distract you and you come to the church. You come, you wake up and comes to the church, he gonna he going to smack you and that day you will never get nothing and you go back same way that you came in. It never work. This is real. We want God to use us. How many of you want God to use you? How many of you want God to use you? Then we have to change our life and let the Holy Ghost manifest through our life. Hey, the day of Pentecost is same, never change. Is the same, never change. Where their shadows heal the sick, the Satan see them, they scream. You see Paul, Peter and all of them. You see the Bible say you can be angry but sin not. When something happen, you talk about it and let it go. You're free. I always have something like if you have something against me, I go there, I snore, p you have that in there, you cannot sleep. You roll around. Tomorrow when I see him, you're going to see then you roll around here. Then that that time as soon as he tell you closing your eye I stand on your face. Satan will bring me front in front of you say it's me he's tormenting me. It's you tormenting your own self because you allow Satan to come to you. You are the light of the world. Let the light shine through you. Let the darkness free and let the Holy Ghost manifest through you. God want to use you whether you like it or not. You see here, listen to here verse six. He said he said said, "But whosoever offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it shall be he shall it were better for him that mstone were hang about his neck and that he were drawn into the depth of the sea." You have a the whole God protection on you. Somebody did something to you. The barrier is not yours. The barriers is the Lord. &gt;&gt; And your sister and your brother did a little thing for you. You said, "No, I'm not going to give it. I'm not going to release it. I'm not I'm not going to let it go." And God, the creation of the whole world, everything that your eye can see, that you can feel, and you can hear, you can do, everything. That's your five senses. Who did that? God did that. He give you all this thing to leave with your flesh. At the same time, he has promised you that you're going to live in heaven. And this little bit of thing there, you can't forgive your brother or your sister. How you want God to use you? Please let us be like this little children. You think the Lord Jesus Christ brought this little children here? We want to be heaven. We want to be in heaven. You want to be the the the the bride of Christ in heaven to judge the world but you your own brother or your sister sitting in the church or somewhere you cannot forgive that person or the sister how you going to be the greatest? He said ex said become that this little children. The little children the little children what they humble peace joy obedience kind they don't know nothing. You never mind how the the father beat him or the mother beat that spank that little child because don't say oh you beat your say yeah Bible say yeah spare the water and spo the child you you I I did that to strengthen my children if they want if the government were to take me he can take me they did that one time but I never for I never stop if I don't do that the Bible said dear brain is young. Straighten them up so that they can stay straight. The pastor will whip you with the word of God so that what you can be straight. This little this thing that we talking is not just talking. It's real. It's in our midst. Am I lying? Maybe somebody here is do have that thing there. I don't know. But I just fell to to minister the word the same thing that I preach over there. I felt led to speak the same way the Holy Ghost is in our midst &gt;&gt; leading us. It's we who are here. We have to allow ourself to be this little girl so that God can manifest through our midst. Do you want to see God in our midst? We going to bring the future here. the love among us through our prayer and then the will get up from here. You never see if you have ever seen that. I see two times I one time I went to do a work in Toronto while I was working this man sat in the wheelchair. He almost like dead when I went. He was sitting like that. Two doctors standing beside beside him. Not doctors, nurses. The wife was the wife was in the corner talking to the man that I went with. Why I was doing I was praying my heart. I said, "Lord, is that how we going to live in this world and go back the same way?" I was praying in my heart for that man for God to do something for those people to see the power of God that we are here to manifest the Christ to the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So after I after I finished my job, I went straight there to his wife. I said, "You wouldn't mind if I pray for your husband?" He said, "Oh, he's sitting there. You can pray for him as much as you want." Said, "Thank you." I went there. I stood beside inside that man. The two nurses came and I said, "Do you believe Christ?" He said, "Yeah, I'm a Christian." I said, "Come and stand here." I lay my hand upon that man. When I went, the man never he always like that. He never open his eye. I lay my hand upon him. As soon as I finish, he raised up his his head, look at my face, get up from the wheelchair, start running inside the house, start running the from here, he come here and go here. He didn't want, he didn't go back and sit on the wheelchair. He sat down suffer. And the man standing there, his wife, the wife was screaming, "Hey, hey, what's going on my house? What's going on my house?" And the man standing there his his and he came and told all his workers what happened in that house. I see I'm not just talking I see God manifesting. &gt;&gt; So you is not for only one for every one of us who allow himself for God to use. God will use you. Thank you. &gt;&gt; God is serious for his business. &gt;&gt; I see so many things over there. When I went when I minister everybody want it's you it's like when you eat mango Africa when you eat mango or any sweet or m you throw it out. You see the bees come the flies come they go everybody all the the incense goes to the mango there. What do they need from the mango? The sweetness inside that mango attract those bees, those insects. So do we. How can we attract the people? The sweetness of Christ that is in you will attract those out there. So if you never stay here and ripe and you are sour, how can you attract those people out there? You can. Please, we have to be sweet in Christ and this little little preies let it go and let the Holy Ghost have his way from you and me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So that they will say these people has been with Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is what we want. We always talk about brother Abraham. where Abraham has power for his own. No, the sweetness of Christ was in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That attract the whole world even pope he thinking the whole world a leader. Can Pope stand with Abraham? Why he didn't heal for his nothing in England? Why he didn't heal will ab the congressman American congressman when you go to India why he didn't heal the people there you think it was brother Abraham the same God is in us today &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; didn't take Christ the Christ is here right now &gt;&gt; hallelujah he's in you and me because it's a promise said I will be with you living in you till the end of this world. The word is end. No, we are still in the world. So the sweetness of Christ has to be in us so that the world can see we are his people. &gt;&gt; My brethren, the time will come. We are the pillars in this world. If God take these pillars out from here, the world will collapse. &gt;&gt; We are the one holding these pillars right here. The four corners of the world. The bride is holding that four corners of the world. If the rapture come that go, the pillar take out everything pew. So if you are bride of Christ, you sisters, you know your husbands, I am a h I I'm a husband too. My wife want something he comes to me. I cannot deny her. You understand? I cannot deny her. What do you need, honey? Oh, maybe my bill. They just send me a bill. I don't have money. Come on, give me that paper. I go to the bank. I pay. Please come. Why do you think we we we God has called us? Cuz we are the wife of Christ. Can anything can God withhold anything from you? If you ask God, God can he hold anything from you? No. Please is we are the one getting away from him if we come close to him. One time me and brother f I I brought a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a cassette here. We pray a young man from Africa during the war. He was in Africa jungle. Nobody all he living was lions and stuff like that. no protection. He found God on the bush and he became mighty everything that he as he said my father my father will do this he when somebody sick my he asked my father and they heal him he did so many thing that they didn't understand you know what they did they brought him to America they tried to perfect him polish him and after a while they kill him. Don't let this word polish you. Let the word of God polish you and stay away from the things of the world and then you will see the hand of God in your life. Please, I'm sorry to talk like this, but we need Christ. We need him. We can't just every day, day and night, day and night, day and night. You going to serve God in your life and you never see him one time, just one time, you I challenge you, you just go pray sincerely to God. If God has shown me and he has shown me and he I pray and he did to me, he did for me and it was real. Can he do for you? I challenge every one of you since I go ask God that you want to see him. Moses asked one time, he said yes. You don't you don't see my face but you can see my back. He showed his back to Moses. He didn't do he did. Moses Moses was a man like me and you. He did. He was a son. Same thing to you. You I I challenge every one of you. Go tonight and praise his forgive everybody. Whatever you have against somebody, forgive that person and say, "God, I'm sorry." If you have done something wrong, approach your sister or your brother and say, "Forgive me. I didn't know what I was doing. Let everything began. Brothers, hug yourself and pray to God what you need. If God will never show you, ask one time that you want to see him. Ask one time in your life. If God will never show you, he show me, he going to show you. He show me so many times. So if he show me so many times, he can't show you. He can show you. We stood on the gospel since 1986. I stood here in chastisement. So many mistake and I grow in the presence of God. And now I am ready for to be used for the glory of God. I became like a child. I learn to be obedience to the word of God. Now God said, "Now you are ready, Moses. Go and take the people out." Now I'm ready. It's my turn. I'm going the whole world one day. Maybe I have a plane by myself and travel the whole world and do the work of God. Are you going to do that too? &gt;&gt; Deep within your heart, do that. And God will bless you. God will use you. You see the hand of God and you're going to be rejoicing every day. You know, brother Simon always talk about sister Natasha when he went and the demon was screaming. The demon was screaming. What is that? He didn't have no power. He said that's talk about the policeman. He doesn't have no power but he has authority. &gt;&gt; You have all the authority of God behind you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. All authority behind you. But live right and let God move and you you going to be you going to be the the the happy person in your life that you see God face to face. God bless you. I have this little exitation. I hope you be a blessing to you. &gt;&gt; Thank you &gt;&gt; and worship the Lord. Go and be a different person. If you have something against your brother or your sister, make things right. If you want to be used, you hear this word here. If you want to be used of God, make things right and forgive one another and let the let the love of God prevail in our midst.
