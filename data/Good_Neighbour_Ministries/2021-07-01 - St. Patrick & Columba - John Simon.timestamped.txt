[0:00] [Music]
[0:15] another
[0:16] wonderful evening
[0:20] another holy night
[0:24] wonderful indeed for the stars of god
[0:28] are brightly shining the great
[0:31] messengers
[0:32] that god has sent are
[0:36] all shining brightly
[0:39] in the skies of the heart
[0:42] of the true believers and may the great
[0:45] holy
[0:46] spirit help us
[0:49] all to understand
[0:53] their reflections and projections
[0:57] of the light of the sun
[1:00] may the great holy spirit visit with us
[1:03] and bless us all tonight god to
[1:07] god be the glory great things he has
[1:11] done
[1:12] i'm glad to be here with you friends and
[1:15] to share
[1:16] god's word from the bottom of my heart
[1:19] and from this glorious wonderful
[1:22] timeless book of which critics
[1:26] have hammered against it but the anvil
[1:30] remains
[1:31] and the hammers have all been worn out
[1:35] and gone for the word of god stands
[1:38] secure
[1:40] heavens and earth will pass away
[1:43] but my word will never
[1:46] pass away saith the lord
[1:50] now as we look into this scripture
[1:54] reading this fourth church
[1:58] age in revelation
[2:01] chapter 2 verse
[2:05] 18 and unto
[2:08] the angel of the church
[2:11] in thyathira right
[2:16] these things saith the son of god
[2:20] who had his eyes like onto a flame of
[2:24] fire
[2:25] and his feast are like
[2:29] fine brass we'll
[2:32] also like to read as a background
[2:38] out of matthew chapter
[2:41] 23 reading from
[2:45] verse 27
[2:48] to 31 and it reads
[2:53] woe unto you scribes and pharisees
[2:59] hypocrites for you are
[3:03] like unto whited sepulchers
[3:07] which indeed appear beautiful
[3:11] outward but are within
[3:15] full of dead man's bones
[3:19] and of all uncleanness
[3:23] even so ye also
[3:26] outwardly appear righteous
[3:31] unto men but within
[3:35] you are full of hypocrisy
[3:39] and iniquity
[3:42] wow unto you scribes and pharisees
[3:45] hypocrites because you build
[3:49] the tombs of the prophet
[3:53] and garnish the sepulchers of the
[3:56] righteous
[3:58] and say if we have been
[4:01] in the days of our fathers we would
[4:05] not have been partakers with them
[4:09] in the blood of the prophets
[4:14] wherefore ye be witnesses
[4:17] unto yourselves that you are the
[4:21] children of them
[4:23] which killed the prophets
[4:27] god's blessing upon his wonderful
[4:31] words of life
[4:34] now the last time we were here
[4:39] we talked about the true church
[4:42] and the false church
[4:45] and the continuous effort
[4:50] like cain with abel the continuous
[4:53] effort to kill off to
[4:56] persecute silence
[5:00] the true church god's little flock
[5:04] which is always under the
[5:08] criticism and destruction
[5:11] danger of destruction by the false
[5:15] church
[5:16] but thank god he never leaves himself
[5:20] without a witness and god always
[5:24] has a little flock and here again we see
[5:28] the hand of god
[5:30] that in the midst of the persecution
[5:35] the darkness of this
[5:39] evil age of tayatara
[5:43] that god in the midst of it all
[5:47] preserved a little flock
[5:51] and we thank god for that
[5:55] now as the church
[5:58] and when i say the church i'm including
[6:01] true and false together
[6:05] now we find that the church split into
[6:08] two parts
[6:11] the eastern and
[6:14] the western you may even have
[6:18] a pieces of that
[6:21] still uh
[6:24] pointing those truths to us today
[6:28] as some of you know that there are still
[6:30] the eastern arm of the church
[6:33] and the western arm also of the church
[6:38] now within these two divisions ever so
[6:41] often there would be glimmers of light
[6:45] and truth and power for
[6:48] men would arise from the midst
[6:52] of of them and within these two
[6:55] arms and divisions and they would
[6:58] lead some segment or part of the church
[7:02] into some deeper truths deeper life
[7:06] and closer walk with god
[7:11] well such a man in the western division
[7:14] was
[7:14] saint francis of a city
[7:18] and he was truly successful
[7:22] with the work that he was doing for the
[7:25] glory
[7:26] of god but finally
[7:30] all of his work was put under
[7:34] the control and power of the hierarchy
[7:38] of rome then there was
[7:41] peter waldo he was just a merchant
[7:46] but a godly man who surrendered his life
[7:51] surrendered his all and committed
[7:54] himself to serving the lord
[7:57] in a very active way
[8:00] and drew many many were drawn to jesus
[8:03] christ
[8:05] because of this man's life and of his
[8:09] ministry and so as he
[8:14] took the word of god out to the
[8:16] multitudes
[8:17] once again we see the false church
[8:22] twerked his works obstructed him
[8:26] and also he was excommunicated
[8:30] by the then pope out of
[8:33] the western part of the church
[8:38] but you see what i'm saying is that out
[8:41] of the
[8:42] western part out of the eastern part
[8:47] there was no man with such
[8:51] light grace and power to
[8:54] yet arise that could fulfill
[8:58] that part of being the messenger
[9:03] to the triathlon church
[9:06] age however
[9:10] there were two men in the british isles
[9:14] that we must think about
[9:18] and consider for this of course
[9:21] one of them has already been identified
[9:26] as the messenger to this age
[9:29] by the prophet of this 20th century
[9:33] our precious brother william marion
[9:36] branham and indeed
[9:40] these two men were outstanding
[9:44] bought in their supernatural ministries
[9:48] of the word and their
[9:51] supernatural ministries and exploits
[9:55] and de-up and deeds by the power
[9:59] of the precious holy spirit
[10:03] they were fully recognized and these two
[10:06] men were saint patrick
[10:11] and saint columba
[10:14] it was to columba
[10:18] that the responsibility fell
[10:23] to be the messenger of the lord
[10:27] of this church age
[10:30] of sayatyra but we would
[10:34] love to speak about saint patrick
[10:40] for he is a notable saint of god
[10:44] and he needs to be recognized
[10:48] and we need to recognize him so that we
[10:51] may
[10:52] take from him an example
[10:56] of righteousness and of walk with the
[11:00] living god
[11:02] and also we find that i speak
[11:06] we want to speak or we speak on saint
[11:09] patrick
[11:11] to debunk lie
[11:15] that is in the historical
[11:18] roman church that saint patrick
[11:22] was one of them when
[11:26] we look into the historical
[11:29] and practical facts we
[11:32] find out that saint patrick
[11:36] of course he
[11:40] had never actually been to rome
[11:44] and he had never been commissioned
[11:48] by rome and there is no
[11:52] claim in other words it's a total lie
[11:58] for them to claim that patrick
[12:02] was one of them
[12:05] as much a lie as saying joan of arc was
[12:10] one of them
[12:13] but to speak on that my friends
[12:17] we must understand from the scripture i
[12:20] read
[12:21] this is the pattern from the times of
[12:24] christ
[12:26] to our day and in our time
[12:29] the consistent eradication
[12:34] persecution total destruction
[12:39] and if one could not be confined to
[12:42] oblivion
[12:43] then there will then build a great tomb
[12:48] write great books right great facts
[12:52] about the individual praise them
[12:56] and elevate them as if to say
[12:59] uh here was one of us and
[13:03] that would then blind the multitudes to
[13:06] the fact
[13:07] that they were the ones that actually
[13:11] killed saint joan
[13:14] of arc the ones that
[13:18] persecuted the true saint
[13:21] their blood is upon their hands
[13:25] oh this cannot be washed off like pilate
[13:28] with a basin of water
[13:31] but one has to take responsibility and
[13:33] even now
[13:34] there are more deaths there more
[13:37] destruction
[13:38] quietly taking place unknowing to many
[13:42] it is happening even while we speak
[13:47] now saint patrick of course was born
[13:52] as the nephew of saint
[13:55] martin who was the messenger
[14:00] of the previous church age god
[14:03] used martin in a marvelous and
[14:06] wonderful way and now
[14:10] here comes saint patrick
[14:13] a nephew for he was born
[14:16] to saint martin's sister
[14:20] he a wonderful mother
[14:24] marvelous genes dna
[14:28] uh god bless him
[14:32] in a marvelous way it was said
[14:37] that he was born in a town called
[14:44] burn on the banks of the river
[14:48] clyde and one day while playing on the
[14:52] shoreline
[14:53] with his two sisters
[14:57] pirates suddenly appeared and
[15:00] kidnapped them and took them away
[15:04] and history does not record
[15:09] what happened to his sisters but of
[15:12] saint patrick
[15:13] whose name was sukkat he was sold
[15:18] to a chief chieftain
[15:21] in the northern part of ireland
[15:26] and of his duty
[15:30] as a slave was
[15:33] to feed the swine to take
[15:36] out the pigs and
[15:40] take charge of them to
[15:43] in other words to make his job easier
[15:46] to make his job something that he could
[15:50] do well
[15:52] it is recorded that this
[15:55] young man trained
[15:58] dogs and he trained
[16:01] those dogs so well
[16:06] that many people came from
[16:09] far and near to
[16:13] by the dogs that he would train
[16:18] in the midst of this all this young man
[16:23] was so lonely that after work he would
[16:26] sit
[16:28] looking at the stars in
[16:32] his loneliness and beginning to cry out
[16:36] to god
[16:38] and to talk to god and god
[16:41] was able to speak to his heart
[16:45] and to save his soul
[16:49] with his great salvation
[16:52] there came an urgent burning desire
[16:56] within his heart to escape
[17:00] and to return back to his home and to
[17:04] his parents
[17:05] and as such martin formed
[17:10] a plan and
[17:13] he planned to use his ability as a dog
[17:17] trainer
[17:18] uh to carry out this
[17:21] plan so he began to train
[17:25] these dogs
[17:28] how to cover his body he would live on
[17:32] the ground
[17:32] and all the dogs would come and cover
[17:36] his entire body he trained them to do
[17:38] that
[17:39] to cover his entire body carefully
[17:42] and they were not to move until he
[17:45] commanded
[17:46] them then one day
[17:51] his honor that that means the owner of
[17:55] him
[17:56] and the dogs sold
[17:59] the team of dogs that he had trained
[18:03] to someone else
[18:06] and of course the owner had to
[18:09] send a captain of a ship
[18:12] to pick up that pack of dogs
[18:17] and to take them to where he was living
[18:22] and martin led the dogs
[18:27] as he walked behind the owner his owner
[18:32] when they got to the shoreline
[18:35] we find that martin
[18:40] gave a signal to the leader
[18:43] of the pack of dogs who
[18:46] immediately ran off and when he ran
[18:50] off of course they were beside
[18:53] themselves
[18:55] trying to catch that one dog
[18:58] and to bring him back so that the
[19:01] contract will be
[19:02] completely filled while they were busy
[19:06] with that
[19:07] martin got into
[19:10] this marvelous boat
[19:14] and commanded the dogs to cover him
[19:18] so he laid on the bottom of that boat
[19:21] and the dogs all lay on top of him
[19:25] and covered him entirely
[19:28] and when he was sure he was covered he
[19:31] gave a
[19:32] whiffle a secret signal and
[19:36] the leader of the pack on the shore of
[19:39] course
[19:39] heard it and he came back
[19:43] and immediately leapt in the boat and
[19:46] also
[19:46] left on top of that pack of dogs
[19:50] as they lay there of course the owner
[19:54] told the captain to quickly take off
[19:57] lest one of them were to jump out again
[20:00] and so he took off with his
[20:03] with those dogs going away with them
[20:07] the owner not seeing martin around
[20:10] thinking maybe he had gone back
[20:12] he decided to leave and return to his
[20:15] home
[20:17] meanwhile patrick was in the bottom
[20:21] of that boat covered
[20:25] by those dogs
[20:28] and when he was sure after a lengthy
[20:32] period of time
[20:33] that he was far away from where he
[20:36] started
[20:38] and that the captain of that
[20:41] boat will not turn back because he had
[20:44] gone
[20:45] too far to turn back anymore
[20:48] may god help every one of us that we
[20:51] would live for christ
[20:53] in such a way that we will realize
[20:56] that we have gone too far to turn back
[20:59] now
[21:00] i want to say i believe i'm at that
[21:03] place
[21:04] where i've gone too far where i
[21:08] would turn back now the spirit of the
[21:11] lord
[21:12] has brought me thus far by faith
[21:15] and maybe he has brought you thus far
[21:18] by faith and i urge you and encourage
[21:21] you
[21:22] let us press on in the name of our lord
[21:25] jesus christ
[21:27] that we may gain the ultimate prize
[21:31] that we may have the announcement
[21:34] of our victory come thou good
[21:37] and faithful servants enter into the joy
[21:41] of the lord
[21:42] then step to the front receive your
[21:45] crown of life
[21:46] that fadeth not away receive the morning
[21:50] star
[21:51] receive the tree of life amen
[21:54] and so on god has promised the overcomer
[21:58] all these marvelous and wonderful
[22:01] promises
[22:02] if we press on right to the very end
[22:07] and cross the finish line
[22:10] ending this race of life and entering
[22:14] into the glories of our lord
[22:17] blessed be the name of the lord
[22:21] and so martin
[22:25] came from amongst the dogs
[22:28] and the captain of course was in
[22:31] surprise
[22:33] and martin threatened him that if he
[22:36] turned back he would lose the dogs uh
[22:39] upon
[22:40] upon his ship upon that boat
[22:43] and he would have a lot of trouble and
[22:47] he would take over
[22:48] he might he patrick would take over
[22:51] that boat so the captain
[22:54] happened to be a christian and when
[22:58] martin
[22:59] told him of his kidnapping
[23:02] of his sisters and his entire story
[23:06] of his slavery the captain
[23:10] decided that he would take martin right
[23:13] back to his home where he came from and
[23:16] he did
[23:18] and so martin returned to his home
[23:22] and there my friends
[23:25] god used him in a mighty way
[23:30] and he began to preach the word
[23:34] and in the preaching of the word hundred
[23:37] over a hundred thousand people
[23:40] did you hear me over a hundred thousand
[23:43] people were converted to
[23:46] true genuine christianity
[23:50] and they were born again
[23:53] by the holy spirit into the kingdom of
[23:56] god
[23:58] now the truth of the matter is that when
[24:02] rome tried to gain a foothold
[24:05] into the island they could not
[24:09] because of the preaching of saint
[24:12] patrick
[24:13] but after a while they were
[24:16] able to do it
[24:19] and once they were able to do it
[24:23] at their earliest opportunity they
[24:26] slaughtered
[24:28] killed and destroyed
[24:31] that hundred thousand hundred thousand
[24:34] people
[24:35] that followed the message of
[24:38] saint patrick well
[24:41] but today what do we have their great
[24:45] celebrations
[24:46] of saint patrick's day the garnishing of
[24:50] the tomb
[24:51] of the prophets and of these messengers
[24:55] this is the tactic and technique to
[24:58] cause
[24:58] people to forget what they did
[25:02] in the past they make a glorious thing
[25:05] about it
[25:06] and we ought to respect saint patrick
[25:09] and if we can we ought to celebrate his
[25:11] life
[25:12] and his accomplishment but no
[25:15] association
[25:17] with catholicism no association
[25:20] whatsoever but his association
[25:23] is with thus said the lord of the truth
[25:27] of the word of god god bless him
[25:31] god bless his descendants god bless
[25:35] those that follow the message that saint
[25:39] patrick
[25:40] preached now
[25:43] 60 years after the death
[25:46] of saint patrick
[25:50] columba was born
[25:53] in county donegal in northern ireland
[25:59] and he was born to a royal family
[26:03] the royal family of fergus
[26:07] born to that position
[26:11] he was brilliant intellectually
[26:16] he was also a consecrated
[26:19] scholar
[26:23] one who spent most of his time
[26:28] not just reading his bible but studying
[26:30] the word of god
[26:33] and he became a real uh one who
[26:37] actually memorized the scripture
[26:41] and knew the scripture back and forth
[26:45] for god gave him a brilliant mind and
[26:48] memory
[26:49] to use for that
[26:53] one day god called him
[26:58] not by imagination but he heard an
[27:02] audible voice
[27:04] calling out to him and to follow
[27:08] and saw columba he did that voice
[27:13] and once he heeded that voice nothing
[27:15] could stop him
[27:17] when a man or a woman or a child hear
[27:20] the voice of god
[27:22] and the calling of the holy spirit
[27:25] my friends not mother not father
[27:29] not church not pope not priests not
[27:32] superintendent
[27:33] supervisor no person can
[27:36] stop them with their desire and their
[27:39] hunger
[27:40] to fulfill the will and purpose of god
[27:44] within their lives
[27:45] because my friends they heard the
[27:47] message they
[27:48] heard the word and now they're going to
[27:51] run
[27:52] with that message that god has placed in
[27:55] their heart
[27:56] for here they are on fire with the word
[28:00] of the living god and so
[28:04] he began to preach the word miracles and
[28:08] signs
[28:09] began to follow the ministry
[28:13] of columba and not just one or two
[28:17] miracles and signs but multitudes of
[28:20] miracles
[28:22] and myriads of signs began to
[28:25] follow him his ministry
[28:28] and such an outstanding way
[28:31] that historians have written about
[28:35] this messenger of this fourth
[28:38] church age of sciatica they have written
[28:42] that since the days of them apostles
[28:46] this man's ministry is like those of the
[28:50] apostles
[28:51] for the power of god in the presence of
[28:54] the holy spirit
[28:56] vindicated him and followed him
[28:59] wherever he went glory to god
[29:02] so great was his ministry
[29:06] signs and wonders miracles
[29:09] that even it was heard about
[29:13] way over in europe in rome
[29:17] and even when they heard the signs
[29:19] wonders and miracles
[29:21] they they thought it was exaggerations
[29:24] that it was exaggerated but it was not
[29:28] it was the truth for god was
[29:31] back in the church again god
[29:34] you know the god with one man can make a
[29:37] majority
[29:38] god if god can get a hold of a
[29:41] surrendered heart
[29:42] a surrendered man a surrendered woman a
[29:45] surrendered child
[29:46] had surrendered someone god can take a
[29:50] no body
[29:51] and turn them into a somebody for his
[29:54] glory
[29:55] and for his honor and so he took kalumba
[29:59] and began to use him it is said
[30:02] that in one of his missionary
[30:06] trips approached the city
[30:11] and when he approached the city as they
[30:14] saw him coming they closed the gates
[30:17] oh back in the old testament
[30:20] they saw uh samuel the prophet coming
[30:23] they closed the gates
[30:25] they wanted to know the reason for his
[30:27] come cometh now in peace
[30:30] they wanted to be sure he didn't come
[30:32] with a curse but with a blessing
[30:35] oh my and saw the sphere of
[30:38] god was upon them they closed the city
[30:41] gates
[30:42] against columba and barnett against him
[30:47] but there in front of those gates
[30:50] he lifted up his voice and prayed to god
[30:55] asking god to intervene in this
[30:59] situation and to allow him access
[31:02] into the city his purpose being
[31:06] not business his purpose being not
[31:10] just associations oh but his purpose
[31:14] being
[31:14] to spread the word of truth everywhere
[31:18] that the hearts of men may come out of
[31:22] darkness into the glorious light of our
[31:25] lord jesus christ
[31:27] and so he prayed and as he began to pray
[31:32] they sent out the court
[31:36] magicians and musicians
[31:39] and caused them to begin to bang
[31:43] and harass columba and to
[31:46] keep all manner of noise to block out
[31:49] the sounds of
[31:51] his prayer and of his voice uh before
[31:54] god before the people that were trying
[31:57] to listen
[31:58] they they just blotted him all out
[32:01] like that and then he changed from
[32:04] praying
[32:05] and he decided he was going to sing a
[32:07] song
[32:08] he was going to sing a psalm unto the
[32:11] lord
[32:12] oh how excellent o lord is thy name
[32:16] in all the earth oh praise god and as he
[32:20] begin to sing
[32:21] and to praise god suddenly
[32:25] god's anointing came upon him
[32:29] and the volume of his voice began to
[32:32] increase
[32:34] but with so much sound and
[32:37] loudness until it drowned
[32:40] out the noises of all
[32:43] those hidden musicians that were coming
[32:47] against him and while he was still
[32:51] singing
[32:51] and while their voices were drowned out
[32:55] and
[32:56] while the gates they had it still barred
[32:59] all of a sudden they watched the
[33:03] gate began to open up on their
[33:06] own accord the gates swung
[33:10] open wide praise god
[33:13] and columba walk right into the city
[33:17] under the divine protection and
[33:20] leadership
[33:21] of the holy spirit oh may god give us
[33:24] men like that may god help me to be a
[33:28] man like that
[33:29] may god help you to be a woman a child a
[33:32] person
[33:33] like that that god can use that will be
[33:36] so surrendered to him
[33:38] that revival time would be here again
[33:41] that the holy spirit will be here on
[33:44] earth again
[33:45] wherever you are no matter how it seems
[33:48] don't look at the scenery don't
[33:52] look at the appearance of things but
[33:54] look unto the mighty
[33:56] god in christ who is above all and
[33:59] works through his children in a mighty
[34:02] and marvelous and wonderful way amen
[34:07] another time i'm speaking about columba
[34:12] the messenger of the tired siren
[34:15] churches and here he is
[34:20] going to another village to preach the
[34:23] word
[34:24] and again he was shut out
[34:28] completely out of that village
[34:32] and after a while he turned away
[34:37] as if he wanted to depart he was
[34:39] departing
[34:42] but then suddenly the son
[34:46] of the chieftain of that village
[34:49] fell violently ill
[34:52] he was so ill nigh unto death
[34:56] it caused the chieftain to open up
[35:00] and send out messengers to get columba
[35:04] and to bring him in to that village
[35:09] and so he prayed the prayer
[35:12] of faith with the powerful almighty god
[35:16] and god's spirit came upon the land
[35:20] a man and the boy jumped up
[35:23] and was instantly healed by the power of
[35:26] god
[35:27] and the entire village was so excited
[35:30] that it was opened up to the
[35:33] evangelization
[35:34] of the gospel of our lord jesus christ
[35:38] of course the pure gospel
[35:43] that was preached by columba
[35:47] my friends and his fellow workers
[35:51] it spread out from ireland it spread all
[35:55] over
[35:55] scotland the revival's
[35:58] fires began to burn it spread
[36:02] into northern europe the word
[36:05] began to move oh
[36:08] you better get ready when god gets ready
[36:11] to
[36:12] move god's spirit all over the world is
[36:16] moving
[36:17] amen god promised in these last days
[36:22] his spirit will move not with man-made
[36:25] movements but he himself
[36:28] god would restore his word
[36:31] would move in the church of the living
[36:34] god
[36:35] all the years the conquer worm palmer
[36:38] worm
[36:39] caterpillar all these armies
[36:42] have the spiritual armies of trying to
[36:44] destroy
[36:45] god's seed but thank god
[36:49] god has raised up a people again
[36:52] a people that lives by the word feeds on
[36:56] the word
[36:56] walks with the word oh my and saw
[37:00] the revival spread from ireland to
[37:03] scotland
[37:04] right into northern europe and began
[37:08] to spread out the fires of life
[37:11] of light and power of the great holy
[37:14] spirit
[37:15] of the living god overflowing in every
[37:18] way
[37:19] amen but you see
[37:22] he started out that way but then god
[37:25] started to
[37:26] give him a method and his method was
[37:30] that he would send out 12 brothers
[37:34] anointed with the holy spirit taught in
[37:38] the scriptures
[37:39] and they would go out usually there was
[37:43] a
[37:43] carpenter preachers there were
[37:46] agricultural people that could plant
[37:49] farmers and
[37:50] so on and he would send them out to
[37:53] start
[37:54] a small town and they would start a
[37:58] village
[38:00] together
[38:03] the word of god hallelujah
[38:06] and they lived holy lies
[38:10] versed in the scripture and they would
[38:13] be enclosed in that little
[38:16] uh village with a wall
[38:20] and very soon people were coming from
[38:23] near and far surrounding that village
[38:27] to be students disciples of the world
[38:32] and as they gathered it moved from just
[38:35] a fellowship of twelve
[38:38] it began to explode in numbers
[38:41] as it grew into a village
[38:45] and into a town and those men
[38:49] would study the word and go out from
[38:51] that place
[38:53] to preach in the outlying districts yet
[38:56] lying areas villages
[38:58] towns and declare the word of god
[39:01] and may i say these men were not priests
[39:05] these men were pastors and preachers
[39:08] missionaries evangelists that were set
[39:11] by the holy ghost
[39:13] and saw there were men who were allowed
[39:16] to marry
[39:17] they married amen some of them
[39:21] chose not to marry but most of them
[39:25] married and had families but there were
[39:28] preachers that were sent out with the
[39:31] word of god
[39:32] and they were they were not maintained
[39:36] by the state they were not given
[39:40] money help or maintenance
[39:43] sustenance by the state they kept far
[39:47] away
[39:48] from the state and they steered clear
[39:51] of any politics they kept right out of
[39:54] it
[39:54] they kept their eyes on the word of god
[39:58] as our prophet has said look away to
[40:01] jesus
[40:02] oh look away keep your eyes upon jesus
[40:06] amen
[40:07] and so my friends they're steered away
[40:10] from politics and my friend
[40:14] they believed that the truth
[40:18] of the world was the greatest weapon
[40:21] that they had and all they had to do
[40:24] was preach the revelation of the hour
[40:27] the power of the holy spirit embodied in
[40:31] the word of god
[40:32] amen hallelujah amen so
[40:36] they were absolutely independent
[40:39] of any religious hierarchy
[40:43] or leadership of that day in time
[40:46] including rome they were not my friends
[40:50] under any other hatship than the
[40:54] leadership and headship
[40:55] of jesus christ our lord
[40:59] saint columba was also the founder
[41:02] of a great bible school
[41:06] where he would take young men and begin
[41:09] to
[41:10] teach them the the word of god the
[41:13] rudiments
[41:14] of the word of god because one can only
[41:17] teach are various branches of the word
[41:22] but the revelation has to be of god
[41:25] amen so this bible school was on the
[41:29] island of
[41:29] high which was uh off of the southwest
[41:34] coast of scotland
[41:37] that was a notable island where the
[41:40] island was like barren
[41:42] no one could really plant uh
[41:45] food there to sustain themselves
[41:49] but the lumbar planted and prayed
[41:52] on this barren place and as he planted
[41:56] it one hand
[41:57] the other hand up raised to god in pear
[42:01] and while he prayed and planted we have
[42:04] the testimony
[42:06] that after a while it became the most
[42:09] fruitful and fertile island
[42:13] throughout that then known world
[42:17] oh praise god and from that
[42:20] that god-centered bible-taught
[42:24] and bible-shattered little island
[42:27] went fought many mighty scholars
[42:31] with the word of god who were endowed
[42:34] with wisdom
[42:36] and empowered by the power of god
[42:40] my friends whenever we read
[42:43] the history of this great servant of god
[42:47] and of the wonderful work that he did
[42:51] it saddens our hearts
[42:54] that the purple power
[42:58] nothing to bring all men
[43:01] under their control and jurisdiction
[43:06] bring all men into their grasping hands
[43:11] came and defiled
[43:15] those mission fields and destroyed
[43:19] much of the truth that was taught
[43:22] by columba at that time
[43:26] my friends tonight's lesson
[43:30] was to present to you the messenger
[43:35] of this fourth church age the church age
[43:39] of thyatira we we spoke on the fact
[43:44] that many great men arose
[43:47] but they did not come to the level
[43:50] where god could appoint them as the
[43:54] messenger to the age
[43:56] even said patrick the most
[44:00] outstanding of them all who was the
[44:03] nephew
[44:04] of saint martin he arose
[44:07] and was mightily used of god
[44:11] and he was a saint of god not a saint of
[44:15] rome but a saint of god and oh
[44:19] god bless his heart but up 60 years
[44:23] after him
[44:24] along comes columba and columba
[44:29] has been identified by history
[44:33] identified by the holy spirit
[44:37] by his word and his works
[44:41] that follow him to this very day
[44:44] may god bless him and use columba
[44:48] as we continue to study
[44:51] into these church ages going to our next
[44:54] topic
[44:56] where we will touch on the salutation
[45:00] we will touch my friends also
[45:04] upon the seed of nicolaitanism
[45:08] and may the great holy spirit help us
[45:12] as we delve into the word of god
[45:16] be with us for our next study
[45:19] next wednesday evening at this time
[45:22] god bless you subscribe
[45:26] like and come back again
[45:29] and may the lord pour out his spirit
[45:31] upon you and watch between us
[45:34] until we meet again god bless you
[45:56] [Music]
[46:11] you
